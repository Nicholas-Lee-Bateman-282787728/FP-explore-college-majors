4587948,1,B0056D5TY8,This is a Cheap Chinese Boot Leg of the series none of the original creators will see a cent from this.  Why spend money on a crappy boot leg copy?  If you really want to watch this series and where looking to save money just watch the fansubs you'll get a superior video quality and better translations as well.  I advocate buying licensed releases whenever possible but with the inflated cost of the boxset and individual DVD releases that have long gone out of print with Genon having dropped out of the US anime market I see no harm.,1337126400,10,537,4.404040404040404
4587949,5,B0056D5TY8,"I just got this today, and I'm already so very pleased with product. It doesn't have the fancy special features, but if you're a big fan and just want the episodes, this is a great buy. : ) The quality isn't fantastic, but it's clear enough. And to all those fans of the awful dubs that they have for this show, the episodes are only in Japanese. However, they do have the english dubs as an option for the movies. There are english subtitles for the shows, however the subtitles can be a little mismatched sometimes. (On the first episode, they mix up the opening title and the 1st line) I still was able to understand what was going on just fine though. The price is pretty cheap, but the case and the disks are all pretty nice in my opinion. The disks even have artwork on them, however the 1st and 2nd disks look the same, fear not, you didn't miss a season if that happened to you as well. I read from other reviews that there might be issues with playing them on different game systems and DVD players, but it works just fine on my very old PS2. Someone also said that the DVD menu doesn't work, but it works fine for me. It just varies for everyone I suppose, so word of caution. : ) Overall, you have to be crazy to want to buy all the disks separately. Those 20 disks (including 2 movies) would cost hundreds of dollars. Save yourself the money, unless you're dying for the awful dubs, slightly clearer video quality, and special features. Hope this helped! >_<",1335139200,5,1470,4.329710144927536
4587950,4,B0056D5TY8,"If you're looking for a premium, top of the line fancy set with extras and bonus features, this isn't it. The visual quality is not as crisp as the Pioneer line.  The fancy visual menus don't work, you'll have to use your DVD player's navigation & setting controls. There is no 'box' for the set.

There, we got all the bad out of the way. Now on to the good parts! The graphics aren't perfect. But they are decent. Let's be honest, if we wanted a stunning visual experience - why would we watch anime over live action? The sound is clear, with no distortion. I had no issues understanding the captions. Brand new, plastic wrapped cases; no damage. The discs played without a hitch or a skip.

And did I mention that it's 70 freaking episodes and two movies? Even if you hate the series, you have to respect the value. Otherwise you could buy the marginally better Pioneer branded series for around $800 (Or $525 used).",1332201600,9,919,4.458333333333333
4587951,4,B0056D5TY8,"For all 70 episodes and both movies, this is a really good price. The video started freezing during a few episodes depending on the player and the subtitles were sometimes wrong or misplaced but it didn't really bother me that much. All in all a VERY  cute and fun anime that is definitely worth buying.",1331769600,2,303,4.509090909090909
4587952,1,B0056D5TY8,I love this show as much as any fan but the poor video quality and less than stellar subtitle translations are irritating. If you can afford it the original Geneon/Pioneer Release of the show is a much better item for the collector or fan. If picture quality is not something you care about and you are alright with a lower quality translation track then this set is a decent deal.,1331164800,10,381,4.457142857142857
4587953,4,B0056D5TY8,"I recently decided to re-watch this series and I was ecstatic to find a compilation for 30$ instead of 500. It comes in two cases (with different cover art from item photo). The series comes on 3 discs and the movies are in the second box--I do not know how many discs are in the movie box as I have not yet opened it.

The discs do not work in every player. It won't play at all on the Wii, plays perfectly on Xbox360, and my (arguably poor quality) blu ray player can only play some of the episodes (worked fine for 13 episodes and then skipped chunks of the next three, at which point I tried the xbox360).

The subtitles are available in Chinese and English only; there is no English audio (which is okay because the translations were horrible if you ever saw them).

All in all, it was a great purchase. I am very happy with the product and, for an compact import set, it works well.",1327708800,6,888,4.211764705882353
4587954,5,B0056D5TY8,I got this for my 11 year old sister and it was perfect. I was much cheaper than other box sets and she was ecstatic. Thanks so much! (She watches it ALL THE TIME.),1326931200,,164,3.8529411764705883
