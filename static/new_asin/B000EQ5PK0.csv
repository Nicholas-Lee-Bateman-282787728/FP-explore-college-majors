2528561,5,B000EQ5PK0,"Season 5 is a very interesting season to review. Many people have mixed feelings about it. Some say its the best and some say it is the downfall of Charmed. I somewhat agree with both sides, as my opinion is the first half is great up unitl the point where they vanquish Cole and shift into baby mode. Although some of the baby episodes are good, the show definately changed after the birth of Wyatt. This season was pretty light hearted with many baby-centric episodes but this season does have its dark points. Highlights include: A Witch's Tail, Sam I Am, Centennial Charmed, The Day The Magic Died, and Oh My Goddess.

Episodes:

1. A Witch's Tail Part 1 - The sisters help Mylie (Jamie Pressly), a mermaid, with a deal she made with the sea-hag.

2. A Witch's Tail Part 2 - Phoebe becomes a mermaid and Paige and Piper must convince her to return home.

3. Happily Ever After - A witch uses the power of fairy tales to create problems for the charmed ones.

4. Siren Song - A siren is in town preying on married men.

5. Witches In Tights - the sisters are transformed into superheros in order to take out a demon.

6. The Eyes Have It - The Charmed Ones encounter a gypsy curse and aid their friend Eva to show her the way of magic.

7. Sympathy For The Demon - Barbas is back to wreck some havok on the charmed ones.

8. A Witch In Time - Phoebe must constantly save her boyfriend from dying and if she doesn't stop, she will die.

9. Sam I Am - Paige meets her father, Sam, for the first time.

10. Y Tu Mummy Tambien - Pheobe gets mummified and her sisters must rescue her.

11. The Importance Of Being Phoebe - Cole kidnaps Phoebe and sends a shapeshifter to impersonate her.

12. Centennial Charmed - Paige orbs into an alternate reality and must find a way to vanquish Cole, once and for all.

13. House Call - A witch doctor cleans the manor for all the spirits vanquished there over the years.

14. Sand Francisco Dreamin' - the girls must save a sandman.

15. The Day The Magic Died - When the whole magical community shuts down, something big is in the making.

16. Baby's First Demon - 2 Demons are after Baby Wyatt and the sisters are surprised by some of his own powers.

17. Lucky Charmed - Leprachauns are in town and being killed.

18. Cat House - Piper and Leo have marriage counseling and Phoebe and Paige relive some of the past events of the show.

19. Nymphs Just Wanna Have Fun - Paige gets turned into a nymph.

20. Sense and Sense Ability - The girls have a curse put on them with the famous ""Hear no evil, see no evil, and speak no evil""

21. Necromancing The Stone - Grams is back and confronted by an old lover.

22. Oh My Goddess Part 1 - The Titans are released and out for vengeance against the elders.

23. Oh My Goddess Part 2 - The sisters, now greek goddesses, are seduced by their powers.

Although this season had its fair share of ups and downs, it is still worth purchasing. Many changes to the show happened in this season, making it worth the money.",1141257600,203,2995,4.258407079646018

2528631,5,B000EQ5PK0,"Charmed gave me hope.  I was at a very 'dark' time in my life.  My only brother had passed away.  I was very depressed, and 'trapped' in addiction.  I can remember the only times I would feel 'hope' would be watching Charmed episodes.  (I have 7 years of sobriety now; whenever I'm asked to speak, I always talk about this time in my life, and I always mention how 'Charmed' gave me a sense of hope -- it was the only connection to a Higher Power that I had.  I could see a HP at work throughout each episode.  If that makes sense to you, then 'you're one of us'.  If it doesn't, then watch Charmed, and be entertained!)  :)  Even though Charmed is in re-runs on f/x twice a day, I still would recommend getting all the seasons on disk!  Nothing like sitting home on a rainy day, and 'binge watching' Charmed!  I loved the series.  This season is probably one of my favorites.  The 2-part season finale, ""Oh My Goddess"" has to be my most favorite Charmed episode -- ever!!!!!  Can't say enough about it.",1437523200,4,1003,4.288770053475936

2528718,5,B000EQ5PK0,"That's right folks! After it was revealed that Piper was pregnant in the Season 4 finale, she gives birth to her first child Wyatt (named after her husband Leo Wyatt) in the fifteenth episode of Season 5. As we say hello to Wyatt, we also say goodbye to Cole, who is finally vanquished two episodes prior to Wyatt's birth thanks to the Power of Three. Aside from these two significant events of Charmed, Season 5 incorporates a lot of ""flashy"" episodes. For instance, the Charmed Ones helping out a mermaid in the season premiere two-parter ""A Witch's Tail"", the Charmed Ones becoming superheroes in ""Witches in Tights"" and the Charmed Ones and Grams becoming the target of evil versions of fairy tales come to life. Even though it is quite entertaining, they don't exactly live up to classic Charmed episode plots and this season was considered by many fans to be the ""downfall of Charmed"". I disagree and think Season 5 is a great season full of many surprises and good moments, but don't take my word for it, watch Season 5 of Charmed and then write your own review.

Overall this isn't my favorite season of Charmed, mainly because of the situation with Cole and Phoebe.

My Review of the Character Arcs

Piper: I actually really liked Piper's arc this season. I know the series became very Wyatt centered, but honestly that didn't bother me because becoming a mother is really like that, and I loved the story of the family more than the paranormal actions. I wasn't fond of her being invincible though.

Phoebe: I loved Phoebe's hair this season, and her fashion. I didn't like that she got her breasts done in real life and showed them off, she was beautiful before they were done and didn't need it. I hated that she left Cole, if you love someone you love them no matter what and he was making an honest effort. The source made him evil not himself, so when the source left she should have went back to loving him.

Paige: I liked Paige's story this season more than any other Paige arc. She was discovering herself and I loved that. I loved her hair, it should have stayed this way. Redheads unite! (I am one).

Leo: Leo didn't have too strong an arc this season, even as a father, and I feel she should have.

Cole: I cried in Cole episodes because I wanted Phoebe to love him. I was never able to feel the same about Phoebe after this.

EPISODE REVIEWS

A Witch's Tail (Part 1 and 2): The only good part of the 1st part of this episode was that Jaime Pressely was in it. It was like a cheap knock off of the little mermaid. Part two was a great episode with strong emotional elements.

Happily Ever After: This episode was so-so. It wasn't a bad episode, it had great fashion (Phoebe's Dress), and I love Grams, but the story-line wasn't very strong.

Siren Song: This episode was a fairly good one. The story-line was strong, and for a moment I thought that Phoebe and Cole would get back together and that made me happy. I also love Guest Star Melinda Clarke.

Witches In Tights: This episode kind of sucked. It wasn't witchy at all.

The Eyes Have It: I did like this episode. It was one of the few Phoebe episodes this season that I was okay with. I liked the Gypsy magic in this episode.

Sympathy For the Demon: This episode was very well done. I love Barbous he is so amazing!

A Witch In Time: This was a great episode, well done time travel, and I cry so hard at the end.

Sam I Am: I love this episode because of the story-line with Paige. The story of her and Sam makes me cry, and I love it when she embraces being her withlighter

Y Tu Mummy Tambien: Weirdest and dumbest name ever. This episode was very well done, great fashion, nice story. Fun twist.

The Importance of Being Phoebe: Funny episode, great and well thought out, but Alyssa does not do a good Fake Phoebe.

Centennial Charmed: Love the idea of the alternate world, cried with Cole died for weeks.

House Call: Fun episode, loved it, all but Glenn marring someone else. That jerk!

Sand Francisco Dreamin: Great episode, fun. I hate clowns so I hide behind stuff for parts of it. Clown fearers beware!

The Day the Magic Died: Well planned, great episode.

Baby's First Demon: Passable. Paige's wig really kills it.

Lucky Charmed: Not a great episode, but I can half watch it with it being on in the background

Cat House: Nice flash backs, but I hate flash back episode in most shows

Nymphs Just Want to Have Fun: Funny episode. I loved the ending scene with Piper and Leo and the rock on joke.

Sense and Sense Ability: One of my favorites. Well written.

Necromancing the Stone: Okay, I love Penny and the idea of the episode but I always thought she only loved her first husband.

Oh My Goddess! Part 1 and 2: Good episode. I love Chris!

I cannot say yet which is my favorite season but I can say that each season is off the charts good and each season seems to be better than the one before.

I can't even tell you how thrilling it is not to be force-fed BRIDEZILLA commercials and other manner of NONSENSE they force us to watch.

I love having the Charmed library. I can flip between seasons whenever I want. I can choose a season and watch for hours at a time. If I am in the mood for Prue I have 3 seasons to watch. If I want to see the Cole years I have four seasons to flip through. If there are particular episodes I didn't like I just skip them.

It is WONDERFUL. I encourage everyone to get this library of Charmed episodes. It is not pricey if you buy used and it is worth it alone just not having to be forced to watch TRASH commercials on cable.",1340150400,,851,4.120481927710843

2528904,5,B000EQ5PK0,"One of many great shows from the late 90s in my opinion. ""Early Edition"" and ""Charmed"" being two of my favourites. Shows combining everyday life and something supernatural, which I think is an awesome and very entertaining combination. That was a very popular trend in TV shows created between 1995 and 2000 (""Buffy"", ""Angel"" and ""Touched by an Angel"" are other examples of that kind of TV series). For those who don't know what this is all about, it follows three witch sisters living in San Fransisco. They have three different powers (bring time to a standstill, see the future and move objects using only the mind), but (almost) no one except them know they have these powers or know they are witches. They have to use these powers to deal with everything from demons to more regular stuff. You can probably imagine how entertaining it is. I also happen to find Holly Marie Combs and Alyssa Milano VERY HOT! Highly recommended. I have always just really liked the atmosphere in this show.",1310256000,,992,4.7398843930635834

2528917,5,B000EQ5PK0,Product arrived on time and in good condition.  I would purchase again in the future.,1286064000,,85,4.666666666666667
2528918,4,B000EQ5PK0,"Not the best season of Charmed, but a good one overall. Although I still miss ""Prue"" (Shannen Doherty), and it seems an unnecessary amount of camera time is given to Alyssa Milano. I wouldn't go so far as to say they should've changed the name to ""The Alyssa Milano Show"", but pretty close. And she's not that great of an actress, in my opinion. She spends WAY too much effort trying to act ""cutesy"", and simply comes across as overacting.

  However, the other actors manage to carry the show, despite being saddled with Milano.

  In my opinion, this series could not have existed without Holly Marie Combs as ""Piper"". She is quite simply one of, if not the most, versatile actors I've ever seen. She can make you hate her when she's a Harpie, fear her as a Wendigo, or love her when she's being the ""mother hen"". When she is hurting over ""Leo"", she can make you feel like crying along with her. Not many actors have such range. She was really the ""glue"" that held this show together.

  And Rose McGowan has got to be one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen, and a far better actress than Milano.

  Brian Krause does his usual excellent job portraying ""Leo"", and then he gets ""promoted""! He is one of those actors, (Corin Nemec is another), who does his parts so perfectly & effortlessly that reviewers often overlook them, and audiences forget them. Not fair, but that's life.

  Anyway, if you're just getting ""Charmed"" for the first time, don't start with this season. Follow them in order. You'll be rewarded with a lot more entertainment!  (And understanding). Enjoy!",1273363200,3,1583,4.620071684587813

For any Charmed fan this is quite a must have!!,1268697600,,356,3.6973684210526314
2528921,5,B000EQ5PK0,"This is one of my favoriate seasons!  One reason is because I remember watching this season when it came on the WB and my friends and I would watch it.  They called me Piper because I act so much like her.  Plus, we waited for the antipication for piper's baby to be born.  I like many of the stories in this season.  Especially the few episodes before piper gives birth.  They are funny and creative.  It is sad when Cole is vanquished.  I am watching season 4 right now and I am sitting here wishing he didn't turn into the source.  But they had to come up with something I guess.  I also hate the fact that Piper and Leo are forced to be apart because he became an elder in the end.  Those points did disappoint, but for the most part, it's a very good season!",1255219200,,763,4.122448979591836
2528922,3,B000EQ5PK0,"I will try to go into as little detail as possible, but some spoilers will be present in this review

I often think of Charmed as being the biggest mixed bag in my TV on DVD collection.  At its best Charmed is a highly entertaining show, while at its worst it's downright painful to watch.  I happened to first get hooked into this show by a story arc in the second half of the 4th season that I consider to be the pinnacle of the series.  Unfortunately, what followed in the fifth season was for me one of the lowest points of the series.  To sum it all up, Cole deserved better!  He was such a great character in seasons 3 and 4, his turn back to evil in the later being truly tragic and beyond anyone's control.  And if they'd left it at that I would have been satisfied.  But they had to bring him back just to give him an arc where he becomes more and more desperate in his attempts to win Phoebe back until they finally have to vanquish him (again) once and for all.  Phoebe in particular comes off as extremely unlikable in this arc, turning colder and colder toward the man she once loved.

The rest of the season is much like the rest of the series, with equal doses of good storytelling and cheese.  The final 2 episodes at least begin an arc that will lead into a much better sixth season.  If you can get through this, you might as well continue on because the show does not return to this level afterward.",1248739200,3,1418,4.191881918819188

Since it was too much hazzle sending them back and figuring somewhere down the line a disc could get damaged and might need replacement, it would make more sense to just keep both sets of the season five.  You see I am one of those strange people who has a computer that still runs on ME, and doesn't have a disc copier, of any kind, nor friends that do.  Besides now that I think about it, the season was one of the very best of them all.  I highly reccomend it and don't forget season six when her second child arrives. Have fun! I know I have!!! Remember each pregnancy is diferent so don't expect season six to be like season five. Just sit back and enjoy!",1244160000,,769,4.175675675675675

2528949,4,B000EQ5PK0,"I've enjoyed watching Charmed in the past, and I've been made fun of it because I'm a man and this is a ""chick show."" But the fact is, this show can get so good at so many points that it's worth watching every episode just to make sure you're not missing anything. In previous seasons we have a dark, interesting, exciting, and comical show that blends well to make something worth watching. When season 5 started, things started to slow down for me. The episodes were entertaining but got a little silly. This is the season when the villains became cheesy and over the top, while I'm sure some people can appreciate that, I enjoyed the villains where there was a sense of urgency behind everything. The special effects were a mixed bag. They were good, I guess, but they could've been used so much better. The writing continued to be good and the sisters' dialogue kept being sarcastic and smart, but the overall storylines to every episode kind of lacked. The best parts of season 5 are the episodes that are darker: The Day The Magic Died was great on many levels, and Centennial Charmed was good in its own way too. I have to admit the season two-part opener was enteraining tho. The acting in this show overall never quite did it for me, but I was used to it by this season. I'd say if you're a fan of this show, you should continue watching because there are many strong points in the future. It just never gets as good as it was.

2528950,4,B000EQ5PK0,"Season 5 was probably the most sad season of them all. One because Cole is finally vanquish and Leo becomes an Elder leaving the sister alone. One good thing is Wyatt's born and, in the final episodes, Chris's Future self shows up. This season would probably have to be the most magical season of them. I'm talking mermaids, leprechauns, dwarfs, fairy tales, and whatnot. And Paige gets a visit from two important ""relatives"" she's never met and has to decided if she has room in her heart for anymore family, can guess?? lol I'll give you a hint, she has already met her mother, who else is there?. You'll know the answer to this if you're a true fan like me.

All in all this season hasn't been the most entertaining, but it was interesting.",1214006400,,743,4.503703703703704

2528953,5,B000EQ5PK0,"Well season 5 has become one of my favorites now. The episodes are fun and creative I think. Paige is finally learning and growing as a sister and a witch and seems to have bonded with Piper and Phoebe. Paige definitely brings a whole new quirkiness to the show but is also a lot like Prue when it comes to magic.  Then there is Cole, I know there were a lot of fans who loved Cole but I was glad to see Cole go, it was time, there was nothing really more they could do with his character. Plus Julian McMahon was/is doing Nip Tuck so bye-bye Cole! That episode is actually one of my favorites, where they ""finally"" vanquish him, Centennial Charmed. It was good to see Paige use everything she learned about being a witch and a sister. My other favorites are Y Tu Mummy Tambien, it is very entertaining between Cole and Piper since they both are invinceable, the Siren Song is also a fun one with Piper's powers all messed up cuz of Wyatt and her and Leo end up swithing powers, Witches In Tights is also a lot fun - everyone dreams of being a super hero!  *Cat House is a good one for Paige...to be able to go back in time to see how Piper and Leo started and to see how Phoebe has changed thru the years. The Day Magic Died and Sense and Sense Ability are good ""sister"" episodes. And of course the finale with Oh My Goddesses 1 & 2, great finale but sad for Piper and Leo, no matter how many times I watch this one I always cry!  *Cat House, there is one scene in this episode where the demon who is going after the Charmed Ones familiar steps on Piper and Leo's wedding topper and crushes it.  I never put it together but they had said ""well didn't that change history""...Piper and Leo break up at the end so Leo can become an elder!!!  Definitely a must by for any Charmed fans :o)",1210896000,,1785,4.16231884057971

2528982,2,B000EQ5PK0,"The 5th season of Charmed of the now defunct WB show is both classy and trashy all at the same time. The producers make important choices that enchance the girls lives, such as carrer changes and promotions, look out for Phoebe's colum making her a huge star, and Paige finding her magical calling. They also introduce new and exciting mythical creatures such as mermaids, fairytales, and gypsies into the show. However, the writers also make 3  collasal mistakes which forever damage the show. Getting rid of Cole in its landmark 5th episode, after embarassingly enough reducing him to an insane man starving for love is a bad choice. Phoebe never agai nregained the kind of chemistry she had with Cole no many how many actors the writers threw her together with. Plus, Cole's precense in the show is astounding. Not many actors can come into a show in the 3rd season and command the show in the stellar way this fine character did.  Furthermore,  creating an endless parade of various love interests for Phoebe who towards the end of the season becomes a caricature of the once brazen and sexy self she used to be is another huge mistake.

The final mistake is Piper's pregnacy. The show never did recover from the constant and almost insane attention given to Piper's child which in real life would be neccessary, but in a show about 3 brazen, comic, and strong women completley takes away the desire to see these three as the Charmed ones, which is replaced by the vacant stare of the maternal ones.
The 5th season is both good and bad, sad and triumphant, but believe me this is really the last Charmed season to buy, during the next 3 seasons the Charmed producers take full advantage of not being cancelled by their network and come up with indescribable fluff that can only be enjoyed by someone who isn't used to the power of 3 back in the good ole days.",1190419200,4,1863,4.619335347432024

This season though - is really a favorite.. The shining episodes for me are:

Sam I Am

The Importance of Being Pheobe

Contennial Charmed

Cat House (definate top ten!)

Sense & Sense Ability (I find this hilarious)

The Day the Magic Died

Sympathy For the Demon

A Witch in Time

Horrendous episodes:

Oh My Goddess parts 1 & 2...what were they thinking? You could really see the girls fighting through the scenes when they really didn't like what they were doing...

Witches In Tights - definately a filler and an all time low in creative writing.  It was cute for a giggle but just useless.

I like the humor in Y Tu Mummy Tambien... its got a cheesy opening but really fun, in my opinoin, after the credits are done rolling.

I really find this a strong season... even though there were tons of Other Wordly Creatures stopping by, it seems really cheesy but really made it fun.",1178841600,,1130,4.552238805970149

There were two appearences from the wonderfully talented Jennifer Rhodes. It was fun watching the preparations for the birth of Wyatt including all of the magical hijicks he was able to do from the womb.  It was very funny. The only two reason I didn't give it five stars is one: there's still no extras. Would it of been too much to add delete scenes or something? And the second slightly harder the death of Cole. I loved the charactor and the incredable gorgeous talented Julian McMahan lit up every scene he was in. I kept hoping he would come back.,1155168000,2,701,4.351145038167939

2529084,1,B000EQ5PK0,"I cannot believe the story line of this show and this season. The writers cannot even keep track of what they wrote in previous seasons.  For instance, in one show, Phoebe casts a spell and her older self and younger self materialize.  The older woman says she married Cole and never married again.  After watching the final show with Phoebe marrying Cupid, I just threw up my hands.  I would have loved to have had Cole back and Paige vanquished for being terminally stupid and always thinking she can do it all.  I didn't like her to start with and never grew any fonder.  They could have enhanced the show tremendously if Cole had been made whole and still retained his powers.  Cole saved those dimwit Charmed ones numerous times and actually turned back into a demon because Phoebe took the powers he was giving to another and put them back in him and killed the other guy.  Now they get all prissy about him being evil?  I also was sick and tired of Paige and Phoebe dressing like bad ladies. Picture going to your job in some of their get ups. Loved the first four seasons - the rest are sloppy and dopey. I am not a fan of Doherty, but her character worked and you believed that those 3 were sisters.

I love everything about Charmed, as you may have read in other posts i have made, but this season is the one that made me love Charmed forever.  This is the season when Piper and Leo are expecting their first child after trying so desperately hard the last season to concieve. In the very first episodes we find that Piper is dealthly afriad that she will leave her baby as she was once left. And it scares so much that she ends up casting a fearless spell on herself and almost gets them both killed.
As you know, Piper DID NOT lose her baby and she DID eventually have it close to the end of the season.  This is my favorite episode ever!  I know for a fact that i could not handle going through the situtation she did WHILE having a baby.  I'm not sure what would have happened to me.  But either way, the fact that Piper did actually have the baby was, in itself, a miracle.
I also think that the name they gave the baby was totally appropriate.  Wyatt Matthew Halliwell- Wyatt because of his daddy, Matthew because of his super-protective auntie Paige and Halliwell becasuse demons fear it and good magic respects it. This is the perfect name for a child with such a bright and wonderful future ahead of him!",1150329600,,1306,4.371900826446281

2529087,5,B000EQ5PK0,I think that this is the best season of charmed that there is. It is so much better than season four. This season is so much much more happier than season four. Paige is now becoming a very good witch and there is the birth of baby Wyatt. I love all of the magical creatures in this season. This is a season that any charmed fan must have. Also in this season Phoebe finally vanquishes Cole for the final time.,1149638400,4,410,4.1375
2529098,5,B000EQ5PK0,you said that shannon dorherty was in this season but she isn't.,1149552000,,64,4.416666666666667
2529099,3,B000EQ5PK0,I love Charmed. I have all the seasons but the fourth one i found kinda boring because of the departure of Prue and the entering of Paige. Season four didn't really tie together as well as seasons 1-3 did. I thought season four was scatered and didn't really make a lot of sense. I watched everysingle episode of Charmed seasons 1-8 and would have to say season four was my least liked.,1149552000,2,386,4.375
2529100,5,B000EQ5PK0,"This season is one of my favourite seasons from Charmed.  It is a great follow-up from season four.  There are a few changes with the arrival of wyatt and the demise of Cole.  I love all the episodes with the exception of Nymphs just want to have fun and Lucky Charmed. I like the magical creatures but there was absoultely no point to those episodes. Other than that, if you like drama with a hint of comedy then get Season five.",1149465600,,430,4.283950617283951
2529101,3,B000EQ5PK0,"I've been a Charmed fan since it's inception, and I'll admit, some of the episodes have been a bit much, but quite frankly, unless you are really interested in seeing just how ""normal"" the lives of the charmed ones can be, the babies just don't belong here.

When Cole was dropped (and how could see vanquish ANYONE that looks like Julian McMahon??) and Wyatt added, it gave Piper a haus frau image that most of us didn't want her to have, and made bad girl Phoebe too good to be true.  It was disappointing.

I was sorry to see the show finale last night (and I'm sure I'll buy all of the seasons DVDs), but at least there was a ""they lived happily ever after"" ending.  The really sad part of the whole thing was that the only way the three super powerful witches could be happy was if they were married and had children.  All of the demonstrations of female empowerment - shot to hell.",1148256000,7,887,4.319277108433735
2529102,3,B000EQ5PK0,"I've got seasons 1-4 on DVD already, but am hesitant to buy this one.  The mix of the first 3 seasons with Prue making up the original 3 charmed ones still on it were the best to me, season 4... ok, out of curiosity to remember all about Paige's arrival.

It's been a bit below that level since the days of Cole's departure & kind of lingering without a lot of clear direction or focus.  I used to have to watch Charmed every week for the first few seasons, now I don't really care if I miss it & it's a struggle to sit through an episode without getting distracted.

Curious that this DVD set doesn't get released until June in the US, here in NZ this set has been available in the stores since late March, and I saw season 6 appear on the shelves last week too.",1147824000,5,763,4.100671140939597
2529103,5,B000EQ5PK0,Just a big fan of the series and sad to have it come to an end.  If it's your type of entertainment you'll thoroughly enjoy it.  Start at season one and work your way through.,1147651200,4,175,3.9714285714285715
2529104,5,B000EQ5PK0,"Many people may be shocked that I say that. I, being a fan of both shows and seeing every episode of each, have come to the conclusion Charmed is better. This season may be the start of a small downhill slide but the show crawls it's way back up by the end. Each episode better than it's last. Buy this.(Even though Paramount won't put on special features) It's still worth the price! This is the best show on television and at least season 8 will have extras!",1147046400,7,460,4.2988505747126435
2529105,5,B000EQ5PK0,"Charmed is the BEST Show ever!! Season 5 is great, Although my favorite seasons are 1-3, seasons 5-8 are great. My favorite episodes are when Wyatt is born and Oh My Goddess part 1 and 2. An awsome over-all season.",1146182400,5,214,4.375
2529106,4,B000EQ5PK0,"Charmed overall is my favorite show.  Every show has those episodes that you could have done without, but the plotline of this show is off the chain!  Season 5 had a lot of exciting episodes and the story began to grow and evolve past three sisters fighting demons.  I wish that Charmed could stay on TV forever and if not, they should do episodes for DVD or some sort of movie!",1146009600,4,378,4.295774647887324
2529107,5,B000EQ5PK0,"ok ok ok. everyone's complaining about how prue died at the end of 3 but as im very anti-Prue, all I have to say is if you're that biased as to stop watching a show based on one character, its better off not having you as a fan of such a great show. and I did not like Paige at all for a while but as time passed I got used to her and even started to like her. sure it sucks to lose Cole as he is my second favorite character. but this season introduces Chris Perry(Halliwell) and he is the best character ever, in my opinion. and I still love the show even in Season 8 so quit looking for any random excuse to quit watching. if you like it, good. if you don't, watch something else and stop bothering the true fans. thanks so much =)",1145491200,6,734,3.9328859060402683
2529129,5,B000EQ5PK0,"I am sick and tired of all these people saying, "" Aw I stop watching it because Prue died and it just got boring."" If you don't like fine, go and harass a different show. As for the people who continue to support and watch this show. This season is a great buy to add to your collection.",1145404800,6,287,3.9655172413793105
2529130,4,B000EQ5PK0,"Let's face it - I'm a Prue fan from way back.  The show took a whole new turn when she left and although her character was a pain in the ass alot of the time - her character fit.

But anyway I'm getting off track - I was actually pleasantly surprised watching Season 5 again on dvd.... it was more tolerable than I remembered.  Not to mention it filled in a few blanks for me cos I started to fall off the band wagon this season and missed a few episodes.

I will say though that the mermaid/fairytale/superhero episodes were...... well, I think they brought to light how the show seemed to be opening up it's demographic to the younger teen audiences.  Cos I just found them for the most part of ridiculous lol.

P.s. I liked Paige a bit better this season.  If that matters at all.  However, My Charmed collection would not be complete without season 5 - so it's all good.",1145059200,3,874,4.286585365853658
2529131,2,B000EQ5PK0,"This season has to be the second aweful season ever. Like the fourth was any better. This one took the sister to its lowest point of the series. The only great part of the season would be cole dies(for real!) this time. The second thing that was great was the birth of wyatt. Lastly the two part season finale. I don't know about everybody else. But the season ending with a cliff hanger about a guy from the future and Leo being sent off to somewhere. it was awesome! The rest of the season was aweful. even the comic book hero thing. I love comic book stories, but they killed the idea. I agree with some of the other reviews on pheobe's part of the story. They did use her alot and agonized her character with cole love thingy? I mean come on. pheobe was for once annoying this season. I'm a huge fan of Alyssa Milano, but her character wanted me to kill her. Because of her ex-relationship with cole. Still paige also was annoying and piper and leo were set up in the stories alot as usual too! But if you are like me, you still would buy this season; because you are a charmed fan and if not. then you're curious about it. so buy it!",1144972800,,1138,4.200913242009133
2529132,3,B000EQ5PK0,"actually I lied, Charmed's demise actually began with Prue's death, and the insert of Paige- Rose McGown just CAN'T act don't even start with me. But after Prue's death Cole was the best thing that kept me watching, but guess what??? Season five they TOTALLY (NOT AN OVERSTATEMENT) destroyed him, killed him at least 5 times. we thought an happy ending for Cole when he was turned into a human AND saved the sisters, but NOOOOO, he became the Source instead, how can you NOT feel sorry for him?? NONE of it was HIS fault!!!! It was ALL the writers' fault, geez if you need to pull Cole off Charmed just gave him a GLORIUS death please!! NOT a pathetic one.

And of course after that things just went down hill. I thought the Chris storyline was interesting in an okay way- 'cause I have a soft spot for parent-child relationship. But Drew Fuller, while really pretty, can't act either, gosh. After Prue and Cole they just kept bringing up people who can't act Sh***

Anyways for those who are Charmed fan who was disappointed with it (understandably) from this season on, and haven't seen Angel, I suggest you pick up Angel, that one WILL NOT disappoint you and it's what healed me- that I found something worthy of both entertainment and deep-thinking.",1144713600,7,1253,4.614349775784754
2529133,5,B000EQ5PK0,I thought season 5 was the best work so far I can't wait to get it. Season five was a season where Pagie quits her job to work more at being a more powerful witch and Pheobe trying to divorce cole she did when they vanquished him in the 100th episode. Then Wyatt was included in the cast I thought the story of Piper and Leo was getting stronger and I thought the season ended pretty well I love charmed I've watched it since the show started. I was deeply sad when Prue died wasn't so sure about Paige but when she came on I fell in love with that character the fisrt episode she came in in season 4. Now 8 years later after 1st season started I have never forgotten how much peace this show has brought me and the season 5 of charmed was a lighter season and it was like taking a breath from all the tense from the past 2 season of charmed before season 5. This dvd set is totally worth it. I don't care much for extras I like it when it only has the show and I watch them every day never get tired of them.,1144195200,8,1009,3.950980392156863
2529134,5,B000EQ5PK0,Even though season 5 has not been released. I have seen all the episodes on tv. To me these are some of the best ones. My favorite is Cathouse where Paige gets to see several memories that she missed from the earlier shows. I can't wait for this season to be released and I agree that they should release the eposided at the same time.,1144022400,3,335,4.1692307692307695
2529135,4,B000EQ5PK0,"Season one was good, season 2 was better, season 3 was awesome and season 4 was near perfect. Now, as for season 5, not too many good things can be said about this season. I began watching Charmed as it was beginning season 4 and loved it. I quickly caught up that summer after season 4 with reruns on TNT so I was all caught up on the series and what the show has given as far as quality is concerned. Season 5 is not up to par with the previous ones for many reasons. The main reason was the fairytale crap. There were SO many episode that revolved around a fairytale creature or them becoming a fairytale creature. Dont even get me started on the one where they became superheroes...anyway. Reason number 2 was that the show became mainly about middle sister Phoebe. They focused on her way too much this season, if anything it should have been on Paige since she is no longer brand new to the craft and she should have had some more story. Piper and Leo were used decently this season we got to see them give birth to Wyatt and whatnot. Also, the 100th episode was also good, finally ending Coles storyline...seriously, how many times can they kill him? and even after hes dead he still come back in season 7. WTF i ask. anyway, the third and final reason i felt the show began to slip was they stopped continues storylines over the season which is my favorite part of any series. Season one didn't really have one, two began ot have one, with the triad and such. 3 did have one, the triad and source. season 4 had the best. the source and cole becoming the source. This season it was...nothing! a little bit of cole stuff in the beginning but thats it. And my least favorite part of season 5...the introduction of Chris, ugh.  Anyway, i will buy season 5 but only to have the whole collection, im stupid like that i need to have the whole thing, lol. anyway, what have learned ladies and gents? Season 5 is when  charmed began to suck.",1143676800,3,1940,4.326923076923077
2529136,3,B000EQ5PK0,"Season 5, at least to me, is when the series really started to deviate from the original concept and direction the creator Constance M. Burge had planned for it.  The show was originally always supposed to be about 3 sisters who happen to be witches, but more and more (and this really started in the last bit of season 4) the show became about 3 witches who just so happen to be sisters.  The show gradually begins to be more and more Phoebe-centric and about mythical magical creatures instead of saving actual innocents like Charmed originally was in the it's prime seasons 1-4 (well, 4 until about the last fourth of it).  Season 5 does have a few good episodes, though.  For example ""Siren Song"" when Baby Halliwell swaps his parents' powers is quite possibly the funniest episode of the show until the episode in the 8th season when Piper and Leo actually end up switching bodies.  ""Cat House"" is a great episode if you are a Piper and Leo fan since it relives some of their best moments.  ""The Day Magic Died"" brings the birth of Piper and Leo's baby.  ""Centennial Charmed"" is a good, but sad, episode that marks the 100th episode of the series.  Aside from that, there are no other good episodes as a whole really, at least none that compare to the caliber of earlier seasons.  There are some good moments sprinkled in every so often, but this season is when the show really began to deviate from the Charmed that people originally began watching, although it is a million times better than the crap season 6 Brad Kern put us through.  Even though this is the season the show really dropped the ball, I would recommend it for the simple fact that it is much more convenient than VCR cassettes or watching downloaded episodes on the internet.  Alyssa Milano/Phoebe lovers will love this season as it is when Kern's obsession with her really began to take over and she began dressing in less and less clothing more and more of the time, but most Charmed fans who have seen the earlier seasons will know and back me on the fact that this season is nowhere close to the amazing earlier seasons they had in 1-4.  Nevertheless, like I said...I'm getting it just because it's much less hassle than VCR cassettes...but I refuse to waste money on season 6 since that season was pure crap, I'm still on the fence about season 7 because it was half decent and half crap, but I will purchase the final season 8.  I hope this helped people who aren't hardcore Charmed fans...if you are a Charmed fan then you already know the season and my opinion won't make much difference in your decision anyways, but I felt it was only fair to put an opinion out there from someone who is NOT obsessed with Phoebe or Alyssa Milano and actually enjoys seeing other people and storylines on the show besides her.",1143590400,9,2793,4.52882703777336
2529137,5,B000EQ5PK0,"Season 5 of Charmed brought about a new direction for the series.  In season 4 the show took a very dark path and brought a more serialized element to the series.  Season 5 brought Charmed into the light and showed other elements that the show is able to accomplish.  During the first four seasons the show tended to mainly explore the human world and the underworld.  In season 5 we saw other elements in the magical community and innocents that the Charmed ones needed to save that weren't always human, but mermaid and nymphs.  While the show had it's much lighter moments this season it also had it's dark points as well with the character of Cole going crazy from the powers he asorbed in the finale of season 4 and the inevitable vanquish of his character in the 100th episode.  Then we had great family moments with the birth of Piper's son in ""The Day the Magic Died"" and how the character of Piper evolved into becoming a great mom and protector.  Then once again the drama picked up in the finale with the tearing apart of Charmed's favorite couple Piper and Leo and the great cliffhanger that left us wondering if Leo would ever be back.

Season 5 of Charmed is another great season and worth adding to the Charmed collection.",1142899200,7,1237,4.515695067264574
2529138,3,B000EQ5PK0,The box art for the United States version is a joke compared to the version being released in the UK.

Season 5 stills retains it's sense of realism with the added drama and wit that made CHARMED a huge success, but for me this series lost that special something that made it a must watch programme, though it picks it up as it nears the end.

2529143,5,B000EQ5PK0,"I am a die-hard Charmed fan. I love its wonderful mix of fantasy, spirituality, family drama, and even the comic moments it provides. This show, all 8 seasons, is a fine example of Wiccan fantasy and entertainment (with a smidge of truth behind everything, much like the Harry Potter films and books) that everyone can understand and conveys spiritual truths that anyone can appreciate regardless of religious affiliation. In my opinion, the Heart of Wicca is well-represented in this show's universe.

I may be in the minority here...but I find Season 5 one of the best. I personally think the show improved with the introduction of Paige in Season 4...and feel like her seasons took the show to a whole new level. Her struggles are profound, and fascinating to watch: being a Witch/Whitelighter, rising above the spectre of Prue in the eyes of her newfound sisters, and learning to balance being both a magical being and living in the mortal world as a Social Worker. I REALLY love her character.

But, with Season 5 particularly...I loved the introduction of more fantasy-inspired elements, the nymphs, mermaids, leprechauns and such...they gave the season a much needed lift...especially considering how dark Season 4 was...particularly the last half, with Phoebe's Dark Wedding to Cole/The Source of All Evil and her demon pregnancy...effective, but dark.

Loved the episodes regarding Piper and Leo having a child...very touching. I can't say enough about this season (or any of the seasons for that matter, they are all unique and special in their own way). I highly recommend this to any fan of Charmed, or just great fantasy-entertainment.",1141948800,20,1648,5.118959107806692

2529146,5,B000EQ5PK0,"well like most people i agree that this season had its good episodes and its bad ones. i think the first part of the season with cole was good up untill the last 1 or 2 episodes then it just got kinda depressing and sad and they ran out of thing for him to do. but OMFG i loved oh my goddess and the rest of the episodes with drew fuller. he is really hot and great in the 6th season which i hope comes out soon after the 5th. he definetly looks TOO KOOL 4 SKOOL  when he first enter in ""oh my goddess"" with the sunglasses.
 anyway back to my review this season is one of the best. yes it has 4-5 episodes which arnt very entertaining after the first few  times you see them but it also has some very sad moments like when cole is vanquished the first time. i like cryed my eyes out the first time i saw that i mean its a really good season one of the best i would give it a 4/5 maybe even a 4.5/5 depending on which part of the season it is. charmed is a great show.

also its weird the season 5 cover in UK iss green with a really cool picture but the one here is blue. Does anyone know why? caus ei really liked the green one. and is it going to be th same with  season 6 becasue the UK amazon site says the season 6 DVD is red? well if anyone know please contact me @

8113018,5,B000EQ5PK0,"It seems like a lot of this season was built around either resolving storylines or leaving the door open for new ones that would come back later. The Avatars and the final destruction of Cole would be one. Maybe the most important was the introduction of ""Chris"" in the season finale, leaving the door open to speculate what Chris really might have been revealed as in Season 6, before the storyline got altered because Holly Marie Combs really got pregnant in Season 6.

At any rate, another great season of this show. Hard once again to single out any one favorite--maybe the introduction of little baby Wyatt is something to single out. The birth of the magical prodigy & how he may or may not be the final destruction of all that is evil--if he doesn't get turned. More on that coming in later seasons. As I said before, a lot of stuff is left open for future development, like Leo turning into an Elder.

Maybe there are some future plotholes in year 6, hard to tell if the show slips that time, but it's worth checking out....",1506038400,,1032,4.48404255319149
