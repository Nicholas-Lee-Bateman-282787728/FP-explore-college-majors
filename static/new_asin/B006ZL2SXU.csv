5040144,5,B006ZL2SXU,"Why on earth can't we in the States and Canada get Season 3 (Series 5 and 6) in Region 1 Format?  I loved this season...from Matt's untimely death to DS Brooks bonding with his new Junior partner, Sam Kasey to Sam's ""downfall"" by sleeping with a witness, who turned out to be the murderer (rookie mistake).  And who can dislike anything that Freema Agyeman does?  (To me, she was the best of the Doctor's companions - different show FYI).  It looks as though Seasons 1 and 2 have sold well and Season 4 is in production in the UK, so WHY CAN'T WE AMERICANS BUY SEASON 3???  Seriously, who do I have to make my complaint to?",1353974400,21,623,4.2905982905982905

8506986,5,B006ZL2SXU,"The last series of Law and Order UK featured the first major personnel changes since the show started in 2009 with Dominic Rowan and Peter Davison joining the prosecution side. Now these two have settled in we have a further significant change, this time on the police team. Following Matt Devlin, played by Jamie Bamber's departure, somewhat traumatically at the end of Series 5, Sam Casey, played by Paul Nicholls is the new Junior Detective Sergeant.

We have seven shows this time round to go with the 32 previous episodes. These continue to be sourced from the long running US series, which are screened for stories which will translate well to a UK setting. The US source shows for Series 6 were variously originally screened between 1995 and 2009. Whilst I did remember one or two of them from their originals I cannot say it spoiled my enjoyment. However, why they need to continue to be sourced in this manner is not clear to me as I do not see the problem in producing some UK scripts which can be tailored for this market.

The format of the series is as previously. There is a crime which is investigated by the police side, who identify and charge the alleged perpetrator. Then we go over to the prosecution side whose job it is to try to obtain a conviction. Unusually the last episode in Series 5 carried on into the first of Series 6 so we have our first two part story. It is not at present clear whether a Series 7 and 8 is planned (13 episodes at a time are commissioned). However, as this has quickly developed into something of a mainstay in our TV scheduling I would think and hope that it is very likely.

The shows in this series were based on US episodes screened between 1994 and 2009.  These are the titles followed by the US episode they are based on:

Survivors Guilt  (Suicide Box)
Immune  (Double Down)
Haunted  (Ghosts)
Trial  (Double Blind)
Line Up  (Performance)
Dawn Till Dusk  (Mayhem)
Fault Lines  (Just a Girl in the World)

Please note that Series 5 and 6 in the UK are the same as Season 3 in the States.  I believe that this particular set is in Region 2 format (European) so will only play on a Region 2 DVD player or a Region Free DVD player.",1382140800,5,2185,4.443609022556391
8506987,5,B006ZL2SXU,"This is a great series from the U.K. I am frustrated that it is so hard to get the series on DVD or elsewhere. Why is it being held back when so much dreck is available on DVD. Most of the DVDs of this that are available are on the Region 2 format, which is unplayable here in the U.S. I was able to get this one DVD of Series 6, which, for some reason, does play on our system. Some marketers are asleep at the wheel.",1381104000,5,418,3.8160919540229883
