2711778,4,B000LP5FXQ,"For anyone who enjoys anime, this is a good series to start with.  Even though the story takes place in a futuristic setting and many of the storyline concepts have changed, much of the plot and rich characters of the original ""Seven Samurai"" have been retained.  Clearly the budget was spent in making sure the Nobuseri and other CG images meshed well with the traditional animation of the characters, and it works on that level.

Granted the first two episodes of Samurai 7 start slow, but it is necessary to establish the characters of the mismatched seven who come to the aid of Kanna Village.  Furthermore, the issues of honor, war, respect that were prevalent in the original are once again on display in this anime without overshadowing the awesome fight scenes, or vice versa.",1173139200,10,784,4.785185185185185
2711779,5,B000LP5FXQ,"If you like guys swinging swords and a great anime adventure, then you definitely want to buy this amazing set! About 11 years ago, I saw the trailer for Samurai 7 and I was really stoked about because I love samurai action and a great plotline. The anime is based on Akira Kurosawa's legendary epic, ""Seven Samurai"", which after watching this anime, I really need to see it. It just has a different twist to it due to having mechanical bandits as the antagonists instead of human bandits. Basically, the anime follows the end of a great war between samurai and mechanical bandits terrorizing villagers for rice. One village decides to hire samurai to fight off the bandits through political warfare. I really enjoyed this anime, and I would put this in my ""Top 25 Anime List"" because it told a great story, provided great character development and the action scenes were awesome!

Now, let me tell you about this amazing collection set:

The set contains 10 discs, 7 DVDs showing each samurai and 3 Blu-Ray discs. The video quality for the Blu-Ray looked wonderful and the Dolby TrueHD sound is spectacular. If you have a separate set for either DVD or Blu-Ray, you don't need to buy this set. I only bought this set because I wanted to get this for the DVD & Blu-Ray together. It's definitely worth it! :D",1472601600,,1307,4.629310344827586

We started watching the series together, and boy do I like the show now too!  I am really glad I bought this, and anyone who is interested in Anime should like it too.  It is a 7 disc set, and everything came correctly.  You should definitely buy this show!",1211155200,,372,4.197183098591549
2711783,4,B000LP5FXQ,"I know nothing of animated movies... My wife and I like and enjoy our cartoons and over the top action. This had that and more. Good story, deep characters, enjoyable action, and of course oh my gosh I can't believe he just did that...

Anyway we watched it with our kids and while there was a little bit of bloody violence I did not find it excessive.",1210377600,,352,4.253731343283582
2711784,5,B000LP5FXQ,"This is a great animation that combines battles, traditional anime, some 3d animation.  It honors some of the Japanese traditions, and the rice and their farmers are central themes of history.  I've heard that a long time ago Japanese were divided in 4 main casts: farmers, samurai (warriors), merchants, and royalty.  This story shows the struggles for power among these casts.  The end is very emotional; indeed, not a children's storybook.

2711785,5,B000LP5FXQ,if you enjoy samurai anime then you have got to see this series. it's a little slow in parts but what anime isn't. i highly recommend this series.,1207353600,,146,4.25
2711786,5,B000LP5FXQ,"Yeah boy! This by far is the best Anime I have ever seen. This is a really good anime set if you are definetly into samurai. This was a kind of cooler futuristic remake of the old Japanese classic, Seven Samurai. I have not seen but I guess it must be good because of how awesome this turned out. I really liked how all of the samurai in the show come from different places but they are all pretty much related because of the ""Great War."" Another aspect I really enjoyed was the particular episode when Kambei (the main character) sharpens his sword on the whetstone, I mean to me that was just awesome. This box set is cool because it comes with seven little booklets that comes with cool art from the show and little interviews of the creators of this Anime. However I think the price is a bit too high for this item. I mean I bought my set at F.Y.E. for only $49.99 not for $79.99. (However I would of bought anyway at this price because it so good!) Anyway if your not so sure on buying this because it doesn't look so good, I would suggest that you give it a shot because you won't regret it.",1202947200,,1097,4.179245283018868
2711787,5,B000LP5FXQ,"I can't say enough good things about this series, be it the animation, the writing, or the characters, it's all really quite moving.  Beyond the general good guys fighting the bad guys, this is a series about redemption and the struggle between one's self interest and the interest of others.  It's also touches upon the meaning of honor and the way in which each of the characters struggle to define themselves within it's confines.  It does all this with eye opening animation, beautiful music, and a great deal of humor. In addition, I'm a great fan of Akira Kurosawa and this series is a great tribute to his amazing films.",1202688000,,627,4.681818181818182
2711788,5,B000LP5FXQ,"I have never viewed this series before.  I decided to venture into the world of samurai, and codes of honor.  Let me be the first to say that this episode truly hits the mark when it comes to intrigue.  I am a huge fan of anime that is full of action; knowledge of surroundings.  The action that takes place in the episode is what I have personally been searching for; not to mention the content.  In conclusion, what else can be said?  I absolutely love the episode.",1200614400,5,467,4.310344827586207
2711789,4,B000LP5FXQ,"From what I had heard about this, my hopes were pretty high. I would say that they were, for the most part, met. I really do like the fact that they didn't skip out on parts of the story. There was an issue about the capital, that they would talk about throughout and, towards the end, they addressed it. Most series would have skipped something like this, or added it to the ""big war,"" but they treated it as its own story. I liked that a lot. The end however, well, it wasn't suprising, and not what you would want to happen. The overall ""hero"" so to speak, emerges and its one of the samurai that you never really grow to like. The fact that the story tellers tried to make him ""grow"" into his part was just unbelievable to me, because of the amount of whining that he did throughout. The love interest was kind of wasted as well. This doesnt affect the story really, im just reviewing.

Overall, its a great story. I used a gift card that was given to me to buy it, and thus was half the price. I understand that there is a lot of work that goes into an anime production, but $80 + dollars is a lot, for me anyways. I did enjoy it though, and do recommend it to my friends.",1199750400,,1177,4.1173913043478265
2711790,2,B000LP5FXQ,"As a fan of samurai movies, anime and having watched the original 7 samurai, this movie was mildly entertaining.  The story line was decent but aside from the character development, I found it quite empty.  An annoying kid, and a bumbling fake samurai (at least the original was somewhat competent) distracted from the already quite shaky adaptation. In my opinion, it is interesting to see where the characters go and how their pasts and paths unfold but not something I plan on watching again anytime soon.",1199577600,4,508,4.895348837209302
2711791,5,B000LP5FXQ,"After the first episode, I was hooked.  The story was very well done, and the characters were fascinating to watch.  I know someone else mentioned that there wasn't much character development throughout Samurai 7.  I won't lie, five out of the seven samurai stay fairly the same throughout the anime.  Fortunately their characters were interesting enough to last without becoming tedious or predictable.  The other two samurai do progress, though, as well as the main heroine.  The art was very good and I loved the musical score.  I strongly recommend this series for its plot and fabulous characters.",1198368000,,602,5.081632653061225
2711792,5,B000LP5FXQ,"This is one of the best tribute to Kurosawa and is 7 samurais.
The original movie makes it a great starting point.
For those who love the mixing up of futuristic and feodal times, this is also a great buy.
This is well drawn, good plot, great universe and great characters.

Overall on of the future classic.",1196467200,,308,4.4035087719298245
2711793,3,B000LP5FXQ,"First, you cannot compare this to Seven Samurai (which is one of the greatest movies ever made - in the top 3 for me).

Studio Gonzo certainly knows how to draw BIG stuff and some of the floating castles and mecha are amazingly beautiful, especially as they crash into the earth.  The world vision offered by Samurai 7 is intriguing - a mixture of old and new - where men with swords are able to cut down giant mecha.  The social and political situation is also quite fascinating - a ruthlessly maintained order kept by groups only interested in their selfish needs.  The characters are nicely done for the most part (although, by now, some are quite cliche) - the samurai are very likeable and heroic - each offering something different to the team.

And considering that I really enjoy Samurai and Mecha, I really went into this series thinking it would be great.  So what went wrong?

The story line does follow the movie's plot (in a disjointed and very different stylistic way - I liked it) but, the later episodes go on to a new storyline which felt like a filler plot.  While the first part is somewhat satisfactory and intriguing, the latter became almost unwatchable to me.  Perhaps the ridiculousness of the story started to get to me, or maybe the likability of the characters began to wane and it just seemed to drag on.  Perhaps I got sick of the over-whining of the ""victims"" and wished they'd just do something about it. Maybe I got tired of all the preachy talking or the cliche bad guys and convenient plot twists*.

It's still decent, but in my opinion, it's about 8 episodes too long and I don't think this warrants a 5 star rating.

* The most egregious plot twists involve the Emperor, but I don't want to include any spoilers.  Just that when they happen (a discovery and a betrayal), it was very underwhelming.",1194566400,5,1833,4.551829268292683
2711794,5,B000LP5FXQ,I really liked this series. It was a bit violent and sad at times but overall a must see for the anime fan.,1192147200,,107,3.6956521739130435
2711795,5,B000LP5FXQ,"I just want to say that you can't compare this to Kurosawa's masterpiece because it's just never going to be on that level. It's best to watch this as its own piece and judge how it does on its own.

This is a great epic series that is visually stunning. The art is clean and fluid, the story is believable, and the characters are memorable. I especially loved that it wasn't ""noble heroes protecting completely innocent villagers"" like many other series. No one is truly good or innocent and you see that humans are prone to the same faults, no matter what time period they're in.

My only gripe with this series is all the recapping. After you cut out the recaps and previews for the next episode, you're left with only about 19 minutes of real story.

This is a great series that is worthy of owning, and if you like samurai, mecha, fighting, or even just a great story, definitely check it out. I also recommend anyone who liked this to watch Last Exile or Wolf's Rain, two other great series.",1191715200,4,997,4.437158469945355

2711797,5,B000LP5FXQ,"Solid, meaningful, worthwhile, must see... I can't think of any other way to describe it.

Our world is filled with those who KNOW what is right (but don't do it) and those who DO what is right...

This work reminds me a lot of (sorry I know there is a LOT of buzz, but clearly this is true) Frank Millers 300.

Just like the Spartans of pre-Greece fame the Samurai of Samurai 7 were the guys who did the right thing even when the odds were stacked in favor of the house.

It just goes to show you that themes of right and wrong transcend cultures.

Money well spent.",1178236800,6,567,4.165137614678899
2711798,4,B000LP5FXQ,"Absolutely, Akira Kurosawa's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seven-Samurai-Criterion-Collection-3-Disc-Remastered-Edition/dp/B000G8NXYG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seven Samurai - Criterion Collection - 3-Disc Remastered Edition</a>&nbsp;is one of the great films of all time, and, in attempting a remake, one would require a hefty set of balls, as well as ample funding and talent. In 2004, with the approval of Akira Kurosawa's estate, a top notch anime version, SAMURAI 7, was created and debuted on Japanese television. In SAMURAI 7 - THE COMPLETE SERIES, we get the entire series, consisting of 26 episodes on 7 discs. SAMURAI 7 takes Akira Kurosawa's original masterpiece and transports it from the 16th century to a war ravaged, sci-fi future setting. However, the tweaked storyline still chronicles the tale of seven samurai who come to the aid of a tormented farming village that has been subjugated by bandits; this time, however, the bandits are the Nobuseri, mechanically-integrated predators who themselves were once samurai.

You don't need to have seen the 1954 film to enjoy SAMURAI 7, though viewers of both will make rapid connections between the two. The makers of this anime did a great job of instilling into their project the same heart and intent of the original SEVEN SAMURAI. This isn't just a meaningless point A to point B anime action flick. Emphasis is thoughtfully placed on character and plot development as we actually get to know the players in this series, from the ragtag samurai, which the last great war has largely reduced to a jobless and purposeless state, to the lowly farmers, who are insular, abhor fighting, and fear the samurai almost as much as the bandits.

Although palpable throughout the series, it's in the samurai's stay at the Kanna village where the distinction between the two social classes become most pronounced as the bushido code clashes with the villager's less ""noble"" but infinitely more realistic principles. The bridge between the two castes lies in the form of Kikuchiyo, the boorish but exuberant mechanical samurai who used to be a farmer; this was the role originated by the great Toshiro Mifune. Don't get me wrong, this animated Kikuchiyo version doesn't even come close to bringing to the table what Mifune did. It just underscores how bigger than life Mifune made his character that this incarnation actually had to be in a mechanical shell to halfway compete. Honestly, Kikuchiyo here is adequate and, at times, nerve grating.

But there comes a time when plot and character development must give way to serious hind kicking. And, in these moments, the samurai do NOT mess around. The action scenes are astounding! You almost believe a regular-sized guy can take out a mechagiant. These key sequences are significantly emphasized by the blood-pumping score, which uses a healthy dose of Japanese taiko drums. The animation is very, very nice to look at, even if, at times, the CG doesn't quite harmonize with the 2-d animation.

By the way, this thick box set also comes with 7 booklets with interviews and production art. Special features of note are: weird animated shorts of ""Mr. Stain on Junk Alley"" on discs 2, 3, and 4; relaxed commentary by the Voice Director & several voice actors on disc 4; and character profiles and image galleries on several discs.

Along with the sci-fi trappings, there are a few other significant changes that were made from Kurosawa's original film. There's a more impactful role played by the love interest Kirara the water priestess, as well as the introduction of her younger sister Komachi, who, along with Kikuchiyo, serves as comedy relief (Kirara and Komachi, by the way, are also Japanese brands of rice). Another change made is that, here, the samurai actually take the battle beyond the village bandits. But, listen, even with the sci-fi elements, the cool animation, the awesome battle scenes, I feel that the best thing about SAMURAI 7 is that it somehow retains the humanity of the original film. This really is anime for grown ups. The ending is still appropriately bittersweet as, ultimately, it's the villagers who win. There will always be harvests and harvest songs for the farmers. The samurai, on the other hand, just drift away. And the samurai leader, Shimada Kambei, who claims to have lost every war he's been in, has just lost another one...",1176595200,22,4416,5.205344585091421
