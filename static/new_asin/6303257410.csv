611878,5,6303257410,"Of course, Dance With Me, Henry (1956) was Abbott & Costello's final film together, but this very rare picture featuring Lou Costello is a collector's must have. Although the script is choppy and well, goofy, that's precisely why it makes it extra special. A spoof of Attack of the 50 ft Woman and other ""giant"" films of the 50s, Lou plays Artie Pinsetter, garbage collector--and genius inventor. He creates a sort of computer (with his own voice) that makes him super-powerful. With a simple command in what looks like a walkie talkie, he can fly, travel through time and more. Rather than another cookie-cutter cornball movie, this is Costello's most imaginative film, and the only movie he ever appeared in filmed in widescreen (""Wonderama"" which is simply widescreen Panavision.) Available for the 1st time ever in the 1990s on VHS, this is the 1st time ever released in it's original widescreen format. The picture, soundtrack is crystal clear and nice packaging by Columbia Pictures. The company that is mastering these rarities through various big studios deserved the highest rating because of the top quality of the discs produced. So Lou Costello left us one last gem, which probably would have been a series of features had he lived. He died before the movie was released the same year. If you like A&C or rare films, this is a must! A+++++",1340668800,,1351,4.878260869565217

  Plot Summary:

 Lou Costello made his only film appearance without Bud Abbott in ""THE 30 FOOT BRIDE OF CANDY ROCK"". Lou plays a bumbling junk dealer who fancies himself a great inventor. One of his creations transforms his girlfriend Dorthory Provine into a towering giant! The subsequent shenanigans involve Lou, the humongous Ms. Provine, her bombstatic uncle Gale Gordon, and the entire US Army. Before Dorthory can be returned to normal size again, Lou's invention transmogrifies into a time machine and rocketsip.

 Trivia (from imdb.com): This was Lou Costello's last film, and his only starring role without Bud Abbott. It wasn't released until about five months afer Costello's death. Lou died of a heart attack on March 3, 1959.",1145059200,5,2133,6.642585551330798
611963,5,6303257410,"This 1959 sci-fi comedy classic is funny and charming, but this was Lou Costello's final film before his life came to an end on March 1959 and the film THE 30 FOOT BRIDE OF CANDY ROCK would not be released in theaters until August 6, 1959. The movie goers of 1959 learned how to appreciate, about Lou making a film that he wanted without the Abbott & Costello icon. I'm sure the people of 1959 enjoyed Lou Costello's last performance and with his costar Dorothy Provine (IT'S A MAD MAD MAD MAD WORLD), I bet Dorothy enjoyed working with Lou Costello as she was the 30 foot bride while Lou was right by her side and saying, YOU'RE MINE! ALL MINE! AND YOU ARE BEAUTY! This is not a bad movie at all, it's just that Lou wanted a chance to make a film that he thought audiances can enjoy his acting career all by himself, but I wish this was not his final film, I wish he was still alive to see the 21th century, now he is in our hearts, WE ALL LOVE YOU LOU COSTELLO, GOOD-BYE. He is sitting in a 1959 white/pink Cadillac smiling and waving his hand at us all as the 59 Cadillac car takes him up to heave. Your fan DUSTIN JAMES GRIFFITH",1408752000,,1132,4.15
611964,4,6303257410,"Ironically, something of a bittersweet treat. Lou Costello's only movie without Bud, and it was his last. He passed away not long after filming, and the movie was actually released posthumously. I've seen this called a parody of the genre, but I'm not sure if it should be called a parody or just a comedy treatment of it. At one point, when Bride Emmy Lou has gone too far the other way and shrunk down to unseeable, Lou exclaims ""That's incredible!"" -- a reference to ""The Incredible Shrinking Man."" The movie itself of course is in the manner of The Amazing Colossal Man and Attack of the 50 Foot Woman. The inimitable Gale Gordon more or less stands in for Abbott (although he is VERY much the same as his hallmark character, Mr. Mooney. He's even a banker!) They work together very well, and I find myself wishing they could have done more together. The downside -- Lou does look rather old and tired, and he does not quite match the character, who seems to be an ambitious young man -- especially if the age of his 30' wife is a clue. Some of it is quite silly, even for him. However, some of it is quite sweet, and some of the supporting cast are terrific. A couple scenes are a bit risque for the day: when Lou explains to Gale that his niece has ""gotten big"", Gale completely misunderstands his meaning and orders a wedding to take place at once! Later that evening, after the wedding, 30 foot tall Emmy Lou stretches out full length on the ground and says it's time to get to sleep  . . . Lou's wordless reaction is priceless! That scene alone makes up for a lot of the rest here. Yes, put this on the ""must watch"" list too, if only to see Lou Costello in his last days.",1408752000,3,1680,4.3164556962025316

611967,4,6303257410,"I have been a major fan of Bud and Lou since I was a teenager.  It is very saddening that this was Lou's last film and he never got to see it.  He died two months before it came out.  Although not one of his best, he does prove here and in the ""Wagon Train"" episode he made six months earlier, that he can hold his own without the help of Bud.  I am very happy to have this film in my collection.  It is in great condition as well.",1399248000,,431,3.7444444444444445
611968,3,6303257410,"My elementary school often showed this movie as a treat for its students during the 1960's holiday seasons.  I never could remember the name of the film until I received help from the people at namethatmovie.org.  Low and behold, Amazon had it available to stream, and watching it, I was excited to see bits and pieces that I remembered from long ago.  Unfortunately for this film, my tastes and expectations have matured quite a bit over the years and this movie didn't stand up to my own improvements.  Lou Costello was really miscast as the protagonist; he was much too old and desperate for the part.  Additionally, the plot was weak and full of holes, not unexpected in a B-type movie.  Despite all the problems with the movie I still gave it three stars since in this case, the power of nostalgia mitigates the problems of quality.",1384646400,,837,4.659863945578231

611971,5,6303257410,"at some point during their infamous feud, Jack Benny compared his semi-friendly rival Fred Allen to Abbott without Costello. no offense to Bud Abbott, a thoroughly on-the-dime straight man who contributed as much to the act as did Lou Costello (as does any comedian's straight man, really), but it does sound rather bland doesn't it?
as opposed to Costello without Abbott?
much has been made of this film and it's affect on it's erstwhile star, because (a) it was his one outing without Bud Abbott, and (b) it turned out to be a posthumous release. it ""killed him,"" some say. and of course, like anyone's last hurrah, there are inevitably those who'll insist it must mean the magic has dissipated. people frequently, for instance, see a tv series ending it's run and assume the series doesn't ""have it"" anymore. it never occurs to the average person that it might've been a lousy timeslot, for instance, or maybe the fad has simply run it's course.
i'm not qualified to give a definitive answer here. all i'm in any position to say is that i enjoyed this film a lot more than i expected to. as an admirer of Lou Costello's, i was sure i would appreciate the effort, but certainly wasn't expecting the level of whimsical fun i encountered. it's no ABBOTT & COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN by any stretch, but it's as much good fun as, say, IN SOCIETY or THE WISTFUL WIDOW OF WAGON GAP.
as for the most obvious complication, the straight man role so expertly handled for so long by Abbott is here filled by the marvelous Gale Gordon. Gordon handles the role equally well in his own way with his legendary ""slow burn"" technique. the result may not have precisely the rhythm or nature of Abbott & Costello, but ""Gordon & Costello"" has it's own magic in it's own way.
the plot is a parody of contemporary sci-fi trends, with particular emphasis on ATTACK OF THE 50 FOOT WOMAN. Costello is Artie Pinsetter, a small-town rubbish collector who fancies himself  a great scientist and so spends most of his spare time ""tinkering."" (sort of a prototype for Fred MacMurray's absent-minded professor.) Gordon is ""Uncle"" Raven Rossiter, the despotic owner of, well, pretty much everything in Candy Rock. he's on his best behavior just at the moment because he has political aspirations and his routine is being chronicled by a television reporter. one shudders to think what he's like when he doesn't have to control himself.
the bride in question, Uncle Raven's literal niece, is played by one Dorothy Provine, whom i'm afraid i don't know much about. the only other film she was in to which i can attest is Blake Edwards' THE GREAT RACE, with Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon. she's pretty and charming enough, but well, she never did become a household name, did she?
the film works, as far as it does, for the simple reason that it plays to Lou Costello's strengths. despite how sick he must've been he exudes the same energy as ever. what's more, despite looking every second of his nearly 60 years, he still feels like the semi-little boy he'd always been. his relationship with Provine (who must've been at least 35 years his junior) could've been just plain creepy in so many other hands.
like most of Lou's collaborations with his ex-partner, CANDY ROCK is about fun, not logic. the bride is enlarged because she enters a cave, the implication being that there's some mystical sort of scientifically unclassified gas in there. Lou's partner in his scientist efforts is a computer called Max, and it is from Max that the liberties with the laws of physics tend to emanate. Max can transport a landscape and it's occupants back in time, for instance, which is both a help and hindrance when the Army comes around to deal with the ""giant girl."" and it is of course Max who finally figured out how to reduce Miss Provine back to normal size. with some trial and error, of course.
i can't say if every Abbott & Costello fan will find the same pleasant diversion i did. i'm sure there are those who'll say the loss of Abbott neutralizes Costello's talents. it's true that it won't be quite what they're used to, but does that make it invalid?",1371513600,6,4121,4.676308539944904
