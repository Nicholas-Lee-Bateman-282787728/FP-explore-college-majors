4715786,5,B005K8RJ2E,"This has to be one of the funniest anime series I've watched. It also has a lot of heart and great characters. Part 1 is definitely a requirement! If you can find the series in one collection, even better!",1404691200,,205,4.282051282051282
4715787,5,B005K8RJ2E,"This is part 2 and contains the last 6 episodes of the first season.

The story continues to follow Squid Girl and her friends at a summer beach house and as she learns of what life is like on the surface world she instead of invading it she learns about friendship.

If you have the first part you need this part to compute the set.

I wish that the series was complete in one box set instead of having to buy both parts.",1392163200,,422,4.0602409638554215
4715788,5,B005K8RJ2E,"Id like to imagine that squid girl is the result of the dark lord Cthulhu rising up out of the oceanic depths from the city of Rlyeh to seduce and impregnate an eco friendly valley girl.

And that the child of this unholy union would one day rise up out of the sea herself to lay claim to a Japanese seaside restaurant as her base of operations to conquer all the surface dwellers for foolishly polluting the oceans.

While Id consider the squid girl series a show written to appeal more to kids than adults I found that the whimsical characters and story won me over. Maybe its the Lovecraft fan boy in me or maybe its squid girls constant aquatic puns!",1387152000,,654,4.352459016393443
4715789,2,B005K8RJ2E,"There's no denying how much I loved Ika Musume while it aired in Japan. I watched every episode each weak, hungrily anticipating the next. The humor in this series is great, the animation is well done and it all comes together to create a zany, fun and hilarious spectacle.

Where did they go wrong? Well... licensing it. That's where.

I'm rather sick of the old argument of ruining things once they hit mainstream, or how dubs ruin anime. While both of these things are evident in entertainment- it's not law. Squid Girl is a great series, so buy it even if you just want to watch the Japanese version, but DO beware.

The box is where we'll start. How cheap can companies get? I mean, I understand every series won't get a cardboard box casing the DVD box, but this series deserved it! BUT- even past that, the DVD case this thing comes in is cheap! I do appreciate the series being split into only two releases- both having two discs each to total 4 discs within only two purchases. However, I do NOT appreciate cheap boxes with a spindle on each side of the case that can BARELY hold the disc! I sent back TWO of these DVD sets JUST to get one that hadn't fallen out and rattled around inside the case while shipping.

There's not a single flyer, booklet or anything in the case. Just two discs that might fall out.
The DVD extras are plain, boring and barely even there.
The menus are cheaply done up, nothing is animated.
And finally... the dub is incredibly bad.

Overall, the series is amazing- but the product purely sucks.",1346803200,5,1533,4.460714285714285
4715790,5,B005K8RJ2E,"A funny series for all ages, and rather strange but in a good way.  I just wish there were more.",1327881600,3,96,3.8
4715791,5,B005K8RJ2E,"All right. I have yet to watch the second half of this show, but I'm certain it will continue in a similar fashion to the first half. I wanted to chime in here for the sake of those who were let down by the poor case choice of the first Squid Girl DVD release. After the delayed release for part two it looks as though Media Blasters has remedied the awful disc fastener issue that was rampant in the last release. The new case design holds the discs in firm and I have had no issues with it at all.

For those of you who will be happy with the DVD version, I want to say pick up this edition, as you won't be disappointed. I will personally be looking forward to the Blu-ray version that will be releasing scheduled for March since I love Blu-rays and I am always looking for the highest quality product. So if you're looking to get the Blu-ray set, you might want to save your money for that set once it's released. I fully intend to give the DVD sets to a friend so that the discs can see some good use and so they enjoy this show as much as I have.",1323907200,4,1052,4.033492822966507
