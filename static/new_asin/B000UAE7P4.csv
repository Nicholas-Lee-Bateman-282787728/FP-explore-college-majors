2917490,4,B000UAE7P4,I found the Christmas Miracle of Jonathan Toomey to be a very heartwarming story.  I will watch it many times.,1197417600,,110,4.5
2917491,5,B000UAE7P4,"The Christmas Miracle of Jonathan Toomey is a beautiful rendition which stays true to the spirit and story of the book -- which doesn't always happen when stories are translated from one medium to another.  There are a few slight differences which do not detract from the story in any way:
--- in the book, the creche belonged to the widow, and had been carved by her grandfather.
--- in the movie, it was given to Thomas by his father, who dies in the war.

Another difference is in the book, we never learn how the widow ""got"" that way, in the movie there is some backstory development showing the father in uniform heading off to war, etc.

What is the same is that its a story of kindness, love and miracles.  Time spent with either version of this story will be time well spent.",1196899200,81,783,4.379310344827586
2917492,5,B000UAE7P4,I watched this movie as soon as I got it and loved it. I collect Christmas movies and I had never heard of this one. I bought it and loved it and will share so other people can enjoy it. thanks,1195776000,42,193,3.731707317073171

2917505,5,B000UAE7P4,"A lovely unassuming story that catches you when you least expect it. Tears were flowing freely by the end! I loved that this wasn't your typical romantic Christmas movie, as so many Christmas movies are, but rather about the kind of love that embodies the Savior. The giving and forgiving kind. It was wonderful!",1514505600,,312,4.796296296296297

2917507,4,B000UAE7P4,"I really had to force myself to watch this movie because I didn't think I would like it. A few weeks back I watched the Christmas Candle and was very disappointed with it. So I'm glad I pushed myself to watch The Christmas Miracle of Jonathan Toomey. The premise of this film is a familiar one--a grouchy guy who's really just a wounded soul; a young kid in need of a father figure--I even found myself thinking: ""Oh brother, here we go again!"" So what makes this film unique? I would say, a good dose of subtlety that keeps it from becoming syrupy. The director and the actors manage to keep a good balance. There's even a bit of humor which, for me, helped to keep it fresh. The scenery, the colors, it's all very pretty. It was obviously filmed in a studio which normally I would say wouldn't work for me, but in this movie it does work. It adds a sense of magic, as if we are in a fairy tale world with all of the possibilities of that world. The directing was fine as well. The acting is good. The young boy did a great job; not overly cute or annoyingly precocious. Joely Richardson is lovely as the caring but melancholy mother. The ending was abrupt for me. I was not expecting it to end when it did, but again, this turned out to be a good thing because it avoids the usual formulaic sentimental angle. Plus it is completely clean, not one curse word. Amazing! Unfortunately, there are no subtitles which, even though I'm not hearing impaired, I usually like to use because there's always some dialogue in a movie that is hard to hear. But I didn't have any trouble hearing the actors in this movie. Overall, a nice effort from everyone involved.",1513900800,2,1655,4.376623376623376

2917604,5,B000UAE7P4,"I bought my son the book from our library sale. I thought it was such a beautiful, tender story. Though a romance, it was told without frills, in simple language that children can understand and appreciate. I remember thinking what a wonderful movie this book would make. Lo and behold, I found the movie here on Amazon! (Is there not anything you can find here?)
The movie is well-made and very inspiring. Like the book, it does not rely on sentimentality; the story remains true to the book and is told in a straightforward, honest manner. The characters are fully fleshed out and real; you find yourself getting very involved with the characters. I highly recommend this movie for wholesome family viewing. There aren't many movies that fit this category, but this one does. It's a perfect holiday tradition!",1433030400,,811,4.841726618705036

The director also tried to hard to have a lot of bright backlit scenes in the forest - as if the forest was to be enchanted or something.  The actors mostly phoned in their performances.  There were too many sidebar backflashes added that were not in the book and they seemed more like filler material rather than help advance the story.",1390176000,,474,4.476744186046512

It seems to me that the director had a 'niceness' template that they expected the actors to work within. As a result, the sincerity and depth of emotion that the story calls for is simply not there. The characters are not real. And for those of you that are attracted to Tom Berenger, he is almost unrecognisable under the beard and hair.",1385251200,2,503,4.419354838709677

2917780,5,B000UAE7P4,"We first watched this movie a couple of years ago and just recently watched it the other night. I'd forgotten what a delightful movie it is!

Based on the book by Susan Wojciechowski, ""The Christmas Miracle of Jonathan Toomey"" is a movie of the value of family and of new beginnings. Thomas has recently lost his father in the War. When he and his mother move to the country from their upscale city home, Thomas finds it difficult to adjust.  How will he ever survive without his father? And to make matters worse, Thomas accidentally left the beautiful Nativity Scene figurines at the train stop. Figurines that are a reminder of the Christmases past with his father.

Jonathan Toomey is no stranger to grief. Having lost his wife and child, he shuts himself out from the world, and instead is content to hide behind the doors of his rented cabin carving items to sell at the local shop. Some of the children in town mock him including calling him ""Gloomy Toomey"" and throw pebbles at his home. Rumors abound when the children make up stories about just what it is that Mr. Toomey does.

When the paths of Thomas, his mother, and Mr. Toomey cross, lives change. Can those who have lost the most find true happiness again?

This is a wonderful movie with themes of not judging others (Luke 6:37; Matthew 7:1), caring for those less fortunate , and doing to others as you would have done to you (Matthew 7:12). It is a story of healing with some humor dabbled in and some refreshing scenes about the importance of family. It's a film you'll want to add to your annual Christmas collection.

This movie contains nothing objectionable, and I would highly recommend ""The Christmas Miracle of Jonathan Toomey"" for all ages.

2917807,4,B000UAE7P4,"We all loved this movie, as we are so tired of all of the silly stuff that is put out there for Christmas time.
The story is taken from a well loved book. Tom Berenger does a fine job portraying a recluse who is a woodcarver. He is rather ill tempered but we never know why some people are like this and what has happened in their lives to make them so. A young boy and his mother move to a new town and there are difficulties for them as they are new. Finally they get to meet the woodcarver as the mother wants to replace the son's nativity scene  which was lost during their move. The original set was given to him by his father who had since passed away. It shows how love and patience will work and it can restore a person from their sad past.",1327881600,2,748,4.02013422818792
2917808,5,B000UAE7P4,I have loved this book since the first year it was printed. To find a movie of such a beloved book that did it justice is a truly an amazing event.

2917841,5,B000UAE7P4,"Finally!  After watching so many movies where the families portrayed constantly fight/nag/tease each other cruelly (if not relentlessly) during the holidays we have a film that delivers loving acts of service and kindnesses!  What a relief!  I thought it had good messages for everyone about love and tenderness, of coping with loss and sacrifice, and of accepting others in spite of differences.  I appreciated that in this film they showed how the character Jonathan Toomey refused to be cruel at one point despite the peer pressure.  It was wonderful to be able to watch a movie clean of sarcastic wit that's written just for the sake of a laugh at someone elses expense.",1309564800,,674,4.929203539823009
2917842,5,B000UAE7P4,"This is a wonderful adaptation of the book.  I've had the book for a long time and then saw the DVD offered, and was curious.  It's a sweet story and I would recommend it for anyone, not just for families.",1297296000,,205,4.1
2917843,5,B000UAE7P4,"I first heard this story at  a Christmas Eve story at my wife to be's church right after we got married.  I bought a copy of the book and my family has enjoyed it since.  I didn't know there was a movie adaptation, so when I found out about it, we snapped it up.

We enjoyed the movie version very much.  I wonder an outfit like ""The Hallmark Channel"" didn't pick this up since this story would be right up their alley.  Those that lovethe book and see the movie will note some differences.  The first was the ending.  In in the book, it's implied that Mr Toomey and the widow and Thomas will become a family while that is not as evident in the movie.  Also the movie had a bigger cast of characters and a back story about how Thomas' Dad died.  The book focused on three people while movie fleshed out the story.  Whether that adds to or takes away from the stroy is up to the individual.

A previous reviewer felt the ""miracle"" was not really there since Jonathan did not seem to have a more evident spiritual awakending.  While his points are well taken, I respectfully disagree.  I think the ""miracle"", was that when faced with a ""crisis"" (finishing the nativity),the memories of his wife and son finally enable Jonathan to put aside the grief and loneliness  he felt and end his isolation and enable him to rejoin the world around him.  That is a miracle in itself, wouldn't you agree?",1293840000,,1390,4.37109375
2917844,5,B000UAE7P4,This is one of our favorite Christmas stories.  The main actors capture the characters from the story well.  The poignancy and transformation in the book come through in the movie.,1265846400,,180,4.966666666666667
2917845,5,B000UAE7P4,"An excellent family Christmas film.  The ""judge not that ye be not judged"" principle is very evident, also a touching storyline involving the simple youthful perspective of right and wrong.",1263686400,,189,5.3
2917846,1,B000UAE7P4,"This movie was BAD.  Leonard Pinth-Garnell bad.  I had to eject it after forty-five minutes.  The acting was dreadful!  In fact, everything about the movie was dreadful.",1261699200,,169,5.148148148148148
2917847,5,B000UAE7P4,Wonderful story.,1234137600,,16,7.5
2917848,3,B000UAE7P4,"The movie arrived in a timely fashion and in good condition.  The movie itself was not as great as some of the reviews indicated.  First, Jonathan's ""miracle"" was not much of one.  There is an implication that he went to church, but there is no personal confession of faith from his lips and neither does he repent for his lack of trust of God or the time He has spent disobeying him by keeping to himself without serving Him and forsaking the assembling together of the saints as the book of Hebrews forbids.  The end is abrupt and leaves you feeling a bit unfulfilled, as if something more of a summation or conclusion was wanting.

Also, the son's bad attitude is not really dealt with much.  The mother and son presumably have faith in God since the nativity set was so important to them, but there is not much evidence of same in how they act and interact throughout the movie.

Over all, the movie is family friendly, but I'd say some discernment should be used when watching with your kiddos and some poignant questions would be appropriate afterward to address what is wrong both spiritually, theologically and behaviorally.  For example, ""What should Mr. Toomey have done in response to losing his wife and child?"" and ""What comfort could the boy's mother have taken and given to her son in light of what happened?""",1231200000,7,1324,4.628205128205129

2917870,4,B000UAE7P4,"I really enjoyed this movie.  A hermit, unfriendly man with an amazing talent for wood carving is portrayed in this movie.  A young widow and her young son contract this hermit (Toomey) to make a nativity set for them.  It shows of a developing of relationship with this man with a mysterious past.  The one thing I didn't like was they never showed what his mysterious past was, only hinted at it.

This story has wonderful character, a slower paced time with a family who views Christmas as truly special, despite very hard circumstances.  It talks about the value of silence and other traits that are somewhat foreign to our modern culture.

This is a different type of Christmas movie that is a joy to savor and reflect upon.",1228262400,3,729,4.604651162790698
2917871,5,B000UAE7P4,"Looking for something a little different to warm your heart this holiday season? Tom Beringer and Jolie Richardson deliver rich performances in a lovely, although at times somber, tale.  The sets and filming are artistically done creating a gauzey feel enhancing the beauty and depth of the film.  Although you will no doubt catch yourself smiling a few times during certain scenes, I wouldn't call ""The Christmas Miracle of Jonathan Toomey"" typical lighthearted holiday fare; however, if you enjoy a little warmth, beauty, and ""Silent Night"" mixed in with all the ""Jingle Bells"", Madison Avenue and excitement of the holidays, ""The Christmas Miracle of Jonathan Toomey"" may be a touching, classy answer.

2917876,3,B000UAE7P4,"This was a very good family friendly movie. There were some excellent lessons about ridiculing people who are different, recovering from deep losses and respecting others.

It is all about relationships and how deep personal losses don't have to destroy your life. There was some cute dialogue between the little boy and Jonathan Toomey as the new nativity set was carved.

This is not the Bourne Identity, so don't expect fast paced action. This is more about human beings than car crashes and pyrotechnics.

The only reason I didn't give it a better review is that there could have been more chemistry with the actors. The emotions were a little flat, so it is not as good as it could have been.",1202515200,4,697,4.69672131147541

Note:  In my opinion there are not too many real good Christmas movies around.  ""Christmas at Plum Creek"" (Little House on the Prairie) and ""It's a Wonderful Life"" are probably among the best. ""Christmas Miracle"" then is among the top 10.",1199232000,,551,4.405940594059406

2917908,4,B000UAE7P4,"Whereas I might not use this term so often to refer to a movie I will now in writing that this Christmas film is warm, actually in many ways:  The musical score has a fullness and soul that immediately welcomes you into the story; the colors and set designs are literally ""earthy"" and gorgeous as the mother and boy take many walks through the forest to arrive at Mr. Toomey's home; the importance of silence (as Mr. Toomey advocates often to the boy) allows the viewer to think and feel to greater depths than your average splice and cut/edited movie.

The acting is solid, especially behind Tom Berenger in an anticipated role-departure from the likes of ""Platoon"" or ""Sniper"".  He plays the grieving, not-quite-living recluse of the film's title...and to see him slowly come out of his shell behind the gentle presence and love of the mother and son is very touching, to say the least.  And this brings me to my one critique of the film: the final opening up of Mr. Toomey is so dramatically quick (even the back of the DVD case shows Mr. Toomey singing in church next to the mother and son...did I miss that?  I don't think so).  It WOULD have been nice to see that scene as part of the re-awakening of Mr. Toomey; why wasn't that in the picture?  My point is that the film beautifully depicts the depressed woodworker slowly but surely rising out of his soulful cave only to kind of burst out at the end...suddenly he's coming out of church and the mother suddenly sees him??  A suggestion: Why not have a quick clip of him perhaps shyly entering the worship service and people being surprised and warmly accepting him there?  Why not a little more transition to fill out the viewing experience ""with"" the characters in the story?  The magic of the previous 1 hour and 20 minutes came up too quick and short.  To that end I was disappointed and left wanting....to be even more touched by Mr. Toomey's transformation.  Alas, that did not ruin the film.

No one told me of this film, I just happened upon it while I was cruising through Amazon.  What a good, good find.  A probable annual Christmas tradition of viewing for years to come.  Highly Recommended.",1198022400,66,2162,4.562176165803109
