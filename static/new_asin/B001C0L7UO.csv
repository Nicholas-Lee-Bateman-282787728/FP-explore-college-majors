8285455,1,B001C0L7UO,"This was single-handedly (no pun intended) the most painful nonsense I've ever sat half-way through, and I have a high tolerance for the ridiculous. Ten minutes into it and your hand is reaching for the remote, but it's so mind-numbingly awful fast-forwarding doesn't help. There's no plot (which suits me fine), the acting's absurd, the actors and actresses harsh on your eyes, the prints are washed out AND the sex is simulated - no redeeming value whatsoever, not even for a few ""this is so bad it's funny"" laughs. You'll wanna kill yourself before it's over - you've been dutifully warned...",1275868800,,595,4.900990099009901
8285456,2,B001C0L7UO,"I do have many of the movies released by After Hours Cinema.  I am a huge fan of Grindhouse and the likes.  This disc set is the only one that i have received that was censured.  There is pixalation over several of the nude/sex scenes.  This is very annoying.

I actually contacted the distributor to complain and was told that I was not the only one that was upset.  This was the only disc set that they have ever censured and will not do again.

Great movies, well, for the lovers of this type of films.  These are not really grindhouse, but fun 1970's trash films.

Just a warning to the purist, like myself.",1245196800,6,611,4.2894736842105265
