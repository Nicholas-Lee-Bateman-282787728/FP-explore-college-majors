1333339,4,B00003UC5N,"Kusturica began focusing on the Roma culture most prominently in his movie, ""Time of the Gypsies,""  revisiting this theme in later works either indirectly (""Arizona Dream"") or with unabashed  flirtation (""Underground""). In ""Black Cat, White Cat,""  these talented musicians are center stage, and you won't take your eyes off  them from the time they are tied up in a tree until they march off with  their infectious brass beat in the sunset.
The plot follows a young Roma  who falls for the village tomboy, but is promised to marry a lovely, albeit  height-impaired, ganster's daughter as a result of a poker game. The young  couple attempts to circumvent this arrangement by slipping away from their  fate much like the silver fish in ""Arizona Dreams."" The  high-charged get-me-out-of-here wedding scene is driven by the gypsy music  which feeds the young couple's desperation, the ganster's testosterone  levels, and the guests' oblivion, all of which is done very tongue-in-cheek  by caricaturizing aspects of Balkan culture. If you like your humor black,  you'll dig this movie.",952819200,50,1081,5.209302325581396

1333390,5,B00003UC5N,"""Crna macka, beli macor"" to give it its original title is a work of pure genius. The plot is that Matko is a small time trader on the River Danube. He has a 17 year old son in the shape of Zare. Matko does a deal with a very unsavoury gangster Dadan who has a penchant for bling, nose candy and questionable songs.

Matko ends up oweing him money big time and by way of a bargain Matko agrees that his son will marry Dadans sister the improbably named Afrodita. What follows is a tale of criminals, love, gypsy music, more crims, loads of animals, lady shaving and a car eating pig to name but a few. This film is just mad and bonkers.

Director and writer Emir Kusturica is a visionary film maker and if you only ever see one of his films then make it this. The acting is wonderful, the comedy relentless, the ideas and imagination unparalleled and the animals are always a joy. This is cinema at its most glorious best, where it does new things in new ways and has a great big laugh at the same time. There are a couple of cats too just in case you were wondering  this is up there in my top ten films of all time  recommended till the cows, or even pigs, come home.",1450569600,,1168,4.13215859030837
1333411,4,B00003UC5N,"I wouldn't give this movie a bad rating because it is definitely funny and entertaining, but this is a poorly made film in pretty much every other respect. It has that cheesy old foreign film slapstick humor. The ending is so bad and the music becomes increasingly irritating throughout the film. The convenient happy ending is so dragged out, unrealistic and just badly put together. I appreciate the lighthearted intention of the movie but it's annoying how people in the comments section here are acting like it's such a ""masterpiece"". It's really more like ""one-of-a-kind"" but if you think this is a masterpiece, then just be honest that you like it for the fact that it's about a unique group of people, not that it's actually a well-made film.",1448150400,,749,4.813953488372093

1333488,5,B00003UC5N,"Apart from being these words another humbly homage to Casablanca, this film is a demolishing story, supported by an incisive script, but so well done and acted that becomes a true feats for your eyes under any point of view you may consider it.

After all, Federico Fellini has found his true younger artistic successor. Kusturica 's style is hyper kinetic, zealous, flamboyant, deliriously outrageous, permeated of fine irony and enrooted in the most loyal local humor.

A man good for nothing decides the time has come for renovating himself and finally to be a good man. After all, he has a son still to care, but he needs desperately money for participate in something big. On the road all kinds of specimens; his father and uncle, the astute vagrant, the Russian contrabandists will constitute the admirable frame in which this hilarious film will unfold.

You will see a true parade of reckless and very funny situations inside what you might call a surrealist journey. There is admirable winks to the mistake comedy with a smart resolution.

If you haven't dared to see it, it would be recommendable to acquire it. Kusturica shares honors - thanks a well sustained effort - with the great directors of the world.  Come to the particular micro cosmos of this irreverent filmmaker and enjoy it.",1140307200,2,1299,4.85972850678733

""Black Cat, White Cat"" - a highjacked trainload of fuel, a walking tree stump, a collapsing outhouse, and the dead come back to life. How could you not love this film!?

Why doesn't someone release this insane, inspired Kusturica film in Region 1??

It's wild, crazy, and filled with music and dancing and unforgettable characters (played by real actors and actresses, not Hollywood ken-and-barbie dolls). You either like this kind of thing, or you don't. Astoundingly, some don't. Go figure! For me, it's a joy to watch.

1333505,5,B00003UC5N,"The sublime goofiness of this movie is hard to describe; you really must see it for yourself.  But some of its virtues are:  it manages to be a classic farce, without ever seeming stylized; it showcases and celebrates the glorious music of the Rroma people in almost every frame, while keeping the convoluted narrative running; it presents even its densest, dopiest, kookiest and weirdest characters as full human beings, not stereotypes; and, not least, it presents a number of farm animals in juicy cameo roles (the car-eating pig ought to get some kind of ""Best Performance by a Barnyard Animal"" prize).  The title characters, for example, appear in almost every crucial scene, and end up making the happy ending possible.

Young lovers, lonely hearts, domineering grandparents, stupid con-artists, cokehead gangsters and flocks of geese make up the world of ""Black Cat, White Cat,"" always accompanied by torrents of music.

Living in Europe I had a chance to buy BC/WC (at last!) on a DVD - it's just a shame that American isolationism goes that far, that if a film was not made in Hollywood, or is not English spoken, or even hasn't got an Oscar - it's not worth publicity.

1333523,5,B00003UC5N,"One of the most purely entertaining and recommendable movies I have ever seen, ""Black Cat White Cat"" is a sensory overload.
Start with the stunning visuals.  The ramshackle, anarchic sets are as exotic as have ever been captured on film, somewhere in the same neighborhood as the bar in ""Star Wars,"" the villages in the Mad Max films, and the town from ""Welcome to Woop Woop"" (that last reference is probably more obscure that ""Black Cat White Cat"").
The relentless story set against that backdrop is as multifaceted, kinetic, and darkly comic as anything Quentin Tarantino has been associated with, albeit here everything is linear and easy to follow.  Not getting into the details -- although it would be fair to call this some sort of a gangster movie -- this film is loaded with storytelling cliches which thankfully breathe new life when set among the gypsies.  The plotlines weave together in a logical, satisfying way, although you probably won't catch onto just what all those plots are until late in the game.  And the whole time, Kusturica and company move things along with a sense of slapstick comic timing that harks back to the Marx Brothers.
The knockout punch -- indeed, the soul of ""Black Cat White Cat"" -- is the music.  The manic gypsy soundtrack shifts from sweet and melodic to crazed and bombastic, but always with enough of a smirking streak to maintain the film's air of goofy mischief.  This is a movie which stays coherent due to the sheer force of its own whimsy.  [A side note, since everybody who sees the movie will walk away humming this song:  ""Pit Bull,"" the soundtrack's only detour off of gypsy music, is an unlikely pop hit (it was huge in Europe, where people actually SAW this movie) but taken with the film's hilarious and memorable context, it works perfectly.  Not so on just the CD soundtrack, however; I found myself needing the disco gangster visual, letting me know that it was Kusturica's synthesis and not just the song that made the moment.]  Anyway, this is an excellent soundtrack that begs to be bought, but to the best of my knowledge and experience, it is impossible to find in the US (remember that next time you travel to Europe, and don't forget to look under ""Chat Noir Chat Blanc"").
All in all, this is a true gift of a movie, and for my money, a better introduction to Emir Kusturica than the more serious (but very good) ""Underground.""

I won't go too much into plot -- gangsters, romance, and a uproariously funny ending (and beginning, and middle), plus subtitles that are in a nice yellow so they're easy to read. The music score is great (I wish there was a soundtrack on CD) and the acting is excellent... I have seen two of Kusturica's other movies, and this is by far the best, although the others were very good too. You will not regret buying this movie, and I would recommend it to anyone!",999129600,19,606,4.324561403508772
1333525,4,B00003UC5N,"Kusturica pulls off a masterful and affectionate parody of life and customs of Serbian Gypsies on the Danube.  His best sendups are of the would-be large and small-time crooks in the story.  An overdose of slapstick is neatly cancelled by his great use of great music - who else would spring Grandpa from a hospital by brass band invasion?  Which unexplained capo trussed the musicians to play up a tree?  Any chamber musician who has ever felt more like servant than artist will feel right at home with that scene.  Amid this inspired chaos, the family members dutifully taking care of each other at cross purposes balance further parodies of Balkan violence.  A work of genius, and to those fluent enough to recognize the Serbian and Romany epithets behind the subtitles, a fine education in the art of strong language.",995414400,8,821,4.828571428571428
1333526,4,B00003UC5N,"Kusturica's films always employ a certain level of the fantastic, and this film is no exception. Essentially it is a comic romp compared with his previous film, Underground. All the same actors appear here, basically, but confusing arrangements and promises that must be kept come in the way of what the characters really want. It is a lovely story. Manic at times and a bit too long, but great and fun for lack of more sophisticated praise.",985564800,8,441,4.740259740259741
1333527,5,B00003UC5N,"Possibly the most hilarious movie I've seen in my life.  It beats Window  to Paris and A Fish Called Wanda.  Matko Destanov is trying to pull off a  really good scam and fails miserably, leading to an hour and a half of  complications as three generations of four families get in deeper and  deeper until the ends meet themselves and tie up.  Also features lots of  wonderful Balkan music *and* the dance hit ""Where Do You Go"" (No  Mercy version).",968803200,4,447,4.4875

I had no expectations when entering the cinema, and get  out with a big smile in my face. Just wait for the price to come down (106$  is too much). Trust me!

7919504,5,B00003UC5N,"With this film Kusturica originally set out to make a movie about music, and eventually he built up a story to go with it. If you watch with that in mind you will notice things that may escape you if you consider the music merely ""background"" to the dramatic action. Romani musicians are legendary and with good reason, and in this movie the music itself is an uncredited main character. Also, pay attention to the deeper layers of non-farcical detail in the Roma and their relationships -- the rituals they adhere to (days of mourning at a death, days of feasting at a wedding) and the ways fathers and sons are linked to one another.

The actors speak a mix of Romani, Serbian, and Bulgarian, with a few isolated phrases in English. If you are able to catch which characters speak which languages it will be clear who the ""outsiders"" are (such as the Serbian-speaking officials who perform the weddings). This adds to the humor and is also a realistic reflection of Roma communities in the Balkans. Another source of linguistic humor is that much of the swearing takes place in Serbian, even when the characters are speaking Romani otherwise.

As for the story, just roll with it and enjoy the way it meanders to its conclusion.",1523059200,,1230,4.663594470046083

7919509,5,B00003UC5N,"Great show! A couple of surprises that might be met with disapproval.
I didn't have subtitles on and I'm glad. Reading would have distracted from the marvelous visual details. The photography is beautiful, crystal clear. Settings are amazing. The music is wonderful. Editing is superb. The actors are gloriously expressive and a bit stereotypical, so there's no need for words to get the gist and be highly amused. Here's a clue: The set-up for the final joke is at the beginning, in the living room - it was funny enough at the beginning. I laughed and laughed throughout the whole thing.

Third time I watch, I'll turn on the subtitles to see if they add anything valuable to the experience.",1511136000,2,693,4.775
