They're still funny.

As for the adage that they are racist, I will put forth they are not. Jose Jimenez was Hispanic, American and very ernest and idealized the work ethic that he felt he could participate in. He was patriotic, honest and sincere.

He did however, fall into the gulf of cultural misunderstanding and language.

Recall, this was the era that produced a song by Pat Boone called ""Speedy Gonzales"" and was alongside any number of TV commercials about the ""Frito Bandito"". The show got maligned about the content being a ""stupid Mexican"", when it was not. There are no slurs, no suggestion of inappropriate content.

Just the characters, Don Adams, Bill Dana, and Jonathan Harris all engagingly dealing  with the comedy of character. No insult comedy here.

Still very very funny.",1241913600,5,944,4.748466257668712
8192306,5,B000PLUVDK,"This is one of those Golden Age shows that couldn't get made now. I love Bill Dana and Jose is a real lovable character. Plus it's a great precursor to ""Get Smart"" and you really see where that character developed. Plus the guy who played the Professor on ""Lost In Space"". This is a treasure.",1209600000,5,292,4.327272727272727
