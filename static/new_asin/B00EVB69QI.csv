8609818,5,B00EVB69QI,"For any Nightwish fan, this is a must have as this is the only concert DVD with the former front-lady, Anette Olzon. Only produced for South America for some odd reason, it's worth the shipping wait. Picture and sound is not all great but is still good enough to enjoy. Concert is in widescreen but only in 2.0 surround. This is the only DVD where you can watch and hear Anette sing the ""Tarja"" tunes. I always did wonder how Anette held up to the ""Tarja"" tunes and she did great! 11 tracks are performed here during the 2008 Rock Werchter Festival at Belgium. You may want to check on ebay where I got mine if this is still unavailable here on Amazon.",1390780800,,652,4.308943089430894
