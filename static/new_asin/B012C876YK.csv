7346698,5,B012C876YK,I Loved this Anime so much. The plot is done pretty well to the manga I think. Hold true to manga to. nicely done.,1447372800,,114,3.7916666666666665
7346699,5,B012C876YK,"This is my absolute FAVORITE shojo anime and I can't recommend the story enough. It is sweet and romantic and heartbreaking and funny. The main female character (Futaba) is very likeable and relatable and the main male character (Kou) is the perfect dark, brooding hottie. Oh, those eyes! Io Sakisaka is without a doubt the most talented shojo mangaka I've seen. I am in love with her illustration style and somebody NEEDS to publish the Ao Haru Ride manga in English!!

I've been watching this on Crunchyroll, so at first I wasn't sure if it would be worth the money to buy the blu-ray, but I am so glad I did. Of course the picture quality is way better, but there is also a different translation which is a lot smoother in some parts. I do wish they had included honorifics in the English translation, though. You also get to see translations of the song lyrics, which is nice. So I definitely recommend this, but it will leave you wanting the rest of the story! I still hope they make a second season of the anime.",1447113600,13,1018,4.473118279569892
7346700,5,B012C876YK,"Just going to keep this short and simple since many others have described this so well. The characters are very likeable. The story was fascinating and went on at a good pace.

Only issue is the light novel is currently ongoing. So the anime may seem to end abruptly (although still on a fine note). Possible season 2 in the future?",1462406400,,332,4.442622950819672
7346701,5,B012C876YK,"Shoujo of the heart-warming, introspective sort.  I like that the two leads pull each other along in getting to know themselves (and each other).  There are some nice, fluffy friendship moments too.  Even though I had already watched it when it first aired in Japan, just checking the first episode of the Blu-ray release had me marathoning the whole show again.  The ending might not be totally satisfying (as the manga continues past that point), but I think it provides just enough resolution without closing things off for possible future season(s) (not sure we'll get any -- but anyway, the manga went off the rails some time after).  I definitely see myself revisiting it again in the future, as it's one of the more enjoyable shoujo anime out there, in my opinion.",1456012800,,771,4.8106060606060606
7346702,5,B012C876YK,"First of all this is a fantasic series that offers more than your typical love story that you find in most romance animes. The main focus of this series isn't just about the romance, its about finding ones self again. And we get to see that with our two main characters who feel like they had to change there personalities from when they where younger because of tragic situations from there past. Its also a good thing to see how the side characters grow in the series as well. The other big theme in this series is friendship and how strong a bond all our characters have with each other throughout the series. Over all i recommend this series if your looking for a good romantic slice of life series. After you watch this series please go read the manga there is so much more story after the anime ended. Hopefully we will get a second season someday",1455667200,4,853,4.405063291139241
7346703,5,B012C876YK,I LOVED this show. I highly recomand it!,1454112000,,40,4.125
7346704,5,B012C876YK,"Absolutely amazing anime. Any fan of romance anime will love this one. This is one of the most heartwarming and beautiful stories you will ever see/read. This anime is 12 episodes long and while you don't need to read the manga to have a nice ending here I highly recommend it. After I watched this anime I went online and read the whole manga in a day. Its 49 chapters and worth every bit of your time. If you read the manga I think this will easily be your favorite anime.

I don't think I could say enough good things about this anime. The anime itself is less romance and more a coming of age story between the characters as they navigate high school, growing up, facing tragedy, and figuring out what kind of people they want to be. It might sound cheesy but it comes through in a very sweet way. I really encourage you to read the manga online if you want the full story behind these characters pasts and the romance aspect of the anime. It has a beautiful conclusion and a happy ending.",1453939200,5,993,4.310160427807487
7346705,5,B012C876YK,"Perfect! Came a day late, but with the weather that's totally understandable.",1453420800,,77,5.5
7346706,3,B012C876YK,Would gave it 5 stars as I loved it a lot. The cover is very misleading as it says it is complete. But it isn't complete. It's missing 2 episodes. One episode deals with them in the past when they were in their first year together. The second episode titled episode 13 is what happens on their spring break a continuation after episode 12.,1453420800,9,339,4.3125
7346707,4,B012C876YK,"A really good anime, but it will leave you wanting more, and for that you'll need to read the manga of the whole series. I like the art style and character designs. Romantic but predictable, but isn't that why we watch these? It's one of those shows with strongly written characters who make you forget that you already know what will happen in the end. Sometimes the journey is rewarding enough.",1452816000,,396,4.591549295774648
7346708,5,B012C876YK,At first I was upset that this didn't come with English dub. I don't mind subtitles but I usually like to understand what they are saying and not be distracted by reading. My fault I didn't read the description first but I'm glad I bought it! The animation and music are gorgeous! The characters are good and it's a compelling story for a romance. No regrets.,1450569600,2,359,4.454545454545454
7346709,3,B012C876YK,"An enjoyable slice-of-life series that moves PAINFULLY slow most of the time but is helped by the beautiful art, really likable characters, and some seriously funny moments.",1448409600,,173,5.444444444444445

At the beginning I was a bit disappointed because it was not a movie but a series, and no dub, but I was hooked from start to finish and I kept watching to the very end. It's so sweet. Exactly what I needed.",1518134400,2,242,3.9591836734693877
