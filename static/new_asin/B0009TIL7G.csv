8066449,3,B0009TIL7G,Got the movie and it was on VHS cassette!!! Then watched the movie and saw what it was based on...I completely understood. Will reconsider before letting my husband put movies on the list for our collection. But if you're from DC you'd enjoy it. Keeping in mind that this is a really old movie.,1517875200,,294,4.462962962962963

8066451,3,B0009TIL7G,"This movie was first released as GOOD TO GO.  It was supposed to bring DC's go go scene mainstream, but that never happened.  They recut the film and re-released it as this, a crime drama.  Bad storyline, bad acting.  It will top the chart of the worst films you've ever seen.  Buy this ONLY for the ""step back in time"" vintage go go footage featuring Chuck Brown, Trouble Funk and others.",1294185600,2,389,4.422535211267606

8066453,5,B0009TIL7G,"A gang murder.. A cop out of control... and a reporter with a story so hot a city might explode. There are two Washington DCs...one a shimmering city of monuments and power, and the Washington that is a sprawling inner-city torn between despair, rage and violence. It is a world where drugs dull the pain, and the gangs rule the streets. It is into this other Washington that a reporter begins an odyssey that starts with his desperate search for a story and finishes with a life and death struggle for the truth. Art Garfunkel is the reporter used by a corrupt cop to frame an innocent man for a brutal rape-murder. In search of the real story, he meets the victims of the violence.. .the people caught in the crossfire between the gangs and the cops. When he witnesses a cold blooded killing, he finds that the truth can be hazardous to his career...and his life. ""Short Fuse"" is a suspense charged, action packed, shocking look at today's urban nightmare.",1173657600,2,958,4.608187134502924
