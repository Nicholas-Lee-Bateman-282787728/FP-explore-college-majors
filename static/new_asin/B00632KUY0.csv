4934822,5,B00632KUY0,"This movie set came in good time and plays great. Red Planet, 2010 The year we made contact, Contact 3 great movies for one low price Yea!!!",1390348800,,140,4.222222222222222
4934823,5,B00632KUY0,"Great collection of thinking fan's sf, but not short on action. Red Planet feels like a modernized pulp sci-fi story from the 50's or 60's. It does get a bit hokey, and takes stabs at deeper questions rather than actually exploring them. But a good solid story, and the science isn't bad.

2010 is the most well-recognized of these films. It dealt with being the sequel to a cinema classic by going in a different direction, and trying to be entertaining rather than deep, which helps humanize it a lot.

Contact is the movie of these three that really probes the deeper questions of faith vs science. It has the least action of the three (read: almost none), but it's a great sci-fi drama from a period when such films weren't being made that often.",1383868800,4,750,4.548148148148148
4934824,5,B00632KUY0,"Three sci-fi  movies that were nicely packed at a great price. The video and audio quality are superb, the best transfer I've seen since I saw them at the movies.

4934825,4,B00632KUY0,"Three great movies that go well together.  Only thing I don't like about the 3-fer DVD's is missing special features, but the price is truly right for 3 movies as good as these.",1365724800,2,177,4.363636363636363
4934826,5,B00632KUY0,"If you love sci-fi like my Wife and I do then this is a worthwhile purchase!  We've already seen Contact which is a great story and dvd, but to have these in bluray makes it even more whorthwhile for less than 7 bucks a bluray!?  Wow!  Again, we've seen Contact on DVD, but can't wait to see it on bluray.  After purchasing and arriving, we both watched Red Planet already and all i can say is, whoa!  The sound in 5.1 is A+, picture another A+, and all around great story!  The space scenes are awesome on a hifi hd bigscreen 60""!  Can't wait to see 2010 and Contact!  If you don't have these in your collection what are you waiting for?  Very Affordable!",1340496000,,656,4.225806451612903
4934827,4,B00632KUY0,"Warner has done a number of these ""Triple-Feature"" releases on Blu-ray and it's a good bargain for a trio of films that range from exceptional to good.

""The Red Planet"" features Val Kilmer and Carrie Moss as part of a team sent to Mars to find out what happened to a previous expedition that vanished without any final message. Complicating things their robot assistant has gone rogue when it's damaged reverting to its original combat mode. While ""Red Planet"" certainly has its flaws, it's an entertaining, diverting science fiction adventure. Tom Sizemore, Terence Stamp and Benjamin Bratt fill out the other spacesuits in this adventure.

""2010"" based on Arthur C. Clarke's first sequel novel of the same name to ""2001"" has a somewhat similair plot to ""The Red Planet"". Heywood Floyd (Roy Scheider in the sequel) who sent the Discovery on its voyage to Jupiter hooks a ride to Jupiter on a Russian ship commanded by Tanya Kirbuk (an anagram for Kubrick and played by Helen Mirren)when the Discovery is spotted. HAL's creator Dr. R. Chandra (Bob Balaban)comes along for the ride in hopes that they can boot up HAL and when they suspect that he caused the demise of the crew. Featuring John Lithgow and a host of terrific character actors, it can't quite measure up to the original film but it's still a worthwhile adventure from director Peter Hyams (""Outland"", ""Capricorn One"", ""The Presido"", ""Narrow Margin"").

""Contact"" based on Carl Sagan's novel of the same name takes the most risks tackling questions of faith and has a truly stunning opening sequence. Directed by Robert Zemeckis (""Who's Afraid of Roger Rabbit?"", ""Back to the Future"", ""Forest Gump"")and starring Jodie Foster the film tackles the first contact story form a very different perspective--what if the aliens return a message to us with instructions on how to build a device so we can meet? How will that change the balance of power, impact our sense of our place in the universe and our faith? It's a well made science fiction film although the casting is a bit wonky at times (I felt that Matthew McConaughey was miscast). Featuring some stunning visual effects and great casting (James Woods, Tom Skerritt, William Fichnter, David Morse, Angela Bassett), the film is only dated by the use of footage of President Clinton and Larry King (which gave the film a sense of reality at the time)but holds up remarkably well. The film is a bit talky at times but still manages to be engrossing.

All three films look quite good--there were some complaints that ""Contact"" had a bit too much digital noise reduction when it was released but it looks quite good regardless. ""2010"" also looks quite nice although a restoration wasn't done on the film (which was produced in 1984). ""Red Planet"" looks pretty good with nice strong detail throughout the presentation. There are some occasional compression artifacts but, on the whole, the film looks quite nice with bold colors and, while not reference quality blacks, they are still fairly strong.

Audio is quite strong for all three films.

The special features vary a bit ranging from weak (deleted scenes for ""Red Planet"" along with the theatrical trailer)to decent (the original production promotional featurette which is presented in standard definition, the theatrical trailer)to very good (commentary tracks by one from actor Jodie Foster, one from director Robert Zemekis and producer Steve Starkey, and one from senior visual effects supervisor Ken Ralston and visual effects supervisor Stephen Rosenbaum; we get three animated shot/set design that were done in CGI; ""The Making of the Opening Shot"" a very good featurette about the shot of the Eagle Nebula; the destruction of the NASA machine, as well as, ""The Making of the Harriett Landing"" and a composite reel. As I recall all three were carried over from the original DVD release) for the three films.

This is a nice, good set of three enjoyable science fiction films all on their own discs and just repackaged.",1330300800,22,3991,4.9745127436281855

4934829,5,B00632KUY0,First of all sci-fi is definitely my favorite group of movies to watch. The red planet keeps your attention seems like anything about mars is captivating to the mind. Contact is very driven by not knowing what is going to happen. All three movies are good the combo is the way to buy them. I thank it is good mix of sci-fi to pick up they are older movies but great to watch especially on blue ray.,1446508800,,398,4.181818181818182

4934831,5,B00632KUY0,"This review is only about the bluray disc and the packaging.  To avoid problems, I purchased it directly from Amazon, rather than from any of its partner sellers.

The packaging is as pictured, all plastic with 3 disc mounts in the spine so you can turn it like a book, and just paper graphic inserts.

All discs played, the movies were quality bluray mastering in 2.40:1 aspect ratio, audio output selectable English 5.1or TrueHD, or multiple languages and subtitles. The discs were a movie each, with extras in 4: 3 format.

Of the 3, mastering is least good on 2010, the colors are muted, edges blurry, and the video will become grainy if you try to sharpen it during playback.  2010 is the oldest of the 3, I think 1984 was the release date, but its still better than streaming video on Netflix even at HD resolution.  For comparison, its predecessor, Kubrick's 1968 movie, 2001, is as perfect as a new digital movie.

Red Planet released in ~ 2000 and Contact 1996?? are superbly mastered, colors are rich and vibrant, and tack sharp in resolved details and all three have great 5.1 sound.",1433635200,,1094,4.637305699481865

4934833,5,B00632KUY0,"Gotta have this collection if you're any kind of sci-fi fanatic. I know Red Planet didn't receive rave reviews when it came out, but I enjoyed it very much.  Contact and 2010 are also wonderful films and to have all 3 on a  Blu-ray disc at this price is exceptional.",1427068800,,266,4.3
