8484464,3,B005S0JKIA,"In a 2011 Tamil drama Deiva Thirumagal Vikram plays Krishna, a mentally-challenged chocolate factory worker and father of a lovely five-year-old daughter Nila (Sara Arjun). When Nila is taken away by a wealthy and powerful local figure (who happens to be Nilas grandfather), a young and inexperienced lawyer Anuradha Ragunathan (Anushka Shetty) stands up for Krishna.

OK, this is I Am Sam in Kollywood. Theres no denying that. In fact, the film is much longer than the Hollywood film, with one long flashback where back stories of Krishna and Nila are told, and so many melodramatic turns of the plot. And theres one big difference at the ending which some viewers would think is better than that of the Sean Penn / Dakota Fanning film.

The premise is now even less convincing than that of I Am Sam, and the film switches back and forth between comedy and drama too busily, but Deiva Thirumagal is a pretty good drama thanks to the fine acting from the leads.",1399334400,,961,4.748502994011976

While nowhere near as effective as the film it is based on, ""Deiva Thirumagal"" has it's own charm and a few segments, especially the cinematic interpretation of the stories Krishna tells his daughter, which rise above the ordinary competence of the rest of the film. Sara Arjun, playing Krishna's daughter, is a beautiful and talented little girl who easily holds her own against the veteran cast.",1325808000,,577,6.4935064935064934
