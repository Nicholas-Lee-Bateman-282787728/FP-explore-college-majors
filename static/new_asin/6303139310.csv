7839636,1,6303139310,"I fully expected to find this film directed by Alan Smithee or some such pseudonym. However, the director Albert Pyun has such credits as 'Brainsmasher: A Love Story' and 'Alien from L.A.' on his curriculum vitae, so (despite the almost-tolerable film such as 'Cyborg') I thought I might have stumbled upon the reincarnation of Ed Wood. However, I know 'Plan 9 from Outer Space'; I've seen 'Plan 9 from Outer Space'. This film is no 'Plan 9 from Outer Space'.

This is one of those low-budget, martial arts films designed to capitalise on the success of earlier glories. There was a successful film, entitled 'Kickboxer', which starred Jean-Claude van Damme (and not directed by Pyun). Van Damme steered clear of the sequels to make other films (not all successful; his film 'Coyote Moon' was as bad as 'Kickboxer 4', prompting that director to Smithee out under the non de plume Danny Mulroon). Thus, Kurt Sloane had to have a successor, David Sloane, played by Sasha Mitchell (yes, that guy from the sit-com, 'Step by Step'). David Sloane is obviously not from Europe, so his relationship to Kurt Sloane is, well, who cares? If one is looking for continuity in across the four-arc trainwreck of Kickboxer, one must get used to disappointment. There's often no continuity from scene to scene.

You also have to wonder about a sequel so bad on paper that the actor who plays the villain in earlier segments, Michael Quissi, decides to give it a miss. So, we get a poorly disguised Kamel Krifa as Tong Po (one-time national martial arts champion of Thailand, now a Mexican drug-lord and sex slave trader - does that qualify as a lateral career move?); Krifa isn't even credited in the film, taking Quissi's place. The make-up is so pathetic that the plastic bits of the mask seem to be falling off even before Krifa starts his martial routines. I've seen better make-up jobs at local civic theatre events having to rely on grandmother's make-up case because of no budget.

Anyway, back to the story. Sloane, ambiguous relation to Kurt 'muscles from Brussels' Sloane, has to rescue his wife from his arch-enemy holding her hostage as a sex slave in a desert hideout that doubles as a ranch for martial arts tournaments where the fighting is to the death. Oh, yes, it also doubles as a drug-lord hideaway, with distribution and production and such. By now you're probably asking - how can you go wrong with that set-up? The plot practically unfolds without help into a winning formula, right? Well, it probably did unfold by itself. Sloane is in jail (who knows why, framed apparently, but for what, and by whom? Uh, once again, who cares?), then gets out of jail to go to this tournament. He meets up with Peppermint Patti, er, Megan Lawrence (Michelle Krasnoo) who also wants to go to this martial arts tournament.

First there are tryouts. Peppermint Patti tries, and Sloane fells her with a single stroke. Somehow, she is still permitted into the tournament. Okay. Oh, and it turns out that another contestant is an undercover DEA agent (Brad Thornton, in what appears to have been his only film role ever), just as Sloane it turns out is a former DEA agent. What a lucky combination for them that the martial arts contest is at the drug lord's hideaway!

Of course, they are discovered, but not after furtive scenes with the sex slaves, and Sloane searching for his wife. There is more to life than martial arts, you know. But not much more, apparently. Oh, and what would the film be without some gratuitous torture before getting to the main events - the contest (where the contestants are finally told the 'to-the-death' rule, to the surprise of many), and the final showdown in a martial arts fight that is just sad.

Now, I must confess to be no connoisseur of martial arts choreography, but one doesn't have to follow the ballet regularly to know a bad dancer; this was pathetic, particularly compared to the martial arts performances at the 'tournament' just a few scenes earlier. Here we are having the classic showdown between good and evil, Sloane against Po in a no-holds-barred kickboxing contest, and what do we see? Picnic tables overturned, barely a blow landed against the other, and after practically everyone is now dead, Po makes his escape through a side door. One can almost see him twisting his mustache as a silent-picture villain as he scutters across the lawn and off to Kickboxer 5, if they'd have him.

I know it is bad form to give away the ending, but Sloane and his wife, Peppermint Patti and the DEA agent all live, as we see them all, bruised and bloody, out the door and into the nether world of 'will there be another sequel?'

Hey, what are the odds? That there were FOUR of these films was astonishing enough - probably three too many. 'Kickboxer 4: The Aggressor' - why the aggressor? Who knows? Because martial arts is aggressive, I suppose. 'Kickboxer 4' should have the appendage 'A Sucker Born Every Moment' for anyone who paid to see this.

This is a bad film. BAD. I watched it on a cable channels when it came on; I was half asleep and couldn't find the remote, and couldn't be bothered to get out of bed. This film did have the kind of mesmerising effect of being so bad that one just couldn't stop watching. I drifted off to sleep now and again through the film, but somehow don't think that detracted from the experience.

Mitchell and Nicholas Guest are good actors. I've seen them in shows where they were good. This is not one of them. I can't speak to the other actors, and feel very sorry for Brad Thornton to have this as the only film on his resume. No one deserves such a fate.

Watch it at your own risk.",1137369600,,5662,4.657657657657658
7839637,3,6303139310,"First of all I hated Tong Po,he looked really stupid. He needs to shave his eyebrows, it makes him look girlish.
I also hated the box cover for the movie, it showed the orignal Tong Po, but in the movie it was a different Tong Po.
Another stupid thing about this film was the woman from the escort, first she wasn't interested in the DEA Undercover Agent, then she sees him save Michelle Krasnoo's character and then she is all over him.
I thought it was stupid at the end of the film you see Tong Po sneaking out door.
One more thing there was too much nudity.
My favirote scene was the bar fight, there was alot of action there.
The DEA Agent was a really good fighter, he was very impressive, so was Michelle Krasnoo.
I also think that Sasha Mitchell is a very good looking guy.
Well I give this film 3 stars. I believe that the orignal Kickboxer movie was the best.",1079481600,,869,4.240963855421687
7839638,2,6303139310,"THIS TIME, DAVID SLOAN [SASHA MITCHELL] IS FRAMED FOR MURDER. IN ORDER TO GAIN HIS FREEDOM, DAVE MUST ENTER A TOURNAMENT AND BRING TONG PO TO JUSTICE. WELL, ONE THING IS DEFINITELY TRUE; SASHA MITCHELL IS DEFINITELY NO JEAN CLAUDE VAN DAMME. THIS SEQUEL LOOKS LIKE A CROSS BETWEEN ''ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK'' AND ''ENTER THE DRAGON''. THIS IS AN IMPROVEMENT OVER THE LAST TWO MOVIES, BUT STILL, IT AIN'T NOWHERE NEAR AS ENTERTAINING AS THE FIRST. THOUGH THIS IS TOLERABLE, THEY REALLY NEED TO GIVE THIS SERIES A REST. YA GOTTA ADMIT, TONG PO'S THICK ACCENT IS VERY HILLARIOUS.",1068595200,,573,4.74
7839639,2,6303139310,"Sasha Mitchell returns as David Sloan for the fourth installment in the KICKBOXER series. This time, Sloan, who we last saw as a kickboxing champ is now working for the DEA (for some reason) and his rival, Tong Po, is a wanted drug kingpin. This really kind of hurts the series and film as this really makes no sense, given the events of the previous films.
Anyways, Sloan is on his way to Mexico to save his wife, who was kidnapped by Tong Po when he was in prison (huh?) and on his way, he gets a little help from a dirty bike riding tomboy kickboxer who is also headed to Mexico to fight in the same tournament. Enter a handful of silly characters including an undercover DEA agent sent in as Sloan's back-up, another fighter who works as a sub-villian, and a female escort who pleasures all the guests at Po's compound.
This movie has some pretty good action sequences but it really doesn't work as an entry in the KICKBOXER series. The actor who plays Tong Po has an awful accent and a really silly-looking make-up job that just makes him look dumb. Turning a pretty good martial arts series into some type of undercover crime war movie was a bad idea. Even worse, the last entry to feature Mitchell's character has an unsatisfying ending that makes for a terrible climax to the series.",1059350400,,1291,4.47457627118644
