8413293,1,B00429UEN8,"Please take my advice- don't waste you money on this one. The music is very annoying and ruined the experience. The dvd doesn't loop. The segments were too short for any kind of ambience. The imagery was just ok, but not exceptional. I bought it as a birthday gift for a friend of mine, after he saw another relaxation video I had, and this one was totally embarrassing. All in all, you get what you pay for unfortunately, this one is for the thriftstore 99 cent bin. I wish it wasn't so, I hate giving bad reviews.",1290384000,7,515,4.319587628865979
8413294,4,B00429UEN8,"Zen Garden is visually stunning and demo quality in the blu-ray format (I have a 46"" Samsung LCD). The colors are vibrant and the seasonal changes make for an experience that is not repetitive. Landscapes and waterfalls and flowers make for a relaxing mini-vacation. My only complaint is that, unlike others in Living Landscapes' blu series, you are not given the option of choosing natural sounds or music. This disc is music only - a Japanese new age wandering sort of music that fits with what you are seeing - but I would have preferred the option of hearing only natural sounds (birds, waterfall, dripping water, wind, etc.). Of course you have the option of turning the sound off, and putting some other cd in. Also unlike most of the Living Landscapes I have bought, this one does not continuously loop - when it ends it goes back to the menu and you have to push play again. That is inconvenient if you are using it as a sort of moving decoration on the wall or a background for a nice long nap. But this one is a keeper for the visual excellence of the disc. Much cheaper than flying to Japan.",1287360000,8,1102,4.46039603960396
