2020713,5,B0001NNLT8,"This dvd produced by Miracle Productions offers a pretty good version of this ""old chestnut"" concerning the life , career & death of Abraham Lincoln. The image is quite clear & the audio acceptable. This is a GREAT buy if you can pick one up at a local SAV-A-LOT or someplace similar (like I did) for a buck. The asking price of $17.98 is a bit steep for this NO-FRILLS release.
Griffith did OK by this film but his style & method of film making was already being considered ""old fashioned"" even for the early sound era. And Griffith himself was easily a much more assured director in the silent era...just compare the assassination of Lincoln in this soundie to the superior version of the same incident in THE BIRTH OF A NATION. The tension, the dramatic...all gone. It really goes to show how the far the MASTER had fallen, or in all fairness, had been left behind.
Now mind you, I'm not putting down this film or Griffith. I truly believe that this is an important film & needs to be seen...by YOU. And the version here presented by Miracle is quite acceptable, but you needn't pay the price when it can be had from Amazon dealers for a couple bucks. Please buy this classic & enjoy this slice of Americana, it's well worth the investment and a ""keeper"" to your dvd library.",1228867200,3,1278,4.465811965811966
2020714,4,B0001NNLT8,"Although not made as exciting as modern thrillers, this movie has subtle humor and historical points, which make this movie well worth taking in.",1184025600,2,145,5.083333333333333
2020715,5,B0001NNLT8,"This is probably the greatest dvd ever put out by one of those suggested

list price of one dollar companies. The prints on this disc aren't great - there are better - but they are actually not too lousy either; worse

prints have certainly floated through before and apparently after this

disc appeared. Aside from scene selection, though, there is nothing extra

on this dual-layer, two-sided disc. Considering, however, what the two

features are, this is obviously a must-have for anyone into building a comprehensive movie library. And since precious few who actually do buy this dvd to just see what all the controversy with ""Birth Of A Nation"" was

about and then actually sit through both films will ever return to either again, a dollar or two spent for both seems a very logical purchase.

Not that either of these films were ever his best work. 1915's ""Birth Of A Nation"" didn't really advance D.W. Griffith's art very far; he'd already mastered everything found in here with his last round or two of Biograph films. And indeed, there are several glaring continuity errors (the reappearance of a character already killed, for example) and many just plain incoherent shots. And the film's defiant 19th century white southerner viewpoint is appalling, obviously. Yet the film is definitely

fascinating as well; Griffith was indeed the master of directors when

inspired, and this film, while terribly flawed, is often truly inspired.

""Abraham Lincoln"", however, is a different animal entirely, despite being

basically an extension of several scenes from the earlier film. This was

Griffith's first all-sound film, and is overall disappointing. While it's

generally true that he produced very little after 1924's masterpiece ""Isn't Life Wonderful?"" that compared to his earlier periods,

this is the most frustrating of them all, because this one has potential all over it; and while it seems ready to develop into Griffith classical

melodrama, it is somehow at odds with the main point of the film. Much like his earlier historical ""America"", much feels stilted and dry, and noone really gives an excellent performance; but at least ""America"" had Griffith's final significant leading lady, Carole Dempster. ""Abraham Lincoln"" does have several superb scenes, but an equal number of very boring and stiff scenes as well. The movie did some business but received an apathetic critical response, and for once, the critics weren't completely wrong.

The director would redeem himself on his next and final piece, 1931's ""The Struggle"", one of his greatest films which saw a shocking resumption of his peak powers. In retrospect, though; at the time it was a critical and commercial disaster and went largely unseen until Kino's great video release around the mid '90's (no dvd release by anyone I can tell as of the end of 2006).

And obviously having ""The Struggle"", Griffith's only other sound film, on this disc would be infinitely a better and more logical film set, what is on here is still, undeniably, classic stuff. Being as the prints used are pretty decent, for a mere one or two bucks you can get them on one dvd. Thats pretty awesome; and they are of course sold separately for similar bargain prices. The best introduction to Griffith as far as art is concerned would be 1916's ""Intolerance"", and Delta has a great, near-Kino

definitive print on dvd titled ""Intolerance: A Sun Play Of The Ages"". Usually sold around five or six dollars, this particular edition is rarely seen anywhere physically but is easily acquired on the web. This particular dvd copy of ""Abraham Lincoln""/""Birth Of A Nation"" is usually

easy to come across in store bargain bins, and preferable in fact to a couple of other issues with similar prices so try to get this release online if you can't find it locally.",1162684800,6,3811,4.992101105845181

It's not - but that's not a bad thing. It's a work of historical fiction and its fairly well done. You get to see an interesting fictional interpretation of Lincoln - without a l ot of modern narative baggage.

This is like the original version of the History Channel.",1146096000,15,485,4.25
2020718,4,B0001NNLT8,"Having enjoyed director/filmmaker D.W. Griffith's work from early stages of filmmaking through the 1920's silent era, I was curious to see Griffith's first `talkie', and it lived up to my expectations.  A good script and a talented cast combined with Griffith's experience made ""Abraham Lincoln"" a highly respected film of the early sound era of the 1930s - and no doubt helped Walter Houston's career considerably, as his portrayal of Lincoln in this film is very impressive.  In fact, I personally thought Houston's is the best portrayal of Lincoln I have seen so far, and I found the other characters, settings and even dialogues to be quite realistic and well done also.  But this is a 1930 film and shouldn't be compared to modern films and today's standards (just as Griffith's work overall can't rightly be compared to more contemporary directors and filmmakers) so some familiarity with 1930s films would go a long way to help appreciate ""Abraham Lincoln"".  By today's standards this film might seem dull and slow-moving; furthermore, the sound on this particular DVD is rather crackly, as many early sound films are, but after a few minutes, as I got into the story, I forgot about the noise and thoroughly enjoyed the film.  Rather than a melodrama of sorts, this rendition of Lincoln's life is almost like a documentary in that it shows the highlights and well-known aspects of Lincoln's life and career in a very factual manner.  Nevertheless, I recognized some of Griffith's trademarks in some scenes which emphasize Lincoln's qualities and some other dramatic punctuation and highlights, especially in the final scenes.  For some viewers this film might seem choppy or poorly-edited due to the jump from one scene to another, such as events in Lincoln's early life to a period some years later - but these `jumps' were common in the transition period from silent to sound films, and furthermore, this film attempts to show a man's whole life in just 90 minutes.  For a 1930 effort, I think Griffith did a fine job, and I'd recommend this DVD to those already familiar with early talkies, especially those with a special interest in Lincoln and history.  Although this is a budget label, the picture quality is very good, and apart from the background static and crackle common to old films, I had no trouble understanding what was being said.  For the low cost of this DVD it is definitely a good buy!",1142294400,19,2415,4.897058823529412

But it is difficult to make a movie about such a revered figure that clearly shows Lincoln as the more complex man that he was.

2020802,3,B0001NNLT8,"Abraham Lincoln was probably our greatest President (certainly one of the top 3), and D.W. Griffith was surely the greatest director of the silent era. So D.W. Griffith Presents Abraham Lincoln is a must see for any film lover. Made in 1929 and released in 1930, this is one of our earliest talkies. It stars Walter Huston and Una Merkel with Russell Simpson and Jason Robards Sr.

Walter Huston (1883-1950) plays Lincoln. At this point in his career, Huston was churning out film -  3 in 1930, 4 in 1931, 8 in 1932, and 5 in 1933. His performances are relatively undistinguished, even if some of the films (e.g., ""Gabriel Over the White House"") were hits. Huston got better as he got older, and he was nominated for an Oscar in 1937 (""Dodsworth""), 1942 (""Devil and Daniel Webster"") and 1943 (""Yankee Doodle Dandy"") and won in 1949 for ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"". He died in 1950.

Una Merkel (1903-1986) appeared in nearly 100 films and was nominated as Best Supporting Actress in 1961 (""Summer and Smoke""). She's best remembered for the hair pulling fight with Marlene Dietrich in ""Destry Rides Again"" (1939). Lincoln was her first film after having worked in the theatre for 5 years. She plays Ann Rutledge, Lincoln's first love. BTW - when she was younger and slimmer, as she is in this picture, Merkel was the spitting image of Lillian Gish.

Russell Simpson (1880-1959) used his lanky appearance and deep voice effectively in films with Errol Flynn (""Dodge City"", ""Santa Fe Trail""), Henry Fonda (""My Darling Clementine""), and John Wayne (""The Horse Soldiers""). He was a favorite of John Ford, and he gave his most memorable performance in Ford's ""Grapes of Wrath"" as Pa Joad. Here he plays young Lincoln's employer.

Jason Robards Sr. (1892-1963) is billed as Jason Robards since his son was not acting at the time (Junior started in films in 1959). Robards was a prolific actor appearing in nearly 100 films, most of which are forgettable. Robards plays Lincoln's law partner.

D.W. Griffith (1875-1949) practically invented the idea of film directing. He directed the first film ever made in Hollywood (""In Old California"" in 1910) and was the first person to employ Mary Pickford, Mack Sennett, Lionel Barrymore, Lillian Gish, etc. He's most well known for ""Birth of a Nation"" (1915). After Lincoln, he made only one more film - ""The Struggle"" (1931).

The film is based on a story by Stephen Vincent Benet (1898-1943) who also wrote ""The Devil and Daniel Webster"" (1942) that starred Huston.

Lincoln was a popular figure in film, especially in the silent era. In talkies, several films focused on Lincoln - ""Young Mr. Lincoln"" (1939) with Henry Fonda and  directed by John Ford,  ""Abe Lincoln in Illinois"" (1940) with Raymond Massey, ""The Day Lincoln Was Shot"" (1998) TV movie with Lance Henriksen, and Gore Vidal's Lincoln (1998). Many other Civil War films feature Lincoln in a major role. Frank McGlynn played Lincoln in two 1936 films -  ""The Plainsman"" and ""The Prisoner of Shark island"" and Raymond Massey also played him three times - in the 1940 film, a 1956 TV special ""The Day Lincoln was Shot"", and the 1960 film  ""How The West Was Won"" . Royal Dano (1922-94) did a terrific job in the 1952-3 TV series ""Mr. Lincoln"". My preference is for Raymond Massey, followed by Royal Dano.

This is an interesting film. Of course it is not historically accurate, and Griffith's southern bias is clear even while he offers a heavily pro Lincoln portrait. It is really the last of the silent film epics, even though it isn't silent. Griffith uses all his old techniques, with the close-ups, the makeup, the settings, and the unique camera shots to give us another of his great films - only, it's not a silent film and even though it is 1930, the acting is far too stagey for modern tastes. Bear in Mind that films had already started to adapt by 1930, and while some of the biggest hits of the year still harked back to silent days (e.g., ""All Quiet on the Western Front"", ""Disraeli"", ""Anna Christie"", ""The Blue Angel""), others were clearly more modern (e.g., ""Animal Crackers"", ""The Big House"", ""Dawn Patrol"", ""Little Caesar).

This film is definitely worth a viewing for its historical significance, but people interested in Lincoln should look at the 1939 and the 1940 films. Griffith fans will find his earlier films more worthwhile.",1300492800,8,4350,4.813672922252011
2020803,1,B0001NNLT8,the way it sounds in the discription this is a documentary. it is not.in fact it is a silent film that is pure fiction.not something you should get.i wouldnt even give this a one but i have to rate to do the star thing in rateing,1296691200,,229,4.0
2020804,3,B0001NNLT8,"this one last. I'll give you the fact that this is an 80 year old movie directed by an avowed  racist. But Walter Houston's Lincoln was a rather hard drinking brawler. He was lazy & bankrupt. He & Anne Rutledge are courting & she quickly dies. He grieves. Not. soon he is dancing with & propositioning Mary Todd. In this version he is introduced to Mary by his opponent of the future, Stephen Douglas. Soon they are debating (15 years later) & Lincoln is winning the presidency. During the movie the name of Elijah Lovejoy, the noted abolitionist, who was killed in 1837 is invoked (as is Shakespeare), twice. Lincoln is portrayed as a fool. The Civil War is going badly. 600,000 copperheads are massing outside to kill him, (who knew?). Worse, Mary is growing increasingly more irritating. He finds Grant, wins the war & soon is in Ford's theater, giving a combination Gettysburg Address & Inaugural Speech just before he is killed. That's just stupid. Cue the music, The Battle Hymn of the Republic. This was director D.W. Griffith first talkie & the sound is bad, (not his fault),but he was on the decline. Charitably, this movie is a curiosity.",1278720000,,1148,4.711442786069652
2020805,1,B0001NNLT8,In my opinion this DVD was made up by extreme liberals (politically) and they try to make America's First Republican President look like he was a godless man with almost no redeeming values.  I would not recommend this DVD to anyone!,1276560000,6,233,4.682926829268292
2020806,1,B0001NNLT8,"Once again, the History Channel is gathering together different past programs and trying to pass them off as something new!  They have become masters at fleecing people if you don't pay attention.  For instance, there is absolutely NOTHING about Lincoln in the program Sherman's March (I know because I already have it).  So why is it included here????  Buyer beware!",1266278400,9,367,5.066666666666666
2020807,5,B0001NNLT8,"History Channel at its best.  Expecially the John Wilkes Booth DVD.  A must for history buffs, yet interesting for anybody.",1235347200,6,123,5.1
2020808,4,B0001NNLT8,"Here are four discs covering Lincoln's Image (including a fascinating look at the first ""media"" President); Early History; his ""Melancholy"";  Assassination; Civil War strategies; a promo piece on the Abraham Lincoln Libary And Museum (Graphics specialists should enjoy this one).

For those who have watched, beginning to end, these programs on the History Channel, a price of over 30.00 may be a bit steep, although a DVD copy surely enables rewind, slo-mo and freeze-frame which can realy enhance the enjoyment and learning. I think without the promo, a two or three Disc set would have been possible.

There are many Lincoln writers and pundits along the way, including Gore Vidal. I wish we got more or Gore and a bit less on the others. It appears that some of the lesser-known authorities did not have much camera experience and so they are, at times, surprsingly inarticulate. Added to that, they're given alot of close-ups; and their commentary is not essentially done in the form of a voice-over but in those tight shots.
One dude showed up in a short sleeved shirt.

Perhaps a litle too much concentration on the melancholy. Was it congenital...or just normal for a sensitive man who witnessed death after death of people in their prime, as he came up in Kentucky, and found a place at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. The question is asked, should be psycho-analyzing *anyone* in retrospect? Still, they forge ahead. Another somewhat strange section is on Lincoln's ""orientation"". In the 1830s, as a struggling Lawyer, he slept with someone named Joshua Speed, with whom he corresponded for years. Along with all the stories, from other sources, about his running around in his night shirt at the Soldiers Home, or whatever, this detail makes one wonder. But..why?

I especially enjoyed the DVD covering Lincoln's photos and the extensive DVD on General Sherman. If the set goes for 30.00, then about 22.50 of that is worth it, for this incredible exposition.

Audio-video quality and editing is outstanding.",1234224000,13,2012,5.045180722891566
