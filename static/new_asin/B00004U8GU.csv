1354471,5,B00004U8GU,"I have seen Mary Martin in the 60's video and Sandy Duncan live as Peter but when I saw Cathy Rigby live as Peter I discovered she was the best!  Now this contemporary version of the musical is captured for all time in  beautiful color and stereo sound. (Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound on  DVD)
The Tony Award nominee and Olympic gymnast plays the role of Peter  with an English accent and ""boyish"" ways that are just delightful.  Miss  Rigby's rich trained singing voice will definitely surprise you.  Paul  Schoeffler's shenanigans as Captain Hook is hilarious.  The singing and  dancing the pirates and Indians do is just awesome!  Watching the extended  dancing in the ""Ugh-A-Wug"" song was breathtaking.  There's even an added  scene not in the 60's version.  And, of course, the flying is out of this  world!",968371200,53,815,4.797101449275362

1354473,5,B00004U8GU,The production was well done and Cathy Rigby was a unexpectedly good choice for Peter Pan. We watch it every year while we make our wreaths and have lively sing alongs to the stage version of Peter Pan.,1482192000,,202,4.342105263157895

1354476,5,B00004U8GU,"Our 3 year old is absolutely in love with this.  She would watch it 24/7 if we'd let her.  She acts out every scene and she adores the actors.  As a parent having to watch it repetitively I agree it's very good and not annoying at all (for example Disney's Into the Woods drives me absolutely crazy). This Peter Pan production is very very well done. Fantastic actors, costumes, sets and nice non-annoying songs even after watching it for several days straight.",1480550400,2,461,4.597560975609756

Cathy Rigby is fantastic in this well done production. I love this version of Peter Pan as well as the Mary Martin one, and in some ways Cathy Rigby is a better Peter Pan.

1354533,5,B00004U8GU,"As someone that grew up watching Mary Martin as Peter Pan, I was first nervous about branching out to a new Peter. This cast is extraordinary and the numbers are bigger and better than ever. Cathy Rigby is an amazing Peter and this has become one of my favorite films. I think my favorite, though, is Paul Schoeffler as Hook/Mr. Darling. The perfect balance of villain and silliness. Sit and watch the entire Ug-a-Wug number - that's how a dance number is done!",1422748800,,461,4.566265060240964

1354536,5,B00004U8GU,"This movie was made for TV.  It's certainly better than the most recently broadcast version and I think Cathy Rigby is even better at Peter Pan than Mary Martin.  The controversy with this movie is the song Ug A Lug, which is seen as being racist to Native Americans.  And there is a problem with it in terms of standards for modern-day productions.  It was seen as a problem when this production aired on TV.  The newest televised version proclaimed that they had overcome racism by changing the Native Americans to an un-named tribe.  But I don't think it overcame the problem.  They simply shifted the racial mimicry from Native Americans to any aboriginal group (and they looked like Pacific Islanders).  That doesn't make it less racist; it simply changes the subject of the racism.  The Rigby production is grand.  Her ability as a gymnast to work the rope while ""flying"" is superb.  The newest version of Peter Pan pales by comparison and is awkward and clumsy and downright painful.  As a parent, you would have to decide if you find the Ug A Lug scene objectionable.  And is it more objectionable than the original Mary Martin version, or the poorly executed new version? Again, there is little difference between racism in the three, if you really examine it.  What would be best is to have a gymnast do another version.  Make the tribe a multi-racial village and use a drumming sequence that is European or Celtic in rhythm and remove it from ""tribal"" or aboriginal altogether.  Whether you paint it as Native American, South Pacific, tribal, or otherwise, it's still the same racism.",1421020800,,1595,4.766423357664234
1354537,5,B00004U8GU,"I grew up with Mary Martin but this was available digitally through the Library.  After a brief period of suspicion - I like it immensely. Cathy Rigby does an excellent job conveying the boyish, mischievous Peter.  She even walk like a boy!  A gymnist - her flying and dancing are spectacular.  Great job all around. My four and two year old have been requesting to see it daily and I usually allow some Peter Pan version once a week.  We have already seen this one four times.",1420416000,,477,4.436781609195402

1354544,5,B00004U8GU,"I grew up watching Mary Martin fly through the Darling's window as the magical Peter Pan.  I never thought anyone could be as could as she was.  But, Cathy Rigby IS Peter Pan more than any other actress who has played him.  She is indescribably wonderful in the role.  Cathy Rigby played Peter Pan for more than 30 years...longer than any other actress!",1418860800,,353,4.555555555555555
1354545,5,B00004U8GU,"Seriously, Peter Pan's musical is one of the best.  It takes these catchy and well written songs and then, in front of our eyes, puts Peter and the Darling children to flight.  It's like watching a dream while being awake.  Cathy Rigby does one of the best jobs at Peter.  She has that cocky and arrogant manner about Peter that makes him both lovable, naive and a silly ass.

Paul Schoeffler's performance as Hook is the BEST of all time.  He can sing his heart out and even as Mr. Darling has an emotionally gripping quality about him.  Seeing him in a few other Broadway performances (his Javert in les Miserables will be on par with the best of all time), we know he's a great actor and this just proves it more.",1418774400,,716,4.338345864661654

I was surprised to see how well she acted and sang the role. Great casting choice. As big fans of musical theater we enjoyed watching as a family.

1354611,2,B00004U8GU,"Since the original Mary Martin/Cyril Richard/Jerome Robbins broadcast seems unaccountably unavailable (which is a crime) this production starring Cathy Rigby is the only choice available to those wishing to see a live musical theatrical version, as opposed to a cartoon.  I saw the original on Broadway as a ten year old - and happily own the  TV broadcast of the original version on VHS but curiosity got the better of me and I just purchased the Rigby version. I will admit I was not  predisposed to liking it and have been mostly proven correct in that - except for Ms. Rigby herself who much to my surprise is a very fine Peter Pan, if one of an entirely different species from Mary Martin.  Rigby is almost disconcertingly boyish, much more so than Mary Martin.  Her gymnastic/dance ability is of  an entirely different,  far more accomplished, order from Mary Martin's and her acting in certain moments, particularly those in which Peter is sad or bereft are quite moving.  That being said, everything else about this production is a horror.  It is  technological show biz at its worst: showy and soulless.

Where to begin?  Well the worst aspects first.
- As many others here have commented, Rigby is obviously lip synching her songs.  That is bad enough but even worse is that the audience response is similarly canned, manipulated and artificial.  That is a true outrage. If we aren't even allowed to hear  a genuine response from the audience how are we expected to be involved in what they are watching?

- I do not find it at all charming to have older actors playing the lost boys rather than , as in the original, true boys, nor do I find any advantage in having the Indians being men as well as women. The original gender specificity of the lost boys being boys and the indians all being girls made the story much more delightful even if there was no logic to it.

-  Most serious of all, this lovely, ageless fairy tale of a story has been, in this production, tarted up - and to my mid completely destroyed - by the high powered, technically over the top, needlessly virtuosic choreography of Patti Columbo.  The credit at the top of the show misleadingly says it is a Jerome Robbins direted and choreographed production when it is nothing of the kind. Robbins was one of this country's greatest choreographers, as accomplished in ballet as on Broadway and yet he understood that choreography should be suited to the subject, and ought not run roughshod over it.  This is known in some circles as taste. a quality utterly lacking here.  This production's choreography is obscenely showy, replete with needlessly difficult technical stunts  and completely obscures the delight, charm and sheer silliness that Robbins' genius applied to the tale. Here we are subjected to a cheap effort at achieving  ""wow"" factor that is self defeating. Triple pirouettes in this context are not charming in the slightest .

I am an actor singer myself and admit that, although I have never had the opportunity to play Hook, it has always been one of my life long dreams.  However if this version had been the only version I had seen, playing Hook would never have entered my mind!  This Hook is a bore.  He is merely a scene chewer and not a very pleasant one at that, with no sense of the utter joy, wit and charm that Cyril Richard made such an indelible part of the role.  That is perhaps the single saddest aspect to this entire production.

My advice: by Hook or by crook, find some way to get ahold of the Mary Martin/Cyril Richard/Jerome Robbins version.  It's not showy.  In some ways - compared to this one - it is crude.  It's not glitzy, it is simple. And quite silly. And thus utterly charming.

I perhaps have overused the word charm in this review, but charming is what Peter Pan is, or else why mount it at all?

The Jerome Robbins Peter Pan, precisely because of its charm, is moving, and in it's understanding of what makes a show like Peter Pan worthwhile it is a sad example of how the love and respect for the art of theater which used to be the norm has given way to a pursuit of commerce which today often destroys what was best in our past.

1354636,5,B00004U8GU,"After a new production on Broadway was launched with Sandy Duncan assuming the role from Mary Martin, producers went back to the drawing board and cast Cathy Rigby, the Olympic Gymnast. Gone was the TV perinnal that started on Broadway with Mary Martiin, who is now only remembered as the Mother of Dallas star, Larry Hagman, with less tecnically advanced production values. Shown yearly on NBC, you can actually see the wires attached to Ms. Martin's harness and costume. Although Ms. Rigby had no trainning or desire to be an actress, producers spent time helping her to acquire the skills to star in this production, which was taped for A&E. Although another viewer cited faults, she claimed she saw like lip-synching, I did not notice this. What is different about this production, is that all the actors use an English accent unlike the Martin version. Even the adults in the audience were captivated by Ms. Rigby as Peter. The new actor assuming the role of Captain  Hook did an excellent job. He did not scare children in an unrealistic way Cyril Richard, the original did. Ms. Rigby has continued to reprise the role in a touring production around Christmastime to the enjoyment of children and adults. I enjoyed seeing this production. Although I have mentioned Ms. Martin in this review, I can accept Ms. Rigby's interpretation of the role. What comes next is a new production by NBC, with an unnamed cast at this point.

This production was good, but Cathy Rigby is not the actress that Mary Martin was. She looks rather old and worn, although her flying was, of course, fabulous. The lost boys were all very old in this production and generally a little unbelievable. Captain Hook was no Cyril Ritchard, but he was very good. All in all, a pretty good substitute for a classic.

I fell in love with Paul Schoeffler as Captain Hook.  His voice is captivating (one of the best I have ever heard) and his performance is beyond wonderful.  The flying scenes are magical in part due to improved technology since the 1950's. The adventures in Neverland are filled with fun, fancy and danger. My 5 year old grand daughter is a Tinkerbell fanatic and has seen the many animated Disney movies.  She was enthralled with this version of Peter Pan as we sat together and clapped our hands till they burned to save Tinkerbell.

1354705,3,B00004U8GU,"Some clunky details to get through before filming:

Cathy Rigby was not a singer.
Nor a dancer.
Show based on the English concept of ""pantomime"" which traditionally has the lead boy played by an adult woman, and adults playing children.
JM Barrie had no idea what an ""Indian"" was, much less a ""Native American.""
Tradition of Mr. Darling also playing Hook comes from bored actor realizing he had nothing to do in the second act if he didn't double up his parts, not psychology.

Solutions:
Lip-synching.
MORE FLYING!
Get used to the idea that people will complain.
Give ""Indians"" more to do! And female ""Indians"" less clothing.
Let people think it's a psychological decision. Who cares as long as they buy tickets?

Rigby moves well and is wiry. When she's not straining to follow the track, she is an excellent actor. She looks like hexx though. Not just that she is thin, but tired tired tired--the airbrushing on the CD Case was so severe as to make me think it was a painting. I hope she feels better now.  Anyway, the lip-synching severely hurt the acting. As a sometimes actor and dancer, I know it is a burden to have to follow a track. The acting would have been better and more natural had they not been lip-synching, but they had to do this to get Cathy Rigby (I have read that she has since learned to sing).

Wendy and her brothers were well-acted and fun. Hook was appropriately creepy. Jane was excellent; it was such a small role and she was amazing in conveying the joy of freedom and the heartbreak her freedom will cause her mother.

I don't care that the lost ""boys"" are played by adults when the main character is a 12 year old boy played by a 40 some year old woman. I don't care that they didn't get real Indians--should they have found real pirates, too? I do care that the fun, spontanaety, joy of a live performance was only halfway there.  I do care that my daughter is getting her idea of Indians from this show.  I can't forbid her to watch it for the racism, nor can I find much that is both less racist and as much fun for her to watch. Parents of young children will know that if a child likes something, he or she wants to watch it often, maybe endlessly.)

There were exuberent moments, though, and the orchestra interpreted the score beautifully. The pirates were a little scary but mostly funny, especially in the tango.  A fun show and worth the money but a long way from perfect.",1317945600,2,2415,4.45578231292517
1354706,3,B00004U8GU,"Some roles are ""owned"" by the stars. Mary Martin IS Peter pan. Although it is a valiant effort, Cathy Rigby is not Mary Martin.  Also, Cyril Richard is a far-better (and funnier) Capt. Hook than in this new version, where the Capt. is quite scary (for the little ones) and sinister. All this aside, the performance was quite good for a revival, as the acrobatics (flying) and technical staging is far superior to the NBC-1960 version by Mary Martin, which, sadly, is not currently ""in-print"" except for a few ""bootleg"" versions out there.

Cathy sings and performs very well and the audience seemed to be enjoying themselves. Not for very young children under age 5--see Capt. Hook comments. However, Ms. Rigby is ""so much more older than 20"" and appears quite ""haggard"" and old-looking in her video camera close ups. She should have make this when she was younger.

Be sure that you get a good copy. My DVD copy ""froze"" during the last 10 minutes of the program and had to be returned as defective. In 10 years, I have only had 2 actually ""bad"" DVD's that refused to play and/or couldn't be cleaned, etc. (I own about 100 DVD's and several playback units.)",1317772800,,1157,4.634146341463414

The one kind of left out is ""Mysterious Lady"" written according to Comden & Green especially for Martin's voice, which alas and no matter Rigby doesn't have.  The official review of this show makes three mistakes.  There are no new songs.  Rigby only swings out and back over the audience twice and that during the bows.  And I personally am sick of things being nauseously branded ""family entertainment"" - like that alone should make you rush out and buy 12 copies.  One for each kid. I have only one complaint about this show.  It needed Cyril Ritchard.  As poppa Darling the guy in this production was fine.  As Hook - I was bored and irritated.  He was too fierce and hard and angry.  Especially for the lyrics of his songs.  Lyrics.  I think some of them were changed.  Maybe not, I don't know.

The use of adults in too many of the childrens roles greatly detracts from the charm of the story. Wendy seems positively middle aged here.

1354721,2,B00004U8GU,"I must agree with a few others on here that I was disappointed with this version of 'Peter Pan'.

PROS:

-Cathy Rigby's skill as an olympic gymnast really gave Peter a great element of athleticism. Great voice and fun actress.

-Scenic design and set design all really nicely done, a bit predictable, but predictable is what an audience wants to see when they to to a production of 'Peter Pan'

CONS:

-The cuts! Like others have said, this production is totally rushed and they made some weird cuts.

-The face value acting doesn't go deep enough into the characters. While all these performers are skilled individuals, I was not impressed with their acting. However, this could be partially the fault of the director as well.

-The lip synching was a huuuuuuge disappointment!

-I don't understand what the deal is with the adults playing lost boys. Yes, adult performers can often perform more sophisticated choreography, but a certain nostalgia and innocence is brought to the production when actual kids are invovled.

With all that said, I think that kids would love this video. However, as a musical theatre student there are several shortcomings to this production overall. Nice musical, so-so interpretation. :)",1135209600,13,1220,5.029850746268656

Fortunately, my mom says I am allowed to get the DVD and even at 17, I'll still watch it! I hope I can enjoy the DVD without seeing Cathy Rigby perform live at MSG. (sniffle...) I also hope that many people can look at Cathy Rigby's performance and know that with this DVD, she's doing the show forever!",1131494400,,566,4.25

1354727,5,B00004U8GU,As a boomer I always thought Mary Martin's version of Peter Pan was the standard to measure against until I saw the Cathy Rigby version. There is a sense of adventure that Rigby captures with an acting ability that genuinely surprised me. Add to the mix Rigby's gymnastic ability and you see a Peter probably as close to ideal as possible. Paul Schoeffler as Hook puts in a great performance as well. Definitely not the way Cyril Richard did it.,1113264000,,445,4.575
1354728,4,B00004U8GU,"This version of Peter Pan - a filmed stage performance - is far better than the Mary Martin version of the 1960's.  Cathy Rigby uses her gymnastic abilities (she was, at one time, a member of the USA Olympic Team) to enhance the Peter Pan character, and her nautral innocence and charm make the show delightful and easy to love.

Everything is better (compared to the MM production).  The performers who portray the Darling children are (here) well trained actors and singers, and the lost boys are the same.  The story is made to make more sense (the marooner's rock scene is included, for example) and the sets are far more elaborate and believable.

The guy who plays Mr. Darling/Captain Hook is a top-notch performer with an excellent set of pipes.  Here and there, he is a tad aloof (as if being an entertainer is beneath him), but he's fun, and adds to the overall quality of this ... gem of a movie.

But Cathy Rigby is the star.  She soars, and she takes the show with her.  She is a delight, a pure delight (even when she bullies the lost boys).

The only shortfall (to me) is the handling of the indians.  They are not fun.  Peter is fun.  Wendy, Michael, and John are fun.  The lost boys are fun.  And even the pirates are fun.  But the indians here are made to be serious indians ... and are not fun.

Gone too is the cute dance that introduced the indians in the MM production.  And the peace pipe scene (""I'll just send for Tiger Lily ... And I'll send for Peter Pan"") is now an over-produced example of a choreographer gone mad.

But this is an excellent movie for the whole family.  And Cathy Rigby shines as the boy who won't grow up.  Not bad for an old balance beam girl.",1074729600,,1690,4.335463258785943

1354730,4,B00004U8GU,"I only saw this production because I happened to find a VHS tape of it in a clearance rack in my local video store (and bought it for next-to-nothing). It is a new staging of the Broadway musical from the 1950's; this does not minimize its impact in any way, but there are many reviewers who feel the need to make excessive (and in my opinion unfounded) comparisons between this production and the original one with Mary Martin- when, in fact, it is the same show. I have copies of both performances and primarily treasure the Martin production because of its historical significance as a time capsule of early television. This version with Olympic gymnast Cathy Rigby version is brilliant; its presentation differs from the 1960 one as they captured an actual performance from a theater with an audience rather than tape on a network sound stage. As someone else noted, Ms. Rigby's mannerisms and costuming better capture that of an impish boy than Ms. Martin's (although I didn't care for Ms. Rigby's attempt at a British accent). The point is they each do it a little differently, Ms. Rigby opting for more exuberance and athleticism; watch especially the ""I Gotta Crow"" scenes with her tumbling all over the stage and the ""Ugg-A-Wug"" dance and drum challenge with the Indians. The book itself is a bit corny (doesn't matter which version), but chances are you're watching it with your own children or re-living your own childhood- and that's sort of the point. The Act 1 finale which shows Peter and the Darling clan fly out the window is stunning. Plan to lose yourself for two hours, and you'll probably believe you can fly when it's over.",1056672000,,1645,4.755244755244755

Three of the Lost Boys were played by girls but I am use to seeing girls get male leads. Well my eye was on Slightly and Twin # 2 (due to them being the only boys). I have to say (Forgive this Mary) the 1955 version sucked!! Cons are listed below
CONS
1. Way older actors!
2. The Lost Boys didn't even sing (Poor things)
3. The choregraphy was awful (God Bless the choregrapher for this one)
4. The sets were too colorufl (Bink) nice try set designers
5. Mary Martin can't sing even if her life depended on it.
I just love this new improved version, that's why I recorded over my Mary Martin version tape. I took one little glance and said sorry ain't gonna miss you and recorded Three Men And A Baby. The day I got this I was thinking Mom don't put me through the Peter Pan stage (Thinking it was awful one like the other tape). Still when it got in the VCR I was stunned with oh's and awe's. Now today 13 years old I still love this movie I own the soundtrack that way when I am not watching the movie and I can still hear the music. The first time I heard the Lost Boys sing I was shocked and up dancing with them. I almost know all the dance moves. I like the upper-body person so when I saw Slightly lay Wendy down (Which might I add he held her) I was thinking oh,a strong boy I like that. Ten tons better then the oringinal lock yourself up if you haven't got the point yet. I am looking forward to getting this on DVD for Easter (Hope I will that is).

Secondly, the first Disney version of ""Peter Pan"" was wonderful, BUT everyone should STAY AS FAR AWAY AS POSSIBLE FROM ""RETURN TO NEVERLAND""!!  It's downright gory and Sir James M.

The differences between the Mary Martin and Cathy Rigby adaptations came from the book, not any director's imagination.  They are both such fun to watch, as is the original Disney animated version.

1354734,5,B00004U8GU,"The classic Broadway and television musical PETER PAN has come back to life thanks to acclaimed gymnast and Broadway star Cathy Rigby, who has made the role her own in several Broadway incarnations and national tours over the last decade.
Cathy Rigby's PETER PAN maintains the spirit and integrity of the much-loved Mary Martin version but adds a few modern touches to keep in step with theatregoers. Choreographer Patti Colombo offers a breathtaking new STOMP-like spin to the ""Ugg-A-Wugg"" musical number, and takes advantage of Rigby's history as an Olympic gymnast in the ""I'm Flying"" ballet.
Filmed before a live audience during a performance at the La Mirada Theatre, this new PETER PAN features an impressive supporting cast headed by Paul Schoeffler in the traditional dual-roles of Mr Darling and Captain Hook. Elisa Sagardia plays a delightful Wendy and Barbara McCulloh is a touching Mrs Darling as well as a cunning Mermaid in the Marooner's Rock scene.
Dana Solimando plays both maid Liza as well as Tiger Lily (which sadly means the omission of ""Liza's Ballet"" which was a highlight in the Mary Martin version). Aileen Quinn (who played the title role in the film version of ANNIE as well as the Canon MovieTales version of THE FROG PRINCE) makes a welcome appearance as Lost Boy Tootles. Drake English and Barry Cavanagh play Wendy's younger siblings John and Michael.

Paul Shoeffler does an absolutly histarical job portraying the evil Capt. Hook. The sets and special effects will amaze you over and over again. The whole cast is great. This is one musical you can watch over and over without getting bored. The flying provided by ZFX Flying Illusions is amazing (You can barely see the strings.)

I enjoyed Cathy Rigby's Peter Pan so much more than Mary Martin, simple because of the more humourous approach taken. Rigby portrays Pan as very boyish and cocky (pushing the other ""lost boys"" around), just like the book. More lines from the book were taken too. Also, she performs flips during her flying sequences which add a lot of thrill to the movie, even at home, and there is no sign of the wires. The dancing scenes and the choreography is excellent (as seen through an amatuer dancer's eyes), especially the Stomp-like drumstick use in Ugg-a-Wugg. The cast selections were great, especially Paul Schoeffner(?) as Captain Hook. Elisa Sagardia clearly shows you that Wendy is very attracted to Peter. However, the lack of wider shots can sometimes be frustrating, as you don't get the full effect. Also, Drake English, who plays Michael, can sometimes make his lines indistinguishable and you can only guess at what he's saying. However, I recommend this version to anyone out there. And remember, I'm 15.

The Uga-awug-wa dance and drum sticks chorus with the Indians, lost boys, and Peter is great and makes you want to get up and dance with them. Cathy can play that drum too.  The flying sequences are just awsome and best of all you don't see the cables which, unfortunately, you do in the TV version with Martin. How a California girl can talk like a true cockney and make you believe it is astounding.  You'd sware she'd been born in Soho.

WHY did the producers feel the need to take the simple, charming, and exquisitly structured book and revise it, adding humorless schtick and confusing plot devicesw (aka: the mermaids and that whole rock scene)?  WHY did the director consistantly choose to go for the cheap laugh instead of keeping with the natural charm and humor of the original version?  WHY was the choreography so chaotic and bland?  WHY did the producers feel the need to butcher every song they touched with new vocal arrangements, such as the increasingly tedious ""echos"" in ""I'm Flying""?  Cathy Rigby proves a worthy successor to Mary Martin, but the rest of the cast, particualrly Cpatain Hook, does not do nearly as well by comparison to the original production, and Rigby simply isn't good enough to carry the production by herself.

Too many times you can clearly see that Ms. Rigby is lip synching the songs. Though this might make for a better tape, there are times when you hear her voice but her mouth has stopped moving. The biggest disappointment was the fact that the video version did not have the sequence showing when the Darling nursery stage set ""breaks apart"", and the stage is transformed into a vision of a star filled night as Peter Pan and the children fly off to NeverLand.

The picture quality and sound on this DVD is superb. The set is far more advanced and impressive than the original Mary Martin version. The flying is more real and breathtaking also. Cathy Rigby soars over the stage beautifully, showing off talent in flips and turns through the air. As other reviewers have said before, there are some annoying differences if you are used to the orignal version. First of all, Cathy Rigby can not compare to Mary Martin. She is more masculine and can't carry a tune as well as her predessor. She seems to be more of a mean character in this version, pushing the lost boys around, well in this case they arn't really boys, and her voice isn't as playful as Mary's. I think Richard Cyril (or whoever played the original Hook) was somewhat better and more memorable.  I like the added sequence of Marooner's Rock with neat mermaids and flowing water. I don't like how they used a much younger Mrs. Darling, she seems to be 25. Here, Smee is also a bit young for the character, he could easily pass for 20. As I said, the lost boys arn't really boys, but older guys, which is a disappointment. I would like to see the scene changes as if watching a live production, but they are not shown in this film. You can see the audience clapping along and credits come on the screen, telling of the name of the different scenes or rather where they take place. And sadly, Liza, (the nanny lady) never gets to go to Neverland as the original. Tiger Lily's dance is not as fun. But overall I would say this is a very good revival of a classic. I give it 5 stars for it is amazing in its own right, but compared to the original it falters a bit. Defintately pick this one up if you loved the original, or have never seen it. It is an incredible performance to enjoy with the family.",971568000,2,1934,4.3397790055248615

My children were mesmerized with the movie and beleive me it is very hard to make them sit through a 30 minute show let alone a show with commercials for two hours. They wanted me to order it right then so they could watch it all over again the next day. ** SUPERB **",971395200,,385,3.8860759493670884
1354749,5,B00004U8GU,"I had the pleasure of seeing this production in Dallas on its way to Broadway, and just finished viewing the DVD.  I've hoped for some time that the Rigby version would be filmed, and I'm not disappointed!  I also love the Mary Martin (I grew up with it), but the Rigby version is much closer to the original play that James M. Barrie wrote, and to Peter and Wendy, the book which followed.  Rigby's Peter is boyish, cocky, sometimes rude and unthinking - not always sweet.  This is the way James Barrie originally wrote the character!  The relationship with Wendy, and Peter's refusal to grow up (a somewhat tragic decision, as it means he must eventually lose Wendy, or any other chance at a real relationship) is front and center, as it should be.  The Indians are a British child's dream of Native Americans, again, much more like Barrie wrote them.  There are scenes in this version that have been in no other (Marooner's Rock), and the flying and other special effects are absolutely superb!  In addition, the DVD features the entire stage production --- the broadcast version on A&E cut some scenes, but they are present in the DVD (I don't know about the video).  The background information about the production is also very interesting.  A great version of Peter Pan - probably the closest we have to the original story --- adventure, magic, fun - and some of the deeper shadings (what we gain and lose by ""growing up"") that are overlooked in most versions.  Highly recommended!",971395200,6,1487,4.702702702702703
1354750,5,B00004U8GU,Many of you have seen Mary Martin's version of the play. That seemed like nothing after I saw Cathy Rigby's live. This dvd version has even more than the live version. It even has a scene at the mermaid lagoon which only happened in the Disney cartoon. Get this dvd today. You won't regret it.,971049600,,293,4.345454545454546
