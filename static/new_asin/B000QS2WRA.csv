This is a good film, showing the harsh reality for these Filipino fishermen, as well the relationships between Cesar Montano's characters and those around him - his crew, father, girlfriend and how he deals with the pressures of providing for all of these. Good underwater photography and direction.",1454976000,,452,4.87012987012987
8197206,4,B000QS2WRA,"Well, Cesar Montano has done it again.  I see why he and this film won so many awards.  Cesar plays the Captain of a huge fishing vessel where the majority of the crew are young kids, but some adults too.  They are all seasonally hired to live on his boat and fish day in day out.  Ah, but no fishing poles.  They are all manual fishermen, fisher kids.  They dive, holding their breath, and bang rocks on the reefs to scare the fish into the big vertical nets that are rigged.  Then the huge nets are wrapped up like a giant burrito, but now I am digressing.  Granted the cinematography is real, gritty, and in your face.  At times I felt claustrophobic and anxious for the characters that spent so much time underwater.  This is just the backdrop, there is actually several plot lines that develop simultaneously & culminate into one big fantastic ending.  I'm not going to give anything away.  Just get this DVD and watch it.  You won't regret buying it.  I've watched this movie literally 4 times since it's come out.  It's that good and Mr. Montano is a very skilled and talented actor, director, writer.  He's becoming the Clint Eastwood of the Philippines.  In fact, I haven't seen a bad Cesar Montano movie.  Check him out in the Great Raid, a Hollywood production movie (true story).  Muro Ami is Cesar's Ben Hur or Titanic.  Don't be discouraged that it's in Filipino language, there are English subtitles to help you.",1334016000,,1427,4.565217391304348
8197207,5,B000QS2WRA,"This Filipino movie was surprisingly not as melodramatic as most other Filipino flicks tend to be.  The production style made the story realistic, believable, and entertaining.  It's akin to ""Whale Rider"" - a strong cultural background and situation with odd plot lines that make the movie interesting to watch.  This movie will make you hold your breath as you witness the underwater drama  - reality  - of muro-ami.",1239062400,2,417,5.073529411764706
