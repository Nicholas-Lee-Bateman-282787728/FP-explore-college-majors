2900260,5,B000TGUUDW,Loved the instruction.  Good tips along the way.  Definitely a workout!  I can't wait to use in my classes.  Thank you.,1356220800,,119,4.523809523809524
2900261,5,B000TGUUDW,"I own three of the Budokon DVD's and watch them all the time. Very clear instructions with variable methods for people who may find some of more challenging movements too difficult. Cameron is an excellent instructor and Budokon is the finest mind, body, spirit series I have ever seen.",1322352000,3,286,4.857142857142857
2900262,4,B000TGUUDW,"I am an advanced beginner in yoga. I workout a lot and enjoy mixing up my workout often. I had tried the beginner budokon and really liked it. After reading several reviews on this workout I decided it was for me. When it came, I did watch and try all the moves before doing the workout. There were several moves that I thought there was no way I could perform, then I did. I was quite pleased with myself:) I now do this workout at least twice a week and am becoming more fluent. It was intimidating at first due to the quickness of his instruction. It actually made me nervous at first and I had difficulty hitting moves because of my anxiety. Now I don't get so caught up in the quickness of his instruction and try to focus more on proper technique. I love this workout and would definitely recommend it for those who are already fit, but would like to work muscles you might not be working already.",1283212800,3,903,4.286549707602339
2900263,5,B000TGUUDW,yeaaaaaaaaaaaa.  this is great.  more intense than regular yoga.  will build strength and balance.  wish i had this when i was playing ball it would of helped better than straight lifting and running,1271376000,,199,4.9393939393939394
2900264,5,B000TGUUDW,"I have waited years for a combination Yoga/ Karate workout dics and am extremely happy to have found the Budokan series.  I bought the Strength and Balance disc and it is just what I need for my Karate.

The disc starts with a slow Yoga warm up and then moves to a quick moving Yoga sequence.  The moves are unusual but through the ingenious use of DVD technology there are tutorials you can click to and then continue your workout without using menus.

Just when you're all lathered up, there is a nice martial arts kicking sequence.  The kicks are performed such that you don't leave your yoga mat.  Very nice.

This is a great workout that really works the whole body with a focus on the legs.  Lots of one leg Yoga work which is great for the martial arts.

This is a great product that has been well thought out from workout to program structure.  I look forward to buying the other 2 discs and wish I had bought the set for the savings.",1235606400,6,942,4.301136363636363
2900265,3,B000TGUUDW,"I've been doing yoga for years but found this workout extremely difficult. The instructor moves very fast(too fast) between moves and unless you're capable of balancing your entire weight on your arms you won't be able to fully complete or keep up. A much better workout is Brian Kest's Power Yoga series; very challenging, but great instruction.",1202860800,6,346,5.087719298245614

2900267,5,B000TGUUDW,"You have to try this Budokon stuff...took a class, tried it, now love it.  Can't get enough.  Much more fun and active than Yoga.  It's like Billy Blanks doing yoga, very cool stuff.",1190160000,2,182,4.454545454545454

8209386,5,B000TGUUDW,"My favorite dvd workout that I do at home. I love taking the time during the warmup to focus my energy correctly before starting. I've been a fan of the budokon series and pick it up eery 6 months or so... I get bored easily - zumba for 3 months, then switch to turbo kick, then hot yoga, ballet/barre, then machines and weight lifting. Budokon has its place in my lineup. This  strength & balance dvd is tough, but I can make it all the way through. The other budokon dvds are so strenuous I don't always make it to the end. Which is perfect! Great to be challenged from a home workout in this manner. I would say if you have never attended intermediate yoga classes before, take it very easy until you are comfortable with how well your body can morph into his moves.",1447545600,,769,4.267123287671233
8209387,5,B000TGUUDW,"Fast shipping, nice hard workout!",1437004800,,33,5.8
8209388,5,B000TGUUDW,Amazing!! The yoga moves are fast but energetic! Some of them where new to me so I had to back a few times but still a really great workout and stress reliever ! :),1432080000,,164,3.8529411764705883
8209389,4,B000TGUUDW,Fun and challenging with a cardio aspect because it keeps you moving in shapes your body hasn't been in since you were a toddler if ever.. It keeps you moving. Its not yoga nor is it really martial arts. You will be upside down thinking how did I get here and where am I going next?,1421280000,,282,4.053571428571429
8209390,3,B000TGUUDW,"The instructor is annoying and reminds me of the dude from napoleon dynamite - you know, the fight instructor? American flag pants? Just kinda goofy overall. I did sweat though.",1409788800,,177,4.933333333333334
8209391,5,B000TGUUDW,Great job visually and cueing.  Would suggest showing modifications but still a great dvd. Would recommend this to yoga and martial arts students,1361923200,,145,5.304347826086956
