1099399,3,6305908532,"Missile To The Moon is what you might call the poor man's version of Cat-Women Of the Moon, sans way-out cat-dance.  The revamped version with its two younger leads, who are escaped convicts, obviously intended to cash in on the Rebel Without A Cause wave that was going around at the time.  Now we get some rock creatures you will almost swear have happy-smiling faces when you see them for the first time.  The spacesuits are nothing more than airforce fighter pilot uniforms with snow boots.  There is also a spider in this one, but instead of strings, it is a cable that is shamelessly unhidden this time.  Whereas Cat-Women had the potential to evoke a feeling of bitter-sweetness, the moon women are swanky and decadent.  The Alpha character is played by this Miss Yugoslavia pageant winner--stunning eye candy, but not nearly as sinister as the original Alpha.  Because the moon women's costumes are somewhat more revealing and somehow also lend to the ladies more inactivity than the cat-women, this in effect seems to spoil what should have the dreamy ambiance of mystery that was so nearly successfully captured in Cat-Woman.  Because the issues of species survival has shifted more towards species dominance, it is also hard to sympathize with the moon women when Leto first reveals their plight.  As for the DVD itself, the transfer is respectable.  The extras comprise of a pretty nifty collection of behind-the scenes photos.  All in all, it is a good purchase--if you can find it used for under 7$.",1151452800,,1513,4.87109375
1099400,3,6305908532,"'Missile To The Moon' was released in '59, I was seven at the time. The first time I watched this film was on television, it was one of those ""Movies of the Week"" where it ran every night, Monday thru Friday at 8 o'clock, Saturday afternoon and twice on Sunday. I didn't miss a single showing.

Hey what did you expect, what little kid could resist a flight to the Moon, frightening rock monsters, a giant cave spider on strings and some very lovely Moon Maidens in form fitting tops and stretch pants. It was like heaven. I didn't particularily like the fact that these lovely lunar ladies where able to control humans through mind control, but I guess that was something I would learn to accept when I grew older (THAT'S A JOKE!).

Bad special effects, low budget, silly script, but lots of fun! However after all these years I still hate that stupid spider for eating Pat Mowry, my favorite Moon Maiden.",1146614400,6,906,4.5182926829268295

Ahem.... anyway, MISSILE TO THE MOON involves a team of space explorers (including two escaped cons) who land on the moon, get chased by lumbering rock-monsters, and find a cave filled w/ precious oxygen (!). Not only this, but the cave leads to a hidden city populated by beautiful models in high-heels and one-piece bathing suits! Their leader, or ""Lido"", is a cross between Auntie Mame, Liberache, and Medusa in her titanic head-dress! Cathy Downs, the lone female earthling, is vexed and intimidated by the moon's high estrogen level. She must fight for her man while looking smart in her pearl necklace and earrings!

1099402,4,6305908532,"I will admit I liked Cat-Women on the Moon better, so that's the reason I give this one four stars. I think CWOTM had a much better cast. Anyway, the plot of this movie is pretty similar, the atmosphere on the moon is depleting and the moon maidens have killed off everyone who is expendable to lengthen their air supply. One can only assume the great 'Lido' chose who lived and died.
The wayward travelers from Earth are: the scientist who built the ship, his assistant and his girlfriend, and finally two escaped convicts. None of them can really act, the worst of which is the James Dean wannabe convict. Although the convicts are fun to watch as they become experts rather quickly at flying a rocket.
Well we got a giant spider. If it was a child's project, youwould say it was wonderful. The rock monsters are pretty cool and original. True they look like giant Gumbys, but just take it in stride.
I hate to give away the ending to this deep plot, but sunlight on the moon still kills and there is a power struggle between the Lido and her succesor that leads to disaster. Enjoy.",1080172800,,1084,4.452261306532663
1099403,3,6305908532,"From the Wade Williams Collection and Image Entertainment, we get the definitive science fiction space extravaganza of 1959 (can you sense the sarcasm?  I'm laying it on pretty thick here) directed by Richard E. Cunha, the man responsible for such cinematic schlock as She Demons (1958), Frankenstein's Daughter (1958), and Giant from the Unknown (1958).  This film is actually a remake of 1953's Cat-Women of the Moon, which wasn't done by Cuhna.  This movie has nearly everything, from lovely international beauty contestant winners cast as moon maidens, a spiffy rocket ship, less than exciting space travel, meteors, rock monsters, lunar caves fraught with danger (and breathable atmosphere, go figure), diamonds as big as your fist, a giant, hairy spider with big, pointy teeth, and even a catfight...what it doesn't have; a coherent plot, decent special effects, a lucid script, good characterizations, realistic sets, or passable acting, but, in the world of B movies, this one certainly stands out.

Okay, here's the deal.  Seems a scientist has built a missile he intends to fly to the moon.  The government, seeing the value and advanced state of his work, decides to take over the project, much to the scientists' dismay.  He pouts a lot and makes a lot of statements you'd expect from a petulant child who doesn't get his way.  Meanwhile, two criminals have escaped from prison, and have taken refuge within the moon missile.  The scientist discovers them, and decides to convince them, at gunpoint, to help him fly his missile to the moon before the government takes away his cardboard spacecraft...er, I mean futuristic, atomic powered spacecraft.  The scientists' assistant and his fianc get caught on the ship, and all five blast off into the great unknown of space.  After some danger involving meteors and such, this unlikely group reaches the moon.  There they encounter some rock monsters that seem not to like people as they begin to attack our unlikely, yet plucky, cosmic travelers.  It's funny watching the scenes with the rock monsters as all involved try to create tension and a sense of danger as one actor shouts out, ""Look out!  They're trying to surround us!"" but the rock monster suits provide very little mobility causing the horrific creatures to move at a snails pace, allowing for even the most feeble to escape easily, that is unless someone trips...they take refuge in a cave, and soon find themselves transported to a lunar city, which we never really get to see, filled with a bevy of beautiful moon maidens.  I can see why the scientist wanted to get here so badly, as there are no men, only bunches of lunar babes, ripe for the picking.  Stuff happens, words are said, and soon we learn of the imminent danger the lunar women, and a catfight happens somewhere around here.  Oh yeah, there's a wonderful scene where the scrappy space travelers are in a cave, and the order is given to release 'the Dark Ones'.  As a really fake looking grate rises to a section of the cave, the suspense builds, and finally....nothing..oh wait!  A big, hairy spider!  And a particularly frisky one at that, based on what he's doing to that moon maiden...  What happens next?  Well, I don't want to give away too much, but it's all pretty predictable.

There's plenty of fun to be had here for lovers of campy movies.  The disc contains a very decent print of the film, which does have minor, expected flaws, but the black and white looks crisp, and the audio is very clear.  The only special feature is a photo gallery of mostly the beauty contestant winners in their moon maiden garb.  I thoroughly enjoyed this better than average presentation of a late 50's sci-fi camp fest, but I was also glad that its' run time was only 77 minutes as Hollywood cheese is good, if taken in moderation.

1099404,3,6305908532,pretty cheesy movie even though it is very old.  not to bad if you like old classics.,1021852800,,85,4.0
1099405,4,6305908532,"Missile to the Moon is basically a remake of Cat Women of the Moon (even reusing that giant spider) and just as much el cheapo fun as that film. I love the school-play-quality sets and props, amateurish acting, laughable dialogue, etc., (in short, everything you want in a Bad Film). For some reason the Moon Queen has ancient Mayan art hanging on her wall! (Attention Graham Hancock.) And those clumsy rock creatures are some of the most underrated 50s ""monsters"" (for originality if nothing else). Let's be honest here though: this is not a lunatic mess like Plan 9 or The Creeping Terror. It suffers from a bit too much technical competence to really achieve ""warp"" factor, yet remains a solid 70 minutes for crummy movie enthusiasts.
The DVD presentation is quite a bit above average for this type of movie. First, despite some minor speckling and a few damaged frames here and there, the print used is spectacular: good tonal scale, nice and sharp, clear sound. Overall, much better than one would expect. (In some scenes you can even see the creases on the backdrops.) There is no trailer included (unusual for Image), although you do get chapter stops and a special bonus ""photo gallery"" of dozens of someone's behind-the-scenes shots taken on and around the set, including many stills (some in color) of the ""Moon Maidens"" posing alluringly. Not exactly ""the special edition,"" but a nice, atypical bonus for a set like this. C-movie nerds, grab this, you won't be disappointed. One star less than perfect 'cause no trailer and the (very minor) speckling and print damage.",999302400,19,1579,4.87360594795539
1099406,4,6305908532,"This is a classic in the ""so bad it's good"" canon. Almost every aspect of this film is poorly realized, and it thereby has a kind of sub-genre ""purity"" about it. The special effects are far from acceptable under any other circumstances. Costumes are a camp spectacular, especially those of the Moon Women and their ""Lido"" with her ludicrous head gear. Monsters consist of the (very slowly) walking rocks and that giant spider with visible wires who got a lot of work in the late 50s as the inhabitant of many caves and planets.
Best of all, though, is the acting. Every cast member, without exception, is inept. Even handsome Gary Clarke, who later showed he had talent, is awful here. But the Anti-Oscar surely must go to Cathy Downs for her brilliant portrayal of an Earth woman among Lunar rivals. As they lead her to her doom in the jaws of the giant spider, she cries out: ""No! Don't!""

1099407,3,6305908532,"This movie is pretty decent if you're into this kind of stuff.  The acting is corny, in a humorous and entertaining sort of way.  The cheesy effects are great!  The rock monsters are pretty cool, and the giant spider is  totally hilarious.  The spider is the best part of the movie.  It just has  to be seen to be believed!  There are also some very sexy moon women to  look at.  B movie fans should definitely check this one out.",959472000,5,430,4.2625
1099478,2,6305908532,It had an interesting beginning and the acting wasn't too bad.  However starting in the middle the special affects were laughable even for its time and budget and the plot took a really strange turn with actractive women living on the moon.  It just turned out to get really goofy from there.  A decent futuristic moon movie to see is actually called Moon.

Enter the scientist's partner and partner's girlfriend, literally climbing aboard in search of the two convicts right at liftoff... Blast off!!!
Once on the moon we encounter Rock Men, a giant spider and a race of beauty queens who speak English. Most of the following action takes place in a palace within a cave containing oxygen.

1099635,3,6305908532,"This movie had potential, but the missile barely makes it off the launchpad.  The basic premise is not too bad, for a 50's B movie, but they handle it poorly.  Two escaped convicts, petty crooks really, hide inside the rocket in their quest to escape.  The scientist uses them as his crew to man the missile and go to the Moon.  There is no real reason for this, and thinking that two nearly illiterate convicts with 15 seconds of training can pilot the missile is very weak story telling.  Two other scientists happen to get trapped inside the missile just at take off, one is a beautiful woman.  Naturally, one of the convicts makes a play for her and she seems pretty interested, up until they get caught.

When they land on the Moon we find it inhabited by beauty queens, no men.  Several of the woman are interesting and sympathetic characters, but they all die in infighting, and intrigue.  At least a couple should have survived to return to the rocket, I think.  One of the convicts steps into the sunlight and is burned to death because the rays of the sun are so hot on the Moon.

One of the highlights of the movie is the rock creatures.  They are very well done, and look like, well, rock creatures.  Only, they have no motivation, they simply shamble towards anyone who passes near.  Are they going to eat them?  Chat with them?  We don't know, no mention is made of how they live, only that they are the only creatures that can withstand the suns rays.

Unfortunately, the military insists such projects should be under the purview of the government;  he is to turn over his project to them in the morning!  If only he could take off tonight;  all he needs is a crew. . . .

As luck would have it, two escapees from a nearby prison farm are hiding in the ship while the sheriff searches the area.  Dirk discovers them, makes them an offer they can't refuse - they will make up his crew.  After the sheriff leaves, they begin preparations for blast-off, but their activity is noticed by his research partner. . . .

Steve and his fiancee, June, were alone in the blockhouse.  It was getting late and Dirk had still not returned.  It was just then that the ship's ground monitors began flashing and clicking - something was wrong.  He hurries out to the ship with his fiancee. . . .

When June and Steve enter the ship, they realize - too late - that the ship is about to take off.  When she comes to, they are safely in deep space.  But then the troubles begin:  a convict makes improper advances, someone dies, they are menaced by starfish-shaped rock creatures, but worst of all, one of the sexy, scantily-clad Moon maidens is trying to glom onto her man!

Overall:  This movie feels like it was made up as they went along, but that being said, it is fun to watch, at least once.  Continuity: 1, example - the changing spaceship design.  Scientific accuracy: 1, example - the Moon's blue sky.

This high class expensive true to life movie depicts the reality of space travel. Right from the beginning we see the ripples in the back drop cloth while the policeman is talking in the desert. I suspect that they did not think you would notice on a 10 inch screen. Borrowed footage of early V2 type rocket experiments cut into the 50's sci-fi designed space craft.

Steve Dayton (Richard Travis) and his mysterious partner Dirk Green (Michael Whalen) made a space craft that can reach the moon. Through a series of circumstances and an attempt to avoid the proverbial government takeover, they along with Steve's fianc&eacute; and two convicts head for the Moon.

Hey what did you expect, what little kid could resist a flight to the Moon, frightening rock monsters, a giant cave spider on strings and some very lovely Moon Maidens in form fitting tops and stretch pants. It was like heaven. I didn't particularily like the fact that these lovely lunar ladies where able to control humans through mind control, but I guess that was something I would learn to accept when I grew older (THAT'S A JOKE!).

1099834,5,6305908532,"Mankind hasn't always been as intelligent as we are now.  As late as a few hundred years ago, we thought the Earth was flat and that the Sun revolved around the Earth.  As late as 2008, we even believed the Los Angeles Lakers could go all the way.  And, apparently, as late as fifty years ago we believed that the moon was populated by giant rubber rock monsters and ruled over by a sadistic queen.

Of course, some misconceptions are much more entertaining than others, and Missile to the Moon certainly qualifies as the former.  Continuing its long tradition of supporting the most ""legendary"" B-movies, Legend Films has completely re-mastered the classic film for this new DVD release, providing its trademark touch of color in the process, though always including the unaltered black and white version on the same disc.  You might think that the audience reaps the most reward from this improvement, but you'd be wrong.  The real beneficiary of Legend's added hues is the film's camp-value!  Only in true color, for instance, does it become blindingly apparent that ""the moon"" is actually a studio backlot in Southern California.

As with all Legend releases, the colorization quality is far and above any preconceived notion you might have.  The technology deployed by Legend has advanced significantly beyond the ""Terrible Turner"" broadcasting colorizations of the `80s, resulting in a realistic and polished appearance that has to be seen to be believed.  And since the bottom line is so often the ""bottom line,"" you can't get more value than having two versions of a timeless movie on the same disc, for the same price.",1227571200,2,1627,4.944852941176471
1099835,3,6305908532,"The title says it all: a missile goes to the moon! Only there are people in the missile so it's not really a missile but should more precisely be referred to as a ""rocket""!

Still, it goes to the moon, so the title is 50 percent right, which is more than you can say for, oh, Magnolia, which is not about magnolias at all, but rather is largely comprised of Tom Cruise talking about his junk.

Not only does Missile to the Moon offer a title that is half true, it also delivers a thrilling 50's era tale filled with chunk-headed scientists, shapely pageant winners, and a spider that's roughly as menacing as one of the lesser Baldwin brothers.

But the real star of this RiffTrax is comedy legend Fred Willard! Yes, the funniest man in America joins Mike as they take on the classic Missile to the Moon.",1223164800,,804,4.382550335570469

The editing in the movie transfer looks like it was done with a hacksaw.  There are abrupt jumps in the editing of the film and over all the effect vastly diminishes from the viewing enjoyment even of such a cheesy film as this one.  My recommendation to everybody who is interested in buying this product is for them to wait until there is a good quality version transfer of this movie.,1207353600,,525,4.127450980392157

I thought it was gonna have an alternate trac on the DVD with Mike riffing the movie like the Plan 9 vid(Highly reccomended by the way)but nope~nada...The Riff is avail only as a separate audio file on the website....damn!
I've bought several audio files here and each one is awesome.
But I must admit I'm a little lazy when it comes to syncing audio files with my DVD's
Hmmm...maybe someday if they sell Riffs in CD formats it might be easier cause my CD player is next to my DVD player.(Shameless hint)

I listen to my Riffs with my ipod n headphones because I don't have a disc burner. So unfortunately I'm the only one who can hear the Riffs.....",1205798400,3,729,4.360294117647059
1099839,4,6305908532,"When a scientist builds a missile that will take him to the moon(thus the title of course), he enlists(more like forces) the help of two escaped convicts to help him pilot the thing on it's journey.  Why not?  His assistant and his girlfiend happen to stumble aboard as well.  After arriving on the moon they discover a civilization of sexy women(who speak English of course) who are running out of air and wish to colonize another planet.  Our group finds itself in danger and must escape before they're all killed by the evil new dictator chick.  With the help of a sympathetic moon girl, who's gone soft for one of the convicts(of course.  There's always one, isn't there?), they try to make their way back to their missile.  On their moon trip they enounter giant rock men(guys in styrofoam outfits with no attempt whatsoever to cover up the actors' faces popping out of the costume), a giant spider(any film should get at least one extra star on it's rating if it has a giant spider in it), and oxygen.  They also find that standing out in the sun will have the same effect on a human as it would on a vampire.  Needless to say that Missile to the Moon is one of those films that will be most enjoyed by the Plan 9 crowd.  In fact, I actually like this more than Plan 9 myself.  This film is a remake of Cat Women Of The Moon.  I really don't understand what the point was to remake a schlock film that was made only six years earlier, and do it just as cheaply.  I guess we'll never know.  One of the more fun 50s sci-fi films.  But the one thing I don't quite get is why with all these woman around, not one guy gets lucky throughout the entire film(then again they weren't given alot of time.  But somebody could have at least made it quick).  Another thing we'll never understand I guess.  It's still fun though!",1203811200,2,1821,4.353115727002967

1099841,5,6305908532,Missile To the Moon is a 1958 colourized classic about a group of earthmen travelling to the moon to meet a race of beautiful moon maidens whom turned out plotting a plan to invade the earth and enslave mankind. The wardrobe the moon maidens were wearing was classy and retro and the special effects was hilarious with the giant rubber spider puppet and the foam rubber rock men. the special extras includes old sci-fi toy commericals of the 1950's and trailers of now-colourized horror films like Night of the Living Dead and Carnival Of Souls.

1099843,5,6305908532,"Movies don't stick in your memory for forty years for no good reason. This one just would not go away. Low expectations are wonderfully rewarded. The pre-feminist theme of men as mezmerized breeding slaves in a phony underground lunar playground works to perfection. Matriarchal society never looked so good as with this cast of beauty pageant winners. You too will say, ""Yes, my Lido!""",1170115200,,386,5.046875
7898528,2,6305908532,"Interesting, almost modern premise: A brilliant rocket scientist wants to privatize space travel (despite objections from the government); to that end, he privately builds a sleek, futuristic, one-stage, solar-powered spacecraft with the intent of flying it to the Moon, which he does with a thoroughly unqualified crew, including a couple of escaped convicts and a little female eye-candy.

Unfortunately, the sleek and futuristic spacecraft design is quickly discarded early in the film, replaced with V2 rocket footage.  No explanation is ever offered for this switcheroo.

Following a bumpy trip and landing on the lunar surface (which looks a lot like southern California desert), they encounter the Moon's inhabitants: a few ponderously-awkward-but-still-threatening ""rock men,"" and a bunch of telepathic blue babes in pastel leotards and satin capes, who are not quite as welcoming as they first appear.  Zany hyjinx ensue, the space travellers must flee for their lives, the moon-maids blow an airlock and suffocate en masse, etc.

Not far into the film, you may be scratching your head because most of the plot elements in ""Missile to the Moon"" seem very, very familiar.  That's because practically everything is lifted straight out of the 1953 flick ""Cat Women of the Moon""... But was Cat Women such a critical and financial success that even lower-budget remakes were warranted?

As the film spins wildly out of control, it almost seems as though the story (and directing, and acting, and costuming, and SFX) is being improvised by a team of drunken children.  Good for a laugh, even though the movie contains zero humor and takes itself much too seriously.",1522800000,,1668,5.2679245283018865
