1779345,5,B00006JDSZ,"PD James is a brilliant crime writer, because she not only gives the reader a terrific story, the DVD doesn't lose its sting in a visual capacity.  In fact all the DVD's with Roy Marsden as Inspector Dalgliesh are a joy to watch more than once.  Dalgliesh is such an understated, enigmatic character and Marsden captures that exactly.  All of P D James involving Dalgliesh are excellent reading and/or viewing.  Both as I prefer, because whereas the written words are brilliantly couched, the visual impact is equally well portrayed.",1396656000,2,533,4.955056179775281
1779346,4,B00006JDSZ,This was created years ago.  We have had it on cd for more then a decade and are now replacing it with a DVD to keep it again a lot longer.  PD James is an excellent author and Roy Mould - Marsden is a very good actor.  Try it out!,1394668800,2,231,3.58
1779347,3,B00006JDSZ,I love British mysteries but I found this one to be slow moving and not very interesting. I kept falling asleep watching it. It didn't keep me involved.,1379289600,2,152,4.464285714285714
1779348,4,B00006JDSZ,"""Shroud for a Nightingale"" is an engrossing mystery featuring Detective Superintendent Dalgliesh.  The setting is a hospital and nursing school.  While visiting there on one of his cases, first one and then two nurses are murdered.  Dalgliesh has to solve the crimes.  The production of ""Shroud"" greatly benefits from Marsden as the good Superintendent.  I find him very believable as a police detective.  He's backed up by a fine ensemble of British character actors.

My only cautionary note on this and other Superintendent Dalgliesh series is that they require patience from the viewer.  Instead of something like a Midsomer Murders episode (where three people get killed and the case gets cracked inside of 100 minutes), the Dalgliesh mysteries like this one unfold over four and sometimes even five hours.  For people used to resolutions in much quicker times, this might result in them getting a little bored.  But unlike one other Dalgliesh story that I bailed on because nothing much was happening apart from talking, ""Shroud for a Nightingale"" keeps moving and doesn't waste the viewer's time.

A couple of other comments:

1.  The stories are set back in the 1980s and early 1990s and might look a bit retro to some.

2.  The sound quality (at least on the Netflix streaming version I watched) is not very good...sometimes, one could almost hear a metallic kind of overtone to it all.

But still good fun overall.",1334880000,,1424,4.970338983050848
1779349,5,B00006JDSZ,Excellent story line.  I really like all the P.D. James movies.  The killer or killers are not known until the last 10 minutes of the show.  The formate is almost soap opera which addes to the intrigue of the story.,1323993600,,215,4.325
1779350,5,B00006JDSZ,"The editorial reviewer got it right. This younger Dalgliesh is tougher and more aggressive in his approach to his job than the older, wiser, more humane Inspector of the later shows. Writers, directors and actors share the credit for first rate television: complex people, good plotting and only the  violence necessary to justify the label of mystery. It is recommended for all to whom this genre appeals.",1235520000,3,406,5.059701492537314
1779351,4,B00006JDSZ,"First, let me state upfront that I'm not a huge fan of PD James's mysteries, with or without Adam Dalgliesh, her fabled poetry-writing Scotland Yard detective.  The PBS series done on her Dalgliesh mysteries, however, represents one of those infrequent instances in which the screen adaptations were a far more enjoyable experience than the original material.  British actor Roy Marsden gets most of the credit for this, with his quietly vivid portrayal of the severely emotionally controlled Chief Superintendent Dalgliesh.  Marsden overcomes the problem that Dalgliesh has always presented for me in James's novels: he's so enigmatic that he never quite comes to life.  Marsden's strong physical presence, beautiful voice (just close your eyes and listen once in awhile), and subtle but clear characterization finally breathes real life into this unique detective.  It was this series that gave Marsden a higher profile here in the States, although his edgy Neil Burnside in ""The Sandbaggers"" had already created a cult following.  The strength of Marsden's work as Dalgliesh can best be appreciated by watching the one failed attempt PBS made to resurrect Dalgliesh with another actor (""The Murder Room"") after Marsden exited the series. That is not to insult the later actor, it is just to point out how completely Marsden made Dalgliesh his own.

""Shroud for a Nigthingale"" is one of the earlier PD James adaptations for PBS's ""Mystery!"", along with ""Death of an Expert Witness"", and despite these two showing video rather than film production values, both are particular favorites.  ""Shroud for a Nightingale"" is set mostly in Nightingale House, a nurse's training school attached to a large private hospital. The story presents not only the cool, brainy Dalgliesh but a variety of other colorful characters, all fully realized by an excellent cast.  (Penny Downie, who plays one of the student nurses here, turns up in two later James/Dalgliesh stories, once as Kate Mishkin, Dalgliesh's assistant after John Massingham exits in ""A Taste for Death"", and once as QC Venetia Aldridge in ""A Certain Justice"".)

Several narratives intertwine here: one involves a patient at the hospital with a suspicious international past who is under investigation by Dalgliesh; another involves the mysterious past of the self-possessed Matron, who heads up the hospital's nursing staff; others narratives involve relationships among students and senior nurses. The narratives collide early in the story, and, of course, a series of deaths result.  Chief Inspector Dalgliesh and his assistant, D.I. John Massingham, set to work to unravel the connections among the narratives.  Along the way we meet and get to know the characters of the student nurses, Matron (a strong performance by stage actress Sheila Allen), the senior nurses, and an egotistical surgeon (Joss Ackland), all nicely fleshed out.  There is a subtle suggestion of lesbianism in two of the relationships, and the observant (especially if they listen carefully to voices) will also catch a younger John Thaw in a supporting role, long before he made his name in the U.S. as Inspector Morse.

""Shroud for a Nightingale"" is one of the best of this series: tightly woven, clearly directed, with many interesting characters to watch - first among equals being Roy Marsden's piercing-eyed, deliciously aloof Chief Inspector Adam Dalgliesh.",1214265600,20,3392,5.3158878504672895
1779352,5,B00006JDSZ,"Based on the novel by award-winning author P.D James, this DVD, which is part of the Adam Dalgliesh series,  can sure rock your boat. It might not have too much action, it might not have too many CSI shots(nothing against CSI), but it has fascinating dialogues, a lot of hospital intrigues, and quite a bit of suspense. If suspense novel is your thing, you will love this DVD. The humor is more subtle than the Poirot Series. Highly recommended.",1124236800,12,445,4.632911392405063
1779353,5,B00006JDSZ,"This is my favorite of all the ITV PD James adaptations.  I rented this one while on vacation, and ended up glued to it into the wee hours.  I actually woke up my spouse in the middle of the night at one point when I inadvertantly started protesting at the screen during the final climax.  The story like I said is gripping.  The supporting cast is fantastic!  Marsden is perfect.  Definitely check this one out.

If you like this one, definitely read the book.  It's great also and Massingham gets up to some hilarious antics -- which they cut this out of the film.",1109721600,6,566,4.375
1779354,5,B00006JDSZ,"Finally, the wonderful BBC dramatizations of the P.D. James mysteries broadcast on PBS Mystery Theater are being issued in a DVD format. SHROUD FOR A NIGHTINGALE is one of the best. The setting for this mystery is a school in England located in an old 19th Century Victorian building situated on a large estate (thus the time-honored device of murder in the ""country house"" is preserved wherein all the suspects and victims are in residence).
Florence Nightingale founded nursing in the U.K. during the Crimean War and for a long time afterward, those who became nurses were called ""nightingales"" after their famous role model. (Clara Barton was her equivalent in the U.S. during the Civil War.) In this mystery, the nightingales are student nurses and their instructors living in residence at a school of nursing.
One morning, a student nurse is ingeniously done in before a dozen witnesses none of whom can identify the killer. Adam Dalgliesh, Scotland Yard's poetic police chief superintendent is soon on the scene. He finds plenty of suspects but before he can solve the first crime a beautiful red-headed instructor is found dead in her bed--of unnatural causes. She had been having an affair with someone as she was pregnant -- did her lover try to cover his tracks? Or maybe one of the other nurses was jealous of the beautiful young woman and killed her. When a third mysterious death takes place, hysteria reigns supreme. Dalgliesh stalks the killer and in the end nails his nemesis, but not before a very desperate person with a wicked, wicked past produces mayhem and a few murders.",1039910400,21,1593,4.9037037037037035

7969972,5,B00006JDSZ,"12 of P. D. James books about Adam Dalgliesh have been made into movies: Death of an Expert Witness (1983), Shroud of a Nightingale (1984), Cover Her Face (1985), The Black Tower (1985), A Taste of Death (1988), Device and Desires (1981), Unnatural Causes (1993), A Mind to Murder (1995), Original Sin (1997), A Certain Justice (1998) - these 10 played by Roy Marsden - Death in Holy Orders (2003) and, finally, The Murder Room (2005) - these 2 played by Martin Shaw.

The movies were not made in the order that P. D. James wrote them. The order of the first 10 books are: Cover Her Face (1962), A Mind to Murder (1963), Unnatural Causes (1967), Shroud of a Nightingale (1971), The Black Tower (1975), Death of an Expert Witness (1977), A Taste of Death (1986), Devices and Desires (1989), Original Sin (1994) and A Certain Justice (1997).  The last 2 books that were made into movies were Death in Holy Orders, (2001), and The Murder Room (2003). These last 2 were filmed in order.  P. D. James wrote 2 more books about Dalgliesh but to date have not been made into movies. They are: The Lighthouse (2005) and The Private Patient (2007).

I have enjoyed all these movies with both Roy Marsden and Martin Shaw but I must admit I like Marsden better as Dalgliesh. Martin Shaw is an excellent actor and I have enjoyed him in Judge John Deed and George Gently.  My least favorite movie is A Certain Justice. Dalgliesh is shown spasmodically throughout this movie. The main character is a very disturbed young man who terrifies the young daughter of the attorney who recently represented him in a murder case. I just didn't enjoy the characters or the storyline. I watch the Dalgliesh movies again and again except for ACJ but as a Dalgliesh fan, I had to have it for my collection. I wondered why this was Marsden last movie and, finally, learned that he was simply tired of playing Dalgliesh. The producers had no choice but to find another actor for the final 2 movies. Hopefully they will one day make movies out of P. D. James last 2 Dalgliesh books but probably not with Martin Shaw because of his involvement in George Gently. If you are a P. D. James fan or even an Adam Dalgliesh fan, I think you will enjoy all these movies. You owe it to yourself to watch them and judge them for yourself.",1438300800,2,2296,4.509615384615385
