8646722,5,B00IZ03VTE,"Excellent instructional DVD.  I'm not a professional dancer, but I got a lot of useful information and moves to add to my dance to improve and enhance my dancing.  I have not danced with skirtwork before, but the DVD has given me confidence that with practice,  I can add this to my dance .

Treasure's manner of instruction was expertly done.  I would certainly like to take a class or workshop with her if I have the opportunity.

 The quality of the DVD was exceptional.  The sound and narrative was very clear.  The video was crisp.  The choice of backgrounds, music, accessories, costuming, etc was not overwhelming or distracting.  The demonstration of the combos of various skirtwork were very graceful and enjoyable to watch.",1423440000,,733,4.830645161290323
8646723,5,B00IZ03VTE,"I wanted this DVD from the second I first heard about it and I am happy to say this is a video that is a definite keeper with a lot of reference value.  Let me start off by saying that the video quality is clear and the audio quality is excellent.  I did not have to adjust the volume a single time - Treasure was always easy to hear and understand.  Throughout the video, the camera will also sometimes focus closely on her feet, making it even easier to see the footwork.  Treasure explains a lot in this video before the actual skirtwork begins.  She explains the various types of skirts - with visuals - as well as undergarments, waist belts, fabrics, and even goes into skirt design.  By the time that section of the video was completed, I felt a lot more knowledgeable about skirts and felt confident that I was better able to choose suitable pre-made skirts and more comfortable walking into a fabric store to try to tackle making my own.  The sections explaining the movements are very clear and easy to follow.  Treasure explains and demonstrates the step, then walks you through how to execute the movement, and goes through a little drill of the steps - both with and without the skirt.  The movements are clearly labeled on the screen, making it very easy to scroll through to find the particular section you're looking for.  By the time I was done watching the video, I couldn't wait to show off my new moves!

8646724,5,B00IZ03VTE,"Wow! what a great instructional video. This video is great for any one looking to add the flourish of skirt work. The information on type of material best for a skirt, styles and belts is a great addition to what most live workshops offer on the subject.  The steps and combos covered are broken down and easily followed, though as Treasure states, to get the most out this you should have some basic training in the art of belly dance.  I also find her tips sprinkled through out very helpful, and great reminders in general for performing & stage presence. The videography is also well done. Some shots concentrate just on footwork, and when necessary she changes her angle to the camera, which enables the viewer to better grasp the movements she is presenting. Again, very well done, and I am appreciative of the chance to be able to review this work. I will be looking for more of her work.",1422057600,,895,4.552795031055901

8646726,5,B00IZ03VTE,"Awesome Video - this video is great for the seasoned dancer as well as someone who is new to belly dance.  I have been dancing for a year and learned so much valuable information.  Treasure breaks down the movements a step at a time showing details on both arms and legs.  This is something I loved and something that is lacking at workshops.  Workshops go straight to the choreography and move through very fast.  This video takes you from start to finish.  Treasure gives details on what skirts work for what type of dancing, materials and more.  Her explanations are thorough and she expands on details.  Having the wrong skirt would make it so frustrating to try and learn certain moves.  She completely sets up the dancer for success with skirts, posture and positioning.  You learn so many different movements - much more than you would in one class or workshop.  By the time I leave a workshop I feel as though I have retained nothing.  A video can be watched over and over and you can refine your movements and it is so much cheaper than a workshop!  You learn how to ""use"" your skirt to show emotions and exude that energy.  The various moves that you learn here are flirty, fun and full of excitement.  Everyone loves watching dancers in beautiful colorful skirts.  Here you learn how to use those skirts.  For those who need something new to spice up their choreography - this is it.  Be a hit at your next show or your local venue as you share your new skills learned from this video.  Treasure has been dancing most of her life and it is great that she has taken the time to share her knowledge and passion of dance with us.  This is a must have video for the belly dancer.",1421884800,,1686,4.429967426710098
8646727,5,B00IZ03VTE,"I wasn't sure how much of this video would be useful for me because I am not a fusion or tribal dancer.  I was pleasantly surprised with how many moves were broken down and the amount of practical performance advice Treasure shared in this DVD.  I perform a lot of the Amcab typed of belly dance and many of my costumes have the vin tage style 3 and 4 panel circle chiffon skirts.  These skirt moves will add a little spice and drama to my choreographies and improvs.  I loved the way the steps were broken down with foot work and arms shown, than the whole movement done while Treasure was in a practice outfit so you could see her movements without the skirt.  And than seeing the movement demonstrated with the skirt  before moving on to the next step.  It gives you a very good idea of what the step looks like when all together.  In addition, Treasure shows a number of steps that would add a lot of dimension to  your dance even without adding the skirt.  And she doesn't leave out the transitions between the steps so you can move gracefully from one step to another.  I would recommend this as a great addition to any belly dancers collection.",1421798400,,1151,4.382075471698113
8646728,5,B00IZ03VTE,"Wonderful video, gave me a lot of fun ideas for skirt work for my recent solo performance at a venue!~* :-)",1419552000,,107,4.142857142857143
8646729,5,B00IZ03VTE,Very technical & for those dancers who are serious about this style of dance.,1416614400,,77,4.571428571428571
8646730,5,B00IZ03VTE,"I've been dancing various dance forms for many years, but for some reason, I've never learned any skirtwork. Treasure's video is wonderful for beginners. Even though I recognized many of the skirt movements as things I have seen other dancers do in belly dance, folk dance, Folklorico and elsewhere, I had no idea just how many different skirt moves there really are. I was impressed by Treasure's meticulous technique and careful explanations. She shows the steps and arm movements for each technique first without a skirt on, and then again with the skirt. This is brilliant teaching. Too often with props dancing, the teacher expects you to be able to manage the prop and your body simultaneously from the very beginning. Here you get a clear picture of what your legs and arms should do and then add the skirt.

There are a lot of extras on this DVD. It opens with suggestions for how to pick a skirt or make a skirt, including explanations of how various materials perform. Along the way, Treasure's ""tips"" vignettes share advice on presentation, stage presence, and other tidbits to help refine your performance. If you're new to skirtwork like me, this DVD is sure to be a hit. I think it would also serve well for more advanced skirtwork dancers who would like to expand or refine their craft.",1413590400,2,1301,4.756637168141593
8646731,5,B00IZ03VTE,"I have been performing skirtwork with bellydance for over 5 years.  My training was all in person so I jumped on the chance when I was given the opportunity to review a DVD on skirtwork.

I really appreciated the time Treasure put into the sections on skirt length, fabrics, accessories and tips.  This type of information is normally rushed during workshops, or not discussed at all, in order to get to the combinations. The material discussed, which may not have crossed the minds of those unfamiliar with using skirts, can have a big impact on a performance. I have seen some of the warnings she discussed in action at festivals and on YouTube.  It is better to learn how to avoid them rather than finding out for yourself on stage.

The step work and combinations are really suited for beginners/intermediate but advance skirtwork dancers can get some inspiration from the movement as well. I loved her presentation style, showing the move without a skirt and then with a circle skirt.  Seeing the legs unhindered by yards of fabric makes it much easier to process the move.

She warns those who travel the tribal path that they might want to use another lighter skirt while learning.  I learned skirtwork as a newbie with a 25 yard tribal skirt and did have any trouble, so tribal girls you do not need to run out and buy another skirt.

Another thing, when Treasure links the moves together in a demonstration she does so outside in crazy winds.  As she dances she talks about troubleshooting and reviews some of the material she went through in her tips section.  Most bellydancers have had to battle the elements at one point or another during a performance so seeing it in action was nice change from the perfect staged performance on most DVDs",1411948800,3,1753,4.696078431372549
