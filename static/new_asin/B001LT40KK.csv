8319682,5,B001LT40KK,"I liked the movie.  I thought it was fun and if you like westerns then you will like Redemption.  I think that it's sad hollywood doesn't make more westerns and I'm glad independent movies are coming out.

good film.  not for the kids, but good film!",1329868800,,250,4.369565217391305
8319683,1,B001LT40KK,"This poor excuse for a western movie has been available for over a year on DVD under the title, ""Redemption: A Mile From Hell"". To date, it has three ratings from two reviewers who have given it a score of zero and one other who awarded it  a score of three. Yeah, I know you cannot rate a movie  zero. However, two of those personal reviewers both stated this movie should be rated a zero! It appears none of the Duke's other great works, or those of Randolph Scott's are available for the Blu-Treatment. We know the vaults of Hollywood have many great westerns that have not been released in the DVD format, yet alone on Blu-Ray. So, this...ah hum, studio, North American Pictures is going to the well one more time with this direct to disc disaster hoping some unsuspecting western fans will be fooled into spending their hard-earned money on this release. It has been simply retitled and repackaged & rereleased on DVD and Blu-Ray. The old saying, ""you can put lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig"" applies here too. My advice partner is to keep waiting for the real studios to dig deep, dust them off and release those gems and nuggets they are sitting on. Why the studios don't release more of those golden treasures on Blu-Ray is beyond many of us western fans! Instead, we get dribble such as this. Shame!",1280448000,8,1317,4.483333333333333
8319684,1,B001LT40KK,"To say this movie sucks is to be unfair to those films that actually rise to the level of ""sucks"". This one falls far short of that low goal. Like the previous reviewer (and I SORELY wish I'd read these reviews prior to purchase) I made it through about a half hour before deciding I wasn't going to waste any more of my life on this dreck. If someone told me that a kid who was pulling down a 'D' in his high school film class had made a movie starring any of his neighbors he could con into participating I would have expected more.

The absolutely crazy things, the DVD cover describes the movie as ""Unforgiven meets High Noon"". The PR hack that came up with THAT comparison should henceforth remain unforgiven...right up to his being beaten about the head and shoulders at high noon. Someday soon, we hope.

Amazon does indeed need a zero star rating, and this is the movie that demonstrates the need.",1256947200,18,905,4.413173652694611
8319685,3,B001LT40KK,"I generally like Indie movies, and I kinda liked this one, but...

First off, the video/production quality is awful.  I guess I have a new appreciation for ""post production"" now.  This thing at times looks little better than a YouTube download.

On top of that, the ""Hired gun of the Lord"" angle is just plain moronic.  Suggestion to producer: Next time, talk to a few real Christian's before attempting to portray one.

The rest of the acting is equally afwul.

Aside from that, the story is actually quite good.  The lead actor is pretty good too.  But everyone and everything else in the movie is just plain stupid.

This one would have benefited greatly from some religious research, and some better directing.

Again, the story is interesting, and intriguing, but the acting and the lack of decent post production just killed it.

Would like to see some more from the lead actor/protagonist, though.",1235088000,5,904,4.836601307189542
