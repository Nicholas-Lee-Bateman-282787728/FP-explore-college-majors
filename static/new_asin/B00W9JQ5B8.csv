7126883,4,B00W9JQ5B8,"""White God"" (2014 release from Hungary; 121 min.) brings the story of Lili and her dog Hagen. As the movie opens, we see the young Lili (12 yrs. old or so) in a dream sequence, where she biking through an empty city (I think Budapest), and eventually overrun by dozens of dogs (which is what you see on the jacket cover of the DVD). After the opening titles, we get to know Lili and Hagen. Lili's mom is going out of town for a long time to Australia, and hence Lili needs to go live with her dad. Complicating things is that her dad's apartment building doesn't allow ""mutts"" (i.e. mixed-breed street dogs). It isn't long before Lili and her dad are fighting about the dog, leading to her dad releasing the dog somewhere in the middle of the city. What will become of Lili and of Hagen? Will they ever see ech other again? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, despite the sweet-sounding premise that I described above, please be aware that this is a tough and at times gruesome movie, and most certainly NOT recommended for young children. The scene where a cow is cut open (for the meat inspector--i.e. Lili's dad), is horrendous and completely unnecessary. Equally bad: there is a long stretch in the movie where Hagan is trained to become an underground fighter dog. The only thing I could think of during the tough-as-nails dog fights is the movie's prominent disclaimer at the very beginning that no animals were hurt during the making of the movie. Second, at heart, the movie combines two major themes into one movie: the dog's (mis)adventures in surviving the city, and Lili's awkward/stunted relationship with her dad, whom she is not particularly close to. It's sometimes a strange mix, as we literally go from one to the other, and back again, but it never makes for dull viewing. Last but not least, this is a cast of unknowns (for me anyway), but there are some terrific performances, none more so than the girl playing Lili.

""White God"" showed up out of the blue and without any pre-release hype at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati and I finally had a chance to check it out. The weeknight evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great. I can't imagine that this will hang around a long time in the theater. Regardless, if you are in the mood for a foreign movie that is MILES away from your standard Hollywood fare, you may want to check this out if you get the chance.",1431475200,22,2527,4.5394736842105265

The trainer had so many interesting things to say about the training and things she did to get the performances she got that i recommend you listen to the interview Ms. Gross did. You just have to watch the movie. At first, you will think GOD what am i watching this for; i don't want to see animals get hurt. Well, none of them didtelling you this not as a spoiler but as a tribute to the director, trainer and actors. It takes place in Hungary and is sub-titled but you soon forget that because there's not a lot of dialogue. I recommend you watch it.

Instead the dog sees the darker side of human nature that turns him from a family pet to a pet that is looking for revenge.

Interestingly the dogs appeared more intelligent and focused once they decided to take revenge on the humans who had been cruel to their leader, Hagen, whereas the humans turned out to be hapless and disorganized.  The animal training involved was incredible and it was not sentimental.

7126895,1,B00W9JQ5B8,"Can't really understand in what universe this film would receive 4 or 5 stars from ANYONE.....
So bad it's almost good. With the emphasis on ALMOST.
The good:  lots of dogs, with acting parts!  Think of it as a ""Rocky"" for dogs.....or a 007 for dogs....Dog is tortured and trained to become a killer and then 'decides' in the ring- ""no- I will kill no more of my kind"".....and later...dog rips out the throat of (bad) human(s). LOL!
The bad: 2 hours?  Really? Also, there's more bad, but.....just don't waste your time.  It's 2 hours of my life I will never get back. And I LOVE dogs.
The ugly: Graphic blood and guts- often unnecessary to further the plot or even to further the theme.
My SO says:  You could tell this was the dog's first film.  Amateurs- wait for his second or third one.....",1452470400,2,794,4.441379310344828

I wasn't sure what to make of this movie; for a while it felt like a drama about a disfunctional family, then came the animal abuse which I could not stand to watch, then the animal uprising which was so unrealistic I thought maybe this movie was supposed to be a comedy, or a spoof of something I had missed. All in all, I was confused and by the end I was rooting for the organized gang of dogs to kill everyone just to be done with the movie.",1451520000,2,528,4.0673076923076925

All the actors are good.  The plot is good, but disturbing.  I have three much loved dogs and they have been with me for over ten years.  Because the movie is mainly focused on (in the beginning) a very loved large Lab mixed breed and the horrible trials the domesticated dog (Hagen / Max) encounters after being deliberately abandoned.  Horrible! Horrible!  Horrible.  I understand that real life is cruel and that even though the story is made up, such animal cruelty (and cruelty to humans) as portrayed in the movie is a reality.  The cruelty upset me so much that I regret watching the movie --  even though the movie was very well produced with very good actors to include the dogs.

7126903,2,B00W9JQ5B8,"Well . . . I heard about this film on Fresh Air and was intrigued.

I had to stop halfway through, because I found it so disturbing. I finished it this morning.

The violence is gratuitous. There's no real point (other than, perhaps, Tannhauser hath charms to sooth the savage beast). There are odd digressions that don't seem to go anywhere.

So, if you want to see dogs get shot, or beaten, or abused - and then get really ugly revenge, go for it. This film's for you. But, I really disliked this film and I'm pretty chill when it comes to reviewing and enjoying created content.

This was a nearly terrible film.",1448668800,2,615,4.415929203539823

7126910,5,B00W9JQ5B8,"Just finished watching this film.  I've also just read a few negative reviews that mentioned the violence in the film and wanted to comment.  I too was not expecting the portrayal of dog abuse and dog fighting, and those things admittedly make me very uncomfortable-- however, reality is FAR WORSE than what was portrayed and additionally, this was ABSOLUTELY NOT gratuitous violence.  There are no direct shots of abuse, but rather, well-crafted and powerful scenes that do exactly what they should: make you FEEL exactly what we should feel about dog fighting and animal abuse.  So, be brave and watch this film, because you can handle it, and you should, because the film is worthwhile in its entirety-- a beautiful story with many meanings.  I have a young baby, I'm super lovey dovey and soft right now, I haven't watched a complete film in 10 months, and I'm saying this film is absolutely worth it.  Go for it.",1447977600,5,917,4.772151898734177
7126911,5,B00W9JQ5B8,"A Disney animal fable shot through with a hearty dose of social realism and spiced with some serious R-rated violence, White God is a strange, wonderful, disturbing, heartwarming story about a teenage girl, her pet dog, and the intense love that binds them in the face of hardship, misfortune, and separation.

Brilliantly shot and edited - the picture includes sequences from the dog's point of view - and featuring a remarkable cast of hundreds of dog extras, Hungarian director Kornl Mundrucz's minor masterpiece is a postmodern Lassie with a heart of gold and the bite of a rabid wolf.

Lili (Zsfia Psotta), the film's 13-year-old heroine, defies convention and the law when she keeps a pet, a mixed-breed street dog named Hagen. According to some strange anti-mongrel law in Hungary, folks who want to keep such undesirable dogs must pay an extra fee for a license.

When Lili's mom goes out of town for work, Lili is forced to stay with her dad (Sndor Zstr), whose building forbids pets of any kind.

Hagen is taken away when a hateful neighbor calls animal control and reports Lili.

But Hagen refuses to be discarded, Lili refuses to be apart from her dog, and each begins a long, arduous quest to find the other.

So what if a few cruel humans have to die along the way?

Operatic in scope, filled with brilliant visual and literary allusions, and propelled by an intense, exciting pace, White God is a thrilling work.",1447891200,4,1427,4.753036437246964

7126913,5,B00W9JQ5B8,"Honestly I went into this movie expecting it to be a dumb thriller like sharknado but what I didn't expect was a movie full of beauty and heartbreak. This movie is about a parallel story of a girl and her dog. While Lili tries to find her place in the world and be true to herself, Hagen, her former dog, just tries to survive and make his way back to Lili. This film is a huge allegory for discrimination and it does it very well. There is a lot of gore though and some scenes are hard to watch but if you can get through that, this movie will be a fantastic one to watch.",1447027200,4,573,3.991304347826087

7126919,5,B00W9JQ5B8,"Not everyone's cup of tea, but definitely mine!! While it was slow, it was also powerful, poignant, moving.  I think we here in the US are so used to immediate gratification that many found this puzzling or boring.  This film wasn't ""fast food"" so to speak, it was a slow complex meal with a number of courses that take a while to digest.  Nor was it unbelievably brutal. The reality of dog abuse and dog fighting is much more violent than anything seen in this film. This was just a tiny glimpse of what really goes on and how dogs are actually treated in both training and fighting. So many complained about the violence... not even close to the real thing!!!  And as for the abandonment and cavalier treatment of street dogs!!!  That was heart breaking and it happens everywhere, every single day, dogs are left to fend for themselves, to starve, to die!!! As are all forms of life, including human.
The filming and use of dogs was brilliant. I will watch again just to be able to take it in more slowly the second time around.  As a lifelong dog lover, rescuer, adopter, this had great meaning for me, and it's not just about dogs.  It is about man's inhumanity, domination, lack of respect and care, injustice, exploitation, brutality and cruelty imposed on all living things, human and animal alike.
The last scene was not intended to ""wrap things up neatly"".  For me it was about starting to bridge a huge divide, recognizing massive injustice,  coming to terms with the value of all creatures, finding respect for each other and the dignity that all life and every species deserves and merits. A recognition that we are all connected, and an attempt to come to peace and understand the complex effects and outcome of inhumanity. It was a beginning, not an end.  In my opinion, truly a worthwhile and excellent film.  I'll be thinking about it for a long time to come.",1445644800,6,1875,4.6006006006006

7126931,5,B00W9JQ5B8,"I love dogs probably more so than the people giving low ratings because they didn't like all the scenes of abuse. That said, here are two main warnings for this movie:
If you're not used to European movies, they're a bit slower paced than most American movies. This is only two hours, but it feels very long. That's not necessarily a bad thing, I often enjoy those movies. If that's not your thing, just be warned.
The second warning is that there is a lot of very hard to watch stuff in this movie. This movie pulls no punches in exposing the viewer to the bitter reality of the way dogs are treated. It was very hard for me to watch some parts, and some I just couldn't look at. This movie is rated R for good reasons. Evaluate your children's ability to handle violence and abuse before showing them this.
Moving forward, I loved this movie. I thought the end was very satisfying (minor warning- the ending is also a European style of seemingly suddenly cutting off, so if you're not used to foreign films, be warned). While much of it is heartbreaking and shows terrible things happening, this sort of thing is necessary. If you live your entire life in a bubble ignoring the fact that this sort of thing happens, you are allowing it to continue. This movie exists to show us what happens to dogs when we take them for granted and think of ourselves as above them. This movie exists as a plea to try to stop these horrible things from happening. This movie exists to satisfy, if only momentarily, everyone's wishes that people who mistreat animals would get what is coming to them.
If you can handle your heart being shattered, please watch this movie. Hug your dog, rescue future dog friends instead of buying from mills, donate to shelters that treat dogs with respect. Dogs are better creatures than we are, and it's our responsibility to give them the respect and care they deserve.",1443312000,6,1890,4.545454545454546

7126951,5,B00W9JQ5B8,"Incredible movie.  The story starts off with Lili and her beloved dog Hagen being dropped off by her mother and stepfather to stay with her father for three months while they travel to Australia for work.  Right away it is clear that the dog is unwelcome, partly because he is a dog but mainly because he is a ""mixed breed""; first by the father and then by the landlady who immediately makes a false report that Hagen has bitten someone.  Shortly after, Lili's father cruelly abandons Hagen on the highway.  It's heartbreaking.

It becomes clear that mixed breed dogs are less than dirt in this society.  Allegories abound.

Hagen struggles to survive and meets up with other dogs, where he starts to learn the ropes.  In one brief moment of relief, he finds that he has been tricked by a human and is then sold to a dogfighter.  It's all downhill for him from there.  All the while, Lili keeps searching for him.

The film gets more and more difficult to watch, but it's important to remember that no animals were harmed.  The people who made this film loved all these dogs.  I won't go into spoiler territory, but when Hagen starts to take his revenge on those who have wronged him, you can't help but have a part of you root for him even though you know none of this is going to end well.

Father is portrayed as more evil than is believable. (kicks dog out of car in front of daughter who just recently came to visit him)
Dog is portrayed as innocent, then quickly guilty when it starts it's killing spree by killing an innocent man, and trampling an innocent woman.

The two protagonists, a highly expressive dog and a thirteen year old girl, might steer you toward thinking the movie is for kids. Especially since all the ""bad guys"" are adults. It's more than a simple tale. The movie also has two important messages. One meant I think to embarrass those who abandon dogs, train dogs to fight, and dogcatchers, especially in cities where the abandoned dog population is huge (just google abandoned dogs in Moscow and you'll get an idea). The other utilizes the story as a metaphor for society's attitude toward immigrants and those who do not 'fit in' generally. An attitude very relevant in all of Europe right now. It's also a movie to satisfy any dog lover as it does not manipulate with anthropomorphous story-telling. The dogs, in all their splendor and heartbreak, are just dogs. Dogs who earn our sympathy and our respect. Finally, you might think from the opening scenes and toward the end that it's a film with thrilling special effects. But no.

7127023,4,B00W9JQ5B8,"The most impressive thing about this movie is the work done by the dogs. There is no CGI dogs, they are all real and it is fun to watch them run, jump, bark and growl. The story is OK, the people acting is good and the I generally liked it.",1438819200,2,240,3.82
7127024,5,B00W9JQ5B8,"Lili is eleven years old and has a beloved dog - Hagen. Her parents are split up and when her mother has to go for a 3 month jolly with work to Australia - she has to stay with pops. Only he lives in an apartment where mutts are verboten. All cross breeds are seen as inferior to pure breeds in Hungary.

Despite her best efforts Hagen ends up on the mean streets of Budapest and she, in her innocent way, sets out to find him. Now that is the very simple synopsis for what is a film with so much more to offer. This is a cast of thousands - of dogs that is. All of the mixed breed dogs were untrained and rescued from shelters. The performances are stunning. There are scenes of animal butchery and animal cruelty - so if that will offend then this may not be for you.

It is also a parable about how one species dominates another in the belief it is the superior - and we all know that in parables pride leads to a fall.

This is also shot beautifully in a beautiful city with stunning realism and an eye for the impact that such a powerful story can make. Official entry for the Academy Awards for best foreign language film 2015 and winner of Un Certain Regard prize at the 2014 Canes Film Festival - this is amazing, original, stunning and highly entertaining cinema.",1438819200,4,1272,4.204918032786885
7127025,1,B00W9JQ5B8,"The director states that his heart was once broken when he visited dog shelter, all the eyes pleading and nothing he could do. The solution, make a film in which there are no likable characters and in which the abuse and killing of dogs is the focal point of this overly-long two hour film. Then, similar to Willard's rats, have the dogs exact revenge on the precise people who mistreated the lead dog, Hagen. There's a sub-story concerning the protagonist's music education and a fleeting crush on a boy, all of which I'm supposing, is meant to humanize her, but the actress has all the depth and charm of a spud. Seriously. And do NOT get me started on that bloody trumpet at the film's end.

SPOILER!!

As for a previous reviewer's reaction to the ending, maybe this will help: This story can have no positive resolution.  The writing is on the wall, to which the father (a thoughtless and emotionless jerk throughout--no wonder his wife left him and he was fired from his job) alludes when he says, ""Give them a little more time.""  (Before the police sweep in and kill them all....)

END OF SPOILER

Read whatever you want into this sadistic mess--an allegory! a metaphor! social commentary!--but the bottom line for me is this: The film's lack of emotional payoff is not worth sitting through the countless scenes of animal abuse. The completely unnecessary scene in the tunnel with the little white terrier convinces me the director is as horrible as the characters he presents, no matter what he says in the bonus commentary.",1438560000,5,1532,4.719101123595506
7127026,1,B00W9JQ5B8,"This movie is an excellent choice if you are looking for targets for skeet shooting. Other than that I can't imagine any reason for the making of this film. It has no redeeming qualities. There are no characters that I could find any sympathy for. Even the lead dogs weren't that appealing. That was because one isn't given any chance to see a relationship develop between Lili and her dog Hagen. Before this I had never met I dog I wasn't drawn to. Hagen, in my opinion, was justified in all of his actions, but there is no way he would have behaved that way. (I'm trying not to drop to too many spoilers). I am visiting Budapest next month and I hope the people there are not as horrible as they have been portrayed by this movie. There wasn't one nice adult - or child - even Lili forgot about Hagen quickly. Her mother took off with no provisions made for Hagen. She had to know the laws against mixed breed dogs and that Hagen would be taken from Lili almost immediately.  The mother had money to spend the summer in Australia but none for the tiny fee that could have been paid to save Hagen and Lili's heart ache. Could there actually be an adult (non serial killer material) that would murder a sweet little Jack Russell terrier?

I felt very reluctant to see it at first, not wanting to see any animals being abused or hurt.  Only after reading that all the fights were the result of great training using positive reinforcements and that all the dogs in the film were from shelters that have all been adopted, did I feel reassured enough to watch it.  And I am glad.  One sees the world through Hagen's eyes as he's torn from the loving arms of Lili in an instant and experiences cruelties that humans are capable of.  The dog actors - two portrayed Hagen - did a superb job showing Hagen's progression from a gentle companion to a ferocious fighter out for revenge.

Camera and editing is adroit, and the story works well despite the fact that it's a sort of contemporary fable shot in real locations. Only real weakness is the other human actors, who have a much more limited range than the dogs.

7127035,5,B00W9JQ5B8,"The negative reviews here have totally missed the point of the movie. The film's dramatization of the harsher scenes on the movie are all effects. Honestly, seeing the dog get dumped was more heartwremching for me than some of the more ""gruesome"" scenes. It's. All. Acting. And the fact that people are so disturbed by the movie is essentially the purpose of the movie. To evoke an emotion no one can easily ignore. No one who loves dogs wants to see or imagine one being abused but the movie shines a light of the real life atrocities going on in the world. It's even somewhat comparable to Rise of the Planet of the Apes if you ask me, except here they opted for real dogs as opposed to CGI to make it more realistic, bravo. This is not a bad film by any means. As a dog lover I truly enjoyed his film because it speaks to my passion and gives dogs the upper hand in this fantasy thriller. The basic message is: humans often think they can mistreat other beings because we believe we're in control, that we're the ""White God,"" but imagine a world where those we've mistreated fight back. It's a dog revolution and it was a thrilling ride. Appreciate the movie for what it is and its purpose and don't hate on it because you can't take a few scenes of movie magic.",1438214400,58,1265,4.341772151898734

7127038,1,B00W9JQ5B8,Watched this after listening to a Terry Gross (Fresh Air) interview. I've always respected Terry and her views/interviews - she just went down a notch in my minds eye. What Terry should be doing is - preparing people - that is - telling people in an honest and forth coming way - this is a very disturbing story about a dog and in some instances - the harsh realities of a stray dog's life. Terry Gross focused only on the fascination of the true-to - life - dog- trainer that trained the two lead dogs - both playing the same dog (Hagen) - only one pulled off the tougher side of Hagen - the other- the kinder -gentler Hagen. I'm telling you folks - I do not recommend this movie. When done well - I enjoy sub-titled - foreign films. The writing and acting is horrible. Yes - it's incredible what the trainer did to train these two lead dogs. And yes - managing all these dogs was impressive - but still- the story is dark and ends even darker. You would be better off going down to the pound and looking the homeless dogs in the eyes for a few hours - that is how this film will leave you . . . feeling sad and bad. What were they thinking when they wrote and filmed this movie. I am sorry I watched it - so disappointed the way Terry Gross presented it. No wonder it has not done well at the box office. I'm warning all my friends and family and who ever reads this review - pass on this film - no matter what the idiot Cannes people have said about White God - By - the - way the title is as perplexing as the movie.,1438128000,7,1520,4.07
7127039,5,B00W9JQ5B8,"One of the best films of 2015. ""White God"" is a profoundly moving film that works as an exciting action movie as well as an insightful commentary on man's inhumanity to man and how much of the cruelty with which we treat each other is rooted in how we treat our four-legged friends.

The dogs were trained to play as if they were fighting. I guess they had a good time doing the fight scene. Plus, the fighting dog sounds were actually made by HUMANS! When I tried to make the same kind of sounds, I scared the daylights out of my cat!
Second, this is a great story and I am absolutely in love with the little girl. She is terrific in the lead role.

7127042,4,B00W9JQ5B8,"Nine Things About the Film ""White God"" (Hungary, 2014)

1. Not since the 2000 Mexican classic ""Amores Perros"" have dogs been used as such an effective allegory for the human experience.

2. This remarkable Hungarian film is about a girl named Lili, and her dog, Hagen. They are both misunderstood by the girl's father, and everybody suffers for that.

3. When Lili and Hagen are separated, they follow parallel but separate tracks, each learning the cruelties of their own worlds. They learn what it means to be taken advantage of, and what it takes to survive.

4. Eventually, the dog and human worlds are inverted, and the dogs have the chance to change their destinies.

5. There are scenes of animal cruelty that will bother some sensitive viewers.

6. While the highlight of the film is the dog uprising, it's important to note that it doesn't occupy very much of the film. The point of the film is what leads to the uprising.

7. Hundreds of dogs were used in the filming of this movie - some were rescued from animal shelters to make the movie, and were given homes afterwards. The main dog, Hagen, was played remarkably well by two sibling dogs. The dogs were given a special acting award at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival.

8. The ending of the film is kind of mysterious; I'm still trying to figure it out.

9. The obvious interpretation of the film is that it is a social commentary on racism, though it can apply equally well to any ""out group"" of society that reaches its breaking point. But however you interpret it, this is a unique movie with haunting imagery and a relevant message.",1436572800,27,1598,4.598591549295775
7127043,5,B00W9JQ5B8,"Some may remember the Samuel Fuller film ""White Dog"" (1982) that explored the ingraining of racist tendencies in canines trained to attack. That is a clear influence here. This Hungarian film gets revenge on the humans who plot likewise by focusing on mongrel dogs that rise up against their human oppressors. But ""White God"" is more than a revenge fantasy. It is a heartfelt look at what it means to co-exist with other living beings, and the sacrifices we make to gain understanding of the ""other""---be it someone from a different race, class, gender, generation, profession, or even species. While the unifying links in the narrative might be familial respect, or even music, the dramatic intensity of ""White God"" propels the narrative to a standoff conclusion where survival depends on not only a sense of understanding and compassion, but of submission as well.",1432425600,48,866,5.062937062937063

8712565,3,B00W9JQ5B8,"This was a beautifully original theme that failed to live up to its promise. The metaphor of an uprising of brutalized dogs, symbolizing voiceless peoples who have had enough of their oppression and are now banding together and cannot be stopped, could have led to all sorts of transformational messages. But the message of this film seemed to be that fighting the system is hopeless and it is best to just just lie down and surrender. Even worse, it suggested that the violence unleashed when the oppressed band together to fight the system that has oppressed them i terrifying and leads nowhere.

The film itself was well shot, the characters are well developed, the scenery is compelling, the dogs surprisingly good actors. But the film offered virtually nothing redeeming, no vision for overcoming oppression, no glimpse of how humans and animals might better live together, no notion of transformation.

The film was made in Hungary, a former Soviet satellite that after having turned toward democracy has now fallen for fascism, and it is difficult not to speculate that the film itself is expressive of undercurrents now roiling through Hungarian society. The characters in the film demonstrate the coldness and heartlessness that one might expect from a former communist country, and this sets the groundwork for the uprising of dogs. But the most depressing element of the film is that in a society which has developed substantially, both politically and economically, the one movie to come out of it in years would suggest no opportunities for transformation of the system. The best we can hope for is to lie down and wait to be put down, and that is about as conservative a message as one can imagine.

Hungary can do better and has no excuse not to do better; the same applies to America and this film.",1502150400,,1814,4.90228013029316
