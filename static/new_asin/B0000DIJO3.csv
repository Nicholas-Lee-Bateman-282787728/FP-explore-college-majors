8001172,5,B0000DIJO3,A strange film in that John Liu shows an emotional range and acting skill missing from many of his films but only shows his kicking abilities towards the end. The plot of rural people press ganged into a gold mine is pretty ludicrous and the repeated escapes and punishments get very repetitive. But finally John Liu is trained by the foreman Chui Chung Hei (who is pretty active and has a good fight) and the final fight with the 'Master' (played by Chai Hau Keung I believe) is well done. Paul Wei Ping Ao has a meaty part and Chin Lung plays well Chin Lung really with support from Ma Yue Fung. Not a great film but just watch John Liu doing the splits and controlling his (right) foot has its attractions. Fine if you want to see John Liu in a slightly unusual film.,1525219200,,770,4.317241379310345
8001173,3,B0000DIJO3,"My daughter loved the action, the anguish the hero is put through, and the skill of the kung fu. So, I'm rating it for her. I'd give it a two, she probably a four. So, split the difference.",1453248000,,189,4.0
8001174,4,B0000DIJO3,"I am a John Liu fan so getting a copy of this flick was a no-brainer.  The story is a standard play on the imprisoned hero, and it features the requisite training scenes.  But I liked that it was a bit harsher than the average old school kung fu movie and John's kicks are great if somewhat unidimensional (and mostly done with his right leg!).

The movie seemed to be striving to be more than a simple vehicle for fighting, and at times it succeeds. It has a few inventive touches but the fights are the real story.

I have the Pagoda Films Premium Collection edition of this DVD.  This was part of an ongoing series of special editions produced by Crash Cinema.  The films were supposed to be restored and include special features.  This DVD is a step up from many of the Crash Cinema and Venom Mob DVDs, but this film has not been given a full restoration and there are scratches on the print (most noticeable at the beginning and maybe at points where the film reel changes over).  Colors are pretty good for an old kung fu movie from 1979, and the widescreen helps give perspective that is missing from many of the old cropped martial arts movies. Audio is dubbed English only.

The DVD case cover insert says the movie runs 92 minutes; my DVD player says it is just under 95 minutes.  Seems uncut.  There are some pretty limited special features, but there is a nice set of bonus fights from ""Cantonen Iron Kung Fu"" and ""Super Dragon, The Bruce Lee Story.""

Other films in the Pagoda series included ""The Story in Temple Red Lily,"" ""Cantonen Iron Kung Fu,"" ""the Incredible Kung Fu Mission,"" ""My Kung Fu Twelve Kicks,"" and ""The Amsterdam Connection.""",1398470400,4,1655,4.498327759197324
