8309554,1,B001HT7YJ8,"Sorry about the poor review but this video was poorly done.  I'm not sure who your intended audience is?  Perhaps first day students?  Although, I am training and I won't show it to my students.  It's definitely not the 'complete' guide.
And the woman getting her face lasered??  She's obviously in pain.  How about some numbing gel and ultra sound gel?  AND, since you are making a video, you could have turned the level down.  I was actually uncomfortable watching that demonstration.
I tossed that video in the trash.",1502496000,2,520,4.764044943820225
8309555,5,B001HT7YJ8,This is a really fantastic DVD.  It is full of vital information that will allow me to use my new IPL machine and use it safely.  It is full of great techniques that ensure successful hair removal.  I have struggled with a lot of facial hair my entire life.  I have to have things waxed and tweezed.  I was so excited to get my own IPL machine and now I am so excited to have all the information I need to do a great job and achieve the results that I wanted.  There is great detail in the instructions so that it is easy to do a thorough job and do it right.  This is a great tool to have and is full of excellent information.  I am so excited to see what I have achieved a few months down the road.  Tutorials are no good if they are not easy to understand and this one is easy to follow.  I am very pleased with this purchase.,1475280000,,829,3.910179640718563

8309557,5,B001HT7YJ8,What attracted me to this DVD was that it features the world renowned Mark B. Taylor who to anyone in the industry is hugely admired for his vast knowledge in dermatology. He's truly a leader in his field amongst myself and my colleagues and we have previously learned a lot about his practice and the way he works through researching his techniques for laser hair removal. This DVD expanded my knowledge even further and I loved the step-by-step procedures which were easy to follow. It was also great to learn more about the science behind how the hair removal procedures work as well as the marketing aspect and other useful tips for our practice.,1411603200,,650,4.7105263157894735
8309558,1,B001HT7YJ8,"The Complete Guide to Laser Hair Removal video should be avoided. The first 30 minutes is an infomercial hocking products of all sorts and very annoying.

When the actual ""guide"" began, the little amount of information provided by the ""experts"" was terrible.  Most of the video is simply watching the laser hand piece move slowly over the body part with little, or no comments from the two ""experts"" -- at least 80% of the video should have been edited.

No info on settings, fitzpatrick skin types recommendations, pre appointment care, post appointment care, etc...

Save your money and avoid.",1321833600,15,595,4.97979797979798
