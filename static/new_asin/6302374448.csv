Random thoughts: It was nice to hear and see Alfredo Kraus still delivering those high notes with his aristocratic manner and good looks.  Handsome old dude then!  Kind of interesting to hear Caballe, despite her age and size at the time, out classing and out singing  Berganza--and this is in the lower range as well as the higher.  Always a treat to see Domingo conducting and to hear the results--Sublime, specially when the singer is Caballe!  The guy's musicianship is truly comprehensive.  The Domingo/ Juan Pons duet is not to be missed.  There is more in the 72 minute video than I want to write about.  It would have been nice to have had more Spanish music on the program, more Caballe and  Carreras and less Berganza.  For me, it was money well-spent.

Back to why they should put this on DVD: This is Seville!  This is the inauguration of a really beautiful theatre, which is probably still of some importance.  A DVD with lots of luscious menu options would capitalize on the significance and provide opps to look at singers, conductors, orchestra, rehearsals, backstage, and all the rest, if such footage is still archived somewhere.",1251504000,2,1205,4.698564593301436
