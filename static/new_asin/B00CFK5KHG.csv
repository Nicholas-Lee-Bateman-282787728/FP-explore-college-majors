5721544,4,B00CFK5KHG,"Frankly, I'm forced to give this four stars only because my niece loves it so much she'd disown me forever if I dare speak ill of her Wheels on the Bus. I'm not sure why but children are mesmerized by the poor production and silly graphics. It must be the catchy tunes that they will play over and over until you are singing ""Fill it up fill it up, the bus won't go unless you give it some gas. Fill it up all the way. You gotta fill it up if you wanna play!"" in your sleep. On your way to work. Cooking dinner. Walking the dog. This series will drive you mad... but it'll entertain your kiddos!",1445472000,2,595,4.0508474576271185
