7883043,2,6304968787,"For a budding herbalist, this is a good video for initial information and current medicinal opinions in the natural healing community.  The author is interviewed and gives his opinions and ideas, but there is no instruction  or guides for making your own healing herbal concoctions.  If you are just  starting out, it is worth seeing but becomes tedious after a while and the  video is rather primative in production.  Still, good information on the  holistic point of view, but nothing else.",937699200,9,492,5.0
