4093267,1,B00395HIX0,"The review title says it all: this movie is AWFUL. The picture quality is bad, the story is terrible, and the acting is atrocious. Don't waste your money to find out for yourself You owe me for this warning.",1322784000,3,207,4.333333333333333
4093268,1,B00395HIX0,"Truly  the most boring and brainless  film in a long time. Terrible script. When they ran out of ideas  ,they just put in another  torture and killing to pad out the  film. Predictable and  don't believe the  dvd  sleeve which states that it is loaded with nudity. There is none except for an occassional  backside  view. Funny how no one at the University notices that so many students go missing.",1319155200,4,398,4.557142857142857
4093269,1,B00395HIX0,"I had been waiting and waiting for Netflix to add this and they never did. So I finally broke down and bought it. Not a bit of fun. Dull, poorly written, acted, and directed. Bummer. Money and time down the drain. And I normally don't write any type of review for low budget movies. I kind of subscribe to ""you get what you pay for."" Well I paid way too much.",1318550400,5,359,4.070422535211268
4093270,1,B00395HIX0,"Silly ""horror"" movie about a bunch of brainless college kids trying to get into a fraternity.  They have to pass a test which involves spending the night in a closed amusement park on an island.  Naturally the other fraternity brothers plan to sneak aboard and scare the pledges.  Naturally there's a deranged killer in a clow suit wandering around killing everybody.  And then there's a bunch of ghosts thrown in...

Stupid and boring.  For one thing all these actors are way over college age...and look it.  For another the acting is abysmal.  There's not one good acting job here.  The script is hopeless--full of bad jokes and terrible dialogue.  The killings are largely bloodless and not even remotely scary.  The only remotely interesting part of this is a cute guy who has a nude scene at the beginning (back view only)...but that's hardly enough to recommend the movie.  Skip this one.",1281052800,5,894,4.847682119205298
4093271,5,B00395HIX0,"Fraternity Massacre at Hell Island is a humorous throw-back to those 80's slasher movies, only with a twist. Instead of women being stalked and killed, here it's mostly guys. And some of them are gay. This movie is just a lot of fun. The only problem I had with it was the ghost subplot. But other than that, this is a refreshing entry in the slasher genre.",1280448000,2,357,4.343283582089552
4093272,1,B00395HIX0,"I bought this movie because I thought it would be a lot of fun and the premise to the movie and cover art work was promising. Well, boy was I fooled. The movie fails to be a comedy horror and fails to be a scary horror movie- it just fails all the way around. The acting is really bad and the movie doesn't really go anywhere. The direction is not good either.  It's very slow moving and near the end you will find yourself fast forwarding to get through the rest of it. I really should have rented this one before buying it because this was a gigantic waste of money. 1/5",1273449600,2,572,4.107142857142857
8391989,1,B00395HIX0,"this is the second time i tried to watch this film, the first time i just couldn't get into the story, and this time i could, but just wasn't entertained enough to watch the whole thing...really a waste of time.",1514937600,,211,4.3
8391990,4,B00395HIX0,"Not a great movie, but fun to watch.  It's more like a cult type film.  You can't take it serious as a horror movie.  The acting is mostly believable and some scenes are rather sexy.",1486857600,,182,4.142857142857143

8391992,3,B00395HIX0,"This movie is a mixed bag. Tyler Farrell is acting in a movie, most of the cast is acting in a stage play and the others, bless their hearts. Tyler is definitely the standout in the cast. The plot is all over the place, some of it is amusing, some of it is eyerollingly bad. The writing is pretty atrocious. It's still worth a little time knowing you're going in to a bad slasher flick.",1466467200,,386,4.16

8391995,1,B00395HIX0,"There is big budget, there is low budget and then we have ""Fraternity Massacre at Hell Island"" They should have paid me to watch as much as I could. 30 minutes was all I could manage. Everything was bad so it doesn't merit my time to individualize anything....don't do it.",1399420800,,272,4.46

  this movie is fun to watch and ready for a part two if so count me in",1394409600,,166,3.7142857142857144
8391997,1,B00395HIX0,"One of the worst-b movies I have ever seen it lacks any humor or camp factor, without any redeeming qualities, time waster.",1388966400,,123,4.636363636363637
8391998,3,B00395HIX0,"When you watch a movie titled ""Fraternity Massacre at Hell Island,"" you don't expect an Oscar winning film. You're hoping for fun, silly trash. Well, that's what I feel like my friends and I got when we watched this movie at a GLBT film festival many years back. We had a good time. Sometimes we still talk about how the old woman in the movie would not call the police to report the killer because they might cut the funding at the mental hospital. This movie is funny. It's definitely not as good as Hellbent, but it is fun.",1340928000,,526,4.3232323232323235
