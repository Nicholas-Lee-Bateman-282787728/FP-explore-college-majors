I have used the videos to enhance my hands-on DIY upholstery training, I watch a section of a video, then put into practice what Merv taught on the video.  Merv covers all the bases in upholstering. In addition to the videos, if you have a question you can go to Mervs web site discussion area, ask the question and get an answer. I have now progressed to the point where we have started a home business based on what we have learned in these Videos. Merv will never win an oscar but then again he is no actor but is an outstanding instructor.",971740800,,633,4.319327731092437
