8579007,5,B00CA4S1XW,Have to love Groucho if yo grew up watching him the younger generation but not enjoy as much as us older guyes,1457481600,,110,4.045454545454546
8579008,5,B00CA4S1XW,"As good quality as can be expected. It should be noted however that the episodes I have seen so far are from reruns which were cropped to hide the sponsor's logo and the network logo on the microphone has been burned through. The quality is good, though, and I bought it to see Groucho, not the sponsors, so if you want to buy it for your You Bet Your Life collection, I still recommend this set.",1456444800,,396,4.223684210526316
8579009,4,B00CA4S1XW,"nice set of Groucho stuff. Some YBYL episodes seem to be on other compilations, but nice to have this anyway. Most are *complete shows, and the re-mastering of the video portions of the episodes cleaned them up quite nicely. Better video than many of the ""other"" YBYL dvd's that are out there.  There has been some editing done, usually the opening credits or end credits and plugs, but edited and pieced together nicely. I had to laugh because disk 1 episode 1 opens with a 1958 Desoto commercial, yet another commercial on this same episode advertises the 1954 Desoto. oops!..someone wasn't paying attention. The episodes seem to have been transferred from film or film negatives, not kinescopes. Audio quality could have been better though. Most episodes, the audio is quite low. That's why it only gets 4 stars instead of 5.",1450656000,2,828,4.872340425531915

8579015,5,B00CA4S1XW,"This set of Groucho TV shows includes some footage never seen elsewhere, including outtakes that were too racy for its time (1950s) to be shown on TV, and over fifteen shows, most of very high quality, considering that they were kinescopes made long before videotape. Groucho was one of a kind, and I'm thankful that his wit is preserved for all time . . . and holds up very well if one discounts the occasional chauvenism that was acceptable for its time.",1413158400,4,456,4.573170731707317
