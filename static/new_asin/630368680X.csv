I've sat through sales training seminars that preach some of the same  ""closing techniques"" as used by Kurt Russell, only not done  nearly as funny.

711997,5,630368680X,"from beginning to end, everything you ever suspected that was dishonest and underhanded about the used car business is confirmed in Used Cars. Kurt and the delisciously wicked cast force one to laugh as they scheme,conive  and physically demonstrate the up-to-date-art of slick,slap-stick;  performances that will stay fixed in ones memory and make you chuckle for  the rest of your life. Like ""Quest For Fire"", USED CARS deserves a  permanent place in ones home library, even if ones hair isn't the same  color as the tires. BOB",937440000,,529,5.0344827586206895
711998,5,630368680X,"""Used Cars"" is the mother, or ugly stepmother, of great American bathroom humor. Long before the politically-correct craze of ""Forrest Gump,"" director and co-writer Robert Zemeckis spit up ""Used  Cars"" with a little help from executive producer Steven Speilberg. Not  quite sweet enough for 'Gump-isms,' ""Used Cars"" explores the  seedy world of the car lot and the stereotypical husslers running the  joint. With gags that include strippers atop automobiles, reeling  a  customer across a busy city street with $20 hooked to a fishing line and a  commercial jammed during a presidential address, ""Used Cars"" rips  apart middle America to the tune of 50,000 laughs per second. Kurt Russell  shines as the cheeseball in charge in one of his first post-Disney era  films. Russell gets plenty of support from an ensemble cast that includes  Gerrit Graham, Frank McRae, Joe Flaherty, Deborah Harmon and David L.  Lander and Michael McKean (better known in the early 80s as Lennie and  Squiggy). However, the real salesman is veteran actor Jack Warden who  easily handles a dual role of twin brothers with competing car lots.  Although not likely to appear on Zemeckis's or Speilberg's Oscar-winning  resumes, ""Used Cars"" is hilarious, sharp and clever. I consider  this vehicle one of the greatest comedic rides ever made. Trust me.",924998400,2,1327,5.183962264150943

712306,5,630368680X,"I was intrigued when I read on the opening credits that this film was executive produced by Steven Spielberg and John Milius.  You couldn't find two people more on the polar opposite of the ideological spectrum than them.  After watching ""Used Cars"" it makes sense.  The Robert Zemeckis film which he co-scripted with Bob Gale plays like a cross between Ayn Rand and Frank Capra.  The beauty of this subversive film is that it is so hilarious and corrosive that you will hardly notice.  Rudy Russo, played with equal parts smarm and charm by a young Kurt Russell, is so appealing and likable even if he's selling you a lemon that you can't help rooting for him.  Rudy is Everyman even if he is fleecing you out of your life savings.  Russell is matched by Jack Warden doing double duty as the Fuchs Brothers, two men on opposite ends of the ethics scale.  Lots of cool cameos that include David Lander and Michael McKean (Lenny and Squiggy from TV's ""Laverne and Shirley"") as well as ""Grampa"" Al Lewis as a hanging judge.  This toxic classic got barely a nibble at the box office in the Summer of '80 when it was initially released.  Maybe its time has finally come.",1514678400,,1166,4.535885167464115

Kurt Russell is at his youthful, earnest prime. All of the supporting cast is having fun, too, and it shows.

Together with the help of a great supporting cast, including Toby (real name not known), have created the exact used car lot environment. Jack Warden plays brothers that are more believable than, Lindsay Lohan. Throw in Al Lewis as Judge Harrison and approximately a mile of cars, then you have a movie.

As always, Kurt Russell is great, but the story line of the rag-tag group versus the evil, wealthy group has been played to death. There are many laughs, but the overall story is not great.

My friends (who are highly educated snobs) loved it. I bought it on VHS and watched it several times till my machine broke. Now I'm buying it again on DVD. Why? Because the acting is great and the comic lines are truly funny. Yeah, it's a 1980 flick made in Mesa, Arizona (suburb of Phoenix) but there is a wonderful timelessness about it.

Want 2 other wonderful comedies? Buy 1941 here on Amazon and It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. Both are wonderful. And yes, Mad World came out in 1962 or '63 but is still either THE or one of the funniest movies ever made. No cursing or swearing. Just fun, zany comedy with excellent stunt work by some of the best comedians who ever lived.  Buy all 3 of these movies or watch 'em on line via Amazon.",1462579200,,889,4.162790697674419

Fast forward 20-some odd years and I find myself working at an auto dealership in the parts and service department whose primary means of sales are used cars.  Down the street is the other partner of this dealership with his OWN dealership.  Yes, there's a division between this group.  Now Used Cars is even funnier and more truer than ever.

USED CARS: How can you not love a film in which the first word uttered is the F bomb? But how can I recommend a flick that begins as the most aggressively anarchic comedy since the Marx Bros. made movies, then slows into a dumb love story, and eventually shifts into reverse, as a formulaic, feel-good, clich-ridden car chase flick? Here's how: Don't watch it all the way to the end. You'll only be disappointed. You know the good guys are gonna win--and after watching V8-motormouth Rudy in action, baiting and skating and cynically scheming, you do *not* want to see him morally redeemed in the name of love. Watch it instead as 65 minutes of manic anarchy and obscene cynicism. The high points of the movie are the pirate commercials; after the ""Marshall Lucky"" sequence (a rabid masterpiece of commercial lampooning), just turn the movie off! And be thankful we got even *that* much brilliance stuffed into one film!",1422489600,,1179,4.614285714285714

714124,5,630368680X,"This film is precisely between a 4 star(good) and 5 star(great) comedy, so I was slightly generous.
Kurt Russell and Jack Warden starred in this simplistic but fun romp about used cars.
In the film, Kurt Russell is a young, aggressive used car salesman who wants it all: sales success and even appreciation by everyone(i.e. politics.)  The car lot where he works is dominated by a more successful one across the street run by a tyrant(Jack Warden).  They have a no-holds barred battle which is the stuff of movie comedy history.  Meanwhile, Russell is told by the local politicos that he has to produce $$$ for 'campaign contributions' before he can be tabbed as a candidate.  While this is going on, the owner(Jack Warden in a wonderful dual role) passes away and his naive daughter takes over.  She makes an ad that is compromised and made to appear that she made false promises. She has to produce a 'promised' mile of cars or she'd be shut down.  What follows is a crazy dash to deliver a mile of cars for the court to witness.
Now, no aspect of the case against her would stand up in a kangaroo court let alone an American one...no reasonable person would expect a mile of cars and proving damages would be interesting also.
OK, Hollywood makes dramatic contrivances to make the plot work.  We can wink and nod and let it go.
This film is a slow developing comedy that just takes you on a wild ride.  In that way, it's like Kurt Russell's other zany hit, Big Trouble in Little China.
If you have never seen this film, you must get it.  You will never see it on broadcast TV or non-premium cable in its whole form because it's replete with adult language and no-holds barred humor.",1419897600,,1685,4.516447368421052
714125,4,630368680X,"Used Cars(released July/80)stars,among others,Kurt Russell,Jack Warden,Gerrit Graham and Deborah Harmon. Jack Warden plays two parts as bickering twin brothers in this comedy from 1980 that I had not seen since its debut. I have always recalled Russell's catch phrase""Trust Me"" and remembered the film had its share of good laughs. What I did not recall was that it was co-executive produced by Spielberg and that Robert(Back to the Future)Zemeckis was the director.
The story finds Russell as a used car salesman on a run down,past its prime car lot. He and his buds will do and say just about anything to get a sale of their product...which are pieces of junk. The film focuses plenty on the salesmen and the dirty tricks they play on their customers. However the main part of the film lies with the owner of the lot,Jack Warden. He is a kindly gent and Russell and he are closerthanthis. Warden has two things against him:A heart condition and his conniving twin brother across the street who competes with him,with his own more honest car lot.
The bad twin across the street has been wanting to get a hold of his brothers lot for years and one day pulls a real nasty trick. He gets a demolition car driver to go across the street and get Warden to go on a test drive with him. The car is a beautiful /57 Chevy which Warden personally re-did. Well the drive was designed to give Warden a heart attack and it does. Once back Warden,in total distress,falls to the floor in his office and dies before Russell and the staff's eyes. Knowing what Warden's brother across the street would do if he saw his brother dead,they decide to act as if nothing is wrong. However,and clandestinely,they decide to place Warden in a late 50s Edsel that has been on a crane hook out front of the lot for years. They bring it down and put it in an abandoned car pit out back and fill it in.
Everything is going alright until Warden's long lost daughter comes a calling after all these years(10 to be exact).In the beginning Russell lies to her about her father,saying he has gone to Miami Beach. The mean brother across the street comes a calling and starts sniffing around. He has a hunch and finds the roof of the Edsel under the dirt out back of the lot. He returns to his domain,gets his lawyer to get a search warrant and the next day returns with the police. However Kurt has gotten wind of what was going to happen and has dug the car out .At the opportune time at a nearby location,he starts the Edsel up and points it towards a propane tank across the street near the other brother's lot. It of course ends up exploding,which is to be Russell and the gang's easy out as far as his death goes. But the phone call to give Russell the heads up from another employee in the first place,is listened to in toto by Warden's daughter(on an answering machine).She arrives at the lot shortly before the dead Warden's car explodes. She is of course livid but doesn't turn Russell in. Instead she locks them all out and they have no jobs to go to. She decides to run the car lot herself.
Her business suffers as she has had no experience with selling cars before. To speed the inevitable along,mean brother across the street decides to hire someone to fiddle with some video tape of his niece doing a car commercial. Her tape now claims that she has a mile of cars on her lot. This gives him the leverage to sue her and take her to court for false advertising. Russell hears about it and rushes to the court room. When the opposing lawyer(played by Joe Flaherty from SCTV)asks her about her claim of a mile of cars being false,Russell tells her to say it is true!? The court judge(played by Al ""Grampa Munster"" Lewis) adjourns the court for the next day at the lot to see if it can be proved.
Russell rallies around 250 student drivers and buys about that same amount of used cars from his car source(for the lot) with money he was saving to buy his way into politics with. The cars are miles away from the lot and time is not on their side. After some nail biting moments, the cars finally arrive on the lot ,but they're one short. That one car is being driven by one of the salesmen ,who finds out beneath the paint of the car he has,it is actually red....bad voodoo for him. Russell calls him and with some persuasion finally convinces him to get there....as fast as he can. As the judge declares they are 18' short,in drives the last car. As they measure and declare they are still two inches short,the back license plate drops down as if it was listening,to give them the needed length. Cheers go up and the lot is saved. Russell and Warden's daughter hug and Flaherty announces to them that a new expressway ramp will be going in across the street and that they will become the biggest dealership in town.
There is actually more to this story than what I have said. Mixed in with all this are not only the shenanigans of Russell and his buds competing with Warden's mean brother across the street(like almost-nude disco dancers),but illegally broadcasting signals over regular TV airwaves to insert commercials into for free,his superstitious bud Graham,the black ex army mechanic McRae,Warden's ever so smart Beagle,Russell's bid to get into politics,etc. Its a bag chock full of surprises and with lots of laughs,some played low,but also with lots of drama and thrills thrown in for good measure.
Technically speaking the film is in its original w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is generally clear and crisp. Extras include commentary by Russell and the producer,the trailer,a TV spot,raw outtakes and much more.
All in all this is a pleasing comedy from 1980. It shows its year( Disco music and moves are still on display!) but Russell,et al,do a bang up job in this fast moving comedy with a lot of twists and turns. It still holds its own,which is high praise for a film of this genre and age. 3 1/2-4 stars.",1419897600,,5887,4.533834586466165

Kurt Russell makes the role of Rudy Russo his own and Jack Warden is perfectly cast as brothers Luke and Roy Fuchs, mouthing off obscenities with the same relish that Kenneth Branagh recites Shakespeare. The film isn't polite and doesn't try to be, proudly wearing its R-rated badge. This is my favorite Robert Zemeckis film, made before the success of BACK TO THE FUTURE steered him away from writing/directing good movies with moderate budgets, to just directing--for the most part--more expensive but less risky films. If you already own the DVD then this Blu-ray is worth the upgrade. Also, the commentary track with Zemeckis, fellow co-writer/producer Bob Gale, and Kurt Russell is one of the most entertaining ones you'll ever hear.",1419033600,7,871,5.0137931034482754

715035,5,630368680X,"Used Cars is one of those comedies that keep people laughing forever. Directed by Robert Zemeckis and has a notable cast with Kurt Russell, Jack Warden, Michael McKean, Gerrit Graham, Frank McRae, and older Al Lewis. The humor is satirical, physical, and black. The humor is very similar John Landis' comedies.
 The plot is about a failing used car lot with a devious manager Rudy(Russell), womanizing salesman Jeff(Graham), crude mechanic Jim(McRae), and a heart problemed owner Luke(Warden). Luke's corrupt twin brother Roy(Warden) owns a successful used car lot across the road and wants to buy Luke's lot at all costs. Rudy, Jeff, Jim, and friends resort to crazy antics to gain public attention, boost car sales, ruin Roy's business, and keep Roy off their backs.
 The movie is satirical on business and politics in general and automotives. (The following are not spoilers) Rudy is a sterotype of a politician, Jeff is a stereotype of a salesman and/or workaholic, Jim is a stereotype of a blue-collar worker(especially truckers), and Roy is a stereotypical businessman. A big satire on business in this movie is sex, violence, and fraud used in advertising to boost sales.

715110,4,630368680X,"A movie very much in the Smokey and The Bandit/Animal House/Blues Brothers vein: somewhat to alot ""over-the-top"" but very funny and very entertaining.
The best performance I've ever seen delivered by Kurt Russell; Jack Warden is predictably excellent (playing two completely different characters!); Deborah Harmon's acting also is notable, in the role of the returning home hippie daughter of the ""nice"" Fuch brother.
Loaded with intelligent satire; beautifully cut and photographed - the competing car lots along that miserable strip of highway in somewhere, USA, in 1980. The stunts and sight gags are terrific. The Director and Writers put together some genuinely funny slapstick.
Kurt Russell's band of theives is something to behold, a lead Tech. who will do anything to keep a car on the road - or should I say, on the lot. An assistant whose superstitousness always seems to creep up on him at the wrong time - like when Russell is trying to orchestrate a tidal wave of wrecks down the highway to arrive at the lot in time to fulfill an advertising pledge.
Like most comedies, it runs maybe 12-15 minutes too long and gets just a little silly as the viewer starts to wonder when the pot has been stirred for the final time.
Not fully successful as a ""Black"" comedy; the underlying dramatic theme is about how the almighty dollar and jealousy and over-competitiveness can ruin a family...and a family business. The ""mean"" Fuch's cold-hearted reaction to his Brother's apparent stroke (witnessed through binoculars) strains the happy feel of the film to that point.
Occasional bad taste and the aforementioned dragged out ending leave the film as a Cult Classic...but a memorable one.
Fans of Jack Warden might also reference his work in ""So Fine"", another heavy-duty lampoon (of the New York Garment District).
Fans of Al Lewis (""Car 54"" and ""The Munsters"") will enjoy seeing him in something totally unusal - he plays a Judge.

Plot:  Thin plot about two rival used car dealers--both brothers and both played by Jack Warden.  The good guy--the shabbier, of course, must fend off his predatory brother who wants the shabby dealership since the nice place is scheduled to become an off-ramp.

With a cynical view of life, ordinary folks' intelligence, politics, and the inherent corruption of man, the film is light--and dark-- comedy.

The script delivers many punchy, if old, lines and Kurt Russell heads a cast of oleaginous con men (and women) who deliver them well.

715164,5,630368680X,"This movie is a classic comedy from 1980 about the used car business. There are 2 brothers, Luke Fuchs and Roy L. Fuchs (say that name fast 5 times).  Each has a used car lot, across the street from the other. Roy L. wants his brother's car lot so bad that he will do anything to get it.  Meanwhile there is the competition thing between the brothers.  This movie is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  FYI-there is language, nudity, and sex.  Once you watch this movie, you may never buy a used car again.

The movie begins with Rudy Russo (Kirk Russell) setting back the odometer on an old Buick clunker and using a wad of bubblegum to re-attach the bumper.  There is an interesting cast here.  Another young salesman is the ladies man.  The mechanic and the dog Toby compliment the cast. Toby is quite the little actor himself and has been seen participating in the sale of a car.  The real acting is Jack Warden, playing dual roles as Luke and Roy L. Luke is easy going and has a bad heart.  Royal L. is a cutthroat and wants his brother DEAD!  Meanwhile, Rudy wants to sell cars and make $10,000, so he can buy his bid in for a Senate seat. These boys at Luke's lot will stop at nothing to sell cars either! (It's not a taxi.  That's just yellow primer!)

Luke has a daughter but Royal figures she is out of the picture, since no one has heard from her for about 10 years, no knowing that Luke and Barbara have just spoken on the phone.  Royal sends one of his guys over to help his brother have a heart attack.  After that episode, Luke disappears and Royal can't figure out if he is dead or alive.  It just gets wilder and wilder with the schemeing to sell cars, keep Barbara in the dark, get Rudy to the Senate, and keep Roy L's hands off the car lot.  Is Luke really away on a fishing trip? Or is he dead?

Besides being funny as heck, this movie is a walk down memory lane with the old cars, men's white shoes, men's leisure suits, plaid sports coats and sideburns. I believe this might have been filmed in the Phoenix area.  Grandpa Munster is the wierd hanging judge and Lennie and Squiggie (Laverne and Shirley) play electronic technicians.

This is a movie to buy and add to your collection.  You will likely watch it over and over again.  You will even want to watch friends as they react to it.",1175212800,2,2320,4.258581235697941

715166,4,630368680X,"This was NOT one of Kirk Russell's finer moments, but an admirable effort was given not only by him, but most of the cast as well. This was Russell on the edge of greatness in 1980....a year later, he appeared in a role that would be so shockingly different from ""Used Cars"" that he seemed like a different person. He landed the lead role in John Carpenter's ""Escape from New York"", then followed it with Carpenter's gore-fest remake of ""The Thing"".

There's not much more I can add that hasn't already been said about the late, great Jack Warden, who passed away in 2006. Playing the dual role of feuding brothers Roy and Luke Fuchs, Warden shines but not the Oscar caliber performance that earned him two Best Supporting actor nominations (Shampoo and Heaven Can Wait).

Gerrit Graham, if he'd been given the opportunity, could have carried this movie by himself. He's Russell's superstitious friend and fellow salesman. Graham certainly had some of the funnier moments in the film. In his most memorable scene, Graham, in yet another illegally broadcast commercial, dressed up as cowboy, proclaims that the price of this car is ""too f@#king high!"", and then begins blasting happily away at the auto with a 12-guage shotgun.

Cheryl Rixon's all-too-brief 'accidental' strip-tease is one of the other highlights of the film. Rixon had gained fame as a Penthouse Pet, then later, the magazine's Pet of the Year in 1979.

This is a great movie for a rainy day or when PBS is having yet another fund drive (big yawn followed by zzzzzzz). The film has its ups and downs, but overall, a solid B+, with some great sight gags.

Kirk Russell was just approaching the zenith of his career, and it's interesting to see him in this kind of role. Like many veteran actors, he's had his share of stinkers (Big Trouble in Little China), but 'Used Cars' seems to fall somewhere in the middle.

Jack Warden is gone now, God rest his soul, but he went on to play other memorable roles...'While You Were Sleeping', 'The Replacements', ""Crazy Like A Fox' (TV).

Never quite reaching the star status of his fellow actor Russell, Gerrit Graham sort of faded into quiet obscurity, taking roles in low-budget horror fare like 'Child's Play' and 'C.H.U.D. 2, Bud's CHUD'.

Cheryl Rixon still resides in L.A., and makes her living selling her own custom-designed jewelry known by the name Royal Order.

715229,5,630368680X,"The year 1980 was a remarkable year for comedic features with the release of such films as, in no particular order, Caddyshack, The Blues Brothers, Airplane!, Cheech and Chong's Next Movie, Any Which Way You Can, Hollywood Knights, and this one, titled Used Cars, which, in my opinion, sort of slipped through the cracks and never really got the attention it deserved primarily due to the fact Columbia Pictures, which released the film, did a shoddy job on promoting it when originally released to theaters.  Produced by Steven Spielberg (Jaws) and John Milius (Conan the Barbarian), the film was directed by Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Who Framed Roger Rabbit), who also co-wrote with Bob Gale (1941, Back to the Future), and stars Kurt Russell (Escape from New York), Jack Warden (Heaven Can Wait), in a dual role, and Deborah Harmon (Bachelor Party).  Also appearing is Gerrit Graham (Phantom of the Paradise), Frank McRae (*batteries not included), Joe Flaherty (""SCTV""), Michael McKean (This Is Spinal Tap), David L. Lander aka Squiggy (""Laverne & Shirley""), Alfonso `El Guapo' Arau (Three Amigos!), and Al `Grandpa' Lewis (""The Munsters"").

Russell plays Rudolph 'Rudy' Russo, a sleazy used car salesman who works in a dusty, dilapidated lot and has aspirations in becoming a politician.  As it turns out, there's an opening available in the state senate, if he can only come up with the contribution funds required by the nomination committee.  To this end Rudy uses all kinds of scams and schemes to push lemons on the public, some of which don't sit well with his boss Luke Fuchs (Warden), but it appears Luke has bigger problems in that his opportunistic brother Roy L. Fuchs (also played by Warden), who happens to run a used car dealership right across the street, has designs on Luke's lot primarily because he's got inside knowledge that a new freeway access ramp is about to be built through his own lot, so he needs his brother's property to stay in business.  Roy L., knowing of his brother's bum ticker, sets in motion a series of events that result in Luke croaking (in the hopes he'll inherit his brother's lot), but Rudy and his co-workers, including fellow salesman Jeff (Graham) and Jim (McRae), the mechanic, cover up Luke's death by hiding the body (Rudy's eulogy is a riot) and claiming he went on vacation to Miami.  With Luke gone Rudy's got free reign and initiates some gonzo promotional events, including hiring a couple pirate broadcasters (played by McKean and Lander) to steal television air time to illegally broadcast commercials, all of which heats up the competition between the competing lots.  Matters get complicated once Luke's long lost daughter Barbara (Harmon) makes the scene...as far as what happens next, best not to say too much, but eventually circumstances lead to a spectacular car chase sequence involving some 200 automobiles speeding across the southwestern desert.

This may mot have been the funniest comedy to come out in 1980 (Caddyshack gets that honor, in my opinion), but it's definitely in my top five for that year.  One of the aspects that makes this film so great is the dialogue, along with the dead on deliver by the performers.  Below are some of the more memorable lines that occur throughout the film...

`The prestige alone of owning a Buick Centurion convertible can't even be measured in terms of dollars and cents.'

`Shall we examine the spacious interior of this luxury automobile?""  (in reference to what appears to be a very used, late model Ford Pinto)

`Well old man, for 2,400 bucks it better run like a wet dream.'

`Fifty bucks never killed anybody.""

`Jeeesus Palomino!'

One should know there's plenty more, but most of them contain some form of profanity not suitable for posting here.  One of the funniest lines for me occurs when Jeff, who's extremely superstitious, is explaining how Rudy, who's in dire need of funds, should place a particular bet based purely on a series of events that happened to Jeff just prior, to which Jim, the big African American mechanic, sez `That's the dumbest f-----g s--t I've ever heard!'.  The line is funny, but it works primarily due to the delivery.  And you really have to check out Jim's salesman techniques, once he's recruited later in the film to sell cars.  Some of the best scenes for me involved two illegal broadcast commercials, the first involving a wardrobe malfunction with a busty, blonde model and the second featuring Rudy and crew exacting a little revenge on Roy L. after the latter effectively disrupted their business.  I thought all the performances were strong and straightforward, especially those by Russell and Warden, who played duel roles (his Roy L. character was the best).  The comedy does get pretty crude at times but laughs are consistent and the story moves along at a decent pace.  The characters are distinctive and memorable (check out Alfonso Arau as a sleazy, south of the border car dealer), as are many of the situations that occur throughout.  All in all I thought this an extremely funny and entertaining film, and one definitely worth checking out.  The film is rated R for language and some fine nekkidness, so it wouldn't be appropriate for younger viewers.

The picture, presented in widescreen anamorphic (the DVD case gives an aspect ratio of 1.85:1 but it looks closer to 1.78:1 to me), looks sharp and clean, and the Dolby Digital audio, available in English, French, and Portuguese, comes through very well.  Extras include subtitles in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean, and Thai, an entertaining and informative audio commentary track with Robert Zemeckis, Bob Gale (who was also a producer on the film), and star Kurt Russell, outtakes, a promotional still gallery from the film, talent files, production notes, filmographies, a TV spot, eight radio spots including a radio interview with Russell, and previews for the films So I Married an Axe Murderer (1993), Multiplicity (1996), and Groundhog Day (1993).

715233,4,630368680X,"When cineophiles think of classic 80s comedies, I would only hope that Used Cars makes their list.  I had the unique opportunity to watch this film, and it took me back to a time when bathroom humor and gross sexual jokes were not needed to create hysterical comedy.  It reminded me of a time when spontaneity and simplicity allowed for more laughter than imagined.  This was the case with Used Cars. As I am a man in the used car business, I was a bit nervous about watching this film and perhaps seeing myself muddled in the middle.  Needless to say that after watching this movie, I believe that every used car salesman (or anyone in sales for that matter) should watch Used Cars for not just Zemeckis' silly look at the profession, but because it actually does cover the true basis needed to run a successful dealership.  As I watched this film, I couldn't think that Zemeckis made Russell and Graham's characters into very creative individuals, sometimes bending the law to assist in gaining a stronger customer base.  They were smart, shrewd, and clever when it came to making the customer feel comfortable buying a car from them, which opened the door to more laughs per mile than most modern day comedies.  Used Cars is a staple in the comedy genre, demonstrating that you can spoof a career, reinvent an age old story, and use mathematics (1 mile of cars = 250 cars) all to make a viewer laugh.  It is a film that will make me laugh again and again, proving that it sustained well over the test of time.

I genuinely miss these types of comedies.  Used Cars reminded me of a combination of The Blues Brothers, Police Academy, and License to Drive.  It reminded me of a time when comedy was funny because of the language, actions, and final result.  Sure, it followed a pattern that can be seen in nearly every film from this decade, but it was a tactic that worked well for those looking to make simple audiences laugh with simple jokes. You cannot find this in today's movies at all.  What made Used Cars stand out initially is Kurt Russell's obvious enjoyment of his role and his character.  Sometimes in films like these you have comedians going through the motions, but overall it doesn't feel as if they are they for anything more than the paycheck.  That is not the case with this cast.  Either due to the direction of Zemeckis or the obviously funny script by Bob Gale, the entire cast seemed to fall neatly in place.  What made this film reach even further was the idea that each of these characters had a separate life.  They were not your clich characters that fell into the same mold.  I love that Russell wanted to run for US Senate (a great sequel could have been spawned with this idea) and that Graham's superstitions were true (enough to help Russell in a tight space).  I loved the use of McKean and Lander, obviously playing off their characters from Laverne & Shirley.  Could you imagine this film today using television stars in different roles?  It wouldn't work.  Zemeckis pulled together a great cast and Russell fit the part of the used car salesman perfectly.  I especially loved the dual role of Jack Warden, who continued to make me laugh again and again with his ancient family feud.  This film worked because of the characters and while each are flawed within the film, the actors playing them are as close to comedic perfection as you can get.

With such a strong cast in place, one would imagine that Zemeckis wouldn't have to worry about a strong story.  You couldn't be more wrong.  The 80s were a time of underdogs moving up and genuinely tangent plans coming together at the last minute.  What other film could you find 250 cars running to the desert, all helmed by high school sophomores, each bought by the evil villain from Three Amigos?  I miss these types of films.  You knew what was going to happen before it did, but you went along for the ride anyway because it was fun.  Today's comedies are only half-way there.  You watch them knowing how they will end, but the ride just isn't as fun any longer.  Used Cars uses the ""Keep it Simple, Stupid"" technique which created lifelong comedy and a possible cult film amongst salesmen.  I thought that the entire premise between Russell and Warden was nearly like watching a cartoon, i.e. the old Bugs Bunny vs. Yosemite Sam.  The commercials that Russell and Graham pull off are comic genius adding more to the story and the overall zaniness of the situation.  Again, this isn't rocket science comedy, this is simple.  It is easy to laugh at the words, the characters, and even the situation because it can be related to you.  You, as an audience member, can see the used car salesman, you can laugh at the technique, and you can even find yourself rooting for him closer to the end.  It is a story about being passionate about your job, even if it means you have the bottom of the barrel career.

Overall, I thought this film was hysterical.  I was ready to watch a dated film that felt like a time warp back to the 80s, but instead what I discovered was huge laughter and crazy characters that I wouldn't mind re-exploring again.  Russell was the perfect choice for the role, demonstrating to us that he can move past his ""Disney"" image and give us something more robust, more comical, and definitely more adult.  If you had to watch this film for one person, it would be Jack Warden.  His blend of comedy is superb.  He is the epitome of the evil car salesman, but does it with the finesse of comedy that his actions are immediately laugh-out-loud funny.  Zemeckis has created a gem that will take you back to the greatness of 80s comedy, but also will make you laugh at today's standards.  This is a truly funny film that will be enjoyed in this household for years to come!

715291,5,630368680X,"An uneven, but very funny film with some spectacular laughs.  ""Used Cars"" emerges as the best of the big budget, overblown comedies that had run rampet in the late 70's/early 80's (""1941"" stands as the ultimate budget-breaker of the time).

Kurt Russell is dead-on perfect as Rudy Russo, used car dealer and wannabbe local politician.  His effort to raise $60,000 to ""buy"" a seat on the city council seems in peril when his boss (Jack Warden) unexpectedly (but hilariously) dies of a heart attack. The boss's no-good evil twin brother (also Warden) plots to take over the car lot.  So Russell and his rag-tag bunch proceed to hide the body of the boss and made outrageous tv commercials in order to raise the money and save the lot.

The supporting characters range from underused (SCTV's Joe Flaherty as a lawyer) to drop-dead funny (Frank McRae as the oversized, single-minded Jim the Mechanic).  But Gerrit Graham shines as the nuerotic Jeff whose phobias (such as his avoidence of the color red) are very funny indeed.

The funniest parts of the film deal with the three tv commercials Russell and crew produce.  The first one takes place during a football game when Jeff discovers the car he's selling is red.  The second one uses strippers and a ""disco"" theme which must've seemed quite odd to those watching the film at theaters since disco itself had ""died"" a year earlier. Still, it's pretty funny stuff.

The third one, perhaps the most hilarious single scene ever filmed (well, that's a bit much, but still...), takes place during President Carter's address to the nation.  In it, Jeff proceeds to destroy the evil brother's cars as Marshall Lucky.  As testiment to how funny this scene is, I've seen no fewer that ten people actually drop to the floor and pound the carpet with their fist in histerics...and that includes my mother.

""Used Cars"" also has countless great lines, a wonderful turn by ""The Munsters"" Al Lewis as an honest, if tough judge, and the beautiful Deborah Harmon as the boss's daughter who unexpectedly shows up and throws a kink into Russell's plans.

The only problem with the film, and it's a fairly big one, is the final twenty minutes which dissolves into an uninspired car chase across the desert and a tacked on ""happy"" ending.  Still, ""Used Cars"" is really funny and for those of you over 18 (this is not for the kids), a really enjoyable experience.

Note: Look for a scene in which Kurt Russell gets out of bed to answer his phone (the first time, after the ""disco"" commercial).  He points ""Elvis-like"" to a cheap, two-foot statue of Elvis that he has on his headboard.  Kurt Russell played Elvis just two years before on network tv.",1096416000,9,2677,4.745140388768898

I have watched it who knows how many times, but I still get a kick out of certain scenes almost 25 years later.  But there is an added bonus now if you buy the DVD, an hilarious commentary track with director Bob Zemeckis and actor Kurt Russell along with Bob Gale, who co-wrote the screenplay with Zemeckis.
The movie features Russell as Rudy Russo, a used car salesman with absolutely no morals (OK, most used car salesman don't have morals, but Russo takes it to another level).  Jack Warden takes on dual roles as twin brothers trying to win the battle of used car lots at the same corner.  Garret Graham plays Russell's sidekick Jeff who tries to help Rudy move the cars through illegal television commercials, which are absolutely hilarious.  Other performances of note are those of Deborah Harmon, the daughter of one of the twins who wins Rudy's heart, Joe Flaherty from Second City as an unscrupulous lawyer and Michael McKean and David Lander (of Lenny and Squiggy fame) as techno wizards who assists Russell and Graham in their illegal activities.
All of the above are great, but the two who steal this movie are Frank McRae, who plays Jim the Mechanic and Toby the Beagle.  McRae may say less than 200 words in the whole movie, but he may have the highest laughter to words ratio in movie history.  Toby pulls off some funny stunts as well and is a memorable dog in movie history as well.
The movie is great and the DVD commentary of the three principal parties is hysterically funny.  I think the three must have stopped at the local brewpub before the taping and slammed a few because they are giddy, but they let you in on on some interesting facts about the movie.  There are also some outtakes as well as a real used car lot commercial that Russell shot in Arizona in Russo character.

715297,5,630368680X,"This film gave me an appreciation for the cars of the 1970s...  I was just a kid when I first saw Used Cars, and I'll never forget the first time I saw the film because I had never seen cars like these before!  For some reason, most of the '70s cars were long gone by the mid 1990s when I first saw this.
Although most of the cars in the film are junkers, they are still cool!  You will see an amazing lime green 1973 Lincoln Continental in one scene, and an awesome '74 Mercury Montego that jumps a ramp over a moving train and still runs with big chrome '70s bumper intact!  Then you we see a remarkable car chase that involves about 300 classic cars, ranging from old Lincolns and Chryslers, etc.
Beyond the cars, this is also an extremely funny movie!  I have seen Used Cars at least 10 times and every time it gets better!

This is a wild tribute to corruption, deceit, and dishonesty, in a field second only to politics in tarnished reputations! Kurt Russell is the crooked head salesman in a broken-down car lot, saving money to buy a seat in Congress ""where the really BIG kickback money is"". His boss, sweet-natured Luke Fuchs (Jack Warden), has a bad heart and a twin brother, truly nasty Roy Fuchs (also Warden, who is wonderful in the dual roles) running a competing used car lot across the highway. Evil Fuchs NEEDS his brother's dealership, as a state highway is about to be built over his lot, so he has an employee pose as a customer, and 'try out' one of Luke's cars with the old man in the car. After the test drive from Hell, Luke stumbles inside his trailer, and dies from a heart attack.
Russell realizes any hope to raise enough cash to run for office would be shattered with Fuch's death, so he and his fellow employees bury the old man and his car in the lot, and fibs that Fuchs had left town on vacation. Then Fuchs' daughter, Barbara (Deborah Harmon) arrives, and things get sticky!
The film becomes a live-action Warner Bros. cartoon, as 'good guy' Russell and 'bad guy' Warden try scheme after scheme to ruin the other...Warden offers a carnival in his lot, Russell offers strippers...Warden does TV commercials, Russell brings in two disreputable cable guys ('Lenny and Squiggy' Michael McKean and David L. Lander) to break into a Presidential address with an 'R'-rated ad that would leave the FCC in apoplexy! This insanity builds to an epic climax, as hundreds of junkyard cars, driven by Driver's Ed students, race to fill Russell's car lot, and prevent a court-ruled closing.
The cast is matchless; in addition to Russell, Warden, and Harmon, outrageous humor is provided by Gerrit Graham (who gleefully shotguns Warden's cars in another 'illegal' TV spot), and Frank McRae, as a mechanic you DON'T want to disagree with. And don't forget a certain dog, who outperforms nearly everyone in the cast!
This is the ONLY 'R'-rated film Zemeckis has ever directed (the BACK TO THE FUTURE trilogy and FORREST GUMP are among his later triumphs), yet USED CARS was a commercial failure when first released, despite rave reviews. AIRPLANE! came out at the same time, and, unfortunately, the public wasn't interested in watching TWO 'over-the-top' comedies.

Not only did I enjoy it the first 10 times I saw it, but now with the audio commentary by Zemeckis, Russell and Gale you will have your sides hurting from all your laughing.
While Kurt Russell is the star of the movie and he gives a memorable performance, it's Jack Warden in the duo role of competing auto car dealership owners who steals it.  I've never seen Warden give a bad performance, and in this movie you get two great performances.  However, he's not the only actor who gives an over-the-top performance:
Gerrit Graham as the suspicious co-conspirator/salesman is about as disrespectable a salesman as one would ever find, with a libido that would make one hesitant about introducing him to ones sister.

I saw it 20 years ago in the theater, and after probably 100 times now, it remains as hilarious as ever.  Yeah the language is bad, but used car salesmen are not exactly choir boys. SO many great scenes and so many great lines that it still amazes me when I watch it today. I won't go in to detail because I couldn't begin to do this movie justice. You'll just have to trust all of us, and see it for yourself. I lent mine to a friend and never got it back; a great excuse to pick up the DVD and watch the movie again.",1012608000,,611,3.872
715453,5,630368680X,"I was 21 years old when this movie played at the local drive-in. (Remember those?) My buddy and I arrived at the theater to see the OTHER movie that was showing with it. I asked my friend, ""What's this 'Used Cars' movie about?"" He didn't know and we assumed we would be bored sitting through 'Used Cars' just waiting for the main feature. Wow - we were so wrong! Used Cars literally had us laughing so hard we couldn't catch our breath.  My buddy and I had a job working on a lot, and this movie was kinda like seeing ourselves on the screen!
Every character in this movie is memorable. It's a feel-good movie, but that's not to say it's for everybody. There are many things about this movie that make it unsuitable for children, not the least of which is the bad language (when has Jack Warden ever been able to do a part without considerable profanity?). Kurt Russell really established himself as a grown-up actor with this flick (after having done many childhood Disney films).

The actors seem to really have fun with what they're doing, and Jack Warden does a great job of playing both of two extremely opposite brothers.  At the very least a FUN movie.  Not for everyone, especially those who don't appreciate bad taste, but one that everyone should see at least some of.  An underappreciated title that will hopefully get a wider audience on DVD than it did on tape.",1011052800,,579,4.528846153846154
715455,5,630368680X,"Just about every single clich about used car dealers is witnessed here -- and then some. There are so many absolutely hilarious moments, be prepared to have stomach pains from laughing uncontrollably. Kurt Russell is the protagonist, complete w/cheesy plaid sports jacket and short, wide tie. He works on a car lot owned by Luke Fuchs, whose nasty twin brother Roy has a rival lot across the street (both are played by Jack Warden). The story is really about the battle between these two lots, with the conniving Roy having to deal with slick Russell (who plays Rudy Russo), Gerrit Graham (Jeff), and Jim (Frank McRae).
Possibly the two single most unbelievably funny moments are when electronics geniuses Freddy and Eddie (David Lander and Michael McKean, better known as Lenny and Squiggy from ""Laverne and Shirley"" fame) first break into the programming of a local football game to broadcast a commercial for Russo and Co.'s lot. But even better is when they cut into a NATIONAL address by President Carter to do the same thing!! I almost could not recover from my laughing after these two incidents!
Also be sure to listen to Jim the Mechanic's one-liners, as well as watch how Russo and Co. fool the police into believing dead Luke Fuchs ""was merely on vacation in Florida."" Some of the funniest spots in movies I've ever seen.
I'd compare the humor in this to ""Animal House,"" but ""Used Cars"" is even funnier.",1008374400,4,1414,4.799180327868853

I bought it on video in BETA format about 20 years ago, when VHS and BETA were competing to be the dominant format.  Since then, I have seen some great comedies, but none has been as much fun as Used Cars.  My respect for Kurt Russell began with this movie and he has never disappointed me.  When my boss is talking to me about some trivial work thing he thinks is important, but I couldn't care less about, it feels so good to remember some of the scenes in this movie and carry a smile in myself again.",980553600,,653,4.078125
715528,4,630368680X,"""Used Cars"" is so raucous and vulgar--at times resembling a Three Stooges movie as rewritten by Martin Lawrence--that some people will be turned off at once, not seeing either the brilliance of the satire or the hilariousness of the physical jokes. The movie exists in a world so corrupt that the only real fight is between evil con men and good-hearted con men; there is only one moral person in the entire movie, and she has to learn to lie or else become a lamb to the slaughter. Jack Warden plays Roy L. Fuchs, an evil used-car dealer who has brought about the death of his brother (also played by Warden) to gain control of his car lot; Kurt Russell plays Rudy Russo, the dead brother's chief salesman, who must hide the brother's body to keep Roy from seizing the lot. Complicating matters is Deborah Harmon as Barbara, the dead brother's daughter, who--knowing nothing of her father's death--believes the car lot can be run on the principles of fair dealing and trusting one's neighbors. As the original ad campaign said, ""She's Got a Lot to Learn."" Among the people who teach her this lesson are Gerrit Graham as Russell's partner in sleaze; Michael McKean and David L. Lander (aka Lenny and Squiggy) as electronics whizzes who help Russell and Graham jam TV broadcasts with illegal commercials; Joe Flaherty of SCTV as a corrupt district attorney on Warden's payroll; and Al ""Grandpa Munster"" Lewis as a judge so sadistic that he keeps a toy guillotine on his bench. Of course, Russell and Harmon fall in love, and it's a case of Boy Meets Girl, Boy Loses Girl, Boy and Girl Scam Little Old Ladies. Obviously, this movie won't attract people who can't stand a little cynicism about human nature, and it's as garish as Russell's polyester plaid coat. But most of the gags (particularly the long final sequence, a hilarious sendup of Western epics) are very funny, and Russell gives one of the great comic performances of the 1980s. Allow me to repeat this: KURT RUSSELL, IN ""USED CARS,"" GIVES ONE OF THE GREAT COMIC PERFORMANCES OF THE 1980s. This movie serves as a vital corrective to those who think there is nothing in Russell's career between ""The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes"" and ""Tango and Cash.""",976492800,8,2209,4.740259740259741
715529,5,630368680X,This was a hoot of a movie. Humor at it's very best. Kurt Russell has never been better. Jack Warden was outstanding playing two brother who are in the car business competing with each other. One of the brothers dies and a fake wreck is staged by Russell. In the mean time every kind of sales trick that you can think of is tried by the competing car dealers. Kurt Russell even manages to cut into a prime time football game with a television ad. The results are hilarious. This movie takes car salesmen to a new level. The actors are good and the plot is good. Buy this movie. You will not be dissapointed.,972345600,,607,4.28695652173913

The other actors, especially Jack Warden, turn in maybe the best performances of their careers.  But what really separates this movie from the pack is the quality of the writing--way, way better than what you see in even above-average comedies.  The jokes are set up with care and precision, and the punch lines always score a perfect ""10"".  The sub-plots all get tied together.  The characters are well drawn.  There's a perfect mix of physical and verbal humor, of wit and profanity.  Certain scenes, like the patched-in commercials, should have you laughing for days.  And even though the movie goes back to the Carter administration...it's fresh.  All this is testimony to a great script, perfectly executed with first class acting and direction.  Warning:  it drags a little at the end, but you won't mind, because you'll be laughing so hard at that point you won't really be paying attention.

715531,5,630368680X,"""Used Cars"" may not have won Robert Zemeckis any oscars, but it  did win him a job directing ""Romancing the Stone"" since Michael  Douglas was apparently a HUGE fan of this film and it's easy to see why.  The movie is not only funny, but extremely well made. Steve Martin once  said Comedy is not Pretty, but Used Cars is an exception. The direction,  photography, editing are seamless. Still holds up after 20 years (Where's  the DVD???) and an early obvious sign of Zemeckis' vast talent.",965606400,2,489,4.627906976744186
715532,4,630368680X,"Watching Used Cars is like watching a crazed loon trying to stuff a sqaure peg in a round hole...and suceeding. It is a tastless, vulgar, inane,  unredeemable and nasty piece of heartless, cruel and unrenlentingly  cyinical humour. That ofcourse is why I liked it.
  Nowadays we have the  Farrelly brothers brand of crude humour, but their films are about  basically good people getting themselves in disgusting situations (usually  involving bodily fluids). Preceeding them by over a decade was Robert  Zemeckis, who in Used Cars set out to make a comedy without a single  sympathetic character. The only reason why we root for the protagonist is  because he is more audaciously crooked then everyone else. Infact, the  whole film looks in need of an oil change and a good paint job. The  direction is clunky, the clothes atrocious and the atmosphere smoggy. But  this only adds to the picture's lowlife charm.
  As Rudy Russo, Kurt  Russel is the most blatantly dis-honest salesman this side of a Glengarry  Glen Ross character. His sole ambition in life is to graduate to public  service, to become a Senator. For that he needs 60,000 dollars to ""buy  the election"" and he's about 10,000 short. Logic is cheerfully left  behind, as Russo and his cronies hide their boss's death(Jack Warden) to  prevent his spiteful more successful brother across the street from  inheriting the lot(also played by Jack Warden). Now desperate for the  money, they employ the most grotesque, deceptive, tastless and frequently  illegal marketing techniques in existance. Weather stealing the live feed  of a football game or the inturrupting the a presidnetial speech(a scene  which had me in a fit of laughter) to air their R-rated ads, their cons are  so insane they left me in disbelief. The film is so grounded is small town  realism that the contrast with these impossible schemes has an almost  surreal effect.
  Robert Zemeckis would go on to make more commercial  films later. Some were wonderful, others not quite so succesful, but in all  his later films(even the dark comedy Death Becomes Her) there is this  annoying wholsomeness. Used Cars was his sophmore effort, and its so  cheerfully unwholesome it cries out for our shocked attention, it is  impposible to resist. It is a slight letdown that after the an hour the  film abandons its inspired schemes to persue a silly plot thread involving  250 cars driven  by highschool kids through the desert. But the sequence is  so beserk, so out there that is becomes impressive, even admirable.",965433600,2,2538,4.978468899521531
