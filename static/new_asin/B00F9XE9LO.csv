5972638,4,B00F9XE9LO,"after months of waiting for its release here in the Philippines, the MDNA tour dvd and cd collection finally arrives (after the Zamboanga siege, the Bohol earthquake and the Yolanda devastation).  the product is locally manufactured and distributed by MCA music, and no longer by Warner Bros Philippines (since her contract expired in 2009) and this was something new for me, having known Madonna to be with the WB label since 1982.

and now for the tour: the MDNA tour is nth concert of the one and only queen of pop!  i noticed that her concerts get more artistic every time, and the visuals more stunning!!!  once the concert starts, there is no stopping the queen.  the songs are properly sequenced (depending on the motif of the segment) and some were as is (her MDNA songs) while some were given new arrangements (notably the classics).  the choreography as usual is superb.  a bonus to consider would be the participation of her own son Rocco during two numbers.

the sound is much better (than the previous release, according to some fans who purchased the first batch) and madonna's voice is given more space and does not drown in the instruments/background music.

the show opens with ""girl gone wild"" immediately after a short introduction (virgin mary).  the next songs showcased some violence and a gun-toting madonna. i only wished that she sang the whole ""papa don't preach"" and not just the first stanza.  it remains to be one of her enduring classics.  the video interludes are also great, reworking some of her neo-classics justify my love, nobody knows me and best friend.  her rendition of ""open your heart"" ""like a virgin"" ""love spent"" were different but good and has dramatic effect.  the black and white pictures within the concert were also good.

however, i also noticed that for a long time, she hasn't sang ""holiday"" (one of my favorite madonna songs).  but closing the show with ""celebration"" is also a good choice since i really like that song the minute i heard it (specially the benassi remix).  overall the MDNA tour delivers the madonna trademark of pop perfection!

in case you thought i misspelled my title, nope. madonna actually asked the fans, ""have you taken your mdma?"" which i think referred to some kind of drug (?) i really don't know.",1386028800,5,2278,4.812339331619537
