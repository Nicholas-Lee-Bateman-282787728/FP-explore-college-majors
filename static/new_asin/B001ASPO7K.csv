3467084,5,B001ASPO7K,"I saw this movie on the Internet, and I decided to buy a region free DVD player so that I could add it to my collection. Maybe, I have too much time on my hands, but, if an actor sparks my interest, I will start watching all of their movies. Usually, that amounts to a few movies before I get tired of seeing the same old expressions over and over again. With Tom Hardy, the more I see the more I want to see. He's very refreshing and seems so different in each role. (Okay, some of them have similarities, but the differences are enough to keep his acting interesting to me.)

This role is probably my favorite of his so far, but I haven't made my way through everything yet. :) I did recommend the show to a friend, and she didn't like because she said it moved too slow. I find that it is at times funny, at times harsh, and even at times unexpected. I have thought about reading the book, but I haven't done that yet.",1317340800,22,921,4.116666666666666
3467085,2,B001ASPO7K,"I bought the book, then saw the film first - I thought that the film was superficial and at times a bit ""too cosy.""  I had bought the book, so I then read the book. The book is much much more interesting than the film, and tells much more about Stuart's life - in and out of prison - and quotes Stuart quite a bit about his own life. It also tells about homeless people in more detail than the film does. The author writes intelligently and with humor - the actor in the film seems 2 dimensional in comparison. Glad I saw the film on TV. A thin cup of tea compared to the book.",1252540800,,577,3.9741379310344827
3467086,5,B001ASPO7K,"I, too, am astounded that this film is discontinued. Luckily, I was able to purchase a copy from a secondary seller.
First, Tom Hardy, whose performance earned him an award nomination, is astounding as Stuart. Other performances are equally excellent.
The story line is told backwards, as Stuart requested, and the film ends with a poignant resolution to Stuart's heartbreaking situation.
There is depicted here not just a young man's lifelong fight  against abuse of every kind but his resiliance, intelligence and wit. His biographer chronicles Stuart's life with affection for his subject and a progressive understanding of what makes Stuart tick.
I hope others will pursue this film to see an unusual and unforgettable story. I bought a player that plays both region 2 and well as region 1 discs, so perhaps you can order the film from an British source.
It is well worth the search.",1248048000,3,887,4.993243243243243
3467087,5,B001ASPO7K,"I had the good fortune to see this film on satelite dish recently.i actually watched it twice.it is one of the most impressive films i have seen and although it is a mixture of humour and tragedy,it  left me with an immense feeling of sadness.it managed to bring home so effectively the reality of how many broken adults are the result of child abuse.
and yet,this film,i see to my astonishment has been discontued!
and that,is quite a tragedy,as it denies the public the opportunity to own one of the best pieces of film making and acting on the subject.",1247961600,7,555,4.55
3467088,5,B001ASPO7K,"This is an extraordinary film on all fronts. It is funny, moving and disturbing. The performances of both leading actors are exemplary but Tom Hardy's performance is brilliant beyond words.",1238889600,12,189,5.333333333333333
3467089,5,B001ASPO7K,Brilliant performance by Tom Hardy!  Benedict Cumberbatch is perfect in the role of Stuart's biographer. Excellent movie. A must-watch for Hardy fans or anyone just looking for a touching and funny movie.,1490227200,,204,5.375

3467092,5,B001ASPO7K,"Just watched this movie and am now on Amazon to book the book in my wish list. It is a shame that quiet, thoughtful movies such as this are not in the spotlight more because this was a great movie. Tom Hardy did an amazing job as Stuart and although I have never seen Cumberbatch in anything before, I really did enjoy him in this role. I encourage anyone who enjoys movies with quirky characters to watch this. It really tugs at the heart strings without being sappy.",1484179200,,468,4.329545454545454

3467094,5,B001ASPO7K,"Tom Hardy portrayal of Stuart Shorter a MUST-SEE, genuinely vulnerable, self-deprecating. This is Region 2 (UK) distibution, worth investing in multi-region blu ray player to view in Region 1 (North America).",1466467200,2,208,5.741935483870968

3467100,5,B001ASPO7K,"The movie differs in the book only in that it is a distillation of the details. One of my favourite of Hardy's roles, Shorter is an extremely endearing character despite everything he does.",1423612800,,189,4.757575757575758
3467101,1,B001ASPO7K,Beware: probably my fault for not looking closer but this DVD WILL NOT PLAY in USA unless you have special equipment.  I would have returned it except that I'd have to pay postage...the low cost to start wasn't worth the bother.,1417305600,,228,4.560975609756097
3467102,5,B001ASPO7K,Heartbreaking but nonetheless one of the best movies I have seen in many years.  Tom Hardy is unbelievable. One of his most poignent perfermances.  I can watch it over and over.  Wish Stuart could have seen it.,1414540800,,210,4.621621621621622

3467105,5,B001ASPO7K,"I saw part of this movie online and had to buy the dvd. Then I loved the story of the movie so much I bought the book. Stuart had a terrible life, and he had a different outlook. Somehow you can still relate to him and love him. At least I did anyway. There aren't many words to explain the movie actually, you'd just have to watch it to understand. I love it, Tom Hardy's acting was amazing as always. And Benedict's as well. They're great together. Stuart will make you laugh, and his story makes you cry. It's just, an incredible story.",1403136000,,539,4.242718446601942
3467106,5,B001ASPO7K,good story.  Cumberbatch plays this straight and is a wonderful actor.  Tom Hardy becomes the character and breaks your heart.  I can  watch any Region since I have a code free DVD player.,1398729600,,188,4.606060606060606
3467107,5,B001ASPO7K,"I have watched this movie numerous times. I keep the DVD in my computer so I can have the dialogue playing in the background as I do stuff, then click the icon so I can view certain favorite parts (of which there are many). The relationship between Hardy and Cumberbatch as Alexander and Stuart just hit the absolutely right note. The book is brilliant, so is the movie. Alexander Masters wrote both, and these actors bring the story to life. And there are extras in the form of interviews with the relevant people and there's also a ""behind the scenes"" featurette.",1398384000,,565,4.603960396039604
3467108,4,B001ASPO7K,"I had to see this movie--did some research and found that VLC Media Player will play Region 2 DVDs on the computer, then attached the cable and watched it on the TV! Very good movie, very good performances, was interested to see it because of Benedict Cumberbatch (Trying to see everything he's been in since seeing him in Sherlock). Tom Hardy was excellent as Stuart Shorter. A thought provoking, disturbing film, stayed with me a while.",1396915200,,438,4.776315789473684
3467109,5,B001ASPO7K,"My daughter and I love this movie. It is very thought provoking and makes you look at life a bit differently. Not for children, but great for teens and adults.",1388534400,,159,4.333333333333333
3467110,5,B001ASPO7K,"I saw this entire film on youtube but it's horrible to watch it 15 minutes at a time so I want the dvd. It needs to be released region 1, both of these actors have huge followings here in the States and this film....this film is amazing. You WILL cry, there's simply no way round that however it's just so damned good! Tom Hardy is amazing and Benedict Cumberbatch...well what can I say about this man that has not already been said? His talent is unmeasurable, he is probably the best actor out there right now and for the foreseeable future and everything you can see him in will just prove that point. I cannot say enough that everyone needs to see this film!",1383004800,,662,4.346774193548387
3467111,5,B001ASPO7K,"This was a great movie. I enjoyed the movie so much that I also purchased the book (kindle) version. Tom Hardy did an awesome job in portraying the real life of Stuart Shorter. Mr. Hardy is an exceptional actor who has done remarkable portrayals in all of his movies. He is like a chameleon in that he seems to effortlessly morph or transform himself into the character that he is portraying and somehow make it absolutely 100% believable. In this movie Mr. Hardy did an an excellent job of showing the life, struggles, hardships, and thoughts of Stuart Shorter. It is rare that I like movies based on books (that I have read). However, I think that Hardy, Cumberbatch, and a script that was a great adaptation of the book is what made this such a great movie.

My only disappointment has nothing to do with the movie. Unfortunately, this movie is currently only released in region 2 format, which means that a multi-regional DVD player is needed for viewers in in U.S.",1380412800,4,969,4.601156069364162
3467112,5,B001ASPO7K,"I bought this movie because I'm in love with Benedict Cumberbatch. That being said, it was Tom Hardy who stole the show. This is a movie about the friendship between Alexander (Cumberbatch), who works at a homeless organization and is an aspiring writer and Stuart (Hardy) who is a very troubled homeless man. While it doesn't sound like much,(maybe it does to someone) it was so moving and powerful to watch. Hardy does such a wonderful job of bringing humanity to his character and you can't help but fall in love with this poor soul and wish that his life had been so very different. Cumberbatch, while also very good in his role, really took a back seat in this one. The friendship that these two share is truly touching. I highly recommend this film but wish that it was released in Region 1.",1365552000,4,797,4.541666666666667
3467113,5,B001ASPO7K,"When I watched this heartbreaking movie (online) I felt like I was watching Stuart Shorter.....not Tom Hardy playing the role of Stuart Shorter. His acting abilities are just amazing to say the least. Please, Amazon, make this available for us to be able to purchase and watch in the U.S.",1359504000,4,288,4.78
3467114,5,B001ASPO7K,Why isn't this movie sold in the U.S.? It sucks when your DVD/Blu-ray player isn't region compatible! Makes me sad.,1358899200,5,115,4.8
3467115,5,B001ASPO7K,"Such a wonderful film with brilliant performances by Benedict Cumberbatch and especially Tom Hardy! I highly recommend this one........make sure and keep the tissues handy!

PLEASE AMAZON......FIND A WAY TO MAKE THIS DVD AVAILABLE FOR REGION 1 USA PLAYERS...........I'D LOVE TO HAVE IT IN MY COLLECTION!!",1344902400,40,304,5.608695652173913
3467116,5,B001ASPO7K,"I have been a fan of Tom Hardy for awhile, and like most nerds, when I am a fan of someone I watch all of their movies. Well, I have seen almost all of Mr. Tom Hardy's movies and I have to say this is THE BEST! At first when I watched it, I wasn't quite sure how I felt about it. It does have a bit of a slow start, but by the time it starts to pick up, you're already hooked! It's different in a truly wonderful way. Mr. Tom Hardy portrays Stuart Shorter, a homeless addict with muscular dystrophy. Benedict Cumberbatch plays Alexander Masters, a young aspiring writer. The movie follows how these two unlikely people develop a very unique friendship when they are united through a campaign. After awhile, Alexander discovers he wants to write a book about his new friend's life. To make it more interesting, Stuart tells him to write it backwards. As you can tell through the first introduction of the movie, Stuart has had a hard life. I won't spoil anything for you, but I can honestly tell you what you dicover about Stuart is heartwrenching. So much so, that you are able to excuse some of his horrific actions and wonder how he is even alive. The way Tom Hardy plays Stuart is so warm, honest and moving, not only did I constantly have goosebumps, but it also moved me to tears. (I won't go into too much detail, but one specific scene comes to mind where he's huddled in his apartment, wielding a knife and shaking in absolute terror. It sounds like a horrible scene, and it is, but because of it you begin to understand Stuart and his inner demons.) Tom Hardy portrays that part with such brilliance that all I wanted to do was go looking for Stuart and just give him a big hug. Really wish this movie had been put on the mainstream, cause Mr. Hardy would have DEFINITELY won an award for this. The fact that he didn't is a true injustice. And Benedict Cumberbatch playing opposite him is truly a wonderful cast. The warmth between the two of them and true bonds of friendship is up on there on the screen for you to see. The quiet way Benedict can kind of digest what Stuart tells him, the way he can act truly horrified with just a look, but spare Stuart an added pain by saying anything, is wonderful. At first you think Alexander is writing this book to make a name for himself. After awhile you realize that he truly cares for this person and wants to be there for him as a friend. It's no longer about fame, money or notoriety, but about telling the story of his friend and sharing the kind person he was with the world. This movie is sad at times, but it's also funny, enlightening, and moving. A REALLY, REALLY GREAT MOVIE! The idea to write it and film the story backwards is utter brilliance. It keeps you hooked while slowly giving you small pieces of the story until the puzzle is finished. Can't say enough about this movie. Feel like I'm on a movie high. Just buy this movie already!",1344556800,4,2906,4.34375
3467117,4,B001ASPO7K,"I was so upset to find out that this DVD would not play on my player because it is from the US. (Which is why I didn't buy it!) Thankfully, I was able to watch this movie on the internet tonight. It was a very heartbreaking story, told very well by the incredible acting of Benedict Cumberbatch and Tom Hardy. It's a movie that makes you realize that everyone out there has something important to say. I commend Alexander for what he did, and am now interested in reading the book. Also, after seeing this movie, Tom Hardy has DEFINITELY become my favorite actor of all time. However, I will be watching it again soon because there were some things he said that I could not understand. Hopefully one day soon this DVD will be available to us in the US because it's a keeper.",1339459200,4,774,4.344827586206897

8279566,5,B001ASPO7K,"A wonderful movie.  Great early performances from two of our finest actors currently in the business.  It was a delight to see the early acting chops of both Hardy and Cumberbatch. Hardy's physical performance was unbelievable.  While Stuart's life was more and more heart-breaking as it unfolded, it was a fascinating look into how homelessness happens and all the many facets that society is not addressing to prevent it from happening.  For all of his psychological problems, Stuart was a very endearing character, if one looked past the surface, as Alexander did.  He was intelligent, funny, philosophical, with finely-honed street smarts.  I highly recommend this movie.",1520985600,,675,5.320754716981132
8279567,5,B001ASPO7K,"Watched it first on HBO on demand. Could not BELIEVE what an incredible actor Tom Hardy showcased for us here. This is as good if not better than Hoffman's RAINMAN, DiCaprio's GILBERT GRAPE, even Day-Lewis' LEFT FOOT. Just amazing performance made me buy a multi-region dvd player (from Amazon) and the book (on Amazon) and the official dvd from Amazon.uk. Impressed me that much! Bless Stuart Shorter, poor soul.",1518480000,,413,5.0

I saw a lot of his movies and I admire his acting skills.  He is a very talented actor.  Please Amazon acquire the DVD of this movie that can play in USA's DVD player.
