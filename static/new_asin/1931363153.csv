8585744,5,1931363153,"This tape covers weapons, mass attacks and groundfighting using just one weapon - the bite. This tape is a progression from Street Safe II that dealt with empty hand combat and some basic weapons combat.

The good:

The drills for weapons training are excellent for developing attributes.

Paul doesn't sugar-coat his opinion on multiple attackers. Simple concepts to adhere to when faced with 2 versus 3 or more attackers.

I've been waiting to see Paul's take on groundfighting for a while and he comes up with an excellent way to get a 250lb attacker off you.

The bad:

Far be it for me to criticize a master like Paul, but there are other techniques to use in ground fighting (without resorting to learning BJJ for a number of years) that don't involve biting, like finger locks, hair-pulling, ear-pulling, etc.

Conclusion:

An excellent video to have. Very brutal and very direct.",1100044800,5,887,4.866666666666666
