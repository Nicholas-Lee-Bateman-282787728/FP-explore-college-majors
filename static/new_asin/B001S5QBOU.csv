8415078,5,B001S5QBOU,I used Deborah's CD to help me minimize my accent.  I live in the South and realize I can't eliminate my accent completely.......wouldn't want to do that anyway.  This CD helped me understand that I can make some small changes and sound more professional when I speak for my job.,1354665600,4,279,4.56
8415079,5,B001S5QBOU,"This book was very easy to understand and should be helpful to anyone, especially in the business world.  I was very pleased with my purchase!",1339632000,,142,4.68
8415080,1,B001S5QBOU,"This is just totally ridiculously. Why would you want to kill your southern accent, or any other accent for that matter. Is there a book, ""Tame Your Wild Northern Accent""? Probably not. This book sterotypes Southerners based on their accent. Keep your accent. Life is too short to worry about such foolishness.",1304899200,,310,4.980769230769231
