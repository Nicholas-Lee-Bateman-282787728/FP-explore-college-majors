7923206,5,B00004TX0P,"YOUSSEF CHAHINE directs and stars in this MAGNIFICIENT final entry in his semi-autobiographical ""ALEXANDRIA"" TRILOGY!  Because of a CONFLICT with his leading man (the actor does NOT want to play Hamlet!), YEHIA, who is now a film-maker, has to REEVALUATE his life, his work and his own sexual impulses!  This is a sophisticated movie, but it also includes some wonderful MUSICAL segments as well as gorgeous CINEMATOGRAPHY and solid performances by not only Chanine by Yousra as Nadia and Hussein Fahmy as Stelio!  ""Iskanderija, kaman oue kaman"" was made in Egypt in 1990!  Dollars to donuts you have never SEEN and Egyptian film!  Well, you will enjoy this one by Egypt's master director!  Even better, start with the FIRST film in the trilogy, ""Alexndria...Why?""!",1003104000,3,765,5.129032258064516
7923207,5,B00004TX0P,"YES , i know already it is so difficult to understand this movie , you have to watch it at least 2 or 3 times in order just to try to follow the so much complicated story line , actually the movie itself sounds to me as some sort of "" absurd - poetry"",chahine is trying to go deep into his ego , to trace the reasons of why he did so and so .. ? ! huh does it sound non sense ? ok watch that song in the movie where he was talking about his favourite actor as A GOD , and trying to force him into the people mind saying "" take my eyes , and look at him you will find him beautiful if u see him with your heart's eyes"" THE only problem with this movie is that Non-Arabic viewres might not feel it , just because chahine's screen play arabic is so difficult to be translated , to be honest with u sometimes it is even difficult for arabic viewers to follow his new language :P well , still this movie is a good meal for your eyes if you r hungry for a beautiful cinematic picture < best visuals ever seen in arabian cinema > love ya chahine , thank u",991267200,,1048,3.811926605504587
7923208,1,B00004TX0P,"I admit that I have not seen the complete triology of the celibated Egyptian director Youssef Chahine semi-autobiographical journey through his experiences of Egyptian cinema. But if they are anything like this one. Then they are best avoided. The word pretentious can not do justice to the staggering amount of nonesensical psuedo-profoundity that Chahine actors are forced to sprout. At one point my husband and I were compelled to check the cover because the actors broke out into a Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly routine whilst battling to come to terms with the fact that their film had lost at the Canne's film festival. The film has no actual plot to speak of. Instead it switches with clumsy rapidity from present day where Chahine's alto-ego struggles to keep a self-destructive actor on his pay roll who wants to escape soap operas. To past experiences on Chahin's set where the camermen are on strike during a production of ""Cleopatra."" Or is it the otherway round. Who can tell through the quagmire of empty philosophical soliques and experimental camera angles.
The lighting is poor the sound quality is poor, the acting totally OTT and irritating. Far better to see Youssef Chahine's swashbuckling triple Canne's winner ""Destiny"" also avilable at Amazon.com than spend your money on this egotistical gibberish",979776000,,1321,5.12037037037037
