8294139,5,B000OMD4U2,"I loved loved loved this WrestleMania, In this Ultimate edition version they gave all the matches the movie style effect so it looks like it came from hollywood. This was my first WrestleMania I ever seen, This is perfect for all wrestling fans!! I was in awe and amazed at how good they made it all look. Also for WWE fans this is the LAST of the WM that was under TV-14 before it switched over to TV-PG so it still has the old style charm to it. I would recomend buying this version!! It comes with the extras like the behind the scenes and promos of past MNR, SD! and ECW shows. This is a must for any wrestling fan to buy!",1406246400,3,626,4.097560975609756
