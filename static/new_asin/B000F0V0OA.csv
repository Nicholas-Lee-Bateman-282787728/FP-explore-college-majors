Reminds you of a great old Howard Hawks comedy.

Would love to see a sequel ;-)",1148083200,5,114,4.136363636363637
8116138,5,B000F0V0OA,"If you are into romantic comedies, this is the film you have been looking for.

If this film is anything to go by, watch out Ron Howard, there is another Howard on the block. Great acting, directing and story combine to make this film one of the best of its genre.

Why did it take so long to reach DVD? We have been denied a classic.

This should have been in the top 10 of the 21st century.",1148083200,,392,4.0
