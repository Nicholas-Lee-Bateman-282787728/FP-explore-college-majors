5540525,5,B00B0MZEBM,"I've never written a review before. I am an aspiring singer/songwriter living in New York City and I watch a lot of movies, especially independent films. This one really was one of the best I've seen lately. It was literal, and at the same time symbolic. What I really liked was the contrast between sadness and unhappiness mixed with happiness. Quiet and independent, yet relatable. Bravo.",1359504000,4,390,4.924242424242424
5540526,5,B00B0MZEBM,"I AM  NOT A HIPSTER's opening sequence takes place at the Casbah (San Diego Music Venue). We are on stage, a microphone in our face, with the struggling musician/protagonist of the film named Brook (Dominic Bogart). The audience is waiting for a performance.  There are couple of shout-outs to Tim Mays, the club's real life owner, before Brook excuses himself from the stage, in the middle of a set, to throw up. But before he vomits into the real life toilet of one of San Diego's most respected music venues, he performs a really good song (created by Joel P West) that sets the tone for the rest of the film.

First things first-  hipster, hipster, hipster. I, personally, have never thought of the term ""hipster"" as negative. I would probably like to be described as a hipster, but I fear I seldom am. The lead character, however, is a hipster in the grand sense of the clich - an artist who listens to records, plays guitar, rides a bike, smokes hand rolled cigarettes, and is (recently) vegan. But the audience gets to experience his humanity perhaps in spite of his hipsterhood. He's a guy you might want to hate -- selfish and self-centered, but none-the-less human, and he's facing the all too human issues of the death of his mother and the fact that his ex-girlfriend is dating someone new, someone he sees as a rival and a polar opposite of everything he stands for. Brook is also fitting of the tortured artist, acting out, and then his three angelic sisters (played by Tammy Minoff, Lauren Coleman and Kandis Erickson) come to visit, bringing his estranged father and his deceased mother's ashes. The hipster movie turns out to be something quite different, something touching and sentimental.

Another poignant theme of the film is the ""call of the artist"". Brook sees himself as the true artist, the tormented soul, making meaningful music inspired by pain and loss. His best friend, Clark (played by Alvaro Orlando), is also an artist. He's a visual artist who makes work that is silly and fun but seen as inauthentic by Brook.

""Don't call it art,"" Brook tells Clark after seeing his work. ""Call it something else -- call it fluffy shit.""

I love this scene. I love this sequence. Probably because I agree with Brook, and yet I do admit to enjoy ""fluffy shit"" in the name of ""art"". It's a conflict at the heart of the creative world, and by bravely pointing to this dilemma, the film self-reflexively calls upon its audience to think about the art they are currently watching.

Overall, I really enjoyed this film. The acting is very good, and I especially enjoyed the comic relief of actor Alvaro Orlando as Clark. It's also just really fun to watch one's hometown represented in film. San Diegans will recognize much of the film's backdrop. The SD Velodrome, South Park, and The Casbah are all prominently featured. Local musician Joel P. West created the songs that were performed exceptionally well by Dominic Bogart (as Brook). The film also has a soundtrack featuring tons local bands.

Destin Cretton, the writer/director of the film is a legend in certain San Diego film circles because while a graduate student at San Diego State University's Television, Film and New Media program, out of left field, he won the Sundance Jury Prize for a short film (2009). I am Not a Hipster, his first full-length feature film, also went to Sundance (2012).

8560356,5,B00B0MZEBM,"After having seen the brilliantly shot and best movie of 2013, SHORT TERM 12, I was informed that the director of that movie, Destin Daniel Cretton, had previously written and directed another feature-length picture entitled I AM NOT A HIPSTER. Although SHORT TERM 12 is a superior film, I AM NOT A HIPSTER is similar in tone and style and deals with a few similar issues.

I AM NOT A HIPSTER revolves around Brook Hyde (Dominic Bogart), a twenty-something indie musician struggling to earn a living from his art, but without selling out. Brook likes to listen to vinyl records, mostly travels via his bicycle, and is a vegan. Although Brook considers himself a true artist and rebels against being labeled anything but, he is the epitome of a hipster. This conflict is really the core of what I AM NOT A HIPSTER is about: the struggle with oneself over a seeming personal hypocrisy.

Like many artists, Brooks has issues. His previous long-term girlfriend is dating someone new and Brook still isn't over her. Her new boyfriend is a popular (and very successful) artist whose values are the antithesis of everything Brook believes in and stands for. In addition, there is an even more pressing struggle in Brooks life and that is dealing with the loss of his mother. Brooks has purposely ostracized himself from the rest of his family (his three sisters and their father), but it becomes evident that he clearly misses the relationship he had with them. In some ways, it is the story of the prodigal son who wants to return home, but is afraid to do so and really doesnt know how.

I AM NOT A HIPSTER is filled with wonderful acting performances and has a moving character exploration. Also, from what Ive been told it also really highlights some semi-famous local San Diego, CA settings. However, with that said, I AM NOT A HIPSTER is not a film that many moviegoers will enjoy. The film moves at a very slow pace and is full of slight nuances that moviegoers raised on special-effects-laden and CGI-created motion pictures probably will find dull and boring.

Overall, I AM NOT A HIPSTER is a fine piece of cinema. It moves at a slower pace that some might find uneventful, but is filled with highly-nuanced acting performances and common themes that even the most non-artistic can relate.",1407715200,2,2292,4.751256281407035

8560359,5,B00B0MZEBM,"I saw this film at The Roxie in San Francisco. Lovely film. A lesser filmmaker would have made a total pretentious piece of crap, but not Dustin Daniel Cretton. A nice slice of life film.",1400371200,2,187,4.371428571428571
8560360,5,B00B0MZEBM,"I bought TWO copies of this film.  It's a great film and just as importantly, the independent Seller here on Amazon is the original creator/distributor of the film.  Most of the time an indie film is passed around until some capitalist gets his/her hands on it and then sells it for an inflated price - never passing a penny back to the filmmakers.  Not in this case!  In this case, the money you spend here, on this film, will go back to the people who made the film.  Another great reason to buy tihs great indie film!!",1375660800,3,521,4.329896907216495
8560361,1,B00B0MZEBM,"[shudder].  It doesn't take long to realize that this is a contrived piece of crap.  The main character is a repulsive burned-out hipster hamming his way through one non-believable, trite hipster-type scene after another.  My girlfriend and I were nauseated by the ridiculous, feigned ""too cool"" facial expressions and postures.  The music is mediocre at best and generally grates on the ears.  This film completely lacks the spontaneous authenticity or honest beauty of ""Once"" -- any favorable comparisons you might read to the latter are nonsense.  Don't watch ""I Am Not a Hipster,"" and if you do, turn it off quickly and immediately perform some act of purification of your soul.",1374710400,3,682,5.099099099099099
8560362,5,B00B0MZEBM,"Brook is a singer/song writer in San Diego who moved away from his family in Ohio after a death. His moody and self destructive behavior has led him to a lonely life. This is his story back to happiness. Dominic Bogart is great in the role as Brook. The performances were real and quirky and sometimes funny. Brook's friend Clark (Alvaro Orlando) provides much of the comic relief and is one of Brooks only true friends. Good music, good story, good movie. See it, buy it, rent it now!",1371254400,2,485,4.46067415730337
