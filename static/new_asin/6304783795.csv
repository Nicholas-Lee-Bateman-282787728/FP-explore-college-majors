936827,5,6304783795,"This video has a much more emotional touch to it than most of the series. If you're a Ryoko fan, be prepared to grab some tissues, cause our favorite demoness is at her best here. I know I cried. The music fits the scenes well, and should leave you at a loss for words when you're done. Ayeka fans....well, you don't see too much of Ayeka, but she does do something that shouldn't suprise you at the end. Oh, and Ryoko fans..........you will be VERY happy to see the end of this video.",979689600,2,485,4.225806451612903
936828,5,6304783795,"Tenchi Universe Volume 8 includes Chapters 23 through 26, the last four in  the Tenchi Universe television series.  These episodes cover events from  Kagato's kidnapping of the Princess Ayeka through the climactic battle for  the throne of Jurai.  As with any good long-running series, the ending sets  itself up well for additional sequels.
The animation is superb, and fans  of the Tenchi saga will be surprised and delighted with the emotional  impact of the final episodes.  There is plenty of action and suspense,  although the romantic entanglements and the comedy are played down at this  point in the series.  All of the key characters are featured.  Ryoko fans  in particularly are in for an emotional rollercoaster ride.
No fan of the  Tenchi Muyo! series should be without this video.  These four episodes are  everything a Tenchi fan could ask for.  Highly recommended.",969062400,9,881,5.084507042253521
936829,5,6304783795,"This was a GREAT episode of Tenchi Muyo! It was a climactic ending with lots of action and romance and fun! his series is PERFECT for an anime fan. If you are one,get it,if you aren't get it for an animeloving friend.",950313600,,217,4.190476190476191
936830,4,6304783795,"This was the very first couple of Tenchi episodes I ever saw. And I was amazed at how good it was. I first rented it and loved it! I just got to get it on video. When I finally did! The one thing I was most disappointed  with,was that it needed a liiitle bit of more fighting. Just that! Tenchi  Muyo! fans! DON'T PASS OUT ON THIS!And other anime fans. At least give it a  chance just by renting it a your local video store.^_^

7878812,5,6304783795,"I would like to state first that Ryoko is my favorite character
and I always believed that she and Tenchi were made for each other. Now that thats off my chest I'll just say that the movie was one of the best I've ever seen. I am of course a ""major""
fan of Tenchi Muyo and have seen ""all"" the episodes. Most of them on Cartoon Network's Toonomi and my favorite episodes in the Tenchi Universe series were the last four. I had recently finished watching the shows of Tenchi Universe when I said to  myself,""I must have thoughs last episodes on video."" So I got on the Internet, found the VHS movie, and ordered. It was that simple. My ""favs"" of the four shows were,""No Need for Ryoko,"" and ""No Need for a conclusion."" The reason, because they really show how Tenchi ""does"" love Ryoko. I mean, the only reason why he went to save Aeka was because he didn't want to just leave her there, he's not that kind of guy. But of course, he wouldn't of married her. (Can you tell that I hate Aeka?) Anyway, the movie is sure to make you scream, laugh, and even cry! Even though its a comedy I really think of it more as a love story and I 'm sure you'll agree. Ryoko and Tenchi's love will last forever. The ending episode also opens up an imaginative story line. Anything can happen! I advise anyone that loves Tenchi Muyo and thinks that Ryoko and Tenchi belong together, to buy and keep forever the most romantic episodes in the series of Tenchi Universe.",1013990400,4,1447,4.319852941176471
7878813,5,6304783795,"I like this video better than all the other Tenchi Universe Videos because this contains more action and has suspense.  The best part I like is when Tenchi and the Gang goes to meet this ""Yoshow"" guy.  Who says he is Yoshow.  Turns out that this ""Yoshow"" character is Kagatow.  Tenchis Grandpa, Lord Katsohito is really Yoshow.  Kagatow being a dumb fool himself, thinks the Tenchi and the gang are not smart, but man is he wrong!  This video you should really get.  It contains four episodes and many exciting action always coming ahead.",1013126400,,538,4.659574468085107

And if you're a Ryoko fan this video might just be the thing you are looking for.  If you ask me Tenchi and Ryoko have something serious going on.,983491200,,286,3.913793103448276
7878818,5,6304783795,"These four episodes represent the best ending I've ever seen.
You'll want to see the rest of the series before the ending, since the conflicts presented earlier all come to a head here, and finally get resolved.
Unlike the OVA, Tenchi Universe has a solid ending where all the plot threads are wrapped up and a sense of rebirth is brought in.
The video has four episodes. The first one, ""No Need For Karma!"" reveals Kagato to be the man on the Jurai throne, and he and Yosho face off. It's an excellent fight, with a nice flashback sequence on Yosho's end that gives his character yet another twist. There's also a poignant dialogue between Tenchi and Ayeka, as we see Tenchi slowly drift toward one end of the love triangle.
The second episode, ""No Need for Ryoko!"" is the most touching episode I had ever watched (at least until I saw the final episode). We see Ryoko's feelings for Tenchi kick into overdrive as she pushes herself beyond even her own limits to help Tenchi carry out his plan. The episode ends on a tragic note, and the soundtrack brings it out to its fullest, moving most Tenchi fans to the point of tears.
The third episode on the tape, ""No Need for a Showdown!"" covers the final confrontation between Tenchi and Kagato. I thought that the final fight scene was a bit short, but I've never considered Tenchi to be an action-based anime, and there are a couple cool fights involving Azaka and Kamidake to go along with it. This episode features the end of Tenchi's journey and sets the stage for the wonderful last episode.
In the final episode, ""No Need for a Conclusion!"" everything gets wrapped up. Tenchi finishes the flashback that began all the way back in the first episode, and deals with each of the girls separately as they leave his life. Tenchi and Ayeka resolve things, and we finally learn of what happened to Ryoko. Ultimately, the whole story comes full circle. We learn of how Tenchi's feelings toward Ryoko and Ayeka have evolved, and we are treated to a combination of flashbacks and present scenes which tie the story back into its beginnings and set it up for some excellent movies.
I could go in detail about what I loved so much about these last four episodes, but that would spoil some of the surprises and drag down this emotionally charged conclusion.",983232000,9,2297,4.6048780487804875
