5135097,5,B0086IMNZI,Rin Tin Tin movies were great.  I love dogs and had a German Shepherd and she was a great dog.  This movies were well done.,1365897600,,123,3.88
5135098,1,B0086IMNZI,I purchased this DVD to see Rin-Tin-Tin but he is not in any of the movies mainly because he died before this films were made. Rin-Tin-Tin Jt is the dog start in each movie. This fact was not stated on the advertisement or the cover of the DVD.,1358985600,6,244,4.104166666666667
5135099,3,B0086IMNZI,"No, this isn't a collection of the 1950's TV show.  Nor, despite the cover description of ""The amazing dog who became a Hollywood Star"" does it contain any films made by the original Rin Tin Tin, who died in 1932.  Instead we have seven low-budget ""B"" films from the 1930's with Rin Tin Tin Junior, plus a later film with Rin Tin Tin the 3rd.  I found my copy in a $5 bargain bin in a grocery store, so I knew what I was getting, but since Amazon doesn't list the contents, here it is:

Skull and Crown (1935) with Regis Toomey and Jack Mulhall.

The Test (1935) with Monte Blue and Grant Withers.

Vengeance of Rannah (1935) with Bob Custer and Victoria Vinton.

Caryl of the Mounties (1936) with Francis X. Bushman, Jr., and Lois Wilde.

The Silver Trail (1937) with Rex Lease and Mary Russell.

Fangs of the Wild (1939) with Dennis Moore and Luana Walters.

Law of the Wolf (1939) with Dennis Moore and Luana Walters.

The Return of Rin Tin Tin (1947) with Bobby Blake, Donald Woods and Claudia Drake.

The films run about an hour each, and are entertaining if dramatic expectations are not high.  Only ""The Return of Rin Tin Tin"" is in color, though often the wrong ones owing to fading of the print.  I especially liked the blue sheep.  The image is not very sharp and fairly murky.  Much gets lost in the dark scenes, and the sound has quite a bit of distortion at the start of the film, sometimes making the dialogue hard to understand.  But the rather sentimental story of a psychologically damaged war-orphan boy's recovery through a dog is handled in a coherent manner.

The black-and-white films are Westerns or closely related to them, and were intended to fill out the Saturday matinee schedule.  Harry S. Webb and Bernard B. Ray were the producers, and often served as directors, sometimes under pseudonyms.  These were released by Reliable and Metropolitan Pictures, and the casts include many actors familiar from ""B"" movies and serials including Jack Mulhall, George Chesebro, Tom London, Joseph Swickard, Jack Ingram, Robert Frazer, Lafe McKee, James Aubrey, Milburn Morante, Robert Walker and Jack Mower, in addition to the ""stars"" in the contents list.  No surprise for films of this type, the writing and directing leave a lot to be desired, and the music, where present, is often not especially appropriate and badly dubbed.  The plots tend to have illogical elements, and while Rin Tin Tin usually saves the day, the dog vanishes about halfway through ""Vengeance of Rannah"" and ""The Silver Trail.""  Nor do the titles always relate to the contents of the film.

The set has two DVD's, one single-sided, the other a ""flippie"" and while too much is crammed onto some of the sides, the compression artifacts are not too obvious.  Several have been in other Mill Creek sets, and the films are taken from whatever source they could find.  Dirt and scratches are present, there are occasional splices, and a few videotape artifacts.  The video transfers have some faults; there are a couple fixed white splotches in ""Skull and Crown"" and quite a few more, with a fairly long streak through the picture in ""Law of the Wolf"" as if stray light got to the video transfer screen.  In ""Vengeance of Rannah"" the sound drops out several times in the opening minutes, like mistracking VHS Hi-Fi.  But all of these have fairly sharp images with tolerable gray scale, and if some have distortion and noise in the sound the dialogue can usually be understood.  Given the low price they can be considered ""watchable"" and a bargain for those interested in ""poverty row"" films, though hardly an ""Ultimate"" collection for Rin Tin Tin fans.",1348358400,31,3639,4.73015873015873
