1327169,5,B00003ETQ5,"This is, by far, the best quality DVD versions of the films, PENNY SERENADE and LOVE AFFAIR, that I've purchased. Obviously, the producer of this DVD went to the trouble of securing good quality 35mm prints of these  great classics to produce this DVD.  On both movies, the picture quality is  remarkably fine and sharp, and the sound quality is clear for the age of  the films.  The best part of this double feature DVD is the price--it's a  steal.  I'm throwing away my (awful) Madacy label DVDs of these films.  This new DVD is fabulous.",963964800,16,540,4.552083333333333

7918482,5,B00003ETQ5,"This is a classic and one of the best love stories between a man and a woman I have had the pleasure of viewing.  There have been a few re-makes to this love story, but for me Irene Dunne and Charles Boyer are the best.  It comes together so beautifully.  This classic story receives 5 stars from me.",1384992000,3,300,4.137931034482759

7918484,5,B00003ETQ5,"Irene Dunne is so underrated, she is a great comic and dramatic actress. I have watched every movie I can get my hands on.

 Just the last few years it seems more and more people are discovering Irene Dunne. Love Affair (original Dunne) great! Penny serenade, fantastic!",1142294400,9,270,4.723404255319149
7918485,3,B00003ETQ5,"Technically, I am afraid this double-bill is far below par. Images are blurred, sound is muffled and there is actually recurring sounds that seem to belong to another movie, like there was something on the flip side too which simmers through. The movies, especially the ever-touching, sophisticated and darkly hued 'Penny Serenade', are great, but are hardly served well by less than average technology.",1029196800,57,403,5.3125
7918486,2,B00003ETQ5,"I love Irene Dunn. I long to see I Remember Mamma and some of her other wonderful films, but this transer to DVD stinks.",1027382400,7,120,4.041666666666667
