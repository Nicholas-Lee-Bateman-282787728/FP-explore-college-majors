8202788,2,B000RWDXNW,"The series itself was ok, I have seen worse (beast machines) and better. But this review is going to be on the product and not the series. The item itself only has 9 of the episodes. So do not think you are getting the whole series. Also the sound quality is fairly good, but the video quality looks like it was copied from a VHS tape. So if you are a diehard Transformers fan and long for any of this series, get it. If you have doubts, save your money",1523232000,,453,4.044444444444444
8202789,1,B000RWDXNW,"The only good thing that can be said about this series is that, as a result of how bad it was, Michael Bay can take comfort in knowing that he is not the worst thing to happen to the Transformers franchise.",1519430400,,206,4.048780487804878
