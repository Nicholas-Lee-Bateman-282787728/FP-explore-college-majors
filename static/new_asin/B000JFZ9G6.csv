2670549,4,B000JFZ9G6,"If you are just getting into the opera genre, this is a must have.  Four classic operas with this generations greatest tenors for less than $9 per opera.  The acting is outstanding.  Would be nice if the video quality was improved especially on the earlier opera La Boheme, but the experience is still wonderful.",1296432000,21,312,4.7407407407407405
2670550,5,B000JFZ9G6,i got this for my dad. he loves it! It is wonderful. hours of fun!,1282521600,,66,3.466666666666667

Everything is distorted.",1250812800,4,101,5.0
2670552,5,B000JFZ9G6,"If you let yourself be guided by the cover of the DVD set, you would think that Pavarotti stars in all four operas included in the set; the truth is that he is the leading tenor in three of them. But pleasant surprise! Placido Domingo is the tenor in ""Il Tabarro"", Puccini's one-act opera which complements Leoncavallo's ""Pagliacci"", also included. So, despite being ""cheated"" of Pavarotti's presence here, one cannot complain: I appreciate the work of both of the leading tenors of the 20th Century. The quality of the recordings is not state of the art, but honestly did not interfere at all with my enjoyment of the operas. ""La Boheme"" could stand remastering, but the viedo and sound are more than adequate, nonetheless. The price for this set is one of the greatest bargains in the entire lineup of DVD recordings offered in Amazon.",1234051200,88,837,4.779310344827586
2670553,3,B000JFZ9G6,"A lot of opera for the money, product delivered in a timely manner in perfect condition.",1231200000,3,88,4.5625
2670554,5,B000JFZ9G6,"Like the Verdi Pavarotti album,this register like all the ones coming from Metropolitan are made under original conception. This together with the best performances of Pavarotti become an unavoidable DVD for people that likes these operas and that won't be repeated again",1214956800,9,271,5.476190476190476
2670555,5,B000JFZ9G6,"The Italian Opera Collection
Sometimes I rush & don't get what I intend to. I read the reviews before purchasing this DVD. Not only was it favorable but it kept me from making a mistake on a gift for my Husband.  The night of my husbands ""B"" Day he watched part of the Collection.  Boy was I shocked to see tears come down this 6'5"" - 220lb man's cheeks.  The 2nd night even more tears.  He says he has never seen such a Beautiful performance.  He is a Hughe Fan of the late Luciano Pavarotti.  Says The Italian Opera Collection by Luciano Pavarotti, Metropolitan Opera is more than 5 Star.  He highly recommends this item.",1212192000,60,623,4.3652173913043475
2670556,5,B000JFZ9G6,"Pavarotti is the best tenor in my lifetime. Here we have him in his prime.
I love to watch his expressive face and have goose bumps listening to his powerful voice.",1407974400,,164,4.32258064516129

2670559,2,B000JFZ9G6,"I do appreciate Pavarotti's performance, he at his old best, however the performance is very old and the filming shows it.  Not good sound, or cinema.",1403913600,,150,4.769230769230769
2670560,3,B000JFZ9G6,"Pavrotti has a superb voice, but he couldn't act his way out of a paper bag.  His lack of acting skills takes away from the otherwise fine performances.",1393200000,,152,4.428571428571429
2670561,5,B000JFZ9G6,"This is a great deal on several Italian operas.  There are actually 4 operas contained in this collection, one with Placido Domingo as the lead male vocalist, ""Il Tabarrro"" and three operas with Luciano Pavarotti as the lead tenor, ""I Pagliacci"", ""l'Elisir D'Amore"" and ""La Boheme"".  In other words, you get an extra opera not mentioned in the description.  I have not got through all of the operas but so far have loved what I have seen and would highly recommend this collection, especially to budding opera fans such as myself.  There is included a booklet which gives a fairly thorough description of each of the story lines and subtitle options in various languages for each of the operas.  Luciano Pavarotti is amazing and unequaled in my humble opinion.",1379980800,8,760,4.8604651162790695
