1869196,5,B00008YNI9,"This is indeed not your typical period drama. My daughter and I watched it straight through with gasps, and ""No don't"" moments throughout.

Such a sad demise for a woman of virtue as was Carissa, whose endearing protrayal of a woman true to her honor through to the end, makes this a movie with a message that should be taught to our children. It is honorable to maintain your dignity and faith through abuse and tribulation.

There was true suspense in this movie, with great acting and superb filming. In spite of the intense moments that were hard to watch, we were riveted throughout.",1135987200,5,588,4.644230769230769
1869197,4,B00008YNI9,"There is definitely bodice-ripping in this mini-series, but not the kind most females fawn over in period-piece fiction!  That said, as with most BBC offerings, it is well casted, performed, and costumed.  One may perceive a quandry with the production, however, which may simply be the result of a modern eye misted by too many steamy, contemporarily-penned, historical novels. This possible problem (for some viewers) is that the story breezes through its first half with the atmosphere of an airy, rogue-versus-maiden romance and then, in the second, slogs into a sturm-and-drang melodrama. Some characters are so utterly bad-to-the-bone or irredeemably ridiculous that the plot, at times, seems sprinkled with absurdist comedy.  Then, other roles have such a vampirish, schizophrenic quality that the story seems swept into a maelstrom of confused direction.  Thus, the characters' motivations, intentions, and true feelings appear fogged almost to the point of surreality.  Whether the result of a classic (or dated) mentality, this can be said:  if one lives for the hauntingly offbeat, Clarissa should provide a strong gust of fresh air.  If, on the other hand, period romance is what makes one breathy, stay in out of this melancholy rain!",1132185600,6,1247,5.364102564102564
1869198,5,B00008YNI9,"Set in the 18th century and based on Samuel Richardson's novel from the same period, Clarissa is a superb 1991 four-part British production (with 50-minute episodes) about a wealthy but lustful, vile rogue's attempt to conquer a pure and virtuous woman; or, on a more basic level, it is the attempt of vice to conquer virtue.  Clarissa, our beautiful heroine, is a good, dutiful and pious woman who, for her kindness and virtue, has, as the story opens, become the heir to her grandfather's fortune--to the exclusion and envy of her spiteful brother and sister, her parents, and her uncle, all of whom have conspired to take their revenge by attempting to force Clarissa into marriage with an intolerable, ugly, fopish idiot.  The irony is that Clarissa really does not want her grandfather's money; certainly she does not desire marriage.

Coincident with the reading of her grandfather's will, Clarissa has become the latest object of desire of Robert Lovelace (Sean Bean--Sharpe, Essex Boys, Bravo Two Zero, Extremely Dangerous, Fool's Gold)  a rake and a scoundrel who lives for the hunt--in all its incarnations.  His view of women is no different from his view of the birds he shoots from the sky--both exist for his sport.  He's a man who enjoys a challenge and savours the deflowering of chaste young women--whether by fair means or foul.

Clarissa is no fool.  Lovelace's reputation precedes him, and Clarissa wants nothing to do with him.  Tragically, however, the intolerable position she is put in by her family forces her to turn to Lovelace for help.  For Lovelace, it is all a game, and one's blood runs cold when his kind words to Clarissa are juxtaposed with his pub talk--talk which reveals a calculating mind, a cold heart, and a cruel inhumanity.  Lovelace is vice personified.  He is immoral and deceitful, full of trickery and treachery; most frightening of all, however, is that he is amoral, with no discernable concept of what's right from wrong.  Whilst the game is innocent enough at the start (from Lovelace's perspective!), it soon spirals out of control and Lovelace himself becomes a victim of his own trap, ensnared by his own growing obsession.

Noteworthy DVD extras include a few brief outtakes, Bean's and Wickham's screen tests, and text-based (but very interesting) production notes.

In conclusion, this is an outstanding period drama--one which I found to be very satisfying.  It is an engrossing, captivating tale peppered with an abundance of beautifully rich, witty dialogue.  The acting is impeccable; indeed, of all the villains Sean Bean has portrayed, I can think of none so vile, so utterly loathesome as that of Robert Lovelace.  Yet for all that, Lovelace is a complex character, and there are moments, however brief, when something akin to goodness attempts to break through.

Mandatory viewing for fans of Sean Bean, and highly recommended to all fans of quality, intelligent British productions--or indeed to anyone who enjoys period productions in general.",1129507200,4,3010,5.068965517241379
1869199,4,B00008YNI9,Very interesting and fast paced miniseries.  I saw this on PBS when it first came out and had to buy it for myself.  Clarissa is a charactor of depth and Lovelace is richly sinister. Facinating to watch Clarissa's family push her to distruction. I enjoyed the whole miniseries but the one episode of violence is not appropriate for someone under 17 years old.,1128902400,5,359,4.682539682539683
1869200,5,B00008YNI9,"I was reccomended this title a few years ago, before it came out on DVD. I searched high and low but found not a trace of it. Finally, I saw it was available here at long last! I purchased it without ever seeing a minute, and I was not too dissapointed.

This story is all about an heiress, Clarissa who is innocent enough to make you want to strangle her. She is the perfect lady, with morals and values. Of course, she runs into the most devious and seductive man who wants to charm her out of her virtues and her inheritance, while still sneaking around with her friends and relatives on the side.

Though the story begins a little slow, the costumes and settings are charming. The BBC always does an exquisite job of being period accurate when they make these long costume dramas! The house is gorgeous, the dresses are gorgeous, even the ugly men wearing HUGE puffy wigs are gorgeous.

A quick plot summary: Clarissa is the heiress to her father's fortune, which makes her sister and brother (possibly having an incestuous relationship?!?) VERY jealous and angry. They begin to plot against her. Enter Mr. Lovelace. Mr. Lovelace is a ""bad guy"", who was making advances on Clarissa's sister. He quickly breaks off their attachment to persue Clarissa, for her fortune at first. As time goes on, Clarrisa denied her inheritance, and tortured by her family to marry a toad-like suitor. When she refuses, all hell breaks loose. Mr. Lovelace undertsnads this predicament and offers to help Clarissa by running away with her.  Throught the movie, Mr. Lovelace has to fight his true feelings for Clarissa (love) and his feelings to rape her (his usual way). His fight with his own feelings are apparent, and Sean Bean is excellent.

I will watch anything with costumes and a decent story though, so I will let you be the judge. If you enjoyed films like The Forsyte Saga, Dangerous Liasions, Valmont, He Knew He Was Right and other period BBC slow-moving sagas, then this DVD is for you.",1125360000,52,1984,4.673352435530086
1869201,5,B00008YNI9,"Here is the source of ""Valmont"" and ""Dangeous Liasons"". Robert Lovelace is a passionate rake. Rich and awash in privilege he sees nothing wrong with the game of seduction. To seduce a pious virgin is his undoing. In the course of this seduction he loses both his heart and his soul. The rape scene is unnerving and may be deeply disturbing to some viewers. Coming out of this pivotal scene with any sort of feeling for Lovelace is a mark of how painfully good an actor Sean Bean is. Watch this first followed by ""Valmont"" and then ""Dangeous Liasons"" and you will see the perfect evolution of a classic 17th century theme. The rich production values pull you in to the action and the main theme of seduction still leaves room for the fundamental plot of Greed and Spite to come shining through. A viewing banquet.",1125360000,4,812,4.568493150684931
1869202,4,B00008YNI9,"Samuel Richardson's 18th century novel of vice and virtue, revenge and manipulation begins with famously virginal CLARISSA (Acorn) Harlowe inheriting her grandfather's huge estate.  But she has no interest in wealth and passes it to her father, ignoring her siblings James and Bella.

Clarissa also claims no interest in marriage but notices her sister's current beau, the notorious lady's man Robert Lovelace.  Angry and jealous at being passed over, and with their parents approval, James and Bella try to force Clarissa into marrying the repulsive Solmes, a man of ""material advantage."" That only pushes a desperate Clarissa into Lovelace's arms, a man she does not trust but who quickly becomes obsessed with her, even though all his tried and true seduction tricks fail.

So begins the great BBC production from the early 90s.  Anyone who has seen it will surely remember the exciting twists and shocks of this magnificent miniseries now on DVD for the first time.

If it all sounds stodgy, don't be deceived, this is the granddaddy of all the dangerous liaisons copycats (including ""Dangerous Liaisons"").

Everything about this fast moving show is top notch: acting, screenplay, production values, and direction.  I can't think of a better description of this absolutely riveting drama than the original press release: ""Vice was his weapon, virtue hers.  Love would destroy them both.""

Even if British drama is not your cup of tea, sip this delicious brew.",1121817600,127,1463,5.187234042553191
1869203,5,B00008YNI9,"This BBC production of ""Clarissa"" is an excellent adaption of the 18th Century Samuel Richardson work. Excellent production values in regard to script, costume, and scenery. Sean Bean readily captures the seductive snake-like qualities of Lovelace. Saskia Wickham also gives a great performance that showcases Clarissa's innocence while losing none of her inner strength. This film imbues the Clarissa character with feminist sensibilities, though not in the modern sense of the word. This film would be a great addition to any college library.",1120780800,19,544,5.566265060240964
1869298,4,B00008YNI9,"Saw this movie years ago. The acting is good, costumes great and I do like the story, though there are some parts that are for Adults only. Could have been left out, or acted a little more -less realistic. It's a sad story. It's not my favorite, but worth watching least once a year.",1385078400,,283,4.2592592592592595
1869299,4,B00008YNI9,"Samuel Richardson's CLARISSA is the original tale of Regency revenge and lust, setting the template for the more-familiar ""Dangerous Liaisons"" and ""Valmont"" which followed shortly after.  This 1991 BBC miniseries stars Sean Bean as the carnally sexual Lovelace, who sets his sights on a virtuous beauty and leads them both down a path to ultimate destruction.

Clarissa Harlowe (Saskia Wickham) is the picture of beauty and innocence, and carries a loyal heart that's just as gentle as her exterior.  That is precisely what attracts the attention of Lovelace (Sean Bean), a callow womaniser who decides to bed, soil and discard the girl purely to satisfy his own ego.  When Clarissa inherits the bulk of her grandfather's fortune, her jealous brother and sister (Jonny Phillips and Lynsey Baxter) manipulate Clarissa into Lovelace's clutches by making her a virtual prisoner in the family home.  When Lovelace finally ""dashes to the rescue"", Clarissa's fate is sealed.  Banished from the family and virtually struck from the record altogether, Clarissa is installed as a guest in the London whorehouse where Lovelace is a frequent customer.  The girl proves too steadfast in her convictions, however, leading Lovelace to new depths in his quest to seduce her...

It's not the most lighthearted fare - in fact it's almost too depressing - but CLARISSA is a mesmerizing costume drama for fans of the genre.  This was one of Sean Bean's first real acting assignments of note and he delivers a rich performance.  Saskia Wickman's acting career seems to have turned into a more low-key affair (lots of guest spots on various British TV shows) but sadly nothing else to really equal the scale of her monumental Clarissa Harlowe.  She was (or was shortly to be) married to CLARISSA's director Robert Bierman.

If you appreciate costume drama you'll really need to add this to your collection.",1333584000,,1885,5.1042345276872965
1869300,1,B00008YNI9,"For the book I have never read, maybe this was a good movie. However, I was deceived by the description on the back of this movie that it would be  great to watch, but I am very disappointed that it did not end the way I expected",1331251200,,229,3.872340425531915
1869301,5,B00008YNI9,"One of the most nightmarish stories ever to appear on ""Masterpiece Theater"".

1869302,5,B00008YNI9,"Having read the unabridged ""Clarissa"", I watched this tv version with extremely low expectations, thinking that it could never do justice to that great book. Was I ever wrong! Not only were the location shoots and costumes beautiful, but the writers succeeded in distilling the essence of a very long book into three short episodes. Highly recommended to anyone who appreciates English literature or the Eighteenth Century.",1255564800,3,423,5.3283582089552235
1869303,5,B00008YNI9,"While I am a fan of the lighter and more romantic tales set in this era, Clarissa stands out as showing the side of our history which some would wish to forget. A world where there are not also happy endings and nice people.

The character of Clarissa is played to perfection by Saskia. Not for her acting I probably wouldn't have cried for most of episode 3! She plays the role of a woman who is happy to forsake men for her own beliefs and faith. Her family though, who through the generations have become a highstanding family, see Clarissa as a means to acquiring more money and land. Her brother and sister conspire against her and it is her fmaily that leave Clarissa with little choice to be rescued by Lovelace - a decision which she regrets.

The saddest thing about this entire movie is the fact that you know what Lovelace's plan is. He has no love for Clarissa, just a desire to break her as a woman as evident with his discussions with his friend Jack.

Many have commented on the rape scene - and I did find it confronting myself as it does appear to happen in a line of events rather quickly - but it is where the story has headed since the beginning and is done to show the true nature of Lovelace and bring out the humanity in Jack.

Eventually Clarissa gets the forgiveness of her family, but it is all too late - and no matter what her father does, he knows it will never be right.

This is certainly a film for adults, not children due to content, but it does tell the story of the darker side of history which many would prefer not to acknowledge.

I say buy it (and 2 boxes of tissues!).",1249084800,5,1609,4.241830065359477
1869304,5,B00008YNI9,"This must have been a difficult book to film, given that it was written over 250 years ago and was very long, but I thought the film adaptation very successful.  I found the 18th century language a little difficult, but the pace was fast and the film exciting.  Sean Bean (as always!) was brilliant and even managed to gain one's sympathy at times, despite being such an evil character. The rest of the cast excellent.  For ""Hamish Macbeth"" fans, it was fun to see ""T.V. John"" in a full bottomed wig.  Definitely one of the best costume dramas  have seen recently.",1245283200,5,564,4.544554455445544
1869305,1,B00008YNI9,"No matter how ""well done"" this movie is, it is an awful story, including a graphic rape scene. Shame on Masterpiece Theater. Avoid.",1216684800,8,131,4.739130434782608
1869306,5,B00008YNI9,"A good few years ago I watched Clarrisa on TV and fell in love with the story. Since then I have been waiting for it's release and was  so excitied to finally find it out on dvd. It has everything a great romantic/tragic classic should. A great story of a young lady who is known for her out standing virtue, who in desperation to escape a dreadful impending marriage (which of course has been set up by her family) falls in to the arms of a handsome scoundral, who is desperate to help himself to her virtue no matter what the cost. And this is where things start to fall apart. The casting is well done, especially with Sean Bean as the leading man, the story is romantic, gripping and full of twists and it stands the test of time.",1212451200,4,734,4.242857142857143
1869307,4,B00008YNI9,"Based on one of the (allegedly) longest novels in Anglo canon, ""Clarrisa"" tells the tragic story of a woman whose beauty is matched only by her virtue.  (How tragic?  Let's just say that in the novel, told in a series of letters, the reading of a character's will takes up an entire chapter, or a dozen chapters worth of what you'd find in a contemporary novel.)

This TV movie (which I caught years ago on ""Masterpiece Theater"") has a fascinating take on Regency-era England - unwilling to commit to an utterly bleak view or go the ribald ""Tom Jones"" route or even mix the two, ""Clarissa"" starts out light and then suddenly, shockingly, enters utter darkness.  The suddenly-rich Harlowes, eager to cement their place in society, plan to marry off their lovely daughter, Clarissa, as soon as possible.  Clarissa is already marked by fate when her grandfather bequeaths everything to her - passing over her two vindictive siblings.  ""Clarry"" compounds this error by turning over everything to her father - making James and Bella all the more eager to work their frustrations out on their sister by forcing her into an unwanted marriage with the unlikable Solmes.  (In the novel, he's described as obese, and his marriage proposals are rejected even by women of lower social and financial standing than Clarissa; the movie is crueler - imagine one of those rotting corpses you often see haunting the Indiana Jones movies, dress it up ala 18th century, top it off with a peruke, give it a horrific smile, and you've got your man, unfortunately.  One look at the man and you realize how James and Bella must really have it in for her.)

To the rescue comes the dashing Lovelace (that name is already a red flag).  Worldly, apparently independent, unspeakably handsome and fearless.  He makes his feelings for Clarry clear, knowing that this will increase her attraction to him.  At this point, the story has that purposefully awkward taste, like a British farce, with Clarry as the prize, James and Bella as the antagonists, Solmes as the comic relied and Lovelace as the hero.  Unfortunately for everybody involved, the story takes a nosedive into Baroque Tragedy.  Lovelace is in every way the soulless rake - literally - he denies the existence of the soul and is determined to conquer Clarissa in flesh and mind.  Clarry is only the latest of Lovelace's conquests - women who began life as girls with small flaws enlarged into gaping chasms of fire and filth when defiled by Lovelace.  Unfortunately for Lovelace, Clarissa very fiercely holds to the idea of a soul and shields it behind the fortitude of her virtues.  With each assault on her body, Lovelace both pushes Clarissa's soul away and realizes a deepening lover for it.  Can this doomed romance end happily?  (Suffice it to say that the novel carried an extended post-text decrying what we now fatuously call the ""Hollywood Ending"".)

This adaptation seems short given the original's infamous length, though its brevity can be seen as a saving grace.  Clarissa here seems less virtuous than childish.  Her vindictive sibs don't seem all that bad even if the consequences of their actions are as destructive - which drives home the point that even shallow caprice can lead to great evil.  The high point of this sped-up version is the defilement of our heroine.  Like a train wreck, the assault on Clarry comes out of nowhere with shocking speed.  You can feel its approach and you beg yourself to look away even as you know you can't.  You know that the roguish Lovelace only appears to be subtle, but it isn't until he commits The Overt Act that you realize how monstrously unsubtle he is.  The Clarissa of the novel has plenty of time to build her case for the inviolate soul, sliding the story into the realm of classic tragedy, while the movie's Clarry hasn't enough time or emotional reserve to convince us that her belief isn't anything more than a convenient and protective delusion against her violation.  Instead of slipping into tragedy, the film drives full-speed into the shadow of an endless chasm.  Even Lovelace's descent into expiation seems especially poignant here - the script probably wanted to suggest a happy ending, but it more suggests what we wanted to think all along, namely that for the agony wreaked on others, Lovelace remains his own worst victim.

This was a great production - setting and costuming were top-notch without getting in the way of the story.  Sean Bean was probably a natural choice to play the wicked Lovelace - though he excels above type.  As Clarissa, Saskia Wickham will break your heart.  Definitely for those who want to revisit that era in fiction without having to take the way through Austen or Bronte territory.",1209859200,7,4728,4.833540372670807
1869358,4,B00008YNI9,"Wonderful made for TV series tells the classic tale of a young upper class woman Clarissa.  Clarissa is a young lady brought up in a wealthy family, of exceptional virtue.  She is so pure and innocent that her grandfather decides to leave her all of his wealth.  This of course, is a time in England when women (wives and daughters) were property of their fathers and brothers.  In spite of her wealth, Clarissa is persuaded by her parents that she should submit control of her wealth to her family that will manage her money for her.  This turns out to be her death sentence.  Her siblings, father and uncle are angry for being left out from the will.  To test her obedience, Clarissa's family promises her to a marriage to another wealthy man.  This man is repulsive in more ways than one and Clarissa is desparate to find a way to avoid this marriage.  Her (female) friends cannot be her protectors so she is forced to turn to a man for protection.  This man, wealthy and handsome himself, is obsessed with seducing and abandoning Clarissa for the sake of humiliating her and satisfying his own ego.  As the turn of events ends tragic, one cannot stop and think how women's lives, 200 years later have improved so much (at least in the western hemisphere).  Any woman, after watching these series or reading a book, will be delighted to learn that in today's world women are free to make their own decisions and the ""female virtue"" itself is re-defined.  Women are no one's property and with education women can be independant to the point where women can not only manage their money, but also make lots of it their professional careers.  Definitely series that will get one thinking about difference between past and present.  It is also a story of greed and devastating consequences it can bring to friends, family and lovers.",1204588800,5,1831,4.660436137071651

1869360,5,B00008YNI9,It was as a result of watching this production in the early 1990's that I took to reading the works of Mr. Richardson and consider myself a rather broad reader today. This production is very very good and the one horrorific scene is so well acted that you feel the same pain as the character.

1869361,4,B00008YNI9,"I bought this DVD with some trepidation due to its mixed reviews.  However, as a dedicated Sean Bean fan, I weakened and ordered it. This is like an 18th century soap opera!  Clarissa is SO pious, you could kick her, Lovelace is the rottenest rat you could ask for, Clarissa's brother and sister the most unnatural and vicious of siblings, and wait till you see Clarissa's bridegroom to be (chosen by her family).  What a fantastic caricature of an inbred aristocrat!  This is definately not along the lines of Jane Austen, but that does not mean you will neccessarily dislike it.  I actually got more of a laugh out of this than anything (Not Samuel Richardson's intent, I am sure), but it was so melodramatic, and Sean Bean so obviously relished his utter evilness (is that a word?), that you can't help but chuckle.",1188691200,6,818,4.652777777777778
1869362,5,B00008YNI9,"I bought this movie because I am a Sean Bean fan, and I could see by the synopsis that this type of story would best showcase his acting ability.  In that respect I was not disappointed.  In fact, Sean Bean's performance greatly increased my respect for him as an actor.  Having no prior knowledge of Samuel Richardson or the book upon which this movie was based, I had actually thought it would be a romance somewhat along the lines another 18th century novel, Pamela.

Being a modern woman and a romantic, I watched the movie in anticipation of the moment when Richard Lovelace would begin his reformation.  I was disappointed that his character never improved.  In fact, he got noticeably worse as his frustration increased.  By the midpoint of the production, I had at last thrown off my rose-colored glasses and accepted the fact that I was watching a different kind of story than the Jane Austen, Catherine Cookson ones I have lately enjoyed.

This is a story about good versus evil. Clarissa and Lovelace both experience it internally as well as externally.  Clarissa is the character dedicated to doing the right and honorable thing and being true to herself, yet she flirts with evil and it gets her into trouble.  Lovelace is the wicked rake with designs on Clarissa's virtue, yet through his tender feelings for Clarissa, he is tempted to give up his wickedness and be won over to her goodness.  There is a part of Lovelace that would like to be reformed by Clarissa while at the same time Clarissa is tempted to believe  she can reform Lovelace and then give herself to him.

The attraction between Clarissa and Lovelace is evident from the moment they meet.  Clarissa's determination to preserve her virtue and Lovelace's steadfast resistance to Clarissa's goodness creates an electrifying sexual tension.  Here is where the genius of the casting comes into play.  Lovelace's continual deceptions and schemes would have gotten very boring if not for Sean Bean's ability to showcase Lovelace's internal conflict.  Lovelace is obviously smitten with Clarissa, yet he is just as uncompromisingly wicked as she is uncompromisingly good.  At the same time, Lovelace is tender enough to make me believe that his cold heart will thaw and that he will begin to do things that make him worthy of Clarissa's love.  Saskia Wickham had the most difficult job of all in making her character sympathetic and believable.  It would have been so easy to make Clarissa too good and noble, yet this actress was able to show the subtle weaknesses in Clarissa.  She showed Clarissa's attraction to Lovelace and the desperation that drove her to accept Lovelace's help when her family tried to keep her a virtual prisoner in her home.  If Clarissa had not been drawn to Lovelace, I do not think she ever would have done it, and she would have been forced to find a safer, better way to be delivered from a vile marriage. Clarissa seemed a bit nave in the beginning, and some might have thought her stupid to be so easily manipulated by Lovelace.  Yet, Lovelace was a master manipulator.  He manipulated everyone he met, even his enemies.  It seems somewhat unrealistic until one bears in mind how many famous mass murders and criminals were expert manipulators.  Clarissa is a strong character and Siskia Wickham's rendering successfully shows it.  When Clarissa finds out about Lovelace's lies, she never trusts him again.  She also gives him the opportunity to fess up, yet he never does.  What is truly amazing about Lovelace is his ability to look her in the face and tell blatant lies in such a way to make them believable.  Again, I do not think just any actor could have pulled that off.

Despite the age of this tale, I found it actually very modern.  There are some human conditions that never change regardless of the culture and the technology.  One of these conditions is human pride and arrogance which in the end were the cause of Lovelace's destruction.  Lovelace would never concede defeat to a woman whose will was as strong, if not stronger than his.  That pride led to the ruination of Clarissa's life and to the ruination of any chance that Lovelace might have had to win Clarissa's heart.  She admitted later that she could have loved him.  Had Lovelace relented just enough to be truthful and vulnerable to Clarissa, or had he been able to let her go, he might have found a measure of the happiness he sought.  One can read the news reports, and see stories everyday of stalkers and abusers who mistreat the women they supposedly love, but whose ego will never allow them to release these women.  All too often this situation results in the death of the love interest.  In the end, it is not a story of love, but of power and manipulation.

Another reviewer lamented that Clarissa was not like one of Jane Austen's characters.  First of all Jane Austen's books always resulted in happy endings.  Life often does not end that way.  In most cases, keeping virtue in an evil society often demands sacrifice and is rarely rewarded in the material sense.  In a material sense, Lovelace destroyed Clarissa.  He imprisoned her in a bordello and did everything he could to cut her off from anyone who could have helped her.  Some viewers might belittle Clarissa for having allowed this situation to happen, but one must bear in mind that this story happened in the 18th century and aristocrats did have the power to do these evil things to people on a lower social rung.  As long as Clarissa's family was unwilling to help her or take her back, Clarissa had few options.  It was a cruel world in which life was cheap and women had few protections.  Clarissa lost the will to live because her own family and Lovelace had betrayed her.  She sought solace in her faith and in her desire to be with Jesus who offered her the comfort and love she sought.  Perhaps some modernists might see that as weak, but had Clarissa accepted the money offered her and escaped her prison, she would have been at the mercy of someone else, just as she had been at the mercy of her family and of Lovelace.  Clarissa's only option for independence was the prison.  There she was safe.  There and only there could she experience life on her own terms.

Modern day viewers can watch this drama and be thankful they live in more enlightened times, but then again we would all do well to remember that we too can be destroyed by those more powerful and well-connected than ourselves.  Someone can sue us.  The IRS can audit and harass us.  Someone can assault us, injure us, and do us all sorts of harm.  These things happen to innocent people everyday.  None of us is exempt if someone else is determined to take our freedom from us.  We can fight back and maybe prevail, but victory is never certain.  The only thing we have the ability to affect is our own reaction to adversity.  We have the option to become better people and to live out our faith and ideals as Clarissa did or we can become bitter and angry and allow our souls to be swept away by the tide of events.

Clarissa was victorious in the fact that her death was not in vain.  By her suffering and death, she managed to redeem Lovelace's friend Peter and her mother and father as well.

All in all, Clarissa was a satisfying drama and worth my time to watch.  Though I have no desire to see it again anytime soon, I would highly recommend it.",1186012800,15,7389,4.640986132511556
1869363,5,B00008YNI9,"This story is gripping and Sean Bean does an amazing job. I disagree with one reviewer who siad that if you like Pride and Prejudice that you won't like Clarissa (P&P is my favourite). If however you like the light, airy and witty, then this may be too dark for you. However, I felt that the ending is very redeaming. Unlike Dangerous Liasons (a novel which was inspired by the novel that 'Clarissa' is based upon) the heroine is pure throughout the entire story and stands by her Christian values. It is a story almost of virtue versus corruptness - and virtue wins. It is an excellent piece but not for those who like neat, happy endings. I saw this first on television and purchased it the moment it was released on dvd.",1177804800,4,723,4.443609022556391

Toward the end of the movie, after many twists and turns, when it is clear that she wants nothing to do with him, and rapes her while others hold her down, something I didn't expect at all.  She feels so violated, that she wills herself to die. I hated the story so much that I regret viewing it. Had I known about the rape scene I would not have wasted my time watching this.  Silly me in believing that virture will always triumph--certainly not in this story.

1869365,1,B00008YNI9,"If you like Pride & Prejudice, you won't like this film.

This movie is too dark and foreboding for my taste. Yes, the actors play their parts well, yes the costumes are terrific, but the script leaves you feeling depressed and yelling at the tv, ""Enough is enough!""",1165190400,14,266,4.541666666666667
1869366,1,B00008YNI9,"Yes hated.  I'm at a disavantage having not read the book, but I have to say this movie was not what I expected at all.  I have never felt prompted to write a bad review EVER until now (sorry Sean Bean - whose work I usually love). I hate I bought the DVD instead of renting it first.

*The below review is my opinion and contains spoiler info*

I'm not the kind of movie watcher who has to have a happy ending because I understand it doesn't always happen in real life, so it doesn't have to happen for me in a movie. In addition to that, I also love a great character study even if some of the characters are of ill-repute. However, this movie was long, drawn out and ALL of the characters REALLY got on my nerves.  I found myself not caring for, wanting to understand or LIKING any of them early on.  I have no problem watching movies where in order for the story to unfold, the viewer must get a little dirty as he/she follows the characters.  I found the characters exhausting in just TRYING to find any reason to care what each one did or didn't do next.  The end result was disturbing in which you wanted to watch Brady Bunch afterwards just to get rid of the dark filthy oppressive feeling you had afterwards. Neither character was believable in their diligence to maintain or obtain what each lived for. Neither character was someone I could sympathize with (which is saying a lot since one of them was held down by a group while being raped! All for love?) I don't see how this movie can benefit anyone on any level.  Again, I can only write an opinion based on this movie version, as I have not read the book.  For all I know, the book may incite compassion and sympathy from it's reader towards one or all of the characters whether they are the victim or the victimizer. This movie does not. It makes you angry that you were ever introduced to either character, angry that it was ever put on film and angry that you wasted any of your time watching it.",1165190400,27,1964,4.283783783783784
1869367,3,B00008YNI9,"As a fan of period pieces, in particular Wives & Daughters, The Buccaneers, etc., I was quite disapointed with Clarissa.  While I cannot fault the actors for the story line (quite disturbing), the acting was so so and far from believable.  As the price is quite expensive for these dvds, I would wait for it to be lowered or purchase it used.",1164412800,7,342,4.5
1869426,1,B00008YNI9,"Not what I expected when renting this movie. As others have said Clarissa came off too pure and innocent.  Futhermore, I don't understand why such a viriginal woman would run off to be with one of the most horrid men in the world?  Everyone knows what Lovelace has done..there are numerous accounts. Yet she goes with him anyway?  Blah.  The acting was OK. The costumes were excellent(I love period movies) but the plot dragged and dragged and dragged.  And as another put it, I was very glad when Clarissa kicked the bucket.

I read a lot of historical fiction, classic novels and love period movies, but there was no liking this one. It just couldn't be done.",1163980800,7,661,4.6068376068376065

1869428,1,B00008YNI9,"CLARISSA may be one of the slowest-moving teleplays I've ever seen.  This despite some top-notch performances (especially Sean Bean as Lovelace); the exquisite costumes, the settings.  The actress playing Clarissa, unfortunately, came off as a self-rightous little prig.  You're not supposed to feel relief when she dies, but I sure did.  She's not very pretty either, so the attraction or lust that Lovelace felt was inexplicable -- I guess corrupting her absolute innocence and strong morals were the real attraction, and yet, despite his dastardly deeds, I felt more pity for Lovelace.  The story does drag a bit; don't let the rave reviews fool you.  It's worth seeing for Sean Bean's performance and several of the supporting ones but the story moves too slowly and is on the whole a very depressing one.",1152057600,15,809,5.045112781954887
1869429,2,B00008YNI9,"As a fan of Acorn Media and a viewer of anything BBC that I can get my hands on, I have to say that I was disappointed by this production. Lovelace was far too villainous (every villain needs a redeeming quality). And the presentation of the ""fake fire"" followed by his complete recklessness seemed straight off the set of a high-school play.

I regret being this harsh, as I'm always rooting these programs to be first rate. But the performance turned up no redeeming characters for me -- save for Hermione Norris (whom I have worshipped ever since seeing Berkeley Square). Saskia Wickham's performance as Clarissa is without nuance, never truly tempted and predictably snappish throughout.

I walked away from the screen wishing Andrew Davies had writ the script.",1149379200,11,765,4.922480620155039
1869430,5,B00008YNI9,"Read Pamela and The History of Sir Charles Grandison, but SEE this production of Clarissa. The four part presentation of this infinitely sad yet daringly racy Richardson novel is amazingly smart, stylish and cynically funny. The mounting is gorgeous, from the selection of its beautiful young perfomers to the settings and ravishing costumes. The touch is light and delicate, very nearly turning the exquisite, spirited and classically honorable Clarissa's short, injured life and tragically self willed death into a satire on 18th century greed, lust and hypocrasy. Highly recommended for any fan of 18th century literature.",1146182400,12,625,5.520833333333333
1869431,3,B00008YNI9,"I understand the difficulties inherent in making a movie from a book that is almost 2,000 pages long, so I feel a little bad about criticizing what was mostly a good effort. However, the first 2/3rds or so was so well done that I cannot understand why the end had to be so bad.

 I was pleased up until the scene with the ""fire"". Robert Lovelace is supposed to be suave; he is an experienced seducer. He should not attack Clarissa. It was all down hill from there. Robert is not a good man, but he should be an appealing bad one. At the end of this movie he was simply disgusting. The rape scene was far too messy. What Robert's  morals would allow him to do, his pride would prevent. He would not commit a public rape. He would (as he did in the book) drug the girl so he could do the deed quietly with no vulgar struggle.

Furthermore, in the novel the rape scene is his lowest point. From there his genuine horror over the consequences of his actions -- to Clarissa, not to himself, in the novel he is not snubbed when his crimes become public -- redeems him. In the grand tradition of tragic heroes, he becomes a worthwhile human being just in time to die, so that we can morn him. In the movie my reaction to his death was more along the lines of ""well thank God that's over!""

 This brings me to my biggest objection. What were they thinking having Jack kill Robert? I understand that there are enough characters already without trying to introduce Colonel Mordan, but that was not an acceptable solution.

 All in all, my advice is this: watch up until the ""fire"", then read volume 4 of Richardson's novel. You will thus save yourself about 1,500 pages of rather wordy novel and about 45 minutes of poor movie adaptation.",1145232000,19,1728,4.361370716510903

1869434,5,B00008YNI9,I remember watching this when it was first broadcast on PBS and I was absolutely glued to my seat in front of the TV. I couldn't wait to see the next installment of this drama. The costumes are exquisitely beautiful especially in one scene where two courtesans pose as high class aunts of the scheming Lovelace. All the actors played their roles to the hilt and Sean Bean (way before he hit the movie screen) was superb as Lovelace.

The acting, in particular is wonderful.  Sean Bean as the dastardly Lovelace and Saskia Wickham as the virginal and determined Clarissa give outstanding performances.  In fact, the entire cast is wonderful.

I've never read Samuel Richardson's book; however, I do feel that this presentation does a stupendous job in its portrayal of the subject matter.  I certainly got a very strong sense from this presentation that women in the 18th century were, for the most part, mere chattel with not very many human rights.  Even if they had money, their lives were controlled by men even if the men were nothing more than scoundrels. Lovelace, at best, was a ""dirt bag""; however, he completely controlled, at his whims, Clarrisa.  The only way she could actually get from ""under"" his powers was to die.

She seems wise to the world and yet  powerless. That's the way they liked 'good' women then, I guess. Yet she was wealthy, and wealth should have given her power to protect herself. The whores are vicious by the way, beneath their mantle of deceit and much more in control as they help Lovelace in all his scheming...nothing was so shocking to me ( SPOILER ) as their part in the rape scene. Sean Bean of course, is absolutely amazing in this and manages to twist the knife into your heart throughout the entire production, you hate him and love him alternately as each second goes by and ultimately, again, of course, because this is Sean Bean we're talking about...you see Lovelace caught in a web of his own ugly actions. Somehow, however, ( I will have to go back and read the book again) Bean makes Lovelace so much more than a mere villain you feel for him and believe his protestations of love even when in the next breath he is plotting, to the point where you are as confused and lost in this spiral of tragedy as he is. As he says "" the natural consequences of rape are not death..."" Again we come back to the limited actions of 17th-18thc. fictional heroines...Clarissa goes from cage to cage to cage.",1432944000,,1764,4.478260869565218

Secondly, it was just depressing and often downright stupid.  Perhaps it's the British/American difference, but I don't think so.  I watch a ton of BBC stuff and love it, for the most part.
