Highly recommended if you need to eliminate some stress.",1215475200,,227,4.159090909090909

This video offers an opportunity to hear the musicality of his performance in a setting that fits it perfectly.

3438693,5,B0019LJ6IG,This is a Super ( no pun intended ) video that depicts the best parts of being alive.  Very relaxing to watch and listen to any time of the day and is great background music for any time of the day or night.  Must see and hear this one.,1211846400,,236,3.795918367346939

8274398,4,B0019LJ6IG,"What a relaxing experience.  The quality was a little disappointing, but overall okay.  I wish they would provide locations of the shots.",1361750400,,137,5.181818181818182
8274399,1,B0019LJ6IG,"I love nature type DVD's and thought this would show Spring with flowers budding and opening, the summer section was OK except for sun glare on the picture, but fall only showed yellow and green leaves on trees,very vanilla, No reds or golds and the winter section was shot at a discount department store, with cheap looking Christmas decorations.  An old fashioned ceramic town.  There are so many wonderful nature picture they could have shown.  A total waste of money.",1311811200,3,471,4.8625
8274400,1,B0019LJ6IG,"Dont waste your money. Not at all professional. Some scenes, lens on camera smudged. Picture of roaring fire ruined by dogs rear end. Winter scene was nothing more than christmas ornaments. Outdoor scenery shot in someones back yard. Piano music used instead of nature sounds. All in all not really worth the money.",1286496000,10,315,4.962264150943396
8274401,4,B0019LJ6IG,I had been looking for something like this. It's perfect for allowing people to fall into a mild relaxation while enjoying the wonderful scenery the creator picked for us. Definitely worth buying.,1261612800,,196,5.15625
8274402,3,B0019LJ6IG,I use this dvd at my massage studio.  I play it in the lobby for the clients waiting.  The picture is very clear and good quality.  It has a varity of photos (still and moving).  I haven't listened to the music on it. We play a spa channel on the radio and turn down the tv volume.  The dvd does not offer a loop of repeat so you will have to have that function on your remote/player. Over all it was a good choice.,1252108800,2,415,3.892857142857143
8274403,1,B0019LJ6IG,I found the video to be of very poor quality. The loud piano music was anything but relaxing. I did get a laugh at the shots of what looked like doll house furniture. There are much better videos available though usually more expensive than this one.,1232064000,23,250,4.456521739130435
8274404,1,B0019LJ6IG,When purchased there were nothing but five star reviews. Was I ever disappointed when I received and viewed the DVD.  It looks homemade down to shaking that looks like a hand held video.  It lacks creativity and imagination.  Music is nice.,1230422400,27,240,4.804878048780488
8274405,5,B0019LJ6IG,I recieved this as a gift very relaxing and wonderful music. Nice to watch or just listen to.,1227398400,,93,4.222222222222222
