4687060,5,B005G1731M,I was amazed at how quickly this was shipped especially during the holidays.  My granddaughter was throughly delighted.  This was a hard to find item and like always you can depend on amazon.  Thank you!!!!!,1325548800,,207,4.857142857142857
4687061,4,B005G1731M,"Our 4 year old granddaughter LOVES Madagascar, so she is so happy to watch this set of cartoons.  My only complaint has to do with the production, not the sending.  I wish the cartoons would just play through instead of needing to hit PLAY each time the cartoon ends. Otherwise, the DVD arrived new, in good shape, and is popular here.",1325376000,,335,4.475409836065574
4687062,5,B005G1731M,The Penguins of Madagascar strike again.  This is a really good Christmas short.  Extemely funny.  I would def recommend this for your Madagascar loving self or child.,1325030400,,167,5.111111111111111
4687063,5,B005G1731M,Bought this because both me and the kids love those penguins! Some great winter episodes on this disk. As well as a great christmas episode.,1323820800,,140,4.64
4687064,3,B005G1731M,"First, I am a fan of all of the Madagascar and the Penguins are great in all of the movies. Also, the kids laugh hard at Merry Madagascar. The Penguins on their own are good but they are 3 stars compared to the entire Madagascar group. If you love the Penguins, then this would probably be 4-5 stars.",1323648000,,300,4.189655172413793
4687065,5,B005G1731M,"Got this for my husband for Christmas and I am so excited to watch it on Christmas Day.  The other Penguins Christmas DVD only has one cartoon on it, but this one has several episodes.  So make sure you compare the two and get this one... a much better bang for your buck!",1323302400,2,272,4.113207547169812
4687066,5,B005G1731M,"The Penguins continue to entertain adults and delight children.  Great video and a great "" stocking stuffer"" for a gift on Christmas.",1322179200,3,133,5.045454545454546
4687067,5,B005G1731M,"Must say that I have enjoyed all the Penguins DVDs so far (I don't have cable so I can't watch them on TV).  I have not watched the DVD yet, but think I'll enjoy it.  I looked all over the web before I finally found a copy locally, NOBODY had any episode information...

Here's the episode list:

The all nighter before Christmas (23 min  spelled out as ""Christmas"" on the menu even though the box says Xmas)
The lost treasure of the golden squirrel (23 min)
The Hoboken surprise (23 min)
Miracle on ice (11 min)
Wishful thinking (11 min)
Operation: Good deed (11 min)",1319673600,50,568,4.371428571428571
4687068,5,B005G1731M,This was so funny. I loved every episode. Penguins Of Madagascar goodness and a great contribution to anyone's holiday collection.,1319068800,4,130,5.55
4687069,1,B005G1731M,"I bought this for my kids as a pre Christmas gift to watch as a family before the holidays. The ""movie"" did not live up to our expectations. It's 1 short holiday episode followed by additional episodes. It's false advertising. Not worth the $11. We probably won't watch again.",1387152000,,276,4.653061224489796
4687070,2,B005G1731M,"I bought this because I love Christmas and wanted to build my Christmas video collection.
I was bored by it and probably will not watch it again.",1383177600,,145,4.407407407407407
4687071,5,B005G1731M,"Now that Nickelodeon no longer seems to be broadcasting the Penguins of Madagascar TV series, I purchased all 8 available DVDs for my family.  This one is fantastic, as are the other seven.  If you and your family are ""Penguins"" fans, then this DVD is a ""must have"".  Total running time is 99 minutes, and the episodes included are: The All-Nighter Before XMas, The Lost Treasure of the Golden Squirrel, The Hoboken Surprise, Miracle on Ice, Wishful Thinking, and Operation: Good Deed.",1368316800,,485,4.890243902439025
4687072,4,B005G1731M,"I thought this was an all Xmas themed DVD, but it seems only one episode had a Xmas theme. THey were great stories nonetheless.",1361404800,,127,4.333333333333333
4687073,5,B005G1731M,We love Madagascar movies so I chose this as a gift for my niece. She was pleased I remembered that she liked the penguins.,1361232000,,123,4.166666666666667
4687074,1,B005G1731M,"This DVD contains only one episode related to Christmas, maybe about 10 minutes.  The animation quality is only TV level, but that was expected.  But marketing it as a Christmas DVD is deceptive.  The rest of the content is mediocre.",1356480000,2,233,4.775
4687075,5,B005G1731M,A fun Christmas with the penguins interacting with Santa Claus.  It is fast paced and enjoyable for kids and adults.,1356393600,,116,4.8

4687078,5,B005G1731M,"This is another great show from the penguins. There are several episodes to make this movie. As always the penguins are cute and funny, great show to watch with your kids and have a good laugh.",1329091200,3,193,4.388888888888889
8471001,4,B005G1731M,I liked it because it had a good message about the importance of working together for the good of all in a project and its purpose.,1529539200,,131,4.076923076923077

8471003,2,B005G1731M,"Although this came at a great price, the DVD does skip and mess up during the movie. It was advertised that nothing was wrong with it so I am disapointed with that, but for the price I guess Ill keep it.",1461628800,,203,3.975609756097561
