8468688,5,B005ELVCFW,"This series surprised me. It would be nice if A&E made the entire Ancient Discoveries series available on disc or via streaming video (without requiring a cable provider). First, the artifacts that are discovered are explored in depth and recreated to see if they actually worked. The results suggest that the Dark Ages were not only a stagnant period of time in the West, but one in which much knowledge was lost and is only now being rediscovered.",1453161600,,449,4.769230769230769

8468692,5,B005ELVCFW,"The History Channel produces some good films and this DVD Ancient Discoveries War in the Ancient World is no exception. However, there was a TV show that I use to watch called Myth Busters were there are experts that reconstructed the various types of weapons or technological to see if they were useful. Most of this film is about various ancient world inventions, engineering ingenuity and very good cutting edge technological advances.  I find this film worthwhile if you are interested how some of our modern day weapons were being developed in the ancient world.",1390521600,4,567,4.968421052631579

Ever wonder about the details of how the Turks conquered Constantinople, or how Julius Caesar defeated the Gauls; these shows will answer your questions. Wonderful resource for history teachers or model makers.

8468695,5,B005ELVCFW,"""War in the Ancient World"" is an eye-opener.  Viewers will realize that military inventions and feats of engineering are often older than commonly thought.  Think for example about the inventions of the landmines, grenades, toxic biological warfare, extreme diving, and fire retardant technology, to name a few.  History mobilizes a wide range of experts in ancient warfare to recreate these military inventions and feats of engineering so that viewers clearly understand how they work.  In summary, History broadens the horizon of its viewers by inviting them to reconsider what they thought they knew about warfare in the ancient world",1322438400,12,637,5.404040404040404
