5672936,5,B00BTKT2QI,Like a visit to the living rooms of some of your favorite new thought and spiritual authors. What a wonderful film. Thoughtful and thought provoking without being preachy.,1365638400,,171,5.142857142857143
5672937,5,B00BTKT2QI,This movie really left me with such a positive attitude and I couldn't stop smiling. I was lucky enough to get an autographed dvd also.,1364601600,6,135,4.44
5672938,5,B00BTKT2QI,"This Move has been a God send. I shared it with everyone in my church. It is not only a good teaching tool, it is a wonderful adventure into the history of New Thought Movement. This shines the light on a Religious Faith that has help shape America. I can't tell you the extensive research that has been presented in this film. IT IS A MUST GET! EVERYONE I HAVE SHARED IT WITH, ALL ORDERED THERE OWN COPY TO SHARE WITH WHO THEY KNEW.",1364428800,,433,4.166666666666667
5672939,5,B00BTKT2QI,"I was excited to see that a film had been made about the history of New Thought philosophy which is commonly considered to derive from the writings of American 19th century philosophers Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau. As a History of Ideas treatment of the various theologians, healers and philosophers inspired by Emerson's and Thoreau's integration of the Bhagavad Gita and other Hindu sacred texts into their own understanding of the Divine, I found it a wonderful introduction. People who are interested in their own spiritual growth, the human potential movement and how many historical figures in history knew each other or were inspired by each others ideas, this is the film for you. I was pleasantly surprised to see my own ministers at the New Thought Center for Spiritual Living in Lake Oswego, Oregon, (Reverend Doctor David Alexander) and the Redondo Beach Center for Spiritual Living in Redondo Beach, California (Reverend Doctor Moira Foxe) participating among those interviewed. The film was very inclusive all the many branches of New Thought and Progressive Christianity. I love to learn about history and think many would enjoy owning this film and showing it to friends or even book clubs for discussion purposes. Thought provoking and uplifting!",1364342400,2,1279,5.213592233009709
5672940,5,B00BTKT2QI,"I was blown away - although I have studied new though metaphysical Christianity since 1997 at Della Deese's UP Church in Los Angeles since 1997 BUT I am relatively new to the Science of Mind aspect (the past 4 years).

I was blown away at the detail in this film - many of the people who were interviewed are teachers/preachers I have studied with or under OR scene or heard of.

I was amazed at how the filmmaker of this project showed the evolution of the movement and how many of those foundering people I had been told about in my studies.

I did not feel overwhelmed by watching the project yet inspired to go out and do and be more - how he strung nature and living life correctly in order to have all the health and happiness you want was amazing.

There is no ""secret"" here just the truth and it is something you and your friends who study truth should buy and watch together and have an evening of discussion or better yet catch the filmmaker on his tour if you can.

He personally proved though the very thought of where can I find this information to the demonstration of this project that there is NO limit to what one person can do - I HOPE he submits to every panel that can give he awards for this amazing work ... DO I HEAR AN OSCAR in the future?",1364342400,2,1263,4.202479338842975
5672941,4,B00BTKT2QI,"This movie I believe captures the scope and inclusivness of the new thought movement as it developed in the United States from it inception until now and represents the evolution of the spiritual concepts which incorporate the spiritual traditions of all times, interviews and tracking of the history. I have purchased a copy to share with all my freinds and family who have questions around the faith tradition I am a part of, speaks clearly to the principals I practice. Well worth watching.",1364342400,9,493,4.951807228915663
5672942,4,B00BTKT2QI,"As a student of New Thought and a program director of a Unity Church I have been waiting for a documentary about New Thought that can be used to give people a well presented introduction and history of new thought. It was also a pleasure to see many of my friends, teachers and scholars I have met throughout the years in the film. Well worth the time to view and share with others.",1364342400,13,382,4.2465753424657535

5672944,1,B00BTKT2QI,I was very disappointed.  From the description I thought I was going to learn about a new concept to help get alcoholics to quit drinking.  I learned nothing.  I was not interested in a history lesson either.,1445040000,,208,4.5675675675675675

5672946,3,B00BTKT2QI,"To be fair, New Thought is not new to me. However the first half was just describing the changes New Thought has gone through the years, and who started these changes. The second half is the only part I found at all interesting because it talked more about what New Thought was. If the full movie was like the second half I would have given five stars.",1428278400,,352,4.268656716417911
5672947,4,B00BTKT2QI,"Excellent movie loaded with useful information on the New Thought movement. My knowledge of Unity was limited so I learned a lot about this branch of New Thought. I would say that this film is a great tool wherever you are on your New Thought journey.

Two glaring omissions, however, are Dr. Joseph Murphy and the mystic, Neville. Dr. Murphy was a Divine Science minister and his book, The Power of Your Subconscious Mind, has to be the biggest New Thought best seller of all time (millions upon millions of copies sold since it was first published in 1963, according to numerous sources). Dr. Murphys work served as my own entry into New Thought and to not mention him is to skip over a very important teacher in this movement.

The Mystic Neville (Neville Goddard) went his own way, to be sure, but his books are still very much available and his influence is as strong today as ever. He is a very important teacher for many of us in New Thought.

For me the omission of these two great teachers was a little jarring. Theyve certainly earned their place in the history of the movement.

All that said, the film is still very good and well worth your time if you have an interest in New Thought.",1428192000,7,1197,4.477064220183486

5672950,5,B00BTKT2QI,"Excellent movie. At 31 years old, I have been raised as a Baptist all my life and for the past couple of months have been contemplating on starting a spiritual journey away from the stale and archaic thinking of orthodox Christianity.  I am currently doing lots of research on New Thought as well as viewing some teachings of it online and am considering doing some ministerial and practitioner studies concerning metaphysics.  I may be visiting a Unity Church in my area soon after viewing this movie in addition to The Secret (2006).  This is definitely a life changing approach to God and spirituality that I will likely embrace after attending but feeling disconnected as a Baptist Christian all my life.",1417651200,5,708,4.883333333333334
5672951,5,B00BTKT2QI,Great explanatory documentary.,1414800000,,30,9.333333333333334
5672952,5,B00BTKT2QI,A good explanation of the New Thought movement from start to present.  Anyone who is interested in freeing their mind and heart and soul from traditional religion and it's control through the belief of original sin should watch it with deep interest.,1413676800,2,250,4.9523809523809526
5672953,5,B00BTKT2QI,Right up my alley spiritually and career wise and gives a great history breakdown! Very inspiring and REAL. It's historical facts match to the history book I am reading on mental healing. Loved this. Just watch it.,1412726400,,214,4.8108108108108105

5672956,5,B00BTKT2QI,"I've enjoyed the documentary. I enjoyed how it also related the parallels of the new thought movement to the Word of Faith Movement. However, I think a more accurate picture of the Word of Faith Movement could have been painted.  The Word of Faith Movement depicted in the the video clip utilized is not representative of the full scope and contribution of this movement. Overall a great documentary and well worth the purchase price.",1405209600,3,434,4.864864864864865
5672957,5,B00BTKT2QI,"It is absolutely excellent.  Loved it and long overdue.  Hope everyone gets to see it.

I have followed New Thought for 40 years and know most of the people in the DVD.

What a joy to listen to it.  New Thought is everywhere.
Swedenborg was the original influence and was a tremendous influence on Emerson and the Trancendentalists such as Thoreau..  Swedenborg was not mentioned in DVD.  Johnny Appleseed was a Swedenborgian and spread the message far and wide.  Famous people were influenced and followed the Swedenborgians, such as Lincoln, especially Jefferson, and FDR and many other leaders.  The list is long.",1397001600,6,616,4.96078431372549
5672958,5,B00BTKT2QI,I ordered another copy to share.  I go to a New Thought Church and it was so interesting to see how it all started and get the background.  We may go to different churches with what you might think are different belief's but we all really belief the same thing - we just express it differently.,1391644800,4,294,4.232142857142857
5672959,5,B00BTKT2QI,"I like having this movie to our new agey collection, though for me nothing will ever TOP the bleep, and then we adored the secret (we were fortunate enough to have a copy that had esther hicks IN the movie)
I knew reading about this movie it wasn't going to blow my socks off
not sure what would at this point!
since I know its ME that puts my socks ON... ha ha ha
anyway  i like that it covers the her/history of what we call ""new"" age anything, as none of this is new unless YOU haven't heard of it
then, when you do it will be new
for a while
then you get to spend a few hundred lifetimes attempting to PROVE it to yourself!
or not as the case MAY be!
I think they did a good job with the movie and I appreciate having it.",1386547200,2,725,3.865771812080537
5672960,5,B00BTKT2QI,I am a teacher of the Science of Mind  philosophy and this just compliments and adds to my teaching base.  The historical aspect of the movie was great.,1386115200,,152,4.392857142857143
5672961,4,B00BTKT2QI,"This was very interesting. New thought is not so new. Nice to get a better understanding of the concepts, their origins and how each one built on those that came before. Very happy with this purchase. Delivery swift, well packaged.",1381017600,,231,4.8
5672962,3,B00BTKT2QI,"It was just ""OK"". Did not feel it was any new information. Delivery was very boring compared to other documentaries I have seen. I would not be inclined to recommend this.",1379980800,,171,4.548387096774194
5672963,5,B00BTKT2QI,"This movie is full of great teachers, information and inspiration.  I have studied under Rev. Della Reese Lett since 2000.  She teaches from a place of her complete love and trust in God.  She also teaches from a place of really knowing that she knows what she knows because she has lived through great highs and lows of life.  I'm blessed to have her in my life, and am so happy that people that can't come to UP Church in Los Angeles get the learn from her here.

Beyond my personal attachment to one teacher in this film, I was extremely impressed with amount of travel the film maker did to cover this subject from all angles.  He was on the east coast and the west coast, up in the north and down in the south... even even out to Hawaii.  There is no other film as diverse and inspirational as this film.  Go ahead and order extra copies for gifts because you're going to want to share this after you've seen it.",1379116800,,917,4.2601156069364166
5672964,5,B00BTKT2QI,"I had the opportunity to watch the DVD through the Eugene, Oregon Center for Spiritual Living.

The information was much more than I anticipated. I have studied spiritual works for 35 years. What I most enjoyed about the movie is seeing all the connections of how one thing led to another and where the teachings originated from.

I can highly recommend this movie for anyone who wants a deeper understanding of the Law of Attraction, New Thought, and living a more spiritual life.",1377993600,,481,4.783132530120482
5672965,5,B00BTKT2QI,"The movie is filled with historic information about the New Thought movement and as it must follow, Unity.
I learned a great deal, and was moved by the assurance that my gratitude for the principles and beliefs as expressed in the movie convinced me that I made the greatest choice in my life by walking into the doors of NTUC some 25 years ago!

I would hope that anyone who views it will be spiritually moved by this wonderful presentation!",1376611200,3,442,4.525
5672966,5,B00BTKT2QI,I know Jon and some of the musicians and ministers he interviewed for this movie.  I was even there for some of the footage he shot.  Both my mother and I are students of New Thought and enjoyed how this movie was put together.  It is great for those new to New Thought and those who have been in it their whole lives.  I am so glad to own this movie.,1375660800,2,351,3.9014084507042255
5672967,5,B00BTKT2QI,This movie quickly and clearly explains new thought.  It is very interesting and entertaining.  I have read a lot about new thought over the last couple of years.  It would have been very helpful to watch this movie first. It was very helpful to watch it now.,1373932800,,259,4.468085106382978
5672968,5,B00BTKT2QI,"""What Is New Thought"" is an expertly produced overview of the influence and impact of New Thought in our world.  In addition to the great work all of the Schools and Ministries of New Thought are doing, the film has captured some of the ways New Thought has, and is, influencing the family of humanity.  Moving toward planetary peace and well being for all.

5672969,4,B00BTKT2QI,"How does one compile an average of 120 years of history on three separate organizations (primarily) and movements within a 90 minute time span, plus explain the origins, plus inadvertently becomes both a prequel AND a sequel to another best selling DVD, The Secret?  For many people, who'll look at this question at face value, they'll immediately conclude that such a task cannot be done.  However one of the main premise of those who follow New Thought is that the ""impossible"" becomes ""possible,"" and it can indeed be done.

Miller has taken a monumental task of compiling and documenting a movement dating back to the Transcendental period in the mid-1800s to its current spiritual, psychological, and philosophical incarnation, all within a timeframe of under 90 minutes.  It is no secret that each of the three main organizations alone(Divine Science, Unity, Religious Science aka Center of Spiritual Living) covered could've easily taken the entire 90 minutes as well as each sub-topic covered.  (Law of Attraction, influences on New Thought, Music, Prayer, how New Thought influenced 12 step recovery programs, self-help and the personal development industry, other religions)

4/5 Stars as the film excluded contribution from the Ethnic-American sector of the movement.  Yes, there were a significant amount of African American panelists included in the film, however the discussion of contributors such as Neville, Rev Ike, and Johnnie Colemon were significantly absent.

So let this be an introduction and an answer to those who question whether or not The Law of Attraction fits their religious and/or spiritual belief or let this present themselves to people who declares themselves ""spiritual but not religious.""  Heck present this to those disillusioned with religion altogether.  This may bring a source of hope to them.",1372118400,2,1836,5.34375

5672971,5,B00BTKT2QI,I thought it was really well done. I have been involved in New Thought for 30 some years and was very interested in the beginnings. My on going prayer is that more people open their minds and think.,1371859200,,198,4.2368421052631575
5672972,5,B00BTKT2QI,"I purchased this movie for showing and subsequent placement in the lending library of our Science of Mind community in Sylva, NC.  We Loved It!  Many attended the viewing and discussion that followed and it is a movie I believe I will use in Foundations-level classes.  It is rich and full of great information.  Both of the times that I have viewed it, it has brought me to tears of appreciation for our teaching and for New Thought!

5672973,5,B00BTKT2QI,"This movie, What Is New Thought?, provided me an historical sweep of the origins of what is known as New Thought that left me with an appreciation of the vitality of the philosophy and the different rivers and tributaries that contributed to its growth in the past two centuries.  Having come from a fundamentalist Christian perspective of religion, finding New Thought at this stage of my personal pilgrimage, I understood and am practicing the core understandings of New Thought, but until this movie I had not yet understood all of where it came from.  It was a real pleasure to be introduced to the sweep of numerous thinkers and teachers who paved this road, and this movie made not only the sweep of the movement more clear but provided me with many more teachers from the past two centuries to study.  I will need to re-watch this, but I can appreciate how much deeper this river runs now that I have seen this movie.",1371427200,,924,4.621951219512195
5672974,5,B00BTKT2QI,"This was a fantastic explanation of new thought through the eyes of its many current leaders from all sides of the current New Thought spectrum.  It provides a good history of the development of New Thought and explanation of what I would hesitantly call the ""theology"" since New Thought doesn't really focus on a ""Zeus""/God in the Clouds with a rulebook approach to living a spiritual life.

The documentary provides a rich resource into the history of the movements transcendentalist roots and shows how widespread it has become within North America.

This film has done an excellent job at doing just that!! From the birth of New Thought and its relatively small number of participants to the far corners of the planet where New Thought's influence can be seen and felt, this film guides you through the archives of this philosophy, spiritual practice, and way of life.
