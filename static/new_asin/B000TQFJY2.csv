8210335,4,B000TQFJY2,I watched this video when I was first starting out with showing and had no idea what I was doing. The video was very helpful in showing me what would be expected in the ring and how to train the horse to do it. I would recommend it to anyone who is showing showmanship weather for the first time or the 100th.,1214352000,,309,4.0
