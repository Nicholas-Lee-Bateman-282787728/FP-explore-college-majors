2484778,4,B000E31QZQ,"This review is specific to Vina Distributors ""Charlie Chaplin Special"" featuring ""the Kid"" ""A Day's Pleasure"" and ""Sunnyside"".  [[ASIN:B000E31QZQ Charlie Chaplin Special Featuring ""The Kid"" ""A Day's Pleasure"" ""Sunnyside""]  Earlier reviewers have done a very good job of discussing the plot of all three movies so I won't waste time recapping a plot or gag sequences. Suffice to say the films themselves are generally considered some of Charlie Chaplins best and ""the Kid"" is on the National Film Registry. This DVD is suitable for people who are new to silent movies even though it contains a few flaws.

The Good:  I gave this version four stars for the very high quality of the video. The graphics are crisp and clear, with very few of the white spots, lines and burn marks that plague many of the old silents.  From a small production house I was surprised at just how good the quality of this video was.  I don't know if Vina did the restoration work or not but it was decent. Anyone who collects silent films knows this can be something of a crap shoot.  Since silents are the only films routinely found in the Public Domain many small companies looking to make a quick buck, will recycle old 8 and 16mm films or bootleg versions of someone elses DVD with predictably bad results.  Moreover, even if using original prints, many of these films are nearing their 100th birthday & have become seriously degraded due to the use of unstable film stock.  Many old movies desperately require restoration.

The Not So Good:  For the Kid the score the orchestral score doesn't quite follow the action, although it is ok. The Music for Sunnyside and A Days Pleasure is a collection of jazz tracks with an occasional shouts, wolf whistles, or cat calls. The score does not utilize an original movie house organ or an orchestra.  The tempo is generally appropriate, but not at all original to the movie. Overall the music just adequate hence I downgraded this version by one star. Considering Chaplins stature at the time of filming, original musical scores are available and should have been used by a company wanting to be taken seriously in the Silent Movie Business. In the case of these three movies; Chaplin himself may be the culprit.  He took several of his movies on the road in the early 1940's and these are three of the movies he was known to re-edit, string together, and rescore.  He shouldn't have, Anyone who has compared the 1942 edit of the ""Gold Rush"" with the 1925 version can see he got it right the first time. He could play the piano, but he wasn't a composer of note.  Unfortunately, I can't tell if these are the movies that have been re-edited, although that would account for the high graphic quality.

A note on movie music.  Even though they are called ""silent movies"" they were anything but. In the silent era's there was always a musical accompaniment to any film. In a large city, such as New York, the movie could often be seen accompanied by an full orchestra.  In smaller venues a lone theater organist or pianist would take over the chore although they were no less important to audience.  One of the problems with modern silents is that the printers (I won't dignify them with the term ""Producer"") slaps on any available music at hand.  One dismal example even used the James Bond theme.  The problem with this approach is that music is the soul of a Silent Movie.  An original score had musical tones which mirrored action on the screen, such as a snare drum for a kick for example.  When random music is applied, the viewers visceral response to the action on the screen is lost. I have been known to rate a DVD with poor music at one star because of music's hig overall importance to the viewing experience.

Good Copies of the Kid are hard to come by.  There are many worse than this, I have purchased a few. Warner Home Video aka Mk2 has the Kid available for an extra $40.00 or so without the two extra movies ""Sunnyside"" or ""a Day's Pleasure"" which are two of my favorites; this collection is a good choice for someone on a budget (me).  A French Company, Flicker Alley is apparrently restoring Chaplins films to original condition, a project which very much needs to be done, but hasn't tackled these three yet.  As a rule before purchasing this or any copy of a silent movie, read the reviews carefully first or you could find yourself sorely disappointed.",1345939200,6,4395,4.63741935483871

i am not a huge fan of chaplin, for me keaton reigns supreme, however the movie ""the kid""
is by far one of, if not the best work chaplin did in my opinion...at least it works for me.",1330905600,,235,3.8958333333333335
2484780,4,B000E31QZQ,"A Day's Pleasure:
Although Chaplin hadn't yet perfected his cinematic timing and pacing, that doesn't detract much from the joys of this Chaplin short. A few sequences go on a bit long but the opening sequence in particular is a gem.

Sunnyside:
A ""routine"" Chaplin short. Which means a lot of clever bits but without the snappier editing and attention to story of his best films.

The Kid:
This may be my favorite Chaplin film. It doesn't have the depth of his later films but the brilliant timing and trust in the audience to understand subtle cues already infuses Chaplin's first feature film, a film which also catapulted Jackie Coogan to preeminence as cinemas first child star. And Coogan set the bar very high for the child stars who followed.

The cinematic purity of this film, which simply tells a touching story superbly well without trying to shoehorn in a message or statement, is something I find refreshing 90 years later.",1323993600,,937,4.807453416149069
2484781,5,B000E31QZQ,"The ""official"" DVD release of Chaplin's THE KID is currently out of print but this budget dvd (which slightly predated the major release) is still around.  The legendary silent movie comedy genius stars in  one of his most famous feature films (which introduced the adorable toddler Jackie Coogan who went on to become the most popular child actor of the day) coupled on one disc with two of his best later comedy shorts.  The print quality is excellent with THE KID a bit soft at times but still very clear; Chaplin's major works have always been lovingly preserved so it's not hard to find really nice prints of most of her later titles that have fallen into public domain.  The musicial ""score"" to the two shorts consists of jazz instrumentals from the period fairly well matched to the film action;  THE KID's score is uptempo classical music.  You might be able to find this release at a dollar store as I did a few years ago, if not ""new and used"" dealers at Amazon have it generally much cheaper than the ""list"" price Amazon is asking.  Obviously the most serious of Chaplin buffs will prefer to get the official release but this budget release is a fine introduction of The Little Tramp to new fans in the 21st century.",1254614400,9,1227,4.575342465753424

8104579,5,B000E31QZQ,"I never thought I'd be writing a review of a silent movie.  I've just watched this dvd and loved it especially the MUSIC.  It is original to the time of filming and very upbeat. What I have found with other copies of these short subjects is that the music changes with the distributor.  This Vina product has the best music which suits perfectly the film which it inhabits.  Charlie captures the mood of the comedy with the outrageous New Orleans jazz complete with shout outs from various members of the band while the music just cooks.  For me at least it captures a lot of what comedy is supposed to be and I find ""the little fellow"" as much a hero as anything current.",1375660800,,672,4.387096774193548
8104580,5,B000E31QZQ,Charlie Chaplin and the young actor made an excellent pair.  For a silent movie you didn't need to be a talking film.  The emotions and acting was excellent.  It brought me to tears and full of emotion...,1373414400,,204,4.45945945945946
