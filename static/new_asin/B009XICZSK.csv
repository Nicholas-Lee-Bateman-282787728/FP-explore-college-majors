8545027,4,B009XICZSK,Well plotted and acted.  Kinda a black comedy.  Enjoyed it.,1492992000,,59,4.8
8545028,4,B009XICZSK,Leave it to the Koreans to add some unusual things what would otherwise be a typical revenge movie. Stick with it because its not the movie described in the synopsis and you're in for a few surprises. There is a fair share of blood & violence but it seemed to fit nicely with the storyline. Its not realistic nor entirely believable but the creepy hospital made it all the more atmospheric and since when are movies like this suppose to be believable?,1491609600,2,451,4.512195121951219
8545029,2,B009XICZSK,Did not like the plot..,1461024000,,23,3.8
8545030,5,B009XICZSK,"It was great all the way around.  The story, the plot, the acting, the ending.., it can be pretty bloody at times, but with good reason.  It was worth watching through all that.  The disease of the mind can be really out there.",1447977600,2,227,4.232558139534884
8545031,3,B009XICZSK,"Very nice. The build-up pulls at you and the final 15 minutes with that driving music wailing away is intense. The hospital almost seems haunted with dread. My only complaint is a big one,it could never happen in a 21st century hospital. If they could have dealt with that reality I would have given it 4 stars. But it's still a good revenge flick.",1419552000,,348,4.453125
8545032,4,B009XICZSK,"This is another story. Scene after scene it will continue to tell a story which slowly unwinds bit by bit. It was worth staying with even though it is not a typical woman's story. I watched it as if hypnotized at times. It is brutal, it has some funny moments, but they don't last long. It takes a weird twist part way through. Who will win? Who will lose? Watch it. It is spellbinding.",1401753600,3,386,4.22972972972973
8545033,3,B009XICZSK,Slow but good. If  you  can make it past the first half hour you will be pleasantly surprised. Good Movie,1400025600,,105,4.2
8545034,4,B009XICZSK,As with most Asian Horror Drama interesting plot.  The dynamic between the two enemies was great to see how it unfolded.,1395446400,,120,4.714285714285714
8545035,4,B009XICZSK,"I wasn't sure what to expect from the little preview write-up but I love foreign films, I love Asian horror and thrillers so why not.  This movie at times seems to drag a little, seems to be a little confusing and then is a LOT of oh my once all the loose ends are tied up.  I do recommend this for fans of the genre.",1394668800,,317,3.8615384615384616
8545036,5,B009XICZSK,"The description doesn't really do this film justice.  It sounds like just another kill or be killed movie, but don't be fooled by that.  There is certainly an element of that, but it is also laugh out loud funny at times.  Almost the entire movie takes place in one room, and the interaction between the two men is great.  We really like Korean films for the subtleties and plot twists and the way they can interject humor into completely unexpected places.  This one did not disappoint.  If you are a huge fan of American movies, you may not have an appreciation for this.  But if you have a thing for Asian movies, as we do, I highly recommend it.",1387497600,12,649,4.4033613445378155
