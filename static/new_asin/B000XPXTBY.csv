8229050,4,B000XPXTBY,"The plot: A man and a woman are having dinner together in a restaurant. They have been together only briefly, but each seems to falling in love with the other. She excuses herself to use the restroom, and, while she is gone, a man at a nearby table begins to talk to the first man. It seems the second man has overheard the conversation and wants to sell the first man love insurance.

This movie is short, only ten minutes, and it's just about the right length for what is essentially a single joke. But the joke is well done. The insurance provisions include such things as cooking for the person whose mate has left and even providing a ""loaner"" (e.g., a stand-in girlfriend to help the newly single man adjust).

The cast is dead on perfect, and the film is funny. I don't know that it would stand up to repeat viewings, but I enjoyed it the one time I saw it.",1200528000,2,864,4.294478527607362
