bad score is so bad that it distracts from what is already a badly sub-standard attempt to tell a story. Technical issues
abound on the DVD... What else could go wrong? A complete waste of money and time.
Don't bother!!!",1399766400,,355,4.933333333333334
8243574,2,B000KF0NDE,"I started watching this rental online through Amazon Prime, and while this may well be an interesting film (I) stopped watching it 10 minutes in as

*** it is all spoken in a foreign language and there are no English subtitles available (no subtitles at all) ***

(you'd think that would've been mentioned in the video information somewhere) ...and since I only speak English I decided not to continue.",1345593600,,402,4.811594202898551
8243575,1,B000KF0NDE,"I was very disappointed with this movie and I owe all to the seller. Albeit I was expecting a low-budget movie, I was not waiting to see this movie been interrupted by editing problems.

The movie stopts at two different times and goes to a blue screen where you can read details of the copying or burning process.

The plot was OK. A little bit inconsistent at times. But what really threw me off was the quality of the copy.",1234742400,3,426,4.3125
8243576,4,B000KF0NDE,"1888 is a creative plot in which Jules Verne lived his own adventure in the Orinoco River in Venezuela and then he wrote ""The Mighty Orinoco"". The beauty of the landscapes and the powerful presence of the river as a character in the movie create a relaxed atmosphere that gives to the plot a perfect frame
I really enjoy this movie!",1199750400,3,332,4.459016393442623
