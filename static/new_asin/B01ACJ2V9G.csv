7598782,5,B01ACJ2V9G,"This is a MUST-SEE video for anyone who is touched by substance abuse disorder from the friends and families of loved ones, to counselors and the even policemen/woman. Dr McCauley explains the science of addiction in laymans terms. He explains punishment doesnt work and long-term recovery programs are a necessity for success. Its a safety program thats been implemented with much success with two professions, pilots and doctors. It needs to become a standard of treatment for the masses. 10-day, 14-day, 28-day (basically revolving door) rehabs just don't work.

Thank you Dr McCauley for sharing your own story and re-affirming that addiction does not discriminate and shame should not be part of this disease.",1459123200,2,714,5.2631578947368425
7598783,5,B01ACJ2V9G,"Anyone who loves someone with a drug or alcohol problem should watch this film! As the parent of a young person with an opioid addiction, I have felt frustrated, confused, terrified and completely lost trying to navigate through the world of his drug use where punishments, short-term treatments and relapses have spun him and our entire family in all directions. This film FINALLY helps me to understand why all of this was not working, and the real supports for recovery that were missing.  This movie also shows what is actually working for many people who are doing what seems to be the impossible... living in long-term recovery and achieving great accomplishments in their lives.  I now have much more hope that this is possible for my son someday too. I wish that I had watched this years ago!",1458950400,3,800,4.7898550724637685

7598785,5,B01ACJ2V9G,"Wow.  Last night it was my pleasure to view Kevin McCauleys new film, Memo to Self: Protecting Sobriety with the Science of Safety.  What a great resource this is going to be for people in early recovery.

Over the years Ive heard Kevin speak a couple of times about the Disease Model of Addiction, and he also shared some details about his own recovery journey. Its a compelling story and I was delighted to see him talk about it in the film. Its important for people to understand that Kevin, Dr. McCauley that is, is a trained MD who was once a flight surgeon in the US Navy. His story is testament to the fact that addiction can, and does, happen to anyone regardless of upbringing, education or even intellectual understanding of addiction. It happened to him, and what hes learned as a result is now a gift for the rest of us.

In his film Kevin shares his journey, his fears, stumbling blocks, and the many big things that were at stake if he could not maintain sobriety. He shares with us the wisdom gleaned from others along the way, and the recovery management tools he developed as a result.

Memo to Self is a pleasure to watch. As viewers we become privy to the teachings of an accomplished physician and addiction specialist, who is also the patient. The resulting takeaway is not only greater understanding of the disease of addiction, but also a treasure trove of tools from one who has applied them.

This is a must-watch for those recovering from substance use disorder, their families, and the counselors and therapists who help them.",1454371200,10,1553,4.608695652173913
7598786,5,B01ACJ2V9G,"Very well done! It explains many question we had, and provides great insight into how to maintain sobriety in a realistic and pragmatic way. Thanks to Dr. McCauley!",1453680000,,164,4.892857142857143

7598788,5,B01ACJ2V9G,"Wonderful work. Kevin McCauley beautifully weaves together his own experience, brain chemistry (for lay people), Navy protocol, fascinating interviews, and gorgeous scenery. The result is a very entertaining and very useful work. One believes that the Navy's checklist approach for pilots (excuse me ... aviators) can work for others. Recovery is hard. McCauley makes it a little easier.",1500508800,4,387,5.689655172413793

7598790,5,B01ACJ2V9G,"In ""Pleasure Unwoven"", Dr. McCauley settles once & for all the question of whether addiction is a disease by medical definition... IT IS!
(My ab-fave point was his revelation of the Periodic Table of Addictive Elements, which he apparently created!!)
In this incredible sequel, he shares his personal experience with addiction more fully, tells us of a 50-year-long addiction treatment program that can boast an incredible 85-95% success rate for getting addicted pilots, doctors & college students through 5 years of abstinence-- which is now known to be that Golden Point on the addiction timeline, where their likelihood for life-long sobriety is all but assured.
Most importantly, Dr. McCauley spells out clearly the 10 elements required for a personal addiction recovery plan which is all but GUARANTEED TO KEEP YOUR ADDICTION AT BAY FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE!!!",1496966400,4,867,5.244604316546763

7598803,5,B01ACJ2V9G,"I did not think it was possible to top ""Pleasure Unwoven.""  But Dr. McCauley and his team have definitely done so with ""Memo to Self""!  Before purchasing the DVD, I was a little concerned that it might just be a repeat of Pleasure Unwoven.  I am happy to report that it picks up where that DVD left off and gets into the meat of the journey of recovery.  I especially appreciate Dr. McCauley's frankness about his own addiction and the path he traveled (with multiple relapses) to his own recovery.

There is something about the beautiful scenery and Dr. McCauley's frank and sometimes humorous approach that really resonates with me.  Watching this DVD has given me additional resolve to continue ""trudging the road of happy destiny"" to finally reach the promised land of HAPPY recovery.  It just seems to make all the ""work"" of recovery more ""worth it.""

I cannot say enough good things about this approach to our illness and totally recommend it for anyone who is addicted or anyone who knows and/or loves someone else who is addicted and cannot understand our strange behavior (""Why don't they JUST QUIT?"").  Thank you so much, Dr. McCauley, for this magnificent update and source of solid information and hope!",1480982400,13,1215,4.802884615384615

7598811,5,B01ACJ2V9G,"An excellent sequel to Pleasure Unwoven.  I work as a therapist with chemically dependent patients in a hospital setting, and this video is receiving as good or better a response than Pleasure Unwoven.  People are very interested to learn more of Dr. McCauley's personal journey as well as the most current information about the science of addiction and the challenges of recovery.  He is a wonderful writer and presenter which makes the video easy to watch.  This video does an excellent job of illustrating the psychological challenges faced by people who have become addicted and yet it offers tremendous hope.
Well done, Dr. McCauley!!",1470096000,7,639,5.115384615384615
7598812,4,B01ACJ2V9G,I believe he is right about the approach with safety versus punishment.  It would make it easier for more people ask for help as well as take away some of the stigma attached to addiction.

7598816,5,B01ACJ2V9G,"We viewed this with my local family group in preparation for Dr McCauley's visit. I found this documentary both informative but more importantly hopeful. Insight from someone who is both in the medical field and has also experienced both the terrors of addiction and recovery is a positive message for both people in recovery, and the family of those suffering from addiction. Dr McCauley uses such strong examples to teach people about the various concepts r/t addiction. I particularly love the Swiss Cheeses Model- this is not the first time I have heard that but I have not heard it used with addiction treatment before.

I would highly recommend this film for those suffering with an addiction, in recovery, family member and health care provider. I hope we can incorporate these strategies into our community.",1459468800,3,815,5.037037037037037
8747061,1,B01ACJ2V9G,I have been showing Pleasures Unwoven to patients and families for years so trusted Memo to Self would be an updated version of that. In my opinion movie is very cheesy and just a dumbed down version of the first. Return it.,1534118400,,224,4.357142857142857

8747063,5,B01ACJ2V9G,"I have been watching Memo to Self by Dr. Kevin McCauley, and found the following very interesting:

For the past 40 years both the Navy and Commercial Airlines found that offering a punishment free and self reporting program for pilots to recover from alcohol addiction led to a 92% abstinence rate during the monitoring period and an 85% lifelong abstinence rate. These numbers are much higher than programs involving punishment. Pilots struggling with addiction were temporarily removed from flying until they established a strong recovery plan. They returned to the air with careful monitoring, and then were free to continue flying without any damage to their career. This program came from the Navy and Commercial airlines choosing to reject a zero tolerance worldview of addiction in favor of seeing addiction as a systemic safety issue. These programs use the pilots' passion for flying as a motivator instead of punishment. Creating a culture of safety acknowledges that there is vulnerability in recovery for both the addict and loved ones. However, without vulnerability and risk management recovery cannot happen.",1526169600,3,1124,5.350282485875706

8747066,5,B01ACJ2V9G,"For those who have recovered or who are attempting to recover from addictions, Kevin McCauley offers his own life learnings on how to learn and succeed. He explains what is happening in our brains and how to build defense mechanisms against potential relapse.

Kevin is also very honest and human. He relates his personal experience in overcoming addiction and lets us know that he was not perfect when he tried to get clean either.

What he shares that is most important is that through persistent, organized effort, we can move beyond addiction into a better life. Then we may have insights that can assist others who are still struggling.",1517097600,,641,4.871559633027523
8747067,5,B01ACJ2V9G,Excellent information in simple terms for recovering addicts.,1509926400,,61,6.75
8747068,4,B01ACJ2V9G,"While this film is impressive, as far as the insight in addiction and recovery goes, it only touches very briefly on the discrepancy of availability of support in recovery. Mr McCauley admits that he has shown high income cases (that includes college /university students!), but the real issue of a profit-oriented health ""system"" that bars a vast number of addicts from proper long-term treatment is not mentioned, at all. Yes, recovery is possible, and it is absolutely amazing how thousands and thousands of the less privileged addicts are demonstrating that in AA and NA, but the numbers could be much higher if the professional support and treatment were affordable for all.
I work as a Peer Recovery Specialist, in a detox unit, and we just are forced to cut our capacity from 16 beds to eight beds, because of funding problems. Recovery Houses are popping up everywhere, which is great for those who can afford it.
As long as the $ rules the health system, addicts will keep on dying, unnecessarily. I am glad that a beginning has been made to get away from the insane and pointless ""war on drugs"", but this, so far, is still only the beginning to step away from 100 years of stubborn failure.",1507852800,4,1200,4.746411483253588
