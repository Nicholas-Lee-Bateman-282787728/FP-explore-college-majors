Set in New York City and London it's a bit of a twist on Cinderella meets Princess Diaries. Absolutely enchanting and incredibly funny.

I won't discount that she probably had real demons to deal with and she may have made some bad choices later in her career, but jeez, ya know?  I just wished she hadn't succumbed to the travails that affected so many others of her contemporaries.  I'm glad her life seems to be coming back on track with her design interests...but I'd have loved to see her grow into actor that I thought she was going to be.",1473638400,,646,4.322314049586777

1895371,5,B00009XITR,"This movie is meant to be fun, but it's not as superficial as some might think. It makes us laugh at the superficial bull, in which we can get caught. For women it's the perfect perception: beauty and the control it promises. For men, it's wealth, power, dominance and control. Each character has to make choices and to manage opportunities, expectations and consequences. I have always loved Firth's acting and characters, but I have newfound respect for him; a seemingly frivolous role with great potential. He thoroughly grounded the film. That took guts. It's a family flick, focusing mainly on women. Happy women avoid the cow dung, while the unhappy ones can't seem to free themselves from it. There is a viewpoint among women that although eccentricity is a great way to avoid the vultures, it often requires wealth and social clout. I hope people don't misinterpret the comedic backdrop of the royalty, who have both. The reality is those characters graciously avoid the vultures while encouraging the sincere characters, regardless of appearances and gossip. Even when the Princess says that Daphne has come a long way it is true. She went from being thoroughly sheltered from the vultures to taking a prominent place in society without becoming a vulture. It's meant to be one of those light hearted stories that young people will remember fondly when their time comes. It's a shame that the thieves in Hollywood can get away with it, but I'm glad that Bynes, Firth and the rest of the cast did such a great job.",1454976000,,1522,4.857692307692307

1895428,3,B00009XITR,"Released in 2003, What a Girl Wants stars Amanda Bynes as a 17 year-old who travels to London to meet the father she never knew (Colin Firth). Hes of royal blood and has great political aspirations, but his long lost daughters arrival puts a wrench in the situation. Kelly Preston plays her mother while Anna Chancellor & Christina Cole play the mother/daughter vying for her fathers attention in London. Oliver James is on hand as her potential boyfriend and Eileen Atkins has a significant role as the girls grandmother.

Its amazing how easily Amanda carries this film when she was only 16 years-old. Shes fun and has a cute face, but a body that hasn't really developed yet. Christina Cole is effective as her nemesis and Firth is a quality protagonist. The subtext about how stuffy high society Brits need to loosen up with their rigid class consciousness is great, but I found myself generally bored by the proceedings, especially by the time the third act rolled around. The movies solid entertainment, but it didn't do much for me; maybe I just wasn't in the right mood for a film like this. That said, if you're a fan of Bynes or looking for a fun teen adventure flick What a Girl Wants should fill the bill. However, I prefer 2005s Love Wrecked; its simply a more entertaining Bynes movie.

The film runs 105 minutes and was shot in the greater London area with the opening act in New York City.

But, when Colin Firth is in it, and Eileen Atkins adding spark as Firth's gloriously independent mother; when there are flashes of the London scenery you love to see; when some good music pops in occasionally; and when I get to see Colin Firth in tight black sleeveless T, and even tighter black leather jeans, playing a rocking air guitar solo....

1895501,5,B00009XITR,"This is a bit of a chick flick and would probably appeal to teen-aged girls.  I confess I got it because the story line looked good, and reviews said it was clean, and it starred Colin Firth.  I thought Amanda Bynes played her part to the T, and of course Firth did not disappoint either, but I was very pleased with Kelly Preston's performance as well.  A lot of teens would dig a 'cool' mom like her.  In my opinion, this movie merited 5 stars for its clean lines, easy acting and tried and true storyline.

1895534,5,B00009XITR,"I have liked Amanda Bynes for some time now and thus I will watch any movie that the is in. She is really cute and she seems like a nice ""girl next door"". In this movie she plays an American girl who longs to know her absent father. She makes a trip to England and meets him. Things get off to a rough start but they work out in the end. This is a very charming story, but I doubt that it is realistic. If you have a romantic streak in you then you will like this movie.

1895556,5,B00009XITR,"I loved watching Amanda Bynes's character as she took the journey of discovery, finding the father she'd never known, learning a life that was utterly foreign to her, and becoming the bell of several balls.

Yet, in the end, she didn't let the snobbishness of the hangers on affect her.

This was a very enjoyable movie to watch. I'm sure I'll watch it again in a few years.",1393372800,,374,4.485294117647059

1895612,4,B00009XITR,"We enjoyed this movie (again). The lead character is the daughter of a 'hippie' musician mom, so it's not completely far-fetched that she takes off to meet her birth father and the mom doesn't try to stop her - although how she paid for the last minute international airfare and why she even had a passport became matters of deep discussion at our house. LOL  In the end, the teen has to decide if she's willing to change who she is and what she believes in for someone else - even someone so beloved as her father.  And I love that my 12YO dau commented on the ""appropriate clothing"" and the lack of bad-mouthing even in disagreements, and noted that the characters didn't use bad language but ""don't sound goody-goody at all!""",1390435200,,728,4.507575757575758

1895656,2,B00009XITR,We viewed it because my wife was hooked while watching it on broadcast TV and she was not able to finish it.  So we viewed it on Amazon Prime - it was predictable and the acting was not really that natural.,1389312000,,206,4.024390243902439

1895659,3,B00009XITR,"Eminently predictable story but Colin Firth is always a pleasure to watch even when matched with a caffeine impossibly bubbly gauche young actress. Or perhaps he did not have to act much to enact reactions most of us have who are adults. Makes a nice change from the oppressive onslaught of evil, nasty and dark movies which seem to be the main diet today.",1389225600,,356,4.578125

It's a sweet, fun, wholesome movie that I thoroughly enjoyed. Sure, some of the characters (peach and pear?) are ridiculous, but the main characters are more believable,and the emphasis on love between parents and their children was refreshing in an era where society seems to want to degrade family relationships in favor of a youth-dominated culture.",1388534400,,488,4.963414634146342

1895753,3,B00009XITR,Colin Firth and a recognizable British cast do a good job.  Amanda is okay.  Plot is very predictable but the film is uplifting and there's no violence; ergo pretty good in my book - especially for a Sunday night.,1382572800,,213,4.435897435897436

Its a very touching story about the two big things a girl growing into adulthood could go through: Figuring out who she is and where she fits into the world. The story is touching, hilarious, and just makes you love the old films.",1380153600,,384,4.065789473684211

1895804,2,B00009XITR,"This movie just annoyed me...this could be because I'm an Anglophile.  Yes, I'm an American, but I prefer the English style. Apparently the American way is best, though, according to this movie, that saying: ""I hope your sleeping arrangements are conducive to""...is improved by shortening it and saying ""Sweet Dreams.""  Why of course sweet dreams is preferable--if you're a simpleton.  It's Disney if you ask me.  Yes, this is another princess movie.  Watching Colin Firth and the other Brits is the only saving grace.  Casting the English as the ugly (not ugly in this case, just mean) step sister worked in some way, but our American version of the Cinderella girl, while at least without malice and cattiness, was klutzy and clueless.  She's all about fashion, her appearance, music, magazines, flaunting that slim little figure around because this is what American teen girls are supposed to think about, right?  Is this our ideal?  Is that how we want to be thought of?  The dignified English have been poked fun at too many times.  It's getting old.  How about we poke fun at the American way?

I am not into teenage movies, but when this girl's antics started, I have to say it was one of the funniest movies I've seen.
She's creative to say the least.  Another good thing, this movie is very clean and wholesome and every scene, no matter how weird it gets seems real with her great acting.  There's one scene I won't forget but I won't ruin it.  I'll just say the strange noises were timely.  he he he",1372204800,,632,4.26890756302521

1895864,4,B00009XITR,"I've watched this movie several times on TV and a few times since I got the DVD. It's a cute movie about the adventure of a teenager (Amanda Bynes) , the daughter of a 'hippie-singer', who runs off to London to meet her father who is a duke. Of course, his mother (her grandmother) and his fiancee' and her daughter don't know anything about his having a daughter. She is invited (by her grandmother) to stay with them and then the fun begins. Naturally there is a scandal (her dad is running for some office in Parliament or something like that. She doesn't quite fit into high society UK style and the fiancee' and daughter want her gone. Meanwhile, she has a London boyfriend and a way of shaking up her stodgy duke dad much to the distaste of his fiancee' and his campaign manager/future father-in-law. Then, of course, the American mom has to come retrieve her and sees the duke for the first time in like 17 years.... a fun lighthearted movie.

But Colin Firth is, well, Colin Firth, i.e., one amazing actor who took what might have been a forgettable, throw-away film and made it wonderful. Amanda Bynes was a ray of sunshine.

This movie IS FANTASTIC, I really enjoy watching it 2 or 3 times a week with my 7 cats snuggled up to me. Some people say I'm crazy, but I really feel my precious kitties understand what's going on in the movie! The only part I don't like was when she was eating Cocoa Puffs.

Someone mentioned it was a ""teen"" flick - I beg to differ - it would be ok for pre-teens maybe, I can't imagine any teenager actually sitting thru it. It was just tiresome and silly. Sad waste of Firth and Pryce. Amanda Bynes' eye-rolling and tripping was old after the first 2 times and just got irratating after that. Can't say there was anything much redemable about it - it was just really bad and this is coming from a big fan of Firth's.",1336089600,6,756,4.220689655172414

1895975,4,B00009XITR,".....a movie just like this that every time it comes on you always manage to watch at least a part of it.  This is not a great movie, some of the casting is questionable, many of the jokes fall flat, the pratfalls are pitifully contrived but for some reason, it all seems to come together to make this one of those movies like Ghost, Mrs. Doubtfire and Dirty Dancing that doesn't seem to have a saturation point in how many times you can view it.  I think the reason it succeeds is due to the story itself.

Daphne, a teenage girl played by Amanda Bynes runs off to England to meet the father she never knew and who never knew of his daughter's existence. Of course, Daddy isn't some average Joe but a Lord who is moving up in the world of politics.  Also included are an evil fiancee and an equally evil soon to be stepsister.  Of course, there is a charming young man she meets along the way.

My only complaint about this movie is that it takes place only a few years ago and  while it can be said that Americans invented rock and roll (some 50 years ago), the ridiculous notion that only the American Daphne can save an otherwise stuffy party by asking the band to play a James Brown song which rescues the party from an otherwise certain bore fest is quite arrogant.  London has rocked and rolled for a long time.

Yes, I guess I can find all sorts of things wrong, but I know the next time I see it on TV, I'll check in for at least a few minutes.",1323907200,,1453,4.17921146953405
1895976,5,B00009XITR,"What a Girl Wants is a delightful love story for the true/hopeless romantic. I really enjoyed this film about love lost and rebuilding broken relationships.  I still don't know how I missed this one in the theatre!  The acting is really superb, especially by Colin Firth who is outstanding, and he and Kelly Preston have such excellent chemistry.  The story has such a good balance of humour and touching moments, and it is very enjoyable with a good message. It also ties up all the loose ends nicely and leaves you with a happy feeling. It sort of reminds me of the Parent Trap a bit as well as Cinderella or the Princess Diaries. The scenes from Britain and Morocco are very nice and add to the cultural flavour of the film.  I also like how songs with such fitting lyrics are used to add to the emotion in the storyline.

In terms of the acting, it is amazing how much Colin Firth can say with his eyes!! It is interesting because in this film we see so many different moods for Henry Dashwood, and unlike his role as Mr. Darcy, Colin Firth smiles quite a bit. He has such a nice smile and actually looks more like his fellow actor and brother Jonathan than I had previously thought (excellent actor too esp. in Victoria & Albert). During this film, because we see so many different sides of the character, I came away feeling that I knew Colin Firth a little better, even though it is about a fictional person.  Kelly Preston is really good as Libby and shows such touching emotion in her role as the woman who only ever loved one man. Amanda Bynes also does an excellent job and she is a great comedic actress.  There are some famous British stars in this film including Anna Chancellor, Eileen Atkins and Jonathan Pryce who also add class and talent to their supporting roles.

Libby Reynolds is a singer who decides to go to see the world and meets Henry, her Knight in Shining Armour, in Morocco. ""They fall hopelessly and passionately in love"" and are married in a Moroccan wedding ceremony. They plan to make it official when they return to London, but his family and advisors get in the way. Henry is a man of Title and with the sudden death of his father, he is Lord Dashwood.  His advisor (Jonathan Pryce) tricks Libby into thinking that Henry wants her to leave, and convinces Henry that Libby leaves because she has another man.  Unknown to Henry, Libby is pregnant with their daughter Daphne. For 17 years Libby and Daphne live in China Town in New York.  Daphne works as a waitress at wedding receptions where her mother's band performs, and she feels sad when she watches the father-daughter dances (I cried during that part) and wishes for that kind of relationship with HER father. Every birthday Daphne always makes a wish that her father will come to find her, but her mother doesn't tell Henry because she is afraid her daughter will get hurt in the same way she did. Daphne always feels that part of her is missing because she doesn't know her father, and so when she is finished high school she goes to London to find him and also finds romance (Oliver James) along the way. Her father is engaged to the daughter of the advisor who got rid of Libby and is starting a political career. Eventually, Henry discovers what his true priorities are, and what he is willing to sacrifice to do the right thing and find true happiness.

I would definitely recommend this film. There are a few mildly offensive words used, but everything else is as clean as a whistle.  The worst for me was the bejesus comment.  However, if you love romantic films, especially with a British flavour, you will love this movie.  It presents hope and that our dreams can be even better than we imagine.",1322870400,3,3699,4.516467065868263
1895977,4,B00009XITR,Enjoyed seeing this older Colin Firth movie and Amanda Bynes as his daughter!  It is charming and entertaining! I would recommend it!,1317686400,,133,5.045454545454546

1895979,4,B00009XITR,"So the film is a predictable clich, but it's so much fun and Amanda Bynes (I just heart her) is just so charming in her ridiculousness.  I swear that she plays the same dim-witted cutie in every film, but it works for her.  She likes to fall a lot, which can get old, but whatever; I like watching her.  She's funny in a way that makes you feel like you've known her for years and `that's just the way she is'.  The story here is a tad `overdone'.  Bynes' plays a young girl who has lived her whole life with her musician mother, longing for the day when she would meet her father.  Her father, it turns out, is a British lord who has no idea she even exists.  So, young Daphne slips out of her mother's sight and high-tails it to Britain to confront her father for some much needed `daddy/daughter time'.  Problem is that her father is about to marry a terrible woman who has a terrible daughter of her own.  If you think that this won't end with a happy ending for all (well, at least for all the good people) then you obviously don't watch that many movies (more power to you) but whatever; it's the getting there that counts and both Bynes and Firth are incredibly charming and wonderful to watch.  Sure, the cinemaphile in me is screaming ""HOW DARE YOU WATCH THIS AND LIKE IT"" but the realist in me embraces the fact that not every movie is going up for Oscars.  This one makes me smile, and that's got to count for something!",1313971200,,1431,4.262962962962963
1895980,4,B00009XITR,"Adjectives for this movie:  Corny, unrealistic, campy, predictable, borderline ridiculous.  It's definitely not a thought-provoking movie.  Basically what happens is, we meet ""Daphne"" (Amanda Bynes) at the beginning of the movie; she's an American teenager who works as a catering waitress and has aspirations of attending college.  However, she feels as though something is missing from her life in the form of her long-lost father, Henry Dashwood.  So, Daphne travels to England to find him, but (whoopsies!) she forgets to bring her brain along (she does, however, remember to bring her memory photo album).  Don't worry, though, because her brain is right where she left it when she returns home again at the end of the movie.

I find the character of Daphne both likeable and annoying -- how she can go through most of the movie with that bubble-brained, vacant look on her face and have other characters chasing after her like she's the greatest thing is a mystery to me.  Colin Firth as Henry Dashwood is pretty much a PG-rated ""Mark Darcy"" (uptight on the surface with a ""fun guy"" deep down).  Eileen Atkins (""Cold Comfort Farm,"" ""Cranford,"" ""Wolf,"" ""Vanity Fair,"" and so many more) plays Jocelyn Dashwood; one would have to wonder what she was thinking when she jumped on board with this one, lol.  Jonathan Pryce is another very talented actor in this movie (smh and wondering WTH?).  And Kelly Preston as Daphne's mother, ""Libby""...well, I guess this kind of movie is actually right up her alley; it's the British actors that really surprised me.

SO MANY scenes in the movie bordered on absurd (climbing the wall of the Dashwood estate, the Royal Fashion Show, the chandelier incident...).  In fact, pretty much EVERY scene in the movie is absurd.  But do you know what?  I actually like this movie -- I don't love it by any stretch of the imagination, but I do like it.  You'll like it, too, if you just watch it and take it for what it is:  FRU FRU, through and through.  It's one of those movies you watch when your brain is on overload; you don't have to think or solve any mysteries or fear for any of the characters...you're not left asking questions when it's over or wondering just happened.  Yes, you'll drop a few I.Q. points, but you can get them back with a good BBC mini-series ;-)",1313798400,2,2306,4.734335839598997

I also thought all the actors and actresses were wonderful. They play some really nice songs in this film. One of my absolute favourites is Have I Told You Lately by Matt Acheson and it fits the scene in which it was played so well. It's one of the best scenes you'll ever watch, if not the best. Another is You Get Me and it's also good for the scene, too, which is also wonderful--Daphne on a date with her boyfriend. How very lovely. There's also a song her boyfriend sings in a party (before a James Brown song). It's called Long Time Coming. Anyway, the guy really sang it so beautifully. Look out for the scene where he and Daphne have their first kiss 'cause it's so romantic. I also love the scene where Colin's character calls her mum to complain about Daphne 's absence, the father-daughter dance, but these aren't the only wonderful scenes. Just do yourself a favour and watch it. You'll be glad that you did. The characters are believable. This is good to watch with your family. Definitely get a copy.",1305763200,2,1145,4.483253588516747

1896045,4,B00009XITR,"When it comes to this film, I am so utterly in the wrong demographics that I feel quite silly putting in my two cents' worth - but here it is, anyway. Sometimes you flip thru channels and stumble on a movie that you somehow end up seeing all the way thru. So, for me and WHAT A GIRL WANTS. Young Amanda Bynes has never really registered on my radar before, but it's hard not to get in her corner when you see her perky self go to work.

Seems like nothing is original anymore. WHAT A GIRL WANTS has drawn comparisons to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Princess-Diaries-2-Disc-Collectors-Set/dp/B000209KMW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Princess Diaries (2-Disc Collectors Set)</a>, but apparently its roots go back further, to a 1958 comedy film THE RELUCTANT DEBUTANTE starring Rex Harrison and Sandra Dee, which in turn was adapted from a 1956 play of the same name by some cat named William Douglas Home. Cinderella, of course, is the grandmama of inspirations for movies like this.

WHAT A GIRL WANTS is fluff fluffity fluff, but enjoyable and the sort of lighthearted, lightweight teen chick flick which the young girl audiences (and I guess, me) gobble up like M&Ms. There's even a touch of that girl-empowerment thing going on. But if you say you can't guess how the plot will play out, then pardon me but my bullcrap detector just exploded. The set-up goes like this: 17 years ago, a young British noble (Colin Firth) and a gorgeous, free-spirited American girl (Kelly Preston) meet and fall in love in Morocco and get married in a bedouin wedding ceremony. He takes her to his posh estates in England, only to have disapproving forces scheme to separate the two. She leaves in tears, he lets her leave. He doesn't know she's pregnant.

Amanda Bynes plays New York teenager Daphne Reynolds who runs away from her single parent mother to seek out her Englishman dad in London. To catch us up, Daphne's father is now Lord Henry Dashwood, currently engaged to be married and a popular candidate in the upcoming elections (and he still doesn't know he has a daughter). So, as you may guess, Daphne's unexpected arrival introduces a wrench in the works, a fly in the ointment, a fart in the wind. Bring on the belles and balls and the anticipated father-daughter culture clash, as the rest of the movie tells of how plucky and sweet collide with repressed and snooty.

What's a story like this, though, without a wicked social-climbing stepmummy or a conniving step-sister? There's even a dashing young Jack-of-all-trades to lend a hand to Daphne, as well as a kindly British grandmum who we sense from the start would have Daphne's back and who ends up with film's best line (that one about hugs). But the real connection is between Amanda Bynes and Colin Firth's daughter and dad characters. It's quite fun watching Daphne gradually begin to have an effect on her stiff upper-lipped father and seeing this portrait of restraint and decorum loosen up by inches. The film's high point for me may well be that scene with Lord Dashwood in tight leather pants playing air guitar in front of the mirror.

Bonus features? The DVD offers the following: two sets of audio commentary, one by the film director and the screenwriters, the other by Amanda Bynes (for those preferring a more, like, youthful testimonial); ""Fashion and Etiquette 101"" - the film's costume designer Shay Cunliffe goes over the cast's wardrobe and etiquette instructor Maggie O'Farrill nags about the proprieties; ""What's A Girl To Wear?"" - a game requiring a good memory for Daphne's outfits (as a guy, I refuse to play this); 3 additonal scenes (totalling 1 minute 39 seconds); the theatrical trailer; and the film cast & crew credits.

WHAT A GIRL WANTS pushes all the right feel-good buttons and rides on the talent and credibility of the cast. Amada Bynes demonstrates an unaffected, likeable quality, nicely balancing her goofy exuberance with pratfalls and even a dash of romance. With her, the stodgy Brits never really had a chance. Equally key is Colin Firth, pitch perfect as the impeccable, uncomfortable Lord Dashwood, who as the film progresses regains that inner cool he had back in his youth, when he listened to rock 'n roll and sported a more hip wardrobe. Firth manages to pull off being simultaneously reserved yet charming. Again. Having seen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pride-and-Prejudice-The-Special-Edition-A-E-1996/dp/B00005MP58/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E, 1996)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Actually-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JMFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)</a>, I shouldn't be surprised. Kelly Preston is good as Libby, Daphne's beautiful Bohemian mom who raises Daphne to be carefree yet grounded; You could see why even after all these years Lord Dashwood still thinks of her. Libby is a wedding singer, which gives Preston a chance to actually sing the songs. She's not bad.

Sappy last paragraph: This film may be tailored for the youngsters, but it doesn't necessarily snub the old fogies. When I told a buddy of mine that I'd seen this movie and liked it, he dismissed the film as fluff fluffity fluff. Obviously, I disagree. There's always a place for charming teen comedy flicks, not only in the hearts of young whippersnappers, but also in the wrinkled cockles of the decrepit. In its predictability and retelling of that same old message (be true to yourself), it doesn't insult our intelligence as much as reaffirm certain values. So I take back what I said about not being in this film's target demographics. With me, the film is apparently spot on.",1235174400,6,5802,5.265945945945946

She is clumsy, loud, but down to earth and, of course, does not fit into the uptight British society.

As you might expect Daphne's outgoing personality and unconventional ways of expressing herself cause an instant stir in the British elite and jeopardize her Father's chances of political success.

Critique: Released in '03 `What A Girl Wants' is a predictable ""chick flick"" that exploits all the expected scenarios and pushes all the right emotional buttons that we've come to expect from this genre of film. Having that said you ask why then does it receive a -5 Star- rating? I can answer that in two words, Amanda Bynes. Nobody lights up the screen like the enchanting and talented Amanda.

1896086,4,B00009XITR,"It really helps to put this movie in perspective if you know a little about the author. William Douglas-Home is the younger brother of Sir Alexander Frederick Douglas-Home, 14TH Earl of Home, Baron Home of the Hirsel of Coldstream, who, in October 1963 (8 years after the writing of the play from which this screen-play was adapted), disclaimed his peerages for life, took the name Sir Alec Douglas-Home, and succeeded Harold Macmillan as prime minister of England. The plot, therefore, is an insider's look at an outsider's view of the traditions, the glamour, and of course, the pain and hypocrisy of the British upper class. As such it succeeds remarkably. Sterling performances by Amanda Bynes and Colin Firth are ably complemented by a truly brilliant Anna Chancellor, who manages almost to make you like her ""wicked stepmother"" character, or at least feel sorry for her for being so shallow, and an excellent backup from Christina Cole as the evil step-sister-to-be.

1896088,3,B00009XITR,"This story is about a teenager named Daphne who is living with her mom in America. Her mom married Henry Dashwood rather young, but when his family found out, she was told he wanted a divorce and he was told that she ran off to America with some guy, but unknown to him she was pregnant with Daphne. She has never seen her Dad, but she knows he lives in London. Every time she and her mom cater at weddings, she hears the father/daughter dance, and wishes she had a Dad she could dance with. So, she leaves a note for her mom and boards a plane for London hoping to find her Dad, with only his name in her pocket. When she arrives at a hotel a guy named Ian befriends her. She looks at the television in the hotel lobby and notices that her Dad is being interviewed on television because he is running for Prime Minister. She looks over at Ian and says,""that's my Dad."" It' s a little hard to get up the nerve to barge into her Dad's life when he doesn't know she exists, especially when she finds out he lives in a mansion with a guarded gate. She decides instead of entering the conventional way, the front door, to climb the wall, and runs into the house unannounced. Of course her Dad takes her for a reporter, and she is cornered in a chair and lectured. Finally she bursts out and says, ""this isn't how I imagined my first meeting with my Dad.""

Now this might very well sound like a harmless and fun story, but I was disappointed in this movie. I expected more character development in the main character. The main character didn't have very good lines. It portrayed her more as a typical American teenager in immodest clothing and she didn't show much restraint in her public behavior. A lot of her scenes showed her dancing in revealing outfits. Colin Firth's acting though was superb. He had some really good lines, and you got to know his character the best. I thought the message that family is more important than worldly success was good,as well as showing that close father/daughter relationships are important, but I was disappointed that it overly emphasized that you should be yourself, whether good character or not. The love story was immature and selfish. The young man did not encourage her in her relationship with her father, but wanted her to himself. All in all I think it was better than average, but communicates some very wrong values for young people.

So, in an attempt to do this she travels to Europe find him.

The chemistry between Bynes and Firth is wonderful and makes the movie all the more enjoyable.

1896096,4,B00009XITR,"My daughter and my wife forced me to watch this movie. Truthfully, I actually did want to watch it because I thought it might be funny and it looked similar to ""The Princess Diaries,"" which I also enjoyed. I was pleased that the movie turned out to be watchable and fun.

Daphne Reynolds is a young woman in New York who yearns to know her father. As she grows up, she becomes more and more distressed by the possibility that she will never have a chance to know her father. After watching a father-daughter dance at a wedding one day, she decides it is time to act.  Off she goes to find him.

Daphne was the result of a romance between her free-spirited mother, Libby Reynolds (Kelly Preston), and Henry Dashwood (Colin Firth), who once was as free-spirited as Libby, but ultimately succumbed to the prim and proper expectations of the British upper class.  Libby was left behind. Unbeknownst to Henry, he left Libby with a gift: Daphne. In case you were wondering, Libby and Henry were legally married in Morocco, though various characters attempt to obscure the legality of that marriage.

Daphne has entered the scene at a very critical point in Henry Dashwood's life. He has given up his hereditary position in the House of Lords to run for elected office. Most especially interested in his success are Alistair Payne (Jonathan Pryce), Glynnis Payne, his fiance, and Clarissa Payne. Naturally all three of these characters want what is best for them and not what is best for Henry. Dahne's free-wheeling ways do not sit well with any of these three characters and they impress upon Henry that to win the election he needs to bring Daphne back under control.

Daphne falls to the pressure of being the daughter of British royalty and becomes the beautiful, dutiful daughter, and adopts a type-B personality demeanor. We all know that Daphne's irrepressible energy and type-A personality will have to win out; remaining the meek, dutiful daughter is not her path.

As with a recent, similar movie, ""The Princess Diaries,"" this movie has a fair amount of predictability, cliche and stereotype. However, as with the earlier movie, this movie too is a winner. The real success in this case is from Amanda Bynes and her interaction with Colin Firth. Colin sees in Amanda the person he truly is, and he sees that he similarly stifled his true character to fit into an expected mold. Amanda has virtually no interest in Colin's position or wealth. She is who she is; her real goal has always been to gain a father, not money or status.

We love Daphne because she is a bit eccentric, but she is all-American, and engagingly normal. We find by the end of the movie that being pretentious should not be a cover for whom or what we want to be. Sure, the plot is contrived, but who cares? It's way too much fun to worry about such trivialities. Enjoy!",1156896000,,2845,4.676

I think I'm gonna start ordering more movies for my wife, because every time I do, I get a rare jewel!  And such was the case again!

This movie is the classic ""fish out of water"" story, the one we've seen a millions times, but when you have a cute teen female, with enough Charisma to get OJ acquitted 10 times over, you know you have a winner. I had never heard of Amanda Bynes, (sorry, I'm not quite yet with the Nickelodeon crowd!) but I immediately wanted to know everything else, Amanda was in, after seeing this movie.

A refreshing ""remake"" of an old classic, The Reluctant Debutante, another movie that I had not seen, or would ever consider putting on my Rental Queue, one that splashes some water on a dry, weathered face of a middle-aged man.

Check out the commentaries, for an interesting explanation of the behind the scenes, etc.  Amanda's overview is a bit ""kiddish"" but that just makes you like her more.  Very charming, and charismatic.

Here's why.  I think the movie's producers goofed with Anna Chancellor's character.  In the original, the stepmother (played by the absolutely wonderful and radiant Kay Kendall, who died too soon and was the premier British comedienne of the 1950's) was, though a social-climbing flibbertigibbet, at heart a decent, good-hearted, well-intentioned woman who truly only wanted to do right by her stepdaughter and had a wonderful relationship with her husband (played by her real-life husband, Rex Harrison).  In the current film, Anna Chancellor, a very fine actress, is misused as a two-dimensional villain actuated by the lust for power at one remove (she wants her husband to become the next Prime Minister and will do anything to achieve that, even if it means being mean to her husband's daughter).

Its about their new relationship and about what is most important in a person's life, relationships... not your career, your status, money, or power, etc.  In this case the relationship between a father and his daughter. It's not a chick-flick (by my definition thats a movie about a romantic love relationsip). This is a great family film for parents and children to see and for all to appreciate each other.

1896112,4,B00009XITR,"""What a Girl Wants"" is a FAIRY TALE (insert ""Parent Trap"" here) so those who do not like that type of story need not watch, but just being a fairy tale is no basis for criticism. It is an updated remake of 1958's ""The Reluctant Debutante"" starring Sandra Dee and Rex Harrison, which itself was based on a 1956 play by William Douglas Home. Home is partially credited with both screenplays although he died in 1992. The basic premise is even older as the humble child who discovers a royal parent is a staple of ancient fairy tales.

The current version is a pretty decent effort, you could even say that it is 2/3's of an excellent movie. It starts off nicely and proceeds in a very entertaining manner well past the midway point. You are just about to conclude that this is an extremely underrated film when the wheels fall off (insert Colin Firth whisking his daughter away on a motorcycle), from that point the film wobbles lamely along until it thankfully recovers its balance just before its final scene.

The only other major problem is the clich Yank-Brit characterizations and the exploitative use of the Royal Family in several scenes. Yanks are fun and funky, Brits are staid and stuffy, most upper class Brits are evil incarnate-with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. You are warned about it going in, this general stupidity is reflected by the promotional poster of an American flag t-shirt between the British guards. The exuberance of Daphne Reynolds (Amanda Bynes) would have played better if the other performances were toned down a few notches. Doubles of and references to the Royal Family are completely unnecessary and simply distract from what is supposed to be a father-daughter-bonding story.

The best scene happens early, Daphne and her mother are working a local wedding when she discovers the missing groom passed out under a table. She puts ice down his shirt and when he emerges frantically twisting around to remove it, Daphne signals her mom's band to play ""Shout"" and then mimics the groom's movements.

I see no basis for the criticism of Amanda Bynes in this film. She plays her high energy self and successfully ratchets back a few notches for the serious scenes. In essence director Dennie Gordon has her play two characters which is the basis of the story's theme as her character must reluctantly conform and work at being someone she is not. Under Gordon's direction and working with a skilled ensemble Bynes nails the character so well that it is hard to image anyone else in the role. She is not on Brittany Murphy's level yet but she progressing nicely. Two similiar scenes really play to her strengths, the fashion runway scene and the grand entrance to the party for Peach & Pear, the film is worth watching just for those moments.

The widescreen edition DVD is a great value as it has some excellent special features including an unaffected commentary by Bynes. They had a lot of audio problems during production and Bynes provides very good behind the scenes information about what the actors had to do to correct this after the actual shooting was completed.

1896118,5,B00009XITR,"Among the current crop of female child actresses already or about to turn into hot properties for their impressive talent and major sex symbols for their knock-out looks is Amanda Bynes.  Its an impressive class that includes the names Keira Knightley, Lindsay Lohan, Hilary Duff and Kristen Bell. But Bynes is one actress who has already reached television stardom through her shows ""The Amanda Show"" and ""What I Like About You"" and at the age of 16 she traveled to Europe to appear in a movie appropriately titled ""American Girl.""

Before it was released (in early 2003) its title had been changed to ""What a Girl Wants"" and I sat there in a movie theater knowing little about it. I knew it had been filmed in my home country and starred Colin Firth who had been so good in ""Bridget Jones' Diary,"" I came away impressed by the comic timing and the looks of an actress that would obviously in years-to-come set movie screens on fire.

""What a Girl Wants"" is at its heart a story about a girl searching to find herself. Bynes plays Daphne Reynolds and her mother Libby is played by Mrs. John Travolta (Kelly Preston). The two live in New York City and Daphne spends her time helping out at weddings where her mother is a singer and longing to know a father she has never met. It is observing the father-daughter dance at one of these weddings (where the filmakers used real fathers and daughters) that our hearts go out to Daphne and she determines a drastic plan of action - traveling to London and confronting her absent father.

The movie has it all - heart, laughter, suspense, romance. Its culture clash theme has been done before and better (Crocodile Dundee for example) but we have so much emotion invested in Daphne's plight that we cannot help but become engrossed in this movie.

Jonathon Pryce proves that his villainous turn in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" was no fluke by pulling out a great performance here as the political advisor of Daphne's father (Firth). Thing is, Firth's character -Henry - is running for political office and Pryce sees Daphne as a liability to his boss' career and her presence an obstacle to his becoming father-in-law to the wealthy and politically powerful Henry.

This DVD has an impressive number of special features, the crown jewels of which are the two scene specific audio commentaries, one by Bynes and the second by the director and two writers.

I Liked how the subtitles automatically come up when commentaries are playing. If you have only seen it once it helps keep track of where you are in movie.

Light, fluffy, exuberant Amanda Bynes chats about working with the other actors, and how intimidated she was by some of the people she worked with. In her commentary she mentions how the weather was when a scene was shot - it was hot, hunid, raining etc

Obviously Bynes has a great deal of respect for Firth and Preston and  almost inevitably Bynes spends a lot of time talking about clothes - big boots when hopping over the wall, commenting on how ugly the dress to a ball is etc. Bynes literally coos over emotional moments.

Hers is a fun commentary, but there are some gaps. I liked the recounting of anecdotal moments such as her account of being mobbed by fans on bridge that crew could not get permission to close for shooting.

On the second commentary director Dennie Gordon joined by the two writers Jenny Bicks and Elizabeth Chandler (the Amazon listing is incorrect in identifying them as actors). As one might expect this is more technical in details and as such serves as a nice contrast to Bynes solo track. The writers discuss such matters as how long they worked on it, the original inspiration and discuss different titles (the original title ""American Girl"" is mentioned on both tracks). The director talks about how wonderful the actors are and seems particularly pleased with Bynes performance.

Overall this is a very enjoyable family film and a great DVD package.",1115683200,45,3937,4.713245997088792

This movie, based upon the play ""The Reluctant Debutante"" follows our intrepid young star in her journey to meet her father, a stuffy British aristocrat, played with Bumbling Stammering Hugh Grantish perfection by Colin Firth, who's really better than the part written for him here. Byrnes and the filmmakers seem to think that staring vacantly, smiling, trying on hats and sunglasses, and dancing around to generic pop music passes for characterization these days. Wrong. This movie is the cinematic equivalent of cotton candy; sweet, lacking nutrition and just plain bad for you. To top it all off the DVD itself is a wreck.

1896136,2,B00009XITR,"It's hard work cramming as many clichs as you can into a film and success isn't always forthcoming, however I'm pleased to announce that in What A Girl Wants the clich level has been maintained to its fullest and it's a rip roaring clich success!

Let's walk through it now...

A little girl named Daphne Reynolds lives with her hippie mother. She is told the tale of how the cool singer (Kelly Preston) met a mysterious hippie (Colin Firth) in Morocco. They were wed Bedouin style and then went to London, where hippie guy lived. It turns out he's next in line to be a Lord and his Dad (the current Lord) just died. Now the Evil Advisor (Jonathan Pryce) gets rid of the new Lord's true love to mould him into a proper English gent and such.

Fast forward 17 years. Hippie girl was pregnant when run off the ranch, and now her daughter, Miss Wayout, wants to find her father. She jets off to London to find him (to strains of The Clash singing London Calling, of course) and it turns out he's a big politician about to be married to some troll from under a bridge. Miss Wayout (Amanda Bynes) arrives and is naturally all teenage and stuff, like, and she doesn't, like, fit in like, you know? Troll (daughter of original Evil Advisor) is trying to get rid of her so she can be the Lord's wife (once he gets into power of course). Unfortunately, Miss Wayout was just what the stuffy English doctor ordered, because all of English society loves her and her zany, madcap adventures. (You can guess the rest if you like, but I'll give it to you anyway).

Aimed primarily at girls between ages ten through 18, this is nothing we've not seen before. Riddled with clichs and awkwardness (Daphne falls over or bangs her head no less than five times) this is a very predictable film with very little to offer as a story (one thing I'd really like to know though, is why these films all promote `being yourself and individual' yet they all tell the same story in the same way? Isn't that a teensy bit hypocritical?)

Anyway, while it has some moments of humour, to me it all smacks like a million other teenage girl films I've watched and by the end I was pretty glad it was over. Kelly Preston is wasted, Colin Firth and Jonathan Pryce are as well, and the supporting cast seem to get most of the screen time. This has also been very loosely based on The Reluctant Debutante, a stage play by William Douglas Home, but I'm fairly sure he wouldn't recognise it.",1103846400,,2449,4.421286031042128

It seemed like everyone was in a struggle. Especially the struggle between Daphne and Clarisa was really exciting because Clarisa was very rude to Daphne but they did not actually fight. It made us laugh. Daphne changed because she wanted to fit herself into English society therefore Ian was disappointed. Finally, Daphne got back to her family and fell in true love with Ian.

Daphne Reynolds (Amanda Bynes) loves living in her apartment in Chinatown with her mom, but she really wants to know who her dad is. Her mom never really tells her, and Daphne still really, really wants to know him. What she does know, though, is that he lives in England. On her birthday, she uses her money to buy a plane ticket to London and plans to meet her dad. When she first arrives, Daphne is a bit overwhelmed.

She meets a few friends along the way (Ian Wallace, the musician, is probably the most memorable), and they all tell her that she has to try to make peace with the fact that her dad is getting remarried to a completely horrible woman with an equally bad daughter. Of course, the movie wouldn't be complete without a few of Amanda's token pratfalls, but for once they're actually pretty funny.

WHAT A GIRL WANTS is definately a cute movie, and it has a killer soundtrack. Highly recommended if you liked The Princess Diaries (one and two), A Walk to Remember, or How to Deal.

I rented this to help round out my personal 'Colin Firth Film Festival', and I wasn't disappointed.  (Colin, paternal sentiments, leather pants and a motorcycle. 'Nuff said.)

I was pleasantly surprised by Amanda Bynes as well.  I'm well past the Nickolodeon demographic, so I hadn't seen more than a few short clips of her work, and those reveal some talent, and a great feel for comedy.  But she does reasonably well with the emotive parts of the film.  As the director's commentary says, there's a lot of acting done in this film with expression, not just dialogue, and Amanda does just fine in this regard.

Something that wasn't mentioned in either commentary, suprisingly, were what I saw, at least, as a couple of subtle nods to Colin Firth's past work (A&E's Pride & Prejudice).  His character's fiancee is played by the wonderful Anna Chancellor, who of course played Miss Caroline Bingley (the rival for his affections) in P&P.  In the scene where Henry is showing off the family portraits to Daphne, he introduces one of them as ""Bingley Dashwood"".  I love little winks like that.

The best scene though (for those of us in it for eye candy of the Colin persuasion) is, of course, when he tugs on those tight black leather pants and...well, you've just got to see it. :)",1095638400,2,1414,4.680161943319838

I missed out in seeing this movie at the cinemas, so of course I got it out on DVD for 3 Days.  I really enjoyed watching it - even despite the bad characters of the story - because it was funny and had a lot of great location shots of England/London and I LOVED the inside of the English ""Palace Rooms"".  Although, this movie doesn't explain much about the British and I can't really understand why the British people don't seem to express their emotions and feelings the way we do.

After I finished watching it, my parents watched it  and they really liked it too.  One of the things that really surprised me and especially pleased my Dad was the Special Guest Appearances by the Queen of England, Prince Charles and his sons  (we got a close-up of his face).

The Special Features on this DVD are 2 documents which can be considered 'making of' features as they play a big part in the movie and have scenes from the movie - they talk about ""the costumes and clothes of the characters"" and ""the importance of manners"", which can be quite handy in some circumstances of meeting such people (like your girlfriend's dad or making food, etc).  I think there's the Theatrical Trailer, but I don't remember exactly.  BUT, I DO REMEMBER A HIDDEN SPECIAL FEATURE:  If you click on the head of the Throne which Amanda Byrnes sits on (I believe in the 'Special Features Menu'), you get to see 2 takes on an audition for the Princess twins Peach and Pear.

1896168,5,B00009XITR,"The first time my college roommate suggested we watch ""What A Girl Wants"", I thought she was crazy. After listening to the plot, I was skeptical - this ""modern-day Cinderella story"" seemed a bit too cheesy to be entertaining. Delightedly, I found it to be quite the opposite. While it will never make AFI's list of Greatest Movies, ""What A Girl Wants"" is a feel-good bit of fun.

 Lord Henry Dashwood (Colin Firth) is the favored political candidate in an upcoming House of Commons election. Serious, charming, and intelligent, Dashwood is the impeccable Englishman, with a London estate, a beautiful finacee, and a brilliant political career ahead of him. That is, until a 17-year old New York teenager named Daphne Reynolds (Amanda Bynes) arrives on his doorstep claiming to be the daughter he never knew existed.

 Daphne has long held a dream of developing a relationship with her long-lost father, and despite his initial reservations, Henry quickly falls in love with his daughter. However, the two are worlds apart. His life is one of garden parties and balls based on lineage and aristocracy; she is an energetic, vintage American teen. And though Henry used to be a loose canon himself, he finds that he must convince his daughter to change so that she can be accepted into his world.

 Though the film does feature the ""wicked stepmother and evil stepsister"", it is mainly about the relationship between father and daughter and the importance of being true to oneself. With an all-star cast, including Bynes, Firth, Kelly Preston, and Jonathan Pryce, ""What A Girl Wants"" is more than mere fluff-it is a feel-good film with a fun plot and a bit of magic. It is, after all, a modern-day fairy tale.",1090454400,5,1706,4.86551724137931
1896169,4,B00009XITR,"If you're looking for a quality movie for people of all ages, stop now. But, if you're looking for some family-friendly fun, you've come to the right place.
  ""What A Girl Wants"" focuses on the life of quirky NYC teenager Daphne, played by Amanda Bynes. Her job as a waitress at weddings (with her mother alongside her, playing in a wedding band) has left her longing to meet her father, whom she knows very little about. Daphne looks him up on the net and flies to England to meet him, but is distressed to discover that he knows nothing about her and has his own busy life. While trying to find out about her father, though, Daphne discovers she has a lot to learn about herself.
  In short, the movie is good, clean fun. It's cute, but pointless. Fans of Bynes are guarenteed to fall in love with the film, as will pre-teen girls. They're also likely to fall for Oliver James, who is very studly as Daphne's love interest; but, if he's not your type, Colin Firth as Daphne's caring-but-emotionally-confused father is dashing, as always. Bynes does a great job, too, adding comedy to this sticky-sweet film and keeping it from being tooo melodramatic and soap opera-ish.
  Overall, ""What A Girl Wants"" delivers. That is, if  you're looking for a popcorn-and-gummy-bears-slumber-party-chick-flick.",1090195200,2,1298,4.81981981981982

2.) So strange young girls can just pop up on your doorstep and claim to be your daughter and no blood test.
3.) A girl 17 years old, I repeat 17 years old can fly all the way to London ALONE and find her father within like two days of leaving.

1896172,3,B00009XITR,"""What a Girl Wants"" is exactly the film for the teens who love Amanda Bynes, or ""what a girl wants.""  It is unashamedly sweet and predictable, but to say so and blame the film for it is pointless, because the film knows the fact.
Interestingly, the film is based on one Rex Harrison film ""The Reluctant Debutante"" (1958), which follows the story of an American girl in English high society.  Like that oldie, ""What a Girl Wants"" is avout a girl Daphne played by Bynes, whose ""single"" mother (Kelly Preston) is a wedding singer.  One day, when Daphne is 17 years-old, she suddely wants to see her real father Henry Dashwood (Colin Firth), who is going to be a MP, and marry a lady (Anna Chancellor, ""Duckface"" in ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"").
No surprise that Daphne causes a havoc in the aristocratic society in UK; and no surprise that she wins the heart of some people there, especially that of Colin Firth and Eileen Atkins.  Well, the director Dennie Gordon's CV includes ""Ally McBeal,"" and the gags are often preposterous, and dialogues impossible, though in a delightful way ... if you're in a good mood.
But the natural charms of Ms. Bynes goes unscathed among the hit-and-miss shots, and certainly the chemistry between Bynes and Firth is undeniable, and compensates the wasted Jonathan Pryce and the ill-used leather jacket and turban Colin Firth had to wear.
I do understand the British people's dismay when watching the film -- it is often gratingly silly, but the Dashwood family (oh, they are really living in the house the film depicted) actually agreed to use the name, so stop complaining, please.  And to American audiences, true, the film is sugar-coated, but when you know it is, you cannot complain that it is too sweet.",1085616000,5,1742,4.754966887417218

1896175,2,B00009XITR,"When Henry Dashwood (Colin Firth) and Libby Reynolds (Kelly Preston) met in Morocco, it seemed like fate. Falling madly in love with each other, they marry and life seems perfect. That is until Henry and Libby through lies and deceptions are separated, Libby leaving for the States while Henry stays on in London. Little did Henry know that Libby was pregnant with Daphne (Amanda Bynes). Now seventeen-years-old, Daphne decides she's tired of waiting for her father and leaves for England, where Henry is now Lord Dashwood and a politically powerful figure setting up a campaign to earn a seat in Parliament. What follows is a tale of how a young girl and her father discover their true selves and find happiness.
Conclusively falling under the category of a 'teen Cinderella story', ""What a Girl Wants"" also ultimately falls into the doomed, classic genre of 'a cliched and utterly lifeless movie'. There have been several movies where the Cinderella premise works beautifully, the film which most comes to mind being ""The Princess Diaries"".
Yet while ""The Princess Diaries"" was like a breath of fresh air, ""What a Girl Wants"" reeked with the stench of a plot so stale, it was hard not to gag at numerous scenes. Whenever there comes up a scene where Daphne 'livens things up', I just wanted to groan and think, ""Here we go again...""
But more importantly, it is the weak cast with their even weaker characters which adds mostly to the downfall of this film. For example, let me list up just a few of many stereotypical semi-minor characters this movie delivers:
*The evil Glynnis Payne (Anna Chancellor) who has every intention of marrying Lord Dashwood for his power and money.
*The equally evil daughter of the evil Glynnis, Clarisse Payne (Christina Cole) who will stop at nothing to make sure Daphne doesn't feel like she belongs.
*The most evil of them all, Alistaire Payne (Jonathan Pryce), Lord Dashwood's chief advisor who had much to do with the deception that tore Henry and Libby apart.
*And most sadly, though Oliver James was an amazingly talented singer, his character of Ian Wallace whom Daphne falls for is the formula boyfriend; very poor yet has a heart of gold.
And just exactly were the writers thinking of when they added such inane characters such as Peach and Pear Orwood, the dimwitted twins, and Lord Orwood (Roger Ashton-Griffiths) the stuffy aristocrat?
As for Amanda Bynes, she is definitely very cute and is quite energetic, but Bynes suffers in that her character of Daphne is quite two-dimensional, leaving no room for her to really act.
By now, you are wondering, ""So why is this Priscilla Stafford giving this movie two stars if this movie stunk?"" Well, here's the reason: Colin Firth is what makes this film worth two stars. Every time he comes on screen, he makes you forget the inane plot and concentrate on his character of Henry Dashwood who is searching for true happiness. Here is an actor who puts strength behind a somewhat bland character and makes you eventually fall in love with him. With his British accent, incredible acting talent, and charmingly good looks, Colin Firth is what makes the movie worth the watch at all. Kelly Preston, too, was not that bad in her role. Sadly, she doesn't have enough film time but when she and Colin Firth are together, they dazzle the screen. It's a shame the movie didn't focus more on them.
To finish up, ""What a Girl Wants"" is nothing new. The ending is semi-good but doesn't give you that 'happy-happy' feeling most chick flicks give out and SHOULD give out. There are a few laughs during the film yet they seem few and sparse between. Teens might enjoy the loud pop music which is heard throughout the whole movie. Strictly for pre-teen girls, ""What a Girl Wants"" is probably exactly what it is, only what girls want. Unless of course it's really Colin Firth you want then maybe you should watch this movie. But if you REALLY want Colin Firth, instead watch ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" or even the BBC miniseries ""Pride and Prejudice"". In those movies you'll REALLY see Colin Firth shine, and that is what we really want, isn't it? ^_^",1084492800,10,4130,4.785714285714286

Her offbeat, rocker mother (played by Kelly Preston) isn't sure about letting Daphne go off into the ""real world"" to find her dad, considering that she was burned a long time ago by him (Well, according to her). But Daphne goes to England anyway, finds him, and tries to be the kind of daughter she thinks he wants, sacrificing her originality.
Colin Firth is really funny and cute in this movie. He always impresses me, especially with his expressionate eyes, which reveal a million different emotions. Awesome supporting cast as well, plus a cutie newcomer named Oliver James, who even sings in the film (and yes, that's really him singing).

I have to say, though, that the best character for me was Oliver James, not because of his acting abilities, which were not thoroughly explored, but his singing voice needs to get more credit. In truth, he should release an album over here in the States. Those two songs on the soundtrack just don't give me enough! Speaking of the soundtrack, I love how they used ""I Wanna be Bad""!

Maybe it is because I have a daughter of my own, but I found the chemistry between Bynes and Firth to be irresistable, and enough to overcome my usual antipathy to films of this genre.
At times the storyline is a bit ""over the top"" but even for a hard-boiled character like myself it holds the viewer's interest throughout.  Obviously this is a take-off on the ""Cinderella"" theme, complete with the Evil Stepsister, and the film acknowledges that in a humorous way that I won't spoil for you.

17-year-old NYC girl Daphne Reynolds goes on a search to find her father, a British politician, who has been MIA all her life. You'll find out more when you watch the movie.

1896221,5,B00009XITR,"This is one of the best Cinderella-based stories I have ever seen!
Amanda Bynes portrays a 17-year-old American girl who has lived her entire life without a father, or even a fatherly figure. When she turns 17, she realizes that she is missing half of her, and decides to give in to what she really wants: a father. Daphne Reynolds (Amanda Bynes) crosses the Atlantic to see Daddy Dearest.  She finds out that her father is Lord Henry Dashwood (Colin Firth), high in political power and also engaged.  Daphne quickly discovers that this is almost no different from her own Cinderella story.  There's the evil step-mother [almost, since she's not married to Henry yet], Glynnis who only wants to be married to Henry for political power.  Her daughter, Clarissa is the evil step-sister who only wants a title and recognition.  Clarissa and Glynnis both try to stand in the way of Daphne getting her father to go with his conscience, instead of the politics.
This is a really sweet movie, I'd say for all ages.  If you enjoy this movie, then I would highly recommend the following: The Parent Trap (G), any Cinderella movie, or Cinderella-based synopsis, The Princess Diaries (G), Big Fat Liar (PG), and Agent Cody Banks (PG).",1071100800,,1223,4.8

1896223,4,B00009XITR,"""What A Girl Wants"" is a delightful, fairy tale romp of a film. If you are a fan of Colin Firth's and don't mind very lite-entertainment, this is a must-see.
Once upon a time in Morocco, circa 1970-something, a young British Lord, Henry Dashwood, (Colin Firth), met American beauty, Libby Reynolds, (Kelly Preston), a young rock singer, and the two fell madly in love. A Bedouin tribal chief married them by the light of an African moon. Blessed with thoughts of 'happily ever after' they returned to London, the noble Dashwood family manse, and the real world of the British upper-classes. Dashwood retainers and advisors encouraged Libby, a commoner, to leave her husband for his own good, his future career, etc. After all, she was terribly unsuitable. And so Libby left England, with no explanation and returned to New York City, a walk-up apartment in Chinatown, and a career as a singer.
Fast-forward 17 years. Apparently Libby left London with more than her luggage. She is the mother of a lovely and spirited teenager, Daphne, (Amanda Byrnes). Daphne Reynolds has almost everthing a girl could want. She's smart, caring, beautiful and possesses great flair. She has completed high school and has college and a lifetime of possibilities ahead of her. Her relationship with her Mom is open and loving, if somewhat unconventional. But she feels incomplete. Daphne knows all about her father, whom she has never met but has always longed for. Dashwood is totally unaware of his offspring's existance. Daphne always believed that someday her father would discover he had a daughter and come for her. After all these years of no-show Dad, she finally decides to take-off for London and make herself known to him. And the fun begins.
Dashwood is engaged to a snobby, aristocratic bore, whose baggage includes a teenage daughter, even more boring than her mother - if that is possible. He has also resigned from the House of Lords and is beginning his political career running for office in the House of Commons. Enter Daphne. Surprise!
The interaction and chemistry between Amanda Byrnes and Colin Firth make the film fun. The wicked stepmother and step-sister-to-be are terrific villains. You'll want to hiss and boo everytime they appear on screen. And Eileen Atkins, as Lady Dashwood, Henry's Mum, is wonderful. As her new found granddaughter hugs her, Atkins says, ""No hugs, dear. I'm British. We only show affection to dogs and horses."" Oliver James, who plays Ian Wallace, Daphne's love interest, is charming and has a great voice. He's in a British rock band...what else?? The sound track is also quite good.
""What A Girl Wants"" will never receive an Oscar nomination. If you miss this film it is no big loss, unless you're a Colin Firth fan. This is an unusual role for him and he pulls it off really well. Great eye-candy! I enjoyed it and would recommend it for a few hours of fun entertainment.

1896224,4,B00009XITR,"Amanda Bynes stars as a young American girl named Daphne whose mother fell in love with an artistocratic young Englishman in her youth but who was separated from him by family and social pressures.  Daphne has dreamed of being reunited with her father, and finally she takes things into her own hands and decides to run away to England to find him.  That's not difficult, as he is running for Parliament and he is campaigning everywhere.  Daphne discovers that he is soon to be married to a snobby young woman with an equally snobby daugher, but she doesn't let that deter her as she pursues a relationship with her father.  Predictably, this high-spirited young American is not well-suited to life among the aristocracy and lots of mini-disasters occur as her father tries to introduce her to English society.  The potential step-sister and step-mother do everything they can to undermine Daphne's efforts, but predictably this movie has a happy end.

Listening to the commentaries of Amanda Bynes and the directors and writers, it made me think about it even more, and like it even more.  Not knowing that some of the scenes were not even buildings but tents that looked so much like an old British building.  And not knowing that Amanda was only 16 at the time, they had doubles for her. It's kind of weird that they would make so many rules for young actors and actresses, that it seems to be worthless and odd.  The crew was amazing!  The sound, camera, actors, and actresses, digital crew, hair and makeup (AMAZING), and the clothes team--were also FANTASTIC!  It was so much fun to watch!  Also, Kelly Preston did her own singing!

This film is about a girl you can root for from the beginning who is attractive without wearing revealing clothing, who is smart and witty without putting others down, and who charms a guy simply by being herself.
It looks like a teen flick, but is definitely worth the time of women of all ages.  Grab this film for good, clean fun!",1066089600,2,610,4.25
1896227,4,B00009XITR,"""What a Girl Wants"" is supposedly a remake of 1958's ""The Reluctant Debutante,"" although really the only thing in common is the idea of a young American girl (Sandra Dee) having to enter prim, proper, and priggish British society.  Besides, most teenagers will be convinced ""What a Girl Wants"" is ripping off ""The Princess Diaries.""  Anyhow for this 2003 film there are some additional complications.  Once upon a time dashing Englishman Henry Dashwood (Colin Firth) hooked up with American hippie Libby Reynolds (Kelly Preston).  While the legitimacy of their Moroccan marriage is in doubt there are two things we do know.  First, that Henry's family found a way to send the American misfit packing.  Second, after her return to the States Libby gave birth to a daughter, Daphne, who grows up to be Amanda Bynes.
Of course Henry does not know about Daphne.  Of course Daphne manages to leave her apartment over the Chinese restaurant and get to England where she is able to surprise her father.  Of course Henry is about to marry a snobbish Englishwoman (Anna Chancellor) who has an equally ambitious and even more conceited daughter (Christina Cole) and neither of them can stomach Daphne's surprise arrival.  Actually, there is pretty much nothing in this film that is not a surprise, which is really something we should have known going into this one.  If Daphne has been dreaming all of her live of a father-daughter dance at a formal occasion then you can take a wild guess at to which scene in ""What a Girl Wants"" is supposed to make you cry.
These stories are all pretty much totally predictable.  But Kenneth Burke defined ""form"" as the creation of an appetite in the mind of an auditor and the satisfying of that appetite, which explains why this film is enjoyable for its targeted age and gender group (i.e., teenage girls for already adore Amanda from Nickelodeon).  Beyond that there is the charm evidenced by daughter and father in this film.  Bynes gets to have scenes where she is sassy and those where she gets to play dress up in a big way, while Firth gets to play a most reasonable British politician who has an inner free spirit just waiting to break out and start dancing in front of a mirror.
There are some funny moments, usually as the expense of Daphne's father's future daughter-in-law, which usually involve putting some life into a series of stuffy British affairs.  Then there is Amanda's newly discovered grandmother who explains, ""No hugging, dear, I'm British.""  It is clear the old lady is one of the few people in the film with her heart and her brains both in the right place and you wonder why she does not cut through all the nonsense and stop everyone from delaying the inevitable.  But ""What a Girl Wants"" knows not only how this story is supposed to be told but exactly what its true source is when Daphne tells her nemesis: ""My evil step sister, you've seen Cinderella, right?  Let me clue you in. I win.""

""What a Girl Wants"" is an amazingly entertaining movie.  It has people you will love, and people you will hate.  It has excitement, a great soundtrack, and great performances.  It also has romance, humor, sentimentality and true MAGIC.

The leads, an absolutely outstanding Colin Firth as Henry Dashwood, is the uptight brit longing to find something to wake him out of the political career that has been shoved upon him, and bring him back to his more joyous and carefree youth.  By contrast there is the long lost daughter Daphne, perfectly cast Amanda Bynes who is the perfect one to do it.  Daphne is this exhuberant, sweet and fresh innocent faced girl who longs for the father she has never known as she has lived with mom Libby, also wonderful Kelly Preston.  Libby and Henry had a shortlived romance that was cut short but the reprehensible advisor that watched Henry's late dads political career.  Libby left Henry and found herself pregnant, but raised the baby herself.  Daphne, tired of never having that father/daughter dance, decides to run away to England and meet dear old dad.  Problem is, he is engaged to the advisors daughter Glynnis, an insufferable prig, and is about to gain a most snooty step daughter to boot.

Daphne arrives in England and finds a singer as a first friend, Ian Wallace.  Encouraged by her new friend, she infiltrates the guarded fence to the palace and for the first time, father and daughter meet.

To sum things up, the wonderful chemistry between the two leads is sheer magic.  Colin Firth has never been so wonderfully sympathetic as Lord Dashwood.  You have to love him as he is so convincingly flustered over his discovery, yet thrilled too.  Amanda Bynes as Daphne is wonderful and you have to root for her to win as grandma tells her ""They'll be rooting for you to fail"".  Does Daphne win or lose her role in the heart of long lost dad Henry?  You MUST watch this film and find out for yourself.  No matter what your age, this film is one that will entertain, and touch your heart with characters you really do care about.  This alone makes ""What a Girl Wants"" a true winner in every way.",1064275200,7,2358,4.658595641646489

I'm a confirmed firth-a-holic.  But, I thought this movie might be another ""Thousand Acres"" and so waited til it came out on DVD to see it.
This is not great art or even great cinema.  But, hell, it's a lot of fun!  And many times that's what I crave from a movie.
The true acting comes from Mr. Firth who is perfectly cast as the English gentleman who would be PM -- and looks a bit like Tony Blair to boot.
His wild past with an American rock singer comes to an end that is full of deception.  And 17 years later his daughter from that past comes to find her dad.
Amanda Bynes is cute.  She doesn't really need to act.  Still, the on screen chemistry between she and Firth brings out some potentially amazing talent in this adorable young lady.
There's a lot of good humor and the music ain't bad either.
The scene where Firth dons leather pants and dances in front of the mirror is imspired.
For trivia buffs -- Anna Chancelor plays Mr. Firth's fiancee who is in it for the political prestige.  Some may recognize her as the unmarried Miss Bingley from the A&E/BBC Pride and Prejudice.  She's a great character actress.  She doesn't get him in this story, either.
And -- was it my imagination that her stuck up daughter (Clarissa) bears such a striking resemblance to Reese Witherspoon?  Reese played Firth's ward in The Importance of Being Earnest.
Ok.  Final thoughts.  It's a fun movie.  As with Bridget Jones's Diary -- it's also a feel good movie -- and those are the ones I tend to watch again and again.  Granted:  Bridget Jones is an example of great film as well as a fun movie. Still, with Colin Firth in What a Girl Wants -- so much the better.",1062979200,31,1832,4.372781065088757

1896248,5,B00009XITR,"Okay, this definitely could be classified as a ""chick flick"" but it's such a touching story. I too, originally wanted to see it because of Colin . And I'll admit I used to watch ""The Amanda Show"" on Nickelodeon which was pretty funny. I'm glad Amanda Bynes finally gets to show her stuff, acting stuff that is. Anyway, I rented it and 20mins into the movie, I knew this was one I had to add to my DVD collection.
Kelly Preston is great as the trippy hippy mom. The pairing of her with Colin Firth was great as well. I only wish they had more scenes of them falling in love...you know, good dating stuff in Morocco. The story follows Daphne (Bynes) to London on her search to meet her real father, the political candidate for Parliament, Lord Dashwood. Can she fit in to his new life? What about his fiancee and her daughter? With touching moments and the great physical comedy provided by Amanda Bynes, this movie is great entertainment. Great movie for a quiet night at home or as a family movie and the soundtrack is awesome. It even includes two of my favorite songs of all time, ""London Calling"" by The Clash and ""Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo"" by Rick Derringer.

1896252,4,B00009XITR,"There are a lot of pre-teen movies coming out these days, and while the storylines are nothing new, the trick is to find one that isn't forced, and where the acting and setting makes the movie enjoyable.
I'll be the first to admit Amanda Bynes wasn't my fave actress before watching this movie, but I think its one of the best ones out there.  Her acting is for the most part fluid and funny, and there are many moments that make you laugh out loud.  The cast of characters surrounding her, including Colin Firth (Bridget Jones Diary) enhance her own preformance, and who doesn't love a movie set in England?
The story is basically about a teenage girl who longs so much for her father, that when given enough information about him, she makes a surprise trip to England to visit him.  His political upper crust lifestyle is nothing like Daphne's (Bynes) own, which consists of living in China Town with her hippie mom.  Watch as Daphne grows up, learns a few lessons, clashes and blends cultures, deals with bratty future step-siblings, and falls in love.  A cute movie that is enjoyable, to say the least.",1060992000,2,1106,4.622448979591836
1896253,4,B00009XITR,"My daughter and wife both forced me to watch this movie.  Truthfully, I actually did want to watch it because I thought it might be funny, and it looked similar to ""The Princess Diaries,"" which I also enjoyed.  I was pleased that the movie turned out to be watchable and fun.
Daphne Reynolds is a young woman in New York who yearns to know her father.  As she grows up, she becomes more and more distressed by the possibility that she will never have a chance to know her father.  After watching a father-daughter dance at a wedding one day, she decides it is time to act and go off to find him.
Daphne was the result of a romance between her free-spirited mother, Libby Reynolds (Kelly Preston), and Henry Dashwood (Colin Firth), who once was as free-spirited as Libby, but ultimately succumbed to the prim and proper expectations of the British upper class, and Libby was left behind.  Unbeknownst to Henry, he left Libby with a gift:  Daphne.  In case you were wondering, Libby and Henry were legally married in Morocco, though various characters attempt to obscure the legality of that marriage.
Daphne has entered the scene at a very critical point in Henry Dashwood's life.  He has given up his hereditary position in the House of Lords to run for elected office.  Most especially interested in his success are Alistair Payne (Jonathan Pryce), Glynnis Payne, his fianc, and Clarissa Payne.  Naturally all three of these characters want what's best for them, and not what's best for Henry.  Dahne's free-wheeling ways do not sit well with any of these three characters, and they impress upon Henry that to win the election he needs to bring Daphne back under control.
Daphne succumbs to the pressure of being the daughter of British royalty and becomes the beautiful, dutiful daughter, and adopts a type-B personality demeanor.  We all know that Daphne's irrepressible energy and type-A personality will have to win out, and remaining the meek, dutiful daughter is not her path.
As with a recent, similar movie, ""The Princess Diaries,"" this movie has a fair amount of predictability, clich and stereotype.  However, as with the earlier movie, this movie too is a winner.  The real success in this case is from Amanda Bynes and her interaction with Colin Firth.  Colin sees in Amanda the person he truly is, and he sees that he similarly stifled his true character to fit into the expected mold.  Amanda has virtually no interest in Colin's position or wealth.  She is who she is; her real goal has always been to gain a father, not money or status.
We love Daphne because she is a bit eccentric, but she is all-American, and engagingly normal.  We find by the end of the movie that being pretentious should not be a cover for whom or what we want to be.  Sure, the plot is contrived, but who cares?  It's way too much fun to worry about such trivialities.  Enjoy!",1060992000,11,2868,4.696
1896264,5,B00009XITR,"Ok, I watched this movie because I wanted to see a nice, clean family movie.  And that is EXACTLY what I got!  I really liked it a lot.  The last ""cute"" family movie that I saw like this was ""The Parent Trap"" with Dennis Quaid (another recommended film for viewers looking for nice family flicks).
And BTW . . . some people should really stop being nit-picky when they see these types of films (*cough* look at person from Singapore's review *cough*).  This film was really made for pure entertainment purposes . . . to sit back for a while and smile or laugh.  But NOT to criticize the bad acting, taboos, or political incorrectness of every little scene in the film.  That's really ridiculous!  We're not judging a potential film for an Oscar, you know.  :P
In fact, there should be more movies made like this in Hollywood.  And by that, I mean CLEAN and SMUT-less.  Most films these days are really tacky . . . . like out of Sodom and Gommorah or something.",1060819200,2,960,4.403409090909091
1896265,4,B00009XITR,"I haven't even heard of this movie, and neither have I even kept up with Amanda Bynes' career, but I bought this DVD on a whim and it is pretty cool. Last time I remember Amanda was portraying ""Dear Ashley"" in the ""All That"" show back in 1997. She was still a little kid in there, I think she was 11. I also remember Allen Iverson was a rookie then with only one tattoo. Now it's 2K3 and Amanda is all matured and lookin' nice, and Iverson got a million tatts, and of course, is one of the top stars in the NBA. The point is, it's been six years!! Amanda has grown, y'all. This movie is really cool, I liked the scenes in the flea market or wherever they were in. I highly recommend this movie. I give it 4 stars because it's kind of a strange story.",1060732800,,750,4.040268456375839

This is a great movie and I think Amanda Bynes is perfect for the lead role.  She's, cute funny and believable.  The movie is funny, at times, sad at others and has a great ending.  Maybe the ending is a little too perfect, but that's what you pay for.",1060387200,2,370,4.169014084507042

As a 'girl' who never knew her father, I can certainly relate to this story line.  When I told a friend of mine that I'd seen this film, and had enjoyed it, she said, ""That's a kiddie film.""  She was mistaken.  This film will appeal to anyone who simply wants to be entertained.  And watch Colin.  Let's not forget Colin. It was great to see him let loose.

1896270,5,B00009XITR,This movie is about a young girl (Amanda Bynes) who wants to find her dad who lives in England. I thought that this movie was exilerating. It was the best movie Amanda Bynes have starred in. This movie has comedy and romance. Since I'm more the comedy type and not the romantic type I tell you that this movie is both and great for everybody. You'll love it! You'll laugh and cry throughout the movie....guarentee it!,1059523200,3,417,4.5
1896271,2,B00009XITR,"This cotton candy chick-flick falls squarely into the ""creampuff teen movie"" stereotype. If you are over 13 years of age and carry XY chromosomes, following are some hints to bear this movie:
(1) Get loads of popcorn, and coke. May be a dozen chocolate bars too. You'll have ample time.
(2) Don't expect anything UNpredictable. Every conceivable teen cliche is thrown in -- eye-hurting floral gowns, those pesky female shrieks, all-muscle-no-brain deluge of boys, tiaras, father's undying love, a hep mom, tattoos, tongue piercings, staid rock, and attention grabbing antics. Not even the soundtrack escapes cliche for that matter, expect a priceless gem from The Donnas.
(3) Prepare NOT to be the least bit peeved at Gordon's doozy portrayal of the British, who are all made to look like sniveling morons without any trace of heart. (How niche can your audience get?)
SAVING GRACE:
Colin Firth (but then you knew that).
FINAL RECOMMENDATION:
If you really must watch it against your will, cast your twit filter far away.",1058572800,3,1021,5.083333333333333
1896272,5,B00009XITR,"My friend and i went to see this movie together, and we had a BLAST! Amanda Bynes stars in this movie. I'm a fan of hers, so I was anticipating this movie greatly.

  Amanda is Daphne, a teen who lives in Chinatown with her former pop star mother, who now performs at parties and weddings, taking Daphne along as a waitress. She gets sick of seeing father-daughter dances, when her father is a British lord who doesn't know she exists. The aristocrat is played by Colin Firth.
  Daphne goes to England to see her father. She meets a boy named Ian, played by the super-hott Oliver James (after the movie my friend and i were fighting over who liked him more- we each had a DESPERATE crush!). Then Daphne goes to the palace, where she stays. Her new step-mother and step-sister make life miserable. But she and Henry Dashwood, her father, get close. But she, along with Ian, make a little too much mayhem, so as Henry gets loose (we see him dancing in tight leather pants!), Daphne gets stiff, blowing off Ian for the queen's royal tea! In the end, everything turns out great...predictably.
  Though this is a 'chick flick' and predictable, it was still a fun watch. :)",1056672000,2,1167,4.5285714285714285

Colin Firth's first of many roles as king will make you feel like a princess. But don't forget who you truly are. A stubborn, clumsy American that pushes creepy British guys into the water. Walk through the markets with musical, shopping montages. Confront your father's abandonment. Fall in love along-side Amanda with an ethnically ambiguous singing heart-throb. Easily one of Amanda Bynes' best movies.",1522627200,,528,5.223529411764706

7993925,4,B00009XITR,"What a Girl Wants is entertaining, albeit really predictable formulaic teen shows up in stuffy society and doesn't conform so changes the uptight ones to be more like her movie.  In this case, Amanda Bynes plays Daphne a 17 year old teenager, whose mother, a hippie party planner, has kept the identity of her father from both herself and the poor guy Henry (Colin Firth).  The mother got knocked up in Morocco, but returned to the US before Henry knew about the pregnancy, since he had no idea where she went or why she left he moved on with his life as an heir to the British throne, and for some reason is currently running for politics back in London.  Why a royal would need to run for politics, I don't know, but even though he isn't elected yet, he lives in a clone of the white house. Daphne having boarded a plane as soon as she found out the guy existed, arrives in London to discover her dad is running for office, and a rich royal.  She sneaks into the grounds of the let's call it Peach House, and is caught by Henry who tells her off for being a reporter invading his privacy, in tears she of course mentions she's not a reporter he's her dad. Of course this is a potential scandal for both the Royal Family and his running for office.  Even though I imagine his political aspirations would actually go up being he'd be seen more like a commoner like say Prince Harry.  Henry's got a stuffy up her self fiance who also has an evil daughter, both don't like this new development in Henry's life.  Daphne is allowed to stay and of course is confused by the royal way of life, and not real keen on conforming.

You know where this movie is going to go, it is kind of fun getting there.  The mother is a completely unprofessional wedding planner though as is evident with the final scene.  Couldn't care less that it is her client's big day and maybe the something she stuffs up for her own selfish needs, is kind of important for the bride.

The movie is about 15 years old now, but it's not too dated for modern audiences.  Security for the Royals and in other places doesn't seem to exist, nor do the paparazzi seem interested in moving from their media scrums, both of which are completely unrealistic.",1514592000,,2216,4.378048780487805
