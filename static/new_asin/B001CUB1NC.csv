I applaud the series for its diversity in terms of gender, race, age, region, inter alia.  In this episode, we hear of sexual orientation diversity.  This shows a gay man addicted to meth.  There are a few documentaries about gay men and meth and viewers may want to see this alongside those.  Still, the program started with a warning that it covered matters ""of a graphic nature.""  There were sexual terms used here.  However, unless I blinked too long, I saw no nudity or sexual acts.  I do wonder if the warning is a bit heterosexist.

This was interesting in how addictions were inflamed by other problems.  Alissa was in a disfiguring car accident.  Brian felt abandoned as an adoptee.  Both subjects were soooo abusive to their partners.  Alissa's man was kinda whipped.  He had three jobs, while she had none.  She seemed to bring no income into the house.  He could have easily replaced her, but he acted like her puppy dog.  Brian's partner allowed him to curse him out after he gave him a home.  He was clearly going to go use and be unfaithful to him, but the partner didn't punish him.  These ppl know how to wrap someone around their fingers.

The responses to the intervention were novel.  This was a unique episode that I recommend folk see.",1293408000,,1389,4.62962962962963
