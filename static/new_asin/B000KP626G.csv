8158512,5,B000KP626G,"There's only 5 shorts in the final volume of this travelogue-type collection, to wrap up the end of a great era of hour-long Disneytoon shorts DVDs. The 5 shorts are The Reluctant Dragon from Great Britain (only the animated short is here, and doesn't have the live-action feature of the same name, nor its ending card, which is later seen in volume 6 of Disney's shorts collection from 2009), Polar Trappers from the South Pole starring Donald & Goofy, the milestone Silly Symphony short The Goddess of Spring from Greece (starring the goddess of Spring herself; Persiphone, & Pluto the devil), For Whom the Bull's Toil starring Goofy from Mexico, and last but not least, The Little House from the USA. The Retromercials at the beginning are the same as volume 3, but still none at the end, via Fastplay, and still no Sneak Peeks option on the main menu. This wouldn't be the end of an era for too long; in 2009, Disney tried it again with Disney's Classic Animation Collection with 7 volumes in all, Donald in Mathmagicland as a standalone disc in the same year, only as a reissue of a 2007 Disney Movie Club-exclusive DVD, and with the controversial short series Have a Laugh in 2010 & 2011 with only 4 volumes. Every volume of the first 4 collections from 2005 to 2007 are now in the Disney Vault, so it'll be pretty high to get them if you never got them before and want to now.

1) THE RELUCTANT DRAGON - a cartoon excerpt from the feature of the same name.  It is about a poetry loving dragon. ***NOTE*** The Amazon synopsis about Robert Benchley giving a tour through the Disney Studios is erronious, that applies to the feature version of this title.  Only the 20 minute cartoon from that feature is included on this DVD compilation.

2) THE GODDESS OF SPRING - a 1934 Silly Symphony that just got released to DVD this past December on the ""Disney Treasures Silly Symphonies Volume 2"".  An enjoyable fantasy tale that may be a little slow for today's video game kids.

3) THE LITTLE HOUSE - a 1952 special already released on the ""Disney Treasures Rarities DVD"".

4) FOR WHOME THE BULLS TOIL - Goofy's 1953 classic bullfighting cartoon was previously released on his out-of-print ""Disney Treasures Complete Goofy"" DVD.

5) POLAR TRAPPERS - 1938, Donald & Goofy head to the frozen north to do some trapping.  This was already released on the now out-of-print ""Disney Treasures Chronological Donald Volume 1"" DVD.",1169337600,28,1115,4.888297872340425
