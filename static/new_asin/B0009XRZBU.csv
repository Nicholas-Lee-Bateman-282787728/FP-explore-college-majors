2334529,2,B0009XRZBU,"I was lead to believe that this product ws more along the lines of the blaxplointation genre of films of which I am a huge fan.  I have currently watched one film that did start Richard ""Shaft"" Roundtree named Embassy.  The movie was just okay, but the veiwing quality was quite poor.  It was grainy and also hard to hear.  i would not recommend this product.",1265587200,4,359,4.393939393939394

8069593,3,B0009XRZBU,"These are Richard Roundtree films but the cover has Fred Williamson.  Fred isn't in these films, Richard is.  Unfortunately the artwork department for this video couldn't tell the difference between Richard and Fred - I can tell the difference because Fred is my husband!  Nice photo - I took it!  I just think the customers should know that they shouldn't judge this dvd by it's cover.",1473465600,,386,4.803030303030303
