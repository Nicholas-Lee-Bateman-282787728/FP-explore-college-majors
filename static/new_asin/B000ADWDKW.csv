8078104,5,B000ADWDKW,This is a very informative disk. But it is more about mining methods than anything else. Still it is well worth buying.,1381968000,,119,4.454545454545454
8078105,2,B000ADWDKW,"The title is very misleading. It really is NOT about ghost towns, but about mining!!! The History Channel had a decent shot at this, but blew it. Save your money",1353628800,,161,4.4
8078106,5,B000ADWDKW,Very interesting about the history of mining and tools. great scenery of the Gold Rush area of Ca. and one town in Montana.,1307145600,,123,4.391304347826087
8078107,5,B000ADWDKW,"I have had a fascination of Ghost towns since childhood, and visited numerous sites in West Central Nevada. This video, a VHS mode, Shows a nice variety of towns scattered around our West, and gives a very detailed description of early mining methods, in particular, placer mining. i have enjoyed watching it several times already, and will value it for years. The History Channel has done quality work over the years, and this production is no exception. A very enjoyeable product.",1249430400,,482,4.962962962962963
8078108,2,B000ADWDKW,"This DVD briefly mentions and shows just two ghost towns (Bodie, California and Garnet, Montana).  It spends almost the entire video in showing how they are restoring log cabins in Montana and mining for gold in California and the process used for mining for gold.  While these all may be interesting subjects, they are barely mentioning the ghost towns themselves.  The length of the DVD is under an hour.  They probably spent less than five minutes actually showing and telling about the ghost towns and only mention two.  For the money being charged for this DVD, you might want to think twice before purchasing it.",1133395200,34,618,4.847619047619047
