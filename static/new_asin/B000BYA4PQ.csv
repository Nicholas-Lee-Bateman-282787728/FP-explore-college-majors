8272124,5,B000BYA4PQ,I loved this DVD.  I hadn't heard of the title but like most anything Morgan Fairchild is in I had to have it.  As usual she was her stunning self.  The movie was well done and I really enjoyed the DVD.  No fancy nob turning or tuning in Tokyo. I just put it in the player and it looked great!  Highly reccomended!,1138320000,4,314,4.0
