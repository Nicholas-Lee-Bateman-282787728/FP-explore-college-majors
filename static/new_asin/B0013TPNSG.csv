8352390,5,B0013TPNSG,Another great video on spey casting. Breaks down the casting so that even a dummy like me can understand it.,1415232000,,108,4.45
8352391,5,B0013TPNSG,"John & Amy Hazel demonstrate how to dial in exactly the right length and weight of shooting head for your two-handed rod and show you how easy it is to make effortless, monster casts with these hot new lines.
I have a 14', 9 weight and a 12'6"", 7 weight rod set up with the Vision Ace heads used in this DVD and they are a real pleasure to cast.  It requires a different casting stroke than the traditional spey style, but it's much easier to learn and you'll pick it up in no time.  I have several spey casting videos and this is the only one that shows you how to get the perfect line match for your rod, which is critical.  Highly recommended.",1209340800,3,646,4.152
