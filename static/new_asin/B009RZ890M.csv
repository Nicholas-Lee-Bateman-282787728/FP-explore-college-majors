5361810,5,B009RZ890M,"It's true that Kikyo does not end up with InuYasha, but it was never going to happen anyway. I mean come on, she a walking dead girl. The good news is Kikyo and Kagome make a connection and Kikyo SPOILER: dies in peace. All Kikyo really wanted was to be at peace and stop the ultimate bad guy, and she, with the help of Kagome, make the first step to killing Neuroku. And can you really blame Kagome for being jealous of Kikyo and InuYasha when he has feels for both women and leads Kagome on yet used to hang all over an ex-girlfriend. Who wouldn't be jealous. Anyway, all the main characters have developed very nicely and have found a place of existance. Even Neuroku gets what he really wanted, hint it wasn't power or Kikyo. InuYasha and his brother tolerate each other and the brother gets over the Tetsuiga sword and gains self-satisfactory for himself. He even works with the others in the final battle scene. All of the characters grow in knowledge and wisdom for the better, and Kagome is faced with the hardest thing she has ever had to due, make the right wish to stop the battle within the jewel. The choices she makes in this have of the Final Act make her into a stronger character and role model. Sango grows by making a bad decision but becomes a better person and partner from realizing her mistake and being sorry for it by taking action. The best part is all of the character find peace and happiness in there own, sometimes strange, way and that is what counts in this series.

The ending made me think for awhile on whether I liked it or not, but after I looked at all of the characters endings I loved it. The themes and plots of each episode were linked and yet individually unique. There was a lot of action in each episode and the story line moved along, I still would like to see if Sessumoru got a girl eventually. But I understood his restraint of showing his emotions partially from his mother and father, it just took him longer to figure out power isn't everything. There is also a lot of comedy, even in the most serious points of the story line, as well as action. All of the characters go through spiritual, emotion, and physical tests to come out on top. The characters eventually know when they are walking right into a trap from Neuroku, though they don't know what he's going to do next, and at least they aren't just being stupidly simple minded. I gave the total series of the Final Act a 5 out of 5.",1351382400,10,2441,4.364835164835164
5361811,3,B009RZ890M,"the ending of inuyasha the final act is nothing special, its pretty common and decent, but leaves a hole in the story after kikyo dies in the ep 8, its mostly for those who love their "" kagome and inuyasha"" together but for those who love inuyasha and kikyo, its a different story,, if they got their happy ending but, it was never to come. Rumiko Takahashi may have created a great story, an charactors, set in feudal japan and the present day, the ending is lacking more of kikyo in the end than kagome in all fairness.

many of us don't like/respect rumiko T's female lead in the story of kagome because of her selfishness, jeliouey and annoying voice, she really is not a good rolemodel for an anime charcator, there is no strengh to her at all, shes weak as a priestess, and all she ever wanted was kikyo to leave  "" i wish kikyo would disappear from our lives""- kagome

overall its an ok ending nothing special, pretty boring, spoiler kagome and inuyasha marry miroku and sango have kids kohaku lives and becomes a slayer,

naraku, kagura, kikyo, kanna are the only ones who die. all thought the series is good the main female lead is not nice at all.! from biginning to end its just a tragic love triangle.",1351209600,2,1213,4.426008968609866

Inuyasha and Sesshoumaru though there are no real brotherly bonds between them they silently without words make a truce and fight well together.

5361868,4,B009RZ890M,"So I know people didn't like the changes to the cast, but we should be happy that they decided to animate this at all. Many anime series based on manga are just left hanging and unfinished. This way, we at least get closure to the series. As a follower of inuyasha since it first started airing in japan, I am glad they at least animated the real ending rather than leaving the first series' ending alone.",1386979200,,405,4.342105263157895
5361869,5,B009RZ890M,"Gets Even better, the compainons are closing in on Naraku as thay form an alliance with Lord Sesshomaru(Inuyasha's full demon brother) and a new villian as a body controlling demon named Magashui. He takes control of Kohaku(Sango's brother), who wounds Sango & later Inuyasha who's demonic energy leads to Magashui's destruction at the hands of  Lord Sesshomaru's Teneseiga. If you thought the bond between Miroku & Sango was tested in the original, THAT'S NOTHING,compared to what happens in the last episodes of IFA. Sango tries to kill Rin with Hiraikotsu and then forfiets her poison protection mask in retribution to Rin for attempting to Murder Her to Save Miroku. Miroku also abandonds Sango for fear that his wind tunnel will soon take him and if he stayed with, his girl too. Miroku and Sango reunite, but only after Sango takes a potentially fatal dose of Stronger Miasma, also I am about to explain the pic on the cover of Vol. 55 of the Inuyasha Manga. Sango's hair is straight down( although she's in armor) because a strong dose of very toxic Miasma, blows off/destroys her red hair tie. In the end Miroku appoligizes for abondaning Sango and she cries asking for her & Miroku to die together, although Miroku resfuses to let his woman Sango die, long story short Shippo shows up with an antidote and saves the two lovers and everyone reunites and Inuyasha says qoute ""see Naraku everyone survived & that there all going home alive"". Again A Must have for anyone who loved the first vol. or the original Inuyasha, also the scenes between Miroku & Sango, getting a real test of their bond is just tear jerking.

it's not ME, it's the Blu-Ray.

Also, VIZ MEDIA did a poor job, because they ALSO didn't add the ENGLISH TITLE SEQUENCE. It's in Japanese.

When I first watched Inuyasha it was in Japanese so it is great to have the original Japanese cast do the voices for their respective characters. However I understand that viewers who first watched this animation in English will need some time to adjust as not all the original cast do the voice over - which takes a bit of getting used to but not a major hinderance to buying the DVD.

Is it in the present, with her friends and back in High School?  Does she master her entrance exams to University?  Or does she remain in the past with InuYasha?

Nice that they actually allowed them to go back and finish it out properly. (rather than leaving it hanging or cramming it into a movie). At times it wanders off track on side stories and character development, at first it seemed annoying, but then I realized, that fits the Inuyasha series perfectly, character development and the person touch are the hallmarks of this series.

The story itself was fantastic, and I cannot imagine how the ending could have been any better.  What a ride this has been!!  While I miss the beautiful packaging that came with Seasons 1-7, I would encourage anyone who loved this series to go ahead and add ""The Final Act"" to their collection.  It is definitely worth it.

Saying that I also want to say that I truly did enjoy the final acts of this anime purely because of this love of the original series. I was incredibly disappointed when the series was cut short and was beyond overjoyed when these 26 new episodes were announced. I followed the manga and to see them actually put in action was great but be warned just like other reviews have stated these were very rushed and people that were not fans of the series or have not seen them will be disappointed. Many aspects of the manga are skipped to make sure that the entire story is completed in the 26 alotted episodes, and if you aren't familiar with the manga and the original anime you're most likely going to be lost. As a fan though, I would definitely recommend to any fans of the series out there or anyone that just wants to see it for the nostalgia factor from when you were a kid.",1364688000,,1007,4.3052631578947365

5361957,2,B009RZ890M,"i wrote a review to part 1....

this is part 2. the visual and audio quality is about on par with part 1. so really if youve seen part 1 you know what your getting that said this is the grand finale. and to be blunt it fails.

the grand finale as i pointed out in part 1 is full of illogical plotholes, terrible writing, weird decisions and overall just being rushed.

to spoil the bad ending...

we have naruku(spelling?) suddenly decide he needed to use only some of the power of the completely jewel to turn into a giant spider which is fine. the flaw in this logic is sessoshomaru has a new sword that he got in part 1 by having his arm magically regrow and have a sword pop out with it at the same time. this new sword when it hits something it spreads the damage until it kills whatever it has hit...this is so insanely cheap even in the universe of inuyasha it is a bit mind boggling....naraku is fully aware of this...and still decides to go herp derp and transform into a giant target to which this new sword hits once(well several times really) and proceeds to splash damage bleed him to death. the biggest insult here is naruku has NO ANSWER TO THIS. not even a vague back up plan and barely puts up a fight. the all mighty all cunning naruku just simply stops fighting for literally no reason at all. its just a terrible finale its mind boggling. in fact if i recall its kagome that talks him out of fighting yes thats right kagome while he is still getting splash damaged to death....he tries to stop it by severing part of his body but he just gets hit with the sword again its almost comical how bad this is. band not once does he even use the completely defiled jewel shard in all its infinite power.

its like he walks into that fight and powers up and armors up and transforms and everything and then does nothing...it'd be akin to goku going SSJ4 then just standing their while omega shenron proceeded to beat the tar out of him. which is what happens here naruku gets beaten badly and does nothing to stop it. nothing. completely out of character. not escape plan not cunning trap. nothing.

then after he dies inuyasha and kagome go into the world of the jewel(the jewel itself where the grand plan was to have kagome and naruku be the new souls eternally fighting in the jewel...inuyasha chases after her and saves her...the jewel is then gotten rid how you ask? because kagome wishes the jewel away and the jewel does it no questions asked despite being the apparent mastermind behind this all. the jewel just goes with the flow despite making a clear effort to stay alive. yep high quality cop out writing.

then inuyasha takes kagome back to her home world and is suddenly warped back to the feudal era....then strangely and in one of the shows biggest mind boggling plot points that it never lets die and that point being kagomes insistence on how important high school and junior high are to her future of slaying demons...she magically is able to return to the feudal era and live happily ever after only after finishing high school in fact on the exact day she graduates the well magically works because i guess calculus must be so important to demon slaying eh? or living in the feudal era for the rest of her life which in another variation from her character she doesnt eve get weepy or crying at the thought of leaving her family forever. and inuyasha still has those stupid beads around his neck youd think he'd have earned the right to have that removed. but nope.

and there we have it folks 8 seasons and the show is finally done....this is an example of how NOT to end a show. the shows ending is the weakest part of the entire show. the final act should be viewed as how not to end a series. its not as bad as the dbz ending but its pretty bad but even then we get GT to give it a proper farewell(the only thing GT does right really). in the history of TV there are bad endings but then there are endings like dbz and inuyasha the final act which take bad ending to a whole new level. in fact its almost better off to simply stop watching at season 7 and pretend it ends there as that bad ending beats the heck out of this ending.

the visuals and audio are on par with part 1 and it is presented rather well. the complaints are mostly at the terrible story.

buy this because you have the other 7 seasons and must own all 8 or because you haven't seen it but don't buy it expecting a good ending.",1361923200,,4436,4.320913461538462
5361958,5,B009RZ890M,"Inuyasha and his friends are fighting harder than ever to kill Naraku. Time is running out. Miroku doesn't have much time left, and the jewel is almost entirely in Naraku's hands. Inuyasha's group will have to team up with Sesshomaru if they hope to defeat the evil demon. When they do, what will happen to the sacred jewel? Will Kagome be able to go between worlds? Or will she have to choose one? Will she even have a choice? All of the questions you may have had for the past 12+ years are going to be answered.

This is the end of Inuyasha. It's been a long time coming, but it's finally over. I have to admit that it ended the way I expected, but I was still a little let down. The final battle with Naraku lasted for most of the last 8 episodes or so. Once the battle is over, the series wraps up pretty quickly. Even thought there is a time warp, and 3 years pass immediately, I really wish that we had a few more episodes to look into the future a little more. After such a long and drawn out series, I think it was kind of owed to the fans. Despite those feelings, I'm still happy with the ending.

Either way, if you have been a fan of the series all this time, you will probably thoroughly enjoy this conclusion. The animation, soundtrack, and voice acting is all still very good. You may already know that Kagome, and Sesshomaru have new voice actors. I wouldn't worry about it so much. They do fit in pretty well. I highly recommend this DVD to every anime fan out there.

5361967,5,B009RZ890M,"This will be a review of the Blu-ray release.

As the series enters it's final half with this second box set release, you'll see your favorite characters pushed to their limits as the final battle takes place directly inside of Naraku himself. In these last 13 episodes you'll get more romance, more action and more awesome episodes than the first set contained. Without giving too much from this set away.. there is an ""almost"" kiss scene and 2 actual kiss scenes between two different pairings from the series before the group heads inside of Naraku for the final battle, just to add to the intensity.

I received my copy almost 1 month early exactly from RightStuf this week. The same bonuses/extra features are on this set as the first set, so nothing special sadly. I had very high hopes that Viz would include the opening and endings creditless on this set, but I guess that was a little too much to ask for. The set comes with no advertisements this time either, nothing for Neon Alley, etc. The case is the standard recyclable blue case (for Blu-ray release) - Overall there was absolutely nothing redeeming about this box set in terms of bonuses or extra animated features.

The dub voice acting was spot on in these last few episodes, too, as it was in the first set but even better and played with more emotion.

So, again without giving too much away.. this set is a MUST HAVE for any true InuYasha fan who is looking to complete the anime. I cannot recommend this set to fans anymore, honestly. These last 13 episodes will have you on the edge of your seat. As I was rewatching the series dubbed it took me right back to 2009 and 2010 when the series was airing in Japan, but even MORE so now that my childhood dub voice actors have [for the most part] returned to their roles.

RightStuf currently has this set on pre-order for $10 dollars cheaper than Amazon too. If you're looking for a better price head over to RightStuf and you'll even get it shipped out early like what happened for me.",1358553600,9,2006,4.515151515151516
5361968,5,B009RZ890M,It came in very good conditions just as they said.  I received it before Xmas.  It was just as I had ordered.,1356566400,,109,3.909090909090909
5361969,5,B009RZ890M,"This should be a great set.  The only fault I found with the first 13 episodes, which I think is shared here, is that Viz / Ocean omitted credits for all of the guest star voice acting roles and for several of the regulars.  That merits the loss of half a star; but I couldn't bring myself to deduct a whole one.

The pacing and content of these episodes is vastly superior to the first half of the series, where great holes in the narrative were left out.  If you want to find out what really happened, read the manga.  The VizBig sets are up to volume 12 as of this writing (soon to be 13) and are exquisite copies of the originally published single volumes with the benefit of clean print face, better quality paper, and unflipped frames.

EDIT:  Having watched the entire series, I can say that the digital transfer is very good.  The original was produced in 1080 HD, making the blu-ray media a better reproduction.  However, the DVD is still fairly detailed.

As was the case with the first 13 episodes, all titles in the OP and ED for each episode are in Japanese.  There is an ""extra feature"" on the second disc that translates all of that text for each episode in the set.  This is great if you want to know the Japanese cast and crew; but the English voice actors are woefully under-represented.  Practically none of the guest star voices are mentioned and even some of the regulars are overlooked, except for the main cast (most of whom returned to voice the same characters).

If anyone is familiar with the characters from the original series, Sesshomaru, Kagome and Kaede are now voiced by different actors because the original performers were unable to return for various reasons.  This may, or may not, be important in your decision to purchase this set.  This is only my opinion; but all except one acquit themselves very well taking over roles that are strongly identified with their original portrayals.  I do have a quibble with one of the leads and feel that the acting for Kagome is weaker than it could, or should, be.  Detractors of the original performer may come to regret their criticism after watching this follow-up series.

That being said, the pacing of the second 13 episodes is more leisurely and linear than in the first half, although the tension builds constantly.  However, events are still switched around in sequence from the manga and there is unnecessary filler included while canon events are omitted.  Things move along so quickly though, that some viewers may not notice, or care.",1356307200,5,2524,4.652370203160271

Like my namesake, I do not love easily, but if I do, my love is eternal. It is now the end of 2016, and I have owned ""The Final Act"" for nearly three years. The pack is still sealed; I cannot bring myself to watch it. If I do not, in my mind, the series does not end. I am a member of InuYasha fanclubs worldwide; I have seen a whole new generation of InuYasha fans being born.
  I am no adolescent Otaku. I know the series much better than most, and have compiled concise character studies on each of the main characters. I am 64 years old, a professional writer who holds a Master's degree in both Literature and Psychology, and every day I hopefully await an email from Ms. Takahashi accepting my proposal for a continuation.
A tentative title is ""InuYasha - The Next Generation"". This series only truly ends if we allow it to.
