7950157,5,B00005QBYL,Cool NY character study indie. Great music soundtrack. David Johannsen is over the top as Andre' the Art Forger. Indie.,1362960000,,119,5.0
7950158,5,B00005QBYL,"This film is a film that drags you in, it isn't so much that you are watching it as being in it. You are right there at the bar, hearing the stories. It has all the characters of your neighborhood bar. A film like this doesn't come around too often, one that brings you in and holds you and you believe in it. The cast is a rag tag bunch that are every day people being held together by the trip to the familiar faces. Enjoy this film.",1337817600,,435,3.9545454545454546
7950159,4,B00005QBYL,"Viewing this movie is, for the most part, such a wonderful experience. The only thing wrong with it, and unfortunately it isn't a small snafu, was the casting of David Johansen. His acting is not only totally over-blown and annoying; it's completely unnecessary considering his characterization of the ""vile"" Andre, is just a more extreme take of the one already in the film; that of Michael Massee's ""Luke"", pulled off more competently, I might add. Everything about Johansen's one major scene seems to be so contrived and pointless; even the lines and reactions by the other actors. The pace of the film is almost ruined by Johansen's appearance. Why his role was brought into play is beyond me. I had to endure Johansen's part because I have only a VHS copy of the film. Hopefully, with the DVD, a viewer could just skip past it.",1283040000,,832,4.744827586206896
