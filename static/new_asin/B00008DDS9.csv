1840988,1,B00008DDS9,"Unless you're a 13-yr old boy, this movie isn't worth 10 minutes of your time - crappy characters that are a total turnoff, horrible story.

I apologize that I am unable to give you a better description of this movie so that you will avoid watching this but I am at a loss for words this movie sucks on so many levels.",1349481600,,318,4.129032258064516
1840989,4,B00008DDS9,"After a REALLY bad day, boy meets girl and they have an instant spark.  Due to a ""climate intervention"", boy loses girl's phone number.  Eventually boy finds girl but she is miserable and he must find out what is wrong and make her happy again.  In the process, he comes across girl# 2 and he must make a choice.

A young, unknown Jennifer Morrison (House, MD) alone makes this worth watching!",1273363200,,393,4.492957746478873

1840991,4,B00008DDS9,"well, at least 10.

100 Women I think is a follow up to 100 Girls which was a movie I loved and when I heard this was somewhat a sequl, I threw it over the counter of Blockbuster.

So this guy loses his girlfriend and is having a bad day and he meets this chick who was fun, exciting and made him laugh (gotta love a women who just takes her bra off to make a sling shot to fling rocks at the guys ex girlfriends window..whoops, spoiler...euh, sue me)

And after they have spent the eveing having fun, she gives him her phone number and she goes home. But the guy loses the phone number on behalf of the rain... so he decides to become a delivery boy in hopes he will find her. (hey, its what you and I would do, right?)

And eventualy he finds his fair maiden... only something happend and shes all depressed and doesnt wana know him. So he bugs her everyday and then accidently falls in love with her best friend and then then the end wasn't qiet what I thought it shoudl be, but heh, what can you do?

The movie is funny, sweet & romantic but not overdone in that mushy way, its done so that even the guys will enjoy this film... unless your a neanderthol who beleives Rambo is the most romantic movie ever.

The humor is great, original (i think) and moves along nicely I thought.

Give it a rent at least, it's not gonnah kill you.",1139961600,5,1336,4.135135135135135
1840992,5,B00008DDS9,"Like it has been said before in other reviews, the movie ""100 Women"" has nothing to do with the movie ""100 Girls."" They are written and directed by the same person, but that is all that really links the movies together. There are a lot of things about this movie that make it one of the best unknown comedies around. The cast of characters is a relatively small and unknown one, however everyone in the movie plays their parts perfectly. My hat goes off to LGF for once again bringing us one of the best comedies around.

The movie follows Sam, who's an art student who is in despair over his favorite teacher telling him that he has no hope of being an artist. Sam is all but ready to give up his dream, until a young woman named Hope comes across his path one day, and decides to cheer him up. The two instantly hit it off, and Hope writes her phone number on Sam's hand. Unfortunately it is raining and the number gets washed off. Sam then has to find Hope again. When he finally does encounter her, there's something far different about her personality. She's not the genial girl he met in the road, and now he is determined to help her ""get her smile back"". Along the way Sam ends up finding love in the last place he would have expected to. Just like ""100 Girls"" there's plenty of memorable dirty jokes and scenes and gags(including an epic snot shooting battle, a burping fight, a chinese finger trap gone wrong, and a girl who uses her pager for something totally different than you would think), and the cast is very likeable. There's also a lot of social commentary on our society and our stereotypes. These are meld together to make one of the best underground comedies I've seen in quite sometime.

This is highly recommended for anyone who was a fan of ""100 girls"" or ""8 Days A week"", or anyone who is into romantic comedies, who can be as soft as they are dirty. All in all I think most will find themselves satisfied by the viewing experience, and maybe even find one of their newest favorite movies. While I still prefer ""100 Girls"" (but then again I probably always will) that doesn't detract anything from this movie. Snag a copy today and start enjoying the laughs right away.",1129680000,7,2195,4.430693069306931
1840993,5,B00008DDS9,my brother bought a used copy at wal mart and I decided to borrow it despite him saying it was stupid. It isn't. It's actually real funny and entertaining.,1110067200,,155,4.379310344827586
1840994,5,B00008DDS9,"First of all, I've been a fan of Chad Donella for some while now, and the main reason I saw this movie was basically because he was in it. At the beginning of the movie, I saw some sexual things, and I thought it was going to be one of those over-the-top teen movies about sex and nudity. It may be very sexual (and some of the things seem incredibly stupid), but in the progress of the film, you see Sam, an art student, in his quest to find out why his friend Hope ""lost her smile,"" (and seems obssesed by it), how he finds love somewhere he never imagined. It's a cute and somewhat unique love story, but the teen-ish essence is notable in some parts.
It's definitely NOT for the young. It has crude sexual humor and brief nudity.",1073433600,17,733,4.205673758865248
1840995,5,B00008DDS9,"This movie ""100 Women"" is by the maker of ""100 girls"" but they are two separate movies. Each are realistic in their depiction of a young man seeking genuine love & sex but this movie is about Sam who's a dexterity-challenged art student having the worst day of his life when a streak of fate & a gust of wind blows Hope ( a young woman )across his path. Hope cheers him up- restoring his faith in life. The next time the Sam meets Hope-she's living in a woman's residence & is irreversibly depressed. Sam embarks on a mission to restore her zest for life. Along the way, Sam finds the smile he's been looking for in the last place he thought he would ever find it. Chad Donella,Erinn Bartlett,Jennifer Morrison, Clint Howard, Steve Monroe. By the Writers & directors of "" 8 days a Week"" & "" 100 Girls"". It's a Sexy-Sexual Romantic Comedy with a love for love & a love for life & a Male's View of Loving Women and loving A woman.",1051574400,26,928,4.278409090909091
1840996,4,B00008DDS9,"At first, I thought it is another B-movie about horny, out of control, college kids experiencing life. Well, it is, except, it is not a B-movie, and it is funny! The not well-known cast of 100 Women adds to the movie. There are no stereotypes about the characters only about the story.
A very bright and likable student is on a mission to find a girl he met in a blackout. His problem; he doesn't know who she is or what she looks like! He leaves no stone unturned in his effort to find that girl, the girl of his dreams. In the process, a co-ed friend talks him into cross-dressing to understand what a women experience. This experience actually helps him mature in a college way, and develops respect for women realizing how men can be so primitive. Shame on males for being so primitive acting the way they do! Like we needed another movie to confirm what we already know. 100 Women is another movie about college kids experiencing their liberation from parents. However, this movie unlike similar movies works. 100 Women is worth watching. There are many memorable one-liners will keep you laughing. This movie is worthy of it R rating and parental guidance is strongly advised.",1044921600,8,1182,4.633333333333334

1840998,3,B00008DDS9,"For the most part, 100 women seemed like it had two distinct writers, one that did the subtle, nuanced lovely scenes with the protagonist and the women in the film, and another who did the over-the-top low-brow scenes between the protagonist and the other men in the film. In the end, this dichotomy was supposed to illustrate the protagonist's epiphany, but the male-on-male scenes really didn't have to be as stupid as they were to do this. If the writer could have reined it in a little for the latter scenes, I would have found the movie much more enjoyable and a potential for rewatching. As is, I wouldn't watch it again.",1453507200,,627,4.607142857142857
1840999,1,B00008DDS9,"stopped at 25 minutes, the booger scene. Just too darn old to think garbage like that is funny. A film full of BS and maybe some acid while the productionr really seemed to cave on sound and timing; every ;laugh had to be predetermined...set the best one up by botching or have the  screenwriter fight director over the white stuff...seriously, you'd have to be on serious drugs to watch this mess all the way through.
Pitiful attempts to display taunting images, I assume to let the boy meet girl concept have a chance.  Fail.
Maybe not enough film editing, directing...nope, read the production portion. Set it all up, it still doesn't feel right.
Did not help that the soundtrack was annoying and too loud.  Distracting.
Finally, not enough credibility from the 1/3 of the film I finished. I'm giving back one star because that was my mistake.
So 2 stars, really one without my impulse control.",1453075200,,897,4.737179487179487

1841024,2,B00008DDS9,"Normally you would expect such a film to be either funny or romantic. This one is nothing of it.
Lots of women with complexes but no story is really told enough in depth.
The film jumps from topic to topic without good transitions.

It would have been better to reduce the number to 10 women but go into more depth with these.

Now to the fun, simply there is none. The director tries to use loathing to generate attraction but fails in my opinion.

I will definitely not watch it again, what I normally would do with either romantic or funny movies.",1371859200,,550,4.372549019607843
