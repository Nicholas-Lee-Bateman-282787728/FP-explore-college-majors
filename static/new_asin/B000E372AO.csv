8105246,1,B000E372AO,"I missed the first part of the documentary when it viewed on A&E, and was thrilled to see that I could actually purchase it from Amazon, and have it for my very own. Face To Face is such a heartwarming film about 2 conjoined twins who are able to go through life as individuals, respecting each other for their differences, regardless of the fact that they will forever

share some of the same body parts. What a lesson in cooperation! The film gets a little long, when showing other people's reactions and opinions, which is not necessary, but is all worth waiting for the finale where they are leading the serpentine,singing and dancing through Central Park.",1156464000,,660,4.689655172413793
