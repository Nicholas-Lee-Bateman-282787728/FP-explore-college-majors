1410012,5,B00005A094,"Over the years ECW had done many Pay Per Views with extreme hardcore stuff, but Barely Legal is like comparing ECW to WCW. ;yeah really its that good;
Here is the card The Dudley Boyz vs. The Eliminators This is a great match with many spots and aerial maneuvers. 7/10
Rob Van Dam vs. Lance Storm This was one of my favorite matches with great technical wrestling, another high flying match 9/10
Great Sasuke, Gran Hamada, and Masato Yakushiji vs. Taka Michinoku, Mens Teoh, and Dick Togo This was my favorite match of the night that had unbelivable japan wrestling moves. 10/10
Shane Douglas vs. Pitbull #2  This is the boring match of the night but it did have some surprise guest during the match 5/10
Taz vs. Sabu I honestly don't know why everybody thinks this match is so good, I mean sure there was great wrestling and spots but this is Sabu were talking about, compared to his other matches with Sandman this was a sleeper. 7/10
Stevie Richards vs. The Sandman vs. Terry Funk this was a good match and the wrestlers made good use of the ladder and barbed wire, this was one of terry funks most Memorable matches. 9/10
Terry Funk vs. Raven The main event after the three way were raven beats on a beat up Terry Funk, great match and I bet big dick dudley wishes he was never there. 8/10
There is only one special feature and that is the match histories which isn't the greatest but its better than nothing.
This DVD is great and has every thing, hardcore, aerial, technical and just plain crazy.  Overall mark 8/10  Highly Recommended",989280000,5,1541,4.516129032258065
1410013,5,B00005A094,"... this is a classic DVD that showcases great wrestling .. so there's something for everybody. Sabu vs Taz was my personal favorite because of the hatred these two have for each other. It all started when Sabu no showed an event and Taz had to defend the tag belt with sub partner Rick Steiner. Taz called out Sabu, but Sabu never showed until a year later. The last event ECW had was in Pine Bluff Arkansas, you can order it....  If you want to see ECW style action, then check out the next rising league Combat Zone Wrestling. They have Great wrestling... with todays rising stars.",989020800,,584,4.457943925233645
1410014,5,B00005A094,"Here it is.  Definitely a piece of ECW history.  Though the promotion is now officially dead (having filed for bankruptcy), this DVD marks ECW's crowning moment:  Its first ever Pay-Per View held on April 13, 1997.  The DVD itself is not overly great but it is decent.  Unlike the other ECW DVD's, this one does not have ""exclusive"" DVD features aside from match histories for the pay-per-view.  However, this is definitely a great collector's item when you look at the big picture of ECW history, and in fact, wrestling history.  Seven great matches fill this card.  Here they are:
1. The Eliminators vs. The Dudley Boyz:  One-sided affair that was pretty much a spot fest showcase for Saturn and Kronus.  AWESOME displays of martial arts and aerial maneuvers, including three (3) Total Eliminations. 4 stars.
2. Chris Candido promo.
3. Lance Storm vs. Rob Van Dam:  Great match between two premier talents.  Great contest mixing sound technical, mat wrestling and aerial spots.  4 1/2 stars.
4. Michinoku Pro 6 Man Action - Great Sasuke, Gran Naniwa, Masato Yakushiji vs. TAKA Michinoku, Mens ""Terry Boy"" Teioh and Dick Togo.  At first, it would seem odd that ECW's debut pay-per-view would feature NON-ECW stars.  However, ECW, among other things, has always been known for its unmatched in-ring product in terms of pure athleticism.  Let me tell you, these puroresu sensations deliver that and a whole lot more in this all out war.  GREAT ACTION with tons of mat wrestling, aerial maneuvers, martial arts, double team and triple team maneuvers.  Fans of puroresu know that the in ring product in Japan is light years ahead what American audiences see on a weekly basis.  Ironically, later on Taka, Teioh and Togo (along with Funaki) formed Kaientai in the WWF.  It is ironic to think that this talented group went on to become comedy relief jobbers and their awesome skills never displayed.  What a shame. 5 stars.
5. ""Franchise"" Shane Douglas (with Francine) vs. Pitbull 2:  TV Title match.  This match was the culmination of a bitter feud between the Franchise and the Pitbull tag team.  Decent, hard fought bout that saw Douglas use just about everything.  Plus, ""guest appearances"" by Pitbull 1, Chris Candido, ""Primetime"" Brian Lee and ""Ravishing"" Rick Rude.
6. Sabu vs. Taz: ""Grudge Match of the Century."" GREAT match with tons of great mat wrestling, high spots and good ring psychology.  Plus an appearance by Rob Van Dam and the shocking turn that led to the formation of one of ECW's best heel stables.  Five stars.
7. Terry Funk vs. The Sandman vs. Big Stevie Cool (guest color commentator, ""The Innovator of Violence"" Tommy Dreamer):  Three-way Dance to determine the number one contender to the Heavyweight championship.  Great hardcore, hard-hitting action including a ladder and barbed wire.  Plus, an appearance by the bWo including, Da Blue Guy, Hollywood Nova, and 7-11.  5 stars.
8. ECW Heavyweight Champion Raven vs. Terry Funk:  A fresh Raven seeks to keep his heavyweight title against a brutally injured Funk.  Plus, appearances by Tommy Dreamer and Big Dick Dudley.  5 stars.
Overall, a great event.  The ""Match Histories"" were written by Michael Johnson II, the same guy who wrote the wrestler bios for the other ECW DVDs and the ECW website.  While not earth-shattering, they give a good background behind the storylines that led up to this pay-per-view and are well worth a read if you were not following ECW at the time.  Plus, they set a good tone for you as you watch the pay-per-view.  Read them before you watch the matches.
Overall this is a decent card and a decent DVD.  It is definitely worth watching.  Is it worth owning though?  For pure historical value I say yes.  It's definitely a collector's item.
Recommended.",987984000,2,3758,4.9
1410015,4,B00005A094,"Great show and for the hardcore fan as we reach the nirvana of ppv for the little promotion that could.  That show was not available in Canada and my VHS copy I got later on was so and so. So I'm proud to put this great moment of history in my DVD collection. Now that the page is turn since the bankrupty of ECW, relive the hope of one of ECW best show of all time. Get a good early look at now WWF superstars like, TAZZ, Dudley Boyz, Saturn, Steven Richard and Raven.  That is the show they talk about and show backstage footage in Beyhond the Mat. The only drawback is that for a DVD they could have added extra stuff like matches angle leading up to the event or interviews.  But the match bio is great and informative.  A must for the ECW fan, who will get a little choked up hearing the fans opening the show yelling ECW, ECW , ECW like we were going to take over the wrestling business.  We didn't with ECW but the ideal of ECW lives on everywhere in the world of pro wrestling.  Always remember why by owning this great show.",987724800,,1033,4.114427860696518
1410016,4,B00005A094,"Even though this DVD has yet to be released, I was lucky enough to see ECW's first pay-per-view event already.  Although it was not a perfect outing for ECW, it is definitely worth buying because there were a lot of memorable moments.  In the opening match, the Dudley Boyz [WWF] challenge the Eliminators (Perry Saturn [WWF] & John Kronus) for the ECW Tag Team titles.  Next, Rob Van Dam replaces an injured Chris Candido when he takes on Lance Storm [WCW].  My personal favorite match of the night is a six-man tag team extravanganza starring superstars from Japan's Michinoku Pro.  The Great Sasuke, Gran Hamada, and Masato Yukushiji (subbing for Gran Naniwa) face Taka Michinoku [WWF], Mens Teioh, and Dick Togo.  In an easily forgettable match, Shane Douglas [WCW] defended his ECW Television title against Pitbull #2.  In a match that had been built up for quite some time, Sabu took on Taz [WWF] in a classic encounter.  The Sandman, Terry Funk [WCW], and Stevie Richards [WWF] battled in a match to determine who would get an ECW Heavyweight title shot.  The winner of that match took on Raven for the title in the next and final match of the night.  I really enjoyed this event and would recommend it to any wrestling fan to purchase on DVD.  Even big fans of the WWF and WCW will recognize many superstars who appeared on this show.  I gave the show four stars out of five only because of the Shane Douglas vs. Pitbull #2 mess that should have never taken place especially for as long as it did.",984268800,3,1505,4.595505617977528
1410020,5,B00005A094,"Barely Legal was the first ECW event to be held LIVE on PPV, a make or break event in every sense of the word. Obviously, all was a success and ECW went on to run until it's demise in 2001. From the beginning of the show until the dramatic ending, you'll watch nothing but intense action and pro wrestling at it's best. A big recommendation. Great if you're a huge ECW fan as well as if you'd like to get a taste of what the Philly-based promotion was all about.",1121299200,,462,4.144444444444445
1410021,3,B00005A094,"On April 13th of 1997, the now-defunct Extreme Championship Wrestling launched its first pay-per-view. It was headlined by the highly-anticipated first encounter between Taz and Sabu. It also featured Terry Funk battling his way through a ""Triple Threat"" match to eventually face Raven for the ECW World Title. Other highlights from this amazing show included Rob Van Dam declaring himself to the highest bidder, Rick Rude finally unmasking, and the Eliminators winning the ECW world tag team titles.
""Barely Legal"" wasn't the greatest ECW event in history but it did have its share of cool moments. An unscheduled match between future WWF alumni Rob Van Dam and Lance Storm had its entertaining moments though Lance displayed some of the poorest chair work I've ever seen. This should be noted as to the match where Van Dam's major push as ""Mr. Monday Night"" began. Fans of the more aggressive Japanese style of wrestling will love the Michanoku Pro six-man tag. The very underrated Taka Michanoku, who was never used properly during his WWF stint put on a hell of a show with the rest of the guys. And what would an ECW show be without the ""Queen Of Extreme"" Francine and Beulah on it? They appear on seperate ocassions, Francine during Douglas' match with Pit-Bull #2 and Beulah before the start of the main event but they both come out looking amazing as always.
While the event itself was incredible, this DVD presentation is average at best. In addition to the fact that most of the promos and backstage interviews that aired during the original broadcast are not included, most of the entrance music has either been altered or removed entirely. The Sandman's entrance originally had hundreds of fans singing along to Metallica's ""Enter Sandman"". Since they had to replace it with the Motorhead cover version, you don't get to experience what truly was a great ECW fan moment. Since this is really the only version of the event on the retail market, you will have to settle with it or try to track down an original copy of the pay-per-view.",1082851200,5,2046,4.848571428571429
1410022,1,B00005A094,"1. Eliminators vs. Dudleys - Om my God, sad, agh, barf. Terrible match, miscommunications, botches the works. High Point: 450 splash from...either Saturn or the other dude, nicely landed. Low Point: The rest of the match. 3/10
2. RVD vs. Lance Storm - If anything worse than the first, VanDam hits the Fivestar Storm kickout. THE LAMEST CHAIR SHOT IN HISTORY is included in this epic battle. High Point: Fivestar. Low Point: Storms chair shot. 2/10
3. Little Dude 6 man thang - The fly around, people interfere It all gets to crazy to follow. High Point: One of the many High flying moves. Low Point: One of the many MISSED high flying moves. 2.5/10
4. Shane Douglas vs. Pitbull 2 - Worst match of the night, boring horrible wrestling from both men. Watching this match you wonder how either of these guys became professional wrestler. High Point: None. Low Point: Missed drop on barricade. 0.5/10
5. Taz vs. Sabu - From these two I expected better, Sabu is one of my all time favs and Taz always outs on a good show. Missed moves, sad excuse of a match. God, common guys! High Point: Sabu springboard into crowd. Low Point: Messed up table splash from Sabu. 4/10
6. Sandman vs. Terry Funk vs. Big Stevie Cool - Best match of the night, and so far the only reason I have stayed to watch it all is cuz I had nothing better too do. Sandman is fat, he keeps leaving, Stevie cool is lame, Funk is old. Funk gets a bad cut on his side during match. High Point: Sandman covering himself in barbed wire and leg droping Funk. Low Point: Sandman missing a ladder flip sending it crashing down on his own head.
7. Raven vs. Terry Funk - Might have been better if Funk had actually been able to wrestle. As it was a carry on from the 3 way Funk didn't do much more then stagger and fall down. High Point: Dreamer ""chokeslaming"" Papa Dudley or whoever through 3 tables Low Point: Funk not being able to actually wrestle. 3/10
Overall, it stunk. Plain and simple. Don't buy this on VHS or DVD. Neither one improves the wrestlers talent.",1060905600,3,2023,4.440860215053763

All the matches are very good but very different so there is a match that all wrestling fans will like because of the show's diversity.  The reason the dvd gets 4 stars is because the match between Shane Douglas (the most over-rated wrestler of all time) and Pitbull 2 is incredibly boring and hard to watch.  My advice is to just skip over this match because it is just terrible.  Nevertheless this is a great dvd.,1034121600,,477,4.448275862068965

1410028,3,B00005A094,"This was ECW's very first PPV, and it was a damn good one too, but not great. All of the matches were pretty good but the ""grudge match of the century"" between Sabu & Taz was a huge let down. It was slow and boring and the fans didn't really get into it that much either. Sabu didn't even seem into it for some reason. However, the betrayal after the matchup is shocking to say the least. The main event was a little more interesting but still could've been better: The Sandman vs. Terry Funk vs. Steven Richards in a three-way dance. It had its moments and I still watch it sometimes. Terry Funk won the matchup and went on to face Raven for the ECW World Heavyweight title. Terry Funk gets really bloody and seems to be losing big time, that is, until Tommy Dreamer interferes and hits Raven w/ a DDT. Terry Funk pins Raven to become the new ECW Champion at 53 years of age! Tommy Dreamer chokeslams Big Dick Dudley off of the balcony through 3 stacked tables, to which commentator Joey Styles screams a long ""OHHHHHHHH, MYYYYYYYY, GODDDDDDDDDD!!!!!!"" This pay-per-view had its moments and some pretty cool matches. It's worth buying if you like trashy hardcore wrestling.

1410049,5,B00005A094,"On April 1997, ECW broke through all rival promotions to present the most grueling PPV of the year, ""Barely Legal"" 1997. Although lacking the pomp and grandiose of Wrestlemania, ""Barely Legal"" easily held on its own with terrific hardcore action and ooh-ahh spots that had everyone on the edge of their seats.
1.) Eliminators vs. Dudley Boyz- This is a near-total squash, but what a beautifully done squash! Perry Saturn and John Kronos deliver their most perfect performance ever with a never-ending array of somersaults and brain-busting double-team kicks! This may be more like a Ringling Brs. Circus spectacle than an actual wrestling match, but you will be amazed of the pace so much that you can only thirst for more ECW! ****
2.) Lance Storm vs. Rob Van Dam- The fans on this show don't give enough credit to either man in one of their numerous encounters together. If you think Jerry Lynn is Rob's most common opponent, then you've flat out missed Storm. Both men are harassed with boos and curses on all sides (Lance because he makes [poor]chair shots, and Rob because he messes up some maneuvers with the ropes). Besides that, a healthy does of technical, mid-air mayhem, supplied with plenty of innovative ideas with chairs, makes this match one for fans of Storm and Van Dam. Now that both men are in the WWF, expect them to be the next rivalry since Rock & Austin or Benoit & Jericho. ****1/2
3.) Michinoku Pro- Remember Taka Michinoku, from WWF's Kaientai? If you're one of those people who thinks he's a [bad]c Japanese goof-off, you haven't see him back in the days as part of the Lucha-style Michinoku Pro promotion. Along with Dick Togo and Mens Teioh, Taka faces off against Masato Yakushuji, Gran Naniwa, and the greatest Japanese luchadore ever, Grand/Great Sasuke, in the most stratospheric battle you might have ever seen. Forget RVD, these guys take airborne to new heights! It seems ever minute, at least two men are jumping over each other to get the better hand (or foot) over the other. Moonsaults, Lionsaults, Suicide Dives, Triple-team Slams, Piledrivers, Tornado DDTs, Senton Splashes...the list of air moves goes on and on, and that's coming from a cast of fighters with a half of them weighing over 240 pounds! If you are to see only one tag team wrestling match in your entire life, make it this one! This is match of the night. *****++
4.) Shane Douglas vs. Pitbull #2- You've seen one match between these guys, you've seen them all...That's the best I could say about this confrontation for the TV title. Douglas is okay, but Pitbull #2 is awfully messy and keeps making mistakes in this match (Hence, the audience keeps chanting ""B.S."" and Pitbull #2 never gets to stick around in the ECW universe for long). The closing sequences to the match are very similar to the 4 Corners TV match almost 6 months before, so if you've seen that classic, you won't be surprised who'd win this match in the end. The subplot involving a masked man is bound to confuse newbies to ECW. ***
5.) Sabu vs. Taz- Just about any ECW fan would say this match, involving the suicidal, homicidal, genocidal high-flyer Sabu and the suplexing machine Taz, is very disappointing by the standards of both men. In a way, they're right. The weardown holds Taz keeps doing to Sabu are way too long, and Sabu keeps getting too vulnerable to Taz's hits. There are a few highlight moments, though, such as Sabu's leaps off of chairs and a messed-up table spot that has him tasting wood. Hardcore Sabu/Taz fans would diss this as an amateur accomplishment, but it is important in introducing Bill Alfonso as the hilarious manager of Sabu and Sabu's partner, none other than egomaniac Rob Van Dam. ***1/2
6.) Big Stevie Cool vs. The Sandman vs. Terry Funk- The Innovator of Violence, Tommy Dreamer, sits down next to announcer Joey Styles in the hopes that mentor Terry Funk would vanquish archenemy Raven off his World Heavyweight Championship. The problem for the Funker is that he first must survive this hardcore Three-Way Dance against the popular leader of the Blue World Order and the ultimate ECW hardcore icon, and what a confrontation it is. It's a 20-minute war as chairs, tables, a ladder, a garbage can, and barb-wire streamers are the weapons of choice in this insane brawl. (How many times did the fans go ""Ooh"" when a ladder slammed down on a poor luchadore?) Highlight moments include a loud slap fest, a ladder landing on everyone's noggin every few moments, even some brutal see-saw action with the ladder thrusting up on someone's chin!) Very illogical, but truly brutal and worth looking at for its unbelievable content. ****1/4
7.) Terry Funk vs. Raven- The Funker survives the battle, but all battered and broken, he must take on a fully fresh slacker who is also the World Heavyweight Champion. This is more of a spot fest than a total wrestling match, but the story being told here is well done. Raven begins severely blading Funk with a chair, causing the 53-year old to bleed in sickening pints (Makes this THE scariest moment in this show). Although a doctor tries to help out Funk, Raven continues to assault the man with his cronies and even smashes him through a table on the outside. Raven then begins to taunt ole Tommy Dreamer that he'll end the career of Dreamer's tutor right before the Innovator. Dreamer is incensed and demands to fight Raven, until Big D. Dudley comes up and attacks him from behind. The burly Dudley then grabs Dreamer and prepares to level him with 3 stacked tables below. But Tommy kicks out and sends Big D. crashing right through the tables into unrecognizable splinters! ..Raven is stunned that the plan backfires, and suddenly, Dreamer pursues his opponent and lands Raven with a DDT! In due time, Funker is able to pin the slacker and become the first man to win the ECW World Heavyweight Championsip on a PPV! Dreamer and Funk warmly hug each other as the crowd proudly shouts, ""ECW! ECW! ECW!..."" This was just too cool an ending. ****1/4
So there you have it. The mid-card may be slightly weak, but the earlier matches and the double main-event makes this again an ECW video worth the money. You won't regret it.",1018483200,,6179,4.743494423791821

Simply AWESOME. Shane Douglas vs. Pitbull #2 SUCKS. the ending was the same as Heat Wave 96 and The Doctor Is In, which made the match even worse. Sabu vs. Taz was a great brawl, with some surprisinly good technicality. Sandman/Stevie/Funk was an all out BRAWL, with tables, chairs, ladders, barbed wire,garbage cans, a very hard hitting match. Raven vs. Funk, well, it was short, but there was a sweet bump during the match taken by Big Dick Dudley, but i won't spoil it for you.

I remember saving up money to get this on a two VHS master tape set direct from ECW (after it aired live on PPV)
This was there first PPV and it's really average and anti climatic
By this time Paul E. was already in bed with the WWF
You can tell by the booking and production of this PPV (it's Not ECW)
It looks like a typical WWF/WCW PPV
Because of the ""Mass Transit"" incident PPV companies were gun shy about getting in bed with Extreme Championship Wrestling
Which i find a little hinky since during this time UFC (was close to underground pit fighting) and PPV have been airing hardcore adult content prior to 1997.....
So why would this first PPV be so bland and lacking any real ECW spirit
Also the ring that is used during this event is terrible it's to lose and look like a trampoline when they try to move
The first time i seen this back in 1997/1998 i was shocked how average it was

Matches:
The Eliminators vs The Dudley Boyz (ECW World Tag Team Championship) Less then 5 months later Perry Saturn would end up on WCW Nitro and join Raven's group
Rob Van Dam vs Lance Storm (This is one of Storm's first appearances in ECW)
The Great Sasuke, Gran Hamada and Masato Yakushiji1 vs bWo Japan (Taka Michinoku, Terry Boy and Dick Togo) Great Japanese Style stiff match why it was on here who really knows it was really odd Safe filler
Shane Douglas vs Pitbull #2 (ECW World Television Championship)
Taz vs Sabu (This PPV was built around this feud/match) this fight was built for 6months maybe longer and you get here it's very anti climatic Sabu carries almost the entire match they tired to sell this match as a shoot fight but, it was done so lazily it drags on way to long
Three-Way Dance match to determine the number one contender for the ECW World Heavyweight Championship
Terry Funk vs The Sandman vs Stevie Richards (This is a solid three-way dance but, the wrong guy went over Both Sandman and Richards did a lot this is the closet Extreme style match within this PPV
Terry Funk vs Raven (ECW World Heavyweight Championship) One of the worst matches Raven ever had in ECW
This match is just terrible and makes no real sense (You can't help but, wonder if Paul Heyman made Raven drop the bell over the crucifixion incident which made Kurt Angle sign with WWF)
This PPV was a sign of things to come in ECW short lived future
This is one of there worst PPV it runs neck and neck with the last handful of PPV before ECW folded in 2001

BARLEY LEGAL

I remember it like it was yesterday, ECW was a little known up and coming promotion on the east coast [how lucky was I to be living there at the time] that over time became a cult hit and went as far as to get not only pay-per-view events locked but had a weekly show on what is now Spike TV. This was that first p-p-v, and to be honest it was not the greatest event ever, but it was historic for the little company that could.

We kick things off with Joey Styles introducing the event and being interrupted by the ECW tag champs The Dudley Boys. The crowd reaction to these two is great, and shows why the Dudleys caused so much controversy while there.

1.[ECW TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP]-DUDLEYS VS ELIMINATORS-this is a fairly quick bout here but it is definitely and exciting one, before and after the match are quite enjoyable as well. There are a lot of good high spots during this match, and surprisingly the Dudleys pretty much get dominated. The Eliminators take the titles and the win after a very entertaining match. 4/5

Here we have a nice speech by Chris Candido talking about his accomplishments in wrestling, and not being able to perform on the card. He goes on to a cool rant on a bunch of ECW wrestlers. R.I.P. Sir.

2. ROB VAN DAM VS LANCE STORM-a battle between two of the best in my opinion who ever laced up some wrestling boots. This is a really good back and forth battle between these two, Storm is the technical of the two and Van Dam is the risk taker. That combination made for an interesting battle, a lot of people don't really like this as much as I do but I thought it was great. Van Dam takes it after a good Van Daminator. What is really cool is the rant that Van Dam lets loose on everyone, this was apart of his Mr. Monday Night persona he was doing with his trips to WWF Monday Night Raw at the time. 5/5

3. GREAT SASUKE, BRAN NANIWA, MASATO YAKUSHIJI VS TERRY BOY, DICK TOGO, TAKA MICHINOKU [BWO INTERNATIONAL]-another good match up that is just as entertaining as any of the others, great showcase of other talent. I found this to be one of the most competitive bouts on the entire card. And while not as crazy as some would think this match really heats up at times and really showcases these guys well. Some of the greatest triple team moves I have seen take place during this one, one moment in particular is picture perfect. This honestly could be the most entertaining match on the card, I don't care what any one else says. Sasuke, Bran, and Masato take this well deserved win, great match. 4.5/5

4.[TV CHAMPIONSHIP]-SHANE DOUGLAS VS PITBULL # 2-I have to start out saying that Shane has always been one of my favorite heels in ECW, he really can get under peoples skin and I love it. In this fight Shane puts the TV title on the line against fan favorite Pitbull # 2. This one is ok, it really is interesting more because of the story line that was involved. It is not a boring match it was just not the best on the card, the end though is great. Brian Lee and Ravishing Rick Rude take Shane out, great ending. 3.5/5

5. SABU VS TAZ-this is the match that everyone wanted to see, and Taz wanted this one badly. These two extreme legends went at it in a match that was more technical then extreme, don't get me wrong it had hardcore moments. This was a great match I don't care what people say, people may hate on it because their first battle wasn't an all out extreme bout. Me personally I think that is what made this a classic, it wasn't what people expected. And after Taz wins this excellent match there is a great aftermath involving RVD.5/5

6. TERRY FUNK VS THE SANDMAN VS STEVIE RICHARDS-ever heard of a man from Texas named Terry Funk, if yes you probably heard of this match. This is one of those matches that is credited as one that made ECW what it was because of the Funker. This is by no stretch of the imagination a classic wrestling match, this is a wild brawl that makes good use of a ladder. Many fans love this match, I one of them and think it was highly entertaining. Funk goes one to win this extreme match up and get a shot at the championship. Good solid fight, and very entertaining. 4.5/5

7.[ECW CHAMPIONSHIP]-RAVEN VS TERRY FUNK-Raven comes and attacks Terry right after he wins his last match. This is a match full of emotion, the fans are really into this one and keep Terry alive really. Raven really puts it on Funk in this one, and Funk is bleeding like crazy. Tommy Dreamer [an all fav of mine] is doing commentary during this match to continue his feud with Raven. And after Raven calls him out Dreamer is attacked by a Dudley, but turns it around and throws Dudley off of the balcony. After which he takes out Raven and Funk becomes the new ECW champ. I will give this one five out of five because the atmosphere and emotion of this bout were crazy. 5/5

So there it is, I am sure a lot of people will disagree with some of this but that is my opinion. I found this to be a very entertaining event, and while it is not the best event held by ECW it has a special feeling about it. You can tell these guys were doing every thing they could to make this enjoyable. To all those who worked in front of or behind the scenes of ECW, I salute you for your efforts.",1221091200,,5259,4.280684104627767

(Note-Each DVD I review has a ""Match of the DVD"" award somewhere in it.)

ECW Barely Legal 1997
ECW finally gets on PPV. This is one of the most historic events in ECW history. Most of the matches are average, but historically this is a show that you'll want to find somewhere. If you are someone that is just looking for some great wrestling, this is not the best DVD to pick up.

Before the event Joey Styles begins telling you about the night's events. He is quickly cut off by the Dudley Boys. The Dudleys and Joel Gertner cut a promo that is basically talking about how great the Dudleys are.

ECW Tag Team Championships
The Dudleys(c) VS The Eliminators
The Dudleys get some good offence in the beginning, but after that they are dominated the entire rest of the match. One thing that really bothers me about this match is that there are barely any attempts for a pin. Kronus of The Eliminators hits a 450 Splash and just keeps on doing moves without a pin. Regardless, this match does work as a good opener. There are a ton of highflying moves in this match. There is no tagging in the match and it works more like a tornado tag match.
RATING- 7/10

After this match you are introduced to Sandman via a video package.

Chris Candido comes out after the video to explain why he was taking off the card. He is injured, but claims he will be back later.

Lance Storm VS Rob Van Dam
Rob Van Dam replaces Candido in this match up. Look at Lance Storm's hair. He has a blonde mullet and it looks ridiculous. This is a strong match with plenty of action. Again, there is a lack of pins in this match. There is a good mixture of action, but nothing that will stand out in your mind.
RATING- 6.5/10

RVD proceeds to cut a promo about how angry he is about not being booked to begin with. RVD implies that he wishes to go elsewhere to wrestle.

International Six-Man Tag Match
Great Sasuke/Gran Hamada/Masato Yakushiji VS Terry Boy/Dick Togo/Taka Michinoku
Michinoku Pro Wrestling invades ECW to put on a pretty good tag team bout. Unlike the first match on the evening, this match does not work under tornado rules. Only one wrestler from a team is usually in the ring. Sasuke, Yakushiji, Terry Boy, and Taka provide a lot of speed and energy to the contest. Togo and Hamada bring a power game. This match has a few slow points, but overall is a fun match to watch. If you've never seen Sasuke before, watch out for him.
RATING- 7.5/10

Stevie Richards cuts a promo about shedding his old image in tonight's main events.

ECW World Television Championship
Shane Douglas w/Francine VS Pitbull #2
This is the first match of the night to really tell a story. Sadly, it is an incredibly boring story. Shane broke the neck of Pitbull #1; now Pitbull #2 wants revenge. There is also a story of a mysterious masked man coming out to confront Shane. Both men try to work over the other man's neck. This is the first match that weapons come into play as well. The match is a very slow pace.
RATING- 5.5/10

After the match, a masked man comes to the ring. The masked man is revealed to be Brian Lee. Rick Rude attacks Shane Douglas from behind.

You also get a wonderful Raven promo in between these matches. This is one of my personal favorite promos.

ECW Grudge Match
Taz w/ Bill Alfonso VS Sabu
Right next to Dreamer/Raven, this is probably ECW's biggest feud. Taz had been calling Sabu out for a long time and now they are finally going to hook it up. This match is disappointing though. Most of the match has Taz on the offensive and beating down Sabu. In the end, Sabu had gotten little offence and ended up loses the match to a poor looking Tazzmission. There is some decent brawling, but these two have both had much better matches.
RATING- 7/10

3-Way Dance (Match of the DVD)
#1 Contender for the ECW World Heavyweight Championship
Terry Funk VS Sandman VS Stevie Richards
The winner of this match will battle against Raven for the ECW title directly after this match. You will see both matches. This will be a rating of both combined since they are for the most part. The 3-way is really good. There are some brutal shots, including Sandman throwing a ladder into the ring and it landing right on Funk. Very solid match with the right person winning. Raven's match with the winner wasn't much. It told a great story though.

tag titles- dudley boyz (champs) vs the eliminators

great high flying match on the part of the eliminators and also the dudley's did real good, different wrestling than they usually do in wwe. and if u only seen saturn in wwe, you're missing out. the dudley's dominated in the beginning. doing a suplex body press and bubba did some good slams, one was a tilt- a- whirl, but every time he did a move it was called bubba something, like bubba called every single move his own, same with saturn and a normal moonsault. anyway kronus, a big guy, was flying around with a spinning heel kick, cartwheel moonsault to the outside, handspring elbow to the corner, and a 450 splash, and saturn did good too with his moonsaults. then the total elimination connected and we have new champs, the eliminators. they dominated pretty much the whole match. when the ring announcer tried to say the dudley's won, they gave him the total elimination- 5/5

RVD (a fill in for chris candido) vs lance storm

this was a real good match too, lots of high flying, was impressed with storm, he's better in ecw. storm did a jumping top rope spinning elbow, the canadian maple leaf, used a chair, and kicked out of a 5 star. RVd did a somersault to the outside, vandaminator, and a standing moonsault for the win- 4.5/5, and told what he thought about being a fill in (as seen on rise and fall)

Great Sasuke, Gran Hamada, and Masato Yakushiji vs. Taka Michinoku, terry boy (a.k.a. Mens Teoh), and Dick Togo (soon to be original kaientai, debuted at over the edge 1998)known as BWO for some reason here

great high flying match, lucha libre action, taka was better here. Kaientai was doing their classic double and triple team moves, and togo doing his senton's. one of the other guys in green did a crazy headscissor arm drag. the guy dressed in black with a mask was doing backflips and such as reversals. such a competitive back and forth match that lasted awhile, u couldn't tell who would win and when it would end. but the dressed in black mask guy got a tiger suplex for the win- 5/5

television title- franchise (champ)/w/ francine vs pitbull #2

the soryline was that franchise broke the other pitbull's neck and he was at ringside in the crowd. they had a buch a security, which came in handy when gary wolfe tried to interfere, but was thrown out. boring match, franchise sporting his long hair. franchise retained his title but after everyone was awaiting rick rude, then a man jirating his hips was in the ring, franchise went after him, and from behind, desguised as a security guard was rick rude, the other man was someone from ecw and gave franchise a chokeslam- 1.5/5- for the aftermath

grudge match of the century- not- sabu vs taz

this match might have been built up big, but it was kind of a normal match, nothing too big happened. sabu went for a spinning ddt through a table, but taz reversed him through it. taz got the tazmission on sabu for the win- 2.5/5

winner advances to the title match with raven- 3 way dance elimination- terry funk vs the sandman vs stevie richards /w/ bwo

and tommy dreamer doing commentary- why?

ok match, terry did his famous ladder around the head spin, but wouldn't stop and got dizzy. the ladder was set up twice in a teeter- totter position and both times someone jumped and hit it into someone's face, but the 2nd time it flew all the way over.  stevie was doing a real good job, unlike what wwe did with him, he was kicked out of everything, even when they were double teaming him. but eventually the double team was too much after a spike pildriver and double powerbomb, he was out. it was down to sandman and funk, it had to be. sandman used a trashcan wrapped in metal. funk put sandman's shirt over his head a whipped his bear back with barbwire. the finish was funk with somewhat moonsault off the ladder- 4/5

ecw title- (champ) Raven vs terry funk

immediately after the last match raven came out. the flock came out and beat up on funk, he was bleeding profusely. raven went for the evenflow, but funk rolled him up for the win and became new champ, short match- 2/5, then the celebration and tears were on as the 1st ppv came to an end.",1152748800,,4317,4.466327827191868
7934620,5,B00005A094,"NOTE: I UPDATED THIS REVIEW IN 2013

Tag Team Champions Dudley Boyz vs. Eliminators - Dudleys attacked from behind after Sign Guy helped with a distraction (and payed for it) with them hitting some hard hitting moves like the Bubba Bomb & diving headbutt before Eliminators started making a comeback using their educated feet for various kicks & aerial offense such as the moonsault & various splash from either a backflip or 450 position along with executing both kicks & splashes from a springboard position.  This was a hot opening match that saw both teams showcase their array of offense with Eliminators diverse offensive style leaving an impression.

Lance Storm vs. Rob Van Dam - This was originally suppose to be Chris Candido vs. Lance Storm but RVD replaced Candido after he suffered an injury with Storm always remaining one step ahead in the early exchanges before RVD was finally able to catch him before both men had an aerial attack with holds like the leaping somersault dive, top rope back elbow, and moonsault press on the outside. RVD got more aggressive to the point where he brought a chair into play & threw it in Storm's face quick like a bullet followed by the running chair dropkick in the corner & frog splash but Storm kept fighting back catching him in submissions like the boston crab into a single crab before using the chair himself for holds like a Tiger Bomb & top rope legdrop onto the open chair. This was a solid match & they would go on to have better quality matches as Storm still wasn't comfortable with the ECW environment yet (as you could tell by the chairshots he gave) but this was more about the infamous speech afterwords where RVD addressed the crowds chants of ""You Sold Out!""
[Rob Van Dam: One Of A Kind]

Great Sasuke, Gran Hamaada, Masato Yakushij vs. bWo International (Taka Michinoku, Mens Teioh, Dick Togo) - This was a representation of the working relationship with Michinoku Pro Wrestling promotion in Japan to the point where Taka's team were the international members of the bWo.  The bWo started out with double & triple teaming offense while also taking to time to keep posing & taunting their opponents while Teioh was able to showcase his power with moves like the delayed vertical suplex but the other team was able to make a comeback with very fast paced offense such as a baseball side into head scissors takeover on the floor & Sasuke countering a powerbomb into frankensteiner & later a double clothesline into a moonsault press.  They traded momentum constantly with Teioh showing his strength like countering a hip toss into a DDT & later delivering a chokeslam into a powerbomb, Hamada with a top rope frankensteiner, Taka's missle dropkick to the back of the head, Sasuke with a mid-air dropkick, and the bWo continuing to double & triple team including a spike piledriver & triple man powerbomb.  This was very fast paced high speed atheltic action from start to finish.

Television Champion Shane Douglas vs. Pitbull #2 - This match had a special stipulation that the masked man who had been taunting Douglas for months would unmask himself if Douglas wins as Pitbull #1 was sitting in the front row while Douglas & Francine was escorted to the ring by a riot squad.  Pitbull #2 used power moves like clotheslines & spinkicks while trying to work over his neck from a front facelock & wrenching side headlock but Douglas was able to recover & work over Pitbull's neck with moves like the snapmare, a dropkick to the of the head, and camel clutch before Pitbull was able to launch Douglas over the top rope & through a table when Pitbull #1 made his presence known as Douglas continued to use dirty tactics along with weapons like the guardrail & a chair however Pitbull #2 continued to keep shaking off the pain with power moves like the shoulder block & powerslam causing Douglas & Francine resort to almost every single dirty tactic & weapon they could including breaking a piece of board over his head twice & Chris Candido making an appearance.  This told a good story in regards to both men focusing on each other's necks at one point along with Douglas throwing everything but the kitchen sink thrown at Pitbull who was refusing to fail but the biggest story of the match wasn't just who was the guy that was taunting Douglas for months but who was the guy under the mask that night.

Sabu vs. Taz - This was called ""The Grudge Match Of The Century"" as this match was build for over a year dating back to their issues going on 2 years earlier to the point where Sabu came straight to the ring without his typical entrance. Both men went back & forth wrestling with Taz even daring Sabu to take his leg at one point before catching him in a body scissors with vicious crossfaces that ended up breaking Sabu's nose. Sabu used this daredevil offense like the double jump springboard into the crowd followed by brawling in the audience while Taz was sticking to this wrestling like the freestyle bow & arrow stretch while also countering Sabu's offense like throwing Sabu off a swinging DDT attempt that sent Sabu through a table. Taz made his clear that he was going after Sabu's previously injured neck with his various Tazplexes that landed Sabu directly on it while even Sabu tried to beat Taz at his own game applying the Tazmission at one point. This did come off as a grudge match with how hard & stiff each other were going after each other but it was the aftermath that had everyone talking as it changed both men's careers forever.
