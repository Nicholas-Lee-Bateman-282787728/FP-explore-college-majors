8273379,5,B0019C6CLO,"I showed this documentary to a group of students and they were absolutely spellbound.  The movie recounts the story Khouri told in great detail before it starts pointing out all the holes, odd factual errors, and easily disproved lies.  Having debunked Khouri's allegedly true story, the documentary turns to investigate Khouri herself.  A world class con-artist with some powerful connections (Cheney family), Khouri is revealed as an audacious, cunning, quite possibly deranged character with a well developed petty side. It's the *degree* of her shamelessness that astonishes over and over.  The students were literally amazed.

Useful movie, actually.  Conveys important lessons about the human willingness to accept well-told stories that validate our prejudices and about the power of evidence in clarifying important issues.",1357862400,4,831,5.715447154471545
8273380,1,B0019C6CLO,"WOW!!! what were you watching??? or should I ask what were you under the influence of while you were watching??? I'll start with the question that should answer much of the rest of the so called questions you have: Is the filmmaker an honest person or is she just stepping up to the spotlight? she is definetly stepping up to the spotlight! If I was truly a con artist and wanted by the Feds or anyone else don't you think they would have arrested me by now??? also, did you miss the scene where I actually walk into the Federal building and am told I am not wanted!! or did she edit that out?? like she maybe edited out the part where I PASS yes PASS the lie detector test! ANNA made one promise prior to our trip to Jordan which she did not keep and therefore I could not keep mine to her....she promised no government officials...that may not mean a lot to you...but to people that have to live there...they will not talk on camera regarding something like this...which Jordan and the JNCW was clearly trying their best to discredit...if their names are going to be given to government officials...Anna knew that...and yet on our first day there...she asked me to give names to a government officials. at that point...the deal was off...no one wanted to talk to her. And she was obvioulsy upset. To try to show her that the so-called ""trusted"" government officials that she wanted to talk to were not trustworthy...I handed the ""coroner"" the name of a real victim...not my friend...but a real victim whose name was published in a local paper...and he claimed that he would check and see if she existed...the following day he came back and said...""no one by that name was ever killed in Jordan"" I handed him the article...Anna claimed she ran out of film????

I live and work in the US, I am not in hiding...if I am wanted I would be easily found....oh and by the way...look at the wonderful so called list of factual errors...we didn't carry that brand of cigarettes in Jordan in the year I claimed to have smoked them there is one....do you really think the book was intended to give you knowledge about waht cigarettes existed at that time???? This book was intended to create international awareness of Honor Killing which was happening in Jordan, and the laws that exist in the Jordanian penal code which allow them to continue...Rana Husseini who was busy calling me a liar...is now quoting the same statistics in her book and on her site that were in my book years prior. Open your eyes and take a real look at what is happening...pasted below is one readers opinion of Rana's book from amazon:

The problem lies in the way Husseini approaches the book. This isn't about honor killings; it's about Rana Husseini and her heroic, courageous crusade against them. Now, call me a curmudgeon, but I'd rather decide for myself whether someone's actions are courageous and heroic than have this asserted -- repeatedly -- by the author about herself. She's leading a movement to fight honor killings, which has certainly landed her in some hot water at home in Jordan (although she certainly has a number of very significant allies in the shape of members of the Jordanian royal family.) But comparing the tone of this book to that of Somaly Mam in her memoir of sexual slavery The Road of Lost Innocence: The True Story of a Cambodian Heroine is jarring. Mam -- who was herself a victim and has moved on to campaign for basic human rights for women in a different but equally important area -- never comes across as self-congratulatory. In contrast, by the time I was 25 pages into this book, I was already weary of Husseini patting herself on the back.

All I will say is she spent 15 years writing articles in english in an english language paper available only in an arabic country about honor killings???? It was not even available on the internet at that time??? most men committing honor killings more than likely did not read or even speak english??? Do you think she made a huge impact?? you be the judge...let me guess...you enjoyed the Jordan Times with your morning Joe??? yea I thought sooo

PS I have never worked as a real estate agent...and Mary was taken into a nursing home by the State while I was not even here...I was never assigned her care...she was diagnosed with dementia, and alzheimers by the State and taken into their care by force years after I left the country, and years after anything occured between me and her.

8273381,5,B0019C6CLO,"Norma Khouri wrote a book by the name ""Forbidden Love"" as the true story of her Jordanian friend: Dalia who supposedly was killed by her family for falling in love with a Christian.

""Forbidden love"" that deals with honor killing in the Middle East, made huge noise when released especially after 9/11, when every Arabic person is seemingly under suspicion as a potential terrorist.

""Forbidden lies"" is a documentary that reveals the falseness of this story by Norma Khouri, who lived most of her life in the United States and is involved in many fraud cases in the United States and England. The documentary also interviews women in Jordan who live in total freedom and great lives of coexistence and marriages with Christian neighbors. As a result of this documentary, the fabricated book that was written as a memoir was pulled off the shelves in Australia and England.

It's very important that this documentary was made or else, the vultures will keep spreading lies and using the constant state of chaos around the world to make money.",1251072000,7,1042,4.875706214689266
8273382,5,B0019C6CLO,"wow, Norma, you big con artist you, from the outset you will feel for this woman, untill you get 20 mins into the documentary & that's when you want to meet her & shake the truth out of her...did she really have a friend that was killed by her father?? NO SHE DID NOT...writting about an honor killing of her best friend in Jordan by her father.. the truth is about the only thing she doesn't give us....watch this doc it is very good",1225756800,7,434,4.178571428571429
