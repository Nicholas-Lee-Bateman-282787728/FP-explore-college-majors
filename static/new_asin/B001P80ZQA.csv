8332485,5,B001P80ZQA,"The Silverton-Ouray area is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen, so I bought this just to enjoy the back-roads that were not part of visit there. I wasn't disappointed, even though this trip didn't make it all the way to Ouray.

There was a caravan of 8-10 vehicles that drove expertly on the rugged roads and through streams. It was a steady, purposeful ride, stopping frequently at different historic abandoned mines. We got a close guided tour of the old buildings, some of the the actual mines and some barracks or quarters where people either stayed all seasons of the year or, in at least one case, left en masse every year to spend the Winter elsewhere. This area would not be accessible during Winter.

If you love this area or if you're looking for great places for a 4-wheeler adventure, OR if you are interested in Colorado history, mining, etc., you will probably enjoy this off-highway adventure. I did enjoy it because I love the area.",1273536000,2,954,4.6390532544378695
