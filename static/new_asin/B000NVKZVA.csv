8182019,4,B000NVKZVA,"Not as in depth as I thought it would be for the price I paid for the movie.  Still, I can appreciate how he summed up and simplified the core concepts of good nutrition.  Seemed to be geared more toward longevity.",1395878400,,214,4.195121951219512

8182022,5,B000NVKZVA,"First can I say that I'm shocked that this has so few reviews. The information on this DVD is priceless and will help you live a much healthier lifestyle.

I love anything by Dr. Weil and this program was no exception. Dr. Weil encourages the viewer to eat an anti-inflammatory diet. He also explains why it is OK to eat carrots and beets. Basically he talks about macronutrients and micronutrients. He also spends some time explaining why you should take a look at a glycemic index and a glycemic load chart. These are easy to find online and you can print a few out. As Dr. Weil points out brown rice cakes are worse than white sugar.

Dr. Weil also talks about how you should balance each meal with carbs, fat and protein. He does say to avoid saturated fats but I personally only eat a small amount of butter daily so I'm not worried about it. Plus health experts are now saying that some saturated fats are good for the brain. Dr. Weil does not talk about coconut oil which everyone is saying is good for you now. This DVD presents a very good approach to eating but also discusses why you should take vitamin and mineral supplements.

As you watch this DVD you can write down all the healthy foods that are suggested. Some include flaxseeds, sockeye salmon, ginger (dipped in dark chocolate - yum), turmeric, fresh garlic (in salad dressings and added to foods near the end of cooking), beans, nuts and lots of olive oil. Many are saying to avoid sugars altogether but in this DVD Dr. Weil believes a little won't hurt you. He does explain what you should totally avoid and gives advice on how to read labels.

Overall I think this DVD is filled with excellent healing advice. I don't think you can go wrong following the advice Dr. Weil gives. He has always been ahead of his time.

8182023,4,B000NVKZVA,"Dr. Weil has a very sensible and holistic approach to eating which is well explained in this program.  I like his emphasis on debunking fad diets and on making eating pleasurable and socially integrative.  He covers all the basic concepts related to healthy eating competently and clearly.  I personally was hoping for something more advanced, since the information in this video is really oriented to those who know very little about nutrition.  If you have been keeping up with the literature, there will be little new information here.  Actually, Dr. Weil's DVD on healthy aging contains some interesting information on healthful properties of foods and spices in the Okinawan diet which are not contained here and which were new to me.  But, even if you know all this, it never hurts to reinforce it and this video is a succinct and motivational way to do so.",1203120000,21,863,4.876712328767123
