374962,5,6301868684,"Did you ever notice that if you were to show a film to after dinner friends, all too often what you bring out is a work that might not make a list of your personal top ten favorite movies?  This is one of those films.  Very postwar early 50's, but a 1950's Donna Reed would have been lost in.  It truly is the opposite of Pleasantville.

Hubert Selby's dark vision of the common man is woven around several characters in a Brooklyn neighborhood.  A factory worker called Big Joe is played by Burt Young.  Instinctively brutal yet pathetically naive, he wanders through his Brooklyn neighborhood functioning at the most elemental level reinforced only by an inherited value system to which he is single-mindedly loyal.  Jennifer Jason Leigh plays a whore whose timeline for thoughts of her future stretches out only several hours.  She gets by in life rolling drunks whose tolerance for liquor is less than hers, or giving sex to those who outlast her.  A soldier soon to be shipped out takes her to Manhattan for his last few stateside days and falls in love with her.  Tralala (Leigh's character) recognizes the attendant lust but has no clue about the implications of his love.  As she sees him off, the Lieutenant hands her an envelope.  Tra's face lights up as her vision of the order in life (she gives him sex, he has a good time, he gives her money) seems to have been reaffirmed.  When the envelope turns out to contain a lengthy love letter she doesn't become angry or disappointed, just confused.

In addition to Leigh and Young, powerful performances are turned in by Jerry Orbach (the corrupt union boss), Stephen Lang (the closet homosexual strike-line foreman), Stephen Baldwin (a street punk), Ricki Lake (Big Joe's very pregnant daughter), and Alexis Arquette (the teen-age transvestite).

The soundtrack is excellent and unobtrusive and Uli Edel's direction insightful.  You need a strong stomach to watch it and quite a bit of dedication to find it, but it's well worth the effort.

374963,5,6301868684,"Over the summer I purchased and read Hubert Selby Jr.'s ""Last Exit to Brooklyn"". It was the first book I had read for pleasure since high school. I also only bought it because the film Requiem for a Dream was astonishing, and because it wasn't at that particular bookstore. Anywho, I read LETB in about a week, which is super fast for me, and was intrigued enough to go out and watch the film.

I had never heard of Uli Edel but was curious to see how well the book was illustrated through film. From the opening shot of the three military men walking through the dark streets to the Greeks to the factory to the strike office, things seemed to have been pulled straight from the book. If you have read the book you know how it can be sometimes quite difficult to read Selby's writing style, considering there are pages upon pages of text in all caps and run-on sentences up the wazoo, so a visual illustration really did a good job of bringing some confusing parts of the book to life.

Jennifer Jason Leigh gave a good performance as the infamous Tralala, Jerry Orbach was always refreshing to watch, but I think I liked the portrayal of Harry Black the best (I think it was Stephen Lang). As in the book, his ""chapter"", along with Tralala's, were the longest, and the two characters were also the most intertwined in the other stories, so they also got a majority of the screen time in the film. Oh, and Burt Young was well cast, too. He seems to thrive on the grumpy-caring-jerk-semi womanizer type character quite well.

I know others who have read the book or seen the movie have been put off by its unflattering portrait of the Brooklyn working class 60 years ago. Im only 22, and not the biggest history buff, so because of my little knowledge of the time I really cant form an opinion of how well it interprets the people and the places, or if much of it was dramatized, or if the stories told just represented a handful of the population in Brooklyn. But regradless, I enjoyed the less than perfect lifestyle and the struggles and sacrifices our characters endured to achieve their goals. I live near an upper middle class area, so lots of people take things for granted, and I think thats why Im drawn to these types of books and films.

But anyway, I liked this film; and I liked the book, too. Its not one of those films (or books) that you can watch or read everyday because the content strikes like a hammer and stays with you long after, kind of like Requiem, but I feel I am a better person for experiencing ""Last Exit to Brooklyn"".",1097193600,12,2549,4.417021276595745
374964,5,6301868684,"It's the 1950s. Under President Eisenhower's administration, everyone has a house in the suburbs, a decent job, a gas-guzzling car, and a basic ""Leave It to Beaver"" lifestyle.
Not so, said Hubert Selby, in his novel, LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN. For a good deal of the working class, times were still tough. Preyed upon by crime, toyed with by factory owners and unions, and, ultimately, shackled by their own ignorance, the working class had their promise of a white picket fence and primrose garden vacated. In Brooklyn, particularly, things were acutely tough. Manufacturing jobs were on a rapid decline, as companies moved out of town or out of state (which was why those companies remaining in Brooklyn were able to mess with their employees: take it or leave it, was their attitude). At the same time, an influx of immigrants seeking jobs made the hunt for work even more competitive--another bonus for the remaining factory owners. Slums rapidly worsened, so much so that Dodger owner Walter Alston decided his team's future was in jeopardy. L.A. looked like a much safer place for a stadium.
But neither Selby nor director Uli Edel portrayed this working class as merely innocent victims. Neither the book nor the film is a didactic rant about class warfare. The poor had their own vices of greed, brutality, and dissipation. Just about every other scene has someone going through someone else's wallets, union funds or pockets. If they aren't doing that, they're drinking, fighting, or whoring. It's a pretty dismal world. The natural response to this film might be: ""Wait a minute. Not everyone working class Johnny-Punchclock guy was a criminal. Most people worked hard and honestly."" Of course, this is true but it's not the film's concern. This is a study of those who were trapped in that world, and this study is compelling and horrifying.
Uli Edel has perfectly captured this bleak world, either bathing everything in a garish light or obscuring it in heavy shadows. The performances are brilliant. There's no understating Jennifer Jason Leigh's gritty and powerful performance. Also keep an eye out for a cameo by Hubert Selby as the driver who hits Georgette. Not for the weak-stomached and definitely not for kids, LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN is as cinematographically close to the innermost circle of urban hell as you can get.",1082592000,55,2335,4.98974358974359
374965,2,6301868684,"People who think that the working class or anyone who is down and out is necessarily brutal and self-serving will love this film. For those who like their ""social realism"" as ugly and unambiguous as possible,this is the film for you. Most of the characters are one-dimensional,yell their lines and are either outrightly cruel/unfeeling (practically everyone) or hystrionic/narcissistic victims doomed to be wiped out by the end of the film (eg Gorgette the transvestite, Tra La La the town ""tramp""). Almost all are totally unsympathetic--practically no-one in this film is worth caring about. Sorry, but real life is NOT like this,not even amongst the ""downtrodden"" who obviously make such sensationalist fodder for those eager to ""slum it"" vicariously for a couple of hours. This film might titilate nihilistic 20 yr olds or middle class suburbanites and has clearly thrilled all the critics (and almost everyone else in this forum) but I found it stupid and ugly (and boring). Jennifer Jason Leigh is terrific, I must add. That is the only good thing I can say about this film, I'm afraid. For those looking for uncompromising social realism and characters written with compassion rather than contempt, try reading Steinback's ""Cannery Row"" or see the movie of his novel ""Of Mice and Men"" or, for a more contemporary, very bleak but infinitly better film than Last Exit see ""Nil by Mouth"" directed by Gary Oldman.",1072483200,9,1415,5.07725321888412

375097,5,6301868684,"This was filmed in the late 1980's and I finally decided to watch it for the first time. (I'd worked on the movie for three weeks as a background actor. I was always curious as to the finished film. It wasn't available in a U.S. format for many years and either I'd missed its release in the theatres or it was only released abroad; hence, the lack of a U.S. DVD). In any event, This film is a dark and gritty portrait of illiterate, poor residents in Brooklyn during the 1950's. As an example of what might be expected, there is no ""Gay Movement"" here. Instead, this film shows the absolute desperation of homosexuals before today's arguably precarious, ""Age of Enlightenment.""  No one is called ""gay"" here, only ""queer"" and worse. These characters are victims of the prevailing circumstances; on the whole, they are selfish and self-loathing. Anyone looking for a positive portrait of a ""Gay America"" will not find it here. As for the larger culture of this poverty-stricken section in Brooklyn, it is a deeply violent portrayal of a disturbing world of the urban, working and non-working class complete with dock-worker-union-members on strike, uneducated men with their women and children living at home in cheaply furnished apartments, people from broken homes and everyone with broken dreams. This is one bleak film. Jennifer Jason Leigh had, to her enormous credit, the guts and ability to play a poor and uneducated girl who'd never in her life ventured from her small Brooklyn neighborhood. As much a victim as the other characters, Leigh's character relies upon sex, violence and deceit to survive. In this way, an uncritical analysis of her character would lead one to the quick conclusion that she is the neighborhood prostitute. But she is not. She hates everyone and everything around her as much as she is prone to severe forms of self-annihilation But there are glimpses that she truly wants better. Her peers are equally nihilistic and just as dangerous. However, these young men never lose their place as the oppressors of those weaker than they, whether those weaker are homosexuals or women. If a movie-goer is looking for an apocalyptic portrait of the world without having a film's ability to travel into the future to see it, Last Exit to Brooklyn delivers in spades. But unlike Hollywood films in which apocalypses are accompanied by bold action performed by remarkable stunt-men, Last Exit remains true to its place in time and place. It is an emotionally disturbing film. When it was reviewed by The New York Times, Vincent Canby called it "". . . Epic . . .[and] Uncommonly Evocative . . .""  the DVD jacket quotes that portion of the Times review in which the film is called, ""harrowing"" yet ""savagely beautiful."" I'd say that the active words here are, ""harrowing"" and ""savage.""  Upon finishing my time as background on the film, I recall thanking director, Uli Edel for the three weeks of work. He responded, tongue-in-cheek, ""Congratulations . . . you are now part of a very dirty movie;"" but ""gritty"" may have been the word he likely would have preferred, if the timing of our quick exchange were not so in need of humor; Leigh's character had just allowed herself to be gang-raped for what seemed to be an excruciatingly, painful eternity. Of note, this scene is one of at least two scenes in the film that are tantamount to crucifictions. This is a horrible but remarkable moment in which her character is somehow ""transformed"" into a vessel that reveals her long line of anonymous assailants and everyone around her to be truly lost souls. That she survives is miraculous. But it is more than mere survival. She rises up from her assault to console an adolescent boy who is smitten with her and cries for her condition.  It is a moment that seems pivotal. It is as if that is the first time she can truly give something valuable of herself to another. It is redemptive. In concluding, Last Exit To Brooklyn is remarkable and it is all the more so that a film with such subject-matter was capable of being successfully produced. Though not a film for the faint of heart, it is a great film none-the-less.",1432944000,5,4136,4.78041958041958

375136,5,6301868684,"A great look back at a different time in history when things were not so technical. But also a very violent time. The unions and the factories were king and America still had a strong manufacturing base. The characters are vivid with Jennifer jason Leigh threatening to walk away with the show. ""The best tits in the western world"". In a pre-AIDS gang rape, Ms. Leigh gives a truly naked and vivid performance. When her young crush saves her....it is both poignant and pathetic. But Stephen Lang and Baldwin with Peter Dobson holding their own.
Stephen Lang's portrayal of a sexually confused pre-AIDS Brooklyn-ite captures a time in life when experimenting with the taboo was not discussed, yet, more normal than a reader may want to accept. He meets up with a cold, self-important gay man who personifies a sissy. With a wife longing to be satisfied, their one sexual encounter depicted is as violent and lacking love as all the other encounters.
I found the beginning descent of unions particularly fascinating. These hardworking union men think that they can outmuscle the much sleazier corporate types who will eventually find a way to destroy these dedicated workers way of life. On the edges of technology battering the American factory worker, the destructive middle managers slowly but effectively destroy the lives and dignity of the blue collar worker. Everything has a cycle and you know eventually the corporations will meet their makers. Unfortunately, it is the late 50s/early 60s and we only get to see the Great American Dream outwitted. In the coming decades, those hard fought decent paying jobs will be a thing of the past.
All that is left, is a sad snapshot of false hopes and dreams fading away. The trucking system destroyed by automation and ruthlessness. Tralala will wither away in some dive bar watching her fantasy of an army officer husband quickly dissipate, as Harry's stupid fantasy of being a union boss crumbles in his hands like an earthquake destroying a Great city. Regina, the cold sissy will most likely meet his fate in the next decade or so unable to wave a rainbow flag of a new day, Georgette finally sees how Vinnie used her before she is seen flying through the air as a corpse even before she truly dies. Does anyone find a modicum of happiness? Maybe Tommie, with the bike, will be able to rescue his shotgun wedding family before destruction comes. The Brooklyn warehouses have been transported to Vietnam or The Phillipines replaced by over-priced condos in the post millenium era of greed and more greed.
It is just impossible to see a happy ending anywhere as the score hauntingly captures the last exit to nowhere.",1423872000,3,2667,4.863736263736263

A movie that could of been great but wound up only being good & the description at imdb is as much wrong as it is right. Set in the Early 50's in Brooklyn it follows the actions, often without consequences, of a new Union Strike building leader who is unhappy at home with his wife & kids & takes homosexuality as his road out. It also follows a prostitute that has a small gang that rolls her customers for her. A family man played by Burt Young of Rocky fame has difficulty adjusting to his daughters pregnancy & Jerry Orbach makes an appearance, in astounding realism, as the Head of the Local for the union.

Unfortunately the gang appears first in the show & they are toons. I expected to see them break out into song & dance like in Westside Story's Officer Krupke. It ruined the first half of this very dark & gritty movie for me. Once I got over that I realized that this probably plays better for an East Coast dweller rather a central US dweller like myself. The music is haunting, enjoyable & contrasts amazingly well with the visual images. No rating now I'll give it another look later.

Overall it's a great cast with Jennifer Jason Leigh playing the prostitute in a manner that shows why I love her acting so much. Stephen Baldwin, Stephen Lang, Rikki Lake, Peter Dobson & Sam Rockwell appear also. I liked the show but I'm not certain how much.

The documentary accompanying the film is amusing in that it at one point features the all-too-german filmmakers trying to come with a rationalization for the film.

The original work is a collection of short stories. That format works against it being a film. The film ends up drifting around between thinly connected characters and stories in a rather aimless way. Rather than being a view of reality, the film comes across as the paranoid view of the world from a shut-in.

The source material had shock value in the early 1960s. But the days when this stuff shocked are long past. And shock IMO opinion never works when its isolated on its own anyway. Its the good bits intermixed with the bad bits that create real shock. Things like the strike lose their power because all of the people suffering are so horrible that its difficult to sympathize with them at all.

Before there was Requiem for a Dream, there was Last Exit to Brooklyn (based on Hubert Selby Jr's other main novel) which deals with post-WWII Brooklyn in all of its scuzzy former glory; mixing different protagonists and different stories--from a jaded hooker without a heart of gold to a closeted Union big wheel to a wonderfully kinetic and exciting fight scene between strikers and strikebreakers--leads to some structural problems, but it's a movie you won't forget.

It shows a slice of life that is hard to watch or understand unless the viewer has practical experience in the raw world or posseses a very open mind.

This movie had that same gritty feel about it.  This is like an old movie only without all the restrictions a movie shot in the 60's would have.",1225584000,5,295,4.140350877192983

375332,5,6301868684,This is an excellent movie. I hadn't seen it on dvd until I purchased it. Very poor quality/grade dvd though. This movie is not for kids under 18 AT ALL!!! But the great story and great acting make this a must see or own. Loved it when it first came out and it is just as good today. Highly recommended.,1211414400,4,303,4.066666666666666
375333,5,6301868684,"Here is a visually stunning adaptation of Herbert Selby's unvarnished novel about street-wise losers in 1952 Brooklyn. This film includes graphic violence and sexual situations not for the ""Romantic Comedy"" crowd. Jennifer Jason Leigh as the hyper-sexual prostitute Tra-La-La steals almost every scene she's in.

Although the screenwriters had to re-do the ending as the true nature of the book's finale would have drawn an ""X"" rating, this is a must-see for those of us who can appreciate the realities of the street for those living the most marginal of an existance.

One other treat is an obese Ricky Lake as a dim-witted knocked-up teen whose family forces a wedding to the poor sap who sired her child as a way tho save their reputation (as if they ever had a good one to begin with).

The beating and ""cruxafiction"" of Stephen Lang as the latant homosexual is also an unforgetable cinematic moment.",1202083200,9,905,4.901960784313726
375334,5,6301868684,"STEVEN LANG and JENNIFER JASON LEIGH dominate this virtually picture-perfect view of Brooklyn circa 1950.  A sad and moving mix of Union Dispute [Teamster strike}, confused sexual identity [identeties], anger and misplaced love.

Lang is excellent [more than that] as the love-torn Strike Captain - totally oblivious of 'the nature of things' - Jaosn-Leigh - more than award worthy for her ""Tral"" - perhaps the whore with the platinum heart?  Totally oblivious of long-term goals - living from sailer to sailer ...

Art/Set direction and design, wardrobe, etc - spot on.

Highly worth the visit - if you can -  ""Father Knows Best"" it ain't!
Could be fun to pair Jason-Leigh and Lang as ""George & Martha"" and watch the conflagration ........

375337,3,6301868684,"This film creates a nightmare. The sun never shines. It is always dark. The characters are either street toughs, who engage in habitual brutal exploitation, or their victims, who are shadowy and undeveloped. The violence is really extreme, on every level. It could be a story of life inside a prison or of a war, but we are told it takes place in Brooklyn in 1952.

I kept trying to find something redeeming, some selfless act of human kindness, something half way beautiful that would lead me out of this version of hell, some visual depiction of the exquisite string music provided by Mark Knopfler as the score; but very little was there. The film did not show anything that cried out for justice in the strike, and therefore it was hard not to sympathize with the company, which at least employed some reason in their tactics. All the personal relationships were either superficial, or so briefly touched upon, that it was hard to imagine any depth or lasting impression or anything very meaningful.

If it is enough to depict a hell of violence and victimization, then this film succeeds, with gut wrenching performances such as Jennifer Jason Leigh's. But it leads nowhere.",1148601600,7,1179,4.802955665024631

has done it all and can do no wrong. and until she finally grabs that gold man by the balls, hollywood will be kicking themselves for NOT rewarding her wih the most honorable statuette in history for her lengthy list of previous classics!!!!",1141516800,6,1007,4.787356321839081

7816436,5,6301868684,Disturbing; not really entertainment although the acting is outstanding...more of a commentary on how horrible people are.

This is a really bad copy/print of the movie. The sound is not good at all. As a matter of fact, when the transfer to DVD was made, it seems like it was done at the wrong speed since at times, the actors voices are in the wrong register and almost sound cartoonish. This is a shame since this is a really great movie, and one of the best books ever written. I can only ponder that since it was not a big box office draw, the care and attention to bringing this to DVD was lack-luster.",1453680000,,623,3.992
