8503032,1,B006QHH29S,"Probably the worst product I have bought from Amazon, and possibly one of the worst products I have bought in many years of buying stuff.

These are terrible video transfers of some classic silent western movies.  The picture quality for these movies is awful, with blurry, out-of-focus images and a bleached out quality  The top and bottom of the original picture image is cut off.

I have three of these movies on a DVD from another vendor, so I was able to verify that it wasn't the original movie quality that was the problem. The problem is THIS DVD!

I have returned this product to Amazon.  Save yourself the aggravation and buy a different Broncho Billy DVD.",1394064000,4,666,4.64957264957265
