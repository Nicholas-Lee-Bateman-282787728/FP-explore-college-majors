2396821,5,B000AY6SB6,"In my book, the original Tom Green Show on MTV was the single greatest show of all time.  Call me ""immature"", but to me, nothing is funnier than Tom riding in the back of a rickshaw on a busy street, wearing a British soldier uniform, screaming into a megaphone ""OOOOOOUUUH!!!! OOOOOOOOOOOOOUUUHHHH!!!!""

This mega set contains 3 packed discs, with 26 half-hour episodes of Tom's show on the Canadian ""Comedy Central"" equivalent, right before he went to MTV.  While a lot of the clips were used on the MTV show, most of this stuff has never been seen by us Americans - including tons of in-studio stuff,  with unsuspecting guests, Glenn Humplik(P.I.M.P), Phil Sher-ooo/Gear-Rocks/Giroux,  and the poor studio audience.  And holy (...)This is some of Tom's best!  Tom was hungry, crazy, and had absolutley no fear back in these days - and it shows on this dvd set.

It's all here, from the ""WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU GOIN???"" guy, to the dead raccoon mascot, bags of milk, singing with drunk people, dead moose humping, Jim Cab TV, wanton chainsaw & baseball bat destruction, cow brains(!), Brad Pitt, more bags of milk, Humplik's ass, weirdo French-Canadians, the slutmobile, cow teet sucking, messing with foreigners/old people, a sh*tload of maniacal screaming(my favorite) and sooo much more.

Special features include:

Nearly one hour of unreleased material - cut scenes, longer takes, unreleased segments, ect

Commentary track by Tom on one episode - but it goes long, ending with Tom talking on camera aboot the show.

""A note from Tom"" A written piece about the show by Tom.

It's a shame Tom has scaled down his on-screen persona in recent years, because watching this stuff I laughed so hard I almost threw up... Pure comedic genius here, folks.

Bottom line: If you liked Tom's original MTV show, then there is no need to ponder, you must own this.  9+ hours of insanity for (...)?  Don't think, BUY IT!!!",1134345600,28,1914,4.861111111111111
2396822,5,B000AY6SB6,"This is an excellent set. Its a great price for 26 funny epsisodes. The quality is nice and the DVD menu is cool. If your looking for all of the MTV segments than you won't find them on this set, though many of these bits were aired on MTV.",1133913600,4,240,3.9183673469387754
2396823,5,B000AY6SB6,"Tom Green is a one of kind who dared to go were NO comedian went before. He paved the way for ALL the recent breakthrough crude humor stars. This Andy Kaufman like man is still way ahead of his time, and more then deserves his own late night show. DON?T BE BLIND-VOTE WITH THE FUTURE IN MIND

People this is our chance to see the man that made us laugh until we couldn't breath. I've been talking to Tom Green directly and he said he'll do it if offered!! Email Tom on his web site, tell him Dominic sent you and that you support him. It would be greatly appreciated if you told as much people as you can to sign it.

Thank You Very Much,

2396824,5,B000AY6SB6,"In 1997-Canada had just launched its very first
Comedy Network- and was looking for fresh new
Canadian talent to air.

Tom Green had already been doing his show on
Community TV-and by now...he had quite a big
cult-following among teenagers in the Ottawa area.

So- The Comedy Network gives Tom a late night show
on Fridays; and this is Canada, so everything on
the new Comedy Network is aired completely RAW!
That's right- they don't censor every little thing
like MTV does.

Every week- Tom was out pushing the limits.
Razzing people in the streets, getting kicked out
of shopping malls and sawing dead animals in half.
I'm telling you, it was insane!

He was taking things to a level that had not yet
been reached over in the U.S.A - and if you think
I'm making all of this up, order the DVD set!",1127174400,5,798,4.482758620689655
2396845,5,B000AY6SB6,this is great. if you are a tom green fan and are thinking about purchasing  a dvd this is it ....until MTV releases something....a lot of the clips on this set were use on the tom green show. bottom line THIS IS AWESOME BUY IT NOW! it took a lil bit for the package to arrive but it was worth the wait,1247529600,,302,3.870967741935484
2396846,5,B000AY6SB6,"Ever since we've been together, my boyfriend would talk about how he wished they would put the Tom Green Show on DVD. That immediately initiated my search. I found several sets, all with reviews saying it was only footage of stuff to make the show go, kinda like behind the scene stuff. I found this set and just went with it. He said these episodes are earlier episodes of the Tom Green Show before it hit MTV. He said these videos are funnier that some of the stuff aired on MTV.

I highly suggest it.",1225756800,,503,4.294736842105263
2396847,5,B000AY6SB6,I have always been a fan on Tom Green and this box set is everything you will ever need. From his delightful interviews with locals to his halarious skits. This box set has everything! IT'S GREAT! SO BUY IT!,1208995200,,207,4.333333333333333
2396848,5,B000AY6SB6,"Tom Green is one of the few people out there that can pull of material like this. This set is worth every penny. Just sit back and watch Tom serve kool-aid to a UFO cult. If this doesn't make you laugh, you must be dead.",1194048000,,220,3.911111111111111
2396849,5,B000AY6SB6,"TG was truly brilliant in his early days.  He fully deserved his skyrocket of success.  Its easy to see why every comic wanted to imitate TG so bad he ended up changing the whole comedy game.  TGs public access show is arguably his best stuff.

I just caught a random cameo by TG at a comedy show and had to accept the harsh reality that TG is no longer funny whatsoever.  At least we have the memories and the DVDs.",1183939200,2,416,4.15
2396850,4,B000AY6SB6,"THIS BOX SET HAS TO BE ONE OF MY FAVORITE SETS THAT I HAVE EVER BOUGHT BECAUSE IT CONTAINS ALL THE EPISODES FROM TOM GREEN'S EARLIER WORK ON THE CANADIAN COMEDY NETWORK. IF YOU WERE LIKE ME THAN YOU WERE BLOWN AWAY BY THE MTV SHOW, AND THIS SET IS GREAT BECAUSE IT HAS MOST OF THE BITS THAT WERE SHOWN ON THE MTV SHOW. NOW, I SAY PARSE THIS ONE OUT A LITTLE AT A TIME, AND DONT JUST SPEND ONE DAY WATCHING ALL THE EPISODES OR THE SET MIGHT GET OLD ON YOU. TAKE YOUR TIME WITH IT AND TAKE INTO CONTEXT WHAT THIS GUYS DOING. THIS IS THE BEGINING OF OUTLANDISH REALITY COMEDY!

2396851,4,B000AY6SB6,"He paved the way for everything you guys do today. Bam is the biggest Tom Green thief (and I like Bam), but Tom was torturing his parents on video years before Bam even got his first camcorder. Tom Green's goofy interviews, his obnoxious public displays and his silly characters still make me giggle harder than anything on Jackass. I am 36 years old, but this box set has me in stitches every time I watch it. A TON of these clips were used on Tom's MTV show in the late 90's. In fact, the majority of Tom's MTV show was made up of the stuff that you will find on this excellent 3 disc set. Squid Suit, Feet On Fire, Processing Juice (...), Caramel Lovin' Hick, Celebrity Interviews, Officer Green, Torturing Parents Skits, Milking The Cow(s) almost every other skit you remember is here. The world needs more Tom Green and this set will keep you busy for days.",1138060800,6,862,4.427672955974843
2396852,5,B000AY6SB6,"Let me start off by saying that when It comes to Tom Green you can either take him or leave him, love him or hate him. Either way you slice it there is no denying he leaves an impact with his audience; and lets face it as an entertainer that is your main goal: to connect with an audience.  With that being said the old ""Tom Green Show"" that aired back in 98 on Canada's Comedy Network really set the standard for television today.  The show was unique in so many ways: Freshly Original, Shocking, and at some points really stupid to the point that it was completly hilarious.  You had to suspend disbelief to get past the crazyness, but once you did it made you realize there was somthing special about this show.

As for the set itself it is great!!! All 26 original episodes of the classic cult hit that includes many funny sketches that ran on MTV.  However the funniest parts of the shows in my opinion were when Tom would get these unsuspecting guests for his show; which would start off as a regular interview, and would take a funny turn leaving the guests shellshocked.

As for the special features, over an hour of unseen material, and a special thank you message to the fans from the man himself; this was a really classy move proving Mr. Green knows where he came from and still has a connection with fans that the average Joe could appreciate.

At any rate this is a must for Old Tom Green fans, or someone who wants a change from the Mundane, boring same old same old.

Thanks Tom",1135468800,11,1494,4.348920863309353
2396853,3,B000AY6SB6,"Hey Guys,

Seems like all the previous reviews are promotions for the set so I feel obligated to be honest.

Be prepared for a lot of filler in the set, the episodes are packed with bits that seem so dumb and unfunny I was scratching my head wondering why they would even air it. This is coming from a Tom Green fan, remember. Second, a lot of his ""craziness"" invloves screaming like an idiot for minutes at a time with no apparent point to it besides to show how ""wacky"" he is. This is funny at first but when you are 15 episodes deep, you are waiting impatiently for the next bit to start. There are definetaly some really funny bits but sadly a majority of them AIRED on the MTV show, making them second hand humor for me. Finally, there were a good amount of bits that I felt he could have went a lot farther with and taken better angles. You just have the feeling that he would walk down the street, find a random person, and have them talk while he stares at the camera, screams, or humps the ground. Its all funny at first but gets real boring real quick.

Essentially this set has nothing on things like jackass, Ali G...

In my opinion the MTV show was MUCH funnier than his canadian show. This is because he took all the funny bits from his old show, he had funny writers for once helping him, and there was a large filter on retarded material that would otherwise make it into the show.

After watching the set you get the feeling that this was some high school kids graduation project. I was hoping for a lot more than what this set has to offer.

In conclusion:

Funnies in between large chunks of very unfunnies. LOL",1135123200,9,1630,4.2727272727272725
2396854,5,B000AY6SB6,"Every Tom Green fan must get this dvd, and even you aren't a fan then you will become one after watching this, KICK ASS!! what else to say!",1134777600,4,139,4.0
8080375,4,B000AY6SB6,"There is only one reason why I can not give 5 stars.

Indeed, this DVD set does contain the complete run of his show on, ""The Comedy Network,"" in Canada.

However, it is missing many classic sketches, some of them all-time favorites. Sketches not included on this set are from his previous shows in Canada and his subsequent show on MTV in America.

Some of the sketches NOT included are:

""Painting Parents House Plaid""
""Statue on Parents Lawn""
""Undercutters Pizza""

""Jokers Wild""
""Mustard Inspector""
""Harassing Flamingos""
""Monica Lewinsky""
""New Mexico Alien""
""Motorized Wheelchair in Grocery""
""Cereal Isle Fort""
""Pones in your piddly poo""
""Out of Control Wheelchair""

... I could keep going, but you get the idea. Unfortunately, many of your favorites will be missing from this set.

That being said, THE REST of your favorites ARE ALL HERE in well over 100 sketches in this fabulous DVD set which contains 26 complete episodes.

Some of the sketches INCLUDED are:

""Crutches"" aka ""Making fun of Cripples""
""Department Store Intercom""

""Hold the Light""
""Metro News Station""
""Walk with a Swagger""

That is really just to name a few. There are well over 100 sketches on this set.

One last thing to mention is that the segments of his talk show in between the actual sketches and street interviews are, for the most part, unfunny and painful to watch as amazon reviewer, Boris Shapiro, pointed out. However this is not a big deal since most remote controls have fast forward buttons.

All in all I rate this set 4 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it if you are a fan of old school Tom Green.

Some day I hope to see the rest of his sketches released on DVD.",1456617600,,2518,4.884976525821596

8080377,5,B000AY6SB6,"I forgot how far Tom Green would take any bit.

8080379,5,B000AY6SB6,"I remember when we first got cable TV in 1999 and watched The Tom Green Show on the Comedy Channel in fits of hysteria! To now own all 26 classic episodes on this phenomenal 3 disc set is almost beyond words.
The unique nature of this show is what makes it so attractive. Provided your not squeamish or prudish, this show will be an absolute riot that you may well find yourself addicted.
Some of Tom's outrageous antics include: constructing a boat by melting cow brains into a foam disc, snorkelling in public fountains to collect money for the rich, getting a sexual image painted on his father's car and so much more!

I bought this particular DVD for one episode I'd seen in the past that I thought was the FUNNIEST skit I'd EVER seen by ANYONE. To my disappointment, it wasn't on this DVD. If they claim to have EVERY episode on this DVD, then atleast ONE is missing. I give his parents cudos for not KILLING HIM for this episode, where they wake up in the morning to find a statue of his Father BANGING his Mother from behind on their FRONT LAWN. I remember laughing so hard at the SHOCK value of this episode and the expression on his parents faces when they discovered the statue, that I COULD NOT BREATHE because I laughed all the air out of my lungs, I swear I almost passed out from laughter! It is STILL the funniest skit I EVER seen ANYONE do and it wasn't on this box set. I'd LOVE to see it again, but I guess it's the missing link...",1339027200,5,885,4.091954022988506
