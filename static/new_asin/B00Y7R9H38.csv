8717670,4,B00Y7R9H38,"This is an okay vehicle for Morse and Goulet, although Goulet's character was played over the top, as was Morse's performance as a womanizer on the cusp of getting married.  Likewise, I found it convenient that Goulet would suddenly find himself falling in love with a woman he'd met only once (Nancy Kwan - but she's irresistible anyway).  In deference to Nancy, they gave her a dance sequence that she shared with Morse which was obviously influenced by the date of the production (you see her shake her butt but not her cooch).

The acting was par for the period (1964) and the plot had a nice twist with Keenan Wynn playing the part of Goulet's philandering boss.  Terry Thomas was misused in his role as the hotel manager as his talents are far above those of an obvious extra, as was Elsa Lanchester's role as a hotel maid - although listening to her deliver her lines was a total delight.

Sadly, Jill St. John was relegated to the role of a dumb, drunken mistress who was ready to jump into bed with just about anyone.  Her redemption comes at the very end of the movie as she finally pairs up with someone while not in an alcohol-dazed state.

Worth a watch for fans of these actors.

Although Elsa left us in 1986, Robert Morse is still with us (at age 84!) and a lot of his movies are being marketed from the MGM archives as DVD-R on demand, which is probably the best situation for those of us who grew up with them all, over fifty years ago.

If you're a fan of Robert Morse, then check out his 1967 performance in the musical, ""How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying,"" and pairing up with Michelle Lee.  Rudy Vallee adds his talents in this performance as well.",1451260800,6,1685,4.423948220064725

8717673,4,B00Y7R9H38,"""Honeymoon Hotel"" is the 1964  comedy directed by Henry Levin (""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" (1959) and ""Where the Boys Are"" (1960)) that is really pretty funny.  Robert Morse is given a role that he handles well, although Robert Goulet is nice to look at, but not much of an actor.  Anne Helm, Nancy Kwan and Jill St. John are the girls involved with Elsa Lanchester getting some laughs as usual.  Although this is a typical product of the sixties, there are some surprising turns in the plot that make it a successful outing for everyone.  Chris Noel has a bit part.  Filmed in Panavision and Metrocolor, the MGM film is presented here from Warner Archive.  There is some fading here and there but it is probably asking for too much to expect this to be corrected.  It is much more agreeable than ""Quick! Before It Melts"" another Robert Morse vehicle recently released by Warner Archive.  Written by R.S. Allen and Harvey Bullock.",1436227200,6,939,4.642424242424243
