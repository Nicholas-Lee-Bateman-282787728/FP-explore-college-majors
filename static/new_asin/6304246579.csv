814180,4,6304246579,"I thought this BBC version of ""War and Peace"" was done well.  It follows the book pretty well--making it very long.  While it follows the book's story line better than most movies about books, I was a bit disapointed in the lack of scenery in the film.  For instance, you are rarely shown an overview shot of the houses, just inside shots of rooms, and during battle scenes you are shown just an open meadow.  The movie is also lacking music.  The story is great, but there is no background music usual for a movie.  That is good and bad, however, because it gives you the feel that it is more realistic.  Anthony Hopkins gives a very good performance as ""Pierre.""  I was really happy with the way the story followed that which was in the book.  It takes some liberties, but considering time constraints, most are understandable.  I think I detected a little anti-communist twist in the British film of the early '70's when Pierre looks out the window at the end of the movie and says, ""I wonder what kind of world it will be like in 100 years,"" (he supposedly said this in 1820)after just talking about his willingness to support a revolution.  The book obviously does not have this type of direct foreshadowing to the Bolshevik [sic] revolution of c. 1917.  I thought the actors did well, though most were not what I pictured from the book.  Overall, I think it was a very good movie.  I am glad I purchased it.  I would like to see the Russian version too, however.",973209600,14,1468,4.466165413533835

814367,3,6304246579,"What can one say about an interpretive miss? The BBC take on War and Peace is an admirable effort but is unfortunately dated, miscast, and torturously paced. Anthony Hopkins is excellent as always, but the newer BBC version is much more enjoyable if not a thorough. If one were trying to skip out on reading the book, perhaps one might be served well by this verision, but if its entertainment one is after, look elsewhere.",1495497600,,423,4.653333333333333

814370,2,6304246579,"Though much briefer and far more of a condensation of the novel, the 2015 production with Paul Dano as Pierre is far superior to this 1972 BBC series from 1972.  The earlier series brings to the screen far more of Tolstoy's novel, but the acting in it, by everyone in the cast from the most to the least significant character is excruciatingly amateurish and stiff.  It is nearly painful to watch it.  For all the consequences, narratively and psychologically, that befall a filmed so extremely condensed as the later one, it nonetheless contains far more of Tolstoy's spirit and essence simply because the characters are far more completely and complexly realized.

The 1972 version is bad realization of the novel because it is so weakly, unconvincingly done, surprisingly so for a BBC production.  The woman playing Natasha, for example, made me wince at her overacting and excesses, like a school girl acting for the first time in her life in a school play.  Much of this film is like that:  a lot of money spent on equipment and almost no thought going into the direction.  The end result is that it turns one of the great novels of Western history into a dull and embarrassing mimicry of the real thing.",1491004800,3,1209,4.723809523809524

814466,5,6304246579,"An excellent version (I'm told by those who've read the book!).  Some of the portrayals, especially women, are a bit old-fashioned in acting style, but on the whole this is a brilliant adaptation, with outstanding acting, characterizations, and production values.  To say that it ""stands up well"" for a decades-old production is to give insufficient credit.  It's beautifully done in every way -- crowd scenes, especially of battles, are remarkably good and believable, with NO CGI !!!  But most of the praise should be saved for Anthony Hopkins, whose work is breathtaking.  All of the mannerisms and ""tics"" that came to dominate some of his eccentric characters in his older years were nascent in this early work, but are completely controlled and perfectly employed to create his intense, intelligent, delightfully awkward young Russian prince.  I hadn't seen it since it was brand new 40 years ago, and was just bowled over by how fresh and full his performance was.  Don't miss it.",1469232000,,986,5.049382716049383

814706,4,6304246579,"This review is about the 2016 Entertainment One release of DVD set for 1972 BBC TV series of War & Peace.  Before the purchase I found the description provided by amazon.com and some previous reviews giving conflicting information.  I just took the plunge and bought it from amazon.com.  After playing it I thought some of the info might be useful to some potential buyers.  I have no intent to discuss or argue the movie itself, but just provide some basic info hopefully to clear up some confusion about this product.

The picture quality is okay considering the production was in 1972 or prior.  It wouldn't be fair to compare it to today's HD quality standard.

The aspect ratio is 4:3, NOT wide screen as described by amazon.  I would assume most TVs around 1972 were standard 4:3, so for me this is not too bad as it most likely just transferred the original pictures onto DVD without remastering.

There is no subtitle.  The outer box of the DVD set indicates ""English SDH"" subtitle.  I tried playing it both on my Blu-ray player and on my computer and there was just no subtitle.  The title memu does not even contain a ""setup"" item to allow you to access more options.  I guess there were no extra options (English audio without subtitle).

The set contains 5 DVDs with each containing 4 episodes, so a total of 20 episodes.  Each episode is about 45 minutes long.  So I think the amazon description of 890 minutes total run time is correct.

I like the movie and wish they had done a little better job to provide some extras (e.g, subtitle options, interviews).  But again, for $22 it's pretty good price even without some bells and whistles.",1456963200,52,1652,4.5993150684931505
814707,5,6304246579,This production is a classic.  I grew up watching this miniseries multiple times and I still don't get tired of it.  Anthony Hopkins performance is stellar.,1456790400,4,156,4.961538461538462
814708,5,6304246579,"I first saw this on PBS. I really liked the battle scenes. They weren't on a scale of the Russian War and Peace movie, but it was pretty good for TV. I later bought the set and sat down to watch. What pleasantly surprised me is that the series was dramatized by Jack Pulman, who did ""I Claudius"", the excellent series with Derek Jacobi. This series, earlier than Claudius, is similar. Essentially you are watching a stage production, save for the short outdoor scenes. There's a lack of mood music, but the silence only punctuates the sharp dialogue. The series can be a little slow at times, and many characters are difficult to like, but Pulman manages to keep the viewer focused. Anthony Hopkins is the main star as Pierre Bezukhov, and how he grows from a drunkard and an admirer of Napoleon to a mature and wiser man. The battle scenes were overseen by Dr. David Chandler, and the scenes of Napoleon and his Marshals are quite well done. The bosomy Helene (Fiona Gaunt) is as unforgettable as her character is reprehensible. If you liked Claudius, you'll like this production.",1456358400,7,1081,4.664921465968586

I've watched it many times and it is a magnificent artistic achievement, without doubt one of the best thing the BBC has ever done.  It ranks with such triumphs as ""Brideshead Revisited"" and the original ""Forsyte Saga.""  The writing and the acting are simply flawless.  Unfortunately I'm a little deaf and I have trouble following the conversation, though the sound quality is very good.

814714,5,6304246579,"I saw this version when it was first broadcast on PBS, and for dramatic weight and clarity in the personal scenes, it is unbeatable. Anthony Hopkins is the perfect Pierre. But the juxtaposition of the soap opera look of the videotaped dialogue scenes against the film quality of the action scenes (typical of old BBC shows with taped interiors vs. filmed exteriors) remains jarring. The Fonda/Hepburn film is a quite good Reader's Digest version, but a bit too Hollywood. Overall, the best of them is the $100 million in 1967 7-Hour Bondarchuk theatrical version, but the stars don't shimmer as much as the other versions. The ideal movie would be the BBC Hopkins drama part with the Bondarchuk action scenes, which have never been equaled in any other film.",1453075200,2,758,4.883720930232558

814830,5,6304246579,"This series marked the first time I saw Anthony Hopkins in anything -- well before his days as Hannibal Lector, and playing a much different character: the bumbling, good-hearted Pierre. His seemingly hopeless love for Natasha is one of the driving forces in the story, but there is so much more. It's the story of aristocratic Russian families caught up in the Napoleonic Wars of the early 1800s. There are a lot of characters to keep straight, just as in the novel, but in my opinion the filmed version makes it a little easier to do so.

That is the beauty of this series.  It is a 20 hour long homage to the novel and it is extremely well done.  Anthony Hopkins is incredible as is the guy who plays Prince Andrei.  I have watched this series at least 4 times over the years and it always blows me away.  This is an incredible story with incredible characters in a quality production.  It is a lot easier to remember faces than names,  With this series one can at least remember some character's face when they pop back into the story, whereas with the book, you would probably be scratching your head.

I think many of you who are considering the BBC version are concerned about the limited use of English  in the Bondarchk (it is in Russian with subtitles and some limited English overdubs which are not particularly well done). This is an obstacle but I found it to be a minor one.

815084,5,6304246579,"I enjoyed this very much having previously in the last few years re-read the novel and also seen the Russian film by Bondarchuk.

I feel it gives a fuller picture of the plot of the novel than Bondarchuk and when all is said and done delineates what Tolstoy had to say quite well.

There is a particular emphasis on the politics of the war. Tolstoy uses his novel as a stage on which to ponder the meaning of war and what really influences its outcomes. In the BBC serial these thoughts are put into the mouths or thoughts of characters. But this is done skilfully and so it does not jar. I also felt far more emphasis was given to Napoleon himself than in the book. In the book there was more discussion of the Russian generals. A great deal of time was devoted by Tolstoy to the conduct of the war from day to day, month to month, and this is sketchy in this dramatisation except for the role of Napoleon himself, which given that Tolstoy felt every soldier, private or general was equally influential in the course of a war would seem to go against his intentions.

At times I felt this was a ""British"" interpretation of the novel, with starchy stiff upper lip attitudes, dreadfully repressed characters, and at times wooden acting. I felt the Bolkonsky family especially suffered in this respect. The father's crankiness was overdone and Andrei so wooden and unsmiling it was difficult to see how anyone could fall in love with him.

Nevertheless I felt the Director always kept his eye on the ball and the important themes all emerged despite this very 1972 British lens. Many of the individual scenes, especially those involving Bezukhov, Nikolai and Natasha are done with great precision and eloquence. The Countess Rostov is a very dominant character in this production, which I did not find in either the book or Bondarchuk's version. But however much Pulman draws out themes from the book I never felt he undermined it.

Perhaps unsurprisingly Bondarchuk's version, which misses out much more, nevertheless has the feel and perspective of the novel more accurately.",1391644800,4,2075,4.7368421052631575

The dialog is superb (it must have been lifted in whole paragraphs from the novel itself), and it is a pleasure to hear the educated and articulate speech of people of substance (not material but intellectual) who struggle and think about things that matter.

You can see the aspects of his performance that has made him an international treasure. The series is long - 14 1/2 hours, I think, but it takes that long to unwrap the story of Russian Society and the effects of Napoleon's invasion. For the time, the battle scenes are impressive, considering they had to use all LIVE extras (no CG then!), and the sets are sumptuous and the characters well-played. This was a typical program of the times, video-taped on set, and filmed in 16mm outdoors. In the set sequences, there seem to be the constant sound of heating and/or air conditioning, necessary because of the high light levels required for video then.

815202,3,6304246579,"There were glimmers of greatness in this movie but ultimately the entire series fell flat. The best feature of the production are the acting performances specificly of Hopkins, who was wonderful to watch especially as the early Peire. The actors playing Natasha, Countess and Count Rostove, and Princess Maria and her father were also very good. There were some performances I didn't care for, namely Andri, who I suspect is supposed to be some brave heroic character, but whom I found to be a whinney jerk.

I had two overriding problems with this production. The editing for the war scense was aimed at creating a specific tone, the problem is that it was obvious that they were trying to coax an emotional reaction, and fell flat. What I mean is before and after every war scene we'd get shot after shot after shot of soldiers sitting around looking sad, soldiers laying around, soldiers hurt, fire, horses, marching, blah blah blah, the first two shots evoked the thought I was supposed to have the next five made me roll my eyes. The extras first of all were not convincing in their suffering so showing it over and over again just made it obvious of what they were trying to do. So much time was devoted to these types of scenes and the war scense themselves were so poorly shot that all the scenes that dealt with the war and battle were just boring. If they'd condenced the war scenes and just shown the battle and the principal cast's reaction to it we could have cut about two hours out of the movie.

The second issue was Nepolean. I get that this is a British production, I get that the Russian's didn't speak like British people, but for the sake of enjoying hte film I accepted the fact that these people had British accents and used British phrases. What I can't accept is that the French also had British accents, specificly Neapolean. There needs to be a way to differentite between Russian and French, and with few exceptions there really wasn't. Also when Neapolean walks on stage he is so completely British taht I found it ridicouls.",1348963200,,2054,4.624657534246575
815282,5,6304246579,"The British really know how to do historical dramas, both fictional (""Vanity Fair,"" ""Jane Eyre,"" ""A Tale of Two Cities"") and nonfictional (""The First Churchills,"" ""The Voyage of Charles Darwin"").  This adaptation of Tolstoy's ""War and Peace,"" probably the greatest novel in European literature, is their best historical drama ever.  Everything is done perfectly: screenplay, cast, costumes, setting, direction, cinematography, music.  This version is twice as long as the much-honored movie from the former USSR and has much more of the interconnecting stories of the large cast of characters.  The Russian movie gives you the romance between Prince Andrei and young Countess Natasha Rostova and the recreation of the great battles of Austerlitz and Borodino, where the Russia army defended its homeland from the invading forces of Napoleon.  The BBC version gives you EVERYTHING.

A few words about the cast.  Antony Hopkins' portrayal of Pierre Bezukhov seems to owe something to Bondarchuk's interpretation of him, perhaps because they resemble each other. Or maybe it is just that both men understand Pierre and bring that to the screen. Morag Hood is captivating as the impulsive and generous Natasha. And she wasn't the only one in love with Prince Andrei!  Everyone was great. Even Tikhanov, a peasant on the Bolkonsky estate who is in only one scene, was as fine an actor as the leads and as supporting cast members like Sylvester Morand (Nikolai Rostov) and Joanna David (Sonia).

The cast and production crew did what seems to be impossible when you set out: to bring to life fictional characters whose period is 200 years before our own.  They succeeded brilliantly.  The screenplay was based on the Rosemary Edmonds translation from the Russian, which I bought and read after seeing the series on PBS in 1973.  I got the series when it came out on video in the 1990s and rented the DVDs when those became available.  Don't miss this marvelous production. Do yourself a second favor and read the book.  There are new translations out by Pevear and Volokhonsky and by Anthony Briggs.",1340496000,5,2093,5.081871345029239
815283,5,6304246579,"This is the 20-episode BBC miniseries of War and Peace from 1972 based on Leo Nikoleyevich Tolstoy's classic novel. This DVD set comes with 5 DVDs (with 4 episodes per DVD) and a 44-page booklet featuring production notes, episode summaries, character profiles, and behind the scenes photographs. Each DVD has a running time of 177 minutes for total running time of nearly 15 hours for the entire series.

In short, this is a movie about Russian aristocrats during Napoleon's invasion of Russia in the early 1800s. The story follows the main characters as they change (and sometimes die) over the course of the war. The adaptation is much, much better than the King Vidor film from 1956; however, it does not live up to the high quality of the four-part Russian movie from the late sixties.

Thanks to my e-book reader, I read War and Peace immediately prior to watching this miniseries. With so much time (15 hours), this miniseries quite admirably manages to include nearly every significant scene from Tolstoy's novel. The miniseries is mostly faithful to the novel; however, I was very much annoyed on a few occasions by unjustifiable deviations from the novel. I understand that television writers, directors, and producers must cater to a television audience's predilections; but this does not excuse vitiating a masterpiece. In any case, if you watch this miniseries, then you will have experienced the scenes and characters from the novel almost completely (without Tolstoy's essays on fate and war).

Anthony Hopkins is the star of this miniseries, playing the role of Pierre Bezukhov. As one would expect, Mr. Hopkins does an outstanding job. Considering the huge amount of time Mr. Hopkins was on screen, he must have been exhausted by the end of this shoot. However, I was very disappointed with many of the casting choices. The actors in the Russian version of War and Peace are much better aligned to the characters they play. I was a little disappointed with the BBC's choice for the part of Natasha. The actress is very good; her performance was fine. However, being a 29-year-old woman, she was too old to play the character (who is supposed to be 12 or 13 years old in her first scene). Of course, Natasha ages into her twenties over the course of the novel (miniseries); but, still, the actress, although good, was too old for the part. Also, casting Doctor Who (I mean, Colin Baker) as Kuragin did not work out well.

All in all, this is a very good production. It is flawed; but considering the budget, I think the production team did a miraculous job. I appreciate the lengths they went to in order to bring the entire novel to the screen. The King Vidor version from 1956, at 3.5 hours, pales in comparison (even though I, like everyone, love Audrey Hepburn).

815285,4,6304246579,"The dvd transfer is good.  The 1972 original is 40 years old.  The story is complex.  There are flaws but little point in fault finding.  Tolstoy didn't write a simple story.

By todays standards it is stuffy here and there, slow and simplistic.  The Russian production of the late 1960s is intense by comparison in my opinion.

Yet there are scenes in the earlier British production that can startle the viewer.  Battle scenes lack the Russian intensity and realism.

This long movie was a great effort in its time.  It feels so very British especially due to the acting style of the time.  But not all British productions for tv or the movie theater used this style.  Still, this pretentious acting doesn't dominate every scene.  Some acting is good while some isn't convincing.  This style of acting ended in the late 1970s and early 1980s as I judge it.

815289,5,6304246579,"The short answer up front is all three (the Hollywood/Hepburn version, the Bondarchuk/Russian version, and the BBC/Hopkins version).  Each sheds a different light on Tolstoy's work (which I have read three times, in different translations).  If you are completely unfamiliar with the work, I recommend starting with the Hollywood version.  At 3 hours, it is the shortest (by half), adequately acted (if not always well cast), has reasonably good sound and picture quality, and provides, at least in outline form, the major plot elements of the novel.  The Russian version is the definitive filming, with it's tens of thousands of extras, authentic locations, and a production budget that could not even be imagined in present-day Hollywood. The primary issues with this version relate to the long history of bad dubbing, bad subtitles, and arbitrary abridgements.  The Rusico (NOT the Kultur) release presents the movie in its original, un-cut, widescreen, 4-part version, with the ability to individually select (or turn off) dubbing and subtitles in any combination.  I cannot recommend this version highly enough (the sacking of Moscow makes the burning of Atlanta from GWTW look like a campfire, the palacial interiors are magnificent, and the Battle of the Borodino is completely unequalled on film). All of this being said, I believe that the BBC production is probably the best representation of the novel as a whole.  At 14 hours (over twice the length of the Russian version and four times the length of the Hollywood version), this one allows for complete character development and a real appreciation of Tolstoy's philosopies of war and culture.  Granted, the scope is not as large (there were only about 1,000 extras used, and the interiors are mostly all BBC studio sets), but the acting is universally superb, the English adaptation is excellent, and it tells the story in greater depth than either of the other two. Any one of the three will provide a good viewing experience - it just depands on what you want to take away from it.",1289260800,15,2047,5.071428571428571

Never have I seen any adaptation of a novel as faithful as this adaptation.  Pullman did a masterly job.------  The casting is for the most part perfect, but Anthony Hopkins towers head and shoulders over the others as the vibrant star who guides us through the entire saga.  ---- I do think perhaps another Natasha might have been a little more effective, but the actress certainly gives it her all, and is faced, of course with the difficulty of playing a thirteen year old girl and a grown woman later on.  I think she does quite a respectable job.  --- What so moved me however is that so many of the scenes, and so much of the dialogue is taken directly from Tolstoy's masterpiece.  ---- And for this reason, among others, Tolstoy's great love of his created characters, his great courage in probing the depths of their hearts and souls, shines through.  ----- I know of no writer except Tolstoy who writes so beautifully of both men and women, who will devote so much time to exploring the deep feelings of women, as well as men, who will treat a woman figure with the same respect that he shows for a male figure, even Napoleon.  Tolstoy's bravery in examining the ""romantic"" feelings of Pierre for Natasha, or Andrey and Nastasha for each other, or the love of Princess Marya for her husband,  all this is almost incredible.  ----- In America today, critics tend to be cynical and snide about domestic situations described in fiction, or the romantic love a man feels for a woman and vice versa.  Not so Tolstoy.  Such thoughts never entered his mind apparently.  He takes his time describing the feelings of a mother for a baby, the feelings of a young child dreaming of greatness, the feelings of a woman in love, just as he describes in detail Andrey's search for meaning, and Pierre's search for happiness and the good.  ----  And all this is radiant in this series, right along with great battle scenes that seek to capture the true chaos and horror of war.  -----The interiors are gorgeous, the ball room scenes enchanting, the whole a great and impressive work. --------  If you have never read War and Peace, if you are intimidated by the size of the book and by the long passages on war and the philosophy of history, etc. let me suggest this:  watch this series, and then go to the book, and using the series as a road map of sorts look for the various scenes that most impressed you or struck you.  Search out the characters in the series who most engaged you.  And then take what Tolstoy has to give.  ----- You will not find any jarring disconnect between the series and the novel.  The characters you love on the screen, you will find in Tolstoy's words.  And you will find in Tolstoy a profundity perhaps never rivaled by another writer; you will find a profound exploration of love that perhaps has never been equalled in a novel anywhere else. -----  I am grateful for this series, grateful to the patience and faith that went into the making of it, and grateful that we have such a marvelous set of dvds of it today.

In any case,  Natasha must be  a particularly difficult part for an actress because, in the novel, it is obvious that Tolstoy was half  in love with his creation, himself. Antony Hopkins' Pierre is every bit as convincing as one would expect from an actor of his calibre. Alan Jacobs' Prince Andrei, although  understated,is also competent.
War and Peace has been described as the greatest novel about war since Homer's  Iliad of circa 800 BCE and I think the BBC is to be congratulated on a great fulfillment of that comment.",1267574400,4,834,4.715277777777778

815366,5,6304246579,"The Story: In 1805 and during the celebrated reign of Russia's ""Alexander the Blessed"", Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Austria to further expand his European empire. The Russians, stalwart allies of the Austrians at that time, stood firmly with their brethren against the infamous Emperor. However, Napoleon swiftly prevailed and, after a time, a treaty was ultimately signed at Tilsit. In 1812, the power-crazed Napoleon rose again to cross the Neiman River into the Russian homeland, again in an effort to expand his dominion. The end result of this tragic conflagration was that Napoleon's army of about 600,000 soldiers was reduced to roughly 60,000 men as the defamed Emperor raced from a charred and mostly deserted Moscow, (which he had taken), back across the frozen Russian landscape in his comfortable carriage (leaving his troops behind to fend for themselves under grueling conditions) for Paris. That encapsulates the military aspect of this tale.

But the more intricate story involves both the activities and the peccadilloes of primarily three Russian families of nobility: The Rostovs, the Bolkonskys, and the Bezukovs. The continual thorn of ""The Antichrist,"" Napoleon, really just provides the wallpaper for this larger story of romance, riches, desolation, love, devastation, jealousy, hatred, retribution, nostalgia, joy, grief, naivety, stupidity, and so much more. Tolstoy has woven an incredibly intricate web that interconnects these noble families, the wars, and the common Russian people to a degree that would seem to most incomprehensible to achieve -- but Tolstoy perseveres with superb clarity and enormous insight into the human psyche. His characters are timeless and the reader of the book version of this magnificent story who has any social experience whatever will immediately connect with them all.

The Mini-series: This is a 1972 BBC production starring Anthony Hopkins (early on in his notable acting career), consisting of five DVDs and lasting for almost 15 hours! The aspect ratio is 4 x 3 (not letterbox) which is consistent with the dimensions of the traditional television screen. It looks just fine on a widescreen TV as well. The package includes an informative 44-page booklet with behind-the-scenes information about the production along with biographies of the key actors.

The first thought that came to my mind about this mini-series is that it is so very complex that most folks will have difficulty in grappling with the entirety of the story unless they have previously read Tolstoy's book:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/War-and-Peace-Vintage-Classics/dp/1400079985/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">War and Peace (Vintage Classics)</a>. It really doesn't matter much which translation that one reads (there are currently 12 English translations and the only divergent edition, in terms of what happens in the book, is this one:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/War-and-Peace-Original-Version/dp/0060798882/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">War and Peace: Original Version</a>. I usually recommend the Briggs translation for first-timers to the work, although the mini-series is based upon the very similar Rosemary Edmonds translation:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/War-and-Peace-Volume-I-Translated-by-Rosemary-Edmonds-Penguin-Classics-No-L63/dp/B000J2L77E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">War and Peace Volume I. Translated by Rosemary Edmonds. Penguin Classics No L63</a>.

This mini-series is a great introduction to War and Peace in the video format because it includes most of the nuts and bolts of Tolstoy's original story; however, in terms of artistic achievement this version cannot hold up to Bondarchuk's 1968 masterpiece film (dubbed in English, in letterbox, with available English and other subtitles):&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/War-and-Peace-Special-Edition/dp/B0000714B0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">War and Peace (Special Edition)</a>. Director Bondarchuk's focus was more on Tolstoy's ""magic"" and less so on including each and every incident, albeit he corralled the most essential ones. I should also mention that the prospective buyer should not even consider acquiring the pathetic Hollywood film version starring Henry Fonda. It's one of the most lamentable book-to-film attempts I've ever seen:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/War-and-Peace/dp/B00006JU7S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">War and Peace</a>.

Getting back to the BBC-Hopkins mini-series, the directors (Alan Dobie/John Davies) and other production folks unfortunately relented somewhat to their own egos and to that noxious little book-desecrator: ""poetic license."" In doing so, they told this magnificent tale much as a war historian might relate it, rather than seizing upon Tolstoy's meticulous, colorful, and powerful literary painting of the events. Make no mistake about it, this is an incredibly intricate and problematic story to render through the media of film. Allow me to now touch upon the mini-series' very few shortcomings and then I can subsequently summarize my considerable praise for this lengthy production in which the pros far outweigh the cons.

The casting was perhaps the most egregious aspect of this production. Ironically, Hopkins himself was a poor choice for the key character of Pierre Bezukhov. We detect, simply by looking at and listening to Hopkins in any environment, that he is incredibly intelligent, gifted, and articulate which is always going to leak through in any role that he plays - unfortunately, the character of Pierre is that of a portly, nave, and bumbling fool. Hopkins simply makes him come off as way too articulate and worldly, despite numerous vain attempts to make him appear less so.

A second casting calamity was that of actress Morag Hood who plays the equally important role of Natasha Rostov. To be blunt, Tolstoy created Natasha (in her youth of 13 years old and even later) to manifest every pedophile's fantasy. She is an incongruent blend of vivaciousness, stunning in appearance, uncontained in demeanor, puerile, and a bulwark of beaming sunshine, additionally exuding an untamed spirit unmatchable by any of her female peers.

Unfortunately, Hood's virtues are in contrast with this role and she could only be considered beautiful (I hate to toss this bomb but I will anyway) by English standards of the term... Hood's beauty is clearly internal, yet another feature which the egocentric Natasha does not at all share with her. Specifically, Hood's face is too emaciated in its structure and, while she's not actually buck-toothed, she demonstrates an overbite so prominent as to rival that of Hilary Clinton's chompers. This singular and regrettable actuality detracts from the centrality of the story to the degree that we as viewers cannot understand why all the young men plummet at her mere appearance (and in fact, Natasha's prospective lovers do not seem to wish to do so as their roles require!) Particularly in Natasha's teen appearances, the image of Hood's bounding and skipping around the various venues, sporting a young girl's pigtails, simply appears absurd.

Boris Drubetskoy (played by Neil Stacy) and Nicolai Rostov (played by Sylvester Morand) were each also far too mature in age to play their teen roles early in the tale, although they were faultless in adulthood in the latter episodes of the story.

The tendency of film-makers to gloss over the more magical parts of Tolstoy's Magnum opus illustrates their lack of comprehensive understanding of the story and perhaps their additional inability to convey it with a high level of competence. Two of the moments I'm thinking of in particular include ""the mummers' sleigh ride"" and ""Petya's dream,"" (just prior to the attack on the retreating French convoy.) Both of these important scenes were sadly excluded from the mini-series.

My final criticism is one regarding an historical ignominy: the scene at old Count Rostov's renowned banquet where Pierre challenges Dolokhov to a duel. I found it quite distracting from an historical perspective that the banquet was, in this instance, conducted in honor of old General Kutuzov instead of his much-revered assistant, General Bagration, as it should have been. No competent technical advisor in his right mind would have permitted this faux pas of a change from the book to transpire as, at that particular time, Kutuzov was pretty universally scorned by all within his social realm, owing to his disastrous defeat by Napoleon in Austria and elsewhere, (even though he had probably saved the Russian Army through his personally courageous strategies.)

And that last comment provides me with the perfect entry to remark upon what fine acting Frank Middlemass conveyed through his role as General Kutuzov, (even though he was misused in that single instance.) Middlemass performed equally memorably in his role as the scandalous and drunken Marmelodov in the terrific mini-series of Dostoyevsky's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crime-Punishment-The-Complete-Miniseries/dp/B0000A5A1L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crime & Punishment - The Complete Miniseries</a>.

Other key actors deserve a slate of Kudos for their respective appearances in the War and Peace mini-series: David Swift as Napoleon; Anthony Jacobs as old Prince Bolkonsky; Donald Douglas as Tsar Alexander I; Colin Baker as Anatole Kuragin; Rupert Davies as old Count Rostov; Faith Brook as Countess Rostova; Angela Down as Maria Bolkonskya, and; Candita Fawsitt as Julia Karagina, (a comparatively brief but very important role.) The terrific work of all these talented folks added so very much to the overall ambiance and palatability of the film.

In total, 20 episodes make up this sprawling color epic and, while it drags just a little here and there, I think that overall it represents a remarkable achievement in film. There was a lot of location shooting of the film in Yugoslavia which yielded spectacular scenery. The outdoor scenes were shot on actual film while the indoor shots were rendered to videotape. Noting those minor flaws which I mentioned previously, I can say without reservation that they are completely overcome by the inclusive comprehensive excellence of this superb mini-series.

Highly recommended!",1251676800,7,10670,5.941368078175896
815367,5,6304246579,"After having viewed all four film versions of War and Peace, this is the one that is the most thorough, well acted and accurate version of the Tolstoy classic.  When this series first aired in the 1970s, it inspired me to read the novel twice and with its nearly 15 hours length, it really provides the character development, historic depiction and range of scenes not found in any other version. I have found it great to watch in episodes in conjunction with reading the novel. In addition, the acting from Anthony Hopkins, Morag Hood and others is superb!

One of the great aspects of this BBC production is the degree to which the wide range of characters and scenes from the novel are depicted.  In the 1968 Sergei Bondarchuk version, for example, Nikolai Rostov is almost totally ignored, so the story of his romance with Sonya, rescue and later marriage to Maria is noticeably missing. In addition, the acting in the 1972 BBC version is so strong, it more than makes up for not having the elaborate battle productions of the Bondarchuk version, (although that version's Battle of Borodino is probably the most sweeping battle scene of the Napoleonic Wars ever filmed, with extensive cast and re-enactments).  The 1956 Hollywood version is perhaps the least compelling film depiction of the novel, in production values, being dated and in leaving so much out.

The fourth film version I've seen of War and Peace is the 2007 Italian TV series production with audio completely in English and directed by Robert Dornhelm.  That may be my second choice to the BBC version. It would very much appeal to modern audiences in terms of its visual appeal, high quality production values and drama.  Many of the scenes were filmed in Russia and Lithuania with an international cast. This version also depicts many key characters (e.g., Nikolai).  However, this version seems to add a range of scenes that were never in the novel with a focus on Helene and Anatole's scheming to deceive Natasha.  For example, it creates a scene in which Andrei in Poland instigates Anatole's marriage to a Polish peasant, which is the reason he couldn't have married Natasha when he seduced her.  Also, it depicts Nikolai and Natasha going to Helene and Pierre prior to his duel with Dolohov to discourage Pierre from fighting, and Nikolai supports Pierre and serves as his second in the duel. In contrast, Nikolai was actually DOLOHOV's second in the novel.  However, to someone who has not read the novel, these added or modified scenes add considerably to the drama, making the Italian version a very compelling and satisfying version to view.  I found myself rereading the novel to find out which scenes were changed or new scenes added but also appreciating that these changes positively added to the drama. In addition, the bewitching Violante Placido provides the best portrayal of a wicked Helene and Malcolm McDowell is superb as Andrei's father. Unfortunately, this Italian version appears to no longer be available for sale. Mine was a Russian version all-region DVD, but this is not a problem to view in English, since the dialogue is very well done in English and does not appear to be dubbed.  Hopefully, this Italian production will be re-introduced in the future for American audiences, especially because the dialogue is all in English, and because this 6 and a half hour, fast-paced version may appeal to modern audiences who may not have read the novel.

Yet, of the four film versions of War and Peace, it is the 1972 BBC version that I find to be the best, in terms of acting quality and depth of depicting the Tolstoy classic.  From a historic context, the BBC version provides more historic context on Napoleon's invasion with scenes with him (nicely portrayed by David Swift) strategizing with his generals and advisors.  Like the Bondarchuk version, Kutuzov is also portrayed well (by Frank Middlemass in the BBC version).  The BBC version also fully develops characters such as Pierre's transformation with a wide range of scenes (e.g., freemasonry, marriage and family life with Natasha following the war) that are not shown in the other versions.  This is the only version to actually conclude the novel as Tolstoy did with the epilogue showing Pierre and Natasha and Nikolai and Maria happily raising their families some eight years after the war.  Likewise, a range of supporting characters (e.g., Boris Drubetskoy) are only shown in this splendid production thanks to the depth of the 20 episodes. Character develop and historic perspective is best portrayed through these episodes. Since they occur in episodes and are accompanied by the richly illustrated viewer guide with background on the original production, it is a very pleasant experience to view the BBC series in episodes as television series like Masterpiece Theater years ago provided extended TV series for richer development of novels. This is important given the sweeping extent of Tolstoy's novel.

Lastly, it is great to see Anthony Hopkins in one of his earlier masterpieces portraying Pierre.  Morag Hood and Joanna David as Natasha and Sonya are good as well. The other actors, such as Sylvester Morand (Nikolai) and Alan Dobie (Andrei) are also good.  Given the strong acting, depth of portraying the novel and its characters, and accuracy to Tolstoy's storyline, I would suggest if you had to pick one version, the 1972 BBC DVD version (note - many scenes were deleted in the VHS version) would be my first choice.  Although if you love the novel and have reread it like I have, the 2007 Italian version and the 1968 Bondarchuk version are definitely worth a look too.",1251504000,7,5649,4.941921858500528
815368,4,6304246579,"I love this version; I saw it on my local PBS channel over thirty years ago, after reading the book for the first time.  It is a marvelous adaptation. Many of the previous reviews discuss the great job Anthony Hopkins did as Pierre (and I agree, he is terrific), but I must confess that I fell hopelessly in love with Alan Dobie's Prince Andrei when I was twelve, and I've carried a torch for him ever since.  Seriously, what is great about this version is that it allows the characters to develop and grow over time.  Most of it is through the dialogue:  for example, Pierre and Andrei's friendly argument over the liberation of the serfs doesn't move the plot along in any usual sense, but it does allow us to see the differences in their philosophy and great affection they have for each other.

However, it is not flawless.  It is dated and the special effects are fairly primitive(the Masonic ritual scene in particular is positively cringe-making), and I'm afraid I have to disagree with the scores of Morag Hood fans who seem to be out there.  She is far too old to be a convincing young Natasha:  she's supposed to be 17/18 when she meets Andrei, and she looks about 31. She is positively annoying when she's playing Natasha at 13.  She comes into her own when Andrei is dying, and she is very good in the Epilogue--not too surprising, as she is playing someone closer to her own age.

But having said that, it is a smashing production, and I highly recommend it.",1248825600,8,1471,4.496240601503759

815455,5,6304246579,"I've been looking for a video recording of this production for decades, and it has finally arrived in this DVD recording. It is accompanied by a 44 page booklet which I confess I haven't even opened yet, but I have indeed watched every episode. Perhaps I should have read the booklet before watching it, because apparently it explains things that puzzled me a little as I viewed these episodes for the first time in 30 years. After watching all 20 episodes on the DVDs, only then did I read the reviews of this DVD set on Amazon (except for the one negative review, on which I could not resist commenting before even watching the DVDs). It is only after reading these other reviews that I learned that this new set is more ""complete"" than what I'd watched on American TV 30 years earlier. It has a new first episode, ""Name Day"". As I watched the DVDs, I was only mildly puzzled that I didn't remember seeing that episode originally. After all, after 30 years, how could one be sure of remembering everything?

But now that I know about this addition, several other things I didn't remember from my original viewings can be explained. For example, several times as I was watching these DVD's there were stretches of a few minutes or so where I thought, ""Hmmm, this is boring; this section could easily have been edited out and no one would have missed it."" I don't remember a single moment of feeling this way when I watched the American version several times. Apparently those sections WERE edited out in the original American showing, to ""tighten up"" the narrative. So there were flaws in the original British showing that apparently were NOT there in the original American showing, which makes the original American version more memorable in my opinion.

Aside from that reservation, this new set is most welcome. As mentioned above, I've been waiting a long time for this release and I have thought for some time that perhaps it would never be released, for some inexplicable reason. Before I had gotten through the first viewing of this production 30 years ago, it had already prompted me to start my first reading of the novel itself, the first of five that I would make. I'd already seen the American version of the movie and it had not come close to prompting me to pick up the actual novel and read it. I can tell you that you get a very accurate feel for the novel in viewing this production, and you can just see these BBC characters alive in the novel itself, which speaks to the faithfulness of the BBC production.

As another reviewer has pointed out, Tolstoy's philosophy of war does accurately come out in this BBC production, through the thoughts and words of three of the characters, Pierre, Andre, and Kutuzov. In the novel, however, Tolstoy's philosophy is not conveyed nearly so explicitly in the actually words of the characters. Perhaps it's rather presumptuous for me to criticize the master that Tolstoy was, but it has always seemed to me a redundancy in the novel that Tolstoy included long, discursive chapters that were external to the narrative of the novel itself to explain his philosophy explicitly, as if he needed to bang us on the head with a hammer to get his ""points"" across. Thankfully, the BBC production could not do this and has the characters themselves speak his philosophy, as mentioned above. I've always thought that a pure novel should never do what Tolstoy did, that any ""philosophy"" should be implicit in the flow of the novel itself. That's a greater artistic challenge, to be sure, but it would almost by definition be more of a work of art if Tolstoy actually does this. After reading the novel three times, I decided to omit those discursive chapters and did so on my next two readings of the novel. I didn't seem to miss anything, although it's hard to judge, since I already had an understanding of his philosophy from having gone through these chapters in my previous three readings. In any case, I was left with the impression that nothing would be missed if Tolstoy had simply omitted those discursive chapters, and if I remember correctly he didn't have to put his philosophy into the mouths of his characters as much as the BBC production necessarily does. The narrative of the novel spoke for itself, as (in my opinion) an artistically successful, proper novel should. The BBC production manages very neatly to solve in a very believable manner the problem of conveying Tolstoy's philosophy of war in the thoughts and words of the three characters mentioned above, even though this is not done in the novel to nearly the extent it is done in the BBC production. It is just seemlessly incorporated into the style of the production, as we are made privy to the thoughts of the various characters (not just these three) throughout the presentation.

There are many deeply poignant moments throughout this BBC production, intensely felt moments that carry the viewer to the heights of emotion. One really gets carried along into the drama, very much like what happens in the novel itself. I can't remember ever seeing another video production of a novel that so successfully achieves this. For that reason alone, this is one of the greatest video productions of all time, not to be missed.",1199577600,30,5246,4.736323851203501

Anthony Hopkins was Pierre as I had visioned him when I read the book several years prior to seeing the series!  And I was able to convince my then husband to watch the series with me when Pierre married because of the costumes worn by the actress who played his wife!  I have often checked to see if it was to be shown again, but unfortunately, I missed the rebroadcast in the 1980!

And I've read the book several times.  This adaptation does NOT follow the book much at all; although the general progression is the same, many scenes have been jumbled around from where they appear in the original novel.  As an introduction to the novel, this is a great place to start though.  If you have to watch W&P start with Bondarchuk (for authenticity and fantastic battle sequences), this miniseries (for character study and completeness), and the Hollywood travesty starring Audrey Hepburn and Henry Fonda (for laughs).

815607,5,6304246579,"This remains the best and most complete version of the novel made to date.  These older BBC dramas have a certain timeless quality to them that seem lacking in the more polished versions today. I first saw this production when I was about 10 years old, and it made a lifelong impression on me.  Too bad kids today can't get hooked on something like this.

Looking at this series is almost like reading whole chapters from the novel.  Seldem does one find such a complete attempt to translate a book to television.  Many scenes are done in their entirety from the novel.  The acting is superb.  A young Anthony Hopkins converys all the confusion and complexity of Pierre in the book.  Morag Hood is an emotional and vulnerable Natasha. I certainly had a crush on her character when I was younger as did many others it seems! Prince Bolkonsky is dark and forebodding. Even minor characters get development in this production which is quite unique.

My version was taped directly off TV when it was shown for one of the last times in the 1980s.  In addition to the fine scenes showing the characters in Russia, the additional scenes showing Napolean and the Austerlitz and 1812 Campaigns are also wonderful.  Several noteworthy Napoleanic military historians were consulted for this production, and their fine imput is evident throughout.  The battle scenes, while perhaps small scale compared to today, are finely crafted and reflect the tactics and formations of the time. I wonder where these scenes were shot, as the extras don't look English for the most part.  The uniforms were researched by John Mollo, a noted historian for military costume.

The actor who plays Napolean is perhaps a bit tall, but his mannerisms seem quite accurate.  He makes an impressive L'Empereur! All the actors were part of BBC stock at the time, and they appeared in many other productions.  All of them were good.  The wonderful Russian Imperial Anthem is played by the Band of the Welsh Guards under Major Desmond Walker.  This band was quite popular with the BBC at the time and produced several LPs under their label.  They also toured the USA with the Argylls around this time, and shall be returning to the USA in early 2006 with the Black Watch.  This is perhaps one of the finest adaptations you will ever find for any classic novel.  This is an example how fine Cinema can be in transcribing a novel to the screen.  Too bad it is seldom done so well these days.

This series deserves to be brought back out on DVD where improved picture and sound qaulity can only enhance the brilliance of its production.",1134518400,8,2596,4.72

Also Natasha Rostova played by Morag Hood is a very interesting and free-spirited character. Ms. Hood has really brought natasha to life, so much so that sometimes you can't wait to watch what she's going to do next. The scenic backgrounds of Russia are beautiful and as always Anthony Hopkins dazzles in his rendition of Pierre. Anyone interesting in seeing a movie version of War & Peace must watch this and not the more recent Hollywood type versions (very dry and boring - would think it was shot in Texas).

I bought the booklet released by the BBC at the time,and still have it.

I have been after this for soooo long.

I know Hopkins et all are good,but it is the young Morag Hood as Natashia that makes this special.

I don't know what became of this  fine actress,but I was/am besotted!!

I do hope the 6 Videos include all the scenes.

When broadcast again in 1974,scenes such as Natashia dancing after a ""hunt"" were left out.

Delightful Russian dancing!

This isn't a review as I am waiting on the videos,but it is the only TV series,or movie that has remained in my minda as ""special"".",1113609600,9,748,4.2785714285714285
815610,5,6304246579,"I first viewed the 1972 BBC dramatization of Tolstoy's War and Peace when it was broadcast around 1982 on Masterpiece Theater as 14 one-hour episodes.  Captivated by the panoply of gowns, uniforms and palatial interiors and enchanted by the capricious dynamics between the many characters, I had no interest in or understanding of the ""war"" aspect of the story.  Indeed, the myriad explanations of military strategy were tedious to me at the time.  I had attempted to read Tolstoy's novel many times but found the Russian names difficult to grasp and differentiate.  The best result of my viewing of this film series was that it inspired me to finally have the courage to read the book.  The film provided proper pronunciation of the names and gave me faces to connect to the names; this made the reading much more pleasurable.

To my knowledge, PBS never rebroadcast this War and Peace, as so many other excellent and memorable programs have not been aired a second or third time, no matter how worthy.  So I am grateful to the deities of video for blessing us with VHS/DVD.  Viewing this series again, I am surprised by the things I didn't notice or appreciate on my first and second viewings.  How did I overlook or ignore all the philosophical asides delivered by Pierre and Andrei?  It was as if I were seeing this program for the first time and had never read the book - which I am now inspired to give a second reading.

Anthony Hopkins is superb as the mumbling, stumbling Pierre who is constantly searching for something to which he may devote his simmering passion - despite the deceit and crassness he encounters in his society.

Like Natasha (the nubile heroine), I could not help falling in love with Pierre's friend the brooding, dutiful and pensive Andrei, masterfully portrayed by Alan Dobie.

The beautiful gowns, uniforms and gentlemen's wear were created by Charles Knode, the costume designer who won the Academy Award for his creations in Blade Runner.

The story covers fifteen years with the War of 1812 in between, so the setup may seem slow and wearisome.  The point is to follow how people grow (or not) through their experiences with each other and the circumstances in which they are thrown.  Like the rest of us, these characters have ""issues"" - even before Napoleon imposed himself on them.  However, as nearly all the characters become enmeshed in its effects, war accelerates ""process"".

To watch this movie now (2004) is eerie.  War and peace.  We certainly have war.  Where is peace?  Tolstoy, who died in 1910, first published his novel in 1865-1869.  It is ironic that in the film, as he ponders the comet of 1812, Pierre wonders what the world will be like when the comet returns in a hundred years.  The viewer has the benefit of knowing what neither Pierre nor Tolstoy could know, that the status quo of Russia in 1812 or 1820 suffers brutal and irreversible devastation.

In the film Napoleon's reason for invading Russia is so he can impose his universal code over all of Europe, referred to in the book as the Continental System, so that instead of scores of states and principalities, each with their own laws and courts, all of Europe would be governed under one set of laws, with one court system and one currency.  Napoleon has nearly got his wish.  What would he think of the EU - of which Russia is not a member?",1106006400,35,3360,4.708904109589041

There were no Stars in this BBC production, just excellent actors.

I watched this first tape while walking on a treadmill and was hooked--not only that I had walked for over two hours and had covered five miles! Almost needless to say I poured through the entire series shortly thereafter. Hopkins is great (he was about 30 at the time). If you want a good case study of human nature and the human condition in which it is encased then check this thing out. I should mention that I have not as of yet read the novel itself, but I suspect it shall be even better as is almost always the case when comparing novels and filmed versions.
I see a previous reviewer is complaining about lack of scenery and music. Don't worry about it, the sparseness helps you concentrate on the very human scenes and the dialogue. I never missed the visuals. Don't get me wrong, there are still very ornate interiors, but if you concentrate on the story everything will become timeless anyway.

7865597,5,6304246579,"An extraordinary TV series, running nearly 15 hours and never boring. I'm a huge admirer of the USSR's version of War and Peace (directed by Sergei Bondarchuk), but this version really shouldn't be compared to that version. This is a much more intimate affair that Bondarchuk's version. You really get inside Tolstoy's characters. It's also nice to see a series that is leisurely paced (but doesn't feel padded, like a lot of modern TV shows). The director, John Davies, actually frames shots in this version (beautifully I might add), and it's a nice contrast to all the rapid editing and hand held camera work you get in modern TV series. There is hardly any incidental music in the series, which lets the dialogue and performances really come to the fore front. It really enhances the humanism of Tolstoy's masterpiece. All of the acting is wonderful, especially Hopkins (as Pierre) and Dobie (as Prince Andrei). There are some who have been critical of Morag Hood's performance as Natasha. Well, there is some truth there. When she plays Natasha as a teenager, she looks too old to be playing a teenager, and she overacts. However, as the series progresses and her character matures, Morag's performance is filled with brilliant nuance (especially in the scenes where she's at Prince Andrei's death bed), and Morag's performance improves exponentially as the series progresses. The battle scenes are surprisingly good, quite harrowing for a 1972 BBC production, and have decent scope for a BBC series.  Perhaps the makers of this series saw the Russian version beforehand, which has amazing action sequences.  This is a wonderful series.",1501977600,,1641,5.074074074074074
