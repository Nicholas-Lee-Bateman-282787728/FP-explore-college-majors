It seems to be better now visually than the version I had back in 2004. It's my favourite live concert,besides Jeff Beck live at Ronnie Scotts live. Peter.",1426032000,,271,4.666666666666667
8303760,5,B001G3ZS1Q,"Having seen yes a couple of times in my early youth in a fuzzy state, I always remembered they`re shows as awsome!! Now That I can watch them in the privacy of my man cave in surround sound , or with my sennheiser headphones, I am really able to enjoy every sound and visual off of this dvd. I collected all my favorite bands dvd`s from my youth, and this one has to be in the high top 5`s!!! Worth every penny and a hundred views! Nowadays, the music sounds just awsome with a fine bourbon in hand!!!!!",1402617600,,503,4.142857142857143
