7077117,5,B00V7ORX30,"aww,  this was a good one. I'm a sucker for this area of anime, all those clannad's and amagami's and the like. I love shonen jumps too but every so often I need a slice of life/romance and this made me content. after it's all done your okay, you can move on to the next show, yet I did feel like another episode or so couldn't hurt but if not, then meh.",1445472000,,354,3.9166666666666665
7077118,4,B00V7ORX30,"This a very cute Japanese anime... The unbelievable premise is about a boy who tries to befriend a quiet girl in school... The problem is the girl cannot remember anyone she meets outside her family every Monday.... She remembers her school work and family members but she forgets about any friends she may have had made.

The boy tries to help her remember and makes some progress but any type of stress causes her to revert back to her amnesiac state.  The art is pretty nice with a subtle color palette.  The storyline is very good and is an excellent family slice of life show...",1444348800,2,583,4.533333333333333

7077121,5,B00V7ORX30,Came within a few days and I love the series deeply!,1439856000,,52,3.8181818181818183
7077122,5,B00V7ORX30,"This is by far one of the best anime I've watched in some time. If you are looking for a sweet story that will make you constantly smile from cuteness, but still have depth and emotion, watch this show. In 12 episodes, they manage to do so much more than some 20+ episode anime.  I pre-ordered this because I needed it in my collection as soon as possible. I hope there's a season 2.",1437264000,2,383,4.175675675675675
7077123,5,B00V7ORX30,"A fantastic and beautiful story of how friendship and love can overcome any obstacle. There is no aspect of this series that is lacking; the music, animation, art and voices all perfectly complement this series. I watched it once during its initial weekly airing and a second time marathoned in a single sitting and enjoyed it just as much both times.

A recommended must for any fan of touching romance, light hearted slice of life or peaceful coming of age stories. If you are not a fan of these genres, this series might just be enough to open your mind a little.",1435017600,10,566,4.549019607843137
7077124,4,B00V7ORX30,"Yuuki Hase notices that his classmate Kaori Kujomiya always seems to be alone, so he decides to try and befriend her. She rebuffs his overtures at first, but soon reveals that it isn't that she is unfriendly, she just suffers a condition that causes her memory to be reset every week. Its hard to make friends when you cant remember them, but Yuuki is determined to make it happen.

This was a cute show. At some points Yuukis obsession with Kaori becomes annoying/worrisome, but overall they have a good relationship. It was actually kind of funny how long it took Yuuki to realize he actually had a crush on Kaori (the only person denser than him is Kaori).

My favorite part of the series was actually the subplot that involved to secondary characters (Kiryuu and Saki). It was cute and they are my two favorite characters :)

The premise is an interesting idea and the show does a fairly good job of tackling the issue in a believable way. I think the biggest weaknesses were that it goes kind of slowly at times and in the end I couldn't really buy into the reason for Kaoris memory impairment. But for the most part it is a sweet little story of romance and friendship.",1430870400,6,1175,4.507042253521127
8709469,4,B00V7ORX30,"If you like sweet and slice-of-life, you'll love this story(though I am biased) when I was in 5th grade I got my first female friend this way as this condition is real but rare. Anyway that was over 32yrs ago and she has been gone for 5yrs now but I still love and remember my friend. Its actually kind of disturbing how similar the mal lead is to me at that time. Please buy and enjoy this show.(with a loved one if possible).",1520640000,,427,4.156626506024097
8709470,5,B00V7ORX30,I like the story were the boy has to prove his love for this girl,1482278400,,65,3.4
8709471,5,B00V7ORX30,Very cute story,1478563200,,15,4.333333333333333
8709472,5,B00V7ORX30,Great story.  It was hart warming. The artwork was good. Girl may like it better then guys.,1460332800,,91,4.352941176470588
8709473,2,B00V7ORX30,I absolutely love this anime. However I was extremely disappointed when it arrived because not only was the case was crushed and now won't stay closed but disc 2 wasn't securely in place; luckily it didn't get scratched.,1458172800,,220,4.815789473684211
8709474,1,B00V7ORX30,"Sorry, but this is the highest production value on the most empty and boring anime I have ever seen or spent $40 on ever. I am surprised at the price and not happy I bought it. I should have checked it out on Hulu first where I saw it listed.",1453161600,,242,3.86
8709475,5,B00V7ORX30,"An all time-favorite. Love the premise even if others have done similar things if only because it is done so very well here. The animation is a bit simple but also endearing, I particularly love that the characters all have a few strands of flyaway hairs instead of the perfectly impossible hair from many series. The voice acting is cute, the character development is there (at least enough for such a short series), and it is truly heartwarming. It will definitely put a smile on your face.",1452816000,,492,4.666666666666667
8709476,5,B00V7ORX30,"This anime is very special to me. When watching this during a dark time in my life, this anime brought me nothing short of pure happiness. One week friends is the cutest most heartwarming japanese anime I have ever come across. The story is simple and innocent- a young boy wishes to befriend a young girl. However the young girl has a weird condition. At the end of each week- memories of her friends disappear (hence the name one week friends). The boy remains persistent and this show is a story of his journey through trying to achieve the status of being permanently called the girl's ""friend"".

The pastel colors give the visuals a nice warm feeling which illustrate the emotions that come across in the show. Short sweet and simple, this show is a must watch. Never before have I smiled so much while watching a show. The enjoyability and production value of this anime is high. The characters are lovable and relatable. Just overall a great show.",1451952000,2,954,4.644970414201183
8709477,5,B00V7ORX30,"One Week Friends is a somewhat sentimental anime, but it so naturally avoids melodrama that you can almost forget. And it does not do so with jarring humor. The humorous moments are frequent, but they seem less like comic relief than just a natural part of the story.

Fujimiyas memory loss is really a fantasy element in this series, and not portrayed realistically. But there are several aspects of this anime that are very true to life, such as Hases first steps in learning what it means to be a real friend to Fujimiya. The ending is a real triumph in that it is neither affectedly bittersweet nor unrealistically ideal. There is ultimately a lot of substance in this anime, but it is never heavy-handed with its messages.

I was worried that this series might dissolve into a harem anime, or start to rely on fanservice. But aside from one or two inappropriate comments, this series remains clean and innocent. In addition, while Hase and Fujimiya certainly have feelings for each other, their relationship does not move too fast or distinctly into a romantic one. I think this demonstrates a lot of wisdom on the part of the creators, as this would not have been realistic considering the complications of Fujimiyas condition. The romance, such as it is, is simply there naturally, and the focus of the story is not on when one of them will confess their love and how the other will respond, but rather on their continuous effort to maintain their friendship despite the obstacles.

This is a slow-moving, slice-of-life anime that feels very calm. The soundtrack is played more quietly than any Ive ever heard, while the style of music itself is very relaxed. It fits perfectly with every scene, and remains unobtrusive, but at the same time there aren't any very memorable themes. I did detect the sound of an organ more than once, which made for a unique tone.

The art style is a little strange, but its fun to see something new. The faces have very little detail, but the scenery is absolutely breathtaking at times. I think some of the characters movement could have been a little smoother and more natural, but it is easy to see how new this series is from the quality of the animation.

There is not much of a supporting cast, but I think that too many characters would have detracted from the overall development of each one. I appreciated seeing secondary characters that were actually unique rather than the same old stereotypes, and they were all likable and interesting.

Overall, One Week Friends shines in substance and execution, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a quiet anime with a realistic and insightful take on friendship, romantic or otherwise.",1451174400,3,2688,4.769892473118279
