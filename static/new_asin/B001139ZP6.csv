This is her second copy of each since the older discs became broken and scratched with her use.  Now, another adult handles them.  I still enjoy listening to them too.  I wish that there were more like this.  Whether you believe or not, the music is worth it.",1262995200,,407,4.276315789473684

3059089,4,B001139ZP6,"When telling an old testement story a director has the delicate task of making it so it would please Jews first and then Christians second. This isn't always a simple task if you want to take enough artistic license to not have a boring word for word recount of what could be read in either one's copy of Scripture. These two movies however do rise to the challenge quite well. Both stand on their own two feet well enough to be enjoyed simply as movie and while both have their weaknesses they definitely deserve more than a dusty corner of a Baptist nursery (unlike 99% of other attempts at turning Bible stories into motion pictures for kids.) The simple fact is the stories found in Judaic writings are not for children, they are written by adults for adults and often document (though not in great detail) historical accounts of evil horrors committed by evil people. The massacre of the Hebrew boys and the seduction of Joseph are two examples of very distasteful events that cannot be swept under the rug when telling these stories. However the stories are both told quite tactfully. There are some disappointments to be found in both; the quality of Joseph, King of Dreams is noticeably lower than that of Prince of Egypt, and while Prince of Egypt has a beautiful culture-filled soundtrack featuring singing in the Herbrew language and instruments that seem to take you to the Middle East Joseph is mostly piano music that sounds like it was copied iff your mom's inspirational cassette tape (you know, the one you didn't like back then either?). I have to give Prince of Egypt a raspberry because Moses's wife Zapora is not black, she is darker brown but historically the Midianites were very black people and later after the Exodus God punishes Mariem and Aaron for giving Moses a hard time over being married to a woman of such a noticeably different race. Remembering that bible story does take some of the magic out of the There Can Be Miracles duet the two sister-in-laws sing together but most people have never read that far into the Old Testement and l found the song to be very mediocre anyway. Such nit-picking is to be found in any Bible story retelling if you are as familiar with the writings as l am or more but for the family couch it does do the stories justice. My kids watch Prince of Egypt every Passover after Seder and though if the day comes that they read it themselves there will be a lot of ""Hey, that's not how it happened in Prince of Egypt"" the soul of every story is there. Christian Bale and Russel Crow could have learned a lot from these DreamWorks movies. I wish they had made more; Elijah, Daniel, David, Noah; they would be lining my shelf.",1461542400,,2685,4.584199584199585

Definitely worth owning. The Joseph movie is not quite as strong. Still good, and the Joseph story is amazing in and of itself, but the movie didn't quite do it justice.

I will say these are pretty well done, and King of Dreams is actually pretty close to the Bible. Most of the music is pretty catchy and I actually enjoy watching with my granddaughter.

The Exodus story has some intense history and much of it is here. make sure your child is age appropriate for some slightly intense images of the infamous dreams of the Baker and of Pharoah.",1328313600,16,512,4.637362637362638

I read a review that one reviewer was disappointed that the videos really don't mention God all that much.  Well, if I recall correctly the actual stories in the Bible don't explicitly mention God that much either; it is mostly implied.

3293586,4,B001139ZP6,"When telling an old testement story a director has the delicate task of making it so it would please Jews first and then Christians second. This isn't always a simple task if you want to take enough artistic license to not have a boring word for word recount of what could be read in either one's copy of Scripture. These two movies however do rise to the challenge quite well. Both stand on their own two feet well enough to be enjoyed simply as movie and while both have their weaknesses they definitely deserve more than a dusty corner of a Baptist nursery (unlike 99% of other attempts at turning Bible stories into motion pictures for kids.) The simple fact is the stories found in Judaic writings are not for children, they are written by adults for adults and often document (though not in great detail) historical accounts of evil horrors committed by evil people. The massacre of the Hebrew boys and the seduction of Joseph are two examples of very distasteful events that cannot be swept under the rug when telling these stories. However the stories are both told quite tactfully. There are some disappointments to be found in both; the quality of Joseph, King of Dreams is noticeably lower than that of Prince of Egypt, and while Prince of Egypt has a beautiful culture-filled soundtrack featuring singing in the Herbrew language and instruments that seem to take you to the Middle East Joseph is mostly piano music that sounds like it was copied iff your mom's inspirational cassette tape (you know, the one you didn't like back then either?). I have to give Prince of Egypt a raspberry because Moses's wife Zapora is not black, she is darker brown but historically the Midianites were very black people and later after the Exodus God punishes Mariem and Aaron for giving Moses a hard time over being married to a woman of such a noticeably different race. Remembering that bible story does take some of the magic out of the There Can Be Miracles duet the two sister-in-laws sing together but most people have never read that far into the Old Testement and l found the song to be very mediocre anyway. Such nit-picking is to be found in any Bible story retelling if you are as familiar with the writings as l am or more but for the family couch it does do the stories justice. My kids watch Prince of Egypt every Passover after Seder and though if the day comes that they read it themselves there will be a lot of ""Hey, that's not how it happened in Prince of Egypt"" the soul of every story is there. Christian Bale and Russel Crow could have learned a lot from these DreamWorks movies. I wish they had made more; Elijah, Daniel, David, Noah; they would be lining my shelf.",1461542400,,2685,4.584199584199585

Definitely worth owning. The Joseph movie is not quite as strong. Still good, and the Joseph story is amazing in and of itself, but the movie didn't quite do it justice.
