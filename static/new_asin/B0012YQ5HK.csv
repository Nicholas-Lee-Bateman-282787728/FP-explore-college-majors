8248281,3,B0012YQ5HK,"1970's Science Fiction Drama.  The film has the ""feel"" of The Planet of the Apes TV series.  In Stranded In Space you have the ""Perfect Order"" running things instead of a band of smart apes.  Similar plot lines, marooned astronauts trying to survive against all ods against the established authorities on the world where they landed. Now if the ape astronauts from the planet of the apes were marooned on Terra . . . you'd probably have an interesting story line and a copright infringement lawsuit.  However the movie is available on DVD in a recent MST3K release from Shout! Factory.",1471478400,,585,4.762376237623762
8248282,4,B0012YQ5HK,"The tantalizing possibilities of a never-picked-up sci fi series called THE STRANGER (1973)
are considerable. This well-made Bing Crosby company production is the first and only
chapter in what by all indications would've been a most exciting weekly series.

They certainly pulled out all the stops during this two-hour TV movie pilot. Several
chase scenes, including a car vs. helicopter race in a rural (or park) setting, the
elimination of our central character's only two allies, and his apparent immolation
in a huge explosion lead to a nine lives finale, a classic cliffhanger that was not
to be continued.

This sub-par quality VHS of THE STRANGER is as of 6/15 the only available home video.
Unfortunately, video quality is poor, with far too much contrast and darkness throughout.
A DVD transfer available from an indy outfit is clearly from this defective tape.

Although worth seeing, the experience is ultimately frustrating, for we're teased with an
unfilled promise of more to come. At current ""collectable"" prices, the VHS is NOT recommended.

Cast includes Glenn Corbett as central character Neil Stryker, who may or may not be the only
astronaut of three to survive a crash landing on a doppelg&auml;nger Earth that's called Terra.
Cameron Mitchell is Stryker's main enemy and pursuer, but some indication is given that his
role in future episodes my have been slated for another actor, possibly Steve Franken.

Of Stryker's only friends, one is given a mind-controlling brain surgery, the other is killed by
a sheet of machine gun bullets. For the record they are Sharon Acker and Lew Ayres.
Also in the cast are Dean Jagger George Coulouris, H.M. Wynant and Virginia Gregg, as the
woman in charge of an ominous brainwashing operation simply called Ward E.

Orwellian in its politics, with a unified society of obedient citizens who are watched by their
TVs, the other obvious influence here is 60s adventure series,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-FUGITIVE/dp/B008OIQYXM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE FUGITIVE</a>.",1433635200,3,2081,5.4672897196261685
8248283,3,B0012YQ5HK,"Cross planet of the apes with the fugitive, add a dash of every perfect utopian future gone wrong scifi movie you've ever seen and strip away the apes and the budget and you wind up with this 70s made for tv oddity. I liked it and would have liked to have seen more of this man on the run on another planet show, however everyone fro 1973 disagreed with me. The vhs is very rare hense the ridiculous price. It's been part of some of those scifi 50 packs so I suggest seeking it there. The quality of the tape is only so so. The night scenes are hard to make out. Love the cheap 3 moons that show up in the film!",1417564800,2,611,3.975609756097561
