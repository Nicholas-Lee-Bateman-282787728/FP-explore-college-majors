My Sunday School class loves this DVD.  They range in age from 4 to 6 years old.  They love the animation.  I love the Biblical foundation it provides.  Most Bible cartoons aren't are intelligent and informative as this series or as well made.  Each story opens with Theo singing a hymn of the faith appropriate to the story.  This series helps children understand what it means to be a Christian.  The DVD says it's recommended for school age kids, but my younger kids enjoy it also, although they may not comprehend it as much.  I also purchased Volume 3 Theo Foundations of the Christian Life.  Volume 2 Theo Foundations of Salvation doesn't appear to be available.

Teaching children theology will give them a Biblical foundation.  Looking at the popularity of some TV preachers who twist and distort Scripture one wonders if adult Christians should consider purchasing these so they can get a real Christian foundation to build on.",1344729600,2,1779,4.979591836734694
