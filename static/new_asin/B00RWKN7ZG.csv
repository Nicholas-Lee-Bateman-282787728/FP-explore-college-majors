8696164,4,B00RWKN7ZG,"It's shocking that there are only two reviews of this film. It's way too good of a film for that. Desiree Akhavan's debut feature from Sundance has a dry east-coast humor that may make some Angelenos cringe at all the self-deprecation, but it's still very, very funny.

Somehow, acting and directing seem to come naturally as simultaneous activities for her because she's eqully adept at both. Sorta like Lena Dunham's ""Girls"" HBO series but through the eyes of a bi/lesbian who has Iranian heritage, Akhavan plays Shireen like a Hannah with 18 more clues about life, but none about relationships. Maybe she was hired to do ""Girls"" because she does so much better than Dunham in her Brooklyn existence.

Shireen is just as lost as most young women from privilege in NYC, suffering from both a lack of awareness of how she comes off as well as a lack of respect from almost every person in her life. The film features Shireen mostly trying to get over a failed live-in relationship that combusts because she cannot confirm her interest in women to her family. The photo on the poster comes from a really hot scene in which her bi tendencies leads into a random threesome with a hetero couple, but the film is more about the comedy of finding yourself than an ernest search for acceptance or even love or sex. It's like ""Girls"" but way smarter, and about someone you actually grow to respect.  More people need to watch this film!",1438214400,,1428,4.658730158730159

8696166,5,B00RWKN7ZG,"I make an effort not to know too much about a film before I see it. That helps me have an experience less tainted by expectations, but it can also lead me to silly snap judgments that are dead wrong.

After a few minutes I'd decided that Desiree Akhavan's Appropriate Behavior was just another in a long string of low budget 20- something self-involved dramedies I've seen in the last couple of years. But by the end I realized that Akhavan had taken that trope, and run her own unique and very funny spin on it. And the humor was a big part of what made it special. This movie was flat out funny. It wasn't afraid of being absurd or larger than life, or actively witty. It was intensely human and touching at times, but it also had great comic timing. In that respect Ahkavan's cinematic view of life and relationships in New York has more in common with Woody Allen circa Annie Hall and Manhattan than most mumblecore we've grown used to. She also created a unusually lovable (if self-sabotaging) main character for herself in Shirin; a bi-sexual young Iranian woman still in the closet to her parents, and attempting to recover from a painful breakup.

Shirin doesn't really fit in anywhere. Because she's bi, lesbians (including the woman who broke her heart) view her with suspicion, assuming she's 'just visiting' relationships with women. Her parents keep waiting for her to meet a nice boy. She feels estranged from the Iranian-American culture she grew up with, but she's not as self-consciously hip and cool as the hipster poseurs she's surrounded by. And she has a knack for making some comic but awful life decisions, from a painfully failed threesome, to a gig teaching film-making to disinterested 5 year olds.

This is a rueful and smart film about how screwed up and alone we all are and yet how sweet life is in it's sad and silly way. It's an impressive calling card for Akhavan, and I'm looking forward to seeing what she does next.

Follow up - a recent second viewing made me just love and respect this film even more.  Some films you stumble upon without knowing much, seem better then they are on 1st viewing.  But not this.  It more than held up.  The funny side was as funny as ever, but I found it even more touching, (and quirkily sexy) the second time around.  I'm raising my rating from 4 to 5 stars.",1422662400,3,2329,4.552631578947368
