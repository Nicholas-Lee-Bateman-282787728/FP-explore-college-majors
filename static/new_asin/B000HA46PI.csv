2632412,5,B000HA46PI,"Absolutely loved this series.  I used to watch it on PBS and am thrilled to have finally found it.  So thrilled that I refuse to wait for a Region 1 (US) release.  If you are a fan of British comedy, you will like this one.

For those who do not have a multi region DVD player, you should check your Blu Ray player.  I own a relatively cheap Toshiba and it plays multiple regions.  I have switched back and forth between different regions without a problem.  I recommend checking out your current set up before shelling out the bucks for a region 2 capable player.",1401148800,3,564,4.314285714285714
2632413,1,B000HA46PI,i did not like this. it was not funny at all. my husband and I did not get a laugh..,1396828800,,84,3.25
2632414,5,B000HA46PI,"I bought a code-free player specifically to view this series, and it's one of the best, if not the best of the Britcoms. Why it hasn't been broadcast more widely in the US is a mystery. The producers did a smart thing by combining the seasoned teams of Shane/Holland/Pollard from ""Hi-de-hi"" and  Hewlett/Knowles from ""It Ain't Half Hot, Mom""; both teams hit the ground running, their ensemble chemistry and timing already well-developed.

Ostensibly a parody of ""Upstairs, Downstairs,"" YRM'L is a comic drama in its own right, with clever writing, engaging characters, great acting, and a cohesive storyline. Costumes, sets and production quality are all first class, making the ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" comparison more pointed.

It starts with a flashback to WWI, when two infantrymen accidentally rescue an injured officer. After the war, he hires one, James Twelvetrees, as footman. Twelvetrees thinks he's on track to become butler, when his old army comrade, Alf Stokes, shows up and gets the job instead. Stokes is a dishonest but charming Yorkshire rogue in stark contrast to Twelvetrees, who's honorable but pompous; the constant friction between the two leads to many comic emergencies that the ""Downstairs"" servants do their best to conceal from their ""Upstairs"" employers. If Stokes is the anti-Mr. Hudson, then the anti-Rose is Stokes' bespectacled daughter, Ivy, whom he hires as parlor maid, not telling anyone that he's her father.

YRM'L is largely about the misadventures of simple-minded, good-hearted Ivy in the Meldrum household, whether fending off the advances of Mr. Teddy (who has a penchant for servant girls who smell of carbolic soap), trying to stop her Socialist father from redistributing Lord Meldrum's wealth into his own pocket, or pining for the snobbish, insensible James. Played by Su Pollard sometimes with broad comedy and often great sensitivity, she comes across as the character with the best balance of integrity and compassion.

Several other storylines run through the series, including Lord Meldrum's affair with Lady Agatha, and her husband's mad efforts to catch them at it; Mr. Teddy's pursuit of maidservants, and aging heiress Madge Cartwright's pursuit of Mr. Teddy (she's played by Yvonne Marsh, sister of Jean Marsh, the original U/D maid Rose); Poppy Meldrum's flirtation with the infatuated James; and eccentric old Lady Lavender's efforts to rendevous with her long lost love, Captain Dalby.

Two of my favorite characters are the footman Henry, whose deadpan-accurate commentary usually earns him a box on the ear, and the scullery maid, Mabel, usually seen pathetically hovering over the servants' dinner table, and getting nothing but scraps: ""Kipper skins, chicken bits, and a pot with a broken handle--my old man will think it's Christmas!""

26 episodes, 50 minutes each, and a very catchy intro and credits tune. Well worth the additional cost of the code-free player!

NOTE: I had trouble playing 2 of the disks in the set on my laptop DVD, but they all play normally on a standard code-free DVD player.",1393286400,,3064,5.238775510204082
2632415,5,B000HA46PI,"I had never heard of this series and simply found it by accident while on YouTube.  After a couple of episodes, I knew I had to own the whole collection!  It's a wonderful farce of those living downstairs while serving the sometimes oddball characters living upstairs.  Lots of fun and a certain innocence which is so sadly missing in today's TV shows.

I highly recommend this video set to all who love British humour!",1388534400,3,419,4.621621621621622
2632416,5,B000HA46PI,"Great, relaxing light comedy, a la pompous, ""British flavor"". After dinner, settling in entertainment. Bittersweet in discovering the loss of many of the dynamic characters in this series --- and simple aging of those yet surviving.  Recommended for any and all Anglophiles.",1384646400,2,274,5.523809523809524
2632417,5,B000HA46PI,"This has got to be one of the greatest comedies ever written. With the trio of Paul Shane, Jeffery Holland and Su Pollard, should rank as one of the top programs from British television. Far and above anything produced for television in the US.",1382832000,2,244,4.568181818181818
2632418,5,B000HA46PI,"If you like British comedy, this one should definitely be on your list to see. bit different than most, but still in the good style we all love",1380672000,,143,4.142857142857143

2632420,5,B000HA46PI,"Great series, wish they could have kept it going... It arrived in less time than expected, i had to get a multi format DVD player because is a different DVD format than US but, no big deal!",1369699200,4,189,4.135135135135135
8137800,5,B000HA46PI,The cast of Hi De Hi and Dad's Army combine to tell the story of life at a Manor House in the 1920's.  Both the servants and the Titled family get up to all kinds of insane fun.  Another GREAT Britcom!,1514678400,,201,3.8780487804878048
8137801,5,B000HA46PI,"The funny, and more honest, reverse of Upstairs, Downstairs, and Downton Abbey. The lordships rule as though they were gods, and the downstairs rips them off as a matter of course. I knew in advance that my DVDs would not work with my TV. I live in upstate New York. A simple solution, Panasonic sells a converter (good for almost any format) for $50. Order it online. Plug it in and you are all set. And its good for other Brit programs I intend to buy. The picture quality and the sound are great. And it is funny. Not to mention Mr. Freddy, his Lordship's brother, whose hearts beats at the thought of serving maids with scrubbed faces, coarse nightgowns and who smell of carbolic soap. And oh, the family owns the Union Jack Rubber company, which specializes in the production of gentlemen's personal wear.",1502409600,,810,4.593103448275862

8137807,5,B000HA46PI,"Fantastic show, gets some flack for the Miss Cissy vs Mr Teddy treatment but if you watch the entire series you'll see it's unfounded.  Su Pollard is amazing per usual.  It's good clean vulgar fun as the old saying goes! Only not all that vulgar for todays standards but definitely fun!",1455753600,,286,4.588235294117647
8137808,4,B000HA46PI,"Please, Please, Please make available in US.  This show would be a big hit, here!  Was ready to purchase all seasons when I discovered will not work on our DVD players.  What about PRIME, at least!?",1434067200,3,198,4.444444444444445
