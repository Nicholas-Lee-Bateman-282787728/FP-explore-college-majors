3876063,5,B00294MMU6,"When this show first aired in the U.S. in the late 1960s, I remember rushing home from grade school to see it. This Japanese import follows the adventures of a young race car driver improbably named Speed Racer.  It features exciting adventures that take our hero all over the world, bizarre plots and villains, and fantastic gadgets, best exemplified by the hero's car, the Mach 5. This amazing vehicle, which was designed and built by Speed's father, Pops Racer, can jump over obstacles, run underwater, and cut swaths through a dense forest with its unfurling front saws (though I always wondered why the stumps weren't a problem).

Recurring visual motifs include racing along impossible chasm-clinging passes, driving on high mountain roads,  and zooming past sparkling water. Another recurring element is characters with strange and funny names like: Tongue Blaggard, Lightfingers Klepto, Snake Oiler, Zoomer Slick, Splint Femur, Slash Marker, Ali Ben Schemer, and many, many more. But by far, the most recognizable part of the show would have to be that title sequence and catchy theme song, which replaced a strange chanted march-like tune in the original Japanese.

This property started as a Japanese Manga comic book by Tatsuo Yoshida called ""Mach Go Go Go,"" which he made into an animated television series by the same name in 1967. Peter Fernandez was responsible for ""Americanizing"" the show when it came to the U.S. in syndication to independent stations the following year under the name Speed Racer. Fernandez wrote the English dialog (including the theme song and those bizarre character names),cast and directed the American voice actors, and performs the voices of both Speed and Racer X. A total of four voice actors, including one woman who voices all the female characters, provided all the voices for the show. That woman, Corinne Orr, is also the voice of the Snuggles fabric softener bear.

A contemporary of the original ""Scooby Doo Where Are You?"" series, Speed Racer was different and never seemed ""cartoony."" About half the shows are two- to three-episode story arcs, and it utilizes interesting camera angles and inventive scene-changing wipes. Towards the beginning of every episode, they freeze frame at a dramatic moment for effect. Because of the way the anime is drawn, you're never really sure if Speed the character is supposed to be 12 or 25, although one episode references him being 18. The animation isn't always smooth. Even a casual view reveals that the animators often saved money by looping  the same few seconds of animation, such as roadside scenery going by. Other times, characters' mouths don't move when they're talking out loud and occasionally, you find yourself staring at a still picture for five to ten seconds. Speed and company get into some kind of peril most every episode and they often respond by making this strange scared-moaning vocalization that normal people can't do - Ohhhh-Ohhhh-Ohhhhh! While there's almost never any gore, there is a fair amount of violence, even though one to two minutes was edited out of each episode of the Japanese version, so keep that in mind for younger viewers.

My favorite episodes would have to include ""The Most Dangerous Race,"" ""The Fire Race,"" ""The Fastest Car on Earth,"" ""The Royal Racer,""  ""The Race Against Time,"" ""Motorcycle Apaches,"" ""The Race Against the Mammoth Car,"" and ""Race Around the World."" Some of the ideas in these shows really sparked and captured my imagination long before other iconic properties like Star Wars, or Indiana Jones came along. Some of the vehicle designs are pretty cool as well, including not only the Mach 5, but also Racer X's Shooting Star, the GRX, and the three-wheeled cars driven by the ""Gang of Assassins."" There's also moments of sappy, stupid, silliness as well. My least favorite episodes would have to include ""The Car Hater,"" ""Crash in the Jungle,"" and ""Car With a Brain.""

Extras on this set are a little disappointing.  While the show's complete one season of 52 shows is on the disks, they really could have used some color restoration and remastering to improve the quality. On some of the disks, there's icons which let you access a short piece on the show's villain, a car in the episode, and a lighter comic moment featuring Speed's brother, Spridle, and his chimp, Chim-Chim. These are basically repackaged synopsis of part of the episode. The ""extras"" disk has a short featurette on the history of the show, another on the making of 1993's short-lived ""The New Adventures of Speed Racer,"" and an episode of that show, which didn't do much for me.

While theWachowski Brothers' way-over-the-top  2008 film of this property isn't great, there's no doubt the writer-directors are major fans of the animated original and tried to cram in as many elements from the show as they possibly could. There's been at least three other attempts over the years to revamp Speed Racer on television, comics, and online, but none of them have the appeal of the original on disk here.",1381449600,,5028,5.008383233532935

8357443,3,B00294MMU6,"As is probably true of most Baby Boomers, my sole youthful experience of Japanese-style anime was confined to 1960s TV showings of Astro Boy and Speed Racer.  I have to say that I think I prefer the first, even though I haven't seen it (in its original form) in 45-odd years.  I don't really know why; I thought I had fond memories of this series, but watching it over I find that it seems to be missing somethingeven the live-action version, which has been generally panned by critics, seems more satisfactory.

18-year-old Speed Racer is perhaps the youngest professional racing driver around, though he probably comes by his talent naturally: his father, Pops Racer, is a designer of race cars known for his imagination and technical skill, and his older brother Rex, like himself, started racing in his teens, only to quarrel violently with Pops (who thought he should take a few years to get more experience under his belt) and run away from home.  Pops built Speeds car, the marvelous Mach 5, which has a top speed of 300 MPH and more hidden surprises than James Bonds Aston Martin.  Speed racesboth track and cross-countryon six continents (once seven, even crossing part of Antarctica), usually backed up by two or more of his team: Pops; food-loving younger brother Spreidel (who also happens to be an excellent marksman with a slingshot when called upon) and Spreidels pet chimpanzee Chim-Chim, who have a habit of stowing away, usually in the Mach 5s trunk, when they think they might miss something by staying behind; girlfriend Trixie, whos both a skilled pilot (chopper and fixed-wing) and a pretty fair country driver, though rather proprietary about Speed; and teenage mechanic Sparky.  Along the way he tangles not only with fellow racers wholl resort to some pretty low-down tricks to win, but with criminals of assorted stripe, would-be assassins and revolutionaries, mad scientists, international spies, and other bad guys.  His occasional rival and guardian angel is the mysterious Masked Racer, also known as Racer X, who, unknown to Speed, is in fact his brother Rex.

The series has been described as one of the more violent ever to appear on American TV, and its true that there are a good many fights (Speed is almost as good with his fists and at the martial arts as he is behind the wheel, and he can use an assault weapon (they weren't called that in the 60s) too), spin-outs, collisions, explosions, and fiery crashes; but its cartoon violence, like that of Wile E. Coyote and the Roadrunnerwe never see any graphic death or injury.  What makes it difficult for me to like is the careless scripting, which results in assorted inconsistencies and more than a few improbable plot twists.  And Speed, who tends to be fixated on winning (though he always competes honorably), isn't always a sympathetic character.  Also, I found the process of navigating from one episode to another difficult to master.  Still, for all its crudities, this is definitely a prime example of early anime, and if you want to see how the genre began, you should probably have it on your shelf.",1436140800,,3098,4.857685009487666

And loved it from day one.

In retrospect the fact that three or four people did all of the voice work, and the same team wrote the translations, says much about the people who put their hearts and souls into bring this series to U.S. T.V.",1412553600,,375,3.9342105263157894

The case, bareilly passing for The Mach 5, arrived shrink-wrapped yet somehow had a couple of small scratches on it. The booklet that holds the DVDs had a deep cut on the binding, perhaps from being forced into the case in the wrong direction. Thankfully none of the DVDs were damaged so the content was excellent and happy childhood memories continued.

8357451,5,B00294MMU6,I love this complete set of DVD's of the original Speed Racer cartoon series. The DVD's cartoons are of good quality and the colors are bright and clear. This set contains all the cartoons (52 in the series) and a DVD of bonus features which includes the history of the Speed Racer with Peter Fernandez (the voice of Speed Racer & Racer X) who has since passed away. A really great feature is the tin case of the Mach 5 that stores the complete DVD collection and episode guide. The tin case gets comments sitting on my DVD shelf. The complete set arrived quickly and in great shape. I would buy from this seller again. Thanks!,1405296000,,627,4.413793103448276
