Good warmups have been hard to come by so this is a great boon both for warming up the hand and moving more efficiently while improving my technique.,1303257600,4,264,4.3
8434501,5,B004LMFGV6,"Another Homespun release in which a gifted teacher presents material that is immediately useful, coupled with videography second to none.

Andrew DuBrock is a gifted teacher and this DVD is  Late Beginner, Early Intermediate and Intermediate guitarists.

At the Intermediate level, I am looking to break through a plateau that has frustrated me for some time.

Because I work solely from DVD lessons, I keep a journal of my progress, including details such as songs struggled over, metronome timing, etc.  I needed structure and this DVD is perfect for that needed assistance.

The DVD breaks down nicely with exercises which should be incorporated into daily practice, helping the student gain more from the time he has for practice.  The basic theory is this very point: we may not have more time to practice, so we need to make the most of our practice time.  It is important to me.

Particularly of interest to me is the 10 week schedule which, along with my own learning journal, will help me measure my progress.  Currently, I have found that I am now able to increase the finger exercises tempo with the metronome with only a few weeks of implementation.

This is the perfect DVD for me to bear down, focus, and break through the plateau I have been struggling with.

DVD lessons can be 'upfront and personal' as the student will likely spend many hours 'with' the instructor (especially considering the use of the pause button) and the persona of the instructor is important.

Dubrock comes across as a serious instructor, warmly enthusiastic, but professional.  The DVD is the perfect follow up from his book on Practice (which is something beginners and late beginners will benefit from ).

I look forward to more releases from the author.",1299283200,10,1749,4.88135593220339
