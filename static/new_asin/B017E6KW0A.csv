7504517,5,B017E6KW0A,"Adventure Time Season 7 has been great so far, and this mini-series does not disappoint. With the backstory of Marceline and others not explored in this mini-series, this show just gets deeper and deeper. I have seen the entirety of Stakes, and although I have not purchased these episodes as of yet, I plan to in the future. I wish that they would release a Blu-ray version of this. That's what I really want to buy, but maybe they'll include this in the season 7 Blu-ray set when that's released.",1453334400,,498,4.544444444444444

It was very in depth with the story line, lots of interesting adventure time information, great look into both PB and Marceline's past, and having TONS of awesome adventure sequences.

7504526,5,B017E6KW0A,"""Stakes"", as many others have said, plays like a full-length ""Adventure Time"" movie starring Marceline the Vampire Queen. Ever since the very first season of the show, Marceline has been my absolute favorite character, so when we were told by the Powers that Be in the Spring of 2015 that there was going to be a Marceline-centric miniseries, I was extremely excited. I'm happy to say that the miniseries did not disappoint.

If you're wanting a play-by-play of the plot, I'd recommend you check out the Wikipedia article on this series, but the main story concerns Marceline and her pals as they try to stake newly resurrected vampires. The miniseries fills in details about Marceline's past that we have all wanted to know (e.g. how she got her powers, how she became the Vampire Queen, her mother), and also provides a nice springboard for future stories.

Thematically, the miniseries is just as deep as many of the best AT episodes, and the 8 episodes largely revolve around the concept of the ""eternal return"", or the philosophical notion that everything that happens is destined to repeat over and over again. This is some pretty heady stuff (I mean, this is a concept that Nietzsche wrote about), so it's wonderful to see a children's show approach it in a fun(ny) and accessible way. Other themes that are explored include: the benefits of mortality v. the benefits of immortality, death, the strength of love/friendship, the nature of Fate/Destiny, and the power that individuals may hold within themselves. There's also some great fart jokes.

The pice de rsistance of the miniseries, however, is the new song ""Everything Stays"" written by former storyboard artist Rebecca Sugar. It's a wonderful little lullaby that plays during several beautifully blocked scenes. Perhaps Ms. Sugar can return to the show in the future for one or two more songs? Here's to hoping!",1473120000,,1876,4.987220447284345

7504529,5,B017E6KW0A,This is an excellent miniseries.  It reminds me why I love Adventure Time.  They should release more DVDs of this than the random 'mix tape' of episodes!,1464652800,,153,4.62962962962963

7504536,5,B017E6KW0A,"This is essentially a very good full length Adventure Time movie, interrupted by opening and closing credits every 11 minutes or so.  As a longtime fan, it is hard to be certain, but I'm pretty sure this is would be very enjoyable on it's own terms to someone who has never seen the show.  Adequate context is given within the miniseries to understand the plot and the relationships between the characters.  You just may miss a few jokes and references.  In fact, this fills in some long-missing pieces of the Marceline back-story.  The return of Rebecca Sugar, former storyboard artist and songwriter for the show, to write a beautiful little song ""Everything Stays"" is a huge bonus.

Additional features I would like to have seen:
1. The ""play all"" selection should have played the opening theme only once at the beginning, and omitted the individual end-credit sequences for a composite end credit sequence at the end (This is common practice with Nickelodeon DVDs).
2. An extended cut, as the editing was noticeably tight just to fit all this story into 8 11-minute segments.  I'm not sure if there is any fully produced additional footage from which to do this, but if there is, it would be great.
3. Professionally shot video of Rebecca Sugar and Olivia Olson singing ""Everything Stays"" at Comicon (or anywhere, but the Comicon footage exists for sure).
4. A Blu Ray release.

In short, so good, it left me wanting more.  A definite step up from the increasingly variable quality of episodes in this and the previous season.  I look forward to the full season Blu Ray release which I can only hope might have some of the added features of which I dream.  And to think, creator Pen Ward is off working on his own actual Adventure Time feature film.  I can't wait to see that.",1460246400,7,1780,4.688102893890675
