846713,3,6304307624,"Predictable, slow film about a young man who waits for Cupid (Hmm!) to bring him true love, in the meantime a psycho is on the run and murders all the women who don't make the grade. Zach Galligan plays the obsessed with the myth of Cupid character, Mary Crosy plays his mentally disturbed sister & poor Ashley Laurence is the vulnerable girl who gets caught in this jumble of confusion...
Disturbing, perverse at times but plays mostly as a T.V mystery series.",1033430400,2,461,4.634146341463414
846714,5,6304307624,"If you are looking for a scary movie this movie is the one to get. I have been a fan of Zach every since he started in movies. This movie is about a guy who is obsessed with cupid. To the point that he thinks he is cupid. He  is out to look for his pices or ""his goddess of love."" He finds  the perfect girl knowing that she is the one. He starts to kill everyone  she knows off so that he and she will be happy forever. But she gets smart  and she rejects him, and deadly measures start to happen. If you like great  suspense and horror you'll love this movie. I give this movie two thumbs  UP!",960508800,5,595,3.87603305785124
847065,1,6304307624,It is a ridiculous movie with two uncharismatic leads. Don't waste spending an hour hoping the movie will get better. It won't.,1465776000,,127,4.818181818181818

847068,1,6304307624,This is the worst movie I have ever seen its painful to watch. Don't waste your time!,1461024000,,85,4.0588235294117645
847069,3,6304307624,The movie starts off a little slow but you can still get into it after 15 minutes. It is not a bad movie it is actually really good. It's not the best movie on the market but it captures your attention. I cannot give the movie more than 3 stars because there was nothing memorable or deep about the movie. But I will say that you will not be disappointed for watching it. And it is a good suspenseful drama movie to watch. It's not a bad movie but it is not the best but you will not be disappointed by watching this movie.,1459382400,,523,4.038461538461538

847071,3,6304307624,"Watched this movie many years ago! Enjoyed seeing familiar faces of Ashley Laurance and Zach Galilgan. The plot is strange and shallow. Many familiar faces pop up in the movie. Watch the movie do it for the love of Gremlins and Waxwork 2, do it for Hellrasier and whatever else other movies Ashley's known for. Keep on the sunny side of life.",1457222400,,342,4.532258064516129

847195,1,6304307624,"When I purchased this item the company said ""BRAND NEW"" TOTAL LIE.  What I get is a 'previously viewed 4.99'.  Um last time I looked just cause the tape is sealed up doesn't mean its 'brand new' especially with a sticker like that right on the box.  So the 1 star is for the company who sold it, not the story.

I loved the story it was unique and original, to those whom said it was predictable, um what movie were you watching?",1398729600,,429,4.132530120481928
847196,4,6304307624,"I really enjoyed this modern take on the slasher genre.  Incorporating the story of Cupid was a really fresh idea and it's always fun to see Ashley Laurence in a horror film.  Don't get me wrong, I like Zach Galligan as well, however Ashley Laurence is such a powerhouse that Galligan's wooden like, stilted acting becomes even more obvious and off-putting here.  I still really liked the film, though, and I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for something a little different.",1357689600,,484,4.878048780487805
7868335,3,6304307624,"This is not a romantic story. Do not expect the woman to find true love. The main guy is a psychopath who thinks he's the living incarnation of the god of love, and decides to kill anyone who messes with his delusions. While not the best story,(major understatement) if you watch with the full intent making fun of the characters, you might like it. I had a really good time laughing at the guy who, after just being told the guy dating his ex was in a mental institution, decides to threaten said guy. You can easily guess what happens.",1497484800,,537,4.38
