4494109,5,B004XC5LR8,"My 3 year old attends Montessori and was a little behind in her basics, especially counting.  Granted, they work with her every day on her numbers, letters, shapes and colors but she LOVES this set.  She went from barely being able to count to 5 or 6 to counting to 12 perfectly!  Even her teacher is amazed!  We're still perfecting the others but all are addressed on this 3-DVD set by Sesame Street characters.  They even use old clips of the show from the 70s!  Hey - it worked for me!  :)  This is a great set to get your toddlers started or help them master the basics.",1401408000,35,574,4.25

4494130,1,B004XC5LR8,"Kids weren't engaged. They weren't learning anything new but watching mini shows but I was expecting more in-depth of the alaphbet, numbers and shapes and colors. The first dvd was a show about asking about A and Z in a mall barely covered the other 24 letters in the alaphbet. The numbers and shapes dvd was basic, didn't have a lot of information show to teach the numbers and shapes so if the kids watching didn't know them already teach them before watching so they can understand.",1508630400,,485,4.586206896551724

The alphabet movie is kinda lame (2 stars), with A and Z running around a mall interviewing people, the short segments for the letters are better.
