As is typical of Echo Bridge, over 7 hours of video has been crammed onto a single DVD9 disc. I own several EBHE releases, I fully expected this. Having previewed the titles, quality is decent. Not as good had they been authored onto two separate DVD9 discs, but for a budget release, it's ok. The compression would be a wee bit less of an issue if EBHE would stop insisting on interlaced transfers when it's possible to have progressive ones. While it's possible more often than they do on these collections, it's not always possible, but considering EBHE themselves have released progressive transfers of the Halloween films, no clue why they're interlaced on here. When progressive transfers are used, there are 6 fewer frames per second, therefore each frame can have slightly more room to breathe, plus progressive frames just look better when compressed. Even then, these DVD's will never be super amazing quality, but in motion, you don't always notice the artifacting quite as much. If any of the stuff you stream off the internet is SD quality, it won't look much better and will likely be just as compressed. Each film seems to have generic chapter stops at every 10 minute mark, no subtitles, and DD 2.0 audio.

While some of these collections use the full-screen overly dark Beta-sourced version of Prom Night, this version uses the lightened up widescreen PAL-to-NTSC version from their standalone widescreen DVD reissue. Hello Mary Lou is the only film on here not in widescreen and is likely mastered from a videotape master. A bonus surprise is that this collection includes Halloween H20 and Halloween Resurrection in their proper theatrical aspect ratios of 2.35:1. The standalone releases, Blu-Ray versions, and other assorted versions use an open matte for H20, and I'm not entirely sure whether Resurrection's 16:9 transfer was open matte or pan-and-scan. The Curse Of Michael Myers is 16:9 and I'm not entirely sure if that's the original theatrical aspect ratio or not. All widescreen films are anamorphically enhanced for 16:9 TV sets.

This isn't a bad set for the money, if you don't pay high prices like Amazon is charging. I found this for $4.95 at Dollar General, and you might find this in the $5 bin at WalMart or any local ""dollar"" or grocery store that carries EBHE titles. If this were a more premium set, with the Prom Night films on one DVD9 and the Halloween movies on another DVD9, had subtitles, scene-specific chapter stops, or what have you, $14.98 would be a good price, but for what it is, $5-$7 is about all one should pay for this. The beauty of these sets is, if you pay the right price and only like one or two films, it's still worth the money.",1394323200,,2841,4.770325203252033
