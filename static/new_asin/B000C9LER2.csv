8096494,2,B000C9LER2,"I guess the Quebecois are a few decades behind on the portrayal of minorities. This otherwise charming video has Annie Brocoli in Chineee makeup going ""Ching-chong, bing bong"" and then dressed up as a lazy Mexican scientist, snoring away and having to be awoken to talk in a drawl, and finally, in blackface as an African with bones in her hair going, ""Ooga booga, ooga booga."" Incroyable.",1224028800,,389,4.82089552238806
8096495,4,B000C9LER2,"The animation and costumes in this DVD are not quite as awesome as Au Fonds de Marins, but the video is cute and the songs are catchy.  I do agree that they stereotype Chinese and Mexican, etc. in one of the scenes... but it is done with a kind hearted intentions- and Annie dresses in greenface when playing a frog... i mean, i don't want to brush it off lightly since racism is a big issue, but i don't know how bad it really is...
anyway- Annie- please make more.",1125187200,,466,4.177777777777778
8096496,5,B000C9LER2,"this is a great video.  one of annie's best.  my children love it and the songs are very catchy.  disregard the other rater's raiting as there really isn't any racism, maybe some cliche representations but clearly not racism.  us canadians are too worried about peace and harmoney to find this video offensive...  maybe the last rater should go protest the current war going on.  it would be much more beneficial to the rest of the world.  overall this is a great video and for native english speakers, the quebecois french isn't as fast as other videos i've seen.  another hit for annie!",1119657600,,588,4.696078431372549
8096497,4,B000C9LER2,"The fans of Annie Brocoli won't be disappointed. It's full of imagination and most of the songs are attractive for kids under 10. Annie caricatures a lot of people, from the door-to-door seller to the policeman; it's to be taken as jokes, not racism.",1100390400,,250,4.704545454545454
8096498,1,B000C9LER2,"My 2-year-old loves this video. But I have to watch it with her to make sure I fast forward through the unbelievably racist sections. While in space, Annie contacts three ""experts"" on earth: a Chinese woman, an African woman, and a Mexican man.
The Chinese woman slams chopsticks together, saying nonsensical ""chinese"": ""ching chong bing bong,"" etc. The African woman has bones in her hair, and is going ""ooga booga"" to the thumping of drums; and the Mexican in a giant sombrero is deep in the middle of siesta and has to be awoken by Annie, whereupon he talks reee-lee slow-ly in his Me-hi-ca-no accent.
To make things worse, of course, is the fact that all these characters are blonde, blue-eyed Annie in fancy dress!!! She is in blackface to play the African.
It's UNBELIEVABLE that no one has protested this!!!
Are sensibilities in Canada so very different?
I would have given it more stars, but the revulsion I feel at the racism forces me to only give it one star.",1085011200,,970,4.678362573099415
