1733621,5,B000069HYZ,"As a long time member of the American Association for Nude Recreation [...] I purchased this video to see what has changed in the nudist community over the years.  I found the video funny, whimsical and proof that nudists can now enjoy nude recreation without the mystery that nudists in the past endured.  This is a great video for a group of nudists who can remember the days when nudists were still in the closet.",1243814400,,416,4.533333333333333
1733622,4,B000069HYZ,"As I understand it, in years past the only way to show graphic nudity on movie screens was to depict non-sexual nudity, and that ultimately meant... movies about nudist camps!  So there was this whole rash of movies (especially in the 60's) that featured mainstream mystery stories, horror stories, dramas, etc., but with one big difference from regular theater fare: the movies were set in nudist resorts.  Talk about a weird, weird sub-genre of movies, a sub-genre nicely sampled on this DVD.

""Diary of a Nudist"" is, the ridiculous story and low-budget production values notwithstanding, probably not a completely inaccurate look at what life in a 1960's nudist camp was like.  I would just add that in real life there would likely be a wider diversity of bodies than the perfect specimens on hand here.  So sit back, relax, and-- once you get past the endless scene of happy nudists arriving at the club and letting themselves in the gate-- enjoy a silly little drama (and ultimately romance story) set in the sunshine and peace of a 60's-era Florida nudist resort.

""The Naked Venus"" is more of an outright hoot.  Filmed in crisp black and white, this is essentially a courtroom drama with a little bit of nudism thrown in for good measure.  Two things really stand out.  First, the movie revolves around a custody battle for a little kid.  So what does the woman who wants custody of her kid do once she runs off with the little tyke?  She immediately takes refuge in a nudist camp.  Now, there quite possibly may be nothing wrong with nudism, but would a nudist resort be the FIRST PLACE you'd go when the other side is looking for ANY LITTLE THING to put forth as a red flag and cause for concern about a person's fitness to be a mother?  Heck, just wait 'til you after win the case before you take your kid to the nudist camp!  Sheesh.  Secondly, the judge and lawyers in the case constantly confuse the meanings of the words ""overruled"" and ""sustained"".  It's a riot.

This fun, generous DVD is rounded out with a nice variety of nudist ""short subjects"" from the silent era to the 60's.  I saw a recurring theme: while most of the short subjects emphasized the wholesome aspects of nudism, several of them (as well as the two main features, too) tried to sneak in a little light prurience here and there.  I guess that's fair.  Because while nudism purportedly isn't about overt sex, if you're a person who enjoys looking at attractive people at a regular beach or resort, you're going to enjoy looking at attractive people at a nudist beach or resort.  You just wouldn't be impolite and ogle.

If you like this DVD, check out Something Weird's double-feature DVD of ""The Beast That Killed Women"" and ""The Monster of Camp Sunshine"".  After all, you haven't lived 'til you've seen that pinnacle of western civilization known as the nudist horror movie.",1162166400,7,2861,4.678
1733623,4,B000069HYZ,"Two very different types of nudist films, both excellent in their own way.  Doris Wishman's Diary of a Nudist has many of the features of a great campy movie- delightfully bad acting, pleasingly ugly set pieces, hilarious dialogue.  And if you're into just sitting back and watching a bunch of pretty girls (and none is prettier than the star of the film, a reporter who is sent to a nudist camp to ""expose"" the camp in her paper, but who becomes a nudie camp believer)  running around naked, there's that, too.  Naked Venus, although also somewhat campy, is more of a ""serious"" film, complete with dramatic courtroom scenes, wherein an uptight socialite American mother tries to get custody of her granndaughter from her French daughter-in-law, who is a nude model.  Because this package was put together by Something Weird, there's a whole boatload of delightful extras - trailers, short film, extra footage from the main features - all with a nudist camp theme.",1151193600,2,964,4.889570552147239
1733624,2,B000069HYZ,"This Double feature may be a cloyingly ""sanitized"" presentation, yet, it bespeaks a gentleness and wholesomeness that is sadly absent in this day and age.  The attempts back in the 1960s to exercise as much caution as possible in the portrayal of the human form, undoubtedly was on account of prevalent censorship laws, and therefore renders the unnatural contorting of the body somewhat quaint if not ungainly.  However, one must look beyond that little annoyance and appreciate the genuine and sincere attempt to portray the joys of naturism in the most dignified and elegant way.  These directors have striven to break free of the prevailing stigma and deal with the subject as boldly as possible, avoiding sensationalism, but attempting to bring nudity and naturism to the public domain devoid of any false mystique or lascivious excess.  This also applies in the case of about an hour of short clips, trailers and other delectable short subjects that have been selected from the decade of the 1950s and `60s.  One could not help but feel that there was an ever so slight tendency, especially in ""Beatlettes Go Nudist"", to be a tad exploitative of the ladies.  In addition to the now politically incorrect male chauvinism that is almost palpable in the piece, there is some unnecessary double-entendre in the maudlin commentary!  Even then, one must appreciate the tender care exercised in keeping it free from the pornographic crudeness that one too often encounters presently.  This is a good albeit imperfect example of the historic approach to fostering a respect for the unadorned human form. But, it would have been far more real if the men were equal partners with the women in the portrayal.  The very few images of masculine grace certainly left one inspired to spend many more hours in the gymnasium to appear as they did!!",1064361600,13,1837,4.977124183006536
1733625,5,B000069HYZ,"I agree with the two previous reviews.
I would add that both films has a couple of very pretty ladies. One short scene in Diary of a couple of girls sqealing under a cold hose is wonderful, and more sexy than 98% of anything the adult industry has turned out.
Also, some of the extras, ""info"" films about nudism from the fifties, are just hilarious. Quite amazing.",1059436800,14,364,4.447761194029851
1733626,4,B000069HYZ,"This disc is packed with stuff! There are the two movies with their very coy nudity (watch as the ladies artfully stand with their legs covering the 'rude' bits or with towels/papers/hats draped over their midsection. The picture is a good restoration of some poor quality (old poorly preserved) originals, but it is still very watchable. The movies themselves are not spectacular in their plot but still fun and interesting.
The extra's (of which there is over an hour) are the piece de resistance. You get trailers from 6 nudism related movies, extra footage from The Naked Venus, four shorts on nudity, a heap of poster art/production stills from various nudity related movies (with radio discussions over the top) and an easter egg of a nudist wedding.
About half of the extra's are in black and white (as is The Naked Venus). Some have been restored to very good quality but one or two are almost unwatchable. There is virtually no full frontal nudity, but lots of breasts and bottoms.
Everything is from the 50's and 60's and looks it (even naked, you can tell the era from the hair/makeup (sometimes this is caked on) and the cars). If you're interested in the history of nudity or nudity in films then this is highly recommended.",1034553600,37,1237,4.758139534883721

7965737,5,B000069HYZ,"I bought this DVD primarily for Diary of a Nudist, and while my review focuses on this, my comments could easily apply to much of the other material as well. I gave this a 5-star rating based on its sheer campiness. The plot has been discussed in other reviews, and I will add nothing to what has been written.

IMO, nothing epitomizes the quasi-nudist sexploitation films of this era better then Diary. Like the nudist magazines of the same era (Sunshine and Health the best example), Diary purported to display the realities of the nudist lifestyle---whereas in reality it did little more than cater to male fantasies. Diary would have the viewer believe that virtually all nudists are under the age of 35, with about 75-80% of them female---which of course is what viewers would have liked to believe.

Accordingly, the viewer was treated to the sight of many young women cavorting completely nude, including reporter Stacey Taylor (played by Davee Decker). However, when editor Arthur Sherwood (played by Norman Casserly) joined Sunny Palms Lodge nudist park, he remained dressed in blue briefs. I suspect that his never baring all (not even once) had nothing to do with the actors abashment, but was due instead to the directors belief that the last thing viewers of this movie wanted to see was a hairy male tush.

Likewise Zelda Suplee, the owner of Sunny Palms, is never shown in the buff, despite the fact that the late Ms. Suplee was a real nudist (and was in fact the owner of Sunny Palms, which was a real place). However, though female of course, Ms. Suplee was 53 at the time and possessed a matronly figure, hardly the fare for the typical male viewer. (Ms. Suplee appeared as a nudist park owner on the TV show Whats My Line? in 1953, though under an assumed name.)

In an era where pornography was illegal and nudity was never shown in mainstream movies, movies and magazines such as this provided men the opportunity to see scores of women gamboling about naked and unashamed, all under the guise of promoting the nudist lifestyle.",1487289600,,2049,4.747191011235955
