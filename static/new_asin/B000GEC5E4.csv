8130921,4,B000GEC5E4,This is a criminally underrated western when it came out in it's day and probaly deserved a wider audience. The only other western to entertain me was Tarantino's DJANGO UNCHAINED. These two westerns are more pulp fiction stories set against wide open landscapes. MISSING has close similarities to John Ford's THE SEARCHERS as CATE BLANCHETT and TOMMY LEE JONES go for the search of the young girls abducted by Indians to be sold as sex slaves. At times it's a hard film and is a better film for it's convictions. The cinematography of the outback has to be seen on a widescreen as there are references to past westerns. Ron Howard does a brilliant job in pacing the film and getting the visual compositions one expects with this type of film. There a supernatural elements to the story that could have been cheesy but are well handled. On the extra features we get to see Ron Howards Western short films that are essential in seeing how his sensibilities were formed when it came to making MISSING.,1363392000,,999,4.681818181818182
8130922,5,B000GEC5E4,Just what I ordered.  Movie is great!  Love Tommy Lee Jones. The plot is exciting.  I love westerns and this one was just the ticket.,1354838400,,133,4.24
8130923,5,B000GEC5E4,This is a highly underated film.  The suspense is spell bounding.  I paid alot more for this film than it than it is being offered by third sellers.  The acting is terricic -- you'll love it if appreciate tendernes combined with action.  I don't think Ron Howard has ever directed a movie that he can't be proud of -- this MISSING is no acception!,1186617600,2,347,4.375
