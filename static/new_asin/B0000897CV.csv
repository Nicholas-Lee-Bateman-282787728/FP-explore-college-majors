I think the quality is excellent and well preserved for movies made over a half century ago. I found it arrogant and presumptuous for the previous reviewer to give such a negative rating on a collection she admittedly has not seen and has no knowledge of. I am surprised Amazon accepted the review from the 500 lb model. These are definitely not dollar store bargains. If someone wishes to be influenced by the previous review, I suggest they read customer comments on each individual movie and note the selling price. If you are a classic movie fan who appreciates quality and film preservation, this set is well worth the price.",1241913600,5,749,4.639097744360902
8570674,1,B0000897CV,"SORRY, but these are the tired old films you can buy for One dollar each at your discount store! I have not seen this box set production, so I can't comment on how clear these transfers might be, but all the films themselves I have seen on DVD, and you can buy them individually for a buck each if you are desperate to see them. But NONE  of these were very good to start with. I LOVE Classic films, but these are the crummy films that you view once and never want to see again. Even though they have big names, these are boring films, these are the dregs that are no longer under copywrite. Dont be fooled by the high price, if you want to see these films they are probably all in a DVD collection that costs about $15 for fifty classic films with so-so transfers because these movies have long  been in public domain.",1183939200,15,819,4.210191082802548
