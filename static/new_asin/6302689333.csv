BIOS:
1.  Ken Curtis (aka: Curtis Wain Gates)
Date of birth:  2 July 1916 - Lamar, Colorado
Date of death:  29 April 1991 - Fresno, California

Special Footnote, Ken Curtis an American actor began his show business career as a singer in the big-band era, and was a vocalist in the legendary Tommy Dorsey orchestra ... entered films in the late 1940s at the tail end of the singing cowboy period in a series of low-budget westerns for Columbia Pictures ... the genre died out he turned to straight dramatic and comedy parts, and became a regular in the films of director John Ford (who was his father-in-law) ... Curtis is best known for his long-running role as Festus Hagen, the scrofulous, cantankerous deputy in the long-running TV series ""Gunsmoke"" (1955) --- Inducted (as a cast member of ""Gunsmoke"" (1955)) into the Hall of Great Western Performers of the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum in 1981.

BIOS:
2. Roy Barcroft (aka: Howard Harold Ravenscroft)
Date of birth: 7 September 1902 - Crab Orchard, Nebraska
Date of death: 28 November 1969 - Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California

Second Special Footnote, actor Roy Barcroft one of the most sought after badmen of the Saturday Matinee era --- His face appeared in more westerns than any cowboy villain who rode the range in the '40s and '50s --- an complete account of ""Roy Barcroft:King of the Badmen"", which is the title of Bobby J. Copeland's book on the life and times of ""Republic Pictures Number One Villain"". Barcroft appeared in B-Westerns and Serials - became one of the most recognized actors, when you heard that familiar voice --- you were in for it. Roy was one of the few bad guys that once you saw his name in the credits, you were going to get your money's worth. Barcroft was my first favorite and my second was Harry Woods, who in many ways reminded me of each other --- I remember watching Barcroft in a variety of Republic Serials --- ""Manhunt of Mystery Island"" (1945), as Captain Mephisto --- ""The Purple Monster Strikes"" (1945), as the invading Martian --- ""G-Men Never Forget"" (1948), a dual role as the honest police commissioner and the lead villain (good & bad look-alikes) --- ""Don Daredevil Rides Again"" (1951) --- ""Radar Men from the Moon"" (1952), as Retik --- My favorite B-Westerns were the casting of Wild ""Bill"" Elliott and Allan ""Rocky"" Lane vs the under handed dealings of Roy Barcroft, boss, leader of the gang or henchmen --- every frame was B-Westerns at their best --- With knock-down-drag-out fight scenes that gave you everything you ever wished for and more in an action film --- fellow actors, producers and directors all agree Roy Barcroft was as beloved as anybody else in the Motion Picture business.
