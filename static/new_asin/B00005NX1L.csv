1637792,5,B00005NX1L,"There are 2 words that come to my almost speechless mouth when I think of this particular series- ""sheer perfection""! After unfortunately seeing Tenchi in Tokyo, this has proved to be a real pick-me-up. The Tenchi Universe is one of the best anime series availible, I'd go as far to call it a pure classic. For those of you that don't know the plot, it follows a completely different storyline to the ""Tenchi OVA"" or the ""Tenchi in Tokyo"" series. I won't spoil the plot too much, but needless to say that Tenchi finds himself surrounded by female company from the very beginning. Just watch out for the flash-back ending to the series, it's one of the best endings you could wish for.
The good -
Tenchi Masaki: Well, ""Tenchi Muyo!"" roughly translates into English as ""no need for Tenchi!"" so say hello to the lead character. Just an ordinary high school teenager, until one day Ryoko appears...
Ryoko (Spelt Ryouko, sometimes): Most anime fans will agree that Ryoko is the best character in the series and certainly the most detailed when it comes to her personality. This is seen near to the end especially.
Ayeka (Spelt Aeka, sometimes): Second most prominent character after Tenchi in most people's opinions. She's still the princess of planet Jurai, like in the OVA series, but this time she's quite ruthless and not so ""fragile"" (see episode 2, the space battle sequence).
The bad -
Kagato: one of the most incredible villains of all time, if you ask me. He was first featured in the OVA and now this ""multi-purpose bad guy"" is back for the Tenchi Universe. Both cunning and extremely powerful, this is one villain you won't forget.
That about concludes today's lesson, all that is left to say is that if you don't get this you'll probably regret it. DEFINETELY well worth saving up for! :)

Humorous from the start, you never know whats next where Tenchi Muyo is involved.  You don't need much here, just watch one episode and you will see that it is a keeper.

1637794,5,B00005NX1L,"Want to treasure Tenchi Universe? This is the boxed set for you. Tenchi Universe definitely does not disappoint those fans of Tenchi Muyo! OAV. The storyline is the same, just switched around a bit at the beginning. The best episodes include ""No Need for Genius,"" where Washu creates a mecha Washu with the personality of Mihoshi. Go figure. The greatest episodes include ""Adventures in Time and Space."" Each girl lives out her fantasy world with Washu's new invention. When the invention starts backfiring, the whole household is sucked into different worlds. Of course, Washu is trying to fix it as soon as she can. Aeka's world: Feudal Japan, where Tenchi is her fiance off to fight the demon, Ryoko. Kiyone's world: A small town rid of Mihoshi, or so she thought. Sasami's world: High school with Tenchi, Ryoko, and Aeka as students. Mihoshi and Kiyone are teachers. Sasami is Magical Girl Pretty Sammy. Mihoshi's world: A modern domestic family with Tenchi as her husband and Sasami her daughter. Aeka is the cranky aunt and Ryoko is the pesky neighbor. Ryoko's world: She's a bank robber in the US and Tenchi is her reluctant assistant. Aeka is the millionare trying to get Tenchi back and Kiyone and Mihoshi are two police officers.

1637795,5,B00005NX1L,"Well, this is a great thing, finally, the Tenchi Univers series on a DVD Box set, like the Tenchi Muyo Ova series. Now that it is in a box set, I can get the whole Univers series fast and easy, and for the price, its a steal to get the box sets than to get every individual EP's.  The color, sound, and every thing is all there and done very well, also because it is left in its original form, like it should be.  The way the DVD's are set up are also really cool, very easy to get to see what you whant to see, like the OVA series box set, thats what is really what I like, also, that you can watch all the series and not have to change the DVD every 3 EP's, but just kick back and enjoy.  If you are a Tenchi, this is for you, don't wait, get it now and enjoy.",997747200,,762,3.779874213836478
1637796,5,B00005NX1L,I never heard of this show till one day i was fliping threw channels. I also saw sailor moon for the first time to it was awaesom.... Im in the 11th grade and i still watch cartoons. This sereis is so funny. Its about 2girls who fight over some guy. I don't have this DVD but i saw the episode on toonami I have all the sailor moon episodes but not tenchi aww. Anyways this show is really cool.,1064534400,,394,4.0
1637797,5,B00005NX1L,"With the popularity of the original ""Tenchi Muyo"" OAV, it was only natural that Pioneer would want to rack in the cash and create a TV series.  Thus enter ""Tenchi Universe"".  This is a 26-episode series which retells the first 6 episodes of the OAV series.  All of the characters have been modified to a degree from their OAV counter-parts as has the story.  I call it ""Tenchi Light"" because it lacks the subtle depths of the OAV series, however it stands up well on its own.  It is funnier than the OAV series which helps it quite a bit.
As far as the DVD's go, I'm annoyed that Pioneer decided that most of them should only contain three episodes!  This is such an outrage!  There are a few extras on the DVDs, but lets face it, I'd rather have at least 4 (if not 5) episodes per DVD.  But they make more money by spreading it out so far.
Another complaint I have is Pioneer's lack of concern for the English subtitles.  I didn't care for the English dub because I've seen all of the series in Japanese and thus am attached to hearing those voice actors speak.  It is sad that at times the subtitles are unreadable due to their poor font/color choices.  Also, they can't decide if they want to translate the titles of ""-dono"" or ""-sama"" as ""Lord"" or not.  One moment it's ""Lord Tenchi"" and then the next moment its just ""Tenchi"" before they go back to ""Lord Tenchi"".  And Pioneer ignores most Japanese text refusing to translate most of it.  This results at least a couple of jokes being missed because it is obvious we are meant to read the Japanese text.
Bottom line: while not as good as the OAV series, it is good on its own as a funny anime sci-fi title.  The set should have been reduced by at least 1 (if not two) DVD's and the subtitles should have been done better.",1050537600,45,1776,4.307228915662651
1637798,4,B00005NX1L,"Okay, once again the makers of Tenchi said, 'Who needs continuity, we have a better idea'.  So, don't be expecting this one to match up with either other series (OAV or Tenchi in Tokyo).  It starts things anew and goes from their.  In also adds Kiyone into the Tenchi universe (and this hard done by Galaxy detective is probably my second fav character in the series).  Overall the story isn't bad, their just isn't enough of it.  Too many of the episodes are totally disposable from the series and are forgetable, but overall the series is quite good.",1026259200,4,552,4.591836734693878
1637799,4,B00005NX1L,"One of the many things I liked about the OVA was how all the girls were trying to get tenchis attention. In the universe series only Ayeka and Ryoko are definately interested with Sasami only possible interested in any realtionship beyond friends. However the storyline to the universe series is more solid than that of the OVA. The main problem really there are just some episodes in the universe series that I intentionally skip. ""NO NEED FOR A GHOST"" well first off that whole title thing starts to get really annoying and second off this episode simply hap no appeal to me. The ""Time and Space Adventures"" well it is funny but you can skip it and not miss a beat in the storyline really. Then there is Nagi who of corse is better looking than all the girls combined my own personal opinion. Ayeka makes fun of Ryoko during her kareoke scene calling her a 700 year old mummy women. That makes no sense cause that only happens in the OVA not the universe series. Kagato goes from being scientist to well you'll see. I do like how they manage to draw tenchi's mother into the storyline in ""NO NEED FOR MEMORIES"", this was not done in the OVA, told you that title thing gets really annoying huh? All in All it is a good series and I enjoy it more and more each time I watch it.",1025568000,2,1277,4.347280334728033
1637800,4,B00005NX1L,"My first encounter with Tenchi was in the form of the OAV. After Pioneer's incredible transfer with those episodes, I knew it was going to be tough to even come close with a TV series.
And I guess I was right. Tenchi Universe is everything the OAV series was. Funny, touching, action-packed, etc.. but all just
a little step back from the OAV.
The transfer quality isn't as good as the OAV's was, although this isn't all Pioneer's fault, since the animation is a lot less vibrant than the OAV as well. But then this is a TV series.
The audio quality was also a little less, even if it was still good. Well, it's not THX certified so you can't expect a quality like that.
The characters and story are similarily a little less than the OAV. It's not as gloomy/farreaching as that series' plot and more light-hearted in nature. Some characters are also a little less developed (Mihoshi/Washu for instance) and don't get the same level attention as do others.
That said, I still enjoyed this series, because it is more complete (doesn't stop after 13 episodes like the OAV) and it's still Tenchi!
I just wish Pioneer would've gone the extra mile and digitally remastered this series as well and the price tag is a little high, considering there's 3 epidoes per dvd (excepting the first and last dvds, who have 4).",1023667200,8,1309,4.574468085106383
1637801,5,B00005NX1L,I thought this series was just so wonderful. It has everything you need for a great show action/humor/romance. Though the ending was more dramatic it was very well done. I love this series it is one of my favorites. This is one set I will watch over and over. My favorite episode I have to say is either one of the Time and Space and Adventures or No Need for a Conclusion.  The animation is great and the characters are wonderful. If you want to watch an action packed romance-comedy get this series!,1023321600,,501,4.387096774193548
1637802,5,B00005NX1L,"Tenchi Universe is an odd but cool series. It all starts out as a beauty queen named Ryoko is chased to earth buy the Galexy Police. Ryoko meets Tenchi and tells him that a space pirate is after her. Once Ryoko defeats the Galxey Police a first class police person named Mehoshi comes out and says that Ryoko is the space pirate. After having Mehoshi's space craft destroyed she and Ryoko are stuck on Earth. Later in the episodes Aiaka,Sasami,Wahsho,and Keonni come to seen. In this series Aiaka is assrested by planet Jari by Prince Yosho(which is supposed to be died).Sinse Ryoko was with her she was taken under arrest since she was the one who nearly destroyed the planet. That where the whole thing begins. I won't tell you who Yosho is since it will ruin the stroy. This is a great series probably the best Tenchi series too. It's funny,odd,execting and plain different.",1022544000,,877,4.664516129032258
1637803,5,B00005NX1L,"This DVD set features all 8 volumes of Tenchi Universe.  Tenchi fans have mixed opinions on this seris.  Some say its better than Tenchi Muyo!, but I say its pretty much equal because its longer.  The drawing quality has decreased quite a bit from the original series, but once you get into Tenchi Universe you probably won't notice.
  On each DVD there are 3 billingual episodes (has Japanese and English audio).  Each DVD usually goes for about 25$ (which is rediculous if you ask me), but if you buy the set you are basically getting a bargain...so I reccomend doing so.  The extras on each disc offer character sketches, which isn't a lot, but at least its something.
  Overall I really liked this DVD set.  Its not everyday you can just tell your friends that you own an entire 26 episode series.",1021507200,,801,4.577464788732394
7947941,5,B00005NX1L,"Okay, so I've been searching for a decent copy of Tenchi Universe that didn't cost an arm and a leg.  I finally found one, in ""Very Good"" condition.  That was a lie, this thing looked freaking brand new!  I checked every disc, no scratches at all!  Each one worked perfectly and now I am able to enjoy Tenchi whenever I want. It arrived in a very timely manner (4 days) and aside from my wife opening it first I was happy to see it!  Great seller!",1282089600,,447,4.151162790697675
7947942,4,B00005NX1L,"I realize that this is an unpopular opinion, but I actually prefer Tenchi Universe to Tenchi Muyo, the OAV.  Don't get me wrong, the OAV is great in it's own way.  It starts off strong, introducing the girls, and then there is the story arc with Kagato.  Those episodes were great and I enjoyed them a lot...but that's probably where it should have ended.  After that, the story begins to lose focus, reusing a similar plot (Ryoko getting kidnapped again.  Come on, she was hardly even home for a day!) then once that's resolved, the series went on a long hiatus.  The final nail in it's coffin was when it finally came back with new episode.  It was completely diluted by new characters who promptly took over the show.  Poor Ryoko was reduced to a slapstick comic relief character and Ayeka's role was next to nothing.  Instead they dedicate whole episodes to the long-winded backstories of the new characters. There's only seven episodes, so of course the main characters get pushed out of the spotlight.  It's like the writers only ever watched one episode of Tenchi, hated it, and decided to go in a totally different direction.

On the other hand, Tenchi Universe is tightly packaged.  It has a beginning a middle and an end.  It has rising action and falling action.  The characters don't have the same family relationships which is ashame, but the show doesn't really suffer for it.  Whereas with the OAV I often found myself waiting for the episode to end (especially in the Clay episodes, and pretty much all of the 3rd OAV), Tenchi Universe was a joy to watch.  The Time and Space adventure portion of Universe is especially good and shouldn't be missed by any Tenchi fan.  There are many other charming moments too, that had me laughing out loud or going ""aw."" The animation is pretty good - for some reason Universe always gets a bad reputation for it's animation, but I think for it's time, it looks very crisp and some of the scenery is beautiful.  Audio wise, both the English and Japanese dubs are great.

Overall, the main reason I like Universe so much is because it never drags its feet.  It balances romance and sci-fi wonderfully, and keeps the action going.  It focuses on the main characters, and when it does introduce a new character, said new character doesn't take over the show. (Noike, Seto, Sakuya, I'm looking at you!)  It's everything I wish the OAV could have been, but turned out not to be.  The only reason I gave it four stars was because like I said, I liked the family relationships better in the OAV.  Also, Universe can sometimes mess up it's own history (Ayeka calling Ryoko a 700 year old mummy, for example.  She was never a mummy in this series.)  But other than that, I think it's a must see for any Tenchi fan.",1211500800,3,2757,4.586912065439673
7947943,5,B00005NX1L,"I ask this question due to the fact that after you watch this show you'll love one of the girls and hate one of the others.  It's simply a fact.  But I wonder.  Anyway, I've seen all three of the tenchi series and this one is my favorite (I refuse to watch the galaxy police spin off).  Just due to the fact that the characters seem more realistic. As far alien's and such are concerned.  Not to mention that longevity is just kinda dumb.  If you liked any of the others you'll like this series.  It's a lot funnier than the OVA and makes more sense than the Tokyo one.

  The story is exactly what you would expect from an anime comedy.  One guy with a whole bunch of alien chicks chasing after him.  Here is the reason for the question.  You've got six girls to choose from.  Ryoko the party animal with a heart of gold.  Ayeka the well manered princess.  Sasami the cute younger sister of Ayeka.  Mihoshi (I don't know if that's right) the bubbly headed space cadet.  Washu the know it all scientist. Or Kyone (not sure on that one either) the level headed partner of Mihoshi. (She's my personel favorite by the way)

  I do think that putting one show on a crap load of disks is stupid but they have to make money in one way or another.

  I don't speak or read japanese and I don't care to read the subtitles so most shows I've seen (which is a lot) are all english dubbed.  I like the dubbed voices anyway.

  To conclude if your looking for a great romantic comedy with adventure in it this is definitly the show.  And just remeber by the end you will love one of the characters and hate another.

7947944,5,B00005NX1L,"I've seen every series of Tenchi Muyo, and the Tenchi Universe series is by far my most adored and favored of them all. I first watched the series on Toonami when I was much younger, and in my middle school days I watched the more mature versions of each series. Now that I'm older, I'm not a huge anime fan anymore. But I always consider Tenchi Muyo a classic, and I'll never forget the love I had for this series Particularly. I do like the other series too, but Tenchi Universe is, in my opinion, the must-see, espeically if you're a Tenchi+Ryoko fan, if you like an understandable and complete plot, a happy ending, and alot of laughs. I also loved the 2 movies that follow it, and would recommend checking those out too after watching the series: Tenchi Muyo in Love, and Tenchi Muyo in Love II (aka: Tenchi Forever).

I think this series suits anyone whose willing to give it a shot. I wouldn't recommend letting young children view it, unless it's the edited version, but in this case, I'd keep the age range from at least 13 and above.

But please, don't underestimate this wonderful series. The animation isn't as beautiful as the OAV's, but the story has a certain charm about it that cheers yah up, and an unforgettable cast of characters leaves you wanting more!

So if you're in for an awesome adventure, this is your show.

Don't take my word for it, check it out!

Peace,

7947945,3,B00005NX1L,"yes i gave it 3 stars even though its one of the best animes i have ever seen. yet it lacks certain importaint elemts to watch such a nice anime. Like dub that really is ugly just listening to the emotionless actors at times that makes you wonder how is it they did such a good job in the other tenchi series. I have to say i saw tenchi universe before i saw the tenchi Ryo-oki(or what ever its called...). But i seemed to have enjoyed the OVAs much better. It's not that i don't like the story and where it goes. I just couldn't seemed to have focus with the english language on it drove me to the point where half way i changed it to japanese. That has only happend to me a couple of times in other animes. I am not saying this a bad series in anyway. Its the dubbing that really bothered me thru the 26 episodes in general. Futherer more if you haven't seen the tenchi series i wouldn't recomend for you to start with this one or else you might begin to dipise this decent series of which has branched out into some many plots. Overall tenchi universe is a nice series but without the proper dubbing it made it seem almost to corny.

7947946,5,B00005NX1L,"I believe that not enough credit has ever been given to the Tenchi Universe series. While sure the artwork is not as outstanding as the O.V.A, the story line more than makes up for it. Its broken into three sections, the ""on earth"" which follows tenchi and the gangs mishaps on earth. which really has no strict story flow. Then there are the special episodes,and finally the in space saga. This is where it gets really good the story is awsome and the ending...I must say that tenchi universe has the perfect conclusive episode. However even if that did not win you over, the two movies ""tenchi the movie"" and ""tenchi forever"" are to die for and they co-enside with the Tenchi Universe series too and they amazing, but watch Universe first!!! Now beware, if you intend to get the series all at once, make sure its the pioneer box set (vol 1-8) and not the three disk set. When I first saw the entire series, it was with the so called tenchi perfect collection DO NOT BUY THAT!!!!! Its just a chinese pirated version, and the dvd quality is horrible. A way to avoid buying chinese bootlegs is to make sure that for subtitles it does not say chinese subtitles also.

Over all tenchi universes plot is better than the O.V.A (Agggh  hardcore O.V.A fans, don't hurt me!)",1151366400,,1266,4.524017467248909

7947948,3,B00005NX1L,"This won't be too detailed, just to say that I agree with others. It is different than the other Tenchi series in the way that characters are introduced and the basic plot. Dissapointingly, no Tsunami, but meh, thats okay.

It starts out a bit oddly, with some annoying filler episodes, but the plot really picks up after disc 5. The last few episodes really rock the house, and the ending is enjoyable.

The one complaint I have about this is the music. In Japanese, they suit me just fine. But that opening...good god it sounds terrible in English. And you can't skip it, you have to fast forward through it. The background music is enjoyable (since there were no lyrics) but back then the trend was to translate the songs too, which was a mistake in this case. The other thing to grouse about is the price, $180 for a whole 26 episode series. Pioneer has never been good about their pricing (always over priced) but thats fine I suppose, if you can afford it.

Overall, if you liked the Tenchi you saw on TV, you might enjoy this. Hardcore fans of the OVA might want to stay clear because it is so different, but if you don't care about the story differences (like me) you'll like it. Starts out slow, but gets really cool at the end. Beware of some mild language and nudity, nothing too bad. The dub is okay, in this particular case I prefer the subtitled option. Since this is an older gneration anime, you won't see too stellar a performance on the dub end (unlike ADV's dubs, they do an excellent job acting). Its your preference really.",1117411200,6,1544,4.468085106382978

The beginning of the series was different from the OVA series by far because of how ryoko and tenchi meet. Princess Ayeka on the other hand was still the same as the OVA. The most irritating character on the show HAS got to be Mihoshi. She is the worst character in any of my anime series that I own. The beginning of the series was irritating and it was just annoying, but when they started talking about the ruler Yosho then it got interesting. The ruler happens to be an imposter named Kagato(just like from the OVA series). Then tenchi's grandpa steps in and revives Azaka and Kamedaki(which happens to be quite awesome if i do say so myself) and then rushes to Jurai to confront the imposter. Then ill leave the conclusion to the viewers of the series. Over all it wasn't a bad series just the beginning was horrible but the ending kinda makes up for it.",1109289600,2,1018,4.420212765957447
