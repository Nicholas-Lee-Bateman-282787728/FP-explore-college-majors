8375555,5,B002NXSRKW,Lauren Winner's personal connection is just as good in an interview as it is in her books!  Great small group discussion starter material.,1383004800,,138,5.0
8375556,2,B002NXSRKW,"I found this DVD of the set to be the best so far.

Lauren Winner makes one great statement that this whole section could have been based on...""Adoring God is an end.""  Meaning that there is nothing more to gain from the practice.  We are here to adore God. (period)

I liked how she brought up this point, but then seemed to almost contradict herself by going on to talk about the importance of spiritual disciplines and how Christians have forgotten them.

In my history with the church I can not often recall a friend who didn't wish that they read their bible or prayed more.  Or who didn't make statements that alluded to how brief their quiet times are and how much they wanted to change that.

I think for me it would have been refreshing to watch a conversation between two people discussing the importance of adoring God as an end and not a means.",1267056000,3,856,4.414012738853503
