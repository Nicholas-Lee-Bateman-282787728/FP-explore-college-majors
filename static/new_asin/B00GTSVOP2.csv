8627412,4,B00GTSVOP2,"""Loves Her Gun"" is a look at fear and how we deal with it, something we just don't see often enough of in the movies. Take the victimized girl out of violent New York, drop her in a gun culture like Texas, and just watch how her outlook shifts. Allie, the victim of a violent attack in Brooklyn, impulsively heads out to Austin with some (very) new friends. Once there, she she finds herself embracing new ideas about how we can protect (or isolate) ourselves with weapons. The outcome is open to debate (everything's subjective, after all). But the journey there is one I highly recommend",1401580800,,589,4.566037735849057
8627413,2,B00GTSVOP2,This one of the new movies that I haven't been able to watch in its entirety.  I found the storyline slow and painful to watch and had to call it quits after 50 minutes.,1398556800,,169,3.9705882352941178
8627414,5,B00GTSVOP2,I enjoyed this movie very much! Trieste Kelly Dunn did an excellent job as a woman dealing terrible feelings of anxiety caused by a violent attack on her. Trying to feel safe again was becoming a impossible task and when she thinks she has found a remedy it turns out it probably wasn't the answer she had hoped for.,1398470400,,316,4.372881355932203
8627415,5,B00GTSVOP2,"Loves Her Gun won the Louis Black Lone Star Award at the SXSW Film Festival in 2013 and it is easy to see why.  Writer and director Geoff Marslett, along with fellow writer Lauren Modery, tell the compelling story of how a violent crime in a young womans life becomes a turning point for her and the viewers.  Everything that follows, the nuanced dialogue of Allie, ably played by actress Trieste Kelly Dunn and her love interest, Clark, played by actor Francisco Barreiro, in one way or another alludes to that moment.
If you pay close enough attention, you even see subliminally inserted frames in the gunshot flashes as Allie takes target practice in a field in the Texas hill country.

The opening sequence, framed by cinematographer Amy Bench, wonderfully conveys the desolation of the scary and barren back streets of Brooklyn at night, and the long shots juxtapose slender and vulnerable Allie against those mean streets.  The overall effect portrays her as more likely fearless than nave as she searches for a bands gig.

After the assault the story moves to Austin, and inexorably to its shocking conclusion, Allie takes us on a slow ride through a range of experiences such as culture shock, love interests, hidden agendas and coping with the unfamiliar emotion of fear.  It is her clumsiness in coping with fear  and the lack of necessary tools to deal with it  that are what watching her bravely attempt to try do so, so riveting.

See it.  See it again.  You will love it!",1397433600,,1485,4.739299610894942
