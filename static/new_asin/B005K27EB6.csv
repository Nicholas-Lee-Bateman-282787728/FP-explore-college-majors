8476423,1,B005K27EB6,"I was once contemplating adding Cartoon Network shows to my lineup of Nicktoon titles, and I was interested to find out if this show was worth my while to add.

It really isn't. Without going into too much detail, this show is one of the WORST I have seen.
The pacing of each episode is bad, either abruptly jumping all over the place without rhyme or reason, focusing on unimportant details that could have easily been cut out of the episode, or employing an unfunny running gag that grates on your nerves. The characters are either annoying as hell or bland as cardboard, the jokes are unfunny and badly executed, and all our main hero seems to do is punch and kick bad guys while sounding like a mildly annoyed cop chasing after some jaywalkers, to varying degrees of success. There is nothing remarkable about her despite what the show tells you, and that is a shame, her character design is the best in the show.

What is especially insulting if the nerve of Cartoon Network charging $40+ for a single season of this garbage. 40 dollars. I bought the ENTIRE COLLECTION of ""My Life as a Teenage Robot"" (a much better show, BTW), all three volumes for 3 dollars LESS than that. Seriously, go buy that instead.

As for this? If you like the show, go buy it when it hits the bargain bin somewhere, if you want it that much. $40 for unfunny drek like this is a ripoff, no matter how many ways you slice it.",1408147200,,1406,4.420849420849421
