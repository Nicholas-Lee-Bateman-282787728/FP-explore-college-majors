7788610,3,0767082184,"Despite what the Amazon product description claims, this video, while well done, is not closed-captioned or subtitled.  If you're hearing-impaired, you might want to consider another DVD that is really closed-captioned.",1244592000,4,219,6.064516129032258
7788611,5,0767082184,"Well presented,especially the idea of Jack being a true unknown. A good addition to anybodys Ripper library.",1206489600,11,108,5.411764705882353
7788612,1,0767082184,"I find this DVD completely inaccurate. The facts do not make any sence. I used this DVD for year 10 courswork and it literally put them to sleep. We did not get to watch all of the DVD on account of the extreme boardom of the class. I found jack the ripper interesting, but now, after this, I have lost all taste for the subject. I strongly urge everybody not to buy this DVD. There is only one word I can use to discribe it, S**T",1134691200,7,430,4.011627906976744
7788613,4,0767082184,"I'm a big fan of History's Channel's History's Mysteries series, & this installment is by far my favorite.  This is a must-see for anyone interested in Jack the Ripper, or anyone, like myself, who just loves a good mystery.

Of course, as with all specials like these, nothing is really solved, so if you're looking for some startling revelations, go elsewhere.  What you will get is all the necessary background info on the crimes, the suspects, the investigators, & the many theories that have developed over the years.  They present an excellent sampling of authors & others to offer their opinions on the case, & let them offer their own ideas rather than assuming one set of ideas to be the truth (for example, some think the same 'ripper' killer was responsible for only three murders, while others put his count in the double-digits).

All in all, this is a very well-presented documentary, though it is more of a good starter for those new to the Jack the Ripper lore than for the expert looking for new information.  If this sparks your interest, I highly recommend a book called 'The Complete Jack the Ripper Companion' by Stewart P. Evans (who happens to be one of those interviewed in this special) & Keith Skinner.",1126483200,29,1227,4.737089201877934
