1808576,3,B00007G205,"The show itself deserves at least 4 stars but unfortunately there are only 4 episodes on this dvd. If you feel you can't wait for an eventual (hopefully!) complete series release then by all means buy these and cherish them. For everyone else, I would recommend avoiding these releases and getting The Spectacular Spider-Man Complete Series blu ray instead. It might even be a better show than the 90s one. I still can't decide! Also, I would wholeheartedly NOT recommend Ultimate Spider-Man as it is a huge pile of crap. The show, not the comic. The comic is 100% amazing.",1401062400,,573,4.74
1808577,5,B00007G205,"I must have ordered this on Sunday or Monday I can't remember, and wow it is amazing just that the fact that it came Tuesday exactly as estimated, and free no extra charge for over night delivery or whatever, I love seeing dare devil and spiderman work together it was really awesome.

the best part of this was that it came with another order of the spider man collectors item kit I guess with the spider man movie #1, a re-print of the #1 spiderman which I wanted the most, and an autograph from Joe Rimmita which was awesome, I think from that autograph alone I can make back the money I spent on it and have an amazing edition to my collection of spiderman, this is def. worth it, if your thinking weather or not to get it, trust me it is def worth it!!!!! All I did was open the box to find these treasures and I am speechless, I can't wait to even watch the movie that they included with it which is Spider man #1 the first spider-man movie and this is actually the best super hero movie to me after seeing the superman movies that I cant even watch more then 5 minutes of compared to spider-man when they go into the origin, the man behind the mask, how he discovered his powers and everything its that amazing!! they don't say AMAZING SPIDERMAN for nothing!!!! The movie itself was worth the money because of how amazing it is, how much Stan Lee helped with the movie made it perfect.
but an entire package ot a re-print spiderman #1 plus the dvd alone is worth at least $20 plus the autograph, I mean it's amazing to get so much for such a low price, especially if your a Spider-Man fan, I love captain America, The Falcon and all those, Spider-man isn't even that high up on my list of favorite hero's..many x-men are ahead of him even in my list lol. But this package deal for under $20 even to someone who doesn't like spider-man that much...this is a great deal and if you hold on to it for 5-20 years you will have made a very smart choice and can even make profit from it if you hold in long enough, it really is amazing!!!",1393891200,,2038,4.225641025641026
1808578,5,B00007G205,"33-34.  Framed/The Man Without Fear:  Peter Parker is framed by Richard Fisk for selling government secrets to foreign organizations.  As lawyer Matt Murdock defends him in court, he also fights along Spider-Man as Daredevil.  The crossover episodes are always great, & this is one of my favorites.  Daredevil is one of my top 10 favorite Marvel series, & it was a thrill to see him here & on the excellent Fantastic Four episode And a Blind Man Shall lead Them (which is included here by the way).  A+

35.  The Ultimate Slayer:  Kingpin attempts to kill Spider-Man by turning Smythe into a cyborg and let him do it.  Another great episode.  A

36. Tombstone:  Tombstone is hired by Alisha Silver to destroy the story planned for the Daily Bugle revealing that she had taken over her father's criminal organisation, in exchange for large amounts of cash. Tombstone attempts to use Robbie Robertson, whom he was childhood friends with, to kill the story.  Another good episode.  A-

Not a bad deal for comic book fans and those who think that Tobey played a better Peter Parker than Andrew.",1354320000,2,319,4.333333333333333
1808581,5,B00007G205,"I just finished watching this DVD and boy was it great. The DVD contains The Sins of the Fathers VI-IX, with the respective episodes titled ""Framed"", ""The Man Without Fear"" and ""The Ultimate Slayer"" and ""Tombstone."" Each episode was well done and had superb animation for the time period. ""Framed"" and ""Tombstone"" were the best, as they showcase Dare Devil and Robbie while expanding on the backstory of the characters. ""Framed"" has two strong supporting female characters, one a protagonist, the other an antagonist. This is rare in comics, which only drew me to the story that much more. Too, The King Pin features prominently in this episode. His backstory was fascinating, and he was voiced by the late great Roscoe Lee Brown, a tremendous character actor in his own right.

Buy this DVD and you won't be disappointed. Buy it as part of Spiderman: The Ultimate Villain Showdown and you really will be delighted.

1808624,4,B00007G205,"It's hard for me to pick out a favorite, from all the animated Spidey TV shows. Basically, I've always just been too busy being thankful that the wallcrawler's on the small screen, in the first place. This dvd here, DAREDEVIL VS. SPIDER-MAN, is from the terrific 1990s Spider-Man cartoon. And while I've been in the recent habit of slamming dvd releases containing paltry sums of episodes, I'm just glad these suckers are made available at all in dvd. Because who the eff knows when we'll get full season releases on this series? Me, I'm hunkering down for a looong wait.

Spidey is an icon, and his fans won't suffer too many years elapsing without his being on TV or, nowadays, in a feature film. This particular cartoon incarnation ran from 1994 to 1998 for 65 episodes, and, even at its final stages, it was still well received enough to garner its own sequel series in 1999, the very short lived (and inferior) SPIDER-MAN UNLIMITED, which placed Spidey on Counterearth.

Back to the 1994 series: Most of the classic Spider-Man elements are here. From his everyday sadsack life to his familiar supporting cast, from his rogues' gallery (excepting Sandman) to his sense of humor and bad guy baiting. And in this one, Peter is still attending college at Empire State U, even as he continues to shoot photos for the Daily Bugle.

The four episodes in DAREDEVIL VS. SPIDER-MAN are pulled from Season 3's ""Sins of the Fathers"" story arc (Chapters VI - IX). Daredevil, by the way, appears in only the first two of these episodes (""Framed"" and ""The Man Without Fear""). When Peter Parker is hired by the Kingpin and then framed and arrested for a federal crime, blind attorney Matt Murdock's services are mysteriously engaged in Peter's defense. But when his civilian identity proves inadequate, Murdock dons the more action-friendly guise of Daredevil. Then comes the inevitable misunderstanding and skirmish between superheroes, followed by the teaming up, and ends with Parker exonerated and the Kingpin walking away unscathed.

One quibble I have is that I don't buy the actor voicing Matt Murdock/Daredevil. For whatever reason, I just don't think Daredevil's voice is that deep.

The third episode, ""The Ultimate Slayer,"" revolves around Alistair Smythe and his unwilling transformation into a half-cyborg Spider Slayer, thanks to the Kingpin. Blaming Norman Osbourne for his father's death, Smythe targets him for revenge. Meanwhile, Peter learns that Harry and Mary Jane are engaged.

In ""Tombstone,"" with the Daily Bugle about to publish an expose on Alicia Silvermane and her crime syndicate, the supertough, superstrong albino Tombstone is hired to put pressure on Bugle editor Robbie Robertson. And, surprisingly, these two share a past.

And, throughout all this, the mystical Madame Web occasionally steps in with some obscure, befuddling advice for Spidey, no doubt her way of prepping him for the cosmic events in the final season.

Compared to today's standards, the animation here is more clumsy, not to mention that the occasional use of CG in cityscape sequences tends to clash with the 2D stuff. Also, the wallcrawler is at times depicted as too bulky a figure. However, the quality of the storytelling and the nice continuity make up for whatever the visuals may lack. Because of the restrictions placed on the series by the Fox network, it's still an action packed series, but not as dynamic as it could've been. One of the funnier, more offbeat restrictions prevents Spidey from harming pigeons whenever he landed on a roof. Also, FOX had prohibited the inclusion of genuine firearms, so the bad guys and even the law enforcers made do with laser guns. It's a bit jarring, and initially had me thinking that this Spidey was set in the near future.

For what it is, this dvd actually comes thru with decent special features: optional Stan Lee intros to each of the featured four episodes; a bonus episode (""King Pinned"") from the 1966 Spidey cartoon; another bonus episode (""And a Blind Man Shall Lead Them""), from the 1990s Fantastic Four cartoon guest-starring Daredevil, in which the FF lose their super powers; and Stan Lee's Soapbox, as Stan reflects long and nostalgically about Daredevil (around 18 minutes).

Some trivia for fans of the show: Starting with the second year, the episodes in each season began to be linked in a single, season-long, over-arcing storyline. So, for example, the individual episode titles of Season 2 all fell under the ""Neogenic Nightmare"" banner. Season 3, under ""The Sins of the Fathers"" banner. Season 4, under ""Partners in Danger."" And Season 5, ""Forgotten Warriors."" I understand that the network heads were utterly ticked off at head writer John Semper, whose idea it was to insert long-running storylines.

Most of the dvds available about this series seem to focus on Season 3, which is the ""Sins of the Fathers"" story arc. Chapters II-V of it are collected in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spider-Man-The-Ultimate-Villain-Showdown-Animated-Series/dp/B0000633UA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spider-Man - The Ultimate Villain Showdown (Animated Series)</a>.

The only episode missing is part one of ""Sins of the Fathers"" (the one with Dr. Strange) and one can only wonder why it's not included.

Personally, I'm waiting on the dvd release of the last season, which features the ""Six Forgotten Warriors"" saga, the 3-part ""Secret Wars"" (based on the Secret Wars comic book maxi-series) and the 2-part series finale ""Spider-Wars,"" as, in another reality, Peter and five other Spideys must go up against Spider-Carnage.

Even the bad stories were still good with these two! This animated version is no exception as these two team up after a brief misunderstanding to take on the Kingpin (a major DD foe as well as Spider-Man) and his goons!
The extra episode with FF and Daredevil was also entertaining. A slight lighter DD in that one but no less intrigiging. A good addition to the other Spider-Man DVD's out there!

1808631,4,B00007G205,"Animation in the best tradition of G.I. Joe, voiceovers a la X-Men, dialogue like Gargoyles.  No surprises here, just fond memories of weekday afternoons and Saturday mornings.
Pluses: the overarching plot (""Sins of the Fathers"") does not disappoint, though admittedly no other element here comes close to that quality.  The Kingpins' voice is the best one there; all others (including Majel Barrett) overact in the finest cartoon tradition.
Minuses: the digitization is poor, catching half-frames and getting quite jerky at times.  Some of the dialogue is downright cheesy, and logic... well, this is a cartoon, not a comic.
All good fun, just don't expect more than a cartoon can provide.",1049500800,5,690,5.254545454545455
