8201564,5,B000RNUKPA,"Because of the way the parts of the '.hack' package are being released, I am not sure if this is a series of episodes based on video games, or vice versa. A rather ingenious marketing ploy will probably have many of us buying '.hack' releases for some time to come. Fortunately, from what I have seen the producers have spared little expense in creating a quality product. Therefore, other than the amount we will be out of pocket, there is very little to complain about.",1223337600,,471,4.552941176470588
