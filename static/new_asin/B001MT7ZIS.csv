3698903,4,B001MT7ZIS,"The ending of the ""Stargate SG-1"" TV show left some threads dangling -- the last Goa'uld System Lord was still in hiding, and the Ori were still threatening the world.

Fortunately those threads are more or less tied up in the two direct-to-DVD movies that followed: ""Stargate: The Ark of Truth"" and ""Stargate: Continuum."" While they don't quite have the unique flavour of the TV series, these movies do bring back all the favorite characters (and some departed villains) in a double finale to its winding stories.

""The Ark of Truth"" is an Ancient device that brainwashes people -- and SG-1 is searching for it, where they run into Vala's ex-hubby Tomin (who ends up teaming up with them). But soon they have a lead on where the Ark might be, and head for Celestis in the hopes of finding a bloodless method of stopping the Ori once and for all.

Unfortunately they have a slew of new problems -- Ori motherships are approaching Earth with the intent to convert or destroy, a nasty IOA rep has created and loosed a very familiar enemy on the Odyssey, and Vala's malevolent daughter Adria has gained godlike power. Fortunately SG-1 has a powerful ally of their own.

And once again, there is time-twisting with ""Continuum."" SG-1 and General Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) are watching the execution and extraction of Ba'al... but unfortunately, it's not the real Ba'al. The real Ba'al has time-traveled and altered the timeline, causing Teal'c (Christopher Judge), Vala (Claudia Black) and the Tok'ra to vanish, and resulting in Jack's death.

Unfortunately, this alternate timeline becomes more perilous after a year -- Earth is being threatened by the supreme System Lord Ba'al, his queen Qetesh (in Vala's body) and his First Prime Teal'c. But when Qetesh and Ba'al clash over his past on Earth, the altered SG-1 must band together to find and destroy Ba'al's time machine, and somehow restore the timeline to what it once was.

""Stargate: The Ark of Truth"" and ""Stargate: Continuum"" are basically intended to wrap up loose ends, and as such they're not quite as satisfying as the television show was. ""Ark of Truth"" sometimes feels rather rushed and has a somewhat out-of-the-blue solition, and ""Continuum"" may need multiple viewings to keep up with the time-bouncing plotline.

But as finales they're solid pieces of work -- lots of action, space battles, mysterious artifacts, and a way bigger budget that a TV episode would ever have allowed. And they both have everything that you'd expect from ""Stargate SG-1"" -- pop culture homages (""Star Wars""!), some recurring characters (Apophis!), and alien nasties with overwhelming power. There's even some subtle moral dilemmas about belief and fighting the Ori followers.

It also has excellent scripting: plot threads drawn from the TV series, witty dialogue (""That is, after all, why we've come. Why we had to endure all of that singing. Get rid of the last bad guy and then there's cake""), and some nice quiet moments, such as Teal'c talking with Tomin about their bloodstained pasts. And they manage to throw some interesting twists at the audience, such as a shocking revelation about the Ori.

And seeing the actors as their SG-1 characters is like putting on a comfortable old shoe. Amanda Tapping and Michael Shanks are suitably brilliant and courageous, and Ben Browder gets to shine especially in ""Continuum"" as a strong, slightly quirky soldier. Christopher Judge gets to shine in ""Ark of Truth"" as a powerful, wise warrior, and Black gets to be both funny and emotional.

And of course, Richard Dean Anderson utterly steals the show whenever he appears (""Hey, have you ever tried to find a bathroom in a pyramid?"") and Tim Guinee has a good smallish role as Tomin.

It's a little sad to see the main storylines of the Stargate universe end, but ""Stargate: The Ark of Truth"" and ""Stargate: Continuum"" are well worth seeing. Nice finales.",1231459200,60,3906,4.948091603053435

3699004,5,B001MT7ZIS,"For StarGate SG1 fans such as myself this is a must have. Really its like two more TV episodes the way the movies are scripted. Sam uses her brain power along with Daniel to save the team with Cam and Te'alk flexing their muscles and firepower and charm then there is Vahla with her flirtatious humor. Both movies are a bit slow in the middle. The Ori seems to be an unstoppable force in Ark of Truth but SG1 manages to pull off the impossible at the last minute. Continuum seemed in the previews it would have more spectacular dogfights between F15s MiGs and Gliders but it was a series of brief AF footage and some low grade CGI scenes so this is obviously low budget as were most of the SG1 shows. In much of Stargate SG1 I could see similarities to Star Wars, Star Trek and Indiana Jones and there are blatant references throughout the episodes and I felt that in these movies as well. I really liked the scenes in Ark of Truth and the theme music too. To me it was the actors and actresses that made StarGate SG1 and they made up for the short comings. Get this movie sit back watch and enjoy.",1425081600,,1098,4.258373205741627
3699005,5,B001MT7ZIS,"I purchased this & all 10 seasons & have waited until watching all 10 seasons before giving my review. I just want to say that the dvds I received were great, no scratches on the discs & they all played instantly. The quality of these blu ray looked beautiful & was well worth the buy.  The delivery of the items was superb, & they arrived undamaged & arrived ahead of schedule. I would recommend this to all the fans of the Stargate franchise or those who are interested into getting into the series. Next up Stargate Atlantis on blu ray!",1424476800,,539,4.39
3699006,3,B001MT7ZIS,"While the stories for these movies was good, they just didn't have the same feeling as the show. The music seemed different and some of the character's dialog and acting wasn't right and didn't really match with how they behaved in the series. That disappointed me.

Ark of Truth finishes off the events of the last couple of seasons of the show but I felt it could have been done a bit different. The series builds up their big finale but the story for the movie just felt like it was missing something and they could have done a bit better.

Continuum was a fun story but again, I felt they could have done a little better with bits of it. I enjoyed it much better than Ark of Truth though.",1424304000,2,692,4.2748091603053435
3699007,5,B001MT7ZIS,These two movies wrap up the SG-1 series. This was one of my favorite sci-fi tv series. If you watched the series and want the movies I recommend buying these. The ark of truth wraps up the Ori part of the series. And Contiuum wraps up the Goa'uld part of the series. I think Continuum is the better of the two movies. What are you waiting for an invitation? Go ahead and order it if you are a fan of the series!,1424217600,,412,4.036585365853658

3699012,5,B001MT7ZIS,"I invested in the entire collection of StarGate episodes, and had the same feeling as others that the ORI thread and the G'ould thread still posed threats to Earth.

3699034,4,B001MT7ZIS,"I love Stargate, and I bemoan the day SG1 got cancelled. These movies are OK, but not particularly great, nor even up to the standards of the series. ""Ark of Truth"" is a ""Hurry and rap it up"" TV movie to end up the Ori storyline. It's both rushed and padded out, oddly, and is kind of unfulfilling. The better of the two is Continuum, which has some great performances and a nice story about an alternate timeline. This isn't exactly mining new territory: SG1 did this exact sort of thing several times in the course of the series, but it's a nice final farewell to the Goauld and their many storylines, and a lot of fun. It's far and away the better of the two, even if the bit with Cam's grand-uncle really makes no sense.",1388275200,,724,4.291970802919708

3699073,5,B001MT7ZIS,"Continuum is pretty good, but my favorite was Ark Of Truth.  Both are justifiable additions, and well thought out, well acted pieces to the Stargate SG-1 puzzle. Ark of Truth has the feel of a fairly expensive to produce feature, and the familiar people are where they belong. Continuum almost bordered upon being a little cliche for me due to the re-emergence of Ba'al. His character has ran its course in my opinion and I think it would have been just as interesting if a new other system lord had been used instead. Nonetheless, I would recommend Continuum just because of the performances in the roles of Daniel, Sam, and Cam. The real deal though is the Ark Of Truth. There is all of the captivating gadgetry, pageantry, good guys and uber-bad evil Ori Priors, including the HQ intermediary dude in the fancy high priest cloak. Of course Claudia Black is outstanding again as she so adeptly amalgamated into the series so well and became a standard actress, integral to the storyline because of her character being the mother of the Ori Queen. This type of Science Fiction is an out of the park home run in my opinion. I definitely say you need to own both of these movies for your Stargate SG-1 collection.",1262822400,,1212,4.637209302325582
3699084,5,B001MT7ZIS,"I was completely entertained and blown away at the level of these last movies, though I agree with the other readers I was disappointed to see an end to the stargate series as I knew it. I'm looking forward to this next one Stargate: Universe or whatever it was called.

These movies finished the loops and although it would have been nice to make both movies an 11th season with one hell of a super-finale, I'm satisfied with these movies as the last stone footprints of the Stargate: SG-1 team.

And I was a fan of the Atlantis series... Too bad the Sci-Fi channel prefers to put their budget in horrendous and terrible ""horror"" movies or lesser TV shows... We can only pray for a second SG-1 go. And it wouldn't be the same without a little Jack in the mix. Rich really made a huge landmark in the series and all of the actors have become universally known to a large and new sci-fi community.

I'd love to talk through that gate, even as an extra who gets blasted by a staff weapon... I'd let them blow up some fireworks on my clothes for 2 seconds of fame... sure would be fun.",1259625600,,1082,4.320197044334975
3699085,5,B001MT7ZIS,"I'll admit, I was a little bitter about the SG-1 cancellation.  I still am.  And while 'Ark of Truth' felt like a year or two worth of stories compressed down into 90 minutes, it still managed to be a thoroughly satisfying 90 minutes and a good resolution to many outstanding story points.

Continuum marked the series' first independent film story, and did so quite well.  The story feels a little like a rehash of certain other time travel/AU stories that SG-1 did over the years, but here it's executed with a style and flare they simply didn't have the time or budget for in episodic television.

I bought both of these films separately as they came out, and still feel that both were worth their individual prices.  Here, bundled together at half what I paid, is a total steal.  This is worth every penny.",1254873600,2,810,4.583333333333333
3699086,5,B001MT7ZIS,"I'll be the first to admit I wasn't looking forward to the straight to dvd stargate movies.  While I enjoyed the show, I wasn't expecting much from them.  But it turned out Stargate prospered with the bigger budget!  The first, ark of truth is the conclusion to the ori story.  Though it started slow, it really picked up, and turned into a monstrously entertaining movie.  Though I wish it could have been a few episodes (or instead a full season), what they did was very good, and a good conclusion to the Ori story.

As to Continuum, I was suprised with how much fun it was.  Given the time travel nature of the story, I thought the fact that the show brought back feelings from so many seasons was a great effect.  They also brought back old characters, including Goul'd Lords, who I haven't seen in years.  Though the story was full of holes (like most time travel pieces) it was very interesting.  For those wondering the difference between this and the seperate releases, there are none.  They just put the discs in one new case, so if you have them both, you don't need to buy it again.",1251331200,29,1094,4.447236180904523

They should at least do like Star Trek did, the movies yes, but also ""so far"" Season 1 of TOS and already planned to have the 2 other seasons come out in a couple of months... this gives hope to get all Star Trek in Blu-ray.

Hopefully, by the time Stargate Atlantis ""Fans Choice"" comes out... maybe SG-1 season 1?",1247270400,,559,3.938053097345133
3699088,4,B001MT7ZIS,"Both productions are great entertainment, though Continuum is by far the best of the two. I find the names ironic because the whole idea behind these productions were that they were to provide a CONTINUUM to the popular Sci-Fi Channel show, Stargate SG-1; however the TRUTH is, there have been no further productions, nor have I heard that any were in the works.

Continuum is a time travel show that's exceptionally well done. It brings an end to SG-1's long-fought war with the G'aould System Lords. Ark of Truth, conversely, brings to an end the also long-fought war with the galactic cult, the Ori.

The two persisting problems with the show are not resolved. The first is why everyone in two galaxies speak English and happen to be mostly white and Anglo in appearance. The second is why no Asians or other races are ever found. Blobs of makeup in the forehead aren't good enough these days and both problems could be resolved with some creative applications.

To the producers, we're still waiting for more. On the other hand, if these productions didn't net enough money to be profitable, it appears this is it. That would be unfortunate.

These stories are both worthwhile. I like them.",1245974400,2,1194,4.781553398058253
3699089,4,B001MT7ZIS,"As a major Stargate fan and owner of almost all episodes of the series, I was slightly disappointed with both of these titles.  As regular episodes, I believe they were great but to set them out as separate movies really created expectations that they did not live up to.  I was really looking forward to seeing Richard Dean Anderson in the Continuum but he may have been on screen for a total of 15 minutes.  Continuum focused on Sam, Daniel and Cam mainly leaving the other characters as occasional images in the story.  As a time travel story it was good but as with most stories using that tool it leaves you questioning how it could have happened that way.  Ark of Truth overall was a better story and helped complete the series as it should have been done.  Overall, both movies had great action, team work and continued the story lines where they ended from the TV series.  I would recommend it for fans of the series but those of you who have never seen the series will probably be lost and not enjoy it nearly as much.",1238025600,5,1027,4.402116402116402
3699090,5,B001MT7ZIS,I have always been a fan of Sci-fi and this series which started with Stargate SG1 was great. It maybe Sci-fi but when it comes to Sci-fi it is a very realistic setting and story line behind it.,1237507200,,194,4.131578947368421
3699091,4,B001MT7ZIS,"This set comes as two separate blu-ray disc, one for each movie. They do not have any more extras than appear on the individual DVD sets. The transfer quality was excellent for ""The Ark of Truth,"" a bit less so for ""Continuum."" However, even ""Continuum"" looked decent on my HDTV. Sound quality was good for both movies.

Let me say a word about the movies themselves. I loved ""The Ark of Truth."" I found it's storyline and ending deeply satisfying. It had an interesting plot, was visually stunning in blu-ray, gave a number of the actors nice scenes, and tied up all the loose ends and unanswered questions in a really nice way. Is there anything I disliked in the film? A few things. I would have shortened the long helicopter intro and cut out at least half of Judge's character walking, walking, and doing more walking. However, there's more a lot more right with the movie than wrong with it. Michael Shanks, in particular, has a remarkable scene when his character Daniel Jackson finally reaches his breaking point. His despair is appropriate given the circumstances he is in -- jailed in another universe, abandoned by his ship, with one of the team thought dead, and tortured for no other reason than to make him suffer. His loss of hope, and how he finds the strength to move forward again, is all the more powerful because throughout the series, Daniel has always been tenacious and insanely optimistic. His crisis of faith is beautifully filmed and deeply moving. Shanks really brings it home, and it has become my favorite scene in the movie. All in all, I'd give ""The Ark of Truth"" more than 5 stars if I could.

""Continuum"" is another matter. It is really hard to pull off a good time travel story. This does a fair job, has some nice moments, but on my first viewing, I felt it didn't quite pull it off, despite a wonderful scene where the survivors of SG1 meet the alternate universe Jack O'Neil. I also liked Michael Shank's scenes of finding a book written by his alternate self, and his attempt to encourage that other him by a long-distance phone call (I wished we'd seen the alternate him's reactions there). Shanks had some good lines, including ""Are there any grown ups I can speak to?"" to a Russian soldier. The actor, William Devine, who plays the US president is also excellent. My rating? I would say 3 and a half stars if seen by itself, and 4 stars if viewed after listening to the commentary track.

I need to say a word about the extras. They were disappointing to say the least. No deleted scenes. No bloopers. No alternate endings (although these were mentioned in the commentary tracks). ""The Ark of Trust"" had the worst commentary track I've ever heard. Really, really boring. They should NEVER have had the director of photography and director do the commentary. Perhaps they thought adding Christopher Judge would help. It didn't. All they did was talk about the camera lenses they used, the cost of the shots, etc. while Judge congratulated them on what a great job they had done. Hardly a word about the story, actors, or things that happened on the set. I kept thinking that sooner or later they HAD to talk about something more interesting...but there were only about 5-10 minutes worth of it that wound up worthwhile. The alternate track for ""Continuum"" proved to be the opposite, despite not involving any actors. In this case, the Director and author of the script provided a lively, fun, and insightful commentary, full of interesting anecdotes. It actually made the movie more interesting, so that when I watched it again, I realized ""Continuum"" was better than I'd felt the first time. The only other extra I enjoyed was the mini-summary/series review that you could run before ""The Ark of Truth,"" which caught you up to date on what had happened up to that point. It was very well done and came out great on blu-ray.

I do not regret buying this set, although I'm glad I paid Amazon's discounted rate for it. Of the two, I really enjoyed the first movie more than the second, and may never watch any of the ""extras"" again. I really can't help thinking they could have at least given us a deleted scene or two and the alternate ending they nearly did for ""The Ark of Truth."" I don't see that it would have been that hard. Now days, every movie knows not to toss that footage out. I also would have liked a commentary by Richard Dean Anderson, Michael Shanks, and some of the other actors. As it is, the extras come across as really poor for something on blu-ray. Because of that, I'm giving it 4 stars.",1237420800,23,4549,4.605425400739827
3699092,4,B001MT7ZIS,"Looking forward to owning this double feature, I've wanted to add these to my SG-1 collection for awhile but didn't want to pay full price for both DVDs.  Pre-ordered this for cost considerations, I think this will be the last time I pre-order anything, found out Target will have this for the same price as what I paid here, Walmart will have it for even a little less.  I'm not going to cancel this order but I think it will be the last time I pre-order anything as the proposed savings just aren't there.  I shopped around for quite awhile before pre-ordering this, didn't know until just today that the brick & mortar stores were going to have it for the same price (or less).

That I've given this 4 stars should not be a reflection of the actual movies themselves, but more for Amazon's lack of any real savings on the pre-order of this double feature.  Pre-ordering should give an individual the opportunity to purchase a DVD at a savings over what it will end up selling for once it becomes readily available, or else why bother with pre-ordering?

Edit:  March 6th, my copy of this arrived today, thank you Amazon for the quick delivery.  This DVD has no art whatsoever inside the case, just 2 disks.  I was expecting the first releases of this would've had some inserts, or something fancy inside the case, but no.

Glad I got these 2 movies for a decent price per movie, but I notice that Amazon's current price is the same as it was on pre-order, so my question remains valid:  What good is pre-ordering?  You don't get any kind of special deal for it, might as well just wait for it to get released.  -kd5-",1235865600,4,1619,4.447457627118644
3699093,4,B001MT7ZIS,"The ending of the ""Stargate SG-1"" TV show left some threads dangling -- the last Goa'uld System Lord was still in hiding, and the Ori were still threatening the world.

Fortunately those threads are more or less tied up in the two direct-to-DVD movies that followed: ""Stargate: The Ark of Truth"" and ""Stargate: Continuum."" While they don't quite have the unique flavour of the TV series, these movies do bring back all the favorite characters (and some departed villains) in a double finale to its winding stories.

""The Ark of Truth"" is an Ancient device that brainwashes people -- and SG-1 is searching for it, where they run into Vala's ex-hubby Tomin (who ends up teaming up with them). But soon they have a lead on where the Ark might be, and head for Celestis in the hopes of finding a bloodless method of stopping the Ori once and for all.

Unfortunately they have a slew of new problems -- Ori motherships are approaching Earth with the intent to convert or destroy, a nasty IOA rep has created and loosed a very familiar enemy on the Odyssey, and Vala's malevolent daughter Adria has gained godlike power. Fortunately SG-1 has a powerful ally of their own.

And once again, there is time-twisting with ""Continuum."" SG-1 and General Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) are watching the execution and extraction of Ba'al... but unfortunately, it's not the real Ba'al. The real Ba'al has time-traveled and altered the timeline, causing Teal'c (Christopher Judge), Vala (Claudia Black) and the Tok'ra to vanish, and resulting in Jack's death.

Unfortunately, this alternate timeline becomes more perilous after a year -- Earth is being threatened by the supreme System Lord Ba'al, his queen Qetesh (in Vala's body) and his First Prime Teal'c. But when Qetesh and Ba'al clash over his past on Earth, the altered SG-1 must band together to find and destroy Ba'al's time machine, and somehow restore the timeline to what it once was.

""Stargate: The Ark of Truth"" and ""Stargate: Continuum"" are basically intended to wrap up loose ends, and as such they're not quite as satisfying as the television show was. ""Ark of Truth"" sometimes feels rather rushed and has a somewhat out-of-the-blue solition, and ""Continuum"" may need multiple viewings to keep up with the time-bouncing plotline.

But as finales they're solid pieces of work -- lots of action, space battles, mysterious artifacts, and a way bigger budget that a TV episode would ever have allowed. And they both have everything that you'd expect from ""Stargate SG-1"" -- pop culture homages (""Star Wars""!), some recurring characters (Apophis!), and alien nasties with overwhelming power. There's even some subtle moral dilemmas about belief and fighting the Ori followers.

It also has excellent scripting: plot threads drawn from the TV series, witty dialogue (""That is, after all, why we've come. Why we had to endure all of that singing. Get rid of the last bad guy and then there's cake""), and some nice quiet moments, such as Teal'c talking with Tomin about their bloodstained pasts. And they manage to throw some interesting twists at the audience, such as a shocking revelation about the Ori.

And seeing the actors as their SG-1 characters is like putting on a comfortable old shoe. Amanda Tapping and Michael Shanks are suitably brilliant and courageous, and Ben Browder gets to shine especially in ""Continuum"" as a strong, slightly quirky soldier. Christopher Judge gets to shine in ""Ark of Truth"" as a powerful, wise warrior, and Black gets to be both funny and emotional.

And of course, Richard Dean Anderson utterly steals the show whenever he appears (""Hey, have you ever tried to find a bathroom in a pyramid?"") and Tim Guinee has a good smallish role as Tomin.

It's a little sad to see the main storylines of the Stargate universe end, but ""Stargate: The Ark of Truth"" and ""Stargate: Continuum"" are well worth seeing. Nice finales.",1231891200,13,3906,4.948091603053435
