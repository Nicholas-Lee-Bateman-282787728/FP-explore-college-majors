1104556,5,6305977607,"This collection includes Fist of Legend, The Enforcer, Twin Warriors, and Defender. Fist fo Legend is one of the best martial arts films ever made. Jet Li is phenomenal and has great charisma. Fist has a good story and  action sequences. The Enforcer was awesome.  The bond between Father and  son was shown well here with the acting of Jet Li and the boy who played  his son.  Their is a great scene were Jet Li slides down glass that has  water running down it.  The boy has some great action sequences, too. Twin  Warriors had a great plot. It also featured some of Jet Li's funniest  moments...he goes a little crazy. Michelle Yeoh and Jet Li had great  chemistry. Defender showed again what and intense and nuanced actor Jet Li  is and can be.  He is the best martial artist as always. If you liked any  of these films you must see Romeo Must Die.  Jet Li never had such great  chemistry with his leading lady, as he had with Aaliyah. Jet Li is the best  and will always be a favorite of mine!",963532800,14,998,4.313513513513514
1104652,2,6305977607,"I was not expecting this very old movie that you have to work hard to keep up with.  When you want to see Jet Li its from the beginning not him as a child then years later in the movie he's a boy and then finally Jet Li.

1104655,3,6305977607,This has 4 movies. You cannot see Dr Wai and the scripture with no words because it looks too blurry. Legend of Kung fu hero is not a movie it's footage of people demonstrating different styles of martial arts but the quality of image is poor. I liked Lee-Thal weapon because here Jet speaks about his career and you learn about him. Evil Cult is OK. I gave it 3 stars because I love Jet Li and I like the part in LEE-THAL WEAPON where they show him in his first movie Shaolin Temple and he looks perfect practicing his martial arts.,1223856000,4,533,4.235294117647059

1104657,3,6305977607,"This collection has poor subtitles, bad video quality, and false representation as to what is on offer, the first two movies are what they claim, where as the 2nd disc contains poor quality documentary on Jet Li, so may be great for a Jet Li fanatic, but not so a Jet Li movie buff!",1178496000,9,282,4.2407407407407405
1104658,3,6305977607,"The Jet Li Collection has a nice interview with Jet Li, interspersed with footage from various film and  ""Lee-thal Weapon"" shows footage of a very young Li Lainjie at wushu competitions.

The two movies that are included in this set are ok. The ""Evil Cult"" is kind of a standard period kung fu movie, with a reasonably standard plot (and acting skills). It's not as good as some of the classics with Jet Li (Once upon a time in China,  Fong Sai Yook etc), but it's ok. Dr Wai is perhaps the more interesting movies as the story line is original and creative, although the action in the movie is very reminiscent of Indianna Jones type scenes. There's not a lot of kung fu, but the up side is there's also not a lot of plasticky hairpieces and rather stilted deliveries. It's also interesting to see Jet Li and Rosamund Kwan interacting on the screen not as Wong Fei Hong and Aunt 13.

The real minus is that Dr Wai, which seemed to have the most potential for being interesting/different, had sound only coming through one speaker and subtitles so blurry you could barely make them out.

For $11.99, it's probably worth it IF you're a Jet Li fan.",1173052800,2,1146,4.464114832535885
1104659,5,6305977607,"I have not seen this particular collection but I picked it up for my sister for her birthday this year and for her it was great. A little background on her; She's 19 and loves anything Asian, yet she knows about *nothing* about Asian history, what she likes is it's culture now i.e. anime and Dir En Grey  and one of her favorite pastimes is checking out Asian men. I, myself, *love* Jet Li films and think he's an amazing Martial Artists so I'm sure I'd love this collection anywhoo but for her she loved it because she thinks Jet Li and the many other Asians in the films were 'hot' and the martial arts in the films are simply a bonus since she enjoys violence also. She told me that and the that she thought the plots were weak but who cares because Asians are hot (She loved The Fast and the Furious, Tokyo Drift so what more can you expect).",1167177600,,847,4.228395061728395
1104660,4,6305977607,"Great movies but 2 of them are in chinese with no titles!!!!!

1104661,1,6305977607,"I will first and foremost explain the frustration of DUBBED movies. The films original format is not on this DVD. It takes away from the movie & actors. It should have been left in it's original sound format. Any real movie enthusiast frowns upon DUBBED. The dubbed voices are horrible, and it takes from the Kung-fu, and the plotline.",1125100800,4,335,4.694915254237288
1104712,5,6305977607,"Yes, it is correct that these are dubbed in English and have new English titles.  But who cares?  What the title and language is in don't have nothing to do with Jet Li and the film.  These still are considered to be Jet Li's best films, or if not the best, some of the Top 10 by far.

I have watched the HK films of each of these movies, that just have English Subtitles.  But like many millions of people, I really don't like watching a movie and trying to read it at the same time.  It takes attention off of watching the action, with having to read whats said.  I still love the regular movies, don't get me wronge.  But I praise for these movies Dubbed in English.  I love it.  Cause now I can watch the movie 100% without having to read it.  Yes, some of the orginal langauge after dubbed in English was slightly changed to say different stuff.  But still yet, its still very good movies, just awesome movies.

So, to all those that just wanna see the films and love Jet Li, these are very worth getting and collecting.  I love having them all in a Collection Set, instead of having each seprate.  I believe makes it much easier and more organized with these sets.  And if you love collection Jet Li sets, I would very reccommend getting along with this Once Upon a Time in China 1, 2, & 3 collection set also.",1116460800,5,1316,4.224899598393574
1104713,2,6305977607,ALl 4 movies in this set are dubbed in English.  I was horribly disappointed. Dont make the same mistake I did. Find the dubbed ones.,1040083200,10,133,4.32
1104714,4,6305977607,"Jet Li is Awesome.  Pretty much that sums it up.  All four movies are good with Fist of Legand rising to the top.  By far, the best martial arts movie I have ever seen.  Fist of Legand, a remake of Bruce Lee's classic Chinese Connection, is truly remarkable.  The story line was adapted from Chinese connction with a few added plot lines.  The action is fluent and runs smoothly throughout the movie.  The classic dojo fight where Chen fights the whole school at once was done perfectly.  And the end fight scene is one of the best I've seen.  It was amazing!
Then, my second favorite of this collection would have to be Twin Warriors.  A truly outstanding traditional chinese Wire Fu masterpiece.  The action throughout  is incredible mixed with light humor.  And, like Fist of Legand, the end fight scene was remarkable.
Next, I would say would be the Enforcer, although when I first saw it as a subtitled movie it was called Father is Hero.  This one incorporates a little bit of a darker story line dealing with the deep undercover work of Li's character.  The fight scenes are good, but do not really dazzle until the end.  Overall it's not a bad flick for any Jet Li fan.
Now the reason I give this collection 4 stars is due to the fact that it has the Defender in it.  It tried to be a story movie first and an action movie second, but in my opinion it didn't do that well of a job.  The action is weak throughout and ends weak.  Definately not one of my favorite movies, but I watch it every once in a while.  A Jet Li fan can appreciate this movie but it probably will never make the top of anybody's list",1034208000,4,1614,4.316666666666666
1104715,5,6305977607,"Twin Warriors (known in those select circles that I only hear rumors of as Tai Chi Master) is just plain neat. It is directed by Yuen Woo Ping and is among my personal favorites of all time (this is not just martial art movies... it just about beat Goodfellas for me.)  Can it be assumed that if you are reading this that you have already scene at least one martial arts film?  Whether it be Mortal Kombat, Bloodsport, or any of the other commercially successfull ones, can this be assumed?  Movies about the dance known as butt-kicking inspire those who have normal lives such as myself because they allow me to have a fantciful life lived vicariously through whoever it is that is showing that they have almost super-human ability in the realm of artfully hurting someone in a very cinematic sort of way.  Thus, since I have just explained what I consider the purpose of these movies is, it is my belief that this movie happens to fufil this desire more than completely.  It has just about everything one could want in such a movie; it even has Jet Li being funny!  This movies distinguishes itself by the fact that it is light even in plot.  Not as in there isn't a plot, but in it doesn't take itself too seriously, a problem I have seen with many such films.
Overall,
Twin Warriors is good.
Kick as much butt as it should.
Jet Li is great.
Buy now, don't hesitate.
PS  Please don't give me bad reviews due to my bad poem.",1006646400,8,1426,4.395437262357414
1104716,5,6305977607,"this is a masterpiece! as far as martial art action films go these are the best there is as far as recent martial arts films . yes they are over the top,and at times a little silly.but if you ask me thats what makes them soo friggin' cool!

1104717,2,6305977607,"On first impression this appear to be a great collection. It contains 4 classic movies by Jet Li. The picture transfer are good and sometimes above average. However, the original soundtracks are completely removed and changed. It would be nice if they have just voice over the Cantonese to English but retained the great and wonderful original music and soundtracks. Take Defender. The original movie was released as Bodyguard from Beijing. It stars a talented pop singer in Hong Kong, Christy Chung and she contributed to the soundtracks by recording a few wonderful songs herself that enhanced the story line and provided appropriated musical theme in the background.  In this collection all you will hear is dub over American voice actors and some basic `special effects' like guns and things breaking up. The whole production is now very cheesy and cheap.  To make matter worse all 4 movies are similarly butchered.",973209600,11,919,5.079470198675497
1104718,3,6305977607,"There is quite a broad range of stories in this 4 movie collection box.
TWIN WARRIORS shows Jet Li's comic side...one that I wasn't aware that he had as he was always very serious in the movies I had seen him in...esp. Lethal Weapon 4 - this was my first introduction to this man of great talent. Basically, TWIN WARRIORS is about 2 boys who grow up together in the Shaolin temple but when they are both kicked out after starting a fight with the whole school they find themselves moving in different directions. One joins the military and the other (Li) helps the rebel cause.
THE DEFENDER sees Jet Li as a highly trained bodyguard, sent from Beijing, to protect a wealthy businessman's girlfriend who has witnessed a murder. Unfortunately, whilst protecting the girl he inadvertently kills the brother of one of the assasins and finds himself a target as well as the girl he's trying to protect. To further complicate matters, he and the girl start to develop feelings for each other. Quite a few similarities with THE BODYGUARD movie starring Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston.
THE ENFORCER is a sentimental favorite as Li plays a father to a kid who's a martial arts expert himself. Little does his family know that he's an undercover cop trying to bust a big criminal in Hong Kong. Ultimately, Li joins forces with a lady HK Inspector, who initially tries to arrest Li for his involvment with the crime boss, and his son in bringing down the bad guys. The fight scene with Li and his son reminds me of the scene in ROMEO MUST DIE when Li teams up with Aaliyah's character to beat up a girl as he state's he can't hit one himself.
FIST OF LEGEND is a remake of Bruce Lee's version. Here, Chen (Li) goes back to Shanghai to avenge the murder of his beloved master. There are several fight scenes here that are quite phenominal but the relationship btwn Chen and his love interest is not very believable. But that's ok because I'm sure you all want to watch the spectacular fight scenes anyway.
All-in-all this is a great set of movies. However, there is ONE FATAL FLAW...all these movies are dubbed and for this reason a lot of the characters sound really ""hammy""! This is a real disappointment for me as I think it detracts quite a lot from the story, leaving many of the characters sounding just plain stupid! If the original soundtrack with dialogue was included then at least you could see the movies in their original format and you would at least have a choice of languages and subtitles.
Now I would just like to find a copy of these movies in their original format, with subtitles. Especially THE DEFENDER (also called THE BODYGUARD FROM BEIJING) & THE ENFORCER. But if you are not fluent in Cantonese/Mandarin and don't like reading subtitles, then this is the version for you. This collection set would also be a great introduction to the world of Jet Li.",970358400,7,2868,4.592592592592593
1104719,4,6305977607,"I first saw Jet Li in 1980. He was 17 years old then.  His first movie  Shaolin Temple amazed me.  I have never seen anyone handle a bamboo stick  like he does.  When I saw Defender, Jet Li's son in the movie reminded me  of how good this kid was and how he reminds me of the young Jet Li.  Jet  Li's skill is superb and although he lack the comedic appeal of Jackie  Chan, he makes up for his unbelievable martial arts move.  I like the Fist  of Legend as well.  Like the remake of Bruce Lee's Fist of Fury, this is  about a young Chinese who has to battle with the Japanese back when Japan  took over China.  The best scene is when Jet Li has to fight his  girlfriend's uncle.  One of the best fight scene I can recall.  The  Defender has it's moment. Jet Li plays a Bodyguard from Beijing.  There is  more guns than fight scene.  Not the Jet Li movie I am used to.  Twin  Dragon is about 2 boys who grew up in the Shaolin Temple, one ending up  fighting with the rebellion group (Li), the other becoming a bad Lieutenant  of the Army.  The best fight scene would be with Michelle Yeoh & her  opponent in the restaurant.  It is more Matrix like, but seeing 2 women  fight with a dixterity & agility is unbelievable.  The last scene where  Li learn Tai Chi was great.  I have to explain to my sons what Tai chi is  and convince them there is really such an Art Form.  I wish Li could have  gone deeper with Art",968716800,12,1411,4.04029304029304
1104720,1,6305977607,"Do NOT order this if you are a serious Jet Li fan.  The films are simply  repackaged classics, and to add insult to injury; they are all  DUBBED.
Take a stand against this type of opportunistic crap; it  belittles a great genre and great artists.

I don't hold anything against Amazon.com for selling it, I  only hope they will make it clear to whomever they purchase it from that  this doesnt fly and their customers are not having it.

Twin Dragons goes by the title Tai-Chi. The Enforcer goes  by the title The Bodyguard From Beijing. The title of Fist Of Legend  remains the same. I have seen these movies and offer tis comment, if you  are of the type that likes your martial arts movies to have highwire  trapeze stunts in them, then the first three movies are for you. If you are  a traditionalist, then fist of legend is for you.",966297600,16,563,4.166666666666667

7899007,1,6305977607,"Let's be honest. First, the Editorial Reviews are more than a little deceiving: ""This box set includes the following film: Evil Cult, Dr. Wai, Legend of Kung Fu Hero and the documentary Lee-thal Weapon 2 DISC SET"" is not accurate. The box set contains only two (2) disks. The Editoral Reviews states: ""the documentary Lee-thal Weapon 2 DISC SET"" cannot be accurate because it should contain a third and fourth disk for the ""documentary ... 2 DISC SET"".

Second, the ONLY good movie on the two discs is on the first disc, side A: Evil Cult. The dialogue is sub-titles, not a problem with, as I enjoy foreign film. It is also corney, funny, weird and fight scenes are excellent. Sadly, when you flip the first disk over for side B, film two: ""Dr. Wai, althoyugh it is DUBBED in English like the first film, the sub-titles are so blurred they cannot be read (Total Eye Strain). Now, mind you, my wife and I enjoy sub-titles and wish that Hollywood would MAKE every film with sub-titles, but this is horrible.

The other disk contains two remaining files but they are cheaply made, hard to understand having no sub-titles or any explanations are provided to help understand what is occurring. I recognize that the seller may not be able to control the content of the discs sole, but a more honest description of what is contained on both discs would not only be helpful, but give both the product and the seller better reviews.

My one star is for the first film only: ""Evil Cult"". Outside of that movie the flip side can be viewed but the sub-titles cannot be read. The second disc, in my opinion, is worthless. This is NOT a ""4 Film Collector's Edition"", the only thing the seller is doing is warning buyers to STAY AWAY from their products.",1514764800,,1739,4.5673076923076925
