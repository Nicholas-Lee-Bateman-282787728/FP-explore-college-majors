5296339,5,B009AF5OY8,"This last collection was released as ""Lewis: Series Seven"" in the U.K. (available via Amazon U.K.); here it will be released as ""Series Six."" Sadly, although vague promises have been proffered that more spin-offs may someday be made, this is the last venture for the superb duo of Kevin Whately as Detective Inspector Robert Lewis, and Laurence Fox as D.S. James Hathaway. The series balances their relationship, each with his own strengths, no egos running amuck. Kevin Whately brings depth and drollery to his characterization of the widowed Lewis, whilst Laurence Fox as Hathaway adds wry humor as an ex-seminarian with issues of his own. Fox is gifted with a remarkable voice that would not go amiss in other ventures. Clare Holman as Dr. Laura Hobson adds another rich dimension with her elegant intelligence. Rebecca Front is great as the formidable ""Mum,""  Chief Superintendent Innocent. Of course, it's a treat to meander through Oxford's beautifully filmed spires, cobbled streets, and nearby countryside. The tensions between upper-class academics and regular citizens of Oxford are examined.

Each of the three episodes is feature-length, total running time is approximately 266 minutes; English subtitles; but no Specials! The three episodes:

Down Among the Fearful
Cramped in rooms in his Oxford college with his wife and baby, psychology student Reuben Beatty leads a double life, moonlighting as a psychic. He hopes to make more money for his young family, but these aspirations are dashed when he is found mysteriously murdered after a session; his wife has no idea what her husband has been up to. Lewis and Hathaway investigate the world of psychic mediums in Oxford, not all is easily explained through rational means. Meanwhile, Dr. Laura Hobson subtlety seems to recognize that her feelings for the kind and jocular Lewis have deepened.

The Ramblin' Boy
All goes awry after a party at a local big-shot's (Peter Davison) mansion. At the mortuary, bodies appear to be getting mixed-up, whilst an old philandering colleague of D.I. Lewis, Chief Superintendent Martin Cornish, has gone missing. The narrative expands from the environs of Oxford, to Bosnia. The best part of this is that it shows Hathaway off on a ""sabbatical,"" searching for meaning by volunteering in poverty-stricken areas. One story-thread follows a suspicious female professor who has a bad history with men, who is overly obsessed with the girlfriend of another suspect, the ""ramblin' boy,"" who is failing university. His father has serious booze issues, and was present at the party that started the mystery. The relationship between Laura and Robbie deepens, over delicious take-out.

Intelligent Design
Beautifully filmed, in a loving ode to Oxford, this last mystery resolves loose threads; it's s worthy send-off. We're back in traditional Morse/Lewis habitat now, with power-hungry Oxford Dons, gleaming science laboratories, and voraciously ambitious students. A man is released from prison, soon to meet a grisly end. Turns out he is a highly accomplished Oxford scientist who thoroughly disliked his holier-than-thou wife, and that he had killed a young girl in a drunk driving accident. In true ""Lewis"" style, a la Morse, during construction, a dessicated body is found in the Church attic where the murdered man's wife is Reverend. Meanwhile, Lewis considers retirement, in order to spend more time with his family and on his relationship with Dr. Hobson. Hathaway is disgusted by his own growing cynicism towards all suspects. All concludes at a familiar table at a pub, with pints at sunset. Enjoy!

If only there were a Special, with interviews, to follow this up ...",1367280000,96,3672,5.23639455782313
5296340,5,B009AF5OY8,"Lewis is one of the few `must see' offerings on TV these days so it is so sad that it appears that Season 6 will also be the last. When this series was announced, Laurence Fox (Hathaway) said that there would be no more and stated that both he and Kevin Whately (Lewis) now wanted to pursue other interests. There are just three stories in this series whereas there have normally been four. However, in a break with the previous custom, each is split into two parts.

It is hard to believe that the character of Lewis was introduced in the long running Morse series as long ago as 1986! The chemistry between Morse and Lewis was an obviously significant factor in the success of that series, just as Lewis and Hathaway complement each other in Lewis and the relationship has grown as time has gone on. It is hard to imagine Lewis without Hathaway in the same way that it was hard to imagine Morse without Lewis.

The stories in this series are interesting and well thought out and the plots are quite varied. Down Among the Fearful involves a psychic who has been murdered, in Ramblin' Boy a corpse is discovered which has an interesting background (the corpse not the person) and finally in Intelligent Design, a man is released from prison after serving time for causing death by dangerous driving but it appears that not everyone has forgiven or forgotten his crime. Interesting developments in Lewis' personal life too!

We are up to 27 episodes of Lewis (not quite as many as the 33 Morse managed), and we often watch the earlier ones as they are a joy to revisit. It does rather look as though that is going to be it, and the end of the last episode did have a certain finality about it. However, we can only hope that those involved do have a change of heart.  Incidentally Season 6 is known as Series 7 in the UK so if you see that advertised it is one and the same thing and contains the same episodes - the Brits have not sneakily added another series without telling anyone about it!",1365897600,270,1994,4.439890710382514
5296341,5,B009AF5OY8,The interplay between Lewis and Hathaway is always wonderul to watch!  Though with all the murders at Oxford during Morse's time and now Lewis' it's a wonder there're are any students and faculty left.,1362960000,,201,4.911764705882353
5296342,5,B009AF5OY8,"Lewis is a great series - one of the best on offer.  However potential buyers of this particular set should be aware that the episodes are The Soul of Genius, Generation of Vipers, Fearful Symmetry and The Indelible Stain.  Although these were Series 6 in the UK, they were issued as Season 5 in North America.

Additionally these are Region 2 DVDs which will not play for you unless you either have a Region 2 DVD player or a Region Free player.

However, a good piece of news is that Series 7 has just finished airing in the UK so should be appearing in North America soon, presumably as Season 6.  Sadly it looks as though this will be the last of Lewis.",1360281600,14,657,4.308943089430894
5296343,3,B009AF5OY8,"We ordered this item because we had previously purchased an all region DVD player from Amazon. However, when we tried to watch ""Lewis"" we learned that the DVD player that was sent to use could be used to play region 1 DVD's only. Also, when we tried to ""open"" the door to insert the DVD into the machine, it would not oblige us either when we used the button on the remote or on the front panel of the DVD player.",1358035200,,413,4.111111111111111

5296481,5,B009AF5OY8,Lewis is old school and Hathaway is old and new school. Early on the viewer can't be sure of their relationship but you soon get comfortable with their feelings for each other. The acting is outstanding and picking out guest stars from other series is fun. Photography is wonderful and Oxford shows its history and majesty in the very best light. Watching Hathaway mature is a delight as he begins his tongue in-cheek  comments that catch Lewis off guard. The only sad aspect is understanding that both stars had grown tired of the rigors of doing this wonderful series and the last episode really was the end.,1476662400,,610,4.700934579439252

5296486,5,B009AF5OY8,"I loved Inspector Morse and now that Lewis is the boss he's absorbed the sleuthing chops of his mentor. He also has his own sergeant now, James Hathaway. Hathaway is Cambridge-educated (Morse was Oxford-educated) and picks up the thread of erudite quotations and musings that Morse was so famous for. Hathaway also Lewis' more posh, better-educated emissary to the dons in the ivory tower that are often enmeshed in their murder investigations. Lewis, though, is more human, more vulnerable, and yet somehow tougher than Morse ever was. He's a widower and he has children and he is moored to the world in the way that makes Lewis an even richer show than Morse. I was so bummed when I ran through season 7. I hope we get one more season.",1476316800,,737,4.676923076923077

Here's a fun tip:  if you are ever in England, go to Oxford and take one of the Inspector Morse tours (led by a tour guide or try the route on your own --- there are various websites that will lay it out for you).  It's so much fun to sit in one of the pubs you recognize from the series & drink a pint with your friends.

5296844,5,B009AF5OY8,"I love everything about Inspector Lewis. The plots are rich, challenging and fun with references from classical literature and music. The personal tete-a-tete between Lewis and Hathaway enrich the storyline and often very funny.  The only negative: British accents sometimes require hands- on-the-remote-control to replay so you can follow the plot or catch the joke. Alternatively, you can google the plot summary and synopsis, with or without spoilers, on PBS.org. You can also google the script word -for-word on TV.Ark.com.  Any extra work is worth the effort to fully enjoy this brilliant show!",1454976000,,599,5.43010752688172

5296855,4,B009AF5OY8,"Excellent mysteries as usual for this series.

Very clean, if you like mysteries, and want to watch a movie without foul language or too much gory blood, these are the type of movies you would enjoy.  They are thrilling in the sense that you are kept wondering who the murderer is, and sometimes very surprised!  Inspector Lewis, Hathaway, Laura and Chief Innocent are outstanding actors.",1454198400,,443,4.945945945945946

5296914,5,B009AF5OY8,"This is a great series.  The characters are real and believable, showing their weaknesses as well as their cunning ability to solve crime.  Probably, the most impressive factor in the success of this series is the casting of Kevin Whately and Lawrence Fox as Inspector Lewis and Detective Sergeant Hathaway, along with Forensics Investigator, Laura Hobson, played by Clare Holman.  The setting of the series is historic Oxford University in England, which is a real bonus for those of us who have little opportunity to experience the revered institution.  The interaction between characters is superb and so essential for each storyline.",1447718400,,637,5.2772277227722775

Knowing what I know about that season this one, highlighting Lewis wanting to get out before he becomes his mentor, and Hathaway teetering on the edge of that abyss without being aware of it moves this season along beautifully toward what happens in the next season.

Whately and Laurence Fox play off each other very well functioning as a seamless unit. Clare Holman and Rebecca Front round out the excellent cast. Must see for fans of British mystery series.",1446249600,,521,4.663043478260869

5296951,5,B009AF5OY8,"Lewis and Hathaway usually get around to solving the crime; it's true...but, it's the details and  the complexities of their lives and  relationships that are far more compelling stories about the human condition and cheers to them for that!",1445558400,,241,5.153846153846154
5296952,3,B009AF5OY8,I would not make an effort to watch this show.  The plots are increasingly laboured and  ludicrous.  The Oxford colleges are gorgeous,1445558400,,133,4.954545454545454

We totally enjoy British Drama, Mystery, Crimes, Comedies.  They use far more believable stars and plots and not so much ""fake"" everything.  The British entertainment community knows how refreshing it is to see actors who are not beautiful, perfect people.  Their stars actually have a wart or a pimple on their faces sometimes and their hair is often messed  up and the scenes you see are more realistic and believable.

As far as I'm concerned, there was never a boring moment in any of these TV shows.  My wife and I didn't watch Morse or Lewis when they were originally broadcast.  We watched Morse on Netflix, then we bought the entire series of Inspector Lewis on Amazon.  We binge-watched Lewis in record time.  We just couldn't stop watching.  It is a great, great show.

UPDATE: Sad News
Season Eight will be the final season of Inspector Lewis.
[see the Comment dated November 3, 2015 for the official announcement]
Final total:
Inspector Morse = 33 Episodes (with Sergeant Lewis)
Inspector Lewis = 33 Episodes (the final six shared with Inspector Hathaway)
Actor Kevin Whately played the same role for 28 years (1987-2015).
-----------------------------------------------------------
My original review:

The following discussion uses the American season numbers. *
It looked like Inspector Lewis had finally had it after Season Six.
Pity.
In the final episode, Inspector Robert Lewis announced his retirement from the Thames Valley Police Force,
and Sergeant James Hathaway announced that he was leaving the force entirely (precluding a possible sequel).
That's where this box leaves off.

Surprise.
At the start of Season Seven, Superintendent Innocent finds herself short-staffed.
She asks Robert Lewis to consider coming back part-time to help out.
The prime beneficiary of his help turns out to be the newly appointed Inspector James Hathaway.
A bit far-fetched, but I love it!

SERIES OVERVIEW:
For the past thirty years, Oxford University has averaged a murder a week. Shocking.
Actor Kevin Whately (born 1951) has played the same character - Sergeant, then Inspector Robert Lewis - from age 36 through age 64 and counting.

-- a) Inspector Morse, aired 1987-2000 (his Sergeant = D.S. Robert Lewis)
following Morse's death, Sergeant Lewis was promoted to Inspector.

-- b) Inspector Lewis, aired 2006-present (his Sergeant = D.S. James Hathaway)
following Lewis's retirement, Sergeant Hathaway was promoted to Inspector.

-- c) Inspector Hathaway doesn't have his own series [yet] because Inspector Lewis, bored with retirement, came back part-time in Season Seven.
A slightly resentful Inspector Hathaway now shares the 'Inspector Lewis' series with Inspector Lewis.
Together they share Sergeant Lizzie Maddox.

Season Eight of Inspector Lewis:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inspector-Lewis-Season-8-Blu-ray/dp/B01DGNBHS6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inspector Lewis: Season 8 [Blu-ray</a>] **
I wouldn't object to Season One of ""Inspector Hathaway"", but I do hope Kevin Whately sticks it out for two more years to celebrate his Thirtieth Anniversary as Lewis.

BUYING OPTIONS:
[hint: for ease of navigation, read the review through to the end, then come back and click on the links.]

When Inspector Lewis was first broadcast on PBS 'Masterpiece Mystery', the episodes were cut by ten to fifteen minutes.
The earliest DVD releases were of the cut version, but since then all seven series have been released in America in their uncut form
Seasons 4-7 are also available on Blu-Ray.
Seasons 1-3 are only on DVD.
The easiest way to make certain you are getting the uncut UK version of the early seasons is to buy this inexpensive 17 DVD box, which takes you to the end of Season Six.
All episodes are uncut, wide-screen and have subtitles + there is a ""making of"" documentary.

-- Then buy Season Seven:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Masterpiece-Mystery-Inspector-Lewis-7-Blu-ray/dp/B00MK1RA4G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Masterpiece Mystery: Inspector Lewis 7 [Blu-ray</a>] (Blu-Ray or DVD)
-- Wait till later this year to buy Season Eight. **

* The confusion in numbering is due to PBS's decision to broadcast the first three British seasons as two US seasons.
Seasons 1-7 (UK) = Seasons 1-6 (US)
 Season 8 (UK) = Season 7 (US)
 Season 9 (UK) = Season 8 (US)
There is no difference in content (at least on Blu-Ray/DVD - The PBS broadcasts are a different matter)

** Beware of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lewis-series-8-UK-import-region-2-PAL-format/dp/B00SIGHWVI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lewis series 8 [UK import, region 2 PAL format</a>]
This is not U.S. Season Eight - Everything in this box was was released as ""Season Seven"" in America.

Kevin Whately doesn't look 64 in the Inspector Lewis series, but check out his guest appearance as Inspector Don McGhee in the final episode (""Gently in the Cathedral"") of George Gently, Series Five:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/George-Gently-Series-5-Blu-ray/dp/B009EAFL1U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">George Gently, Series 5 [Blu-ray</a>]

Inspector Morse - played by John Thaw - was the first and best of modern British Police Inspectors.
He is long overdue for remastering and repackaging at a reduced price.
The 25th Anniversary set was a disappointment: Elderly video transfers, No subtitles, Expensive.

(read the review by Happy Reader dated November 11, 2012)
I only hope the upcoming Thirtieth Anniversary may bring an improvement.

And don't forget 'Endeavour', aired 2011-present.
This is a prequel to the Inspector Morse series.
Set in 1960s England, when young Detective Constable Endeavour Morse is assigned to Inspector Fred Thursday
(Morse dropped the first name after he made Inspector).

The Sgt has become the Inspector and has a younger partner (Hathaway) who is intelligent and sometimes thinks he knows it all..  The writers of these two series are excellent at creating characters who seem real.  The relationships, personalities, interactions with others and strong detective instincts are really satisfying.  There are no guns, overt violence, cussing, or any of the other components so prevalent in American police procedurals.

5297168,5,B009AF5OY8,"Superb!  Subtle change in dynamics as Hathaway becomes Detective Inspector, and Lewis is brought back as a part time Detective Inspector.  Well handled by two superb actors.  Did not appreciate the 'feminist' shading as the writers have Dr. Hobson getting rattled that Lewis is not home to cook and clean for her...it was out of character and didn't last. (This killed the new Midsomer Murders Det Barnaby for me.) Always a pleasure watching Rebecca Front trying to keep tabs on Lewis and the 'boy wonder' as she once referred to the indubitably clever Hathaway.  I like the gravitas of Hathaway - Fox really nailed the 'Divinity Student' turned cop character, and Lewis brings down to earth decency and compassion to rude people and frightful situations.  Well done, chaps - you can star in my plays any time!!!  ;)

Pretty Oxford, great music, sometimes convoluted, sometimes fanciful, always interesting plots.",1435276800,,913,5.087248322147651

Much more character development, great plotting and dialog, great acting.  Also the actors/characters look like real people, not fashion models or ""actors"".  They're not always immaculately groomed with designer wardrobes on a cashier's salary.  And the scenery is wonderful.",1434412800,,432,5.5

The interplay of the characters, the college atmosphere (i feel like I have attended Oxford University), the intricacy of the mysteries makes for a very involving and entertaining time.  Except for the occasional difficulty of understanding colloquialisms and accents not familiar to our American ears, we thoroughly enjoy it.",1433808000,,490,5.256410256410256

5297239,5,B009AF5OY8,I enjoy most of the British mystery series. Inspector Lewis is one of my favorites. The shows are well written and the actors are great. They keep me guessing which keeps me watching. This is inspired by the Inspector Morse series which I enjoyed also. Lewis was Morse's subordinate and now Lewis is in charge of his own crew.

I'm still watching these programs and enjoying them as much or more than when first viewed.  Even when Kevin Whately was the assistant to Inspector Morse, I was always pulling for Whately so was delighted when he was given his own series upon the death of the character that played Morse.  I'm also a big fan of Laurence Fox and he meshes well with Whately's personality on screen.

5297292,5,B009AF5OY8,"I have reviewed each season of Lewis from ""Season 1"" and have given it 5 stars every time. This series is well made, very well acted and just a joy to watch. As I have mentioned before, I would watch the pilot first before watching Season 1, it does give you some information not included in the first season episode. I am also at the end of the seventh season and I am sad to see it end. The UK always does an excellent job with writing and acting in any of their programs. I would also recommend starting from the beginning and following through as each season progresses, that way you are getting the little nuances between characters as time goes on. If you have enjoyed the Masterpiece mysteries in the past, this series will not disappoint.",1430697600,,746,4.413043478260869

A grand series",1428796800,,332,4.771929824561403
5297334,5,B009AF5OY8,"I think when I am done watching  all of season 6, I will have to start all over again.  The scenery, the plots and the characters make this a must watch if you are a fan of this genre.  England for as small as it is compared to the US has the most spectacular landscapes, cottages, castles and well, it is shot in and around the Oxford area - so the architecture is nothing short of spectacular.

I have loved every moment of this series.  Masterpiece showed Season 7 last year and I pray they will be adding the newer seasons 8 and then 9.  I must say that I will watch the series again even if I know who the villains are in advance.  I had the same kind of love affair with Midsomer Murders and could watch those again and again.

Great acting, beautiful rolling hills and meadows.  Seriously, I can't get enough of it.  Thanks Amazon for making most of it available for your Prime Members at no additional cost.",1428710400,,915,4.236994219653179

5297348,5,B009AF5OY8,"In retrospect, this successor to the ""Inspector Morse"" series, is an improvement, perhaps because the characters are more attractive and less full of themselves and because the story lines move more directly towards the end. The character of Lewis seems more approachable than that of Morse, while the character of Sergeant Hathaway brings back the complexity of Morse without Morse's conceit. The story lines also seem more reasonable and believable. The production technique also seems to be improved - somewhat crisper and unobtrusively polished than the earlier series.",1428192000,,573,5.5227272727272725
5297349,5,B009AF5OY8,"All the Inspector Lewis seasons are a delight and intriguing. The story lines are complex but captivating and the casting is superb. I was a fan of the Fox brothers in earlier years and think Laurence Fox is perfect in the part.  I love seeing his uncle and his father in some of the episodes. I was not familiar with Kevin Whately before his portrayal of Lewis, but have admired how he has made it his. The chemistry between Lewis and Hathaway ties everything together. I like most of the British shows.  This is perhaps the all around best series I have seen. Love the other regulars in the series too.

5297370,5,B009AF5OY8,"""LEWIS"" is the best detective show of all-time.  Set in Oxford, perfectly-cast, well-written, masterfully photographed and directed, the 27 episodes in this collection will get quite a workout in your home.  I hope you don't mind, but I refer to this show by its UK title, ""LEWIS,"" because when you buy these discs you'll be watching the full UK-length version of each episode, not the edited ""INSPECTOR LEWIS"" version shown here in the states on PBS.

The hallmarks of ""LEWIS"" are
 first-rate storytelling;
 unfailing suspense in revealing the theory of the case and the murderer's identity;
 smart and lean dialogue;
 naturalism in the depiction of characters and relationships;
 the flowering of Detective Inspector Robbie Lewis as a crime-solver in the mold of the late DCI Morse while he simultaneously becomes more like Morse in many other ways, including his disposition;
 the spiritual and professional evolution of Detective Sergeant James Hathaway;
 tremendous chemistry and ease between the lead actors, Kevin Whately (Lewis) and Laurence Fox (Hathaway), which translates onscreen into a rather nurturing father-son relationship;
 the use in every episode of actual locales in the City and University, (e.g., the detectives interview witnesses in actual dorms, professors' offices, common rooms), making the greater Oxford area and its centuries-old Universitywith its breathtaking architectureone giant indoor/outdoor ""LEWIS"" film set; and finally
 old-fashioned gumshoe police work, the kind Morse humorously loathed to perform, yet gumshoeing reminiscent of the best of ""Law & Order"" in the Lenny-Mike/Lenny-Rey years.

Lewis and Hathaway solve their cases with by-the-book leg work, keen observation, and that vaunted skill that Lewis clearly developed when he was Morse's bagman sergeant: the ability to put the puzzle pieces together.

All this is done without resorting to violence or action-film gimmicks. The typical ""LEWIS"" action scene has our detectives running from their car to the final encounter with the suspect or to some other exigent circumstance. The rarity of physical confrontations, explosions, and screeching tires is refreshing and laudable. The total absence of suspects' rights violations and gunfire exchanges is something I wish American cop shows would emulate.

Mrs. Bookman and I have watched this entire collection four timesall 27 ""LEWIS"" episodes in chronological order, although we freely cherry-pick our favorite episodes here and there for additional viewings.  I've probably seen the ""Series Pilot"" and ""The Quality of Mercy"" (Season 2) half a dozen times apiece; and seen ""Counter Culture Blues"" (Season 3),""The Dead of Winter"" (Season 3), ""The Gift of Promise"" (Season 4), ""The Soul of Genius"" (Season 5), ""Generation of Vipers"" (Season 5), and ""The Ramblin' Boy"" (Season 6) eight to ten times apiece. Each afternoon when we're not travelling, Mrs. Bookman and I have our tea and watch at least one episode of ""LEWIS"" (we own this collection plus the Season 7 Blu-ray) or ""ENDEAVOUR"" (we own every episode on Blu-ray) or ""INSPECTOR MORSE"" (we watch it online).  Just a few days ago we watched ""Intelligent Design,"" the last episode in this collection.  (We then re-watched Season 7 on Blu-ray, finishing last night.  Now, it's on/back to ""ENDEAVOUR."")

As Hathaway's guv'ner might put it, ""LEWIS"" is the best telly in years.  And what better way to enjoy the episodes of your choice anytime you want than by owning the discs.  I have streamed HD episodes of ""LEWIS"" on Amazon Prime.  (Seasons 4 through 6 are currently available in HD.) But when the interwebs are busy or my cable company can't be bothered to provide sufficient uninterrupted broadband width, the DVDs come in handy.  They give me more control over my options; my Blu-ray/DVD player is more responsive than streaming video to the remote control; and when our high-speed-cable internet connection lets us down, we get a clearer image from the DVDs than we get from the low-def streaming video.

I give ""LEWIS"" my highest recommendation.  I wish I could give it 6 stars.  Or 10.",1427500800,4,4096,5.310077519379845

Might watch this one again sometime; there are others that, now we have seen them, shall eliminate from our list.
It would be interesting some time to know just how your lists are put together - who does the choosing...

I really like Inspector Lewis' skepticism and Inspector Hathaway's unconventional but sincere Christian faith.  It is wonderful when the proud towers of Oxford get knocked over by Hathaway, a humble copper who also happens to be an impeccably educated Cambridge man. Nearly every episode tells a compelling and complex story - richly filmed and skillfully directed.  I notice that the filmmakers try very hard to keep the camera angles fresh and interesting.

What sets this series apart is what set its predecessor, Morse, apart--its combination of interesting main characters and fascinating, generally unpredictable plot twists that keep you engaged to the closing credits.  Oxford, itself, plays a leading role, too,--both the utter beauty of the city and its renowned university and the way it provides academic characters of all stripes to enhance the plot lines.  Great cast, impeccable character development, smart writing, wonderful plots, beautiful scenery and even lovely music.  What's not to love?  Lewis is my favorite everyman sleuth; Hathaway is as smart as Lewis is instinctive.  And Dr. Hobson and Chief Supt. Innocent are perfect, too. A series for adults who like to be drawn into complex and compelling stories well and beautiful told and acted.",1424390400,,931,5.292517006802721

5297514,5,B009AF5OY8,Inspector Lewis is my favorite British Cop show to date.  Season 6 is on par with the previous seasons.  Highly recommended if you like cop shows that make you think and don't have unnecessary violence.  Start with season 1.,1424390400,,224,4.6923076923076925

5297539,5,B009AF5OY8,"Gave this as a gift to my girl.  she loves British stuff.  It's Kool, cause I get to watch'em whenever!  and she loves me for them.
These shows are well done with a up beat sense of life and a little humor and only some altruism.  Rational and clean cut (like in the 50's & 60's).  If you're looking for blood & guts, stay away!  These are real who-done-its and no side show to distract from the main plot!
Enjoy!  If you want a real treat, get the matching books and double your pleasure.

Lol! I love how Lewis and Hathaway are able to hold their own when the elitists look down their noses at them! And the number of women these two pass up! Who'd have thought these two could be such chick magnets! Only complaint, the music gets incredibly loud unless you watch the DVDs on a TV that has extra speakers. Not a big deal if you have the remote handy.",1421107200,,540,4.41
5297543,5,B009AF5OY8,"I love the Inspector Lewis series.

But I have to say I'm vexed by Dr Hobson's apparent slip of the tongue in S6E2. One moment she says someone was poisoned with a combination of PCP, methanol, and embalming fluid, but about a half minute later she calls it a combination of alcohol (methanol is an alcohol, we're good there), embalming fluid and Diazepam (aka Valium). PCP and Diazepam are very, very different drugs. In fact, the latter is sometimes used for relaxing those intoxicated on the 'animal tranquilizer,' PCP.

Just sayin'.

PS... I think it goes without saying how amusing it is that every few weeks the series' locale, Oxfordshire -- where (in the real world) there's a murder about once ever 3 or 4 years -- erupts into an orgy of murder and mayhem. Don't EVER change that.",1421020800,,789,4.661870503597123

I miss the days of the 30' and 40's when our mystery writers wrote mysteries that were hard to figure out and not what the majority of our writers are like no. I usually can figure out who done it in the first or second chapter the rest is everybody playing musicle beds. The British have brought back the mystery like it used to be, Ins[ector Lewis and Morse and Frost and Agatha Christie and many more are well worth the time to watch or read.",1420502400,,578,4.361111111111111

5297637,5,B009AF5OY8,"We really enjoy this series. We became aware of it after seeing it on PBS. We enjoyed the Inspector Morse series and when John Thaw who played Morse died they made the Inspector Lewis series. Kevin Whatley who played Detective Sergeant Lewis on Morse became Inspector Lewis on the new series. Jon Laurence plays detective Sergeant Hathaway. Both good actors with interesting plot lines making ""who-done-it"" difficult to figure out in advance, even when we have seen the particular episode before. Chalk that up to bad memory! My wife and I both use wireless headphones when listening to British programs. It makes the dialogue much easier to understand. I recommend the 900 MHZ wireless headphones, not the infra red type. Amazon has many quality sets. Since we bought a newer and faster wireless router we have been able to watch a full 90 minute episode without any stops for buffering. I really like the way Amazon Prime darkens the programs we have already seen.

I really hate that Masterpiece Mystery hacks the shows apart so they can have time for their non-commercial commercials.  In this age of worldwide social media, that is no longer acceptable.  The fans from all countries talk to each other and those of us in the US quickly discover what scene is missing or butchered.",1413417600,29,539,4.36

Lewis and Hathaway play excellent counterparts and through the series the characterizations become stronger and more personal.

For those looking for a well-crafted police drama that features compelling characters (including Oxford university itself), please watch all 6 seasons of Lewis as quickly as you can.

Other reviewers have talked about the superb quality, not only of the acting but the casting, so I feel no need to rehash the details.  I'm more interested in the characters proper. Lewis is an archetypal father figure-crusty, defensive, and living with the sorrow of his wife's death with a quiet dignity that those who have suffered loss can appreciate. Hathaway is struggling with all the things that people of his generation do-faltering faith, a job that consumes you, and maintaining humanity in a career that strips it from you.  Oxford, both university and town, also plays a vital role. For those raised in smaller towns, or around universities, you will immediate recognize the gossip, power struggles, and sense of community http only happens in small towns and looms large over its inhabitants.

I cannot wait for seasons 7 and 8 (hint, hint Amazon) to join the Prime queue. That's almost worth my entire membership right there.",1406073600,,1301,5.032558139534884

Kevin Whately is very amusing as Lewis, and you will love the serious Laurence Fox as his partner, Hathaway- they constantly ""rib"" each other and there are many funny lines which provide comic relief to the serious cases.
These characters have great chemistry, and there is a love story also with Lewis and Dr. Laura Hobson, and they finally hook up in the last show, after much 'will they or won't they', involving a very sweet romance.  I think I clapped when they finally got together.
The show is very intelligent and has the amazing backdrop of Oxford, I feel smarter for just watching the show.  If you have read my reviews, I say that ""Sherlock"" is the 'bar none' for Masterpiece, but this show is very good too.",1405814400,,849,4.529411764705882

When they first started it on the heels of Morse, we were both kind of gritting our teeth thinking, ""Oh lord, not another ghastly spin-off to make money off the popularity of a decent show!""
But surprisingly, we discovered that it had maybe a bit more teeth than the original but it was still the same great writing and depth of it as well.
So I write this for the both of us when I say we wish there were more shows written and done with this much care. Call us old fashioned and stuck in our ways but seriously? They really Don't make'em like this any more and it's a crying shame.",1405036800,,692,4.1716417910447765

5298170,5,B009AF5OY8,"As with the rest of the stories about Morse or Lewis, this entire run of many episodes from ITV and Masterpiece (PBS) is top notch. It will be missed, as the gentleness and humanistic attitudes of Lewis and Hathaway are a peek into how any of us would handle such roles on a police force. The interaction of these characters is almost as legendary and just as warm and thoughtful as was the relationship between Morse and Lewis. I find the final scene of Lewis and Hathaway sitting next to the water and the boats gliding by, each sipping from pints of ale most appealing and indicative of how each may have felt seeing their characters leave the Oxford police force. I wonder if each actor had some mixed feelings in this scene. It was not only the end of their character's employment with the police, but also the end of the program with each going off on their own to continue their careers in other ""endeavours"" (pun intended).

As a lead-in to the newest peek into this world of police work in Oxford, we now have ""Endeavour"" to satisfy our interest in the characters since it was Morse who began it all... he was assigned Lewis as his DS and then the Morse episodes and long-running program began to pique our interests and grip us with great stories and productions and acting.

I was expecting the traditional Morse Code theme at the very end of the last episode of ""Lewis"", but it sadly never occurred.

I am sure that everyone involved in all of the Morse/Lewis productions were sad to not only see John Thaw pass away, but to see the end to each program. They had a great run and should be very proud of their work as it will live on for a very long time.

All this being said, I just now learned of new seasons for ""Inspector Lewis"". While this is great news, it is hard to imagine how the production team were able to arrive at a process of keeping these characters on the police force, especially since each character had been so vocal on moving onto another phase of their lives. So... onto Series 7 & 8 and beyond... I cannot wait to see these on PBS here in the States. If you are confused, it appears the programs are labelled differently for Amazon. I will need to check this out, as in reality, it appears that what is listed as Season 6 (which this last episode is a part of) could actually be Season 7. Off to play detective, I guess. :-)

AHA!! Amazon (and/or PBS) have restructured the seasons so there are more episodes in many of the middle years. Thus, 6 season, not 7. It appears that Season 8 is on its way, with production having begun earlier this year, in March. I suspect it will air on ITV and PBS sometime later this year or 2015.

5298184,5,B009AF5OY8,"This series is consistently stellar.  The characters are well defined and the plots are well thought out.  My only complaint is that both season five and season six are too short.  Four shows, three shows?  However, if that's what it takes to keep the quality up, then I'll get over it.  Definitely worth watching.",1403913600,,314,4.7407407407407405
5298185,5,B009AF5OY8,"One of the reasons I love this series is because of the interaction between down-to-earth Inspector Lewis and mysterious, high-brow Sgt. Hathaway. The back-drop of Oxford University is another reason. I'd love to visit its hallowed halls. My last reason for loving this series is the well-written plot, character development, and dialogue. I've watched the entire series several times and continue to enjoy it. British dramas, in general, are not afraid to come to an end. This series ends right when it should.",1403827200,,511,5.168674698795181

5298190,4,B009AF5OY8,"This is a very good series.  It shows how policeman are humans in their investigation into the world of crime.  this is done without all the blood and mayhem as other shows depict the acts of evil people.  The actors and actresses are great and the plots are believable. All this is to th3 credit of Kevin Whately and Lawrence Fox.  Hate to see the end of the series.  Does the DI retire and the DS resign?  That is the question that is not answered.

5298192,5,B009AF5OY8,A good English police show. Inspector Lewis and Detective  Hathaway shows a human side to police work that most series do not show but they do find the culprits with some help with the coroner. It is a show I can watch more than once.,1403308800,,234,4.2

5298194,4,B009AF5OY8,"This sequel to Morse sees Lewis carrying on the torch in a delightful way. Down to earth and lacking his mentor's snootiness, the standard of his acting and that of his sidekick is maintained at a high level. Colin Drexter's script is as tight and bewildering as ever and this box set is highly recommended for viewers who enjoy drama that twists and turns with atmospheric Oxford as a backdrop.",1403222400,3,395,4.6571428571428575
5298195,5,B009AF5OY8,"I love the Inspector Lewis series simply because I love Kevin Whately! I've loved the Lewis character since he appeared with Morse. Lewis is not a smart-ass cop, he is an every man cop. The supporting cast for this show is also great. Hathaway, Innocent and Hobson are so great to watch. The stories are sometimes complicated but are very interesting!
I can't wait until the next series start this fall. Highly recommended!!",1403222400,,424,4.821917808219178

5298213,4,B009AF5OY8,"I never liked Inspector Morris, but I watched it because I like BBC mysteries. I always thought he dissed Lewis and treated him poorly.
Lewis took it incredibly well and his treatment of Hathaway is exemplary. This is a good series and I'm glad the producers changed their mind and brought if back for the fall of 2014.",1402358400,2,319,4.517241379310345

5298217,5,B009AF5OY8,"The Inspector Lewis series relies on brains and good writing rather than special effects and shock & gore. There are always twists and turns. It is a mystery that could keep you guessing until the end.  At times it moves slowly, walking you through the process of solving the murder rather than pummeling you through unrealistic scenarios.",1402185600,,339,4.947368421052632

5298221,3,B009AF5OY8,"This series is OK. I like Kevin Whately and Laurence Fox but the actress who plays the pathologist (Clare Holman) drives me crazy. She's just so boring! I wish Lewis had met someone else after his wife died. The views of the city of Oxford are always stunning but I find the stories a little hard to believe. Oh for the days of the grumpy and ill-tempered Morse... The best episode so far is the one where Lewis finds out who killed his beloved wife. Laurence Fox's acting in that episode must be seen to be believed: it's unsurpassed by anything I've ever seen. Season 3, Episode 2 ""The Quality of Mercy"".",1402012800,,606,4.419642857142857

British programs are interesting; have a twist to them - unpredictable.  American programs all about sex and drugs - who the hell wants to watch that stuff - just turn on the news then.  Please!!!!

I wish AMAZON would carry Spanish, Danish and more European ""novelas"" and programs.  Far superior to the crap being fed to us by Hollywood.

HOW DO I ACCESS FOREIGN MOVIES????  I AM GLAD I HAVE NETFLIX TOO - THEY ARE BETTER AT THIS THAN AMAZON.

But then, enter Lewis! Better then Poirot, Miss Marple, Midsomer Murders (I cannot believe I am saying this!). No wonder I was hugely disappointed when the news the series was ending hit tabloids... ""Actors wanted more time to work on other projects"" was the official explanation. Imagine my joy then, when reports came out of new episodes being filmed starting March of this year (2014)... I am keenly watching Amazon UK for the newest DVD set (there is such a long lag before anything from UK hits our US shores... ghrrr). Reviews in Europe were very good and I could not help myself but get a brief overview of the ""action"", though I will not spoil it here for you. Suffice to say, Hathaway is back!

5298261,5,B009AF5OY8,"Great series, if only US television could be so good!  ITV has recycled their performers superbly for another winner.  Wish the series would continue.",1400544000,,150,5.208333333333333
5298262,5,B009AF5OY8,A really well done and enjoyable murder mystery.  They always have a very seemingly disjointed beginning where you see a lot of different people and scenarios which can confuse you. But really that is part of the enjoyment in the show. Nothing is given up too obvious in this show. The relationships are also well done and give a depth of character to them which is really good. We are wondering if there is anyone still alive in Oxford!,1400544000,,437,4.531645569620253
5298263,5,B009AF5OY8,"I love Inspector Lewis, even though I was not a fan of Inspector Morse.  His down-to-earth personality meshes well with Sergeant Hathaway's educated and sophisticated take on things, and the mysteries are, indeed, mysterious, with plenty of possible suspects.",1400457600,,259,5.641025641025641

5298265,5,B009AF5OY8,I think my favorite part of the Inspector lewis series is the writers ability to foreshadow enough without giving away the ending. I am really good at guessing the murderer but I have to say I have been wrong in my assumptions. This and the wonderful back story the are able to add to this mystery series keeps me glued to the television. I love everything British and mysterious.,1400371200,,380,4.521739130434782
5298266,5,B009AF5OY8,"Lewis and Hathaway are the perfect foils for each other. Playing off their particular skills and personalities they not only solve the crimes but provide excellent entertainment for the viewer. I recall the pub garden scene, overlooking the river, in the last Morse episode when Lewis and Morse accept that their time together is finished. Lewis and Hathaway recreate this scene in a wonderful and poignant way. If you liked Morse and the earlier Lewis episodes, then you will love this collection.",1400284800,,498,5.085365853658536

5298271,5,B009AF5OY8,"My wife and I did enjoy the suspense and drama, it seemed to be well thought out. The only question we had was why did most shows have three murders?",1400198400,,149,4.0

5298284,5,B009AF5OY8,"Good characters and stories based on the Inspector Morse character Sargent Lewis (also played by Kevin Whately).  I much prefer this series to ""Inspector Morse.""  The detectives are well matched, and the Oxford scenes are attractive.  Highly recommend this series!",1399852800,,264,5.55
5298285,5,B009AF5OY8,I was a big fan of Morse when I lived back home so was thrilled when this series was released. I've lived in America for 20 years but I was born and raised in Oxford and so not only do I have an affinity for all things British but I love this show because of all the familiar locations where it's filmed.  More importantly the actors and storylinea are great!!!,1399852800,,361,4.1571428571428575

When I want good, clean, light drama that has a bright story line, and also has beautiful scenery and amiable characters this is my ""go-to"" series.

5298291,5,B009AF5OY8,This award winning show has only one major drawback: Not enough episodes. It leaves me wanting more ...more...more.

5298292,5,B009AF5OY8,"for me, it makes a difference that there is a relationship between working people...and these two are good together, the younger fellow actually weighing what the older, more experienced detective, shares!

5298296,5,B009AF5OY8,This sequel to Inspector Morris is outstanding. I love the way Lewis and Hathaway develop as characters over the run of the show. I miss them already--so I will just have to watch them again!,1399334400,,191,4.485714285714286

5298306,5,B009AF5OY8,"This was an easy series to watch.  The murder mystery part of the show was deep enough you couldn't figure it out in the first 15 minutes, and the personal lives of the detectives didn't overcome the show.",1398729600,,205,4.394736842105263

The interplay between the characters is great, as the seasons go by we see deepening relationships and are more amused than ever by the friendly banter between the characters.

As with all of the episodes, they are well organized, written, performed (great cast of actors), and with such beautiful scenery included.  The film quality cannot be beat.  The wonderful thing about these Masterpiece programs is that we can look forward to watching quality television at its best.  Our whole family enjoyed the Inspector Lewis series..

5298327,4,B009AF5OY8,"These episodes of Masterpiece Mystery are enjoyable.  It takes a bit to tune into the British accent, but that is just me.

We liked the mysteries, even though information sufficient to figure out ""whodunit"" often doesn't appear until near the end.  We purchased this set because of the intellectual approach to the mysteries, but we have become fans because of the interaction among the four main characters.  We have enjoyed watching the growth in the relationships as the series moved forward.  There is often rather witty by play between Lewis and Hathaway, which we greatly enjoy.  With anywhere from two to four murders per episode, Oxford must be the murder capital of the civilized world.

A venture into the past and Masterpiece Theater . . . too many documentaries later there was ""Foyle's War"" as a recommendation from Amazon. One venture led to another and to six seasons with ""Inspector Lewis."" This series has a beginning and an ending . . . oh, yes, an imagination allows one to find the retired Inspector Lewis pottering about with his family and the enticing Laura. Hathaway? Unusual character with his intelligent 'Oxford' ways. One can imagine multiple scenarios for Hathaway!

Intriguing storylines with exceptional cinematology and acting. Recommended for those who enjoy this genre and perhaps as an introduction for others!

5298361,5,B009AF5OY8,When I started watching Inspector Lewis I wasn't sure if I would like this.  It was interesting to see the differences between law enforcement in America and England.  The pace really grew on me and the revelation of the characters lives and backgrounds  made me really care about what happened to them.  Loved the final bow for Laurence and Dennis.

5298368,5,B009AF5OY8,"Great show, always a good mystery with a few unexpected twists. Very little of the graphic violence and gore found in so many other shows these days. This show relies more on the story than shocking visuals. The background music is some of the best, very soothing and really beautiful; it would be good listening on its own. (One thing I cannot stand about so many other new shows and movies, both US and foreign, is the use of loud electronic background music with lots of percussion. It's annoying at best and sometimes so distracting that I won't watch the series or movie).

With Lewis, the setting at Oxford is always fascinating and the cinematography is superb. And then you have the characters: Inspector Lewis, somber and lonely for the most part, but dedicated to his work, down to earth and a deep thinker; Hathaway, tall, young and brilliant, well-educated, with a clever wit--handsome in his dorky sort of way, what's not to like! Hobson and the other characters are also always interesting and well-cast. The characters are believable.

Just can't get enough of this show and one can hope that when Lewis retires we'll have Hathaway. And one can hope also that we'll see more of the new Endeavour show, a prequel to Inspector Morse, the show that precedes Inspector Lewis. Cheers!",1396656000,,1294,4.798206278026906

I loved actors and the way the scripts were written and the way they were performed.  Whately and Fox were outstanding. The interaction between them convincingly real and warm and caring. I enjoyed the little references to Morse--very subtle.
Rebecca Front and Clare Colman were excellent in their parts.

5298438,5,B009AF5OY8,"I have in the last year or so become a series junkie. I have exhausted all of the American stuff that I can stomach and for one or two, repeated the series, before I discovered Brit TV through MI5. After a series is finished, I sometimes have a sort of emotional hole where that series had taken up space in my attention. Nothing, absolutely nothing has created the kind of hole that the end of Morse and now the end of Lewis produces. I feel as though I am on the edge of 'mourning' my loss of any more opportunities to experience these phenomenal interactions and story lines. I have no words for what exactly it is that gives these shows their power albeit some of it is the aimed for demographic which I fit. I've never really felt 'groupie' for anything except maybe my Marine Corps, but having watched the penultimate episode and facing the very last episode of Lewis, I am feeling a sadness of a level that seems absurd for a vicarious television experience, but there it is. This may just be a side effect of binging behavior but I will watch the last episode as though I were sitting at the bedside of a friend in the final asymptote to zero. Sigh. Watch this series at your own emotional risk and I will go out and look for a life. But, surely and especially if you are accustomed to American TV, Morse and Lewis, as unlikely as it will seem at first, will stealthily creep up on you and somehow reach into your heart. I haven't investigated why they stopped. Maybe Laurie (Laurence Fox's family nickname and how the hell do I know that?) wanted something different. Oh well...I suppose now I just sit around looking like a dog being shown a card trick. Enjoy...

Post apocalyptic addendum: If you think you might like Lewis (and Hathaway), do the whole thing. Watch Lewis mature as a detective under the wing of Morse first. I've watched people have this kind of, hmmm, strange experience becoming emotionally involved in some media thing but this is my first time. ""A true saga"" said in a deep, resonant voice. The depth of the writing, I suppose, but I'm not a critic nor even sure exactly what I mean by 'the depth of the writing'. Deftness of the writing works too so a choice of nuance anyway. Barrington's tonal tapestries certainly contributed. Maybe just the rush of the intense media binge, softened only by the glow of Tom Jefferson's favo(u)rite plant, watching one's life pass zoned out in front of a computer. Still, good story. Crikey, bloody good Telly there, Guv'nor.",1395619200,,2494,4.542222222222223

That is, the complete Lewis canon seen in the US to that date AND since it contains the full United Kingdom editions you see things that weren't shown during the US on air broadcasts.

5298499,5,B009AF5OY8,I love this show.  It is a good detective show with plenty of twists.  The charcters seem real as it shows their personal life struggles in addition to getting their job done.  Cant wait for the next season!,1394668800,,207,4.394736842105263

5298502,5,B009AF5OY8,I have been hooked on most BBC-PBS programming because of the excellent acting and script writing.  Most of the musical scores are extremely pleasing as well.,1394582400,,158,5.076923076923077
5298503,5,B009AF5OY8,I liked the way almost everyone is 'suspect' and the personal lives of the Inspector Lewis and his assistant are worked into the stories.,1394582400,,137,4.75
5298504,5,B009AF5OY8,"All three of the last series of Lewis are exceptionally well written, interesting stories.  The angst of his Sergeant continues unabated as he tries to decide whether to stay or to go.  At last Dr. Laura and Inspector Lewis acknowledge their fondness for each other.  How long has it been??  This series will be missed!",1394582400,,319,4.745454545454545

5298506,2,B009AF5OY8,Got tired of trying to relate to all of the side stories and non-stop effort to create suspense for everything that happens. It became not only confusing but also very boring. Would not recommend it to anyone.,1394582400,,209,4.675675675675675
5298507,5,B009AF5OY8,Superb smart detective series which never assumes the viewer is stupid and has no need to over sensationalize story lines.  Best TV out there,1394582400,,141,4.875

Too cool",1394582400,,159,4.0
5298509,5,B009AF5OY8,"Loved this series of masterful murder mysteries and the underlying stories of Lewis and Hathaway.  I was a big fan of Morse and wondered how they'd keep that going.  They succeeded.  The gentle strength of Lewis balanced with the stoic approach of Hathaway.  Beautiful moment that was so memorable goes something like: Lewis; 'Who do ye think would win between a ferret and an owl...well I reckon it'll be the guy in the well worn shoes and cheap suit...'  - I know I haven't got the words right, but when you see it you realize how wonderful Lewis truly is...a great Geordie!  The juxtaposition of what happens Lewis and what happens Hathaway leads to a thoughtful, gentle ending...",1394582400,,683,4.745762711864407

5298515,5,B009AF5OY8,Wow!!  What a great  series to watch from season one to season 6.  Enjoyed see Oxford campus and village around it.  The Englsh seem to have a different way of viewing cases and  found ti to be very stimulating.  I am doing Endeavor and I am hoping for a season 2.,1394409600,,264,4.078431372549019
5298516,5,B009AF5OY8,"Welcome back!!  What I most appreciate about the characters is that they deal with
difficult subjects with dignity and respect.  Other series have so much profanity and
'in your face' sexuality that they earn an immediate change of channel from me.
Thank you to the writers for caring enough to make this a first class production and to
the actors and directors for bringing them to life!
Thanks for giving us a show to thoroughly enjoy!!",1394409600,,438,4.75
5298517,5,B009AF5OY8,"Sadly, this is the final season of Lewis. The episodes are as good or better than previous seasons. Satisfying series ending. Sorry there won't be more. Fans of British police procedurals should definitely watch all of Lewis.",1394323200,,225,5.108108108108108
5298518,4,B009AF5OY8,"I like the subtlety of the stories and characters, at least in comparison to American TV - plus, anything with a British accent appears more significant.",1394323200,,153,4.923076923076923
5298519,4,B009AF5OY8,"I enjoyed this crime solver and the supporting characters, too!  Sometimes series run too long but this one did not.",1394323200,,116,4.8
5298520,5,B009AF5OY8,"Finally! Lewis and Laura are a couple. It was a long time coming, but worth the suspense. This is the last season on my watchlist, but I hope it isn't the end of the series. Will Hathaway really resign? Will Lewis really retire? Too many questions are left unanswered. There has to be more seasons of this great series. I am too hooked for it to be the end. Masterpiece Theater has some of the best shows on TV. I will keep watching in hopes of seeing all my favorites again.",1394236800,,475,4.230769230769231
5298521,4,B009AF5OY8,This series always has you guessing which clue is the correct clue.  And the contrast between characters helps maintai one's interest,1394236800,,133,5.333333333333333

5298523,5,B009AF5OY8,"Giving Lewis his full due, finally, has made not only the former Morse series more whole, but lets us see who it was Morse was overshadowing. Robbie Lewis is a sad and lost man after his wife's sudden death and in this final season, we finally see him pull his life back together, keep from overshadowing Hathaway, the way Morse did Lewis, and see the depth of his natural police talent and his quiet strength as a man. Not to be missed, despite it's ending of the series, because it is done with great gentleness and grace.",1394236800,,524,4.412371134020619

5298525,5,B009AF5OY8,"I enjoyed Morse - and liked Lewis even more.  Not as dark, but still gripping plots and and interesting character developments.

5298526,5,B009AF5OY8,"What a great follow up to Chief Inspector Morse. Wish they had made more using the next Detective Sergeant James Hathaway or Laurence Fox. Loved Laurence Fox's acting, mannerisms, and of course Oxford.",1394150400,,201,5.121212121212121
5298527,5,B009AF5OY8,"I watched the whole series on Netflix and was so taken with these two actors I had to own the set. The quality of the set is fantastic. This is the full length UK version unlike the edited Netflix episodes. The pilot and all 27 episodes are included. I envy any of you who haven't seen this yet.

Lewis is a spin-off of Morse, of course. One might want to see Morse first - wherein you see Lewis as a sergeant before becoming an inspector. Like Morse, Lewis is set in and around Oxford.

Laurence Fox is handsome, enigmatic and a complete joy to watch. Whately, as Lewis, is so endearing I just want to ring him up and say ""thanks'. Anyone have his number?",1394150400,4,656,4.24
5298528,4,B009AF5OY8,This series is entertaining . Inspector Lewis is quite different than he was when he played as the Sargent to inspector morse. Sargent Hathaway is quite different than Morse was those years ago. Good series.,1394150400,,207,4.942857142857143
5298529,5,B009AF5OY8,"This is a wonderful delightful series about the Inspector Lewis, after he leaves Inspector Morse series.

5298531,5,B009AF5OY8,I am such the fan.  I have even watched some episodes more than once.  I love the combination of Lewis and Hathaway.  Each brings his own agenda to the table when investigating a murder.  I also enjoy the subtle relationship between Lewis and the good doctor.  Clever writing and good casting make this series a must on a mystery lover's watch list.,1394064000,,349,4.564516129032258
5298532,4,B009AF5OY8,"See my headline. Good acting, good plots, no trash. That tells you that it is BBC and not American produced.",1394064000,,108,4.45
5298533,3,B009AF5OY8,I like how these characters with opposite personalities come together and support each other.  Love how Laurence Fox character struggles with his different challenges without imploding or exploding.  Enjoyable and complex enough to watch the reruns.,1394064000,,249,5.888888888888889
5298534,4,B009AF5OY8,I very much liked the pairing of the older and younger inspector.  Their interplay was entertaining and believable.  They also dressed like real policemen unlike current American tv cops.  I'm not sure about having a BMW for a squad car.  The Brits must have more money to toss about.,1393977600,,284,4.73469387755102
5298535,5,B009AF5OY8,So sad to see this series end. It has been one of my favorite series since Inspector Morse. Kevin  Whatley  just got better with age and Laurence Fox was an awesome Lt Hathaway. Both made the episodes  very believable and enjoyable.,1393977600,,232,4.609756097560975
5298536,5,B009AF5OY8,This show is fantastic!  I like the characters and the much involved mysteries they solve in each episode.  A great follow-up to Morse.,1393977600,,135,4.826086956521739
5298537,5,B009AF5OY8,"I met Inspector Lewis a long time ago when he didn't have much rank and was learning the ropes from my dear friend Inspector Morse. It has been a natural step to follow ""Lewis"" as Morse always called him. I look forward to Season 7",1393977600,,231,4.155555555555556

5298542,5,B009AF5OY8,The writers do a spectacular job telling a story and the actors put a perfect spin in their performances.  When a brutal murder has occurred they do not over emote with horror yet always give a believable measure of compassion and humanity.,1393977600,,240,4.714285714285714

5298544,5,B009AF5OY8,"I enjoy a good detective series, and I consider this one of the best. I rewatched the series from Season 1 through Season 6 over a few week's time this winter. I was struck by the development of the main characters. A good detective story can hold my attention until the puzzle is solved. A good series can hold my attention through the growth of the central characters. Both Lewis and Hathaway grew in ways that were entirely understandable, given their backstories and the events of these six seasons. As Season 6 drew to a close, I realized I had fallen in love with these characters almost as though they were my own dear friends or colleages. I found myself hoping they would call, email, or post a note on a social networking site from time to time just to let me know how they are doing.

I recommend this series to anyone who enjoys watching a good mystery and to anyone who wants a good lesson in plot and character development.",1393891200,,937,4.4476744186046515

5298553,5,B009AF5OY8,"I've been a fan of this show, along with Inspector Morse before it, for many years. Season 6 continues the high quality that is the hallmark of the show. The scripts, plots and actors are top notch and pull you into the action. The character development continues to be excellent. I was upset when Inspector Morse ended but Inspector Lewis took up the standard and continues my happy addiction.",1393632000,,394,4.72463768115942
5298554,5,B009AF5OY8,"I really enjoy Inspector Lewis.  It always has good themes, there is not too much violence, exploding cars, blood horror. It is just good old fashioned intelligent detective work and a look into people issues.",1393632000,,209,4.9714285714285715

5298559,4,B009AF5OY8,This has been an excellent series better than Morse I think. One or two of the final episodes were a bit convoluted so I didn't give it 6 stars. Still excellent but when the the scripts start to wobble it is time to end on a high note. Still can't get my head around the lovely Laura falling for Lewis she was too sexy for him!! (Obviously his personality!),1393545600,,357,4.188405797101449
5298560,5,B009AF5OY8,I absolutely love British mystery series and when Inspector Morse morphed into Inspector Lewis I was happily surprised with the expansion. The dry reserved educated observations presented by Hathaway play nicely off of the street wise every day guy of Lewis. I can not get enough of these two and it looks like the series is ending.,1393459200,,332,4.842105263157895

5298564,5,B009AF5OY8,Only one fault this is the end of the line. For this fine series. If you enjoyed other episodes you will of course enjoy these. One thing that has always surprised me about the UK series is the quality of the writing.,1393372800,,217,4.190476190476191

The mysteries are very well done, and I think Colin Dexter would be proud to have spawned this spinoff of Morse.

Its all about guns, bigger guns, more powerful guns, blood spatter from gunshot wounds. What does this tell our kids?  Yes there is crime but the Brits get into charecters, motive, getting into the killers mind.  Lewis allows us to understand the who, what, where, when, and how of the crime. We get to solve the crime with them, interviewing persons of interest, getting to know background story, be a part of it. YES, this is intellegent TV, for those who might actually read the books that go along with the series.  Yes I said it, read a book, scary stuff!

This intelligent spin-off from the ""Inspector Morse"" series is even better than its source. The acting, the locations, and especially the story-lines are exquisite.

This is well worth the money and a bargain on Amazon, just the thing to keep me going during a long, intolerable winter. . .Lewis, Hathaway and a big bowl of popcorn, can't beat it!  The only ""quirky"" comment I have is that (at least for me) I have to pay a little more attention to the dialogue, for some reason it sounds more ""Brit"" to me than when I'm watching the U.S. version on public television, but by no means is it a problem.

I watched several of the Inspector Lewis seasons, and then I clicked on  'Season 6' - I now realize that the screen did not state that it was free for Prime users, but I also feel that it did not adequately warn me that I was not entering 'Pay per View' space.  I would have hoped that some sort of more explicit 'check' would have alerted me to the fact that I  would be paying for this season.

Inspector Lewis is great as always. The interplay between Lewis and Hathaway remained the high point. Hathaway's increasing disenchantment with police work was well developed through the series. The only problem with this set is that it will take a good story line to get to Season 7 (??). Ending with Lewis retiring and Hathaway quitting the force doesn't leave much opening for new episodes.",1391299200,,429,5.128571428571429

are episodes worthy of repeat viewing, with a pretty good good chance that there are complexities of character, plot, events and

I started watching Inspector Lewis years ago and just noticed the other day new seasons had been posted. I was thrilled! I enjoy the banter between Lewis and Hathaway. I like the Oxford setting. I feel smarter just watching. The film quality is also good. It's great to see British cinematography become competitive.

similar format as the original, set in the gorgeous

5298704,3,B009AF5OY8,"I have never believed that Kevin Whately's character, Lewis, had enough depth and substance to carry a series and this last season bore that out, again.  Lewis was a great ""regular guy"" foil to Morse's brooding, self absorbed, albeit highly intelligent (and therefore interesting) persona, but there was no depth to Lewis's character then and there's no depth to it now, no matter how hard the writers try to impregnate it with references to his wife being murdered and his daughter distancing herself from him.  There's simply not enough there to care about.  Adding a brooding, intelligent, spiritually conflicted assistant helps, but doesn't save the franchise.
The writing this past season was the worst of all the seasons too often featuring caracatured religious groups that behave in ways that only exist in the fevered imaginations of, I assume, young writers who nothing of religious reality and therefore  live in fear and hatred of their caractures.

5298718,5,B009AF5OY8,"Inspector Lewis is a very well crafted series, that takes place in and near Oxford, England. The story lines for all six seasons were very well written, and they keep you guessing throughout most storylines. The story lines are not simplistic, and they are interesting and often topical. Kevin Whately (DI Lewis) and Laurence Fox (DS Hathaway) work extremely well together. Clare Holman (Dr. Laura Hobson) and Rebecca Front (Chief Inspector Jean Innocent) round out the main cast members, and like Whately and Fox, bring humanity and believability to their characters. This series is apparently going out on top, as I can find no references to a seventh season. I have read that Kevin Whately has much the same attitude about retirement, as his character DI Lewis has. He is ready for retirement, and he wants to spend more time with his family. The four main characters were temporarily part of our family, and we will miss them, and we wish them well in any future endeavors. This is really ""must see"" TV!",1390953600,,1007,4.826589595375722

5298782,5,B009AF5OY8,Loved it!! I have all seasons of Inspector Lewis that I watch over and over again.  The interaction between Inspector Lewis and Sergeant Hathaway is fun to watch. The stories are great mysteries.  Kevin Whately and Laurence Fox are wonderful actors and do a fantastic job with their parts. I am sorry there will be no more Inspector Lewis seasons but I think the final episode was well done and ended on a positive note. I recommend all the inspector Lewis videos to anyone that likes a good mystery.,1390608000,,500,4.606741573033708

5298795,5,B009AF5OY8,"So glad to have more Lewis to see! To have a decent man, a good husband mourning his wife and a good father, as a hero is so rare in our society and in this season we get to see him happy--at least for a little while. So good.

5298796,5,B009AF5OY8,"I really enjoyed Inspector Morse and this continues the same style. A lot of times a replacement just does not do the show justice, but Kevin Whately does a good job.",1390521600,,166,4.387096774193548
5298797,4,B009AF5OY8,All the way from the Inspector Morse series through Inspector Lewis we have enjoyed these (for the most part) well written and well acted BBC mysteries. We're sorry it came to an end.,1390521600,,183,4.575757575757576
5298798,5,B009AF5OY8,"I truly enjoy the British Crime series, i.e., Inspector Morse, Inspector Lewis, Midsomer Murders, George Gently, Inspector Lynley, The Last Detective, The Last Detective, Miss Marple, Sherlock Holmes, A Touch of Frost, and last but not least, Poirot, just to name a few.  They do not depend on unnecessary nudity and profanity, but they do make you think.  The same could be said about the old mysteries, such as The Thin Man and Charlie Chan series.",1390435200,,450,4.907894736842105
5298799,5,B009AF5OY8,"Love This show.  I also enjoyed Kevin Whately in the Inspector Morse series.  My favorite programs are BBC Mysteries/Detectives.

5298802,5,B009AF5OY8,The show is based on intellectual dialog rather than extreme violence and sex.  Good old fashioned detecting not a lot of flash.,1390435200,,128,4.818181818181818

Great stuff, marvelously acted, and never gets boring. If you enjoy this, be sure to check out Endeavour.",1390435200,,279,4.384615384615385
5298817,5,B009AF5OY8,We have been fans of Morse and Lewis from the beginning and were pleased when the Lewis spin-off appeared. The Lewis shows were a consistent extension of the Morse series and maintained the same general ambiance. If you enjoy British detective mysteries this series should not dissapoint.,1390435200,2,288,5.148936170212766

5298841,4,B009AF5OY8,Once again it is good to think along with the story line. And I just love Amazon Prime veiwing. This is almost as good as a donut (smiles). I guess Robbie Lewis has a woman in his life and is thinking of leaving the police service......I will not be a happy camper.,1390176000,,265,4.115384615384615
5298842,3,B009AF5OY8,I enjoy this series better than the Inspector Moorse ones.  I like Lewis and his new partner they make a good team,1390176000,,114,4.181818181818182

5298844,5,B009AF5OY8,The Inspector Lewis series is a favorite in our household. Lewis and Hathaway are a great team. The stories are not formulaic and the other characters are always well-rounded.  It's been fun to see over the years how the relationship with Lewis and Hathaway has developed as well as Lewis' relationships with other members of the ensemble cast.  Highly recommend this series to anyone  who is a fan of  the Inspector Morse series or British detective series in general.,1390176000,,469,4.89873417721519
5298845,5,B009AF5OY8,"We love to watch the English murder mysteries. The only problem is that we have watched them all. I wish there were more of them.

5298847,5,B009AF5OY8,"If you love Inspector Morse, you will love Lewis. Lewis was Morse's sergeant  in the old series and now Lewis is the DI with a new young sergeant, James Hathaway. The relationship between Lewis and Hathaway is my favorite part about the show, although the mysteries are good too. However, the real star of the show is Oxford, where the series is filmed. It is just a beautiful place.",1390089600,,383,4.550724637681159
5298848,5,B009AF5OY8,My husband loves to watch this series on our Kindle Fire. He finds them very entertaining and enjoyable. Two Thumbs Up!,1390089600,,119,4.714285714285714
5298849,5,B009AF5OY8,"My wife watches quite a lot of Masterpiece Mystery. This box set was a Christmas request. I might be getting into it more than she.

The seamy underside of Oxford can be cruel, full of anguish, and utterly cold-blooded. I like that the series creators have painted the detectives as competent yet flawed people. After viewing about a third of the discs I can say I'm hooked. I find I need a day or two in between viewings to just contemplate what I've watched.

Far superior to anything on American television, including most of ""high cable"" fare. Strongly recommended for people who appreciate good drama deftly and intricately plotted.",1390089600,2,637,4.834862385321101
5298850,4,B009AF5OY8,I am disappointed that this is the last of this series coming.  I don't enjoy romantic scenes in a mystery.,1390003200,,107,4.35

5298852,5,B009AF5OY8,I enjoy almost everything that Masterpiece Theater sends our way from merry old England. Excellent plot twists and turns plus witty.,1389916800,,132,5.333333333333333

5298855,5,B009AF5OY8,"I first watched Inspector Lewis, then I found out it started as as Inspector Morse...and now I find out there is a short series called Endeavour.  Endeavour is about Inspector Morse when he was a young police officer.  Inspector Morse and his able partner Lewis are middle age for Morse and twenty-something for Lewis.  Now Inspector Lewis is a middle-aged Lewis.  Good show, good acting, typical scripts.  I enjoy them.  Not a lot of thinking to do which is good after a long day.  I say watch the Inspector Lewis first and then go back to the prior series......",1389830400,,563,4.626262626262626
5298856,4,B009AF5OY8,Mysteries and clues and of course the English accent does not hurt the series.  I enjoy the whole putting together clues and what is involved.,1389830400,,142,4.68

5298860,5,B009AF5OY8,"I love the scenery, the characters of both Inspector Lewis and Mr. Hathaway.  The British humor is entertaining but requires attentiveness or you'll miss something.",1389830400,,164,5.56
5298861,4,B009AF5OY8,"We first watched the ""Inspector Morse"" series, and in the show after Morse died his protege Inspector Lewis took center stage.  These newer episodes are just as interesting ""who done its?""

One recurring sub-theme, some viewers may not care for, is whether faith and reason are compatible.  But, to help balance things out, Lewis is a very likable, magnanimous skeptic and his partner (the blonde gentleman) is a man of faith.",1389830400,,426,4.971830985915493
5298862,5,B009AF5OY8,I like a good cerebral mystery and Inspector Lewis excels in providing me that.  The partnership of Lewis and Hathaway is fantastic and always lends to the storyline.  Watch on a rainy evening while having a cup of Tea.,1389830400,,219,4.589743589743589
5298863,5,B009AF5OY8,I am a big fan of British mysteries. Inspector Lewis is one of my favorites. It holds your attention and the ending always seem to surprise you.

5298867,5,B009AF5OY8,Lewis & Hathaway are a wonderful duo that never get old. I do hope this series continues even though we've been watching it for 6 seasons now.

5298871,5,B009AF5OY8,"This Season continues with interesting plots (and twists), great acting by the main characters (the Inspector and Sargent), and this first Episode of the Season had very good secondary characters. It's extra appealing when the ""stars"" work well together. Have enjoyed ""Lewis"" since he was the partner on ""Morse"".",1389830400,,312,5.387755102040816

5298875,5,B009AF5OY8,"It is sad to see the conclusion of the series that started with John Thaw as Inspector Morse conclude.  All the personal issues were resolved nicly, and I suppose the door was left slightly ajar for Inspector Lewis to return (without Hathaway).  I'm surprised anyone is left alive in Oxford after all these years.  Not quite the body count in Midsommer I suppose.  In short, three nice episodes.",1389657600,,395,4.764705882352941

The (Oxford) settings are lovely. The three main characters are likeable, and there's a subtle touch of humor. The movie-length time span provides a neat parcel of entertainment, whether viewed at a sitting or divided into two parts.

Morse was great, but Lewis outshines it without following a clichd 'followed on from Morse' approach.

A gentle (if murders are gentle ;) approach - as much a Midsomer Murder approach as much as any.

I actually like Lewis better as the lead in the series than he was as Morse's assistant.  Even though I think Morse is still better as the lead character, I believe they wrote better shows for Lewis, which makes Inspector Lewis a little better series, overall.  What also makes it better is DS Lewis is a strong character.  I would even love him to get his own series.  I think in the lead, Laurence Fox could make a great character of an Inspector Fox.

The acting has been just wonderful - so tied up in the characters and the intricate plots involved. The last episode, Intelligent Design, was exactly that. I almost got lost trying to keep up with each piece of new evidence that, while seemingly unrelated to a death, was actually a link. Very tricky, indeed! I really felt for Hathaway at the end when he was questioning whether he could really go on in his profession. I can understand it, particularly after this episode. What people will do to each other and to themselves can really get out of hand!!

5298983,5,B009AF5OY8,"I discovered Morse a few months ago and watched all episodes, then moved on to Lewis ... I watched them all for free on Amazon Prime, and purchased the last season of Lewis on line so I could watch it ... Morse was of course very good, but I mostly kept watching because of Lewis ... and honestly enjoyed the Lewis series more ... got a little weary of the character of Morse after a while ... maybe from watching too many episodes too close together ... I liked each series for different reasons, most of which have been mentioned by other reviewers ... but I especially liked the intelligent plots, the focus on good dialog and well orchestrated scenes and movement of the plot ... also the wit ...but what I liked about Lewis, the man, and what I think appeals to many is that he is an adult ... a regular man, with a strong moral compass ... he makes mistakes and has moods but never gets lost in them ... I like that they let him have a normal grieving over the loss of his wife over several seasons, just like in real life ... and that the move into a new relationship was gradual and not done lightly or prematurely and grew out of a friendship ... the transion of Lewis and Laura to the next level seemed a little abrupt, but since the show was ending, it was nice closure ... Hathaways decision was building up even in series 5, so it seemed more a natural development of the character ... these qualities kept me watching even after the story lines became a little predictable ... I also liked the relationship of Lewis and Hathaway ... their banter and their respect for each other despite some quite different takes on life ... you know, grown ups ... and maybe its just but me but I have read the Lord Peter Wimsey books many times and I see Laurance Fox as the perfect person to bring Lord Peter Wimsey to life in the 21st century, just as B. Cumberbatch is with Sherlock ...  Wouldn't that be lovely!",1383609600,,1915,4.304709141274238

5298989,5,B009AF5OY8,"I became a fan of the character of Lewis when he was Inspector Morse's long-suffering ""side-kick"" in the wonderful and long running ""Morse"" mystery series.  For six (6) seasons I have really enjoyed the British mystery series of ""Lewis"" that are set in England in Oxford.  For six (6) seasons the PBS series of ""Lewis"" has provided greatly written, directed and acted murder/mysteries that are shown without gratuitous violence and/or without extreme and jarring ""special effects"".  Season six (6) continues the aforesaid qualities.  Season six (6) has three (3) superbly written mysteries that are wonderfully directed and acted by Kevin Whatley as Lewis and by his ""side-kick"" Sergeant James Hathaway--fabulously acted by Lawrence Fox.  Those two are so good at solving this season's mysteries that involve death by powerful animal drugs, a fake clairvoyant, mysterious/unknown body cremated to cover illegal drug trade, death by one's own car, etc.  (Be advised that Hathaway appears in only two episodes appearing only briefly in the second episode)  Lewis and Hathaway solve the mysteries without any screaming and without much high tech help; the mysteries, once again, are solved just by good ""old fashioned"" sleuthing.  Hathaway and Lewis complement each other so well in Season six (6)--Lewis is near to retirement with a touch of cynicism plus new romance in his life and Hathaway being still very young and rather eager to ""do good"" and wondering ""what to do next"" with his life.

I will truly miss this British series because it has entertained so very well.",1382832000,,1570,5.173913043478261

The two inspectors are realistic, down-to-earth characters just trying to do the best that they can.  The plots are excellent and the dialog is very well written.  Inspector Hathaway has a great dry sense of humor and it is fun to watch the interaction between him and Inspector Lewis.  The two men have great respect for each other and it shows.  At first, as I do with most mysteries, I concentrated on trying to figure out ""who-done-it"".  However I came to realize that the data needed to determine the solution was only slowly revealed throughout the show so, instead, I learned to just sit back and relax and enjoy the main characters and their interactions as they unravel the mystery - great writing.  In addition, the writers did a great job of slowly building the relationship between Inspector Lewis and Dr. Hobson. I always looked forward to the bit at the end of each show, that revealed a little more about each character.

It is touching to see the bonding that goes on between the two Main Characters, they really draw you into their partnership. They really work as a team and you see there friendship develope in each series. In some ways they both are broken and become whole together and it is Inspector Lewis  that seems to keep his partner in the police force and learning and it is Hathaway that keeps Lewis open to new idea's. They compliment each other and through each case they develope trust. In this sixth season you get the sense that the show in its present form is ending and that adds a taste of sadness to this season for me. Truly life does change and you can see that its realistically changing as life would do, so it'll be interesting to know where things  go from here. Its a good ride though.

5299022,5,B009AF5OY8,"Following what was most likely the last ever episode of Lewis, this is the DVD set we have all been waiting for.  It contains all 27 episodes in the six seasons of Inspector Lewis including the original pilot.  Do not be misled by the Amazon description which at the time of writing states a running time of 430 minutes - I presume it will be corrected in due course.  In fact these 14 discs run to no less than 2,430 minutes, which is enough to keep us all absorbed for some time!  Most importantly these are stated to be the full length UK edition - there has been much criticism of cuts made for the North American releases of some of the Lewis DVD sets in the past.

It is hard to believe that the pilot show was broadcast as recently as 2006, as it seems that Inspector Lewis has been part of our viewing lives for so much longer.  I think this is to a large extent, because the character of Lewis first appeared in Morse as long ago as 1986 and has been played by Kevin Whately throughout.  Few would have imagined initially that Inspector Lewis would be as successful as Morse, but it has certainly achieved at least as much as that series.  Just as the chemistry between Sergeant Lewis, as he was then, and Morse (John Thaw) was a defining strength in that show, the bond between Lewis and DS James Hathaway (Laurence Fox) has increased with time and has been one of the main strengths of Inspector Lewis.

To my mind the other factor which has made Lewis such a success is the excellent script writing.  The stories are varied and complex.  This is not the sort of drama which you are going to be able to watch with one eye on something else and still pick up all the detail of the plot, as you can with much of what is shown on TV.  However, the stories are clever and satisfying and well worth the effort to follow them closely.  They are also the sort of show which it is worth returning to again and again, and we often revisit the earlier episodes.

There are some bonus features included with this set including `The Making of Inspector Lewis' and an interview with Kevin Whately.  Although there was a certain finality about the final episode of Lewis at the end of Season 6, there are some faint grounds for hope as a spokesperson for ITV, the production company, has stated that the series `may' return in 2014 either as a one off show or a series.  I imagine it all depends on the willingness of Kevin Whately and Laurence Fox to continue as they both seemed keen to move on to other things.",1380067200,133,2510,4.331196581196581
5299023,5,B009AF5OY8,"Cannot believe that Inspector Lewis is gone now. However, the actors and producers did a fine job wrapping up any and all lose ends. Understand that Inspector Lewis was ready to retire. Hope to see him AND Hathaway again in the future.",1379980800,,235,4.619047619047619

Lewis, superior, Jane Innocent, is becoming more mellow but she realizes there are political realities she must deal with but backs her Inspector and his sergeant as much as she feels she can.  Inspector Lewis and Sergeant Hathaway are an unlikely but highly effective team who unravel the motives for murders which often seem incomprehensible.  When Hathaway pushes a troubled youth in the course of an investigation to divulge information, he is tormented by the youth's suicide.  Consumed with guilt, Hathaway gives in his resignation.  Lewis understands, tries to change Hathaway's mind, but Lewis, a widower, intends to retire himself and purse a new life with their forensic pathologist.

Lewis is as always the common man, and replacing Morse is a younger intellectual and former seminary student, Hathaway: This time Lewis is the senior officer, however.  They play off each other in the same humorous style Lewis and Morse did in the original series, based on the books by Collin Dexter.  Each story is a puzzle, not just dead bodies, blood and gore.  The scenery is gorgeous, mostly set in and around Oxford.  The music is relaxing and interesting.  All around it is a very well done show.  Too bad they only do 3 episodes a season.

Then again, you never know.  Lot's of thinking keeping up with the two enforces of the law, and showing us their personal side as well.",1378684800,,324,4.568965517241379
5299038,5,B009AF5OY8,So sorry this terrific series is ending. Endeavour isn't matching expectations. I think the key to Lewis was the original awesome calming music.,1378684800,,144,5.304347826086956

5299041,5,B009AF5OY8,A good thing is hard to give up; I sincerely hope we haven't seen the last of Lewis or Hathaway!  This 6th season of the absolutely marvelous Lewis series continues the high standards of quality in writing and performance we've come to expect from Lewis.  I just hope it isn't the last.,1378598400,,286,4.480769230769231

5299044,5,B009AF5OY8,I loved watching these shows.  The scenery is beautiful.  The writing is the best and the acting is great.  I always feel like I'm right in the middle of the whole mystery.  I've come to know Lewis and Hathaway with their back stories and must say I like them very much.  These shows are gems!,1378512000,,293,4.254545454545455

5299047,5,B009AF5OY8,"The complete Lewis series has been absolutely delightful, & I'd put in on a par with the original Morse series, which I thought could never be equalled. Season 6 has lived up to the prior series, with the incredible writing, acting, scenery, as well as the chemistry between all the actors. Season 6 once again shows the complete full-length UK shows, which is great because every minute is so absorbing. I realize Masterpiece Mystery has to cut 10+ minutes from each show to fit the PBS 90 minute slot, so it's awesome we get to see the full shows. It appears this show really is done, & I'm very sad to see it end, as I'm sure millions of viewers will agree. We can only hope they might do yearly specials down the road like the Morse series did in it's final years.",1378339200,,768,4.3776223776223775

5299050,4,B009AF5OY8,"While this season of Inspector Lewis was only three episodes, it appeared obvious to me that the writing was on the wall that this would be the last 3 episodes for some time.  The writers seemed to be trying to tie up all of the loose ends quickly, which caused the episodes to appear rushed and a little bit disjointed compared to other seasons.  I did like how Dr Hobson and Lewis wound up together at the end of the series, with Hathaway going off on his own, but I believe that they needed at least 1 or 2 more episodes to properly do it.  The series as a whole had good characters, good storylines, and a great setting with a few references to Morse teaching Lewis the ropes (I believe Lewis said that if it were up to Morse I still would be a Seargent.).",1378166400,,760,4.191780821917808

5299052,5,B009AF5OY8,Lewis is one of my favorite detective series.  Loads of wonderful actors and writers along with the Oxford scenery make this a perfect choice.  If you are a fan of Morse you will love this continuation of the series.,1378080000,,216,4.512820512820513

5299056,5,B009AF5OY8,"My darling, conflicted, dishy detective Hathaway. How I shall miss him and the charming camaraderie between him and Robbie. I hope there is a way to continue this series. Perhaps murders occurring in the environs of Hathaway's seminary. Facile, I agree, but one can hope.

By the by, can't you just see him as PD James Commander Dalgliesh?",1377820800,,339,4.844827586206897

5299060,5,B009AF5OY8,Have watched all episodes from the six season series. I will miss it. The mysteries are complicated. There is no use of the CSI magical stuff. Just persistent police work. U work thru the evidence with Lewis and Hathaway. Well written .,1377734400,,236,4.642857142857143

5299065,5,B009AF5OY8,I am so happy that they went on to produce solving mysteries the Lewis way. He learned from the best right!!! Finally Lewis has given in to his feelings and a second chance for love! Cannot wait to see how this evolves. Buy this series as it releases. Like myself you will go back to the beginning and watch them over and over!,1377561600,,327,4.2063492063492065
5299066,5,B009AF5OY8,"Inspector Lewis is one of my two all time favorite series and despite some minor disappointments, the final three episodes were still better than most everything else that's out there. My biggest gripe is the almost total absence of the dishy James Hathaway in the middle episode. The ""usuals"" were all present and accounted for; the stories were well done, the sense of suspense lightened with humor was a good as ever, and some ends long left loose were neatly tied up. I just don't want it to be over. I  am really hoping it is just a sabbatical, but if it is not they went out in style.",1377561600,,590,4.412844036697248

I have all of  these and think they are GREAT to watch! I also have several Hercule Periot series which are great to watch too!!  All the PBS mystery series are great!,1377043200,,321,4.372881355932203
5299077,5,B009AF5OY8,We bought this Masterpiece Mystery because we enjoyed the series so much on PBS that we wanted to have it so we could go back and watch it again any time we wanted.  Wish we could get something this good produced here in the US instead of all the reality garbage.  Can't wait for more to come out.,1377043200,,297,4.103448275862069

5299082,5,B009AF5OY8,"While there are many excellent British who-dunnits (Frost, Morse, Gently, etc.), Inspector Lewis is quite unlike the others, partly because his beat is a university town where intellectuals abound and Lewis, a working class guy who made good, is the least likely person you'd imagine in such a setting. The pairing of Lewis and Hathaway is brilliant. While Lewis is the down-to-earth sort who is able to see through the arrogant posturing of the educated, Hathaway is the cerebral former monk who has his own inner torments. Together they cover all sides of the equation--playing against each other and at the same time being in sync enough to work out the quirks of the case. The plots are always complicated, making them fun for the viewers. No one will watch this series and guess the outcome in the first minutes; the writers make us work our speculations up to the final reveal. Anybody with a tendency to nod off for even five minutes will be hopelessly lost in these plots.",1376956800,,980,4.770588235294118

5299085,5,B009AF5OY8,"Excellent quality case, holders and DVD's. No scratches or unusable discs.

Each episode does have 2 commercials at the start but they are not offensive and you can zoom past them. I just mention this because some newer DVD's force you to watch previews or other marketing junk in addition to the normal lawyer-speak warnings.

An excellent show (but if you are getting this season 6 DVD, I am sure you know that already) that continues to provide excellent acting and thought provoking situations and dialog.",1376697600,,509,4.906976744186046

The series stories are complex and interesting and the interaction of the main characters have added empathy and reality to the show.

There is something very comforting about this series,  the physical beauty,  the solution guaranteed at the end of the show,  the relationship between Hathaway and Lewis.  Goes down like a cuppa and biscuit.

5299121,4,B009AF5OY8,"I absolutely LOVED this series and like many fans, I've purchased every season. While I found the episodes in this last season interesting (albeit a bit ""ho-hum""), it was obvious that not much thought went into the writing. It just didn't have the same ""feel"" as the previous seasons. While the setting and the cast were the same it just wasn't what you'd expect from this wonderful show. Truthfully even though I am a big fan, I had no idea this was the last season. Then things started happening for now good reason like the basically ""instant"" romance (trying to not spoil for some) and characters starting to wonder what it all means. Of course it became obvious in the end. I reluctantly gave it 4 stars (all others would get 10 stars if possible). Having said all of that, it is a good show and I was very disappointed in the number of episodes... it left me wanting more.",1375401600,,878,4.49375

This should be considered a Mystery classic. A great continuation of Lewis after Morse and the introduction of Hathaway (a complex and at times dark. Yet so vunerable.)

As always, a shame to see the series end . . .",1374883200,,389,4.6231884057971016

Although I enjoyed those books and shows, I have always liked Lewis much more.  It has a very good cast, good plots, very nice music, and a really great sense of Oxford both as a physical place and a site for human activities.  Apparently the series is ending, and while I like Lewis finally getting together with the medical examiner, I will miss this series very much.  I could easily enjoy another six series.  The producers should keep the relationship and find some way to continue the stories.",1374796800,,613,4.691588785046729

5299154,5,B009AF5OY8,"I am a huge and devoted fan of Inspector Morse and, when they decided to tell the tales of our own Robbie, I did not show up late for the telling. Whately was already perfect and did a smashing job as a Lewis bereft of Morse and of his spouse, children grown and gone, and in need of a reboot of his life. Fox and his script writers nailed it by bringing some of what Thaw/Morse contributed to the original duo. This is Robbie's story and I've loved every minute of it.

5299158,5,B009AF5OY8,I had to finish off my collection with this series. I loved the Inspector Morse series and Lewis did not disappoint either. I am sorry the series ended because I looked forward to each season. The script was well written and the story lines were complicated which made me go back to watch them over and over. The acting was brilliant and entertaining. I guess I will have to get caught up in Morse's early career in Endeavor. The Brits sure know how to make such great television and their actors are stupendous.,1374192000,,512,4.516129032258065
5299159,5,B009AF5OY8,"I have been watching Masterpiece Mystery for many years. Long before Lewis came in to his own. In my humble opinion,these are some of the finest mysterys I have ever had the pleasure to watch. The mysterys themselves very,very well written,and be warned,make sure you have all your comforts handy,and within reach,for once it starts,if you leave the room for any reason,and believe me,I've done it,you may miss the single clue that could be an important part of the puzzle. Also,its great to really hear the English language being used to the fullest,and I include puns,understated humor,word games,etc. The actors and their use of dialog makes this series so good,that you really are forced to think about what is being said,which can be as important as the crime itself. Also whoever is doing the writing for these is very well read,as there are a lot of literary references to other books,poems,etc. The actors: first class.these men and women have been doing this series for a few years now,they fit well together. It is great to watch a mystery that forces me to listen,and think,as opposed to sitting back and saying""entertain me!"" And thats something I can do with a lot more of....thinking I mean!",1374192000,,1205,4.911764705882353

5299161,5,B009AF5OY8,"I was heart sick when  actor John Thaw (MORSE) passed away and we not only lost and amazing talented actor but also a series that was not repeatable.....or so I thought....Inspector Lewis more that filled the empty space and quickly became my ""Comfort Series"" on PBS Masterpiece.  I wished there had been more episodes  produced even though the subject of murder can become somewhat tiresome to some...but the writing was always complicated, humorous, heartfelt and entertaining and watching Kevin Whatley continue to grow into the good natured, capable crime solver who coached Hathaway as Morse had done for him was such a wonderful gift to watch...and he got the girl in the end which is as it should be.  I would have liked a little more meat to the story concerning the ending, but that is probably just me not wanting to let go.  I now can send my fondest farewell and deepest gratitude to all who gave me so much enjoyment for many, many years",1374192000,2,950,4.698795180722891

5299165,5,B009AF5OY8,"If you are an Inspector Lewis fan, you should enjoy this latest installment.  The series offers consistent quality in original plots, believable and entertaining characters, atmospheric Oxford scenery, fun dialogue and a rotation of those British character actors we love to watch.  I feel like I could find my way around Oxford now after watching this and the Inspector Morse series.

There are three episodes in this season. Lewis and Hathaway work so comfortably together now.  They seem like real people.  Would love to have a pint with them at the local pub.  We do hope they will do an occasional special of Inspector Lewis, if this is the last season.

5299167,5,B009AF5OY8,"It seems that the Inspector Lewis series gets better each season with more interesting plots and a more nuanced relationship between Kevin Whately's Lewis and Laurence Fox's Hathaway. With the recent addition of ""Endeavour"" to the Morse canon, these episodes are that much more valuable. It's unfortunate that this seems to be the last season.",1373932800,,343,5.254545454545455
5299168,5,B009AF5OY8,"This is a prime example of what is great about British classic formula mysteries.

5299169,5,B009AF5OY8,"The last of the series - it's like saying good bye to an old friend.  We've spent the last few years enjoying the series and can't believe its come down to the last one!  Worth every minute.
The one thing regarding these series that I don't enjoy is the antagonism toward organized religion.  While recognizing that religious ""organizations"" have shortcomings, individual faith can be uplifting and encouraging. Overall it is an excellent series and we will enjoy watching them again!",1373760000,5,484,5.025
5299170,5,B009AF5OY8,"This may be the last of Lewis and the best, too. Excellent episodes in this pack. The romantic in me greatly enjoyed seeing movement in the ""Push me, Pull me"" relationship between Lewis and Laura Hobson. It rang very true that Lewis is stepping out of his guilt-nurtured clinging to his wife and on to seeing new possibilities for his life. The stories here stand well on their own as mysteries.

I also happened to be able to see the third episode and then view the final Morse episode ""The Remosrseful Day"" as I had ordered the 25th anniversary collection from Amazon and had a visitor who had seen all the but that final episode so we played it. The writers of the current Lewis series very nicely come full circle and wrote a script that brings the unfinished business in Morse and Lewis' relationship to a closer relationship between Lewis and Hathaway. That pairing of stories is very nice. Again I applaud Colin Dexter's creation of characters as a mystery series that brings the amateur detective of the Agatha Christie vein to the professional police detective and bridges the older style detective fiction with the modern police procedural to create a very satisfying story form. The writers and creators who have taken the characters further and added Hathaway to the mix have kept the spirit and brilliance of the original without feeling the need to totally change the style and characters. Their creation is marvelous.",1373760000,5,1432,4.821138211382114
5299171,5,B009AF5OY8,So enjoyable!  This season is delivering as the others did.  Thanks for making the great episodes from this British  series available.,1373760000,,134,5.285714285714286
5299172,5,B009AF5OY8,"Happy to say these final episodes are most enjoyable.  They tie things up nicely.  We're sad to see the end of Lewis but so far we are enjoying Endeavour!

I like the way the depth of the characters have been developed, and the acting is very believable. I've followed this show from year one,and look forward to every episode. Alas, it looks as if it maybe coming to the end. How about an ""Inspector Hathaway"" series?",1373760000,2,359,4.373134328358209
5299174,5,B009AF5OY8,Love Lewis on Masterpiece Theater as I always loved Kevin Whately in Inspector Morse as his detective Sergeant Lewis.  Now Sergeant Lewis became DCI Lewis and does an incredible job.  Also PBS is presenting young Morse in the series Endeavor.  Two of these are available on Amazon and worth the watch again and again.  I bought the whole Series 6 Inspector on Amazon Prime for an incredible price I can watch again and again.  I purchased the Inspector Lewis Series 1-4 on DVD at Amazon for an incredible price.  I am now watching Inspector Lewis Series 5 for free with my Amazon Prime Membership.  All of the Inspector Lewis Series is available for streaming now on Amazon Instant Video in HD.  Endeavor is also available at Amazon Prime but just the first episode I believe.  Unfortunately Inspector Morse Series is unavailable for streaming as yet.  I would love to see Amazon have Inspector Morse available for streaming but has not as yet. If you love a great mystery as the Brits do so well you will love Inspector Lewis and his Detective Sergeant Hathaway.,1373760000,3,1063,4.728260869565218

5299176,5,B009AF5OY8,I do hope that this is not the end of the Inspector Lewis series.  Or is it the beginning of Inspector Hathaway?,1373673600,,112,4.090909090909091
5299177,5,B009AF5OY8,"there are three concluding episodes here.  all are extremely well done.  Hathaway really grew on me over the course of the series.  Lewis on his own was just too nice and bland a guy to sustain a series on his own. Lewis's romantic life gets a nice boost here as well. far from leaving us high and dry though, we now have ENDEAVOUR, about morse's early years to replace Lewis.  if you are feeling sad, my biggest recommendation is to read all of the Colin Dexter novels about Morse.  good as these productions have been, including this last one, nothing equals the novels!

Now we both! Still set in Oxford, Lewis now has a female Chief, and a young and educated sergeant. The sergeant is not arrogant though, and respects the years and knowledge Lewis has. They work well together, and have a much more collegial working relationship than Morse and Lewis. Dr. Hobson is still around, and they keep hinting at a possible romantic angle between her and Lewis (Lewis's wife has died), but the show hasn't made up it's mind yet on that.

5299193,3,B009AF5OY8,"The thing that struck me, was  why in Hell didn't Lewis, ask for some of the antidote, to take with him in case, that the Horse lady told him she always carries?.

 I also agree with other reviewers that  there could have been a ""shoes of the fisherman""  moment, where Hathaway provides some last comfort, In the same manner that Anthony Quin as Pope, out  for a night among the common folk, get's recruited to lend comfort to a dying man,  started to pray in Latin, and the people stopped him saying they were all Jews, he paused, and started again with the proper Hebrew prayer, in that scene and it was an amazing moment.

That professor, not reacting at all to people getting murdered , just goes out for another jog, lot's of this type of  nonsense going on In this episode, with poor direction and writing.  Anyway, as a fan,  I will watch these, but they are not up to par.

-here is the film referance:
Shoes  of the Fisherman strives to depict the new pope as a man of simplicity and humility. Upon his election he introduces himself to his private butler as ""Kyril Lakota."" He prevails upon that same butler to find him a black cassock and hat so that he can sneak out of the Vatican and explore the alleyways of Rome as an ordinary priest. In one of the more touching scenes from the film, he brings medicine from a pharmacy to an English doctor who is treating a dying man. When he sees the condition of the man, Kyril immediately begins to administer the last rites, but is quickly told that the man is not Christian; he is a Jew. The Holy Father puts his hat on, covers his face with his hand and begins to chant the Hebrew prayer for the dying.",1373068800,,1659,4.312903225806451
5299194,5,B009AF5OY8,"If you have followed this series and are involved with it and perhaps know ""Inspector Morse"" that preceded it (where the Lewis character was established,) you will find this a wonderful trio of episodes. The characters are brought to an interesting conclusion and thankfully stay the course of their development as this series wraps up. Both emotional and believable, it seems to be a graceful conclusion with drama, suspense, and wit.

The production values are great, and the disc mastering heralds the ""Original UK Edition"". The cinematography and settings are even cooler than before, tastefully hipster in a way, I'm guessing they have gotten continually larger budgets as this series unfolded. Other reviewers have dwelt on and discussed the lengthy process of getting the actual DVDs released in the US, why does it take seemingly longer with each set of discs, whether these delays are real or imaginary (not going there) etc, etc.

One US release negative: while I expect PBS and Masterpiece Mystery to have some intro and sponsor information on the DVD menu, and even on the first episode, it was awkward to have to go through all of that again at the beginnings of episodes two and three. Perhaps I fumbled the menus, but I don't think you have the option to skip the Ralph Lauren or other sponsors and their identical pitches at each playing of every episode. Given the calibre of the sponsors, surely they could have developed three different pitches, telling a more interesting story, if their sponsor dollars dictate that they are getting embedded into each play? If ""Ralph"" and Viking River Cruises had kept their story going in three different parts, I would have felt much more charitable about them instead of viewing the identical spots three evenings in a row. I doubt that kind of impression was what they were hoping for.

But you could watch these Lewis episodes numerous times (and I'm sure our household will) and still find new items in each to thrill to and enjoy!",1372982400,,1992,4.887573964497041
5299195,5,B009AF5OY8,"I can't believe this is the end of Lewis. This series has given me many hours of enjoyment. Not only the excellent acting by all the cast, but the well written and intelligent scripts. When we lost Morse, that the character of Lewis was born, it was a great addition to British Mysteries. There is nothing to compare (at least not in the US) to the quality of British Mysteries. I own Morse, Frost, Miss Marple, Midsomer Murders, Inspector Lynley, Sherlock Holmes( with Jeramy Brett, of course), Campion, Heat of the Sun, the Allen series,etc. Well, you get the point. I watch these time and again and never get tired of them.

5299196,5,B009AF5OY8,"Alas, it looks like Inspector Lewis will be retiring at the end of season six, and his patient manner of policing will come to an end as the curtain is drawn over the series.

As I sit with a pint of best bitter in front of my TV and the end titles of ""Intelligent Design"", the last episode in the series, scroll to a weary closure, I realize that I have spent over *twenty years* with with Morse and Lewis, for I have been acquainted with them since the 1980s, and they along with Jean Innocent and James Hathaway and Chief Superintendent Strange have regularly entered my home as friends and consorted with me, allowing me to observe them in the vicissitudes of their jobs and lives -- much like 'take your kid to work' day, except on multiple days every year for two decades.

And alas, now that will end.

Much as Lewis missed his wife after she died, with a shallow lingering scar of sorrow but without any trace of cloying sentimentality, so shall I miss this show. And since Oxford has been described as the ""city of dreaming spires"", it is but natural that I ask myself,

  What are those blue remembered hills,
  What spires, what farms are those?

That is the land of lost content,
  I see it shining plain,
The happy highways where I went
  And cannot come again.

But before I can turn too maudlin, I hear a voice in my ear. ""But cheer up laddie"", I hear Lewis say with his quiet Geordie air, ""there's always 'Endeavour' to watch on the telly now.""

5299198,5,B009AF5OY8,"I am delighted with the final set of Inspector Lewis, yet at the same time very sad that there will probably be no more to come as the fictional character is all set to retire.

If it is going off the air, I will miss it terribly. Nothing will replace this. Here's hoping they decide to come back.",1372896000,,454,4.2298850574712645
5299201,5,B009AF5OY8,"The Inspector Lewis series is truly a 'masterpiece'.  The mystery is difficult to solve because there are several suspects, and the real culprit is often a surprise.  Enjoyed it greatly, but wished there were more episodes.",1372896000,,223,5.166666666666667
5299202,3,B009AF5OY8,"Ahhhhh....Where do I begin?

I own series one thru five.  I like the two male leads very much.  Can't stand the fembot Chief Super.  The overweight Strange in Morse was far better and more suitable.  I'm sure they could have found a suitable MALE to play the Chief Super in this one, but nooooo...have to follow the pc Jezebel line and put a woman in charge over males.  When I saw the first episode called the pilot, when Lewis returns from the tropics after the death of his wife and they introduce the fembot in her first scene with Robbie, it was all I could do to keep from throwing the thing in the trash.  I bought the rest because of Lewis and Hathaway and restrained myself. I do like the woman who plays the medical person, Clare Holman.

Anyway, the stories have all been good, but these last three which I saw on the Propaganda BROAD- casting Service, seem to be lacking something.  I realize this is supposedly the last series from what I've read on the net.  I hope they can do something decent with this new early Morse ""Endeavor"".  At least it should be much too early to be affected with todays pc BS, but will probably have it's own 60's rebellion crap like the series George Gently.

I won't be buying this last series.",1372896000,,1238,4.381578947368421
5299203,5,B009AF5OY8,"My wife and I have been British Mystery fans for well over 20 years and have seen the best and ""least best"".  I can't honestly say we've ever panned a complete series so have no ""worst"" category. The style and presentation of the episodes is so unlike most of the mediocre offerings we see here in America - packed with action, violence and gory details.  It took us a few episodes to completely warm to ""Inspector Lewis"" but warm we did.  The Oxford setting, the intellect of Hathaway, the straight-forward plodding style of Lewis make it such an enjoyable watch.  Kevin Whately is an every-mans' actor - not particularly handsome and struggling with the same issues that often face us.  But he carries it off on the screen and it parlays into a nice point counter-point mix with Fox, who plays the philosophical but committed intellectual to a ""T"".  The writing is good, the ""action"" is tolerable, and the acting is great.  Like many Brit mystery series it may come across as slightly sterile/cleansed but the character development, the pursuit, and the settings make them most enjoyable.",1372896000,,1090,4.7967914438502675
5299204,2,B009AF5OY8,"Having seen the entire Inspector Morse series, I was very pleased with Inspector Lewis when it first came to Masterpiece Theatre. Lewis and Hathaway were wonderful together...complimenting each other as Morse and Lewis did, but it opposite ways. I viewed and purchased the entire series and looked forward to seeing this last season. However, I am disappointed with this last season. Much as it was fun to watch the chemistry grow between Lewis and Dr Hobson, it didn't seem right in the last two episodes...would've been better to leave them interested in each other. And the last episode showed a very low side of Hathaway, someone who seemed to be wandering, not knowing what he was going to do with his life. I was very disappointed to see when one of the victims in the first episode lay dying and asked Hathaway to pray for her, he did nothing, yet he had studied for the priesthood? I highly recommend the first six seasons, but I'm sorry I purchased this last season.",1372809600,5,975,4.707602339181286
5299205,5,B009AF5OY8,"Since several other reviewers have given synopses of the episodes, I'll merely add that this is one of my favorite series and that I am so sad to see it end. I loved the Oxford settings and the gentle, complimentary partnership between the intellectual, ascetic Hathaway and the kindhearted, intuitive everyman, Lewis. Additionally the respectful treatment of the series' female characters, particularly the intelligent, well rounded pathologist Laura Hobsen and the always thoughtful, well modulated Chief Superintendent, Jean Innocent, is terrific. In fact, this is one of the rare series to feature strong and attractive middle aged women, regardless of their guilt or innocence or their foibles and motivations.

The human element is what appeals most in these stories. I'm so tired of drooling, maniacal serial killers dismembering bodies in the basement, as well as the kind of endless action and violence that follows in such productions. Here, people are carried away and commit heinous acts because of their overweening ambition, their inadequacies, their twisted emotions and their mistaken ideas and belief systems.

I can only hope that in the future the the production will return as an occasional feature length program.",1372723200,,1234,5.421875
5299206,5,B009AF5OY8,I love the British Mystery. Inspector Lewis is still going strong since Morse. His sidekick Hathaway has become my favorite. His character over the series has made a fan out of me. Keep them coming. Would miss them terribly if the quit.,1372723200,,236,4.642857142857143
5299207,4,B009AF5OY8,"Series 6 of ""Inspector Lewis"" is expected to be its last, so the writers have taken the opportunity to tie up some loose ends, even if the series does end up in the air and leave us not quite believing that there will be no more. Detective Inspector Robbie Lewis (Kevin Whately) and Detective Sergeant James Hathaway (Laurence Fox) are back for three episodes. The plotlines are less conspicuously academic than in previous series, only tangentially connected to Oxford University. That diminishes ""Inspector Lewis"" unique flavor a bit, but I'm happy to report that, in two out of three episodes, the culprits have tangible, believable motives, rather than being motivated to murder by bizarre neuroses. There is little attention paid to the relationship between the two detectives, as has been a common theme in previous seasons. Dr. Laura Hobson (Clare Holman) also returns as the series down-to-earth police pathologist. The writing suffers from its typical plot holes and coincidences, but the mysteries are generally entertaining -with the exception of ""The Ramblin' Boy"", which is poorly written. Series 6 in the US is Series 7 in the UK. The episodes are:

In ""Down Among the Fearful"", practicing psychic Randolf James (Edwin Thomas) is found dead in his office, having been injected with a barbiturate and then a paralytic, so he was well aware that he was dying. James specialized in communicating with the dead, and, upon investigation, turns out to be a psychology graduate student by the name of Ruben Beatty conducting an experiment on why people cling to religious and paranormal views of the world. The list of suspects extends to disgruntled clients who may have found out that James was a fraud, rival psychics Frank McLean (Dominic Mafham) and the troubled Justine Skinner (Beatie Edney), and Beatty's colleagues at the university, including Vicki Walmsley (Tuppence Middleton), who fears for her life but is reluctant to tell Lewis or Hathaway why. The murderer has a goofy motive, but the episode is otherwise entertaining.

""The Ramblin' Boy"" finds DS Hathaway on vacation, while DI Lewis investigates a misplaced corpse at home. Lewis has a temporary partner, the ambitious but inexperienced DC Alex Gray (Babou Ceesay). The embalmed corpse of an elderly man is found in the woods. He died of natural causes and was thought to have been cremated, leading Lewis to suspect that someone else's body was in the casket. Wealthy businessman Peter Faulkner (Peter Davison) is an investor in the funeral parlor, and his wife is recently rumored to have run off with a police officer, Jack Cornish (Mark Powley), which makes Lewis suspect that Cornish was the victim. But there is another murder and Liam Jay (Taron Egerton), a young man who works at the funeral parlor, seems to know something. This mystery has too many characters, is convoluted and difficult to follow, and relies upon everyone incriminating themselves.

In ""Intelligent Design"", Prof. Richard Seager (Stephen Churchett), just released from prison after serving a sentence for vehicular manslaughter, is murdered when someone runs over him with his own car. The obvious suspect is Rachel Cliff (Crystal Leaity), the distraught sister of Seager's victim. But Seager left a mysterious message carved into the car's paint before he died, and his wife Martha (Alison Steadman), a vicar, lied to Lewis and Hathaway about their relationship. Seager was involved in research on Alzheimer's disease, and his fellowship at the university was revoked on account of his criminal conviction. Dr. Stella Drew (Miranda Raison) was promoted into his place, providing her with a motive for murder. Her husband, Carl (Ariyon Bakare), is a high school chemistry teacher and tutor to Rachel Cliff's boyfriend. The murderer has a credible motive in this one, even if it is not quite satisfying.",1372636800,2,3858,5.149920255183413

I hope if they do end this series (as it sounds like) that they spin Hathaway off into a show of his own. His character is so very unique and interesting. These episodes have been great and I will truly miss this series if it ends. By all means, pick up a show and find out why everyone is rating it 5 stars. It's well worth it.",1372636800,,451,3.967032967032967
5299210,4,B009AF5OY8,"By now most are aware that Season Six includes the finale  of ""Inspector Lewis"".  Whether they sporadically continue the episodes as was done with ""A Touch of Frost"" is unknown, but for now it appears the Morse themed homage to Oxford will continue with ""Endeavour"" and Lewis will be allowed to gracefully retire and set up housekeeping with Dr. Laura.

These episodes represent a departure from the rather mundane scripts of the last several years.  From the outset they deviated from Colin Dexter's characterization of the Oxford Police by launching the cast into a protracted campus police role where just about every investigation was focused on the colleges.  I'm not sure why this creative decision was made but the episodes soon became repetitive, at times pretentious,  and certainly not worthy of the sequel status PBS had appended to it.  By contrast, the Morse episodes were diverse and only a few dealt with the colleges directly.  It was much more likely to find  Morse and then DS Lewis out of the academic environment dealing with known criminals, the landed gentry, or troubled townies. For some inexplicable reason the Lewis producers turned the time honored Oxford social tension of ""town and gown"" into all gown and no town.  That, and the inability of the writers to develop Lewis into a dominant lead character limited the episodes to be a pleasant but shallow police procedural rather than the personality driven drama of it's predecessor.  In these final episodes the writing is still weak and too much time is wasted showing Lewis and Hathaway strolling across the same college courtyards they seem to cover in every film, but there's a certain thematic diversity that's been lacking in previous seasons.  They still didn't resolve the ""is he or isn't he gay"" tease on Hathaway, but at least they seem to have solidified Lewis as a soon to be happy pensioner.

In a literary trilogy the middle novel often represents a difficult transition from the initial story arc to something new and different.  Perhaps with ""Endeavour"" they'll be able to bring the Morse saga full circle and create a video trilogy worthy of the Dexter novels.  Regardless, Lewis Season 6 stands on it's own as a fitting denouement to a story line and title character many of us have known for over 25 years (or 38 years if you first met Lewis in print).  Have your ""happy life"" Robbie, we'll miss you.",1372636800,2,2398,4.869458128078818
5299211,5,B009AF5OY8,"This is the last season of ""Inspector Lewis"", one the best British crime procedurals to grace television. I have so enjoyed this atmospheric and intelligent show, with Kevin Whately portraying beloved DI Robbie Lewis working in the academic town of Oxford, England. Fans of ""Inspector Morse""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inspector-Morse-25th-Anniversary-Collection/dp/B008BF7TBY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inspector Morse 25th Anniversary Collection</a>&nbsp;will know DI Lewis as the long-suffering DS Lewis who worked for DCI Morse (John Thaw). Morse remains an iconic TV series in the annals of British television, but I have a special fondness for ""Inspector Lewis"" possibly because I loved seeing how much DI Lewis has grown into his own consummate detective and have greatly enjoyed the banter between Lewis and his underling, the gifted and cerebral, Cambridge-educated DS James Hathaway (Lawrence Fox).

For those new to ""Inspector Lewis"", I'd recommend watching this stellar series beginning with Season One as the characters evolve quite a bit over the course of the seasons and this is especially so in the case of the relationship between DI Lewis and DS Hathaway, from a certain wariness and awkwardness to one of grudging respect and affection, and a genuine friendship between the two men.

There is much to recommend this series to the discerning viewer - picturesque Oxford, literary references, and riveting plots, not to mention the excellent ensemble cast including, pathologist and love interest Dr. Laura Hobson (Clare Holman), and Chief Superintendent Jean Innocent (Rebecca Front).

In this last season, there are three episodes:
Down Among the Fearful - when the body of a psychic named Randolph James is discovered in his rented office space, the detectives discover that the psychic was actually a psychologist Reuben Beatty who was debunking afterlife theories. Both Lewis and Hathaway try to unmask the truth behind the murdered man's double life but find they are making little headway until Hathaway finally uncovers a clue. This is not one of my favorite episodes in the series but it kept my interest nevertheless.

The Ramblin' Boy - An old colleague of Lewis, Chief Supt. Jack Cornish, goes missing while a body turns up. The case is a curious one since the discovered body turns out to be the remains of a man that has already been embalmed! Hathaway is not in on the case until the very end as he is away on leave, working on a charity-based project in Kosovo, although Lewis manages to rope him in to help out in the end. There's also the usual student and faculty politics centering around the university, and how all this is related makes for an engaging episode. In the midst of his investigations Lewis, who is temporarily assisted by the affable DC Gray, begins to make some progress in his budding romance with pathologist, Dr. Laura Hobson. I loved this episode for many reasons but primarily because viewers finally get to see Lewis and Hobson make a serious go at romance and also there's a surprising revelation towards the end (by DC Gray) that will have long-term fans of the show get all misty-eyed.

Intelligent Design - this last episode is also one of the best of the series. Lewis and Hobson get more serious amidst the backdrop of a perplexing case. A professor of chemistry at Oxford who was recently released from prison (for the death of a young girl while he was driving under the influence) is found murdered outside his home, a victim of homicide. The list of suspects grows longer as another gruesome discovery is made. The body of a young Korean exchange student who went missing 15 years ago shows up when part of the college undergoes renovation. Are the two deaths linked? I found this to be a riveting episode as it is so well-written and the list of suspects makes it even more interesting. Also, this final episode sees Lewis and Hobson begin to make some serious long-term decisions regarding their relationship while Hathaway struggles with his inner self regarding his own future in the force.

To sum it up, I will miss both DI Lewis' casual observances of life and the motives that drive people to commit the most heinous crimes, and of course, the divine DS Hathaway's cerebral takes on various subjects, not to mention the enjoyable banter between the two, who have become beloved characters to fans of the series. It is a pity there are only three episodes this final season, but I wish both actors the very best in their future endeavors.",1372636800,2,4557,5.0855614973262036

If you are new to Inspector Lewis, definitely watch the other seasons as well.",1372550400,2,251,4.413043478260869
5299217,5,B009AF5OY8,"Just the right amount of snark, sass, and humor, with just a bit of drama to let you know they're supposed to be investigating a serious crime - usually murder.  These two characters work well together, just like their real-life counter-parts.",1372464000,,243,4.926829268292683

5299221,5,B009AF5OY8,I am a long time fan of these characters. I have been watching Lewis since his beginnings with Morse. I loved Morse and now I adore Lewis. I find it so artful the way they've carried on so elegantly and seamlessly. My favorite part is the reversal - Hathaway is Lewis' new Morse in so many ways. He has Morse's personality in many ways and yet he's fresh and new. So well written!,1372377600,,380,4.219178082191781

5299223,5,B009AF5OY8,This is a great extension of Morse and I have enjoyed every season but it appears this may be the last.  If anyone has any info for future productions in the works I would love to know.,1372377600,,185,4.0
5299224,5,B009AF5OY8,"I watched the three episodes in the order intended without the knowledge this was the last season for the series. Not knowing made the last program ""Intelligent Design"" have a very surprising effect. I realized Robbie Lewis and James Hathaway had become almost like family. The ending is gentle enough but as I always am when losing a family member I became very sad. For a program to have this effect on me speaks volumes about the very excellent quality of the series. Now that I have series 1 through 6 I know I'll watch these programs again thereby making this ""A Long Goodbye"".
Laurence Fox and Kevin Whatley somehow capture a ""police partner"" reality perfectly. Fox shines especially, as a perfect understudy to Whatley's seasoned no nonsense veteran. The chemistry between these guys is remarkable though the reluctant Hathaway seems to eschew any kind of close personal tie the riveting connection between them cannot be mistaken. The Season 6 DVD is well worth the price just to watch their relationship if nothing else.",1372377600,6,1029,4.919540229885057
5299225,5,B009AF5OY8,"Veteran actors Kevin Whately and Laurence Fox portray Detective Inspector Lewis and Sergeant Hathaway in what may be the final three mysteries of the expertly written and brilliantly performed series that began with a pilot in 2005 as a sequel to the extremely popular Inspector Morse series (1987-2000).  In many respects, the chemistry and working relationship between the affable and efficient Inspector Lewis and the thoughtful, intellectual Sergeant Fox was more affirming and less caustic than that between the grumpy, brilliant Morse and his more steady side kick Sergeant Lewis.  Set in the beautiful, captivating ancient city and colleges Oxford University, the mysteries during the period from 2005 to 2013 have retained their intelligence, depth and twists that keep mystery buffs guessing while incorporating the new technology and relevance to an age of wireless communications and smartphones.  All three episodes in this set offer clever, well crafted mysteries.  The final one -- Intelligent Design -- shows Lewis move towards relaxing and fulfilling retirement and happy marriage to Dr. Hobson in a much more satisfying conclusion than the lonely, anguished death of Morse in Remorseful Day.  Great as it was, the Morse series starring the incomparable John Thaw has been ably succeeded and possibly even surpassed by the Inspector Lewis series.  Given that Lewis, Hathaway and Hobson are alive and well at the end of this series, a revival is at least possible.  (Kevin Whately, born February 6, 1951, is now age 62. Suitable retirement age?  Actor John Thaw was barely 60 when he died of cancer in 2002, soon after the Morse character's demise in Remorseful Day in 2000.)",1372291200,3,1690,5.256505576208179
5299226,5,B009AF5OY8,"This has been by far one of the best series; and these two episodes, ""Down Among the Fearful"" and ""Ramblin' Boy"" seem to be tying up loose ends in case they don't come back for what Kate Bain of ITV called, ""a one off"", or ""revamped series"". With exceptional writing; great storylines and the acting of Kevin Whately, Laurence Fox, Clare Holman and Rebecca Front making the characters of Colin Dexter come to life, one could almost expect to see them behind a desk or walking the streets of Oxford solving crimes, or hanging out @ the local Pub. If you haven't joined all of us who've followed Inspector Lewis, it's not to late, you won't be disappointed.",1372291200,3,655,4.559322033898305

5299238,5,B009AF5OY8,"Happy because I have so missed Lewis and Hathaway and all, I am delighted they are back!
This first episode lives up to the preceding seasons, complex, interesting, involving and  beautifully filmed.  Each year we learn a little bit more about Hathaway, and watch the relationship between the two men develop.  In this program, the growth and honesty is handled very subtly, but it is touchingly done.  BYW....correct me if I'm wrong, but I SWEAR I saw Colin Dexter in the museum scene, doing his Alfred Hitchcock appearance thing.
I can't wait for next week and the rest of the season!",1371427200,13,586,4.772277227722772

5299241,4,B009AF5OY8,"I bought the UK DVD release last February both because I knew it would be out months later here, (at the rate PBS is showing things you might get the U.S. release first too) and I was in a hurry to see some good British TV. I think this, the last of Lewis, might be better that what in the U.S. is called ""Season Five"", not much to complain about here. I found the Lewis/Hobson romance (hinted at in the past season or so) a bit rushed and thought another episode length could've been used to develop things a bit better but the main parts of the episodes are well worthwhile.

I'd read online in the British paper ""The Telegraph"" that this would be the end, Kevin Whately saying Lewis was of retirement age and that he & costar Laurence Fox both wanted to move on- he was open to ""one-offs"" so maybe we'll get more Lewis yet.
The British edition has no extras other than subtitling, doesn't look like the U.S. will either.
I'll be buying the U.S. release in Blu ray, I'm sure it'll look great, I know the stories are and the location Oxford area locations always are!",1369008000,44,1068,4.313432835820896

  I have not seen the last new series Seven yet . I can't wait to see them ! Yes I will be sad to see LEWIS end .
 I have purchased from Amazon.com  the complete "" Lewis "" series 1-5 in the Region 2 version !This verifies that this new final season is after all "" Series Seven "" as they say in the UK .

8538364,5,B009AF5OY8,"Well, clearly I have been under a rock for a few years as I did not watch any of this until a month ago.  Then I could not stop.  Went thru all 8 seasons very quickly.  Loved everything about this series - character development was outstanding, acting was superb, and very refreshing to focus on how the crime got solved without any shooting or blowing things up.  Refreshing.  Simply an outstanding series.

I do wish they produced another series with Hathaway as the main character... That would be very interesting.",1526342400,,518,4.7
8538365,3,B009AF5OY8,It's still great acting and all but to call three episodes a series is just short of a ripoff. Too much for too little. Kind of the sign of the times.,1524614400,,150,3.870967741935484
8538366,5,B009AF5OY8,One of the best series on television. Ever. I wish that the US could lay claim to anything even remotely as fine. Whately and Fox's chemistry is so good---the last scene (last series) when Lewis goes to New Zealand made me cry buckets. I wish it could have continued...,1524614400,,269,4.510204081632653

8538369,5,B009AF5OY8,I loved Endeavour and The Morse series.  Since Inspector Lewis was the partner of Morse it seemed like a fit to me. I really like The Inspector Lewis series also...a lot.

Speaking as an American who is more than tired, of the ""spectacular effects"" thrown in, seemingly to offer violence only, I welcome these; Hathaway and Morse's old sidekick, Robbie Lewis characters, who do it all, sans firearms (although I admit that there are times that had these people had them, they could protect themselves. I love the scenery. England is among the most beautiful places I've ever seen, and Oxford has those canal houseboats.

8538373,5,B009AF5OY8,"Fantastic series. Didn't think Lewis could carry Morse's water, but in his own, warm-hearted way, Lewis + Hathaway = Morse + Lewis.  Lews remains the ""normal"" person, coping with and copiously appreciating the genius of first the Detective Inspector above him, and then the Detective Sergeant under him.

Would love to see Hathaway and Maddox continue the tradition, but it sounds like Laurence Fox is ready to move on, and they're not going out of their way, so far, to develop Maddox's character.  Too bad.  :o(",1513728000,,513,4.930232558139535
