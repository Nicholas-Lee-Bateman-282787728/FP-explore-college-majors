If you're a fan, then you probably already know most of their original German songs and this DVD of a live concert is amazing. The concert is great and the short documentary on the DVD is also great. I highly recommend it to all fans and I think everyone should get it.",1232323200,,351,4.101449275362318
2549918,5,B000F2CAPQ,"this dvd is awesome I can watch it on my dvd player,unlike the Spring Nicht dvd that only plays on a computer, I found out about this band from my aunt.she's from Germany. she lives in the USA now.",1231286400,,197,4.076923076923077
2549919,5,B000F2CAPQ,"This DVD is one of the best live DVDs I've seen in years (only second to their Zimmer 483 DVD). This gives a great view of what a Tokio Hotel concert it. The subtitles are great and the amount of energy that is featured in this live show is amazing. The special features are great, showing just how fun and lively the boys of Tokio Hotel are and it's fun to see how they've matured from these star struck teens to these sure and confident young men. A great addition to any Tokio Hotel collection.",1227744000,4,497,4.242105263157895
2549920,5,B000F2CAPQ,"This is their first (of hopefully many) taped concerts (yay!!!..new 2 disc 2007 European tour DVD coming on 10/2/07), this one, performed  in Oberhausen, Germany.  If you are a TH fan you'll love it and if you're new to TH you're gonna get hooked.  These dudes rock better than anyone has been rocking America in years and JEEZ they're only teens!  If you like to try new things then try this and become a Tokio Hotel fan.  Entirely in German.  My DVD is PAL standard - non playable on US machines (unless you're like me) so unless you've got a machine that can play European recordings make sure the version you buy is NTSC format.  C'mon Universal....bring the boys to the US AND make their stuff more available. Thanks to Amazon UK I managed to get this copy mailed from Moscow, Russia to Honolulu, Hawaii (might be my fault too for having to get it as soon as it was released.)  The comments that the other reviewer made about subtitles refer strictly to comments or announcements that Bill made to the crowd during the concert.  The special feature section is also subtitled. None of the singing is subtitled.",1188086400,13,1114,4.585858585858586
2549921,5,B000F2CAPQ,yeah so because I live so freakin far away from Germany its not possible for me to see this band live so I got this DVD. I don't know what to say about it. Only the fact that I love it when they perform live OH MAN 1 whole hour of extacy is how I would describe it. Anyway before I made my purchase I made sure that this DVD had English subtitles. My search finally ended here.,1182729600,8,377,3.8461538461538463

8116635,5,B000F2CAPQ,This is a great item for a Tokio Hotel fan who has never been to a concert. It's like having the band play at your house.,1383004800,,121,3.6923076923076925
8116636,5,B000F2CAPQ,"It was a wonderful concert and the subtitles were a big help, as I do not speak German. I highly recommend.",1370995200,,107,4.142857142857143
8116637,4,B000F2CAPQ,This is Tokio Hotel's first live dvd and one of their best.

8116639,5,B000F2CAPQ,"Tokio Hotel is one of my favorite Band from Germany, besides Superstar NENA. I loved the HUMANOID DVD cd and the DVD and I ordered this one as well, because I love this album, which I have in CD.",1354924800,,195,4.0256410256410255

8116641,5,B000F2CAPQ,"Not only was it a good concert, but it had a documentary video that was nice, too. Has English subtitles, but only while people speak, not for the song lyrics (thats the only draw back).",1304294400,,186,4.3428571428571425
