8056495,5,B0009298ZC,"I bought this DVD based on its positive reviews.  Needless to say, this purchase has exceeded my expectations.  Ray teaches independence in a way that is easy to grasp.  His exercises are pretty advanced, but if taken slowly, prove to be very beneficial.  My favorite exercise is the 3 and 4 patterns.  He demonstrates the left hand playing in groups of three around the left side of the kit (snare, hi tom, and hi hat).  The right hand plays the rest (snare, hi tom, mid tom, and floor tom).  The exercise helps create independence with two different time feels.  Brilliant!  This DVD is a great tool for modern drumming.",1413244800,,622,4.63302752293578
8056496,5,B0009298ZC,"I bought this dvd upon the advice of one of the guys at my local Guitar Center.  It is an excellent product!!!  Not really familiar with Ray Luzier prior to this, I didn't know what to expect.  Ray takes you through simple exercises, from beginner to intermediate and even onto advanced skills, slowly showing each step along the way so you can easily follow what he's doing.  For as much as I admire guys like Thomas Lang, his level of dvd tuition is very advanced, this dvd from Ray Luzier is a very practical tool for drummers on any level, in any style.  It teaches simple double bass technique, how to improve your double bass, but also how to use it effectively, not just thunderously.  He also shows rhythmic independence with the hands while playing double bass patterns and ostinatos.  Mostly a rock drummer, Ray uses examples to show some good funk grooves, using ghost notes, accents, and many of the basic rudiments found in all drumming styles today.

A must have for any drummer!!!!  I'd buy this again, for my drummer friends!",1234915200,2,1041,4.644808743169399
8056497,4,B0009298ZC,"This dvd is an amazing and clear guide where you can find excelent performances from Ray himself along with brilliant musicians (Billy Sheehan on bass and great guitar player Toshi Hiketa), but the essential topics are related to the understanding and practice of the key concepts for approaching the hard rock drumming: hand and foot motion, double bass rhythms and fills, etc... everything you want to become a great perfomance and studio rock drummer.",1178928000,2,454,5.148648648648648
