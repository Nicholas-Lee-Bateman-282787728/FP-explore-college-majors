7861061,5,6304095783,"This was my oldest daughters favorite movie when they were little (15 yrs ago) and my youngest recently found Barney. So yeah it was definately worth buying this movie all over again. Our favorite song on this 2 pack vhs is
 'There's A Wiggle In My Toe' by Joe Scruggs and the old favorite
 'If All The Raindrops Were Ice-Cream'
For a vhs tape they were remarkably durable since my first set just wore out a few mths ago after 15 yrs. :-D",1251849600,,438,4.265060240963855
7861062,1,6304095783,"I ordered this video in Spanish. The sound was of very poor quality, as was the picture. I kept adjusting the tracking and the volume, but in the end I ended up throwing the video away. It was a waste of money. Other Spanish language videos have been okay, but not Barney's.",983145600,,274,4.288461538461538
7861063,5,6304095783,I really loved this very active video.  My children really got into it.  We all got up and sang and danced.  I am going to get it for my sister's kids for Christmas.  We watch it almost every day.,974160000,2,196,3.948717948717949
