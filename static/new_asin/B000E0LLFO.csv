2476102,3,B000E0LLFO,"Lisa Bonet,one of the original Cosby Show cast members and the star of the spinoff A Different World's first season,was written out for season 2. Bonet continued her role of Denise Huxtable on TCS on a recurring basis in 1988-89(recurring in 1987-88 as well)and returned as a regular from fall 1989 to spring 1991. Like I said in the review for the season 1 set,this is another hit creation of comedian Bill Cosby's,who's the principal star of TCS. Cosby's other hit creations are the Fat Albert and the Little Bill cartoons. Producers Tom Werner and Marcy Carsey had another hit show in 1988-89,the ABC Emmy-winner Roseanne which was cancelled in 1997. Werner and Carsey also produced ABC's Grace Under Fire and CBS's Cosby,the latter which starred Cosby and Phylicia Rashad,who was Cosby's TCS co-star as well. Great cast consisting of Jasmine Guy,Sinbad,Darryl Hill and Cree Summer. ADW was still set in Hillman College,located in the real world in Atlanta. It was written that Denise Huxtable had dropped out of Hillman and sought various jobs. When Cosby personally pulled the plug on TCS in 1992,ADW stayed on NBC for one more season,just like Cheers,another Emmy-winner,did.",1142899200,5,1181,5.092783505154639

2476104,4,B000E0LLFO,"(This is a review on the second season of ""A Different World."" I loved this show, and I've made it clear from my review of the first season that this second season improved the entire series by 100%!

Some people liked what I said, some people didn't. Please remember, though, I LOVE THIS SHOW. I watch it every day on the Oxygen chanel. I am it's NUMBER ONE FAN. I said what I said with love, not to hurt anyone's feelings. With that said, here goes...)

After the audience-popular (but critically panned) first season, Lisa Bonet's charecter was written out, the excuse being that she ""dropped-out"" and went back home. In reality, she had become pregnant by husband rocker Lenny Kravitz over the summer and chose not to return. Bonet returned to The Cosby Show although she would be in a more background role, showing up less and less as time progressed.

This was also the final episode for Marisa Tomei, who went on to other projects until in 1992 when she won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her work in the film ""My Cousin Vinny."" Now that's a huge leap!

As the producers were really left in a bind as to who the show's ""stars"" would be (and the show's future in general), they made the miraculous choice of hiring actor/director Debbie Allen of ""Fame"" fame to become a ""mechanic"" of sorts to repair what damage she could.

Her first choice was to get new writers and to take other smaller charecters and put them into the spotlight. No one officially was given the center spot, but as a whole the entire cast (with additions Charnele Brown as Kim, Cree Summer as Winnie, Glynn Turman as Col. Taylor, Darryl M. Bell as Ron and comedian Sinbad as house director Walter) shared the spotlight at one time or another durinbg the show.

(A note of trivia: From 1978 to 1984, Turman was married to Aretha Franklin, who began singing the show's theme song this season!)

It has to be admitted, though, that Jasmine Guy as Whitley and Kadeem Hardison as Dwayne as leftovers from the first season were thrust forward, and it is noticable as love blossomed between them, although one-sidedly. We would have to wait another season before they took the ""next step.""

Allen's second choice was to get the writers to make college life at Hillman more Afrocentric, as it was a primarily a southern Black college in the first place. It is reflected, and no pun intended, from Season 1 to Season 2 literally from night to day. There were very few White college students, and subsequently in later seasons the only times you would see them was when they visited from neighboring Avery college. I for one was glad that she went in this direction.

There have been so many shows that were on TV that featured college life, but in 1988, the Black experience in college was not portrayed in such an expansive form. This series from this point on began to reflect a truer sense of Black college life, and the season tackled some pretty serious subjects right out of the gate, from censorship (remember Dapper D's tape?) to date rape (Winnie and Garth Parks in his convertible) to college life's pressures (Kim having three jobs and getting burned out, Kim getting pregnant - maybe).

During this season, they also began to depend LESS and LESS on The Cosby Show to 'cross over' and 'promote' the series, as the series began to find it's legs (and favor from the critics). The Cosby clan only landed on Hillman's doorstep once during this season, when boy-crazy Vanessa wanted to see the college and Clair attends a seminar on campus. THANKFULLY, this is one of the last times they all appear like this. They also brought in seasoned veteran Black actors for re-occurring roles such as the venerable Roscoe Lee Browne to the tremendous Rosalind Cash, and to bring in a few other guest stars like singer Gladys Knight.

Jesse Jackson makes a memorable appearance (he had just missed out on the Democratic ballot for the Presidency), and for the first time we meet Diahann Carroll as Whitley's mother Marion (for her work in this episode, she was nominated for an Emmy as Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy).

(Another bit of trivia: The show finished for the year #3 in the Nielsen ratings behind 'The Cosby Show' and 'Roseanne.')

Now, as for the DVD itself, as of the date of this review they have not offered their contents, but I just HOPE that after the disasterous mistakes they made on the First Season's discs (from lousy packaging, misleading images on the cover - I mean, half the people on the cover WEREN'T EVEN THERE - and the 'lost episode' that they could have waited to show until the SIXTH SEASON where it belongs and keep it in chronological order), they re-package it correctly and feature the players that actually are in the season ! ! !

I am especially VERY afraid that Amazon is still showing the disclaimer of:
""Note on DVD sets: During shipping, discs in multidisc sets occasionally become dislodged without damage. Please examine and play these discs. If you are not completely satisfied, we'll refund or replace your purchase.""

Let's face it - the packaging was lousy, and could be crushed if you just looked at it, and I wince at the cover because of the DECEPTIVE TRICKERY they used to sell the first series. It is a sad waste, especially for the price they were asking. This time around, this price is more reflective, since I think I'm going to yet again pay for a lackluster and simply SHODDY packaging treatment of a fantastic show, and that is a SHAME.

I've seen 50 year-old Norwegian bas-relief cartoon DVDs get better treatment ! ! ! GET ON THE BALL, FOLKS ! ! !

All in all, this season proved to me that there was hope yet for this series. I had faith in it then, and that I hope that even after almost 15 years, is still running another 15. I just hope the garbage-like DVD boxes they come in at least last the shipping process to my house so I can see it for myself.",1136678400,52,5911,4.582386363636363
2476105,4,B000E0LLFO,"When Lisa Bonet left A Different World, the show became 8 million times better.  She was so whiny and annoying.

But for a series where the characters we know and love were not even the focus of the show until the second season then it is kinda hard to do this.  I suggest to everyone who wants to see this show on DVD to buy 2 or 3 copies of the first season.  That way we can show the big bad company how much money is to still be made.  And we the people will actually get the shows we want.  I can't wait to re-live the first DWANE! out of Whitley's mouth and there first kiss, even when they got married the show was still good with the whole RON, Kim, Freddie triangle.

The order came and I watched the dvds slowly but surely because I was in school and studying for finals. The episodes were not labled and they weren't even seperated by season. After noticing that there were some missing episodes(I know them all) and some had digital flaws (skipping and distorted pictures), I contacted the supplier, dcmagicbox.com, and was told that since it had been over 30 days since my order, I was not eligible for a replacement or refund.

It's a shame that in this age, where ""Keeping up With the Kardashians"" can be put out on DVD, that fans need to beg for classic favorites.

If the current owner of the rights to this show are reading, please release all seasons of ""A Different World"" on DVD.  I am willing to re-purchase season 1 if you can release the ""originally aired"" episodes, and not the syndicated.
