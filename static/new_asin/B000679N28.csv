8039585,3,B000679N28,"First up on this collection of Classic TV shows with a Christmas Theme is The Red Skelton Show, in the III act ""Freddie & The Yuletide Doll."" Frequent jitters, off and on ""Platinum DVD"" branding, and a few VHS tape like lines occasionally distract from this b&w, music filled comedic classic.
Running time: 23 minutes.

Next up, two Christmas Episodes of the Beverly Hillbillies. ""Christmas At The Clampetts"" and ""Home For Christmas."" Both episodes start with that awful faux theme that often mars this show on cheap DVD collections. Generally crisp b&w, with some artifacts.
Running time: approx 25 minutes (per episode)

Then there are two episodes of the Jack Benny Program: ""The Christmas Show"" (aka ""Christmas Shopping Show"" 15 December 1957) and ""The New Year's Show."" (31 December 1961) The Christmas show is not appropriate for youngsters as an off-camera suicide is involved.
Running time: 27 minutes, each show.

Two Dragnet shows round out the collection. They are: ""Big Little Jesus"" (24 December 1953) and ""Big .22 Rifle For Christmas."" (18 December 1952). The Big Little Jesus was network tv's first half hour color program; and the only color program of the classic Dragnet series. Too bad it is in black and white on this dvd! Artifacts galore, but very much worth the watch.
Be warned that ""Big .22 Rifle"" revolves around the death of a child. Hardly holiday fare.
Running time per episode: about 26 minutes.",1157414400,,1425,4.9789915966386555
