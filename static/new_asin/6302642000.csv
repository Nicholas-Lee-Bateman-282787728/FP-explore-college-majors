494584,4,6302642000,"The film image is very good.  It is clear, with a broad range of graytones, the details of the image is good, and the sound is good (it is 1933, remember).  It seems amazing such a film has been so well preserved.  They did not go back to the negative to do any scratch-removal treatment, so there is some white dust floating around, but I didn't really notice it much except during fade-outs.  So, four and a half stars for the quality of the film on the dvd.  The movie itself is a different matter...  More like 3 stars, for an overall 4-star rating:

I did not originally look at this film as a ""Keaton"" film, so I did not experience the deep disappointment expressed by some writers about this film.  Rather, I sought this out as a Jimmy Durante movie.  Some of us LIKE Jimmy Durante.  He isn't a stuntmeister and he isn't much of a dancer, but his energy and timing are exceptional, and his ability to suddenly flail about then stop abruptly is pantomimic.  I love his cartoonish look, his voice, and find his throwaway Malapropisms hilarious.  He has theatrical charisma, and he was an original.  I love to watch him go nuts, and there is plenty of Durante going nuts in this film.

The problem has always been to find a ""Jimmy Durante movie"" that really shows him off.  A ""good"" Jimmy Durante movie (heh)...  Hollywood never knew how to use Durante as a leading comic.  Too bad he wasn't a story writer himself or had his own throttle of sympathetic gagmen like Harry Langdon had, or Harold Lloyd.  (Of course at MGM, this wouldn't matter; Keaton did have a core group of creative talent before it was dismantled by his new employers.)  Nevertheless, I've found a few Durante movies that are entertaining enough to be fairly satisfying even without offering the final word on Durante's talents, and ""What, No Beer?"" is fair.

The best thing about this film is that is moves along briskly. Often I wished the director had used more imagination and gotten more gags out of a scene (or at least some gags), or more action out of a gag, but nothing went on so long that I was bored... just a little worn down by Durante's blustering; he certainly plays his part VERY vociferously!  But his energy does much to keep the movie from flagging.  Also the editing is pretty good: each shot leads to the next fairly quickly, and most scenes do not last too long (the beer-making scene is too long, but at least it's lively).

The physical humour is watered down, but occasionally this works to the advantage of the comedy.  For instance, when Durante is shaving Keaton, and the barber's chair slips down, the two actors begin to disappear at the bottom of the frame.  Then there is an edit and we see the two tumbling over each other onto the floor.  Probably, Durante didn't want to take the fall; but seeing them disappear in shot 1, and roll out of the chair on shot 2 is really quite funny.  My jaw didn't drop at any amazing stunt, but I couldn't help but smile.  The scene with the barrels chasing Keaton down the hill is certainly not well mined for comedy (the 3 Stooges are actually more imaginative with the same idea), but it's still a nice moment of some ""big"" comic damage; too bad it doesn't involve the bootlegging gang a little more in the chaos, and too bad there weren't more scenes like this in the movie to give Keaton a little more room to breath.

The voting scene had just the right unexpected silliness and timing to make me laugh, particularly the two bits with the unseen female voter.  ""What, No Beer?"" does not have enough of these types of scenes to merit multiple viewings, but it offers a fun hour if you like Durante and don't mind seeing Keaton as an ""actor"" in someone else's movie.  I did not notice any unusual lethargy or slurred speech from Keaton.  He plays his character with a calmness that works in favor of the story; his voice is distinctive, not low and harsh as many have opined.  If Keaton's personal life had not been in such a shambles at this time, he might have finished out his contract with MGM, not been virtually blacklisted from the movies, and perhaps negotiated something better in his next contract.  After all, these films were extremely successful moneymakers.  But, history is history.  At least he continued on to make ""Jail Bait"", ""Le roi des Champs-Elyses"", and ""A Pest from the West"".",1321660800,7,4347,4.52112676056338
494585,2,6302642000,"""What! No Beer?"" (1933) is a terribly uneven Prohibition-era comedy with some classic Buster Keaton moments undercut by the irritating verbiage of Jimmy Durante. Despite his alcoholic condition (evident in several scenes), Buster makes the most of his non-Durante sequences - recreating the ""Seven Chances"" climax with beer barrels replacing boulders. Though a box-office hit, MGM fired Keaton for his uncontrollable drinking and the comic legend never starred in another Hollywood feature. Regardless of the sad ironies associated with Keaton's life and career, ""What! No Beer?"" is worth a look - just fast-forward past the Durante segments.",1102464000,3,642,5.628865979381444
494586,4,6302642000,"What! No Beer? plots Keaton and Durante trying out a beer selling biz starting the day after beer is voted legalized following prohibition. Figuring that the masses will be starved for legalized beer after waiting  13 years, these guys would be the first to sell it again and become  millionaires overnight. They get involved with 2 bootleggers who are  paranoid about losing their shirts because of the new legislation and a  mess involving gangsters and bullets continues throughout the picture.  Buster plays his typical babe-in-the-woods character, Elmer.
The old  brewery they use looks like a grounded UFO in an Area 51 room.  I kept  expecting Ming the Merciless to creep out the hatch. Instead the boys are  overwhelmed by near-beer suds that flood the room in a pretty good choatic  scene that's one of the highlights of the picture.
What! No Beer? was  filmed during the worst period of Buster's life, mainly because of his  battle with alcoholism. The problem is obvious in a few scenes.  One in  particular is a scene of Keaton and Durante handcuffed together. Buster  looks dazed, puffy and sick. The scene continues with Durante talking to  Bus in a normal-sounding voice (the only time in the picture he isn't  screaming) as he carries on a sympathetic conversation with Bus, who  definitely sounds like he'd been drinking beforehand. A minute later, the  scene continues where Buster further slurs his lines.
This film was made  at the end of 1932 and was a big hit for MGM. The print on this VHS edition  is excellent. I was surprised to see that such good quality sound existed  in 1932. Film critics, historians and Buster are hard on this picture  because they compare it to his silent classics instead of accepting it for  what it was, a sound comedy with lots of talk and chaos. It's quickly paced  and there's never a dull moment.
The plot of this film involves alcohol,  which ironically is what ruined Buster's career as a major feature-length  movie star. He was let go from MGM a few days after this film completed its  shooting.",961200000,19,2056,4.797142857142857

7829432,3,6302642000,"What,No Beer?(released Feb/33)stars,among others,Buster Keaton,Jimmy Durante and Ed Brophy. This film is not as bad as all the critics and biographers would have you believe. The Passionate Plumber is far worse than this,and I would say it is about on a par with Speak Easily.
The story finds Keaton playing Elmer Butts(there's a dig from Keaton in there to his bosses somewhere!)a taxidermist. His friend Durante is a barber. With the repeal of prohibition getting voted on and accepted,but without waiting for a Federal repeal into law,Jimmy decides to borrow Keaton's $10,000 to buy a local brewery that has been sitting vacant since 1919. It's a get rich quick scheme for sure. First night they hire three tramps using their brewery as a home. One of them has a stutter,and who we learn later just happens to be a master brewer. For now Jimmy won't let him try to utter one sentence as his patience runs dry(no pun intended) very fast. They stumble their way along and finally get their stuff ready to sell right at the brewery. However since it is still illegal,the cops swoop in and close the guys down. However when their concoction is analyzed it is more like tea instead of beer. They are let go.
From here they go into the production of near beer,cutting into the profits of the local gangsters. They aren't amused. One goes into partnership with him while the other is out to stop them. Jimmy has finally gotten the word about his stuttering brew master,who says they can make real beer. He gives the OK but tells everyone not to tell Buster. As one gang boss has got it in for them,their drivers refuse to come to work. Buster ends up delivering it himself. As the gang is about to move in on him ,he gets a flat on a hill. In his attempts to fix it,he inadvertently ends up being chased by his cargo down the hill. This also has the added effect of foiling the hit men. Jimmy arrives and tells Buster that the beer is the real deal.
Meanwhile Buster's crime partner has been killed. The other boss arrives at the brewery and takes over the operation. The cops have now gotten wise to the operation and its now real stuff and are planning a raid. Tipped off by the gang bosses girlfriend,whom Buster has been chasing through the entire film,Buster escapes and flies around town advertising free beer at the brewery. The place is mobbed and the citizenry drink up all the evidence. There is a quick cut to a politician using Busters brewery as one that shut down criminal activity as the result of people storming it. Headlines scream that Beer is now legal. The last scene has Buster and Jimmy now apparently successful and legal brewery men. They are out in a beer garden and making speeches. The film ends as Jimmy holds up a cool draft and blows the foam off the glass telling us""it won't be long now"".
The truth is later that year(/33)in December prohibition was officially repealed by the Feds. It's ironic that Busters last film should be about alcohol,the very thing that really did him in at MGM.His voice was quite deep and he appeared to be in his cups in several scenes. We do know that Buster was showing up late or not at all during filming. Ironically,one thing Buster would chastise the Marx Brothers for when later working for them as a gag man,as being unprofessional. Mayer had enough and fired him outright.
However all is not bad here,as this film is edited quite well;mind you it only lasts just under 70 minutes. The pace is quite good and the story at least keeps you half interested. Buster's writers weren't half bad either,and if his lines were encumbered by him being a little tipsy,the seriousness and direct delivery with which he spoke his lines,actually works FOR him here,as he plays off other characters. Then we have Durante. It seemed with each successive film they did together,Durante got more and more over the top. They really let him loose on this one. I have nothing against Durante,with his continual use of malaprops. This was who he was,he was a great and smart entertainer,one of my favourites. He just didn't belong in a Keaton comedy,although by this stage little could have been done to turn things around for Buster anyways. The writing was definitely on the wall. One of Keaton's best moments occurs with the barrel chase down the hill. It is a re working of Seven Chances, but I found it to be quite effective. And like in many of Keatons films,Buster is enamored by a woman who comes and goes and which inevitably means trouble for him in some fashion or other..
The film is in its fullscreen a/r and is clear and crisp. There are many defects associated with a film of this age that are still evident in this""remastered"" edition.
All in all Keaton goes out with not a bang,but more than a whimper. I found it a mediocre film, but fairly pleasing none the less,not his worst by any stretch at MGM.Remember it WAS a money maker.",1391040000,,4891,4.603665521191294
7829433,4,6302642000,Back in the days when comedy was funny and simple and life  was tough!!!!  Keaton and Durante work very well together.,1387584000,,118,4.571428571428571
7829434,5,6302642000,"Reunited with co-star Jimmy Durante and comedy director Edward Sedgwick, ""What! No Beer?"" was really not a bad picture for the great Buster Keaton to exit on at MGM. Playing yet another ""Elmer"" (MGM must've thought Keaton looked like an Elmer), Keaton is a taxidermist who gets talked into investing in a brewery & thus, being first in line to satisfy the demand once Prohibition ends by his barber friend (Durante). But their manufacturing of ""real beer"" jumps the gun, and they first run afoul of the law, then get caught in the middle of a gang war struggle to take over their brewery. There's some side silliness when Keaton becomes infatuated with one of the gangster's moll. For whatever reason, Durante is particularly loud & annoying in this picture, his rantings making you appreciate the measured subtlety of Keaton, who takes some of the most spectacular pratfalls that most comics wouldn't do on a pile of marshmallows.
WNB is at least as frothy & fun as the brew it creates. The brewery scene is hilariously messy; Keaton dodging a truckload of barrels is a welcome tribute to his climactic boulder-dodging scene in ""Seven Chances"", capped by a sight-gag marathon; and getting half the town to flock to the brewery to drink all the ""evidence"" is a clever solution to the story. Durante steals the closing gag as he holds up a mug of beer, beams to the camera & says ""It won't be long now, folks!"" The End.
The one flaw in the picture is Keaton's pale physical appearance; reportedly, his alcoholism was especially excessive during filming. Thus, there are moments where either deep lines are etched in his face, or he looks slightly puffy & drawn-out. Yet, Keaton was still good, simply because he's Keaton, a master of timing.
After the disappointing ""The Passionate Plumber"", this film is cheerfully unrefined (no pun intended) but consistently funny.
Unfortunately, it wasn't long after WNB that MGM dropped Keaton's contract, and he moved on to other miscellaneous work. A rather sad fate for such a gifted comic genius. But at least we have comedies like this to savor!",1350691200,3,2087,4.848739495798319
7829435,3,6302642000,"Not one of my favorite Buster movies, although as I've said before, I can't get enough Buster.  The poor man was so ill at this period of time, and you can see it: sometimes it seems like it's all he can do to remain upright.

I've read many reviews of this film that seem to mock Buster's alcoholism, which I think is downright nasty.  Put yourself in his place.

But the WORST thing about this film is the MGM-teaming of poor, ill Buster with (gawd) Jimmy Durante.  Polar opposites, but not the kind who have chemistry.  I'm surprised poor Buster managed to get off ANY lines at all with that jumping bean, Jimmy.",1338508800,,615,4.398230088495575
