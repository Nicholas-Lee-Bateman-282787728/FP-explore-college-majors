878214,5,6304369174,"This movie takes alot of flack. In my opinion, anyone who would trash this flick has no right watching a movie entitled ""Maniac Nurses Find Ecstacy"" in the first place...I mean, what do you expect???
This is not high art by any stretch, this is trash cinema at its worst, and it is all the better for it! There is copious amounts of nudity, gore, incest, lesbianism, women with guns, bad acting, atrocious dubbing, a paper thin plot, SM, and no point whatsoever! It is everything I had hoped this movie would be!
It is...Maniac Nurses Find Ecstacy!!!
If you are a fan of truly bad cinema, this is the movie for you! There is no way that this movie was ever meant to be taken seriously, and it really has to be seen to be believed...I couldn't stop laughing!
The DVD has very few extras, with only a handful of trailers and a few of the typical Troma adds. But it is the movie that counts. Depending on you tastes, Maniac Nurses is either a 0/5, or a perfect 5...you can see what side of the arena I'm on!
Love it or hate it, there is really nothing else quite like it.",1095984000,45,1068,4.266009852216749
878215,2,6304369174,"The previous (OBVIOUSLY tongue in cheek.) 5 star review from ""Terrance and Phillip"" should serve to warn viewers of the potential harm that prolonged exposure to intestinal gas can do to one's brain cells. That said, this could possibly be the target audience the makers (Or maybe ""hacks"" would be more apt, given the subject matter) of MANIAC NURSES FIND ECSTASY had in mind.
Also known as BLOODSUCKING FREAKS 2, this Troma release bears no similarity to the ""classic"" gorefest that became the #2 cult film of all time (behind ROCKY HORROR). However, any movie that opens with a dedication to former adult movie queen Traci Lords can't be a complete write-off.
Written, Produced and Directed by Leon Paul De Bruyn, hiding behind the twin psueudonyms of Leon P. Howard and Harry M. Love; MANIAC NURSES FIND ECSTASY features a linking narrative introducing a slum known as Women's Hell USA, in which the viewer is welcomed to come on ""a journey into sickness and sex and violence"". The three compulsory main ingredients for any half decent schlockfest.
Women's Hell is run by the sadistic clinical director Ilsa (Haini Brown). Her payroll includes a bevy of busty beauties with an insatiable lust for blood, sex and violence of the most sadistic kind. One early such anecdote features the nurses chasing down a hapless couple in their ambulance/ makeshift morgue; blowing off the guy's head with a shotgun in classic DAWN OF THE DEAD fashion; then kidnapping his girlfriend and taking her back to the clinic for a quick bondage session and a literal roasting in the sauna.
Another of the nurses, Sabrina (Susanna Mackay) a sultry blond; happens to be obsessed with comic books featuring Nazis and serial killers such as Ed Gein: who; as anyone who knows anything about horror movies will know, was the inspiration for TCM's Leatherface. Of course, all this pulp horror feeds her insatiable appetite for pure unadulterated sadism- especially in  a memorably dumb sequence where the culprits' names flash below the screen; which given the aforementioned target audience may actually have been quite a clever idea.
Also of note is an extended mumbo-jumbo narrative arrangement featuring a '70s style hypnosis device and topless dancing. Sure, bare breasts always fare well in this genre, but I was left wondering what the point was.
Basically if you want to spend over an hour watching a group of sexy, psychotic neo-Nazi lesbians massacring people and ""exploring perversity to its limits"" as the narrator puts it; MANIAC NURSES ought to be your kind of movie. A special highlight is the blackly funny scene where a guy gets his foot severed with razor wire (You have to see it for yourself). And beyond this roiling sea of bubbling blood and bouncy boobies comes a bravura finale (that is, if your stomach's still up to it) where sultry vixen Sabrina goes on a casual rampage clad in sexy lingerie; which takes a good 10 minutes for her to complete- but I'd imagine climbing two flights of stairs while wearing heels wouldn't be the most comfortable way of doing it. What's wrong with good ol' unsexy tennis shoes?
But what I found most amusing is the fact that ODE TO JOY plays during the end credits! MANIAC NURSES isn't quite up there with Troma classics like TOXIC AVENGER and BLOODSUCKING FREAKS; but its still far superior to some of their lesser efforts like SURF NAZIS MUST DIE and FEMME FONTAINE. Taken purely as a braindead trash movie, MANIAC NURSES is still worth the time of Troma devotees and curious BLOODSUCKING FREAKS fans; though it's lacking the  visceral impact and warped comic genius of Joel Reed's cult classic.",1057017600,6,3631,4.902439024390244
878216,4,6304369174,"This movie is a bad one, make no mistake about it, but bad in such a way that it seems exceptionally funny. This is the kind of movie that you invite friends over to watch, to have a few beers with, and to gather around and take turns making jokes about, laughing at the movie every chance you get.
This is a cult movie in this respect, make no mistake about it. Like most such movies, it is not for everyone's taste. However, if you want to watch something that you can laugh at freely this is the perfect movie for you.
Among the highlights are a paper-thin plot, terrible acting by all concerned, a corny sounding narrator, plenty of skin, and a lot of gratuitous violence. In other words, this is very nearly the perfect movie for me. It is also almost perfect as silly entertainment. I recommend this to all.",1015286400,15,813,4.355263157894737
878217,3,6304369174,"Though the Unbelievable Bad Dubbing of the Dialogue, Coupled with the Horrendous Acting, Scripting, (I have Serious doubts they even Used a Script) Editing and Direction, will give you the Biggest Laughs of your Adult Lives, this is Still a Below average Troma Entry. (Boy, That's saying something)
The Story sounded to Die for. Crazy Homicidal nurses who crave nothing but Sex and Violence, it sounds too Good to be True, and it is. The Film I had in my head after reading the films cover is a Lot Better then the one we actually Get. Don't get me wrong, I still laughed..., but my Expectations were Raised and not met.
The Narration is nothing short of Hysterical, the Dubbing, the Editing... My god, I know I've already Mentioned it all, but.. Man. Troma Fans will be on the Floor with Laughter, the Uninitiated will be in Total Disbelief. The All Female Cast deserve Congratulations for their Looks and they deserve Heckling for their Abilities.
The Troma team have always Prided themselves on their lack of Subtlety and Morals. This film has no Subtlety, but it Does have Morals, and this is it's Major Undoing. Us Wacko's who spend our Hard earned money Hiring and Purchasing these films don't hire and purchase them for their Plots, and we Certainly don't watch them in the hope for a Moral Lecturing. Shame on Troma for Wasting such a Tantalising Set up.
Some of the more Recent Troma releases have seemed to be Forcing themselves to be Bad Movies, which feels false. ""Maniac Nurses find Ecstasy"" doesn't need to force Anything, the Badness comes through on it's own.
This is one for those Die Hard Troma fans only, for the Uninitiated, or the Curious.. Hire ""Tromeo and Juliet"", it has Everything a Great Troma pic Needs.",986515200,7,1730,4.712871287128713
878218,1,6304369174,"I gave this movie 1 star, because there was no way to give it less.  This is the kind of movie that gives gore/sex movies a bad name.  What plot there is is a meandering morass of inscrutable events strung together by inertia.  The sex is softer than the Pillsbury doughboy and less interesting.  The women are attractive, but the characterizations shallow to non-existent.  The display of emotional expressions ranges from slightly alert to stunned.  The quality of transfer was not even very good.  Personally, I'd rather have an old beta format version of ""I Spit on Your Grave.""  Other than these few things, it was swell.
I guess it depends on your boundaries.  For me, if you're thinking about this for the gore, you'll be disappointed.  If you're thinking about this for the sex, you'll be disappointed.  If you're trying to spend down to qualify for Medicaid, why not?
Maybe it's not fair, but I watched this within a few days of seeing ""Cannibal Holocaust,"" so it may have seemed more tame than it really is.....naah.  It just sucks.  But if you need something to go with ""Plan 9"" on the bookcase, knock yourself out.",971222400,11,1126,4.683673469387755

878220,5,6304369174,"Don't let the name fool you.  Maniac Nurses is a tour de force to be reckoned with.  Not since Citizen Kane has a movie been so able to touch the heart and warm the soul with motion picture art of the purest order.  Featuring a variety of characters so intricately arrayed that even Jacques  Shauff would be amazed, and a soundtrack that would bring John Williams to  shame, this shapes up as a film that is a compelling and stirring look into  the psychoses that effect our medical professionals, and the horrid world  that they live in.
Not since the ancient tragedies of Greece has a love  story pulled so heartily on one's emotions.  Duels of lust and loss nearly  brought this viewer to tears, and the sordid affairs of the movie's stars  prove to be quite an intriguing matter indeed.
One is always likely to  think that a novel is not easily made into a motion picture, but the  undying devotion of director Harry M. Love and producer J.B. Casteleyn make  this film the perfect rendition of the original manuscript written by  award-winning author Leon Howard.
This film touches on a wide range of  subject matter, from racial stereotypes to gang warfare to even suicidal  drug abuse.  I don't want to ruin the movie for you, so I won't reveal much  more, but I will say that the movie ends in an unprecedented twist turn the  likes of which never have and never will be seen again.

If Sabrina & Ilsa were in more decent budget movies they could very well be dangerous, and would probably make the Hollywood Red Carpet... it must not be their destany, thats to bad they look like models, they must be pornstars at least...

Probably the best adjective for this atrocity is `unbelievable'! Allegedly it was a Hungarian production directed by a Belgian who can't decide whether he is Harry Love or Leon Paul de Bruyn - it was picked up for distribution by Troma & if they paid more than $2.98 for it they were screwed! Mr de Bruyn also wrote this work of art so he has no one to blame for the resulting mess but himself. Judging by some of the other reviews there are fans of this sort of idiocy so I would like to add some of my own observations - first we have women with names like Ilsa & Greta so you know who they are ripping off, I mean paying homage to! The setting is some dreary hospital / prison & interminable scenes of women in their underwear simulating lesbian sex abound - at other times they are strutting around brandishing machine guns! The story has something to do with a baby with an Elvis tattoo the significance of which eludes me! The attraction for gorehounds can be illustrated by the following charming scenes - a man has his foot severed by a trip wire & is told to `stand up & fight' by a woman with a machine gun - a balding overweight guy with a beard is whipped most unconvincingly - following a strangulation a young woman has something unspeakable done to her with a wooden stake of the type used on vampires but she doesn't get staked in the heart - a young man loses his virginity to Ilsa in the woods & although he did well he gets blown away as soon as he has put his shorts back on - there's another scene of an operation conducted without anaesthetic on another hapless female but my personal favourite concerns our heroine Sabrina played by the delectable Susanna Makay : she is the best thing about the movie but only made this one film as far as I can ascertain. Here goes - Sabrina is toying with yet another innocent (topless) young woman in those woods again - she is wielding a knife when she accidentally treads on a frog which causes her to slit the young woman's throat. If all this motivates you to watch this trash then go ahead!",1248393600,,2216,4.626903553299492

878629,2,6304369174,"Fair, at best.

This runs under 80 minutes, a good 10 from a scene with a nurse dancing on a table, while the narrator blah-blah-blahs about how twisted and sado-masochistic these broads are. Are they really maniacs, and do they find ecstasy?

Half the time, I was saying to myself ""when are these sado-masochistic broads going to show some gory, unadulterated action?""  The movie has its moments, but the narrator spells way to much out, a little too much telling and not enough showing (bordering at insulting).

No, this isn't as good as ""Rabid Grannies,"" but okay for a cheap thrill.  It's not as gory as one would hope, but not bone-dry for that matter.

No, these nurses did not find ecstasy because even the annyoing narrator admits that they are bored. I admit, I was bored too.",1109548800,5,786,4.659420289855072
