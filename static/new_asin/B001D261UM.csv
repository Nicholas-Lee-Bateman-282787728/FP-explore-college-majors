3522195,1,B001D261UM,"I bought this because my son loves Pixar Cars and Roary the Racing car. I had reservations and I should have followed my instincts. The animation is terrible, but what really bothered me was within the first 60 seconds, one of the characters says, ""Get your BIG FAT grille out of my face."" !?!?! Since this isn't the kind of talk we like to hear in our household, I turned it off and deleted it. No returns, so I'm just out the $9.99. Lesson learned.",1356566400,10,450,4.305882352941176

Person collects the Cars moive and added to his collection",1326153600,,147,4.481481481481482
3522197,1,B001D261UM,"I wasn't expecting perfection from a Pixar knock-off, but at least show some class.  The jokes were trashy and many had sexual references that surprised me, since it it geared at kids. The characters were overly cliche and very annoying.  The main character had a very low-self esteem in regard to his love interest. I understand that many kids movies have subtle jokes/references geared at adults.  The key word is ""subtle"".

Thats all I know because I turned it off after 10-15 minutes.  Also there was a plot error - on the box it says the ""champion hasn't lost a race in 8 years"", but in the movie the # of years is different.  I guess they skimped on editors... and everything else about the movie.

Guess I could use the disk as a coaster.",1313884800,2,745,4.474074074074074
3522198,4,B001D261UM,"I brought this for my three year old grandson. His father says he loves it. My son says  the quality of the animation leaves a little to be desired. But it wasn't meant for him. As long as my grandson enjoys it,that's all I ask.",1264809600,2,228,4.066666666666666
3522199,1,B001D261UM,"Wow, I think we all rented/bought this as we'd mistakenly thought it be related to Pixar's movie. Well it fooled the kid, and the adult. I'm glad it was just for 99 cent though via a Redbox than actually having bought this lemon.
pathetic animation,unimaginative stories. Seriously buy your kids a few hot-wheels and have them make up the stories.",1263772800,5,347,4.8
3522200,1,B001D261UM,"I have to agree with the other two reviews: this attempt at a movie is horrible!  My 2-year-old loves the real cars movie, but he won't watch this for 5 minutes without coming to me to ask for a different one.  I bought it because it was only [...] bucks, but that was [...] bucks straight down the drain.  Save your money.",1256342400,7,323,4.17741935483871
3522201,1,B001D261UM,"Save your money. This movie is a cheap attempt to recreate the Disney Pixar Cars story line. The characters are all similar to the Disney Pixar Cars characters but the screen play, the writing and the animation are awful, awful, awful. Even my 5 year old who loves anything with race cars did not like this movie.",1252627200,4,313,4.508771929824562
3522202,1,B001D261UM,"This is lame.  The animation is awful, the voice over weak.  Our son had no interest in watching and the movie annoyed us.  This one goes in the trash and the other two we bought concurrently went back to Amazon.",1246406400,6,212,4.25
