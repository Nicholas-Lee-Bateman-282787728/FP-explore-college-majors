4643628,5,B005BAF5ZY,"Very good for a low budget film tells a good story of a father and daughter
meeting each other after a long time apart.
Theres a lot of action in this film , and i would like to say it was very cool
to see Lance Henriksen as lyle he is just to cool as always .
And Robert Englund as wayne ,,watching him play a tough guy instead of a monster was great and he did a splendid job .
Michael Belveduto as the business man was very cool he is an up and coming actor from NYC known for many independent films its to bad he didn't have a bigger part .
The rest of the cast did a great job on this movie and its worth every penny .
I recommend  it to everyone who loves action films .",1317513600,7,676,3.76056338028169
4643629,4,B005BAF5ZY,"The movie opens with Luke Cain (Robert Patrick of Terminator 2) watching a woman swinging her daughter. They are creeped out by him. A patrol car (one with the means to kill a T-1000) stops by and Cain vanishes. Cain wanders through a small town and buys a locket at a pawn shop. He has few speaking lines. His mannerism are mildly coarse.

The scene shifts to a young girl, Emily (Mika Boorem) on line with someone named ""Lonewolf"" who appears to be an Internet predator, who she plans to meet unbeknownst to her caring mother, Sarah (Samantha Mathis) the town's bartender who has to work a double shift leaving Emily time to visit Lone Wolf at a cafe in a nearby town. Lone Wolf is her estranged father who ""ran with a rough crowd."" Emily uses an old yellow rotor dial phone and a laptop computer.

The movie shifts to a subplot as Wayne (Robert Englund playing a bad guy!) and Lyle (Lance Henriksen) kill a man who stole money from them. The bad guys drive an old brown Cadillac and go out for coffee (minus Lyle).

Everyone is headed to Rose's cafe run by eavesdropping Rose (Kathy Baker), with Hec (Hal Holbrook) as a delightfully feisty 81 year old cook who wants to marry Rose. At the cafe there is an altercation between Cain and the bad guys. After which Cain meets his daughter. As it turns out Cain, who was a badman, stole money from fellow crook and his boss Lyle in order to fund an experimental heart operation for Emily. He has been on the lam for 15 years and now things are coming to a climax at Rose's Cafe.

The movie first builds character and gives us the background information in an entertaining fashion, then the expected drama and action. Mika Boorem gives us an academy award type performance as the daughter. She manages to stand out in a sea of fine actors. Filmed in Bangor, Pa.

The movie is big on character build-up and drama. It is light on action. It is about a father's love and sacrifice for his estranged family and trying to make things right.",1308182400,12,1982,4.434065934065934
8463885,4,B005BAF5ZY,"I have to confess I bought this movie strictly for Joe Flanigan.  However, the whole film is pretty good and kept me on the edge of my seat.  It centers around a young girl who goes to meet the father who left her and her mother years ago.  However,  his arrival in a small town brings his former gang who are out for revenge.
If you are looking strictly to see Joe, his role is pretty small, though as usual he does a great job.  However, if you want to see a good movie that just happens to have Joe in it, I recommend Good Day For It.",1444953600,,537,3.935185185185185
8463886,5,B005BAF5ZY,I loved this movie especially Christian Kane,1435708800,,44,5.428571428571429
8463887,5,B005BAF5ZY,"Movie reviews aren't my forte, having a more musical & A/V equipment enthusiasm, but I like this one enough that I thought I'd give it a try.
To avoid spoiling anything for anyone, I'll just keep it simple.
If you've read some of the more eloquently written reviews, you already know about the story line, so I'll deal more with how the movie makes you feel.

The story is well conceived & realized, with top-notch acting throughout, and the characters are believable in the present, but also all reveal something about their history, and most (but not all!) have a promising future.
The good guys, the bad guys, & everyone in between are all such good actors that whether you love or hate them, or just think they're OK, the film plays with a natural believability that draws you right in.

Mika Boorem, with her warm & gentle, yet vivacious nature, has such an expressive face (love those eyebrows!) and wins your heart right away, and makes one think they'd be proud to have her as a daughter or younger sister.

Robert Patrick, who I remember best from his role as Quicksilver in the Terminator movies, shows his human side: caring and protective yet vulnerable.

Lance Henriksen, who I like best in his role as gentle, loving father in the beginning of Pumpkinhead, is more typically known for being a believable villainous sort, and doesn't disappoint in this film.

Hal Holbrook, who I remember from his role as a professor in Creepshosw (""great shot!"") is a kindly, grandfatherly type but also has a history as a war veteran who is proud and brave.

Kathy Baker is an attractive older lady who seems like someone that you can count on to be caring and sincere, and savvy at the same time.

Robert Englund always seems to be typecast as somone you love to hate (think Nightmare on Elm Street & Eaten Alive), and does a great job acting a lowlife baddie in this movie as well.

Samantha Mathis is great in the role of caring & protective mother in this movie.

So, with all the superb character development, a solid plot and believable story line, this is a very good movie for entertainment value & for the way it makes you feel.",1430697600,,2136,4.585301837270341

8463893,5,B005BAF5ZY,"If I were to cast a movie this is the cast I would want. Kudos to the director and crew for a terrific little thriller. It's too bad that many people will have to come across it the way I did, in a used store. This movie is similar to another well made movie called The Killing Jar (2010).",1381104000,,289,3.9152542372881354
8463894,3,B005BAF5ZY,"I got this for a particular actor who was in it, but have to say that I was disappointed in the movie as a whole.  I felt like the characters and story were a bit under developed, but that is just my opinion.",1379894400,,208,3.8372093023255816
