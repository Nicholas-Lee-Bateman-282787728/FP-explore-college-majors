3680397,5,B001L54TQY,"My favorite part of this DVD so far is the pre-set workouts. They answer the inevitable question I have after months of using a disc- what if I only have 45 minutes but want to do a comprehensive workout? Or just dance? My second favorite part is the upper body routine. The first time I did it, my arms were shaking like mad and I couldn't hold them up by the end. This is good news, as it gives me a routine to keep trying until I actually have some strength in my arms!

The dance routine is relaxing and fun, although I'll have to come back to it when I don't have thin floors and downstairs neighbors. It does involve a bit of hopping around- so much so that Ana actually wears shoes to do it.
The production values are clearly higher in this than previous videos, and I loved the previous videos, so this isn't a complaint at all. Ana is against a landscape background, and the music used features her vocals and some really neat rhythms. I think I prefer the yoga portion of this disc to the dance, but that's just my orientation. It offers a separate tutorial on all of the dance moves (if, like me, you can't samba to save your life).
When I finish this routine I feel a lot lighter and as though I've really cleared out energy blockages within.

At this point new Ana and Ravi DVDs are such a treat in my life- they single-handedly turned me on to kundalini yoga with their modern and playful approach. I love watching Ana, as she's truly radiant. And the blonde is her natural color! I'd never have guessed.",1234915200,7,1518,4.304195804195804
3680398,5,B001L54TQY,"Like the previous review said, it is going to be very difficult to explain all the good things that this DVD has to offer.  Here's a what I like about it:
1.  This DVD has cardio, yoga, strength training, stretching and meditation all in one.  Not only that, you (the viewer) are able to choose to do as many different chapters or as few as you have time to practice.  Here is a basic breakdown of the chapters:

a.  Intro (1:21 min)
b.  Warm-Up (5:13)
c.  Stretch and Core (15:32)
d.  Core Plus (7:41)
e.  Kundalini Cardio (15:02)
f.  Cool Down ((3:16)
g.  Upper Body Tone (11:03)
h.  Relaxation (5:17)
i.  Chanting & Closing (about 13 minutes total)
j.  Extended Cardio ( 21:00)

You can program these chapters up to 15 in a row...tons of practice time!

2.  What I love is that you can mix and match these chapters according to your needs.  If you want to do extra cardio one day, you are able to put the cardio chapters back-to-back or even do the same one twice if you like it.  The cardio steps are well cued and not too difficult -stepping side to side with arms, front/side jacks (with hi/lo options), samba steps, standing crunches, football runs etc.-they are all repeated a few times in a row so that you will have time to catch on.  It is very easy to adapt them to fit your level of physical fitness.  You can make the moves more vigorous by making your steps bigger, higher, jumping higher or making bigger arm movements.  Take smaller steps to make it less vigorous.

3.  The instructors (Ana and Ravi) are always encouraging and friendly.  It makes your ""exercise"" time fly by.

4.  The music is interesting and appropriate for the practice.  The sound production is good...you can hear the instruction very clearly and the music.

5.  Ana's singing is very beautiful and calming during the chants and I love her funky boots! ;-)

It seems that a lot of work and love went into this DVD.  Ravi and Ana thought of everything that we would need to practice and put it all into this DVD.  Although I have most of their DVD's (all except two), this is my new favorite--until the next one of course ;-)  Worth every penny!",1234915200,30,2133,4.423772609819121
3680399,5,B001L54TQY,"In Kundalini Yoga: Cardio, Stretch, and Strenthen, Ana and Ravi have provided a truly Kundalini Cardio workout. If you are familiar with their previous videos, you will love this one as well. They have a new set and new upbeat music, but the same positive energy as always. (If I had to connect it to their other workouts, I would say this video follows along the lines of Fat Free Yoga and Dance the Chakras, but this one offers lots of new exercises and features.) If you're new to Raviana, then there are a few things to keep in mind. This is not a standard cardio workout.  As a Kundalini workout, the cardio is much more free-flowing in nature than a typical dance workout.  Don't assume this means that the DVD isn't challenging; it is! It provides a very serious workout for the mind and body, promoting wellness, happiness, and energy- and yes, you will sweat!

A rundown of the basic features of the DVD:
This DVD incorporates the ""matrix"" technology, which allows the viewer to program his/her own workout from the many sections available. If you are a beginner, you can start with the ""breath primer"" to learn four part breathing, breath of fire, and long deep breathing, and you can include the ""dance movement breakdown"" to get a good grasp on the cardio moves. If you are more advanced, you can leave out these extra features and just play the entire workout, or choose to have an extended cardio/dance session, or even do the dance section with music only (for an even more individualized workout). The DVD also offers four different pre-arranged workout versions, in case you want a change from the standard play of the DVD, and don't want to bother creating your own just yet. These include a beginner cardio set, a yoga-only set, a ""super-set"" with the extended dance, and an intermediate selection.

Beyond the form of the DVD, which lends itself well to any level of fitness, the workout itself is similarly flexible. This workout contains several advanced moves, and each person should go at their own pace, slowly working up to the speed that Ana so gracefully achieves. The DVD begins with stretching and toning work (including some serious core work!), moves into cardio/dance, and ends with upper body strengthening exercises. As with every Raviana DVD, this one also includes chanting and meditation as well, which brings you into and out of the workout, and keeps you present through the entire video. Not only do you burn calories in this cardio workout, you also gain strength, flexibility, and peace of mind. This video is an excellent addition to the Raviana collection. Get in a challenging workout and have great time doing it-- I highly recommend it!",1234742400,41,2684,4.790496760259179

3680412,5,B001L54TQY,"David Cushing Fuess, the instructor on this DVD, is an acupuncturist who has been practicing yoga since 1966, and has taught Kundalini Yoga since 1975. His goal here is to make yoga easy and accessible to the average human being. He teaches in a non-denominational way, and does not use Sanskrit (or Gurmukhi) terminology. In the introductory section, he notes that yoga is an interior journey, talks about the history of yoga and his own practice (he studied with Yogi Bhajan and Baba Hari Das), and provides health precautions.

The DVD was filmed in an indoor studio, and takes a modular approach. 32 exercises are grouped together by their health effects. There are about four exercises in most of the modules. He recommends doing a few of the modules at a time and building up gradually over time. The modules are:

1) Powerful Breathing
2) Warm Up Hips
3) Abdominals
4) Breath of Fire
5) Balance 1
6) Standing Poses
7) Balance 2
8) Spine Flexibility
9) Completion

The completion section includes a final relaxation in corpse pose. He also adds an interesting bonus section on anatomy, where he lectures before a skeleton and points out how yogic exercises effect the muscles and bones. The instructor's demeanor is encouraging and humorous throughout. He is an older person, is not a perfectionist, encourages the viewer not to be one either, and to make things fun! He is also very knowledgeable about health, and adds a lot of interesting commentary during the exercises. A few of the exercises were somewhat challenging (shoulder stand, leg lifts, etc.) but not out of reach. I would rank this as a bit more difficult than the Nirvair Singh Khalsa DVDs that I've reviewed previously, and should be a good next step. A worthwhile purchase.",1467417600,2,1748,4.859060402684563

3680416,4,B001L54TQY,"This DVD isn't quite what I was expecting it when I ordered it.  I think we were expecting something that was more of a yoga routine.  This DVD is a series of exercises that work muscles to exhaustion, meaning each separate exercise uses repetitive movement for rather long periods of time until you can't do it anymore (ex., squats for 8 continuous minutes.)  She does progress through all the muscle groups, but there is no real stretching activities to counterbalance the work. The music is very beautiful and soothing which was unexpected.  Overall, I feel like the DVD provides a great workout - it is just very different from all the other yoga DVDs we have in our collection.

In the second part, I'll say some more general things about Ana and Ravi and kundalini yoga. It seems the negative reviews of their DVDs come mainly from people who didn't know what to expect when ordering kundalini yoga DVDs -- because they ARE a little bit different from what you're used to, if you've only practiced hatha yoga in the past. I am unabashedly an Ana and Ravi fan, but hopefully my evaluation will help you make the correct decision for yourself, even if your opinion happens not to be the same as mine.

----------
Part I
----------

Like most of Ana and Ravi's DVDs, Kundalini Yoga Flow Boot Camp has the matrix menu, which allows you to customize the length of your workout.

Introduction (1:08): Sometimes the introduction is necessary to understanding the goal of Anas and Ravis DVDs. I don't really think you need to bother with it this time, unless you want to. They go into detail during the yoga sets, themselves, about the purposes of the exercises.

Tune In (2:20): This segment is similar/the same in many of Ana's and Ravi's DVDs; you sit cross-legged, focus on your breathing, and chant ""ong namo guru dev namo"" three times.

Yoga Flow Part 1 (9:00): The only warm-up exercises are in this segment.  However, lots of people do vinyasa/flow yoga AS a warmup, so nothing else is really needed.  The sequence is similar to other flow yoga, but it's not the same (i.e., there's no plank or chaturanga).

*Stand with your feet together and knees bent; alternate putting one hand on the opposite thigh and raising the other hand
*From standing, do a forward bend, then do a few repeats of downward dog/upward dog
*A form of warrior I with your heel off the ground
*Come up, repeat the forward bend, then do the downward dog/upward dog repeats again
*Repeat the warrior I-like move
*Then, with one hand on the ground, twist your torso and raise the other one
*Chair pose with breath of fire

Yoga Flow Part 2 (15:00): This follows from Yoga Flow Part 1 and if you want a longer flow sequence you could do both segments together.  Or, if you'd prefer a little flow paired with other things, the matrix menu makes that possible, as well.

*From standing, do a forward bend, then do a few repeats of downward dog/upward dog
*A form of warrior I with your heel off the ground, then rock your hips forward and back
*Drop your back knee to the floor and rock your hips some more
*Sit on the heel of the leg with the bent knee and stretch out over the other (extended) leg
*Come back up and do chair pose with breath of fire
*Repeat the forward bend, then do the downward dog/upward dog repeats again
*Raise one leg behind you, bend the knee, and let the foot hang towards the opposite side of your body
*Bring that foot up between your hands, put both hands on the same side of your foot, bring your back knee down and your elbows to the floor
*Raise your leg behind you, bring it partway forward a few times
*Do a version of pigeon on your forearms, then with your chest down
*Then either do full pigeon or keep your legs in the previous position and support yourself in an upright position with straight arms

Kundalini Core Power (7:54): This isn't too challenging for me and mostly focuses on the deep abdominals.  The last exercise sounds complicated but Ravi walks you through it enough times that you'll learn it.

*Come in and out of bridge; while your hips are raised, extend your arms overhead
*On you back, alternate raising opposite legs and arms
*Hold stretch pose (raise head and heels six inches) with breath of fire
*With breath of fire, raise your legs to 90 degrees, pulse legs wide twice, cross legs in center with two pulses, pulse legs wide twice again, bring legs together and set them down (repeat a few times)

Ringing the Bells of Heaven/Upper Body Boot Camp (22:00): I simply cannot do this all the way through without resting.  And if it is new to you, your arms WILL hurt the next day.  However, I did find myself able to complete more and more of it as time went on.  So don't give up.  Do what you can, rest when you need to, and you'll make progress.

*Sit with your legs crossed and bring your arms parallel to the floor, repeat the following moves
-Say ""sa"" as you bring your arms to the front
-Say ""ta"" as you bring your arms to the sides
-Say ""na"" as you bring your arms behind you
-Say ""ma"" as you bring your arms back to the sides
*With your thumbs at the base of your little fingers, alternate raising your arms; as your arm goes up, open the hand and as your arm goes down, make a fist
*Lie on your back and relax
*Repeat the first exercise
*With your hands in fists on the floor behind you, twist your shoulders side to side
*Put your arms out at 30 degrees below parallel; raise them straight up and then back to the starting position (repeat many times)
*Put your head back and make half circles with it

Deep Relaxation (3:27): This is similar in many of Ravi's and Ana's DVDs. Lie on your back, slow your breathing, and listen.  (No gong in this one, unlike some of the other Ana and Ravi DVDs made around the same time.)

Siam Kriya (15:53): I have to modify the first pose in this one.  I can't put weight on the top of my foot without getting really bad foot cramps.  So I either keep my back knee down or curl my toes under, depending on what I feel I can do that day.  Modify if you need to.

*Lunge pose with hands in prayer; back toes not tucked under; long deep breathing
*Seated forward bend
*Seated meditation with hands in lap

Mantra Chant (6:23): Not much to this, it's pretty simple.  All of the mantra is said in one breath, then you take another breath and go again.

Ra ra ra ra
Ma ma ma ma
Sa ta na ma

Closing Prayer (1:10): This is similar to what appears in other Ravi/Ana DVDs. However, its a bit shorter.

Breath Primer: Please note that this segment may not play if you just play the entire DVD through. It is accessible from the matrix menu and the chapter selection menu, however. If you are not familiar with kundalini yoga, you will definitely want to follow along here. It's actually a pretty good refresher for anyone who has practiced for awhile, as well. You learn how to do long deep breathing, a panting breath that serves as an introduction to breath of fire, and then a standard breath of fire technique. I think this is the exact same segment as was included with some of Ana's and Ravi's other ""blonde Ana"" DVDs.

White Swan Meditation (4:00): Put your thumbs together at brow level and remember the image.  Then close your eyes and visualize your thumbs (while they're still in position).  Do long deep breathing.

For those of you familiar with Ravi's and Ana's DVDs, this is one of the newer ones with the concrete floor, white pillars, fake nature background, and blonde Ana. Both Ravi and Ana narrate and Ana demonstrates the poses and movements. The music is mostly of a similar style, sort of a blend of traditional Indian music with a more modern beat/instrumentation (in the same song).  There are different singers and different voices.  Most of the music is appropriate, though, and doesn't really stand out in any way.

I don't care for the camera work in certain parts of this. It seems to jump around randomly, and sometimes there are zooms in and out between camera angles that are jarring. It's pretty typical for an Ana and Ravi DVD, though, and most of the time your eyes are closed, anyway.  Maybe it's just me, but I'd prefer standard (boring) camera work where you can always see what Ana's doing, with no unnecessary visual effects.

There are definitely some moves that might require modification here.  I mentioned the lunges in Siam Kriya.  Ana and Ravi mention some other modifications (for example, putting your hands beneath you for support in stretch pose, and an alternative for sitting on your heel while stretching one leg from Yoga Flow Part 2, as well as modifications to pigeon -- which is great since I can't do full pigeon).  Make sure you have a good, supportive surface.  A cushiony-soft yoga mat may be an impediment here; I had trouble maintaining some of the upright postures with my cushioned yoga mat.  On the other hand, it was probably great core work for that reason.  But just be aware.

I feel like parts of this DVD would work for beginners and parts would not. The flow part is easy -- easier than regular vinyasa, I think.  The core section is not the most intense core work I've experienced in Ana and Ravi DVDs.  Ringing the Bells of Heaven is definitely NOT for beginners, though.  Finally, don't forget -- you don't have to keep up with Ana, nor do you have to stretch as far forward as Ana in the forward-bending moves. Work at your own pace and do what YOU can.

----------
Part II
----------

Now, on to a more general discussion of kundalini yoga in general, and Ana's and Ravi's DVDs in particular. (I intend to include a version of this in all my reviews of Ana's and Ravi's DVDs.)

Most of the yoga that people are familiar with falls under the umbrella of hatha yoga. Perhaps you've done a series of static poses, or some vinyasa/flow yoga. Kundalini yoga is not exactly like either of these, although Ana's and Ravi's DVDs do incorporate elements of hatha yoga (e.g., this DVD has table pose in it). Among Ana's and Ravi's DVDs that I've done so far (I have 27 or 28 of them, I think), this one is unique in that it does incorporate some flow (vinyasa) type elements.

However, kundalini yoga is also what I would consider to be a very active form of yoga, consisting of some repeated movements and a lot more work with the breath than you may be used to. It can be difficult to keep up with at first, but can be very rewarding if you stick with it. If you are bored of holding static poses all the time, or if you want a bit more movement but hate vinyasa (sorry, but I am not a fan of flow yoga), kundalini might really work well for you. Even though this DVD does incorporate some flow, I find it more tolerable than most vinyasa.  It might be a good place to start if you want to work your way up to a more traditional type of flow yoga.  And, as I said earlier, use the modifications Ana and Ravi discuss if you need to use them. Yes, Ana is fit (and this makes her an excellent demonstrator for the poses), but this is not a competition. Don't strain yourself, and don't try to keep up with her. Just try to improve a little bit every time!

Kundalini yoga also involves a lot of meditation. Sometimes this is quiet and involves breathing either in a sitting position or lying down, occasionally with your hands in a mudra (hand position). Sometimes it involves chanting a mantra. This DVD contains a mantra chanting segment as well as meditation during Siam Kriya and the White Swan Meditation; these last two do not involve chanting but do involve visualizations. Whenever there are mantras, Ana and Ravi tell you what they mean. If you are uncomfortable with mantras for religious reasons, check out Ana's and Ravi's website (can't post links in reviews but they're easy to find through Google) for alternatives and use the matrix menu or your DVD remote to skip the chants. (I happen to like the chants, but that's just me.)

With respect to calorie-burning, this DVD is probably not going to do a ton. But kundalini yoga works on your inner self as well as your outer self, and so some parts are a little less ""active"" than others. For my own part, I still do plenty of pretty intense cardio at other times of the day. (I do about 30 minutes of yoga a day by combining segments using the matrix menu. Ana and Ravi are a part of my fitness routine, but they are not the whole of it.)

Ana's outfits are a bit skimpy, but certainly nothing less than you would see at the beach. And the reason she dresses like she does is so that you can really see her performing the movements and asanas. That way you know exactly how to position yourself for maximum benefit. (Most of the time, kundalini yoga is done with the eyes closed, anyway.) There is not a lot in the way of initial instruction in this DVD. If you are familiar with Ana's and Ravi's work, you can jump right in. But if you are new to kundalini yoga, watch it first. Observe Ana, listen to the cues, make sure you understand. You'll be glad for the lack of instructional segments later -- you don't want to be told on the 20th time you do a DVD how to do pigeon; you know it by this point!

A few health claims are made in this DVD (i.e., that certain poses ""break up calcium deposits""). Take those that appear with a grain of salt. I do find that Ana and Ravi are quite accurate when it comes to muscular and skeletal issues. At any rate, certainly don't use yoga as a substitute for seeing the doctor. But doing a routine like this isn't likely to hurt you or make your health condition worse (as long as you PACE YOURSELF).

If you are struggling with a sequence, Ravi and Ana are very accessible and quite nice. They have contact information on their website (the URL is on the DVD case) and usually get back to you in a couple of days. They also have a monthly e-mail newsletter that I enjoy.",1407110400,6,13260,4.424989724619811

3680475,5,B001L54TQY,"When I first got this one I had to put it back on the shelf for a while -- it really is an intense workout!  But I circled back to it with determination!!!  It is wonderful having the Kundalini version of sun salutations, it made me realize that I had been missing them even though I love all the ravianas I have (16 to date).

This one makes me feel so empowered and strong.  I LOVE ringing the bells of heaven, but it is still too much -- eight minute stretch -- for me in one go, so I alternate in the arm 'jogging' from Solar Power when i feel i can't go on.

This morning when I finished I wanted MORE!!!  I can really see how this one is busting through my stamina firewalls.

On a spiritual note, these dvds have really broken through firewalls there too.  I started with their dvds back in August.  Very gently over time, I find myself coming to a different awareness of myself as a being in the Universe, and the nature of existence on the non-worldly plane.  This awareness does not in any way lessen my religious beliefs but solidifies them with a happy sureness that makes every day a blessing. How's that for 5 stars!",1395705600,3,1130,4.238317757009346
3680476,5,B001L54TQY,"As I started this practice, I wasn't sure why it was called, Boot Camp.  Then I came to the section called, Ringing the Bells of Heaven.  Hello  now I know why the title, Boot Camp.

This practice grew on me.  The first few times I did it, I didn't like it.  I didn't think it was energizing enough.  Then one day, it all clicked for me and I now love this workout.

TUNE IN

The Tune In section is the usual chanting of ong namo guru dev namo.  The new snappy music makes it a bit different.

YOGA FLOW (2 sets)

The 2 Yoga Flow sets felt more like traditional vinyasa yoga rather than kundalini yoga.  That was okay, its good to mix things up.

KUNDALINI CORE POWER

I love the cross crawl movement on the back where you raise your right arm and left leg, and then switch to raising your left arm and right leg.  I really do feel like Im getting my center back with this move.

There is a new move where you're lying on your back and you raise your legs to 90 degrees; you then do a split for 2 beats, bring your legs back up and criss-cross them for 2 beats; legs back to v split for 2 beats and then lower your legs.  You do this all while doing the breath of fire! This is tough to get the hang of since theres a lot going on.  Its fun once you get it.

RINGING THE BELLS OF HEAVEN AKA UPPER BODY BOOT CAMP

What a cool name for this section.  Your arms certainly feel like they're ringing something!  The first few times I did this section, I didn't like it.  I could only last about 2 minutes with the arm movements.  Then something clicked and I can go longer.  I love the peppy music; it helps you keep up with the movements.

SIAM KRIYA

A new twist on some previously seen exercises.  Youre in a crescent pose and breathing deeply.  The kicker is that your back foot is not balanced on the ball, but on the top.  Due to some severe plantar fasciitis, I was doing this move with my knee down.

MANTRA CHANT
You end with a 6 minute chant of ra, ra, ra, ra, ma, ma, ma, ma, sa tan a ma for each breath.  This was very hard for me since I couldn't get my breath pattern such that I was inhaling once we started the ra, ra, ra again. It is something to work towards.

Bonus sections:

BREATH PRIMER

This is a separate section but I always like to start my kundalini workouts with the breath primer because it helps get me centered.

WHITE SWAN MEDITATION

A calming meditation to help visualization.  I must admit that I have limited tolerance for meditation, so I haven't yet tried this one.

As usual, there is the matrix feature so you can mix and match which sections youd like to do.  There are also a few premixes.

All told, there is about 60 minutes of exercises and then you do the meditation and relaxation.

The things to note about this workout:

* There is a lot of chanting and meditation, so if this isn't your thing, this may not be the kundalini workout for you.

* The transition between sections is very choppy.  The DVD freezes for a moment, all sound stops and then the next section starts.  To me, this is sloppy editing. Ravi and Ana should know better.

In spite of the things to note, I thoroughly enjoyed this workout and do recommend it to anyone wanting to do more kundalini yoga.",1390348800,3,3215,4.168026101141925

3680478,4,B001L54TQY,"This review will have a two-part format. In the first part, I'll describe the contents of the DVD as well as my thoughts on them. In the second part, I'll say some more general things about Ana and Ravi and kundalini yoga. It seems the negative reviews of their DVDs come mainly from people who didn't know what to expect when ordering kundalini yoga DVDs -- because they ARE a little bit different from what you're used to, if you've only practiced hatha yoga in the past. I am unabashedly an Ana and Ravi fan, but hopefully my evaluation will help you make the correct decision for yourself, even if your opinion happens not to be the same as mine.

----------
Part I
----------

Like most of Ana and Ravi's DVDs, Kundalini Yoga Cardio, Stretch, & Strengthen: Total Fun Fitness! has the matrix menu, which allows you to customize the length of your workout.

Tune In (1:50): This segment is similar/the same in many of Ana's and Ravi's DVDs; you sit cross-legged, focus on your breathing, and chant ""ong namo guru dev namo"" three times.

Warm-Ups (5:13): This segment consists of the following exercises.

*While seated, grind your stomach in circles
*Seated with your legs crossed, have your arms at right angles; inhale and move your arms back and apart; exhale and move your arms forward to where your forearms meet; flex your spine to go with the arm movements
*With your arms at right angles, twist left and right
*With your legs in front of you along the ground, with one arm at a time, reach your fingers to your opposite toes

Stretching Plus Core (15:32): This segment consists of the following exercises.

*Sit on one foot, stretch out over the other extended leg
*Lying on your back, go into plow, then back down
*V sit-ups with one leg extended
*Alternate the previous two exercises (Ravi walks you through this part so you don't get lost)

Core Plus (7:44): This segment consists of the following exercises.

*On your hands and knees, lift one leg behind you in three strokes, then bring it to your chest
*On your back, with your legs at 90 degrees, curl up while separating your legs to the sides, then lie back down and bring your legs back together
*With one foot on top of the other, use one arm behind your head to support your head and extend the other one, do crunches; later, hold the position
*Extended locust pose with breath of fire

Kundalini (Dance) Cardio Warm-Up Flow & Cardio (15:02): Many exercises in this segment are repeated.  I'll only mention each one, once.  No move is done longer than 30 seconds, which is GREAT if you are struggling with one.  They do offer modifications at some points (i.e., for the jumping jacks).  Ana suggests wearing supportive shoes in this segment, although her ""supportive shoes"" appear to be 14-hole Doc Martens, which I never thought of as workout shoes.  I like the music in this section, but it is loud relative to the instruction.  This segment consists of the following exercises.

*Draw alternate knees into your body
*Hip rolls back and forth with arms
*Lean forward, arms to ground with flat back, then stand up, arms above head
*Alternating side steps with raised arms
*Step forward and back, leading with wrist/arm
*Second position pli with arms
*Side bend with wide feet, turn to flat back, bend down over your leg; reverse and repeat on the other side
*Heel taps forward
*Side step with arms at right angles, moving arms together and apart (similar arm movement to warm-up); some half-turns involved here
*Plis with arm movements (different from arm movements above)
*Samba step
*March with elbow thrust
*Football drill (move feet fast); then add legs and arms in and out while moving feet fast
*Lunge back with elbow thrust
*Tap step with punching arms (at chest level)
*Tap step in circle with hands making a rowing motion
*Jumping jacks with arms in front, then to the sides
*Standing side crunches (fingers on shoulders, touch elbow to raised knee)
*Roman salute jumping jacks
*Tap foot to spin yourself in a circle, fan yourself with your hand
*Vertical scissor jack (scissor your legs and raise opposite arms)
*Tap heels together while moving knees in and out

Kundalini (Dance) Cardio Cool Down (3;16): This segment consists of the following exercises.

*Step side to side, raising alternate arms
*Step forward and back, leading with your wrist/arm
*Stretch arms over head, step feet wide, do wide legged forward bend with hips shifting left and right
*Lunge pose, knee to floor, raise arm and twist
*Raise/lower ball of foot to stretch calf
*Forward bend with wide legs, inhale and twist while raising one arm

Upper Body Tune & Tone (11:39): This segment consists of the following exercises.

*With your forearms on the floor and your hands clasped together raise your hips in the air (like in downward dog), then push forward to where your sternum is over your hands, then push back to raised hips
*Basically repeat the previous exercise but with one leg raised behind you
*Sit with legs crossed, extend arm in front of you with flexed hand, raise and lower
*Repeat previous exercise with both hands together
*Start with arms to the sides, parallel to the floor; raise them to 90 degrees overhead, then back to starting position
*Hands staying in prayer pose, raise your arms up and down (this one is harder than it sounds!)

Deep Relaxation (5:17): This is similar in many of Ravi's and Ana's DVDs. Lie on your back, slow your breathing, and listen.

Ek Ong Kar Chant (5:19): This is pretty simple, you just repeat the mantra (below) with your hands on your sternum, one on top of the other.

Ek Ong Kar
Sat Nam
Siri Wahay Guru

The mantra is fine, but I don't care for the rhythm in this one.  I have heard this chant (the words, that is) as background music in one of Ravi's and Ana's other DVDs and thought it was great.  They've changed the rhythm and intonation in this one and it's not my favorite.  It's too fast and not very meditative or relaxing.

Closing Prayer (2:43): This is similar to what appears in other Ravi/Ana DVDs.

Breath Primer: Please note that this segment may not play if you just play the entire DVD through. It is accessible from the matrix menu and the chapter selection menu, however. If you are not familiar with kundalini yoga, you will definitely want to follow along here. It's actually a pretty good refresher for anyone who has practiced for awhile, as well. You learn how to do long deep breathing, a panting breath that serves as an introduction to breath of fire, and then a standard breath of fire technique. I think this is the exact same segment as was included with some of Ana's and Ravi's other ""blonde Ana"" DVDs.

(Dance) Movement Breakdown (7:51): A slow motion version of the moves from the cardio segment, with voiceovers by Ana.  Good if you think you need to practice the moves before doing the segment.  But definitely not necessary to watch if you don't care about getting it perfect the first time.

Extended (Dance) Kundalini Cardio (21:00): A longer version of the cardio segment.  There's not much else to say about this one.

Kundalini Cardio Music Only (10:47): Basically the shorter cardio segment with no voiceover.  Could be used if you don't want the voiceover, or could add this segment in via the matrix menu to have a bit longer workout.

For those of you familiar with Ravi's and Ana's DVDs, this is one of the newer ones with the concrete floor, white pillars, fake nature background, and blonde Ana. Both Ravi and Ana narrate and Ana demonstrates the poses and movements. The music in this one seems, to me, like a contemporary take on traditional Indian music (i.e., the words sound like mantras but the style of the music and the rhythms are newer-sounding). I like some of it quite a lot and I don't care for some of it.  I think the music during the cardio segment is my favorite.

I don't care for the camera work in certain parts of this. It seems to jump around randomly, and sometimes there are zooms in and out between camera angles that are jarring.  Also, at the beginning of the cardio segment, there are some odd light/strobe like effects that I don't care for.  Maybe it's just me, but I'd prefer standard (boring) camera work where you can always see what Ana's doing, with no unnecessary visual effects.

I don't feel there are any sections of this that would be hard on the wrists or ankles.  You do hold the leg stretch in the ""Stretching Plus Core"" section for a long time, but Ana and Ravi offer modifications.  You can always stay low impact with the jumping jacks by alternating legs side to side or stepping back.

I feel like this DVD would work for beginners.  Don't worry too much about form in the dance/cardio section, you'll pick it up in time.  The jumping jacks are over quickly.  I do find that the cardio section causes me to break a bit of a sweat.  Finally, don't forget -- you don't have to keep up with Ana. Work at your own pace.

----------
Part II
----------

Now, on to a more general discussion of kundalini yoga in general, and Ana's and Ravi's DVDs in particular. (I intend to include a version of this in all my reviews of Ana's and Ravi's DVDs.)

Most of the yoga that people are familiar with falls under the umbrella of hatha yoga. Perhaps you've done a series of static poses, or some vinyasa/flow yoga. Kundalini yoga is not exactly like either of these, although Ana's and Ravi's DVDs do incorporate elements of hatha yoga (e.g., this DVD has an extended locust pose in it). However, kundalini yoga is also what I would consider to be a very active form of yoga, consisting of some repeated movements and a lot more work with the breath than you may be used to. It can be difficult to keep up with at first, but can be very rewarding if you stick with it. If you are bored of holding static poses all the time, or if you want a bit more movement but hate vinyasa (sorry, but I am not a fan of flow yoga), kundalini might really work well for you. And, as I said earlier, use the modifications Ana and Ravi discuss if you need to use them. Yes, Ana is fit (and this makes her an excellent demonstrator for the poses), but this is not a competition. Don't strain yourself, and don't try to keep up with her. Just try to improve a little bit every time!

Kundalini yoga also involves a lot of meditation. Sometimes this is quiet and involves breathing either in a sitting position or lying down, occasionally with your hands in a mudra (hand position). Sometimes it involves chanting a mantra. This DVD contains a fair amount of mantra chanting - there's a separate chanting segment, as well as the opening and closing segments. Whenever there are mantras, Ana and Ravi tell you what they mean. If you are uncomfortable with mantras for religious reasons, check out Ana's and Ravi's website (can't post links in reviews but they're easy to find through Google) for alternatives and use the matrix menu or your DVD remote to skip the chants. (I happen to like the chants, but that's just me.)

With respect to calorie-burning, this DVD is going to do more of that, compared to Ana's and Ravi's other workouts. But kundalini yoga works on your inner self as well as your outer self, and so some parts are a little less ""active"" than others. For my own part, I still do plenty of pretty intense cardio at other times of the day.  (I do about 30 minutes of yoga a day by combining segments using the matrix menu.  Ana and Ravi are a part of my fitness routine, but they are not the whole of it.)

Ana's outfits are a bit skimpy, but certainly nothing less than you would see at the beach. And the reason she dresses like she does is so that you can really see her performing the movements and asanas. That way you know exactly how to position yourself for maximum benefit. (Most of the time, kundalini yoga is done with the eyes closed, anyway.) There is a lot in the way of initial instruction in this DVD in the extra segments. If you are familiar with Ana's and Ravi's work, you can jump right in. But if you are new to kundalini yoga, watch it first. Observe Ana, listen to the cues, make sure you understand. You'll be glad for the ability to omit the instructional segments later -- you don't want to be told on the 20th time you do a DVD how to do a movement; you know it by this point!

A few health claims are made in this DVD. Take those that do appear with a grain of salt. I do find that Ana and Ravi are quite accurate when it comes to muscular and skeletal issues.  At any rate, certainly don't use yoga as a substitute for seeing the doctor. But doing a routine like this isn't likely to hurt you or make your health condition worse (as long as you PACE YOURSELF).

If you are struggling with a sequence, Ravi and Ana are very accessible and quite nice. They have contact information on their website (the URL is on the DVD case) and usually get back to you in a couple of days. They also have a monthly e-mail newsletter that I enjoy.",1385337600,13,12955,4.553402239448751

I'm not sure this was meant to be a whole family workout, I know not to have the children practice breath of fire at a young age, but they are usually too focused on attempting the poses to do anything other than deep breathing. Ana's easy going yet energetic demeanor is perfect for encouraging my kids (and me) throughout the cardio portion and we can work up to the longer set depending on our time and energy levels.

But the worst part is listening to Gurmukh talk. She talks like she is talking fake and not authentic. It is like listening to nails on a chalkbord.. and a touch of her having saliva in her mouth.  If she didn't talk at all and snatum sang the instructions at the start of each exercise (dreaming), this would be ideal.  I didn't know about Gurmuk at all before this and looked it up and read her story and she has lived a life a bit off the grid, but I did not enjoy her mannerisms and/or her voice. Her voice is also disruptive to the peace you should feel when doing this kind of yoga - she comes across harsh and yelling when saying words that should be restful. Just my opinion.  Again, the yoga itself is great but I don't know what other dvd to get. I will never buy an exercise tape again prior to listening to the instructor's voice.

ONe more thing.. Why advertise this as a festival when the groups of participants is rarely if ever shown. We see more of Gurmuk looking at her stop watch (while not doing the exercises) than we do of the people in the class doing the exercises. It is a shame that was missed as to me, the purpose of the festival is to do the exercises with others, not to just stare at the singer and the mc.

3680520,5,B001L54TQY,"I am a relatively new convert to Kundalini Yoga and in particular Ravi and Ana's DVDs.  I began with Fat Free - Lose Weight, Feel Great, which was a gift from a friend.  After clicking immediately with that video - the music, the different spin on yoga, everything is just perfect, new and exciting - I began to collect more of the older routines from them.  After a few months I purchased Yoga for Beginners and Beyond - Stretch, Strengthen, Be Stress Free! my first Blonde Ana.  At first (like some reviewers here) I was put off by the beach wallpaper behind Ana and the new filming technique and music, and I wrote a less than glowing review.

After a few months I got Beginners out again and now it is a favorite.  I've upgraded my review, too.  I now love the newer ones!  I've collected Solar Power and the Meditation DVD, purchased Transformer from Ravi at a workshop, and also received this DVD and Kundalini Yoga for Energy and Super Radiance.  Despite some negative feedback on the new backdrop videos, I've loved them all after getting over my initial hesitation, and find most of them to be challenging in a good way.

As many have written, this video has some material that is not for beginners.  In particular the rolling back to plow pose and up into half teasers is quite challenging and I can see someone hurting their back with it.  I would recommend starting with either or both of the Beginners DVDs; Fat Free Yoga - Lose Weight Feel Great; and Yoga Beauty Body.  Yoga Beauty Body helps you to find and engage your core and learn to do shoulder stand.  Additionally, Solar Power is a next step to activate and strengthen the core and is a good prep for Cardio, Stretch & Strengthen.

That particular plow-to-teaser move is a version of an advanced Pilates exercise, and it has me wondering whether Joseph Pilates copied the move from the ancient discipline of Kundalini, or if Ana incorporated Pilates into this all-inclusive workout.

The matrix and excellent chaptering on this DVD make it possible for you to break it down into short routines to help build up strength, or just dance.  I find the cardio is fun, free and easy to modify if necessary.  The music is uplifting, and Ravi and Ana's voices and careful cueing motivate me to keep up.

I'm in the process of collecting all of their DVDs and am anxiously awaiting new releases!",1351728000,5,2358,4.58472553699284
3680521,5,B001L54TQY,"The Kundalini yoga in this DVD is challenging enough to keep me interested, depending on what kind of day I've had. Amir Jaan is articulate and very exact, giving clear prompts when necessary, but he doesn't blather on needlessly.

There isn't any usual Kundalini music, only a sort of generic background kind of music, and chimes that are tinkled to signify that a change is coming up. The DVD includes a warm up segment, the Kundalini set, and then a period of rest in corpse pose before closing.

Amir Jaan is very serious and very British, but his accent is clear and easy to understand. His tuning in and tuning out is out of this world, with really great chanting vibrations. I wish more Kundalini teachers would emphasize the importance of what comes at both the beginning and also the end of a Kundalini session. Sometimes they seem to be rushed through, while Amir Jaan really goes for it.

I own more than 65 Kundalini DVDs and videos, and this one is in my top 20.",1348790400,19,975,4.528409090909091
3680522,4,B001L54TQY,"I have never taken a live Kundalini class before, so this may be the closest I'll ever get to one.

This class is well described by one of the other reviewers (except the standing body shaking is 28 min. not 17; believe me, I wish it was only 17!), so I will point out what I felt were areas that could be improved upon.  (Hopefully Spirit Voyage will read this review and take these points into consideration for future releases.)

It was sometimes hard to hear what Gurmukh was saying, so subtitles might be nice or at least show the audience so we can see if anything has changed since her last comments.

I would like to see the audience more, particularly during the opening shaking sequence.  During part of this extra-long session Gurmukh says to get with a group, make eye contact, mirror each other.  This whole time the camera is almost exclusively on the musicians who are seated, playing instruments.  It would have been nice if they would show the audience, so we could join various groups by proxy.  Even though the musicians are nice to look at, they weren't doing yoga.

After this vigorous cardio segment Gurmukh immediately has the participants sit down.  This did not seem like a prudent thing to do.  My heart was pounding like crazy, so I walked around for awhile.  That was OK because she did a bit of talking before moving on, so I was able to sit in time to go on with the class.

There weren't very many poses, so even though the class was long it also felt kind of short in a way.

All in all I loved this experience.  Snatam Kaur does sing like an angel and she made the experience more enjoyable and more doable.  I would love to see more yoga classes like this.  It would have been nice if they had packaged three or more live classes together so we could get a more well-rounded yoga experience.

There is an amazing energy available to us home participants by doing this live class.  I have only done Kundalini videos with single instructors/demononstrators.  Doing this video was the next best thing to being there and it was a wonderful difference from my usual fare.

I highly recommend this video and hope people will buy it so Spirit Voyage will continue to make these classes available to us at-home exercisers.",1334275200,24,2248,4.514851485148514

Snatum Kuar with her voice of an angel was beautiful. Grumukh was a wonderful teacher, so flexible. the DVD is a real work out with about 24 minutes of constant movement.

3680524,5,B001L54TQY,"As someone who practices in both the hatha/vinyasa tradition as well as the Kundalini tradition, I have been hoping that someone would come along and create a practice that involves the flow of a vinyasa class with the traditional meditations and kriyas of the Kundalini. I think Ravi and Ana did a great job with that on this DVD! It's a great workout for those looking for the physical benefits of yoga, and it also emphasizes the importance of meditation, mantras, and breathing patterns such as the ""breath of fire."" They both are quite good about emphasizing some of the necessities of certain poses, and their words can be very encouraging during some of the longer and more challenging exercises. Some of the discussions and wording during meditation or moments of relaxation can be seen as a bit too new-age for some people, but I think that you could zone it out pretty easily if you were really worried about it. I would suggest taking a couple Kundalini classes before using this DVD though, as there isn't really a whole lot of warm-up before we get started. I usually pause the DVD after tuning in to do some waist rolls, spinal flexes, and twists beforehand. After that, I feel really warmed up and ready to go. Great DVD!

This wasn't a doc that was strictly ""preaching to the choir"". My own spiritual beliefs, or lack thereof, are very different from what is conveyed in the program, but I found it very watchable and didn't feel that it was too preachy.

Putting these 2 teachers together was sheer genius! It is beautifully shot; excellent audio and video and camera angles.  You feel as though you are actually there.

Here is what you will get:
Chapters for each part of the class:
Introduction
Opening Mantra -Ong Namo Guru dev namo
Class
Meditation Mantra
Closing Mantra

The set has the following asanas:
Seated with shaking arms overhead for 5 minutes
Standing with arms overhead shaking the entire body for about 17 minutes (I think).  After doing this you will be drenched in sweat.
Seated with arms above head in prayer pose, twisting
left/right
Moving Camel pose
yogic pushups
yogic double leg lifts on back
yogic sit ups--from lying on back to seated forward bend.

The 11 minute meditation is Aad Gurey Nameh song by Snatam Kaur.

It's a good sign when I am happy to put on my dvd regularly , as some exercise dvd's get left on the shelf after a few tries.

I love the warmth and spirit of most of their DVDs- the voiceovers are informative and motivating- but this one felt cold and clinical.  I have read reviewers criticize Ravi and Ana before for not thoroughly walking you through the poses to be able to execute them safely.  I have not experienced that previously, but there were definitely moments in this workout where it felt unclear how to properly align myself and that I might actually be getting into something where I could injure myself.  While the positions were definitely challenging, I didn't have that sense of fulfillment or energy flowing through my body that I usually do; I just felt uncomfortable.

I don't think this DVD will be in regular rotation with my other Ana & Ravi DVDs.  When I am looking for something like the Yoga Flow segments, I will stick with Sadie Nardini's Core Strength Vinyasa Yoga.",1327536000,3,1038,4.738888888888889

It is a common enough term tossed around in today's world but filmaker Nitin Adsul really delves into the seriousness of the matter.

3680552,5,B001L54TQY,"The Kundalini film is a basic educational documentary that discusses the Kundalini energy and how it can affect one who receives this gift.  I have watched it numerous times.  Each time I learn something different and see new elements that are presented and the film is well received by those interested in the fundamental elements of this powerful energy.  I personally enjoy the journeys that are discussed and the views of all the presenters. And I personally love watching the film.
If you are interested in Kundalini or if you are newly activated or if you have been going thru some difficult Kundalini experiences this film offers some insights that may help one understand more about this spiritual energy.
Kundalini is a complex spiritual energy that cannot be presented fully and in detail in a short documentary.  It can take years to fully understand the intricacies of this gift.
The film is not a prescription of how to receive and live with this energy.  It gives one an overview and some insight into how a few see it and experience it in a personal manner.  If one is looking for a how to prescription then one needs to find a teacher or find teachings they resonate with
I applaud Nitin Adsul for having the courage to bring this information to the public.  In this time of worldly change we need more who are willing to present subjects that are not in the mainstream.  Kundalini needs to be understood and viewed on all levels.  For it is the Kundalini energy that will help shape the changes that so many see coming to our world.  It is the Kundalini energy that will guide us.",1325289600,20,1597,4.631205673758865

I read reviews that criticize the new features: the fake lake background, the new music, and the incorporation of flow yoga into this set.
I felt the same way initially (what I loved about Kundalini was that it was NOT flow), but surely one of the things yoga teaches us is to be open to change, and to good things that may come in unfamiliar packages.
Within two run-throughs of Bootcamp, it became one of my favorite Raviana DVDs. It's a bit ridiculous to say this, because I love them all, but nothing rocks my body and heart like Ringing the Bells of Heaven, a set that will grow your confidence like no other set I know.
Thanks to Ravi and Ana for opening our minds and spirits and for doing FABULOUS things for our bodies.

However, the entire video does nothing to align your senses let alone one's Kundalini up to anything but scatter and make a hard appeal to the masses via commercialism. The non-new-agey supposedly ""hip"" music which includes an insane amount of whistle blowing sounds like I am stuck in the middle of an unending traffic jam - completely jarring. I'd rather have some elevator new-agey music in the face of the traffic cop whistle sounding off every 5 seconds.  Ana is so adorable, when she doesn't advertise it as a visually distracting message on her shirt of ""Major Cutie"".  In this and a few of the other new vids, the frozen picture of the lake background is also incredibly distracting as it provides a very unnatural look and feel...if it is real then the videography or something else is way off. Maybe I just don't get the concept...well I do...it is called boot camp (whistle blowing, t-shirt with the pun-ful play on Major...) Oy...what a headache, so sad...

If this was an experiment for new visual and auditory material in kundalini vids, consider it an experiment gone very wrong and lessons learned, not to be revisited, pretty please! You are a fantastic Kundalini duo and normally your stuff is awesome and Kundalini goodies like you provide are hard to come by.  You can do so much better (and in fact you have in lots of other videos)!  I have no idea why this appeals to other reviewers the way it does (who can not hear that whistle blowing - even now!!!) and much to my chagrin can not give it anything 1 star.

I regularly find the grace and nerve to push through challenges into opportunity and reward! My hubby (best friend and lover of 30 years) tells me I'm hotter than ever, which ain't bad either!

I added Body Electric and Yoga Flow Boot Camp to my collection (variety is the spice!) and find both of them a fantastic combination of challenge and relaxation.

What I can say is that this DVD is absolutely fantastic! I am a huge Raviana fan and own all 22 of their DVDs.  I wasn't sure that it was possible for them to deliver another fresh new KY DVD because of the fantastic library they have already compiled.  Well that is precisely what they have done.  It truly is a total body workout that is both challenging, but attainable.  While I definitely broke a sweat, I felt totally energized with all major muscle groups being worked.  I also felt toned, which I can honestly say is seldom the case after a single workout.  You usually need to work up to that point (even when using a DVD that you enjoy)!  With Boot Camp the feeling just washed over me.  I knew that my body was getting a serious tone-up as well as the workout itself.  Powerful stuff!!  The music is spectacular and I believe that it offers something for every level whether you are a beginner, intermediate, or advanced KY practitioner.  For those of you who are beginners, fear not, Ana and Ravi encourage you to do your best (and to even stretch beyond if you can) but there is never any pressure.  Raviana totally allows for those who are not able to achieve the full poses or go the distance for extended routines.  Imagine how good you will feel when you have worked up to that point and it will happen!  Before you know it you will not focus on the time (the clock will become totally irrelevant).

I thought this one would be challenging.  I did not do the prayer or other segments because I thought they might be too new agey for me.  This was NOT MY THING.

The yoga flow workouts were my favorite 2 segments I guess because they are like traditional yoga.  The abdominal segment was not bad either.  However, the upper body boot camp segment was definitely not my thing.  I will never do it again.  It was challenging doing the repetitive movements that weren't even yoga (reaching arms alternating up to the sky over and over and opening arms like wings through all the planes) and I do feel my muscles are worked but I did not like saying the sa ta na ma chant and then I found out it is satanic in some cultures!  This is not for me.

Please if someone wants this DVD to purchase it from me for a cheap price contact me (idealsigalheartcenter@yahoo.com) and if you know something I don't about how this chant is not satanic please let me know.

3680592,5,B001L54TQY,"I tried this DVD for the first time this morning.  First, let me say that there are other reviewers who gave such great minute-by-minute details about the actual DVD, that I'll refer you to their reviews if you want to learn about the specifics.
For me, this DVD was one, that when I did get to the meditation and relaxation, I felt like I deserved it!
I practice different types of yoga, so I appreciated the fact that the first two flow sets were more traditional poses.  It's always nice (for me anyway) to switch things up a little. The second flow, which included downward dog, upward dog, lunges and twists, felt like my whole body was being sculpted.
The Upper Body section was energizing but tough!!  I teach group exercise 3 days a week for a national fitness chain and two of those classes are upper and lower body sculpting.  Hence, I figure I'm pretty ""strong.""  Well, this 22-minute section gave me a brand new respect for Ana and the other KY practioners who practice this set in it's entirety.  The ""Ringing of the Bells"" (reaching straight up and down for 8 minutes) actually made my shoulders feel warm to the touch.  I had to dig very, very deep to even finish half-way.  I do (as always) appreciate a DVD that gives me something to work toward.  (I didn't think I could finish the ""Purify your Past"" (holding the arms out horizontally for 6 minutes) section of a previous DVD, but when I did accomplish it, it gave me a renewed sense of my strength and also let me know I could accomplish more than I thought in other areas.
Yes, I loved the DVD, but if I could change anything, it would be the music during the relaxation and swan meditation.  The ""odd warble"" in the gentleman's otherwise beautiful voice, disrupted my concentration.  I wish he would sing with an easier vibratto or maybe even no lyrics and/or singing at all during this segment.  This is just my observation and I'm sure others love this part.

I usually have a big aversion to sun sals but these ones on bootcamp are not typical, really enjoyable, and I had fun for my first time ever doing them! I think starting with sun salutations as a warmup to Kundalini Yoga is a really great idea. So many KY sets are done on the floor and this gets the large calorie burning muscles working with its weight bearing work and standing poses.
In fact, I really appreciate that Ana & Ravi are conscientious about adding extra lower body work and standing postures to all their latest DVDs!
The Ringing the Bells of Heaven took me to Heaven! I thought my arms might break but I felt a strange euphoria and that and the uplifting music took me through it.

Bootcamp gives us a ""Power"" type flow which with its spine rolling asanas and forward bends and subtle backbends prepares us beautifully for the core set that follows. After that we ""Ring the Bells of Heaven"" one of my favorite Kundalini sets and this is where it really gets challenging. Others have described this here so I won't I will just say it left me sweaty and exhilarated and bursting with energy! The Siam Kriya is another favorite Kundalini Yoga set of mine and I am so happy to finally have it on DVD with great music and Ana and Ravi guiding the way.

3680596,5,B001L54TQY,"I love all things yoga, especially kundalini yoga.  Practicing kundalini yoga has helped me make major shifts in my life, body, mind and soul.  When I got my hands on ""Kundalini Yoga Flow Boot Camp"", I was excited.  As soon as I began the the first yoga flow set, I knew I was going to be in heaven for the next hour or so, namely because of the combination of ""vinyasa""-type yoga and kundalini.

The first yoga flow set really helped me get anchored into my body and align with my breath, so by the time I got to the second yoga flow set, I was ready to expand and soften.  And expand I did!  I felt like this set expanded me in the most stagnant area of my body: my hips.  Ana incorporates Pigeon Pose in this set, which is my all-time favorite pose.  (*note for beginners: please don't try full pigeon pose unless you've had experience, because this one could get a little dicey if you have not built up enough flexiblility.)

Since I also have chronic tightness in my shoulders from my awesome desk job, ""Ringing the Bells of Heaven"" was the perfect antedote to unlock my knotty shoulders!  At one point, I actually felt my sternum pop and felt my solar plexus expand, which actually made me start laughing...and because of the legnth of time you are consistently doing these challenging upper body exercises, the laughter couldn't have come at a better time.  It was awesome!

I was amazed at how powerful I felt while completeing the Siam Kriya...but this is definitely not easy!  The beautiful meditations they ended with were just really the perfect ending to what is, in my humble opinion, the perfect full-body/mind workout.

This DVD gets a perfect rating from me and I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to expand and strengthen on ALL levels!

Sat nam!",1299888000,4,1772,4.545741324921136
3680597,5,B001L54TQY,OMG!! you really out did yourself Ana! This is a great workout!! I have all 22 of your dvd's..Great job! What a challenge.,1299715200,2,122,4.3478260869565215
3680598,5,B001L54TQY,"This is my favorite Raviana DVD so far, and I have all of them. It is action packed. They have managed to make the energizing and strengthening benefits of ashtanga yoga available to those of us who can't hold chatturanga or other challenging poses. This DVD is short on spiritual advice, focusing on the movements themselves. It contains great hip openers including variations on pigeon pose.

Ana is so personable that you want to do whatever she suggests, and she gives you permission to come out and go back into a posture that's too challenging to hold. As long as you go back into the flow when you can, you will get something out of this video.

The most challenging posture is the lunge with the top of the back foot on the ground. Just when I patted myself on the back for being able to hold it for the minute they taught it on the DVD, they let us know the yogis held it for a half hour.

The most challenging exercise to continue for 8 minutes was a bell-ringing movement, simple to do a few times, but work to maintain. Ravi and Ana are wonderful at finding ways to engage us with easy to do postures that we can build our stamina in over time.

The music is motivating without being intrusive.

The meditation is a simple mantra that doesn't require a lot of explanation.

Thank you for this great video. Can't wait to try the other new one.",1299283200,27,1354,4.374501992031872
3680599,5,B001L54TQY,"I've been so excited for Raviana's two new DVDs to be released, as I know many others have as well...let me tell you that the wait has been worth it! I did this entire DVD all the way through and they kicked my Kundalini yoga bum, but I loved every minute of it! I have all their other DVDs, but had kind of reached a rut and plateau; emotionally and physically...this is just what I needed to bust me out of it. I truly love it. It's an incredible workout and the exercises are all-new ones...not repeated from any of their earlier DVDs. It made me perspire, but left me feeling invigorated, not drained. The music is great...it's kind of an East Indian dance club style at times, and feel-good Indian music, which is great to keep you going and energized when things get tough! The background is the same one as their last couple sets of DVDs. Ana looks wonderful and has such cute outfits as usual.(One of her shirts is a pink/black/gray camo that says Major Cutie across the front. You will want to salute Major Cutie for sure!)
Here is a break-down and description of the program:
INTRO: 1:08
(Just an overview of the DVD)
TUNE-IN: 2:20
(the usual Ong Namo Guru Dev Namo, but with different music than their previous ones)
YOGA FLOW PART 1: 9:00
You begin standing...there is not the usual seated spinal grinds and floor warm-ups. You start in a slight squat and twist slightly while raising opposite arms. Then you do a Power Yoga style Sun Salutation sequence with several variations. You also do a chair pose with breath of fire(rapid breathing through the nose.)
YOGA FLOW PART 2: 15:00
You do more Sun Salutations variations with hip opening exercises...rocking back and forth in lunge, sitting on one leg with one leg outstretched with Breath of Fire. Also, you do chair pose with Breath of Fire again. And you do Pigeon Pose(coming into it from Down Dog).
KUNDALINI CORE POWER: 7:54
You start on your back doing hip raises with your arms above you on the floor. Also, alternate leg and arm lifts. You do Stretch Pose(for those who don't know, this is done lying on your back with head, shoulders, and legs raised). In this variation, you have your arms raised next to your thighs and Breath of Fire. I found this made it harder! You also do double leg lifts with your legs wide and then criss-crossing them; again with Breath of Fire.
RINGING THE BELLS OF HEAVEN(UPPER BODY BOOT CAMP): 22:00
You start with chanting ""Sa Ta Na Ma"" with your arms parallel to the floor, moving them forward, side, and back in rhythm with the chant. Next, you do 8 minutes of an incredible segment...you raise your arms alternately straight up, bringing one down, elbow bent, next to your side, as the other raises while opening and closing your fingers(opening on up, closing on down). Like you're alternating reaching upwards and coming down with each arm. You do the Breath of Fire the whole time. Your head is slightly raised upwards. The music is perfect for this invigorating, liberating segment. It's total feel good!, even though it can be challenging. I felt like I could go on forever...almost!! I felt so happy and powerful...I can't wait to do it again. Then you rest on your back, then repeat the first exercise(the Sa Ta Na Ma one). Next, sitting, fists down next to your hip, doing a slight twist with your head staying forward. Then, arms parallel to the floor and raising them up over your head and back to parallel, palms up. You repeat this for several minutes. Next, head dropped back, doing half circles with the neck.
DEEP RELAXATION: 3:27
Very soothing relaxation that leaves you with a sense of well-being.
SIAM KRIYA: 15:53
You come into a lunge, toes NOT curled under on your back foot(the top of your foot is resting on the floor instead). You raise the knee of your back leg off the floor. So, it's just like a lunge, but with the top of your foot on the floor instead. Your hands are in prayer pose. You hold this for a little over one minute. It's challenging to do, even though it may not sound like it. It was once a sacred practice of southeast Asia; done by a community of yogis. It was once done for 31 minutes! That gives me something to work for! Next you are in seated forward bend, holding your toes; pulling them back towards you. Your head is inclined upwards. Next, seated with your palms resting upwards in your lap, meditating with your focus 3 feet above your head, eyes closed.
MANTRA CHANT: 6:63
The mantra you chant is ""Ra Ra Ra Ra, Ma Ma Ma Ma, Sa Ta Na Ma"". Very enjoyable melody.
CLOSING PRAYER: 1:10
The usual closing prayer and Sat Nam.
(There is a short segment of Ana doing a fun dance after this)
BREATH PRIMER: 3:32
The breath primer is taken from their previous set of DVDs...the ones where Ana has her hair in a high pony and purple top and shorts.
WHITE SWAN MEDITATION: 4:00
This is done sitting with your fingers curled, thumbs meeting in front of your brow, eyes open. Then, you close your eyes, while still visualizing your thumbs in your mind's eye. Very calming music plays.

It comes with the following PRE-SETS, which are various combinations of the above segments:
(I personally didn't time these Pre-sets...I just wrote down the time from the DVD menu...I've heard these times aren't accurate from another Raviana fan...
BABY BOOT CAMP: 43:00
ESSENCE OF YOGA ANCIENT AND NEW: 49:00
BODY PRAYER: 42:00
SPIRITUAL UPLIFT: 63:00",1299110400,65,5386,4.587136929460581
3680600,3,B001L54TQY,"I just put this dvd in and could not do it.  I am too out of shape and going into plough was hard enough, but then sitting up? Forget it...you must be in shape for this dvd.  Sadly, I also prefer the old dvds with calmer music and less talk.  I will try this again, after I use the old dvds for a few months, and am feeling brave and fit.",1297036800,3,338,3.732394366197183
3680601,5,B001L54TQY,"With my attention span, I'll be honest, yoga DVDs sometimes bore me. I do often do them to relax but, until now, I haven't had many I crave doing.

This DVD was very different.

Music:
First of all, I love the music...relaxing but with energy. Not boring electronica. It's very enjoyable to hear in the background.

Instruction:
The DVD switches from the voice of one of the trainers to the other. It kept it interesting but they also have very...hmmm, trying to find the word I want here...I'm thinking ""happy"" voices. It imparts a good feeling, good energy, and goes well with the instruction. And that is the most important aspect...the instruction. If you have NEVER done yoga before, you will be told how to adjust your moves to fit your needs and how to move so that you get the best results by doing it correctly...the instruction is clear.  If you've been doing yoga for ages, you won't find redundancy and boredom in the instruction. It's natural and she is very comfortable on camera.

Time to workout:
I love this option! You say how much time you have to workout that day and you can customize your workout to fit your schedule.

Caloric Burn:
Granted, yoga is meant to stretch and tone muscles but I have to say...many aspects of this yoga DVD result in far better caloric burn than I've ever found in yoga DVDs in the past. I say this because I wear a bodybugg which not only measures my exact calorie burn during my workout, so that I can compare it to other DVDs, but it also shows any metabolic boost afterwards. This one was a calorie burner! A good one! That is in part due to the fact that it actually has some cardio moves in it but done very differently than any DVD I have had in the past (and, I can assure you, I have a pretty big fitness DVD library...it keeps me motivated...)they are oddly RELAXING while your heart rate is up and you are burning more calories...it's the music and the voice. Hard to explain but I loved it. Because she also adds in strength toning, it's just a fantastic overall workout...I usually mix up yoga, strength, and cardio. It did it for me. That kept it interesting for me, but also made me feel like I'd bought several DVDs rather than having just this one.

Easy to follow:
Some yoga DVDs are odd in that they have you do moves where you have to face away from the tv, yet they don't explain vocally what you should be doing so until you memorize the DVD, you get lost or do your poses wrong because you HAVE to look up. Not so here. This was kept in mind and when you have to look down or away, you are guided fully along whether the first or 100th time of doing it.

Equipment needed:
yoga mat and, during the cardio portion only, workout shoes if you are not working out on a soft surface.

Negatives: I typically try to balance out all my reviews on all products with positives and negatives but I really liked this DVD and, best yet, it hit deep muscles I don't always reach with my other workouts that I felt the next day.

Level: For all levels. You are told how to adapt your moves, or be challenged.

Time: 90 minutes total

Conclusion:
Favorite yoga DVD for me.",1285632000,11,3130,4.368330464716007
3680602,3,B001L54TQY,The DVD skips a ton and sometimes freezes.  Very frustrating when trying to have a yoga session.  I like the moves in this DVD but the narration is a bit weird.,1285459200,,160,4.129032258064516
3680603,5,B001L54TQY,WOOHOO! I feel simply brilliant after doing this DVD!!!! The cardio section had me grinning ear to ear the whole time which is very unusual for me during any type of exertion. I should have figured I could count on Ana & Ravi to make any type of workout enjoyable! This is a great combination of yoga stretching and strengthening and really terrific fun (and very simple to follow) dance moves. I appreciate that the dance moves multitask and hit major muscle groups as well (I feel my buns and thighs the next day) The workout is not too difficult no matter what your level of expertise!,1271894400,6,588,4.5046728971962615
3680604,5,B001L54TQY,"Typical gym workouts bore me and I'm constantly on the lookout for new and exciting ways to stay fit. This one rocks the house! I appreciate everything about this: the music, the selection of exercises, and the high energy. When I think about this workout it puts a smile on my face. I can honestly say I'm in better shape as a result of doing this and more cut as well. Kundalini Yoga/Cardio: best combination I've found!",1270771200,4,422,4.4935064935064934
3680605,3,B001L54TQY,"The workout was great as always, but the editing is enough to make you dizzy.  A lot of the time they don't keep one camera angle or distance for more than one count.

3680607,5,B001L54TQY,"I was feeling inspired today to get in shape for spring and did this wonderful workout. This (along with their Dance the Chakras) is the most fun I've ever had doing yoga. This features a complete (with lots of great ab work) Kundalini Yoga Workout and a cardio dance segment which is incredible. There is also an extended version of that cardio which you can do for 20 min. (otherwise it's 10 min.). There is also a warm-up and cool down, and lots of bonus material. Must have for everyone who wants to have their cake (yoga) and eat it too (cardio)!",1267660800,3,551,4.411764705882353
3680608,5,B001L54TQY,"I did this today and loved it!!! For me, it is the perfect amount of cardio and really gets my heart rate up in a short time! I like that the moves switch every 30 seconds which is long enough to feel a burn but short enough that it is virtually stress less on the joints.
I love that it features a core sequence I once did years ago in a live kundalini yoga class and have wanted to find it on a dvd ever since. The core sequence is a perfect blend of strengthening/stretching for the core and it leaves me feeling very bendy and refreshed.
I love that Ana is wearing cute boots for the dance section. The music and instruction are very nice too!",1266969600,3,647,4.102362204724409
3680609,3,B001L54TQY,"The music in the yoga section is fantastic and different to their older DVDs. However I preferred the Dance the Chakra dance section to this one. I thought dance moves did not flow gracefully.

I am looking forward to purchasing the CD of the music from their yoga DVDs.",1266796800,2,270,4.510204081632653
3680620,3,B001L54TQY,"I love Ravi Singh and Ana Brett and I own every one of their DVDs.  They introduced me to Kundalini Yoga and this is now the type of yoga I do most often.

That being said, this DVD is not one of my favorites.  I appreciate that they add creative twists to Kundalini yoga, but this one is not one of their better efforts.

What I liked about this DVD:

--the different music.  It's still new-agey, but with a faster beat.

--Ana is radiant and glowing, as always.  She is a joy to watch.

--Both Ravi and Ana give instruction.  I love hearing both their voices.

--the new moves.  In spite of making over 20 Kundalini yoga DVDs, Ravi and Ana manage to come up with new moves.

--how I feel after doing this DVD.  Like with their other DVDs, I feel calm, yet energized and happy.

What missed the mark with this DVD:

--the odd choice of scenery.  The workout is filmed against a backdrop picture from Hawaii (or maybe California).  It looks totally fake.  The lotus blossom and Buddha sitting in the left corner look out of place.

--the cardio section did not flow well at all.  This portion was very choppy.  Perhaps if Ravi had given some more explanation as to the purpose of each move, the moves would have made more sense to me.

--having to do the cardio section with shoes.  Excuse me, but yoga with shoes?  It breaks up the workout to have to stop the DVD, put on shoes and then come back to do a sloppily edited cardio section.

--the matrix doesn't work.  You can select maybe 3 sections and then the selector freezes.  I don't bother with the matrix anymore.

--Odd and inconsistent camera angles.  It's nice to see the poses from  different angles, but several poses must have been filmed at different times.  One part of a move shows Ana sitting lengthwise on the mat, the camera then switches to Ana sitting cross-wise on the mat continuing the move.  This may have been because of the re-editing they had to do, but if this wasn't the case, this is very distracting and to me shows sloppy editing.  Yes, the poses flow, but it's distracting.

--Stops and starts when switching scenes.  There are a few places where the DVD seems to stop and then quickly start again.  It's the editing and not the DVD. Again, this may have been because of some re-editing they had to do.

This DVD has a place in my collection, but I would recommend any of their older DVDs instead of this one.",1266192000,9,2393,4.391304347826087
3680621,5,B001L54TQY,"I love this one for its scope and power. Ana & Ravi have taken Kundalini Yoga and turned it into mainstream fitness and have managed to keep the spiritual depth of Kundalini Yoga. I have done other kinds of yoga and fitness but this is the first type of practice I've found which has lit a fire in me. I'm very motivated to work with Ana & Ravi's DVD's and I'm sure this will be a lifelong pursuit. I love how they keep things fun, but feed your soul at the same time. I love doing and watching the dance cardio segment. Ana just lights up the screen!",1264204800,2,551,4.111111111111111

3680623,3,B001L54TQY,"I have been doing yoga for about 4 years and have been unable to attend my yoga class recently so was looking for an alternative to heading to the studio. I read excellent reviews for Ana and Ravi's DVD's so I thought I would give them a try. I was not at all impressed. Although the yoga did provide me a workout, the cardio part was rather lame, to put it politely. I was looking to get my heart rate up and found myself doing my own workout throughout the cardio session. I would not suggest this DVD for people who have been practicing yoga for any length of time, or for people who are looking for a great cardio workout!",1251849600,2,626,4.181818181818182
3680624,4,B001L54TQY,"This DVD provides four separate Kundalini yoga routines incorporating use of a stability ball.  The workouts are led by Dr. Gabrielle Pelicci, Ph. D. (according to her web site, ""Dr. Gabrielle"" earned her doctorate degree in humanities).  During these workouts, Pelicci teaches via voiceover and does not provide mirrored cueing.  The workouts are set outdoors, alternating between two different canyon settings (as well as an indoor studio in the two shorter workouts only).  The four workouts on this DVD are of varying lengths and are listed on the Main Menu as follows:

*40 Minute Kundalini
*30 Minute Kundalini
*20 Minute Warm and Tone
*10 Minute Tone

The DVD case further describes the 20 minute workout as ""basic arms, legs, abs, core"" and the 10 minute workout as ""arms, legs, abs, core.""  As it turns out, the 40 and 30 minute routines are quite similar, as are the 20 and 10 minute routines.  With the exception of the 10 Minute Tone, all of the routines start out with about ten minutes of warm-up moves.  The 30-minute workout contains the same exercises as the 40-minute, just less of them.  As mentioned above, the 20-minute routine begins with a similar warm-up series to the two longer workouts. One thing that I found odd was that for the second half of this workout, the screen suddenly alternates between Pelicci and a second exerciser, a male who is shown in an indoor studio.  The 10-Minute ""Tone"" workout includes just the toning moves from the second half of the 20-minute practice (ie, without the opening warm-up series).  Both of the shorter workouts conclude seated briefly on the ball for the final prayer.

Some may find this DVD to be a nice alternative to the popular Ana Brett/Ravi Singh Kundalini offerings, as Pelicci's style is quite straightforward and down-to-earth, and there is a nice variety offered by the different workout lengths on this video.  Furthermore, unlike with Pelicci's other DVD,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Healthy-Sexy-Beautiful-Kundalini-Yoga-DVD/dp/B001VJTIUW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Healthy Sexy Beautiful Kundalini Yoga DVD</a>, which contains some very challenging core work, I think that the exercises offered here are more appropriate for all levels of practitioners, perhaps because the ball actually serves to modify some of the more difficult moves.  Overall, I found the routines on this DVD to feel like a fusion of Kundalini yoga and basic toning work with a stability ball.  On her web site, Pelicci offers clips of these workouts, so I suggest viewing these clips to determine if this mix of styles seems appealing.  Thus my final rating is 3-4 stars depending on whether this approach clicks for you.",1251504000,5,2725,5.2853828306264505
3680625,5,B001L54TQY,"Ravi Singh and Ana Brett's excellent collection of DVD's are my new favorite discovery! I was ready for something new and they deliver in spades with this dynamic workout. The first part includes warm-ups, deep stretching, and a core ab-burn workout. Then they present a great cardio workout. It's easy to follow if you're dance challenged like me. The cueing seems spot on. You can either do 10 min. or 20 min., with or without instruction. There is a movement primer to help you learn the moves. After the cardio there is an upper body set which is also amazing. In addition there is a deep relaxation and meditation. THey also provide pre-set workouts of varying time lengths. If you are a fitness person who also likes yoga, I highly recommend this.",1250640000,,753,4.712121212121212
3680626,5,B001L54TQY,"I was originally knocked out of my comfort zone when I saw the new look for Ana & Ravi's latest DVD's but seconds into the workout I started feeling my usual bliss and I realized that these are everything their older titles are and more. I love the new set and music. I think that some of the reviewers below don't understand Ana & Ravi's motivation, which is to inspire people to make the transition from fitness to yoga. The only way to do that is to have a modern look and feel to their programs. I have taken Ana & Ravi's workshops and they could care less about glitz. I believe that they have created these programs with a higher purpose in mind: to give people who already do yoga, and also people who normally wouldn't be interested in yoga, something which will inspire them to transform their lives. These new DVD's are so relevant to the times we live in. There are some challenging exercises but overall they're accessible to anyone at any fitness level. The Matrix Menu option let's you program the exact workout you're in the mood for, and there are also pre-sets if you'd like your workout to be under an hour.",1250640000,3,1125,4.4396135265700485
3680627,3,B001L54TQY,"If I could rate this DVD as 3 1/2 stars I would, as I feel that 3 stars is a little low, but 4 is definitely too high.
  Like most of the reviewers, I agree that this is a great workout.  It is pretty challenging, and you shouldn't do it if you're out of shape, or haven't done any yoga lately, as you could hurt yourself.  The core, stretching, and toning sections are fantastic.  Challenging, some new moves I haven't seen Ana & Ravi use before, and effective.  It is for these things that I will keep this DVD.
  Now, I have many of Ana & Ravi's DVDs.  The format of their older vids was fresh, simple, and fun.  I HATE this new production.  I'm open to change, I don't care that Ana's gone blond, but there is way too much noise.  Someone described the music as ugly and jarring; some of it's nice (and it's all the old music), but most of it IS ugly and jarring.  The new DVDs have too many distractions; the older productions were great because of their simplicity.  The new ones try too hard to be fun, different, and new; it's too techy, and this goes against the grain of what yoga should feel like.  Also, the cardio section was good, but I would have felt stupid if someone had walked in on me doing it.  Dance the Chakras and Fat Free Yoga covered cardio in ways that were far more enjoyable, and just as effective.
  If you want a good workout with a yoga twist, this one is worth purchasing.  Just be aware that the new format is annoying if you're used to the older DVDs.  I think if you buy ONE of the 3 newer DVDs, Yoga Radiance is the best one; the routine is good enough that I was able to tune out the things I didn't like about the new production.  With this DVD, though, I had a lot of trouble tuning out my dislikes.",1250380800,20,1739,4.13134328358209
3680628,5,B001L54TQY,"Ana & Ravi rock! There DVD's keep getting better and better. This one is the perfect workout. It has just enough of everything to please everyone at every fitness level.  I don't see how you can get any better. It has a great Kundalini set and an amazing dance-cardio segment that anyone can do. You can program an option for music only, as well as either a 10 or 20 minute cardio segment. Some of the reviewers below seem to be upset that Ana & Ravi are innovating a bit with regard to standard yoga fare. That's what creative people do. I love the set, the music, the whole vibe. I'm very grateful to Ana & Ravi for having the guts to make this DVD. Whatever your taste or inclination, your can program this workout to get just the type of workout you're looking for.

I found this to be so over the top ****** good that it makes me wonder what planet decade, or drug those other reviewers were on or in. This workout starts with some really interesting warm-ups, then It has a tone and stretch sequence that rocked my world, especially the core power plow sequence. Then there are some dance warm-ups and the amazing joyful cardio dance, following by another upper body strengthening set and two meditations. You can use the matrix to program your workout for however long you have. Whatever your level or inclination, there is plenty here for you to draw upon, get energized, healthy, and have a blast!  I LOVE THIS DVD!!!!",1249430400,3,727,4.635658914728682
3680630,1,B001L54TQY,"I have purchased other DVDs by Ana and Ravi before, but this one was a far departure from the others.  And not in a good way.  Unlike the Kundalini focused moves in their other DVDs, this one incorporates alot of ridiculous dance moves on a fake set while Ana totes around in white go-go combat boots.  Serioualy distracting.",1248480000,9,325,4.568965517241379
3680631,5,B001L54TQY,"Kundalini is such fun anyway. You get great cardio with this DVD; but then Ana and Ravi make it so spiritual at the same time...it's amazing how the movement gets your energy flowing and your chakras clean and your meditation going...sigh...it's wonderful. If you've ever wanted more in your yoga, something different, something fun, with movement and high energy, then try this. It is for you!!

I teach yoga--therapeutic, beginners, intermediate, advanced--almost everything in this dvd can be transferred to one of my classes with a little work. I can slow it down and my students can get a lot from it or go full tilt and we enjoy ourselves fully. It can work for you too!",1247097600,2,676,4.777777777777778
3680632,3,B001L54TQY,"I have like 10 of ana and Ravi's dvds. MY most fav are the fat free and the ultimate stretch. I really liked the push ups in this and the abdominal exercise, wow I felt that for 2 days but I didn't like the cardio moves in this dvd but I love Ana and Ravi's kundalini Yoga. Please keep on bringing new moves and exercises. Thanks",1246320000,3,329,4.0
3680633,5,B001L54TQY,"This routine is no holds bar.  I thought for sure I'd be in for some regular routine/movements from Ana's previous DVDs.  I was wrong.  This routine is tough.  It had me doing moves I did not think they would put into a DVD.  That is great!  I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who is looking to do cardio/dance routines/yoga inspired workouts.  This workout is far better than any Belly Dance workout DVD I have done to date.  I love the side crunches and the background featured.  I have to say I am in love with the chant/mantra to finish.  Highly recommended.  Do not be scared to rock and roll with this DVD.  I am not a person who easily sweats, and this entire workout had me sweating.  I am impressed and pleased with my purchase.  I hope you are too.  Namaste Amazon Friends!",1245283200,4,786,4.361111111111111

3680635,5,B001L54TQY,"This workout is challenging.  The ab/core section with the rollover plow and variation could only be done with a little help...this one I need to work up too and I thought I had a strong core.  I sometimes skip the cardio sections and do everything else (since I get alot of cardio elsewhere) which gives satisfaction in and of itself.  If I am lagging on my other cardio I will include it (although I a not big on this type of cardio via dvds...I would rather go for a run or hike).  I would like to reiterate how awesome all the other sections are!!!  So so good :-).  Yummy to the yogi tummy.  This one opened alot of stuck energy in the upper shoulders and oddly I felt the surge of release in my muscle unlike any other opening of energies from other yoga sequences in the past.  Therefore, I associate this workout with that release of tension and crave it in my yoga rotation.",1243382400,3,883,4.3090909090909095

3680637,5,B001L54TQY,I am a classic exercise intolerant type so it surprised me more than anyone when I took to this workout like a duck to water. I love Ana & Ravi's fun approach and the music on this is SO inspiring. It makes it so easy to get into the workout. Beginner beginners will want to pace themselves somewhat but it's doable for everyone and is the perfect tape for all levels. Ana is a joy to watch and work with and Ravi's voice is so soothing. You can use the Matrix Menu option to come up with the perfect workout for your schedule. There's nothing not to like here. I could go on gushing all day.,1241654400,2,592,4.112068965517241
3680638,5,B001L54TQY,"I got this 3 days ago and love it so much i have done it everyday since. I've been using Ana & Ravi's excellent dvds for a couple of years-- I didn't love yoga before their dvds but now, I am hooked! Recently a friend talked me into trying a week of different yoga styles and I have to say, while I found certain aspects interesting, I found I could do an hour of any style, from bikram to iyengar, and i didn't feel like i did anything!  Nothing challenges me as much as Kundalini Yoga and afterwards I felt like I really had accomplished something. If you have done any of Ana & Ravis workouts none of this will seem too unfamiliar. This is a great Kundalini Yoga set that has an excellent section for the core and the dance is less free style than Dance the Chakras (which I love too!) but is definitely different from anything else you may have done and is as challenging as you decide to make it. There are lots of ways to make different workouts with your Matrix as well.  Enjoy!!",1241222400,,986,4.211640211640212
3680639,1,B001L54TQY,"I would NOT recommend this DVD.  It is a serious disappointment.  The graphics are poor.  Anna does her routines in front of an obvious static set that is more distracting than calming.  The cardio section is weak.  She dances around and looks rather ridiculous. She is also off beat several times.  I expect that a cardio workout would be more involved.  There is none of the umph or even excitement that she has in the Dance the Chakras DVD (which I also have and would HIGHLY recommend).

I have 11 Ana and Ravi DVD's.  All of which I adore!  This Cardio, Stretch, and Strengthen is so far below their typical quality that I am surprised that there are so many positive reviews for it.  If you get a Ana Ravi DVD, skip this and go for their older workouts.  You'll be glad you saved the cash.",1241222400,12,795,4.36986301369863
3680650,5,B001L54TQY,"This DVD lets me customize my routine by selecting the duration of my workout.  If I'm in a rush but I need to fit in a work out I can always select the 10 or 20 minute core workout.  I love the 40 minute workout, but I can't always fit that into my schedule so this DVD is great.  The exercises are fun and challenging which I personally don't always find in workouts at the gym.  In this workout they do!!  I haven't mastered all of the poses yet, but that is the beauty of it.  It gives me focused goals to work toward in my yoga journey.

3680652,5,B001L54TQY,"This DVD has it all.  The ""Matrix"" menu to select your own workout.  The exercises are streamlined.  Ana is as graceful as a swimmer.  The set is amazing; there is a background of a body of water, sky, mountains, and foliage. The music is amazing.  Wow!  It must be a difficult bill to fill to have great music with great Yoga every time.  It is all coordinated. What makes this DVD unique, besides what I mention, is that the cardio segment is like dance movements.  As usual, there is excellent instruction on proper breathing.  Ana looks great as usual, and there are the usual pearls of wisdom by Ravi and Ana throughout.  Aside from the usual tune-in, there are spinal exercises, and stretching exercises. There is a really great exercise, where you go from lying down to plow.  Then more tummy sit-up exercises. Back to plow again, alternately. Then there are exercises on your knees, lifting the leg back, alternately with knees forward.  There are brief meditation moments throughout, between exercises. Then, from a lying down position, Ana lifts legs and moves them apart, hand going through the legs. There are more unique tummy exercises, a variation of crunches. Then, on her tummy, Ana lifts her legs and arms.  Then Ana demonstrates the cardio dance routines and exercises, after a warm-up.  They all flow well.  Very good direction by Ana and Ravi.  She is a very graceful dancer. It is all doable.  I need these for my bone density.  There are modifications given onscreen. Again, great music. This goes on for several minutes.  Then there is a flowing cool down. Then there is stretching.  There is an upper-body segment with a variation of down dogs, and lifting legs back and up.  Then sitting, lifting arms in different ways.  Then there is deep relaxation.  There is a mantra that you sing along with Ana, and the closing prayer before the credits.  Now, there is a breathing meditation exercise.  There is a segment where all the dance moves are broken down and explained.

Excellent production!  A great workout for all levels! Entertaining and fun!",1238112000,2,2073,4.815340909090909
3680653,5,B001L54TQY,This DVD appeals on many levels. It is filmed in a beautiful setting. The music is upbeat and interesting. The yoga is doable and makes you feel great. The workout is varied to keep you challenged. It conveys the spiritual benefits of yoga through mantra without being heavy handed about it. It's great exercise and doesn't feel like a typical yoga class at all. This was my first yoga experience since shoulder surgery 4 months ago. It felt like coming home. Wonderful.,1238025600,2,470,4.7439024390243905
3680654,5,B001L54TQY,"This is my fourth Raviana DVD purchase after finding success with their previous DVDs, Fat Free Yoga, Kundalini Beginner & Beyond, and Ultimate Stretch. So I purchased this one along with the new Yoga Beginner & Beyond. I haven't gone through this entire DVD yet, but I have done one of the preset work outs and I am sold! I have never been a fan of your ""conventional"" type of exercise, such as gyms, weight lifting, aerobics, etc. When I tried all that stuff, it always felt like a chore for me, so I was never that consistent with it. Exercise should not feel like a chore! It should be something you look forward to, because it makes you feel fantastic both inside and out!

I thought I would give a more personalized review of this DVD by giving an example of how it has affected my own life. Over all, doing this along with the rest of the Raviana's DVDs has a major impact on my mood, and makes me feel much more radiant, energetic and happier! I feel like I don't sweat the small stuff as I used to. I live in Canada and this week we have unfortunately been experience some extended winter weather..cold, snow, all that depressing stuff. I can honestly say after exploring the new DVDs, the weather has not affected my mood like it normally does! True, it is a pain to keep putting on all those winter clothes, when all you want to do is get out the shorts and the sandals and bring on the springtime weather. But I have remained quite resilient throughout the week, despite the bitter cold and snow! People at work and my friends have actually commented on my bubbly nature this week!

I find the cardio section in this DVD to be effective and fun, and it certainly made me break out into a sweat. I don't know of it is the cardio combined with the Kundalini Yoga techniques that worked so well for me, but I know I have finally found a type of exercise that I can stick with for life.",1238025600,4,1894,4.317415730337078
3680655,4,B001L54TQY,"This new kundalini yoga DVD by Gabrielle Pellicci is wonderful.  She gives a brief introduction to kundalini and how regular practice can improve anyone's flexibility,inner peace and balance.  I have quite a collection of yoga DVD's and have practiced yoga for years, but I find that kundalini does indeed provide benefits distinct from other types of yoga. Beginners will appreciate the smooth flow of the DVD, the interesting music, and most of all, the smiling and peaceful enjoyment that Gabrielle shows in every exercise.  Learning the breath of fire and the best body positions to protect the lower back take a little practice.  She performs the sets with background scenes that change every few seconds - this is a nice effect.  Even though you can keep your eyes closed and follow her cues, the scenery for the filming is just too beautiful to miss so I keep peeking throughout!  I especially like the choice of exercise set length - from 10 minutes to 40 minutes.  Kundalini yoga offers lifelong benefits for anyone - start now and you will want to continue!",1237852800,7,1067,4.861878453038674
3680656,5,B001L54TQY,"I own all of the Ana and Ravi DVD's (well excluding one...but anyhow...)  This is a well organised workout - the transitions between exercises are smooth and well executed, the flow between focus areas such as core, upper body etc are thoughtfully and effectively segmented.  Absolutely love the cardio, Ana sports a really funky pair of boots which is consistent with whole ""fun"" aspect of this workout.

In conclusion, I feel brilliant after this workout, no food cravings and get through the day pretty balanced and happy.

Would definitely recommend it.",1237852800,5,557,5.087912087912088
3680657,5,B001L54TQY,"This past Saturday, my husband and I worked out to Ana Brett and Ravi Sing's new title: Kundalini Yoga Cardio, Stretch and Strengthen.  The plan was that my husband would work out to the DVD with me and then he would go to the gym and lift weights on his own.  Once we completed the Kundalini work out, he said there was no need to go to the gym at all!!!

We agreed that if we did this workout consistently, we would be in great shape for the summer.  I think there is something to the breath of fire that speeds up your metabolism.  The exercises themselves don't appear difficult because you are not sweating excessively or losing your breath like in more traditional cardio regimes.  But trust me, you are getting a work out. I lost 5 lbs very quickly once doing just Ana and Ravi videos (but unfortunately gained it back when I fell off the work out wagon and instead indulged in emotional eating)

As always, love the music with a middle eastern bent which inspires me to keep going.  The meditations in between the exercises are also special, since they bring you back to the fact this practice involves mind body and soul.

When my husband was first introduced to Ana and Ravi, he initially laughed and thought it was one of my new age activities that he didn't want to get involved in.  But he tried it once, and is a beliver too. It's just nice we can do something together that is beneficial to us as individuals.",1237766400,5,1424,4.380228136882129
3680658,3,B001L54TQY,"I was excited to see a new DVD by Ravi and Ana. I have a few of their videos and wanted to spice up my collection. I didn't like this one that much because the strength portion for the core would be way too difficult for the average person--rolling in and out of plow pose made me really uncomfortable, and I am 27 year old exercise junky in pretty good shape. I also think the cardio portion was sort of dull compared to Dance the Chakras. Lastly, the text for the menu was so small I couldn't even read it, and I have 20/20 vision. On the plus side, Ana looks gorgeous with her natural hair color, the scenery in the background is beautiful and gives you something to take your mind off of 6 agnozing minues of Breath of Fire in the beginning of the workout, and as usual Ravi's voice is like music to the ears. This was not for me, but I'm sure other people will love it.",1237680000,20,874,4.116959064327485
3680659,5,B001L54TQY,"This has it all.  I read all the other reviews and agree with most of it. Since they reviewed the play by play of what you get I won't rewrite that.  But I will say - I have & love all the DVDs from Ana and Ravi.  This new series definitely shows they reviewed feedback and included many improvements.  The music is so motivating and powerful.  The moves on this DVD are varied and all you need to stay in basic shape & great health.  stretches, dancing, and breathing.  It is FUN to workout. Ana really exudes fun, lightness and inner peace. The backdrops are gorgeous outdoor scenes.  I LOOK FORWARD to working out.  There is a lot packed in here and  you get so much information for your money investment and yet, you can do what you can and rest where you need to and watch how you improve over time.  The speaking portions are gentle and encouraging and informative (ie which body parts/organs are benefitting).  I feel like a winner every time no matter how well I keep up or don't.  Just showing up and doing what you can is the key.  And when you improve, this video will still challenge you - that's what I love.  It caters to all levels.  There are windows that pop up with Ana doing the ""easier"" versions of some of the poses/stretches which is great.  I was so impressed with this video.",1237593600,6,1299,4.323651452282157
3680660,5,B001L54TQY,"I am a Ravi and Ana fan, I have been using their DVD's for about a year now. I bought this a couple weeks ago because I loved their other new DVD, ""Energy for Super Radiance"" so much and was eager to try this one. I absolutely love it! I am not a dancer, and never have been, but the dance section in this is so much fun and makes you feel confident and get a workout.
I have added this into my circulation of RaviAna DVD's that I use daily.
The upper body tone and strengthen section is fantastic. The music is so upbeat and helped me really get into it. The longer, deeper relaxation was nice after completing the workout.
I like the fact that there is a 'Pre-set Selections' option on the menu. Instead of using the Matrix menu option to make your own workout with the chapters like on their older DVD's (they still have this option as well however) you can click on the Pre-set Selections' and they have 30 minute to I believe 60 minute pre-set selections.",1237420800,3,960,4.251366120218579
3680661,4,B001L54TQY,"First I would like to say that I am a big fan of Ana and Ravi. I have a lot of their DVDs and I think they are amazing!
  Now: am I the only one who has problem reading the sub menu? The letters are so tiny, it is impossible to read! (My eye site is ok) Seriously, I had to print out a review, posted here by other thorough customer with all the names of all chapters in the matrix menu! These three new DVDs by Ana and Ravi are the only ones out of all of theirs I have that have the font for the matrix menu too small. Also, this new Cardio DVD I've got is defective: when using the matrix to create my own work out I have problem selecting more then 6 items (when selecting them not in raw as they listed on the menu, but  skipping one or two items - cannot select farter more, the screen gets ""frozen"").
  I like everything on this DVD but cardio sections. I really don't like cardio semi-dancing on this DVD at all. I have been taking dance classes for years, I love dancing, but this segment of the DVD feels (to me) as a waste of time: not yoga, not dancing. Then again - different strokes for different folks...  When I was ordering it, I thought that it would be more like their `Fat Free Yoga"" DVD where they have a `No Impact Aerobics' chapter...
  I liked it better when they had Ana on the white background with a lot of close-ups. If they would keep producing the new DVDs in the same way I would be happy. The three new DVD's :' Kundalini Yoga for Energy & Super Radiance', `Yoga For Beginners & Beyond' and this one, `Kundalini Yoga Cardio ,Stretch,& Strengthen' have some nature background and Ana is shown more at the distance. Also, in the video during one of the lengthy exercises, Ana has two different hairdos: a ponytail and the hair down. The feeling that you are doing the exercise together with Ana gets lost: it is obvious that this particular exercise was not shot in one peace.
There is no doubt, that Ana and Ravi put a lot of effort and heart into their new production: new set, new music, new look. I am so used to their ""old"" DVDs that I detected some resistance when noticing the differences between previous and new productions. I will give it some time to get used to.
Re: Ana's new look: I liked it better when she had dark hair, but she looks beautiful in any color...
In conclusion:  I would still like to have this DVD (not defective, though), but I will avoid doing the cardio parts on this DVD.",1237334400,9,2436,4.210300429184549
3680662,4,B001L54TQY,"Kundalini Yoga: Cardio, Stretch, & Strengthen is one of three new DVDs from the husband/wife team of Ravi Singh/Ana Brett.  As with their previous videos, the workout features Ana alone on screen while she and Ravi take turns providing voiceover instruction.  However, gone is the plain white studio and the furry little rug; here Ana uses a traditional yoga mat, and she practices on a raised platform, surrounded by columns and against a painted backdrop of a tranquil lake scene.  In the Introduction to this workout, Ana states that Kundalini Yoga: Cardio, Stretch, & Strengthen provides a complete kundalini yoga practice combined with dance cardio for a fun workout.  She recommends that you wear shoes for the cardio portion if you do not have a soft surface available (Ana herself is wearing calf boots laced up halfway).

The Main Menu of this DVD reads as follows:
*Play DVD
*Chapter Selections
*Design your own Workout Matrix Menu Option
*Matrix Tutorial
*Pre-Set Selections

With these new DVDs, Ravi and Ana have offered a Matrix; this option allows you to customize your own workout by selecting any of the chapters in any order (up to 15 total) to create your own yoga practice.  Each DVD also has Pre-Set Selections which provide a variety of additional routines.  The Pre-Set practices on this DVD are as follows (includes times in minutes):

Beginners Cardio Plus (49:30)--Warm-Ups only; Movement Breakdown plus Cardio
Yoga Only Pre-Set (42:30)--no Cardio
Kundalini Cardio Plus Super Set (49:30)--Cardio plus Extended Dance and Core
Kundalini Yoga Plus Cardio Intermediate (61:00)--both yoga and cardio sets

Here is the Chapter Selection breakdown (includes times in minutes):
*Introduction (1:21)
*Tune-In (1:50)
*Warm-Ups (5:13)
*Stretching Plus Core (15:32)
*Kundalini Dance Cardio Warm-Up Flow and Cardio (15:02)
*Kundalini Dance Cardio Cool Down (3:16)
*Upper Body Tune and Tone (11:39)
*Deep Relaxation (5:17)
*Ek Ong Kar Chant (5:19)
*Closing Prayer (2:43)
*Breath Primer (5:30)
*Dance Movement Breakdown (7:51)
*Extended Dance (21:00)
*Dance with Music Only (10:47)

From the Tune-In through the Closing Prayer, the main practice is just under 72 minutes long.  In the Warm-Ups, Ravi and Ana include moves familiar from their past workouts, such as stomach grinding, but also add some new moves, such as swimming.  The Stretching Plus Core starts with a long sequence where you sit in half-hero's pose, bend forward over one leg, and engage in Breath of Fire (BOF).  This segment becomes even more challenging with many repetitions of plow pose and then a series in which plow pose flows into a move similar to a half-Pilates teaser.  Core Plus includes work on hands and knees, extended yogic sit-up variations, and prone work.  The Upper Body segment begins with dolphin push-ups and then moves into more traditional kundalini work for the upper body--i.e., various arm movements performed rapidly while engaging in BOF (this section left my triceps sore the next day!).  The chant included at the end of this practice is ""Ek Ong Kar Sat Nam, Siri Wahay Guru""; the Deep Relaxation, Closing Prayer, and Breath Primer segments are similar to what Ravi and Ana have offered on their previous DVDs.

One of the things I was most interested in about this new DVD was the cardio portion, as I loved Ravi and Ana's previous DVD which included cardio, Dance the Chakras (DTC).  Some of the moves here do have that same kind of loose, dance-y feel as the DTC dances--for example, the ""Shiva Dance"" and the ""Punching Hip Hop.""  On the other hand, there are many different jumping jack variations included as well, so overall, the cardio work is significantly higher impact and more intense than in DTC (although lower impact options are shown).  As Ana points out, no move is performed for more than 30 seconds, so the cardio is quite doable.  In the Movement Breakdown, Ana reviews each exercise briefly in slow motion.  The Extended Dance features the same moves, just more repetitions, and finally, the Music Only option offers Ana dancing to the music with no instruction.

A few final things to note.  First of all, the font used for the DVD menus, especially the submenus, is VERY small--so small, in fact, that I found it impossible to read the submenu selections on my 13"" workout room TV (although when I played the DVD on my computer, the text appeared clearer).  Overall, this DVD is very well-done, but as I was hoping for something more similar to Dance the Chakras, I was a bit disappointed; I didn't enjoy the cardio segments as much as I'd hoped, and I thought that the yoga sets weren't as well-rounded as the various other Ravi and Ana DVDs that I have tried.  Still, I think that most Ravi and Ana fans are likely to enjoy this DVD, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to them.",1236556800,4,4819,4.968866749688668
3680663,5,B001L54TQY,"I have been an Ana and Ravi addict for almost 2 years now.  I used to kill myself at the gym for hours everyday.  I didn't enjoy it, but felt that it was a necessary evil.  On a whim I ordered one, Dance the Chakras and have been addicted ever since. I used to try to get up in the AM before work to workout and could never make myself get out of bed.  However, now I get up at 5 am during the week just to do Yoga in the morning because I couldn't imagine living without it!  I'm happier, calmer, and more capable due to yoga.  In fact, last year, I was able to remain calm when a colleague was choking and gave her the Heimlich.  I believe that I was able to do this in a calm manner because I've been more centered due to Ana and Ravi's Kundalini Yoga.
Although I love ALL their DVDs, and all of their new DVDs, this is my favorite.  It is very challenging (I would rate it somewhere between Fat Free, and Warrior Workout for difficulty; see other reviews for a description) but I want to do it all the time. I feel great while I'm doing it and I feel so happy and energized afterward!  All 3 of their new DVDs are fabulous in their own way, but this one really speaks to me.  I hope it will brighten your day too!",1236211200,16,1217,3.97119341563786
3680664,5,B001L54TQY,"Once again, Ravi and Ana have created a fabulous, challenging, FUN workout! Each time I do this DVD, I can really feel that my body has gotten a great workout, but beyond that, I feel positive and filled with wellbeing. What an amazing gift these talented teachers have!

Other reviewers have beautifully outlined details of the practice, so you can look to those for information about the specific movements you'll find here. One wonderful feature is the Matrix which allows you to customize depending on the time you have available and the type of workout you'd like for the day.

The workouts are great, fun and full of energy, Ana's rock star boots make me feel like a rock star too, and the Ek Ong Kar chant is beautiful and puts me in a wonderful place. I highly, highly recommend this joyful and wonderful DVD!!",1236038400,4,818,4.63448275862069
3680665,4,B001L54TQY,"This is one fun DVD.  It's got the new set, new music, and new look for Ana.  (Keep your eye out for her in her white Doc Martens for the cardio segment!)
You will probably want to wear shoes for the cardio portions of this DVD as they suggest.  There is some impact in the cardio moves, and depending on the comfort & health of your feet shoes are a good idea.
It's yoga and it's cardio.  Great combo, great results.

3680666,5,B001L54TQY,"I am completely devoted to Ravi and Ana's workouts and this most recent DVD is amazing.  I own two of almost all their DVDs (in case one breaks). The moves are fresh and new, but still in keeping with the tradition of their older workouts.  Every time I do this workout I just naturally feel happy and it puts a smile on my face (truly - it just happens).  I also feel stretched, strengthened and vibrant.  I watch all my friends go to spinning classes, do weights and run on the treadmill and all they ever say is how good I look!  I just do these DVDs at home, plus some Callanetics, and I look better than everybody -- without any pain or wear on my body.  I am 42 years old  (with four kids) and feel and look better than ever thanks to these DVDs. Everyday I need a daily dose of Raviana to make me happy.",1236038400,8,810,4.0886075949367084
3680667,5,B001L54TQY,"I don't think there is a muscle inside my body that has not been moved by this workout! I enjoyed every segment of this workout immensely. I just finished it and I feel so full of energy despite working my butt off. I know some parts of me will definitely be sore tomorrow...

I found the core and upper body segments to be very challenging. The cardio segment was fun to do and I found myself laughing a few times. I started to sweat while doing the core segment and I continued to sweat all the way through the cardio segment. There is a brief cool down, then back to sweating again during the upper body and tone segment. By the time I made it through that one, I couldn't do anything BUT relax. The deep relaxation was a welcome reward. I like that the deep relaxation seems to be longer on these new DVDs. I sometimes have to pause the old ones to allow myself a little more time to fully relax.

I love, love, love, the Ek Ong Kar mantra at the end. The music is awesome and really catchy. It feels wonderful to be able to let go and sing your heart out after doing all the hard work.

These new DVDs may seem quite different to some people at first but it is so worth it to do them a few times and let them work their Kundalini magic! You may be surprised ;)",1235952000,8,1265,4.092741935483871
3680668,5,B001L54TQY,"This DVD, plus Kundalini Yoga for Energy & Super Radiance!, really are what Ana and Ravi claim - complete total-body workouts. Both DVDs have stretch, cardio, toning and strength elements and more than enough challenges to keep you motivated (and at times frustrated). But unlike conventional total-body workouts, these DVDs will leave you feeling both calm and energized.

I'm still undecided as to which DVD I prefer, but I can see myself using&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kundalini-Yoga-for-Energy-Super-Radiance-ALL-LEVELS-with-Ana-Brett-and-Ravi-Singh/dp/B001L54TR8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kundalini Yoga for Energy & Super Radiance! ALL LEVELS - with Ana Brett and Ravi Singh</a>&nbsp;a lot more in its entirety, while there are certain segments in this DVD (eg the ab and upper body segments) which would be great as ""add-ons"" to other workouts.

Here is what I like the most about Cardio, Stretch and Strength:

1.  Breath of fire for 6 minutes straight!
2.  The ab section. Very original and very effective. You can really feel it the next day. There are no boat poses here. Plow (my favourite inversion pose) is used as an ab toner and then combined with a modified teaser (Ana calls it a yoga sit-up).
3.  The cardio dance segment has lots of fun moves (crazy legs, shiva dance, fan yourself, paddling) and music which stays in your head for hours. When I first did this segment, I was a bit distracted by the slow motion at the start, but now that I know the routine it doesn't bother me. Yes, there are jumping jacks but you don't have to do them. I won't do jumping jacks for anyone - Tony Horton and Chalene can't make me do them and Ravi won't either!
4.  Long relaxation followed by the Adi Shakti mantra.

By the way, all three of Raviana's new DVDs are ""winners"" for me. They are wonderful, unique, at times challenging workouts with excellent (as always) instruction, demonstrated to perfection by Ana. And yes, she looks absolutely gorgeous!",1235952000,8,2012,5.246105919003115
3680669,5,B001L54TQY,"This workout was so good that I want more!!!! I don't know how Ravi & Ana can put me in such a good mood! I had the dvd for a couple of weeks and I couldn't try it due to a knee injury. I was kind of blue today and decided to give this DVD a try even though I wasn't supposed to (I need to rehab my knee for 3 more weeks and I'm not allow to workout yet - per my physical therapist).

I'm glad I decided to do this dvd today!!!! My mood is up now, I'm full of energy and I'm very happy!!! That's how I feel every time I finish one of Raviana's dvds. This one in particular is sooooo much fun. I love dance the chakras and I wasn't sure whether this DVD would even come close. But it did!!! I love the stretches and strengthening exercises and all the core work. The dance/cardio segment was so much fun!!!! I just wish it was longer!! The arms segment was tough! And the mantra at the end was pretty good!!!!

Finally the music on this dvd totally rocks!!!! It definitely makes me smile!!!!!!

Ravi & Ana, please make another kundalini cardio/dance DVD (but longer 40-60 minutes)!!!!!!! In sum, I loved it loved it loved it!!!!!! :o)",1235865600,3,1133,4.117647058823529
3680680,5,B001L54TQY,"Have you ever skied down a mountain and all the way down you're experiencing an exhilarating blend of all the emotions you can think of and you realize you've never been more truly alive? Well, that's how I feel when I'm doing this new DVD series from Ana & Ravi. I have come to expect the most  from these two yogis and these new ones exceed my expectations! The great music, the variety (and effectiveness!!) of the exercises, the delightful and inspirational commentary, the accessibility for people of every level, and, I have to mention Ana's hair and outfits - I can never get enough of watching her. She is radiance embodied!!

Everything about this DVD has a pulse and is imbued with spirit. That's what makes Kundalini Yoga taught by Ana and Ravi so special. It moves you from a deep place inside. Re: the reviewer who complained the music is ""loud"" and not appropriate for yoga? Well thats because this is Kundalini Yoga!!!!!!  One thing that's so great about Ana & Ravi's DVD's is that the music has some edge to it and gives you that extra bit of drive to power you through. Have you ever tried to do cardio without great music to motivate you? The alignment tips as well as inspirational tips in these DVDs carry over into everything I do and I can't thank Ana & Ravi enough for the jump start they have gifted my life! This one is a great cardio workout for me, and I find myself laughing and having a good time while doing it!  Ana & Ravi, many thanks for all you do!",1235779200,3,1482,4.397810218978102
3680681,5,B001L54TQY,"I have been practicing Kundalini Yoga with Ana and Ravi's practices regularly for a few years, love all of Ana and Ravi's work and find their DVDs amazingly empowering.

This DVD starts with a regular warm-up, brief warm-up, mostly the moves we already know from other practices.
The next segment includes some nice stretches with continuous Breath Of Fire for 6 minutes - felt wonderful. Then we move onto some exercises that reminded me of my Pilates class - roll-overs into Plow, one-legged teasers, then combination of the two. More core exercises follow, as well as some nice stretches.

Then onto the cardio portion - it starts with a slow moving warm-up dance that is supposed to invigorate all systems in the body - it's very pleasant and not hard to follow, Ana and Ravi do a wonderful job with the instruction. The onto the more intense cardio - you can choose either the 10 or the 20 minute option for this one. Ana suggests wearing shoes for this one, but i tried it barefoot, and ti was fine also. It is very pleasant - both dance-like and athletic moves are included, and this segment is very easy to follow. There is a lot of variety - not a single move is done for more than 30 seconds. A nice gentle cool down stretch follows.
The we move onto the Upper Body section - the moves are definitely strengthening, but yoga inspired. There's the dolphin plank combination, and some arm moves that reminded me of arm exercises from Yoga Cleanse.

A very nice Relaxation follows and then comes my absolutely favorite part of the practice - The Ek Ong Chant. The words are the same as in the manta on Ana and Ravi's Am Practice, but sung to a different rhythm that just absolutely makes you smile - very uplifting, I was having a lot of fun with it.

Overall, a wonderful DVD, great production values, great music and as always, wonderful instruction.",1235692800,5,1859,4.573573573573573
3680682,5,B001L54TQY,"I usually do my cardio first and save yoga for the ""wind-down."" I never thought that a DVD would come along that would combine the two to such fantastic effect! I had honestly been starting to feel in a complete rut with my old cardio workouts! I worked up a sweat with this and felt pumped in a really great way! Yoga recommends that yousweat every day and it's my understanding that when you sweat doing yoga, it's rejuvenating for the skin etc. I appreciated the great production values: the set, ambiance, and the slammin' soundtrack. I want to listen to the music all day long. I even wrote to the authors to ask where the music was available. The thing I most love about this Ana & Ravis yoga workouts is that you are not just doing something very good for yourself, you are also having lots of fun - I really like that.",1235606400,2,826,4.335483870967742
3680683,5,B001L54TQY,"In a world where the generic is elevated over the truly innovative, I always go out of my way to draw people's attention to something which is new, exciting, and fueled by inspiration. That describes this truly great DVD. I have to take exception to the reviewer who complains that the music is too loud. Maybe for people whose idea of a good time is watching old Lawrence Welk reruns. As for me, I'm truly tired of yoga DVD's which feature a musical score akin to old school elevator music. I want something that fires my soul, and everthing about this DVD does that. This is a fun, rockin' workout, and everyone whose heart beats like mine, who wants something passionate to work out to,will truly appreciate this master work!",1235606400,4,728,4.607692307692307
3680684,5,B001L54TQY,"One of the things I love about this DVD is the PRE-SET workouts...it has a BEGINNER'S CARDIO PLUS(49:30), YOGA ONLY PRE-SET(42:30)(this one is great if you only want to do the yoga parts of the DVD and not the cardio), KUNDALINI CARDIO PLUS SUPERSET(49:30), AND KUNDALINI YOGA PLUS CARDIO INTERMEDIATE(61:00). It also has the MATRIX menu, if you want to design your own workout.
I felt really good after this workout. It's really nice because it has yoga segments and cardio as well. So, it's like getting two DVD's in one. It felt fantastic and I had more energy afterwards. The warm-up, stretching, core work, and upper body work felt great emotionally and physically and the Cardio segment really makes your heart shine...I felt invigorated and really bright and happy afterwards.(and it gave me a good sweat too!) Great for getting negative energy out! The music is really energizing too and Ana looks absolutely amazing...good inspiration to look at. I believe this DVD will really help people to feel more confident physically and emotionally and have more energy and happiness. After doing this DVD, you cannot feel depressed or stagnant! And for those of you who aren't really into cardio or have a hard time getting started on cardio things, this Cardio segment goes really fast and is set up to not be too much of any one movement at a time. My heart is going to love me for doing this for it! I could practically hear it thanking me. cardio is an area that was lacking in my exercise regimen, but this makes it so easy to get it in, in a short time too! This DVD is going to make it easy for people to work their entire body and mind too.

If you do the DVD start to finish, it runs:
TUNE-IN:(1:50)
WARM-UPS:(5:13)-while sitting cross-legged...spinal grinds, flexing spine with arm movement, twisting motion from torso with arms at right angles, seated with legs straight reaching fingertips to opposite toes.
STRETCHING PLUS CORE(15:32) and CORE PLUS(7:44)-seated forward bend with one leg under you with breath of fire(this is done for several minutes), plough exercise(legs straight on floor then into plough), yoga sit-ups(lying on back, legs straight, rolling up and bending knees at the same time), then combining the plough exercise with the yoga-sit-up, rock on spine, then on hands and knees pumping one leg at a time out straight behind you, then on back raising head while stretching legs open to the side, then lying on back feet stacked on top of one another and you raise your head-first with regular breath then with breath of fire. rock on spine again, then locust pose with breath of fire.
KUNDALINI CARDIO WARM-UP FLOW AND KUNDALINI CARDIO:(15:02)- the warm-up starts with gentle, flowing, and wave-like movements while standing. The cardio dance segment alternates with some gentle cardio and then 30 second moments of intensity. (the movements are different, by the way, from their ""Dance the Chakras"" workout.) There is a Football Drill, where you run in place really fast. A couple different jumping jacks(with modifications, though, so you don't have to jump if you can't or don't want to). There's some dance steps and movements(one where you move in a circle like you're paddling your canoe). It all really gets your heart going, but it's not overwhelming, because the intense moments are only in 30 second intervals and then you do a move that is more low-key.
KUNDALINI CARDIO COOL-DOWN(3:16)- gentle movements and stretching
UPPER BODY TUNE AND TONE(11:39)- in down dog on forearms w/ hands clasped moving forward and back over your hands..then doing this movement with one leg raised. sitting cross-legged raising one arm up and down in front of you, then both arms. Then hold arms in front of you 10 degrees above parallel with long deep breathing. exercise with arms out to side then over head. then arms in prayer pose over head straightening and bending arms.
DEEP RELAXATION:(5:17)- I almost fell asleep during this part..I got so relaxed!
EK ONG KAR CHANT:(5:19)-singing a chant(but it's a different melody than the Ek Ong Kar one on their AM/PM DVD.
CLOSING PRAYER:(2:43)
BREATH PRIMER:(5:30)-does a breath of 4 parts inhale, 4 parts exhale(I think this was called Energy Breath on their other 2 new DVD's), then long deep breathing, then Breath of Fire.
DANCE MOVEMENT BREAKDOWN:(7:51)- this breaks down the movements in the Cardio section, doing them in slow motion with more voice instruction.
EXTENDED DANCE:(21:00)- this is the same as the Cardio segment, but done longer, for when you want to really get your heart up.
DANCE WITH MUSIC ONLY:(10:47)- the Cardio segment with music and Ana dancing, but no voice-over.",1235433600,13,4668,4.938931297709924
3680685,5,B001L54TQY,"So many people have left detailed reviews (beautifully done I might add) that there is not much more for me to say except that I love this dvd.  Ana and Ravi pushed it up a notch to make a dvd that will make you lose weight and smile while doing it.  I did the workout by programming the cardio 3x times. The music is bollywood hip hop.  I used the music only segment and even though sometimes the movement didn't match the music, no worries.  The steps are so simple and the music is so good that I just got my groove on and danced myself into a glistening sweat.  After that I did the plow/ab combination and the stretching section.  Great class.  Great job RaviAna. Oh one more thing, the mantra on this dvd is Ek ong kar sat nam siri wahe guru, which is the Adi Shakti mantra, translated as ""There is one Creator whose name is Truth. Great is the ecstasy of that Supreme Wisdom."" Sat Nam.",1235433600,4,892,4.211764705882353
3680686,5,B001L54TQY,"Cardio, Stretch & Strengthen is another wonderful Ravi & Ana production.  I own all of their dvds and have enjoyed and benefited from each one.  This new program integrates fun cardio/dance/sport moves with yoga.  I loved the combining of the football drill with a samba and jumping jacks in the cardio section.  The moves in the core section are challenging and effective.  I felt my biceps and triceps after performing the dolphin pushups in the upper body toning section.

I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a workout to cover cardio, strength and flexibility. This is an incredible program!",1235347200,5,618,4.951456310679611
3680687,5,B001L54TQY,"I have several of RaviAna's DVDs and also took Ravi's classes when I lived in NYC. I've always enjoyed how much more energized I felt after their DVDs, but didn't see much improvement in terms of fat decrease, or better muscle tone.

I embrace the spiritual aspects of kundalini yoga, with the mantras and breathing exercises that make you work on your mind and magnetic field (aura) as well as your body. But I also often found the relaxation or meditatation moments after each posture in previous DVDs to be too long... sometimes the relaxations would feel longer than the postures themselves.

But this DVD is what I've finally been waiting for - a challenging kundalini workout! They seem to really have put in a lot of work into the new DVDs to improve them. There are lots of new postures I haven't seen in the past DVDs. The pace is faster. The stretching exercises are wonderful. I had some serious training pains in my abs and upper arms after the first time I used this DVD! I'd say this DVD works very well for toning, losing weight, bone strengthening, flexibility and circulation... and it's really fun!

I really like that there's a cardio section as well as a yoga section, and the pre-selected sets are awesome - if you're pressed for work out time, you can choose to do one or the other, or even design your own workout to be as short or long as you like through the matrix option.

Some people have criticized that they didn't get the breathing techniques explained in previous DVDs. No worries, now there's a breath primer.

The production value has been taken up several notches. The music is way better! Don't feel anything is missing here. This new DVD by RaviAna has definitely become my new favorite.",1235347200,9,1724,4.620915032679738
3680688,5,B001L54TQY,"I own all of Ana and Ravi's Dvd's and could not wait for this new title. This one may be my new favorite. It contains many new moves that really work your core, as well as some fun and easy cardio moves that provide enough of a workout to rev-up the metabolism while staying true to the kundalini matrix. This type of yoga really works on an energetic level, clearing and strengthening both body and mind while tuning-up the spirit. This would be fine for any level of kundalini practice. I have to mention Ana's boots because they crack me up. Excellent!",1235347200,3,555,4.450980392156863
3680689,5,B001L54TQY,"Ana & Ravi have outdone themselves with this workout. The scenery is wonderful and Ana is beautiful. This workout is challenging and fun. I love the core workout because I could really feel my abs working hard. The cardio portion is easy to follow but definelty works up a sweat.

I currently have all of their older workouts and love them all, but I think this one just moved up to the top of my favorites. I can't wait to try their other 2 new ones.

This is a must have for a beginner and an advanced yogi.",1235260800,4,509,4.183673469387755
