8531647,5,B008X7IC8Y,"Having studied Nick Ray for years, reading both Susan Ray's memoir I Was Interrupted and the thoroughly researched tome by Bernard Eisenschitz, I was fascinated by the life and art known as Nicholas Ray. His beginnings with legends Alan Lomax studying and discovering American music and moving on into theatre with John Houseman, Ray emerged as a legendary director with the help of Elia Kazan. His work with James Dean and Dennis Hopper created a new school in film acting. He provided Bogart with arguably his greatest performance in In A Lonely Place. The footage presented on this DVD was something I only read about, always wanting to catch a glimpse of his workshops as Ray taught hands-on filmmaking at Harpur College. Being a teacher myself, I relate with the theory of learning by doing as we see Ray collaborating with his students. Amazing stuff. One of my favorite directors of all time. This is a great look into the creative process. Thank you Susan Ray!",1388361600,7,968,4.837349397590361

In fact, for the past three years, I regularly surfed Amazon in the event that ""We Can't Go Home Again"" would become available one day. And as a bonus, this DVD includes other short films made at this time of his career. I've seen nearly all of Nicholas Ray's films, but not these ones. Don't expect ""Rebel Without a Cause"" or ""Johnny Guitar"". The films on these discs are experimental and improvised collaborations conducted by Ray and his students, very talky but honest aand revealing. They are not easy to watch, at least in one sitting, but the conversations are compelling and even mesmerising, reflecting the political and social conditions of the times. These films are the bridge between Ray's main body of work and his collaborations with Wim Wenders. I will be watching these movies again and again as I am sure there is much more to be gained from multiple viewings of these multi-faceted rough diamonds.",1357776000,13,1000,4.72
