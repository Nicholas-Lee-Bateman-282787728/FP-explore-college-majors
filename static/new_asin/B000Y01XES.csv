3010174,5,B000Y01XES,"Murphy Henry does an outstanding job of teaching the banjo to beginners in this DVD.  Her instructions are very clear and easy to follow.  In about two months, I have learned numerous banjo techniques, licks and rolls, and four songs.  Take my word for it, her method really works!  I had never even strummed a banjo before buying one. I purchased this Murphy Henry DVD at the same time.  I could not be  more pleased with her teaching method and with my playing success in such a short period of time.  I would recommend this DVD to any aspiring banjo player.  She makes playing this fun instrument very simple for those of us with no musical background.  If you have ever thought about taking up the banjo, don't wait any longer.  Murphy Henry will have you playing great bluegrass tunes in no time.",1249257600,11,801,4.538461538461538
3010175,5,B000Y01XES,"I have used countless books and tapes to learn banjo with varying degrees of success, but this is the most useful by far of anything I've seen.  The best part is that I'm not tied to using tabs.  It's a great DVD!",1236816000,8,213,4.0476190476190474
3010176,5,B000Y01XES,I  have learned 7 songs in one month using these dvd's. I hate Tab and Murphy doesn't use it.,1220918400,4,93,3.8947368421052633

3010183,5,B000Y01XES,"I was stuck reading tablature and wedded to a music stand until I got this DVD. This is simply, the best method for learning the 5 string banjo. Murphy Henry breaks down the tunes into logical parts and then builds from those parts. By the time you have learned a tune, you have already memorized it. It may be a great temptation, but take Murphy Henry's advice and don't write anything down. Just listen. By the time you are done, you will have trained your ear and fingers to make music!
The first simple tune, ""Banjo Hollow"" will teach you 'licks' that you need for the next tune, ""Cripple Creek"". And learning the licks from that tune will help you progress to the more challenging tunes to follow. Murphy Henry knows how to teach and this DVD is like having her as a personal instructor. Be patient, even if it takes multiple rewinds to get down the lesson and you will be rewarded with being able to play the 5 string banjo.",1409529600,,930,4.412790697674419
3010184,2,B000Y01XES,This is not good lessons for an absolute string instrument beginner.  She assumes you know basics about music chords and how to read music which alot of us do not.,1405468800,,163,4.433333333333334
3010185,5,B000Y01XES,Clearly instruction shows how to start from the beginning.  Slow step by step details on songs makes it fun right from the beginning.,1400457600,,133,4.782608695652174
3010186,5,B000Y01XES,"Pros:
 This method is built on patterns.  You learn roll patters, then a pattern of rolls and licks to create songs.  All the rolls and licks are applied to future songs.  If you have a good ear all this can be generalized to new songs for accompaniment and ""playing by ear.""

You will bypass having to learn to read TAB or music.  (Imagine having to learn to read English before you can speak and use it.)  She walks you through how to do each part of the song.

There are lots of Murphy Method DVDs.  I hope to go through them all.  If I do I will be an rock solid, versatile banjo player.  The DVDs go all the way through very advanced levels.  For the first time I can clearly see a path from A to Z- a way to get me from where I am now to a really good banjo player.  I am very excited about that.

The vamping DVD and Banjos for Misfits focus on accompaniment.  An important and often neglected part of playing banjo.

I would be hard pressed to find a banjo teacher who could give me such a logical course of instruction that builds on itself and carries me forward like Murphy does.  Also, with a DVD I can go back and watch each lesson over and over.  It usually takes at least a half dozen times before I ""get"" it.  I don't have to wait till the next lesson to clarify something I've forgotten.

Cons:
This volume 1 DVD just shows you the first few rolls and chords you need to learn and then tells you to get comfortable with them.  That is it.  For an absolute beginner this could prove a difficult 3-6 months of work before you can begin to learn the songs on the DVD.  You would need to find songs that use the G, D7 and C chords and play them as you sing along until your chord changes are smooth and your rolls are steady.  Another book or teacher would probably be helpful.  If you are already comfortable with your forward, backwards and square rolls and know your 3 basic chords you can dive right in.

The last two songs on this DVD are really cool, but very difficult for a beginner.  On the Murphy Method web site Murphy recommends that you learn the first 2 or 3 songs, then complete Banjo for Misfits DVD, then learn the last 2 songs on this DVD.  I would definitely agree.",1400025600,4,2197,4.154394299287411
3010187,4,B000Y01XES,"I would give this five stars if it was labeled for advanced beginners.  Murphy is an excellent banjo teacher, & I have easily learned everything on this DVD, but I have played finger picking style guitar for 48 years and am probably an advanced beginner or low intermediate on banjo.  This DVD would be a lot for a rank beginner.  But the beauty of learning from a DVD is that you can watch it over & over & pause when you need to.",1398643200,,431,4.168674698795181
3010188,3,B000Y01XES,It is okay.  I hate the way it is recorded in bits and pieces and you have to continually wait to load the next lesson.,1398038400,,119,3.76
3010189,4,B000Y01XES,this is a great way to learn. it is very important to take your time and go slow as she says. it may be hard to understand why but it works,1397952000,,139,3.5161290322580645
3010190,5,B000Y01XES,"I never played banjo before so I didn't know where to start. I heard about the Murphy Method and at first was a little skeptical. I bought a DVD and was hooked. Murphy is a great teacher with an excellent teaching method. I now own most of her DVDs and will no doubt buy more. If you want to learn to play the banjo and are willing to put in the time and effort to do so, this is a great way to go.",1393891200,,398,3.75
3010191,5,B000Y01XES,The murphy method teaches you to play by ear instead of becoming reliant on complicated banjo tabs that may come off as aloof. It also helped me tie together simple banjo rolls with chord progressions. Great for the anyone interested in the banjo at an entry level.,1393804800,,265,4.659574468085107
3010192,5,B000Y01XES,This would have been good when just starting banjo. However it is very helpful after playing 5 years. Keeps you focused and tones your skills. Every banjo player should have this.,1393459200,,179,4.806451612903226
3010193,1,B000Y01XES,My husband was the one to be using this.  GOod book for practical purposes and for someone who will try.,1390348800,,104,4.2
3010194,5,B000Y01XES,"The age old battle in music has always been reading tab's or playing by ear.  The Murphy method is all playing by ear and memorizing.  Having done both I can say that playing by ear is certainly the preferred way for me.  I also have Earl's book and that's a nice back up resource as well since I can read the tabs if I am getting stuck on a certain sound.  Actually I like having both methods for that reason.  Having said that, I've made more progress in the last few weeks using this DVD than I had for two previous years (admittedly not playing much because of frustration) of trying to get watch internet videos.  This DVD helps you tune, but you should really already know how to do it, and then gets your going with the basics and before you know it you are playing your first song.  The value of this DVD will be in direct proportion to your experience with music.  The more you have done in the past the more you will like this DVD.  Having tried the online lessons I find this DVD to be much better.  I like her teaching style as well, very comforting and not intimidating.",1389744000,2,1083,4.239024390243903
3010195,3,B000Y01XES,"I've been playing banjo for about a year and this had a couple songs I haven't learned yet so I thought I would give it a try.  First off, I really liked the idea of training your ear but I didn't feel like it focused on that more than her playing some complicated movements that typically are used a little later.. perhaps starting with some easier song choices and progressing a little less dramatically in the first cd.  I actually have been playing songs like Cripple Creek for a year and don't think I would have learned it as well through her method.  I use Tab, and have learned some songs by ear just naturally hearing songs and listening to bluegrass music.  So I think her method isn't bad, but for someone starting from scratch, good luck!  Maybe start with utube and move up to her cd after about a year, practicing every day or so!",1387756800,,844,4.384615384615385

3010197,5,B000Y01XES,Bought volumn 2 as well and am very pleased with the method of teaching.  Needed to take this next step in my self taught process.,1384473600,,130,4.2
3010198,5,B000Y01XES,"Only been playing banjo for 18 months - hit a plateau and stalled. Then I got the Murphy Method Vol I and II - I am stalled no more! I LOVE this DVD - and the next! I've learned so much from this that people I jam with have noticed a difference in my playing and asked me what I'm doing differently or if I'm taking lessons again. They all say I've improved so much - after going through only Vol I! I got a few more DVD's from Murphy and am picking my way through them. I love the way Murphy teaches - even though I had some background, I like that I am able to play by ear with no tab. She starts with the basics and you can repeat the sections at will. Some of the songs (Foggy Mountain Breakdown in particular) took me a long time to learn (and I hit ""repeat"" on my DVD control over and over and over), but once I learned them, I could play them! Great way to learn to play by ear. If you need tab, then this is not for you. If you want to play by ear and add to your song list of ""no tab"" songs, this is the way to go!  I am sold on the Murphy Method!",1383868800,,1056,3.7567567567567566
3010199,5,B000Y01XES,"As a beginner on banjo I was trying to learn about it on YouTube but everything fell short of what I was hoping for.  With this DVD I could follow along slowly, and was shown the right and left hands, which was awesome!  Murphy Henry is such a cute lady and explained everything in detail!  Lots of songs to learn and everything is broken down into the ""A"" and ""B"" sections, as well as examples of fast and slow paying.  Thank you!!  I can finally show my friends that I can play!",1381363200,,480,4.173913043478261
3010200,5,B000Y01XES,"I started with this CD. Actually I started with a Mel Bay music book and had no luck, boring. If I had of stayed with that I would not be playing the Banjo now. But luckily I ran across the Murphy Method. This has opened up the world of banjo to me. I am new to banjo, 18 months, and I have up graded banjos twice. I have attended 3 banjo camps and I am starting jamming lessons this Tuesday, Pete Wernick method. All of this is due to Murphy getting me started. I will be forever grateful to Murphy and Casey for their teaching.",1381017600,2,529,4.0476190476190474

3010204,5,B000Y01XES,"I'm 56 years old and have been taking banjo lessons from a teacher for about 3 months. I order this DVD a few weeks ago to add a little more to my learning and picked up on Murphy's lessons 1 and 2 very easily. I've started lesson #3 and it's going very well.

I would recommend this DVD to other banjo players.",1372377600,,311,4.016129032258065
3010205,5,B000Y01XES,"Learning to play the banjo is painless with Murphy and her ""playing by ear"" system.  Love vol 1 and vol 2!",1369440000,,106,4.0476190476190474
3010206,5,B000Y01XES,"There are a ton of books and DVD's offering instruction in playing various instruments, usually implying some secret method to have you playing like Mozart in 10 days, or some such thing. As a professional musician, I know these claims to be nonsense. It would like becoming a great artist or professional athlete in a weekend. It just does not happen.
With that being said, I found Murphy Henry's unique style of teaching to be easy to follow, not the least bit boring, and suitable even for someone unable to read music and a musical novice, though a modicum of musical background would be a definite help. I have been a keyboardist, drummer and guitar player for years, but because of where I grew up, I had always wanted to learn the banjo. It is not an easy instrument to learn to play skillfully, yet Murphy had me understanding the basics and playing ( though rather poorly) my first day. She makes it clear you need to devote a good hour a day, start slowly and encourages a manner that allows you to practically pick up the tunes by ear. Basic easily mastered 3 finger runs ( forward, backward, square, etc.) that repeat regularly in most Bluegrass tunes are taught such that you will quickly come to recognize banjo runs that are repeated in most tunes, facilitating learning new tunes as your skill increases.

Ultimately, nothing matches having a personal instructor, but I have been so satisfied with Murphy's style of teaching that I have purchased two more of her DVD's. I love playing the banjo, and no book has come close to making the banjo as understandable as her instruction. One disc is less than one private lesson from a local teacher so for the individual eager to start learning on their, I wholeheartedly recommend this DVD.

Play on, and enjoy!",1364083200,3,1772,4.676282051282051
3010207,5,B000Y01XES,"I made the mistake of trying to learn mostly from books/tab early on.  I have been playing for about 8 months now and the Murphy Method has helped me more in a shorter amount of time than anything else.  Great instruction, great tunes!",1360713600,2,235,4.441860465116279
3010208,5,B000Y01XES,"One of my major issues with playing is trying to play from memory.  A lot of times if I don't have tab in front of me I can't do much.  Mrs. Henry does not have tabs, nor does she want you to write anything down.  I have been able to pick up licks and post them to memory which has been great for me.  I have gotten through 3 of the 5 songs on this DVD.  She plays it fast, then slow, then breaks down the song into part A and part B.  She then breaks down each part into the various licks.  She plays the lick, and then tells you finger by finger how to play the lick, put the licks together to make the parts, and the parts together to make the song.

The selection of songs is great.  She starts off wih Banjo in the Hollow (or she says Holler).  Cripple Creek, Cumberland Gap, Foggy Mountain Breakdown and John Hardy.  Foggy Mountain Breakdown is the first part of of the lower fret board.  The higher part is shown in Volume 2.

This seems to me to be a beginner DVD.  I have been playing off an on over the years.  But as I say the way she ""makes"" you memorize the material, is great, and is propelling me in my playing.",1360627200,3,1126,3.9642857142857144
3010209,5,B000Y01XES,I've been playing banjo for 2 years and this is the best way to learn new songs.  Murphy takes you note by note to lean the songs.,1360368000,2,130,3.814814814814815
3010210,5,B000Y01XES,"I started out my banjo quest by going on You Tube and just getting some ideas. However, I am much better picking out 1 plan and moving forward with it. Judging from what I heard about the Murphy Method I figured this was the best way to go.

If you have played guitar this dvd is absolutely perfect and very achievable.

I worked on the first song while learning hand position, etc and pretty much had it down within a week or so with about 20-30 mins practice a day average. Some days none, some days a lot more. Man I had some fun though.

If you have never played guitar or any other stringed instrument this dvd will challenge you right off the bat. If you go nice and slow I think you will be just fine. I hate learning instruments with sheet music or tab because they slow down the learning process so much. You don't have to worry about that here.

I highly recommend this product.

3010211,5,B000Y01XES,"I have played music on and off since I was about 13 but went for many years without playing. Recently I got interested in it again and learned to play some mandolin, and begin playing almost every weekend at local jam sessions. I had never seriously considered the banjo although having played bluegrass with some friends many years ago, I had been exposed to it.  It just seemed like it would be too difficult to learn and sounded so complex!  I recently got interested in it though, borrowed an old Kay banjo from a friend and ordered this banjo dvd.  I have no doubt that anyone with a tiny bit of musical talent can learn to play the banjo with this method.

If you have tried method books and tab with little success, you owe it to yourself to give Murphy Henry a try. We are all different in the way we learn...some people can print out a tab from the internet, sit down with it and play, but I never could.  Murphy's method uses absolutely no printed tab. (Sometimes I think a printed tab of a few things would be helpful).  She shows you note by note how to play real songs on the banjo.  Although Murphy doesn't lessons specifically teaching you the different rolls as a lot of beginning banjo material does, you learn them by actually using them in the context of a song rather than a rather boring drill or exercise.

There are a lot of similar approaches on the internet, but I have not found anyone that breaks it down into small digestible bits the way Murphy does. She also will include both fast and slow versions of the songs so you can hear what it should sound like up to normal tempo once you have it down and start working toward a faster speed. In Murphy's words though ""speed is not important while learning to play the banjo"". By this she means, learn to play accurately with correct timing and emphasis and the speed will come with experience.

While teaching you note by note, Murphy also brings your attention to different ""standard"" licks and series of notes that are re-used many times in other songs and encourages you to develop your ear skills as well.  In fact she has a couple of courses specifically aimed at developing your improvisational skills. It is valuable that if at all possible you learn how to improvise and play without having to depend on note by note tab or demonstration, especially if you intend on jamming with others.

I have been playing for a little over a year now.  I have the following Murphy Method lessons:  Beginning Banjo Vol. 1 & 2, Banjo for Misfits, Beginning Improvising, Ralph Stanley Banjo, Easy Songs for Banjo, and just bought Jam Session Favorites.  I can play 25 or 30 songs fairly well, and this includes a few that I was able to play by ear without learning them from the dvd's.

If you are just thinking about learning this wonderful instrument, or if you have tried and become discouraged with other methods you really should give this a try.

I started with that borrowed banjo (which I recently purchased and am working on restoring), and now have four banjos and love playing them all!

Her method is unique, other videos teach a song, but Murphy teaches you a song and teaches you the banjo. If you learn from here you will not only be able to play the songs, you will be able to IMPROVISE. No other material teaches that like her. What else can i say?  I'll never forget all those nights. Late,after 11,  a glass of wine, the wife and kids asleep. The house is quiet.

I purchased this Murphy Henry DVD at the same time.  I could not be  more pleased with her teaching method and with my playing success in such a short period of time.

3244680,5,B000Y01XES,"I was stuck reading tablature and wedded to a music stand until I got this DVD. This is simply, the best method for learning the 5 string banjo. Murphy Henry breaks down the tunes into logical parts and then builds from those parts. By the time you have learned a tune, you have already memorized it. It may be a great temptation, but take Murphy Henry's advice and don't write anything down. Just listen. By the time you are done, you will have trained your ear and fingers to make music!
The first simple tune, ""Banjo Hollow"" will teach you 'licks' that you need for the next tune, ""Cripple Creek"". And learning the licks from that tune will help you progress to the more challenging tunes to follow. Murphy Henry knows how to teach and this DVD is like having her as a personal instructor. Be patient, even if it takes multiple rewinds to get down the lesson and you will be rewarded with being able to play the 5 string banjo.",1409529600,,930,4.412790697674419
3244681,2,B000Y01XES,This is not good lessons for an absolute string instrument beginner.  She assumes you know basics about music chords and how to read music which alot of us do not.,1405468800,,163,4.433333333333334
3244682,5,B000Y01XES,Clearly instruction shows how to start from the beginning.  Slow step by step details on songs makes it fun right from the beginning.,1400457600,,133,4.782608695652174
3244683,5,B000Y01XES,"Pros:
 This method is built on patterns.  You learn roll patters, then a pattern of rolls and licks to create songs.  All the rolls and licks are applied to future songs.  If you have a good ear all this can be generalized to new songs for accompaniment and ""playing by ear.""

You will bypass having to learn to read TAB or music.  (Imagine having to learn to read English before you can speak and use it.)  She walks you through how to do each part of the song.

There are lots of Murphy Method DVDs.  I hope to go through them all.  If I do I will be an rock solid, versatile banjo player.  The DVDs go all the way through very advanced levels.  For the first time I can clearly see a path from A to Z- a way to get me from where I am now to a really good banjo player.  I am very excited about that.

The vamping DVD and Banjos for Misfits focus on accompaniment.  An important and often neglected part of playing banjo.

I would be hard pressed to find a banjo teacher who could give me such a logical course of instruction that builds on itself and carries me forward like Murphy does.  Also, with a DVD I can go back and watch each lesson over and over.  It usually takes at least a half dozen times before I ""get"" it.  I don't have to wait till the next lesson to clarify something I've forgotten.

Cons:
This volume 1 DVD just shows you the first few rolls and chords you need to learn and then tells you to get comfortable with them.  That is it.  For an absolute beginner this could prove a difficult 3-6 months of work before you can begin to learn the songs on the DVD.  You would need to find songs that use the G, D7 and C chords and play them as you sing along until your chord changes are smooth and your rolls are steady.  Another book or teacher would probably be helpful.  If you are already comfortable with your forward, backwards and square rolls and know your 3 basic chords you can dive right in.

The last two songs on this DVD are really cool, but very difficult for a beginner.  On the Murphy Method web site Murphy recommends that you learn the first 2 or 3 songs, then complete Banjo for Misfits DVD, then learn the last 2 songs on this DVD.  I would definitely agree.",1400025600,4,2197,4.154394299287411

Murphy is an excellent banjo teacher, & I have easily learned everything on this DVD, but I have played finger picking style guitar for 48 years and am probably an advanced beginner or low intermediate on banjo.

3244691,5,B000Y01XES,"The age old battle in music has always been reading tab's or playing by ear.  The Murphy method is all playing by ear and memorizing.  Having done both I can say that playing by ear is certainly the preferred way for me.  I also have Earl's book and that's a nice back up resource as well since I can read the tabs if I am getting stuck on a certain sound.  Actually I like having both methods for that reason.  Having said that, I've made more progress in the last few weeks using this DVD than I had for two previous years (admittedly not playing much because of frustration) of trying to get watch internet videos.  This DVD helps you tune, but you should really already know how to do it, and then gets your going with the basics and before you know it you are playing your first song.  The value of this DVD will be in direct proportion to your experience with music.  The more you have done in the past the more you will like this DVD.  Having tried the online lessons I find this DVD to be much better.  I like her teaching style as well, very comforting and not intimidating.",1389744000,2,1083,4.239024390243903

First off, I really liked the idea of training your ear but I didn't feel like it focused on that more than her playing some complicated movements that typically are used a little later.. perhaps starting with some easier song choices and progressing a little less dramatically in the first cd.  I actually have been playing songs like Cripple Creek for a year and don't think I would have learned it as well through her method.  I use Tab, and have learned some songs by ear just naturally hearing songs and listening to bluegrass music.  So I think her method isn't bad, but for someone starting from scratch, good luck!

They all say I've improved so much - after going through only Vol I! I got a few more DVD's from Murphy and am picking my way through them. I love the way Murphy teaches - even though I had some background, I like that I am able to play by ear with no tab. She starts with the basics and you can repeat the sections at will. Some of the songs (Foggy Mountain Breakdown in particular) took me a long time to learn (and I hit ""repeat"" on my DVD control over and over and over), but once I learned them, I could play them!

3244703,5,B000Y01XES,"There are a ton of books and DVD's offering instruction in playing various instruments, usually implying some secret method to have you playing like Mozart in 10 days, or some such thing. As a professional musician, I know these claims to be nonsense. It would like becoming a great artist or professional athlete in a weekend. It just does not happen.
With that being said, I found Murphy Henry's unique style of teaching to be easy to follow, not the least bit boring, and suitable even for someone unable to read music and a musical novice, though a modicum of musical background would be a definite help. I have been a keyboardist, drummer and guitar player for years, but because of where I grew up, I had always wanted to learn the banjo. It is not an easy instrument to learn to play skillfully, yet Murphy had me understanding the basics and playing ( though rather poorly) my first day. She makes it clear you need to devote a good hour a day, start slowly and encourages a manner that allows you to practically pick up the tunes by ear. Basic easily mastered 3 finger runs ( forward, backward, square, etc.) that repeat regularly in most Bluegrass tunes are taught such that you will quickly come to recognize banjo runs that are repeated in most tunes, facilitating learning new tunes as your skill increases.

Ultimately, nothing matches having a personal instructor, but I have been so satisfied with Murphy's style of teaching that I have purchased two more of her DVD's. I love playing the banjo, and no book has come close to making the banjo as understandable as her instruction. One disc is less than one private lesson from a local teacher so for the individual eager to start learning on their, I wholeheartedly recommend this DVD.

Play on, and enjoy!",1364083200,3,1772,4.676282051282051

3244705,5,B000Y01XES,"One of my major issues with playing is trying to play from memory.  A lot of times if I don't have tab in front of me I can't do much.  Mrs. Henry does not have tabs, nor does she want you to write anything down.  I have been able to pick up licks and post them to memory which has been great for me.  I have gotten through 3 of the 5 songs on this DVD.  She plays it fast, then slow, then breaks down the song into part A and part B.  She then breaks down each part into the various licks.  She plays the lick, and then tells you finger by finger how to play the lick, put the licks together to make the parts, and the parts together to make the song.

The selection of songs is great.  She starts off wih Banjo in the Hollow (or she says Holler).  Cripple Creek, Cumberland Gap, Foggy Mountain Breakdown and John Hardy.  Foggy Mountain Breakdown is the first part of of the lower fret board.  The higher part is shown in Volume 2.

This seems to me to be a beginner DVD.  I have been playing off an on over the years.  But as I say the way she ""makes"" you memorize the material, is great, and is propelling me in my playing.",1360627200,3,1126,3.9642857142857144

3244707,5,B000Y01XES,"I started out my banjo quest by going on You Tube and just getting some ideas. However, I am much better picking out 1 plan and moving forward with it. Judging from what I heard about the Murphy Method I figured this was the best way to go.

If you have played guitar this dvd is absolutely perfect and very achievable.

I worked on the first song while learning hand position, etc and pretty much had it down within a week or so with about 20-30 mins practice a day average. Some days none, some days a lot more. Man I had some fun though.

If you have never played guitar or any other stringed instrument this dvd will challenge you right off the bat. If you go nice and slow I think you will be just fine. I hate learning instruments with sheet music or tab because they slow down the learning process so much. You don't have to worry about that here.

I highly recommend this product.

3244708,5,B000Y01XES,"I have played music on and off since I was about 13 but went for many years without playing. Recently I got interested in it again and learned to play some mandolin, and begin playing almost every weekend at local jam sessions. I had never seriously considered the banjo although having played bluegrass with some friends many years ago, I had been exposed to it.  It just seemed like it would be too difficult to learn and sounded so complex!  I recently got interested in it though, borrowed an old Kay banjo from a friend and ordered this banjo dvd.  I have no doubt that anyone with a tiny bit of musical talent can learn to play the banjo with this method.

If you have tried method books and tab with little success, you owe it to yourself to give Murphy Henry a try. We are all different in the way we learn...some people can print out a tab from the internet, sit down with it and play, but I never could.  Murphy's method uses absolutely no printed tab. (Sometimes I think a printed tab of a few things would be helpful).  She shows you note by note how to play real songs on the banjo.  Although Murphy doesn't lessons specifically teaching you the different rolls as a lot of beginning banjo material does, you learn them by actually using them in the context of a song rather than a rather boring drill or exercise.

There are a lot of similar approaches on the internet, but I have not found anyone that breaks it down into small digestible bits the way Murphy does. She also will include both fast and slow versions of the songs so you can hear what it should sound like up to normal tempo once you have it down and start working toward a faster speed. In Murphy's words though ""speed is not important while learning to play the banjo"". By this she means, learn to play accurately with correct timing and emphasis and the speed will come with experience.

While teaching you note by note, Murphy also brings your attention to different ""standard"" licks and series of notes that are re-used many times in other songs and encourages you to develop your ear skills as well.  In fact she has a couple of courses specifically aimed at developing your improvisational skills. It is valuable that if at all possible you learn how to improvise and play without having to depend on note by note tab or demonstration, especially if you intend on jamming with others.

I have been playing for a little over a year now.  I have the following Murphy Method lessons:  Beginning Banjo Vol. 1 & 2, Banjo for Misfits, Beginning Improvising, Ralph Stanley Banjo, Easy Songs for Banjo, and just bought Jam Session Favorites.  I can play 25 or 30 songs fairly well, and this includes a few that I was able to play by ear without learning them from the dvd's.

If you are just thinking about learning this wonderful instrument, or if you have tried and become discouraged with other methods you really should give this a try.

I started with that borrowed banjo (which I recently purchased and am working on restoring), and now have four banjos and love playing them all!

Hope everyone out there has as much fun as I am having!",1299024000,17,356,4.430769230769231
3244720,5,B000Y01XES,I have tried 3 other DVDs using tab and would get to a point and be stuck. This DVD has made it soooo much easier for me to learn the Banjo. It is just what I needed to get me going again.,1288828800,12,188,3.5
3244721,5,B000Y01XES,"This is a wonderful start for the beginner interested in the Scruggs 3 finger (Dueling Banjos, Foggy Mountain Breakdown) style of playing. You learn from Murphy as folk learned from their elders for 3000 years...watch, and listen.  The lack of tabs has the great advantage of training your ears as well as your fingers. I learned guitar from tabs and sheet music,  and this is a much, much better approach by my lights.  Do you want to learn to read banjo tabs, or do you want to learn to be able to hear something and play it?  And she has a delightful (to my NY ears) accent to boot.",1282608000,23,585,4.339449541284404
3244722,5,B000Y01XES,I'll keep it short and sweet. I'd never played a banjo in my life. I was able to learn all the songs in just a few weeks from this DVD. Plan on buying more MM dvds. I'm into it.,1269561600,11,177,3.5641025641025643
3244723,5,B000Y01XES,"I own (no kidding) 20 banjo instructional dvd's. This one is the best. Can I say any more? I tell it like it is. If you see my other reviews, you will see I don't give 5 stars often.  It is for beginners or early intermediates. It's the best one out there, trust me, period. Her method is unique, other videos teach a song, but Murphy teaches you a song and teaches you the banjo. If you learn from here you will not only be able to play the songs, you will be able to IMPROVISE. No other material teaches that like her. What else can i say?  I'll never forget all those nights. Late,after 11,  a glass of wine, the wife and kids asleep. The house is quiet. There I was sitting in front of the tv screen listening to Murphy ""okay every body , now it's time to Tuuuuuuuuuuuuune the banjo."" oh the memories bring a warm spot to my heart.",1258243200,37,835,4.110429447852761
8230376,5,B000Y01XES,Super. Great selection of songs for a beginner like me. Murphy is very good at showing fingering at very slow speed so you can see what she is doing. Then plays songs at varying speeds to hear  what they sound like. Very encouraging. Been playing only a month and already have a few songs I can play. I see why this video had high reviews.,1508976000,,339,4.2153846153846155
8230377,5,B000Y01XES,"Great download! I had been working on tabs and was getting some results after many hours of practice. After 2 days working with the DVD I'm actually playing songs that sound great. The by ear Method is (at least for me) the best way to learn. She breaks it down note by note and as you move on to other songs you are able to use what licks and chords you have already learned and apply it to them. It makes learning new songs easier. The way she explains everything is great. I highly recommended this DVD , I'm now on the second one and getting better everyday. You have to put in the time though and practice!",1496188800,,611,4.186440677966102

8230379,5,B000Y01XES,Murphy does an excellent job of explaining how different licks apply to songs.  She breaks the songs down into phrases that are easy to master. You'll be playing before you know it.,1457222400,,181,4.65625
8230380,5,B000Y01XES,"Murphy teaches a lot of stringed instruments, and all of her DVD's are a lot of fun. I have been playing guitar for quite a while but I still enjoyed playing along with her guitar DVD. I put this one on my computer in the basement and ten minutes later I was picking my new banjo. Great fun!",1438128000,,291,4.0344827586206895

8230384,2,B000Y01XES,Very old low quality DVD you'd think they could have redone it a little. Looked old and fuzzy which is a shame because she's a good teacher. But this DVD is so outdated it's hard to watch.,1424908800,,188,4.108108108108108
