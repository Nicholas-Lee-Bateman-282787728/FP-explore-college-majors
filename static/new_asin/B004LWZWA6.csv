4406128,5,B004LWZWA6,"My 9-year-old daughter and I went to see this at the drive-in.  (Yes - we still have one near us!)  It was the ""other"" film playing with Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked, which was the main film we went to see.  We didn't know if we would last through We Bought a Zoo when we arrived, but boy are we glad we did.  We felt great compassion with the characters, enjoyed all of the little moments and fun inter-relational scenes, and came away with a smile.

Truthfully, I expected it to be cheesy and sickly sweet and although it did have some of those moments, it was more filled with cute interactions between the widowed dad and his kids, the members of the zoo staff and the new zoo owners, and the fun supporting characters.

A few characters were a bit 2-dimensional (such as the zoo inspector), but even they made for fun-filled moments (e.g., the ""rivalry"" between MacCready - one of the zookeepers - and the inspector was hilarious).

The most important part of this film for me is that it has led to hours of discussions today, with my daughter recounting her favorite moments, asking questions, discussing the themes, etc.

Make a point to see this wonderful film!",1325894400,3,1177,4.571428571428571
4406129,1,B004LWZWA6,"We Bought a Zoo has a predictable storyline.  It's sappy, sentimental, and deals somewhat sensibly with the difficult topic of death/dying.  If only these were the worst things I could say about this film.  We bought a zoo is closer to an adult/romance than a film suitable for the entire family, and it's filled with rampant product pitches and cultural and political references that perfectly define today's liberal Hollywood.

The movie is billed as a 'family' movie in theaters.  Here's your warning now:  This movie isn't suitable for children.  You'll hear every profanity but the F word and you'll see the story's youngest character call the Zoo inspector a 'd---.'  As if that wasn't enough, you'll also enjoy a teen romance where the girl in question is all of 12.  Is it too much for Hollywood and Cameron Crowe to allow young girls to mature to 13 before they are the subjects of Hollywood love plots?

If you've got time to kill and the topic of rebounding from the death of a loved one is of interest to you as a pretext for romance, this movie might catch your eye.  But if your expectation is family entertainment, this film is to be avoided.",1325894400,30,1157,4.650246305418719
4406130,3,B004LWZWA6,"MOVIE NOTE #20 WE BAUGHT A ZOO

Here is a relatively small film with a big star. Cameron Crowe (`Vanilla Sky', `Jerry Mcguire', `Almost Famous') came out of his six year directorial hiatus and picked a subject matter of more `family' orientation then popular trends which is his usual film genre.

Matt Damon (`Good Will Hunting', `Borne Identity') and Scarlett Johansson (`Prestige', `Iron Man 2') do a nice job portraying two very different people with very different backgrounds who are put together with a common goal. Bring a worn down - financially in trouble - local zoo back too life.

Damon, the father of two kids - after losing his wife, their mother - decides to leave his life as an author and literally on a whim by a new home that happened to also be part of a real zoo.  Even against his brothers better advice played by Thomas Hayden Church (`Sideways', `Spider-Man 3', `Wings'),
The movie itself is formulaic in nature but has some great scenes with the kids played by Colin Ford (`Push') and Maggie Elizabeth Jones (`Footloose'). While his daughter loves the idea of the move, while the son, who is always in trouble, wants nothing to change.

Dealing with the eccentric Zoo staff,  the financial issues and the inspector who approves their new grand opening played very broadly by John Michael Higgens (`Yes Man', `Bad Teacher') who threatens to not pass their inspection - the family has the energy and time to persevere and make it all work.
A few heart tugs and definitely scene stealing animal performances, this movie is good family fun. Not the best, but certainly not the worst.",1325548800,,1605,4.776173285198556
4406131,5,B004LWZWA6,"""We Bought a Zoo"" is a comedy-drama film with a narrative that focuses on coping with bereavement, and taking a positive new direction, which is based on a true story.

Benjamin Mee (Matt Damon) loses his wife Katherine to a terminal illness becoming a widower with two children; a creative teenage boy Dylan and an adorable young daughter named Rosie.

It is the journey the Mees' take to recover from their loss that forms most of the story, and the move from an urban neighbourhood to a rural property, with an attached zoo named Rosemoor Animal Park, that becomes their new direction.

At first this is challenging for Benjamin and his son Dylan, and the zoo staff faces a heavy task to bring the facility up to standard for visitors. Yet each character has their own mountain to climb, and the zoo provides them all with a collective goal that is therapeutic for their own recuperation.

This is a film that allows the viewer to appreciate all that life presents, and healing from major grief can be achieved with a task that stimulates the body and the heart and mind.

4406132,5,B004LWZWA6,"this is a great movie, one of the best roles i've seen matt damon in. this movie is funny and heartwarming. this is a great movie. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do",1325116800,18,186,3.9210526315789473
4406133,3,B004LWZWA6,"If you sat down to write a story about a man who bought a zoo after his wife died and left him with two children to bring up and you decided to put in every predictable storyline that you could think of, then you'd come up with this movie. Absolutely nothing happens which would make the viewer say ""That's a surprise.""

Still, the acting is capable, the score is good, the scenery is attractive and there are lots of shots of animals looking sweet or occasionally scary. It's a nice little three-star movie that hits every button you expect, although unfortunately none that you don't. Watch it when you're not in the mood for anything which might come as a shock.",1324944000,3,665,4.4958677685950414
4406134,4,B004LWZWA6,"Really, when are folks the most maudlin if not during the holiday season? When they're most likely to forgive one's abundance of sentimentality? WE BOUGHT A ZOO utilizes savvy product placement by coinciding its box office release with the month of December. Not that it mattered to me one bit when this film would've come out. Me, I'm a sucker for the sentimental stuff. The movie's title doesn't lie; you get the gist of the premise. Here's Cameron Crowe again, manipulating your emotions, coaxing a laugh, making you tear up. He's such a user.

It's based on a true story. Matt Damon, one of my favorite actors, plays journalist Benjamin Mee who nurses an adventurous streak. He has interviewed dangerous underworld figures in third world nations. He has flown into Category 4 storms. Benjamin profoundly believes that 20 seconds of insane courage can only alter your life for the better. But how much insane courage can one muster when the love of your life leaves you?

Benjamin Mee can't stand pity, even pity assignments at work. Six months after his wife's passing, Benjamin quits his career and - when a neighbor's party causes his seven-year-old girl Rosie (Maggie Elizabeth Jones) to remark: ""Their happy's too loud."" - he uproots the fam. Seeking a new residence, he and Rosie stumble upon what looks to be the ideal home in the country, even if it's nine miles from a Target store or pretty much from any other store. Except that a broken-down zoo is attached to the house. Buy one, buy the other. Benjamin Mee has always strived to give his kids an ""authentic American experience,"" but his bump of common sense is interfering here. Ultimately, it's little Rosie's unbounded joy at the thought of having a zoo that decides things. Benjamin's cautious accountant brother (Thomas Haden Church) is pretty much aghast.

WE BOUGHT A ZOO isn't as incisive or emotionally searing as THE DESCENDANTS, a similar picture dealing with a family's grief. WE BOUGHT A ZOO, to be frank, won't be nominated for as many awards as THE DESCENDANTS will. Except that I like this movie better. Sue me for prefering clear-cut happy endings. While Clooney's dramedy tends to cut too close to home and no one in WE BOUGHT A ZOO comes close to Shailene Woodley's fierce performance, Matt Damon and the rest of the cast guide you to more familiar territory. Their story has a warmth and an undeniable sweetness to it, brought about in huge part by the actors but also by Crowe's knack for heartstring tugging. And, of course, the zoo animals.

Benjamin Mee has his work cut out for him. The Rosemoor Wildlife Park has been dead in the water for the past two years, and just how strongly does he want to commit to operating a zoo, let alone resurrecting it to specs? The dreaded inspection is fast approaching. His idiosyncratic new employees - including the gorgeous zookeeper Kelly (Scarlett Johansson) - are casting dubious eyes at him. Benjamin's troubled teen son, Dylan, hates the place, hates everything, really. He keeps on drawing those disturbing images. Benjamin and Dylan just can't seem to connect.

I admit that I choked up in places (damn you, Cameron Crowe!). Yes, this is a sappy film, and some bits feel contrived, but the cast, I feel, ultimately rises above it all. Matt Damon is a sturdy lead and he grounds the story, and I do like that spark between him and Scarlett Johannson. Elle Fanning, who is growing up fast, has a glow about her, sweetly playing the zookeeper's younger sister, Lily, who approaches the tormented artist Dylan with open acceptance. And while there's a chance that Crowe may have overplayed his hand by making Rosie's input so invaluable in a key sequence - it's pretty hard to believe that a seven-year-old could be so canny - there's no arguing that Maggie Elizabeth Jones is just about the cutest thing on earth (sorry, tap-dancing penguins). So, I dunno, sir. WE BOUGHT A ZOO may not come across as emotionally blunt or ""truthful"" as THE DESCENDANTS. But this is Christmastime wherein edges are softened. There's no place here for blunt truths.",1324771200,126,4080,4.814550641940086

4406206,5,B004LWZWA6,"A truly satisfying, simple movie about a family, devastated by the loss of their wife/mother and looking for a fresh start, stumble upon... a new home complete with a small, private zoo. The story is very portrayed by Matt Damon and Scarlett Johansson with a great supporting cast. Johansson underplays her role as head zoo keeper, staying just a bit in the background and in the process becomes one of the most intriguing characters. Damon is terrific as a thrill seeking reporter who is completely adrift in trying to manage and lead his family while desperately missing his wife. A feel good film based upon a true story. Not a single rough edge here. Just a warm tale for the whole family. Good comfort food for a stormy afternoon.",1522800000,,735,4.705426356589148

In the morning, we went to a really fun interactive zoo where we could feed the animals and then we topped off the day watching this together.

4407036,5,B004LWZWA6,"This is a great family movie, for families with kids 12ish and older.  The message is great, follow your heart.  On occasion there is questionable language, and the father son relationship is strained, but for older children who can understand the emotions behind it the movie is fine.

The movie revolves around a father and his son and daughter.  It takes place not long after his wife and their mother has passed away and they are trying to find their new normal.  The son has a hard time doing that and after being expelled from school they are looking for a new start.  They end up buying a zoo, hence the title, and going through the struggles of getting the zoo back into working order and being certified to open.  The movie is about relationships more than anything.  Father and son relationship, husband and wife, living and the dead, and man/boy and woman/girl.  In the end it is all a love story that teaches us to follow our hearts.

I quite enjoy the movie.",1471219200,2,971,4.528735632183908

4407423,4,B004LWZWA6,"If you are looking for cinematic art, you'll be disappointed -- this movie is entirely predictable, the script is pretty unimaginative, and even the potential for spectacular visuals that the zoo offers could be fulfilled much better. I was surprised by the caliber of the cast; there is really nothing much to do for Matt Damon, Scarlett Johansson, or John Michael Higgins (another nearly unused comedic potential). And yet I came upon this film on TV and never felt the urge to turn it off. It flows well and provides that sense of comfort that we crave in certain moods. This is the type of feel-good family drama that you watch empathizing without heartbreak and knowing for sure that all will be okay. It feels absolutely safe, like a bowl of mashed potatoes. Good to watch with kids, good to watch when stress has got you down. The movie is unpretentious about what it is -- just look at the title -- and so it possesses the best qualities of simple entertainment: honesty and kindness.",1464307200,,992,4.674285714285714

My girls (7 & 6) loved it, although we had to fast forward a few scenes with some rather dark/morbid images that the son drew. We had to explain to them that sometimes people go through a really hard time when someone they love very much dies. Other than that, they loved it. When a movie can make you laugh and cry I'd say it's a success. Mark Wahlberg is perfect! I've recommended this to many people and can't wait to watch it again.",1458172800,,508,4.09

I'm very glad I did decide to play on that version.  There would have been plenty of swearing with out it..I could tell by the dubbing...way more than I feel comfortable with small children watching. The WORST part however, did it REALLY need a line about the little girl still believing in the Easter Bunny?  I had a 7 yr old, the same age as the character, watching the movie.  It broke my heart a bit as we watched it Christmas night together.  It was a totally useless line, and should have been scrapped, especially in the ""Family Friendly"" playback version.  For that pit of sadness in my stomach, I downgrade from 4 to 2 stars.  Come on Matt Damon, don't you have 4 kids?  Also, this is another ""kill off the mother before the movie begins"" story so ridiculous things can happen, but we watch Disney movies so we are used to that.",1451001600,2,1021,4.365079365079365

Wonderful family viewing movie! Bought it for myself and a copy for the neighbors for Christmas!",1431820800,,212,4.552631578947368
4408908,4,B004LWZWA6,"I rarely buy DVDs any longer because it is so easy to watch most movies on Amazon or Netflix without buying them. But occasionally I see one, like We Bought a Zoo, that I like so much I want to add it to our collection. I did purchase We Bought a Zoo on DVD.

Based on a true story this was a good family movie, although the younger ones wouldn't be able to follow the subtle meaning behind some of the dialog which was very important to the overall story. Our smart five year old wouldn't get it. I'd think 8 to 10 years old and up might be a better age. The story has a grief theme as the mother of the children has passed away before the story begins. That thread runs through the movie and is the foundation for the entire story.

I have several movies with Matt Damon but I feel this is his best role.

This is a heartwarming family movie with light touches on the problems that arise during the story. The story is totally believable, and it's packed with a great cast. I always like Thomas Hayden Church who had a smaller role in We Bought a Zoo.

Movie making is all about the director. A director can totally screw up a good story and acting, or can bring a poor story to life. Cameron Crowe did a bang up job on this one. I think he may have squeezed a bit more out of a decent story than most directors could have.

This isn't an animal-centric movie so don't expect that. It's much more about the people and their struggle to make the zoo work. It's fairly predictable but for me that's okay for a family film. There are lots of light touches for a good chuckle.

Why not 5 stars? I reserve that rating for nothing but the best movies. While this is a great family film it simply isn't a match for some of my true favorites (Shawshank Redemption, Casablanca, that sort of thing).",1431734400,6,1791,4.191860465116279

4409337,4,B004LWZWA6,"We Bought a Zoo
 This PG- rated family film is about as good as it gets in its niche.  We are treated to two hours and four minutes of solid, family friendly, drama.  Briefly, a recent widower and his two children buy a derelict zoo.  It is a kind of therapy for the father, an adventure for the young daughter and a wrenching nightmare for the troubled early teenage son.  It has heartwarming interaction between the dad and the troubled son.  There is heartwarming teeny bopper romance between the teen and the zoo keepers ward.  We are given heartwarming grown up romance with the zookeeper and the dad. We even have heartwarming, very tasteful and sad, end of life issues with an aged tiger.  You have the idea by now.  Bring a hanky if you are like I am and the heartwarming stuff gets to you.  I liked it a lot and became moist at least twice.  I saw We Bought a Zoo alone to save any personal embarrassment.  My tough guy image would not survive being caught crying in a darkened theater.
 Writer/Director Cameron Crow (who wrote the iconic Fast Times at Ridgemont High, wrote directed and produced both Jerry Maguire and Vanilla Sky) might have let all this heartwarming business pass over into pure smaltz, but stops just short.  Crow, a man for all seasons, even had a hand in the sound track.  And it is a terrific track too.  Besides the original work, with lyrics by Crow, we have cuts by Bob Dylan (the teen boy is named Dylan, but named after a dog, not the artist) Cat Stevens, Neal Young and Jonsi, among others.
 A very strong performance by Matt Damon is the center for the film.  He is a father and bereaved husband.  He is also a good man who stands by his values as he wends his way through a bad situation.  Damon brings a sober humanity to the character.  Apparently, he can play anything.  He has become one of the most versatile stars working today.
  We are 30 minutes into the film before we see Scarlett Johansson as the astonishing beauty that she is.  Prior to that moment we see her without makeup as she does the physical labor necessary in a working zoo.  When she does wash up, she of course is spectacular.  I take it as true confidence in her acting ability that allows her this risk and it is justified.  She makes her character an appealing, honest country girl, a good match for the Damon character.
 Thomas Hayden Church is very good as the accountant brother, complete with sage advice.  Elle Fanning is the girl half of the teen romance.  She has a wonderful smile and portrays the sound country virtues that our culture reveres.
 Combine a $50 million budget with really great writing and you can still go wrong.  If you add careful, unobtrusive directing and well above average acting, you have a winner, but not always a financial success.  The film has brought in only $41 million domestically in ten days and it is open to question as to how well it might do overseas.  I however liked this four saw blade family film quite a bit.",1425600000,,2978,4.461966604823748

Well made but really unnecessary.  They even manage to have a climactic showdown in the rain...  in the middle of a big-box store.  Maybe there'll be a big Expendables mash-up type movie with Jason Homefront Statham and Keanu John Wick Reeves, and Tyler Madea Perry and George Clinton all threatened by and killing each other in a Super Target.

4410140,2,B004LWZWA6,"Apparently this drag of a film is based on a true story in England.  It is loosely true in that the real mr mee did lose his professional wife to brain cancer leaving him a widower with two kids.  His extended family ie mainly his father leaving the mother an expensive London house, finances the purchase at 1.2 million pounds.

What bothered me most in this American version of a British story is the typical Hollywood portrayal of parents letting their kids have their way and never getting angry or expecting real performance at school or punishment of any kind.  Meanwhile the spoiled older son gets away wih failing and even getting expelled.  The younger daughter is seven and knows all the wise things that small
Kids are supposed to say to their fathers.  Cute but after a while just nauseating that a supposedly tough adventurous father cannot stand up to his own children and their behavior.  Had it been the dead wife who enforced the rules of the family?

Meanwhile money is the big issue.  Matt Damon as adventure writer is beginning to be a business owner later in life with no concept of cash flow.  There is fundamentally no income and employees are. Not getting paid?  Unreal and absurd!  Eat through the $84,000 left by the deceased wife with no thought for the family's survival into teen years and beyond?  House car insurance and all the rest of the bills?  Tell us the truth!

Read the story of the real Benjamin Mee in England.  You will see it has to do with lots and lots of his relatives' money.  That is about 50,000 pounds per sibling.  The real family must have simply had the money to finance a place for their old mom to stay.  Although it was her selling the father's hard earned home in London that bought the zoo!

Matt Damon does not come across as a mature and emotionally level man able to run his own life let alone a zoo.  Scarlett johansson does come across this way but she keeps insisting that she has no social skills or abilities because she is 28 and lives with her mom.  Well the reality is clear:  again a mother is financing a grown child to have a hobby called zookeepong.  Otherwise this smart and very able daughter would have to get  a real and paying job or be forced to marry a meal ticket.

I know I know!  I'm a curmudgeon of the real world.  I am someone who always worked and that made me a realist.  In hher place I would have had a real job in the town nearby so I could have money and a life of my own but I would volunteer at the zoo.  As it is she is a full time volunteer financed to do so by family.  That would come to an end at least by age 30 by the worried mother who could see no end insight to the dependency.

Well that is my two bits.  Unattractive males throughout.  Girls and women shown as smart and able and cute as can be!  Oy weh.",1418256000,,2810,4.287619047619048

The first instance of cursing had the older kids squirming uncomfortably in their seats, but we decided to give it another chance.

The subject matter SHOULD HAVE been a good fit for the entire family but we had to turn it off in the middle.  Families should not have to expose their children and grandchildren to the profanity. Profanity is the language of the uneducated who don't have sufficient ability to express themselves with real words due to lack of vocabulary.

4411409,3,B004LWZWA6,"This movie was...okay. It lacked conflict and drama and consequently it was really quite boring. It wasn't OFFENSIVE or anything, but it was pretty snooze-worthy. Damon plays a dad whose wife died and who buys a run-down zoo. They don't show any scenes with the wife except for the end, where she's seen in a brief flashback, and only THEN do you get a glimpse of how much/why they miss her so. I think she should have been shown earlier, so we'd sympathize more vividly with the characters, instead of in a very abstract sort of way.

And, I also had a problem with the deus ex machina move (SPOILER) when they're about to lose the zoo and LO AND BEHOLD, the wife left them secret money. Because she freaking predicted that her husband would lose all his inheritance and want to do something kinda crazy yet possibly wonderful.

It's not worse than a standard kids' afternoon TV show, but I expected better from Cameron Crowe.

The settings are quite pretty, though.

I watched this with my family. My kids (ages 8,12,15) were bored. My 12 year old left. The others only stayed for the popcorn.",1406419200,3,1095,4.571428571428571
4411410,4,B004LWZWA6,"This is one of those films that you know will end on a happy note. Right from the point when you start watching the first scene you know the outcome, yet you keep on watching it -Why? because corn and cheese are some times great in moderation. This is a happy sunny film that also happens to have a great soundtrack- thanks to Jonsi and Sigur Ros.
The film is based on the book by a Britisher Benjamin Mee and his account of buying a zoo. We bought a zoo moves the action to California. Matt Damon is the widower who buys the zoo with his inheritance and tries to restore it. The zoo has all kinds of problems  but will change everyone involved in it. Crowe tries and partially succeeds in keeping the viewers interests. The emotional and the family scenes are just the kind which will sell Kleenex. Of Course and there is the romance with the zookeeper Kelly (Scarlett Johansson). Its not the greatest movie of all time but such a refreshing change.",1406419200,,950,4.3977272727272725

Benjamin's son Dylan is acting out at school and and all the women in town are busy delivering food and offering much more in the way of comfort.  Desperate, Benjamin realizes his family needs a change and calls a realtor who shows them various properties that don't suit. Finally they find a large house with good acreage and a privately owned zoo. With financial help from his brother, Benjamin buys the property and a new life begins for all of them, although it is, at first, a rocky road.

I think the little girl and Elle Fanning are also excellent chracters. ""We Bought A Zoo"" says the little girl!",1402704000,,411,4.493333333333333

4411992,2,B004LWZWA6,"I didn't even finish watching this. I have higher standard for family values than this movie used. I was hopeful that it would be entertaining for me for animals mean alot to me. There are alot of us in the audience area that do not like what seems to be more accepted than ever in the way of profanity. Please, please can we not go back to a good storyline without profanity. It discolors a good movie to unpleasantness for us who refrain from using it!!!!!",1402099200,2,458,4.337209302325581

It also has a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack. It has a strong list of supporting characters and a villain that turns out to be not as bad as he seems. This is a movie that families of all sizes and ages can enjoy watching together and having meaningful discussions about it afterwards. This is one of those movies that you will watch again and again.",1401062400,,491,4.406593406593407

4412217,3,B004LWZWA6,"I was encouraged by the fact that this was based on a true story since... it sounds so preposterous.  It's a good story, but I didn't think the movie production was that great.  The casting seemed a little off.  I think Tom Cruise would have been a better fit for the role of a crazed man who can't let go of the idea in his head.  I know Matt Damon is a father now, but he still seems so stiff (despite his role as man with a relentless adventurous spirit) and I'm just not buying his paternal role.  Little Rosie is a hit, but the other characters seemed a little forced.  I think I wanted it to feel more like Funny Farm, but I just wasn't feeling like it.  The soundtrack was a plus.  Maybe I'll try the book.",1399852800,,713,4.079136690647482

4412221,4,B004LWZWA6,It's also a family movie which is a plus it's very wonderful and very sad in parts but over all a very awesome movie I'm glad I got it is very funny to I think in parts it is,1399593600,,174,3.4871794871794872

4412316,5,B004LWZWA6,"Just loved it!  It was based on a true story -- dealt with a young widower and his two children dealing with the events of the past 6 months.  He decides he needs a change - a move from the town to a place with more space for the kids and a tad more privacy. The property he falls in love with has a slight condition attached to it -- it is a run-down, private zoo - and it's all one package.  Comes complete with staff.  Should he do it?  His funny, business-minded accountant brother adamantly advises against it.....  Yet it just feels right.  The staff is full of colorful characters, and there are some amazing animals there to be taken care of. Can they really make a go of it, or will this lead to failure and bankrupcy?  SEE THIS MOVIE!",1399334400,,744,4.190140845070423
4412317,5,B004LWZWA6,We saw this as a family a few years ago and all of us loved it. My middle daughter who is now 14 really loves it.

4412320,5,B004LWZWA6,"This is a delightful, heartwarming, and touching comedy movie.  It is a departure from the traditional action packed movies that Matt Damon usually does in the past, and he does an excellent job of showing the feminine side of himself.  There are some hysterical characters in the movie.  The movie has a great story line.  The movie is a very ""John Steinbeck"" type of movie--perseverance of the human spirit in times of trial, and you end up rooting for the underdog.  It is a great, wholesome family movie, and finally one with no sex in it.  I wholeheartedly recommend it.  This is a movie my husband and I have in our collection and watch over and over.",1398729600,,657,4.564102564102564

4412363,4,B004LWZWA6,"As a seasoned zookeeper I really do love this movie. There are a few parts that make me cringe and go ""that would never actually happen!"" like leaving 50 snakes in one giant crate unsorted or quarantined or even separated. I have never seen that. Also, the next day the snakes are just hanging around and easy to pick up. WHAT? they would be LONG gone. Or the part with the lion's door (ever hear of shift gates?) that would also not happen. I did appreciate the scene where he walks into the kitchen for the first time and encounters the ""diet kitchen smell"" that's totally truthful and yes, you get used to the smell. I love that it shows how hard we struggle emotionally when an elderly animal is in need of an end of life plan. I also wish that more keepers looked like Matt Damon and Scarlett Johansson... alas we do not LOL  Overall, I love the movie.",1396915200,,857,4.3229813664596275

4412365,3,B004LWZWA6,"I don't usually like Matt Damon in movies but he was really good in this one. I liked the teenage son, the twinkly little girl, and the zookeepers. Scarlett Johansson seemed out of place and miscast, but she also acted well. What a treat to see a glimpse of Peter Riegert (I loved him in Local Hero)! A very entertaining story but it could have been much stronger if they had tackled the bigger issues of humans and animals.",1396828800,,424,4.379746835443038

I am not really a Matt Damon fan, however, he does well here in this roll.  There are some deep themes and some language so I am not sure it's appropriate for younger ones, but parents decide.  This story is based on a true life story and I wanted to go right away to see it... but it's actually in England... so it might be awhile.  :)",1394323200,,477,3.968421052631579

He has lived on adventure most of his life, and he wants his kids to have an adventure too, while doing something for someone else.  In this case a dilapidated animal park.

4412839,3,B004LWZWA6,I hope someone gets the point that it is definitely not necessary to write 20 words to descript whether you like something.  The stars are more than enough in some cases.

4412979,5,B004LWZWA6,I enjoyed Matt Damon this movie.  He's an incredibly talented actor and he made the most of this role too.  Loved the rest of the cast as well and the story line.  The youngest one was too precious for words!  Definitely would recommend.,1391731200,,237,4.441860465116279

It was entertaining, funny, showed how dead wife/mother affected the family and ability to move on with new love.  We need more movies that whole family can enjoy,",1391558400,,262,4.395833333333333

4413083,5,B004LWZWA6,"This movie is special to our family because we also lost a loved one.  The special connection this movie makes between the father and his children is powerful.  In addition, it was extremely helpful in understanding feelings of others.",1391385600,,235,5.0

4413088,5,B004LWZWA6,"I appreciate watching a movie with a big star that is morally clean to watch. It is a good story written well and acted well also. It is a movie that can be watched with children without the fear of anything inappropriate popping up, and as a Christian I appreciate the writers and actors that can create an interesting project as this is. I am tired of the shock treatment of verbal and sexual vulgarity that is prevalent in most movies today.

4413090,5,B004LWZWA6,"I love the movie, however, with that being said i would rate it as a PG-13 not PG.  I think a lot of people look at PG rated movies and think they would be perfect for kids, i don't feel this one is. The son draws some pretty dark pictures through the movie, and the zoo inspector lusting after the zoo keeper and a lot of drinking through the film are a few examples. I am not saying it wasn't a good movie, i loved the movie, which is why i bought it, I am just saying that in my opinion it may not be appropriate for kids under 13.",1390780800,,534,3.8545454545454545
4413181,5,B004LWZWA6,"My husband and I just loved this movie. Everything about it made it a joy to watch (even the scenes that reminded us that life is not always happy). The special feature about the animal actors was very interesting as well. I don't know why anyone would give this a bad review as it really was a wonderful movie with entertaining quirky characters, beautiful scenes, and it gave viewers a sense that families can come together if they work towards that goal. A real treat to watch.",1390608000,,480,4.528735632183908

4413183,3,B004LWZWA6,"I read the reviews below 3 stars and couldn't disagree more. we didn't watch this for award winning acting, or an award winning script. the story sounded entertaining and the movie in fact is just that. it should be fine for younger kids and maybe on up to teenagers (say up to 14 or so). we didn't regret spending the 2 hours watching it, although i must admit the first 1/2 hour or so was rather slow... I don't need to see it a second time.",1390435200,,443,4.162790697674419

4413190,3,B004LWZWA6,"Younger children will enjoy the film, and I didn't mind watching it with mine at all. The performances were fine, as was the story, but it was predictable enough that even my 10 year old guessed several characters' (obvious) next lines or actions.

4413357,5,B004LWZWA6,It's a good heart warming story with a happy ending. Also shows the tribulations of purchasing a home (and zoo) and what people have to go up against to save what they have and what they have worked hard for.,1389657600,,208,4.225
4413358,5,B004LWZWA6,"What a nice movie to watch. It's nice to see that there are still some movies out there you can watch with the whole family, without being embarrassed. Compared to the Dvd, this is so much nicer in Blu-Ray. I am glad I finally bought it. It is filmed in the 1:85:1 screen ratio {which means is fills the whole screen}. Not my favorite, but what can you do. The Audio sounded real nice to me, although I do listen through my stereo system. No fancy equipment at my house, yet. I like the Cast in this. Matt & Scarlett do a really nice job with this movie. The Sound Track on this is really nice too. It has lots of good Special Features which are: Deleted & Extended scenes {lots of them}: Gag Reel: We shot a zoo {The making of the movie - 1:15:00 long} This is pretty good: Their Happy is Too Loud {About the music in the movie}: The Real Mr. Mee: Photo Gallery {Lots of Pics}: Audio Commentary: Sneak Peak & a Trailer. Over all a really nice movie & lots of good Special Features. I'm glad I got this on Blu-Ray. Most of the Special Features are not on the Dvd.",1389571200,,1063,4.140096618357488

I think the guy that told me about it was more impressed than I was and he over stated how good it was but I'm glad I own it and would recommend it.  It is a movie about a family that pulls together to accomplish somthing big ... and you'll have to watch to see how things end up working out.",1389398400,,464,3.873684210526316

4413605,5,B004LWZWA6,"What a fantastic movie for the whole family.  It is the type of movie that is excellent for those who are experiencing or have gone through grief.  It has elements of hope, strength through family, how communications with each other is so important and can help heal.

You may get choked up watching this movie.  That is because the characters are so relatable and you can empathize with them so much, that when the crescendo of the movie happens it makes you smile and feel the joy Damon's brother in the movie tells him to try and experience again.

If you enjoy seeing animals this is a beautiful movie as well.  They are very much supporting characters in this film, both literally and metaphorically.

The imagery is beautiful, and with the music when one animal escapes and is seen by a main character in a completely free, natural way, you feel the profound awe right along with the character that through their fine acting they convey.

I have really become a Matt Damon fan in recent years with this movie, Hereafter, and The Adjustment Bureau.  They are all ""gentle"" movies overall, with hope triumphing over pain.

Bottom-line: I paid a rare full price for this movie after renting it once and loving it.  It is well-worth the cost.  One you will watch repeatedly.  A beautiful movie of hope amidst so many cynical movies during such cynical times.",1386892800,,1359,4.6835443037974684

4413697,5,B004LWZWA6,"I didn't want to watch this movie. It looked like it was your standard fare about a family trying something out of its element, and hijjinks ensue. Blah. But the poignancy of the family losing a wife/mother before the movie begins adds an emotional depth to We Bought A Zoo that would have been out of reach with an intect family. There are scenes in this movie that make me cry. There are other scenes that make me happy, as the characters work through their loss together. Every time I watch this movie it becomes richer. The soundtrack is excellent and complementary to the movie tone, which starts out mired and reaches joyous at several points. Just an excellent job all around. Be aware that there *is* sadness, but this movie also provides many teachable moments about coping with death and finding meaning in life.",1384819200,,822,4.675862068965517

4413753,3,B004LWZWA6,"Movie is very sweet in an old fashioned 'Disney' family film way.  It is corny and very predictable but I still found myself watching it until the end.  Based on a true story that is pretty amazing, it stars Matt Damon as the central character who decides he wants to start a zoo on some land he buys after a personal tragedy.(don't want to give away the plot)
Matt Damon is great but the movie is light and non-substantive.  If you are looking for a movie you can watch with your kids, this might be it.  But, if you are looking for more adult entertainment, I would turn to some more recent Matt Damon films.",1383782400,,610,4.278260869565218

The ""bad guy"" plays in really great to a bunch of misfits trying to make this thing work.  It's just a nice story about people and how animals can touch them without contact, and without the 'action graphics'.

4413934,4,B004LWZWA6,"This movie is filled with charm and subtlety. It is based on a real story...surprising events that make a great story.  Matt Damon is a widower with one little girl and a boy who is a 'tween.  His son Dylan is expelled from school for acting out and this young father who is on his own is clueless.  Maggie Elizabeth Jones, as the little girl ""Rosie"", is absolutely adorable.  Then, one day, they buy a beautiful little house that ""has some complications""....it's a zoo....that comes with a staff (Elle Fanning, Scarlett Johansson, and Patrick Fugit from ""Almost Famous""!).  It almost seems like this grieving family needs these animals as much as the animals need them.  There is a lot of work getting the zoo up to code before an official inspection will license them.

This is really good story-telling (having a really good story helps).  The acting, directing, cinematography, pacing, etc. all add up to make this a film that you should really give a chance.  It's such a ""feel good movie""!  If you can't buy a zoo, buy the next best thing...this charming movie.",1381449600,,1067,4.718918918918919

4413939,5,B004LWZWA6,"A favorite in my house.  The animals are a big part of this story which is nice for the kids.  But the parent-child dynamic is wonderful. It does not hide or brush over the ugly parts of parenting: the struggles, the mistakes, the fights.

This video takes place in California instead of England (as in the book), but it seems to translate well.  An added feature is that the man who wrote the book and his children appear in the film, climbing over a tree to enter the zoo.

I recommend this to people who like animals and do not mind zoos, and to people who like life-affirming, heart-warming stories.",1375574400,,506,4.239583333333333
4414324,3,B004LWZWA6,"Look, this movie is not ""terrible"", but it's really not a good movie. I'm not sure why Matt Damon wanted to taint his reputation with this film, but he dedicates himself to the role. My partner enjoyed this film, he thought it was a good ""family"" one and he liked the animals. That's fair enough, I liked the animals, too, but I wanted more from the film than what it was able to deliver.

The children in the movie are not my cup of tea - I found the son annoying, but the narrative needed that conflict to make a ""nice"" moment towards the end. It is a good family film, but I prefer the older ones like Andre and Free Willy. This one was a bit messy, I thought, and Johansson didn't fit her role very well. The romance was unbelievable, as was handing over a zoo to someone who clearly has no experience.

The true story appealed to me. I am always interested in how other people live and overcome obstacles. I found the telling of the story a bit boring though. The little girl was ADORABLE. The son was a very effective actor and his part was well written; however, I didn't get the angst or personality development of the rest of the characters that was needed to make this really move me. It was just ""Aw, that's sweet."" If that is what you are looking for, you'll like it. It's a movie you can sit down with your kids and enjoy.",1371945600,,803,4.147435897435898

I got it and watched it with my mom and she stayed awake for the whole thing (she usually gets bored and falls a sleep) and she said she really liked it... Then I watched it with my dad and he also said he really enjoyed it and was glad to have seen it... Its a really cute movie... and no its not just a chick flick...,1369872000,,565,3.7563025210084033

On day at the local video rental store (yes we still have those in the sticks), my girls saw it and asked to bring it home.  We did, watched it, and really liked it.  We then came on Amazon to buy our own copy.  Since, a well liked movie in our house means multiple viewings.  Just enough drama to keep you interested, but not much that you are left sad.  I would recommend this movie to any family.",1368316800,,487,4.127659574468085

It is a film for the whole family, though at times its a bit too slow moving to keep kids' attentions.  When I saw the extended scenes though, for one, I loved them... but two, sadly I felt the movie would have been significantly better if they had stayed in.  They cut out out some interesting heartfelt and/or funny moments that would have given some more sparks to the full feature.  All in all though, I have to recommend it... again, just be sure to watch the deleted and extended scenes... they are some of the best I have ever seen for extra footage... and there were some especially good zoo moments lost in the editing.",1368316800,,783,4.2

His need to start over, to escape his own personal sadness and devote himself to something bigger than all of them. You find yourself cheering for them, and for the staff of this little menagerie, as they struggle every day to keep the zoo afloat and make it better than before. You'll find humor, too, as the family gets accustomed to their new home and new life. It's a great family film and I think it teaches us all lessons about life. It gets you thinking about your own life and all the possibilities there are to live your own great adventure.",1368144000,,726,4.385185185185185

It would have been a great family film otherwise. I think they tried to use every form of God's name in vain as well as every allowable swear word for a PG rating. My kids won't be watching it again as I certainly don't want those attitudes and language repeated in my house.  Cute story, great idea for a kids movie.... but somehow.... that got lost.",1367625600,3,482,4.465909090909091
4414899,4,B004LWZWA6,"I just saw another film based upon true-life events -- ""The Impossible"" -- which is similar to this film in the sense that this is also based upon a true story.  ""Impossible"" was about a family from Spain who was on vacation during the 2004 tsunami, while ""Zoo"" is about a guy and his kids in the UK (I believe) who, well, bought a zoo.  And I have given both of these films a 4-star rating.

However, I gave ""Impossible"" that rating with some huge caveats.  I wasn't nearly as brutal as Christy Lemire however, who called ""Impossible"" ""heavy handed"" while giving it a ""C rating.""  And I didn't really complain about how the original family in ""Impossible"" was incorrectly portrayed as being from an English-speaking country, or how the people who lived in the area of the tsunami were almost completely ignored over the rich vacationers like A.O. Scott.  (I am paraphrasing them a bit.  Do a web search and you can find their full reviews.)

But I read a review on this site where an Amazon customer seemed to imply that ""accuracy in film is overrated.""  That one caught my eye.  Now, I believe that this opinion is completely wrong because it dumps all movies into the same bucket.  To me there are huge differences in genre.  For example, ""The Impossible"" is a disaster film -- perhaps even a documdrama to some extent -- about true-life events where a quarter of a million people were actually killed;"" while ""Zoo"" is a dramatic comedy -- or ""dramedy"" as I believe it is called -- which is surely lighter fare.  Without giving too much away, the mom died in ""Zoo"" (I don't know if this was an actual event) but Act One\Scene One occurs quite a while after that.

So to me, there's the rub with saying that ""accuracy in film is overrated.""  I'm sure that many liberties were taken with ""Zoo,"" one of them was location, of course.  (And while watching the film, I wasn't convinced that the new zoo owner actually stood up against a half-ton grizzly.)  But those liberties didn't bother me since this is a comedy, a ""family-friendly"" film.  You surely couldn't call ""Impossible"" family-friendly.  After all, it was a true-life devastating event.  But also, there is partial nudity with Naomi Watts in that other film.  So I believe that the director of ""Impossible"" was off-base a bit with some of those liberties, while the director of ""Zoo"" was not.

Well, I liked both films, but I have to admit that I actually liked this one just a little bit more.  Sure, they both took liberties with their ""true"" stories.  But ""Zoo"" can be forgiven for those liberties, while I'm not quite convinced the same holds for ""The Impossible.""",1367452800,,2628,4.62634989200864

I suppose if you want a nice, predictable movie for kids under 10-12, then this would be a good choice.  Otherwise, adults will be running to their doctors to have their blood sugar tested because this film is so  sickeningly sweet.

Once again, he shows how underrated and versatile he is in We Bought A Zoo. This true story follows a man who is always looking for an adventure, and he found one when he decided to save a rundown zoo in southern California. I don't know about the book, but this film was so well written, that it seemed like it was finished in no time! Damon was great, but in my opinion, it's his son and film narrator, Colin Ford, that steals the show. Ford starred in one of my favorite movies, Dog Days of Summer, when he was younger and I've followed his career ever since. He's mostly had bit parts, but every time I see this kid, his performance just gets better and better, and he absolutely blows everyone away in this film. I'm usually unimpressed by teens in film, in fact I want to smack most of them, but Ford is definitely the exception, and really adds an important dynamic to this film.

4415524,5,B004LWZWA6,"The 2011 film We Bought a Zoo, directed by Cameron Crowe, is a heart-warming film based on a true story. The film is about a newly widowed father willing to go to the ends of the earth and back to provide everything his two young children need to heal from the loss of their mother and to live happy and meaningful lives. In order to give his family a fresh start, the main character, Benjamin Mee, moves the family to a very unlikely place, a rundown zoo in southern California. The family's adventure of starting over begins here where they rebuild the zoo while simultaneously becoming very close with the zoo staff and the animals. We Bought a Zoo is a well-made film featuring the grieving process of losing a loved one, brilliant acting, and enough drama and adventure to keep the interest of any audience.

 The main character, Benjamin Mee, is played by Matt Damon who does an amazing job of portraying a father who recently lost his soul mate and is left with the responsibility of raising two young children on his own. He is very down to earth and brings an abundant amount of heart and courage to the film in the way he refuses to take pity from people like his boss and women who offer home cooked meals for the family. The children are seven-year-old Rosey, who can be described as wise beyond her years, played by Maggie Elizabeth Jones and 14 year-old Dylan played by Colin Ford who is in a rebellious, moody stage and gets expelled from school. Another main character is the head zookeeper, Kelly, played by Scarlett Johansson whose grace and sense of humor adds an element of compassion to the film. Scarlett Johansson is brilliant in this film because of her dedication to the zoo animals and her sincerity towards Benjamin with whom chemistry slowly evolves.  The witty Thomas Haden Church plays Benjamin's brother, Duncan, who is an accountant and does not hold his tongue when it comes to telling Benjamin that he has lost his mind for uprooting the kids from their old life and moving them to a rundown zoo. Cameron Crowe's collaboration of genuine actors helps keep the audiences' interest and allows them to relate to the characters in a meaningful way.

  The setting of We Bought a Zoo is immediately intriguing. As mentioned earlier, the film takes place in an absolutely stunning area of southern California. Throughout the entire movie gorgeous scenes of the sunset, sunrise, rolling hills, the grand mountainous land and old withered trees reaching up towards the sky are abundant. The scenery in this movie is fantastic. Along with the stellar scenery, the film also features emotional, moving music. In a couple of scenes at the end of the movie, the music alone is enough to bring one to tears. The successful combination of scenery and music add real dimension to this film.

  The only true downfall of this film is most definitely the predictability of the story line. The movie goes from one clich event to the next. However, it is a feel good movie, so a happy ending is appreciated. This movie was certainly written for the purpose of bringing a family together over a bowl of popcorn and enjoying themselves. There is not much originality in this film as evident by the events of the story, but the film is entertaining nonetheless.

  The movie We Bought a Zoo is a great example of the importance of perseverance when life gets tough. Bad things happen to good people, but with the right mindset these ""bad"" things can certainly transform into true gifts, as it does for Benjamin and his children. This film seems to remind everyone that life is what one makes it, if one does not take chances one will never know what could happen. It reminds one to be willing to take chances because, as Benjamin repeatedly says in the film, ""Why not?""",1361232000,,3781,4.677710843373494

4415915,3,B004LWZWA6,"Just watched this, surprisingly good with the exception of Scarlett Johanssen (I'm so out of the loop, I didn't know who she was).  Her very strange looks (I kept thinking she overdid botox in her lips (apparently that isn't true; they seem to be hers) and complete lack of acting ability was totally distracting.  The rest of the cast did a great job, and it's a good story which I didn't realize was true until the end.  Two other nitpiks:  apparently the production was too cheap to film in England where the story takes place, and, guess what, it looks like where it was filmed, California.  Confusing and boring.  The scene where everyone has to collect the box of poisonous snakes that got loose is ludicrous.  Who in the name of God would scoop up handfuls of poisonous snakes by hand?

I want to expand on Scarlett Johanssen.  If you have the female lead in a movie, shouldn't you be able to act?  I kept hoping Matt Damon wouldn't fall for this nitwit, screaming, ""No"" when he finally kisses her.  Scarlett is completely self-involved; that is NOT acting.  She is not attractive (although some modelling agency thought so at one time).  What does she bring to the screen?  Acting?  No.  Beauty?  No.  Humor?  No.  I honestly think she ruined this film.  Who is the genius who cast her?  If you want to make a good movie (the audience would appreciate it), get another casting director!",1358467200,,1394,4.604081632653061

The love interest was new (not in the book) but a welcome addition. And, of course, the animals are the best part. The one thing we couldn't understand is why they needed to throw in the gratuitous cussing, particularly from the little girl in the movie.

4416462,4,B004LWZWA6,"MOVIE RATING:  3.5 stars (B)

With Jerry Maguire (1996) and Almost Famous (2000) at the top of his filmography, most cinephiles eagerly awaited director Cameron Crowe's latest movie We Bought A Zoo (2011), especially since his last feature film was the rather disappointing Elizabethtown (2005) six years ago. And by snagging both Matt Damon and Scarlett Johansson as his lead actors, Crowe had two big plusses going for him right off the bat. I had reasonable expectations for Zoo, but after seeing the trailer and the PG rating, I wasn't really sure what I was gonna get. In the end, I got a very good, heartfelt and funny, family film. It worked for me despite it's many flaws. For 2 hours, I managed to escape into a world that feels like a modern take on the Disney classic Swiss Family Robinson (1960), which I fell in love with as a kid and still enjoy watching from time to time as an adult.

Zoo definitely has its ""problems"" cinematically: it's predictable, contrived, and pretty saccharin sweet in its almost fairytale like qualities. And yet I really love it somehow. There's just something about it's simple story, cute kids and animals, and personal growth ""life lessons"" vibe that when paired with Crowe's great taste in music, Damon's lead acting performance, the supporting cast, and good editing, it comes together and works on a level greater than its parts. Cameron Crowe came through once again with something uniquely his own. I drank the Zoo elixir and got the Zoo buzz.",1355616000,,1493,4.801556420233463

This movie did not disappoint me. I found the story rather charming, though I have to say I wish they would have kept the story closer to the actual true story (google if you're interested; it's a great story to read), but alas Hollywood can never get things quite right.

In the end, I am happy with my purchase. I would caution, however, not to overspend on this movie. In my opinion, 5-7 dollars  is a good price range.",1355443200,,595,4.390909090909091

I was really disappointed in that. I don't need my little ones hearing that language and possibly repeating it. In my opinion, this movie is stretching the PG rating for sure.

4416691,4,B004LWZWA6,"I think it's admirable that a guy who normally stars in action flicks (Matt Damon) would star in a family drama/comedy such as this one.  He plays the part of a father who has to raise a teenage son and young daughter.  When the son gets expelled from school, they decide to pack their bags and start over in a country house that has one very unusual problem- there's a zoo in the back yard!  Lions, bears, owls, snakes, tigers... they're all there!  Though compared to most zoos the selection is rather small, but who cares.  Oh and of course, when your child gets expelled from school, you probably won't be moving the entire family somewhere else.  You'll be sending the son somewhere else.  Oh well, minor issues!

There's a couple things that strike a little close to home.  No, I don't own my own zoo.  Would be nice perhaps, but I ain't stepping foot anywhere close to that grizzly bear!  Even that weak tiger responsible for the more emotional moment near the end is still strong enough to be considered a major threat to me!  The storyline is about maintaining these animals all for the grand opening which happens to be on July 7th... which is my birthday!  Let me tell you something, it's *never* sunny on that day either.  Storyline flaw, haha.  The other similarity is that I lost my mom and it was just me and my father raising me when I was around the age of the teenage son in the film, so it's an interesting and minor coincidence that these two connections are ones I can relate to.

I take away one point because the storyline slows down to a crawl about 30 minutes in, and it takes another 30 minutes to break away from it which means overall the movie is slightly overlong.  Also, the romance building between the teenage son and the beautiful blonde-haired girl feels a tad incomplete.  Overall, great movie.  The young daughter is especially smart and hilarious the way she seems very observant, mature for her age, and doesn't hold her feelings inside.  Matt Damon works great as a sentimental father, which is a surprising role for him.  I'm totally not used to seeing him in this kind of role but he was convincingly emotional after a fight he got into with his son that shows he's excellent at portraying a single father with kids.  Highly recommended.",1351900800,,2279,4.547911547911548
4416692,4,B004LWZWA6,"So what is not to like about a family-oriented story of a guy, an ex-wild and wooly reporter guy ready, willing, and able to tackle any assignment the tougher the better, who having grievously lost his young wife to some unfathomable illness and left with two children, one an endearing pre-teen girl and the other an alienated, angst-ridden teen age boy (reminding me of another very alienated young man without the dead mother angle) decides (or has karmic forces decide) to do right by the kids and get them the hell out of the maw of civilization. Oh, and buy a zoo.

Nothing, nothing at all. No my plan A (or Plan B, C, or D) but a plan that father Matt Damon spends the film trying to work through against might and main odds, and the occasional  ten thousand obstacles thrown in the way of success before good-heartedness, perseverance, and a little magical realism  save the day for him and his. The only thing I don't get, get at all, is why a thinking guy, a serious family man thinking guy, took so long to go after the head zookeeper, Scarlett Johansson, a thinking man's thinking woman if there ever was one.  Matt, Lou says more than a zoo will do, okay.",1351900800,,1168,4.469483568075117

It's interesting, heart-warming, full of cute animals, has one adorable kid, budding romance, you name it and it's got it. To find out it is a true story made it even more special. Be sure to watch it with someone else who cries, because in places it will tear at your emotions. I highly recommend it, especially for children.

You'll only be disappointed if you're looking for a lot of filth, violence, sex, profanity, blood, and overall pointlessness!

4417301,4,B004LWZWA6,"Matt Damon plays Benjamin Mee, a recently widowed father of two, who, in order to restart his and his family's life, buys a Southern California house that comes with a small zoo (complete with animals and the staff). The incredible story is based on Mee's memoir published in 2008 (the events really happened in Devonshire, England).

While Benjamin slowly gains the trust of the zoo staff led by the spirited head keeper Kelly (Scarlett Johansson), they have to overcome numerous obstacles including financial trouble, before the zoo's opening. The film's subplots include a romance between Benjamin's troubled son Dylan (Colin Ford) and a young girl Lily (Elle Fanning).

Cameron Crowe's first feature film in six years (since disappointing ""Elizabethtown""), ""We Bought a Zoo"" marks a semi-comeback for Crowe, a uniquely talented director who has given us such films as ""Say Anything...,"" ""Jerry Maguire"" and, of course, autobiographical ""Almost Famous,"" which I think is his best.

Adapted for screen by Aline Brosh McKenna (""The Devil Wears Prada"") and Crowe himself, ""We Bought a Zoo"" is not totally without familiar elements like Duncan, Benjamin's reluctantly helpful older brother (Thomas Haden Church), but despite its predictable storyline, ""We Bought a Zoo"" is a heart-warming comedy drama with nice soundtrack music.",1342396800,,1328,5.405797101449275
4417352,3,B004LWZWA6,"We've all done it - read a movie's description, decided we trust the actors, and oops - sat down to watch it with our kids without watching it all the way through ourselves first.  Yes, PG means parents should be more careful - but sometimes you just don't have time to watch a movie twice.  Don't do that with this movie.  It's such a shame - there is no reason this movie couldn't have been enjoyable and appropriate for kids as young as 5 or 6 years old.  However, the moviemakers decided to go for the cheap laughs a couple of times by having the cute 8-year-old in the movie use completely inappropriate curse words, and then top it off with a discussion of the Easter bunny that could easily lead to some ruined fantasies in your household.  None of these moments add anything to the movie, and leaving them out would have made the story accessible to a much larger audience.  It isn't a bad movie, but my comment is meant as a ""Buyer Beware"" for parents with younger kids who might have thought that a movie about an 8-year-old should be appropriate for an 8-year-old to watch!",1342224000,6,1084,4.422110552763819

Matt Damon is even more frightening than he was in ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" and Scarlett J. is the Louise Brooks of our time.  The construction of the ""zoo,"" the sense that the children have seen the nightmare coming and the final ""barbecue"" leave a viewer breathless and horrified.  One moral qualm -- should we really see endangered animals slaughtered so cavalierly?  I don't think so -- surely some work can be done with animation.

As you might expect Benjamin Mee (Damon) struggles with solo child rearing.  His precocious 7 year old daughter (Maggie Elizabeth Jones) is making her own lunch for school and tries to be helpful.  His 14 year old son (very good Colin Ford) on the other hand gets expelled from school for stealing and drawing bizarre Daliesque images.  He also seems to hate his dad.

Benjamin (""Ben was my dad"") decides they need to move away from the city so eventually they settle on a large house in the country, 9 miles from Target and Home Depot.  The one wrinkle is that it comes with a real life working zoo.  And Benjamin needs to get it up and running for its reopening.  The zookeeper is comely Scarlett Johansson.  Sure it is.  Now Benjamin pines throughout the film for his beautiful departed wife, but manages to get into the work.  It is costing him a fortune but he likes it.  A cousin of Kelly the zookeeper is Lily (Elle Fanning) who is a year or two younger than morose Dylan (Ford) and she of course, takes a liking to his brooding personality.

The film's direction is easy to predict and Crowe and company are certainly breaking no new ground.  The tear ducts are assaulted on a regular basis, but damn if I wasn't drawn in.  What makes this film more than the standard syrupy sentimental drama is Damon's performance.  It doesn't seem to matter with him as to whether he's kicking ass as Jason Bourne or doing animation voice work, he gives it his all.  And it is clearly evident in this PG family drama.  Some punches are pulled to hold on to the rating, but it is an enjoyable film for everyone...unless you still believe in the Easter Bunny.

The Blu ray version of this film is excellent.  There are no complaints either with the video (1.85:1 aspect ratio) or the excellent DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack.",1341187200,,2127,4.481770833333333

4417434,5,B004LWZWA6,"Our whole family enjoyed this endearing film that depicts the true-life story of a family that, you guess it, bought a zoo.  Well, really they bought the perfect home and the failing zoo just happened to come along with it.  This particular family is struggling to overcome the recent loss of their wife/mother.  Not surprisingly, their efforts to save the animals of the zoo assist them in working through their grief and bring them closer together.

There are no big surprises here (maybe because this is really how things played out in real life), but stories of hard work and passion creating family unity are pretty timeless.

And, apparently, there is something for everyone.  After the movie, my 12 year-old daughter said ""He sure is cute.""
Me:  ""I know.  Matt Damon is really cute.""

4417638,3,B004LWZWA6,"My husband and I watched this a couple nights ago; I'd heard it was cute.

I didn't read the description closely enough, because I was surprised that the whole movie seemed to be about a grieving family.  I think I was expecting her death to be distant background, and I thought the movie would be about BUYING A ZOO!!!  Instead, every aspect of buying the zoo and getting it started was totally saturated with grief--the man is grieving the loss of his wife, and the teenage boy is grieving the loss of his mother, and the cute little girl misses her mommy.

So, instead of being upbeat and fun, I felt like the movie was kind of a downer.  I was excited about the adventure aspect of buying the zoo, but it wasn't an adventure movie, it was a grieving movie.  Not what I expected or hoped for.

Aside from that, the movie was fine.  If I had realized it was going to be so centered on the death of the wife/mother and I was expecting that, I probably would have enjoyed the movie more.  Some parts are a little cheesy, but overall it's a nice story.

Kind of amazing that it is based on a true story; it seems like that sort of thing would never happen because of all the laws and regulations, so I would be interested to learn more about the actual family.",1339977600,,1259,4.274261603375527

I know it sounds kind of cynical but that is my approach to giving movies a chance. I must admit I am so glad that I did.

Huh!  It really was quite good!  And that, to me, was a really pleasant surprise.

Enter Matt Damon (think the ""Bourne"" movies) - in this movie he plays a grieving widower and father of two children.  He struggles as he mourns the loss of his wife to illness and as he tries to provide for and connect with his children who are also dealing with the loss of their mother in their own ways.  I also have to say that I really liked the character who played the brother...not quite comic relief, but a flavor of it.

And so this grieving family buys a zoo!?  That's where the concept of this movie initially lost me.  But the collection of characters, their development and their interactions were all quite good - even for Scarlett Johansson who plays the head zookeeper.

I don't know that I'd recommend this movie to anyone who is seriously grieving themselves - it's not a self-help movie by any stretch of the imagination, but it is a good story.  And I felt even more so when I learned in the titles at the end of the film that the movie was based on a true story.

All in all, engaging, enjoyable, and good family entertainment for the, um, >12 year old crowd.

4417711,5,B004LWZWA6,"Matt Damon and Scarlett Johansen star in this heartwarming story of starting over and overcoming obstacles.

Damon stars as Benjamin Mee.  Benjamin's wife passed away six months earlier and his life has been a whirlwind of keeping up with his two kids as well as working at a job he no longer likes.  Looking for a career change and a new home, Benjamin discovers an old victorian-style house in the country.  However, this house is much more than Benjamin bargained for; it's also a zoo, complete with bears, tigers, porcupines, and other animals.  Undeterred, Benjamin goes ahead with the purchase.  He has also inherited the zoo's staff, led by head zookeeper Kelly (Scarlett Johansen).

Benjamin and Kelly must deal not only with the animals, but also the snuffy inspector who has the power to shut the zoo down.  With words of encouragement from his brother, Benjamin sticks it out and, with Kelly's help, manage to get the zoo up and running again.

I watched this movie with my children and we all enjoyed it very much.

4417844,3,B004LWZWA6,"I wasn't sure what to expect here.  I mean, I love Scarlett Johansson, and the reviews all pointed to this being one of her finer performances, but overall this was a PG rated family film starring Matt Damon and I'm not always sold on either of those contributing factors.

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with various aspects of this film, but my initial assumptions about the corny, melodramatic manipulation of the genre were proven true as well.

The film centers around the true story of Benjamin Mee, a man who recently lost his wife in death.  His kids are obviously wounded, especially his son, and he personally can't seem to let it go.  Everything and everyone and everyplace reminds him of her, and so he goes house hunting and finds a beautiful home adjacent to a fully functional zoo that he buys and must now run, despite knowing nothing about what he is doing.  The staff is skeptical, but Benjamin isn't a quitter and he finds a way to make this the biggest adventure he or his family has ever had.  Along the way, he has to work out some personal issues with his son, but like all family centered dramas, the happy ending is right around the corner.

The acting is decent here.  Scarlett Johansson is certainly the standout.  She really calms down her sexuality to create a character who is truly lived in.  You can feel the weight of the job and the concern and the `life' in her eyes, yet she still has that alluring quality so when Damon's character says he's not going to hit on her and she says ""If I wanted you to kiss me you'd have no choice"" you believe her.  The little munchkin that plays his daughter is just too cure for words, and Elle Fanning is delightful as the fidgety twelve year old vying for Damon's grumpy son's attention.

The film's rise and fall comes in the script.  It is in parts very witty or at least delivers its comedic flourishes with charm.  Some of the jokes land just right.  Sadly, there are too many clich&eacute;s here and some of the characters are borderline irritating in their campy quality (J.B. Smoove and John Michael Higgins especially).  This takes away drastically from the overall impact of the film.

The work with the animals was lovely, and the cinematography was bright and vibrant and alluring in itself.  The score was beautiful, and the theme song by Jonsi should have won an Oscar (break my heart), but this film can't rise above average in my book.",1338336000,,2427,4.576388888888889

4417846,5,B004LWZWA6,"If you're thinking of buying this you probably already know the movie.  It's a fine story played out with Cameron Crowe's usual sensitive thoughtful style.  Well cast.  Good production value.  The disc?  Unusually satisfying.  If you're on the fence about this title, I can tell you the extras make it a worthy purchase.  There is a substantial feature on the real people that is moving and interesting.  Some nice 'making of"" bits as well.  The one sore spot is the commentary where the director and an associate take a back seat to some rambling doofus actor who is not remotely as amusing as the three of them think he is.  Much valuable time is wasted as this guy blah-blahs incessantly when we could have been given more valuable info and insight from the actual filmmakers.  That one drawback aside, there is still more added value here on the main disc than you usually get, on top of a damn good movie.  There is even an alternate, ""family friendly"" soundtrack that overdubs some of the language  -  thing is I don't recall any particularly bad language, but hey, if you're a schoolteacher nun afraid of corrupting young minds, you're covered.  Navigation here is thankfully more like conventional DVDs in that there are full screen menus instead of the recent trend toward just a bland pop-up.

One minute the Dad and son are fighting and the next second, bam Matt Damon's character tells everyone watching that the Easter Bunny is fake.  WHY??????  This could seriously have been edited out!!!!  Also there are quite a few swear words in the film and at the very end the little girl calls another character a ""dick"".  Obviously she was just repeating what she'd overheard, but I still was jolted when she said it.  Thankfully my oldest daughter misheard her and asked me, ""what's a gimp?""  and I said, ""Oh, that's someone who walks with a limp.  She, Rosie, must have mixed up what she heard!""

Based on a true story, the acting and script are above average, with fun scenes with the eccentric zoo employees and animals. It may not stand up to many repeated viewings, but it was entertaining and moving.  It has some questionable language at times, and does have the sad topic of death and loss.

4418076,5,B004LWZWA6,"It's not often that a movie exceeds any negative expectations you have for it. That holds more true when a movie is marketed as a feel good movie that seems so saccharine sweet you're afraid you'll go into a diabetic coma should you watch it. Those were the feelings I had when I heard just the title of the film WE BOUGHT A ZOO. When I saw the trailer for it I felt it had to be as bad as I expected. What a rude awakening I had when I finally watched the movie. It's fantastic.

Matt Damon stars as Ben Mee, a journalist who spends most of his career traveling to exotic locations and facing danger. But nothing has prepared him for the death of his wife and being alone with his two children. The same holds true for dealing with where they live, a location where everything he sees reminds him of his wife and his loss.

Son Dylan (Colin Ford) has had the most difficulty dealing with the loss. He's in trouble non-stop at school where they're concerned about the themes of his art work (severed heads and gore) and where he lashes out by breaking rules. When he has his third strike, he's expelled and a new school needs to be located.

Dylan's sister Rosie (Maggie Elizabeth Jones) is the adorable one. She's the most uplifting thing this family has to offer. She never dwells on the loss of her mother and helps Ben to hold the family together be it talks the two have or packing lunches for the next day.

With all that's going on Ben decides he and the children need a change. They need a different house, a different location and something new in their lives. He quits his job and begins house hunting. When he and Rosie find the ideal house they discover there's a hitch...the house is part of a zoo in need of much repair. But he sees this as a challenge and something to do so they buy the zoo.

Some things go as expected with Dylan seeing this as unfavorable and thinking more of him than the family. Ben shows the usual frustrations with dealing with a teen filled with angst as well as a new job. But with the help of the staff he inherits they work toward the goal of having the zoo ready for inspection and opening come June.

Heading that staff is Kelly Foster (Scarlett Johansson). With more knowledge than most she has kept the place running and taken care of the animals while a suitable buyer was sought. Along with her are several staff members, most notably Peter MacReady (Angus Macfadyen) as a zoo designer with a grudge against the zoo inspector who can determine if they are permitted to open or not.

The movie follows the ups and downs of trying to keep the zoo afloat and remade in time to meet their deadline for repairs suggested by the inspector. Money is tight and it seems they might not only have little time but little cash to accomplish their goal. But the film doesn't focus solely on this problem. At the heart of the film is the emotional turmoil going on in this family, as much with Ben as with Dylan. And as they try and cope with their own problem, the staff gets involved as well.

This is a film about people trying to rise above the worst situation they can possibly imagine. It's about people being brought together for a reason even if they aren't aware that fate has driven them into each other's arms. It's about love and the meaning of it all and about loss roped in the middle of that love.

The movie is never boring and never overly sentimental, a trap that many movies with these themes tend to fall into. Instead it deals with the problems the family faces as well as the predicaments they find themselves in while rebuilding the zoo.

The acting is fantastic doing what the best of actors do: make you believe that they are the character and not an actor playing a role. Everyone from Damon on down turns in a performance you can believe.

The movie is supposed to be based on a true story and if so then I'm hoping the zoo is still up and running. Perhaps the romance in the picture isn't real but we can hope so. And in the end we can hope that Ben Mee and his family are at peace and loving life again while we have the chance to share in their story and their triumph with this film.",1336953600,,4149,4.313222079589217

4418165,5,B004LWZWA6,"This movie is an excellent story about a family recovering from the loss of the most important woman in their lives. It is whimsical, quirky, and although often sappy it is very inspiring. As a sentimental romantic type guy I guess I can see how I might be biased. But this whole movie is great. The acting is believable all around. The bad reviews are from viewers who isolate one thing such as ""colorful language"" and then spend the rest of the time watching to movie looking for flaws. It's funny and largely moving. I don't care that it was predictable and that the ending was slightly ridiculous. The message is clear from the best scene in the movie when Matt Damon tells his son, ""Sometimes all you need is 20 seconds of courage and I promise something great will come of it."" That's the whole point of the movie. Anyone who doesn't take that message away with them after watching it is shallow and has little to no heart.

The whole 14 year-old to 12-year old romance thing is a touch odd I will admit. The ""disturbing"" artwork from the son and his troubled relationship with his Dad are one of the key components of the film. As someone who lost his Dad at a young age I remember acting out against my Mom and feeling depressed. I imagine if I was a great artist I would also be drawing dark and gory images. Some people have complained that Matt Damon wasn't being a good Dad throughout the film. Again I'd like to point out that a good story has a protagonist (Matt Damon) and conflict (money, loss, troubled relationship with son) and then resolution (if I need to explain this you have no business watching movies).]

Bottom line: Great movie. All of the negative reviews are from people who refuse to accept that humans are flawed and that times of adversity make or break a family. Get over the occasional colorful language. Also the cinematography is beautiful.",1336521600,,1877,4.533923303834809

4418168,4,B004LWZWA6,"Somewhat surprised by how good this was, having only noticed Damon's name before renting it, but had I seen Crowe's I'd have known it would be solid. He's getting to be a fine director, more so each film. Damon is likewise strong here, as always, and the script is quite intelligent and not as manipulative as the usual films in this kid/adult genre.

The weak point is Johanssen, who it seems is not as good an actress as she is toothsome. Her scenes her are the lowlights and sometimes it seems that her idea of acting is giving the cutest look at the right moment. When next to a fully immersed actor like Damon, or even both of the kids here (who are great, especially the girl), Scarlett falls short. But the mature and bright script carries her along without too much trouble, as does Damon. He makes this work even when his co-star does not.

But the movie is entertaining and so is the blu-ray; a fine package with many good extras including a full-length doc and plenty of interviews and stories on Mee in real life, etc. Plus a very fine transfer.

All in all, worth watching especially for one-parent families, though your kids may want a zoo after seeing it!",1336348800,,1170,4.483568075117371

4418232,4,B004LWZWA6,"This is a soulful family film centered on a widowed father (Matt Damon) and his 2 kids, who buy a small and troubled local zoo in an attempt to make a fresh start. Scarlett Johannson stars as head zookeeper, with a humorous supporting cast in roles as zoo employees. They all must pull together to get the zoo ready for a new grand opening, and face many challenges. Along the way, Damon reconnects with his difficult teenage son, and comes to terms with his grief.

It's a sober film in many ways, although the animals and the young daughter provide some comic relief. I watched it with a 7 year old and 2 five year olds, and the 7 year old was engaged throughout, but the 5 year olds got bored with the more dramatic scenes. There is also some explicit language, including the young daughter calling a zoo inspector a dick. So between that and the adult drama, I'd say it's probably best suited for kids 7 and up or so. My only other complaint is that Johansson's and Damon's characters are supposed to be falling for each other, but unfortunately don't seem to have much chemistry, although otherwise they put in solid performances. Overall this is a warm-hearted film with some much-appreciated depth in the family genre.",1336262400,,1225,4.593607305936073

It is based on a similar real life story involving a man with the same name, Benjamin Mee but the real Benjamin Mee is British and the zoo is named Dartmoor Zoological Park in Devon, England. For the movie the location was moved to California but that, along with the other changes, really presents no interference with the enjoyment of the movie.

We were not sure what to expect when we started the movie but quickly discovered that we were both getting involved with the movie and enjoying its progress.

4418238,3,B004LWZWA6,"'We bought a zoo' started out interesting enough, but from the onset some of the quirkiness (such as the lasagna woman) made it difficult to tell what direction this film was going.  Matt Damon did a good job in the lead, but for a family film about a zoo, the film tended to get a little to mired in mopey, teary-eyed ruminations (and I think I had enough of Damon crying when I sat through 'Good Will Hunting.)  The animals, and the little girl actor, were both great for families watching this, but the profanity, as well as some of the emotionally-exhausting yelling sequences between father and son were probably geared for slightly older viewers.  As well, so many of the laptop-picture-crying sequences seemed like they could have been trimmed a tad, with more focus given to the animals.

The film was fun, yet a little forced and at times contrived (such as Damon making the sweatshirt-discover at just the right time, etc.)  Ideal family film for older childred.  Too heavy with emotionally-draining dialog and not enough monkeys.",1336089600,,1040,4.814606741573034

4418323,4,B004LWZWA6,"This is a pleasant, gentle, family friendly film (based on a true life story) that like so many other modern movies runs just a little longer than it should. It's got several false climaxes that push it over the two hour mark and would have played better at about 100 minutes in my opinion. That being said it's still a very good movie that children and adults of all ages will enjoy I think. It's an old fashioned film with no sex, violence or gross out humor, only a few minor vulgarities most likely inserted to make it a PG rather than G rated film.  Except for children's animation G rated films are considered box office poison nowadays, just too squeaky clean for teenagers you understand. There is an alternate family friendly audio track accessed from the ""Setup"" menu that apparently replaces those few vulgarities with TV network approved alternatives if you want to shield delicate ears from real world lingo. Either way there is nothing to be embarrassed about for mixed audience viewing. I enjoyed it a lot! DVD quality is fine.",1335916800,,1042,4.693989071038251
4418324,5,B004LWZWA6,"To be honest, I haven't been impressed with the movies Matt Damon has been in for quite awhile, but this movie put him right back at the top for me.  I loved it.  Yes, the movie was about grief over losing a wife and mother, but I felt it didn't drown the movie by any means.  For those, like me, who have experienced tremendous loss, we can identify with how this family wants to move forward, and that it takes baby steps.

I found this story very believable with just the right amount of sweet comedy - made me laugh out loud a couple of times.  If the little girl upstaged Matt Damon (taken from a few reviews), it's because kids usually do!  I, too, appreciated that this didn't become a romantic story, which would've taken away from the love for the zoo and the animals.  Scarlett Johannson and all the supporting actors were great!

4418432,3,B004LWZWA6,"I went into We Bought a Zoo expecting a fun, feel-good family comedy. That's exactly what I got with the film starring Matt Damon as Benjamin Mee, a man who moves with his two children to a house that happens to be attached to a zoo. The film is based on a true story of the real Benjamin Mee, though the film contains many differences from the real story.

The film's version of Benjamin is a widower with two children. Not sure what to do after the passing of his wife, dealing with his son getting into trouble, and always seeking an adventure, Benjamin decides to relocate the family and start anew. A house hunting montage soon rolls by which ends with Benjamin and daughter Rosie (Maggie Elizabeth Jones) stumbling upon a closed zoo and of course we assume what happens next judging from the film's title. I can't really imagine one day just saying ""hey, why not buy a zoo?!""

Benjamin appears to handle the whole situation with a worry-free attitude, but really behind his happy-go-lucky facade hides a hurt man hiding his sadness through the thrill of adventure and risk. Though the zoo was meant to be a means for Benjamin to start fresh with the family, it winds up creating financial and familial distress. Being a family-oriented drama, the film is relatively tame when it comes to the more dramatic moments. The film puts more effort into the laughs, tear-jerking moments, and the cuteness factor.

The movie does do a great job in the aforementioned areas though. There is some nice comic relief specifically from Thomas Haden Church as Benjamin's brother Duncan, and John Michael Higgins as the absurdly silly an unrealistic albeit hilarious zoo inspector. There are some fun scenes involving the animals as well, including one with Bejnamin and an escaped bear. I'm not sure if it was CGI, animatronics, or something else but that scene was pulled off very impressively and was one of the more profound moments in the film.

I also really enjoyed the cast. Matt Damon is always superb, whether kicking butt as a rogue CIA operative or an adventure-seeking widower, he always brings credibility to his roles. All of the zoo employees were great as well, though I was let down that Patrick Fugit didn't have a bigger role (he really needs more mainstream roles). I also have to mention that Elle Fanning is starting to shine and no longer should she just be known as Dakota's sister - with Super 8 and now this, she's only getting better. Though the script was a little bit cheese in some areas, the great cast makes up for it.

While I realize the intended audience and that this is meant to be a nice feel-good family film, I felt there was a lot of room for more realistic life lessons which here were a bit sacrificed for audience approval. Downplayed family drama, a few moments with drippy dialog, and a not-so-credible love angle between Benjamin and zoo attendant Kelly (Scarlett Johansson) (I just think it didn't make much sense as the characters didn't seem to have a bond other than them both being lonely) gave it a little too much predictability and Hollywood conveniences. Nonetheless, We Bought a Zoo is still a fun and well crafted film that the family can enjoy a have a good time with.

4418481,4,B004LWZWA6,"This is a pretty solid if not fairly predictably uplifting tale of a recently-widowed writer taking a 180 degree turn and buying a zoo. Based on the true story of Benjamin Mee, an English writer who bought an actual zoo in Southwest England, the script pulls all the right punches for delivering an entertaining family drama that has a little something for everyone.

From the adorably cute daughter to the grumpy teenage son and the Dad who needs to move on from Mom's death, the script almost writes itself with character arcs all revolving around the family moving to the country side and living with the animals. But it's very well done - an excellent cast holds it together and the dialog is believable enough to keep the audience engaged and routing for the zoo's success. My only question was why the zoo was moved from its real life location in England to a fictional rural area outside Los Angeles - some of the quirky zookeeper characters would probably have worked more effectively if it had stayed in the UK.

I've read some comments on both here and IMDB that the profanity is too much much for a family film - personally I didn't think there was anything that was not family oriented but then again I don't have kids! Though there is also a revealing fact about the Easter bunny that you may not want your children to know. Overall, it was much more entertaining than I expected and definitely a little different.",1335052800,,1427,4.6141732283464565

4418484,4,B004LWZWA6,"As a writer who specializes in adventure, Benjamin Mee (played by Matt Damon) has pretty much been there, done that, and gotten the T-Shirt from just about every venue imaginable.  When his wife passes away after an illness (we are led to believe that it might have been cancer), Benjamin mentally ""checks out"" from life.  The loss is keenly felt by his son (Colin Ford) and daughter (Maggie Elizabeth Jones).  Ben quits his job, his son gets expelled from school, and the scene is set for the most improbable adventure of all . . . life.

Benjamin leaves everything behind and winds up purchasing a new house with an interesting stipulation: he must also take on the administration and upkeep of the zoo that is located on the property!  Throw in a skeleton crew of loyal staff, a runaway bear, an aging tiger, and more wildlife than you can shake a stick at, and you have the makings of the ultimate adventure.  Is Benjamin up to the challenge?  Or has the adventure specialist finally met his match?

Touted by Lou Lumenick as ""a delightful surprise of a family movie,"" I would have to cautiously agree.  There are some issues with language, which can be dealt with by selecting the Family-Friendly Audio Track (in English only).  There are a couple of kissing scenes, but there are no hot and heavy groping sessions at all.  There is a sort of clubhouse where the staff meets to unwind, so alcohol and tobacco are prevalent as well.

Other special features of the DVD include:  Audio in Dolby Digital 5.1, Spanish, and French languages as well as Descriptive Audio and a Commentary with Director Cameron Crowe, Actor J.B. Smoove, and Editor Mark Livelsi; and Subtitles for the Deaf and Hearing Impaired and in Spanish.

WE BOUGHT A ZOO is loosely based upon the real-life story of the Dartmoor Zoological Park located in Dartmoor, Deveon, England, which was forced to close in 2006, and reopened under the Mee family in 2007.  The film was nominated for Best Live Action Family Film by the Phoenix Film Critics Society Awards, and for Best Original Song by the Satellite Awards.  Not only did Cameron Crowe direct the film, he was the lyricist for the song in question.

Throughout the film, the viewer will be bombarded with the positive message, ""Bad things happen.  You just keep going.""  Benjamin Mee and his family continue to do so, despite an evil Zoo inspector, a traitor in their midst, and a financial mess that would keep Bill Gates up at night.  I would give this film 4.5 out of 5 stars, keeping in mind the issues mentioned above.  And don't forget to check out their website -

Benjamin Mee (Matt Damon) has come to a crossroads in life. His wife recently died, and he's forced quickly into raising his son, Dylan (14-years-old) and daughter Rosie (7-year-old) as a single dad. Rosie seems to be adjusting fine, but Dylan is another story.
Benjamin is called to the school because Dylan has attempted to steal the cashbox. When he arrives he's confronted by the principal, that this is Dylan's third strike, and he is suspended.
Benjamin, who works for a newspaper, tries to talk his editor into a storyline where he can spend more time with his kids. The editor says no, so he quits.
Widowed, and unemployed he sets out to find a new house, in a different area to get a new start for he and the kids.
Benjamin winds up buying an old property with a run-down zoo connected. With it he inherits the zoo staff led by the spunky Kelly Foster (Scarlett Johansson). She's glad someone has taken on the property but has mixed emotions about Benjamin, since he has no zoo experience.
Soon the reality sets in, and the new owner finds he's gone through all of his savings and is broke.
Benjamin finds his wife left him an investment account with a stipulation attached ""use the money wisely while listening to your heart."" His older brother Thomas, who is an accountant, says for him to cut his losses and move on.

One might say that this film didn't make the best use of the talents of Matt Damon and Scarlett Johansson, but I think it's great when stars such as these are willing to step of their ladder of fame to do a family film.

I just loved this film and highly recommend it!",1334620800,,474,4.175824175824176
4418601,1,B004LWZWA6,"I thought the premise of the movie might be interesting, so we actually went to a video store to rent this (where typically we use the library to see years older movies).  I can't believe I wasted the three dollars on this.

First, this is NOT a family film.  The language is inappropriate, the lack of respect for adults astounding, and the promotion of selfishness incredible.  The artwork Gee's son drew was graphically violent and my children were covering their eyes.  The threats made by the Scotsman were uncalled for.

Secondly, the characters and scenes were completely unbelievable.  A five-year old girl who just lost her mother to cancer would not be Little Miss Sunshine (and then turn around and call the inspector a 'dick' to his face at the end). The wife of a man like this wouldn't hide $84K for a rainy day, and hide the evidence of it in the pocket of a sweatshirt, somewhere.  There's no way they would haul 300lb grandmothers over a tree to get them in the zoo like that - HUGE insurance liabilities, that!  The young boy was horrible: he screamed at adults, was a thief, a liar, and even when the father told him to 'think about someone other than himself' he was screaming ""ME, ME.""  The behavior went WAY beyond just grief... there were basics missing, there.

Scarlett J... is there a reason Hollywood has to settle for this?  There are beautiful, talented, tasteful, passionate actresses out there.  This woman is not one of them - I don't understand the appeal.  Scarlett hasn't got what it takes.  She spent the entirety of the movie making cow eyes at Matt Damon, only stirring herself to be the 'commanding zookeeper' at random moments throughout the movie.  Either she's needy or strong, but make up your mind what characterization you wish to portray.

Matt Damon was THE only redeeming part of the movie, and his character was so mired in a twisted mix of loss, desperation, frustration, and a complete sense of overwhelming disbelief that the poor actor had a hard time holding both the character and the movie together.  And Lord, please smite the person who was in charge of Matt's hair and wardrobe.  We've come a LONG way from Jason Bourne, baby.  But apparently Hollywood wants us to know that when one becomes a parent, they loose all sense of taste and class, capable of only choosing cable knit sweaters and corduroy.

The only part of the movie that stood out as intriguing was Lilly, whose situation is never explained, whose guardianship I didn't understand, and while I'm all for homeschool themes threading their way into film, I never quite understood who was supervising her education or when there was time for it.  But the obvious contrast between Dylan (public schooled teen with emotional and behavioral issues, a lack of ability to relate to other age groups and situations, and a lack of direction) compared to Lilly (articulate, curious, creative, friendly, polite, and helpful) was amusing... and also seen in ""A Dolphin Tale"" with Hazel vs. Sawyer.  Score one point for that, but too many other things detracted to make it count.

Part of this was the father's motivations for buying the zoo, and many of the decisions he makes throughout the movie seem so bizarre and impulsive. It's explained at the end in a very appealing way.
The mother has passed away from some unexplained sickness which moves most of the elements in the story. I liked how even though she was gone, sometimes the father would see her, at a coffee shop, or in other mundane setting. I remember when my mother died I would often plan to give her a call or wonder what she would say when I told about something funny that happened at work... and then I'd remember she was gone. I got this feeling from the movie, whenever the mother would be introduced in these settings without any special acknowledgement it gave me that sort of feeling.

The first is either more of docu-drama that is far too technical and biographical to be really entertaining, and the second option is an uplifting drama that could inspire its viewer to betterment. This movie is the latter.

He has been on a plane that went straight into the heart of a hurricane, interviewed world leaders in war-torn countries but nothing could prepare Benjamin Mee (Matt Damon) for the loss of his beloved wife and the responsibility of raising his two children without Katherine at his side. A year ago the family of four was a happy, typical American family; six months ago they said good-bye to a wife and mother. Now, Benjamin is tired of sympathy. He cannot stomach the attentions he or his children are getting from people who are merely feeling pity for them. His brother, Duncan (Thomas Hayden Church) encourages Benjamin to get out more and ""interact"" with people but when his fourteen-year-old son (Colin Ford) gets expelled from school after his fourth offense, Benjamin sees that something needs to change. With a fresh start in mind, he and his precocious seven-year-old daughter, Rosie (Maggie Elizabeth Jones) begin looking at new properties until he finds one that is exactly what his family needs - only problem is, the backyard is literally a zoo!

Dylan is angry about the move and thinks his adventurer dad is crazy to buy a zoo while young Rosie finds happiness and a place where she can feel at home - and best of all, his daughter is laughing again. The Mee's find the zoo staff knowledgeable and ready to help them along as they learn everything about zoo-keeping. Head zookeeper Kelly (Scarlett Johansson) befriends the family and is encouraged to see Benjamin has a genuine heart to make the zoo a success while her shy cousin Lily (Elle Fanning) attempts to be friends with Dylan. Even with minor progress behind them, hardships still find Benjamin. Unless the family can band together, their livelihood will be sorely tested.

Seeing this movie when I did almost didn't happen because the copy I had reserved wasn't coming in but I nabbed one elsewhere and can only say how glad I am to have seen it! There is a lot to be admired in this film regardless of a premise that seems mediocre and not all that ""interesting"" when compared to some of the blockbusters that are clamoring for ""first place"" and our attention. One of the first things I was most impressed with was the script - it is not only funny (more on that later) but also tugs on our heartstrings in a way that still leaves us with a smile at the end result. All of the dialogue - or the majority of it, is written with a family grieving in mind, and that is one of its strengths. The directing is equally dynamic. There are multiple scenes that I loved the set-up of; the simplicity in them is not too sappy but yet has a beautiful familiarity to them - scenes that are reminiscent of realistic life. It is this quality that so endears the film, and connects with its audience.

What helps this along to an extreme that is beautifully portrayed is the acting. Damon is a first-rate versatile actor, and he does not disappoint in this role. Seeing him play a father is one of the best roles he's had to date - the way he relates to his on-screen children is precious. Then there are the child actors; Colin does an admirable job but it is young Maggie who steals every single frame she is in. I cannot tell you what a doll she was in this role, how sweet, sassy and spot-on perfect she is. You just have to experience it for yourself. She is like a miniature adult who is still an innocent in the best sense of the word. (Many of you may also remember her from the re-make of ""Footloose."") Although I don't clamor to see everything Johansson is in, she is cute in the role and her chemistry with Damon is memorable albeit one made of more tender emotions than ""sparks"" of romance. (It was also a pleasant surprise to see one of the rotating ""squints"" from ""Bones"" in a supporting role.)

""We Bought a Zoo"" is the surprise movie of the year at my house (yes, I am aware it is only April). My whole family found it precious, and something we all got a chuckle out of. Its true story working idea makes it more endearing than usual but the cast is what pulls it all together. How everything comes together at the end may be a bit of a clich but for the most part, the movie does not fall into those sorts of traps. Instead it is a pleasant family drama with an ending that doesn't stop where you think it will. Some may find fault with how it does end because it is more of a what-will-be, than has-been but I took it in stride and accepted it as a promise of a brighter future for a family, healing from grief in a healthy way - and its ending is one you can write yourself. Unless, you have an adverse reaction to zoo animals, see this one. It's not at all what you might think, definitely a five-star keeper.",1334102400,5,5015,4.446739130434783
4418640,4,B004LWZWA6,"Recently saw this family friendly movie and enjoyed it.  If you have read Benjamin Mee's book WE BOUGHT A ZOO you may be disappointed at the ""hollywood spin"".  Any similarity between the book and the movie basically ends with the title.

In the book Mee's father died and HIS MOTHER bought the Dartmoor Zoo (located in the UK not California) using funds received from the sale of her home in Surrey. Mee's wife Katherine was alive at the time of the purchase and moved to the zoo with their two children Milo age six (hardly the trouble teen, Dylan, as portrayed in the movie) and Ella age four (a seven year old named Rosie in the movie).  His brother, portrayed in the movie by Thomas Hayden Church is not Mee's only sibling nor was he an unwilling participant in the venture, but a willing accomplice.  Also, the Benjamin Mee in the book does not come across as the devoted, loving husband and father but as a rather selfish ""I want what I want"" personality who willingly uproots his family again and again to pursue his dreams.

Those are just a few of the more glaring differences between book and ""true story"" movie.  These discrepancies do not detract from the movies overall appeal (particularly if you have not read the book).  As I mentioned, the movie is as warm and gooey as a hot fudge sundae and provides a great viewing experience for the entire family.  Particularly enchanting is Maggie Elizabeth Jones who plays little Rosie.  She is truly a delight to watch as she attempts to assume the roll of woman of the house.  Another performance that tickled my funny bone was that of MacCready the volatile zoo carpenter as played by Angus Macfadyen a very talented and, in my opinion, underrated actor who has portrayed everyone from Robert the Bruce in Braveheart to Richard Burton and even did a turn as Sandra Bullocks fianc in Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood.

While the book provides the reader with a more in depth look at Mee, the man, and the intricate problems involved the running of a zoo the movie has a more nostalgic tone as we watch a heartbroken Matt Damon cope with the loss of his wife and attempts to raise two children while mastering a domain consisting of over 200 exotic animals.

The extras, on the other hand are worth the price of admission. The true story of Benjamin Mee has a terrific interview with the subject (though I'm still wondering where the money came from in this whole operation), and the nearly 90-minute documentary ""We Shot a Zoo"" has fantastic interviews with the animal trainers, awesome close ups of all the animals, more of the backstory, and satisfies completely as it's own self-contained documentary. The story always should have just been a documentary - it had enough going for it without being turned into schmaltz. But Crowe's musical tastes and a mostly terrific cast kept it watchable.

Matt Damon delivers as a father struggling with raising two children by himself, Scarlett Johansson actually does a good bit of acting in this one vs. just looking good for the camera (which she does with no problem), and the two children might be our next generation of child stars.  I thought the first 15 minutes or so of the movie started off slow, but the opening scenes are necessary to set the stage for the remainder of the story and it all comes together.

Dylan Mee (Colin Ford) is a troubled 14 year old son who just got kicked out of his school for being a discipline problem. They are all suffering from forms of depression because of the recent death of their mother, Benjamin's cherished wife.

Everything in their daily lives reminds them of their lost loved one and they can't seem to get over the memories of this lost wonderful wife and mother. Benjamin loses his job and they start looking for a new home to force some separation from all of the memories and begin a fresh start. They wind up buying a broken down zoo full of exotic animals and some disgruntled employees. What follows is a story of love and relationships that will warm your heart....

This is a wonderful story and the acting is top notch. The entire cast performs well but in my opinion the young daughter is just adorable. This is a movie that is about the sadness of loss and the closeness of family. Then you must start the tasks of recovery, rebuilding your life and surviving happily after a tragic event. The world goes on with or without you, and you should live life to the fullest.

Checklist:
Modeled after Zookeeper and Mr. Popper's Penguins.
Have single parent (typically a male because they are usually the most incompetent) with angry, dispirited teen (usually a female, but switched for this go around) and a younger and cute with no issues sibling. Mother is dead but we will see her as a memory displayed as if in a commercial. Lots of cute animals acting more like household pets than wild animals - very educational. Animals don't really die they just change into an ad graphic. Staff that always include love interests for whomever needs one and a couple of bizarre behaving staff for comedic purposes.
Predictable feel good fantasy ending.

Buy a zoo and if something can go wrong it will go wrong, but the outcome will be better. Happy-happy, fun-fun, animals-animals. Yes, love too.

Expect happy ending, expect good will, expect love and...well, enjoy it, it's a film like Disney used to make. The animals are fun to watch, even the bonus footage. Matt Damon leads a fine cast that makes the adventure fun. And the adorable little daughter Rosie (Maggie Elizabeth Jones) delivers a performance as good as young Drew Barrymore in ET. And you get Scarlett Johansson if you want hot instead of cute. The main cast is beautiful (I'm assuming ladies will drool over the males).

Yes it gets a bit sappy at times, but so doe life. But in the end if you let yourself go with the flow of this true story based on Benjamin Mee's memoir you will end up feeling the pleasure of hugs again. Aline Brosh McKenna joined director Cameron Crowe in adapting the book as a screenplay and it works.

Benjamin Mee (Matt Damon) has recently lost his wife to cancer. Always a lover of adventure as in the journalistic form, he sees the newspaper world crumbling and his life of grieving overbearing and in a bid to start his life over, and against the advice of his older brother Duncan (Thomas Haden Church) he follows a new realtor (J.B. Smoove) with his young daughter Rosie (an absolutely captivating Maggie Elizabeth Jones) and purchases a large house that has a zoo. Benjamin and Rosie are delighted, but his young frustrated and failing student son Dylan (Colin Ford) is not happy about it. The zoo is need of renovation and Benjamin sets about the work with the head keeper, Kelly (Scarlett Johansson), and the rest of the zoo staff - MacCready (Angus MacFadyen), Robin (Patrick Fugit), Lily (Elle Fanning). But, the zoo soon runs into financial trouble. The staff must get the zoo back to it's former glory, pass a zoo inspection, and get it back open to the public.

In addition to the challenges of the new adventure of owning a zoo, Benjamin must face the reality that his deceased wife is to remain only a sweet memory, must deal with Dylan's anti-social behavior and budding awakening to girls in Lily, must deal with the nauseating inspector Walter Ferris (John Michael Higgins), and gradually become at one with his zoo animals and that responsibility as well as his attraction to Kelly who gives him advice on how to relate to his sullen son Dylan (""The secret to talking is listening').  How it all works out is expected but endearing.

We Bought a Zoo is based on the memoirs of Benjamin Mee, who, after the death of his wife, purchased a struggling zoo and moved his family onto the property in hopes of reopening the facility to the public. With Crowe behind the camera and working decidedly within his wheelhouse of character-driven drama, as well as a cast that included Matt Damon, Scarlett Johansson, Thomas Haden Church, and more, I thought Zoo might find itself in Oscar contention. Unfortunately, while I found the performances noteworthy and the film overall pleasant, I also felt it was too predictable and overly sentimental, with sweet spots that weren't entirely earned.

I could not disagree more with the ""professional"" reviewers associated with print/online newspapers & magazines who gave this movie one or two stars and ranted about how it was not for kids.  Kid friendly movies are very hard to come by and to bash this one as such is not right.

This movie is a great family movie, BUT you have to know your children and what they can handle.  Yes, there are some possibly scary/disturbing images drawn by the son, which are shown several times.  I wish the movie didn't have them, or at least didn't make them so graphic, and the movie would have worked just fine without them.  It does have its place in the movie and the family works through it.  (This caused me to give the movie four stars instead of five, it just wasn't necessary) There is also some language that parents may be concerned about. H*.l a few times, S--t three to six times, B.S. once or twice & *$$ or A-ho once or twice.  HOWEVER, I just heard that the DVD will feature a family friendly audio track that can be selected in the menu.  This will reduce the above instances greatly changing a few S--ts to Shoot and possibly eliminating them alltogether.  This does not address the disturbing images though, so keep that in mind.

I looked forward to watching this because it looked good - it had a good cast, animals, and some silliness to it. I mean, who buys a zoo? Well, apparently Benjamin Mee. In real life. After watching I wasn't surprised it was based on a true story. With an element of you can't make this stuff up mixed with honest emotional turmoil that the audience can identify with, it pulls at your heart strings and draws you in.

At the start you learn that Benjamin was a journalist that went all over the world, even interviewing threatening dictators. He abruptly switches to one of the most difficult jobs of all - a single dad. We learn that his wife passed away several months before but without a lot of detail. We assumed it was cancer that took her. One thing is very clear, the family is hurting in their grief and they do not have it all pulled together. They all attempt to cope with their loss in very different ways, but it is clear that Benjamin and his oldest child, Dylan, are struggling the most. I was surprised at how well his daughter was handling everything, though it seemed she had an easier time communicating her feelings to her father.

I was disappointed in Dylan's school as it appeared they did little to try and help him deal with his feelings. His emotions were coming out in his artwork and said loud and clear that he was full of hurt. He acted out in other ways too, such as stealing, which ends up getting him expelled from school. This coupled with Benjamin's difficulty with going anywhere that reminded him of Lily, his dead wife, pushed him to look for a new place to live.

And that some place turned out to be a zoo. Some of the logistics of how and why escaped me, but it was a new start for their family. The little girl loved it, the older boy hated it. Benjamin was convinced they needed this and tried to make it work so they could reopen the zoo in July.

There were a lot of things that happened along that path that challenged the family emotionally and financially. One issue being what to do about an elder tiger that refused to take his medicine. He showed signs of suffering and the staff urged Benjamin to give the vet the okay to put him out of his misery. Benjamin struggled with this believing the tiger would get better. I felt he was connecting the tiger to his wife and this made it hard to let go.

As they prepared for inspection to see if they could reopen, Benjanin learned that he can't run from his feelings. He still missed his wife and his children still missed their mother. But, they could still move on in their lives.  I really enjoyed this film. I felt drawn in and rode the emotional roller coaster along with them. I literally had to fight myself not to cry several times. Only distractions from the movie helped!

Since we received a promotional review copy and not the fully released DVD, I'm not sure if the extra features will all be the same. But, I really enjoyed the bonus feature about the animal trainers. It was fascinating to learn about how they work with the animals in movies and the thought that goes into actions they have them perform. For example, having the bear twist his head gives him character as he is staring down at Benjamin.  I also learned that most retired trained animals end up living the rest of their days with their trainers.

I honestly loved this movie! It was authentic and honest in its portrayal of the modern family dealing with intense grief... even if we all can't buy a zoo to help us escape.",1332633600,,3523,4.397849462365591

4418932,3,B004LWZWA6,"The 411 by Maria:

I was eager to see this because it starred Matt Damon and an adorable little actress Maggie Elizabeth Jones whose face just lights up the screen. Love her.

Matt Damon is a widow who is raising his children alone and doing a decent job of getting them where they need to go but not dealing with the death of their mother and how it effects them, especially his preteen Dylan. Believing that a fresh start would be right for his family he moves them to a house that comes with its very own zoo animals and staff.

With some cute moments, We Brought A Zoo shows a touch of reality. As a child who lost her mom and raised by a father, this is exactly how most men deal with loss. The scene of him and his little daughter going through his wives clothes and deciding what to keep just about made me lose it. I did that! While a deep emotional subject, I didn't feel the movie to be emotional. Damon does a great job playing a very, good looking dad doing the best he can, but even while he watched the movies of his wife with the kids, the emotion was kept at a family friendly level.

While there were moments in the movie that dragged more than others, I appreciated this family friendly movie although we were a bit confused at times (the ending) and flabbergasted at others like who was financing the zoo before Matt Damon's character came along, who paid for the staff and why did they help all those people climb over trees to get to the zoo. Maybe a rain date would have been better considering the liability on someone getting hurt. Although we thought it would be on as background noise while we worked, we closed our computer's 15 minutes in and watched all of it.

Great performance by Colin Ford who plays Dylan, Damon's son. Very good looking kid with a bright future and little Maggie Elizabeth Jones could just be standing there without a script and I would watch.",1332028800,,1894,4.354107648725212
4418933,5,B004LWZWA6,"I can't think of a Matt Damon movie I haven't liked.

Saw Matt Damon on some talk shows pitching this film.  I was not at all impressed.  The movie appeared silly, juvenile.  I've since seen the film and it is now a favorite of mine.  This is not a kids movie, although the whole family will like it. This is not a silly movie about cute, intelligent animals.  It is an emotional story about humanity, family and remembrance, much like ""Field of Dreams"".  Maybe everything in the film is predicable to some folks, but I was very touched by the movie.  Must admit I shed a few tears.  Much better movie than I expected.

I need to trust Matt Damon.",1331337600,,647,4.316666666666666

4418938,5,B004LWZWA6,"The sound of the plot sounds like a complete kids movie (and the audience of the showing I attended would prove that claim), but there is more to this film than meets the eye. Director Cameron Crowe (one of my favorites) co-writes a wonderful screenplay full of engaging, fun characters, based on the true life story of Benjamin Mee, a man who decided to purchase a run-down zoo, fix it up, and re-open it. Matt Damon, Colin Ford (who they did a wonderful job as casting as Damon's son as he looks just like a younger version of Damon), and Elle Fanning are the stars of this film, and while the animals and kids may seem like the focus, it is the relationships and life issues that take center stage. The film has that particular heartwarming magic that is infused in nearly all of Crowe's films, which is so appealing to me; it also features one of the best music scores of the year by Jonsi (of Sigur Ros). I don't know if this is exactly for kids 'cause there are lots of grown-up, dramatic moments (and they might get bored), but it's a film I'd see over and over.",1328572800,19,1069,4.35
4418939,4,B004LWZWA6,"""Life is an adventure"". A clich if ever there was one. But for some people, it just so happens to be true. And Matt Damon is portraying one such person in this latest family effort from acclaimed writer/director Cameron Crowe.

  Benjamin Mee (Matt Damon) is an adventure columnist for a struggling newspaper, if that's not redundant, and father of two children. His wife recently passed away due to illness leaving him to raise those children on his own. His daughter Rosie (played by Maggie Elizabeth Jones) is regularly losing sleep thanks to the hard-partying college students in the house next door. His son Dylan (played by Colin Ford) is a fourteen year-old artist who's developed a taste for the macabre of late and who has recently been expelled from school. Rather than keep his job at the paper, which he would've held onto despite their financial problems thanks to his editor's sympathy, Mee decides to sell his home and find more picturesque surroundings for him and his family. After rejecting several houses for being dull or dime-a-dozen, they find a home situated on the grounds of a struggling zoo and embark on their greatest adventure yet.

  It's cutesy, I'm not denying that. But while Zookeeper had nothing else going for it, this is entertaining and interesting and I enjoyed it very much thanks to Crowe's screenplay and direction, a typically interesting effort from Damon and an excellent supporting cast in Elle Fanning, Thomas Hayden Church and Scarlett Johansson.",1328486400,,1494,5.004032258064516
4419079,5,B004LWZWA6,"I could go on and on about the agnst that the family goes though is life changing, blah blah blah. But I LOVE this movie.

Buy it, watch it, love it, put it back in, watch it again, love it again, and when the family goes to bed, pop it in one more time, and......

I can't wait till it is released, cuz I'm gonna buy it! How many stars can we give it? What ever it is, I would give it more!",1328486400,3,486,3.764705882352941
4419080,3,B004LWZWA6,"It must be very disappointing for Matt Damon and Scarlett Johansson to be upstaged by a seven-year-old child (played by Maggie Elizabeth Jones), but that is exactly what happened in this Disney family movie.  I am not going to go as far as to say that I loved the film, because for me, the movie did not get interesting until we were two-thirds of the way in -- and that is just a bit too far.  The scene between Damon and his fourteen-year-old son Dylan, played by Colin Ford, is what opened up this formulaic adaptation, it just took too long to get to the good stuff.

Based on the book by Benjamin Mee, the family is in turmoil following the death of Ben's wife and the family is in desperate need of a getaway.  Not just physically, but emotionally, so when Ben and Rosie go house hunting a curious thing happens.  The perfect house is available, the only stipulation, a small zoo is also part of the package.

With no experience and very limited funds, Ben jumps in with both feet, and is able to turn the place into a home for both his family and the abandoned animals.

As I said, this film is based very loosely on a book by Benjamin Mees.  The Mee's zoo is actually located in England whereas the fictional Rosemoor Wildlife Park is portrayed to be located in California.  There are a couple of facts that are toyed with, but for a child going to see this movie, that does not matter.  The animals are adorable and Rosie will appeal to even the hardest heart.

There have been some complaints about the language used by the 7-year-old daughter, but for me that was not too big of a deal.  That is how some children talk, and to be honest, it was a funny scene.

Do I recommend it, yes, but only if you are not expecting high drama and like a little sugar coating.",1328140800,16,1773,4.3202416918429005

4419082,5,B004LWZWA6,"We Bought a Zoo is a compelling film based loosely of Benjamin Mee's hit book with the same title. The film tells the story of how the family tries to re-open a decrepit zoo as they try to move on in their lives after the loss of Benjamin's wife. While Benjamin struggles to re-open the zoo he also struggles to hold his family together.

4419084,3,B004LWZWA6,"Cameron Crow really trowels on the schmaltz in ""We Bought a Zoo"" but he does it with a sure and steady hand supported by a slew of fine performances.

Scarlett Johansson in her role as feisty zookeeper Kelly Foster is more adorably cute than I have ever seen her. Elle Fanning delivers a deceptively difficult performance as the openhearted country girl with a crush with casual-looking naturalism. Maggie Elizabeth Jones does a great job as the precocious youngest child while Matt Damon and Colin Ford are credibly prickly toward each other as father and son.

The film occasionally botches credibility with ridiculous events that even I, who have never worked with animals, responded to with big distracting ""No efin way.""

-- Like the huge shipping crate packed tight with random snakes from around the world; No efin way snakes would have been shipped that way - even if they happened to originate from the same part of the world - most, if not all, of them would have suffocated and larger ones that survived would eat the smaller ones.

-- And then right after they escape (of course, if there's a huge crate full of snakes they're going to escape) the snakes all conveniently gather in the front yard. No efin way snakes would do that.

Despite those occasional confidence-breaking faux pas, the movie over all works pretty well - for schmaltzy Holiday family fare.",1326758400,11,1373,4.825531914893617
4419085,5,B004LWZWA6,"There is an overwhelming family sentimentality to Cameron Crowe's movie ""We Bought A Zoo"".  The movie  is not all fun and games as this concerns the life altering decision for Benjamin Mee's (Matt Damon) family to forge on, put the painful memories behind them and find stability in their shaken-up world.  Writer and director Crowe (""Jerry Maguire"", ""Say Anything"") has always had the ability to dig deep in his pockets to reach the real issue in the most personal way.  He offers the feelings and situations towards the viewer which compels them to believe that this could easily happen to anyone.  In this lovely film it is definitely more about a family's grief and how the father of two children can now work through it.  Benjamin must try to re-construct his family after the major trauma of losing his wife, and his two children's mother, less than a year prior.  Moving forward after such a horrific incident could absolutely leave you with your tires stuck in the mud, but for Mee and his family, the time has to be now.

There are no easy tasks involved in moving on, especially with his son Dylan (Colin Ford, in a wonderful performance) who is scattered between his grief and anger, these keep colliding leaving him feeling insecure and unable to communicate well.  Add Duncan (Thomas Haden Church), who is Mee's outspoken and dry witted brother, and we are allotted so many comedic reliefs which counter Benjamin's decisions all of the time. Just as Ben says 'yes' to things, Duncan says 'no' in a typical brotherly fashion.  I could never forget Benjamin's small and starry-eyed daughter, Rosie (Maggie Elizabeth Jones).  She adds so much childlike whimsy and precociousness to this story and seems to have a lot of knowledge for her very young age. ""From the mouths of babes"" really applies here.

Benjamin is frustrated with his present career and all his familial issues, resulting in finding it necessary to make the colossal change to move the family to a new home.  Surprised with finding the opportunity to be taking over a once prosperous zoo on the newly acquired property, Mee realizes his family can be prosperous there also; Rosie certainly agrees. The staff is indecisive about whether another buyer of the zoo will stay and make a ""go of it"". They are educated in the many ways of animal care, are quite a diverse cast of characters, and a family in themselves who convene nightly for fun and conversation - they all know each other very well outside of their work situations.  Heading up the zoo is Kelley (Scarlett Johansson), the zookeeper who also begins interacting with Mee in a more personal regard.  Among the many others, is Patrick Fugit (""Almost Famous"").  I was happy to see Cameron Crowe using him in another of his movies, he adds a spark of personality to the whole theme along with the monkey that rides on his shoulder.  Through the whole experience of opening, then running the zoo for an anticipatory and delighted public, many conflicts in this film get resolved.  One pertinent issue is vanquished for Benjamin by grappling with an older tiger.  The relevance of it brings on a change for him in a much needed and deeper regard.  Personally, I really loved this scene with its skilled interaction.

New relationships are established; the inspector who is always there with a ""Close it down""  attitude may be seeing things differently. The people of the town are beginning to have hope in the project, getting excited and backing Benjamin's efforts.  Most important for Benjamin Mee is that his family is beginning to act as a whole and a thriving unit through the devastating loss they have suffered.  They may just be able to move forward now instead of remaining in what is past.

All of the people involved in the zoo; the handlers, animal workers, but mainly - all of them blending together with Mee's family makes for an enthusiastic movie. I think this movie is a great pick for a family picture, including lots of fun with animals, situations with the children and lives beginning to be on the upswing.",1326758400,10,4058,4.787661406025825
4419086,3,B004LWZWA6,"Matt Damon stars as a recent widower and father who decides his family needs a big change to help them deal with their grief.  He buys a run-down private zoo and, with the help of the zookeeper (Scarlett Johansson), brings it and his family back to life.

If you like Damon and Johansson, you'll like this movie.  They're not my favorites, however, so I found them a bit annoying and their characters idealized and unbelievable.  The romantic tension between them takes up most of the story, which I felt was rushing things for a man whose beloved wife died only six months earlier.  The little girl who plays the daughter is way too precocious to be believed; she never acts like a 7-year old but speaks with the wisdom and maturity of a 40-year old.  Colin Ford, on the other hand, is wonderful as the alienated teenage son. There isn't much interaction or `awwww-how-cute' moments with the animals; this story is about the people.

Since it's based on a true story, I can appreciate the heart behind it, but still, fixing up the dilapidated zoo did seem rather effortless for Damon's city-slicker character.  Although it's predictable and sentimental, the story deals sensitively with human and animal death and there were few dry eyes in my theatre.",1326153600,7,1253,4.768518518518518
