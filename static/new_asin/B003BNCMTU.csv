4107167,5,B003BNCMTU,"""Frontier Circus"" was a western that aired on CBS in the 1961 season.  A circus traveling through the untamed west.  An interesting concept.",1272067200,3,140,5.043478260869565
4107168,5,B003BNCMTU,I remember this show when it was on. Quite enjoyable and the circus setting set it apart from the westerns and private eyes shows . I always liked Chill Wells performance. It's on my list after I acquire a couple of other Timeless Media DVDs. I'm putting this as 5 stars to counter the person who got upset as it was listed as color. Mistakes happen so don't blame the vendor (Amazon) or the show. Timeless could have given them the wrong information.,1271462400,8,451,4.445783132530121
4107169,4,B003BNCMTU,"I barely remembered seeing this program as a child and googled it on a whim.  My brothers and I have really enjoyed this, even though it is a bit dated, as any sixties TV show tends to be.",1355788800,,188,3.9473684210526314
4107170,3,B003BNCMTU,"I like the show, it is good and has good actors guest starring.  I have noticed that many of the episodes center around a guest star and not the regulars on the show.  The stories are a little predictable, but at least not childish.  In fact some are very mature and deal with social issues, like child abandonment  and alcoholism. The 3 stars is for the horrible box  the DVD s come in.  Terrible package.  I have bought several TV shows from this company and all ahve this same problem.  While I am happy these shows are on DVD, I would think they could at least try to put them in a box that you can get them out of without nearly tearing thte flimsy  thing.",1315094400,,661,4.182539682539683
4107171,5,B003BNCMTU,"Hi, Greetings from Costa Rica, Central America. Quality of dvds is excellent and all original black and white. This TV series show brings to me great memoirs, when I used to see it, together with my father ( I was 9 years old by that time), in my country, around 1963, all sunday nights between 6 pm and 7 pm, before going to a mass at 7:30 pm, in a Catholic Church in San Jose called Iglesia del Carmen. My father and me (or I, I am not a grammar expert) were very fanatics of this great show and after each episode finished at 7:00 pm. we inmediately have to left to go to Catholic Mass. Sometimes we were in deep trouble because the TV Channel Station put this show a little time-delayed and we have to loose part of the episode in order to get on time to mass. We were very sorry when this happened once in a while. Now that my father has gone away to heaven (I hope) I still remember of my father and of this great show. As a kid I really lived each show personally. Now that I could finally bought it I give thanks to God that I could rescue all this memoirs from NOWHERELAND. Thank you Amazon for selling this great motivating show rescued from 1960's TV great magnificent ERA. I looked for this show -for more than 10 years- waiting that it would be finally put on DVD and now my dreams have become reality By the way ,back in 1963, when this show was passed for spanish-speaking audiences in our latinamerican countries, this tv series show was called ""ODISEA DEL CIRCO"", this name would be probably more familiar to spanish - speaking audiences.",1310342400,4,1555,4.292517006802721
4107172,5,B003BNCMTU,It's always great to again see some of the shows from years past that were fun and family friendly. They need to release more of this type for those of us that are disappointed in the fare being offered on Television today.,1309046400,,223,4.333333333333333
4107173,5,B003BNCMTU,"When this series was shown on the BBC around 1962 as a movie fan I was familiar with the three leads. Richard Jaeckel I knew from Guadacanal Diary, The 3-10 To Yuma (original version) and Cowboy with Glenn Ford and Jack Lemon. John Derek had appeared with Huhphrey Bogart in Knock On Any Door and with James Cagney in the largely forgotten western Run For Cover but his biggest role was with Charlron Heston in The Ten Commandents. Chill Wills of course was a veteran of countless westerns. So this series had a strong cast and an unusual setting for a western and it deseves a wider audience. A worthwhile addition to any western fan's collection.",1302480000,,648,4.594827586206897

So, I canceled my satelite. The money I would have spent on services, I now buy DVD's (with none of the above annoyances). Good Choice...I'll never go back!  I am discovering a world of Great programs. Frontier Circus is one of the best surprises ever. I had never heard of it, but tried it based on the reviews on Amazon. There is a whole world of great """"New/Old entertainment out there! This is one of them! Please bring back more of these old shows.

4107175,4,B003BNCMTU,"Frontier Circus was shown here in England from 1961 to 1962 on BBC television. But sadly back then I never got to see a complete episode because I was seven years old and was packed off to bed each week before it finished. So after 48 years it's good to finally see complete episodes. It was a good ""Wagon Train"" type western with the different focus of a travelling circus providing quite a wide variety of stories. But one word of warning, once you hear the theme music you will have a job to get it out of you head, it is a catchy circus march that stays with you from the first time you hear it. Apart from muffled sound on the first episode, all the other episodes are fine with good picture and sound quality. As with most American series of the time there is an impressive list of guest stars, but Frontier Circus also had the bonus of three familiar movie actors playing the leads and Chill Wills, John Derek and Richard Jaeckel make a strong cast. A forgotten western series worth seeing again.",1287187200,15,1003,4.3689839572192515
4107176,4,B003BNCMTU,"On a Thursday night in September of 1962, a nine-year-old boy sat in front of his television eagerly awaiting another episode of this entertaining series.  However, another program aired in its place, and ""Frontier Circus"" had, evidently, journeyed too far on its trek west and dropped off into the Pacific Ocean.  In the spring of 2010, the Thompson & Travis Circus suddenly reappeared, and that boy, now 57, was very pleased to see its return.  That child enjoyed the heroic acts of the two younger leads (John Derek and Richard Jaeckel), but the adult appreciates the folksy charm of Chill Wills and is glad that Timeless Media chose to rescue the series, finally, from the depths of wherever it had disappeared for so long.",1276473600,28,727,4.846774193548387
4107177,4,B003BNCMTU,"This is an obscure one.  ""Frontier Circus"" ran on CBS for 26 (hour-long) episodes during the 1961-62 broadcast season; I don't recall ever seeing it turn up in syndication. Technically it is a western; shot in black and white two years after Bonanza had begun bringing color westerns into America's living rooms, which gave it little chance for success.

The networks were desperately seeking a gimmick to distinguish their offerings from the mass of television westerns getting air time in 1961. CBS remembered that ""Circus Boy"" had been a modest success in a 30 minute format for two seasons (1956-1958).  And Disney had just done well with their January 1960 theatrical release of ""Toby Tyler (or Ten Weeks with a Circus)"". So they made a series about a circus traveling around the Old West in the 1880's.

Character actor Chill Wills (who had been the voice of ""Francis, The Talking Mule"") plays Colonel Casey Thompson who runs the T&T circus with Ben Travis (John Derek before he married Ursula Andress, Linda Evans, and Bo Derek).  Richard Jaeckel plays T&T advance man Tony Gentry (sort of a Rowdy Yates of the circus set).

The show was an interesting blend of circus acts, Indian fights, and shootouts with assorted bad hombres.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1276387200,2,1285,4.835616438356165
4107178,5,B003BNCMTU,"This box set contains all 26 episodes  of this somewhat obscure  western filmed in 1961-62. The episodes appear to be complete, and have nice picture quality and sound. If you remember the show like I do , you'll enjoy this set. The show is similar to Wagon Train in that as the circus arrives in a new destination the main cast members ( Richard Jaeckel, John Derek, Chill Wills) get to interact with the guest cast. So each episode has a differant focus. The shows have strong scripts, and good acting.  Packaging is first rate also. Timeless is doing a great job with their  TV westerns. I'd love to see them release The 1961  NBC Civil War Show The Americans, or The Gray Ghost  .",1272240000,24,684,4.432

8393796,5,B003BNCMTU,"Why this series lasted only 26 episodes is a mystery to me: not only does just about everyone love a circus, but a circus, especially in the Old West, is fodder for stories that couldn't be told against any other background.  The T'n'T circus (named for its owners, senior partner and ringmaster Col. Casey Thompson (Chill Wills) and junior partner and wagon boss Ben Travis (John Derek, perhaps best remembered as the discoverer and husband of Bo, the Perfect 10)) is one of the dozens of small horse-drawn mud shows that played the side roads and rural districts of 19th-century America.  (The third regular is Richard Jaeckel as Texan Tony Gentry, scout and advance man, who rode three years with Hood['s cavalry as a] lieutenant, and still wears the stripe-sided breeches to prove it.)  We first discover it somewhere south of Deadwood in the Dakota Territory, then follow it to Hays City, to Dodge, Bismarck, Nevada, and over the Sierra to California.  Some of the stories are probably out of order; in #10, The Shaggy Kings, set in the Dakota Territory, Casey and Ben talk as if this was their first venture westsomething about the success of which Ben apparently has his doubts.

A travelling circus is much like a wagon traina town on wheels, as Seth Adams once saidand as such is a natural field for human drama: some of it arising from the people that belong to it, some from those it encounters, some from the ones who try to join it or use it as a hiding place.  In the opening episode, The Depths of Fear, a one-time star lion tamer, gone to seed (and drink) after his wife's death in the ring, joins the show, becomes driver for the ill-tempered and tyrannical lion man currently on it, and discovers a mutual attraction to the man's unhappy wifeand, in the end, his courage.  In the second, The Smallest Target, a Kansas rancher learns that the wife who deserted him and their son 10 years earlier is now a star sharpshooter with the troupe.  In the third, Lipizzan, a blind equestrienne's beloved Lipizzaner is killed when Ben commandeers it to chase a pair of fleeing holdup artists, and he resolves to find her a new horse.  In Journey From Hannibal Casey heads to Missouri to pick up the five-ton elephant he's bought, and the mishaps come thick and fast thereafter.  In The Inheritance he suddenly finds himself a father when an old friend, a Japanese juggler, wills him custody of his minor son and daughter, whose insistence on sticking to Japanese customs makes for some hard feelings on the show.  Then there's The Hunter and the Hunted, which is a great Tony episode; Mighty Like Rogues, in which the outfit is maneuvered into taking in the larcenous Jukes family; and Never Won Fair Lady, in which Casey's old C.O. from his Army days requests that the ringmaster make a man of his bookwormish sona charge that leads to some completely unexpected consequences.  Occasionally the scripts become quite complex, as in Quick Shuffle, in which Casey and Ben find themselves working at cross-purposes, each determined to buy an act the other longs for.  When they realize they don't have enough money to get both, Ben (who once earned his way as a gambler) gets into a poker game with an old acquaintance, not guessing that the man wants to get control of the circus so he can bring in a midway of crooked games.  To that end he sets Ben up to be either killed over the table or framed for murder and hung.  Now it's up to Casey and Tony to break him out and help him prove his innocence.

The heart of the series is the inimitable Willsfor many years one of Hollywood's best-known character actors, especially in Westerns, with his flattened nose and odd, distinctive breathy-gravelly voiceas Casey: a tough, savvy, experienced showman who once asks, Where's that con man that thought he could con a old circus hand?, but at the same time is like a father to his troupe, and worth the price of the set all by himself.  Notable too are the sequences of circus lifethe big T-shaped table in the cook tent, the raising of the Big Top by roustabouts and horse teams, the maneuvering of the top-heavy box wagons over a difficult stretch of road (or up a steep one, with seven teams out in front and a bull elephant pushing from behind!), the way each one requires two men at the best of timesone holding the lines, the other ready to turn the railroad-type brake wheel.

Created by Samuel A. Peeples (a.k.a. novelist Brad Ward), who also wrote several of the episodes, the series offers at least one segment scripted by Dorothy C. Fontana, who (as D. C.) later became best known for her association with the original Star Trek, and another by Thomas Thompson, a well-known Western writer of the time.  Guest stars include Aldo Ray, James Gregory, Bethel Leslie, Barbara Rush, Brian Keith, Vera Miles, H. M. Wynant, Irene Dunne, Ellen Corby, Jay Silverheels, Eddie Albert, Rip Torn, Cloris Leachman, Jocelyn Brando, Elizabeth Montgomery (almost unrecognizable with dark hair, until you get a good look at her face and see the turned-up nose and cleft chin), Thelma Ritter, Arte Johnson, Robert J. Wilkie, Alex Viespi (later known as Alex Cord), Dan Duryea, Dick York, Frank DeKova (in a rare Anglo role), Michael Pate, Royal Dano, Sammy Davis Jr., R. G. Armstrong, Stella Stevens, Claude Akins, Gilbert Roland, Charlie Ruggles, Carolyn Jones, Robert F. Simon, Jo Van Fleet, Jeanette Nolan, Henry Jones, Mickey Rooney (so thoroughly disguised in clown makeup that you can only tell him by his voice), Glenda Farrell, Jena Engstrom, Richard Conte (who some years later would play a clown in John Wayne's Circus World), Red Buttons, Nehemiah Persoff, and Roy Barcroft (twice).  A repeating director is William Witney, who was responsible for many of Roy Rogers's movies during the '50's.",1424736000,2,5798,4.750248756218905
