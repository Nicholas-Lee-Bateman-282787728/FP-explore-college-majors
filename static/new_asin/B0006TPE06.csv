2194834,5,B0006TPE06,"This is a movie of moods, beautifully constructed and perfectly acted by David Niven, Teresa Wright, and Evelyn Keyes. Its dual stories capture the settled society of late-Victorian England and the urgency of romance during WW II. I remember seeing it when it first came out. It haunted me for decades, and seeing it again recently comfirmed that it still speaks eloquently to the heart. Masterful work, film at its classic best.",1178928000,5,429,4.972222222222222
2194835,4,B0006TPE06,"58 years before ""Monster House"" - a film about a neighborhood terrorized by a house - there was ""Enchantment"" (1948); a film narrated by a house. I'm not kidding; the house provides a brief bookend voice-over commentary; introducing the story and then wrapping things up at the conclusion.

Fortunately this house is much better behaved than its 2006 successor because 95% of the film takes place under its roof. The modest set means that second-to-none cinematographer Gregg Toland's expertise is somewhat wasted. There wasn't much for him to apply himself to here other than some interesting lighting and a series of interesting match cut transitions (more about these later).

""Enchantment"" is a romance, more precisely two romances as the film tells the story of wartime romances in a London family during both the WWI and WWII. Set in 1944, the film opens with retired General Roland (Rollo) Dane (a convincingly aged David Nivin) pining away over his lost opportunity for true love. Upon the death of his sister Selina he moved back into his boyhood home because it contains memories of his lost love Lark (Teresa Wright). Lark was an orphan his family adopted when she was eight. Rollo and Lark fell in love when they grew up but shrewish sister Selina managed to derail the romance. Lark marries someone else and Rollo pursues a career in the Army. They never see each other again.

Enter niece Grizel (Evelyn Keyes-Scarlett O'Hara's little sister) who comes to wartime London from America. Grizel is an ambulance driver who moves in with her great uncle Rollo. Grizel begins a romance with a wounded Canadian officer named Pax (Farley Granger), who turns out to be Lark's nephew.

Now this may not sound very promising, but ""Enchantment"" transcends ordinary romantic melodrama by the way in which it tells its tale (and I'm not talking about the talking house). The story is told by cutting back and forth between two parallel romantic story lines taking place in the same house; Rollo and Lark during WWI and Grizel and Pax during WWII. This device works quite well and is worth watching just to see the match cut transitions that move the film back and forth between the two romances. There are ten of these transitions. The camera holds on the door inside Selina's bedroom as the story flashbacks to the same spot 25+ years earlier. Then a place-setting at the dinner table takes the story forward. The transitions continue; using a chandelier, a mantle clock, the fireplace, the sidewalk, and the staircase. But this is more than just a slick editing trick. Each match cut is designed to draw attention to parallels between Grizel and her predecessors in the house. Which is why she is given Selina's old room. The climatic transition does not use the match cut technique, presumably to indicate that the later romance will have a more upbeat outcome than the earlier one.

The final match cut involves a set of house ""keys""; probably not a deliberate play on a certain actresses' surname but a symbolic reference (i.e. the key to happiness). The sidewalk transition is the best one as Niven actually morphs into Granger at the same exact point on the sidewalk. This was a dolly tracking shot and the row houses in the background had to line up perfectly (remember this was before digital effects).

For pretty much everyone who has seen""Enchantment"", the most memorable images involve eight-year old Lark and ten-year old Rollo; played by real life brother and sister Peter Miles and Gigi Perreau. Gigi totally hijacks the film at this point leaving viewers wishing she had more scenes. Peter (in appearance and style) may remind you of Freddie Highmore (""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" and ""Finding Neverland"").

In fairness to Selina (nicely played by Jayne Meadows), her resentment of the cute little waif is somewhat understandable. Lark immediately brings out the protective instincts of Selina's father and two brothers. Basically supplanting Selina and stealing her destiny.

Niven, Wright, and Keyes are quite good although Keyes never quite sells her shrewish side nor her attraction to Pax. I felt this was mostly due to Granger who was one creepy guy. Hitchcock cast him for his lead in ""Rope"" for this very quality and while it was an asset in that role it works to everyone's detriment here.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1177804800,15,4369,4.9172320217096335
2194836,4,B0006TPE06,"I watched ENCHANTMENT with mixed emotions.  The basic story is captivating: an orphan girl is thrust into the bosom of a family unprepared for her direct, earthy approach to life.  Little Lark Ingoldsby is played by the luminous child actress Gigi Perreau.  When she arrives at the Dane mansion she can't do much more than shiver and cry and fall asleep, her grief too large to contain within her skin.  Selina Dane, a hideously rude girl possibly eight or nine years older than Lark, takes her in unwillingly, and determines to make her life miserable.  Which she does for the next fifteen years or so.

To be fair to Selina (as a grown woman played by Jayne Meadows, quite well) she resents Lark for stealing the love of her father, her two brothers Pelham and Rollo, and in fact, everyone loves Lark and Selina feels very much on the shelf, playing second fiddle all the time.  Though raised as brothers and sisters, both boys fall madly in love with Lark.  It all seems vaguely incestuous.  You can see it in the expression on Teresa Wright's face when, on her birthday, her ""brother"" Pelham gets carried away by passion and kisses her right on the mouth.  Lark then worries that she's let things get out of hand.  However she doesn't have any scruples when it comes to loving Rollo (David Niven) who is fairly charming in the part.

I think that Goldwyn should have borrowed Jennifer Jones from Selznick to play the part of Lark.  It is so much a Jennifer Jones part that Wright seems distinctly uncomfortable in having to imitate Jones' ways in every scene.  Whatever Wright's other virtues, she wasn't naturally sexy, and I think that the part calls for an actress with more of an erotic charge than ""Young Charlie.""

In the present day story, Farley Granger's as stiff as usual, and Evelyn Keyes is surprisingly warm and low key, a far cry from the noir roles for which we remember her best nowadays, but I can't get over their names!  She is ""Grizel Dane"" and his name's ""Pax Masterson.""  It's insane!  The film climaxes in a mad chase across London as the V-1 rockets fall during rhe Blitz, quite an exciting sequence that demonstrates how far a woman will go to get the man she loves.  As elderly David Niven has advised Grizel, ""Don't stop to bargain for happiness, for in one wasted moment, a door may close, a ship may sail, a train may leave, a man may die. Go after him!""",1143676800,11,2387,4.548009367681499

2194852,4,B0006TPE06,"The film opens with a voice over. It is a house speaking to the audience about how although it looks just like another house, it had a great love inside it. We are brought inside to see an old man, Rollo (David Niven) who vowed never again to enter the house as a young man, but now he has returned to be near the memories of Lark (Teresa Wright), the woman he loved. When a relative from America who is in England for the war visits (Evelyn Keyes), he reluctantly offers her a room to stay in and she slowly gets him to open up about Lark and his past in the house. His story acts as a warning for her not to give up on the budding romance between her and a soldier (Farley Granger).

Enchantment is a great title for this film, which quietly and effectively brings us into the romance of the characters and of the beautiful house which harbored it. The flashbacks are used quite effectively, going slightly darker when illustrating the past. The story is charming, and although it may not be award-winning, it is not to be overlooked.",1319932800,,1036,4.34020618556701
2194853,5,B0006TPE06,"This is a "" they don't make 'em like that anymore "" type of movie. No pyrotechnics or absurd chase scenes just a good story beautifully acted. A film in which the actors were required to enunciate their lines clearly. And the Producer adhered to correct English usage.  It's such a relief to watch good acting accompanied with the pleasant music of the language properly spoken.
Most modern producers allow their actors to speak in whispers against a clutter of noise. You have to turn the sound up during the dialogue and turn it way down during the action: very annoying.
So,if you're like me, and enjoy a good story, good acting and simple straight forward entertainment then I think you will like this movie",1296691200,,711,4.688

2194856,5,B0006TPE06,"Enchantment is a beautiful love story told in a series of flashbacks by a World War II British general named Rollo (David Niven) who recalls his love for a young girl who has come to live with his family after her parents were killed in a train accident. As time passes Rollo and the girl Lark fall in love and decide to marry. Their plans are foiled by Rollo's jealous sister Selena (Jayne Meadows) who arranges a military appointment that separates the lovers. When Rollo returns from service he finds that Lark has married someone else. Years later when the heartbroken Rollo finds his niece about to make a similar mistake he steps in to prevent this from happening as the film ends.  Teresa Wright's superb performance as Lark is dominant in an outstanding cast which includes  Niven, Meadows, Evelyn Keyes, Farley Granger and Leo G. Carroll.  Direction by Irving Reis is solid and Gregg Toland's photograhy and Hugo Friedhofer's musical score lend important support to Enchantment.",1252713600,2,987,4.8982035928143715
2194857,5,B0006TPE06,"Pure and lovely.  This movie may cause one to think of the possibilities if we don't act upon, that which we know IS the time to act.  Music was ENCHANTING!!  A rare gem!",1252022400,2,170,4.090909090909091
2194858,5,B0006TPE06,"ENCHANTMENT is a movie that definitely lives up to the promise of it's title.  Based on ""Take Three Tenses"" by Rumer Godden, this bittersweet romance, set over two generations, is a delightful viewing experience.

Star-crossed lovers Rollo (David Niven) and Lark (Teresa Wright) were torn apart by the nasty machinations of Rollo's sister Selina (Jayne Meadows).  In present-day WW2 London, Rollo's niece Grizel (Evelyn Keyes) and Lark's nephew Pax (Farley Granger) play out their own love drama...but will it end more happily this time?

The shifts between the stories of Rollo/Lark and Pax/Grizel are handled very skillfully, as we slowly learn the secrets of Lark's unhappy home and the ways in which she's continually thwarted by shrewish Selina.  The modern-day WW2 scenes are beautifully shot; Evelyn Keyes delivers a deft performance as Rollo's niece, and Farley Granger (sporting a dapper moustache) is also fine.

At the heart of the movie lies the performance of Teresa Wright, playing the innocent heroine, Lark Ingoldsby.  Others have compared her unfavourably to Jennifer Jones (who might have turned the movie into a better-known classic), nevertheless the film works purely because of the Lark character, and Wright delivers everything you could possibly want.

You may very well find yourself in floods of tears by the end (just like me).  I was totally captivated by this film, and it's definitely going to be on my short-list of essential classic movies.  Grab it today!
