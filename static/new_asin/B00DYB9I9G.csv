The quality of the video is pretty good and subtitle was pretty decent, good enough to understand what's going on. Zhao Liying and Chen Xiao made such a cute and lovely couple, I wish to see them again in another drama.

If for those who haven't seen this drama, I really recommend it.",1444003200,2,418,4.428571428571429
8599074,5,B00DYB9I9G,"I watched this series in two days.  I could not stop.  It is addictive.  The storyline is great.  The acting is very good.  It is in Chinese and has English subtitles.  The picture quality is excellent.  The subtitles show some grammatical and spelling mistakes at times.  The original Chinese being so different from Western languages, I consider these errors minor and do not detract from the viewer's understanding and enjoyment of the dialogue.

The story unfolds during the Northern Qi Dynasty (550-577 AD) and focuses on Lu Zhen, a palace maiden who through her competency, ethics and political savy manages to survive countless palace intrigues and win the love of the Crown Prince Gao Zhan.  The protagonists are endearing, work very well together and are adorable to watch. There are many sentimental moments in their relationship that truly render the romance in the series memorable.  The story is brought to life through great acting, well researched and beautiful costumes and sets, gorgeous landscapes and interesting plot and subplots.  I give it five stars because I loved it. Its worth every penny and in my opinion is a wonderful addition to any DVD collection.",1438560000,3,1179,5.051813471502591

8599076,5,B00DYB9I9G,This has been one of my favorite Asian dramas in a while. I knew China had a amazing history but am more intrigued with the portrayal of it in drama form. I like that Amazon sellers make this available to us thank you.,1422748800,4,218,4.093023255813954
