2127488,3,B0002VGSY4,"If you are a long time fan, as am I, you will enjoy seeing Jackie performing in this historic site.  Jackie even leads us on an abbreviated tour of the venue as part of the bonus material. The concert material is new but all the familiar patterns of delivery remain unchanged.  ""Hey mister! What do you think?...I mean for a man in your condition...""  He does miss a beat or two...  It is, nevertheless, satisfying to watch a familiar old ""friend"" who has entertained us for decades basking in the twilight of his career and clearly wowing the audience.....
Addenda:  I recently saw Jackie in person in a limited engagement before taking his current act to Broadway.
He does a wonderful riff on free speech and condemns the government's attempt to censor Howard Stern and the other edgy radio personalities.
Finally, if you are from the ""gressa"" Jackie fans you won't want to miss an opportunity to add this album to your collection",1104019200,,932,4.693251533742331
2127489,2,B0002VGSY4,"I've been a fan of former Rabbi Jackie Mason since I was a kid.  Admittedly, he's not for everyone.  His acerbic, irreverent and decidedly politically incorrect humor still provokes in JACKIE MASON: A NIGHT AT THE OPERA (Kulture).  His one man show at London's elegant, prestigious Royal Opera House is a perfectly ironic setting for his caustic observations on everything from elderly Jews, George Bush, Tony Blair, the French and much more.  Get a front row seat to be offended with the truth.  It only hurts if you don't laugh.

Not as funny as some of Mason's other performances (see ""The World Accoding To Me""), but he's loose and relaxed and seems to be having a good time with his audience of sometimes bewildered (?) Brits and laughing fellow Jews.  (Through no fault of his own, Mason's previously recorded comments about Ararfat seemed oddly out of place when I saw this DVD on the day of Arafat's chaotic funeral.)",1101254400,,925,4.779874213836478
8033353,5,B0002VGSY4,"His humor is fearless. He captures the idiosyncrasies of Jewish behavior, expressions and culture and is not afraid of making fun of them. His accent, his timing, his occasional Yiddish words and facial expressions are perfect. In the end, no one is safe from his humorous attacks.",1506297600,,281,5.0
8033354,1,B0002VGSY4,i enjoy jackie mason's humor.  but THIS has to be his worst performance...'bout says it all.,1485388800,,92,4.75

8033356,5,B0002VGSY4,He is one of a kind in the world and needless to say it for those who know him and he is known by millions and all love him for his insight and his teaching (musar) but they are hidden through his jokes.,1467763200,,203,3.744186046511628
8033357,4,B0002VGSY4,"If you are fascinated in learning about cultures different from your own, I would recommend this. Jackie Mason is quite the comedian!",1386288000,,133,5.090909090909091
8033358,3,B0002VGSY4,i shouldn't buy this dvd...i remember and saw him live in broadway more than 20 years ago! he was really funny at the time..now he's still doing the same thing but without le je ne sais quoi who made him famous and drole at the time!,1363478400,,233,4.086956521739131
8033359,2,B0002VGSY4,"Jacki's done much better work than this and I attribute it in part to his age now.  He's much less animated than he used to be.

I didn't find anything original in this performance and for those that find him very funny, like myself, this is a poor example.",1193702400,,257,4.224489795918367
8033360,4,B0002VGSY4,"Jackie Mason is one of the few entertainers with the type of gravitas that allows for his expropriating a movie title from the Marx Brothers and having it work about as well as the original. I got kind of a kick out of his appearance here due to his dress. He walks out in an all black suit looking like an older version of Joe Pesci. Overall, I don't think this performance is as good as the others on DVD. He seemed rather tired and lacked his usual intensity. Some of the material was exquisite, however. This was the first time I heard the segment about fat and metabolism and I found it hilarious. Furthermore, the Seigfried and Roy schtick was absolutely superb. Mason's perspective is always appreciated by those of us sickened by political correctness.",1177286400,,760,4.595588235294118
8033361,5,B0002VGSY4,"God's Blessings:  This is one of Jackie Mason""s funniest dvds.  I laughed so much that I could have hardly breathe.  Keep up the good work Jackie Mason.  Thank You.  Anthony Cerbo.",1174176000,,180,4.67741935483871
8033362,5,B0002VGSY4,Funny and witty. I have loved Jackie Mason since the first time I saw him on the Ed Sullivan show and then on HBO. He's hysterical and I loved it.,1170460800,,146,3.9
