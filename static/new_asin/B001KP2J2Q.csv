3667855,5,B001KP2J2Q,"Hulk Vs. is so far the best animated film created by Marvel. Both short films are full of graphic violence, great animation, and the characters are played as they should be. Even the storylines are great in this DVD!

Hulk Vs. Wolverine: Logan is assigned to take down the monstrous Hulk as he tears apart the Canadian countryside. Or is it really the Hulk alone who is causing all the damage? Wolverine soon finds out that Sabretooth, Omega Red, Lady DeathStrike, and Deadpool have been hunting the Hulk for the Weapon X program and attempt to use the most powerful monster on the planet as a weapon. But Lady DeathStrike and the others have other plans.

Hulk Vs. Thor: Odin is asleep and it seems that all of Asgard's enemies have been defeated. But Loki has captured Bruce Banner and plans to unleash the Hulk and destroy Thor. But can Loki truelly control such a savage and powerful monster? For not even Thor nor any God has the strength or the power to stop the Hulk!

My addvice, buy this DVD set. If you are true fan of the core material of the comics, then this DVD is for you. However, beware it is extremely graphic and should not be seen by those under the age of 13. The bonous features are a great treat and plus we get a look at Thor: Tales Of Asgard. So, what are you waiting for? Buy now and enjoy!",1229644800,22,1316,4.341463414634147
3667856,3,B001KP2J2Q,"It was a decent watch. It could have used a little more depth & less flashbacks. Vs. Thor was the better of the 2, story-wise.",1512432000,,126,4.08
3667857,4,B001KP2J2Q,"vs Thor was better IMO...  no matter what, if you like this style of animation, you will like both of them...  plenty of action and fun in both...

I never read the actual Wolverine vs Hulk comics, so maybe I was missing quite a bit, but there seemed to be some strange plot holes in that one...  I also don't understand why they even bothered with yet another flashback scene to Wolverine being infused with adamantium...  complete waste of 5-10 mins or something, that didn't seem relevant at all to this mini-movie...  I don't want to give away any spoilers to people that haven't seen it, but there were definitely a couple ""scratch my head"" scenes in the Hulk vs Wolverine...  while Hulk vs Thor seemed a lot more air tight...

Either way, again...  for people who like this style of animation...  I think they were both enjoyable...",1512172800,,838,4.601351351351352

The world of Asgard which is protected by the All Father Odin. During the winter for one week, Odin goes into a slumber called the Odinsleep and at this point he's vulnerable, and Asgard plunges into war when his son Loki attacks his kingdom. The attacks are always thwarted by Thor, but this time Loki has added a being with immense strength to his ranks, a being that has brought Thor to his knees once before, The Incredible Hulk. -summary

Hulk Vs. is a two part movie by Marvel that features one big slugfest after the other starring the green goliath. Hulk vs. Thor is the first movie in the line up and although more story driven than the second movie. It's still an all out brawl of epic proportions as the Hulk takes on not only Thor but the entire Asgard kingdom. Throughout the years, Hulk and Thor have clashed several times and it has always been a highly anticipated battle from comic to comic. If one would really look at it, it always has been and always will be Marvel's main event, because it features the two most popular heavy hitters in the Marvel Universe.

If this movie was compared to any of their battles from the comics then it ranks somewhere in the bottom; but as a movie it has plenty of very entertaining moments. It takes very little time for the fist to start flying and the two mix up pretty viciously. Even though the movie is action oriented, the story and plot are very strong. The god of evil Loki, Thor's step brother, uses his power to bring Bruce Banner to Asgard and he manipulates the Hulk through magic to do his bidding. There's never a dull moment and during this short feature there's a small amount of character development to the point where a casual fan will not feel lost. The movie also ends on a good note and nothing is left unclear.

Hulk vs. Wolverine

Wolverine is called in to investigate the country side of Canada where the Hulk was said to have been causing mindless destruction. He comes upon a distraught Bruce Banner. After smacking him around a little, Banner becomes enraged and turns into the Hulk. From there Wolverine finds himself fighting for his life.-summary

Wolverine has tangled with the Hulk in most of his incarnations. This battle pays homage to their very first run-in that took place in The Incredible Hulk #181 back in 1974, except this battle does not feature the Wendigo. Hulk vs. Wolverine is considered the best of the two movies by many, and it's mainly because of the no holds barred, bloody, and brutal action. This is by far the most violent of the two movies, as Wolverine is very vicious here when digging his claws deep into the Hulk. This story also features very familiar and popular faces from Wolverine's rogue's gallery in the forms of Sabretooth, Deadpool, Lady Deathstrike, and Omega Red.

The animation is some of the best I seen from Marvel by the time this movie was released; but I do find it to be slightly inferior to DC's animated movies. The action scenes are very fast paced and almost everything is shown in full detail. The camera has its moments too and there are small comic book cover art homages paid during the Wolverine and Hulk fight that only a serious fan will catch. I didn't have many issues with the artwork except I thought Deadpool was way too scrawny, but I guess it was meant to add to his comedic side. The sound effects were very good as well. Hulk vs. Thor I think stood out in this area a little better. It was pretty cool hearing Hulk take those hammer shots from Thor.

The voice acting was spot on for the most part. Graham McTavish got too into his role as Loki and he delivered a fine performance. Steve Blum whom is also well known for voicing Spike Spiegel of Cowboy Bebop was very good as Wolverine, and Deadpool's comedic side was captured well by Nolan North.

I did enjoy both movies, however there was something that kept nagging me. Despite the Hulk supposedly being the star, he felt more like a side character or a plot device. He was only meant to push the plot during Hulk vs. Thor. While in Hulk vs. Wolverine, he could have actually been left out of that story altogether, and with a few adjustments, that could have been a full fledged Wolverine story because his background was explored, and it was his rogues gallery as the main antagonist.

Another thing that bothered me was that the Thor fight seemed a little too one sided at times. I know Hulk is very strong, but Thor's rogues gallery consists of some very powerful beings. Plus he has been able to do things I doubt Hulk could ever do; such as drive off the world devourer Galactus and kill a Celestial. Then again, it all depends on who the writers are and they seem to be very pro Hulk.

These are small gripes I doubt many would care about though. The two movies are still very entertaining, and will more than likely please fans of the characters. I find it hard to believe that an action fan will come away disappointed. The movie has an 82 minute run time. Recommended.

Pros: Non stop action, bloody, and violent

Cons: Hulk feels like a guest star, if that.",1428451200,,5090,4.495670995670996

Two short films, one explosive movie!

Hulk vs Wolverine: Logan (Wolverine) is called in to a small town that the Hulk just ravaged in an effort to track down the beast and stop him for good. However, once the two meet, they go head-to-head and battle to the finish. Different phases of the fight trigger certain flashbacks for Wolverine and he remembers bits and pieces of how he came to be and his history with Weapon X (who also shows up).

This part of the movie is all-out-hey-bub-come-get-some craziness. Wolverine lets it rip and him and Hulk go at it like no ones business, definitely making this segment the more exciting of the two in terms of action. I mean, Hulk really smashes and showcases his raw power and strength and, Im telling you, theres no holding back.

Putting Wolverine up against Hulk was a smart move because here you got this guy whos tough as nails, has a healing factor, and has an adamantium skeletonand claws! that make him near invincible. On the I-can-take-some-serious-damage level, Wolverine is right up there.

I also appreciated how they had him slice into Hulk versus just having the two slug it out. Frankly, Wolverines punches against the Hulk wouldnt him take him far, if anywhere at all. Have him start cutting the Hulk with his clawsand with them being adamantium, they can do thatnow Hulk finds himself in some serious jeopardy if hes not careful.

Storywise, this one was the weaker of the two, but getting a brief overview of the Weapon X program and Wolverines creation is a plus for fans. Besides, Deadpool is in this and who doesnt love that?

Onto . . .

Hulk vs Thor: Loki transports Hulk to Asgard while the city is no longer under Odins protection thanks to his annual Odinsleep. By separating Bruce Banner from the Hulk, Loki removes the restraint on the Hulk and unleashes the green beast against the unsuspecting Asgardians. Thor steps in to stop the Hulk from breaking in and destroying the city. The two battle it out in the realm eternal and only one can be the victor.

Straight off, the storytelling of this one was much more complex than the Hulk vs Wolverine segment. I appreciated that and liked how Thor was dragged into this battle as opposed to him just trying to get back at Hulk for something or simply seeing who is the strongest.

Sticking Hulk in the realm of Asgard as opposed to having the story take place on Earth changes things up for those of us not used to Hulk fighting in that kind of arena. Throw some complex emotions and Hulks inner turmoil into the mix by way of honing in on Bruce Banner, and you got a good Hulk story.

This one focused more on Hulk in that regard whereas the other one seemed to focus more on Wolverine despite this movie titled as being Hulk-centric.

The battles on Asgard were almost as good as the Hulk vs Wolverine ones, but not as awe-inspiring. I did like, however, Hulk going up against multiple opponents in this as he took on the Asgardians.

The movie as a wholeI wish theyd do a live action version or something similar if they ever do a follow up to The Incredible Hulk. To have Hulk not just have the army on his tail but also other powerful superheroes would make for an exciting flick.

You never know.

3668078,5,B001KP2J2Q,I've watched pretty much all related Marvel animated movies that were released. This is 1st one I've enjoyed. Been disappointed for many years as I love all of the DC ones. You get 2 mini movies were are great. The Wolverine one is what stands out. I didn't know much but assumed it was just Hulk and Wolverine. I was happy to see a nice group of villains too! This made for some great match up fights that I've never seen in a past Marvel animated cartoon episode or movie. I thought it was well done and entertaining to see. This is the 1st time I've seen Deadpool before in animated form and he was great. Hopefully I'll see me 2nd good Marvel animation movie soon.,1406937600,,668,4.309523809523809

3668096,1,B001KP2J2Q,"Hulk vs Wolverine was fun to watch. Although the characters were not well developed, they were portrayed fairly as very evenly matched. Very violent though, this is not a kids' animation feature. Quite enjoyable and action-packed.

My one star rating is for the horribly one sided Hulk vs Thor.

Hulk vs Thor, as already mentioned by other reviewers, was obviously made by people with a total dislike for the Thunder God.

I love both Thor and the Hulk and have been following their encounters since I was a kid. The record of their fights is slightly inclined to Hulk's favor: lots of draws between the two, with 1 or 2 wins for Thor and 3 or 4 wins for Hulk; or something close to that.

Yet in this movie Thor is portrayed as a totally inferior and ineffective adversary against the Hulk.

And why is that? Just turn on the commentary feature of the film to hear the makers of the movie ridicule the Thor character (this has been mentioned by at least another reviewer of this movie).

I would have been equally disappointed if the Hulk character was the one depicted as badly as Thor was in this movie. As a fan of comics I expect DC, Marvel and the other companies to be aware of the respect they owe to their characters and to us the fans of those characters. In my book that means to portray them fairly and true to their imaginary attributes, qualities and weaknesses. And not to make that portrayal based on biases, personal likes/dislikes and whims of writers, directors or any others responsible for developing the plots or scripts.

This charade of a superheroes animation film is an affront to those of us who appreciate and value the fair depiction of the fictional characters whose publications we have cherished for so many years. The mockery of the Mighty Thor that is so evident in the story and so admittedly true in the makers' commentaries is something that Marvel should have not let happened.

Again I would have disliked this film just as much if the despising and disrespect had been directed against the Hulk. No superhero character should be disrespected like this.

The other aspects of this film are fine: good animation technique, excellent color saturation, great voicing and awesome scenery (the portrayal of Asgard and the Underworld are great).

Too bad all of the effort and work for making this animation feature was ruined by turning it into a spite-release valve of the makers against one of the oldest and noblest characters of the Marvel Universe.

Hopefully the newly found success of the Mighty Thor in its feature non-animated film and in the mega block buster The Avengers (and hopefully also on Thor The Dark World) will make Marvel aware that they need to be more vigilant to prevent that some buffoons ruin the image (and thus potentially the profitability) of their superheroes.

It makes me wish that Thor was for real so he could do some lightning ass-frying to the makers of this dissapointing animated movie.",1383264000,,2960,4.72621359223301
3668097,5,B001KP2J2Q,Both stories are good.  The Wolverine is the better of the two but the Hulk in Asgard is still OK.,1382659200,,98,3.9
3668098,3,B001KP2J2Q,"BEWARE OF SPOILERS

Pretty straight forward, plot light action fodder stories, one pits a pre-X-Men Wolverine against both the Hulk & the clawed one's particular rogue's gallery (which includes such fan favorites as Deadpool and Sabertooth), the other has a completely savage Banner-less Hulk being used by Loki to attack Thor & Asgard during the Odinsleep (when Odin the All-Father, AKA: Thor & Loki's dad, rests, leaving Asgard more vulnerable to attack).

In the end the Wolverine segment is the stronger of the two, much stronger perhaps because screenwriters & frequent partners in crime Craig Kyle & Chris Yost are at heart more X-Men fans - and especially appear to be more Wolverine fans - and appear to be more fans of Hulk than Thor (which makes it strange that ""Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes"" for which Yost was the show-runner a few years later, treated both characters more equally than this pathetic drivel), though one should probably not discount corporate shenanigans (the same shenanigans that resulted in Hulk & Iron Man having big supporting roles in ""Next Avengers"" while Thor got completely vilified as well as being reduced to a cameo). The Wolverine segment gives fans of this extremely overrated character what they expect - a better adaptation of his origin than the god awful 2009 film, as well as very hard hitting action, the kind Wolverine has never been able to have in past animated efforts for obvious reasons. The voice acting all around is very good - Steve Blum is an excellent Wolverine (he even sounds a little bit like Cal Dodd from the 90s series) and Nolan North is absolutely hilarious as Deadpool, the merc with a mouth (how North got miscast as Cyclops on ""Wolverine & the X-Men"" remains a mystery).

The Thor segment, however, is nothing puerile garbage designed to be lowest common denominator masturbation for the Hulk fans as Hulk subjects Thor to a laughably humiliating beat down & then proceeds to batter Asgard to its knees, courtesy of Loki's machinations. Good voice actors - Graham McTavish as Loki steals every scene he's in - are wasted on poor writing that fails to invest the audience in the plight of its characters because the characters clearly aren't as important as Hulk's rampage. Not even Bruce Banner getting a glimpse of a peaceful ending resonates the way it should. Where the Wolverine segment featured an eye rollingly laughable shot of Wolverine bringing the equally overrated Hulk to his knees after a few chest slashes, here Thor is reduced to a green rookie who just stands around like an idiot allowing the Hulk to beat the crap out of him, ignoring the centuries of combat experience, just so the Hulk, who's really not even that interesting of a character no matter who's writing him, can look good and Hulk fans can squeal like children while Thor fans are left with nothing. On top of that, the animation in the Thor segment is absolutely hideous - the character designs are ugly and clunky as Hell, with Thor being the ugliest and clunkiest of all (his love interests, steadfast Sif and evil Amora, don't exactly live up to their comic book beauty either), and the designs don't animate well, which makes the already poor quality fight scenes look even more ridiculous. Yeah, the Wolverine segment also features highly stylized designs but they actually work for the more grounded hard edged thriller that they set out to be, while the stylized designs of the Thor segment don't work at all. Thor & his fellow Asgardians would receive far better designs on ""Earth's Mightiest Heroes"" and even in ""Tales of Asgard"" where Thor, Loki, Sif & Amora are mere teenagers.

Hulk and Wolverine fans should eat this right up, Thor fans will be disappointed.",1379808000,,3732,4.881703470031546

I see reviews from time to time where someone puts a lower rating on a title because they disagree with the story not being 100% true to the comic storyline. The idea of the Hulk facing Wolverine in one storyline can only be trumped by the fact that the Hulk really fights five Marvel characters in the process. I think the Hulk vs. Wolverine storyline was more action than story. I'm not sure if they ever explain why the Hulk was in Wolverine's area? Regardless the cast of characters that appear in the story more than make up for the situation. The Hulk vs. Thor title has more storyline explaining how Thor and the Hulk cross paths. The idea of splitting the man and the monster makes the story better action wise and believable. In the end the two stories in one purchase is a good thing, some might favor one story over the other.

3668106,5,B001KP2J2Q,"I thoroughly enjoyed both of these `short' movies. They were well written for what they were and well animated. The story lines were pretty well thought out too but not too deep and that's fine since there are two short stories here and where the hulk is involved with a title that has `vs.' in it I knew what I wanted from it and they knew how to provide it. Needless to say, I wasn't expecting much when I rented this and was pleasantly surprised to see story development beyond what one might expect from a movie made up of two short stories. The action was intense and over the top in a great way.
BUT........ I what I enjoyed even more was watching both Thor and wolverine get the absolute crap kicked out of them. Oh yeah, Hulk destroys them both and I loved every minute of it. Both stories showcase the hulk's immense power and unstopability and believe me he goes ALL out here especially in the Thor story. Sadly due to wolverine's popularity dear wolvy didn't take quite the beating Thor did which was a shame since I have always believed wolverine is an overrated character and really deserved the beating Thor took but oh well, he still got `it' handed to him and that was good enough for me.

Hulk Vs Wolverine.
  This film is amazing start to finish. I love the story, voice acting and the art. However something should be said for the little things that the art studio really put into this to make it more special as well. I really like the commentary track as well I thought it was insightful and not at all boring. Another thing I thoroughly enjoyed was the character depictions, meaning that Wolverine feels like Wolverine Deadpool feels not at all like Ryan Reynolds which was a great feeling. I like the whole Hulk wins round one and ""Wolvie"" wins round two and ends with them starting round three. Very cool. Marvel Should release some more 40 minute films in this format.

Rating 5 stars

Hulk vs Thor
  This film is on the great side of good. The art style is different. Not bad but I just am not too fond of the sharp lines and 45 degree angles on the shoulders and muscles but it wasn't distracting once the story hit. This movie has an interesting story and the action is great. I love the Warriors three and the voice acting with them. They feel like they stay true to the comics and they are those characters. I was even excited to see Balder the Brave fight in this... as short of a fight it was nonetheless.

Rating 4 stars

OVERALL. In all honesty I give it 5 stars because Deadpool deserves 6 stars in this but, Thor brings it down a notch. DVD is set up well and special features are adequate. No complaints from me MARVEL. Release an animated film about Bartuc the Leaper and I will buy it.",1363996800,,1643,4.3257328990228014

3668120,3,B001KP2J2Q,"""Hulk Vs."" consists of two films featuring ""Hulk vs. Thor"" and ""Hulk vs. Wolverine.""  As you can imagine, these two confrontations strike very different tones.

The action begins with ""Hulk vs. Thor"" and it sets the bar quite high. Odin goes into hibernation every winter to regain his strength for a week, during which time Asgard's enemies attack. Thor (Matthew Wolf, reprising his role from ""Thor: Tales of Asgard"") along with the Einherjar rally to defend Asgard each year.  For accomplished fighters like the Asgardian warriors, they consider the seasonal raids to be a fun exercise, making a mockery of their enemy's efforts.

Loki (Graham McTavish) is not happy about this state of affairs and crafts a plan: Using the Enchantress' (Kari Wahlgren) sorcery, he captures Bruce Banner (Bryce Johnson), turns him into the Hulk (Fred Tatasciore), and then extracts Banner's soul.  Without the calming influence of Banner, the Enchantress turns the Hulk into Loki's puppet, making him the ultimate killing machine.  Ignoring Banner's pleas, Loki sends the remote-controlled Hulk into Asgard.

The Hulk makes short work of just about everybody, including Thor. When Thor manages to wrest control of the Hulk away from Loki, the Hulk goes berserk and nearly beats Thor to death. He is saved from death's door by the Enchantress, who has a crush on Thor and betrays Loki by explaining his plot.  When Thor confronts Loki about his nefarious plans, he discovers Banner dead, murdered by Loki in a fit of pique. Banner's death in Asgard condemns his soul to Hel, one the nine Asgardian realms.

Thor convinces Loki that if they don't reunite Banner's soul with the Hulk he will destroy all of Asgard.  Loki commits his forces to delay the Hulk while he and Thor descend to Hel to retrieve Banner's soul.  But the Queen of Hel, Hela (Janyse Jaud) is in no mood to release any souls from her embrace.

This is where ""Hulk vs. Thor"" really does an excellent job of fleshing out Bruce Banner, who is normally just an irritating side character whining about getting angry.  Unlike the other souls tortured in Hell, Banner has finally found peace, living a fantasy life with Betty Ross (Nicole Oliver) and even raising a child. In short, Banner doesn't want to be reunited with the Hulk and it's hard to blame him.

Conversely, ""Hulk vs. Wolverine"" is just a bunch of Weapon X characters slicing each other up, with the Hulk occasionally in the middle. There's cigar-chomping, ""bub""-spouting Wolverine (Steven Blum), grim Russian Omega Red (Colni Murdock), the angry Lady Deathstrike (Janyse Jaud), the prickly Sabretooth (Mark Acheson), and joke-machine Deadpool (Nolan North).  Wolverine's out to catch the Hulk and the Weapon X team is out to catch Wolverine at the behest of mad professor Thornton (Tom Kane).

Unlike ""Hulk vs. Thor,"" ""Hulk vs. Wolverine"" features a wimpy Banner whom everyone looks down on, including Wolverine.  His only purpose is to be goaded into turning into the Hulk, which ignores a major facet of the Hulk persona.

Throughout ""Hulk vs. Wolverine"" are intermittent flashbacks to Wolverine's origin, which is peculiar because it shifts the focus away from the Hulk.  On the plus side, the film lets Wolverine really let loose with his claws, slicing off limbs and stabbing people in great gouts of bloody gore.  Still, the attacks are meaningless - the X factor healing ability of the entire Weapon X team means such wounds are temporary at most. Deadpool is the sole standout if only because he makes light of the absurdity of a top secret facility populated with nobody but killer mutants.

As the titular character, only ""Hulk vs. Thor"" gives the big green guy his due.  The first installment is basically ""Wolverine vs. Hulk,"" which is fine if you're a Wolverine fan but if you're a Hulk fan, not so much.  It's enough to make Hulk fans angry...and you wouldn't like them when they're angry.",1340582400,2,3914,4.9419847328244275
3668121,1,B001KP2J2Q,"Actually, that`s putting it mildly. It this DVD were simply a waste of time I`d still give it 2 stars. The problem being that the Wolverine vs. Hulk episode is also offensive to Marvel fans of every age (the critics who gave positive Amazon-ratings notwithstanding, apparently.) While certain events in Wolverine`s history are depicted (Wolverine`s debut in The Incredible Hulk 181, as well as elements of Barry Windsor Smith`s excellent Weapon X -storyline from Marvel Comics Presents), nothing in Hulk vs. Wolverine is presented in a compelling manner. Apart from the Hulk`s rescue of two innocent bystanders during his initial confrontation with the Weapon X -squad, neither of the two protagonists, arguably two of the most tragic and complex characters in Marvel-lore, are presented as heroic beings - the Hulk merely smashes and roars, while Wolverine merely slices and snarls his way through this ordeal of a movie.

The animation is fine, but the violence is horribly graphic, rendering this feature unsuitable for a younger audience, while older viewers should feel offended by the lack of a decent plot and the non-existent characterization. The villains of the piece are merely `edgy`, but there`s no backstory to make any of them interesting. In the comics, Deadpool is much more than simply a wisecracking, guns and knives -wielding mercenary. I`m not entirely sure of his backstory, but the man was horribly disfigured during an experiment, which led to him becoming slightly unhinged. Lady Deathstrike traded her humanity for cybertech enhancements in order to gain revenge on Wolverine, whose mere existence she believed brought shame on her family. It would have been so easy to add some emotional drive to the movie`s narrative and many battles by referencing or even depicting said events.

In conclusion, I`d like to state that the movie left me, a longtime reader of Marvel Comics, questioning the appeal of characters created for the purpose of generating a never-ending stream of violent imagery. But no, it`s the makers of this misguided movie that decided to desregard everything that makes Hulk and Wolverine timeless, compelling characters worthy of the huge following they have amassed in the years since their creation. They deserve better, as did this this movie`s audience.",1338681600,2,2304,5.2411924119241196

If you're looking for a more logical storyline that gives fair tributes to the highlighted characters involved, you probably are looking in the wrong place.  The animation of these two films is pretty impressive and detailed, but the stories and logic behind it are faulty.  I've never been a huge Marvel follower, but I do know that Thor is incredibly powerful and has been written as such.  He was treated in the script with such disdain for his power and force of will.  Whoever created these films either hates Thor or worships Hulk, or both.  There's no way that Wolverine can inflict more damage on The Hulk than a God of thunder can, and anyone who argues otherwise is a blind Hulk fan.

Not a big problem but it was called Hulk vs Thor, right? Now the main event: Hulk vs Wolverine. This should've been its own standalone movie with longer run time. I loved this. It was 5 stars in its short 37 minutes or so. It had great action, art, comedy and voice work. I watch this over and over again. Man it ended too soon. This was worth the price of admission all by itself.

3668130,2,B001KP2J2Q,"When I was young, I always loved to see superheroes fight each other. It's on par with monsters fighting. I was exicited to finally hear they were making a movie with Hulk fighting Wolverine. While I still enjoyed the film, I was really dissapointed in it. Here's my reviews for both films

Hulk vs. Wolverine- I was exicited to see this film. However, I feel like this film came up really short. First off, it focuses too much on Wolverine's backstory. This is something we didn't need to see since we already know who Wolverine is. Second, it doesn't live to the title. For a film called ""Hulk vs. Wolverine"", it's only a minor scene because they only fight for like a minute or two in an half hour film. they pretty much take a backseat to Deadpool. It be like making King Kong & Godzilla fight in the very beginning of their movie and the rest is having a random monster steal the spotlight from them. Third, too many unnecessary characters. I don't know why they added all this characters from Wolverine's past. I know it's interesting to added a few more, but I feel they just took up space in the movie. Space that could have been used for more of Hulk & Wolverine fights. Most notibly, Deadpool who just chewed the scenes he was in (Yes, I don't give a darn about Deadpool). I feel like the animators forgot that they were making a Hulk vs. Wolverine film and thought they were making a Wolverine vs. Weapon X film with Hulk. It's like they had Hulk & Wolverine fight for two mintues and the rest is just Deadpool with his lame jokes. But all my rants aside, it's still entertaning. Though it was short, the fight with Hulk & Wolverine is fun with lots of slashes & blood. Although I don't care about Deadpool, the voice work by Nolan North is great. Finally the animation is great for this film. Overall, This one was still entertaining but still dissapointing because it doesn't live up to the title.

Hulk vs. Thor- This is what I expected to see in Hulk vs. Wolverine. Unlike that movie, Hulk & Thor fight through out the movie with the other characters only being background characters. I'm not a Thor fan however, so I wasn't exicited about this film one bit. Because we've already seen this two fight in Ultimate Avengers. Plus, nobody wants to see Thor fight Hulk as much as they do want to see Hulk fight Wolverine. I don't have much to say about this one, it was decent and it's what you'd expect. Thor fans will love this.

Overall, both film are fun and entertaining. But Hulk vs. Wolverine could have been so much more. DAMN YOU DEADPOOL!!",1307318400,,2560,4.454157782515991
3668131,4,B001KP2J2Q,"I bought this DVD set strictly for the Wolverine feature, and I must say that I was not disappointed, but also not ""wow""ed.  While it is very fun to watch and packed with action, the whole thing is basically just one long action sequence with not much story aside from a few flashbacks.  And the ""ending"" (if you can call it that) made me remember the way people complained about the last scene of ""The Sopranos""

Another important point: this feature is rated PG-13 for very good reason.  In the course of the film, characters suffer dislocations, lacerations, GSWs, impalements, eviscerations, explosions, electrocution, amputations ... and the list goes on.  They blow each other away, smash each other to pulp, and LITERALLY tear each other limb from limb.  This is no show for kids, folks.  I think the ONLY reason it's not rated R is because it's animated.

So, bottom line:  If you are a fan of Wolverine, and a MATURE viewer, I say pick one up.  But I also say stick with a used copy.",1306454400,,992,4.5852272727272725

3668135,3,B001KP2J2Q,"It takes a lot for an animated comic book series to impress me.  I've loved the animated Batman films, so I decided to take a venture into the animated Marvel universe.  Needless to say, I wasn't blown away by this blu-ray.  Let me break it down for you:

Hulk Vs. Thor- being a huuuge Thor fan, I feel like this didn't do justice to Asgard.  It tried to bring Simonson's and Kirby's work to life, but the result was too hokey for me.  Thor is best when subtle and powerful, instead of loud and ungraceful.  They nearly got there for me, but its a really tough balance.  The tone would have been better for kids.  I can't complain about the action or the actual Hulk.  The story was well done, and I enjoyed the fanboy nods.  My only dissapointment was that the tone didn't quite align with the story.

Hulk Vs. Wolverine- I actually enjoyed this one more, since it attempted to be more badass.  My first of two complaints was that it danced between kiddy and brutal too much.  The curseword-hiding dopey jokes do not match ultraviolence with blood at all.  Secondly, I praised the attempt to adapt Windsor-Smith's origin of Wolverine, but it should have been done separately.  That series is very dark and eerie, and it deserved it's standalone separate adaptation.  Cramming it into this movie didn't quite work for me because it was rushed, and it didn't fit witht the whole of the film.

Together these films aren't bad, I just won't be watching them again and again.  They mostly consist of great ideas, with scattered efforts.  To sum it up its all over the place.  The animation company did a mediocre job, really.  They should have gone with the full anime treatment, instead of an overseas company trying to mimic American animation.  There are a couple moments that are shoddy.  Don't worry though, because you will be entertained, but I doubt you will be totally impressed.  Watch Batman: Gotham Knight if you want to be blown away with modern comic book animation.",1297123200,2,1976,4.6253602305475505

The Thor chapter includes alot of Thors fellow Asgardians as well as a healthy selection of his enemies . It also presumes you have read Thor before . I was not crazy about Thors design( how thin his face was, and that his biceps are twice as big as his thighs ), but thats a small complaint . Overall I liked this story alot .
  The beginning of the Wolverine story reminded me of Steve Austin chasing Bionic Bigfoot . I have never been a huge X-Men fan but I have always enjoyed Wolverines battles with the big guy , and there is something there for you Weapon X fans . This is also a good tale . I know there are alot of reviews that say these animated shorts are too short, but I was content as the storys moved really fast, and you can tell that the creators have alot of love for the material they are representing .
  The single disc edition is also widescreen so I did not purchase the Special edition. The only thing I would have wanted from the special edition would be the feature on Kirbys Thor, so you figure out if its worth the extra money to you .

Hulk vs. Thor - Graphics, are amazing very fun to watch. The story was good, and action (Fight scenes) were done very well.

My only complaint is this movie is way to short.

Hulk vs Wolverine - Graphics again are freaking amazing, Fight scenes were spot on. My only disappointment was the duration, the movie was way way way to short",1292889600,,514,4.505376344086022

Wolverine battle was really good, but extremely predictable. I mean you have a decent fight when both of the characters tend to be pretty much indestructible, Hulk getting madder and more powerful and Wolverine with his healing abilities. Just when it was getting really good, the fight interruption just spoiled the flow things for me. I enjoyed what happened, but there wasn't all that much to it and it wasn't that deep. Deadpool was great though.  After they get back to fighting, there was really no resolution. It's not like you can have Wolverine kill the Hulk or vice versa.  It just sort of ends.

I was more impressed with the Thor battle, but mostly just because that episode was longer and more detailed in general. Hulk gets taken control of and used as a weapon.  It was very cool seeing the Hulk tear through everybody.  Hulk Smash!",1292630400,2,1067,4.67379679144385

3668141,3,B001KP2J2Q,"Comic companies have had a recent Renaissance with their animated properties by expanding into the direct to DVD market.  DC has been leading the pack in this endeavor, but Marvel has been slowly catching up.

This release gives you two 40-minute movies of the Hulk teaming-up (or fighting) with Thor and Wolverine.  Now, many people complained about the lack of action in Ang Lee's Hulk movie, but these flicks more than make up for that here.  Perhaps a bit too much.  The Wolverine part is very action-driven to the point it feels more like part of a story rather than a complete one.  This DVD was also ill-timed in its release as the short-lived Wolverine and the X-Men cartoon had a Hulk appearance at roughly the same time (although it's not quite as adult in tone).  The Thor story, though, fares a bit better and is a little more well-developed in comparison.  The only major complaint I have there is that Banner is drawn with these insane jowls that just droop.

Overall, both segments were entertaining and worth at least a watch.  I don't know how many repeated viewings it will be worth (I haven't been ""dying"" to see it again) but that will depend on the viewer.

3668144,5,B001KP2J2Q,"Earlier reviews went over the storylines and the MARVEL universe in-depth, so I'll just add that as only an occasional frequenter to the MARVEL universe and comic book stuff in general, I liked this Blu-Ray disc.  The interviews with the creators and the behind-the-scenes looks were illuminating; before that, I had just thought the voice actors/actresses read the scripts pretty straightforward.  I didn't realize the effort and time they put into the different voice inflections, the physical effort to voice the characters, etc.

The Blu-Ray disc came through very nicely on my 720p plasma TV and Sony 460 BR player.  The menu is a bit confusing as it doesn't appear to resume play if you stop the movie and I never figured out how to use the BOOKMARKS function, assuming it works.  The BR disc takes a bit longer to load but these are minor quibbles.

What would have been a great addition for the EXTRAS would have been some of the 1960's cartoon shorts that you see on YouTube and might now be available on DVD's.  I remember the old ""THOR"" cartoons because of the opening jingle.  They should have put some of those on the BR disc, re-digitalized and upconverted to make it look nice.  There have been 2 ""HULK"" cartoons since the 1980's but they've made the rounds on TV and reruns and I think the older fans and the newer ones would have appreciated those 1960's cartoons that came out only a few years after Stan Lee and MARVEL had hit the ground running.

The length of the 2 movies is fine, but don't expect much in the way of character development or in-depth personality analysis of the characters.  Both episodes get into the action without much delay so if that is your game, you won't be disappointed.  No waiting around for 15 or 20 or 30 minutes as is sometimes the case with a feature-length movie.

Let's hope for more of these BR discs with the MARVEL characters instead of variations of the characters when they are younger or from alternate universe settings.  And I can't think of a better addition to the EXTRAS than some of those cartoons of yesteryear, which take up little space on the disc and to which MARVEL already owns the rights and should be able to add to the BR disc at minimal cost.",1279411200,,2221,4.589873417721519
3668145,3,B001KP2J2Q,"If you love the Hulk Smash, then this dvd is for you.  Hulk Vs. is a compilation of two animated short films, Hulk vs. Wolverine and Hulk vs. Thor. The first: Hulk vs. Wolverine was created to feature the character of Deadpool and generate hype for the new Wolverine and the X-men TV series, (which is now in its second season and doing rather well).  Hulk vs. Thor introduces audiences to Thor and his world, designed to build up interest in Marvels upcoming Thor live-action film.

Hulk vs. Wolverine features Logan's original comic debut, where he's sent by the government to bring down the Hulk.  Our two heroes duke it out for awhile before being captured by Weapon X.  We're introduced to Wolverine's past and his villains,\ (Sabretooth, Lady Deathstrike, Omega Red, and Deadpool).  The script really showcases Deadpool as a comedic highlight; the movie is worth watching for him alone.  Packed with tons of nicely choreographed action and a stunningly well-cast Wolverine, Hulk Vs. Wolverine is an excellent watch for any X-men or Hulk fan.

Hulk vs. Thor does a fine job of introducing the realm of Asgard and its heroes.  Loki, the God of Mischief, captures Bruce Banner and sends the rampaging Hulk to kill Thor.  Thor and all of Asgard throw themselves against the Hulk, but it'll take even more than Mijolnir's Hammer to stop this raging green beast.  If you get tired of really repetitive action and a lot of screaming ""RAARGH!"" every time someone gets hit, this movie is not for you.  Some more fight choreography would have done wonders here.  But if you're up for half an hour of Hulk going head to head with Asgard, (it fittingly reminded me of Minas Tirith from Lord of the Rings), then you'll get an eyeful.  Hulk vs. Thor serves its purpose of introducing Thor's characters and his world, but it just gets a little too long and a little too ridiculous.  The ""eye-roll"" moments are rather high here, what with lines like ""but if the mighty Thor fails, what hope is there for Asgard?""

Everyone else should sit back and enjoy.

I liked both stories, but the one starring Wolverine was executed a little bit better.

3668157,5,B001KP2J2Q,"I've watched several of the recent Marvel animated movies (Ultimate Avengers 1 & 2, Next Avengers, Doctor Strange, Invincible Iron Man) and this was by far the best.  Although it could have been a bit longer both of the stories were compelling and interesting.  I preferred the Hulk vs. Wolverine a bit more than Hulk vs. Thor however both were very entertaining to watch.  This was basically because I was more familiar with Wolverine's back story than I was of Thor.  In any case this Blu-ray gets top marks.  Here are my thoughts;

Pros

+ Decent adult scenes of animated violence and blood.  Especially on Hulk vs. Wolverine.

+ Interesting (although somewhat predictable) storylines.

+ Nice behind the scenes ""making of"" extras.

+ Brilliant musical score by Guy Michelmore (he's scored most of the other recent Marvel animated features as well).

+ Amazing voice acting cast. Deadpool in particular was brought to life extremely well in this feature.

Cons

- A bit short, even with 2 stories.

- Not as enjoyable if you're not entirely familiar with all the characters in the Marvel Universe.  I had this problem with the Hulk vs. Thor portion of the story.

- Somewhat unbelievable that The Hulk can best Thor, who is a god.  Yes I understand it's a comic book setting but it still seems a bit unrealistic, if that's possible.

All in all an excellent animated film.  I rarely purchased Blu-ray discs immediately when they're released but this one got my money.  I just wish the total playtime would have been a little bit longer.  If you love the Hulk, Wolverine or Thor, this is a must have DVD.",1262217600,,1606,4.722021660649819

I would think that Thor would fare a little better seeing that he is a Norse God and has gone toe to toe with Superman. The Artwork is excellent! It would have been great to see Thor and Loki team up to send the Hulk back to earth instead of Hela.

The Wolverine section was excellent! It almost put too much into the plot, but it was a good move to blend in some of Wolvie's old foes. It was cool to hear ""OK, Bub, let's try that again."" and ""Hulk smash little man!"" they made sure to include. I could've done without the various flashbacks.

The hulk remains in his element of comic style as this is where he is at his best. Only here can he be used and displayed in his best glory. You get to see his power fully, his anger, the rage in his face, the power of his strikes. Fully. He is powerful here as we know that he is supposed to be without the hoopla. The battles that go on here are great. This is by far the greatest cartoon marvel has created to this date of my review. It is bloody like what they don't show you on tv. And maximed in comic fashion in the way you want so it's just better than all the hulk movies.

Hulk vs Wolverine
It's a great buy and includes some awsome Marvel fan favs....but it should have been a lot more in depth and where the hell is Genral ThunderBolt??? Where ever the hulk is the Hulk Busters are never too far behind and where was Wolverines Canadain Team Alpha Flight??? If you are going do a Wolverine Story when he is still fighting for Department H you have to include those guys!!!!! Besides that it's a great movie.

Hulk vs Thor

Great story line and action....but they way the story starts out I can only assume that the story is in a timeline where Thor has already meet the Hulk which means he already has meet the Avengers....yet Thor never summons a single Avenger to his aide..now I understand that they probably would not be allowed in Asgard in the first place..but Captain Americia has been seen as an equal to Thor, because he is one of the few  heroes who is able to pick up Thor's hammer...which can only be done by a true Champion...just saying it would have been nice to see sone of are other Avenger buddies thats all...",1242432000,2,1147,4.421800947867299

Although both are short and do not have a ton of story you already knew this was about the match ups, and in that sense the fights are awesome. Whoever says this is ok for kids should have their kids taken into a relatives care, I am not sure even 13 is ok, maybe 15. I am not a fan of gore but do not mind it either but 13 seems still kinda young to me.

3668173,2,B001KP2J2Q,"I enjoyed the Hulk vs. Thor episode. It was a little short on story and very predictable but the fight scenes were pretty good. A little too violent but nothing I thought that was totally over the top.

The Wolverine episode was shockingly grotesque. Just like Thor the story was predicable and the episode was a little short on story. However, on the violence scale Hulk vs Thor was for preschoolers compared to this bad boy. If the amount of blood that was spilled in this episode was saved the blood bank would not be in need of any donors for weeks. It was just a grose feast of murder, blood, ripping arms off peoples bodies (while they're alive). I mean come on. It was disturbing. If this was live action instead of a cartoon it would have been pushing the NC-17 rating.

Keep both these episodes away from small children!!! It says PG-13 and it means it.... for adults who enjoy gore fests you probably will enjoy this.",1241395200,3,927,4.479289940828402
3668174,4,B001KP2J2Q,"This being my first animated, comic-inspired movie, I was leery.  Being a hardcore comic fan, I almost expected to be disappointed.  After watching Hulk Vs., however, I can say that I'm a fan.

Battle #1: HULK vs THOR (and friends)
Clearly based on the original Avengers storyline, this is a story of Asgard in danger.  Odin is asleep, and it's up to Thor and his soldiers to protect their land.  His brother Loki, desperate for control, seeks to attack by putting a spell on the Hulk and turning him loose.  The action is tense and exciting.  Watching Hulk tear through Asgard, and beating Thor to a pulp is awesome.  Seeing him palm people by their heads, necks, and legs, throwing them like ragdolls, is hilarious.  Have no fear!  Without ruining the ending, it's safe to say that the story ends up as most Marvel storylines.

With this story, I have a problem.  Hulk could not beat Thor.  It's just unreal.  Even the most cursory knowledge of Marvel superheroes would tell someone that.  Thor was literally created by Stan Lee as an answer to the near omnipotence of Hulk.  He's a demigod for goodness sakes!  Overall, however, the storyline for this one is fairly well developed, the action is awesome, and the resolution is near perfection.

Battle #2: Hulk vs. Wolverine (and friends)
Let's see... a massive free-for-all inside the Weapon X compound where Hulk is the proverbial bull in a China shop headlines the story.  Battling Wolverine is bad enough, but add in Deadpool, Lady Deathstrike, Omega Red, and Sabertooth and you have a serious battle royal.  At one point there is a great flashback to the Weapon X series, and issue #181, that brought us all the most awesome of all X-Men characters: Wolverine.

Deadpool's wise-cracking steals every scene, absolutely hilarious.  The story really isn't all that developed; it's just an excuse to have a vicious, bloody battle for 30 minutes.  Not that I'm complaining.

With incredible animation, superb story-telling, perfect voiceovers, and just HEAPS of action, this double-header is the quintessential reason why people become comic book fans.  Bravo Marvel!",1241308800,2,2120,4.954545454545454
3668175,5,B001KP2J2Q,"HULK VS

Being that I am a fan of Marvel Comics and just about every character that has come out of there you know that I had to have this. In fact I don't know why I have yet to review this up to this point. I remember seeing this on the shelf the day it was released and getting excited because I just knew this would be the best of the latest group of animated films from Marvel. So after calling my bro to come see this with me and since my girl is a fan of basically anything animated we all sat down to watch this. I am very excited to say even though it has been out for a while and you probably know this is an excellent way to spend time in front of the TV. I enjoyed both to the fullest as did the other two in the room with me, I personally think that each one is as good as the other.

HULK VS WOLVERINE - this seems to be everybody's favorite right here and I can definitely see why that is, this is a fun and violent little tale. We are right in the middle of Canada it seems and a path of destruction lay right in the heart of it, I think maybe the Hulk had a little to do with that right? Well that is what the government thinks and they have hired everyone's favorite mutant Wolverine or Logan [whatever he wishes to be called I guess] to hunt the Hulk down and stop him in any way possible. So the chase is on but it doesn't take long for them to come face to face and the battle is on. When these two go at it I was really surprised how violent the battle was for a pg-13 film, I sure am glad it is what it is though. Still the biggest plus has to be the fact that Weapon X is not only in this film but stars as well, and Logan's back story is a good yet brief history lesson for those who do not know it [slap yourself].

The gang is all here Lady Deathstrike, Sabretooth, Omega Red, and of course the show stealer Deadpool, if for no other reason get this for him he is absolutely hilarious in this. He even sticks to the pointing out that this is a comic [or animation, whatever] like he does in his series. There is not enough I can say about Deadpool in this other then this may have killed it for Ryan Reynolds. This animated version and the guy who did the voice seem like they have built this character up so well in this film that Ryan may not live up to the standards for the Wolverine movie. Still Deadpool may be the best reason to watch this. For the casual viewer this is most likely the one for you, violent, exciting, and funny all wrapped into one. Plus the end shot is completely awesome and stay tuned after the credits for a little more Deadpool.

HULK VS THOR- while the Wolverine one may get most of the attention thanks to all the very popular characters and the scene stealing Deadpool the truth of the matter is story wise this may be the better film of the two. For those who don't know Thor is the protector of Asgard especially when his father Odin is resting up, this is the time when all the evil of their planet attacks Asgard. Of course Thor and the Asgard armies are always too much for them that is until Loki the half brother of Thor captures Bruce Banner and uses the Hulk to destroy not only Thor but Asgard as well.

The story line here and the way it plays out is extremely well done and really feels like a complete story as were the Wolverine one seemed rushed at times and left you feeling it ended way to soon. Also the animation here is great just like the first one but they are completely different. In the Wolverine one the animation seems more realistic which was fitting due to the story and violent nature of it. But here on the Thor one we are treated to more of a cartoonish feel that helps play to the fact that this is more story oriented than the other.

I have to say that of all the animated features to come from Marvel lately this has got to be the best yet. The writing was great in both as was the direction and voice acting for both films, like I said Deadpool in particular. I think the biggest thing to come from this release though is that everyone wants to know when Deadpool will get his own film. If he does get one you better believe I will be buying it, and I won't wait so long to review it either. But enough about that and back onto this, this is an excellent set that seems to be the first in a line of vs films and if they are like this one then they will all be successful. I highly recommend buying this, skip a lame rental.",1240963200,,4420,4.039954337899544

Do you think they have a CLUE that the market, like most things in life, is changing for animation? Do you think that they have a CLUE that more and more adults are into what was considered a kids media? I don't know. I look at films like HULK vs. and then I recnetly NETFLIX-ed WONDER WOMAN and I just have to wonder. Why is it that the Japanese can make a truly all-out, adult and bloody animated movie and Americans still try to hold it to acceptable levels? If push comes to shove, make two versions of the same movie, perhaps? I have read a few of the reviews here and I have to agree with most of you. Being a fan of the comics and charecters from back in the day, I was pleased on a basic level with this movie.

3668185,4,B001KP2J2Q,"Well not really being that into comic books and their characters (apart from the live action adaptations) I didn't really have high expectations of this, but I must say I genuinely enjoyed it. I have only managed to catch Hulk vs. Wolverine so far, but I will add my two cents in regards to Hulk vs. Thor when I've viewed that.

Hulk vs. Wolverine had a runtime by my calculations of around 37 minutes, so I really wasn't going to get a genuine plot or that much character depth. Well the story starts with X-Man, Wolverine being called into a remote and snowy location in which a small town has fell victim to the wrath of what the Americans call the Hulk. Wolverine must stop the Hulk before he finds another small town, but little does Wolverine know, all is not what it seems and Wolverine finds himself being re-united with his creator and some of his biggest enemies including Sabre tooth and Lady Death strike.

The overall tone of the piece is simply the violence of it all; there's no real dialogue that has any relevance and the plot is very basic even for an animation this short on time. I guess this is something definitely and primarily aimed at the types of people who have read the comics for years and have been begging for this to happen for twice as long. Who am I to know, maybe it's already happened in paper form and Marvel just took the decision to animate it for a new audience. Either way it's entertaining as hell.

I only gave it 3 stars for a number of reasons. Although it was genuinely better than I originally imagined, it didn't do anything for me that will have me remember it for a time. The brutality of some of the fights between Hulk and Wolverine made me cringe with the ferocity of it. There were times when I thought the violence was a bit too over the top and just un-necessary, but was still enjoyable. The characters were as you would expect them to be. Hulk is just a mindless violent beast and Wolverine is also a mindless violent beast who actually loves a good fight.

Another reason for just giving it 3 stars is that they're called all new Marvel movies. But what exactly constitutes the moniker of movie? Hulk vs. Wolverine was just over 35 minutes long and I have no doubt that Hulk vs. Thor will be roughly the same length. Even if you label the two of them as one combined piece, the length I still wouldn't define as a movie. The cover of the DVD appears much better than that of the animation within the film. Don't get me wrong, the animation isn't anywhere near awful or anything like that, but it's just very basic stuff that we've seen time and time again.

I would say that if you're thinking of checking this out, then you really need to be one of the guys who reads the comics and has wanted this for years. If not then you'll probably end up like me and although enjoying it, you'll feel like it didn't really serve any sort of purpose or explain anything to you.",1237852800,,2926,4.3713235294117645
3668186,3,B001KP2J2Q,"Surprisingly enjoyable.  The animation was very clean for a direct to DVD movie.  While the segments were short, there was enough of a plot to make it feel like it wasn't a complete shallow action movie.",1237766400,,203,4.611111111111111

However, we also get some effective dialogue and characterization from each of the stories, as well as some imaginative scenarios.  I would have bought the two-disc edition of ""Hulk Vs."" if I knew it existed at the time of my purchase, as I tend to enjoy the documentaries and other generous extras included with such offerings, but even my single-disc version includes a handful of extra features, including audio commentaries on both films and previews of upcoming Marvel projects.

3668189,5,B001KP2J2Q,"Hulk, his essence being that of always having a mad on, has had repeated run-ins with several of the other Marvel characters. There's his classic battles with the Thing, but Ben Grimm's not in here so let's put that aside. While I don't really recall the Hulk having much of a rivalry with Thor, Wolverine is another matter. Wolverine made his debut in the Hulk's comic book (issue #181) and these two have had a history since then, most of it not lovey-dovey. HULK VS. WOLVERINE and HULK VS. THOR are companion pieces - two short animated direct-to-dvd films, respectively 37 minutes and 45 minutes long - and are showcases not for intricate plotting and exposition but for meaty, hard-hitting, down-and-dirty fighty fights.

So Wolverine is the best there is at what he does, and here what Wolverine does best is get the Canuck pounded out of him. As HULK VS. WOLVERINE takes place, Logan is still a ways away from his stint with the X-Men. Here, he's still under orders from Department H, which sends him to investigate a creature which has crossed into Canada and annihilated a tiny town. And this sets up the first meet between Wolverine and the Hulk, as they face off in the Canadian wilds. The tussle follows its logical course, with the Hulk mostly getting the better licks in. I'd never seen Wolverine go painfully airborne so many times, at the behest of the Hulk's mighty haymakers. But then their fun bag of hurt is interrupted by Logan's old pals from the Weapon X program...

There is some serious violence featured in both HULK VS. WOLVERINE and HULK VS. THOR, and both films are most definitely NOT recommended for the young kids. In VS. WOLVERINE, with its free-for-all monster vs. monsters theme (even Logan doesn't come off as so noble) and with just about every character endowed with a healing factor, the storytellers are able to cut loose with the extremely brutal action sequences. Arms get ripped off or sliced off. People get gutted. And Logan calls everyone ""Bub,"" except for Bruce Banner, whom he calls ""Weepy."" But it's cool that ferocious, remorseless fighters like Wolverine and the Hulk aren't restrained to PG-rated patty cake stuff.

Happy fun time for Wolverine fans as he's featured heavily in this one, his origins getting a good once over and with particular focus on his involvement with Weapon X. This story is set not too far removed from those days, and so what we get is a Logan who's even more hardcore than he is with the X-Men. Check out the way he induces Banner's transformation into the Hulk.

It's pretty neat seeing the other messed-up characters from Weapon X. Lady Deathstrike is as formidable as I remember her, while the merrily insane, scene-stealing Deadpool absolutely brings down the house with his hilarious one-liners. The levity he injects into this very grim movie is most welcome. And, by the way, do yourself a favor and stick around for a brief but funny post-end credits sequence.

Segueing now to Norse mythology. Apparently, it's all about Odin the All-Father. Odin's power is what safeguards Asgard, the Realm Eternal and home to the Norse gods. Except that once a winter the All-Father must rest, must spend a cycle of time in Odinsleep. At this time Asgard is at its most vulnerable, a most inauspicious time for its warriors, most especially when a rampaging Hulk shows up. It's all a plan of Loki's, of course, the god of mischief and the Thor-scorned Enchantress working dark enchantments to separate Bruce Banner from his always cheesed off alter ego. This division renders the Hulk at his most mindless and savage, become pure rage incarnate, and he makes short work of the pantheon of Norse gods.

Here's one example of these two films working in harmony, balancing each other. While VS. WOLVERINE feels gritty and dark, VS. THOR, even at only 45 minutes, has an epic tone. Gods are featured here, and frost giants, valkyries, the Warriors Three, the enchanted hammer Mjolnir, and the rainbow bridge, so immediately the story feels larger than life, but then factor in too the widescreen scenery and the bright colors. And, above all else, Thor, the god of thunder, who is so noble I feel like I should hate on him on principle. The Hulk goes thru Asgard's protectors as violently and easily as chimichangas go thru my dyspeptic grandmother. And, yes, the Hulk also batters Thor into pancake, in fact punches him thru a mountain. Thor is clearly worried about the Hulk (""This is no immortal evil that we face now. The Hulk has come to Asgard.""). It's pretty intense, seeing the god of thunder being pummeled this badly, and I reiterate what's said in the audio commentary: ""It says something, when a god... is afraid of you.""

The resolution, of course, is easy to figure out, but I like that Bruce Banner wants no part of it. While I dig the Hulk, I'm not a fan of Bruce Banner. Note that in these two short films, he doesn't come away in a flattering light, presented as this tormented dude all weepy and sniveling. Anyway, if you've ever enjoyed Jack Kirby and Walt Simonson's takes on Thor and Asgard, then HULK VS. THOR'll put a grin on your mug.

This is a two disc package. Disc one has the HULK VS. WOLVERINE short animated film and the following special features: two audio commentaries (one by producer/co-writer Craig Kyle & co-writer Chris Yost, the other by supervising director/producer Frank Paur and storyboard artists Kevin Altieri & story Butch Lukic); ""This Is Gonna Hurt"" - the 20-minute-long Making Of HULK VS. WOLVERINE; Fan Frenzy: 2008 Comic Con - a Q & A panel with cast & crew (8 minutes long); and a first look at the television animated series WOLVERINE & X-MEN.

Disc two has the HULK VS. THOR short animated film and the following special features: two audio commentaries (one by Craig Kyle & Chris Yost, the other by Frank Paur, director Sam Lui & colorist James Peters); ""Of Gods And Monsters"" - the 18-minute-long Making Of HULK VS. THOR; Jack Kirby + Thor - various folks talk about artist Jack Kirby's influence on the look and feel of Thor; and a first look at the upcoming THOR: TALES OF ASGARD (about Thor when he was a youth).

I actually think that having these short running times was a good thing. HULK VS. WOLVERINE and VS. THOR are more impactful, get their plots rapidly moving, and benefits from a lack of dead spots. The voice acting is really good and the animation is terrific and fitting for each respective film: the rough-and-tumble grit of HULK VS. WOLVERINE, the archaic majesty and might versus might of HULK VS. THOR. In any case, both moods succeed in drawing you in. And, if you're like me, you'll end up in Blissville as the Hulk resentfully smashes about him like the world is one huge Whack-a-Mole, Wolverine unleashes his claws to do some serious damage, and Thor keeps on talking funny. I say to thee, awesomeness!!",1236470400,6,6856,4.729707112970711

They all suffered from massive built up, some great evil that threatened everything but the ending... the final confrontations... they were the definition of anti-climatic. But both of these ""films"" are far and away nothing like the others, they tell a realistic interesting story, they have action, and the ending fits.

3668192,5,B001KP2J2Q,"While Marvel's intent here is pretty obvious (capitalize on the popularity of the last Hulk movie while simultaneously promoting their upcoming Wolverine and Thor movies), unlike some of their other direct-to-DVD animated releases, this one is actually good.  Scratch that, it's awesome.  The movie is really two separate movies, in which the Hulk goes up against Thor and Wolverine.  While the stories are fairly inaccurate as far as official comic book canon is concerned (to be expected), what makes these special is that the characterization is fantastic.  Indeed, both movies end up being more about Thor and the Asgardians and Wolverine and Weapon X than about the Hulk.  The Hulk is the focus of the stories, but its the other characters that really carry it.  There are also great little visual references to classic Marvel comics throughout.  My only real criticism is that I didn't like the voice-casting for Thor and Loki.  I think it might have been better had those actors had the reverse roles.  This isn't so with the Wolverine movie, though.  The casting there is perfect, especially Deadpool, who steals the show.

Overall, this is a fun movie, and if you're a comic book fan, it's even better.  The stories are simple but fun, the action is exciting (and far more violent than one would expect -the PG rating is well-deserved) and the animation is strong (it could have been a little better, but it's certainly better than what you get on TV).  By far, this is the best animated Marvel movie I've seen yet.",1236038400,,1524,4.8604651162790695

The animation is good quality and looks fabulous on Blu-Ray, especially Asgard.  On the other hand, the two stories are so predictable that you could write them before you open the box.  I wasn't expecting it to be an Oscar winner, but I did expect it to be a DVD I would want to watch more than once.",1236038400,8,447,4.103448275862069

The Hulk Wolverine feature was a fan boys dream..but the real money maker...surprisingly or not so surprisingly is the Hulk Vs. Thor feature.  This one has a clever and original story line that brings all of the colorful and cool characters of Marvels Asgard to life.  If watching Baldar the brave, the Enchantress, frost giants and the like was not enough, Loki, the key baddie in the Thor feature was true to form and fun to watch.

Wolverine was not as good. Wolverine battles the Incredible Hulk  in Canada. Hulk Vs. Wolverine with apperances by Marvel characters like Deadpool, Lady Deathstrike, Sabertooth, and Omega Red.

I was never much a fan of Thor but I think the story has pertanial.  I didn't like the idea that Hulk and beat a God and I think that is where the story loses it flavor.  Perhaps if they had used a different villian like Lowkie only that would have been better.  I think only the comic fan would appreciate it more.  I enjoyed the comic delights of Deadpool.  I think the dvd is ok.  It is not something I would want to go and buy.  I rented it and was glad I did.  Would I watch it again?

All of them have high points and low points, the biggest concern is whether you are buying a hit or a miss. For $14, buy the special edition and get the two movies combined. If you aren't wanting both movies, or if the price goes up for some reason, stick with Hulk vs. Wolverine. This movie will shock you for as much as it shows. Normally, you barely get to see blood during fight scenes. This movies shows blood, people getting their arms cut off, people getting stabbed, cut down shot, etc. They use adult language and adult humor. I can highly recommend this product, as it gives a whole lot to the audience that they weren't probably expecting. The Hulk vs. Thor, not so great.",1234915200,4,816,4.557823129251701
3668204,4,B001KP2J2Q,"While I enjoyed the previous animated features from Marvel (Ultimate Avengers 1 & 2), I was not overly excited by the animation used in those films. They were a bit cheap-looking, and could have been so much more.

Well, it looks like Marvel realized that, and they've stepped it up a bit. Both mini-features in ""Hulk VS"" are well-animated, and pull no punches when it comes to blood, violence, and fine details. Anything with the Hulk and Wolverine in it should be violent, and bloody... and this is. Kids should probably not get to see this one until they're in their teens.

The Wolverine film is less Hulk and more Weapon X, but that's a good thing. All characters a represented well in this story. There are lots of background details for fans (Did you see X-23 in there?) and a lot of excitement. Voice work is excellent; Especially for Wolverine and Deadpool. The script is intelligent and not dumbed-down for a kid audience. My only complaints are that they don't give the casual viewer any idea WHEN this occurred in Wolverine's history, and the ending is pretty abrupt (though you should stick around after the credits to see the outcome).

The Thor feature was true to the comics, and really followed the Asgardian tales from Marvel quite well... But I've always had a problem with voice casting for Asgardians. Why do they always cast people who do British English (or faux-British) accents to portray the Asgardians? They aren't the gods of the U.K.! They're the NORSE gods, and as such should probably have Norse accents (and yes, I realize they're still speaking English, which is also just nonsensical, but I chalk that up to magic; They're speaking ancient Norse, but are understood by the listener, whatever their language, due to their Asgardian/godly nature).  Seriously-- Why does Loki sound like the British god of Mischief, instead of the Norse god of Mischief? Why does Thor sound like an Englishman who has lived in the United States for 40 years, rather than sounding like a Nordic god?

Seriously, Marvel-- This is simple. They are NORSE. They have more in common with the Swedish Chef than the cast of Fawlty Towers. Is that so hard to grasp, that you'd fail at voice casting Every. Single. Time?

This is no slight on the actors, who I'm sure did what they were told... But it's about time we got a Thor who sounds like he should, and not like a character from Monty Python & the Holy Grail.

That little quibble aside, the Thor story was decent, and had a better resolution than the Wolverine story. The ending was a nice nod to older television endeavors, and the writing was worthy of a Thor comic.

Is this worth a purchase? Only if you're an animation superfan, a Marvel superfan, or a Wolverine superfan that needs every little thing made featuring these characters. Otherwise, I think it's entertaining to watch, but not something I'd rush to purchase. It is, after all, two 60-minute features (or less) that are pretty straightforward. There's not much twisting and turning in these plots, and that's fine. It's the nature of a Hulk story to be 70% action, and 30% plot. It's what you want, and expect, with a Hulk story.

I'd give it five stars if they had given the Asgardians the right voices. For me, it breaks the suspension of disbelief to hear some Asgardians sounding like Englishmen from upper-class London, and some sounding like women from Los Angeles. For you, that might not matter, though.",1234656000,2,3440,4.739130434782608
3668205,4,B001KP2J2Q,"""HULK VS."" is a 2-disc special edition featuring ""Hulk vs. Wolverine"" and ""Hulk vs. Thor"" animated movies. Released from Lionsgate there are numerous previews, various audio commentaries, and of course the actual movies.

Disc 1 contains ""Hulk vs. Wolverine"" (PG-13) and is 37 minutes long. Hulk is tearing up the Canadian country side and Wolverine is sent to stop him. The movie opens with Hulk and Wolverine battling. After the title and credit sequence the movie goes back to four hour earlier when Wolverine was brought in by helicopter to the small town of Elkford that was destroyed by Hulk. The Canadian military wants Wolverine to stop Hulk. If he can't be stopped then Wolverine is to kill him before he harms another town or city. The chase is on with Wolverine finding a lot more than expected including other foes in the Canadian wildness.

Disc 1 also contains audio commentaries with Craig Kyle, Chris Yost, Frank Paur, Kevin Altieri and Butch Lukic. There is also a first look at ""Wolverine And The X-Men"" coming in April along with a making of ""Hulk vs. Wolverine"" feature. There is also a feature about the ""Hulk vs. Wolverine"" world premiere at the San Diego Comic Con last year and a question and answer deal there at the convention.

The 45 minute Disc 2 features ""Hulk vs. Thor"" (PG-13) and is the story of Loki trying to destroy his stepbrother, Thor. The movie opens with another colorful credit sequence before taking us to the realm of the eternal: Asgard. Long ruled and protected by Odin all is well and the cycle continues. Every winter Odin must sleep and leaves things unprotected for seven days and that is when the wicked come. Thor leads the defense against the siege of darkness. Dr. Banner is spirited in by Loki so that he can be forced to become the Hulk and used to finally destroy, Thor. But, Hulk is not a weapon that can be controlled for long and the repercussions for all will be epic.

This disc also features audio commentary with Craig Kyle, Chris Yost, Frank Paur, Sam Liu and James Peters. Like the much bloodier and brutal ""Hulk vs. Wolverine"" disc, this disc also has a making of the feature and a first look feature at the next movie in the series. This one is on ""Thor: Tales of Asgard"" coming out on DVD this fall.  There is also a feature on Jack Kirby and his artwork with Thor.

The result is two very different movies that continue the legendary Marvel characters while providing plenty of back story. The animation is detailed as are the complicated story lines creating a viewing experience sure to please old and young alike.

3668206,4,B001KP2J2Q,"Very well pleased with Marvel's latest animated feature; only complaint being the simplicity of much of the art (Sabertooth's face was especially simplified down) and animation, which could have been much more lavish.  Loved the lenticular slip-case cover.

Good development of Asgard in the Hulk Vs. Thor segment.  Some notions of Norse mythology are included, such as the resting Odin with one eye, the ravens that defend him, the relationship between Loki and Hela (tho her brother, the Fenris Wolf, resting next to her feet while she sits on her throne, is not mentioned).  We see Kirby and Simonson villains in the great battle against Asgard.  We do not, however, see Ulik the Troll, who, as Kirby drew him, was almost as formidable as the Hulk.

I have a problem with the metamorphosis of The Hulk thru the years.  When I first started reading comics in the mid 1960s, the Thor Vs. Hulk battle was one of the first I encountered.  There, The Hulk was only a little larger than Thor and they seemed pretty evenly matched.  Here The Hulk is almost 12 feet tall and a bit more than a match for Thor.",1234569600,2,1103,4.644329896907217
3668207,4,B001KP2J2Q,"I had a lot of anticipation for this animated feature from Marvel when I first heard about it from the Next Avengers DVD, and it didn't let me down.

Hulk vs. Wolverine is almost right out of the classic comic that first introduced everybody's favorite Canadian antihero. The story starts off simple enough, Hulk's on a rampage and it's up to Logan to stop him. Only problem is the Weapon-X program gets involved. This feature is almost more of a Wolverine Origin story, but in the end it's Hulk, Logan, and the Weapon-X program in a massive brawl with every man and woman for themself! The animation is actually more simplistic looking then recent Marvel animated features. It almost looks more like the animated DC universe at times. But this is quickly made up for by the over-the-top action sequences. What's more is The Hulk and Wolverine don't pull their punches at all in this one. They smash, slash, crush, and carve each other up like they mean it, which is long overdue.

Hulk vs. Thor is, as the preview from Next Avengers said, more like Hulk vs. Asgard. The big green war machine takes on the land of the Gods while Odin sleeps, and it's up to Thor to stop him. Thor and Hulk have had a number of great fights over the years, and an animated feature dedicated to their rivalry was long overdue. The animation is actually a step up from Hulk vs. Wolverine, though still very stylized. The action is just as good though. Hulk smashes like their no tomorrow, and Thor does what he does best, fight monsters!

Both films are great additions to the Marvel Animated collection, and with a new X-men series on the way and an animated Thor special later this year, it looks like we'll have to make more room on the shelves.",1234569600,2,1728,4.532051282051282

Hulk vs Thor is fine, but after watching the green monster fight Wolverine and others, I was disappointed with the action.

Overall, the blu-ray version has great picture and sound quality and Hulk vs Wolverine is worth the full price alone.

3668210,5,B001KP2J2Q,"""Hulk vs. Wolverine"" deals with the popular Canadian mutant superhero with the Adamantium Claws known as Wolverine being sent to the U.S./Canadian border to stop a huge creature that has brought destruction near a local town. He battles with Bruce Banner and his superstrong alter ego The Hulk then after that they get kidnapped by a mad professor with Sabretooth, Lady Deathstryke, Omega Red and Deadpool for experimentation but can they struggle to escape?

""Hulk vs. Thor"" is about Bruce Banner kidnapped from Earth to Asguard by the wicked Loki as the diabolical fiend wants to use his alter ego to control him and battle against the mighty god of thunder Thor. But as he magically seperates Banner from the Hulk, it's an epic battle between a god and an unstoppable monster .

An outstanding and wonderfully animated action-packed adult animated epic from Marvel Animation! now this is the best Marvel animated movie ever done. The ""Wolverine"" story is very action packed and quite gory for a PG-13 rated animated feature as it's non-stop action while the ""Thor"" tale is a modern fantasy epic that has the mighty god re-introduced into animation in a new way. The film is quite violent and is too intense for kids but more for teens and adults but fanboys of Marvel are gonna have a blast with this rollercoaster ride of two unique animated features, bring on more Marvel animated movies like this.

This Blu-Ray has the most superior picture and sound quality there is! the extras are terrific like audio commentaries, featurettes, Trailers, and first looks at ""Wolverine and The X-Men"" and ""Thor: Tales of Asguard"".

3668211,5,B001KP2J2Q,"I was pleased to pick this up for I am a big fan of Marvel. Hulk Vs. is a double feature with two short stories featuring the Hulk goin up against Thor and Wolverine. This DVD is on 37 minute tale of Hulk Vs. Wolverine, the second a 45 minute tale of Hulk Vs Thor. For summaries of the storylines, you can look at many of the other reviews or the product description.

In Hulk vs. Thor, Odin, who is God of that place, sleeps every winter and in that time, Asgard comes under attack by the forces of evil. The champion, Thor, always fights them off to the chagrin of his stepbrother Loki, the God of mischief. Loki enacts a plan that he hopes will defeat Thor. That plan is to bring in the Hulk, the strongest creature in Midgard (earth's plane), to destroy Asgard's defenses. Hulk is placed under a spell and Bruce Banner is seperated from him so that he will have no check on his power. Then Loki sends him on a rampage through Asgard.

In Hulk vs. Wolverine, Wolverine has been given the task of deafeating the Hulk. Both are then confronted by Weapon X consisting of Sabertooth, Lady Deathstrike, Omega Red and Deadpool. This on has the bloodiest and most brutal violence that I have ever seen in an animated film. Deadpool was hilarious being comic relief and I liked this one better then Hulk vs. Thor.

Marvel fans will be pleased to pick up this up. This is something that will mostly appeal to fans of the characters or those looking for some good action. Remember this is rated PG-13. I will not recommend this to be viewed by kids for the violence is brutal and bloody, especially in Hulk vs. Wolverine which had scenes consisting of slashing, slicing off arms with blood gushing out of the wound, soldiers lying dead in a pool of their own blood and sinking claws into flesh. Deadpool even gets his arm sliced off in a scene. I recommend that this should NOT be viewed by kids.

The DVD also has some commentary and a few trailers. I would recommend this to any Marvel fan and this could mean that Marvel should continue producing more animated films similar to this one.",1234051200,,2083,4.416666666666667

All that Hulk does in both movies is gets captured, gets angry, and smashes things. Ok action, but no plot. If you just want mindless violence with no substance than you may like it. Its nice to see Wolverine cut loose and there is plenty of blood in them, but thats all you're going to get. The animation is choppy and a bit too bright, mainly in the Wolverine section.
 I must say, Marvel has lost ALL my respect. They are much better to sticking with live action movies than animation. Animation is DC's area of expertise. I felt their movies have great story telling along with great action. Superman: Doomsday was terrific if you see it as its own movie and not like the comic book. Justice League: The New Frontier is a masterpiece. Enough said. Batman: Gothem Knights is NOT an action movie, but has wonderful animation and a powerful story that really dives inside his mind and how he becomes the Batman.
 If Marvel wants to gain my respect again they need to take lessons from the masters. At least make an amazing X-Men animated movie thats not JUST action.",1233705600,,1166,4.521327014218009
3668213,4,B001KP2J2Q,"Hulk has pretty much appeared in most of marvel's storylines, and these two mini features blend in nicely to all of the characters involved histories.  This DVD is on 37 minute tale of Hulk Vs. Wolverine, the second a 45 minute tale of  Hulk Vs Thor.  For summaries of the storylines, you can look at many of the other reviews or the product description.

 I must say, I purchased this single disc edition and am very pleased with the set up. The package is a slipcase 3d lenticular motion picture that alternates between Hulk-Thor and Hulk-Wolverine.  The disc set up has a master menu, then two sub menus for Hulk vs Thor and Hulk Vs Wolverine, and corresponding commentary and previews are under each sub menu.  I am not sure if the two disc edition gains much on this one, other than two making of features (one for Thor and one for Wolverine).  The only version I would see gaining the worth of a higher price is the Blu-Ray because of the better picture and the makings of feature.

The action/battle scenes are unparalleled in any of the other animated features by marvel, and by far much more violent and bloody, earning the PG-13 rating.  Definitely a parental guidance needed prior to younger kids watching.  My only qualm is that the animation is not quite as detailed as past marvel projects such as Dr. Strange, Iron Man, and Ultimate Avengers.  The character faces and shadows are not set in the same tone, not a big deal, but a few of the scenes with the Hulk I was distracted a bit by the simplicity of his face up close. It looked more of Saturday morning cartoon rather than feature film/movie quality animation.  The effect of pure rage was still not lost though, but it could have been helpful. I am somewhat fearful of the previews for Thor Tales of Asgard  and  Wolverine and the X-Men mainly because I feel Marvel may be jumping on the prequel bandwagon which usually ends up in many inconsistencies and sore feelings from longtime fans, and a potential further quality drop in animation detail.

Overall, longtime fans will not be disappointed with this in the long haul, and for two short movies that keep you saying ""ouch"" at the thunderous punches and brutal blows, this DVD has it.",1233705600,,2209,4.596938775510204
3668214,5,B001KP2J2Q,"The movie came in good condition. The movie came earlier than the stated time, much more convenient for me.",1233705600,,107,4.684210526315789
3668215,5,B001KP2J2Q,"So far I have been very unimpressed by what Marvel has offered in the way of animated movies.  There is such potential there, but they have dropped the ball over and over.  DC really has it together and the Justice League Unlimited cartoon is argueably the best animated superhero cartoon of all time.  Marvel has opted to use sub par animators with stories better suited to small children.  This is the movie that is redeeming them

Out of the two, Hulk vs. wolverine is by far the best.  The story for Hulk vs. Thor is very good, but the animation is much like some of there recent releases.  It looks like the X-men Evolution series mixed with Ultimate Avengers.  The character designs are straight out of the comic and the story is something that would appear in a comic.  This alone is better than anything Marvel has done, now on to the good stuff.

When I say the preview to Hulk vs. Wolverine, I figured that it was the best scene in the movie.  Seeing wolverine dripping blood from his mouth and then forcing his arm into place, seeing the hulk and jumping out of the way at the last second was amazing.  It really just got better and better.  The animation is very original.  It is very stylized and really made Wolverine out to be the animal he truly is.  The dialogue was great, they really pinned Wolverine and the hulk was awesome.

Marvel has finally outdone themselves with this animation.  To often they tone everything down and alter their properties to be safe for kids and the general public.  They water their characters down so that anybody who knows nothing about any of the characters can follow along.  This is one for the comic fans.  This cartoon was straight out of the comics!  They even had a scene where the Hulk's reflection was flashed in Wolverine's claws like the famous McFarlene cover!  The fight is brutal!  Wolverine is a complete animal and the hulk is giant!  Wolverine slices him and lets the blood fly!!!  The hulk is a monster and beats wolverine to a pulp, it just goes back and forth.

This movie also has some great appearances by Deadpool, Lady Deathstrike, Omega Red and Sabretooth.  They are done properly!  Sabretooth is a psycho like the comics, not the sniveling lackey they potray in the movies.  Deadpool is hilarious as well!  You even get to see Wolvie in his Weapon X gear.  They took a little leeway by adding all these characters to weapon x, but the fight were brutal.

This is a must have for marvel fans!  Finally a cartoon for fans of the comic, finally they nailed wolverine as well.  This is the best cartoon I have seen in a long long time!",1233619200,7,2607,4.511777301927195
3668216,5,B001KP2J2Q,"Worth every penny of the $14.95 I spent. The animation was very good. The stories were very good and it was everything that I want in a Marvel super hero animated movie(s).

3668217,5,B001KP2J2Q,"In my opinion, Hulk Vs. has to be Marvel Animation's crowning achievement, thus far. After 5 great direct-to-DVD features, it finally gives us (not one but two) features with the right amount of exciting comic-book storytelling, thrilling action and cutting-edge animation to bring every comic fan's dream to the small screen. This 2-disc DVD set features 'twice the carnage' with Hulk Vs. Wolverine and Hulk Vs. Thor.

Disc 1:Hulk Vs. Wolverine. This feature starts off with the two battling from the very beginning. You soon find out that The Hulk has been leaving a path of destruction all over the canadian countryside and he needs to be stopped at all costs. So, the government calls in the only man that can truly take on the green giant: Wolverine. That leads us back to the battle. Yet, members of the Weapon X program(Deadpool, Omega Red, Sabretooth, and Lady Deathstrike) are pursuing The Hulk as a means of turning him into a weapon(not only to destroy Wolverine but to use to their benefit). That's when things get nasty. The remainder of the feature has The Hulk & Wolverine battling them instead of each other, actually. Bonus features include:Audio Commentary, three featurettes(including a first look at Wolverine & The X-Men) and a trailer gallery. While the story was alright and it had its' moments, I still loved it. Seeing Hulk and Wolverine square off(at least, a little bit) was well worth it.

Disc 2:Hulk Vs. Thor. While Odin(Asgard's protector and ruler) is taking his winter slumber, Loki(Thor's evil stepbrother) decides to sieze the opportunity to bring Thor and Asgard to their knees by bringing The Hulk to Asgard. With the help of The Enchantress, Loki separates Bruce Banner from The Hulk and takes control of The Hulk's functions attempting to storm the kingdom. However, The Hulk isn't so easily controlled and he's soon creating chaos all his own. Loki soon realizes that his only recourse is to reunite The Hulk with Bruce Banner. Only Bruce is in Hela's Realm(or Hell, as I'm taking it) and it takes Loki and Thor both to bring them both back together to stop the Hulk from bringing Ragnarok down on Asgard and bringing about the end of days for the godly paradise. Bonus features here include:Audio Commentary, several featurettes, a first look at ""Thor:Tales of Asgard"" and a trailer gallery as well. You'll notice there is a different look to this feature. Hulk himself has longer hair, thicker limbs and a bigger body. I like this as it stands as its' own feature, even though it is part of a larger one. Overall, I loved this feature better(and I hate to admit it but I've never been a fan of Thor). It has a more epic feel to it and feels more cohesive in its' plot. There's more characters from Thor's universe here as well so it doesn't just center around the two.

You can tell Marvel Animation loves The Hulk as he has been in 4 of 6 of their animated efforts.

I really loved this Special Edition DVD set and look forward to Marvel Animation's coming projects. Here's hoping that they continue the VS. series in some way. I'd love to see The Hulk go up against some of Marvel's other characters(like The Thing, Wendigo, or Red/Grey Hulk).",1233360000,,3187,4.757685352622062
3668218,5,B001KP2J2Q,"Well, it looks like Marvel has finally hit it's animation groove.  After some solid 90's series, Marvel fell way behind while DC came out with a blitz of top-notch cartoons like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-The-Animated-Series/dp/B001CTXUTQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman - The Animated Series</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Justice-League/dp/B000CSTK3S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Justice League</a>&nbsp;that easily blew away the competition.  Straight to video releases from both comic giant have failed to be extraordinary.  That seems to have changed at least on Marvel's end. The glut of recent animated works that match the quality of blockbusters like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Iron-Man/dp/B00005JPS8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Iron Man</a>&nbsp;has this geek foaming at the mouth.  It seems as though Marvel has finally stopped trying to appease the masses and is giving the fans what they want.  And what we want is quality animation written by comic book writers and produced by genuine comic book geeks.  ""Hulk Vs"" consists of two (around) 40 minute films intended for hardcore fans that packs tons of action, creative direction, top-of-the-line voice acting, flawless representations of classic characters, and doesn't skimp on the violence either.  There are tons of references and homages to classic moments from the comics that are sure to please as well. This is what I want to see when I watch an animated comic book adaptation.  End of story.

The two discs in this set are divided one film plus bonus features for each DVD.  First up: Wolverine.  This is far and away the best of the two.  The true title should be ""Wolverine Is A Total Bada$z With The Coolest Villains And Plus He Fights The Hulk"".  Logan is sent in to take down The Hulk dead or alive.  ""Sounds like fun"" is his reply. The first encounter between the two icons is violent, bloody, and just plain sweet.  I'm talking knock-down, drag-out, stab a motherfudger in the heart, leap onto his back using adamantium claws to dig in and stabilize yourself, bashing somebody into the ground and keep on pounding, dislocated joints, blood everywhere, and the whole whammy.  Hard frickin' core.  And that's all before the bad guys show up.  Sabretooth ring a bell?  How about Omega Red?  Cool, right?  add a truly psychotic Lady Deathstrike to that mix.  Oh, and did I mention the animated debut of DEADPOOL, my very favorite character in all of comicdom?!  This guy makes this film for me even more than the awesome action scenes.  He is the Merc with the Mouth and he's exactly as he should be; wise-cracking, gun-blasting, trash-talking, and a$z-kicking.  If you don't laugh at him struggling to piece together his trisected arm (healing factor) while pitched battle rages around him you are a sad, sad person.  This is at least one fanboy's dream come true.  Other moments of note include Hulk's battle with Deathstrike (doesn't end so well for the cyborg assassin; you will wince) and the look on Sabretooth's face when he turns to see an especially angry Hulk bearing down on him full-tilt.
5 stars, easy.  And don't skip out on the credits, either.

The second disc is not nearly as amazing, but still geektacular and a first in that it takes place entirely in Asgard, home of the gods.  Here, the Allfather Odin sleeps his periodical slumber during which all of the evil hordes of the realm unleash their full might to attempt to take the kingdom while the king of the gods cannot defend it.  That's where our hero comes in, the God of Thunder himself, Thor Odinson.  Having sent the forces of evil packing yet again, the heroes of Asgard prepare for some rest and await Odin's awakening.  But Thor's evil half-brother Loki has one more trick up his sleeve. Combining his own magic with Enchantress's, he is able to bring Bruce Banner to Asgard, separate him from The Hulk, and place Big Green under his direct control. This is not really ""Hulk Vs Thor"" This is ""Hulk Vs. Asgard"".  Thor Odinson, verily thy might fared thee not well against the green behemoth's Fedoresque ground-and-pound.  This is awesome if you're a Hulk fan, and not so much if you are a Thor fan. Come on, the dude's a GOD.  Only cosmic entities should have near the juice to send him to death's door.  But hey, minor complaint.  We all know that these head-to-heads are little more than popularity contests anyways. Soon, Hulk breaks Loki's control and then he is everybody's problem.  Too bad the God of Mischief sent Banner to the underworld.  Now nobody can rein the monster in.  Not Volstagg, nor Fandral, Hogun, and Balder, not Sif and Enchantress put together or Asgard's entire army, not one Frost Giant and not two.  HULK SMASH EVERYONE!  Very cool, but more emphasis on Thor's power would have served the fans much better.
4 stars

Two animated comic book movies done right, one great price.  Don't be a dope; if you have any interest in comics whatsoever, buy it.  Special features include outstanding making-of featurettes for both, multiple commentaries for both, a tribute to Jack Kirby's groundbreaking work on the Thor comic, interviews and footage from the Comic-con premier of ""Hulk Vs. Wolverine"", and special looks at an upcoming animated Thor project and
""Wolverine and the X-Men"" which having seen the first 3 episodes I can safely say is the most exciting adaptation of the mutant superhero team yet. Every single one of these special features is well worth your time. This all adds up to my idea of a perfect set.

4 1/2 stars with bonus points for exceptional special features for a well-earned 5 stars.  Keep the quality coming!",1233360000,2,5772,5.195887445887446
3668219,1,B001KP2J2Q,"Very poor plot.  Not much of a story, but it is action pack.

It's hard to believe that Wolverine did better against the Hulk than Thor did, when in truth Thor is Marvel's most powerful superhero.  How many times did the Hulk took a licking from Thor in the comic book?  And how many times did Thor killed him?

Marvel is like WWE.  Whoever is the most popular wins, the other one becomes a heel.

Oh well, being a Marvel fan I would say buy it, but don't expect anything great.",1233360000,5,478,4.186813186813187
3668220,4,B001KP2J2Q,"*** and 1/2 stars actually.

Okay, first let me state I love almost all things comic book.  I read comics religeously when I was younger right up until about the time I turned 14 or so.  Around that time I got interested in filmmaking and videography and theatre.  I was always able to draw and design graphically so there was always a possibility that comics was a field for me to go into, but then filmmaking consumed my being.  Anyway, I tell you all this because I want to make clear that I can't stand fan-boys(those annoying little gnats who didn't like Spider-Man simply because his web-shooters were changed to being biological as opposed to made by him) and I haven't read a comic since the 90's.  I do love comic book movies, and am very happy they are practically a genre by themselves at this point, but I want a satisfying film experience, and not random crap that has nothing to do with the movie's arch, plot or character development just because comic nerds will have a joygasmn over it.  Movies are not books, they're not comics, they're not tv shows.  They're their own beast and create a whole other universe for familar and unfamilar characters alike to exist.

Okay, now onto Hulk VS.  This is purely for comic book nerds and fans.  There are very little backstories or character development momemts, why would there be, the fans already know all there is to know about the characters.  Luckily, the animation is so vivid and fun you can easily be dazzled and enjoy it.  I vaguley remember origins and plotlines from X-Men and Hulk, so I was fine, but those who have never picked up a comic but enjoyed Batman Begins, Iron-man or the Spider-man films may be lost.  I'm shocked the studio allowed this one to be made its so specific, but I like it.  It's ballsy to do something like that.  Hell, it still surprises how Kevin Smith was able make 6 films that were simply for a very specific group of fans and they were all loaded with obscure references and in-jokes.

Marvel Animation is hitting its stride and this, so far, is their crowning achievement.  They started getting good with Dr. Strange.  The animation was more alive and the storytelling more interesting.  Ultimate Avengers was pretty good, but the sequel was a little lackluster and boring.  Iron-Man was just dull and the CGI animaton didn't look good with the cell stuff.  Didn't see the Next Avengers, sorry but the idea of it just didn't appeal to me at all.

HULK VS. THOR
This is the best of the two, and I've never read a Thor comic beyond The Ultimate Avengers.  It had character development and actual drama.  Plus, we are take to the world of Asgard which is alien and obviously Norse influenced.  Thor was more than a brute but a hero with real conflict.  How the Hulk fits into the story is also original and not something I expected.  *MILD SPOILER*  Remember those comic covers with Bruce Banner and The Hulk sharing the image, well this short lets it happen and it's part of the plot.  A real good time.

HULK VS. WOLVERINE
Not as good as the Thor film, but who doesn't love Wolverine?  Wolverine is sublime considering that he is technically one of the weakest of the X-Men as far as powers go(considering Storm can control the weather).  But he is in a long line of American anti-heroes, despite the fact that he is from Canada, sort of.  This short is thin on plot, thinner on character development, but the action is mostly fun and it's laced with humor tracing back to origins that all Fan-Boys, past and current, will recall.  This was is pretty bloody for something rated PG-13, but the money sucking machine in Hollywood would never allow a comic book movie go out the door with an R rating, whether it deserves it or not(Yes, Fan Boys I'm aware of the three Punisher movies, Sin City and others).

So check it out.  Most will just want to rent.  Fans will want to own and love and snuggle with it, but us average joes, unless you're a huge animation buff, like myself, will want to just watch it once. Me, I enjoyed it for the fun fluff it was, but Fan-Boys will covet it and maybe even have no reason to complain on the internet...Nah, that'll never happen.",1233273600,,4168,4.5227272727272725
3668221,5,B001KP2J2Q,"This is the best DVD from Marvel animated to date! It is what it should be, like a comic book, fast pacing, action with great characters. The audio production is incredible with home theatre and it makes a big difference. I could only recommand this great Pop Corn movie for any Marvel Fans!",1233273600,,291,4.509433962264151
3668222,4,B001KP2J2Q,"I just had the opportunity to check out the new Marvel/Lionsgate direct-to-dvd animated film, ""Hulk Vs."" and was pretty pleased overall.

First off, unlike previous entries in the Marvel animated films, this one is NOT a regular feature-length presentation.  It instead consists of two separate and unrelated stories.  The artwork was either pretty darned good (Thor) or excellent (Wolverine).  The animation itself is extremely good.  The previews on the disc are for the new animated series ""Wolverine and the X-Men"" and the next animated dvd movie ""Thor: Tales of Asgard"", which looks brilliant and is due in September.

""Hulk Vs. Wolverine"" was the feature I enjoyed best but it had its weaknesses.  Its strengths are the characterization, the art and animation, and the beuatiful background paintings of the Canadian wilderness.  The weaknesses are that if you happen to be a casual viewer and are not familiar with the backstories of Wolverine and the Weapon X program, you will become lost very quickly.  There are a series of flashbacks that I felt were porly integrated into the story.  It was a little unclear (especially for casual viewers) that these were actually flashbacks and not occuring in real-time, thus causing a bit of confusion.  Also, to truly appreciate the villains (Sabretooth, Deadpool, Omega Red, and Lady Deathstrike), one needs to be familiar with them and their personalities from the comic books.  The action itself is brutal, violent, and non-stop--a hardcore beatdown that comic fans will love!

""Hulk Vs. Thor"" was also quite good, but I simply didn't enjoy it quite as much.  The animation, artwork, and characterizartion were all excellent, though.  I think my reaction is based on my own personal preference for darker material, which ""Hulk Vs. Wolverine"" dafinitely catered to.  In the Thor story, Asgard is (as it should be) bright, gleaming, and beautiful.  Again, the action is quite good, although not as brutal as in the previous tale.  Fans of the Marvel take on Norse mythology will be quite pleased as lots of mythical figures are featured and various realms of Asgard are visited.  Magic, myth, and even a bit of romance dominate this tale and the Hulk is as dangerous as ever, even against immortals.

I watched this with my wife, who has enjoyed most of the previous superhero movies, animated or otherwise.  The difference is that I am a comic fan who is familiar with the characters and their backstories and she is not.  So from an objective point of view, I can say that the ""Hulk Vs. Wolverine"" story left her a bit confused and unsatisfied.  She enjoyed the Thor storyline far better as it isn't quite so dependent on knowing the characters and their backstories.  She is also a great fan of fantasy and mythology, so Thor was right up her alley.

Because of the brutal violence (which includes dismemberment) in the Wolverine story, I wouldn't recomend it for kids under 12.  I would be comfortable showing the Thor story to kids of 5 or older.  Of course, you should know your own children's ability to handle and process action and violence in a healthy way, so I'm just mentioning my own assesment.  Take it for what it's worth to you.

Keep the excellent animated movies coming, Marvel!  Great job!

Cheers & enjoy!

3668223,4,B001KP2J2Q,"Well, yes.  Anyone expecting these short animated segments to be incredible might be disappointed.  I enjoyed them and felt they were worth what I paid for, which wasn't all that much.  They aren't as good as DC's New Frontier, but it was still pretty good for what it was.  The Wolverine short was the weaker of the two, in my opinion, but still worth it to see Wolverine slice through limbs while leaving a bloody trail.",1233187200,,422,4.5131578947368425
3668224,4,B001KP2J2Q,"Havent seen vs THOR yet, but vs WOLVERINE was amazing. But i have to say, most of the time is about WOLVERINE and his story in the weapon x project. we see that from the start, in the middle and at the end. Flashbacks of it all. Which means...( you guessed it) we don't see hulk much. So the title should have been weapon x or something else, i was hoping to see more of hulk. But don't get it wrong, WOLVERINE RULES, its the most violent, bloodiest cartoon incarnation of wolverine so far. A little hulk fight at the beginning, no hulk in the middle, and hulk by the end. The movie belonged to Wolverine, even if it says hulk vs wolverine. thats not bad, it just leaves you more anxious for the WOLVERINE MOVIE IN MAY.....too bad there wasn't enough hulk in w vs h, but the little i saw had enough action and blood to make anyone happy.

This is why I own stock in Marvel!  This is not for the youngersters....but teens and adults will love this disk.  Well worth the money!  The Thor episode was inpressive enough for me to even look forward to the live action flick that I believe is in the talks.,1233100800,,453,4.22093023255814
3668226,5,B001KP2J2Q,"First, let me say that the Blu-Ray version of this is crisp and clean. Gave me some minor issues loading at first but after I got those cleared up, it was smooth sailing.

The features themselves are not very long. I'll talk about them individually:

Hulk Vs. Wolverine - This was before his X-Men days as Wolverine was working for Department H. The Hulk invades Canada and Wolverine is sent to hunt him down to stop him or put him down for good. The fight between them is short but pretty violent. Wolvie even makes the Hulk bleed in this one!

Not a lot of plot to this adventure but we do get appearances from Wolverine's rogue gallery in the forms of Sabretooth, Lady Deathstrike, Omega Red and (most entertaining of all) Deadpool. Also, these guys explored Wolverine's time with the Weapon X project in a way that none of the animated series' could go (not even the classic '90's series) nor has the movies gone yet. Ending is unresolved but hey, this feature gave us what it should and that's a smash mouth donnybrook!

The Hulk Vs. The Mighty Thor - In this one, Loki (the step-brother of Thor) brings The Hulk to Asgard, seperates him from Banner and takes control of him in order to wreak havoc in the Kingdom of Asgard. But his plan backfires and now Thor (as well as Loki and all of Asgard) faces the full fury of a Banner-less, mindless Hulk! While not bloody as Hulk Vs. Wolverine, its no less violent as The Hulk does put a brutal beating at one point on Thor, nearly killing him! This one also has a bit more story to it than the previous feature.

There are also several features to this release. The most entertaining, to me, is the behind the scenes of both features as well as a tribute to Jack Kirby as it relates to Thor. There is also footage of Hulk Vs. Wolverine at one of the big Comic conventions.

Overall, I was happy with this release. I would not, however, recommend this to small children. This is definitely a feature that should only be viewed by teens and adults. It might be too intense for younger kids. Plus, there is brief language in Hulk Vs. Wolverine during their fight so if you are the kind of person that gets offended easily or is a Bible thumper, this isn't for you.

Its a great release overall.",1233100800,26,2242,4.400966183574879

The only problem I have is the abrubt ending. The running time is a little over 35 minutes and they could have expanded the ending another 3-5 minutes. Watch through the credits and it may answer the question to the ending though. The characters are true to comic form and for me personally, it was nice how Deadpool was depicted, hope Ryan can deliver the same quality performance...

3668230,4,B001KP2J2Q,"Marvel's latest D-T-DVD, a double-feature pitting the Hulk against, respectively, Wolverine and Thor; each is about the length of an animated series two-parter (around 40 minutes apiece), except (particularly in the case of the Wolverine one) much more violent.

Generally, I've not found Marvel's D-T-DVD stuff released so far to be that impressive, but these both really worked, in terms of what they set out to do.

Starting out, I'd say that the Hulk is really just kind of there in both stories; he's worked into the plot, but in both cases the writers basically hijacked the initial idea (Hulk vs. Wolverine, Hulk vs. Thor) to tell some other story. In Wolverine it's ""finally, we get to do an R-rated version of Weapon X"", and in Thor it's ""finally, we get to cram in absolutely every aspect of the Thor mythos that we have any interest in onto animation"" (which, given that there's both an animated series and a second D-T-DVD which is trailed here, may have been a bit unnecessary, but it's still good).

Part I:  Hulk vs. Wolverine

Basically a big fight scene. Wolverine is called in by Department H to deal with a rampaging Hulk, who has seemingly destroyed an entire town along the US-Canadian border. Wolverine tracks the Hulk down (not really knowing what he is at this point), fights him, and basically fights to a draw (this is the 70s-era version that Wolverine was created to fight), and then are captured by Weapon X (which apparently isn't associated with Department H here). This story is tied into the Wolverine and the X-Men cartoon, so Wolverine, Banner, Sabretooth, and Professor Thornton all have the same voice actors; also here are Lady Deathstrike, Omega Red, and Deadpool. Thornton wants Wolverine back in the program, but Deathstrike and Sabretooth would rather kill him, so they stab Thornton and, well, try to kill him. Big fight, etc. The attraction here is seeing ""claw people"" (as Hulk calls them) stab each other a lot with blood and stuff; Deadpool's quite funny.

Part II:  Hulk vs. Thor

Starting out, I'll say that fans of Thor who were expecting an epic throwdown between the two will be disappointed here; this might more accurately be titled ""Hulk walks all over Thor, and so Thor has to find some other way of stopping the Hulk"". I personally have never found the uber-godmoder Hulk all that interesting, but it's an established thing, so there you go; getting past that, the story's pretty good, and if you like Thor's world pretty everybody is here.

The story takes place during the yearly Odinsleep, when the All-Father rests and all the villains try to conquer Asgard because Odin is absurdly powerful and they've only got a chance when he's not there. Thor and co. beat up all comers, as usual (Thor's getting rather depressed by this endless cycle). Loki and Enchantress capture Bruce Banner, and turn him into the Hulk; Amora then pulls Banner out the Hulk (and Loki kills him), leaving only the incarnate rage (see Hulk #300 in the early 80s), with Loki pulling the strings. However, the rage becomes too much and breaks Loki's control, and Rage-Hulk is loosed and starts destroying everything. He beats up the Warriors Three and Balder, then pummels Thor to death (to Loki's delight), and heads off towards the city; Hela is about to claim Thor's soul, but Enchantress intervenes and brings him back to life, since her whole motivation for helping Loki was she was angry that Thor chose Sif over her. Thor and Enchantress capture Loki, and Thor makes Loki go with him to Hel to reclaim Banner to put him back in the Hulk, and sends Enchantress to help Sif, who's the End Boss guarding Odin. So Thor and Loki journey thither, while Hulk punches his way through like a bajillion random guards, Brunnhilde and the other Valkyries, etc. on his way there.

As a tour of the Nine Worlds, it packs quite a lot into 40+ minutes (it's the longer of the two); both of these stories just drop you into an established world, which is refreshingly different from how a lot of these films do things; you pick up all the necessary information as you go along.

All in all, it's a good package; less character or plot than big fights, but the short lengths of each piece means that they don't overstay their welcomes.",1233014400,2,4257,4.739189189189189
3668231,5,B001KP2J2Q,"I was skeptical when I heard that Marvel was releasing another animated feature, but seeing as it involved the Hulk going up against two of my favorite Marvel characters, I gave it the benefit of the doubt.

And it didn't disappoint.

I just finished Hulk vs Wolverine this morning and can't express how much I enjoyed it. With an epic fight scene between Logan and Banner, followed up with a cameo appearance by Deadpool,what's not to like? I was hooked during the first few moments and couldn't look away for the next 27 minutes.

I'm currently in the process of watching Hulk vs Thor, ten minutes in to be precise. I'm a big fan of Thor and his legendary exploits, so I'm certain that I won't be let down.

I highly recommend this DVD for any Marvel fan looking for a fun viewing experience.",1232496000,6,794,4.493055555555555
3668232,4,B001KP2J2Q,Wow! The Hulk looks way more hard in this than both of his theatrical releases! Great action on both but The Thor battle is clearly the best as he is forced to do battle in Hell!! You check out why! 4/5!,1232409600,,203,3.975609756097561
3668233,4,B001KP2J2Q,"I have to totally agree.  The Hulk vs. Wolverine is too short.  I am a huge Wolverine fan, and the action and story line were well received by me, but it could've gone on longer.  Didn't watch the Hulk vs. Thor yet.  Not really a Thor fan.",1232150400,2,239,4.0212765957446805
3668234,4,B001KP2J2Q,"As a superhero fan, I was going to watch this regardless, but after the lackluster animated releases Marvel has put out so far, I didn't have my expectations set too high.

However, Hulk Vs. is by far the best animated Marvel film yet.  I think the fact that they split them up into 2 approx. half hour shorts helped tremendously, keeping the plot moving and the action tight.  Both episodes felt like they could've easily been a stand-alone issue of a comic book, with all the heroes keeping in character.

Hulk Vs. Wolverine is the standout, and sets a new standard in brutal cartoon violence (for a PG-13 rating of course).  We are treated to some great Wolverine back-story, right out of the Weapon X storyline, some hardcore Wolverine vs. Hulk fighting (which seemed like a combo of Wolverine's first appearance in the Hulk comic and the more recent Ultimate Hulk vs. Wolverine mini-series) and some great appearances by fan-favorite villains like Sabretooth, Omega Red, Lady Deathstrike, and Deadpool.

Hulk Vs. Thor was surprisingly entertaining, but being as I'm not that much of a Thor fan, I enjoyed the Wolverine story more.  That's not to say this wasn't a good episode, and I ultimately enjoyed it more than I expected.  Both films had excellent animation and fantastic voice-work.  Good writing, all by people who were obvious fans of the core material.

I highly recommend Hulk Vs.  It's two great stand-alone episodes that seem like they could be part of a larger universe.  Hopefully Marvel realizes this and begins adapting popular comic book arcs like Secret Invasion, Secret War, or Spider-Man Reign...",1231977600,20,1622,4.944649446494465
