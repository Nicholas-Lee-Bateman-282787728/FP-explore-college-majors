174689,5,0988187477,"This is AWESOME!  Natural 1 continues with the stories told in Gamers:Dorkness Rising and Gamers:Hands of Fate but using a Shadowrun type game.  Although it is not quite as good as Gamers:Dorkness Rising, i rate it equal to Hands of Fate.  I just wish it were longer.

The real treat and reason anyone who plays RPGs should buy this is Humans and Households.  We are used to regular people playing characters like a Thief, Warrior, Mage or Cleric.  In H&H, it is a ""real"" Thief, Warrior, Mage and Cleric playing characters in our regular world.  A nobleman is the ""DM"" and leads them on their harrowing adventure in our world.  They are used to facing dangers like dragons, bands of orcs but they have some trouble facing --- crossing a street or checking a mailbox.  Thanks to great writing and acting, this will have any role-player rolling on the floor in laughter.  My personal favorite is the Mage who plays a ""liberal activist"" who frequently lights a ""cigarette"" (or joint) to cast ""fog of inspiration"" or ""fog of protection"" or ""fog of whatever"".

If you have ever enjoyed one of the Gamer movies, you will absolutely love this!",1419724800,4,1136,4.686868686868687
7795312,4,0988187477,I thought it was great with some comic parts the players played at instead of like most people playing they take it to serious like it was real and not for the fun time your supports to have with friends and family members.,1473465600,,223,4.209302325581396
7795313,4,0988187477,"I'm biased as being a large fan of the various Zombie Orpheus productions and a long time gamer, so I ""get it"".
If you're a gamer, it's excellent. If you're not a gamer, you'll probably give it 1 star and complain.",1472169600,,214,4.2439024390243905
7795314,5,0988187477,"D&D, from a different perspective, I'd also title it ""What if we acted in real life the way we do in D&D"". An entertaining and highly comical take on typical D&D stereotypes with a twist.",1471219200,,187,4.371428571428571
7795315,5,0988187477,excellent,1470096000,,9,9.0
7795316,2,0988187477,The premise is better then the reality. I will never get back the time I watched Humans and Households.  The other short story was much better. ..but still lacking.,1462320000,,164,4.655172413793103
7795317,4,0988187477,"This is actually two features in one. Households and Humans looks at what happens when fantasy adventurers role-play in the world of dire autos and friendly dogs with unexpectedly funny results. My favorite part of this was the very insightful political satire. Well done!

The main movie on this DVD is a spinoff of the Gamers when one of the party members sister is potentially marrying -gasp- a non-gamer. The suitor must be put through ""the gaming gauntlet."" It's cute.",1449964800,2,473,4.9125
7795318,5,0988187477,This is a movie trip for anyone who games.  it juxtaposes reality with the gamer mentality.  It is good for a humorous evening.,1449014400,,127,4.478260869565218
7795319,5,0988187477,This movie (series?) is hilarious and we quote it constantly. Ready for more anytime they want to drop it.,1443312000,,106,4.631578947368421
7795320,5,0988187477,I hope they make more of these in the future! Keep up the good work!,1427241600,,68,3.6
7795321,5,0988187477,"This is a very imaginative and hilarious take on gaming where ""real life"" adventurers are playing everyday people in a role reversal of the common gamer experience. The shock of modern day for these players is a riot! From the confusion of the ""magical barrier"" (crosswalk) and ""mystical colored orbs"" (streetlights) over the roadway to the ""monsters"" with people trapped inside them (cars), this makes every commonplace thing in our lives something of mystery and peril for these ""adventurers"". It's a funny and wacky adventure that gamers are sure to enjoy.",1424736000,,559,5.153846153846154
