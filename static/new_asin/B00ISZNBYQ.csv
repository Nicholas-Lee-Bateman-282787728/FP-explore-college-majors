6291164,5,B00ISZNBYQ,"I love Lumpy Space Princess (LSP!), so of course I bought this DVD as soon as I saw her on the cover! Episode ""Bad Timing"" is primarily about Lumpy Space Princess and her hang-up on her ex-boyfriend Brad. (They used to eat chili cheese fries together, in case you didn't know.) I'm not sure how many little kids can identify with LSP and her boyfriend woes, but I personally find ""Adventure Time"" pretty therapeutic. (I'm in my 30's and I could use more light-hearted fun...) I would also argue that ""Love Games"" is probably the funniest episode ever. Finn agrees to help Slime Princess keep her kingdom out of the reach of her ""much hotter, younger sister"" Blargatha who wants to militarize the place. Finn and Slime Princess must enter a competition against Blargatha and her mysterious husband Guillermo to determine which couple is ""most truly in love."" The spooning scene...oh my gosh, I laughed so hard. It is HYSTERICAL!!!",1408060800,5,929,4.8125
6291165,3,B00ISZNBYQ,"This compilation DVD was disappointing.  I had seen only a few episodes of Adventure Time so I was not familiar with all the episodes on this DVD.  I was expecting episodes about the various princesses but only about half of the episodes featured a princess.  I love Finn and Jake and all the episodes on this DVD but I was expecting more princesses.  Some of the episodes don't feature any princesses at all.  For example, ""Her Parents"" is about when Jake meets Lady Rainicorn's parents and ""Beautopia"" is about Finn and Susan Strong.

If you are a Lumpy Space Princess fan and were expecting lots of LSP episodes, you will be sadly disappointed.  ""Princess Day"" and ""Bad Timing"" are the only two LSP episodes on this DVD.  ""Trouble in Lumpy Space"" and ""To Cut a Woman's Hair"" would have been a better additions to a DVD about the Adventure Time princesses than ""Jake Suit"" or ""Her Parents.""",1407888000,2,892,4.6369426751592355

8645173,3,B00ISZNBYQ,"I wish I could rate this higher but I noticed a lot of the episodes seem to have a lot of problems with the audio cutting in and out. I don't exactly enjoy trying to watch this with my kid when the audio cuts out. I found this one was pretty bad as well as the other short they made before. When the audio cuts out it was usually during important parts or in the case of one episode I think we heard one whole minute of audio out of ten minutes of silence. It grew old pretty fast so I ended up taping Adventure Time on my DVR so I can skip the audio problems and will wait for season four to come out.
I found a lot of audio problems lately with Adventure Time dvd. I don't know if anyone else has had these troubles with the DVDs. I love Adventure Time and I hate to bring it down to a three star rating but I paid $20 for this and it shouldn't have these problems. I think I will just buy instant videos if we want to collect anymore or keep taping on the DVR!",1413504000,,963,3.8686868686868685
