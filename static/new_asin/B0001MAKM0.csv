8014518,3,B0001MAKM0,"I knew that it was a short film but I would have liked more for the amount of money I paid for it.  Regardless, I have it for my Star Trek collection.  Enjoyed the subtle Star Trek images.",1438300800,,188,3.9210526315789473
8014519,4,B0001MAKM0,I have given this DVD only 4 stars because it was too short!!! Excellent fun. Tongue in cheek. Good to see some of the actors again. Must have for all Trekkies.,1125532800,,160,4.193548387096774
8014520,3,B0001MAKM0,"The cast of Star Trek salute Gene Roddneberry's life as a policeman seeking inspiration for a sci-fi series he's writing. The story is vaguely similar to ""George Lucas In Love"" and I am surprised no one got sued.
It has it's fun moments. The outakes are hilarious though.",1089590400,2,271,4.666666666666667
8014521,1,B0001MAKM0,"I'm surprised to see so many favorable comments on this insipid DVD. I thought it was a total waste of my money, 17 minutes of sheer stupidity (that's right, a 17-minute movie for the price of a full-length feature). There's nothing clever about this so-called parody, and barely anything that's even halfway funny. A Star Trek parody is a wonderful idea, but this idea fails miserably in its execution.
Don't waste your money on this DVD.",1088726400,6,439,4.7894736842105265
8014522,5,B0001MAKM0,This movie takes Star Trek to a new level!  Just when you thought this franchise was almost dead someone comes up with a fresh and funny story.  The only thing that I found wrong with this movie is it should have been a full length feature.  The outtakes were just as good as the movie.  I hope we see more from these guys.  Paramount should hire these guys to do Enterprise it would be allot better.,1079654400,6,400,4.2105263157894735
8014523,5,B0001MAKM0,"Though skeptical of parodies in general, This parody was excellent. Very well done and hilarious. Seeing  Star Trek actors saluting The Great Bird Of The Galaxy is Excellent.
The idea of creating characters from the characters you meet in everyday life on the streets is inspirational.
The Great Bird would be proud.",1078963200,10,316,5.076923076923077
8014524,5,B0001MAKM0,"This was a great DVD and the writing was very clever. Every time I watch it, I catch a new joke or Star Trek reference that I missed.  It was great seeing so many Star Trek actors participate in the filming; it really added something special.  Ethan Phillips scene was hysterical and the ending was perfect!  I especially enjoyed how they incorporated the star trek music and star trek sounds into the scenes. The outtakes were as funny as the DVD. Even my husband who is not a star trek fan enjoyed it.  Great tribute to the Great Bird of the Galaxy. Very enjoyable and entertaining; I highly recommend.",1078790400,7,604,4.513761467889908
8014525,5,B0001MAKM0,"Short but sweet would be the ideal way to describe the very funny Star Trek parody RODDENBERRY ON PATROL.
Directed by Tim Russ this delightful short film features a who's who of Star Trek talent:  Walter Koenig, Nichelle Nichols, George Takei, Robert Beltran, Bob Picardo, Ethan Phillips, Robert O'Reilly, Tim Russ and Richard Herd.
When most people hear the word parody they usually think really obvious in your face humor.  RODDENBERRY ON PATROL is much wittier than your average parody and the production values are outstanding.  The fantastic writing of Tom Mason and Dan Danko is clever and subtle.  It's the kind of droll good-natured humor that never grows old.  This is a film you'll watch again and again, a must for every fans DVD library.",1078790400,8,749,4.912698412698413
8014526,5,B0001MAKM0,"This is a very funny parody of how the ""Great Bird of the Galaxy"" came up with some of his ideas for Star Trek. Extremely good production values and surprise appearances by folks like Nichelle Nichols, Walter Koenig, Robert Picardo, Robert Beltran, and Ethan Phillips (who is hilarious), as well as director Tim Russ (and the familiar voice of George Takei at the end). The DVD also comes with a very strange short film called ""Life 2.0"" that's very Twilight Zone in flavor, as well as outtakes from ""Roddenberry on Patrol."" A nice tribute.",1078704000,2,540,4.75531914893617
