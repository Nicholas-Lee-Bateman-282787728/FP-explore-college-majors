522751,3,6302804744,"This movie is frustrating because it could have been so much better.  The actors, setting, story all had so much possibility, but none were developed to their potential.  I was particularly disappointed that the role played by Clint Walker was so minimal.",1360713600,4,255,5.0476190476190474
522752,1,6302804744,"I just saw this movie (Maya) over Amazon on October 30th 2011 to gift my Dad, it was $38.00 and on November 1st, 2011 it is $65.00!!.
Is amazon trying to legally rob me ? :-)
or is this how amazon makes money !!
Guess I have to go for some other of his childhood movies.",1320019200,2,270,3.8392857142857144
522753,5,6302804744,"As a Kid we never went on Vacations, so I had to live vicariously through others who did. I remember seeing this movie when I was about 9 or 10. I went ""with him"" through his adventure in India. I was enchanted by how different people could be from us.
It was a fun kids movie with two heroes, Jay North and his Dad, Clint Walker.
It is well worth the money if you can find it.",1259971200,14,377,3.909090909090909
522754,5,6302804744,"Maya, a story of searching employs multi-direction themes but these all are arising from a root of need in the heart. We can seek excitement or adventure which Maya possesses but our lives call for a transfer of personal confidence and reliance in childhood to self awareness and integrity of manhood. A child knows his wants and can muster courage, but nothing as a life and death struggle in the wilds of India demands. A best friend is required that exceeds the guidance of a father. Maya, the elephant has its mahut Raji as the ready soulmate for Terry. Boyhood is surrendered in friendship and with this change Terry out grows his losses. He becomes what he needs to be because his new brother needs him as much as he is needed. A story that will touch every viewer differently, Maya will touch the soul!",1247097600,5,809,4.586206896551724
522755,5,6302804744,"This film should get five stars for scenery alone.  I enjoyed the romp though the jungle with Jay North and his friend.  Clint walker played the dad and very true to character.

522769,5,6302804744,"For dog lovers you have Lassie. For Horse lovers you have The Black Stallion.  And for Elephant lovers nothing can compare to Maya!!!  This is a epic motion picture that is much more than a coming of age story of to young boys, it covers the gambit of human & animal emotions all during a thrill ride of action and adventure in the stunningly beautiful jungles of India!  I discovered this movie on T.C.M. only catching the ending and the action sequence of Maya the mother of a sacred white baby Elephant was in a full pitched battle with some Tigers. My friend & I just looked at each other & said WOW!!!  I don't know how this movie has escaped me for all these years it was obviously popular enough to spawn a T.V. series...but that's life.  I was quite young & I don't think this movie was shown very often while I was growing up, but the ending alone prompted me to search it out on Amazon.com & I am so glad to add this gem to my movie collection!  It fits in quite nicely in my ""Jungle Adventure"" section.  There's a lot going on in this movie, the young American boy's bravery is spawned more out of him being nave, while the young Indian boy is so aware of the dangers of fulfilling his fathers dying request to deliver a sacred White Elephant a crossed the jungle he is convinced his task will end in his death...now there's some courage for you!  And the young American boy's father is forced to face his fear that he has lost his courage after a near fatal Tiger attack!!!  And all this courage is spawned by love.  A son's love for a father that passed away, a father's love for a son he just met & Maya's love for her baby Elephant.  This is a fast paced adventure the whole family will enjoy.",1445472000,3,1708,4.256965944272446

522787,5,6302804744,"Oct. 1st, 2014 12:56pm  This is a very sad movie, but it is worth watching and a very good learning movie for children, who think they can do anything they want to!!!! The young in India back in those days, I guess are taught more about responsibility to the family, and this young boy Raji[Sajid Kahn] was doing as his father told him to do!!!! But the young American boy-Terry Bowen[Jay North] thought he knew better, which caused many problems for Raji and the mother Elephant-Maya and the Baby Elephant, because Terry thought he knew best for the baby Elephant!!!! And Good Learning Video for young people as well as all people!!!! Like I said it is a very sad movie!!!! But Good!!!!  Polar 2[Eya-Andrea]",1412121600,3,708,4.656

522792,3,6302804744,Maya is not what I expected considering there was my idol Clint Walker and he did indeed play a different role & was no Cheyenne but he was not in it as much as I would like because the story revolves around his son [in the movie] and another little boy on an adventure. Not quite my favorite genre. It will be enjoyable to children so it is worth buying and watching. Oh and believe it or not it is not at all a western.,1404518400,,421,3.9647058823529413

7832252,3,6302804744,"Maybe the best known feature film that 1960s TV show Dennis The Menace actor Jay North starred in(and later, a TV version of Maya). He was 15 at the time of filming in India in 1966. The story begins with Jays' character traveling to India to visit his father(portrayed by actor Clint Walker). Due to some actions perpetrated by his father, Jays' character leaves his dads home and begins an adventure in parts of India, eventually joining an Indian teenager(Indian actor Sajid Khan) and exploring parts of the country together. Today, this film would play out as a cable after-school special. Parents who are prone to sheltering their kids from 'shocking' content will need to know that one animal is shot in a scene, and in one scene where the Indian teen rescues Jays' character from river rapids, Jay is seen with his back to the camera with all his clothes removed so as to dry off and put on a dry Indian-style brief.",1482451200,,923,4.634146341463414
7832253,1,6302804744,"This is a terrible movie.  It has poor acting (mostly on Jay North's part), and a sappy script.  Some of the scenery is good, but there is very little of redeeming value in this movie.  It is a definite waste of time, unless you are a Jay North fan.  Please don't waste your time or money on this.  Clint Walker's impact in this film is small.",1473984000,,343,4.136363636363637
7832254,5,6302804744,"Watching this made me want the series, which I now have as well. The beginning of the series and this, do not agree on how Maya and the two boys met. I still love both however.",1472774400,,176,3.9166666666666665
7832255,4,6302804744,"I saw this movie on TV  decades ago. I was approximately  10 years old.  It  already  was no longer in theaters.
I liked the movie in the  respect that it  depicted  a young boy's coming of age and  as he and  another boy of a different culture traveled on  a mission to bring  a baby elephant to a temple. Of course it is typical for kids to live out their fantasies of  travel and  adventure through such movies  made for young people.  It is why  the genre of such  children's movies exist.  Yet the movie  had a sad ending overall.
Spoiler alert:
The adult elephant who is the mother of the baby elephant  and who literally carries the boys on her back and saves them from danger, eventually dies  a rather violent death.
I know that  ironically back  in the  earlier 1960s and the decades before,  children's movies  actually had a lot of violence and scary scenes (Wizard of OZ, Roy Rogers  westerns, etc),  and MAYA  would still be considered a kid's movie, but  I would say that  very young kids ought not watch if they are sensitive  to animal suffering  like I was.",1469404800,,1075,4.371134020618556

7832257,5,6302804744,I first saw this movie when I lived in India in 1966 and it just brings memories back to me of my childhood. A very good adventure movie for kids of all ages.,1460073600,,158,3.8181818181818183
