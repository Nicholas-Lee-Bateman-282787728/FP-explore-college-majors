8367236,5,B002EAYEE2,"This is one of the finest films I have ever seen. The story is stunning, the on-location production is flawless. I don't normally watch silent films, but I'm glad I watched this one, The Temptress. It still haunts me, particularly the finish, which had me wondering until the last frames if she had changed her ways.

May I recommend the 1926 New York Times review, if I've failed to recommend it highly enough? Their review is much more eloquent than I.",1440633600,,454,4.604938271604938
8367237,4,B002EAYEE2,"MGM Studio picked Ibanez's novel for Greta Garbo's second film and assigned her Swedish mentor Mauritz Stilter as the director. But his slow working methods were reminiscent of recently fired Erich von Stroheim, therfore MGM quickly replaced him with Fred Niblo. The script was built around Garbo as a wicked and seductive woman with no morals. She attracted men like bees and then disgraced them, and drove some of them to suicide and murder and then led herself to the gutters. Her victims are Lionel Barrymore, Rory D'Arcy and Marc MacDermott. The story is a little depressing but Garbo looks as beautiful as ever. This movie produced much publicity and her next film with MGM Studios ""Flesh and the Devil"" released few months after Temptress exploded the box-office records. If you are fan of Greta Garbo, then you would certainly like this movie.",1417651200,,851,4.958041958041958
8367238,5,B002EAYEE2,"In his novel 'La Tierra de Todos' (The Land of All), the Spanish author Vicente Blasco Ibez sets up the mind ( personified by an architect) against the body (the beauty of the temptress), and, social order (a workforce to build, here, a dam) against anarchy (a renegade leader and his band).
For the author, males who fight with their bodies against (young) female bodies are condemned (go bankrupt).
The architect (Order) fights also against the band leader (Anarchy) in the Argentine way: with a whip in an arena in the form of a circle.

Based on this novel, Fred Niblo shot a most memorable movie with spectacular scenes (the destruction of a dam), brutal bloody fights, a masked ball and, most impressive of all, the heavenly (satanic) beauty of a young Greta Garbo.
Will the body (the temptress) vanquish the mind? The ultimate encounter between the two doesn't turn into a happy end.
This movie, with Greta Garbo in one of her best roles, is a must see for all film buffs.",1373328000,3,979,4.658959537572255
8367239,4,B002EAYEE2,"the Temptress is a very early Greta Garbo movie, that is silent and she plays a bad woman then known as a vamp. She is in her early 20s and looks amazing. I have loved her sense high school 40 years ago. She is why I collect movie books and videos and dvds. The first night I shaw Garbo was a rainy night and they were showing on tv Camille. She acted and moved like she was a contemporary actress, every one else moved like they were in an old time movie. She was magical. I started reading about her, I now own 50 biographies on her, she became my movie obsession. I am now missing only one movie of hers which has never come out in vhs or dvd...that is the Torrent. I have seen it once on TCM and next time it airs I will tape it. The one concern that I have with this dvd is, it will only play on a dvd player, not a dvd recorder. So I have to play it on my computer and not on my big screen tv. But all of the Warner archives are that way, so it is better than not having it at all.",1294444800,2,987,3.796116504854369
8367240,2,B002EAYEE2,"The Temptress is a very good Garbo film. So good, in fact, that it is already available on pressed DVD in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TCM-Archives-The-Garbo-Silents-Collection-The-Temptress-Flesh-and-the-Devil-The-Mysterious-Lady/dp/B0009S4IKG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TCM Archives - The Garbo Silents Collection (The Temptress / Flesh and the Devil / The Mysterious Lady)</a>. That set gives you this film plus two other films including Garbo's star-making role in ""The Flesh and the Devil"". If you are curious about Garbo, start with this set that costs only a few dollars more than this plain vanilla DVD-R with no extras. If you see Garbo for the first time in one of her sound films you'll wonder what the big to-do is about. You have to see her transition from young girl to woman on the silent screen to really get an appreciation for the artistry of this old soul.

The Warner Archives have been especially great for enabling silent film buffs to get copies of films we would otherwise never see in a pressed DVD release. However, this one is already available in a sturdier format, so I don't know why Warner Brothers did this. I know of no other Warner Archive entry that duplicates a previously pressed DVD release.

The film is excellent. My rating of 2/5 stars is compounding the film with the fact that this is not a good value given what is already commercially available.",1253059200,2,1436,5.377777777777778
