4509899,5,B004ZKKL1O,"Finally, Angry Beavers on dvd! If it wasn't for Shout! Factory we probably still have to buy those expensive burn on demand dvds! We have been asking Nickelodeon for the longest time to release Angry Beavers, Rocko's Modern Life, Aahhh! Real Monsters, Hey Arnold on dvd, and now Shout! Factory has the rights to put them on dvd in 2011! Thanks Nickelodeon...

In early 2011, JcPenny stores nationwide started selling Rocko's Modern Life, Hey Arnold & Angry Beaver t-shirts, and i thought this was pretty strange when i saw these at JCPenny in March, but growing up in the 90's i had to purchase these shirts, and then i find out Rocko, Arnold and Angry Beavers getting released on dvd! Is this just a big coincidence that they started making t-shirts all of a sudden then a dvd release? I think not!

And Teenick is airing a block called 90's is all that with classic Nickelodeon shows like All That, Kenan & Kel, Clarissa Explains it All, etc in October 2011, however the date was moved up to July 25, 2011 from midnight to 4AM (Eastern time) as Kenan Thompson is promoting the new block with the big orange couch on a new tv ad. This is little too much to take in all at once, but at least 'WE THE FANS' are getting heard! I'm only 23 but i grew up in 90's, and the stuff out today is too watered down, censored & has no edge or creative like the 90's shows & music. I Miss The 90's! Now i can re-live my childhood with these dvds! I wish Nickelodeon was create a ""Classic Nick"" or ""Rewind Nick"" network that's shows nothing but classic Nickelodeon shows & cartoons of the 90's! Or take out Nick-At-Nite that airs on Nickelodeon and use the space to show classic 90's Nickelodeon shows.

I would like to see a dvd release for Doug, Rugrats, Cousin Skeeter, Kenan & Kel, All That in the near future! And hopefully Shout can finish releasing the rest of Clarissa Explains it All (Season 2-) & The Secret World of Alex Mack (Season 2-) on dvd. Let's just hope they finish releasing the other 2 seasons of Angry Beavers & the other Nickelodeon show Shout has the rights too!

4509933,5,B004ZKKL1O,I loved watching this cartoon with my kids! I just had to get the DVD when I saw it. One of my favorite episodes is when Norbert keeps getting knocked into last week by Daggot.

4509935,5,B004ZKKL1O,"I recently got this DVD set for my birthday last year, and it has been enjoyable. My entire family and I have enjoyed ""The Angry Beavers"" since its premiere on Nickelodeon in 1997. With new members having recently been added to our family, I have shown this to my younger cousins and their friends. They have been amazed and are constantly asking for more! Overall, The Angry Beavers is/was a great show and 1 of my all-time favorite cartoons when I was growing up! If you were ever a die-hard fan of this series like I was, you should consider buying this DVD and the later DVDs of said show! Kids of today's generation will enjoy this, compared to the spooty shows that Nickelodeon has today (like iCarly)!! The hilarious antics of Norbert and Daggett Beaver will make you laugh your beaver tail off hard!!",1350000000,2,808,4.5793103448275865

4509939,5,B004ZKKL1O,I absolutely loved this show when it was on the air. There are great cartoons that have wonderful animation and great voice acting along with funny gags and this is by far one of my favorites. Norm and Dags voices are spot on and the animation was done so well for a show made back in the day. Im happy to see this series come out- I love the fact that there is a play all feature for the epidsodes and a choose an episode section as well. My only complaint is that there are no extras on the dvd with the exception of some trailers for other cartoon series and a single episode of a cartoon from the Shout Factory catalog. I would have loved to see interviews from the voice talent and the creator of the show- however this complaint is rather minor- a great show well done that the entire family can enjoy,1339632000,,807,4.17948717948718

4509956,5,B004ZKKL1O,"A cartoon series that both children and adults will enjoy. This series is just plain fun! The Angry Beavers really aren't angry. They're brothers who get into all kinds of hijinks. One of their favorite pastimes is watching 50's B science fiction movies. The episode I'm watching right now is ""The Day The Earth Got Really Screwed Up"" which is a take off of the classic ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"". Peter Graves, Adrienne Barbeau, and William Schallert (The Patty Duke Show) lend their vocal talents. Another great release from Shout! Factory. The only negative is no extras.",1324425600,3,579,4.858585858585859

It's a parody, it's a buddy movie, it's slapstick, it's an homage to campy pop culture, it makes kids and adults laugh until strange things fly out of their noses. I have seen bits and pieces of the elusive Nick slam episode that was never broadcast and is supposedly the reason Nick sat on the DVD release for so long (not a Fanboy, just naturally curious). Could be myth, could be the truth, who knows? Whatever happened, someone woke up, smelled the stuffed jalapenos and made a whole bunch of people very, very happy. Now they need to get their act together and release the rest of the Norb and Daggy oeuvre.",1322697600,4,756,4.525547445255475
4509958,5,B004ZKKL1O,"First of all, this cartoon rocks! Secondly, this dvd rocks! Four discs of pure fun, and that wonderful road down memory lane of the 90s. Angry Beavers is a very clever and creative cartoon. Its hilarious and full of jokes in jokes. The dvd itself is pretty awesome! The first two seasons on a four disc set, you cant beat that!",1320537600,3,327,4.377049180327869

I remember this show like it was yesterday! Growing up in the '90's, we had some of the best shows and The Angry Beavers was one of those shows that I remember very clearly. But anyway, I think this is an amazing set. If you are a '90's kid looking for some nostalgia (my main reason for buying this) or a parent looking for a great cartoon for your kid(s) to watch, I definitely recommend this series. A great cartoon for all ages!

The only con I can think of in this set is that some of the episode listing on the back of the DVD case are not in the correct order as they are on the DVD. For example, on episode 9, it's listed as ""House Broken/Stinky Toe"". On the DVD, it's listed in the correct order, ""Stinky Toe/House Broken"". I guess as long as the episodes are in the correct airdate order, that's all that really matters.

Let's hope that Shout! Can give us a complete Season 3 set soon!",1318032000,8,2359,4.534117647058824

4509961,5,B004ZKKL1O,"Nickelodeon during the mid 1990s was a special place. While the network fancied itself a children's network, it was also a place where bizarre and inexplicable cartoons found a home. Two angry beavers was one of those genuinely quirky and difficult to define cartoons. Smart, genre crashing and purely entertaining, Two Angry Beavers was, in my opinion, a game changer in the 90s.

With how beloved this cartoon was, it surprised me when I found out it was never released on DVD or Blu-Ray. Well, lo and behold,  one day I check my email and out of the blue the creepy mind-reading division at Amazon.com apparently knew I wanted this DVD collection and offered me a pre-order. I took advantage and placed my order. The DVD was officially released on a Tuesday and by Friday I had it in my hands.

I was very pleased with the overall experience, from the nicely discounted price to the eerie foresight that Amazon.com executed in its recommendation of the DVD. The quality of the DVD is pretty good and it was neat to wax nostalgic for a little while. The five star rating applies to both the Angry Beavers' DVD and Amazon.com",1316736000,2,1126,4.648241206030151
4509962,5,B004ZKKL1O,It's a great way to help remember when I used to be a kid.  It was delivered very quickly and it is going to make a great christmas gift.,1316390400,,137,3.7241379310344827
4509963,4,B004ZKKL1O,"Growing up in the mid and late 1990's, I was huge fan of almost every Nicktoon Nickelodeon put out. A decade or two later I have to question what in the hell happened to good, *original* Nicktoons and why it took so long for Nickelodeon to release this massive backlog of material. Sorry Nickelodeon, no matter how you try and bill it Dragon Ball Z Kai will never be a true ""Nicktoon"" nor will any of these other cartoons you have based off brain-dead movie IPs. Real ""Nicktoons"" aren't transplants from other stations or comics. Real Nicktoons are what you're releasing with these sets from Shout Factory and I will line up around the corner to buy these over anything you produce today.

As high as my standards may be for what constitutes a Nicktoon, even I can't say these cartoons have survived the years completely unscathed. As sure as I was that something like Rocko's Modern life would be as good as it was back in 1996, current realities where more than enough to snap me out of my nostalgia filled bliss. Don't get me wrong, these shows are still great but they're being viewed by a much older viewer and it's obvious that some episodes and seasons are simply better than others. The Angry Beavers Seasons 1&2 set is no different, although my experience with it has been a bit more favorable than some of the other releases.

Season one starts out extremely well on the first disc but some trouble starts brewing even before season two takes the stage. Some of these episodes have rather bizarre settings and characters. While there isn't an episode I'd flat-out call a failure, I usually crave the episodes (like ""You Promised!"") where things are a bit more streamlined. Still, the series generally makes up for its low points with the elements that make up its world like the cheesy black and white horror movies that Dag and Norbert are always watching, something that's cleverly given its own episodes with the excellent ""Food of the Clods"" and ""The Day the Earth Got Really Screwed Up.""

That said I'm eager to own all these sets despite how time has slightly changed my perception of these cartoons. It's not always easy to dive in and enjoy them as I once did, but in general these cartoons are light-years beyond what children are watching now. I have to say I find that rather troubling, but at least parents grew up with the Angry Beavers can change that.",1315440000,2,2376,4.625592417061611
4509964,5,B004ZKKL1O,"Nickelodeon doesn't have a good track record of releasing their shows on DVD, particularly the older ones, so it's a good thing Shout! is doing it for them. This set includes the first and second seasons in their entirety. There are no bonus features at all, but there weren't any in the Rocko's Modern Life set released by Shout! just two months before, so it's no surprise. The picture quality is as good as when the episodes first aired, but only as good. No touchups or remastering or anything, but that's to be expected. We're lucky to be getting this at all.

As for the show itself, it's mixed. The first season is only good; it's the second season that makes this DVD worth buying. Season 1 wasn't as wacky, and the beavers weren't very angry. They got along better than many other cartoon duos. In season 2, they start living up to their name. The storylines are less predictable, and much more wild. $20 is a decent price for just one season, so the fact that this set includes two makes it quite a good value even if the first season isn't stellar.

In sum, this DVD is a great value, and anyone who likes The Angry Beavers should buy it. Hopefully, this will sell well enough to make a seasons 3 and 4 set possible.",1315267200,3,1227,4.400881057268722
4509965,5,B004ZKKL1O,I love this dvd plus i'm watching it now. This dvd set has the 2 full seasons in the set and the best part is its not the best of which means every episode from the 2 seasons on here. Great buy. Hope they do the season 3 and 4,1314576000,3,226,3.54

4509967,5,B004ZKKL1O,"In the style of Looney Tunes the Angry Beavers has many levels of satire and sophistication...but it is also a great riff on sibling relationships, B-Movies, dams, life, romantic relationships, and giant thumbs. Norbert  & Dagget are fun.  I want a canoe bunkbed, a friend that is a bear who talks like Barry White and a friend who is a tree stump.  Animation fits the characters perfectly communicating personality and charm.  All other ""grown up"" factors aside Norby and Daggy Waggy put the fun in cartoons again for me!
