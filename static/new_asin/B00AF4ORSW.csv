8550779,5,B00AF4ORSW,Wonderful to have this on Blu-Ray for playback years from now.  I was truly disappointed though that there was no half-time coverage.  Would loved to have watched the Aggie band (one of the best military marching bands EVER!),1377993600,,225,4.894736842105263
8550780,4,B00AF4ORSW,"Wow!  No commercials.  No delays between plays.  Very fast way to watch the game.

I am disappointed that there was no coverage of the halftime band performances.",1373760000,,162,4.888888888888889
8550781,5,B00AF4ORSW,"Theres no way to relive the 2013 Cotton Bowl! What a game, & also what a performance the Aggies played. Its commercial free, non-stop, & just like how it was brodcast. Better yet, the Blu-ray & DVD combo. Its even stunning in 1080p with the Blu-ray quality picture. Just watching it gives you the chills. I recommend this for any A&M fan. Gig Em!!!",1373155200,,348,4.453125
8550782,5,B00AF4ORSW,My husband LOVES this!  But of course he would - he's Johnny's and Texas A&M's biggest fan!  It was fun surprising him with it!,1369785600,,127,4.25

8550784,5,B00AF4ORSW,Item was as expected and video quality/editing is just like I watched on live tv.  No other issues to report.,1364169600,,109,4.45
8550785,1,B00AF4ORSW,Skipping commercials is one thing but having zero slow motion replays really takes away from the experience of watching the game. I know they did not broadcast it like that on the day of the game. Why skip half time. Put in the school's half time shows. They cut way to much. Maybe they could have the abbreviated and the full on one CD to make everyone happy.,1363996800,,360,4.3088235294117645
