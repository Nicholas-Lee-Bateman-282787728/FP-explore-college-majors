766098,1,6303980422,"I loved the book.  I like Tom Robbins.  I like Gus Van Sant.  But whenever I think of amateurish, idiotic, incompetent filmmaking, this movie immediately leaps to mind.  I might see it again just for the sheer  horror...you really feel BAD for these people who signed on to this  project.  Only John Hurt hit the mark in this movie with his portrayal of  the Countess.
Really, I looked up the worst movie I could think of to see  what kind of rating Amazon.com users gave it (these reviews are  overwhelmingly positively skewed).  At least they didn't give it five  stars.",940032000,5,572,4.61
766099,3,6303980422,"You have to know Gus Van Sant to acknowledge it. Allright the first time you see it the movie really seems weird. You can't really get what it is about ! But watch it twice. And you begin to understand. It's just Van  Sant's vision of our world, where weirdness and injustice shows everyday.  This movie is not weirder than Drugstore Cowboy or To Die For. If you  really need something to hold on, take a look at a new member of the  Phoenix family : Rain, River's and Joaquin's sister.",922406400,,486,4.3076923076923075

Third time, I understood the disenfranchised woman, but, couldn't forgive them for what they were doing to the Cranes.

766314,5,6303980422,"One of my favorite books! I was told this movie was disappointing, but I disagree! Uma Thurman is the perfect Sissy Hankshaw. If you like Tom Robbins, you should like this movie. But you have to understand that EVERYTHING from the book cannot be in the movie. I think it's a good adaption; they include a lot even though it feels kind of rushed. I definitely recommend!",1258070400,,369,4.522388059701493
766315,1,6303980422,"Uma Thurman has been in some hideously bad movies.  The confusing mess that was THE AVENGERS comes to mind (despite being a studio film with Ralph Fiennes and Sean Connery!).  There was that horrific Batman movie that killed the franchise until Christopher Nolan resurrected it for Warner Brothers.  I haven't even bothered more recent bombs like MY SUPER EX-GIRLFRIEND (which I thought had a decent premise).

But it doesn't really matter what grotesque misstep Uma makes next because nothing can be as head-scratchingly terrible, as mind-numblingly stupid, as frighteningly vapid as EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES.

If you're seeing something else, you're just looking way too hard.

The acting is bad, the writing is nonsensical, the production is cheap (despite some excellent nature shots), scene after scene of Uma Thurman wearing ridiculous giant rubber thumbs makes you wonder just what kind of story could make this work.  And that this ain't it.",1236297600,5,952,5.223684210526316
766316,5,6303980422,"Adapted from Tom Robbins' book (and narrated by him), the story revolves around an empowered and curious, young twenty-nine year old Sissy (Uma Thurman) who has been born with enormous thumbs ~ which she uses to hitchhike all across the world meeting a strange and even surreal array of thought provoking and humorous characters....until she finds her true home ~ amongst the free-thinking cowgirls. Philisophical, daring, funny and fun are the first thoughts that come to mind when considering this creatively inquisitive independent film. Much like in ""Alice Through the Looking Glass,"" thru characters, circumstances and cleverly worded metaphors, the meaning of life is challenged as well as the meaning of being Women and identity itself....with a question of sexuality and society on the side. I love this movie, even though Uma's accent isn't thee greatest I've ever heard ~ after the rhythmn and the adventure of the movie grabs you, it's no longer an oddity but a missed voice when the movie's over.  Oh, and did I mention the movie's charming, heady soundtrack was performed by none other than K.D. Lang? Lovely and dreamy.
  You're missing out if you miss this cult classic flick!",1228867200,2,1191,5.097435897435897
766317,1,6303980422,"Uma Thurman is not a very good actress. She's tall, & reasonably attractive, & sometimes blonde, but she was the poster-girl for the Uber-hip set in the late 80's/early 90's so for that set, she was a perfect choice as Sissy Hankshaw. Having read & loved this book, I knew she was not a good choice, and she was subsequently was named Worst Actress of 1993 for her terrible attempt to portray Cissy. Likewise, Rain aka Rain- bow aka Rain Phoenix was also miscast, as well as not being talented enough to pull off the role of Boss Cowgirl Bonanza Jellybean. She seemed to be attempting to read off a Teleprompter, or maybe she should have been. Did I detect her lips moving before she attempted to deliver her lines? The reason she was not named Worst Actress of 1993 was that to win that award, she had to be an actress, which she clearly is not. I've seen better acting on an X-rated channel. Angie Dickinson, that 60's-70's retread hearthrob of teenage males was nearly as bad as Phoenix & Thurman, but she had an excuse, she hadn't worked for many years, & was critically hungover. At least she seemed that way. That's the bad news. The good news is, the rest of the cast was a hoot! Batting leadoff, the always weird & wonderful Carol Kane & Buck Henry(why don't those two have children?? What a great idea), John Hurt in drag, Crispin Glover, Pat Morita(as Noryuki)as The Chink(""Ha Ha Ho Ho and Hee Hee!!""), Sean Young looking so sexy I almost forgot about her psychotic meltdown over James Woods, Keanu Reeves was entirely adequate as Julian Gitchee, but any one of a number of Native American, Canadian, or Ecuadoran actors would have been a better choice, such as the lovely & talented Gary Farmer. Two other bones to pick: 1) Tom Robbins' favorite Native American tribe, is not pronounced See-Wash, but Sigh-wash and B) Why was the locale moved from the Dakotas to Deschutes County, Oregon? Stupid idea. I really loved Pat Morita & John Hurt, but their performances are not enough to tempt me to watch this terrible movie again. Like an earlier reviewer, anger is my strongest emotion at this attempt to adapt a really good book.",1215129600,9,2138,4.599476439790576
766318,5,6303980422,"Gus Van Sant's rendering of Tom Robbins' masterpiece is superb and sureal.  Uma Thurman couldn't be more perfect in the role of Yoni Yum model turned hitchiking goddess, Sissy Hankshaw.  It's a must have for any fan of cowgirls!",1213920000,2,228,4.82051282051282
766394,5,6303980422,...what a hoot! It's not like the book and how could anyone make a movie just like a book this wild? Every time I watch this movie I laugh until my sides hurt and Delores Del Ruby!...holy cow!...,1161129600,4,195,4.157894736842105
766395,2,6303980422,"First of all I read the book and then saw the movie.  If you are planning on doing this then I'd say that you will be very disappointed.  I loved the book and hated the movie.  The book is about 420 pages long and the movie is like a clip show of the book.  Highlighting the major parts of the book.

I don't know if Gus Van Sant meant to leave out some of the (what I thought) best parts of the book because he felt that people should read the book or because the producers felt that an 140 mins. was enough.  They left out my favorite parts with description of the ""Clockpeople"" and the and the ending in the book is great, and in the movie a couple main parts of the ending where left out.  If you haven't read the book then do and don't see the movie, and if you don't like to read then just watch the movie.  The only thing I enjoyed was the casting.  I love Tom Robbins books', and I think it's just sad what they did to this movie.",1150416000,3,938,3.9468085106382977

766397,1,6303980422,"Sometimes critics love to get on a bandwagon.  It cuts both ways.  They can all praise a film to death, giving you the impression that you're about to see a masterpiece, but the film is really just an OK film passing for a great one.  The English Patient is a good example.  Or they can trash a film mercilessly, usually when it's a ""troubled"" production (meaning behind schedule or over budget).  Heaven's Gate is a great example, and the sad thing is Heaven's Gate is actually a masterpiece.  But here, the critics were absolutely spot on when they called this film garbage.  It is one of Van Sant's worst films.  Van Sant has been incredibly erratic in his career, making great films (My Own Private Idaho), good ones (Good Will Hunting, Drugstore Cowboy), and lousy ones (Pyscho, Gerry, this one).  This is really awful stuff, and you're probably better off reading the book.",1145059200,7,879,4.69281045751634
766398,3,6303980422,"Even cowgirls get the blues is a terrific adaption of Robbins' book of the same title. Having read the book, I must say that this is one of the best adaptions that I have seen so far. I'm not quite sure if this film could be as greatly appreciated without having read the book. The characters are painted here precisely as described. Sissy(Uma Thurman) and her gigantic thumbs are just as you could have imagined. Bonanza Jellybean(Rain Phoenix) is an unforgettable character, her strength and cockiness makes you giggle with delight. The chink and his oh-so-meaningful sayings get you thinking. This film is amusing and I can recommend to anyone who dreams of cowgirls and love. well gosh, cause even cowgirls get the blues..",1127952000,3,726,4.862903225806452
766399,3,6303980422,"If you enjoy the absurd, you should like this.  Unexpected and entertaining--enough truth to make one a little discouraged with humankind.  This film stuck in the back of my mind for years.",1127433600,2,189,4.875
766400,4,6303980422,"I really enjoyed this movie.  It is based on the Robbins book and keeps the same daring, quirkiness.  WHile in theaters this movie was not a success.  Most people find it too strange, but it has grown a cult following.  I recommend this movie to anyone with an open mind and a love of movies that are trying to do something different and not just dole out the usual ""hollywood plot"" that has been done over and over again.",1091923200,8,422,4.30379746835443
766401,1,6303980422,"I was terribly excited when I learned of the film version of the first Tom Robbins novel I read. Learning of Gus Van Sant, Uma Thurman, Keanu Reeves, John Hurt, and even Rain Pheonix excited me even more. However, I was severly let down. This is, without question, the worst movie I have yet to see. As tavision so eloquently put it, ""It is so bad, it isn't even good for being bad.""
The plot is an abbreviation of the novel, to say the least. Granted, some cuts are to be expected, but some characters were reduced to such a shred of their literary counterparts it raises the question why Van Sant included them at all. The character of Dr. Robbins is completely absent, and the brevity with which the Chink is represented reduces him to a fortune-spewing, mountainman horndog. Pheonix is unbearable as Bonanza Jellybean. Her monotonous tones, lack of presence, and persistent lack of any cuteness destroy what could have been an excellent role. The character of Dolores Del Ruby is also disappointing; she lacks the wildness and distinction from the other cowgirls that the novel provides. This is despite an annoying soliloquoy directly to the camera and all too abundant whip-cracking. Uma Thurman would be the film's saving grace, but salvaging anything from this bastardization is akin to making sno-cones in hell. Hurt's Countess is fair, but again, the rest of the film drags it down. The voice-over by Robbins isn't spectacular, but his prose does carry some charm over.
At the end of the film, if K.D. Lang's original soundtrack hasn't been associated with the most painful cinematic experience of your couch's life, you are ""treated"" to a music video of the most played song in the movie, K.D. Lang's ""Movement.""
Do yourself a favor and spend the time reading some Robbins or praying if he attempts a film again he finds a director who can do his work justice.",1078444800,7,1871,4.777777777777778
766402,1,6303980422,"There are movies like ""Plan 9"" that are so bad they have a charm about them, there are some like ""Waterworld"" that have the same inexplicable draw as a car accident, and there are some like ""Desperate living"" that you hate to admit you love. Cowgirls have none of these redemptions. The cast assembled has enough talent to make almost any plot watchable, and from what I've been told, the book is enjoyable.
How then could this movie be so intolerably bad? To begin with, it seems the director brought together a cast of names with no other tie than what will bring in the 20 somethings. Then tell them to do their best Kevin Costner imitations. Open the book at random and start shooting whatever is on the page making sure to keep the wide expanses of America from being interesting in any way. Finally give the editing job to your brother-in-law, because the meat packing plant just laid him off. He does have twenty years of cutting experience.
This movie now defines the basement for me. It is so bad, it isn't even good for being bad.",1017100800,19,1040,4.507936507936508
766435,3,6303980422,"Gus Van Sant is a bold film maker. He experiments with unusual ideas and occasionally hits the jackpot. Most would agree that Good Will Hunting and Finding Forrester were successful in every way, but this picture generates violent disagreement. Sadly the majority would dismiss this film as a failed experiment to bring an odd 1970s lesbian cowboy novel to the big screen. There is however a vocal minority who absolutely love the quirkiness of this film. Its difference is at the heart of its charm, and together with Uma Thurman's star quality and k.d. lang's score this movie rises above the everyday action comedy dramas or romances most film-makers are producing.
I have read the book and Van Sant's adaptation is very faithful. The sexuality is only hinted at and this is carried forward in the film in the brief scenes of touching between Rain Phoenix and Uma Thurman. Despite being twenty years old, Rain still manages to look like a young teenager, and this perhaps undermines the intention of the scenes with her. If there is such a thing as perfect casting it is that of k.d. lang as the soundtrack composer and performer, which fits as perfectly as you would expect. John Hurt almost reprises his Quentin Crisp in his role as The Duchess, a much louder performance than I imagined from the book, but nevertheless funny and well-observed. All in all, there are some enjoyable and interesting bits and pieces in this film, even if it doesn't quite hit the high tide mark of Van Sant's other achievements.",1012176000,6,1514,4.804597701149425

766438,1,6303980422,"How could this ""film"" be credited with trying to capture the essence of the novel?!? Do not even attempt at THINKING of this film, let alone watching it,  as it may cause you to doubt any faith you had in the human brain's capacity for creativity and artistic vision.
The characters protrayed in the film are nothing like the ones you meet in the novel. Every facet of this movie is horrible. It's uncomfortable to watch. Maddening even, if you are a Tom Robbins fan.
Do yourself a favour and read the book. Then read it again. If you ever come across this movie (in any form) run, duck, cover, do ANYTHING to avoid it!!! I'd rather watch the fermentation process of pudding than this abomination!",986860800,9,697,4.531746031746032

A film translation can never match the intimacy you feel reading the book, but it can bring those treasured characters and locations to life. This is where the film version really shines.
Gus Van Sant is my all time favourite director- his prevoius picture ""My own private Idaho"" broke my heart. It may have been over ambitious for him to bring this magical novel to the silver screen, but I find the fact that he did so, marvollously admirable. The storyline and ideals of this tale are truely unique and need to reach a wider audience.
Uma Thurman is perfectly cast as Sissy. She displays both innocence and enigma quite beautifully. Support is given by a whole host of interesting performers- John Hurt, Rain Phoenix, Crispin Glover, William Burroughs and many of the ""Idaho"" cast make breezy cameo's. Tom Robbins himself performs voice-over narration. Little known fact- River Phoenix (to whom the film is dedicated) makes his final screen appearence as a birdwatcher in the climatic scenes.

Even Keanu Reeves fans will be disappointed because he has  asthma and can't speak. (He coughed out about 3 sentences.)
