4310976,5,B004AR4W0S,"I have to be honest and say I am SICK of these episodes. I think I can repeat them word for word. That being said, I'm sick of ghem because my son ""asked"" to watch them every day for several months. Starting around 14 months he just fell in love with this show and refused to watch anything else. Fine by me. We generally pop these on in the early morning when mommy is waiting for the coffee to kick in. He likes the characters, especially Pig, and the songs. Not as annoying as most and educational, too, so I consent. It really is a cute show. My son would give it 6 stars.",1321401600,,576,4.06140350877193

4310978,5,B004AR4W0S,Super Why has captivated our grandson's interest. He is 1 and loves to watch the adventures of Super Why. This is great on long trips too. No fussing from the back seat. We were very impressed with the quick service too! Thanks.,1317600000,,228,4.4523809523809526
4310979,4,B004AR4W0S,Very quick shipping! The only reason i didn't give 5 stars is that i can hear that both the DVD's are not attached inside the plastic wrapped cases and are moving all around. I hope that when i open them there aren't any scratches...,1316995200,,233,4.318181818181818

4310981,5,B004AR4W0S,"We bought this DVD because our son (15 months old) LOVES watching Super Why! on TV and we needed something to entertain him on our drive across the country.  It was the perfect DVD to buy for the trip, and he has pulled it out several times to watch since.",1315008000,,256,4.12
4310982,5,B004AR4W0S,"Before receiving Super Why! Humpty Dumpty & Other Fairytale Adventures, my son had not seen Super Why!, but oh my goodness, he is now officially addicted. (Is there a 12-step program for this show?) Every time he sees a question mark, he says ""Look Mommy, Super Why!"" This DVD has played more times than I can count, and he of course knows all the songs, the sayings (""We look... in a book!""), the character names, and more. We have also discovered what time it airs on PBS Kids so we're now watching it live too. :)

Super Why! Humpty Dumpty & Other Fairytale Adventures is filled with 100 minutes of problem solving adventures. Each of the four episodes is about a different popular fairytale and they change each story to help the character. For Humpty Dumpty, they help him down from the wall. He still gets a crack, but they put a bandaid on his boo boo so all is better. How cute is that? If you haven't seen Super Why! before, I highly recommend watching Super Why! Humpty Dumpty & Other Fairytale Adventures. I'm sure your child will love it as much as mine did (and still does!).",1308182400,14,1088,4.467336683417085
