7966702,5,B00006B1HL,"I gave it 5 stars, it doesn't deserve any less.  This is one of the best Christmas videos you could own, and perhaps the best Christmas special from the Rugrats.  Not only is the best but it also has a lot of educational values.  Although baby Jesus is not mentioned, the tots find themselves in front of a porcelain Jesus doll and they feel so bad for it (thinking it's a live baby) they give him their mittens, their toys and their scarves to stay warm.  Angelica finds herself in an imaginary Santa Claus workshop and imagines all kinds of things about her moose doll coming to life and telling her how hurt he felt when she called him ""dumb"".  Santa's Elf is not happy about that, then reminds Angelica of all the bad things she did; then denies Angelica everything she's screaming for in Christmas.  After that, he sings a happy tune about how Christmas is about sharing with friends.  Angelica wakes up from her imaginary dream and in return, turns generous for the rest of the episode, showing that even the toughest of people can show compassion and love.

Instead of getting all the vain-expensive-spending-based type of Christmas movies nowadays (that focus on giving the most expensive present to your families); get this humble video instead.  It won't cost you much and it will teach your kids about the meaning of Christmas.",1290124800,,1338,4.683760683760684
