8232859,4,B000YI99PK,"I am a yoga and pilates instructor. This is a nicely done DVD, but there I have a few critiques.
1. There is not nearly enough moves for the hips, glutes & thighs--these are part of our Power House and should be toned more in a Pilates routine.
2. Some of the breating cues are off and are confusing.
3. Leg Pull Plank is out of sequence in the DVD.  It should come before the belly twist.  You will notice that the participants in the DVD go from sitting to on their backs with no transition.  Not a huge deal, but when I move into my restorative postures, I never go back into an active one.  It creates an awkward flow.",1294444800,3,622,4.115702479338843
8232860,5,B000YI99PK,"Never having used a home workout media before, I have been quite pleased with the instructions on how to do the exercises.  There are a few I have been physically unable to do, but after several times of doing the workout I am able to add those into my routine as well.  I feel like I have just finished working hard when the routine is over.  I have done my own home workouts before, but having the instructor actually telling me where to exhale or inhale really seems to help the workout be more effective.",1271203200,,508,4.326315789473684

I'm getting a good workout along with enjoying doing it. Worth the money spent!!!",1267315200,,253,4.183673469387755
