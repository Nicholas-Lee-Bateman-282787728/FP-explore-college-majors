5045918,5,B00701QXNK,"Level Up is the movie from Cartoon Network about three high school kids from different cliques who want nothing to do with each other in the real world but are unknowingly friends and teammates in an MMO roleplaying game ""Maldark: Conqueror of All Worlds"".  A glitch in the system unleashes characters from the game into the real world and it's up to awkward nerd Wyatt (Black Death), popular jock Lyle (Wizza), and skater clown Dante (Sir Bickle) to get over themselves and save their town.

Don't listen to the people with a bone to pick with Cartoon Network, the movie is well cast with likable characters, has great action, comedy and special effects and spawned the TV show of the same name that is even more fun than the movie.  My kids, 6 and 8, love the movie and the show, same goes for my friends with kids in their teens, not to mention my wife and I.  Both Level Up: The Movie and the show are awesome!

8507447,1,B00701QXNK,"Level Up: The Movie is a live-action fantasy comedy made-for-tv movie that aired on Cartoon Network and served as a pilot to the currently airing ""Level Up"" TV series. The movie revolves around the MMORPG Mandark: The Conqueror of Worlds . Wyatt (Gaelan Connell) plays as Black Death and leads the clan known as Neverfail. Rounding out the team is Dante (Connor Del Rio) as Sir Bickle and Lyle (Jessie Usher) as Wizza. The three of them inadvertently tear down the firewall to allow Mandark to unleash his henchmen into the real world. Now as creatures from the game begin wreaking havoc in their town, it's up to Neverfail to save the world from Mandark's forthcoming domination whether they're up for the task or not.

I love Cartoon Network. I really do. Animated films and TV shows will always be a huge part of my life. With that said, I think everybody died a little inside when Cartoon Network started showing live-action programming. But the same argument can be made for MTV never showing music videos anymore. I'm a big supporter of both ""Adventure Time"" and ""Regular Show,"" but ""Level Up"" just seemed lame based on its promos.

The concept for the movie is pretty solid; a video game villain finding a way to become reality and attempting world domination by sending a rogue's gallery of monsters doesn't sound so bad. Anything that exists in this virtual world has been given a gateway to exist in ours. It's the execution that's the problem. The movie is bogged down by really lame one-liners, corny dialogue, ripped off slogans from video games, TV shows, and movies that you love, and bad acting.

The special effects jump back and forth from being semi-decent to really terrible. The lighting effects are pretty spot-on like whenever the portal is opened or whenever Lyle casts a spell. The make-up effects aren't always awful either. Sprague is probably the best looking thing in the movie. But the low budget for the movie is felt more often than not. CG characters don't look so hot in the real world and every one of their weapons looks like a toy bought off of the clearance aisle at Big Lots.

The greatest part of the movie is when pop-up ads start jumping into the real world. It's pulled off pretty well and actually feels fairly original. Once you see Mandark in full make-up though and the way he's basically a cheap imitation of Megamind without being blue, it sours anything that may have once been redeemable.

Level Up: The Movie is like if ""Xena: Warrior Princess"" or ""Hercules: The Legendary Journeys"" fused with The World of Warcraft episode of ""South Park"" and produced a PG version that was suitable for kids. The effects are mostly very bad, the humor is juvenile, and the acting makes you groan when it's at its best. But I'm also not the demographic Level Up is aimed towards. While it's probably entertaining for kids, Level Up will have adults watching the family pet lick itself as an alternate and more pleasing form of entertainment.

Special features on the DVD include a music video and the bonus episode ""Wanted"" from Level Up the Series. Level Up: The Movie is rated TV-PG for violence. It's presented in widescreen in Dolby Surround 5.1 and is about 69 minutes long. Level Up: The Movie should be available in both retail stores and most online retailers now.",1336262400,3,3308,4.724436741767764

If you haven't seen Level Up yet, it is a great show. Now that the kids are getting older, we watch a whole lot more TV together. Being a big kid myself, I really get into the shows with the kids.

Level Up is about four very different high school students named Wyatt, Dante, Lyle and Angie

Goddess and I LOVED this movie.  Handsome didn't watch it with us the first time around but he now has it in his room and has watched it daily for 4 days.

The boys are big gamers and spend their free time working as a team in the virtual game Conqueror of All Worlds. Unbeknownst to them, they really know each other and don't actually like each other at school.

When they accidentally open a portal from their game world to the real world, all hell breaks loose.

They believe that they have unlocked some beta version of the game but the next night when they meet up online they soon realize that they must meet in person and figure this out.

What a great movie. Taking these very different personalities, the jock, the skater boy, the geek and throw in the spunky chick and there is someone who will appeal to all kids.  I love the idea that these kids who are so different, hang with a certain crowd in school, tease and disrespect each other can come together and realize that we are really just people living together in this world. All for one, one for all!",1335916800,4,1379,4.273076923076923

Ghouls!

Aaaand a Evil Wizard?

OH MY! Level Up at its core is a fun movie for kids! This movie is about three kids that accidentally release an evil sorcerer, Maldark, from a video game and what they have to do to make sure that he doesn't conquer their world. Its full of action and comedy, but the best thing is that if you liked this movie then you can go watch the series of this show that is currently airing on Cartoon Network!! Its crazy fun and even zanier than the movie!

In short - fun, comedy, action! I had a kick watching it.",1334188800,5,549,4.150943396226415
