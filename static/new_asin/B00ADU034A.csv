This is not a found-footage movie and they tell you that in the opening moments.  I just wish they'd clearly said so in the Amazon web page before I bought it.  When they tell you it's two guys following three investigative teams into Hill House, these aren't shaded, understated overtones meant as a segue into the horror that follows, that's' exactly what it is: two guys following three investigative teams into Hill House.  They get footage of some interesting stuff but it's nothing I haven't seen elsewhere...for free.  I was going to give it 2 stars but the price for what you get is somewhat insulting.  I'm sure the people in the movie are probably very nice people but they did not hold my interest at all and I could not finish watching it.  In fact, I nodded off for about half of what I did watch.  There was an expectation built here that was not satisfied in any way.

Update - 11.18.2013:

At the suggestion of someone who I believe was one of the filmmakers, I had another look at The Hill House Tapes yesterday so as to see the third group of investigators.  I rewatched it in its entirety and didn't nod off or turn it off halfway through as in my original viewing.  I wasn't especially impressed with the third group.  I don't know for certain whether they are a real group but they did not strike me as believable, particularly their associate who showed up way late.  I don't know whether the fellow was wearing photo-gray lenses that were reacting to the camera lights but there's sort of a used-car salesman quality to someone who wears sunglasses at night....Maybe he's the nicest guy in the world but that's just my first impression.

Many years ago, I had the opportunity to chat briefly with Ed and Lorraine Warren at a seminar and I realize from their slides that ghosts don't show up on cue and if you do catch something there's no going back for another take.  You get what you get and that's it.  Having said that, I found the phenomena experienced by the third group to be too easily explained by other means.  I won't list them in case someone wants to see for themselves.  If the events and the assaults were truly what they purport to be, then I apologize to those who experienced them but they didn't strike me as real the way they were shown by the film.

I wish that it had the quality of a teaser I stumbled across a teaser at Vimeo for a video called ""No Reason:  The Hill House Tapes"":  [...]  That looked like a nice, scary, indie effort.  If that whole film is floating around somewhere, I'd be interested in giving it a look but this film did not make me suspend disbelief!  I'll give it another star, because I didn't really hate it, and I'll not snore for the title of the review.",1383523200,4,2837,4.460194174757282
