8293012,5,B001DEEXKK,"I've been to Rusty's studio in San Francisco, and the DVD is a fun slice of that experience at home. It's been a good way for me to push myself when I want to or just keep a slower pace when I need it. The quick flows are really nice when I'm feeling busy. I haven't worked up to the harder level video yet, but I'm loving everything else on the DVDs",1397952000,,350,3.875
8293013,4,B001DEEXKK,"I like this yoga. I looked into Bhakti to help with anxiety and stress while gaining the physical benefits of yoga. At first, I thought Rusty was a little goofy, but once you get over that and commit to the practice I feel a real benefit. I not only have noticed I have become more flexible, and my back issues have gone away, but I feel a great sense of calm after completing the practice. I would recommend.",1387152000,,409,4.256410256410256
8293014,5,B001DEEXKK,"Urban Flow in SF is the best yoga studio I had ever been to, so I purchased this DVD to take with me when I'm not in the bay area. I'm still somewhat of a beginner, and the level one class is perfect; it's challenging enough so that it's not discouraging, but leaves myself for much room for improvement. Can't wait to work myself up to level two!",1338681600,,347,4.117647058823529
8293015,5,B001DEEXKK,"On a visit to San Fransisco I went to this studio.  It was the best Yoga class I've ever been to.  I purchased this DVD in hopes that I could get some of that experience at home and that is what I got.  I highly recommend this DVD set.  It is a challenging Yoga workout, which are very hard to find on the market.",1337904000,,313,3.84375
