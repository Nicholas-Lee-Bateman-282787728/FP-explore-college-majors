8092146,3,B000BTC10M,"I have been looking for good documentaries on the War in the Western Desert. This one was listed as ""Brand New"". Unfortunately, the only thing brand new about it was the picture on the cover. Inside, it is the same content as earlier releases of The War File ""The Desert War"". In terms of documentaries, it is adequate, but hardly spectacular. The same footage seems to show up in all these documentaries, often out of context.",1289260800,2,427,4.631578947368421
