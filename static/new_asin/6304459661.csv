880174,1,6304459661,"This fifteen part serial will probably only appeal to those who are already fans of the Batman.  Aside from its place in the history of Batman, this classic Columbia serial offers very little.  One may think of it as a  cultural artifact.
  The biggest shortcoming of this serial is its  tremendously low budget.  Producer Sam Katzman, known for making movies on  next to nothing, pulled the purse strings dreadfully tight on this one.  The Batmobile was nothing more than a modest Mercury convertible and the  Dynamic Duo are forced to store their crime fighting costumes in a filing  cabinet.  I was embarrased for the actors, Robert Lowery and John  Duncan, who had to wear those costumes.  It was obvious that Robin's domino  mask was simply purchased at a five and dime, and the tailor who crafted  Batman's cowl seems to have followed a pattern for some sort of devil  costume.
  This horned cowl proves to be a problem for Lowery.  He  is constantly tilting back his head in order to see through the eye holes.  Also, during several fight scenes, Lowery is actually forced to adjust the  cowl in order to keep it from slipping off his head altogether.  In all fairness, Lowery does as well as can be expected with the terrible  script and ultra low budget.  I'm amazed that he was able to deliver some  of his lines with a straight face.
Vickie Vale: Does Bruce Wayne know  that you have his car?
Batman: Of course.
  At least Lowery is  physically similar to Batman, unlike Lewis Wilson who wore the mantle of  the Bat in the earlier 1943 serial.  He has an athletic build and a fairly  impressive voice.  I think he could have been a decent Batman had the  script and the props been up to par.
  Douglas Croft, however, makes  for a poor Robin.  He looks like a thirty year old with a baby faced sneer.  He comes across as a spoiled brat and an imbecile.
  The bad guy,  a masked character known as the Wizard, is certainly an odd chap.  He has  cars, a air plane, a submarine, a device that allows x-ray vision, a couple  of underground lairs and hoard of witless and amoral thugs at his command.  His overhead must be huge.  Yet all he is asking for is five million  dollars.  I've watched this serial twice so far and I still can't figure  out exactly what the Wizard was really after.  His overall goal seems to  shift from episode to episode.
  All in all, this is really a poor  production. I give it one star only because it has Batman and there are a  few scenes where one is likely to chuckle.  Take away the camp factor and  this serial would be rated at zero stars.
Regards and Best  Wishes,

880302,5,6304459661,"The delightful thing about this 1949 version of Batman is that at that time it was still strictly for kids and the production values appropriately followed suit.  These serials were made for children who were familiar with Batman comic books, which in those days were strictly for kids -- lacking the dark tones of how Batman is presented today.

For those familiar with the Batman television series (1966-68), you can see where Adam West got a lot of his campy shticks.  That latter TV series basically was lampooning the 1949 version.  You can see it in the costuming, in the dialogue (particularly between Batman & Robin) in the fight scenes, in the cartoon-inspired settings of the police chief's office, Bruce Wayne's mansion, etc.  Even superhero gestures, like putting the fist of one gloved hand into the other hand to show concern and determination.

880466,2,6304459661,"I dunno. I've so far watched the first several episodes of this serial, but it's extremely boring. Very repetitive and cheaply made. Commissioner Gordon barely appears in it. The actor they found for Bruce Wayne is goofy looking. Not much is even made about his secret identity, so he likely just wears the costume for effect only and not even to protect his secret identity. Even forgiving the fact that he doesn't drive a Batmobile, but just drives an ordinary car, and that his costume (and Robin's too) looks like something that a mother would knit for her son to go around trick or treating with on Halloween, they still good have placed some attention to actual storytelling and production. But, hence they do not do this. The sets, the camerawork and everything about this serial smells of laziness and low-budget production. Even the 1943 serial was more true to the character than this goofy mess. At least that one found a good actor for Bruce Wayne and had a much more serious storyline.  This collection is really for extreme completists and I sort of regret buying it. It's really not even worth one star, but to be nice I give it 2 stars for effort.",1402444800,,1163,4.645631067961165

The only positives this serial had was that it did not have any racial slurs in it like the first one and it introduced Commissioner Gordon, the Bat Signal, and Vicky Vale. But the story, special effects, and acting were just dreadful. Bruce Wayne now lives in a small house in the suburbs, the Wizard makes a terrible villain (none of his actions make sense, his motivations seem to change from episode to episode, and he's not very menacing at all), and I found the serial extremely tiresome and boring as well as campy unlike it's predecessor.

This was filmed near the end of the serials time on the big screen. The studio gave no budget for the movie and legend says it was filmed in less than a month.
When watching it you can see where the tv show may have been influenced if they saw it. It is hokey but that is part of the fun. The cast is not of well known actors but do credible jobs with the parts of Batman and Robin.
Lowery was around hollywood as a character actor for years and did a couple of serials at least.

880632,4,6304459661,"I'm giving this only 4 stars. Why? Because most of the cliffhanger endings are far below average. That doesn't stop this from being an interesting serial anyway. This time Robert Lowery plays Batman. Robert Lowery(Oct. 17 1913 Dec. 26 1971) began his film career with Fox in 1937. His earliest films include Four Sons & Drums Along the Mohawk. He appeared with his wife Jean Parker on stage in Born Yesterday Caine Mutiny & Burlesque. Later films include Young Mr. Lincoln(1939) A Scream In The Dark(1944) Prison Ship(1945) The Mummy's Ghost(1946) Death Valley(1948) Crosswinds(1951) The Rise And Fall Of Legs Diamond(1960) Johnny Reno(1961) & many more. Lowery also starred in 2 more serials The Mystery Of The Riverboat(Universal Pictures 1944) & The Monster And The Ape(Columbia Pictures 1945). During the mid-1950's Lowery costarred on the tv series Circus Boy. This program featured future Monkee Micky Dolenz in the title role. Lowery plays Big Tim Champion the circus owner. Also Johnny Duncan is well cast as Robin The Boy Wonder. He had appeared in 4 East Side Kids films & westerns with Roy Rogers Audie Murphy & other cowboys prior to Batman And Robin. Batman creator Bob Kane visited the set of the serial during production. The following quotes are taken from Kane's autobiography Batman & Me written with Tom Andrae(Eclipse Books(1989. Kane observes''This film boasted some improvements over the last serial. Katzman used a black Cadillac for the Batmobile instead of a gray convertible. And Robert Lowery was more athletic-looking and a better actor than Lewis Wilson. I ran into Lowery at a party in Hollywood several years later. I couldn't understand why he didn't seem to pleased to see me. When I inquired about this, he told me that because of me and my infernal creation Batman his career had taken a nosedive. The serial had been quite successful and he had been so typecast as Batman that he couldn't get another role. I felt sorry for him but I doubted whether he ever would have made it as a big star''. In this serial Batman and Robin battle the unknown masked Wizard. Does anybody notice the difference in the narration in chapter 1? The serial begins with Knox Manning(narrator for all 57 of Columbia's serials) announcing the action. When we first see Wayne Manor,someone else does this portion,then it's Manning for the rest of the movie. I'm not sure but I think actor Don Harvey was speaking about Wayne Manor. Harvey plays Nolan one of the Wizard's men-until chapter 6 when the Wizard orders him killed! The Wizard has stolen a powerful remote control machine which controls cars trains and planes from far away-without anybody driving them! The device was originally invented by Professor Hammil. Hammil became ill & was confined to a wheelchair before he finished the machine. The best cliffhanger in the entire serial happens in chapter 10. We see Batman fall several stories from a high rise building to his death. At the start of chapter 11 Bruce Wayne comes out to the car where Robin is waiting. How did this happen? We learn via flashback that Batman had been knocked senseless by an electric charge from a doorknob. Jimmy Vale one of the Wizard's men ''borrows'' Batman's costume hoping to correct the error of his ways. Oh yeah who turned off the electric charge that shocked Batman in chapter 10? We see a gloved hand turn off the fusebox but we never learn who's hand it was. The shot of Batman falling is actually a stock shot from chapter 1 of the 1943 Batman serial. Overall this serial isn't quite a classic. Once again the comic book villains are ignored. The Joker and Catwoman the Penguin the Riddler Two Face and Clayface had all made numerous appearances in the comics by now. Still the Wizard is a very mysterious villain in his own right. Lyle Talbot plays police Commissioner Gordon. He was one of the founding members of the Screen Actors Guild. As a result he was no longer offered leading roles in movies. That didn't stop Talbot from working by accepting every role offered to him until his death in 1994. He is perhaps best remembered as neighbor Joe Randolph on the tv series The Adventures of Ozzie And Harriet(1952-1966). His son Stephen played Gilbert Gates on tv's Leave It To Beaver in the 1960's. Leonard Penn plays Carter Professor Hammil's servant. In the 1960's he directed many movies as Leo Penn. He's the father of actor/director Sean Penn. I first discovered this serial when it was released on vhs by Goodtimes video in 1989. As I watched the tape I noticed many scenes in chapter 1 seemed to be cut short. Then in 1996 Columbia Pictures video released this serial again as part of the Serial Collection. There was no rerelease on vhs for the 1943 Batman serial. According to author Roy Kinnard's book Science Fiction Serials(McFarland Publishers 1998) the first chapter was cut by 8 minutes. When the Sony dvd came out all of the cut footage was fully restored. I recently learned there may be some missing footage from chapter 2. An interview with Johnny Duncan appeared in Filmfax Magazine #103(summer 2004). Duncan says a stuntman dressed in a Robin costume was fighting the crooks on top of the train. Duncan says the guy did a lousy job & he suggested someone else. On the dvd & vhs versions we only see Batman on top of the train fighting the Wizard's men. The Filmfax interview includes a couple of photos of a Robin stuntman at the close of chapter 2. So was the footage shot and then cut prior to its theatrical release? We'll never know for sure but like the serial itself it keeps you guessing!",1340496000,2,5584,4.7755946225439505

880634,2,6304459661,"Batman [Robert Lowery] and Robin [Johnny Duncan] return to clash with a mysterious hooded villain named The Wizard who's armed with a machine that can control any moving vehicle. Unlike the 43 serial, this serial is free of any racist content but this time around things just aren't as fun as this serial's cast and story are simply not up to par with that of the 1943 serial. Another thing hurting this serial is the many weak cliffhangers that end the chapters and the acting is also a step down from the original. Over the years, it's been claimed that Lewis Wilson [the man who played Batman in the first serial] wasn't allowed to play Batman again in this serial due to weight issues but if that is true, then why was an even more out of shape Robert Lowery given the role??? It becomes obvious within the first chapter that this serial was filmed on an even lower budget than the original [just one look at Batman's new ill-fitting poorly done costume gives away the hint] but after a quite plodding first half, The serial finally begins to come alive a little after the first 5 or 6 chapters are over and one thing that will leave you watching until the end is the mystery over the identity of The Wizard [who was actually a quite menacing character here] and although this serial attempted to leave behind the campiness of the 1943 serial, it failed to do so as there's plenty to laugh at throughout this serial from the plot inconsistencies to the laughably bad costumes of Batman and Robin. This definitely will not appeal to this generation's fans of Batman but if you like the Batman comics from the 1930's and 40's then you might like this serial [although i strongly reccomend you to see the far superior 1943 serial first]",1326585600,2,1737,4.552715654952077

Without the wartime setting, this one seems much less compelling story wise.  Also, Robert Lowery, although a good actor, seems bored and slightly embarassed in this one.  The less said about Johnny Duncan the better.  Some of the situations Batman and Robin find themselves in are downright hilarious, such as Batman pulling a full size blow torch from god knows were to cut his way out of a locked vault. Or, when Batman is punched in the face by a thug, commenting ""that hurt"" then coldcocking the guy. The costumes are ok except for the glaringly oversize nose piece on Batman's cowl,which just destroys the entire effect of the whole outfit.  I found it annoying and distracting throughout the entire film and coming in at about four hours, that quite a lot of annoyance and distraction. Lyle Talbot, Ponie Adams and the rest of the cast are all solid pros but the rambling story and ultra cheap production values (no Batmoble in sight, just a nondiscript tan colored sedan)I think three stars might be pushing it a little.  Overall, it looked like Batman and Robin wandered onto the set of a Three Stooges short.

This serial's interpretation of Batman comes closest to capturing the hard boiled detective angle of the early Batman stories. When Batman's creator, Bob Kane, saw Duncan the first time during auditions, he said, ""That's Robin!""

880714,5,6304459661,"This is a 2 disc set complete with all 15 chapters of Batman and Robin (including teasers), Directed by Spenser Gordon Bennet, and starring Robert Lowery and Johnny Duncan as Batman and Robin.

This series was the 2nd original Batman series made for cinema, the first being released in 1943.  This, along with the other Batman movie serial set the tone for the later to come Batman movies and tv serials, although there have been dramatic changes through the years.

Not nearly as campy as the 1960's tv series, Batman and Robin are Gotham's heroic crime fighting duo, dressed in tights and capes, and leading their double life.

I purchased this serial for the purpose of reviewing for Classic Cinema Online, I'm comparing live action Batmans from the 1940's to the present.  This serial, along with the others, is enjoyable to watch and even solicited a giggle or two out of me.

I highly recommend this series, along with the others, to any Batman buff.  In addition to being good family entertainment, it's an important and historical part of the Batman collection.

880719,4,6304459661,"Following the success of their 1948 ""Superman"" serial, the producers created this fifteen-part serial starring DC Comics' number two superhero in 1949. ""Batman and Robin"" (not to be confused with the disastrous 1997 film) follows the Dark Knight and the Boy Wonder as they take on the villainous Wizard and his deadly remote control device that allows him to control any kind of transportation. The serial is a fun-filled adventure, but the story drags at times, especially because of the fact that we see Batman and Robin defeated by the Wizard's henchmen at least once in the majority of these fifteen episodes. Still, the cast and crew do a credible job, despite the obvious low budget and a story with bouts of illogical moments. If you're a fan of the 1940s and 50s serials, then you'll find much to enjoy in ""Batman and Robin.""

880800,5,6304459661,Batman and Robin the complete 1949 serial collection is wonderful. It takes you back to the matinees at our local Hoyts in Australia. i have episode 8 of the original 16 mm print.  The transfer quality to DVD is magic! It does not stand up to to much scrutiny but what the heck it is great fun When a modern! car goes over a cliff it is an old clapped out one that lands. I recommend this to anyone !,1270598400,,400,4.0
880801,4,6304459661,"The worst things are about this serial are Batman and Robin's masks, which are indeed atrocious. My experience watching it, however, was that by the end of the 2nd chapter I had gotten used to them, as well as Robert Lowry's gut, and they no longer distracted me from enjoying this better-than-average-late-period Columbia serial.

Overall, Robert Lowry and Johnny Duncan make pretty good heroes. Lowry has a good voice, and is handsome when he is Bruce Wayne, and is convincing when he gets tough. There is a neat part where Batman is standing right up straight to a thug and lets the thug punch him in the face, but Batman doesn't even flinch, simply saying, 'that hurt,' and then slugging and knocking out the thug.

Johnny Duncan has a receding hairline and looks about 30, but he has a build like a college wrestler and is credible as Robin, despite some ridiculous fight choreography for the character: Robin does a lot of really goofy stuff in fight scenes, like riding a thug's back, and getting on all fours to trip a running thug. I guess the idea was that was a how a kid would fight, but with a 30 year old it's just embarrassing. I just hope Burt Ward appreciated the fight choreographers 20th Century Fox provided him for the TV series.

Fortunately, Batman fares much better in the fight scenes, and there are no special Bat-weapons here, just good-old-fashioned fisticuffs, which is appropriate for a serial. (Although it would have been cool if at least our heroes had done some rope climbing or swinging, as there is no such action in this serial).

This serial is faithful to the source material (as it existed in 1949), as there is a Bat-Signal, Alfred the Butler, Commissioner Gordon, and a Bat-Cave. Crooks refer to our hero as 'The Batman,' and generally refer to Robin as 'Batman's pal' as though they are too polite to state what they suspect the true nature of the relationship to be.

This serial introduced the character Vicki Vale, who is probably the most annoying female character ever to appear in Batman comics. The hapless actress who plays her does not fare well, being far less appealing than Jean Rogers, Noel Niell, or Louise Currie on their worst days. Nonetheless, Miss Vale does play an important role in the story, and so we can tolerate her presence.

The villain, the Wizard, is a better-than-average serial villain, but not as good as Ming the Merciless or Lyle Talbot's Lex Luthor. The action is mostly very good, with a nice fight scene staged atop an actual moving freight train at one point (although in an early chapter, our heroes surrender to armed thugs w/o a fight in one scene: this mistake is never made again, thankfully).

The cliffhangers are average to good, with a few of the usual 'cheat' escapes. The plot moves along and there is some fun business as Batman employs some low tech deception to protect his secret identity, and other nifty stuff.

Overall, the plausibility factor here is average to good for serials, and certainly much better than it would be by early 1950's. 1949 and 1950 featured this serial, King of the Rocketmen, and Atom Man Vs. Superman, which were all very good serials, but by the1952 the average serial was too silly even for a serial fan to enjoy much. So I tend to look at this period as kind of the last hurrah of the serial genre.

This serial is played straight, as opposed the Adam West and Joel Schumacher versions of Batman, yet does not take it self over-seriously like the last 2 Batman movies have done.  It moves along at a nice pace yet is not hyperactive.

I would recommend this to fans of serials, old movies, B-Movies, and fans of golden age comic books. Modern viewers, used to CGI, ultra-violence, and Batmen wearing fake rubber muscles and nipples will probably not enjoy this, and they can keep their sadistic, nihilistic, self-pitying hero. This serial is more enjoyable to me than any of the last 5 Batman feature length films.",1269907200,,3941,4.688856729377713
880802,5,6304459661,"I was born in the 70s, so I can't say that this brings back any memories for me. However, I do typically love tv/movie interpretations of DC Comics heroes and villains and this is no exception. For those who have actually read old Batman comics, like myself, this serial is just about perfect. It's hard to tell in black and white, but if that ""Batmobile"" is red then it is a perfect copy of the old comics' version of Batman's original transport. The Wizard is an awesome villain, that should have been portrayed in the comic books, but wasn't. Every episode's finale makes you feel like you were there by stating things like, ""see Robin Meets The Wizard, next week at this theatre"". That is huge for someone who was never at that theatre like myself. They have great cliffhangers that make you want to watch the next episode immediately. Of course, there are moments of cheese (like Batman and Robin getting their uniforms out of a filing cabinet) which only makes this serial relate more to the goofy issues of Detective Comics or Batman that existed in the late 40s and early 50s.

880804,4,6304459661,"With this review, I'm retracting what I said in my 1943 serial review about the villains but I'll get to that in a bit. This quasi-sequel, I think, looks better than the previous attempt. Sure, the Dynamic Duo and their alter-egos drive the same car, as cleverly noted by Vicki in one chapter, albeit with the top up when they're in costume. The plot in this is your standard superhero story though I wish that the writers used a well known villain for this instead an obscure comics villain (though the Wizard of the comics is very different than the one seen in the film). Now actor-wise; Robert Lowery is definately a step up from Lewis Wilson. For one he doesn't have that accent. It's a shame though Lowery's costume looked cheaper than Wilson's. John Duncan as Robin, I've mixed feelings on. He's way better than Croft and O'Donnell. He just doesn't seem to give the character any urgency in any given situation, even after ""Batman's"" fallen to his apparent death. Again the current girlfriend of the comics is used; Jane Adams' Vicki Vale seems, to me anyway, on the same level as Kim Basinger's; a damsel in distress but useful in some aspects. Adams' portrayal feels Oscar worthy when compared to Shirley Patterson's Linda Page. Now onto the villain; as I said before, Dr. Daka was better than the Wizard. My gosh was I wrong! True Daka has a couple things above the Wizard (evil hideout for one) but the Wizard is more involved in his evil doings than Daka. And speaking of the Caped Crusaders' deceased nemesis, it's OK everybody. There are no racial slurs anywhere in this picture.",1247702400,,1593,4.672597864768683

In this movie serial collection, Batman and Robin face off against The Wizard(a hooded villain whose identity remains a mystery until the end) and his gang of evil hoodlums. While this serial was made on a much lower budget than the first serial, this serial is regarded as the better of the two in terms of acting, plot devices, action and whatnot.

I must admit, I got this DVD Collection the same time I got the 1943 Serial Collection so I'm just getting around to finishing it now. I love it and am really glad I added it to my collection. Would I recommend it to other Batman fans out there? Most certainly...if only for nostalgia sake and nothing else. True, it's hard to get past a thirty-year old man playing The Boy Wonder when he is supposed to be a young boy among other little flaws but it is a great serial, nonetheless.

Now, if we could just get the powers to be out there to release the 60s television show in a DVD Collection...I'd be a happy camper. I've got, practically, every last live-action/animated version of Batman there is out there and that would top it.",1217894400,,1214,4.564220183486238

They don't seem to worry about driving the same car in both their civilian and super-hero identities, nor do they worry too much about pulling up outside Wayne Manor (a quite modest suburban house) and running up the driveway in their capes.

of Superman.

Typical classic moments include Batman's cowl (Face Mask) being to large for Batman's (Robert Lowery) face, with the result that it slips down past his eyes and he regularly compensates by having to raise his face to the sky to see underneath the eyeholes. An absolute classic moment!!!

As well as this when the Dynamic Duo go one to one with the bad guys in a fight they more often than not get duffed up.

The Batcave consists of a filing cabinet to store their costumes (where else) and a microscope to play the part of a laboratory.

Unlike the 1943 series you will find no racial humor is this one. Its funny to compare the villians between the 1943 'Docter Dekker' who had no mask to in this series in 1949 'The Wizard' who was completly masked.

It would have been cool if they could have made some special features with the orignial move trailers or shown some of the lobby cards and posters still around today.

This series is pretty good for how old it is. I think this will only be enjoyed by people who really appreciate the true original Bob Kane story of batman. Not the new interpretations of who Batman really is. Even though Bob didn't have much to with this movie, it did for the most part hold true to the comics. Also, Alfred came from this and was later added to the comic and Adam West TV Show.

Most people would say why do you like the original comic and the TV show? It's because the TV show is great. It mocks everything and because comic books are not serious they are ridiculous by nature. If you really look at the TV show and the comic book objectively you will find they are pretty close. The only reason why comic lovers hated the TV show was because comic book readers think the characters real and don't understand the underline mockery. The interpretations of comic book readers was skewed. The TV show did an excellent job of mocking all seriousness.

881120,2,6304459661,The title says it all. Rent before you buy. I watched this in about a day. The chapters are really short. (about 15 minutes) This is the kind of movie you watch when you don't have anything else to do. There are a few suprises in the plot. Vicki Vale's character doesn't help either. Lois Lane is a lot better. I have to say that the two Superman serials starring Kirk Allen and even the other Batman one starring Lewis Wilson and J. Carol Naish is a lot better then this! This is the poorest quality movie serial I've seen!,1119139200,2,524,4.25
881121,4,6304459661,"In response to another review below, someone mentioned that he remembered the first episode being about 10 minutes longer than the VHS release.  I have seen both the VHS release and the dvd and can verify that, yes, the first episode of the dvd edition is about 9 or 10 minutes longer.  The additional footage helps it make a bit more sense, though nothing critical was left out.

The picture quality is good for something this old.  It's still pretty hokey, but it's good for what it was.  It's fun to see Batman in the 1940's, just 10 years after his creation and to see how the character has evolved over the years.

I wonder why they didn't use the box art from the vhs release?

I too would like to see the 1943 movie serials released on dvd, and the 1960's Batman television show as well.  With the new Batman Begins movie about to open in theaters, what better time?",1114819200,8,873,4.37888198757764
881122,4,6304459661,"Approach serials with this one thought in mind--when they were made, they were the filler before the main event. As a result, no, they didn't have great budgets or highly talented actors. In addition, comic book characters were not approached with the same sense of reverence they are now (perhaps a little TOO much reverence sometimes). There is no batmobile, no Joker or Penguin. Still, this is a fairly typical, and entertaining serial from the 1940's that's a lot more family friendly than some of the other superhero fare being marketed these days. Worth a look, and since it probably won't be around for long, you might want to snatch it up while you can. The sound and picture quality are quite good.",1114732800,5,707,4.7560975609756095

881124,5,6304459661,"Okay, okay!  I know the budget was almost non existant. But I'm referring to the fun, excitement, and adventure! Something modern day film makers have either forgotten or just prefer the special effects tell the story instead. All the shortcomings mentioned in other reviews are true. However the shortcomings are as human as the people involved. This can be watched almost anytime but my favorite time is on a rainy Sunday afternoon. Robert Lowrey's contrasting portrayal of Bruce Wayne and Batman is still the best on screen performance I've ever seen.  So if you're really into Batman and all his incarnations, buy this. I promise youll enjoy it immensly. It is far more entertaining than the 1997 Clooney, O'Donnell version of the same name.",1113868800,4,745,5.0
881125,5,6304459661,"I'll admit I'm not familiar with the 1943 serial. The serials I *am* familiar with (including the creaky Poverty Row Lugosi ones) are really MUCH worse than this, at least for pure **entertainment** value. But perhaps my ""entertainment scale"" is different - I can't recall such a high knee-slapper/howler ratio in anything other than an Ed Wood movie. The dialogue isn't just stilted - it's moronic on every conceivable level! (After Batman gets the stuffing beat out of him and is picking himself up off the edirt, Robin helpfully points out that the crooks ""are getting away in their car"". Gee - THAT'S why they call him the ""Boy Wonder"" (though he looks closer to 30 than 20). Frequently, the actors look as though they are improvising or just saying whatever comes into their head. And although the action is downright FRANTIC (numerous fistfights, burning buildings, spectacular car-off-the-cliff crashes, gunfights, airplanes exploding, etc.), the actual plot never moves forward. Things I learned: radioactive money bursts into flames when removed from it's envelope. Getting a daily beating doesn't affect your handsome good looks. Changing into a bat costume in the back of a convertible doesn't attract any attention. ""Remote control"" machines run on diamonds. The ""Bat Signal"" works at high noon. Gotham City doesn't have any buildings - it's out in the middle of the California desert somewhere. Batman's ""utility belt"" can hold a full-sized acetylene torch, including the tank, without showing. ""Wayne Manor"" is right next door to the Cleaver's house. The ""Bat Cave"" is underneath that, but is about the right size for a basement. (And it includes the shadows of rubber bats flitting around, too.) I could go on, but I hope that you get the idea. I was a little worried that I'd be sitting through some ""Commando Cody""-style drek, but please, take my word for it - this is some of the best, most riffable material I have EVER seen. My absolute highest recommendation. (If you like that sort of thing, that is!!!)",1113523200,13,2025,5.01186943620178
881126,3,6304459661,"There were many scenes which kept me tied to my seat but I did notice some bloopers that could have been easily avoided.  Maybe it is not fair to compare the 40's Batman style to the 60's, 80's and 90's style as it progresed as time went on.  They got a fancy Batmobile, a different way of entering the Batcave, among other advanced changes.  One thing that was kept the same, Batman knew the criminals move even before the criminals made their move.  Personally, I prefer the cloth outfits in the 60s Batman to the rubber ones in they wore in the 80s and 90s version.",1112140800,6,568,4.330188679245283
881127,2,6304459661,"The first Batman serial from 1943 was a very good serial of it's day.  Dated by today's standards but it did a wonderful job of capturing the look and flavor of the Bob Kane gritty batman.  Add to that that it had a strong lead in Lewis Wilson, great villian in character actor J. Carrol Naish, and a talented Director in Lambert Hillyer and it made for a great serial.

Batman and Robin has none of that, unfortunately.  Robert Lowery, much like Dick Purcell in the Captain America serial is FAR too out of shape for the role and he makes Adam West look like Schwarzenegger.  Spencer Gordon Bennett was a veteran of directing movie serials but he was strictly less than a ""B"" director.  The film looks cheap in every way.  Serials were almost always low budgets but good directors had a way of getting the most out of what they had to work with.  Not the case here as all the sets look cheesy, the script is laughable, the acting stiff as a board, and the costumes look like your Aunt Rose sewed them together in her basement the night before the costume party.

The plot involves some typical 1940's hokum about a remote control device that can take control of any moving vehicle that is stolen by a masked villian known as The Wizard.  On top of that the machines needs diamonds to fuel it!!!  So we get Batman & Robin trying to track down the wizard and foil all of his plots.  The stupid villian had a device that allowed him to spy on Batman but for some reason never used it when Batman was about to bust up one of his schemes.

John Duncan fares slightly better as Robin than Lowery does as Batman.  He at least looks slightly athletic even if the stunt double is completely obvious.  Oh and there's no batmobile...not even an attempt to make one.  Just the caped crusaders driving around in an off the lot convertible.

It's not completely horrible.  There are some nice cliff-hangers and pretty decent action sequences.  The Wizard is suitably scary for kids if a bit over the top.  One just wishes that more care and money would have gone into the production to make it at least a B serial.",1110326400,15,2101,4.407792207792208
881178,2,6304459661,"Somebody has a lot of nerve with the cover art to this dvd, not only with a cool, Keaton-esque Bat-costume, but the modern-day Robin suit (with green leggings, etc.) to boot! The actual serial has hands-down the worst Batman costume in cinema history (his bat-ears stick out at an angle on the sides of his head, like devil-horns), and looks NOTHING like this artwork! Talk about bait and switch! The serial itself is mildly entertaining in an extremely chintzy way, though far inferior to the earlier BATMAN serial, which had a much better costume, but was also extremely racist (we were in the middle of WW2 when it was made), which may be why it still hasn't debuted on dvd. The best part of this serial is the moment where Batman reaches behind his back and pulls out a HUGE welding torch (supposedly from his utility belt) to try and open a steel door. Funny stuff.",1109980800,23,870,4.583333333333333

881181,5,6304459661,"This does go on a bit, but it's still quite good.  The Wizard is a great villan who probably wouldn't have worked in the films but could have been done in a multi-part cartoon or even the Adam West tv series. I agree it is a little bit of a stretch for Batman to be driving Bruce Wayne's car and no one questions it. I'm not positive, but I think there was another Batman movie serial like this done before or after this one, but I've never seen it advertised for sale. I would recomend this for a rainy day afternoon viewing with the whole family.",1047168000,3,548,4.169811320754717
881182,3,6304459661,"I can only recall having seen two 40's era movie serials, CAPTAIN MARVEL-1941 (CM) and BATMAN & ROBIN-1949 (BM&R) and so can only base my opinions on serials made during this time based on these two films.  Both films followed the same premise of having the hero(s) track down a mysterious masked villan who through the use of advanced technology, technology which doesn't even exist today, and an endless supply of thug labor attempts to exert control over others.  CM has 12 chapters and BM&R has 15 chapters.  One chapter would be shown each week with a cliffhanger ending until the final chapter ends the serial by unmasking the villan and ending the crime spree.  Both serials come across as a mix of mystery, action and suspense.  Although the mystery of trying to figure out who is the masked villan is not a true mystery.  A true mystery leaves clues so that the viewer can possibly figure out the mystery.  In these serials clues are withheld until the villan is unmasked and the viewer finds out it is someone to whom the given clues did not point.
I think CM was the better of the 2 serial but BM&R was enjoyable.  In each episode Batman & Robin would track down the masked villan known as the Wizard.  The Wizard was able to control any moving vehicle with a machine he stole.  He needed diamonds to power the machine.  The Wizard also attempted to steal an experimental explosive.  The Wizard also had a machine that could see anywhere.  He could view his hired help, follow the Batman and Robin and other such things.  However, he never used it to alert his thug help that Batman & Robin were approaching or to track Batman & Robin to their hideout.  The Wizard could also hypnotize people with his blinking eyes.  From a childs perspective the Wizard is very deadly and powerful.  From an adults perspective The Wizard is too powerful to be believed and isn't smart enough to use the power effectively.
Batman & Robin have what would be considered by modern standards as lame costumes.  Robin has a descent costume but the Batman costume looks as though it were made from pajamas and a devils mask.  It is obvious to all that have seen both Bruce Wayne & Dick Grayson and Batman & Robin that they are are the same persons.  They don't even try to mask their voices.  The Batcave is very cheezy and the Wayne Manor looks less like a mansion and more like a middle class home in the Gothem suburbs.  Why Batman and Robin even wear utility belts is beyond me as they seldom use them.  The less said about the Batcar the better.  Also there are no super villans so Batman & Robin beat up the same thugs over and over in each chapter.
Having said all this I must end it by saying the serial is highly enjoyable.  No one watches this expecting to see award winning acting or a story that will be nominated for an Oscar.  The viewer just enjoys the story for what it is.  A way to escape for a short while.  Looking for the flaws in the serial is as much fun as watching the story itself.  The cliffhanger endings usually show the certain demise of the hero(s) and even though you know they survive you can't help but to look forward to the next chapter to see by what implausible means they were able to escape death.
So if your a fan of old serials or Batman & Robin this would probably be worth watching and is available on VHS.  Due to the many chapters and that the entire serial takes up 2 VHS tapes it would be nice if this came out on DVD.  The entire serial would fit on 1 DVD and the DVD chapters would make it easier to pick up the viewing where you last left off.",1044921600,4,3583,4.375189107413011
881183,3,6304459661,"This 1949 serial will be of interest mainly to Batman and/or serial fanatics.  It is fun to watch, though much of the fun comes from the improbabilities and inconsistencies.  For instance, there's no Batmobile, just a car which can be identified as Bruce Wayne's car.  Nobody except Bruce Wayne's girl friend, Vickie Vale, seems to notice this.
There are very few good chapter endings here.  Most of them are either lame or boring or borderline cheating.
The characters are interesting, though.  The villianous Wizard's
identity is of course kept secret until the last chapter, and you're given several red herrings to puzzle over, one of which is a bit overly done.
A serial based on as popular a comic book hero as Batman should've been much better, but those who really enjoy the genre will probably want this, chiefly because it's one of the two serials featuring the Dynamic Duo.",1029283200,50,884,4.866666666666666

Yeah, okay, so the 1949 Batman Serial was not exactly ""cutting edge"" or ""mind-blowing"" or ""good"", but it has its charm. The dialogue is ridiculous, the fight scenes are clumbsy, and the costumes are ill-fitting at best, but for some reason, I absolutely love it. This floppy-eared incarnation of the Dark Knight is more a film noir private investigator than the shadowy, rooftop avenger that we know today. He and the Boy Wonder spend less time lurking in the Bat Cave and more time beating up the Wizard's greasy haired, fedora wearing thugs. Oh...and the Wizard! This guy is actually a pretty good villain. He is cloaked head-to-toe, has blank, glowing eyes, appears from time to time as a phantom, and remains a mystery through most of the serial. Pretty creepy dude, if you ask me, and a fitting opponent for Batman and Robin. If you're thinking about buying this one, take off your critic's hat and enjoy this gem for what it is: an old-school Bat-brawl. It's fedora bashin' fun!",1024790400,39,1088,4.731578947368421

Rather, this is the 1949 sequel, which is a straight crime melodrama with good and bad points in about equal measure. On the minus side, the first half doesn't go anywhere, with a sketchy story and unimpressive action (Batman's dangerous leaps are shown in ""safe"" close shots, for example). The script is uneven, the identity of the masked villain is predictable, and the production values are of the bargain-basement variety. On the plus side, however, decent direction and a hard-working cast smooth over the rough spots, and things get moving in the second half (faster pace, more elaborate stunts).

Both halves average out to an average serial, disappointing for Batman enthusiasts but okay for serial fans and B-movie buffs. Picture and sound quality are very good.",977356800,9,868,5.156028368794326

Despite low-budget shortcomings, there's plenty of hokey fun as Batman and Robin face one contrived cliffhanger after another. The mysterious Wizard makes for an interesting villain, since he never appeared in the comic books.  Robert Lowery does a good job as Batman, but John Duncan's Boy Wonder looks like a juvenile delinquent. It's nice to see Lyle Talbot as Commissioner Gordon, even though he has a tendency to activate the Bat Signal in broad daylight.
