5170725,5,B008NNY9YE,This should be listed as a title being released by funimation as a dvd/bluray combo pack and the dvd region should be fine to play in your standard dvd or bluray player. This collects the first 4 volumes of the series that was realeased ahile back and then was forced to stop production for reason now many hellsing fans are familliar with. Now with the title being rereleased by funimation you can rest assured that the rest of the series won't be to far behind :),1343692800,3,465,4.4186046511627906

5170741,4,B008NNY9YE,"If you've seen Hellsing, you may be a bit disappointed since this series speeds thru all the best parts of that series, taking well developed characters and either cutting them out or giving them much less development.  Also the 4 volumes in this collection are episodes/  But, much like the animated Spawn series, they are extra long episodes.  Essentially this series begins on episode 3, where it finally diverges from the first anime series.",1494547200,2,445,4.986486486486487

5170743,3,B008NNY9YE,"Great animation, crazy bloody and doesn't hold anything back.  However there is way way WAY too much monologue and they could have condensed everything down into 6-8 episodes very easily without losing literally ANY content or storyline.

I mean I liked it but by the time I finished watching it it felt like I was actually working to stick with it through all the episodes.

Also, all 10 episodes are on Hulu right now.  If you aren't a member you could just do a 7 day trial and knock this out without paying a dime, or if you are a subscriber there you go.  There are multiple ways to DVR this from Hulu if you are someone who wants to keep it such as PlayOn.",1491696000,2,662,4.264

In all seriousness, if you're looking for a great bloodbath in anime and can't get enough, start here. Volumes 1-4 help set the scene perfectly and Volumes 5-8 are well worth the cash. Volumes 9 & 10 are up there, mostly for the final confrontation and conclusion, but still worth every penny.

If you're unsure of whether or not you'll enjoy this, watch Hellsing Ultimate Abridged by TeamFourStar on YouTube. They did an amazing job of making the episodes funny without removing what the show offers. Don't get hung up if you think the language is too much, but do keep in mind that it is Rated TV-MA for a reason.",1488844800,,671,4.826086956521739

5170746,1,B008NNY9YE,"I can't believe how much this anime costs. Who would spend $100 to watch 10 episodes? And why split 10 episodes across three boxes? Bundle all ten episodes together in a single package for about $29.99, and I would buy it. I'm willing to spend my hard earned money on the anime, but come on, it needs to be fairly priced.

For example, Steins Gate is 100 more minutes of content and only $27 for the COMPLETE box set as of this writing.",1484092800,2,436,4.253012048192771

This is essentially a western movie, though.  If you watch anime because you're interested in the insightful, truth-speaking, high-quality film that many Japanese anime studios put out, though, you'll feel just as horridly betrayed as I when you see how London's financiers have begun to successfully infect Japan.",1424995200,,551,5.2988505747126435

5170835,4,B008NNY9YE,"If you're looking for a show that's action packed this is for you. Very violent, bloody, and graphic. The animation is really good but their are a few moments when it does not hold up on the blu ray. This really isn't a character driven show, and they seem to take a back seat to the action scenes.

I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great action anime.",1419465600,,367,4.169014084507042
5170836,5,B008NNY9YE,"The very instant I finished watching the first volume, I knew this would be the very first Blu-Ray I would buy.  The animation is amazing, even by anime's standards, the story is very dark and Alucard is very complex, with his dark personality yet positive beliefs such as his wish to be killed by a human rather than a monster.

At times the series has comedic moments such as with Seras' dreams.

The case itself is awesome, giving a good insult to Twilight and showcasing how much more awesome this was over Twilight.  I have actually seen the first Twilight movie and I agree fully that Hellsing is far superior.",1419120000,2,616,4.572727272727272

5170838,5,B008NNY9YE,This series is a partial remake of the Hellsing TV anime.  Hellsing Ultimate offers 10 Volumes of around 50 minutes each.  The original TV series is compressed into the first three episodes with some alterations.  From there on it resurrects The Third Reich (As The Millennium Organization) who've been waiting patiently to once again rain destruction upon England with an army of undead.  The Iscariot Organization is far from the real Catholic Church in doctrine but in this show their mission isn't to evangelize anyway.  The artwork is excellent.  The sound track is excellent.  The English dub is excellent.,1417305600,,612,5.121212121212121

5170855,5,B008NNY9YE,"One of the most epic, bloody, s*** storm shows i've ever seen. I really dislike the hole general vampire/zombie genre so i was extremely hesitant to watch this show knowing its about exactly that vampires&gooles(zombies) but once i watch 10minutes of this show i knew i made a terrible mistake by putting off this show for so long! If you like profound language, excessive over the top violence, blood and guts, guns and epic crazy fights, you will absolutely LOVE this show. Hell i think you could hate vampires & zombies with a passion and still absolutely love this show. If you were a fan of ""Black Lagoon"", ""Darker than Black"", ""Mirai Nikki(Future Diary)"", ""Deadman Wonderland"" or ""Jormungand"" i can assure you'll LOVE this anime, worth every penny.

And for the record you do not have to have seen the original series ""Hellsing"" as they're different story lines, apparently the original version didn't follow the manga through to the end and ""Hellsing UItimate"" does just that. I have never seen ""Hellsing"" and had absolutely no trouble following or understanding the story.",1416009600,2,1080,4.966850828729282

5170874,3,B008NNY9YE,"This is a review for the first 8 volumes. I only watched a little bit of the original and really enjoyed it so I ended up getting this (after testing the waters watching the first episode). This one was pretty good but felt very over the top at some points. The action is superb. The story had potential, but every time it felt like they were building to a climactic scene there was just something that made it feel ""campy"". ""Campy"" didn't work well with gruesome for me. The only part that I really ""felt"" the story line and thoroughly enjoyed was the scene with Seras and Zorin. That was an epic scene that almost made the series worth watching but had few moments to shine afterwords.

The packaging and shipping were both perfect, so that wasn't an issue at all. I'm a bit weary of getting the third just because the series was left at a point where I didn't think I'd enjoy continuing onward with tons of other good anime out there.",1409097600,,937,4.385057471264368

8529212,5,B008NNY9YE,"When I first saw the beginning of this I thought it would be a reboot of the original Hellsing, but as I continued to watch I became pleasantly surprised at the expansion. While I would have preferred to get all the episodes in one set, I devoured my own wings in order to soar with the bird of Hermes. the first two sets only have four episodes - but each episode is about 45 minutes - so its really like you are getting 8 episodes per set. Although the last set (set 3) I believe has two episodes. I am increasingly annoyed with having to purchase the BlueRay combo sets just to get the DVD versions. I will not budge off of DVD unless forced to - but now that I have a bunch of Blue Ray disks (Attack on Titan, Shakugan no Shana, Overlord) I may begrudgingly get a player in the future and utilize both formats. This series is violent and bloody. When Alucard removes restrictions in order to tap into more power I thought of Trinity Blood right away. The best parts are when he goes into his black mass eyeball/wolf mode and destroys those who think they are bad ass - like the eldest Valentine brother. In some ways Alucard is a likeable anti-hero - especially in his relationship to Seras Victoria, but in other ways the viewer realizes that his nature in unhinged and unbounded if not kept in check just like any wild animal. If you like the original Hellsing or any other wild bloody anime (Attack on Titan. Claymore, Berserk) give this one a shot - its worth it - even while begrudgingly having to buy three separate sets.",1525392000,,1531,4.356643356643357

8529216,5,B008NNY9YE,"This anime series is one of my favorite. I even enjoy Team Four Stars Abridged version and the original TV episodes. This is not an anime for younger viewers. There are vampires, Ghouls, Nazi vampires, and organizations that fight against the things that go bump in the night. Lots of blood, violence, gunfire, and sadistic humor. Highly enjoyable and entertaining. If you like the action or horror based anime give this one a check. The ultimate has a faster pace than the TV episodes do. still love the anime and re-watch it regularly.
