4312991,4,B004B331QW,This simple film has twist and turns that well keep you on the edge of your seat.  The actors are spot on and the directing and cinematography is breath-taking.  A Must SEE Movie!!,1289260800,,180,4.424242424242424
4312992,5,B004B331QW,"This is by far the best independent horror film I have ever seen hands down! I work in the industry myself and I was utterly amazed at how professional everything looked and the high quality of the cinematography and lighting. The use of sound effects and original music made the film that much more enthralling and believable. The actors in the film were superb, every last character in the film was strong and forthright in their roles, top notch acting across the board! So many movies wish to call themselves ""Horror"" while having little to no horrific elements at all, there were moments of actual dread and terror in this film where the audience themselves are left hanging on the edge of their seats waiting with breathless anticipation of what may be coming around the corner! The story line takes an original look at a tried and true tale while the plot unfolds in a masterfully suspenseful way! I have nothing but the highest praise for all involved in the creation of this enormously entertaining film especially Wayne Slaten who is destined to become a big name in Hollywood!

I highly recommend this fantastic film to anyone who loves horror, suspense, thrillers or dramas and to anyone looking to become a film-maker themselves as this is an excellent learning tool and the epitome of what every artist strives for! An excellent film, a winner by all accounts!",1289260800,,1374,4.7974683544303796
4312993,5,B004B331QW,"Backroad is set in East Texas, where evil sometimes wears a cowboy hat. The peaceful countryside is contrasted to the disturbing scenes of violence that punctuate this artistically composed story of how evil grows, and sometimes, how it all ends up. The performances were excellent, neither understated nor overdone. The cinematography was impressive, especially considering the fact that this was all done on a shoestring. The story was disturbing, a bit intense for me at moments, but not a plot less gore-fest, as so many horror films have gotten to be. There is enough ambiguity and symbolism to make me pay attention and think a bit, to make me discuss the film with others, and to make me want to see it again. In fact, I bought the DVD, and I hope that they give it a wider release at some point. Having a rare limited-edition copy won't do me any good, since I refuse to sell it.",1289174400,5,887,4.620253164556962
4312994,5,B004B331QW,The cinematography is stunning and the performances are first rate. The film is edgy and disturbing without gratuitous sex and gore.  This is one you'll want to watch again and again!,1289174400,,183,4.903225806451613
4312995,5,B004B331QW,"Backroad is one of those movies that makes you extremely uncomfortable in a all the right ways. Definite must see, the cinematography in the first 3 or 4 minute alone is gorgeously disturbing but not in the torture porn way. This is definitely a cerebral film that begs for a second and third view, and something new will strike you with each pass. If you like your horror to screw with your head more than your stomach I HIGHLY recommend Mr. Slaten's Backroad.",1289174400,3,461,4.566265060240964
4312996,5,B004B331QW,"BACKROAD is a wild ride down a dusty road to places we fear MIGHT exist. The acting is stellar, the cinematography outstanding, and the story engaging.
Big surprise of an independent film! You will enjoy this one.",1289088000,2,213,4.783783783783784
4312997,5,B004B331QW,"This movie premiered in Houston, TX at the Alamo Drafthouse Theatre. It was sold out, but I was able to get a last minute ticket. I really enjoyed the movie, acting caught you from the moment the movie started, the cinematography is like a big budget movie and the story has many twists and turns. A great supernatural thriller.",1289088000,4,328,4.576271186440678

8421386,1,B004B331QW,"Is this one of the ""films"" that keep southerners Godfearing? This has the feel of a high school film project and the acting is way below par.",1452988800,,141,4.2592592592592595
8421387,3,B004B331QW,I could have done without the sex scenes. It makes the movie trashy.,1452124800,,68,4.3076923076923075
8421388,1,B004B331QW,"Its slow but weird put way I did stuff while it was on I don't usually do that while watching a movie, so its bad.",1451952000,,114,3.6
8421389,2,B004B331QW,actually not worth 3 stars not much action and overall dull didn't hate it but it was just blah,1451779200,,95,4.052631578947368
8421390,1,B004B331QW,I think they used all the enticing scenes in the trailer to lure you in. Less than expected and disappointing.,1419811200,,110,4.55
8421391,3,B004B331QW,"OK.  Pretty weird.  No Oscar's, but entertaining.",1419206400,,49,5.857142857142857
8421392,1,B004B331QW,"A confusing chronological order and unrevealing flashbacks mar this Indie thriller.  An overusage of pointless panoramic vistas doesn't help either.  None of the characters are likeable, especially the psychotic Jasper and Joseph, the mysterious stranger.  The finale is senseless and does little to bring resolution.  BACKROAD is obviously intended to be a parable on good vs. evil, but ends up a disjointed example of style over substance---and the acting is pretty bad!",1357516800,,472,5.513888888888889
8421393,3,B004B331QW,"After one half hour of watching there was still no action and nothing but a few stilted conversations.  And this in a set labeled as ""EXTREME HORROR"".  But it improves with time.",1348963200,,178,4.53125
8421394,5,B004B331QW,"I watch a lot of horror films and in watching what you expect to be your average run of the mill horror film, Backroads was not only surprising but impressive. I love a movie that makes you think and can challenge you. A movie that will make you think about it days and even weeks after you see it. I was shocked and impressed with the director's, Wayne Slaten, hidden and subtle symbolism. The acting, the casting, and the screenplay all come together very nicely to make this a very fun and entertaining pschological horror film. Well done.",1289347200,,542,4.540816326530612
