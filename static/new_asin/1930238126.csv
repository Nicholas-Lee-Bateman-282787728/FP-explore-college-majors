Some others have mistaken it as a travel-log or collection of stunning scenes.  While the scenery is indeed stunningly photographed, the thread that is woven throughout is the Spirit felt by those who experienced it early on, including most significantly John Muir and Teddy Roosevelt.  There is early B&W video of Roosevelt when he declared his Yosemite experience with Muir (after tenting in an early snowstorm) as ""the best day of my life"".  While Yellowstone is the world's first national park, Yosemite is the first wilderness area that was placed in public domain.  It remained a public park only by the best efforts of others who strenuously opposed private interests to log it for profit.  Because of this outstanding video, I have begun to read Muir's own writing of his spiritual experiences in the wilderness.  As I recall, it was written by Dayton Duncan and produced by he and Ken Burns.  Those interested in a travel series would be better advised to view their DVD series ""The National Parks: America's Best Idea"".  I recommend The Spirit of Yosemite to those who wish to share or catch The Spirit of wilderness.",1415232000,,1233,4.913043478260869

""Spirit of Yosemite"" conveys the beauty and history of Yosemite National Park with splendid photography and lyrical narration. It is an exhilirating yet inexplicably relaxing film that will make you long for your next visit.",1392336000,5,396,4.925373134328358

7801385,4,1930238126,"For every national park in the US, there is always a film played in the theater inside/nearby the visitor center. This film is just the one played in the theater of Yosemite National Park.

The quality of the scene is without doubt the strength of this film. From the director's commentary in this DVD, all scenes are shot before 10:00am and after 4:00pm to get the best of the park. Although the running time of this film is just about 30 minutes, it is enjoyable to watch, especially if you have a home theater. Maybe you can first see it in the theater and then decide if you want it or not when you visit this park.

The coverage of this film is general-purpose, including the most famous scenes like the Half Dome, El Capitan, Yosemite Falls,......, geology, animals, plants, and the human history.

In addition to the main film, there are more scenery shots in the special features, which are worth watching as well. Some concerns and continuing works are also addressed to maintain the park. For me, it's good to know there are still many people putting their efforts and enthusiasm to preserve it and make it enjoyable to every one.",1202774400,6,1140,4.605911330049261
