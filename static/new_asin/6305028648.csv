7882193,3,6305028648,"It covers his life all right, but for music lovers and true fans of FRANK this is not enough. Not a word on NELSON RIDDLE,BILLY MAY and GORDON JENKINS with whom he alterned between 1953 and 1961 on his famous CAPITOL recordings. I learned much more about him reading DEREK JEWELL's biography. What i like best from that video is the funny trailer about PAL JOEY in which FRANK gives a lecture about JOEY. You also see him as BILLY BIGELOW a film he was supposed to do but he simply walked out of the set of CAROUSEL.This documentary covers its subject a little too fast and another hour would have been necessary to tell the whole story well.",973036800,,642,4.4033613445378155
