3004653,5,B000XPNZTK,"This DVD is amazing.  Any fan of Tom Petty or Rock and Roll music should all own this.  The movie is awesome and was made very well.  The 30th anniversary concert is included and it's money.  I was lucky enough to see Tom on this tour and it was a great show.  I have to agree with a previous review concerning 'Good to Be King'.  The live version is mind blowing.  Tom Petty has been making great music for decades and will never be forgotten.  This movie does him justice.  I would buy this again if I lost it, no questions asked.",1196294400,2,532,4.137254901960785
3004654,5,B000XPNZTK,"""I feel pretty blessed really right now, when I see it, that most of us made it through that maze that is growing up in rock 'n' roll,"" he says. ""And I think we've matured in a way that we're maybe better now, you know, maybe better musicians, and enjoying our craft more than we ever have. So I'm very lucky.""  Tom Petty

I found this four hour anthology of Tom Petty and his Heartbreakers on Sundance Channel.  I immediately notified my best friend, and we watched unbelievably spellbound.  This story of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers was directed by Peter Bogdanovich. He begins with the start of Tom Petty's life in Gainesville, Florida and ends with a 2006 commemoration concert of his thirtieth anniversary in music.

The entire story is told through home movies, television shows and rememberances in narrative form. Tom Petty does much of the narrative and this is his profession and  musical life, after all. The list of friends, colleagues and those in the know who knew or played with Tom Petty is remarkable. It is a time line of the history of rock and music. Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison, George Harrison, and Jeff Lynn along with Tom Petty join to form 'The Traveling Wilburys'.  This remarkable group, to a one, votes this time in their lives as one of the most rewarding musical experiences.  Stevie Nicks wants to join Tom Petty and his heartbreakers, but she is a woman and ""this is a men's club"" says Tom Petty.  The sheer sense of Tom's persuasive personality in pursing his career in music is pure genius. Once he set down this path he never looked back. This was his life and what a life it has been.

This movie is about the music. There is some mention of marriage and Tom Petty's daughter is interviewed. Little personal information is shared. What we do have is the music and it is glorious. From ""Breakdown"", ""American Girl"" ""Even the Losers"", ""I Won't Back Down"", ""Learning to Fly"", ""Into the Great Wide Open"", ""Refugee"", ""Straight Into Darkness, ""Don't Do Me Like That"", and on and on.  A homage to Tom Petty and his career.

""Tom Petty And The Heartbreakers: Runnin' Down A Dream remarkably chronicles a prolific career that's yielded dozens of instantly recognizable songs and countless good times for all who've cared to listen. It's an indispensable documentary on one of America's most successful rock and roll bands, whose leader never backed down in aspiring to his ambition."" Donald Gibson

This may be one of the best made rock documentaries. A must see for all of Tom Petty fans and for those who love great rock n' roll.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 11-17-07

3004655,5,B000XPNZTK,"This FOUR HOUR documentary is a must for all Tom Petty fans and honestly anyone weaned on late '70s early '80s Rock 'n' Roll. Spanning Petty's humble beginnings in Gainesville, Florida to the launch of his career in California to his battles with record labels and sleazy lawyers and his ultimate triumph, the documentary finally shows us Petty at the top of the rock heap alongside Jeff Lynn, Bob Dylan and George Harrison, the quintessential independent rocker/ musician/ songwriter. Shows Petty to be the ultimate self-sufficient iconoclast. Bogdanovich shares old reels of Petty's first band Mudcrutch and we see the evolution of a young idealistic kid with a chip on his shoulder transform (over a 30 year period) into a bona fide rock legend. Saw this on Sundance channel and bought the four disc box set which includes a soundtrack CD and the 30th anniversary concert in Gainesville. This documentary is overflowing with interviews, clips, personalities, history and a catalog of live performances. Worth every penny. Worth every second.",1194998400,48,1044,5.183431952662722
3004656,5,B000XPNZTK,"I'm a Petty fan, so I loved the documentary. Bogdanovich does a great job of telling the story of Petty's career, and does a pretty good job of getting all sides of the story. It has all of the in's and out's of a ""Behind the Music,"" with band drama, etc., but focuses mainly on the music. The band members are all thoughtful and insightful in their comments, and what becomes clear is that Petty and the Heartbreakers are consumate craftsmen. Although Petty is the undeniable leader, they work together as a band to create the songs. The Heartbreakers aren't a backup band. To me, this carefully balanced dynamic, which has now led to 30+ years of success, was the most interesting part of the documentary. But the BEST part, by far, was seeing and hearing the various live and demo versions of the songs. Again, Bogdanovich does a great job of giving us enough pure music to enjoy without boring us.

The documentary is long, at about 4 hours. It took me two sittings to get through it, but it never felt long. Again, I'm a Petty fan. If I weren't I'm not sure I'd have had the patience for all of it, but it really helped make the case in my mind that Petty is one of the great modern rockers still working today.",1194825600,9,1216,4.380530973451328
3004657,5,B000XPNZTK,"Just picked up this DVD. The documentary portion is great... in depth, at times funny. It is two DVDs' worth so it took me a few days to see it all. The 30th anniversary concert is quite good. Worth the price for me was the live version of It's Good To Be King. This track, from the Wildflowers album , is one of my favorite Petty songs. The 12-minute live version blows the cd version out of the water. Overall a great buy.",1193616000,8,424,4.120481927710843

3004659,5,B000XPNZTK,Wow! My heart is breaking. I have actually been mourning Tom's death.  AMAZING documentary. I kept checking my mark on time and dreaded the coming of the end of the documentary.  It gave me a sense of connection to him. Wish there was a follow up to add to it from its end til Tom's untimely death. RIP TOM. And the heartbreaker.,1517788800,,329,4.290322580645161
3004660,5,B000XPNZTK,"I put off watching this for years because I expected it to really rag on Gainesville, where Tom and most of the Heartbreakers grew up. I knew Earl in his later years and expected likewise about him. Fortunately, I read Warren Zanes biography PETTY before Toms untimely death. (I highly recommend it, even to casual TPATH fans, and especially anyone who ever lived in Gainesville. I learned so much.)
I could and probably will watch Running Down a Dream every month or so.  It was a lovely dance down my own memory lane, as well as Tom and the bands.
Time and life slip away so quickly. Savor every minute of it and don't waste a moment of it wishing you were somebody else. Just like Tom Petty, you are who you are for a reason. Embrace it. (LOL, him saying he doesnt have a southern accent slayed me.)",1517356800,8,802,4.382550335570469

3004680,3,B000XPNZTK,"Running Down A Dream is a good documentary and not a great one because I feel it's too long and drawn out. This movie could be trimmed greatly into an hour and half long movie and it would be better for it.  The history involving the band members and introduction of the Wilburys / Jeff Lynne were great but the introduction of each and every album were just too much.

Overall 3 stars for me.  It was a decent documentary and could been a lot better. A great example of music documentary is the History of The Eagles, and the Beatles Anthology. Both of these covered albums but in a way that it complemented the stories, and didn't distract from the experience of watching it",1512086400,,676,4.392

3004688,5,B000XPNZTK,"Long term Tom Petty fan here...but my wife wasn't. Until she watched this documentary about a year ago! Very forthcoming and informative. But mostly ENTERTAINING! I love the way we meet his previous producers/managers and find out why/how they left. Then there's the Wilbury story, and how Tom bonded with George Harrison (A+!)
Through it all, his dedication to the song and his sense of justice and fairness prevail. I have a bit of this as well; I'm willing to sacrifice if something isn't right... but he's on another level. (Check out him arguing with the A&R guys about a song for his friend, Roger McGuinn)
And he wears the best damn clothes - later in life! And plays the coolest guitars!
Mike Campbell is a true gentleman, Benmont is the ""mad dog"" (surprise!), Stan Lynch is the foundation with an ego to match Tom's, not enough room for both long-term, Ron Blair is a regular guy who had to leave, but came back and saved the day! Steve Ferrone comes off as a skilled, easygoing guy who was in the right place at the right time, with EXACTLY the right personality to stay in the band. Scott Thurston was a surprise, the damn guy can play ANYTHING with that goofy smile. He's fun to watch.
I remember seeing Tom in concert in the early '90's in Nashville. Unlike many other shows, Tom had FUN performing. He was simply EFFERVESCENT on stage.",1510272000,,1349,4.578512396694215
3004689,5,B000XPNZTK,"I only heard of this great video of an even greater musician the day after his untimely death. (Aren't they all?) I immediately bought it and have watched it twice, so far.
It is a fantastic chronology in the life of one of the best song-writing bands in history.  From their very humble beginnings to to a hard fought super stardom.
I only wish that I'd have seen this years ago.  It would have ignited a desire to see everyone of his shows.
The video shows the struggles, the comradery, and what drove this band to success.
It was well done, from different points in their career.  It was interesting to see the the various stages of each band member's life.
Tom died at the same time of the massacre in Las Vegas. My daughter and her husband were at that event. Thank God they were not hurt.  Those two events made for a very dark week in the world.
Having never been a musician, I can only imagine the ups and downs of creating music. I love watching the creativity of it all.
A must see for any music fan and every Tom Petty fan.
You are already missed, Tom.",1509408000,3,1063,4.27363184079602
3004690,5,B000XPNZTK,"I was COMPLETELY taken by this intimate portrait of the band's history. It's HARD to give a review that ISN'T cliche, at this point, right? (Cannot EVEN FIND the proper spelling for the proper word , ""cliche"" on my keyboard. MAYBE, I need a better keyboard?)
I became quite obsessed with this video about 8 months ago. Couldn't put it away..HAD TO view it nearly EVERY day, so obsessed was I. I fell In LOVE with the band all over again, and even purchased it (the documentary) from Amazon, so I could see it whenever I NEEDED to....time and time again, and yet again. Falling into love with Tom and the Heartbreakers all over again. That IS obsession, is it not?
Petty's story, THIS Heartbreaker's story, is STILL propping me up DAILY. I do NOT know them, PERSONALLY, but after viewing this doc....I FELT as tho' I did.
I believe there are still many, many folks who are hanging on to the NewsPages, every week, or every DAY...just WAITING. WAITING to hear from the Heartbreakers THEMSELVES, about what could POSSIBLY come next for THEM.  THEY'VE got to be spinning their wheels in the  rude, emotional dust of what happened to their bandleader...their Brother? their BAND? I know that I'M still crying. I can't even BEGIN to imagine THEIR pain.  Can ANYBODY??
I really HOPE and WISH, that someone is/was planning a new, "" 10 Year documentary"", about this...this....(honestly, verbal descriptions fail me), Amazing? Wonderful? Fabulous...Far-Out,  Bitchen, Wicked.....Outa-Sight...band?
I guess I'm just hung up on words, when what I REALLY want to remember is how I FELT, when listening to The Heartbreakers
PLAY the song(s) that Tom Petty WROTE and Co-wrote with his friends, his ""family"".
Having fractured MY hip at approximately the same time TOM did (and being only five years apart in age), it's easy for me to understand what pain he was going through. Watching him perform, onstage, I could SEE how he was favouring that hip.  VERY LITTLE cavorting was done, am I right?  I've heard he didn't complain much, (UNLIKE me!) And he stayed true to his audience, caring more about US, than he did HIMSELF,  ""Showing up"", not cancelling. And (he needed a rest) I've read that the ONLY TIME he EVER cancelled a show, is when he had such severe laryngitis, that he couldn't speak for almost a week.
And....AND, he made up for every single show he'd HAD to cancel.  His final interview was illuminating.
And in the end, the love he played, was equal to the love he gave. (Thank you, Beatles).  Love to ALL",1509235200,5,2504,4.764434180138569

Petty comes across as a terrific musician and mostly good guy. He was, however, in the music business and sometimes, in the quest of his vision,  led him to be not so kind to some of the colleagues who helped him to get where he was.
The music is great and Bogdonovitch gives us a good perspective on the genre and evolution of his Pettys style  of music making.

I watched this, glued to the TV, on Netflix. It was so good I decided I had to have it. I was thrilled that Amazon had it on Blu-Ray. I ordered it and it took weeks to get here (no idea why). When it did, I was really disappointed to see that it was basically a disc in a cardboard sleeve. I wanted to add it to my shelf of other movies and music videos, proudly displayed. However, they cheaped out big time and gave me a thing that won't stand on its own, or even be visible if I slide it between two normal cases.

3004747,5,B000XPNZTK,"Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers have become my favorite touring rock band.  The time it took for me to arrive at this juncture was not unlike the long journey of the band itself.  They continued to grow on me.  In music it's many times that the love over time is the best indicator of just how great the music actually is.  I knew I liked the sound back in '78 when I heard Breakdown and by the Damn The Torpedoes album around '80 I was more sure.  Still it took more albums over an ever changing musical landscape to fully appreciate the absolute goodness of their recorded output.  I can't say exactly when they became my favorite band but I must have been in my forties.  I have only become more certain of the band in my mid-fifties.  This is a band that has never let me down and kept building my respect.

So, to correct a great omission I've just now watched Runnin' Down A Dream.  At 4-hours it certainly covers the journey from Tom's youth to the 30th anniversary of the band.  Bogdanovich proves to be a completist and how he got this long-form doc made is a small wonder when these things tend to merely hit the highlights.  It boils down to something very special being documented with great respect.  I recommend it wholly for fans and believe there is a large number of more casual viewers that will come away with a desire to devour this music that, perhaps, they've a small interest in.  It's a journey worth taking for the devoted and any person who appreciates honest American literate music that also rocks hard yet has great nuance.

I've just witnessed the latest in that journey which is the first proper reconvened Mudcrutch tour.  Seeing Mudcrutch in the hallowed Ryman Auditorium in Nashville has immediately placed seeing Mudcrutch at the top of my many years of attending live concerts.  If ever a person was born to do what they're doing it is Tom Petty and seeing Mudcrutch up close makes it totally clear.  He is immeasurably blessed, as are we, that Tom is playing as good as ever with Mike Campbell and Benmont Tench.  It could be called coming full-circle as original drummer Randall Marsh and second guitarist/vocalist Tom Leadon are there too.  The talented Californian Herb Pedersen has even joined as a supporting tour musician.  Though it may be full-circle I get the feeling that there's no final curtain in the very near future.  The man is still totally engaged and loving what he does and it comes through wonderfully.  I recommend this film to anyone who has not yet seen it and buy Mudcrutch 2 because great music is a treasure now more than 40+ years ago when all of this began.  Bogdanovich knocked it out of the park I've got to say.",1464912000,,2678,4.53125

3004756,4,B000XPNZTK,"Not exactly what I expected, thought there would be more music. Might have been better if finished a song then went on with bio.  Other than that, I enjoyed watching.  Some of the things I never knew, like the arson, hence the four stars.",1458172800,,238,4.386363636363637
3004757,5,B000XPNZTK,"I bought a free trial to a streaming service because I knew I had to see this documentary, but I thought if I bought the DVD, I would probably just watch it once and then it would sit and gather dust. No point in buying something if I'd only watch it once, right? But I have to tell you, after I watched all four hours of it--in more than one sitting of course--I have continued to go back and watch it again. I had it on my desktop and also on a tablet, and so it was never at the same point on one device as the other, and that was great, because it caused me to re-watch the segment I had seen earlier and I would notice something or remember something the second time that I hadn't noticed the first time around.

I think if I were not retired, I really would only have had time to watch it once, and even that would have taken a significant time commitment. However, now that I am at home, I keep picking it up and watching chunks of it here and there, and enjoying the music--and the passion Petty and the Heartbreakers put into that music--every time. I watch the Traveling Wilburys portion over and over. In short, for those that are really fans, this is quite a lot of bang for the buck. And frankly I would rather watch this documentary four times than watch this documentary and three other rock documentaries about other bands one time each.

I should note that I was an advance reviewer for the Petty biography that was published last October, and so I also wondered whether this would just be the same material. And although the main story is the same, covering the career of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, it's also different. His childhood and adolescence are done inside of about a minute in the documentary, and his first wife's name isn't even mentioned, whereas this received more attention in the bio. But when reading the bio, you don't hear the music unless you get out some CDs or stream the music as you read, whereas in this documentary, there is footage of Petty and the band playing all over the world, growing up, growing older; there are changes in the band, but the amazing thing is how few  changes there have been. Both the documentary and the bio reflect the remarkable continuity and loyalty that are as much Petty's hallmark as anything else. Petty prides himself on creating a family-like band, and never becoming a big star that goes out to find a hired gun here and there to insert into his music. And since happy musicians give better performances, this magic has filtered on down to those of us that love their music.

Strongly recommended to fans.",1458172800,,2591,4.436974789915967
3004758,5,B000XPNZTK,"The documentary on the Eagles history was my favorite until I saw this.  Perhaps the difference lies in the fact that it was directed by Peter Bogdanovich.  It is an account of the bands origins in Gainesville, Florida and it ends in 2006essentially three decades of music by one of the greatest rock bands in the history of the form.  Or should I say the mode?  This is the sort of thing that Tom would think about, for he is a consummate artist, drawing distinctions between performance art and recording art and thinking at length about the nature of songwriting and the creative process.

The secrets to a great rockumentary are two: play enough of the music to illustrate the story and create a mini-concert, but not so much that it overwhelms the narrative; second, tell the unvarnished truth.  Be brutally honest about the lives, the work and the band.  Bogdanovich has this all covered and he has the perfect vehicle in Tom Petty.  Toms early life was hellish, his father both physically and psychologically abusive.  He was also skeptical about the music in Toms life, fearing, perhaps, that Tom was gay.  Tom was treated cruelly but he was also blessed.  Into his life, at a very early age, came Benmont Tench and Mike Campbell.  That would be the Mike Campbell who sometimes works with such artists as Don Henley, the man who idolized the Beatles and then, with Tom, came to play with Ringo and George.

One of the most interesting themes in the four-hour narrative is the nature of production.  Jimmy Iovine, e.g., proceeds in a completely different fashion than Jeff Lynne and the differences in their approaches have an effect on the bands psyche as well as its sound.  Jeff, e.g., likes to take each instrument at a time and then overdub.  This makes some of the musicians feel as if they're being forced to wait in the hall and report when they're called, while the band was more used to doing everything together, in a sort of organic fashion, with each band member registering opinions and offering suggestions.  (Benmonts screaming at Tom and Mike in one session, telling them to play like members of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, is one of the storys high points.)  Toms view of production is less personal and more cerebral and aestheticwhat is best for the art?

Another great theme is the manner in which the music is made at a personal level.  On the one hand we have the titans, in performance, playing before tens of thousands; on the other we have Tom in little more than a garage, playing with Dylan, Harrison, Lynne and their collective god, Roy Orbison.  Stevie Nickss personal interactions with Tom and her desire to leave Fleetwood Mac and join The Heartbreakers is another fascinating subtext in the story.  There is not a great deal of material on Toms personal life, but the story of the burning of his house in Encino is given considerable attention.

The bottom line is that this is an at-length exploration of the life and art of one of Americas greatest poet/musicians.  Both heartwrenching and exhilarating, it gives the audience a chance to feel the experience and craft which anchor the music.  It also reminds us that Tom Pettymarried by Little Richard, taught by Don Felder, partnering with Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash, teaming with Ringo Starr, forming a band with the likes of Roy Orbison, George Harrison and Jeff Lynneis nothing less than a pillar of both American and international rock music.  From Mudcrutch to The Heartbreakers, this is the story of one of the greatest rock bands in history.  Put Dylan in his own category of folk and the Beatles (as Pete Townshend thought) in the category of pop, perhaps with Elvis.  Setting aside the jazz/crossover slot for Steely Dan, how many bands are at the top of the rock pinnaclethe Crickets, Pink Floyd (perhaps they should have their own category), the Eagles, the Stones, the Jimi Hendrix experience, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers . . . .  We can debate the other great bandsthe Who, the Doors, et al.but this documentary reminds us why Toms band is up there with the greats.  And at the center of the story stands a sensitive, deeply wounded genius who combines his painful experience with unbudging artistic and personal integrity.  This is a powerful combination.",1457827200,7,4269,4.751696065128901

This documentary is a good rock story well told, by the real people and real video footage of the moments and all held together with Petty's music. All the songs demoed before the Heartbreakers first albums are also catchy... the guy writes great, straight ahead songs that sound so simple but are often more deep and sophisticated than they sound. That's the deceptive beauty of capturing the essence and the raw energy as well as Petty and his great band have done so consistently for so long (30 years... WOW!!! What a great rock band). The show is about 4 hours but you don't want it to end. You don't have to be a fan to like this show. It made me want to update my Petty CD collection!",1457740800,2,821,4.303225806451613

He was the rock equivalent of the monks who kept copying Aristotle for generations without really understanding Greek until they found the Rosetta Stone, if'n you can grok my meaning. Florida is now the 3rd largest state in this increasingly odd country I live in, and not only is he as close to a hero Florida has (except maybe that Depp fellow), so I along with many other Flordians unabashedly love the guy. I was going to the U of Florida as he was coming up playing local venues and I used to date a girl who went to Gainesvill High with him. She shall remain nameless. Jeralyn Ray. (From Micanopy!

Being in my fifties now, it's the coolest thing that they're still going strong. I enjoyed this documentary immensely. I love that he and his band mates have known each other since youth and have grown into their golden years together. It's hard to think of them as older. They're SOOO good. Recently saw them in concert. It was nothing short of amazing. I felt so much more in tune with them after seeing the film. Very cool that Peter Bogdanovich's talents were a part of the film. I would recommend it to anyone that loves the music they have blessed us with all of these years, and gifts us with new material too. Hypnotic Eye was released recently. It's so good. They're legendary. How many bands can say that?",1412899200,3,853,4.4743589743589745

This is a very good documentary covering his life, musical influences, the business, and through it all you see what Petty is really like. I can just say he is not the norm in a very good way. And, I heard some songs including ""southern accent"" that I really liked that I have not heard before.
Worth watching even if you don't like his music.",1409875200,4,491,4.020408163265306

Granted I'm a long time Petty fan, but this video is a must see if you like rock and roll - Period. The history of the band is amazing and you begin to understand just how talented and devoted all the band members are/were. Their professionalism as musicians is amazing. At the end credits the list of songs written by Tom is stunning and the dedication of all the band members is why we know the words to every one of them. Tom and the Heartbreakers are all 1st class human beings and kick ass musicians. Watch the video, you'll be glad you did.",1407542400,,683,4.181818181818182

It will show you what hard work and dedication can do for a musicians career...and that not all of them were overnight sensations. This is the most complete documentary I've seen about a band and their music. It shows actual video footage of their earliest days all the way up to their 30th anniverasary tour in 2005. If you've only heard a few of their hits, or are not a big fan, you will still enjoy this. And you'll probably come away with a better appreciation of Tom Petty's song writting, and the entire band as musicians.",1406246400,2,577,4.504761904761905

This is a terrific DVD, CD... Petty is a funny and talented man who knows what he's doing...
Businesswise, sharp as a tack... I had no idea.... I highly advise you to pick this generous
collection... If you're a fan, you'll love it! If you're a so-so fan like me, you will soon appreciate
Petty for the personable and talented man that he is.... Not to mention his extremely talented band!

3004846,3,B000XPNZTK,"Runnin' Down A Dream is not a concert video - my mistake. While it contains plenty of Tom Petty music, the movie is mainly a documentary about Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. The first part is interesting with original video of the band in their early days. I learned quite a bit about their origins and struggles.

About mid-way through you can tell  Peter Bogdanovich, the director, is fudging the facts. The Bob Dylan tour years get a cursory view, and some in-depth on Travelling Wilburys is provided. After that we are given press release statements about ""Howie"" and his ""problem."" Why not just say what happened?

After the mid-90s part of Tom Petty's career, the movie went down hill with talking heads about how real, authentic, emotional, and real Tom is. Gush gush gush.

When the movie was over I felt unfulfilled and put ""Playback"" in the Blu-ray player to remind myself how great the band could be. ""Playback"" has all the original videos that were on MTV. That DVD has mojo.",1394841600,3,989,4.699421965317919

Our family loved the documentary so much that the DVD's gave out! I bought this as a replacement and my family couldn't be happier. My parents saw Tom Petty perform in the '70s when my dad was attending the University of Florida. They had no idea back then that Tom Petty would become one of the greatest names ever in rock and roll. Their love for the Heartbreakers transfered to my sister and me. My sister was living and working in Gainesville at the time of the concert in this package and was sad to miss it.

3004859,5,B000XPNZTK,"While Bogdanovich might produced a tighter, more arresting film with a more scrupulous editor -- his 3+ hour work rambles now and then -- he has given us reason to honor this uncommonly fine composer and performer and his gifted colleagues. The concert DVD is very fine indeed, and the highlights CD captures some of its most gripping moments.

If you've known TP all your life or have just made his acquaintance, don't delay. This terrific, affordable collection of sounds and images has an essential place in every music-lover's library.

Petty and the Heartbreakers -- like Springsteen and the E Street Band -- have written love songs, anthems and ballads which touch common people, and most of us, to the core.

3004866,5,B000XPNZTK,"There's a raw edge to Tom Petty live that's missing in the studio recordings. His lead guitarist is stellar. The parade of vintage guitars, especially the Rickenbackers, is a show in itself.  Stevie Nicks, who I personally think is grossly over-rated in terms of her solo vocal ability, is superb in this concert.  The only minor disappointment for me is the rather uneven mix of the song selections that resulted in flat periods with back-to-back sleepy ballads.",1375401600,,463,5.0

3004882,5,B000XPNZTK,"Not really a music video fan.  Would much prefer music CD releases of memorable live performances.  This view required some modification after a recent online search was conducted for concert video's of a Heartbreaker concert I attended at the Gorge Amphitheatre in WA on 6/12/10, the single best live performance I've ever witnessed.  Several medium quality videos of this concert were found, but I kept seeing high quality videos of another show which commentators described as a 30th anniversary concert the Heartbreakers gave at the University of Florida on 9/21/06.  Further online research uncovered that the video of this 30th anniversary concert was included in this ""Runnin' Down a Dream"" release.

Any serious Heartbreaker fan will enjoy this four disc set.  The first two DVD's are a documentary on the entire career of this amazing band, and reveals new and interesting info that fans will enjoy, including Stevie Nicks wanting badly to join the Heartbreakers, but Petty refused, only willing to grant her honorary Heartbreaker status.  But the main reason to purchase this release is DVD three, which documents the entire 30th anniversary concert the Heartbreakers gave at the University of Florida on 9/21/06.  The duets Petty sings with Nicks are a special treat. In particular, the Petty song ""Insider"" that they sing together might be the finest duet I've ever heard, especially when listened to with high quality headphones.  Maybe Petty should reconsider and let her join the Heartbreakers.  Their voices definitely have a synergistic magic and sound better together than either does alone.  Disc four is an unremarkable music CD.  Much better would be if they had released a music CD version of the 30th anniversary concert.  Overall, highest recommendation for all Heartbreaker fans!",1361232000,3,1804,5.265734265734266

3004893,5,B000XPNZTK,"Even if you're not a huge fan of Tom Petty, this is an incredible documentary. For one main reason, it actually tells the story of a songwriter and band in such a thorough way, from his humble roots in Gainsville Florida, to his first time hearing early rock records (Elvis, Beatles, Stones, Byrds), his first band Mudcrutch, their trials and tribulations to breaking out of the local scene securing a record deal to the eventual formation of the Heartbreakers. It takes you all through his breakout success with his classic 1979 record Damn The Torpedos and his very successful run through the 80's and early 90's, all the way up to 2006. What makes it so good is through the use of tons of home video footage, pictures, some live footage snippets from TV shows etc, as well as very detailed narrative from Tom himself, as well as the Heartbreakers (Mike Campbell, Ron Blair, Benmont Tench, Stan Lynch) as well as later members of the group, early bandmembers of Mudcrutch, associates and friends like Stevie Nicks, Jeff Lynn, Dave Stewart, Eddie Veder, Dave Grohl, Jimmy Iovinne, Johnny Depp on the entire history of his career. It's the kinda thing you wish there was way more of for many other bands, this is really what a documentary of a bands history is supposed to be like. Swamped in an era of VH1 Behind The Music type shows where you get vague details spread throughout a 45 minute show with 15 min of commercials it always leaves the hardcore music fan wanting more. Not with this though.

Even though it's about 4 hours, it never feels boring. Tom Petty's story is actually almost magical in how perfect it all came together for him, from his early garage rock days, meeting musicians that would fit into his vision, working his way up through the industry, it really is a truly inspiring story. It also touches on Petty's craft of songwriting and his love for the studio and recording albums and the production of it. There's always another interesting or funny story around the corner, especially the early years of the band in the mid 70's detailing some of the tales of the bands more wilder youthful days.  So if you're a rock fan at all, you'll want to check this out, there should be more of this kind of thing out there",1353283200,,2240,4.611528822055138

3004905,5,B000XPNZTK,"If you love the music of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, you're gonna love this DVD/CD set.

It includes an outstanding, detailed documentary of the formation and evolution of the band and its members, documenting the ups and the downs, the struggles with the record companies, drugs, and personal tragedies. But most importantly it shows how they were able to overcome, persevere and remain a relevant part of rock and roll music.

It includes interviews with the band members and their friends like George Harrison, Stevie Nicks, Eddie Veder, and many others.

After watching the documentary *which spans two complete DVDs*, treat yourself to their homecoming concert in Gainesville, Florida in 2008. The cinematography and audio production for this concert is outstanding and includes tons of your favorite songs with guest appearances from Stevie Nicks and Eddie Vedder.

My wife is not a huge music/concert video fan but she absolutely loved this set saying ""I never realized how many songs of TP & H have been favorites of mine over the years!""

A friend of mine recorded the Bogdanovich documentary, and I was blown away. I suddenly realized how much his music was in the background of my life. When one considers the man's music catalog, it becomes clear what an iconoclast Tom Petty was and is. This film, while 4 hours, flies by in a blink. Well edited. I have watched it no less than a half dozen times and I never tire of it. It's for that reason I plunked down the cash for the limited edition CD & DVD.

3004911,5,B000XPNZTK,"I remember liking the music that Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers made when they first came along.  My rock and roll listening years coincide pretty much with their history.  And I'm from central Florida too, so it made it a little more special I guess that they were a good band.  I remember the buzz that ""damn the torpedoes"" created when it came out.  So many great songs on one album didn't seem possible.  But to be fair, I didn't try to be an expert on them.  I'm not an expert on much of anything.  But if you were young during the 60's and 70's, and you liked listening to fm radio, then you can better judge my qualifications.  But I do remember an early thought, that Tom Petty sounded like one of Bob Dylan's incarnations.

The biographical movie (the product being reviewed) is good.  It's made in modern times, so you get some good quality sound and video for your home system.  I enjoy this modern way to enjoy rock and roll, and own several other dvd format covers of rock legends.  This one on Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers is a good mix of talk and music.  It's pretty much all positive perspective, so I'd guess it was conceived and financed by themselves (Tom Petty).  That doesn't bother me, because it delivers good entertainment value, and I already liked the music.  I wasn't looking for someone to knock them down anyway.

I'm sort of old now, but I was paying attention when the Beatles were still new and Ed Sullivan was important, ""The times, they are a changin"" was being covered in all the grade school talent shows, and everyone knew who Roy Orbison was.  So when the Traveling Wilburys popped up, and the album was great....that was a great joy for me.  Tom Petty seems to understand how special that opportunity was for him, which I'm happy to know.

The ""other"" disc is a concert in Gainesville, Florida.  It features the modern band line up (which is fine).  As a historical document, it's unfortunate that Petty doesn't look well and seems medicated (to me).  Everyone will have their favorite songs, so I won't try to add something meaningful here.  But I will say, I enjoyed watching another concert video from much earlier in their career that was killer.  Search for Santa Monica New Years concert 1978.  The band is really good live.

I got one of those email reminders to go to amazon and review this purchase.  So I'm here, but I can't really offer anything more profound that what others have said.  Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers have released some great songs and albums.  There are unrecognized gems that never get heard.  One of my favorites is their cover of Dylan's ""License to Kill"" for his 30 year all star concert.  You can watch it on a youtube search.  It really grabs me in a way I can't explain....",1318118400,3,2756,4.52738336713996

3004914,5,B000XPNZTK,"I have been a fan of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers since they hit with Refugee in the 1979. This band is about as solid as they come. This DVD is an excellent look at the history of the band and its members offering insights to how this band got came together and why the line up changed over the years the way that it did.

Personally, I think this band is sometimes underrated because they are a constant  on the music scene without the flashy packaging. The songwriting of this group is what I think has made them indelible, and their musicianship only solidifies them as a great band.

Tom Petty has been described as astute in dealings with the record industry, and there are plenty examples of this in Runnin' Down A Dream, especially dealing with some pathetic songwriters who had been assigned to write Roger McQuinn some material for his album from the early 1990's. Just how Mr. Petty rips into these guys is worth the price of the DVD alone!

Just a warning, once you start watching this, it's very difficult to stop. Yes, it is that good.",1301011200,3,1052,4.463541666666667

3004917,5,B000XPNZTK,"Runnin' Down A Dream is the superb 30th anniversary documentary from acclaimed director Peter Bogdanovich. It provides a four hour documentary across two DVDs, where you get the full story of the band and some brilliant interviews with Petty and other of the Heartbreakers. Petty comes across as an extremely likeable guy, with a great deal of integrity and it is great to see someone I admire so much talking so candidly about his career. The third DVD is the 30th anniversary concert from Gainsville, Florida, Tom's hometown, and shows just how wonderful he is live and how he can still whip up a crowd and hold them spellbound. Finally the forth disc is a soundtrack CD and has a good selection of his songs from over the years. This is a great package, with an excellent booklet and additional picture cards, that tells the story of who is now a rock and roll institution. A great place to get the full story from the people who truly know how it happened. Insightful, fun and damn good rock music, what more could you ask for? If you like this, check out 'Conversations with Tom Petty by Tom Petty and Paul Zollo', an excellent book of an insightful interview that covers much of the same ground in this documentary.

Nick Schager of Slant Magazine reviewed the documentary saying, ""Employs a warm and leisurely, though never sluggish, pace that's upfront about Bogdanovich's intention to take his sweet time tackling every topic of relevant interest.""

Ronnie Schreib of Variety, reviewed the documentary saying ""A feast for Petty fans and a joyous confirmation of the vitality of the collective creative process.""

Dan Lybarger, of eFilmCritic.com reviewed the documentary saying, ""Peter Bogdanovich's new documentary about the life and career of Florida-born rocker Tom Petty runs nearly four hours and never fails to engage or entertain.""

I would add my personal notes that this movie is very engaging and the 4 hour run length felt like an hour.  The movie really holds your interest and time flew by.

The Blu-ray edition looks fantastic but is not a major upgrade over the regular DVD...EXCEPT for the sound quality which I thought was much better on the Blu-ray.  Not that the DVD sound is bad.

It's Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers.  It rocks and tells a great story about a legendary band.

Seeing the interaction between them all was really cool.
I could go on and on but the bottom line is if you are a fan of TPHB or a fan of rock and roll you have to get this video. I recommend the 4 disc set as it has the 30th anniversary concert from Gainsville Florida which is just as incredible. We purchased both!",1277424000,3,734,4.25

After watching this DVD, I now know I have to witness Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers live before it is too late. What a tremendous documentary by Bogdonavich. Petty and the group are seen as youngsters in Gainsville, Fl., as their first group Mud Clutch, in song writing sessions, with other greats, i.e. Stevie Nicks, Johnny Cash, George Harrison, Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison, and the list goes on. If you never realized Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers are the greatest rock band in American History, and Tom Petty one of the greatest songwriters ever, move over Lennon and McCartney, you will probably come out feeling that way after seeing this DVD.

3004940,4,B000XPNZTK,"Peter Bogdanovich has made a  documentary that totally holds your interest even over a staggering four hour running time.

I didn't know much about Tom Petty growing up, but I've had a bellyful now.  And yes, all the hits sounds strangely familiar, from American Girl to Free Falling, just like we saw on the halftime show at the Super Bowl a year ago.  More recent material hasn't really saturated the airwaves, and some of it like The Last DJ, is almost incredibly insipid.

We get to know and like Tom Petty, though he has a streak of, I don't know what, egotism, that's totally understandable.  After all, he is the most successful rocker ever, or so the movie argues, with sales in the millions and three ""game-changing"" releases.  Still, he doesn't seem like he'd be an easy person to work for and all the Heartbreakers express shock and disappointment over having been treated shabbily, or ignored, at various times.  But I applaud him for showing his faults, he could have authorized a kiss-kiss type lovefest.

One wonders what happened in that divorce that prevented the filmmakers from even mentioning the name of his first wife.  Must have been nasty!  The question of the absent first wife haunts this picture much as it does Hitchcock's Rebecca.",1244764800,6,1259,4.809302325581395

There is a lot of old footage involved which can be interesting and I learned that Tom Petty led a miraculously lucky life. This film seems to try to gloss over his entire life, which I am sure as with almost everyone there is too much to talk about in four hours. I wish that they had concentrated more on the really interesting moments and left out half of what did make it into the film. There are a lot of breaks they just show concert footage for some of his songs.

If you really like Tom Petty, this is made for you. If you are indifferent or dislike him, this won't change anything for you.",1243468800,5,722,3.9793103448275864

Every single performance; from the first one in '06 to the great looking and sounding performances from Top of the Pops, Old Grey Whistle Test, Rockpalast, etc. IS CUT TO RIBBONS by whoever produced this. So you get maybe 30 seconds of music, then cut to an interview, then another 30 seconds, then another interview.

Whoever put this documentary together doesn't think you want to watch an entire live Petty and the Heartbreakers song from start to finish, no matter how rare the material or great the song.

Yeah, I admit there are three whole, uncut live songs on the second dvd. A whole dvd for three concert songs (not 3 concerts, three songs from concerts). Wow.

Anyway, if you're just interested in talking heads and a bit of rock history, it's fine. If you want to see classic performances by a great band, look elsewhere.",1243123200,20,976,4.597701149425287

3004944,5,B000XPNZTK,"I will tell you straight-out before I saw this Documentary I was and more so after the Documentary still am a huge Tom Petty And The Heartbreakers Fan. I've always loved their music,but when I saw this Documentary from beginning to end not only did I discovered why I loved those guys so much,it made me love Rock And Roll and it reinforced the the fact that as long as they still make Albums there will always be be true Rock and Roll in our life time. This is a true American story that is solely based it's roots of the tale that stretches from when a young boy first seen The Beatles and aspired to start a band,to succeeding in a Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame Band for thirty plus years with millions of loyal and loving fans. If you're a Fan like me you'll be singing along word by word and smiling all the way through,or if you just love old school Rock And Roll and enjoy discovering how if you have a love for music and making people happy. It works on so many levels for many people and I'll even bet if you're some sort of Death Metal Fan that secretly likes Tom Petty you'll be telling all your metal friends to watch it. But what I like the most about this Documentary is from a Fan stand point most of the information about Tom I previously knew before,but I really didn't know about the Heartbreakers themselves or knew very little about them. I couldn't believe all the information I DIDN'T know about Mike Campbell,Steve Lynch etc. Plus all the rare footage and actual home-type films that were preserved and shown is absolutely amazing to me that for one are still around and two they thought to preserve their memories of the early days of Mudcrutch and beyond.

You certainly get a lot for your money people believe me on this. You get two discs,the first one is the three plus hour Documentary ""Running Down A Dream"",the second disc is a wonderful extra content-behind the scenes discs filled with rare interviews with Tom and Band,never before seen concert footage and recent interviews with just about everyone that's ever been Mudcrutch and the Heartbreakers. I usually tell you guys some stuff about the what's in the Documentary,but this time I really want you to be surprised and amazed with the content provided. I don't want to give anything away for people unfamiliar with them. Buy it for yourself and enjoy OH and thank me for not telling you right off and for seasoned Fans be prepared to be shock due to the fact that you didn't know absolutely everything about Tom and the Band.

To say this is my favorite DVD in my collection and the very best thing I bought from Amazon is not a stretch whatsoever. I stand by what I said and if you got nothing of what I said so far please take away this fact:This is the best buy on Amazon Period. Bottom line and if you are a Tom Petty Fan and saying to yourself ""Ah,I'm not sure."",trust me please buy it and prove yourself wrong,because simply put not only is this one of the best Documentaries I've ever seen it is one of those DVDs you'll never let your friends or anyone barrow because it's in that special echelon in your collection that you can not personally afford to let somebody barrow and either lose,keep or damaged. THAT'S how great it truly is. Out of all the stuff I've reviewed on Amazon this by far is my favorite and to say I highly recommend you buy this is an understatement. When I went to buy it originally on here it sold out almost immidiately and I was of course crushed,so in a month or two checked again and they had it back in stock I  snatched it up right then and there. So,what that says is that this should be a must buy for anyone who has a love for music regardless of Genre and/or love Tom Petty And the Heartbreakers but this right now. You absolutely will not regret it and I guarentee you you'll thank me for telling you to do so. You're welcome!(Just Kidding :)",1239062400,,3871,4.381084840055633

The story of Tom Petty is basically THE story of American rock music over the last four decades.  He has played with musical gods such as Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Roy Orbison, and Johnny Cash, and while he would be too modest to admit it, for my money he held his own with each of them.  And let's not forget his incredible band, The Heartbreakers, who have never seemed to have gotten all of the credit that they have deserved.

If you have even an passing interest in the man's music, check out this film and you'll come away impressed.

I would also recommend the companion book, as well as the book of interviews, ""Conversations With Tom Petty.""",1236902400,,833,4.411764705882353

This is Tom Petty at his best, a storyteller, and he goes into lengthy explanations of how some of his works came about and the preparations he and members of the Heartbreakers did in order for these to come to their place in his accomplishments. I anticipated with the interest generated by progressing through the disks and was rewarded by this work as much as when I had seen some of rhe documentaries of classical composers. I don't find any part of this story to be overly long or boring. How the band started and how the members made their way to Tom Petty is told and each share their viewpoints and I find it entirely intriguing.

In retrospect, he is the ""Dylan"" of his time. Talented and Principled, No Compromises. We don't have many like him around any more. The respect given him by artists most of us respect is proof positive.

This outstanding film by Bogdanovich takes on all issues with no BS, just like Petty. This is a great story, but it is really a film (as opposed to a music video). My only wish is that we could see full versions of some of the very awesome music (some of which I new and forgot, but others I had never heard).

There is so much to cover, in fact, that this documentary stretches for 4 hours, and that's before you've even touched special features.  The format is somewhat of a common one for musical documentaries.  There is a montage of interview footage that is sliced and diced to tell the story somewhat chronologically from a variety of perspectives.  Even after 4 hours of interview footage, music video clips, concert footage and photo stills, this documentary is a pleasure from start to finish.  That is probably the best testament to how well made and fun to watch this really is.

The format of this documentary should please die-hard fans and casual listeners alike.  I would consider myself a pretty big Tom Petty fan, but I watched this with somebody who was not.  Well after seeing the documentary, they are a fan now.  The last half, in particular, is so chock full of amazing music that most people *know* but not everybody realizes is Tom Petty.  So this is a good movie to watch with somebody you want to convert over to being a Tom Petty fan.

The blend of formats is really good as a *bio-pick* but it's also nice for music history junkies.  Sprinkled into all the interviews are tons of factoids and tidbits about how certain songs came to be, who wrote them, who worked on them, and on and on.  Serious fans will really enjoy all those details.

But everybody can relate to some of the stories of hardship and challenges that are also sprinkled throughout.  We get to hear about Tom's first battle to get out of his record contract when Shelter Records was bought by MCA Universal.  And we get to see the various versions of Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers take shape for various reasons, from Stan slowly falling on his sword to Howie's drug problems.  In fact, it's very surprising just how multi-faceted the telling of these stories is.  Rather than give us the sanitized corporate version of how so-and-so was kicked out of the group, this documentary allows clips of all parties to be included so that you can hear it from the horse's mouth and make up your own mind.  I really appreciate that fact since I love to know as much of the story as possible and I am instinctively distrustful of one-sided portrayals.

As with any music documentary, the music is a large part of this film.  And the depth and bredth of Tom's career is shown, not just in his songs, but in his collaborations with Stevie Nicks, Roger Maguin, George Harrison, Jeff Lynn, and many others.  And of course if you include the supergroup The Travelling Wilburys, you have to add to George Harrison and Jeff Lynn the venerable names of Roy Orbison and Bob Dylan.  This is really an amazing bit of music with some of the best popular artists of the last 50 years represented here.

I highly recommend this documentary.  There is also a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/4-Disc-Set/dp/B000XPNZTK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">4-Disc Set</a>&nbsp;which includes some rare audio tracks and more special features.

3004967,5,B000XPNZTK,"I'd been waiting for this 2 set DVD to come out for months and it finally showed up. It's 4 hours of rock and roll history that focuses on one of the best, tightest, most talented and unpretentious bands ever. Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Just saying it makes a fan smile but this documentary goes deep into the back story of the band and has extended interviews with all of the band members and many people associated with the Heartbreakers through the years.

It covers the whole period from the first days in Gainesville, FL through the latest album, ""Highway Companion"". There's plenty of excellent music but Mr. Petty is fully engaged from beginning to end and he is completely up front in relating the many highs and inevitable lows of the group he started 30 years ago with a dream of making a life as a full on rocker. He did it. And the Heartbreakers did it. Full on.

His songs are the soundtrack to a generation. If you want to know where those songs came from and how they came into being, watch ""Runnin' Down a Dream"". It's all here and my compliments to Mr. Bogdanovich as he made a great, complete documentary that flows smoothly.

3004970,5,B000XPNZTK,"Ok. This will probably be the strangest rave Tom Petty review you ever read.

I don't like Tom Petty's music. I have never owned a Tom Petty album, and am highly unlikely to ever own one. Yet I think this was one of the best rock documentaries ever made,and I was fascinated throughout.

You see, this is not a concert, but the story of a band. Just because you're not a fan of an artists music doesn't mean they don't have a great story to tell, and this one does. It was directed by 70's wunderkind Peter Bogdonovich, and he does a beautiful job at giving Tom's 35 year career the epic scope that he, and the audience deserved. For once, a film is able to go into the depth of detail that you wanted to know. Why did the drummer get fired? They actually tell you. There's nothing more frustrating than a film that doesn't tell you what you want to know, but this one does.

The band itself, is not terribly charismatic, and there isn't much in the ""Motley Crue"" vein of wild stories of excess or soap opera-style conflict and controversy, they are just some quiet guys who like to play easy-listening roots-rock without any gimmicks or sensationalism. But it's rarely boring, especially for musicians, since there's lots of detail given on the making and recording of the albums.

I may not be a Tom Petty fan, and did find myself fast-forwarding through some of the extended music performances, but look at it this way, if I was interested and entertained throughout, than a Petty fan is sure to be in heaven. Now if only someone would make a film this good about a band I like... Highly Highly recommended.",1213401600,,1610,4.484641638225256

Best thing on the documentary part is Petty in the studio with Roger McGuinn, going off on a couple of record company hot-shots who show up to  try to get Roger to record a bad song.  Petty is as smart and business-savvy as he is talented.  The Heartbreakers are probably the best sounding band in the world right now, and Petty's songwriting is right up there with Springsteen, Mellencamp, Simon, etc.  I'd have paid triple the price for this set.  The Gainsville concert is fabulous.  There's obviously been some post-show in-studio touch ups, namely overdubbed backround vocals on a few tunes, but what group doesn't do this?  The overall sonic quality is first rate.  The hell with paying $100 to sit a quarter of a mile away from the stage next to some bozos talking on their cell phones.

If you don't recognize that last name then you may not realize the impact of the connection with the Eagles.  There's many others that may not lend credence to the importance of Tom's mentioning these names such as Denny Cordell, Del Shannon, Jimmy Iovine, Shelly Yackus (Raspberries engineer) and Leon Russell to name a few more.  Additionally, the documentary jumps around a bit and leaves out details as stated by Tom in his book ""Conversations with Tom Petty"".  Examples of this are how Tom talks on when they first landed in LA and hit various record companies.  Ironically Shelter records is not mentioned and low and behold Denny Cordell is introduced out of nowhere whereas the book discusses this link in far more detail.  I believe there is also one inaccuracy as where Tom demands the record company not use Hard Promises as the first LP to go 9.98 list.  I recall list price for LP's being far less than 9.98 in 1981.  I believe it was more like 7.98 as I stil lhave my original LP with a 4.99 sticker bought new.  The live concert is pretty good (5.1 sound is decent - not great) and the 4th item (CD) has a very tinny sound so don't expect too much there as the tracks are taken from TV appearances for the most part.  Sadly, the one audio track from a TV show in the documentary is not included in this 4th audio cd (track is on DVD #1 but title is unknown).  Highlight on disc one is American Girl from a 1981 TV performance..this was amazing.

All in all, this box set is well worth the price of admission.  You're Gonna Get It.

After watching him play in the Super Bowl, I went and bought this DVD set for the 30th anniversary concert DVD.  I was not too keen on watching a 4 hour long documentary, but thought since I own the DVD's, I should watch it at least once.

OMG, was I wrong... 4 hours just flew by.  What an amazing documentary.  No narration what so ever, this is the true story of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers as told by the band members themselves, through old cam corder and tv footage.  Celebrities such as Dave Grohl, Eddie Vedder and Johnny Depp (all fans of Petty) make appearances.

It was very sad to see that the world is just about making fast selling music and not long lasting music.  That's what makes Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers one of the last acts of it's kind!

To sum it up, I am not a die hard Petty fan, but this documentary is probably the one of the best out there.  I certainly appreciate and respect TP a lot more now.",1202256000,,1009,4.176165803108808

If you're even the least bit into Petty's work, give it a go, you won't be disappointed.  In fact you'll probably want more, and to that I'd say if you have the chance, see the heartbreakers live.

The documentary and live footage is simply awesome.  Sound is solid (dolby digital 5.1).  Buy this now!",1200787200,,394,4.1866666666666665
3004978,5,B000XPNZTK,"I just bought this DVD last night at my local store. I have been a moderate Tom Petty fan all my life. I have always enjoyed his music but never really understood the history of the group.
This is an in depth insight of Tom Petty from his early years in the music business all the way upto today.
There are two CD's devoted to him telling the story of the band.
There is also a concert DVD of the Band in Tom's hometowm, Gainsville Florida. The concert is very good and features special guest Stevie Nicks an honorary member of the Heartbreakers. My only complaint with the concert is that a few of my favorites are left off and its a little short.
I would recommend this not only to fans of the group but those who want to know the history of Rock and Roll.......Tom Petty is now in the Hall of Fame and this will let you know why............OUTSTANDING",1200096000,,854,4.277777777777778
3004979,4,B000XPNZTK,"The story of Jesus Christ himself could easily be told in 2 hours.  Tom Petty doesn't deserve four.  This is clearly a self-financed puff piece.

That said, it is a very well done puff piece.

What holds it together is the incredible archival material they dug up, mastered into HD widescreen.  A bit of George Harrison interview prior to his death.  Details seemingly lost to time are explained by Harrison, from the grave.

Excellent, rare concert footage and audio from the 70s and 80s.  More studio footage from 1982, 1985, 1994.  Wilburys rehearsing at Dylan's house in 1989.  The video surprises keep on coming.  They have a wealth of material to tell this story on the screen.

The story though is a little cheesy.  It's clearly not edited by a neutral observer.  It has a positive sheen to everything.  What becomes very weird, after all the buildup, is Tom's dictator / CEO role vs his band-mates and co-writers.

From a band dynamics perspective, Tom comes off surprisingly tough and heartless.  His band members are his employees, and never once credits them with helping to compose ""his"" music.  Not much of a plural story.  Some of the best insights are from record company executives.

It gets a little sappy and gratuitous.  Cameos from Stevie Nicks.  Johnny Depp, Eddie Vedder.  Stan Lynch, the drummer who left in 1993, is heavily featured in the movie, which is good because he provides some much needed counterpoint.  Lynch's uneven drumming was clearly a part of the classic Petty sound that became world famous.  Losing him and his personality was clearly something that signaled the end of the classic Heartbreakers era.",1199664000,5,1642,4.883636363636364

I've been a casual Tom Petty fan for many years and as a muscian myself have always respected him huge as a songwriter as well as the Heartbreakers.  However, I really started to have a new appreciation for him after reading his autobiography last year and began to listen to his whole catalog...I am just blown away by the depth and committment to great songwriting that is apparent in every darn song.  It is just really hard to find a Tom Petty song that is not superb.  So, you just don't start out or end up in the league these guys are in without a very compelling story behind it all and the movie just tells the story so well and what an entertaining story it is!",1198886400,2,834,4.253164556962025
3004981,5,B000XPNZTK,"I caught this on Sundance and was mesmerized for 4 hours! I always liked Tom and band.. the thing is he is so deceptively a talented songwriter that it was easy to take him for granted. Forgive me Tom for doing that! After learning so much about him as a man, and a kind, sweet man at that, for some reason that helped me appreciate his poetry and musical skills all the more.  The movie shows his seedling talent and how he persisted and learned and grew, and also kept a strong core of optimism and delight at how things in his life unfolded. Beautifully done camera and wonderful clips of young Tom and band. Absolutely worth every penny, and even if you think you are not a big TP fan, get it anyway if you like any rock music at all, you will be converted, as I was. I am now in the process of buying every thing this brilliant man has ever done.
And now we will be treated to TP and HB halftime at the Superbowl. I hate football but will be sure to watch this year!
Also, I ran out and bought this 4 CD set, I had to have the extra disc of tracks and the 30th Anniversary  concert!",1197936000,3,1087,4.074766355140187
3004982,5,B000XPNZTK,"I extremely enjoyed this and I am not what you would call a die-hard Tom Petty fan.  It just seems like growing up that Tom's music has always been there.  I discovered Tom around the ""Hard Promises"" album via MTV videos and now that I think about, he has consistently released great music for 30 years.  I have listened to the new album ""Highway Companion"" and I find it to be as good as anything I've heard from him.

What I did get from the movie is that Tom may be the most geniune rock & rollers ever.  He knows what he wants and never lets up.  Also the movie reinforced what I already believed:  Mike Campbell is the most underrated guitarists ever.  He may not be flashy but he can play just about anything.  The same is true of Benmont Tench, both are incredible musicians.  In fact, as you can see from lineup changes, without Mike & Ben the Heartbreakers sound is not complete.

Bottom line:  Tom is one of the greatest American songwriters ever and watching this will confirm this!",1197849600,36,993,4.395604395604396

(Remember kids Howie was going down hill by then.....so I was curious to how that record came about and the sessions etc).......even if it was quickly mentioned.  Also when it comes to Howie they miss a couple of key points that Tom has already made in the interview book released a few years back. Howie was FIRED....understandable so....but that is never stated.....and in the book Tom recounts how Howie is arrested in New Mexico with his girlfriend Carlene Carter, they fly him to a gig that night or next day and he literally shows up with NO SHOES. Now I don't want to put that in to make fun of Howie, who lost his battle with drugs and died....but it just shows what a bad state he was in and WHY the heartbreakers had to move on without him.

I found this four hour anthology of Tom Petty and his Heartbreakers on Sundance Channel.  I immediately notified my best friend, and we watched unbelievably spellbound.  This story of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers was directed by Peter Bogdanovich. He begins with the start of Tom Petty's life in Gainesville, Florida and ends with a 2006 commemoration concert of his thirtieth anniversary in music.

The entire story is told through home movies, television shows and rememberances in narrative form. Tom Petty does much of the narrative and this is his profession and  musical life, after all. The list of friends, colleagues and those in the know who knew or played with Tom Petty is remarkable. It is a time line of the history of rock and music. Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison, George Harrison, and Jeff Lynn along with Tom Petty join to form 'The Traveling Wilburys'.  This remarkable group, to a one, votes this time in their lives as one of the most rewarding musical experiences.  Stevie Nicks wants to join Tom Petty and his heartbreakers, but she is a woman and ""this is a men's club"" says Tom Petty.  The sheer sense of Tom's persuasive personality in pursing his career in music is pure genius. Once he set down this path he never looked back. This was his life and what a life it has been.

This movie is about the music. There is some mention of marriage and Tom Petty's daughter is interviewed. Little personal information is shared. What we do have is the music and it is glorious. From ""Breakdown"", ""American Girl"" ""Even the Losers"", ""I Won't Back Down"", ""Learning to Fly"", ""Into the Great Wide Open"", ""Refugee"", ""Straight Into Darkness, ""Don't Do Me Like That"", and on and on.  A homage to Tom Petty and his career.

""Tom Petty And The Heartbreakers: Runnin' Down A Dream remarkably chronicles a prolific career that's yielded dozens of instantly recognizable songs and countless good times for all who've cared to listen. It's an indispensable documentary on one of America's most successful rock and roll bands, whose leader never backed down in aspiring to his ambition."" Donald Gibson

This may be one of the best made rock documentaries. A must see for all of Tom Petty fans and for those who love great rock n' roll.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 11-17-07

3239152,5,B000XPNZTK,"This FOUR HOUR documentary is a must for all Tom Petty fans and honestly anyone weaned on late '70s early '80s Rock 'n' Roll. Spanning Petty's humble beginnings in Gainesville, Florida to the launch of his career in California to his battles with record labels and sleazy lawyers and his ultimate triumph, the documentary finally shows us Petty at the top of the rock heap alongside Jeff Lynn, Bob Dylan and George Harrison, the quintessential independent rocker/ musician/ songwriter. Shows Petty to be the ultimate self-sufficient iconoclast. Bogdanovich shares old reels of Petty's first band Mudcrutch and we see the evolution of a young idealistic kid with a chip on his shoulder transform (over a 30 year period) into a bona fide rock legend. Saw this on Sundance channel and bought the four disc box set which includes a soundtrack CD and the 30th anniversary concert in Gainesville. This documentary is overflowing with interviews, clips, personalities, history and a catalog of live performances. Worth every penny. Worth every second.",1194998400,48,1044,5.183431952662722
3239153,5,B000XPNZTK,"I'm a Petty fan, so I loved the documentary. Bogdanovich does a great job of telling the story of Petty's career, and does a pretty good job of getting all sides of the story. It has all of the in's and out's of a ""Behind the Music,"" with band drama, etc., but focuses mainly on the music. The band members are all thoughtful and insightful in their comments, and what becomes clear is that Petty and the Heartbreakers are consumate craftsmen. Although Petty is the undeniable leader, they work together as a band to create the songs. The Heartbreakers aren't a backup band. To me, this carefully balanced dynamic, which has now led to 30+ years of success, was the most interesting part of the documentary. But the BEST part, by far, was seeing and hearing the various live and demo versions of the songs. Again, Bogdanovich does a great job of giving us enough pure music to enjoy without boring us.

The documentary is long, at about 4 hours. It took me two sittings to get through it, but it never felt long. Again, I'm a Petty fan. If I weren't I'm not sure I'd have had the patience for all of it, but it really helped make the case in my mind that Petty is one of the great modern rockers still working today.",1194825600,9,1216,4.380530973451328

I could and probably will watch Running Down a Dream every month or so.  It was a lovely dance down my own memory lane, as well as Tom and the bands.

The history involving the band members and introduction of the Wilburys / Jeff Lynne were great but the introduction of each and every album were just too much.

Overall 3 stars for me.  It was a decent documentary and could been a lot better. A great example of music documentary is the History of The Eagles, and the Beatles Anthology.

I love the way we meet his previous producers/managers and find out why/how they left. Then there's the Wilbury story, and how Tom bonded with George Harrison (A+!)
Through it all, his dedication to the song and his sense of justice and fairness prevail. I have a bit of this as well; I'm willing to sacrifice if something isn't right... but he's on another level. (Check out him arguing with the A&R guys about a song for his friend, Roger McGuinn)
And he wears the best damn clothes - later in life! And plays the coolest guitars!
Mike Campbell is a true gentleman, Benmont is the ""mad dog"" (surprise!), Stan Lynch is the foundation with an ego to match Tom's, not enough room for both long-term, Ron Blair is a regular guy who had to leave, but came back and saved the day! Steve Ferrone comes off as a skilled, easygoing guy who was in the right place at the right time, with EXACTLY the right personality to stay in the band. Scott Thurston was a surprise, the damn guy can play ANYTHING with that goofy smile. He's fun to watch.

I only wish that I'd have seen this years ago.  It would have ignited a desire to see everyone of his shows.
The video shows the struggles, the comradery, and what drove this band to success.
It was well done, from different points in their career.  It was interesting to see the the various stages of each band member's life.
Tom died at the same time of the massacre in Las Vegas. My daughter and her husband were at that event. Thank God they were not hurt.  Those two events made for a very dark week in the world.

I became quite obsessed with this video about 8 months ago. Couldn't put it away..HAD TO view it nearly EVERY day, so obsessed was I. I fell In LOVE with the band all over again, and even purchased it (the documentary) from Amazon, so I could see it whenever I NEEDED to....time and time again, and yet again. Falling into love with Tom and the Heartbreakers all over again. That IS obsession, is it not?
Petty's story, THIS Heartbreaker's story, is STILL propping me up DAILY. I do NOT know them, PERSONALLY, but after viewing this doc....I FELT as tho' I did.
I believe there are still many, many folks who are hanging on to the NewsPages, every week, or every DAY...just WAITING. WAITING to hear from the Heartbreakers THEMSELVES, about what could POSSIBLY come next for THEM.  THEY'VE got to be spinning their wheels in the  rude, emotional dust of what happened to their bandleader...their Brother? their BAND? I know that I'M still crying. I can't even BEGIN to imagine THEIR pain.  Can ANYBODY??
I really HOPE and WISH, that someone is/was planning a new, "" 10 Year documentary"", about this...this....(honestly, verbal descriptions fail me), Amazing? Wonderful? Fabulous...Far-Out,  Bitchen, Wicked.....Outa-Sight...band?
I guess I'm just hung up on words, when what I REALLY want to remember is how I FELT, when listening to The Heartbreakers
PLAY the song(s) that Tom Petty WROTE and Co-wrote with his friends, his ""family"".
Having fractured MY hip at approximately the same time TOM did (and being only five years apart in age), it's easy for me to understand what pain he was going through. Watching him perform, onstage, I could SEE how he was favouring that hip.  VERY LITTLE cavorting was done, am I right?  I've heard he didn't complain much, (UNLIKE me!) And he stayed true to his audience, caring more about US, than he did HIMSELF,  ""Showing up"", not cancelling. And (he needed a rest) I've read that the ONLY TIME he EVER cancelled a show, is when he had such severe laryngitis, that he couldn't speak for almost a week.
And....AND, he made up for every single show he'd HAD to cancel.  His final interview was illuminating.
And in the end, the love he played, was equal to the love he gave. (Thank you, Beatles).  Love to ALL",1509235200,5,2504,4.764434180138569

Petty comes across as a terrific musician and mostly good guy. He was, however, in the music business and sometimes, in the quest of his vision,  led him to be not so kind to some of the colleagues who helped him to get where he was.
The music is great and Bogdonovitch gives us a good perspective on the genre and evolution of his Pettys style  of music making.

I watched this, glued to the TV, on Netflix. It was so good I decided I had to have it. I was thrilled that Amazon had it on Blu-Ray. I ordered it and it took weeks to get here (no idea why). When it did, I was really disappointed to see that it was basically a disc in a cardboard sleeve. I wanted to add it to my shelf of other movies and music videos, proudly displayed.

3239244,5,B000XPNZTK,"Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers have become my favorite touring rock band.  The time it took for me to arrive at this juncture was not unlike the long journey of the band itself.  They continued to grow on me.  In music it's many times that the love over time is the best indicator of just how great the music actually is.  I knew I liked the sound back in '78 when I heard Breakdown and by the Damn The Torpedoes album around '80 I was more sure.  Still it took more albums over an ever changing musical landscape to fully appreciate the absolute goodness of their recorded output.  I can't say exactly when they became my favorite band but I must have been in my forties.  I have only become more certain of the band in my mid-fifties.  This is a band that has never let me down and kept building my respect.

So, to correct a great omission I've just now watched Runnin' Down A Dream.  At 4-hours it certainly covers the journey from Tom's youth to the 30th anniversary of the band.  Bogdanovich proves to be a completist and how he got this long-form doc made is a small wonder when these things tend to merely hit the highlights.  It boils down to something very special being documented with great respect.  I recommend it wholly for fans and believe there is a large number of more casual viewers that will come away with a desire to devour this music that, perhaps, they've a small interest in.  It's a journey worth taking for the devoted and any person who appreciates honest American literate music that also rocks hard yet has great nuance.

I've just witnessed the latest in that journey which is the first proper reconvened Mudcrutch tour.  Seeing Mudcrutch in the hallowed Ryman Auditorium in Nashville has immediately placed seeing Mudcrutch at the top of my many years of attending live concerts.  If ever a person was born to do what they're doing it is Tom Petty and seeing Mudcrutch up close makes it totally clear.  He is immeasurably blessed, as are we, that Tom is playing as good as ever with Mike Campbell and Benmont Tench.  It could be called coming full-circle as original drummer Randall Marsh and second guitarist/vocalist Tom Leadon are there too.  The talented Californian Herb Pedersen has even joined as a supporting tour musician.  Though it may be full-circle I get the feeling that there's no final curtain in the very near future.  The man is still totally engaged and loving what he does and it comes through wonderfully.  I recommend this film to anyone who has not yet seen it and buy Mudcrutch 2 because great music is a treasure now more than 40+ years ago when all of this began.  Bogdanovich knocked it out of the park I've got to say.",1464912000,,2678,4.53125

3239254,5,B000XPNZTK,"I bought a free trial to a streaming service because I knew I had to see this documentary, but I thought if I bought the DVD, I would probably just watch it once and then it would sit and gather dust. No point in buying something if I'd only watch it once, right? But I have to tell you, after I watched all four hours of it--in more than one sitting of course--I have continued to go back and watch it again. I had it on my desktop and also on a tablet, and so it was never at the same point on one device as the other, and that was great, because it caused me to re-watch the segment I had seen earlier and I would notice something or remember something the second time that I hadn't noticed the first time around.

I think if I were not retired, I really would only have had time to watch it once, and even that would have taken a significant time commitment. However, now that I am at home, I keep picking it up and watching chunks of it here and there, and enjoying the music--and the passion Petty and the Heartbreakers put into that music--every time. I watch the Traveling Wilburys portion over and over. In short, for those that are really fans, this is quite a lot of bang for the buck. And frankly I would rather watch this documentary four times than watch this documentary and three other rock documentaries about other bands one time each.

I should note that I was an advance reviewer for the Petty biography that was published last October, and so I also wondered whether this would just be the same material. And although the main story is the same, covering the career of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, it's also different. His childhood and adolescence are done inside of about a minute in the documentary, and his first wife's name isn't even mentioned, whereas this received more attention in the bio. But when reading the bio, you don't hear the music unless you get out some CDs or stream the music as you read, whereas in this documentary, there is footage of Petty and the band playing all over the world, growing up, growing older; there are changes in the band, but the amazing thing is how few  changes there have been. Both the documentary and the bio reflect the remarkable continuity and loyalty that are as much Petty's hallmark as anything else. Petty prides himself on creating a family-like band, and never becoming a big star that goes out to find a hired gun here and there to insert into his music. And since happy musicians give better performances, this magic has filtered on down to those of us that love their music.

Strongly recommended to fans.",1458172800,,2591,4.436974789915967
3239255,5,B000XPNZTK,"The documentary on the Eagles history was my favorite until I saw this.  Perhaps the difference lies in the fact that it was directed by Peter Bogdanovich.  It is an account of the bands origins in Gainesville, Florida and it ends in 2006essentially three decades of music by one of the greatest rock bands in the history of the form.  Or should I say the mode?  This is the sort of thing that Tom would think about, for he is a consummate artist, drawing distinctions between performance art and recording art and thinking at length about the nature of songwriting and the creative process.

The secrets to a great rockumentary are two: play enough of the music to illustrate the story and create a mini-concert, but not so much that it overwhelms the narrative; second, tell the unvarnished truth.  Be brutally honest about the lives, the work and the band.  Bogdanovich has this all covered and he has the perfect vehicle in Tom Petty.  Toms early life was hellish, his father both physically and psychologically abusive.  He was also skeptical about the music in Toms life, fearing, perhaps, that Tom was gay.  Tom was treated cruelly but he was also blessed.  Into his life, at a very early age, came Benmont Tench and Mike Campbell.  That would be the Mike Campbell who sometimes works with such artists as Don Henley, the man who idolized the Beatles and then, with Tom, came to play with Ringo and George.

One of the most interesting themes in the four-hour narrative is the nature of production.  Jimmy Iovine, e.g., proceeds in a completely different fashion than Jeff Lynne and the differences in their approaches have an effect on the bands psyche as well as its sound.  Jeff, e.g., likes to take each instrument at a time and then overdub.  This makes some of the musicians feel as if they're being forced to wait in the hall and report when they're called, while the band was more used to doing everything together, in a sort of organic fashion, with each band member registering opinions and offering suggestions.  (Benmonts screaming at Tom and Mike in one session, telling them to play like members of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, is one of the storys high points.)  Toms view of production is less personal and more cerebral and aestheticwhat is best for the art?

Another great theme is the manner in which the music is made at a personal level.  On the one hand we have the titans, in performance, playing before tens of thousands; on the other we have Tom in little more than a garage, playing with Dylan, Harrison, Lynne and their collective god, Roy Orbison.  Stevie Nickss personal interactions with Tom and her desire to leave Fleetwood Mac and join The Heartbreakers is another fascinating subtext in the story.  There is not a great deal of material on Toms personal life, but the story of the burning of his house in Encino is given considerable attention.

The bottom line is that this is an at-length exploration of the life and art of one of Americas greatest poet/musicians.  Both heartwrenching and exhilarating, it gives the audience a chance to feel the experience and craft which anchor the music.  It also reminds us that Tom Pettymarried by Little Richard, taught by Don Felder, partnering with Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash, teaming with Ringo Starr, forming a band with the likes of Roy Orbison, George Harrison and Jeff Lynneis nothing less than a pillar of both American and international rock music.  From Mudcrutch to The Heartbreakers, this is the story of one of the greatest rock bands in history.  Put Dylan in his own category of folk and the Beatles (as Pete Townshend thought) in the category of pop, perhaps with Elvis.  Setting aside the jazz/crossover slot for Steely Dan, how many bands are at the top of the rock pinnaclethe Crickets, Pink Floyd (perhaps they should have their own category), the Eagles, the Stones, the Jimi Hendrix experience, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers . . . .  We can debate the other great bandsthe Who, the Doors, et al.but this documentary reminds us why Toms band is up there with the greats.  And at the center of the story stands a sensitive, deeply wounded genius who combines his painful experience with unbudging artistic and personal integrity.  This is a powerful combination.",1457827200,7,4269,4.751696065128901

3239257,5,B000XPNZTK,"Caught a bit of this on TV one night and couldn't stop watching. I wouldn't even call myself a big fan, although I own some CD's. This documentary is a good rock story well told, by the real people and real video footage of the moments and all held together with Petty's music. All the songs demoed before the Heartbreakers first albums are also catchy... the guy writes great, straight ahead songs that sound so simple but are often more deep and sophisticated than they sound. That's the deceptive beauty of capturing the essence and the raw energy as well as Petty and his great band have done so consistently for so long (30 years... WOW!!! What a great rock band). The show is about 4 hours but you don't want it to end. You don't have to be a fan to like this show. It made me want to update my Petty CD collection!",1457740800,2,821,4.303225806451613

3239260,5,B000XPNZTK,"Regardless of the fact that I am a life-long Floridian (not a lot of us can say that), this gentleman almost kept the idea of a rock n' roll band playing large venues with just their instruments and voices alive for it not to fade away forever. He was the rock equivalent of the monks who kept copying Aristotle for generations without really understanding Greek until they found the Rosetta Stone, if'n you can grok my meaning. Florida is now the 3rd largest state in this increasingly odd country I live in, and not only is he as close to a hero Florida has (except maybe that Depp fellow), so I along with many other Flordians unabashedly love the guy. I was going to the U of Florida as he was coming up playing local venues and I used to date a girl who went to Gainesvill High with him. She shall remain nameless. Jeralyn Ray. (From Micanopy! Pronounced MICK-ah-no-pee) She used to say Tom had a 400 word vocabulary. Years later I can only retort that he done lots with then 400 words.

I've owned the title for just over a week now and have watched it twice (so far).

Just a couple of nuggets: 1. The documentary is based loosely around TP & the HB's 30th anniversary concert held in Gainesville, FL in 2006. You can view the entire concert on Youtube. 2. Check out ""Keeping Me Alive"", a great tune and yet it's never been released by the group.

Being in my fifties now, it's the coolest thing that they're still going strong. I enjoyed this documentary immensely. I love that he and his band mates have known each other since youth and have grown into their golden years together. It's hard to think of them as older. They're SOOO good. Recently saw them in concert. It was nothing short of amazing. I felt so much more in tune with them after seeing the film. Very cool that Peter Bogdanovich's talents were a part of the film. I would recommend it to anyone that loves the music they have blessed us with all of these years, and gifts us with new material too. Hypnotic Eye was released recently. It's so good. They're legendary. How many bands can say that?",1412899200,3,853,4.4743589743589745

This is a very good documentary covering his life, musical influences, the business, and through it all you see what Petty is really like. I can just say he is not the norm in a very good way. And, I heard some songs including ""southern accent"" that I really liked that I have not heard before.

The history of the band is amazing and you begin to understand just how talented and devoted all the band members are/were. Their professionalism as musicians is amazing.

3239343,3,B000XPNZTK,"Runnin' Down A Dream is not a concert video - my mistake. While it contains plenty of Tom Petty music, the movie is mainly a documentary about Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. The first part is interesting with original video of the band in their early days. I learned quite a bit about their origins and struggles.

About mid-way through you can tell  Peter Bogdanovich, the director, is fudging the facts. The Bob Dylan tour years get a cursory view, and some in-depth on Travelling Wilburys is provided. After that we are given press release statements about ""Howie"" and his ""problem."" Why not just say what happened?

After the mid-90s part of Tom Petty's career, the movie went down hill with talking heads about how real, authentic, emotional, and real Tom is. Gush gush gush.

When the movie was over I felt unfulfilled and put ""Playback"" in the Blu-ray player to remind myself how great the band could be. ""Playback"" has all the original videos that were on MTV. That DVD has mojo.",1394841600,3,989,4.699421965317919

Our family loved the documentary so much that the DVD's gave out! I bought this as a replacement and my family couldn't be happier. My parents saw Tom Petty perform in the '70s when my dad was attending the University of Florida. They had no idea back then that Tom Petty would become one of the greatest names ever in rock and roll. Their love for the Heartbreakers transfered to my sister and me. My sister was living and working in Gainesville at the time of the concert in this package and was sad to miss it.

The concert DVD is very fine indeed, and the highlights CD captures some of its most gripping moments.

If you've known TP all your life or have just made his acquaintance, don't delay. This terrific, affordable collection of sounds and images has an essential place in every music-lover's library.

Petty and the Heartbreakers -- like Springsteen and the E Street Band -- have written love songs, anthems and ballads which touch common people, and most of us, to the core.

3239363,5,B000XPNZTK,"There's a raw edge to Tom Petty live that's missing in the studio recordings. His lead guitarist is stellar. The parade of vintage guitars, especially the Rickenbackers, is a show in itself.  Stevie Nicks, who I personally think is grossly over-rated in terms of her solo vocal ability, is superb in this concert.  The only minor disappointment for me is the rather uneven mix of the song selections that resulted in flat periods with back-to-back sleepy ballads.",1375401600,,463,5.0

3239379,5,B000XPNZTK,"Not really a music video fan.  Would much prefer music CD releases of memorable live performances.  This view required some modification after a recent online search was conducted for concert video's of a Heartbreaker concert I attended at the Gorge Amphitheatre in WA on 6/12/10, the single best live performance I've ever witnessed.  Several medium quality videos of this concert were found, but I kept seeing high quality videos of another show which commentators described as a 30th anniversary concert the Heartbreakers gave at the University of Florida on 9/21/06.  Further online research uncovered that the video of this 30th anniversary concert was included in this ""Runnin' Down a Dream"" release.

Any serious Heartbreaker fan will enjoy this four disc set.  The first two DVD's are a documentary on the entire career of this amazing band, and reveals new and interesting info that fans will enjoy, including Stevie Nicks wanting badly to join the Heartbreakers, but Petty refused, only willing to grant her honorary Heartbreaker status.  But the main reason to purchase this release is DVD three, which documents the entire 30th anniversary concert the Heartbreakers gave at the University of Florida on 9/21/06.  The duets Petty sings with Nicks are a special treat. In particular, the Petty song ""Insider"" that they sing together might be the finest duet I've ever heard, especially when listened to with high quality headphones.  Maybe Petty should reconsider and let her join the Heartbreakers.  Their voices definitely have a synergistic magic and sound better together than either does alone.  Disc four is an unremarkable music CD.  Much better would be if they had released a music CD version of the 30th anniversary concert.  Overall, highest recommendation for all Heartbreaker fans!",1361232000,3,1804,5.265734265734266

3239390,5,B000XPNZTK,"Even if you're not a huge fan of Tom Petty, this is an incredible documentary. For one main reason, it actually tells the story of a songwriter and band in such a thorough way, from his humble roots in Gainsville Florida, to his first time hearing early rock records (Elvis, Beatles, Stones, Byrds), his first band Mudcrutch, their trials and tribulations to breaking out of the local scene securing a record deal to the eventual formation of the Heartbreakers. It takes you all through his breakout success with his classic 1979 record Damn The Torpedos and his very successful run through the 80's and early 90's, all the way up to 2006. What makes it so good is through the use of tons of home video footage, pictures, some live footage snippets from TV shows etc, as well as very detailed narrative from Tom himself, as well as the Heartbreakers (Mike Campbell, Ron Blair, Benmont Tench, Stan Lynch) as well as later members of the group, early bandmembers of Mudcrutch, associates and friends like Stevie Nicks, Jeff Lynn, Dave Stewart, Eddie Veder, Dave Grohl, Jimmy Iovinne, Johnny Depp on the entire history of his career. It's the kinda thing you wish there was way more of for many other bands, this is really what a documentary of a bands history is supposed to be like. Swamped in an era of VH1 Behind The Music type shows where you get vague details spread throughout a 45 minute show with 15 min of commercials it always leaves the hardcore music fan wanting more. Not with this though.

Even though it's about 4 hours, it never feels boring. Tom Petty's story is actually almost magical in how perfect it all came together for him, from his early garage rock days, meeting musicians that would fit into his vision, working his way up through the industry, it really is a truly inspiring story. It also touches on Petty's craft of songwriting and his love for the studio and recording albums and the production of it. There's always another interesting or funny story around the corner, especially the early years of the band in the mid 70's detailing some of the tales of the bands more wilder youthful days.  So if you're a rock fan at all, you'll want to check this out, there should be more of this kind of thing out there",1353283200,,2240,4.611528822055138

3239402,5,B000XPNZTK,"If you love the music of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, you're gonna love this DVD/CD set.

It includes an outstanding, detailed documentary of the formation and evolution of the band and its members, documenting the ups and the downs, the struggles with the record companies, drugs, and personal tragedies. But most importantly it shows how they were able to overcome, persevere and remain a relevant part of rock and roll music.

It includes interviews with the band members and their friends like George Harrison, Stevie Nicks, Eddie Veder, and many others.

After watching the documentary *which spans two complete DVDs*, treat yourself to their homecoming concert in Gainesville, Florida in 2008. The cinematography and audio production for this concert is outstanding and includes tons of your favorite songs with guest appearances from Stevie Nicks and Eddie Vedder.

My wife is not a huge music/concert video fan but she absolutely loved this set saying ""I never realized how many songs of TP & H have been favorites of mine over the years!""

A friend of mine recorded the Bogdanovich documentary, and I was blown away. I suddenly realized how much his music was in the background of my life. When one considers the man's music catalog, it becomes clear what an iconoclast Tom Petty was and is. This film, while 4 hours, flies by in a blink. Well edited. I have watched it no less than a half dozen times and I never tire of it. It's for that reason I plunked down the cash for the limited edition CD & DVD.

3239408,5,B000XPNZTK,"I remember liking the music that Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers made when they first came along.  My rock and roll listening years coincide pretty much with their history.  And I'm from central Florida too, so it made it a little more special I guess that they were a good band.  I remember the buzz that ""damn the torpedoes"" created when it came out.  So many great songs on one album didn't seem possible.  But to be fair, I didn't try to be an expert on them.  I'm not an expert on much of anything.  But if you were young during the 60's and 70's, and you liked listening to fm radio, then you can better judge my qualifications.  But I do remember an early thought, that Tom Petty sounded like one of Bob Dylan's incarnations.

The biographical movie (the product being reviewed) is good.  It's made in modern times, so you get some good quality sound and video for your home system.  I enjoy this modern way to enjoy rock and roll, and own several other dvd format covers of rock legends.  This one on Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers is a good mix of talk and music.  It's pretty much all positive perspective, so I'd guess it was conceived and financed by themselves (Tom Petty).  That doesn't bother me, because it delivers good entertainment value, and I already liked the music.  I wasn't looking for someone to knock them down anyway.

I'm sort of old now, but I was paying attention when the Beatles were still new and Ed Sullivan was important, ""The times, they are a changin"" was being covered in all the grade school talent shows, and everyone knew who Roy Orbison was.  So when the Traveling Wilburys popped up, and the album was great....that was a great joy for me.  Tom Petty seems to understand how special that opportunity was for him, which I'm happy to know.

The ""other"" disc is a concert in Gainesville, Florida.  It features the modern band line up (which is fine).  As a historical document, it's unfortunate that Petty doesn't look well and seems medicated (to me).  Everyone will have their favorite songs, so I won't try to add something meaningful here.  But I will say, I enjoyed watching another concert video from much earlier in their career that was killer.  Search for Santa Monica New Years concert 1978.  The band is really good live.

I got one of those email reminders to go to amazon and review this purchase.  So I'm here, but I can't really offer anything more profound that what others have said.  Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers have released some great songs and albums.  There are unrecognized gems that never get heard.

3239411,5,B000XPNZTK,"I have been a fan of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers since they hit with Refugee in the 1979. This band is about as solid as they come. This DVD is an excellent look at the history of the band and its members offering insights to how this band got came together and why the line up changed over the years the way that it did.

Personally, I think this band is sometimes underrated because they are a constant  on the music scene without the flashy packaging. The songwriting of this group is what I think has made them indelible, and their musicianship only solidifies them as a great band.

Tom Petty has been described as astute in dealings with the record industry, and there are plenty examples of this in Runnin' Down A Dream, especially dealing with some pathetic songwriters who had been assigned to write Roger McQuinn some material for his album from the early 1990's. Just how Mr. Petty rips into these guys is worth the price of the DVD alone!

It provides a four hour documentary across two DVDs, where you get the full story of the band and some brilliant interviews with Petty and other of the Heartbreakers. Petty comes across as an extremely likeable guy, with a great deal of integrity and it is great to see someone I admire so much talking so candidly about his career. The third DVD is the 30th anniversary concert from Gainsville, Florida, Tom's hometown, and shows just how wonderful he is live and how he can still whip up a crowd and hold them spellbound. Finally the forth disc is a soundtrack CD and has a good selection of his songs from over the years. This is a great package, with an excellent booklet and additional picture cards, that tells the story of who is now a rock and roll institution. A great place to get the full story from the people who truly know how it happened. Insightful, fun and damn good rock music, what more could you ask for? If you like this, check out 'Conversations with Tom Petty by Tom Petty and Paul Zollo', an excellent book of an insightful interview that covers much of the same ground in this documentary.

Nick Schager of Slant Magazine reviewed the documentary saying, ""Employs a warm and leisurely, though never sluggish, pace that's upfront about Bogdanovich's intention to take his sweet time tackling every topic of relevant interest.""

Ronnie Schreib of Variety, reviewed the documentary saying ""A feast for Petty fans and a joyous confirmation of the vitality of the collective creative process.""

Dan Lybarger, of eFilmCritic.com reviewed the documentary saying, ""Peter Bogdanovich's new documentary about the life and career of Florida-born rocker Tom Petty runs nearly four hours and never fails to engage or entertain.""

I would add my personal notes that this movie is very engaging and the 4 hour run length felt like an hour.  The movie really holds your interest and time flew by.

The Blu-ray edition looks fantastic but is not a major upgrade over the regular DVD...EXCEPT for the sound quality which I thought was much better on the Blu-ray.  Not that the DVD sound is bad.

Seeing the interaction between them all was really cool.
I could go on and on but the bottom line is if you are a fan of TPHB or a fan of rock and roll you have to get this video. I recommend the 4 disc set as it has the 30th anniversary concert from Gainsville Florida which is just as incredible. We purchased both!",1277424000,3,734,4.25

Petty and the group are seen as youngsters in Gainsville, Fl., as their first group Mud Clutch, in song writing sessions, with other greats, i.e. Stevie Nicks, Johnny Cash, George Harrison, Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison, and the list goes on. If you never realized Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers are the greatest rock band in American History, and Tom Petty one of the greatest songwriters ever, move over Lennon and McCartney, you will probably come out feeling that way after seeing this DVD. I highly recommend viewing this DVD, with the one warning it it LONG! It took my daughter and I two sessions to watch it.

I didn't know much about Tom Petty growing up, but I've had a bellyful now.  And yes, all the hits sounds strangely familiar, from American Girl to Free Falling, just like we saw on the halftime show at the Super Bowl a year ago.  More recent material hasn't really saturated the airwaves, and some of it like The Last DJ, is almost incredibly insipid.

We get to know and like Tom Petty, though he has a streak of, I don't know what, egotism, that's totally understandable.  After all, he is the most successful rocker ever, or so the movie argues, with sales in the millions and three ""game-changing"" releases.  Still, he doesn't seem like he'd be an easy person to work for and all the Heartbreakers express shock and disappointment over having been treated shabbily, or ignored, at various times.  But I applaud him for showing his faults, he could have authorized a kiss-kiss type lovefest.

One wonders what happened in that divorce that prevented the filmmakers from even mentioning the name of his first wife.  Must have been nasty!  The question of the absent first wife haunts this picture much as it does Hitchcock's Rebecca.",1244764800,6,1259,4.809302325581395

There is a lot of old footage involved which can be interesting and I learned that Tom Petty led a miraculously lucky life. This film seems to try to gloss over his entire life, which I am sure as with almost everyone there is too much to talk about in four hours. I wish that they had concentrated more on the really interesting moments and left out half of what did make it into the film. There are a lot of breaks they just show concert footage for some of his songs.

If you really like Tom Petty, this is made for you. If you are indifferent or dislike him, this won't change anything for you.",1243468800,5,722,3.9793103448275864

Every single performance; from the first one in '06 to the great looking and sounding performances from Top of the Pops, Old Grey Whistle Test, Rockpalast, etc. IS CUT TO RIBBONS by whoever produced this. So you get maybe 30 seconds of music, then cut to an interview, then another 30 seconds, then another interview.

Whoever put this documentary together doesn't think you want to watch an entire live Petty and the Heartbreakers song from start to finish, no matter how rare the material or great the song.

Yeah, I admit there are three whole, uncut live songs on the second dvd. A whole dvd for three concert songs (not 3 concerts, three songs from concerts). Wow.

Anyway, if you're just interested in talking heads and a bit of rock history, it's fine. If you want to see classic performances by a great band, look elsewhere.",1243123200,20,976,4.597701149425287

I've always loved their music,but when I saw this Documentary from beginning to end not only did I discovered why I loved those guys so much,it made me love Rock And Roll and it reinforced the the fact that as long as they still make Albums there will always be be true Rock and Roll in our life time. This is a true American story that is solely based it's roots of the tale that stretches from when a young boy first seen The Beatles and aspired to start a band,to succeeding in a Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame Band for thirty plus years with millions of loyal and loving fans. If you're a Fan like me you'll be singing along word by word and smiling all the way through,or if you just love old school Rock And Roll and enjoy discovering how if you have a love for music and making people happy. It works on so many levels for many people and I'll even bet if you're some sort of Death Metal Fan that secretly likes Tom Petty you'll be telling all your metal friends to watch it. But what I like the most about this Documentary is from a Fan stand point most of the information about Tom I previously knew before,but I really didn't know about the Heartbreakers themselves or knew very little about them. I couldn't believe all the information I DIDN'T know about Mike Campbell,Steve Lynch etc. Plus all the rare footage and actual home-type films that were preserved and shown is absolutely amazing to me that for one are still around and two they thought to preserve their memories of the early days of Mudcrutch and beyond.

You certainly get a lot for your money people believe me on this. You get two discs,the first one is the three plus hour Documentary ""Running Down A Dream"",the second disc is a wonderful extra content-behind the scenes discs filled with rare interviews with Tom and Band,never before seen concert footage and recent interviews with just about everyone that's ever been Mudcrutch and the Heartbreakers. I usually tell you guys some stuff about the what's in the Documentary,but this time I really want you to be surprised and amazed with the content provided. I don't want to give anything away for people unfamiliar with them. Buy it for yourself and enjoy OH and thank me for not telling you right off and for seasoned Fans be prepared to be shock due to the fact that you didn't know absolutely everything about Tom and the Band.

I stand by what I said and if you got nothing of what I said so far please take away this fact:This is the best buy on Amazon Period. Bottom line and if you are a Tom Petty Fan and saying to yourself ""Ah,I'm not sure."",trust me please buy it and prove yourself wrong,because simply put not only is this one of the best Documentaries I've ever seen it is one of those DVDs you'll never let your friends or anyone barrow because it's in that special echelon in your collection that you can not personally afford to let somebody barrow and either lose,keep or damaged. THAT'S how great it truly is. Out of all the stuff I've reviewed on Amazon this by far is my favorite and to say I highly recommend you buy this is an understatement. When I went to buy it originally on here it sold out almost immidiately and I was of course crushed,so in a month or two checked again and they had it back in stock I  snatched it up right then and there. So,what that says is that this should be a must buy for anyone who has a love for music regardless of Genre and/or love Tom Petty And the Heartbreakers but this right now. You absolutely will not regret it and I guarentee you you'll thank me for telling you to do so. You're welcome!(Just Kidding :)",1239062400,,3871,4.381084840055633

The story of Tom Petty is basically THE story of American rock music over the last four decades.  He has played with musical gods such as Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Roy Orbison, and Johnny Cash, and while he would be too modest to admit it, for my money he held his own with each of them.  And let's not forget his incredible band, The Heartbreakers, who have never seemed to have gotten all of the credit that they have deserved.

If you have even an passing interest in the man's music, check out this film and you'll come away impressed.

I anticipated with the interest generated by progressing through the disks and was rewarded by this work as much as when I had seen some of rhe documentaries of classical composers.

The respect given him by artists most of us respect is proof positive.

This outstanding film by Bogdanovich takes on all issues with no BS, just like Petty. This is a great story, but it is really a film (as opposed to a music video).

There is so much to cover, in fact, that this documentary stretches for 4 hours, and that's before you've even touched special features.  The format is somewhat of a common one for musical documentaries.  There is a montage of interview footage that is sliced and diced to tell the story somewhat chronologically from a variety of perspectives.  Even after 4 hours of interview footage, music video clips, concert footage and photo stills, this documentary is a pleasure from start to finish.  That is probably the best testament to how well made and fun to watch this really is.

The format of this documentary should please die-hard fans and casual listeners alike.  I would consider myself a pretty big Tom Petty fan, but I watched this with somebody who was not.  Well after seeing the documentary, they are a fan now.  The last half, in particular, is so chock full of amazing music that most people *know* but not everybody realizes is Tom Petty.  So this is a good movie to watch with somebody you want to convert over to being a Tom Petty fan.

The blend of formats is really good as a *bio-pick* but it's also nice for music history junkies.  Sprinkled into all the interviews are tons of factoids and tidbits about how certain songs came to be, who wrote them, who worked on them, and on and on.  Serious fans will really enjoy all those details.

But everybody can relate to some of the stories of hardship and challenges that are also sprinkled throughout.  We get to hear about Tom's first battle to get out of his record contract when Shelter Records was bought by MCA Universal.  And we get to see the various versions of Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers take shape for various reasons, from Stan slowly falling on his sword to Howie's drug problems.  In fact, it's very surprising just how multi-faceted the telling of these stories is.  Rather than give us the sanitized corporate version of how so-and-so was kicked out of the group, this documentary allows clips of all parties to be included so that you can hear it from the horse's mouth and make up your own mind.  I really appreciate that fact since I love to know as much of the story as possible and I am instinctively distrustful of one-sided portrayals.

As with any music documentary, the music is a large part of this film.  And the depth and bredth of Tom's career is shown, not just in his songs, but in his collaborations with Stevie Nicks, Roger Maguin, George Harrison, Jeff Lynn, and many others.  And of course if you include the supergroup The Travelling Wilburys, you have to add to George Harrison and Jeff Lynn the venerable names of Roy Orbison and Bob Dylan.  This is really an amazing bit of music with some of the best popular artists of the last 50 years represented here.

I highly recommend this documentary.  There is also a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/4-Disc-Set/dp/B000XPNZTK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">4-Disc Set</a>&nbsp;which includes some rare audio tracks and more special features.  So die-hard fans will probably enjoy that set.  I was able to pick it up on sale, but either way this is a great film and you should seek it out.

Highly recommended.

3239463,5,B000XPNZTK,I am so glad to have added this to my collection of Tom Petty music.  It is excellent and has provided me with hours of enjoyment.,1229385600,,130,4.0
3239464,5,B000XPNZTK,"I'd been waiting for this 2 set DVD to come out for months and it finally showed up. It's 4 hours of rock and roll history that focuses on one of the best, tightest, most talented and unpretentious bands ever. Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Just saying it makes a fan smile but this documentary goes deep into the back story of the band and has extended interviews with all of the band members and many people associated with the Heartbreakers through the years.

It covers the whole period from the first days in Gainesville, FL through the latest album, ""Highway Companion"". There's plenty of excellent music but Mr. Petty is fully engaged from beginning to end and he is completely up front in relating the many highs and inevitable lows of the group he started 30 years ago with a dream of making a life as a full on rocker. He did it. And the Heartbreakers did it. Full on.

His songs are the soundtrack to a generation. If you want to know where those songs came from and how they came into being, watch ""Runnin' Down a Dream"". It's all here and my compliments to Mr. Bogdanovich as he made a great, complete documentary that flows smoothly. But I was still wishing for a third 2 hour disc when I finished watching all there was. It's a great story.",1228348800,19,1257,4.437229437229437
3239465,5,B000XPNZTK,"If you are a Tom Petty fan you will love this.  If you aren't a fan you will be.
How many bands can say that they are still playing after 30 years?
Two DVD's tell the story of how the band got started and everything along the way.  The music is great, the video's are great.  It shows footage from way back which is really fun to see.  Especially if you have been a fan along the way.
You need to watch this.  If you don't want to watch just listen.  It is extremely entertaining!",1226966400,2,480,4.0
3239466,4,B000XPNZTK,Saw this when it aired on Independent TV earlier in 2008 -- very thorough biography about the band and great song selections -- lots of awesome live and in-studio material.  Every Tom Petty fan needs to see this!,1223856000,8,212,4.578947368421052
3239467,5,B000XPNZTK,"Ok. This will probably be the strangest rave Tom Petty review you ever read.

I don't like Tom Petty's music. I have never owned a Tom Petty album, and am highly unlikely to ever own one. Yet I think this was one of the best rock documentaries ever made,and I was fascinated throughout.

You see, this is not a concert, but the story of a band. Just because you're not a fan of an artists music doesn't mean they don't have a great story to tell, and this one does. It was directed by 70's wunderkind Peter Bogdonovich, and he does a beautiful job at giving Tom's 35 year career the epic scope that he, and the audience deserved. For once, a film is able to go into the depth of detail that you wanted to know. Why did the drummer get fired? They actually tell you. There's nothing more frustrating than a film that doesn't tell you what you want to know, but this one does.

The band itself, is not terribly charismatic, and there isn't much in the ""Motley Crue"" vein of wild stories of excess or soap opera-style conflict and controversy, they are just some quiet guys who like to play easy-listening roots-rock without any gimmicks or sensationalism. But it's rarely boring, especially for musicians, since there's lots of detail given on the making and recording of the albums.

I may not be a Tom Petty fan, and did find myself fast-forwarding through some of the extended music performances, but look at it this way, if I was interested and entertained throughout, than a Petty fan is sure to be in heaven. Now if only someone would make a film this good about a band I like... Highly Highly recommended.",1213401600,,1610,4.484641638225256
3239468,4,B000XPNZTK,"As a casual fan of Tom Petty, Peter Bogdanavich's documentary did an outstanding job helping me understand the evolution of the Heartbreakers personnel and the depth of Tom's songwriting. I had recently been listening the Anthology 2 CD set and failed to realize just how many radio hits TPHB enjoyed. I will now go back and checkout all the album cuts. I'll surely find some gems!",1209945600,2,381,4.787878787878788
3239469,5,B000XPNZTK,"Not much to add here....everyone said it all.  Best thing on the documentary part is Petty in the studio with Roger McGuinn, going off on a couple of record company hot-shots who show up to  try to get Roger to record a bad song.  Petty is as smart and business-savvy as he is talented.  The Heartbreakers are probably the best sounding band in the world right now, and Petty's songwriting is right up there with Springsteen, Mellencamp, Simon, etc.  I'd have paid triple the price for this set.  The Gainsville concert is fabulous.  There's obviously been some post-show in-studio touch ups, namely overdubbed backround vocals on a few tunes, but what group doesn't do this?  The overall sonic quality is first rate.  The hell with paying $100 to sit a quarter of a mile away from the stage next to some bozos talking on their cell phones.  Buy this DVD, slap on some headphones, sit up close to your monitor, and you've got the best seat in the house!",1208304000,,953,4.585798816568047
3239470,5,B000XPNZTK,"I would have to admit straight away that I am not really a ""Tom Petty Fan"" the songs I know of his are the ones I saw on MTV. I happened to catch this on the Sundance channel and was pleasantly surprised by what a good story it was. I went out and purchased the DVD right away and it made me realize how many hit songs Tom actually had, and how his songs played a part of 80's-90's pop culture. His role as a band leader reminds me of a time when music and playing in a band were not just ""Pieces of Product to be packaged and sold"" I would highly recommend this DVD to any musician or anyone that enjoys a good movie",1208217600,,617,3.9047619047619047
3239471,4,B000XPNZTK,"This DVD set contains a lengthy 2 disc documentary which was great and never got boring.  The concert footage was also fun to watch or have playing in the background.  The music CD was short and nothing special in my opinion and I will continue to listen to my Tom Petty albums instead. Overall, if you like Tom Petty even a little bit, you will not be disappointed with this purchase.",1205280000,2,385,4.408450704225352
3239472,4,B000XPNZTK,"I've watched the DVD's complete and felt it was excellent and essential for most Tom Petty fans.  The documentary delves into recording techniques which may not be for the casual viewer.  There are also plenty of names dropped throughout the documentary such as Tom Leadon. If you don't recognize that last name then you may not realize the impact of the connection with the Eagles.  There's many others that may not lend credence to the importance of Tom's mentioning these names such as Denny Cordell, Del Shannon, Jimmy Iovine, Shelly Yackus (Raspberries engineer) and Leon Russell to name a few more.  Additionally, the documentary jumps around a bit and leaves out details as stated by Tom in his book ""Conversations with Tom Petty"".  Examples of this are how Tom talks on when they first landed in LA and hit various record companies.  Ironically Shelter records is not mentioned and low and behold Denny Cordell is introduced out of nowhere whereas the book discusses this link in far more detail.  I believe there is also one inaccuracy as where Tom demands the record company not use Hard Promises as the first LP to go 9.98 list.  I recall list price for LP's being far less than 9.98 in 1981.  I believe it was more like 7.98 as I stil lhave my original LP with a 4.99 sticker bought new.  The live concert is pretty good (5.1 sound is decent - not great) and the 4th item (CD) has a very tinny sound so don't expect too much there as the tracks are taken from TV appearances for the most part.  Sadly, the one audio track from a TV show in the documentary is not included in this 4th audio cd (track is on DVD #1 but title is unknown).  Highlight on disc one is American Girl from a 1981 TV performance..this was amazing.

All in all, this box set is well worth the price of admission.  You're Gonna Get It.

3239473,5,B000XPNZTK,"I am not the biggest Petty fan.  In fact I only own his Greatest Hits CD.  After watching him play in the Super Bowl, I went and bought this DVD set for the 30th anniversary concert DVD.  I was not too keen on watching a 4 hour long documentary, but thought since I own the DVD's, I should watch it at least once.

OMG, was I wrong... 4 hours just flew by.  What an amazing documentary.  No narration what so ever, this is the true story of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers as told by the band members themselves, through old cam corder and tv footage.  Celebrities such as Dave Grohl, Eddie Vedder and Johnny Depp (all fans of Petty) make appearances.

It was very sad to see that the world is just about making fast selling music and not long lasting music.  That's what makes Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers one of the last acts of it's kind!

To sum it up, I am not a die hard Petty fan, but this documentary is probably the one of the best out there.  I certainly appreciate and respect TP a lot more now.",1202256000,,1009,4.176165803108808

The documentary and live footage is simply awesome.  Sound is solid (dolby digital 5.1).  Buy this now!",1200787200,,394,4.1866666666666665
3239475,5,B000XPNZTK,"I just bought this DVD last night at my local store. I have been a moderate Tom Petty fan all my life. I have always enjoyed his music but never really understood the history of the group.
This is an in depth insight of Tom Petty from his early years in the music business all the way upto today.
There are two CD's devoted to him telling the story of the band.
There is also a concert DVD of the Band in Tom's hometowm, Gainsville Florida. The concert is very good and features special guest Stevie Nicks an honorary member of the Heartbreakers. My only complaint with the concert is that a few of my favorites are left off and its a little short.
I would recommend this not only to fans of the group but those who want to know the history of Rock and Roll.......Tom Petty is now in the Hall of Fame and this will let you know why............OUTSTANDING",1200096000,,854,4.277777777777778
3239476,4,B000XPNZTK,"The story of Jesus Christ himself could easily be told in 2 hours.  Tom Petty doesn't deserve four.  This is clearly a self-financed puff piece.

That said, it is a very well done puff piece.

What holds it together is the incredible archival material they dug up, mastered into HD widescreen.  A bit of George Harrison interview prior to his death.  Details seemingly lost to time are explained by Harrison, from the grave.

Excellent, rare concert footage and audio from the 70s and 80s.  More studio footage from 1982, 1985, 1994.  Wilburys rehearsing at Dylan's house in 1989.  The video surprises keep on coming.  They have a wealth of material to tell this story on the screen.

The story though is a little cheesy.  It's clearly not edited by a neutral observer.  It has a positive sheen to everything.  What becomes very weird, after all the buildup, is Tom's dictator / CEO role vs his band-mates and co-writers.

From a band dynamics perspective, Tom comes off surprisingly tough and heartless.  His band members are his employees, and never once credits them with helping to compose ""his"" music.  Not much of a plural story.  Some of the best insights are from record company executives.

It gets a little sappy and gratuitous.  Cameos from Stevie Nicks.  Johnny Depp, Eddie Vedder.  Stan Lynch, the drummer who left in 1993, is heavily featured in the movie, which is good because he provides some much needed counterpoint.  Lynch's uneven drumming was clearly a part of the classic Petty sound that became world famous.  Losing him and his personality was clearly something that signaled the end of the classic Heartbreakers era.",1199664000,5,1642,4.883636363636364

I've been a casual Tom Petty fan for many years and as a muscian myself have always respected him huge as a songwriter as well as the Heartbreakers.  However, I really started to have a new appreciation for him after reading his autobiography last year and began to listen to his whole catalog...I am just blown away by the depth and committment to great songwriting that is apparent in every darn song.  It is just really hard to find a Tom Petty song that is not superb.  So, you just don't start out or end up in the league these guys are in without a very compelling story behind it all and the movie just tells the story so well and what an entertaining story it is!",1198886400,2,834,4.253164556962025
3239478,5,B000XPNZTK,"I caught this on Sundance and was mesmerized for 4 hours! I always liked Tom and band.. the thing is he is so deceptively a talented songwriter that it was easy to take him for granted. Forgive me Tom for doing that! After learning so much about him as a man, and a kind, sweet man at that, for some reason that helped me appreciate his poetry and musical skills all the more.  The movie shows his seedling talent and how he persisted and learned and grew, and also kept a strong core of optimism and delight at how things in his life unfolded. Beautifully done camera and wonderful clips of young Tom and band. Absolutely worth every penny, and even if you think you are not a big TP fan, get it anyway if you like any rock music at all, you will be converted, as I was. I am now in the process of buying every thing this brilliant man has ever done.
And now we will be treated to TP and HB halftime at the Superbowl. I hate football but will be sure to watch this year!

I discovered Tom around the ""Hard Promises"" album via MTV videos and now that I think about, he has consistently released great music for 30 years.  I have listened to the new album ""Highway Companion"" and I find it to be as good as anything I've heard from him.

What I did get from the movie is that Tom may be the most geniune rock & rollers ever.  He knows what he wants and never lets up.  Also the movie reinforced what I already believed:  Mike Campbell is the most underrated guitarists ever.  He may not be flashy but he can play just about anything.  The same is true of Benmont Tench, both are incredible musicians.  In fact, as you can see from lineup changes, without Mike & Ben the Heartbreakers sound is not complete.

Bottom line:  Tom is one of the greatest American songwriters ever and watching this will confirm this!",1197849600,36,993,4.395604395604396

(Remember kids Howie was going down hill by then.....so I was curious to how that record came about and the sessions etc).......even if it was quickly mentioned.  Also when it comes to Howie they miss a couple of key points that Tom has already made in the interview book released a few years back. Howie was FIRED....understandable so....but that is never stated.....and in the book Tom recounts how Howie is arrested in New Mexico with his girlfriend Carlene Carter, they fly him to a gig that night or next day and he literally shows up with NO SHOES. Now I don't want to put that in to make fun of Howie, who lost his battle with drugs and died....but it just shows what a bad state he was in and WHY the heartbreakers had to move on without him.
