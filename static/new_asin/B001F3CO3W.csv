8300905,3,B001F3CO3W,"This is for the AMC/Genius Entertainment version of this DVD. This is the thin case with the yellow top and green letters saying ""Animated Classic"" with a picture of Gulliver sitting up and looking at you. It says ""digitally remastered"" which once again, in their opinion, it is supposed to mean more than what it actually is. While the color looks fairly rich I would hazard a guess that this is a 16mm TV print because it is still a little rough looking and over exposed (faded) in places and it has about 6 or 7 minutes cut from the film. Near the first of the film when Gulliver is washed ashore he staggers up on the beach and lies face down and then slowly turns over... there is a slow dissolve and we meet Gabby the town crier who eventually finds the giant (Gulliver) on the beach and so he runs to the castle to tell the king. This version however has Gulliver lying face down on the beach and then there is a terrible cut that takes the audience straight to the castle and in the middle of a broken dialogue between two kings. This is almost as if the film had broken and a part of it was just discarded into the trash bin. I cannot recommend this version as a full-length feature as it is not. No wonder it was a buck.",1458432000,,1230,4.216101694915254
8300906,4,B001F3CO3W,"I have come to like this enactment more and more as time has gone on. I use it in conjunction with the original text to teach it and even if it adds the extra plot points it comes closest to what feels like the original intent of the writer in tone and content. There is an off putting clownishness to it, but I think that was part of the author's point and real feeling does come through in the right spots, enough to keep you engaged at the very least.",1413676800,,454,4.055555555555555
8300907,5,B001F3CO3W,"I've seen the movie 3 or 4 times prior to buying it and loved it everytime I saw it. I couldn't find this version of the story anywhere and so glad I found it. Thank you. I got 2 copies, but going to give one to my brother, I thought he might like it because the last time he saw it, I was a teenager.",1351641600,,301,3.646153846153846
8300908,4,B001F3CO3W,"I did not realize this was coming from Thailand. You have to go into the menus and select English. This was a great movie for the family. It was a little long for the younger ones, but good for 15 and up.",1345420800,,204,3.880952380952381
8300909,5,B001F3CO3W,"This was the only region 'All' of this DVD I could find anywhere in shops and online. Even though it is from Thailand it came up straight away in English and Thai subtitles underneath which are easy to turn off or switch to English. I'm very impressed with the quality of the DVD (it was wrapped brand new and is a legitimate copy). It was a great to watch a movie from my childhood again.

Thanks!",1324857600,5,398,4.2368421052631575
