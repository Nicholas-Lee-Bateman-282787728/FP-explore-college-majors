Do not watch this expecting legit horror, it will fall flat. If you are into misplaced dialogue, male and female leading roles that respectively resemble Justin Timberlake rocking a blonde curly mullet, and a girl with a unibrow all the way around her head, then you've hit the jackpot. This movie has so many holes in it that they could've used it to defend OJ. If you have a region-free DVD player, check this out., and keep your expectations on the floor.",1503619200,,578,4.621359223300971
