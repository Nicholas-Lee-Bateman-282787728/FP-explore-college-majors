1232048,2,B00000JGF0,"I was a great fan of Red Dwarf for years. Season VII put me right off, and while its successor improves minutely, the difference is so very small its hardly detectable. None of the capable actors are given humourous material  to work with - and we know they /can/ - and much of the satire is  grimace-inducing rather than the intended effect. Avoid at all costs. Or  rather pick up any vid from the first six seasons...",946166400,3,419,4.415584415584416
1232049,5,B00000JGF0,The boys from the Dwarf are back! Season eight is great and guess what RIMMER is back! The gang finally gets back to Red Dwarf but things are not  quite the same. If you are a follower of this series then this is a must  have for you!,941155200,3,234,3.8541666666666665
1232050,3,B00000JGF0,"Hell, I'd say it's marginally better than VII, which, while not mind-blowing, was certainly a massive improvement over series V and VI, both of which were really pretty wretched.  Mind you, neither VII or VIII  are nearly as good as the first four.  Has its moments nonetheless, and is  of course worth owning, even if I'll always be asking myself why there can  never be another Waiting for God or Thanks for the Memory.  Oh well.",940118400,,431,4.605263157894737
1232051,4,B00000JGF0,"Althought this series is a good addition to the Red Dwarf ""saga"", it takes away from some of the best aspects of the earlier series. Instead of it being just the standard crew that we have  grown to know and love, we now find that the entire crew of the Dwarf have  been resurected. This makes for some new plot twists and hilarious  situations but, in my opinion takes away from the original premise. But  despite all of this it is a hilarious return for a great series!",938908800,,471,4.318181818181818
1232052,5,B00000JGF0,"I have been a Red Dwarf Fan for years. I own all the tapes, including the Smeg Outs and Ups. This latest series is some of their best work. New cast members and some old ones too! I highly recommend the entire Red Dwarf  Series. Series VIII adds a whole new dimension.",937872000,,268,4.153846153846154
7912008,5,B00000JGF0,"After the pretty weak Series 7, I was glad to see Red Dwarf return to being a quality sci-fi comedy.  The format may have altered, but all long-running shows must experiment or they'll just run out of steam (as I think Series 7 proved).  In these three episodes, the crew return to a Red Dwarf re-created by the nanobots, only to find those little robots have also re-created the crew.  As a result, the regulars find themselves in the brig in what becomes a kind of 'Porridge in Space'.  The trial of the regulars is covered in three interesting, well-written episodes.  Rimmer returns, and is back to being at his most hilariously slippery and obnoxious.  The re-created characters, such as the Captain, work well, and there are some wonderfully surreal sequences such as Cat teaching spaceships to dance and a plasticine world.  Well worth getting, as these episodes demonstrate the series really is back in the red.",1104537600,,919,4.8152866242038215
7912009,1,B00000JGF0,"See, the thing about a comedy partnership is that there has to be the two of you. Rob Grant left the Grant Naylor partnership after RD6. Rob was the more comedy-oriented of Grant Naylor, and, sadly, it shows from that point on.
Everyone has different opinions as to which series are good/bad.
Myself:
5 is great RD stuff.
6 is brilliant. Anyone who can watch ""Gunmen of the Apocalypse"" and not laugh needs a very serious psychiatrist.
7 is weak. Bits are OK, but it's not the same Red Dwarf any more.
Series Eight is absolutely appalling. To use Rimmer's insult from Series Five, ""I consider it an insult to my backside that it was forced to sit here growing carbuncles"" through this unfunny stuff. The jokes in the series are usually:
1) Forced rehashes of when the show was actually funny
2) Completely, mystifyingly unnecessary to the show
3) Imitation Farelly Bros. , (and I consider the Farelly Bros. pretty bad to begin with.)
In particular, The Captain is a magnet for unfunniness. So is most of the prisoners and prison guards. Anyone in the vicinity of these characters seems to lose the ability to do comedy.
One of the ""jokes"" in the series is as follows:
Lister and Rimmer have found a Time Wand, which controls time. After causing much havoc with it, they are summoned to the Captain. At the end of this extremely repetetive and unfunny scene, he tells them to leave (or words to that extent). Lister proceeds to use the Time Wand to make the Captain repeat the line over... and over... and over.
Apparently, Doug Naylor now thinks that getting someone to repeat the same unfunny line five times after it was already not funny the first time constitutes Red Dwarf-worthy comedy.
You have been warned. If Naylor is allowed to direct the Red Dwarf movie on his own, I may well picket it.",1019001600,6,1798,4.604361370716511
7912010,3,B00000JGF0,"Series VIII - Not, as I was hoping, a continuation of the delightful character driven series VII, but an attempt at the wild comedy that we saw in series VI with gags coming thick and fast. Successful? The episodes that bookend this tape are classic dwarf, as good as any, one is OK, the other is pitiful.
BITR pt 1
This is a really, really funny episode with some classic moments. To my delight, it contained some wonderful Rimmer/Lister sparring, not seen since series 11. The visual effects have also vastly improved since the last series - the re-created original bunkroom being the highlight. The whole rat-arsed scenario is likewise simply fantastic. Doug Naylor's script has rarely been better, the only mis-tep being that there are so MANY jokes that some fall flat - ""Are you sure your chair is tied down"" etc. But that is such a minor quibble in a simply stunning first episode. Great! 4/4
BITR pt 2
After such a fantastic first installment, it was inevitable that the pace would not be kept up, and it isn't. Quite. The second episode starts well enough with funny and enjoyable scenes - the dinner scene is especially memorable - but it soon degenerates into painful viewing with the whole Kryten toilet thing and the return of a very irritating bunch of Duane Dibbley's. These two scenes hurt the show, but it has so many other good points it is saved. Lot of good Lister/Rimmer dialogue, great gags and set pieces. 2.5/4
BITR pt 3
A hugely dissapointing conclusion to the three parter. The worst episode in Red Dwarf history. There is very little coherence in this episode. The jokes are mostly poor,the acting is weak and the dance is boring. A few plusses - ""Cut off both his b!""$$s with a blunt knife!"" and the opening bunk scene. But other than that it is mostly rubbish from start to finish. Painful. 1.5/4
Cassandra
A fantastic episode. Harks back to the Red Dwarf glory days. Funny, inventive and entertaining. Everything about this eisode is superb and the new characters are great. 4/4",1006387200,3,2008,4.691218130311615
7912011,5,B00000JGF0,"This was a perfect way to start off with a the last season. Bringing Rimmer back was a great idea, giving us Rimmer and Lister duels, as it should be. The luck and love virus' are hilarous.",981590400,3,189,4.135135135135135
7912012,1,B00000JGF0,"I love Red Dwarf.  Every episode was classic...until this series.  To put it bluntly I hate it.  The jokes arn't funny, the characters become annoying and worst of all Rimmer's alive.
This series is REALLY slap stick, but it has its saving graces, but they are so few they aren't worth mentioning.  So instead of buying this buy the books.",981158400,2,339,4.6
7912013,5,B00000JGF0,"Oh, how I loath the weasel minded gimboids who have written an amazon review purely to slag off another brilliant series of my favourite program. Yes, the creators have varied the format over seasons 6,7 and 8. It hasent made it worse. If anything it keeps it fresh and alive. Would you rather watch a series like FRIENDS which never changes, the quality simply pales and pales. I think not.
Personally I would say series 6 and 7 are the best ever- and series 8 is certainly not without merit. ""Krytie TV"" and ""Only the Good"" are honestly 2 of the funniest episodes you're likely to see. ""Cassandra"" is one of the most perfect. But I digress- its the epic trilogy ""Back in the Red"" I'm here to review.
This was orginally a one hour special but it had to become a three parter to keep the BBC happy. If series 7 was a dry run for the movie film wise, this is a great dry run script wise. A strong plot and so many winning sceens- Krytens councelling, the blue midgit dance, the duane dibbly escape(bring that dork back anytime- I love him!), Rimmers salute, Lister irritating Rimmer till he speaks, Kryten forcing hostages to sit on toilets- I could go on and on.
I love all the new characters in this series and the return of captain H and Bob the skutter. The canaries was a brilliant concept to add scifi adventure, but this series was much more about Red Dwarf letting it hair down and having a laugh. And why not, I say!
My one critism for this series is that with all the new characters and ideas, Kochanski and Holly are slightly left out. I hope this will be sorted out in the up coming movie.",975715200,6,1600,4.336666666666667
7912014,2,B00000JGF0,"A passionate appeal to the creators of Red Dwarf: please, please let Duane Dibbly alone. It befouls the memory of Back to Reality to keep resurrecting  the Cat's geeky alter ego merely for a cheap ploy to ingratiate the  audience.
Furthermore, if any crew member had to be featured from the  1st and 2nd seasons, why not Olaf Peterson? Perhaps the actor was  unavailable...still, way too much Captain Hollister in the 8th  series.
Ugh. I miss the old days of Red Dwarf, before they were convicts,  when they had free range of motion, before Lister and Rimmer were more  chums than enemies. It was wise to change the format of Red Dwarf for the  8th series in order to keep the show fresh, but perhaps if such a drastic  change were required it would've been better to leave the show alone.
Back in the Red parts 1,2,3 create the premise for the new style of Red  Dwarf. The ship is rebuilt, the crew resurrected, and the Dwarfers are in  big trouble as no third technician is supposed to be driving a Starbug.  There are moments of genius; particularly Kryten's interview with the  psychiatrist and Rimmer's (at least Chris Barrie is back!) prolonged  salutes and experience with the sexual magnetism virus.
But overall, I  am very sorry to say that the magic behind Red Dwarf's creation is gone.",967680000,2,1296,4.647577092511013
7912015,3,B00000JGF0,"Yes, you heard me, this is the show's first three-part adventure, a terrific movie that brings back the indispensible Arnold Rimmer along with  the Red Dwarf mining ship and its entire crew! Holly's back too! Heck, even  the scutters are back!
This epic is a mostly succesful attempt to put the  show back on track. Although everyone gets something to do, the focus is  once again on Lister and Rimmer, the odd couple of space.
What really  makes this show work is that underneath all that gadgetry, it's really  about two mismatched roommates trying to get along. Why the Sci-FI Channel  won't pick up this gem is beyond me.",966556800,2,625,4.678899082568807
7912016,1,B00000JGF0,"This series of Red Dwarf promised so much after the anodyne Series 7, but upon its launch, it revealed itself to be nothing of the comeback it was intended to be.
The character development has gone to pot, with Lister,  the Cat, Rimmer and especially Kryten all acting out of their normal  personality bands.
The plotlines are stretched past the realms of  credibility and into the poorly implemented domain of cheap American  sitcoms. The same can be said for the jokes, which in places make you feel  as if you are watching an episode of Bottom, rather than a sophisticated  comedy/satire like Red Dwarf.
Red Dwarf was just so good through the  first five series, combining fascinating characters, plotlines and great  special effects (series 3 onwards) with sophisticated, intellectual humour  with the odd corny gag thrown in for good measure. It worked so well and  each episode felt as if it had been thought out. This series has NONE of  that atmosphere and as such deserves to be purchased for no other reason  other than to complete a collection.",963792000,3,1055,4.832402234636872
7912017,2,B00000JGF0,"Red Dwarf 8 was recieved eagerly in both the UK and overseas. Hovever, despite vastly improved special effects, it seems that the writers of Red Dwarf, for the first time for over a decade, have run out of ideas. The series was brilliant in its early stages, and maybe it is just overshadowed  by the hiarious series 7, but Red Dwarf 8 just seems very substandard  compared with earlier episodes. The acting is very good from all cast  members, but it is unfortunately very poorly written. If you really want to  see Red dwarf in its full splendour, I would suggest the newly digitally  remastered Series 1,2, & 3 videos available in most video shops, and  give this one a miss, unless all you want is to be dazzled by high-budget  computer graphics.",952214400,5,750,4.593984962406015
