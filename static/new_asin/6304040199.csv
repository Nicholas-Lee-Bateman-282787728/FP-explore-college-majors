8145270,4,6304040199,"TWO EPISODES WERE EDITED TOGETHER TO MAKE THE 90 MINUTE MOVIE ""REMEMBER"" The episodes are from the rarely seen or heard about tv series titled MATT LINCOLN, starring VINCE EDWARDS. MATT LINCOLN WAS A QUALITY SERIES THAT AIRED ON ABC IN 1970. IT DEALT WITH A PSYCHIATRIC SOCIAL WORKER WHO RAN A WALK-IN CLINIC AND A TELEPHONE HOTLINE FOR EMOTIONALLY TROUBLED TEENS. VINCE EXUDED EMPATHY IN THE ROLE AS THE PSYCHIATRIST THESE TEENS TURNED TO FOR HELP.

MATT LINCOLN WAS THE DEFINITIVE 1970'S SERIES. IT DEFINED THE ERA. THE CLOTHES, MORES, AND THE GENERATION GAP WERE ALL ON DISPLAY. THE TITLES OF THE EPISODES WERE PROPER NAMES.

WHY IS MATT LINCOLN NOT MORE WELL KNOWN? ABC, IN ITS INFINITE WISDOM, AIRED THIS DRAMA SERIES AT THE RIDICULOUS HOUR OF 7:30. OF COURSE, IT MISSED ITS TARGET AUDIENCE AND WAS CANCELLED AFTER 16 EPISODES. MATT LINCOLN WAS NEVER GIVEN A CHANCE IN A ""NORMAL"" TIMESLOT. THIS SERIES WAS EXTREMELY WELL WRITTEN. WHO DOESN'T LOVE VINCE EDWARDS, OF BEN CASEY? THE TWO EPISODES THAT COMPRISE ""REMEMBER"" ARE ADAM, AND LIA.

MATT LINCOLN WOULD BE THE PERFECT SERIES' RELEASE ON DVD. RETRO IS SO IN VOGUE TODAY. YOU WILL NOT FIND A MORE RETRO SERIES THAN MATT LINCOLN. IT ALSO WAS THE FIRST SERIES TO DEAL WITH REAL EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS IN AN ADULT MANNER. THE PILOT AIRED AS AN ABC TV MOVIE OF THE WEEK AND IS TITLED ""DIAL HOT LINE"". IT STARS VINCE EDWARDS AND KIM HUNTER. UNIVERSAL OWNS THE 16 EPISODES PLUS DIAL HOT LINE. DIAL HOT LINE IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST RATED ABC TV MOVIES OF THE WEEK. THE SIXTEEN INDIVIDUAL EPISODES OF MATT LINCOLN AND DIAL HOT LINE ARE NOWHERE IN SIGHT. PARDON ME, THEY ARE SITTING ON A SHELF AT THE UCLA FILM AND TV ARCHIVES AND AT UNIVERSAL COLLECTING DUST.

WHY SHOULD CONSUMERS OF TODAY CONTINUE TO BE PUNISHED BY A PROGRAMMING BLUNDER BY ABC OVER 4O YEARS AGO? THE INDIVIDUAL EPISODES OF MATT LINCOLN AND DIAL HOT LINE SHOULD BE ON DVD. WHY WAS BEN CASEY AN ICONIC SERIES? VINCE EDWARDS AND GREAT WRITING. MATT LINCOLN COULDN'T BE A MORE APROPOS SERIES TO RELEASE, SINCE MOD SQUAD AND ROOM 222 HAVE ALREADY HAD THEIR RELEASE. MATT LINCOLN IS OF THE SAME GENRE, ONLY BETTER ACTING AND WRITING.

THE THEME OF MATT LINCOLN IS ""SOMEONE CARES"". THE PUBLIC CARE. THERE IS A TRIBUTE TO VINCE EDWARDS PLAYING ON YOUTUBE WITH OVER 22,000 VIEWS. HERE ARE SOME OF THE GUEST STARS WHO APPEARED, PETER DEUEL, MARTIN SHEEN,, PATTY DUKE, DARREN MCGAVIN, JOAN VAN ARK. THESE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE GUEST STARS. TOMORROW WOULD HAVE BEEN VINCE'S 82nd BIRTHDAY. HE PASSED AWAY IN 1996 FROM PANCREATIC CANCER. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS LIKE MYSELF ARE WANTING AND WAITING FOR THE 16 EPISODES AND PILOT FILM OF MATT LINCOLN TO BE RELEASED. WAKE UP DISTRIBUTORS!",1278547200,2,2683,4.628151260504202
