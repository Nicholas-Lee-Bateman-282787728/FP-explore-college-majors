5891142,5,B00E5G03GQ,"I have pretty much all the MLB's world series collections.  This one is old school.  The video is grainy, but it isn't overwrought with tinsely effects.  The audio is better than what we've had the last few years, with Joe Buck's son.  Good lively, discussion (whether listening to the TV or radio announcers).

I'm only on the third game, but I've watched these first three games a few times each, soaking them in.  Game three is the clincher.  Basically, the Padres can't bring anyone who can pitch.  They're setting the record for walks.  Sparky was saying the Tigers aren't hitting, but if the Padres don't pitch, it don't matter.  Tigers are striking me as not very impressive.  Padres just getting in their own way, without having a good pitcher.  If they'd had Kevin McReynolds, they might have won.  (Kinda like the Red Sox in '75 not having Jim Rice, their best hitter.)

Garvey has not been doing well, but Nettles continues to impress at the plate, from his glory days.  He's the consummate pro.  In fact, the Padres are basically a revamped Yankee team from the 70s!  Bobby Brown, Goose.

My daughter loves the old Padres uniforms and so do I.  And of course the Tigers' are classics.  Tiger Stadium is great to watch, a real treat.  The Tigers pitching is very good, excellent, and Chet Lemon in CF is very impressive on both sides of the ball.

So far, my impression is that both teams are inferior to other world series contenders, but it's still an incredible joyful series to watch.  It's a unique, strange pairing too.

Can't wait to see how the series ends (again)!  Saw it live in '84, but like these other series, a fresh view is a fresh perspective.

Btw, my favorite so far is `79 Bucs/Orioles.  Best comeback.",1398816000,,1733,4.615131578947368
5891143,3,B00E5G03GQ,"Great to see this WS released. However, the MLB watermark is HUGE on the screen and extremely distracting. It's too bad MLB, A&E, and Lionsgate didn't consider the viewer and customer when putting this annoying (again, I can't emphasize how big this is on screen) visual is. Also, why aren't there any graphics (batting & pitching stats) on the broadcast? They certainly had these graphics in 1984, yet there aren't any (at least in Game 1 - I haven't gotten to Game 2 yet).",1395446400,,474,4.654761904761905
5891144,5,B00E5G03GQ,These DVD's are wonderful. Such great memories for me. I was a bit sad that Ernie Harwell's radio play by play was only on Detroit's home games. I would have loved to hear his play by play during the San Diego home games. Still very worth having them.,1393632000,2,251,4.25
5891145,3,B00E5G03GQ,"Don't get me wrong, because I enjoyed the complete games and no commercials and the speed of the game.  However I did expect Vin Scully and Joe Garigiola on all the broadcasts, like my VHS tapes.  They only did 3 series together, why trash so many of their innings?  The jumping back and forth from Buck and Mussburger is annoying.  Give us the radio ""option"" don't force sudden changes on us please.
  Secondly the video quality of game 3- is worse than my 30 year old VHS tapes.
  Lastly, the MLB watermark is so big it covers crucial parts of the picture!  The purity of 1984 is no screen banners, scores on the screen or adds behind home plate.  Shrink it down.
  The 1986, 1987, 1988, and 2001 box sets should be the standard to follow. They are worth every penny.  When you do 80,81,82,83,89& 90, and I hope you do, please consider us.  Thanks",1390003200,10,849,4.393548387096774

5891148,4,B00E5G03GQ,"It is what it is. The 1984 World Series was not exactly a classic. However, if you are a Tiger's fan or a baseball collector it is well worth adding to your collection. The price is right and the memories are fun to relive. It may not be my first pick but it was worth the look.",1385856000,2,278,3.8947368421052633
5891149,5,B00E5G03GQ,"I was expecting one dvd, I was so surprised when I found 5 dvds, all 5 games of that series, it far exceeded my expectations, if you're a Detroit Tigers fan this will be a treasured keepsake, 2 discs contain radio broadcasts of the series to go with the network broadcast ENJOY.",1384819200,3,278,4.365384615384615
5891150,4,B00E5G03GQ,"The 5 disc DVD set includes all 5 games of the 1984 World Series in their original network format from NBC. The games have no real extras except for a paper insert in the inside cover and an option to listen to the radio broadcast dubbed over the video instead of the NBC audio. The games in Detroit have the legendary Ernie Harwell and Paul Carey at the mikes while the games played in San Diego offer the team of the great Jack Buck and Brent Musberger for audio. Other than that there is not much else to describe. The game 5 victory does not include much in the way of post game celebration except for about 30 seconds or so and it certainly would have been nice to have included the post game celebration in the locker room. The overall video quality is average at best and in some spots is not very good. One would expect a little better video quality of games of this magnitude played in a sport as prominent as MLB in the modern era. It also would have been nice to have some extras such as the ALCS clincher against Kansas City but overall it is nice to have this series in its entirety for the watching after 29 years especially with the loss of Tiger Stadium and to hear the voices of Ernie Harwell and Paul Carey again but it certainly could have been done better for the reasons listed above. All in all though, for the true Tiger fan, it is great to see and hear, and worth the purchase.",1382227200,3,1401,4.231343283582089
5891151,4,B00E5G03GQ,"For years, I've been waiting for the 1984 World Series to show up on DVD.  Frankly, I thought it would never happen--despite having one of the most remarkable seasons in MLB history, this 1984 Tigers team is still inexplicably and wrongly dismissed by fans and sportswriters who (a) still regret that the Chicago Cubs, despite taking a 2-0 lead in the N.L.C.S., would fail to win the pennant after a remarkable San Diego Padres comeback, and (b) preferred to focus on the riots which occurred in the streets of Detroit in the aftermath of the Series victory.

Needless to say, there is very little mention of the Cubs and no mention of the riots in this set.  To finally own all five of these games on DVD (or any medium) is a dream come true.  However, as this is the first complete World Series DVD box that I have ever purchased, I was taken aback by certain aspects of this set--I don't know if my expectations were too high; I'll just discuss the thoughts I had as I made my way through these games.

First of all, I was disappointed by the packaging.  Other such collections, including the ""Essential Games Of The Detroit Tigers"" box, very nicely packaged each individual disc in a slim DVD case complete with artwork and a boxscore.  This set, in contrast, crams all five discs into a single DVD case; box scores are included in an enclosed booklet.  Still--no big deal.

According to the outer packaging, the set includes ""RADIO CALLS--listen to local radio broadcasts for all five World Series games.""  This was good news--a highlight of the ""Essential Games Of The Detroit Tigers"" box was the inclusion of the original WJR radio broadcast with Ernie Harwell and Paul Carey as an alternate audio track for Game 5.  Naturally, I assumed that Games 1 through 4 would also include the original WJR broadcasts.  Unfortunately for fans of Ernie and Paul, Games 1 and 2 instead contained audio from the CBS Radio Sports network broadcast with Jack Buck and Brent Musburger.  In addition, the audio quality ranges from fair to poor--during the 7th inning of game one, it stops completely and does not pick up again until the bottom of the 7th, where it sounds even worse.

Still the video for games 1 and 2 isn't bad at all; each DVD opens with a disclaimer as to how the presentations reflect the quality of the existing materials, yet the problems that crop up on the first two discs are comparatively minor.  It would be nice if these presentations included the pre-game shows--player introductions and the national anthem--but they do not.

But the real problems with this set start with Games Three and Four.  The good news:  the WJR broadcasts with Ernie and Paul are available as a bonus audio track for games 3, 4 and 5, and the audio quality is outstanding---at least, I don't remember ever picking up WJR signal this clearly, and it was a 50,000-watt station.

The bad news--the quality of the video is jaw-droppingly poor.  The video source does not appear to be a broadcast master, but a poor dub from a VHS recording of the game.  NBC's on-screen graphics, which did not appear at all during the first two games, are now in evidence, but the picture is fuzzy, the picture rolls in spots and strobes in others, and worst of all--during the first inning of Game 3, the Scully/Garagiola NBC audio cuts out completely, and is replaced by...the Buck/Musberger radio call.  FOR THE NEXT TWO INNINGS.  Scully and Garagiola return during the top of the third inning (at the 52-minute mark of this 2:34 presentation, but Buck and Musberger audio is again substituted at the top of the 5th.

Also in my notes, I wrote:  ""Picture at the middle of the 4th is horrible beyond belief.""  The picture was blurring into ghost-like blobs, as though what I was watching was in the process of being chewed up by a top-loading Betamax.  I stopped noting such individual moments; suffice to say that Game 4 contained more of the same, although it never needed to fall back on any more Buck/Musburger audio.

Don't get me wrong--I'm not one of these people that yaks about ""artifacts"" and ""edge enhancement"" like I even know what that stuff is.  But when the clearest image on the screen is the MLB watermark in the upper right hand corner, I at least have to wonder why MLB thinks that anybody would want to bootleg such a crummy picture.

The Game 5 disc appears to essentially replicate the disc from ""Essential Games Of The Detroit Tigers"" (save for the menu); like that disc, it ends before the moment at the end of the game where Kirk Gibson was seen shoving a fan during the postgame on-field melee.

Here's the thing: I'm not sure I can blame A & E for this, to the extent that it is apparent that somebody, somewhere went to a certain amount of trouble to create the best presentation that they could with what they had.  All five games are essentially complete, albeit without any pre- or post-game coverage.

So I'm not sure if I should necessarily find fault with the discs, or instead with who--if anybody--was responsible for archiving these games in the first place.  Yes, these games were played twenty-nine years ago, but one would think that an archival copy of a national network television broadcast from 1984 would be in significantly better condition than this---this video plays more like a salvaged kinescope of a Boston Braves broadcast on the Dumont network.  I'm tempted to describe the quality of this video as ""bootleg quality"", but the fact of the matter is that bootleggers actually tend to put quite a bit more care into the reproduction and presentation of the material they are bootlegging---as with these World Series broadcasts, the ""Star Wars Holiday Special"" was broadcast exactly one time in the U.S., yet the circulating bootlegs are of Criterion Collection audio and video quality compared to this.

Did anybody within either MLB or NBC ever think to take measures to preserve the recordings of these broadcasts once the World Series had ended, or did both parties wrongly assume that the other party was taking appropriate preservation action?  Because, frankly, my concern really isn't with any Tigers fans who may or may not pick up this DVD set--my concern is that as I type this, these broadcasts are simply being left somewhere to deteriorate even further.  Lord knows I wouldn't expect the spineless car salesman lame-duck commissioner of baseball to do anything that might be described as doing ""something,"" but aren't there people in Cooperstown who take it upon themselves to archive and catalog something as significant as a World Series telecast?  Because what truly depresses me is that if this set is meant to represent the best existing/available video copies of the five games of the 1984 World Series; I shudder to think of how much other historic game footage--not from eighty or ninety years ago, but from twenty or thirty years ago--is simply being left to rot by those that control the rights to it.",1382227200,15,6953,4.748129675810474
8601379,5,B00E5G03GQ,This has been amazing to watch again.  Watched the entire series when I was stationed in Korea 84-85.  Thank you for selling it.  Loved hearing Mr. Scully and Mr. Garagiola again.  Those two are baseball announcing elite to me.,1486684800,,227,4.743589743589744

8601382,5,B00E5G03GQ,This is a great dvd set for all true Det Tiger fans. It takes me back to happier times for a young baseball fan. I remember listening to almost ever game on the radio after their 9-0 start. If you lived it you know how great this team was and they had a different hero every night. True champions and it was displayed by this 5 game World Series route. Nice effort and hats off to the Padres especially Kurt B. So many great moments for Tigers fans on this dvd series.,1446336000,,468,4.0978260869565215

8601385,4,B00E5G03GQ,"Very happy with this dvd. I was born in the mid 60s so do not have a problem with the picture quality of the 30 year old series. I was especially pleased that you can get the tv commentary as well as the local radio commentary depending on which city the game is played. It was wonderful to hear Ernie Harwell on the games played in Detroit.

My only slight complaint is that MLB didn't put some extras in this set. For example the 1986 NY Mets dvd is 9 discs with the full game 6 clincher of the NLCS v Astros. So one or two games from the 1985 ALCS would have been the icing on the cake for me!

There is a MLB watermark in the top right hand corner on the screen. I'm to intent in watching the action to really notice it. But yes it is there.",1416700800,2,745,3.9271523178807946
8601386,4,B00E5G03GQ,I loved to relive the magic when the Roar Returned in '84. This DVD series is only of the five World Series' games. The only negative was that I wished there would have been highlights of the regular season as well as the playoffs.,1414886400,3,231,4.2727272727272725
