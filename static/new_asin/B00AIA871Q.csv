5426123,3,B00AIA871Q,I love old B&W movies and Loretta Young.  If you're not a fan you might not enjoy this as much. Certainly seening it once is quite enough even for me so rent it but I won't buy it.,1432339200,,180,3.736842105263158
5426124,5,B00AIA871Q,"Loretta young & Franchot Tone the charming, almost powerful, couple. Henry Daniell, the perennial bad guy, who throws a monkey wrench in to their political ambitions with blackmail and murder. Roland young as the goofy but loyal best friend. E.E. Clive gets off some of the best one-liners you'll ever hear in a movie. Thoroughly entertaining.",1431216000,3,343,5.142857142857143

you keep watching.",1417132800,3,107,4.35
5426129,5,B00AIA871Q,The title nor the packaging do justice of what mystery this movie can bring to mystify your thoughts in who the murderer is and why it happened.  Unless your one to critically tear apart movies but are one like me who look for good story lines and acting I'd say go for it!  Enjoy!,1378252800,4,281,4.185185185185185
5426130,5,B00AIA871Q,"I saw this movie when a teenager and liked it very much.  Since then I have seen it several more times and have come to appreciate it more and more.  The interior design work is outstanding and Loretta Young's costumes were exceptional for the mid 1930's.  The location is supposedly London and the Dover.  I believe most of the filming was in and around Hollywood, but the movie staff selected areas very much like Dover and the London parks.

The movie plot is full of surprises and keeps one guessing to the very last scenes.  And the whole feel of the film is one of sophistication and elegance from a World just about to disappear with World War II.  I am very happy to have this film in my collection and have already watched it several times.",1361577600,14,749,4.423357664233577
5426131,4,B00AIA871Q,"""We all at times have our unguarded hour, when everything is against us."" On first impression, that observation seems to apply strictly to the murder trial of which ambitious London barrister, Sir Alan Dearden (Franchot Tone), is the lead prosecutor. Some details of the case: A man is accused of shoving his wife off the Dover cliffs. The accused claims that a witness can prove his innocence, except that this witness hasn't come forward. Dearden thinks it an open and shut case. It's anything but.

Sir Alan Dearden has got it all. He's happily married to the lovely Lady Helen (a glowing Loretta Young). Any minute now he anticipates an appointment as the next attorney general, a position for which he'd strived most of his life. But then, one evening, a self-confessed blackguard propositions Lady Helen with blackmail: Two thousand pounds or else he'll expose a series of compromising love letters her husband had written so indiscreetly in his youth. Lady Helen adores her husband. She knows a scandal would ruin his career. She acquiesces. She should've just reported the shakedown to her husband.

Instead, she follows the extortionist's directions. She takes her 2,000 to the rendezvous point, at the cliffs of Dover. The only other two people she sees are a husband and his wife. Can you put it together?

THE UNGUARDED HOUR, MGM's 1936 whodunit, steeps its two leads in elaborate skullduggery. Maybe you'll get a sense of how tangled this plot is when I mention that I hadn't even gotten as far as the story's central conflict. What happens after Lady Helen's capitulation to blackmail will jeopardize the Deardens' happiness and Sir Alan's very freedom. Sir Alan Dearden is noted for his cleverness. Can he extricate himself from a chain of evidence that incriminates him as a murderer? Torn between her husband and an innocent man bound for the gallows, can Lady Helen resolve her moral impasse? Roland Young steps in as the droll family friend, ""Bunny"" Jeffers. He promptly inserts foot in mouth. Roland Young is a riot in this one.

It's an expert cast that elevates what could have been a dull English drawing room whodunit. Special mention must go to supporting actor Henry Daniell who plays the extortionist with such slyness you're right away rooting against him. By virtue of her sharing top billing, I don't think Loretta Young can tecnically steal a scene. But she is superb, adding grace and beauty and gentility to the screen. Then only 23 years old, Young demonstrates an impressive command of her craft. Franchot Tone is also very good, especially in the second half of the film, when he launches into full-on evasive mode. ""The truth got you into this difficulty, and a lie will get you out,"" the head of Scotland Yard says to Dearden. What does that even mean? Why don't you see this movie and find out? Hint: It involves an unexpected twist at the end, and it concerns Dearden's alibi.",1361059200,8,2916,4.861167002012072

8552015,3,B00AIA871Q,"A good vehicle for Franchot Tone. . . fair for Loretta, though she has done much better than
this dramatically.  Fairly interesting plot, a bit plodding but well-enough directed. I'd give it a
cautionary three Stars, but after first half, it could have been better, in my opinion.",1454112000,,280,4.833333333333333
