5103062,5,B007PK88HA,"Survivor: Guatemala seems to be a fairly divisive season and I never understood why some people gave it such a bad rap. The location was unique and epic (the tribal council set was by far the best), the challenges were great and there were some brilliant new ones and the cast was one of the best. Although there are a few lower vis pre-merge boots, pretty much everyone who survived the first four episodes delivered in one way or another and gave us some great moments. Although it was the first season to implement the hidden immunity idol and the returning player twists which both became problems in later seasons, they both actually worked this time round. Overall, Guatemala is one of my favourites and one I think deserves better recognition as a top tier season. Hopefully the DVD can win it more fans and help people to appreciate it.",1333756800,24,844,4.633333333333334

(Not true anymore.) That hike through the jungle was absolutely brutal. Also, the winner was one of the most unlikely ever by the time they reached the merge.

Steff and Bobby Joe a champions and I hope to see them again in survivor somewhere down the road because they really added to the show a great deal. Another great survivor to watch and own on dvd.

5103081,1,B007PK88HA,"Hey everyone, guess what!! The winner of this show is...wait, you don't want to know, and neither do I. Too bad. Every season they plaster the winner's picture on the cover of the DVD, so that at a single glance, the mystery's over!! Who thought that this was a good idea?! It seems like the worst idea in the world. Simple fix. Put the whole cast on the cover. There, problem solved! My solution is to never look at the cover when I buy the DVD--just open it and flip it upside down. The people in charge of the cover designs--please fire them now. The best reality show ever with the worst DVD covers ever.",1394496000,6,608,4.2956521739130435

5103094,4,B007PK88HA,"1/28/14. We just finished watching Guatemala (season 11) for the 1st time. 1st off, we absolutely love Survivor! I am glad(and thankful to CBS) that the seasons we missed are now available. I am, however, somewhat disappointed & surprised in the quality of the picture. IMO, it is not up to today's standards - I would compare it to VHS quality. The close-ups are fine but anything else sorts of sucks...I don't understand? For the fan, it isn't bad enough to keep you from  purchasing, but be warned, this is far from being HD...Distance shots are blurry. Note: we watch on an 82"" screen so it might be less noticeably bad on a 50"" TV... So because of the somewhat crappy video quality, but still being the uber & thankful fan, I give this manufactured on demand set a 4 star rating. Btw, we had zero playback issues whatsoever. Also, the set comes in one large ""standard"" DVD case that's hinged holding the 5 discs.

The bonus features are CBS This Morning interviews. These are one on one studio interviews w/  with voted out players the next morning after that episode aired, way back when. FYI, one of the interviewers - I don't know her name(the black woman), we found to be extremely rude and very ignorant about the show. To us, she came off as a ""b"" word...We ended up stop watching the interviews - Parvati's Aftershow is a million times better... but at least there are some bonus features - no Ponderosa. Also, The Reunion Show is included.

I was going to lower my rating to 3 stars because I read some reviews on here saying that each disc has pictures on that disc of who was getting voted off on that disc's episodes! Obviously,  this would ruin any hope of suspense...,which is extremely stupid and BS! So w/ this knowledge, I secretly made my wife put each disc in the DVD player so I wouldn't know who was getting voted off before watching. BUT it turns, out that my discs DO NOT HAVE ANY FACE PICTURES ON THEM. I hope(Amazon & CBS!!!) this will be the case with the other seasons we still need to purchase, ehem.

So despite the sub par video quality, I still highly recommend this set and season, Guatemala, for fans of the show who perhaps started out late like we did and need to catch up on old seasons or just need that ""fix"" in between current seasons. Guatemala is a very good season and they did have different rules back then - a final two, for example.

 Note, we didn't start watching Survivor until season 12 and haven't missed an episode since. Prior to that, we have either rented from Netflix or Blockbuster and we're now purchasing what wasn't available for rent - seasons 3,4,5,6 and 11 - the 11th being our first purchase and only retail set we have watched. We did try a ebay bootleg copy of season 11 but was basically unwatchable - save your money...",1390867200,,2791,4.480314960629921
5103095,5,B007PK88HA,"Survivor Guatemala Was A Great Season From Start To Finish. Each Episode Was Very Entertaining To Watch! You Had 2 Returning Contestants (Stephenie And Bobby Jon), Young Guys passing Out From Dehydration On The First Day Of The Competition, Epic Meltdowns, Dangerous Surroundings, A Smoking Hot Winner ( Dani), Hidden ImmIunity Idols Came Into Play, Two Of The Biggest Underdogs Survivor Has Ever Seen Almost Win (Rafe And Lydia), And A Former NFL Player That Tried To Keep His Identity Hidden From His Tribe Only To Be Outed By Another Contestant (Gary).

5103128,5,B007PK88HA,Best Survivor episode!  Took a long time for this one to come out. I have followed survivor since the begining,1356134400,,110,4.5
5103129,5,B007PK88HA,"Survivor Guatemala is the last season of the old school era of Survivor (Borneo-here). When this aired I enjoyed it, but it became meh in my opinion later on. Having rewatched it, recently this is the 2nd time a Survivor season has turned out to be much better the 2nd time around.

This season was a good one. The location was different and looked A LOT harder to survive in. The challenges were intense and almost all of them seemed to be difficult. The tribe dynamics were great before and after the tribe switch, which pleased me as I felt most previous switches hurt the season for a while. Everyone was interesting to watch, even those who had no shot to win. Once again the game felt like it was hard to just get by, making the season more exciting. The merge had great blindsides and decision making, it was more like what the group was thinking, not just tribal lines. The winner was a good deserving winner, although like with the Amazon I feel the more deserving people, that seemed to be in control the whole season, came up short.

Having viewed this season and being reminded of how good oldschool Survivor was, it really begs the question ""Why change the game so much?"" This season had everything that old school Survivor was good for and was surprisingly awesome to watch, why add the HII's after this great season and vertually stop the final 2? But I'm just a reviewer with an opinion.

A good way to cap off old school Survivor that many Survivor fans grew up with, and one season that deserves a spot on my shelf.",1355097600,,1533,4.4678571428571425
5103130,5,B007PK88HA,Another favorite show and so happy to have this one added to my collection.  Thanks again for the quick turn around,1354752000,,115,4.476190476190476

5103132,4,B007PK88HA,"In true Survivor fashion this series did not disappoint to entertain and thrill me.  This was a truely gruelling venue with 2 of the toughest survivors from the past, Bobby John and Stephanie Lagrossa put themselves on the line mentoring and competing with a new field of players. Stephanie rocks and nearly takes it out.",1348099200,,321,4.836363636363636
5103133,5,B007PK88HA,"Seriously one of the most epic and underrated seasons in Survivor history. I love the createspace dvd sets and recommend them to any Survivor fan or new viewers.

5103135,2,B007PK88HA,with stephanie and bobby john returning you wil have familiar faces. This is better than the previous season since both tribes win some and lose some instead of one tribe completely dominating.

5103136,2,B007PK88HA,I had to return this item for another cause it would freeze up and sometimes it wouldn't even load. When I got the replacement it did the smae thing. I returned it also for a replacement and again it did the same thing. So I returned it had got  my money back. I really wanted this for my collection. But none of them would work right. But I still have to say Amazon was very good about the returns and the refund. I will continue to use them for other purchases,1342569600,,462,4.076923076923077
5103167,3,B007PK88HA,"Unfortunately, this review is the same as my review on Survivor Panama-Exile Island.  Again, I love the Survivor shows, but the quality of this dvd was awful.  Numerous sound problems and interruptions or pauses in playback on all discs.  I ordered this dvd set and the Survivor Panama-Exile Island set at the same time and they both have the same problems.  Again, none of the other Survivor dvd sets that I own have these problems, some of which were ordered from Amazon and some from other places.  I think the quality of the workmanship and materials has gone downhill dramatically and, since it is my understanding that Amazon creates these dvds themselves, then the problem is theirs and something they need to correct.",1341360000,5,725,4.861788617886178

5103169,5,B007PK88HA,"Personally, I believe that Survivor is the best season and the dvd is awesome.  The behind the scenes footage is worth the price of the dvd alone!!!  As in the cast, this season has the most diverse Survivors from different parts of the USA!!  Bringing back Bobby Jon and Stephenie was a great addition, but this cast definately would have been able to carry this season without them!!!  The standouts......Lydia, Brandon, Gary, Cindy, Judd, Cindy, Jamie, Rafe,.....there really isn't anyone that is boring!!!  I really cannot see why this cast outside of Bobby Jon and Stephenie has not returned for any additional seasons.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Survivor-Guatemala-2005/dp/B007PK88HA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Survivor Guatemala (2005)</a>",1339891200,,794,6.314814814814815

5103172,5,B007PK88HA,"I'm not sure why Guatemala seems to get a bad rep among some fans of the show. The location was truly original, the cast was great, there was enough strategy to satisfy, and even though there were returning players, they weren't so domineering as to make the game completely uninteresting (as in the past few seasons where they've brought back returning players). I've always counted this season as one of my favorites. It was one of the few peak seasons in Survivor history before the show started to go downhill in terms of strategy and casting.

Like I said, the location here is amazing. I can't recall another season where the tribes were situated on a lake in actual ruins. Furthermore, the weather was brutal! This isn't a season where you see multiple people lazing around on a beach all day working on their sun tans. The tribal council set was pretty awesome too.

The casting was brilliant. From Brandon with his charming southern twang to Judd with his larger than life, booming personality and that classic accent to sweet, gentle Rafe and Lydia's pancake dance. And who can forget ""Golden Boy's"" wonderful stories? Well, maybe he was a bit of an airhead, but this cast was full of personalities that really didn't disappoint. A few people didn't stand out much, but the other personalities more than make up for it. Everyone's personalities were so well picked; it made for great gameplay.

As for strategy, I won't reveal any major blindsides or backstabbing that occurred during this season, but I will say this - it definitely wasn't boring. This isn't a season where you can pinpoint who the winner will be early on.

I really don't know what more to ask for in a Survivor season. This one was and still is one of my favorite seasons. And having watched every single one of them multiple times, that is saying something.",1337817600,11,1838,4.716510903426792
5103173,5,B007PK88HA,"So this review is not for Survivor or the Series. Fact is if you are buying Survivor season's you know what they entail. I'm reviewing the product that amazon creates. I am doing this because personally I was a little hesitant buying a product that amazon actually produces when it is ordered.

Great news, the set is awesome. It comes in a single case that is small and fits better than some of the big book sets other companies produce. So far I have made it through 5 disks and had literally no problems. Picture is clear and I have not noticed any skipping that other reviewers on these products noted. The Sound quality is that of most DVD's these days. Overall I have no complaints. If you are hesitant in buying this product because it is being crafted by amazon, have no fears. It's a great product and also a great way to support the series to make sure further seasons are also available to enjoy for year to come. Buy with Confidence.

Edit: I should also add that these packages come with some great extras that Studio DVD releases don't even offer. On every disk you have special features that include the daily show interviews with the castmates at they are voted out. A true perk for the everyday Survivor fans.",1337817600,7,1226,4.493273542600897
