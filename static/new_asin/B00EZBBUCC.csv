5958440,5,B00EZBBUCC,"There were many things which I enjoyed about this film.  I first caught it at its NY Premiere.  The script was very intriguing because it told the story of Roberto's life in 21 different segments which I found unique.  Along with that, it provided what many movies today are lacking, it told a story, it developed the characters of Roberto and the people around him.  As a huge Pirates fan, it was a can't miss for me.  However, even if you were unfamiliar with the story of Roberto Clemente and his life, you would enjoy this.",1378425600,9,527,4.447916666666667
5958441,5,B00EZBBUCC,"I first saw the movie at the premier showing in Pittsburgh. I especially enjoyed the live performance of the Clemente Theme Song by director and awesome guitarist, Richard Rossi (song now on YouTube at http://youtu.be/vgfSM8-C7xA ).  Die-hard baseball fans will enjoy this film.  I was an avid baseball card collector and faithful Pirate fan back in the 60's yet I didn't know most of the historical facts that were presented in this film. It's no wonder the audience at the Strand Theater erupted spontaneously in applause when the movie was over. This DVD is a must-have collectors item for those of us who loved Clemente.",1378339200,9,624,4.933333333333334
5958442,5,B00EZBBUCC,Went to see this movie in Pittsburgh and thought it was well done and showed the loved Rich Rossi had for Clemente. Some humor and tears and told the complete story.  5 stars for you Rich. Just sent the DVD off to your friend.,1378339200,9,226,4.136363636363637
5958443,5,B00EZBBUCC,"So when my sports-fanatic boyfriend wanted to watch a baseball movie... I agreed, as I'm from the Pittsburgh area and Clemente is such a huge icon there.  This movie really surprised me though because it not only showcased Roberto's baseball talent - which is unlike anything I've ever seen!! But it also told the overall story of his life, his marriage, and humanitarianism efforts, which I personally thought was more the point of the movie :-). You can really see why he is such a big star and its not just for baseball...very inspirational and a great film!!!!!!",1378339200,9,566,4.775510204081633
5958444,5,B00EZBBUCC,"This movie is a homerun!  I was proud to have been able to screen this in NY for many great fans!  All came dressed in uniform.  People came out in a mixture of applause and tears.  Majority of them saying thank you for the experience!

5958451,2,B00EZBBUCC,I love Clemente so I will stay away from a 1 but what an awful movie. Someone needs to make a real movie with a real budget and real actors. This looks like a high school project.,1414368000,,179,3.864864864864865

5958458,5,B00EZBBUCC,RICHARD ROSSI DID A FINE JOB IN GIVING US THE SPIRITUALITY BEHIND BASEBALL HALL OF FAME GREAT ROBERTO CLEMENTE. HE ALSO UN RAVELS THE HIDDEN MEANING BEHIND THE NUMBER 21. MUST SEE.,1409270400,2,180,4.65625
5958459,3,B00EZBBUCC,"While anyone can critique this film, first off, at least it got made; so Rossi and crew get credit for that. No one else has made a life story film about Clemente, why, I don't know since his life and death are ready made for a major motion picture. This film is more home made style or semi professional at best. All the parts are there and even lots of the players and family are represented fairly accurately if not two dimensionally. I liked the ideas of 21 stories, though did not get the numbering system used. The actors did the best they could but this kind of set up is hard to pull off even for Hollywood. All in all it was a bit painful to watch, artistic wise, but the history is played out well and the main parts are there. I commend Rossi and crew for making it happen. I am a long time Pirate and Clemente fan from the 60s though I lived in San Francisco, so anything about this is all good for me. The player is dead, long live Clemente.",1408147200,,954,4.134408602150538

5958463,1,B00EZBBUCC,"This video is so full of inaccuracies it was unbelievable.  A disgrace to be associated with the name Clemente.
A total waste of money and time viewing.",1397347200,3,152,4.62962962962963
5958464,4,B00EZBBUCC,"Roberto was and is still one of the very best players to ever play the game. As a 10 year old kid in Los Angeles,CA he was my favorite player, and the thrill of my life was to meet him and spend 30mins with him. I will never forget those 30mins he gave me to play catch and talk to him.",1393891200,9,286,3.7049180327868854
5958465,1,B00EZBBUCC,"My son and I have been looking forward to this movie since we found out it was coming out.  Even though he is only 12, he has been a huge fan of Clemente since reading a book about him several years ago.  He can't get enough of anything to do with Roberto Clemente.  As a baseball fan and admirer of Clemente, I have encouraged this.  We were both disgusted by the way Roberto was portrayed.

For those of you who stopped watching after 15 or 20 minutes, don't feel bad.  It didn't get any better.  I wish it had.  I don't care how low the budget was.  That is not what is wrong with this film.",1388361600,4,594,4.051724137931035
5958466,1,B00EZBBUCC,"I was very up-set with the movie . The story itself was OK. Background was bad. Nothing like the Jackie Robinson's story. (both Movies) or *61.

Its sexy to be a Pirate fan again!

the acting is good. great for a small budget film",1385078400,8,131,3.814814814814815
5958468,5,B00EZBBUCC,I was a big Roberto Clemente fan as a child.  He was not only an amazing athlete but also a truly altruistic person.  This film is a great tribute to his life accomplishments and character.  It tells the story of his life in a beautiful and creative way.  The love story of he and his wife was really touching.  I learned so many interesting facts about his life from this film.  I would recommend this film to my family and friends!,1383609600,8,433,4.283950617283951
5958469,1,B00EZBBUCC,"I saw this movie at its premier in Pittsburgh.  In fact the man responsible for this project introduced the movie.  Although he is a passionate fan of Roberto Clemente and his movie, he is in no way a film maker.  I took my son and two grandsons who are die-hard Pittsburgh Pirate fans to see it.  We, as well as the entire audience, walked out of the theatre in shock.  There are not enough words to describe how poorly this movie was made.  In fact, it was so awful, it was funny.  We ended up laughing about it all during lunch.  I agree that the good reviews should not be believed.  I plan to purchase the American Experience: Roberto Clemente, a PBS production, also available on Amazon, for my grandsons.  I have no doubt that a PBS production will give them a better prospective of Roberto Clemente, the baseball player and humanitarian.",1383609600,7,845,4.5
5958470,5,B00EZBBUCC,"I was blessed to be a part of the film's screening in Los Angeles. I am not a huge baseball fan, but I became lost in the story of Roberto Clemente. His story is one of true love, passion, self-sacrifice, and using the gifts God has given for a greater purpose. I left the screening with a deeper understanding of what it means
to lay down one's life for another and captivated by God's love for us. This film is truly creative art,  inspired by the love of God and a passion to share the life of Roberto Clemente. I also enjoyed the actual footage of Roberto's game interwoven in the film which for me brought Roberto to life. I highly recommend this film.",1383436800,11,657,4.298387096774194
5958471,5,B00EZBBUCC,Great buy! I hope the movie turns blockbuster. Clemente was an awesome man. Wish there were more movies like this.,1383091200,8,114,4.75
5958472,5,B00EZBBUCC,"Maybe `Fiercely' Incredible film isn't the proper way to label this film. Yet it is fierce in that it has the potential to turn around one's life on a dime and turn one's life around for positive influence for others. It strikes at the heart of racism while still entertaining. In this age of corporate greed, one man stands out to sacrifice himself. I can't tell you more. You need to buy this film and tell others. John McCormick [...]",1383004800,8,437,4.475
5958473,2,B00EZBBUCC,"So I bought this movie based of a radio show where the writer/producer/director was interviewed by a local radio station in SF. Everyone in the interview was raving about the acting and the story line. The movie looks poorly made. Little to no production value. Actors seemed inexperienced and the cinematography was very elementary. I am a huge baseball fan and I am very familiar with Clemente's story even thought it was taking place well before I was old enough to really appreciate his career. All that said, The story that is told is accurate by all accounts and that is why I gave it two stars. If you were just going to base it off of entertainment value I think I'd leave no stars.

  Bottom line - It looks like a high school theater group put it together.",1382918400,4,766,4.496402877697841
5958474,5,B00EZBBUCC,The book was purchased as a gift and the person who recieved it was thrilled.  A great book for those of us who remember Clemente.,1382918400,9,130,4.2
5958475,5,B00EZBBUCC,"I was actually pleasantly surprised that this was a movie, not a documentary. Shortly after Roberto Clemente died,  I read that a movie was being planned, but one never came out.  This movie was obviously made by people who revere Roberto as much as I do.
It captured the spirituality and altruistic nature of the man, demonstrating that he was not only a hero on the playing field, but off the field as well. This movie was obviously a labor of love.  I was very touched by it.  I would recommend this movie to baseball fans and to young people who idolize sports figures to show them the characteristics of a true hero.",1382918400,9,621,4.469026548672566
5958476,1,B00EZBBUCC,It was so bad that I bought a copy to my son and I will not give it to him. I stopped watching it I could not finished it!!,1382745600,3,123,3.2758620689655173
5958477,1,B00EZBBUCC,"Do not but htis DVD, it was a slap in the face to one of the greatest humanitarians to ever live, the second rate actors , I take that back, 4th rate , this was a horrible depiction of Roberto Clemente, I through the disc in the garbage, I would stay away, it is a real joke....",1382400000,3,278,3.8947368421052633
5958478,1,B00EZBBUCC,"I am not sure if I watched the same movie that others reviewed.  I thought this would be a professionally done movie about the life of one of my childhood hero's.  I sat down to watch it with my 12 year old son and the first comment out of his mouth was, ""Dad this is like the camp movies"".  My reply, ""Nom, this is worse than the camp movies"".  The sound was awful, the filming was awful, the camera angles were obviously shot so that no one would have to work on scenery.  Oh, and the acting was awful.  I am not one to make reviews, but this really was the worst movie that I have ever watched, and I felt like I was duped into buying this. We ended up fast forwarding through the movie to watch the few real clips of Roberto.  I would have paid for a movie of nothing but old interviews and game clips of Roberto, but this was a rip off. If I could have rated it a 0, i would have. Please don't waste your time or your money.",1382313600,6,929,3.9623655913978495
5958479,1,B00EZBBUCC,"The acting was very poor, and the facts questionable. It starts by saying that Roberto Clemente was an immigrant when in fact Roberto was US citizen born in Puerto Rico, USA (US protectorate) From there just got worst with the dialog. If you are a Roberto Clemente fan you will be very disapointed and if you want to know who Roberto Clemente was i don't recommend this as a factual video. Doesn't show who he was as a player or as a person.",1382227200,8,441,4.325301204819277
5958480,1,B00EZBBUCC,I grew up a huge Clemente fan. The storyline was okay. I couldn't tell if the acting was just average because the video footage and quality was sub par. It seem more like a college or high school project. I was so disappointed that I tossed in the trash.,1382140800,6,254,4.204081632653061
5958481,5,B00EZBBUCC,It was a good movie and a good story. The acting was really good and the actor Chuck Hoyes was great. I love the movie. You got to see it.,1382140800,8,138,3.6333333333333333
5958482,1,B00EZBBUCC,I am a big Roberto Clemente fan and a have a real big collections to all the respect this is a pice of junk I have better movies that this poor movie if you going to make this poor don't make at all,1381363200,6,198,3.627906976744186
5958483,5,B00EZBBUCC,"I am not into watching baseball or any sports for that matter, but Clemente  was in my Dad's time and he loved baseball so I watched it for him since he is no longer with me to watch it. He would have so enjoyed this movie...I did very much. I enjoyed learning about Clemente's  life. What a true sincere person he was. We need more men like him.

Richard Rossi did a great job sharing Clemente's story. To think he made this movie on a very limited budget....all I can say is hats off to you Richard! I was blessed watching this movie!",1381017600,11,536,4.184466019417476
5958484,5,B00EZBBUCC,"I was very touched by this movie. Things that Roberto Clemente cared about the most are beautifully and poetically portrayed. It is not an easy task to make a film about Roberto Clemente on a limited budget and I think that director Richard Rossi did and outstanding job in doing it. I laughed and I cried while watching the film. The story of Clemente's faith in Jesus Christ is very powerful because it is subtle and true.  This film is heartfelt, motivating  and encouraging and I strongly recommend it, especially to young people who are seeking for role-models.",1380585600,11,566,4.76530612244898
5958485,5,B00EZBBUCC,"Hope is a rarity these days.  So, whenever we find it we must nurture it as one would an orphan. Inspiration is the vital spark that ignites hope. When Richard came to my class and showed his film and talked to my children what I saw was hope, was a man following his vision, and sharing the possibility that my chidden could do the same.

The vehicle for both of these virtues was Richard's ""Baseball's Last Hero: 21 Clemente Stories"". This is a story that is more than necessary, rather is absolutely vital for this time that we live in. I watched the eyes of my children as they watched the brilliant retelling of the story of this vital humanitarian and superlative baseball player. I saw scales of media propaganda and false value fall away as they watched the story of a baseball superstar who was first a human being - a person who lived to help others, and in the end made the supreme sacrifice.

I felt proud to be a teacher, proud to know Richard, proud to have brought such a wonderfully hopeful and inspiring tale into my classroom. Every great undertaking has flaws, blemishes of budget, shortcomings in fealty to 'objective reality.'  But I believe that we live by the laws of the love of a universe that honors risk-taking, that honors bravery in sacrifice, that honors a man's passion for the idols of his childhood. In the end, I think Richard's movie is an allegory. I believe it informs us about how to be and strive to be our best selves, and while that threatens some, and may have financial and even personal costs, it is what love would have us be.

My classroom filled with hope and inspiration on that late summer day, when through the windows streamed light, and from the screen filled awe-inspiring beauty.  I hope everyone gets in on the secret that Richard was bold enough to engage. I hope that the cynicism that tells us that we are separate and need to fear one another melts like ice in the late summer sun.

See the movie, remember what it was like to be young and to have dreams, to have mentors that said 'yes' to our notions that we could change the world by being ourselves in it.

5958487,5,B00EZBBUCC,"Baseball's Last Hero:21 Clemente Stories is what it says it is, it is a unique retelling of the events of Roberto Clemente's life. It is bringing attention once again to the life
Roberto lived and to his value as a leader in society. It is a story that has been told using the resources that were available at that time ( it is an ""Indy"" film ). It is a celebration of who Roberto was, it is not meant to be seen as the definitive description of every aspect of his life. That isn't possible in a 90 minute film. As one of the 2 Director's of Photography on this film I can say unequivocally that I enjoyed working on it and that I worked many long hours and spent my own money on equipment, travel, resources and sustenance. I would hope that the greatest value this film has will be in bringing new people to the understanding of who Roberto Clemente was. I have enjoyed watching this story as much as I enjoyed working on it!",1380153600,9,928,4.248587570621469
5958488,1,B00EZBBUCC,I was excited about this DVD because I'm a lifelong Clemente and Pirates fan. It was a bad movie with bad acting. In one scene there is graffiti on the dugout wall from 2012 yet the scene is set in the 1970's. Even the Clemente and Pirate clips are a video of somebody's TV screen. I was actually uncomfortable watching this and therefor I wouldn't recommend it at all. ESPN had a great documentary about 10 years ago and that kind of quality was what I expected. I wish I could get a refund!,1380067200,13,492,4.24468085106383
5958489,1,B00EZBBUCC,"Roberto Clemente is my hero. I saw him play many times at Shea stadium,his 1971 World Series is the finest post season performance I have yet seen. He was,by all accounts ,except for some noted exceptions like Elroy Face,a better man of the field then on.which brings us to this travesty.the facts are wrong,the uniforms are from 1970,not 1955, the geography is wrong(the dodger nd giants were stil in NYC in 1955)murtaugh was not the manager when Clemnte broke in.the quality looks like a cheap home made film,with wooden acting,bad sets,etc. The Clemente family cooperated with this?surprising. I think it is produced by some evangelical church. There is an excellent Clemente doc done and is readily available. This is a waste of time,energy money.",1379980800,8,751,5.064516129032258
5958490,1,B00EZBBUCC,"When I read the reviews here on Amazon, I ordered this dvd right away.  After watching about 15 minutes, I stopped the movie and came back here to see what was going on.  Did anyone give it a negative review?  Did everyone love it?  No way.  As of today, there's only one negative review (until mine is posted).

I'm sorry, this movie is horrible.  It's homemade at best.  I'm a HUGE Clemente fan, so it wouldn't take a lot to please me, but seriously.  Like the other reviewer says, there are errors, and second of all, the acting is so bad I couldn't finish it.  The costumes are really bad too.

I'll try watching more sometime later, but it was too bad to finish in one sitting. Don't trust all these five star reviews.",1379894400,27,723,4.32089552238806
5958491,2,B00EZBBUCC,I was pretty pumped to check this out (based on some of the reviews). After watching the first ten minutes or so I was pretty baffled. The year is 1955 and they're talking about Los Angeles and San Francisco? Then he's introduced to manager Danny Murtaugh? Murtaugh didn't manage the Pirates until 1958. The author/director doesn't have a clue about Clemente and his history. I certainly hope he's not using Clemente's good name for a money grab. I thought I read non-profit somewhere. I certainly hope so. No one deserves to profit off of this shabby effort and tremendous lack of research. I'll attempt to continue watching and hope it gets better.,1379462400,9,650,4.8125
5958492,5,B00EZBBUCC,"I was really pleasantly surprised and relieved at the quality of this movie.  I know it was a very low budget undertaking and I was afraid it would not to Roberto justice.  Well it did.  It was a well crafted, well acted, story about Roberto's life both personal and his career.  I'll never forget how sad and lost I felt when I got the news his plane had crashed.  I had the same feelings all over again watching this movie, but I'm glad that someone finally told this man's story.  He was baseball's last hero and he deserves a movie outlining his achievements.  I hope that through this movie many other American's will see his greatness and come to love and admire the man the way we did in Pittsburgh.",1379116800,12,706,4.384615384615385
5958493,5,B00EZBBUCC,"I just watched the movie at home after I bought it from Amazon. Thanks Richard Rossi for making it available to us. The movie is truly a gem. It proves one more time that you don't need a huge budget and high paid known actors to create a movie that touches you from beginning to end. Through 21 unique short stories, very wisely and creatively tied together like pieces of a puzzle creating a beautiful final picture, the movie tells a real story that makes you think, makes you laugh, makes you cry and above all makes you to realize what a man Roberto was. The player, the father, the husband, the teammate, the humble man, the ""jibaro"", you can see Roberto as a complete God's child. I had the pleasure to see Roberto various times and met and talked to him in person during (what else) a little league baseball series sponsored by him in Puerto Rico. He was like that. We can all identify through his eyes and accomplishments.
Congratulations to all the staff, producers, directors, and associates that with sacrifices and hard work produced this movie for the present and the future. Job Well Done!

8610763,1,B00EZBBUCC,"Wow, with all due respect to the makers of this film, this is one of the worst films I've ever seen. I appreciate and respect anyone who tries to make a film. It's not an easy thing to pull off. But in spite of that sentiment, this film was imho at best imho on a level of a high school class project. The actors seemed sincere and game and probably the film's creators too, but it is just a very poor result when you're asking people to pay their hard earned money to see it, imho.",1490054400,,482,4.03125

I sat it down and somehow, neglected to watch it...until yesterday. I was all excited, I felt like I had found a lost $100 bill...that lasted until I began watching this POS. Terrible title/intro song/singer...laughable to be honest...I immediately suspected something bad was coming. Unfortunately, I was spot on. The actors, screenplay, set, production value...all horrible...worst ever. Just AWFUL!!  UNWATCHABLE!!! This thing makes the old 60's Japanese monster movies look like Academy Award winners. I turned it off after 5 minutes and then I literally threw it in the trash. Richard Rossi should be taken out and horse whipped for charging $$$ to view this crap. I honestly cannot believe that some people have given this ""lower-than-low-budget-dog-poop-fest"" a positive rating.  If you are a Clemente fan...If you are a movie fan....DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO...YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED.",1470614400,2,1007,5.248447204968944

I hope I can get a refund.",1469923200,,94,3.8947368421052633
8610766,5,B00EZBBUCC,"This movie was from the perspective of an individual who grew up as a fan and really appreciated the ""good"" side of Clemente and gives the viewer a positive experience. I thought the acting was great and it was a very enjoyable view for me! Give it a shot as this movie is not from the ""Hollywood Machine"". I look forward to viewing other works by the creator and actors.",1454976000,,371,4.314285714285714

THIS is not a well produced movie. Hack job at best. Details are WAY off.  Action scenes are a joke...looks like a HS movie project. If you are a baseball fan and if you are a Clemente fan you will be very disappointed. The fact that I paid for this pains me.",1453939200,2,403,4.302631578947368

8610771,1,B00EZBBUCC,I grew up worshiping Roberto and I was so excited to watch this movie until it began. Simply one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Low budget badly edited and with a weird narrative. I cant cretinism the acting because the script is so bad I do not know what is worst.,1435363200,2,272,4.055555555555555
