A fantastic sound track, story which will keep you on the edge of your seat and great characters.
in my eyes this anime ranks against others in my collection which are top notch (bubblegum crisis, 3*3 eyes and DBZ)
a must see anime, the only fault with this video is that you just don't get enough, so go ahead and get the box set, go on treat yourself
i promise you will no regret it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11",1017100800,,499,4.319148936170213
7913385,5,B00000JSIL,"This is the best anime i have ever seen. A must buy for any anime fan. There is a little violence so not for young kids, but you will be impressed.",987465600,,147,3.774193548387097
7913386,5,B00000JSIL,"I spent a weekend watching the entire series, from beginning to end, and it was time well spent. The animation is breathtaking, the stories are very entertaining and the action is fast and furious.
If you like Anime, then Cowboy Beebop is a must-see and is so good that it must be seen to be believed.",984787200,,301,4.392857142857143
7913387,5,B00000JSIL,"Spike and Jet are just two cowboys who aren't as good as others. In our first fantastic episode, we find a conspiracy involving Red Eyes (or Bloody Eyes. Damn dubbing writers). The theme of it is that of Tiawana. The chase scenes and action was on a very high level and it nevers slows down. In the next episode, we meet Ein. A cute and cuddly Welsh Corgi. Well, atleast to Jet. On the black market hes only worth 2 woolongs, but for some reason its worth a lot to some scientist and a huge guy with cool afro. The most fun you will have with this tape is during the chase scenes which are toned to great music of saxaphone, drums and any other instuments you can think of. The dub is done extremely well. Overall, if you have to get one tape from the Bebop series, get this one. It has the most action, the most chase scenes and beautiful camera work. There is no reason not to see this one. Buy it now.",981763200,,904,4.142045454545454
7913388,5,B00000JSIL,"What would have happened if Quinn Martin Productions, the guys who brought to you those oh so hip 70's cop dramas, had done a sci-fi show? The Answer: ""Cowboy Bepop"".  Cowboy Bebop is a swift kick to the head to those who think that anime is limited to ""Pokemon"" and ""Dragonball Z"".  Bounty hunters, mad bombers, ecoterrorists, drug dealers, con artists, the mafia and a villain that looks like Woody Allen gone bad, just when you thought you've had enough this show screams at you that you haven't seen anything yet.",980640000,,517,4.670329670329671
7913389,5,B00000JSIL,"For those of you familiar with traditional anime now is the time to be  amazed. Not only does Bebop set up excellent episodes, it has also  redefined the what Japanese cartoons represent.
Produced by the same  people who created ""The Vision of Escaflowne"" (Bones), Cowboy  Bebop brings a slightly more Western feel, with a more subtle sense of  humour and as I hinted above, excellent writing. In my opinion Bebop is an  excellent choice for anybody interested in Japanese anime, whether an avid  fan or just a inquisitive fool (such as myself), on par with such great  titles as ""The Vision of Escaflowne"", ""Nadesico"", and  ""Rurouni Kenshin"".  This title has given the industry a much  needed injection of creativity into what I saw as an industry that was  beginning to get stale and formulaic.
If I have enticed you into  purchasing this video, please read on. Do not buy the videotape if you own,  or think that you will be purchasing a DVD player (or like me, waiting for  PS2 to arrive in October). Two very simple reasons. First and most commonly  the case is quality. Picture quality is sharper and there is the option of  watching both the subtitled and dubbed version. I like this option as I  like to see how badly they botch the dubbed version. The second and more  important reason is that buying the DVD is actually cheaper. Yes, I  understand that this may seem counter-intuitive but it is true. The DVD  version has 5 episodes on one disc at about $26, while the VCR version only  has 2 episodes for a whopping $21 (subtitled of course). This is weird but  do take advantage of it. In fact the savings could be sufficient for you to  purchase a player!
Hence I hope to see Cowboy Bebop as a top ten DVD  seller in months to come.",968198400,,1745,4.533762057877814

7913391,5,B00000JSIL,"A hybrid of jazz music, noir atmosphere, ""Blade Runner""-esque design and sleek high-speed action, ""Cowboy Bebop"" is hand down the best anime series currently runnning. Instead of music that seems like  background noise, Bebop's jazz jumps out and contributes to a scene rather  than detracts from it. It tells the story of two bounty hunters -- Spike  and Jet -- who travel across the galaxy, trying to bring fugitives to  justice ... so they can collect the reward, natch.
You can't beat  ""Cowboy Bebop"" and if you want to know the best anime Japan is  producing right now, look no further.
This is IT!",952905600,2,603,4.75
