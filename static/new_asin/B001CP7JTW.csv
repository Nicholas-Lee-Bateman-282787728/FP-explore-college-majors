3515563,5,B001CP7JTW,"When I saw the whole sesion two released on dvd for the first time, it was a no-brainer that I was going to buy it. This is the last great sesion of digimon. Unforgettable anime series, both sesions 1 and 2 gets really good in the later episodes. DVDs LOOKS REALLY GOOD ON YOUR TV. I DON'T CARE HOW OLD YOU ARE. YOU MUST HAVE THIS BOX-SET!",1217203200,2,339,4.074626865671642
3515564,3,B001CP7JTW,"I love digimon and I really don't care that this is a bootleg. I LOVE DIGIMON, that said I was very impressed by the season 1 boxset, but this one doesn't deliver in the audio department. It sounds like an old mono radio, it's really taking me out of the show. Alas, it is digimon, and I LOVE DIGIMON. Sorry, can't say that enough.",1266278400,2,331,4.1875
3515565,1,B001CP7JTW,"Unfortunately, this (and other Digimon releases from Alliance Entertainment) is a bootleg.  What you're buying here are DVDs burned by some guys that downloaded them off the Internet.  The license to Digimon is currently owned by Disney...which is why it airs on ABC Family (owned by Disney) often.  Disney does not license out their titles to be distributed on DVD by other companies.

Save your money and do not buy this.",1256515200,3,423,4.915492957746479
3515566,5,B001CP7JTW,"Digimon Season 2 takes place several years after the first Season. All of the original digi-destined except Kari and TK
take a lesser role in the series (the others have become mentors in a sense). Story starts out with the Digital World being
controlled by a ruthless emperor. Without spoiling the series, Season 2 is a highly recommended followup to the original that ties in events from Season 1 perfectly. The set itself has a really cool case and all the eps are in good quality. I originally purchased seasons one & two from Amazon (marketplace sellers) for a fairly steep price, but saved money on the other seasons through ToonJunkie.",1244419200,,642,4.792792792792793
3515567,3,B001CP7JTW,"Product ordered arrived in a timely manner.  All discs except the next to the last dvd worked fine.  The next to the last dvd in the set skipped, scrambled, and froze, making it unviewable.  While considering reordering Digimon's Season 2 Box Set, when I do, I make sure and keep my receipt so as to have some recourse if the ordered product is not in working condition.",1244332800,,370,4.492537313432836
3515568,5,B001CP7JTW,"When I first saw that Digimon came out in the season, I almost died. When I saw they had the second season on DVD, I did die. But then I came back to write this review. This Collectors Box Set include the entire Second season of Digmon. It goes all the way from when the new Digi-destined recieve their first Armor Digi-eggs to the fall of Malomyotismon. The old Digi-destined join the cast with the new crew to shake things up in the new season as well. As I watched each episode of the season, I forgot how engaging the show is for a younger audience, but still keeps the older audience interested. If you're a hard-core digimon fan, this second season Collectors Box Set is for you.",1240185600,,685,4.359375
3515569,5,B001CP7JTW,"Product came in mint condition, one of disks had fallen out of it's holding place but, other then that, it was perfect. I am absolutely going to buy from this seller again.",1236211200,,172,4.40625
3515570,4,B001CP7JTW,"First of all, yes, this release is a bootleg. The ""company,"" Alliance Entertainment, overlayed the American dub track with Japanese video (you can tell because the footage is missing the full episode titles in favor of ""homemade"" titles, the analyzer text is Japanese, etc.). Nonetheless, they did a great job putting it together. Both video and audio are crisp and clear. The only down side is the episode menu doesn't have the names of the episodes.

So yes, this is a bootleg, but a darn fine one. If Disney doesn't want to release Digimon on DVD, then fine. I'll give my money to someone who does.",1234224000,15,601,4.669811320754717
3515571,5,B001CP7JTW,"Three years later since the first season of digimon, Tai, Matt, Sora, Izzy, Mimi, Joe, T.K., and Kari have grown up to be teenagers. A new  darkness has come back, however a new enemy, the Digimon Emperor have appeared. Not just any villian, a human teenager is ruling the digital world. Since none of the DigiDestined's digimons can digivolve to their champion level and had given up their ultimate level and crests to save the digital world. It's up to T.K., Patamon, Kari, and Gatomon to defeat the Digimon Emperor- Ken and his digimon Wormon - and save the digital world with three new DigiDestined: Davis, Yolei, and Cody. Davis, Yolei, and Cody are chosen by three new digimon: Veemon (a lizard-like digimon with a little horn sticking out of top of his nose)- Davis', Hawkmon (a bird digmon with a belt on his head and feather sticking out)- Yolei's, and Armadillomon (an armored armadillo- like digimon with three-clawed limbs and a short tail)- Cody's.

 With the digi-eggs of courage, love, knowledge, friendship, sincerity (Purity), reliability, hope and light, the new DigiDestined and T.K. and Kari's digimons are able to digivolve in ancient form of Armor Digivolution. Working as team and facing many new and old enemies, it up to Davis, Yolei, Cody, T.K., and Kari along with their digimon to save the digital world.

I couldn't believe that the digimon series was on dvd. I couldn't wait to buy the first one, but then the second season was on sale. I wanted to buy both of them, but instead I brought the second season. When I got it I couldn't believe my eyes. I put the first disc on my dvd player and picture was perfect and the sounds were great. Also, the services(REFLECTMAGIC) was great and they were very helpful.

The season two is one of best season of digimon including the first one.
This season can teach viewers about courage, love, knowledge, friendship, sincerity (Purity), and reliability. No matter what you do, yours friends are there for you. There may be some fighting and slapping- which Hawkmon says in the series.. brutal, but affected, but helps builds friendship in some kind of way.

Digimon the second season is a great show and I can't wait to buy the first one and many other seasons of digimon. P.S. it never to late to watch digimon at any age.",1233705600,2,2294,4.7225
3515572,5,B001CP7JTW,"The second Digimon series is a direct continuation of the first one. Three years later, with most of the original DigiDestined now in high school at age fourteen, the Digital World was supposedly secure and peaceful. However, a new evil has appeared in the form of the Digimon Emperor who as opposed to previous enemies is a human just like the DigiDestined. The Digimon Emperor has been enslaving Digimon with Black Rings and Control Spires and has somehow made regular Digivolution impossible. However, five set Digi-Eggs with engraved emblems have been appointed to three new DigiDestined along with T. K and Kari. This new evolutionary process, dubbed Armor Digivolution, helps the new DigiDestined to defeat evil lurking in the Digital World.
The collector's case is identical to season 1. The video and audio is stellar like the first season. If you have the first season, then  you have to make sure you get the 2nd one as well.

3515573,5,B001CP7JTW,"A few months ago I found the first season on DVD and couldn't believe my eyes.  I had been searching for it forever, or so it seemed.  I instantly purchased it and I was very impressed.  There was some speculation as to if it was real or bootleg.  The first season is real, and so when I found the second season I purchased it without a second thought.  It's a great find.  I received it today.  The box was still factory wrapped and in fantastic condition.  All the disks are pristine and the image and audio are perfect.  All of the episodes from the second season are present.  I couldn't be happier.

Now, if you are considering buying this product, but have not seen or purchased the first season, I would highly recommend getting them together.  The story is brilliant, and the characters are unforgettable.  Yes, this show was intended for a younger crowd, but I know many older people who enjoy it.  I would say it is suitable for all ages.  It teaches many valuable lessons, while providing kick butt action scenes.

I can't wait to finish watching the DVDs, and I hope and pray that they continue to release the third, fourth and fifth seasons of Digimon in this way (even though they are not nearly as good as the first two, but still very good in their own right).

A must have for any Digimon fan!",1217203200,2,1310,4.414225941422594

8288595,5,B001CP7JTW,Digimon season 2 is great but not as great as season 1 that kicked off the entire Digimon franchise to date.,1370995200,,108,4.190476190476191
8288596,1,B001CP7JTW,"The reason why is because this DVD is nothing more than a fake DVD. It wasn't from the Saban Entertainment, but by Alliance Entertainment to rip people off from the real thing. Audio was way off and plus the names from the Digimon series are all wrong. Not worth $60. I am going to get the real thing that's coming in March 2013.",1356825600,,329,4.238095238095238
8288597,4,B001CP7JTW,"When you buy this, just beware that this is not an official release. It is a bootleg copy placed into a fancy box.

But! If you really love Digimon and you have been waiting since you first saw it for it to be on DVD, buy it. It's worth the money.

This box set only includes the episodes in English, and the sound quality isn't the greatest.",1355788800,,342,4.08955223880597

8288599,1,B001CP7JTW,"This release is a bootleg.  Digimon seasons 1, 2, and 3 never got western DVD releases. Only VHS releases.  Be warned, YOU ARE GETTING RIPPED OFF!",1339804800,8,146,4.576923076923077
8288600,3,B001CP7JTW,"I am willing to admit, that after seeing the quality of the Season 1 box set, despite numerous people on the internet saying that these are bootlegs, I just couldn't bring myself to believing them, but after buying the Season 2 box set I believe without any doubt. I tested all the discs and they all work, at the very least. I haven't watched all of the episodes yet on the discs, instead I just watched a few minutes of randomly selected episodes on each disc.

The sound quality seemed pretty bad for most of the episodes--my VHS copy of the first episodes have better sound quality than these discs do--but it seems that there are a few episodes in this box set that seem to have normal quality audio. What I really don't understand is that if they have the theme song playing at such a high quality on the discs' home menus, why couldn't they use that music in the episodes' theme songs? Speaking of the theme song, they really dropped the ball on this box set's opening. I am fine with the English opening, I am fine with the Japanese opening (even though I think it gives away too much of the story), but what they gave us was some butchered version of both. They take the English music, start it all in the middle of the Japanese opening, at the scene that the English opening starts at, and just plays the opening from there with the Japanese video but the English music leaving an unsatisfying mess that leaves you extremely confused and annoyed. What's even more annoying is that scenes were missing from the Japanese video, which means that they took the time to go through this video and thoroughly doctor up this monster when they could have just taken that time and used the original English opening, like they did for the Season 1 box set.

The Season 1 box set was far superior in nearly every way. I say ""nearly"" because despite the audio quality I must admit that the episode selection screen was just amazing.

Since I am a HUGE Digimon fan, and Season 2 is my favorite season I am extremely disappointed, but I will make do with this set of discs, despite the sound quality, because I now own every episode of Digimon Season 2 and I can watch them whenever I want! So bottom line, if you are a huge Digimon fan, you will probably be able to get over the poor audio--and maybe even the monstrosity of an opening--otherwise you may as well just find the episodes on the internet because they will probably be better quality anyway.",1327276800,6,2450,4.452115812917595
