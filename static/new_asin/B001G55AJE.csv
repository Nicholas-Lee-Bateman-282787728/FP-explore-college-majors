8303816,4,B001G55AJE,"I ordered this set of disks on June 10 and it arrived on June 21.  That's pretty good, considering that I think it has to come from England.  The picture and sound are excellent and the only reason I don't give it five stars is the way the disks are packaged.  They are in two plastic boxes, one with 7 disks and the other with 8.  Each box has a central pillar on which the disks are mounted.  That is absolutely the cheapest and most inconvenient way to package DVD's and I can't give five stars to disks packaged like that.  (On the other hand, the price is very reasonable.)

One of the boxes, but not the disks, suffered some damage in transit.  When I complained to the supplier they immediately offered a resolution that I think is fair and reasonable.

As advertised, these disks have optional English subtitles, which are essential for me since I'm pretty deaf.  However, there is one very important respect in which they differ from Amazon's description.  The specifications say they are coded for Region 2 and won't play on most American DVD or Blu-ray players.  Last month I bought a multi-region player from Amazon mainly so I could order and play these disks.  The fact is, however, the disks I received say ""Region 0"" on the box.  So I put one in my regular American Blu-ray player (made by LG), which is supposed to play Region 1 only, and it played just fine!  So it appears that you don't need a special disk player for these, and anyone who wants the complete series of Rumpole with subtitles can buy this for only $7.00 more than you would pay for the Region 1 set with no subtitles.

I notice this set includes 15 disks, whereas the Region 1 set has 14 disks.  This suggests that this set has more special features.  I haven't compared the descriptions to verify this.

All the characters in these episodes speak with English accents, and, Rumple being a criminal barrister, a lot of his clients speak with Cockney accents.  So why would they put out two complete sets, one for this country without subtitles, and one for England with subtitles?  Go figure.",1466467200,,2078,4.532258064516129
