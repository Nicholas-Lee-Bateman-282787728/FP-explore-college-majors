1809572,5,B00007G1TI,"It's really sad that Hollywood isn't producing this kind of b/w thriller today. ""Fog Island"" is not only fog-bound, without any means of outside communication, but also stunning in its plot development, acting, and intrigue.
George Zucco steals the show with his saturnine personality and nearly flat-affect delivery of every line. He's so very cool and controlled, even when others fly off the handle, as many of his ""friends"" do in the film. The theme: revenge, served piping hot, zesty...with lots of ""hot peppers"" as party favors, ""hints,"" as Zucco calls them, of his friends' cunning personality qualities.
And revenge it is!  To his everlasting credit, Zucco gets the last laugh while his friends dig their own watery graves. Only his stepdaughter and her college friend leave the island without even a hint of mist in their hair.",1398470400,4,836,5.057971014492754

1809577,5,B00007G1TI,"Here's what you get: George Zucco, Lionel Atwill, an isolated foggy island, a creepy mansion with all manner of secret rooms and a dungeon of sorts, a treasure hunt, secret murder devices, furniture with secret compartments, a strange and lurking co-conspirator, a mysterious lady fortune-teller, and a plan for murder! How could it get better than THAT?!?

Leo Granger (brilliantly played by Zucco) is a businessman who was wrongfully imprisoned for embezzlement -- this was the result of a conspiracy of his peers. But Granger was smart enough not to alert the conspirators that he was on to them so, when he's released from prison, he invites them all to his creepy old island mansion for a weekend treasure hunt where he lives with his lovely daughter... and the traitorous pals are all greedy enough to show up!

This 1945 black-and-white PRC film is really just another hallmark for Zucco's and Atwill's fine work. It's nicely packaged by Alpha Video and the print is a good one, full-frame, 72 minutes in length.

This film is reminiscent of a few other superb Zucco movies such as:

Now, I have to confess that I'm George Zucco's Number One fan (see my Amazon Listmania list: ""George Zucco... almost live!!!""), but this really is one of the better films of the spooky house mystery genre. And having the great Lionell Atwill in the film is simply icing on the cake. Other actors in the movie include Jerome Cowan (""The Song of Bernadette""); Veda Ann Borg (""Revenge of the Zombies""); and Sharon Douglas (""Our Hearts Were Growing Up"").

My highest recomendation!",1219968000,9,2176,6.475862068965517

He wants to punish the person responsible for murdering his wife. At the spooky mansion, with it's booby traps and hidden skeletons, the visitors are killed off one-by-one....A direct remake of 1941's ""Horror Island"", ""Fog Island"" is PRCs low-budget version of ""10 Little Indians"". Fans of horror-film stars George Zucco and Lionel Atwill will relish the over-the-top performances. Zucco and Atwill appeared together in only three films. Lionel Atwill was a Broadway star in the 1920's. Entering movies, he co-starred in Warners' 1935 ""Captain Blood"". But a messy personal scandal in 1942 left him employable by only Universal Pictures and lowly PRC. Lionel Atwill's climactic scenes in ""Fog Island""'s watery finale are almost grisly.  Just one year later, Atwill died of cancer and pneumonia while shooting the serial ""Lost City of the Jungle"". 1945's ""Fog Island"" also features Hollywood veteran Jerome Cowan. IMDB lists ""Fog Island"" at 1.37:1 aspect ratio 35mm. But this brand new DVD is closer to a 1.33:1 16mm source. Digital filtering has produced a generally crisp, clean transfer. But the source print contains blotches, clips, and a sub-par soundtrack. (""What did he say?"") The DVD has 6 skimpy chapters and a catalog. Movie fans of Zucco and Atwill will take the boat-ride to murky ""Fog Island"". But for the rest, an enticing title brings very few shocks and frankly, litte interest.",1050019200,23,1562,5.198412698412699

The storyline, although a bit over the top, none the less zips right along, holding one's interest until the darkly happy ending.",1045353600,11,354,4.983050847457627
1809581,4,B00007G1TI,"Based on the play ""Angel Island"" by Bernadine Angus, Fog Island is an interesting but somewhat problematic suspense thriller from 1945.  Leo Grainer (George Zucco) has retreated to the isolated confines of the aptly named Fog Island after being released from prison.  As the movie begins, he is accompanied by his step-daughter Gail (played by the lovely Sharon Douglas), whose mother was murdered during Grainer's time in jail.  Grainer blames five of his former partners and employees for framing him for embezzlement and then killing his wife in an attempt to find the loot they are sure Grainer has hidden somewhere.  He now invites these individuals to the island, convinced they will come in hopes of finding the loot they still seek, but Grainer is not planning on showing his guests a delightful time.  These guests include three men, his former secretary, and a female psychic; in place of one invitee is the deceased man's son who comes mainly to renew his acquaintance with Gail.  Grainer provides each guest with a clue to what they suppose to be the loot, and a night of sneaking around, mutual spying, arguing, distrust, and malice ensues.  I had trouble following the story at a few points; a great deal of the action takes place in the dark, and the print of the movie is so bad that I often had trouble seeing what was going on.  I am happy to say that I was not let down by the ending, although things did not go quite the way I had expected.  There is really nothing frightening here, but the movie does generate a decent level of suspense; your mind will be engaged throughout just trying to figure out what the heck is really going on.  Lionel Atwill and George Zucco are familiar names to fans of classic horror of the 30s and 40s, and their contribution, combined with Sharon Douglas' obvious appeal, do much to make Fog Island an enjoyable viewing experience still today.",1043280000,20,1895,4.697885196374623

1809604,3,B00007G1TI,"I'd give the movie 4 stars for the cast (Zucco, Atwill, etc), atmosphere, fun. The old creepy island with hidden passages, killers, and possible missing treasure never gets old. The young lovers were so-so at best, but given the war was going on that can be somewhat forgiven. I'd love to see if the stage version of this has really ever been done. So with all that, why do I give it 3 stars when I said 4? The print quality is terrible. There are times where its somewhere between unwatchable and black, sound crackles so loudly you can't hear the actors, skips and jerks abound. I don't think its just a cheap print, but age and deterioration of the print itself over time.

The transfer is anything but exceptional, but I'll take what I can get at this point).  The plot is overly familiar, trap a group of people on an island, in an old house, and pit one against the other using greed as the bait.  This is a tale of revenge.  And yes indeed, there is fog (of the artificial kind, wholly manufactured for effect).  Poor Leo Grainer (the fabulous George Zucco) is a tad miffed over his unfortunate incarceration where he languished helpless while his dear wife was being murdered by a one (or more) of the group he invites to his island stronghold.  As party favors, he hands out clues to a supposed wealth hidden somewhere on the premises.  There's a sance, naturally, led by a dubious seer.  There's one booby trap for the surviving scoundrels.  Not everyone makes it off this island in one piece.
