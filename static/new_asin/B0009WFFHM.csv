2327179,5,B0009WFFHM,"One day in a small village along the coast of Wales, a fishing harbour that is surviving in coming modernity that is going to destroy it and later on transform it. The film enables the director to create a real world extracted from Dylan Thomas's words, and the general description of the historical heritage of the village can be uttered by some guide on a bus half full of old ladies touristing around the country and the conclusion is the village can get levelled down no one would protest. That was a long time ago. Since then these small fishing villages on the Welsh coast have become seaside resorts for all kinds of rich people. Dylan Thomas tries to recreate the life of the village the way he remembers it. The film shifts the observing eye from the author to first a couple of unnamed male strangers going through the village and saying absolutely nothing, hence being pure creations in this film to focus especially on one observer, through whose ears and blind eyes we can discover everything, Captain Cap. This is also a great shift in the point of view of the poem. The medium is the message and the camera imposes its own point of view. I will definitely say it is a good thing to visualize the poem that is otherwise difficult to follow, but at the very same time it is imposing one interpretation, one reading onto the poem, a linear reading that does not accept contradictions and multifariousness. Personally I think a poem should not be visualized on a screen. It must remain language. A recording of this language is already reducing the number of possible readings, but it cannot really reduce it to one reading. Images often do because no matter what you may say, it is them that will come out first and last, dominant, number one. You may call a fish a cat, it will be what the image says and if the image is that of a fish, it will not be a cat. Whereas the word can accept metaphorical transpositions and displacements and even distortions. Images do not accept metaphors very easily except through ellipses, which are more metonymies than matephors, whereas words can easily express sleepless green ideas that sleep furiously. Yet the film is interesting because the editing makes us jump from one place to so many others with hardly one blink of one eye that we get a little bit dizzy and that is supposed to create in us a certain nostalgic feeling for the past, the long gone and forgotten and lost past.

2327180,4,B0009WFFHM,"This film adaptation of Dylan Thomas' wonderful ""Under Milkwood"" has dozens of characters, the most famous of whom are Richard Burton, Elizabeth Taylor and Peter O'Toole-- one of the problems with this production. There are simply too many characters to keep up with. The other problem is that the Welsh accents are difficult to understand. The play works better when performed on stage with a few characters reading several parts. On the other hand, the photography of the village and seacost is beautiful beyond words. And speaking of words, hearing Thomas' alliterative plumy language makes up for whatever failings this film may have otherwise: ""the dawn inches up,"" ""the tidy wives,"" and the village at night described as ""a hill of windows,"" etc., will make your heart leap up.  Mr. Burton's delivery of the long narrative passages is not to be missed.

The CD has a short interview with Mr. Burton and a longer biography of Dylan Thomas, constructed in most part from his beautiful poems. Both inclusions are an added bonus.",1169164800,27,1031,4.988372093023256
2327181,4,B0009WFFHM,"The 'bonus' material (the biography) was very interesting and a welcomed addition.

The 'movie' itself was generally very well done - I had only ever seen Thomas' work 'acted' out once - on stage. It is, of course, a 'play for words' and therein lies its strength. The portrayed actions were (in my humble opinion) conducted in a manner that aided the presentation of Thomas' masterpiece. However, there were a couple of 'director interpretations' that I did not like, or that I felt were not adequately expressed:

1. The scene with Burton, his 'lady friend' and side-kick, in the barn seemed tasteless and unnecessary - it does even NOT exist in Thomas' writings.

2. The 'ych-y-fy' repetitions were excessive - becoming annoying.

3. He totally missed (portrayal of) the obvious fiscal solicitations during the 'crytal ball readings'.",1141171200,8,837,5.087591240875913
2327182,3,B0009WFFHM,"...I have to agree with the previous reviewer to some degree.

 This film is, or rather has become, a curious and highly camp peice of ""Old fashioned Theatre"", on film. Under Milk Wood was meant to be a play for voices, written for radio and essentially an elongated poem which explores the Welsh way of life Thomas knew, the mid wars era, it originally explored the strange musicality and poetic nature of the language and speach of this small and mystical Country.

 Their are heavy themes of goodness , wickedness and sexuality and the indoctrination of good Chapel values on social order.

 Consequently the high drama of the voices renders the acting a curiously dated tone here, many fine Welsh actors appear but seem to gloriously, and sometimes cringingly, add flamboyance and excess colour to the characterisations.

 It doesn't quite work and Taylor is hopelessly out of her depth, playing more the Hollywood Diva than her character, but it does stand as a curious historic peice, the sweet shop, butchers, kitchen scenes and haberdashers are a delight and the scenery is beautifully picturesque but it all seems a bit overdone, even though it has to be to match the language, it doesn't reach a modern audience in the way Thomas intended I'm sure. Worth a look but I really recommend listening to a recording of this play, the way it was intended. Keen travellers will delight in knowing that ""Fishguard"", the actual location in Wales of the film, remains remarkably unchanged and very much worth a visit.",1121040000,7,1516,4.871595330739299
2327183,3,B0009WFFHM,"I own this on videotape, but will not, probably, be getting the DVD.

UNDER MILKWOOD is a play for voices, originially written for radio, and frequently done as a readers' theater piece by college and community groups. (By doubling parts one can do it with a fairly small cast, and the constumes, scenery, and props are minimal.)

Why then, would one even consider doing it as a film, that most visual of media?  A videorecording of a proper readers' theater production might have some pedagogical value, but it would be a rather dull film considered as film.  But this shoehorning it into a full cinematic treatment was totally wrongheaded from the beginning.

I'm giving it three stars only because of the cast; they were all very talented people and obviously were doing the best they could under the circumstances.  The only exception was Elizabeth Taylor, and that wasn't really her fault; (a) so much of her part was cut that one couldn't really get a valid impression of her conception of Mrs. Probert and (b) she was miscast--but she probably would have been even worse miscast as any of the other female parts!  As it was, it was obvious that she was really trying hard, but had too much going against her.

As for the cuts--and there were many--why, if they were so pressed for time that they had to cut so much, did they introduce that totally unnecessary and gratuitous 'Norma Jean' interlude?

Don't waste your money; get a proper, audio version.",1120521600,27,1459,4.735177865612648

2327187,4,B0009WFFHM,"I have been reading Dylan Thomas, poems, stories, recollections, and ""Under Milkwood"" since I was a teenager, in the mid-1960s. (""Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog"", and ""A Child's Christmas in Wales"" are outstanding, as poetic prose.)
I saw this film when it was first released in Australia, and half-liked it.
I watched it again, nearly forty years later, last night.
It is more likeable, in my old age, but, like the parson's egg (alluding to a classic cartoon-image in the British magazine ""Punch"") it is good in parts, and other parts are less than good.
Richard Burton speaks one of the narrating Voices, as voice-over.
He does this superbly, as he should, having been one of the first to do so in the original BBC Radio version, which is available, at least a a vinyl LP.
Burton personally knew Dylan Thomas!
Sadly, Burton appears, almost-silently on screen, as a strolling player, accompanied by a non-speaking chum: the two look as if they had wandered in from a production of Samuel Beckett's ""Waiting For Godot"". (Bewildered and desperate men in drab brown overcoats.)
Later he and his chum encounter ""Norma Jean"", a totally spurious addition to Dylan Thomas's actual radio play, and take turns to physically enjoy the pretty young woman in a dirty wood shed. What was the film director or screen-play writer dreaming of, by adding this?
The second narrating Voice of the original radio play seems to be omitted, amongst the obvious voice-overs that are the main soundtrack of the film. Again, why? Especially as the film does include Burton and side-kick, wandering through the seaside village of Llarerggub -- why not have the side-kick add a different vocal slant to Burton's rich voice?
The third main narrating voice is that of the now-blind old sea-captain, played here by Peter O'Toole, as old, blind man, and, in flash-back, as young man. The object of his old-man's memories, and young-man's lusts and loves is Rosie Probert, acted by Elizabeth Taylor -- whore with a heart of gold, obviously, and a taste for garish and massive eye-shadow (out of ""Cleopatra""?).
The ""story"" is one day in the small Welsh sea-town and its gentle, eccentric townsfolk: from a night full of dreams, through waking daylight, to the small town falling asleep again.
It is the variety of characters, their dreams, secret hopes and passions, and living interactions, that ""tell"" the ""story"".
Here we can be thankful for, usually, good casting. Dylan Thomas was a passionate Anglo-Welsh speaker, with a vivid ear for poetic sound and voice. Most of the actors catch the sound of his radio script, and make it live, on screen, individualising the many characters.
Most of the actors also capture a convincing appearance of what Dylan Thomas might have imagined.
The school children certainly look like early 1950s children.
But not all look good.
Organ Morgan, for example, LOOKS awful, as a lunatic-like red-haired man obsessed with playing a church organ. But it is obvious that he means well, in his acting, even though he can't actually play the organ.
Glynis Johns (""Mrs Banks"" in ""Mary Poppins"", amongst many sparkling film roles) is a sparkling Myfanwy Price, the love-object of Mog Edwards, the town draper.
Mae Rose Cottage, seventeen and never been kissed (ho ho), is a beautiful young girl, and when she says in the radio play that she intends to sin until she bursts, in the film we see her draw lip-stick circles around her bare tender nipples: you can't do THAT on radio! (The film does this very convincingly.)
No-Good Boyo (up to no good) is acted by a young David Jason (famous later for TV comedies such as ""Only Fools and Horses"" and ""The Darling Buds of May"", and the great police dramas of ""Inspector Frost""). We do not actually see him masturbating, but the film suggests this is part of his no-good-ness: again, you can't do THAT on radio, and maybe it need not be on film, anyway. His Huck-Finn-like waywardness, hinted at in the radio play, is clear enough, even in his amusing name. WHAT he does that is no-good can be left UNSAID, and UNSEEN.
Importantly, the village, and its surrounds, are beautifully pictured.
(Fishguard is the name of the film location. Captain Cat is shown living in a strange house whose upper storey is shapped like a ship's hull!)
Oddly, and infuriatingly, aspects of the narration (especially the DARKNESS of the night) are CONTRADICTED by the daylight-brightness of what we are looking at in the film while we hear dark-night words.
The ""anthracite"" horses are hardly jet-black, hard-coal black, for example -- and the famous sloe-black, slow black sea is not black either. How many people know what a ""sloe"" looks like? (A deeply dark blackish plum-likme fruit. Used, traditionally, to make a home-made wine called ""sloe gin"". This play, and film, cries out for a Glossary, or helpful FOOTNOTES!)
This is an abbreviated, and creatively (questionably, sometimes) decorated version of the full-length radio play.
Importantly, as with the great BBC Radio Long-Playing vinyl recording, whatever the spoken accents of viewers, in different English-language eccented places around the world, THIS film captures HOW the characters of Dylan Thomas ACTUALLY would SOUND! If the many Welsh accents are hard to understand for some viewers, this must be accepted as how it is, just as Cockney speakers must accept the way John Wayne sounds, or a shucks-you-awl way-down-south-speaker must accept Katherine Hepburn's or Carey Grant's accent.
As a film, it has flaws.
But it is, ultimately, intended as a sincere homage to the original, and to a great poetic writer.

It perfectly matches what I had imagined, and the performances by stars and supporting actors and actresses alike are quintessentially and poignantly Welsh.

A Successful financial-run in 95'@[...] I feel based on the originalmaterial that was somewhat edited down was far superior albeit in theater form with cast of unknowns and expertly directed by Glenn Terry whom knew and understood the script, while I had never read nor was familiar with the lyrical and poetic dialouge just how well it has been done since.
But Film is a different medium and therfore by comparrison only still has this been done more successfully on stage and it goes without saying no big names are required to breathe life into this somewhat repressed and semi-dark daydreams of a small-village town druggery gone mad if not the dialouge is beautifully spouted if not harder to enact and speak to audiences unfamiliar with Dylan Thomas works of ""Under Milkwood""",1186358400,,1111,4.883597883597884
2327193,3,B0009WFFHM,"This adaptation itself is a pretty soggy affair.  Ploddingly literal more often than not, giving you an image that matches exactly what the text is describing, though the occasional bad idea from director Andrew Sinclair makes you wish he'd stuck to ploddingly literal.  The design of the film's a mess, as well; the villagers seem to wear fashions from 1918 or so through the 60's, with the latter hideous beyond belief.  As in the equally misguided Burton/Taylor FAUSTUS, La Liz doesn't bother with period hair, make-up, costume, or an attempt at a characterization (although her Welsh gurgle has to be heard to be believed -- sounds like someone's strangling a cat).  Presumably she had a nice location holiday during the shoot (although even that's not apparent from her dim, studio-bound scenes on display here).  Veteran favorites like Vivien Merchant, Victor Spinetti, Sian Phillips and Glynis Johns aren't onscreen long enough to brighten the proceedings much.  And the top-billed stars, Burton and O'Toole, alternate between blank stares and bouts of scenery-chewing.  In spite of all these negatives, the film can't completely choke the life out of Thomas.  His wit, poetry and passion for the smallest detail of everyday existence poke through, perhaps here with the bedraggled air of a daisy growing in a cement sidewalk, but bringing pleasure nonetheless.  At least, the film's likely to send anyone stumbling across it at their DVD rental outlet racing to the library shelf to try and figure out what the devil THAT was supposed to be.

8068124,1,B0009WFFHM,"Review of Under Milk Wood
Hot Toasty Rag, July 20, 2017

Under Milk Wood is seriously one of the strangest movies Ive ever seen. Virtually the entire movie is set to Richard Burtons narration of Dylan Thomass prose. Most of the scenes are an overlay to his voice; the people in the scenes don't generally speak for themselves.
The scenes themselves are extremely strange. To start, Richard Burton and his odd-looking companion walk the streets of a seafaring town at night, and as they look upon residents houses or shops, Richard Burton tells the audience a little about the townspeople, or what they're dreaming about. Theres a man sleeping next to a skeleton dreaming of his mother, a woman dreaming of her cobbler lover, and a blind retired sea captain who remembers his former crew and love interest.

If you know Dylan Thomass writings, youll know what to expect. Every Christmas, I watch A Childs Christmas in Wales, so Im used to his ramblings about the residents of a small seaside town and his colorful descriptions, but if youve never heard his words before, youll probably find the sentences in this movie very strange. Honestly, if Richard Burton cant save the movie, its pretty bad. And it is pretty bad.",1500508800,,1218,4.795238095238095
