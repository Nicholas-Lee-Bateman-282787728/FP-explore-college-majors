2125157,5,B0002VEX6Y,"I'm sure many of you that have navigated to this item are completely familiar with the program.  It's very important before you buy this item that you realize that it is not a kids video.  When this show was made in 1966, it was for kids.  I watched in on the ""Captain Satelitte"" (Bob March) program on KTVU San Francisco on weekdays, and it was also on KCRA Sacramento on Saturday mornings.  For anyone who was a kid in this era and was lucky enough to be age 8-12 in the mid-sixties, this DVD is for you.  If you are a parent and are buying a DVD for your kids that are in the 8-12 year old range today, forget it.  I have videotapes of all the episodes obtained at conventions and such and I can tell you from first-hand experience that modern kids don't like these.

The target audience for this DVD is or should be the kids of the 60's who grew up with these characters and want to see the old comic books brought to life.  What these videos are, are the images from the actual silver-age Marvel comics of the 60's, crudly animated with over-the-top voice performances that bring the characters to life.  The animation itself is simply static images of comic book pages with an occasional animated arm or lip movement and a lot of zooms and pans.  They used the panels from the actual comic books to create the animation.

The artwork is classic Jack Kirby, Don Heck, Steve Ditko, and Gene Colan stuff.  The voice actors did a great job with the dialogue and performed their lines in a way that must be considered the de-facto superhero standard because it was so comic-book like.

At this writing, the item has not been released and whether it will be released at all is in question.  I'm hoping that someone associated with the project will read this review and take the time to present this item correctly into the marketplace.  Please do not release and package this as a kiddie video.

This DVD set should be a ""scholarly"" reference set.  There should be notes identifying all the voice talent and the artists and writers who created the original comics.  The actual comic books and artists are easily recognizable in the episodes and so each episode should include the information about the comic where the story was first told.  Since the audience is the grown-up boomers, this is the best way to get them to buy.  That is what they want I guarantee it.

There was no set broadcast episode order.  KTVU showed one segment at a time and you had to wait till the next day to get the next part of the story.  KCRA showed an entire three segment arc in one broadcast.  When I watched the show on KCRA, there was an opening theme song, ""The Merry Marvel Marching Society"" and end-title song and credits.  Each second and third segment had a re-cap of the story.

As far as I know, the opening and closing titles have never been shown on TV again since the 1960's.  All you get now are the individual segments and usually the re-caps are edited out or the three segments are edited together into one.  Please don't cut this stuff up to make it ""easier to watch.""  Comic fans want the originals and don't like such ""improvments.""  So, if the elements are available, please give us the original ""Marvel Super Heroes"" program with opening and end titles and all the recaps.  Put the shows in comic-book chronological order and include as far as possible the creative credits in the liner notes.

If a DVD box set of this type is produced, it will be purchased and hoarded by every collector and sold in every comic book shop in the land and at every convention every year forever.  The silver age comics are the gold standard and are still hoarded and fervently collected.  If you guys produce another kiddie video a few die-hards will buy it, but it won't have any legs and will go out of print for lack of sales just like all the other times these videos were released as kiddie video.  Learn the lesson and do it right.  I'm telling you who your customer is.  Will anyone listen to the customer?  Market this to an adult audience this time.",1109116800,133,4046,4.461852861035422
2125158,5,B0002VEX6Y,"I was very much looking forward to these DVDs, and I am quite disappointed that they apparently are no longer coming out.  I was going to write Disney a letter, but their stupid website is a piece of crap, and won't let you contact them in any damn way.  Disney is just a bunch of money hungry bastards.  I was going to simply write them a nice letter, but now they pissed me off by making everything difficult.  They can go screw themselves.",1108512000,13,442,4.289156626506024
2125159,5,B0002VEX6Y,"I love these old cartoons, but I have recently found out (from [...]) that this will not be released and that the Fantastic Four cartoon from 1994 will be in it's stead.  Is anyone else as annoyed as me?",1107734400,7,203,4.205128205128205
2125160,4,B0002VEX6Y,"This will be a fun series to watch again. Admittedly the animation is very sparse but it maintains the feel of reading the comics all over again which is what Stan Lee intended (along with no doubt, a sparse budget!)...there were 5 Super Heroes highlighted in this series:

1. Captain America, who has The Red Skull as his main antagonist.

2. Hulk, who frequently battles The Leader.

3. Iron Man and his early years foe, The Mandarin.

4. Thor and his evil brother Loki.

5. Sub-Mariner who was basically angry at everybody.

The show aired in early 1966 and was cancelled after one season, but there were enough cartoons made to make this set worth while. Unlike the later seasons of the 60's Spiderman, when Ralph Bakshi turned the Web Slingers adventures into a drug induced bizzaro fest, the Marvel Super Hero series remained faithful to its source...Just a reminder that you will not be witnessing classic animation in these toons (no MTV Digital Spiderman here) but you will find much to enjoy.... whether you are a baby boomer 40 year old, a teen wanting to experience a more simpler time in comic book storytelling, or a comic book buff who wants to recount how the origins and early plots of these characters developed you will be pleased viewing the Marvel Super Hero Set...recommended without reservation....",1102550400,43,1321,4.823008849557522
2125161,5,B0002VEX6Y,"This is an incredible set! From Captain America, Submariner, The Hulk, this was the beginning of the Superhero Television Animation Era!

Contrary to what TVshowsondvd said, these have been released on Video before as part of the Marvel Superheroes Video Library as well as the Star videos of the 1990's.  These releases included Iron Man, Submariner, Spider-man, the Hulk, etc. Most recently FoxVideo did a boxed set with various 1960's Marvel superheroes shorts.

I'm excited. These releases are well overdue.  These were some of the most 'faithful to the comic book' adaptions that have ever been done, and have fond memories in the hears and minds of many of us!",1094256000,5,666,5.027272727272727
2125181,5,B0002VEX6Y,"I watched this show as a kid and loved every minute of it. It ran on one of the TV stations in the Albany, NY market (I believe on Sunday mornings). I was born in '64 so I'm sure I was watching it in re-runs in the early 70s (as with the Fantastic Four cartoon from 1967). I would get up early just so I could see it and I absolutely loved seeing my favorite Marvel Super Heroes 'in action.' Captain America. Iron Man. Thor. Sub-Mariner. The Hulk. I can still sing most of the theme songs! It was great fun hearing the Iron Man theme song worked into the new Iron Man movie (played as an instrumental dance number as Tony Stark arrives at a party).

I would spend the money without hesitation to have these 'terrible' old cartoons again for the sheer nostalgia of it. They work in two ways. Of course thousands of Marvel Comics fans who grew up in the 60s and 70s would jump at the chance to have them. But undoubtedly their young kids will enjoy them as well, even with the primitive animation.

These cartoons would be great fun for me to see again so I sincerely ask that Disney get their act together and release them. It makes no sense to have the rights to them and leave them sitting in the vault. Perhaps there are only a few voices speaking out for the release of these old nostalgia pieces on amazon, but there are silent thousands of folks my age that would probably pick them up!! If, as suggested, Marvel Comics disapproved of the cover art, then work something out and move on. Come on guys, get with it!",1213747200,5,1518,4.267361111111111
2125182,4,B0002VEX6Y,"When I saw this announced on Amazon as a pre-order, I got SOOOOOOO excited!!! I used to watch these cartoons as a kid. Even though they were even lower budget than the '67 Spiderman cartoons, they were still great (in a cheesy way) Nostalgia took me over and I have been obsessing about these DVDs ever since. I waited.... and waited..... and waited for the release. Then I started wondering what happened???? The I did a little research, and found out that there was a lawsuit where Marvel comics Sued Buena Vista Home Entertainment for their illegal use of a Spiderman poster/artwork which came from a deal Marvel had made with a seperate game company for the Spiderman Movie. Well, I can read between the lines here and assumed that the lawsuit put the kibosh on any plans Buena Vista had to release the Marvel '66 collection. Weather it was sour grapes or just a bad business vibe where Buena Vista felt that Marvel wouldn't allow any latitude to try to recoup if sales were soft, that seems to me to be the end of that dream. I sincerely doubt that anyone else will try to release this cartoon series (why is this again that Marvel can't just do this themselves?) Anyway, Major bummer!!!!!!!! I for one am supremely dissapointed. I feel that both companies missed a prime opportunity to cash in on the baby boomers who remember this low budget gem with great nostalgia. ""Hey Kids... look at what your old man used to have to watch on TV as a kid!! No fancy computer animation when I was a kid!!""",1195862400,7,1500,4.518382352941177
2125183,5,B0002VEX6Y,"Like everyone on this list, I remember running home from school to watch these cartoons! If anyone from Marvel is looking at these boards, it should be apparent that you will not be able to keep these DVD's in stock once you release them. Who cares about graphics? This is about fond memories during the childhood years!! Please release them!",1189987200,7,342,4.716666666666667
2125184,5,B0002VEX6Y,"I normally don't write reviews but if it will help get these cartoons released - here's my vote. Classic stories brought to the screen, each hero with their own theme song that have stayed in my head since I first saw them in the sixties. Thor, Sub-Mariner, Iron Man, Hulk, and Captain America - the heroes Marvel fans love. What's the hold-up on releasing?",1189382400,5,357,4.59375
2125185,5,B0002VEX6Y,"Has anyone heard anything new on if or when this is going to be released?

 Any update would be appreciated.",1166400000,5,108,4.35
2125186,5,B0002VEX6Y,Anyone have updated information on if and when this DVD will be released?,1139356800,9,73,4.6923076923076925
2125187,3,B0002VEX6Y,"When I saw these as a kid I knew that being a Marvel comic reader (as opposed to DC) was now officially okay. I recognized instantly (you will too) that the animation was lousy. However, even lousy animation with Marvel stories was better than the cheesy Batman TV show. Looking back at these (I have some of these on video), my opinion hasn't changed. The transition from comic book to cartoon is rough (Thor's melodramatic speeches, for example) don't translate well. However, when we get Kirby artwork on the TV screen, now THAT counts for something, even if the ""animators"" just move a still shot across the screen.

Who would like this? Those of us who still enjoy a nostalgic trip down memory lane and collectors of Silver Age comics. Young children who have not become jaded by modern animation techniques might be enthralled by the stories themselves. Marvel has recently tried to recapture the younger crowd with its Marvel Age line of comics--good luck to them. It would be nice to see young people reading again. It's become a lost skill in our video-driven age.

As others have said about this coming release--please do it right!",1131148800,12,1141,4.786802030456853
2125188,5,B0002VEX6Y,"I'm ready for this one to be released. I remember being 7 or 8 years old and watching it everyday on Channel 17; here in Nashville, Tenessess. I remember the theme songs to all of the superheroes of The Hulk, Captian America, Sub-Mariner and Iron-Man. This is good, because I tell my children right now; you don't know cartoons and superheroes; the way I know do. And at that time, we all want to be these superheroes when we played outside and just for a moment, when we were watching these REAL cartoons on our black and white television sets in the mid-70's; our imagination took us there for that small moment.",1128211200,9,614,4.491071428571429
2125189,5,B0002VEX6Y,"No, these shows aren't ""animated"" in the traditional sense -- they are similar to the old CLUTCH CARGO tv show, an old-time radio drama combined with COMIC BOOK visuals.  I would be very disappointed if Disney (how the hell did THEY get the license to Marvel's animated product?  What about FOX? Or SONY?) did not release this, but seeing as how I just stumbled across this listing, and knowing the ""wisdom"" of DisneyCorp as I do, it wouldn't surprise me.  If anyone at Disney Video is reading this, please regard this as a plea to reconsider, and market this accordingly -- to middle-age comic book freaks, the kind that will gladly pay $50 a pop for Marvel's own hardcover reprints of their classic Silver Age comics (by and large, the very same stories featured in many of these 'toons).  If Disney was smart, they would package and market this thing to resemble the ""Marvel Masterworks"" hardcover collection of reprints.  Good quality remastered prints of the 'toons with some introductory remarks for each character's series by Stan Lee. Perhaps include some ""bonus"" materials, like a booklet containing original ads from the '60s Marvel comics hyping the series, along with various ""Bullpen Bulletin"" ITEM!s plugging the show.  Maybe even include a reproduction of the original Merry Marvel Marching Society fan club kits, just to make this a Silver Age Marvel fanboy's droolworthy, must-have double-bagged item.  Of course, it goes without saying that the shows should be arranged in chronological order, and the original comics' issue numbers and dates, on which the episodes were based, be noted in the liner notes.  Sadly, I dispair of it ever happening.  But as another commenter noted, if they did it right and marketed it right, it would sell forever in comic book shops across the land.  Ahh, well.",1124841600,10,1812,4.970198675496689
2125190,3,B0002VEX6Y,"If you were into Marvel comics back in the late seventies and early eighties, then you will most likely have fond memories of the Marvel Men cartoons. What made them so unique was that both the art and plots were based on classic Marvel comics from the Silver Age. By today's standards they're rather primitive. I wouldn't recommend buying it for anyone who grew up on ""Batman: the animated series"". However, if you're from my generation and love Marvel comics, then this is a must have. I just wish they would hurry up and release it already! What's the delay?",1124323200,5,561,4.62
2125201,4,B0002VEX6Y,"What a fantastic show! I'm in my early 30's and remember this during the 80's. I loved it and always wondered if they would come out with these on dvd. I would definately spend 53.00 as these rank as one of my earliest memories. Of course, the suspense will kill us, but it's worth the wait. As far as the young people of today, I will give them more credit than my 60 year old counterparts do. They would most assuredly like this show if they are Marvel buffs.

Live long and propser.",1124236800,2,485,4.21505376344086
2125202,4,B0002VEX6Y,"I remember when I was 8 years old I saw the marvel series which included Thor, Submariner, Captain America, and The Hulk. I was fascinated with marvel comics and they showed it on T.V. This was in the mid 80's. I loved the old school cartoon shows which aired on early Sunday mornings and yet someone said back in the day they only aired it for one season. Come on man, these were great marvel epics. Showing the origins of those famous super heroes. It's shame that these shows didn't get much respect that it deserved.",1121385600,2,520,4.427083333333333
2125203,5,B0002VEX6Y,"Yes I remember this tv series, I was 12 at the time. And I

could hardly wait to watch it every eveing a 6:30 pm.

 As the first reviewer stated, These are not for kids of today's

High tech, live-action, Loud noise kid shows. They are more for

kids of my generation (45-50),who have read the comics, and got into the Marvel comic universe. I would highly recomend this set for old folks like me. So this set of dvds should be marketed more toward an older buyer like myself.

 But at a much lower price. 50 bucks for Star Wars dvds I can see, but 53 dollars for a 50 year old cartoon series? No way!",1119225600,9,601,4.085470085470085
2125204,5,B0002VEX6Y,"Wow...full re-wind to the early 1970's when these used to be on everyday after school.  A different character was featured each day with a lineup of Captain America, Iron Man, The Hulk, Sub-mariner, and Thor.  This was not animation per se.  What Marvel did was use panel art from actual comics, transferred the are onto cels, and give them some slight animated movement.  They then added in voice actors and sound effects.  What it basically turned out to be was an animated comic book which was kind of cool because it brought a lot of classic silver age comics to life...more or less.  Each character eneded up with 13 complete shows so repetitions were quite plentiful, of course.

Captain America would feature stories including Cap's origin retold from Tales of Suspense, The origin of Caps arch-enemy the Red Skull, And cap battling other villains such as Baron Zemo, The Masters of Evil, The Super Adaptoid, The Swordsman, and one of my favorite stories featuring the Sleeper Robots of the Red Skull.

The Hulk (which featured EASILY the catchiest theme song of the bunch) would feature his origin (although curiously it was not the first episode) and also the hulk battling villains like The Leader, The Gorgon, The Abomination, and also feature the Hulk's breakup with the Avengers.

Iron Man had some of the best villains in my humble opinion including other guys in suits of armore like the Crimson Dynamo, and the Titanium Man.  Also included on the villain list is the yellow menace ""The Mandarin"", The Moleman, and would include appearances by Hawkeye.

The Submariner was always my least favorite on account of he was more villain than here to me.  I never really liked the water-based characters like him and Aquaman.  Typically the stories involved Atlantis being in danger of destruction.  There was a very good story featuring Doctor Doom, too.

Thor was always my favorite.  Transformed from a lame doctor into the God of Thunder, thor battled the most powerful foes like the Enchantress, the Executioner, Loki, The Absorbing Man, The Destoyer, and featured a great adaption of ""Whom the Gods would Destroy"" from Journey into Myster #126.  Thor would also meet Hecules as well.

As archaic as the animation may be this is still a fantastic trip back in time to the glorious silver age of comics.  Hey, the DVD will certainly be cheaper than trying to track down all the comics.  Great Stuff!",1118361600,21,2412,4.865196078431373
2125205,3,B0002VEX6Y,"I watched this show every chance I had when I was a wee lad. These cartoons were good fun and made many a Marvel Comics fan in their day. Because they were geared toward young viewers, unlike later attempts to ""darken"" these comic characters for young adult audiences, these cartoons are more suitable for kids than ever, although some children may not like the older animation style. The animation is not expensive or top-notch, nor was it when these were new. Like most cartoons made for TV then and now, the animation was not beautifully done to save money. However, these shows are great fun and you can watch and share them with your children without suitability issues. For kids interested in TV history or just curious about what older shows were like, these cartoons are great fun. My son loved seeing the old Spiderman cartoons, Speed Racer and other old shows I watched when I was his age now that we can get them on DVD. We've also enjoyed many shows and films made before both our times that are now available on DVD or VHS, like Little Rascals and Space Patrol. If you and your children enjoy exploring older shows together and like comic book heroes then this set will be much enjoyed. If you saw these shows when you were younger, there's plenty of nostalgia value in them as well. These will surely be fun for casual comic book fans and many hard-core fanatics as well.

I saw the Submariner episode from a VHS recently... outstanding!!! I have always loved the voiceovers, the language in the Submariner and Thor shows. This series is a true classic that any boy who watched TV in the mid 60s will remember and want to own.  Captain America and Buckey! The Mighty Thor! Prince Namor the Submariner! The Hulk!

2125207,4,B0002VEX6Y,"As it has stated in the opening song, ""the MARVEL SUPERHEROES has arrived"" ... in a 5-disc DVD box set, that is. After years of watching 24 episodes via Prism, Best and 20th Century Fox home videos, seeing them and the rest, which I haven't seen since MSH was on syndication in 1980, will be a treat to watch all of the super-heroics and super-villainy mixed with action, romance, drama and a few laughs that have been Marvel Comics' trademark for years. CAPTAIN AMERICA, THE INCREDIBLE HULK, IRON MAN, THE MIGHTY THOR and SUB-MARINER (all produced in 1966) were so distinctive and unique from one another, it's hard to pick a favorite. Okay, I'm leaning towards Ol' Shell-Head.

  Grant Simmons and Ray Patterson (the last names together formed into Grantray) with Robert Lawrence did a great job in literally making the works written and drawn by the mighty Marvel Bullpen ""come to life"" on the TV screen. Creating animation cels from comic book panels was very innovative at the time. However, by looking at the reprints of some of those books recently, I noticed that they altered the story and art direction. Changes such as the Hulk's skin color in his origin story, the Fantastic Four was replaced by the X-Men and the Avengers in a Subby tale, and Rick Jones, Giant-Man and the Wasp didn't appear with the Avengers ""big three"" in a Cap story. Nonetheless, they managed to keep the essence of the Silver Age intact.

  As far as the theme songs and background music go, they were the true definition of classic. However, I often wondered about the ""MSH"" and ""MMMS (Merry Marvel Marching Society)"" theme songs ever since I read the lyrics from various Internet websites. I never, ever, saw them on TV and on video. Hopefully, they'll be included (and they'd better be as good as the heroes' theme songs ... I'll keep my fingers crossed). I can't wait for my box set to come, but patience is a virtue. I guess I could say that's six down --- including Spider-Man's first animated series --- and four to go. And we all know which ""four"" I'm referring to.

  This review is sincerely dedicated to a veteran actor who recently passed away, Mr. John Vernon (the voices of Iron Man/Tony Stark, the Sub-Mariner/Prince Namor, Major Glenn Talbot and various others). Rest in peace, sir. 'Nuff said, true believers.",1111276800,4,2311,4.7288557213930345

A scholarly approach would help sell the DVD. I would certainly purchase and I hope Disney decides to release it (I also would like to see a DVD of the 67 Fantastic Four, a much better series than the Spider-Man 67 cartoon, IMO.

Though they are Region 2 DVDs you can buy them all (Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Submariner) and watch them on TV.

How, you ask?

Simple...Put the disks in your computer and rip MP4 files form them using a video encoded like Handbrake (available for free) which strip the region encoding.  Then you can watch the video files on your computer or TV with a streaming device like an AppleTV.

This is completely legal as long as you purchase the disks legally from a retailer such as Amazon.uk.

THAT SAID, I cherish these cartoons and view them timely with my 12 year old son often as a movie night like when cable TV. networks would feature a film during prime time.
I WOULD BUY THIS COLLECTION TWICE IF I COULD FIND THEM IN A HIGH QUALITY DVD COLLECTION-
I grew up in the early 1970s and recall the programs on TV. from 1973 on.  I fondly relate with the MARVEL SUPERHEROES CARTOONS and the sense of ORIGINAL MARVEL ANIMATION/IMAGERY from the best years of the comic world of Marvel to my personal sense of perspective.
I highly recommend any opportunity to own the MARVEL SUPERHEROES COLLECTION but would re purchase this again in a better quality DVD reissue that would be revitalized in DVD distribution.  I could only imagine how these cartoons would look and sound digitally repackaged and enhanced to be appreciated with the same standard as say the Universal Classic horror films are being treated as for DVD re release.
SO- YES, I WOULD BUY THIS COLLECTION TWICE FOR THE SAKE OF PRESERVING THE BEST THAT WE CAN GET IN AMERICAN CULTURE! I cannot stress the importance of these cartoons and the Stylized Treasure that the collection represents, to me on so many levels* MAKE MINE ORIGINAL MARVEL 1966
The comics portrayed in this particular series are very good for kids who like to read or are into a varied interest in art, history, and mythology.  The content is somewhat dated in terms of production compared to the modern standards of animation and graphic design but for the hand drawn imagery of 1966, the characterization is impeccable and true to the original concept being directly taken from the original actual comic book that the story is first derived from then transferred to animation.
I appreciated as does my son the great stories and references to ALL THINGS MARVEL UNIVERSAL.

8032886,5,B0002VEX6Y,"Growing up in the 1960's and being a big fan of the Marvel comics,one of the first ""must see"" television programs that debuted daily was The Marvel Super Heroes cartoons.  At first I was a little disappointed because the line-up did not include my two favorite titles, Spiderman and The Fantastic Four, but the show allowed me to gain an appreciation of two of the lesser Marvel titles, namely Submariner (pronounced in the cartoon submaroner and not like a ""submarine- r"") and The Mighty Thor.

Each day of the week that had a different hero and each cartoon was taken directly from the comic book.  As a matter of fact they were so cheaply made that they took the actual artwork cels from the original comic art and made the characters mouths move.  To get a character to run they sometimes just moved the ""still"" character across the screen.  No matter, I hardly noticed as television cartoon animation during those days was no big deal.

The cartoons each had their own theme songs.  I loved the theme songs, especially the song to the Merrry Marvel Marching Society.  I later learned that if you joined the MMS, Marvel sent you a record with the song along with a membership card.  Those records might be pretty valuable today, especially if you have one in good condition.

The stories were better than most cartoon stories as they were taken exactly from the original classic comics.  One of my favorites was how Captain America was found floating in the ocean by the Avengers.  Apparently he and Bucky Barnes had been after Zemo (the villian with a mask glued to his head that maybe should have tried nail polish remover to get it off) had blown them up and Cap was frozen solid for over 20 years in suspended animation.

Hulk had a funny voice and he was always yelling ""why?"" and ""you dare threaten Hulk?'  Tony Stark was very sophisticated and was always seeming to battle the Mandarin who had a Charlie Chan-like voice.  Captain America was off battling the Red Skull, while Thor seemed to be always fighting Mr. Hyde and The Cameleon.  Submariner also called Namor had his blue girlfriend, the Lady Dorma and the Hulk seemed to always be battling The Leader.

By today's standards these cartoons are probably laughable (I even remember when Thor spoke with his father, Odin, the artwork of Odin would change three times in the same scene), but the great storylines make them enjoyable and a treasure to have!",1284508800,2,2421,4.685579196217494

The purpose is to hopefully generate interest and to inform Marvels new masters at Disney that there is a market out here for this collection of animation.  Not only are there ""baby boomers"" who would be interested in owning these but every generation that has come after has devoted Marvel fans as well.  Fans devoted to these shows, Marvel fans who buy anything with their favorite character on it, and collectors who see value in nostalgia.  I know for certain that other generations are interested because as I write this I am watching the 1966 Captain America with my three year old son who loves, absolutely loves these shows.  My 19 year old nephew also watched these with my 45 year old brother when he was a child and would gladly pay for this set as well.  You see there are alot f us out here who would gladly pay for these.  There is a market for these as bootlegged DVD's and I will confess that I have all of them.  But even so I would wait in line and paytop dollar for an official release with some nice special features (I would even pay for it without special features).

When I was a child I collected the MARVEL COMICS VIDEO LIBRARY (buying them used from video rental stores all over the country) and there were several episodes on these videos from the 1966 show.  This is how I was introduced to the show.  I in turn introduced them to my brother and nephews and now my sons.  Its just good entertainment for everyone.  When I was a child that is what Disney was all about but now its all about makin' a buck.  Well it seems to me that Disney could do both things by releasing these to the public.

The only thing left to say is please, please Disney, relase these so that we might enjoy them with a claned up print and maybe some fun special features.  Thanks!",1276300800,12,1909,4.362606232294618
8032888,3,B0002VEX6Y,"I have just recently purchased this set on region 2 new and it was perfect except no Hulk!! I was so hurt and could not understand why they would not include one of the more important titles from this series! It looks like Jetix and Disney produced this set and we almost got the cigar on it but no Hulk is not cool. I would have wanted Captain America to fall instead. But I got My fav of the series The Submariner, also Iron Man, Thor & Cap with all 13 episodes of each. The audio is ok and the picture looks the same as when I watched them in the late 70's so I've been really taking a trip back. Have to get that Hulk Though. I haven't seen this set on DVD in 4yrs. I have physically held the VHS version in my hand with all 5 of the series but passed on the format to wait for the discs which I've only seen once with all 5. Lets try it again Marvel this time without the red tape!  later Y'all!!!!!",1226361600,,904,3.939890710382514
8032889,5,B0002VEX6Y,"Like the other fans, I must exclaim as well, to please release these episodes on DVD complete!  I was a little kid in the early 70s when I was watching these; I love them so!",1224028800,4,174,3.9714285714285715
8032890,4,B0002VEX6Y,I would like to see these released with reprints of the original comic books. Cross-marketing further... has anyone noticed what the Marvel Super Heroes bubblegum cards sell for on eBay? Reprint the cards (of course in a way that they can't be confused with the genuine 1966 cards) and sell us a set of the cards with the DVDs and the reprint books. It'd be like printing money...,1222992000,,380,4.602941176470588
8032891,5,B0002VEX6Y,"Those of us who grew up in the New York area during the 60's remember these episodes so well we can recite the cheesey themesongs.  In New York the shows were broadcast on WOR channel 9.  Captain America on Monday, The Hulk on Tuesday, Ironman on Wednesday, Thor on Thursday and the Submariner on Friday.  The joy for me was recognizing the stories from my comic book collection and enjoying the artwork.  The animation was ridiculous but who cares.  I was traveling in India 10 years ago and was surprised to see episodes broadcast at 6 am in Delhi. You can also catch portions of episodes on YouTube.",1222560000,3,602,4.537037037037037
