8572802,5,B000KBG6J8,"It is an excellent training video for leading a worship group in the church. Paul Baloche focused not only in the instrumental part but in the foundation of worship which is music being performed to the Lord. He emphasized that the direction of music is toward the Lord and not the congregation. And, he also mentioned that as a worship leader we are helping or facilitating people's worship of the Lord and not performing for the people.",1257638400,,438,4.701298701298701
