7901174,5,6304749910,"Whether or not a video or movie deserves an ""A"" grade depends on whether it can withstand repeated viewings.  This concert by Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons fits that qualification.  The songs you think of when you think of The Four Seasons are all here in addition to a half way point in the concert of doo wop music.  The Four Seasons have always been my favorite singing group and they did not disappoint me in this video.  If you enjoy The Four Seasons you owe it to yourself to buy this video.",1011744000,10,502,4.308510638297872
7901175,4,6304749910,"I am 55 and have considered myself to be a diehard fan of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons for almost forty years.  What a surprise when I learned that I could obtain a very inexpensive video!  However, the first six songs were truly uninspiring.  Frankie Valli appeared stiff and unsure of himself.  His voice was weak and the arrangements were not consistent with the music going on in my head.  The Seasons and the band overwhelmed Valli and you could tell he wasn't connecting with the audience. I was shattered by the marginal rendition of ""Dawn."" After the sixth song ""My Eyes Adore You,"" I felt stricken.  Then Frankie turned the mike over to one of the Seasons for a song called ""Silver Star"" with the note that this song had been recorded--I assumed not too long before the tour. I expected the worst!!! Boy was I wrong! It was the beginning of the video I had hoped for.  The song was quite good and the singer's voice was reminiscent of the sixties' Valli.  The next song brought Valli back with a change of clothes and, I suspect a change of show, for Frankie was in great form with the beloved ""December of 1963"" (the only disco song I ever liked). After picking up steam from that, the group belted ""Swearing to God"" and then went into a short set of Doo Wop songs like only Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons could do.  From ""Remember When"" through ""Blue Moon"", I was transfixed. This set also gave me an oportunity to get acquainted with the newer Seasons--not the group of my youth. They just made me a believer and kept the ""sound"" up to the very end. The final songs were pure heaven. The audience was just rockin' out.  How I envy them!! I really would prefer to look at this as a 4.75 rather than a 4.0. I'm pretty much only upset about ""Dawn"" and ""Working My Way Back to You"". No doubt I will enjoy this video over and over for as many years as I have. I have introduced Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons to my eighteen month old grand-daughter through their Anthology, as I did with her mother and auntie, and when she is a little older I'm sure she'll love the video as well. Her favorite is ""Big Girls Don't Cry"". I'm delighted that it was played near the end of the show so that it is among the best of the evening.",983836800,15,2244,4.321428571428571
