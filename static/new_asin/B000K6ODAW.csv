8154503,5,B000K6ODAW,if you like full moon movies then you will like this one,1407369600,,56,3.75
8154504,5,B000K6ODAW,"For me, it was the one movie ""Doctor Mordrid"".  Growing up on Dr. Strange comics and watching the SciFy movie Dr. Strange from the 60s, I believe, Doctor Mordrid gives you a much more modern uptake on the movie.  Believe you will enjoy it as much as I did.  Blends in well with the other comic book movies of today like Superman, Batman, Green Lantern, etc.",1377561600,,357,4.378787878787879
8154505,4,B000K6ODAW,I think this is a nice set of four works low budget but smart. Of coarse some I like more than others. Plus the T& A was not always needed for the story to flow. Charles Band needs to talk to Hollywood.,1376697600,,202,3.8333333333333335
8154506,3,B000K6ODAW,"I ordered this collection because I had an urge to see Meridian,which if you enjoy the classic Beauty and the Beast type storyline then this is a movie for you. The other movies in this collection are entertaining with all of the B movie cheesy plots and special effects.",1265760000,,271,4.551020408163265
8154507,4,B000K6ODAW,"Full Moon have a handful of box sets available to purchase, two of them are entitled, ""Full Moons Classics Vol. 1 and Vol 2"".  Since Charles Band seems to direct most Full Moon films anyhow, I'm kinda curious as to why there is a Charles Band Collection Vol 1.  Maybe he hand picked these four films as a good representation of his work, or maybe they are his favorite films.  It doesn't really matter I suppose, coz what we have here is a mixed bag of Full Moon films.
Meridian is a Beauty and the Beast type story.  Sherilyn Fenn moves to a castle in Italy where there are a bunch of oddball carnival performers hanging around her property.  One of them is a guy who turns into a werewolf-like beast every time he gets jiggy with Sherilyn(can't say I blame him, I probably would too).  There's a mystery about some family curse and other nonsense.  It's not so much of a horror film as it is some kind of erotic fantasy deal.  It's not too bad though.
Crash and Burn is a post apocalyptic tale of a bunch of people trapped inside a television station-which is a front for a revolutionary headquarters-who come under attack by a cyborg assassin played by Bill Moseley.  Also not a bad film.
Doctor Mordrid has Jeffrey Combs as a sorcerer guarding the gate to our dimension from his apartment.  An evil rival sorcerer played by Brian Thompson(he's that mean looking brute who played the evil cult leader in Cobra with Stallone) has plans to take over Earth, but he has to get through Doctor Mordrid first!!  This is a fun movie.  It's silly as hell of course, but you can't help but enjoy it, especially with Combs playing a hero in a tight blue outfit with a cape.  From what I understand, Full Moon wanted to do a film based on the Marvel comic character Dr. Strange, but couldn't get the rights or something.
And finally Head of the Family is a goofy horror/comedy about a guy trying to blackmail a rich family of oddities to do his bidding.  The ""Head"" of the family is literally a head with arms.  A better movie than it probably should be, and much wittier than you'd think.
None of these films look like they've been remastered or cleaned up in any way.  They look like good VHS transfers at best.  I suppose we can't be too picky if we really want them on DVD.  They all come with their ""Making Of"" Videozone features, but that's all.
Well, you'll know if you want it.",1231545600,10,2376,4.39816933638444
8154508,3,B000K6ODAW,"I've been a fan of Full Moon videos for 20 years. All my VHS copies have since died a slow, painful death, and I have waited for a DVD release of these films for quite a while. I took my first plunge with the Charles Band Collection Vol. 1 (since Maridian is one of my favorite FM flicks.) I have to say that I was hesitant to buy these films sight unseen, but since I am a huge fan, I bought them anyway.  However,  they didn't come without a fair amount of disappointment.

The video on all four movies looks to be nothing better than an OK VHS copy (looks alright on standard definition TV, but looks awful on HD). The audio is about the same.  None have selectable chapter stops. MERIDIAN and DR. MORDRID include the original, behind-the-scenes ""Video Zone"". While CRASH AND BURN has the Video Zone and a blooper reel. HEAD OF THE FAMILY has a behind the scenes ""preview"" of BRIDE OF HEAD OF THE FAMILY (was this even a real movie???)

This collection is good for fans of Full Moon whose VHS copies have been worn thin, I just wish there could have been more time and effort put into the final product. So...buyer beware! These are good, but nowhere near what they should have been.",1201651200,17,1186,4.34841628959276
8154509,3,B000K6ODAW,"I know it's a bit odd but...I bought this set specifically to get Crash And Burn on DVD. I don't know why exactly, I can't quite put my finger on it but I just love that movie. It's got nothing really special specifically that I can point at and say hey that's what makes it a great movie. It has average special effects, average acting, average sets, reasonable story line, but as a whole the movie just works so well for a sci fi flick that I really, really like it.

The feel, pace and setting just come together and make an average movie into a real gem. So many times that's the bottom line for me, it's not about the nuts and bolts of the the movie, but how it all comes together and pulls off a ""feeling"", something I can get into and feel a part of, get absorbed in.

I've watched this movie over a dozen times and still love it.

Unfortunately I can't comment at this time on the other movies in this set as I have not got around to watching them, but Crash and Burn is a great, overlooked gem in the sci fi genre that is well worth the viewing time. Get the VHS version used if you want a cheap enterway into watching it.",1192838400,6,1131,4.085585585585585
8154510,4,B000K6ODAW,"Finally, Meridian and Doctor Mordrid available on DVD! The shows included in this set are fairly cheesy, comic-book romps through the land of horror wanna-be's, but there is such enthusiastic charm abanduant here, I couldn't help but find it engaging. (And ""Head of the Family"" is attractively bizarre) Be prepared for many, many moments of lulls and doldrums in between the good bits. All tranfers are 1.33:1 full-frame, as they were all originally produced for direct-to-video market in the 1990's.",1182988800,5,500,5.2625
