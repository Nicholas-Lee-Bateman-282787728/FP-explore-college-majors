341009,5,6301650425,"This is one of the most entertaining basketball movies I have ever seen. Although the implausible plot is silly, the concentration here should be on celebrity viewing, Harlem Globetrotterish antics and humorous eccentric characters. The movie combines astrology with a very-off-the-wall basketball team.
  Former NBA players Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Julius Erving appear in this basketball comedy film. Former Harlem Globetrotter ""Clown Prince"" Meadow George Lemon III ( ""Meadowlark"" Lemon ) makes a rare film appearance in this totally chaotic but sensationally scintillating movie.
  Watch closely for the basketball player nicknamed ""Set Shot"". He makes brief appearances and is seen sinking free throws with uncanny accuracy. The player ""Set Shot"" has the number 2,036 on the back of his basketball jersey. This is a little known trivia fact about this movie: the number 2,036 is the former Guinness world record for sinking consecutive practice free throws. It was established long ago by Ted St. Martin of Jacksonville, Florida. Ted currently has greatly increased this record. Ted's present Guinness world record for sinking consecutive exhibition free throws is 5,221. The character nicknamed ""Set Shot"" in ""The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh"" is in honor of my close friend Ted St. Martin. In this movie ""Set Shot"" is also seen riding in a vehicle by himself with a funky looking portable basketball hoop contraption on the back of the vehicle. The number 2,036 is shown on the vehicle.
  I thoroughly enjoyed some of the flashy basketball showmanship in this film. I perform one-person basketball trick shooting comedy shows myself. Consequently, I find this type of basketball movie entertining. I highly recommend you see this wonderful basketball comedic mayhem movie!",1034467200,11,1776,5.44
341010,3,6301650425,"Once upon a time in 1979, there was a pittsburgh team that was not...so...good. But then, a boy (James Bond III, not to be confused with the fictional character) meets a female astrologer and turns those Phythons into the Pisces. Every time a home team scores, a sound effect is heard, very cheesy. Also, look for basketball players past and present when that year the movie came out. I saw it on ESPN Classic, but i liked it!",1018915200,,426,4.4743589743589745
341011,4,6301650425,"I liked this movie! It's about a fictional NBA team that struggles to find a winning ""chemistry.""
It could be argued the flick was better suited for the small screen: no (then) ""big name"" actors/actresses; small production values; occasional slapstick dialogue and performances; etc.. Put it all together, though, and the whole proves to be greater than the sum of its parts. I think it's worth viewing.
""The Fish"" is one of those ""overlooked"" family films that more people should see. In addition, it has an uplifting message and charm of its own. Add that to the b-ball scenes, including some ""legends"" (Abdul-Jabbar, Hawkins, Lanier and more) plus the soundtrack, and it gets a ""thumbs-up"" from me. The sight of Dr. J's character, soaring and dunking in ""slo-mo"", at an outdoor court in his street shoes, is priceless!
The soundtrack is a big ""supporting character"" in the film. It's rare in that the tunes were specifically written for and relate to the movie. (How often do we have soundtracks comprised of cuts tossed in like salad ingredients, but have little to do with the story line?) Many of the jams also have a positive and self-affirming flavor to them. Artists include William Hart of The Delfonics, The Four Tops, Phyllis Hyman, The Sylvers and trumpeter ""Doc"" Sevrenson (of The Tonight Show) blowing his lungs out in a killer instrumental for the ""menacing"" Los Angeles team!
If you don't know about this movie, you better ""ask"" somebody!",1002153600,7,1455,4.91869918699187
341012,4,6301650425,"This really can be called a feel good movie.  You have a horrible underdog basketball team that uses a brilliant child, a mystic, the dunks of Dr. J, and astrology to overcome the odds by building a winning team of pisces players.  This movie is full of NBA players for the purist, including Kareem Abdul-Jabbar; and also adds the B-Ball stylings of former Harlem Globetrotter great Meadowlark Lemon to make a wonderful mixture of basketball wizardry!  Oh, and I can't forget the work of the BEAUTIFUL and talented Debbie Allen in the dance scenes!  The soundtrack is also outstanding!  I give this movie ""two thumbs up,"" and it has nothing to do with me being a pisces!",994896000,,670,4.6923076923076925
341013,2,6301650425,"I remember seeing this on Thanksgiving Day, and sitting through three screenings. My mother had to come in the theater to get me and my cousin. We missed Thanksgiving dinner AND ""Welcome Back Kotter"".
Oh, the movie itself. I loved it as a kid. Now...well, I have to say it's stupid. BUT I will put it in the VCR from time to time for kicks.
Maybe they can remake this film with the cooperation of the NBA, and maybe put Shaq or (ugh) Michael in the role of Moses...
Oh forget it.",984614400,,479,4.217391304347826
341014,1,6301650425,"This movie could have been the true life story of the Pittsburgh Pipers of the ABA.  The Pipers suffered at the gates due to the competition with the Phantoms of the NASL and the Penguins of the NHL, who both entered pro-sports the same year the Pipers entered the ABA.  It's a testiment to the un-popular sport of Basketball in Pittsburgh.  The movies only saving grace is that is has to do with Pittsburgh.",978912000,,408,4.486486486486487
341015,5,6301650425,"I haven't seen this movie in years and yet still, I am a huge fan of it.  I have been looking for a copy to buy with no luck.  To see that it is available through amazon is wonderful.  However, it saddens me to learn  that Warner has ""redid"" this movie by cutting out some of the  parts that add spice to the movie.  If there is an orginal copy where I can  still purchase it.  By all means let me know.",963532800,4,403,3.8292682926829267
341016,1,6301650425,"Please do not purchase any copies of Fish, unless Warner Bros. has fixed & re-released this video the right way, the original way it was released on video. Warner bought the video rights from Karl Lorimar video,  kept the same box with Lorimar's name on it & released the video  edited, the same version Turner puts on his station (Hmmm. Turner=Time  Warner) This movie was not released by Lorimar like this, there are a  couple of scenes missing and the language(trash talking) is gone. It was a  harmless PG movie that unless aired for television, was harmless in its  original version, This saddens me that Warner would do this, so if Warner  has fixed this problem, then great, TRADE ME! (like Tucker says) I want a  copy of the original version, I have recorded the Lorimar version on video  and my store bought Warner copy collects dust, I refuse to watch it. So  there you have it, I'll stop rambling now..",946944000,30,913,4.614906832298137
341017,5,6301650425,"Being a Pittsburgh native, I found this movie about a fictitious Pittsburg basketball team heart warming. Dr. J's performance was above the rim, and the supporting cast took the movie into over time. I loved it. The only  thing that could make ""The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh"" any better  is its release on DVD.",945388800,2,311,4.7407407407407405

7813364,5,6301650425,"Growing up in the 1970's, times were great. Big Wheels and Green Machines. Bomb Pops to Italian Ice. Mr. Softee and those amazing soft serve ice cream cones with sprinkles. Metal roller skates and banana seat bicycles. But nothing speaks more of the 70's than the movie, ""The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh"". In a time when things were more simple, The Fish, told a tale of a basketball team who needed a miracle, a found in the cards or should I say Psychic. Needless to say the moral of the story is about beliefs. It's OK to have beliefs in other things as along as you believe in yourself first. Now that I live in Atlanta, finding this great comedic tale was certainly an excellent find. ""The Fish"" reminds me of those summer days and simpler times, yet again saving me from what's going in the world today, if only for an 1 hour and 20 min.",1226275200,,842,4.369426751592357

7813366,4,6301650425,"It is all in an astrological sign to make hardwood stars.

This sports comedy features some great comics - Jonathan Winters & Flip Wilson - great musicians for the soundtrack - Doc Severinsen, The Four Tops, The Spinners & The Sylvers - and an all-star cast of pro basketball players, with Julius Erving in the leading role as Moses Guthrie, in a special spin of a lousy team becoming a championship contender.

The Pittsburgh Pythons are so bad that ownership falls into the hands of young locker room attendant Tyrone Millman (James Bond III). With Guthrie as the only star - and not too popular with the other players - Millman has got to come up with a new plan, and fast.

It just so happens that Millman has a hobby in astrology and he hires astrologer Mona Mondieu (Stockard Channing) to assist in turning the franchise around. Mondieu says that all players must be born under the same astrological sign - Pisces - which conveniently is the same sign as Guthrie's, and that is where the impossible dream of the newly-named Pittsburgh Pisces going from worst to first sets sail.

Chick Hearn and Marv Albert do great jobs announcing the action, with Meadowlark Lemon (the Rev. Grady Jackson) nearly stealing the show with his wit. Jerry Tarkanian, Lou Hudson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Spencer Haywood and Bob Lanier provide the star power on the court and the Pisces' home floor is something to see.

The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh provides enough laughs and continued interest from fans to warrant Sony Pictures to finally release it on DVD.",1174953600,,1544,4.7894736842105265
7813367,3,6301650425,"My mother took my brother and me to see this at the movies.  In the 70's there were so few positive movies for African-American children.  As an adult, I had searched and searched for it, and, fortunately my husband found it and purchased it for me for my birthday.

To be sure, the plot isn't strong, but it doesn't have to be--it's got Dr. J (and a host of other 70's/80's basketball stars), Debbie Allen and the Sylvers! If you're at least 30, you can watch it and reminisce. If you have children they can watch it, too, since it doesn't have profanity or sex. And, its a story about the underdog overcoming adversity and the low expectations of others to succeed.",1116892800,3,667,4.450819672131147
7813368,5,6301650425,"In no way, shape or form is this a great movie, but it is funny and the soundtrack is awesome!  There are a ""couple"" of known actors, but mostly basketball players such as Dr. J, Kareem, Norm Nixon and a few others.  Keep an open mind while watching..",1082678400,3,251,4.208333333333333
