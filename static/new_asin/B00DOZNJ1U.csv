5839197,4,B00DOZNJ1U,"I have made this kind of review before. If you are a Bronson fan you will enjoy this flick, if not you may not. It is a Bronson vehicle that works well for the actor. Most of the other actors over do it a bit. The George Segal film is an OK film also. I would give this film 3 stars. If Bronson was not in the first film I would also only give it 3 stars.",1384300800,,355,3.6233766233766236
5839198,1,B00DOZNJ1U,I cannot believe that in 2013 someone still has the balls to release two previously unreleased classics with crappy VHS transfers. LOVE AND BULLETS in pan and scan (2.35:1 Scope) and RUSSIAN ROULETTE non-anamorphic letterbox. I've been waiting decades for someone to release LOVE AND BULLETS and this what we get. Shame on SHOUT FACTORY! and shame on ITV for allowing this debacle to be released.,1383868800,13,396,5.015151515151516
5839199,2,B00DOZNJ1U,"I just got a copy of this dvd, just for Love and Bullet. I was expecting at least a letterbox widescreen, if not 16:9. But this looks to me to be the same transfer as the Australian PAL dvd I bought years ago, just transferred to NTSC. (it's got that look...)
Better than having to limit myself to a multi-region player, I guess. But still...damnation!

Maybe it'll come out as an MGM Made on Demand disc like the White Buffalo did.

Pretty lazy release all the way around. The second movie isn't anamorphic and there are typos all over the back cover.",1382659200,17,552,4.401960784313726
5839200,3,B00DOZNJ1U,"Neither Love and Bullets nor Russian Roulette have had much luck on home video - the Bronson film has always been released in cropped versions while the Segal one has only been available either in an English-friendly Spanish DVD with soft picture quality or various German-only public domain releases. Sadly this new DVD double-bill doesn't take the opportunity to rectify matters.

Russian Roulette is one of the plethora of Anglo-Canadian co-productions from the mid-seventies and probably the best. The Anglo contribution is mainly supporting parts (a typically seedy Denholm Elliott, an unconvincingly accented Nigel Stock, Gordon Jackson) and behind the camera, with centre-stage taken by George Segal's disgraced Mountie (plain clothes, thankfully) caught up in a plot to assassinate the Russian premier during a visit to Canada.

The plot ticks along nicely enough but it's the quirky touches along the way that really stand out, with memorable little character moments putting a memorable spin on the conventional scenes we've seen in this kind of film a thousand times before (a tour guide reading her badly memorised shtick to Segal's sole cable car passenger, Segal accidentally killing a crook who's just about to spill the beans, Denholm Elliott stealing papers and putting his drinks on other people's tabs, a sweet little old lady having trouble memorising a message about the KGB). Directed by Peckinpah and Robert Altman's legendary editor Lou Lombardo, who was apparently as high as a kite throughout filming and only directed one more film (the finale was apparently largely the work of an uncredited Anthony Squire), it's a neat little movie rather than a great one, but that's more than enough here.

Unfortunately, while the DVD is letterboxed in the original 1.85:1 ratio, it's a non-anamorphic transfer, and a somewhat juddery one at times as well. No extras.

Not much love and not many bullets in Love and Bullets, which sees Charles Bronson's cop escorting Jill Ireland's gangster's moll (""I'm the best lay- ..dee"") across Europe to testify against mob boss Rod Steiger, who's presumably wanted on charges of overacting with an unlicensed stage stutter and find themselves pursued by Paul Koslo's half-deaf hood and Henry Silva's overpriced but not terribly effective hitman and his girlfriend Lorraine Chase. Married or not, there's no chemistry between the stars and, in a part that seems to be written for Dolly Parton, Ireland shows neither range or remotest sign of acting ability, which makes the journey feel longer than it should, and there's not really enough action along the way to liven things up (and even less in the version that played UK theatres which cut out some of Bronson's improvised weaponry). Pretty much the last Charles Bronson film to have A-list production values and an A-list director - at least until John Huston left the picture and was replaced by Stuart Rosenberg - it's nothing special. Still, Anthony Richmond's cinematography of the Swiss locations is very appealing and at least the weather stayed nice for them.

As with previous PAL releases of the film in Australia and the UK, the DVD is cropped fullframe (only the end titles are in the original widescreen) with no extras. Both films are included on the same disc.",1381968000,13,3285,5.144194756554307

5839225,4,B00DOZNJ1U,"""Love and Bullets"" is a good old 70's Charles Bronson action thriller.  Very unique direction by acclaimed director Stuart Rosenberg, known for his hard drama's ""Cool Hand Luke"" and ""the Pope of Greenwich Village"".  Like the swiss and Arizona locations, and good supporting cast including Michael Gazzo, Bradford Dillman and an off beat performance by the great Rod Steiger as an eccentric mobster.  My only problem is a minor defect with this dvd,  during the last four minutes of the film, it freezes up and jumps to the end credits, could be a defect in the dvd distributor.  They should check it out for future orders.  The second feature, ""Russian Roulette"" plays fine, and is also another good 70's thriller.  More dramatic though than , ""Love and Bullets"" and much more off-beat.  George Segal is terrific as the lead(I always loved him as an actor)a Royal Canadian police officer that tries to stop  a KGB assassination. Another fine supporting cast, including Denholm Elliot(Raiders of The Lost Ark) in an really odd performance and Richard Romanus(Mean Streets) as a rival assassin.  Nicely directed by former Robert Altman and Sam Peckinpah editor- Lou Lombardo, who only directed this and one other film in his lifetime.  Both films are wonderful late night double features.  Get the popcorn ready!",1433462400,4,1310,5.0418604651162795

5839231,3,B00DOZNJ1U,"Yeah, Love and Bullets being panned and scanned in 2013 seems ridiculous, although troublingly infers there may be no more widescreen elements out there -- I assume there probably is, some damn where, but it wasn't cost efficient to track them down.  I never saw L & B, but I imagine the Bronson fans would make this one the key title of the release.  Yet, for me, RR is the film I was waiting for, and at least it is widescreen, if not anamorphic.

Russian Roulette should've gotten the ""ehh"" anamorphic transfer that ""Tamarind Seed"" did on the other recent ShoutFactory double-pairing....it's an oddball film that a few of us seem to like, so I am very appreciative that it is released uncut in a proper aspect ratio, regardless.  It's an eccentric ""thriller"" with comic elements throughout and good performances.  Worth checking out for fans of 70s cinema.",1386028800,5,859,4.777027027027027

8595548,4,B00DOZNJ1U,"Love and Bullets is an average movie in my honest opinion, but for me, this DVD purchase is all about Russian Roulette. I had in fact bought this exact same DVD movie set quite a few years back but lost the original DVD following a house move 2 years ago. Despite UK licensing (ITV, which stands for Independent Television, the third UK TV terrestrial broadcast channel) the DVD has never been released in the UK. In addition, the DVD quality is only marginally better than VHS quality. I cannot see why ITV don't release the DVD on region 2. Until that day arrives when Russian Roulette can be fully remastered and released in some form of HD format (streaming or Blu-Ray) I'll just have to settle for this region 1 DVD (at least I have a multi-region DVD player). Russian Roulette is a great movie but the DVD quality is not great. For that reason I can only give a review rating of 4 stars out of 5.",1450137600,3,902,4.375
