8601185,2,B00E4V0F42,"This is an hour long Japanese art house vampire story. It is filmed in grainy black and white similar to ""Sin City"" with tidbits of color. It seems centuries ago a Roman vessel with a vampire on it landed in Japan. The descendants are half human and half vampire and remain dormant until aroused. Our main character hails from that line as her boyfriend arouses her with disastrous results.

In addition to suffering through an art house black and white film with subtitles, much of the film is done as a silent movie. The is most likely because the sound man quit and at that point they decided to pay homage to ""Nosferatu.""

This film simply didn't appeal to me.
