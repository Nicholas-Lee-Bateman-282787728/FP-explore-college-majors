George Page provides the 2-minute introduction and narrates portions of this video; the photography is by Michael deGruy who also narrates the rest.  Opening views provide deep-sea photography and slip in a definition of cephalopods. Michael deGruy journeys to Palau Islands to locate the nautilus by using a remote control camera to achieve its depth; brief video shows it on bottom landscape at 1000 feet deep [a reference is made to its extinct relatives--the ammonites that are never actually named]. The nautilus is unchanged since earlier fossils due to the uniform environment over the ages. This section ends abruptly when their boat sinks!

Cuttlefish are then pursued in Australia. Photography shows them emerging from eggs, feeding, mating by exchange of a spermatophore, and then the first photography known of a second male flushing out the spermatophores deposited by the first male. Then we go back to Galveston Texas where cuttlefish are studied for their ability to camouflage themselves with fast-acting chromatophores. Experiments show cuttlefish responding to TV images of other cuttlefish although viewers may confuse advanced ""language"" ability with this simpler ""signaling."" Squid modifications are discussed. Footage of a swarm of mating squid shows them mating, laying eggs and then dying. Egg cases are strangely not detected by predators. Squid is likewise well camouflaged around predators. The term ""thinking"" is poorly defined by the lecturer and this usage would not pass in most animal behavior classes. A courtship swim by a male and female ends with mating. Special cameras use infrared to tape the nighttime squid activity.

The theme now switches to the octopus and its ability to squeeze through very small crevices. Red octopus is shown hunting at night over (wet) land at the Australian Barrier Reef. The small but highly venomous Australian blue ring octopus is shown and the effects of its venom are enacted; footage also shows it stalking a mantis shrimp. Marine lore of the octopus is contrasted with reality. The Giant octopus is played with by a diver in the Puget Sound. An unmanned deep sea submarine dives in the Monterey Canyon off California and films: seep sea squid attracting sharks; ribbonfish, weird squids, octopus, and a huge squid. Animation is used to portray the 80-foot Architeuthis and sperm whale. Footage of the strange ""vampire squid"" that has spines rather than suckers form the final minutes of this program.

For the biology teacher, this program contains some unique scenes on the nautilus in natural environment, mating and eggs of cuttlefish, and the blue ring octopus. However, in the segment ""Creatures of the Deep"" in the series Life by David Attenborough, section 5 shows cuttlefish mating while using color changes and one male mimics a female to confuse dominant male, and section 6 shows a British Columbia coastal octopus finding a crevice to lay eggs and tends them until she dies. A higher level discussion of cuttlefish life history and the mechanism for controlling chromatophores nearly instantly is provided in the 2007 DVD NOVA: Cuttlefish: Kings of Camouflage. Both videos are more objective than the loose narrative in this Nature program, but this Nature has less need of correction than most Nature programs.

7882275,5,6305072434,"I knew virtually nothing about cephalopods before watching this video.  If you are reading this by some chance, I highly encourage you to buy this video and watch it.  I now know so much more about octopuses, cuttlefish and squid than I ever thought I would care to know.  But the amazing thing about this video is that I learned incredible amounts about life and the nature of it on this planet.  It gave me huge insight into many philosophical debates, and I was in danger of falling into the merciless grip of Eliminative Materialism before I saw this video.  After experiencing the level of wonder that these creatures possess, and the amount of love and respect that is given to them by the scientists who follow them, I know there is much more to life than just neurons.  A must see for any lover of anything.  This video, silly as it may seem to you, could quite possibly change your life, or at least the way you look at yourself and your place on this planet.  Humans are not the only ones who have got it going on, you know.",1014595200,5,1034,4.37696335078534
7882276,5,6305072434,"I teach a general zoology course (undergraduate level) and use this video each semester after our Mollusc labs.  As a landlocked institution, we are limited to using preserved cephalopods (squid, cuttlefish, octopus, nautilus).  I worry that this leaves many students with the impression that a cuttlefish or octopus is about as exciting as a rubber chicken. Showing this video helps tremendously.  The fantastic videography, quality information, and diversity of topics addressed leaves students spellbound.  I have had students ask to borrow the video so that they could take it home to show their friends....that's a rare thing in a biology class. I cannot imagine a better video for getting students excited about cephalopods.",1004227200,3,730,5.433628318584071
7882277,5,6305072434,"This one is well worth your money... exceptional underwater footage provides the first vivid illustration of cephalopods and their phenomenal behaviors in the natural setting. Exquisite, fabulous creatures! Interesting narrative.  Marvelous demonstrations of color and postural changes, behavior as prey and as predator. Due credit to ROV's for this glimpse of the most elusive!",980380800,2,378,6.0
7882278,5,6305072434,"Beautifully photographed and engrossingly presented, Mike deGruy's fascination with and affection for these wonderful but seldom considered  animals clearly shows. A talented film-maker, originally trained as a  marine biologist (he left grad school to make films), his background gives  his films an interesting personal perspective not usually seen in garden  variety documentaries, where omniscient detachment is the rule. That  background raises this film to a level all nature documentaries should  favorite documentaries (and as good as any by Attenborough). I've heard  that deGruy is now working on a new film on octopi.  If it's as fun as this  one, it'll be a winner.",942969600,6,677,5.495145631067961
