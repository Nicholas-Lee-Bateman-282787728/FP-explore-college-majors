8391623,1,B0038P1D50,"I did not receive what I ordered.  I ordered Down By Law Collection ( 12 movies). I received Gunslingers 20 movies.  I ordered Down by Law because it said Marty Robbins was included.  Marty is not in the collection I received.  You must have been out of what I ordered and just substituted some other cowboy stuff I don't want.  It said on the package that to return it, it must be unopened. Before I noticed it was not what I ordered, I had already opened the package.  It was just $4.99, but it's very irritating.  Whoever filled the order just substituted without asking me.  Won't order from this vender again",1426464000,,613,4.45945945945946
