8282447,5,B001B9XWYA,"This DVD provides the basics and fundamentals for a wide range of drills which focus on sensitivity and reaction to an opponent's movements. Sammy takes you through a wide range of movements and gives great instruction for the strength behind each drill. This is definitely a powerful, stand-alone DVD, but if you're interested in further practice of tactile reflexes, I would also recommend this DVD in conjunction with Combat Energy Drills.",1386374400,,442,5.23943661971831
8282448,5,B001B9XWYA,"This DVD includes several fantastic drills for improving tactile reflexes for speed performance. Mr. Franco discusses the importance of speed training and reviews tactile sensitivity and reflex drills as well as other speed training drills.  The exercises in this DVD will help improve your reaction time in self defense and street fighting situations.  After practicing these speed training exercises several times with my training partner, I was more aware of my partner's movement and reacted quicker to his attack. Great DVD!",1245715200,,529,5.518518518518518
8282449,5,B001B9XWYA,Volume 2 of SPEED TRAINING FOR STREET FIGHTING shows great drills that are essential for developing your reflexes. Many martial arts schools do not practice honing  tactile reflexes. Anyone involved in martial arts can benefit from this DVD regardless of style. I will definitely be getting the other volumes of Speed Training.,1221782400,,327,5.288461538461538
