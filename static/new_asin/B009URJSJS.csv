8544442,4,B009URJSJS,"This was a very enjoyable show to watch. It captures her in her early career when she kept getting better and better. She performs a lot of her great songs she does with AKB. The only drawback for me is that there is so much ""MC"" or talking to the audience. Unless you speak Japanese the speeches will be lost on you.

I plan on buying all of her solo concerts. She is an amazing talent.",1469491200,,387,4.092105263157895
8544443,5,B009URJSJS,THIS IS THE FIRST OF 3 SOLO CONCERT PERFORMANCES BY YUKI KASHIWAGI AND IT IS A MUST HAVE FOR ALL YUKIRIN FANS.
