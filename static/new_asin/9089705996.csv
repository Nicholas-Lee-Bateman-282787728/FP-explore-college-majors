I would love to see more of these in small villages, etc, for days when I need a bit more than peaceful nature...but the scenery is very relaxing!",1491350400,,291,4.615384615384615

7901305,5,9089705996,"I purchased several of this product in the past and was so pleased with it that I returned to purchase more.  These DVD Fitness Journeys are the best for escaping from your workout routine while performing your workout routine.  I use it while on the treadmill but could use it for the stationary bike as well.  I purchased a 32"" flat screen TV with a DVD player and sound bar and mounted everything in front of the treadmill on a stand and when I start...I'm off on my journey.  For night selections, I'll turn the lights out in my basement gym and it's almost like you're right there taking in all the scenery.  As I previously stated...a great escape.  There are more DVD locations and I will be purchasing more in the future.  Highly recommend this product.  The DVD Fitness Journeys are a great product.",1462320000,4,808,4.524137931034483

7901307,5,9089705996,"This DVD offers plenty of variety for forest and nature lovers. You can walk along country paths, ride on roads by bicycle or just jog through nature. Here everything is lush green, sometimes there are palm trees on the roadside or other tropical trees, then here and there are a few houses that are also in the countryside. The massive limestones have impressed me. Bright blue sky and the sun accompany you. You feel as if you were there, the sounds of nature support this experience. Whether exercising on the treadmill, the exercise bike or just walk without an exercise machine, with this DVD, everything is possible. As a large forest lover I am excited about this DVD, it is definitely highly recommendable. The nature here is very relaxing and the natural sounds fit perfectly to what is shown.",1433376000,,802,4.776978417266187
7901308,5,9089705996,"There are 6 tracks on this DVD. I really like them all but I especially like Sunset Karsts and Through the Jungle. I love the walks ISIS Asia puts out, I've seen places I'll never see in real life, but this is one of two of theirs that I especially like. There are no walkers/ runners, and only a couple of cars and one motor bike. If they had not been in there, it would be perfect for me, as Forest and Bush Trails from them is. Definitely a five star video walk, because I love ""walking"" in the forests!!",1416528000,,507,4.08
7901309,2,9089705996,I own a number of Tony Helsloot's fitness walking dvd's.  Overall quality is great. This particular dvd had multiple parts on it which were also included in a number of his other videos.  Wish he would have gotten off this island to film more videos.,1367452800,,250,4.533333333333333
7901310,5,9089705996,I have around 11 of these and love them. When u have a problem or contact Tony he will get back to you on it. He is a very nice man. And He has some new ones coming out that are going to be great. I have seen the trailers. All I can say is WOW!!! Keep up the good work!,1363824000,,269,3.4262295081967213
