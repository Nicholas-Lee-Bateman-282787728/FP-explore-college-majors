The story methodically unfolds before our eyes and it is hard, if not  impossible, to look away. One cannot help but be drawn in by the  sensational visuals and heartpounding score. Cast is in top form here and  seems particuarly adept at handling the tricky subject matter. While  ""The Silence of The Lambs"" is a technically flawless piece of  cinema, ""Manhunter"", though not perfect, proves that watching a  movie can be like living a dream.",918172800,,586,4.8686868686868685

But it has a lot of likeable qualities for a crime drama. Most of the cinematography holds up quite well, though some of the stuff toward the end looks like a 70s B movie. You can see the greatness in the works. I enjoyed the story, but it's just not told with the finesse we now know Mann to have.

Only Lecktor comes through as a compelling character, the rest are just impressions.  Ok maybe farina and Noonan, but we never feel what drives the killer.  The 80s hair ballads wow.

743401,4,6303954103,"This movie screams, I am a 1980's movie right down to the crappy 80's music in the soundtrack and the addition a big shootout climax.
As a movie it is not bad except that it is forever locked into the 1980's style of film making that was suppose to be innovative but makes it a period piece instead.  The clothes look like Miami Vice leftovers, with pastel colors and styling, the houses look like palatial homes with lots of angular architecture, even Dollarhyde's dwelling.  The interiors of Dollarhyde's house with the giant lunar prints adorning it give  it a look of a Dead Heads idea of home decor.  Mann even uses the wrong Blake painting.  Thomas Harris was explicit in his choice as the The Great Red Dragon and the woman clothed  with the sun which is in the Brooklyn museum as that was a latter part of the plot.  Mann uses The Great Red Dragon and the woman clothed  with the sun:The devil comes down' which is in the National Gallery of Art.
Michael Mann named it Manhunter which is appropriate as it is NOT Red Dragon.  It focuses on Will Graham and not the Red Dragon of Thomas Harris's book.  Most of the film is concerned with Graham and how he copes with returning to tracking a serial killer after having been severely wounded, physically and mentally, by  Hannibal Lector and how he interacts with his family and coworkers.  Nothing is concerned with the killer or why he is a killer, he is relegated to a minor role, just an excuse to give Graham angst and have a big shootout at the end.
William Petersen is excellent as Graham and Brian Cox does a nice turn a Lecter (for some reason Mann changed the spelling to Lecktor).  I did enjoy the scenes of Lecter in his cell with everything being white, the room, the stairs, just about everything in the building.  Gave a startling contrast to Lecter.  I liked it better than the dungeon cell used in later films.
All in all it is not a bad film but it is too period bound and sometimes very talky.",1518825600,,1966,4.4222222222222225
743402,3,6303954103,"I thought this was a pretty good version of ""Red Dragon"" but a little different-- long time since seeing it so I can not compare directly but both are good. All movie stuff was above average and I liked Petersen a lot.  Was n't he a TV cop of some kind in the '90s?  Why wasn't he in more movies?",1518739200,,296,3.9166666666666665
743403,5,6303954103,"This is a superbly done film by Mann. Very true to the book, my favorite of Harris'. The visual choices are more interesting to me than the very fine Silence of the Lambs. Spoiler Alert (samples of the visuals that tap into the underbelly of the story): Graham's dead run down the repeating ramps with white railings after his first screen appearance with Lektor/Lector, Graham's imagined reconstructions of the murders, Dollarhyde's hallucinations of light shining from the eyes and mouth of the victim as he imagines a welcoming of his embrace, shots of William Blake's Red Dragon, the slow motion run of Graham in the dark towards the window in Dollarhyde's house, the spread pattern of the blood on the floor under Dollarhyde's body imitating the Red Dragon picture. There's a lot here and it's easy to see why it's become a classic, and the impact Mann has had on the crime film genre.",1518739200,7,890,4.785714285714286
743404,3,6303954103,"Manhunter, 1986 film

A flashlight illuminates a dark house. It awakens a young woman. Next two men sit by the ocean and discuss events. The older man asks for help to catch an unknown subject. The opening scene is repeated. A man takes notes on an audio recorder about the murders. Will Graham calls for fingerprints from the victims. Bite marks were recorded. What is the killers motive? The suspect has never been printed. Graham visits Hannibal Lecktor in prison for advice. Lecktor borrows a telephone to make a call to a University and gets personal information on Will Graham. Graham goes to Atlanta to inspect the murder house. A found note in Lecktors cell causes a reaction. Laboratory technicians inspect the found note. The ads in the National Tattler are used for communication, they can intercept it. Can they decipher the coded message? Only if they get the right book. Graham and the others prepare to trap the unknown subject. Will there be a mistake?

That reporter is kidnapped by the murderer! He boasts of his power and records a statement from that reporter. Then that reporter is released! They learn that Lecktor gave out Grahams home address! The police rush there, the family is safe. Graham tells about Lecktors murders of college women while acting as a psychiatrist. The murderer act when there is a full moon. Graham sends his wife and child out of state for a vacation. The story runs on. The murderer dates a blind woman in his home. [This is like padding.] Graham telephones Lecktor in his cell. Lecktors talks tells about his mind. Dollarhyde acts after watching that couple. Graham presents his analysis of the murders. How were the victims chosen? Graham notes some clues. How did the murderer know about his victims? There is something in common now. They check drivers licenses to get their suspect. Can they get there in time? Dollarhyde gets a shotgun and begins blasting away. But Graham stops him. Graham returns to his family for a happy reunion.

This is not better than The Silence of the Lambs even if it is derived from the same novel. Those who read the book can decide for themselves. This is a really weird movie in parts. It seems less dramatic than TsotL. The idea of a serial killer picking victims from a photo finishing business is scary. The story tells how police detectives trace clues. This is like a horror story where a monster preys upon people until it can be tracked down and killed; think of Beowulf.",1517875200,,2465,4.741258741258742

743458,5,6303954103,"It received nowhere near as much attention, as the rest of the films that deal Hannibal Lecter. However, it was the first to introduce to the characters  that said it was a scary movie. In addition, it is a good movie in its own right.

Hannibal Lecter is as memorable and is well acted, but he's scarier in a less cannibalistic way. He is a direct threat to the primary good guy, as we learn that he nearly killed FBI agent Will Graham and drove him to near insanity. Graham is the man responsible for apprehending Lecter, but to do so, he had to get further inside Lecter's head than was psychologically safe to do, and the audience is continually reminded throughout the film of that fact.  We fear that he is in grave danger of losing his sanity in the process.

To complement the terror, Lecter is playing his mind games, while theoretically helping Graham; he is also secretly helping the killer, known as the ""tooth fairy"". Notwithstanding dealing with the physical and psychological dangers presented by Lecter, Graham must also try to reconstruct the mindset of the killer, and this provides the real drama of this film. He is a man on the edge; he's been through psychological hell, as he, wants nothing more than to live in peace with his wife and son.

On the other hand, when his old boss Jack Crawford enlists his help, showing him photos of the murdered families, he cannot refuse. Besides throughout the entire film we are drawn into his struggle, the battle between his exceptional intellect for seeing into the minds of serial killers as opposed to his desire to maintain his sanity, protect his family, and simply lead a normal life.

As such, Graham is a far more convincing character than was Agent Starling. Although this movie has its flaws like its ""Miami Vice"" overtones, enough said there. An honestly frightening psychological thriller is definitely scarier than its more famous and critically acclaimed successor.",1503532800,3,1941,4.7791044776119405

All in all, Silence of the Lambs is still better, but this is still an underappreciated movie.  A must see for crime-horror fans.",1500854400,,366,4.515151515151516

743544,5,6303954103,"Superior to Silence of the Lambs in every way and which casts a long shadow over its pedestrian Brett Ratner remake, Manhunter tells the story of retired FBI Profiler Will Graham (a terrific William Peterson) who is reactivated to assist in capturing a serial killer dubbed The Tooth Fairy. Graham's unconventional methods include intimate crime scene role playing and consulting with a convicted killer to build a more precise psychological case study in anticipating the predator's next moves. Director Michael Mann ( ""Thief"" ""Heat"") takes a dogged procedural approach to the material (adapted from the Thomas Harris novel Red Dragon) that embeds the audience into Will Graham's process. It's fascinating. Although at times Mann's 80's aesthetic contrasts with the workmanlike narrative and the physical staging of the denouement is misguided, this film remains one of the more engrossing procedurals in modern American movies. Highly recommended",1499904000,,948,5.544827586206897

743548,5,6303954103,"Manhunter is an altogether outstanding crime/horror thriller from 1986. Written and directed by Michael Mann, it counts among its stars William Petersen, Kim Greist, Dennis Farina, Brian Cox, Tom Noonan, and Joan Allen. Based on the novel Red Dragon by Thomas Harris, this is the first film to feature Harris infamously murderous character Dr. Hannibal Lecter.

A grisly series of murders suddenly strikes two cities in the Deep South  Birmingham, Alabama and Atlanta, Georgia. In each case, an unknown intruder  nicknamed the Tooth Fairy by a scandal-mongering tabloid newspaper  has broken into homes in the middle of the night and has viciously slain everyone there. He tortures, mutilates, and kills each family member, using mirrors as his weapons. Thus far, he always strikes on the night of the full moon.

Former FBI profiler Will Graham (Petersen) very reluctantly agrees to come out of medical retirement to help solve the case, before the next full moon  which is three weeks away. Previously, Graham had caught the infamous Hannibal Lecter (Cox), and had almost been killed by the homicidal psychiatrist while arresting him. He asks Lecter, who is confined to a state institution for the criminally insane, to help him gain a greater insight into what motivates this still unidentified serial killer.  Lecter agrees, but only to further his own sadistically deranged agenda

Meanwhile, the killer continues planning his next crime. He has already identified his next victims from photos he has seen of them. But he puts his plans on hold  at least for a while  when he is attracted by a blind young woman who works in the same place he does

I enjoy a good crime thriller, and I thought Manhunter was particularly good. William Petersen (of later CSI: Crime Scene Investigation fame) delivers an outstanding performance as Will Graham. Dennis Farina is excellent as Grahams boss Jack Crawford, and Tom Noonan is very chilling in his role as the Tooth Fairy serial killer. In his all-too-brief scenes as Hannibal Lecter, Brian Cox imbues his character with sarcastic, menacing malevolence.

Although perhaps not quite as good as the later The Silence of the Lambs, Manhunter is nevertheless an excellent film that combines the best elements of a crime procedural, a thriller, and a horror movie. Every time I watch it, I can count on a sleepless night afterward

Highly recommended. (4 Stars ^ 5)",1495670400,9,2407,5.063291139240507
743549,5,6303954103,"I have been a cult follower of this film since it came out in 1986. I don't really get into these type of movies, but as a big fan of William Petersen from one of my favorite movies ""To Live And Die in LA"". Was the reason the I saw this movie in the first place. Also, as a big fan of Michael Mann and his music and style of the 80's. The photography in this movie is astounding. Brian Cox is superb in his acting skills unlike Anthony Hopkins pathetic over acting in  ""Silence of the Lambs"" which made it into a clownish cartoon movie that got WAY too much credit that it deserved. Stealing the credit from this movie. Which always annoyed me. This movie is far superior to the others on so many levels. The mood, acting, style, music, location, lighting, actors, etc. Tom Noonan insisting on being in character throughout the entire making of the movie made his performance very eerie and believable. The Blu Ray transfer is excellent! No grain as far as I can see. Nice extras with recent interviews with cast members. One mistake was the deleted scenes should have been in the theatrical version. Listening to the audio commentary by Mann. Even he wasn't sure why the scenes were cut. It would have only added maybe 5 minutes to the movie or less.  A great gem that stood the test of time.

743870,4,6303954103,A lot of my fondness for Manhunter is due to criminally underrated actor William Peterson's terrific performance. Like To live and die in L.A. he completely commands the screen. I don't think Manhunter is perfect and I prefer the far superior Red Dragon (which I also feel is even superior to the great Silence of the lambs) but its a very good first effort for the Hannibal films. Brian Cox's performance as Hannibal is interesting to watch as well. If you haven't seen Manhunter def give it a shot.,1470441600,,500,4.629213483146067

This movie from 1986 does a very good job as far as the acting and story goes. it is suspenseful and the treatment of the original subject is pretty close to accurate. I found just one scene to be very tedious and not to give anything away it was the ""date"" scene between the tooth fairy and the blind girl.

Shadows through Venetian blinds? You got it.  Petersen's house inexplicably lit by black lights? You got it. That beachfront designer house fantastically beyond the reach of ANY FBI agent, just as with Crockett and Tubbs' designer suits? Check.

HILARIOUSLY bad synthesizer score? It is here. As noted, only Cox as Lecter is bearable and his greatness makes the rest of the movie all the more intolerable.  I got this on a Tribeca subscription so I could chance it and also watch Miike's ""Hara Kari"" for 5 bucks.  I am counting this for free and still regret the time I wasted.

744059,5,6303954103,"Shout Factory did an excellent job in cleaning up the film and the audio just roars!  Hearing ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"" blasting through the speakers at the end sequence just sends goose pimples through your arms during that intense scene.  I can remember renting this film before Silence of the Lambs came out in theaters with some friends and we all got creeped out by this movie.  Who knew the guy that made the TV series Miami Vice could do such a great scary thriller?  Well, it made me a Michael Mann fan.  Some people are saying that they prefer Red Dragon with Edward Norton and that's ok.  I liked Red Dragon also.  But, this movie holds a piece of my movie going experience from the past and I thank the director and actors in the film for making it work.  The film does have an 80's TV look and feel but I love it.  It's a film I always go back to and Shout needs to be commended for giving this Blu-ray the respect it deserves.  Shout Factory, to me, is the new Criterion Collection Co.

744060,5,6303954103,"Finally this classic film receives special treatment. Previous releases have been a mishmash and a mess, usually poor quality and missing deleted scenes. This edition corrects previous mistakes. Important scenes have been restored as well as the picture quality. Over two hours of bonus material.",1464134400,6,296,5.6
744061,4,6303954103,"I am a movie fan. Plain and simple, while most people fell into this phase when computers and blogs became a popular thing, I been there since I was 4 years old. My parents did not need a babysitter most of the time, they put us in front a movie screen and me and my little brother were drawn to it. While these days, I see people posting their collections and bragging at what they got, I remember way before me on a website doing it, but mine was not given to me for free, but movies I did support. Some I had to make long drives because my local dealer did not have them for purchase. When labels like Shout Factory releases titles like Manhunter, my inner geek just comes out immediately. I can remember where I was and who I was with when I first saw this film. Little did I know then, that 5 years later Manhunter would be a way bigger deal with the introduction of Silence of the Lambs. Silence of the Lambs just changed the rules for horror films with the Academy. I can remember walking out on opening day of Silence of the Lambs and immediately going to my local video store to re-rent Manhunter. Michael Mann has this style and charm to his directing that you become intoxicated with the scenery, the city and most of all just the poetic delivery he captures when he romances the screen with his stories. This is an adaptation of Thomas Harriss very famous novel Red Dragon. The film centers on F.B.I agent Will Graham and the way he tracks down people. While at times the story does not make much sense, it is just so intense and intoxicated you tend to let things slide a bit.

This film, along with Band of the Hand and To Live and Die in LA, I can just watch over and over and every time they will just manipulate me and leave me feeling like it was the first time I seen the film. Will is wanted for a case to find this brutal monster of a person, because he caught another psychopath and he has a way of doing his job that people see as a positive. We meet the killer known as  the tooth fairy around the midway point of the film, and if you thought the F.B.I agent was not on all cylinders, the killer is more mental than downright sad in a way than I was expecting. In terms of comparing this to Silence, I liked Silence a little bit more because I saw it before it was doused down with hype and praise. Manhunter though is an easily second best film. I am one of the few people who really enjoyed the future installments of this story. Though I will admit Ridley Scott did go a bit overboard with his loud and obnoxious sequel later down the line. Maybe the release of this film would open the door for people to discover this lost gem and really have fun with it. It is not a perfect film nor does it need to be, but for what it is, it is an intoxicating at times tense scary little ride.",1463616000,5,2809,4.161764705882353
744172,4,6303954103,"There are at least three unforgettable scenes from MANHUNTER that easily stand the test of time from the burning wheelchair speeding through the indoor parking garage, to the ""misinterpretation"" (through the eyes of serial killer) of couple in entrance of doorway (they are NOT a couple), to of course the sterling finale under the guise of Iron Butterfly's ""In A Gadda Da Vida"" -- still gives me goosebump-chills (as well as that glass shattering thrill).  Not your typical, hero saving entrance, for sure.
Manhunter, (it can be easily argued) is the most stylized, artistic of any serial killer movie ever made.
Michael Mann put this together (wrote screenplay too) just about the time Miami Vice's cool style would become vogue (It didn't last too long, thank God) with MANHUNTER becoming somewhat of the model for what was cool about Miami Vice (for about one season...tv show lasted WAY too long).
But, take a look at MANHUNTER, again, and take notice of the finer points of cinematography with MANHUNTER'S own Dante Spinotti.  It's only a ten minute interview but you might be surprised to want to hear more about why Spinotti ""colored"" the rooms this way or that way.  Ah, that ""romantic (nighttime) blue""...
The other featurette is 18 minutes of interviews with the star actors; Tom Noonan's standing out.  He did not interact with anyone, really, to help emote the ""killer"" image he would display toward other actor's ...
I also enjoy seeing rather ""infamous"" mistake in editing scene in grocery store when star William Petersen (Graham) is talking to his son (Kevin Seaman) about psychological problems.  But, look how aisle changes background products from Carnation Milk to JFG and Maxwell House Coffee (they had stopped walking, trust me) behind the son; and Petersen is suddenly by the fruit cocktail stuff.  Hey, what happened to the Total and Bran cereals?!
Another scene has Petersen suddenly talking with cig in his mouth (it appears like magic) in a scene 'right after' tossing butthead reporter (Stephen Lang - cliched performance, but his begging for life scene is palpable) onto car.
All said I like MANHUNTER better than Silence of Lambs for being the original Lecktor (Lecter in ""Silence Lambs"") movie that is less contrived than Hannibal's eventual star-studded, cultural icon status.  Freddie Kruger anyone!?  And Jodie Foster should never have been at that house at the end with serial killer in a drag-it-out, both of them should have already shot each other ... sorry didn't really want to start raving about ""Lambs"" annoying conclusion flaws ... ""Dr. Lecter ...  Dr. Lecter...Dr. Lecter... Dr. Lecter...""  SHUT UP already he's not on THE PHONE anymore, God damn it, you knew Lecter was still loose out there, some where... (Sorry, couldn't help it ...)
I also liked the MANHUNTER soundtrack, mood synthesizers (despite the closing credit ""Heartbeat"" song, have to admit, gotta turn it off about 2 min in as Heartbeat is repeated 22 times ... or so it seems...).
Great to see (and hear) again.  4 1/2 stars.",1462924800,9,3036,5.003968253968254
744173,5,6303954103,"Classic Michael Mann - if you like the cinematic style of Miami Vice (show or movie) or Heat, with wide, dark-tinted scenescapes, this is your next movie.  We meet Hannibal Lektor (spelling in this movie's credits, I believe), and don't let Anthony Hopkins' portrayal bias you!  Great acting all around, with a standout performance by William Peterson - makes me wonder why he didn't go on to greater things after this.",1462838400,12,419,4.887323943661972

None of the characters have either the intensity or the acting prowess of the actors in Silence of the Lambs. Manhunter is more than a generic thriller. But it is not a particularly memorable movie.

744999,3,6303954103,"I'm a huge fan of Michael Mann.

And for a 1980s film on its own this is actually not bad even considering the cheesy 80s soundtrack.  However, if you are a fan of Thomas Harris and the book Red Dragon, for which the film is based then you may have some issues, as it does not totally follow it.  It is stringently followed in some areas even to the point of dialogue, but some of the most awesome parts of the story is left out, but it is almost equally entertaining to contrast the differences between this film, and newer version Red Dragon, and the television series Hannibal.  Which I noticed took quite a few things from this version of the film.
If you're going in fresh on a weekend watch it's totally worth a look, after all it's Michael Mann... man:)",1456617600,,760,4.330985915492958
745090,5,6303954103,"I noticed some complaints that this movie lacks action and horror.  If you watch this without being at least mildly frightened, you're either made of sterner stuff than me or you lack imagination.  When I first saw this movie I was a criminal intelligence analyst and had other law enforcement experience as well.  Even so, this movie bothered me.  It graphically brings home the truth.  Monsters are real.  They live among us and walk among us everyday.  Worse in some ways is that they are not readily identifiable as monsters.
From a law enforcement and forensics viewpoint, this movie is much better than the later RED DRAGON.  The day after I saw the movie, I called on the director of our state crime lab to ask questions and discuss the forensics in the movie.  It got things right for the time that it was made.
 For several months after the movie, I wouldn't let my wife go outside alone at night unless she was armed.  Then I read RED DRAGON and wouldn't even go out to feed the dogs unless I was armed.  You may think that strange but I know a fellow who was always armed, even taking a stainless steel revolver into the shower.  Of course, at the time, he was investigating a thug who was arguably the most dangerous major criminal in the state and one of the most dangerous in the Southeast.  I'm not sure how many people he had killed but if you add in the ones he had someone else kill for him, he made Billy the Kid look like a piker.

745247,5,6303954103,"A solid beginning to the series. Peterson kept us entertained and Tom, the serial killer, broke the stereotypicalserial killer mould. So on several levels it holds up nicely against the more lurid and sanguine, overhyped and over acted Silence of the Lambs. Manhunter is not lurid or gratuitous but does stretch the envelop of on-screen visceral displays of a serial killer's insanity. Silence of the Lambs was gratuitous in several luridly ghastly scenes. So, where Manhunter may appear timid compared to the bloody and cannibalic Hannibal circus of Silence of the Lambs in which Jodie Foster is a mere straightman to Hopkins' campy funny man cannibal, Manhunter  is a more an attempted study of the nightmarish task of tracking down and stopping a serial killer; and Peterson, as opposed to Foster, actually plays a person, rather than a prop, with an empathetic talent used by enforcement agencies to see into the driving computation of the serial killer.

You are probably familiar with the plot so I needn't go there. As a free movie on Prime videos, this one is certainly worth watching to compare and contrast, so to speak.

746157,5,6303954103,"I saw this movie in a theater back in 1986 and it was quite an experience. This was something new. something different. Serial Killers were something new in mainstream terminology? Author Thomas Harris attended classes and talked to FBI agents at the FBI Behavioral Science Unit and learned about Offender Profiling and the FBI's role in these investigations, which led to the writing of his second novel 'Red Dragon' in 1981, the book in which 'Manhunter' was adapted. Insight into the mind of a serial killer was new at that time for the movie going public. This wasn't a Freddy Kruger, Michael Myers, Jason Voorhies take on the subject. This was the real deal. This was about real monsters that the public, perhaps, was not ready to learn about. But this wasn't a monster movie. 'Manhunter' released in 1986, was also an FBI procedural, demonstrating the study of the human psyche and, at that time, the high tech techniques in forensic investigations. Of coarse all of that will be lost on a newer generation because the genre has 'evolved' quite a bit since 1986 and even TV police procedurals like CSI are now more high tech than this movie. But, back in the day this was the movie that planted that seed.
Of course, it's Will Graham and his particular gift that is the real star, his deepening involvement and unwavering resolve - if not outright obsession - that leads him to a startling realization at the films pinnacle moment that is so well put together and performed by Peterson, I find myself smiling at my screen every time I see it. It is still just as powerfully compelling today as it was 30 years ago.

The cast is perfect- Even the actor who portrayed Hannibal Lector (Brian Cox) is spot-on and creepy. Yes, I know, Anthony Hopkins is considered the best Lector. He won the Oscar, I know, I know... but check out Brian Cox's performance. Look in his eyes as he delivers his lines- Truly Unforgettable. Dennis Farina, coming from a law enforcement background, as FBI Agent-in-Charge Jack Crawford is Perfect. Will Graham, retired FBI agent and man with the special gift that keeps him on the edge of sanity - could not have been portrayed more believably than the intense performance of William Peterson. Certainly Edward Norton's Will Graham pales in comparison. Also, check out Stephen Lang as reporter Freddie Lounds. This guy is a chameleon in movies. You won't recognize him from one film to the next (Manhunter, Gettysburg, Tombstone, Avatar). Tommy Noonan is both scary and sympathetic as the ""Tooth Fairy"", the killer on a lunar cycle. The film strays away from the book slightly but that isn't a bad thing, in fact, In my opinion Director and screenwriter Michael Mann should have been nominated for an Academy Award.

The Music and clothes styles date this movie the most. In many instances they scream ""THE 80's!!!"". Cool back in the day. Today- It tells it's age. However, as a film score aficionado, some of the more intense and investigative background music still holds up well. The music in Lector's cell, as he studies the case file, is still just as maddening (as intended).

Although this movie failed at the box office (I believe because audiences weren't yet ready for this subject matter), it has been sited as the inspiration many other movies and TV shows that came later, including Silence of the Lambs, Seven, The X Files, Profiler, CSI, Copycat, Unsub(TV show), and more...
For fans of this movie; it can be remade under a different name, or re-performed by more accomplished actors(debatable) to play the leads, or updated, for a more contemporary audience, but the public only had one film that introduced this subject matter to them in all it's cold psychotic beauty, and that was 'Manhunter'.

MY QUESTION, for those who have read this far into my ramblings, I had purchased Manhunter on VHS originally, then when the DVD was released, I noticed that scenes that were in the VHS edition had been removed from the DVD Edition. Nothing huge, but very memorable lines like Will Graham explaining to Crawford that ""The woman had a bloom on her"" and "" Do you think thats a contradiction Jack? Does that kind of understanding make you uncomfortable?"".
Does anyone know if those scenes are back in the movie, in the Blu-Ray edition?

The film is directed by the same guy who brought us ""Miami Vice"" and it definitely shows with the use of pastel colored clothes, South Florida scenery, an atmospheric synthesizer score by Tangerine Dream and a lot of actors who appeared on the show.

Yes, I love the entire Hannibal Lector series of books, movies and audiobooks (but despise the TV program) but this move pre-dated the success of Silence of the Lambs by five years and Red Dragon by seventeen years.  While I love Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal, I still very much agree that Manhunter is a far better movie in every way that Red Dragon ever hoped to be.  Finally the score; artists like The Prime Movers, Red 7, Shriekback, and others with songs like Strong As I Am, Heartbeat and This Big Hush drove the intensity of the movie's events home like few others I have ever watched and heard.

746500,5,6303954103,"Michael mann's MANHUNTER, more of a suspense thriller than an actual Horror
infact there's no Blood or Gore just lots of suspense & some action scenes
Michael mann was executive producer of Miami vice for seasons 1 & 2
but then left in 1985 to make & director MANHUNTER
so that's mainly why the look & style of MANHUNTER is mainly influenced by Miami vice
well MGM/20TH CENTURY FOX first released Manhunter on blu-ray back in 2011
but with barebones treatment so there was only Theatrical trailer
the same year U.K. Distributor Optimum reissued the film on blu-ray for the U.K. buyers
but with special features, the extras were carried over from the very old Anchor bay dvd
which included the Theatrical & Directors cut of the film in HD
plus Michael mann's audio commentary & the 2 making of featurettes INSIDE MANHUNTER & THE MANHUNTER LOOK
which was recorded way back in 2001-2002 for the Anchor bay dvd
well Shout factory now own the rights to the film and reissued it over 2 Disc collectors edition blu-ray for the U.S.
but shout factory didn't do much effort except for adding new special features
Disc 1 has the 2:35:1 HD transfer Theatrical version carried over from the 2011 MGM blu-ray
so SF did not enhance the HD transfer they just carried over the MGM HD transfer
there are new interviews on Disc 1
MIND OF MADNESS- interview with actor william Peterson-18mins
COURTING A KILLER- interview with Actress Joan Allen 16mins
FRANCIS IS GONE FOREVER- interview with actor Tom noonan- 22mins
EYE OF THE STORM interview with D.O.P Dante spinotti 35mins
THE MUSIC OF MANHUNTER new 42min featurette on the films music score
THE FIRST LECKTOR which is new interview with Actor Brian cox who played Hannibal Lector in Manhunter-40mins
and then you get the usual Trailer & stills Gallery
Disc 2 is the Directors cut version in 2:35:1 ratio with 2.0 Master audio stereo mix
 which runs at 124mins, maybe 2-3mins of extra footage that was cut from the Theatrical cut
shout factory did give the Directors cut a new 1080p HD transfer cause it's been carried over from the anchor bay dvd
so the picture quality is much sharper & clearer than the old Anchor bay dvd
but the added inserted scenes are only in Standard definition or Digitally remastered transfer footage, not HD
 tragically how pathetic really, what's the point giving the D cut a new HD transfer
when you don't give the added scenes HD treatment aswell, makes no sense pretty stupid decision
the extras on Disc 2 are carried over from the very old Anchor bay dvd
which is the very old Michael mann Audio commentary
and the INSIDE MANHUNTER featurette with actors Joan allen, William peterson, Brian cox & Tom noonan
and the MANHUNTER LOOK also from the very old Anchor bay dvd
so is this new blu-ray reissue worth buying, yes it is
all the special features content from the very old Anchor bay DVD are carried over
plus you also get new extras aswell
so scrap the old Anchor bay dvd and buy this new blu-ray 5 stars for this new blu-ray",1426118400,5,2997,4.66351606805293

That may also be the case as it was made in the time where Miami Vice was the most popular thing on television.  At any rate I like the movie,1425254400,,375,4.04054054054054

746578,2,6303954103,"Moviegoing audiences get their first peek at Hannibal Lecter in this underachieving early adaptation of Thomas Harris's first novel, Red Dragon. Brian Cox is first in line to tackle Lecter, but seems misdirected. He comes off as just some guy in a cell, not the overwhelming, absurdly intimidating presence he is in the book or, later, in the expert hands of Anthony Hopkins or Mads Mikkelsen. That's not the only bit of directorial blunder. In fact, given the amount of star power involved in the film and the gripping power of the source material, it's a major surprise that it's all so blunt, dull and empty. William Peterson (of later CSI fame) leads the show as Will Graham - bland, erratic and prone to nearly-comical mood swings - with a similarly underwhelming effort from character actor Dennis Farina as his supervisor, Jack Crawford. And it's not like the director is some hack. Michael Mann is typically very good behind the camera, but in this case he's just completely missed the mark. There's no underlying tension to the proceedings, none of the complicated character arcs that made the original tale so engrossing. Francis Dollarhyde, the fascinating maniac behind the string of murders driving it all, is cut off at the knees thanks to a criminal lack of exploration. His famous full-torso tattoo is left glaringly off-screen, the false teeth that become his trademark converted into a rudimentary, totally unexplained, side prop. As he falls, so does the film. Despite the two-hour running time, it seems shallow and incomplete, rushed to an unsatisfying new ending that's painfully generic.

MANHUNTER: A vicious psychokiller has been slashing entire families in some bizarre ritual, and FBI agent Crawford (Farina) wants Will Graham (Petersen) on the case. Wills still scarred emotionally from capturing (and being cut up by) Hannibal The Cannibal Lecktor (as its spelled here) (Cox). But the FBI needs Wills special talent: recreating a psychos thought process, so it can be predicted and prevent more murders. Will visits Lecktor to recover the mindset, but Lecktor, in contact with the killer, has a personal agenda. Finding his own family at risk, Wills sanity is pushed to its limit as he pursues the psycho in a race against the clock with an intensity bordering on obsession.

Discussion: Grim, tense, occasionally grisly but always stylish, this is in essence a modern noir recast in pastels and bright primary colors. At times its a fascinating, fast-paced police procedural, but often it offers much more, as in the scene where Will attempts to explain his psychic scars to his young son, in language the boy can understand but which won't pass on the same wounds; an explanation of the fringes of human experience counterpointed by the mundane setting of a grocery store cereal aisle.

Manns direction is assured and rhythmic: Internal torment punctuated by crescendos of tension-relieving violence. The plot is convoluted and the logic acceptable, but these are secondary to the brooding mood and our sense of Wills agonized understanding that both his physical and psychic survival are at stakeand that the only edge he has in his battle of wits with the brilliantly insane Lecktor is his sanity...which is rapidly vanishing.",1423180800,,1823,5.029801324503311

However, the acting in Silence of the Lambs is far superior, especially the portrayal of Hannibal Lecter by Anthony Hopkins. If you buy into critiques like the one printed on this box, you may very well be disappointed.

Being a huge fan of everything high-def and especially 1080p, I was looking forward to the transfer from MGM's DVD release a decade or more before. When I played the film, I noticed that it still was grainy and looked the same (with a few exceptions) as the DVD, plus the booklet that was in the DVD release was gone (an insert with liner notes would've been nice). The noticeable difference was in the audio transfer, superior in every aspect. It gave me a new appreciation for the song ""In a gadda da vida"".

William Petersen is an FBI profiler brought back from semi-retirement to hunt a killer, even though he is still traumatized by the last case he solved, that of Hannibal Lector, played by veteran actor Brian Cox. What I like about Manhunter is the slow pacing as the team slowly sorts clues and tightens the noose around the mystery killer. There is a slow-burn to a climactic ending. The procedural aspects of the criminal investigation in the movie gave birth to modern procedural crime thrillers, like CSI and Criminal Minds. What is ironic is how William Petersen both starred in the movie that really launched the genre, and then went on to star in CSI.

William Petersen is beyond brilliant here. I don't know why this film did not launch a mega-career for him. He's onscreen the entire film and carries it beautifully.

In my opinion this far excels the also very good remake. Petersen goes so deep into the serial killer's mentality that the process is both fascinating and unsettling. We can actually see the power of the pure evil he beholds circling his psyche, seeking some vulnerability by which to seize his soul. Petersen is at war not only with the killer, but with his own dark side.

The Florida scenes here are Miami-Vice cool, and not by coincidence. The film is fast paced and the suspense is gripping.
In its own way this film is as inspired, as powerful, and as memorable as the later Silence Of The Lambs.

This film is very re-watchable. Excellent cast throughout. The evil is palpable and plausible and convincingly, genuinely terrifying--and I don't scare easily.

This version of Red Dragon has some of the most erotic scenes in film.  I won't spoil them for you; I'll let you find them for yourself. Let's just say they are in unexpected places.  I haven't read all the reviews but at level 5 no one has mentioned Dante Spinotti the cinematogropher and this is one of his first ventures in american film.  He is a master artist (see Heat, LA Confidential, The Insider.)  The final scene, with it's Iron Butterfly accompaniment (don't ask me to spell it) just sticks in your mind as one of the all time great scenes in movie history.  Tom Noonan and Joan Allen are absolutely remarkable.  Watch the film for their performances alone.  William Peterson surpasses Ed Norton in every respect:  introspective, deliberate, intuitive. He is just fantastic.

Something that Criminal Minds echoes in a very important episode ""Psychodrama"" - which imparted that in the course of going about their business of bank robbery in lieu of invading China or implementing the Holocaust, the criminal found his true calling - his heart's desire - his style of devouring.

""He'll be back."" if he's allowed to live.  Always.

I highly doubt that despite the manhunter's talent for sussing out the mindset of the killer that he can ever actually adequately predict their malevolence hence Hannibal Lecter's instrumental assistance to the killer.  Hannibal Lecter should be in total isolation with no opportunity to communicate or interact with others.

Clarice Starling and Will Graham are shown to be the same characters because they are given the same lines.  This one here about the killer finding his groove is repeated in Silence of the Lambs and in both the film Hannibal and the new series Hannibal - both Clarice (played by Julianne Moore) and Will Graham (Hugh Dancy) deny to Hannibal that they want to take his life - just his freedom.

What must that be like for Hannibal Lecter to have Clarice echo Will Graham who must be old enough to be her father, correct?

Hannibal Lecter has a crush on Will Graham AND Clarice Starling.  How is that even possible?

The only reason I watched Manhunter (1986) its because Michael Mann directed it.  You know the guy behind Thief (1981), Heat (1995) or Miami Vice (2006). I like his camera work and the way he uses color and music in his long scenes.  But getting back to the movie, Manhunter perhaps was impressive in the 1980's but it does not shock these days.

Also read the book or watch the Red Dragon movie and you will see that the ending is different (even the other movie and the book are different because of whos body they found in the fire) but the ending in this movie is so off it is crazy! I will say that this version has a LOT of extra scenes that my special edition DVD did not and I liked that, but this is still not the version I like. The video is not great but look how old the movie is. I just hate that my DVD version had more special features and Manhunter changed the movie.

747363,5,6303954103,"Manhunter is a 1986 Michael Mann film based closely on the Thomas Harris book of a different name: The Red Dragon. This story is also a prequel to Silence of the Lambs... yet another of Harris's works touched by the brilliant and evil mind of the now iconic villain, Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lector. In Manhunter, it's actor Brian Cox who takes on the role of Lector. However, this is a character reprised a number of times by actor Anthony Hopkins with great success; his performance wins him several awards and notoriety.

A second, much later and more recent, film adaptation of the book Red Dragon also closely follows Harris's storyline, keeps the title The Red Dragon, and stars Anthony Hopkins as Lector. It seems like this second film adaptation of the book was produced just for the purposes of allowing fans to see Hopkins in the role of Lector once again.

What's arguably most interesting to note is that both film adaptations (Manhunter and Red Dragon) are incredibly 'almost' an echo of one another, aside from something of a mild variation at the end of one version... I won't tell you which, but one has an ending that more closely follows its written counterpart.

Director Michael Mann brings to the film his unique visual elegance: those long, panning shots, the effective use of color. It builds a tense and absorbing atmosphere. And, as a typical Mann film, the cast is strong. Petersen is perfect as Will Graham. The brooding face, the understated intensity--this is a haunted man. Noonan's Francis Dolarhyde is an unforgettable physical menace. Brian Cox's brief appearance as Hannibal manages to convey a supremely dangerous tone. Comparisons to Hopkins are inevitable.  Hopkins, however, had much more to work with. As a police procedural, the film is meticulous, giving the whole thing a disturbing authenticity. For some, the soundtrack might be a distraction, with its heavy synths that have an inescapable 80's quality, but I find that it enhances the film's mood. Ultimately, for me, Mann's film remains the finest adaptation of Thomas Harris' Red Dragon, easily surpassing the poorly cast and rather pedestrian remake from 2002.",1380931200,3,1204,5.336842105263158

I like William Petersen's rendition of Will Graham. You get the feeling he is a man on the edge of sanity. You get the feeling he likes what he sees when retracing the killer's steps and when he figures out how the killer did something. It's like he really understands what it's like to be a sicko, and he is holding himself back from becoming one. This makes the scene with Lecter make sense, when they talk of disadvantages and being like Lecter, you can really tell that Graham is literally teetering on the edge of sanity. Thus, the panic portrayed when Graham wants out of the cell was palpable to me.

Brian Cox's portrayal of Hannibal Lecter is very interesting to me. He is a fast talker and comes off as a sociopath, someone that you would meet on the street and think nothing of, even think of as cordial...scary because that's how they describe real serial killers!

Manhunter vs Red Dragon comes up in a lot in the reviews for this film, so my take: To me there is no comparing the movies, I like both, each for different reasons. Both are great portrayals of an interesting and exciting story!",1370563200,,1215,4.439461883408072

747731,5,6303954103,"Where do I start? This review is for Restored Director's Cut.

Manhunter is the penultimate movie. Michael Mann's best ever. Without a doubt he took this adaptation and took it to an entirely different level. The art direction, cinematography and acting are all first rate. No, it did not have the biggest budget, no it did not do well in the box office. So what? Every character conveyed emotion and I must say that I cannot get the movie out of my head. Part of the reason is because it was partially shot in my town. Another reason has to do with the style the movie was shot in. Mann knows his stuff and he conveys the power of the Harris's novel with aplomb!

Fans of Miami Vice will recognize character actors who guest starred on the show. Dennis Farina, Michael Talbott and a few others as well. The colors and art direction were remarkable too. Will Graham is an FBI man, but comes across as a regular guy which makes him likeable. He even empathizes with the killer as a child, saying: (In Another Version Of DVD) ""This started from an abused child, a battered infant..."" There is no doubt that the cerebral nature of this film went over the head of those who reviewed it in 1986. Yet it was the first movie of its kind that dealt with forensic analysis of crime scenes.

The soundtrack of the movie was incredible. I'm lucky a buddy at work was able to download the soundtrack for me from the internet. The music has unfortunately been out of print for decades. Each song captures the essence and soul of every scene and prepares the viewer for the emotions the characters are experiencing. Heart Beat and In-A-Gad-Ad-A-Vida are the best songs from the soundtrack.

I have not seen the remake Red Dragon, but I will say this: Tom Noonan's Francis Dollarhyde cannot be beat. Simply put, he is the most terrifying non-horror character I have ever seen. He plays the sinister heavy with a flair that I've never before seen. He plays similar roles in The Pledge and in Mystery Train. But it is this role where he shines. Ironically, his character is not introduced until halfway into the movie, yet he more than holds his own and by the end of the movie he takes out two cops and seriously injures two more. Wow! Noonan's height, weight and speech add to his malevolence in this film. Yet he is also a sad man. His background is not discussed in the movie, yet it had to have been a savage childhood. But like Graham says in another cut, ""As an adult he is irredeemable.""

I like this movie so much that I plan to purchase the other DVD versions. Buy this DVD and you will not be too disappointed. The extra added scenes have some rough edges and sound dropouts, but for me they were a bonus as I'd not seen them before. A couple lines were taken out that I did not care for, but all in all this is still a Five-Star show. Get it and you won't be disappointed.

It spawned and greatly influenced the FBI/Criminal Profiler subgenre that Harris gleaned from John Douglas, the former FBI director of their fledgling Criminal Profiling Unit formed in the seventies.

This movie is the forerunner of all the Hannibal Lector movies and those productions stole heavily from this Michael Mann effort.  William Peterson and Tom Noonan are standouts in performance.

747735,1,6303954103,"Having recently just finished the fantastic novel ""Red Dragon"" by author Thomas Harris, I very much anticipated seeing the film adaptation ""Manhunter""; that anticipation was quickly obliterated as I sat back and watched this horrendously awful film.

With films that are based on novels, one has to willingly accept that portions of the novel will be left out while the plot/script is changed around slightly. That's fine. In fact I don't mind when film producers make drastic changes from novels, it makes for interesting surprises, provided they're done properly.

With ""Manhunter"", everything that was changed from the novel either made no sense (from an artistic or entertainment standpoint) or it was just plain bad. I'm not entirely sure where I should begin because this movie is filled with more faults than San Andreas.

I'll start with the awful acting. The actors in this film lack presence, they lack impact, they lack passion, and by the end of the film the viewer just doesn't give a s*** about any of the characters. For me, the acting felt like something from a 1980's TV crime drama, not a Hollywood film. Before I came on here to review this film I was under the impression that this had been a made for TV movie. I was surprised to learn that it was in fact released to theaters. No surprise it totally tanked at the box office!

The main star of the film should have been Francis Dollarhyde, but unfortunately he gets something like less than 5 minutes of screen time in this movie. And instead of being portrayed as a frighteningly powerful serial killer (like in the novel), Francis comes off as a borderline senior citizen with special needs. In this movie he isn't frightening at all. He looks downright goofy and he appears to be too old, like he's in his 60's whereas the Francis in the novel, if I remember correctly, was in his 40's. So practically all the changes from the novel were for the worse, not for the better. Probably the most dissatisfying facet of the film was the lack of emotional connection to the characters, especially Francis. The novel does a pretty good job showing the inner turmoil that Francis is going through in the second half of the book, the film shows none of this. It is emotionally defunct.

Another enormously HUGE fault of this film is that it totally alienates any viewers who have not yet read the novel it's based on. If you've never read the book then you will not understand anything that is happening in the film. Although I read the book, I was still very turned off by this aspect of the film.

The changes made to the ending were absolutely terrible and very cliche. We end up with a typical shootout ending instead of something more thought provoking or intelligent. Who ever wrote the script or screenplay for this film was clearly an amateur, or just didn't put any heart or love into it. The are other absurdities in this movie, like the obvious advertisement for Folger's coffee when Graham's son picks up the coffee and places it in the shopping cart after saying ""You drink Folgers, right?"" or something similar to that. I was like...WTF!?...seriously? I've seen corporate advertising in movies before, but not one that was so blatantly obvious. How corny!

The soundtrack was far too low key and in no way did it help the film.
I actually did enjoy Hannibal's character, the actor who played him did a decent job but still comes up short when compared to Anthony Hopkins. The only thing I really liked about this film was the opening sequence which shows the perspective from Francis (as he's holding the camera) entering the Leedes family house before he kills them. That was genuinely terrifying to see.

Overall, this film does a few things right but does A LOT of stuff wrong.
In some ways ""Manhunter"" felt like a splice between a 1980's TV episode of Miami Vice and an episode of CSI. Except CSI and Miami Vice were probably much more interesting.

Honestly, if I'd never seen or heard, knew... anything about this story/movie/Hannibal Lecter this movie wouldn't have made any sense at all and been utterly boring.

The style may bother some people.  It is shot with various unnatural hues including violet, blue and green.  While they are perhaps not realistic they always seem to fit the scene.  Mann and his photographer place cameras in interesting places.  Take for example the Hannibal Lector's (Brian Cox) stark white cell.

This movie isn't really about Dr. Lector however.  It is about a serial killer known as The Tooth Fairy (Thomas Noonan - really creepy).  As Petersen struggles with his own sanity he homes in on the killer using his ability to get inside the killer's head.  He stole this theme for his ""Miami Vice"" TV series about this same time.

11/07: ""It's just you and me now, sport.""

I have long expressed my awe for Michael Mann because he is the best in business when it comes to style mixed with substance.

The influence of Miami Vice is all over Manhunter.

William Peterson plays a kick-ass character and is the driving force in this dark, brooding neo-noir.

The combination of Peterson's beard and eyes are drop-dead sexy, and his way of doing things elevates the film as a whole.

Dennis Farina also takes it to another level.

Villains come and go. Some have been memorable, yet a great many of them would vanish into obscurity.

But Tom Noonan as Francis Dollarhyde is unforgettable. He is even scarier and more chilling than Dr. Hannibal Lecktor who is marvelously played by Bryan Cox.

What makes Manhunter interesting is that it is not about Will Graham's day-to-day sleuthing adventure but how he allows the secondary forces to come in play while slowly pulling me into the story. Throughout, there is a contrasting mix of ""style"" and ""substance.""

If you want to understand the word ""genius,"" look no further than the ""Moment of the Truth"" scene when Will Graham begins to figure out the identity of the killer.

In reality, a serial killer may remain elusive for years and years. Hundreds of thousand man-hours have been logged in by the detectives, yet it only takes one trivial piece of evidence to crack open the case.

Sometimes, a lucky break may come through a traffic stop for a motor vehicle violation.

All in all, Manhunter is one of the greatest cinematic masterpieces.

6/11: Michael Mann sure knows how to make films.

He has directed very few that nearly all are bona fide works of art, and Manhunter is one of them.

The Miami Vice influence all over the neo-noir thriller is unmistakable.

William Peterson's look and style are numero uno when it comes to ""cool."" He is just perfect as Will Graham.

Tom Noonan's Francis Dollarhyde is an all-time classic villain.

Yet for me, one of the scariest images in film history is the opening shot in Manhunter, where a woman awakens to a flashlight being shined on her by the Tooth Fairy killer. Later remade into the woeful Red Dragon, this movie proves that yes, Edward Norton maybe a better actor than William Petersen, but he certainly isn't a better Will Graham! Michael Mann is a unique artist whose stylish matter of fact approach creates not only the best in the Lector saga, but the best in the serial killer genre, which includes doozies like the aforementioned Silence as well as Physco and Se7en.

After all the good things I'd read about it I was disappointed by the film's lack of suspense and charisma. There is a very synthetic feel to the whole production. As if we were watching reptiles in a glass cage.

The pacing is lethargic, the first ca. 20 minutes being especially tedious. Many more sequences that just don't add up. I found myself fast-forwarding several times, which usually indicates the editing needs tightening up. Well-paced films engage, but pace is not something Mann seems to have understood, at least not at this stage of his career.

The script is not particularly memorable. A good script might have compensated for the languorous pacing and allowed the actors to interact in a more dramatic, less voyeuristic fashion.

The wide angle aspect ratio seems wasted, with a lot of dead space. Everything looks scrubbed down and sterile. Like a made-for-TV movie in its bland, generic, compositionally unimaginative visuals.

Noonan and Cox are the reason I watched it. Unfortunately there's too little of Cox, and Noonan, for all his creepiness, can't quite break through the immaculate veneer of the film. So this is not a film I would add to my collection.

747834,3,6303954103,"Based on Thomas Harris' first Hannibal Lecter novel Red Dragon, Manhunter stars William Petersen as former FBI Profiler Will Graham who returns to duty to persuit a serial killer who slaughters families. Graham's unique asset in profiling criminals is the ability to become so intimate with their thoughts that they combat with his sanity. In order to get his ""scent"" back for these murderers, Graham visits serial cannibal Dr. Hannibal Lecktor played by Brian Cox. Graham was the one who caught Lecktor but he still fears Lecktor because of what he is and Graham continues to be terrorized by him to some degree through out the film. The killer in question, named Francis Francis Dollarhyde and played by Tom Noonan, slaughters these families and arranges their bodies to stare at him in awe according to his own fantasties. Dollarhyde feels that if he kills enough people he will ""transform"" into a being who would be accepted after feeling rejected all his life. This being Francis hopes become is The Red Dragon from William Blake's painting ""The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed with the Sun"".

Micheal Mann's adaptation of Harris' novel is serviceable but it lacks it certain areas. First off the atmosphere of the film is dark but at the same time Mann has that annoying habit of insisting upon the post modern aestetic of the time; cold and lacking in intimatcy and all bathed in white. Worst of all the 1980's pop songs date the film unnessecarily. I am not against films looking contemporary but here it's highly unessecary. The later day Lecter films all succeed in having a timeless look to them.

The characterizations are also questionable. William Petersen as Will Graham seems like a complex indvidual but he is written as more of a ""tough guy"" better suited as a cop in a Dirty Harry film or his previous effort in To Live and Die in LA and not someone who is truly, emotionally scared by what he does. Brian Cox does a decent job as ""Lecktor"" but he's forgetable in this film. He doesn't penitrate the screen at all. Cox certaintly comes off as a sociopath but not the the man so evil that professional psychiatrists simply describe as a monster. Lastly the biggest mis-calculation is Francis Dollarhyde. Mann entirely omits Dollarhyde's tragic childhood in his screenplay, the core motivation of Francis' sick fantasties, and makes him to be some sort of super human freak who can kill people with little effort. Tom Noonan just barely manages to capture the pathetic side of Dollarhyde but the character's credibility is all but destroyed at the end of the film. The finale has Dollarhyde pitted against a swat team who he blasts away with a shot gun and manages to survive several gun shot wounds which he shakes off easily. All this occurs with Iron Butterfly's Inna Godda Davida blaring in the background. Mann missed the point of the character entirely. He seemed more focus on making an extreme villian as opposed to a three dimensional person.

Mann's film isn't entirely bad. William Petersen does a good job to hold the film together and at times, there is a genuine feeling of suspense. It's a curiosity in the Lecter series but far from the best.",1288051200,2,3182,4.7923497267759565

747841,5,6303954103,"MANHUNTER (1986) is one of Michael Mann's best films, which is saying a lot. Unique, stylish, provocative, sly, shocking, and superbly acted, this is the best film which contains the character of Hannibal Lecktor (as it is spelled in this film). It boasts three Oscar caliber performances (William Petersen, Tom Noonan, Brian Cox). Petersen is brilliant as retired FBI profiler Will Graham, brought out of retirement by his former boss Jack Crawford (well played by Dennis Farina) to capture a serial killer that goes by the moniker ""Tooth Fairy"" targeting families. Graham has the uncanny ability of getting inside the mind of his prey.

Tom Noonan plays the ""Tooth Fairy"" (real name Francis Dollarhyde) and this is one of the best portrayals of a sociopath ever put to film. Crawford visits imprisoned serial killer Lecktor (played with empty cold-bloodedness by Brian Cox) with hopes of gathering information that will help capture Dollarhyde.

MANHUNTER is as much a police procedural as it is a suspense thriller. There are many nifty details on the research and work that goes into actually catching a killer and bringing him to justice. Mann created the popular 80s TV show ""Miami Vice"" and you can see a lot the stylish look of that show in MANHUNTER, but MANHUNTER is 1000 times deeper than the deepest story you can come up with from that show! The excellent supporting cast includes Kim Greist (as Graham's wife), Stephen Lang (as sleazy tabloid reporter Freddie Lounds), and Joan Allen (alluring and sensual as Reba, a blind associate of Dollarhyde's and the object of his desire).

I recommend the 1-disc edition of the dvd, which has great quality considering the difficulty in obtaining a good one of this film for years. Probably the best you can do for now until some major re-mastering is done. This film deserves it!",1257897600,3,1835,4.951298701298701
747842,5,6303954103,"The version with Will Graham and flashlight, identified as ""Manhunter (1986)"" is the preferred version of this film for picture quality, and the edit, and is the one to buy if you want this movie on DVD.  It has some nice bonus features, especially interviews with the cast.

The ""Director's Restored Edition"" or ""Divimax Restored Edition"" I only recommend to fans already quite familiar with the standard edition described above.  It is very interesting to see the director's cut, but bear in mind that the elements that are newly inserted are not from the same film stock and are significantly degraded in picture and sound.  The overall sound mix of the director's cut is also not nearly as good as the standard version.  The Divimax version is great, however, for Michael Mann's commentary track, which is NOT on the standard Manhunter (1986) DVD.  The Divimax version does not contain the cast interviews.

As to the film itself, look, here's the bottom line for those who dismiss Manhunter in their reviews as boring or lame or whatever, in comparison to the Anthony Hopkins films:  This is a MUCH more cerebral, slow paced, deliberate, and far less sensational film than Silence of the Lambs.  Silence of the Lambs is a great movie.  Manhunter is a completely different type of great movie.  Manhunter is a colder, more reserved film.  Where Silence is dread-inducing and terrifying, Manhunter is meditatively creepy.

The character of Will Graham in Manhunter, just doesn't have the appeal and sympathetic qualities that Clarice Starling has, and therefore, the viewer will just not get as emotionally involved with the character in Manhunter.  Brian Cox's portrayal of Lecter is utterly understated and sardonic, compared to Hopkin's gothic, slithering performance, and may strike some viewers as lacking the impact of the Hopkins version.  But both Cox's and Petersen's performances are subtle and effective, to those viewers who can appreciate such understated interpretations.

Finally, the Michael Mann version is noted for, as per the norm for Mr. Mann, the exceptional technical precision, craftsmanship, and artistry of the photography, camera compositions, and editing.  In other words, Manhunter is highly regarded by, and recommended for, ""film buffs""--those who pay close attention to the technical and artistic aspects of the medium.

747894,4,6303954103,"The first episode of Doctor Lecter, before ""The Silence of the Lamb"" and ""Hannibal"". The Doctor is already in prison and he is already playing from there with some serial killers and the FBI. But the book is slightly still in construction, and the film is too. We do have the serial killer, and the new technique of profiling. But it is still not entirely squared out. The FBI man is still relying on his instinct, his sixth sense, his intuition, his inner eye to understand the feelings and the thoughts of the killer and capture him by being able to foresee what he is going to do. But that paranormal element is not convincing, though it is commonly used in some detective TV series. Thomas Harris is going to get to real profiling only in the next volume. Even the great visionary power of Doctor Lecter will become the unavoidable logic of the mind, of the psyche, of the deranged mental power of the insane doctor only then. He is a genius in his psychiatric field and his derangement gives him the capability to know no limits. But that is still to come. Here though Thomas Harris settles some accounts with journalists and has one burnt alive. He also settles some revenge with story telling and twists the story line in some unforeseen ways now and then. These moments are magic in a way since they are unexplained and they restart the dynamic of the tale that could have become humdrum. The story seems to settle some accounts with a couple of commonplace if not trite ideas. The whole logic of the killer is to think that his being seen over and over again by a women during the last five minutes of their lives as if their eyes were silver mirrors would lead him to be loved and to come to terms with his desire to kill. His last victim actually loves him in a way and/but she is blind. She loves him because she is blind and he kills her out of no reason and she will not be able to ""see"" him when she dies. Of course that victim will survive because our FBI man-hunter will come into the picture unannounced. Thomas Harris also deals with the idea that all serial killers were boys who were mistreated when children, probably by their parents, even more probably somewhere by their mothers. That kind of a clich is so simple that it does not sound true nor serious, some kind of a joke, maybe a big wink with a grin at the nasty and dirty mind of the reader. But this clich will be present in absolutely all the Doctor Lecter books, in a way or another. In this case it is really superficial. It is interesting to see, after reading it, this first episode in the story of Doctor Lecter, first episode as it came out of the mind of its author because we can see and feel the genetic dimension of the saga, because it was to become a saga and today it even has become a cultish trip into criminal insanity.

Mann, early in his career here, still had his trademark&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Miami-Vice-Season-One-Two/dp/B000FS9MZ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Miami Vice: Season One & Two</a>&nbsp;touches, stark colors, unique MTV-styled camera angles and the insertion of pop music at unexpected moments.

I have grown to like Petersen as he's aged as an actor, but in ""Manhunter,"" he was a bit too young and bland for my taste. I would have liked to seen a more established, brooding actor in the role. But the supporting cast, including Dennis Farina, Stephen Lang and Joan Allen, never disappoint. Tom Noonan gives a haunting performance as the hunted serial killer, but his work is so good it threatens to capsize the film. He does not enter the proceedings until midway in, and the film changes course en route to the shocking climax. His struggles are heartbreaking, and it puts an uncomfortably human face on a terrifying monster. But once the film changes focus, and a face is put to the killer, much of the suspense and fear of the investigation is lost.

I have never liked how the police arrive at the exact moment Noonan's character is about to commit a murder, and his house, an isolated structure that looks as if it were designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, does not fit such a lonely and disturbed man. But this was 1986, and back then we were dancing to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rio/dp/B00005BJ9W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rio</a>&nbsp;by Duran Duran with Patrick Nagel prints hanging on the wall.

""Manhunter"" is perhaps best known for having the first film version of the Hannibal Lecter character, played with extraordinary coolness by Brian Cox. It results in pretty much just an extended cameo, but the scene plays with uncommon menace. Cox's Lecter is not be fooled with and, unlike Anthony Hopkins' portrayal, he is unremittingly evil.

However, the film was made, released, and seen on its own terms (and flopped on its own terms if it comes to that) in 1986, so I will try not to compare it to ""Silence"" or the other adaptation of the same source material, 2002's ""Red Dragon.""  Taken independently, however, Manhunter still is largely a failed movie, never managing to lift itself from the morass of mediocre thrillers that one can often find in shopping mall bargain bins.

The plot of the film is not the problem.  Successfully adapted from Thomas Harris's critically-acclaimed thriller (entitled Red Dragon), Manhunter follows the efforts of mentally-scarred FBI consultant Will Graham as he attempts to capture a new serial killer dubbed ""The Tooth Fairy.""  While the overall outline of the plot is reasonably formulaic (it's fairly clear the movie will climax with a confrontation between Graham and the killer) the film takes several interesting and unexpected turns.

The real problem is that the actors fail to generate any tension with their performances.  Brian Cox's Hannibal Lecter may be slightly chilling in his banality, but his frostiness lacks menace.  William Peterson's Will Graham is a complete dissapointment.  Very little about mid-80's William Peterson screams ""emotionally-scarred.""  He seems every bit an everyman--the standard movie flatfoot.  While that might be useful or beneficial in some roles, Manhunter requires that Graham be weak--tortured by the demons of his past--and Peterson seems more like a boxer than a basket-case.  As the killer, Francis Dollarhyde, Tom Noonan certainly looks imposing.  However, one senses he was chosen precisely because of those intimidating looks, not because of his thespian skills.  It might help if the screenplay gave him a bit more to work with, but nonetheless he is not always convincing.  Dennis Farina and Kim Greist are adequate in their roles as FBI man Crawford and Graham's wife, respectively.

Still, despite the principal actors' sleepwalking, the movie is not without its moments.  Stephen Lang is suitably greasy as a tabloid reporter, and Joan Allen is very delicate as Dollarhyde's blind love interest.  The climactic shootout set to Iron Butterfly's In A Gadda-da-vida is very well-directed, even if its impact is blunted by a sappy happy ending to outdo all sappy happy endings (The turtles are going to be okay).  It's worth a look, especially if you like ""Silence"" or thillers, but it's just not terribly good.  And I didn't even get into how dated it is.",1215475200,,2681,5.159722222222222

They have good writing, directing, editing and acting.  Sir Anthony did his best, but one or two strong actors can do so much.  SoTL and Hannibal became horror movies instead of thrillers.  Of the players in these horror movies, I can only remember Sir Anthony and Jodie Foster.
  With several relatively unknown actors and a TV director: Michael Mann, Manhunter was presented balanced and thrilling.  I consider this film to be part of the ""film"" catagory.
  William Petersen plays William Graham, a solitary man with left-over mental problems from capturing the serial killer Hannibal Lecter(Brian Cox).  Graham has retired and he lives in a beach house with his wife;Molly(Kim Greist) and son; Kevin(David Seaman).  Grahams peaceful existance is interrupted by his former partner Jack Crawford(Dennis Farina).  Crawford manipulates Graham back into FBI service in the search for another serial killer(Tom Noonan).  He shows Graham 2 photos of the two families who have been slaughtered already by the new killer who is governed by a lunar cycle.
  There is a stark contrast between the characters of the killer and Graham.  The rest of the world passes by without knowing the visousness of the killer.  The killer goes to work, though shy, he enjoys friendships and at least one romantic relationship.  Graham, on the other hand, is brooding as he returns to the dark mindset of the serial killer.  As he goes deeper into this darkness even his partner Crawford becomes afraid.  In his mutterings trying to understand the killer, we discover that Graham feels sorry for the child who became the serial killer, but feels the killer should be blown out of his *** socks.  Then Graham asks Crawford is that feeling is a contradiction in terms, Crawford doesn't know what to say.  Crawford stands with his back against the wall as Graham continues to mutter then shortly provides the reason for the killings and how the killer picked his victims.
  As Graham, William Petersen is in his own little world.  He is constantly talking to himself, asking questions and answering them.  This brings a deep tenseness to the character.  Very well done.  All of the other actors except for Brian Cox take a back seat to the consumate performances of these two men.  The chemistry between these two men is fantastic.  One of the most terrifying moments of the film happens after Graham sees Leckter for the first time in 3 years.  As Graham bangs on the cell door desperately to get out, Lecter tells him that the only reason he caught Leckter was because Graham was just like him.  Petersen runs down the stairs as though the devil were chasing him and at the bottom must control what must have been the biggest anxiety attack of all time.
  Cox provides a wonderful performance as Leckter.  He comes across as a calm psychologist anyone would want to see.  But through his clouded eyes the viewer can see the madness.
  Dennis Farina has usually played the police officer in films that he does.  He was a cop, so I guess it might be natural to cast him that way.  I wish casting directors would try other roles, I think he could handle them.  Kim Greist, David Seaman and Tom Noonan all are equally supportive.
  This is not a block buster, but it is one of the best films I've seen.  It was made in 1986 so you might have a problem finding it.  I own it and have viewed it several times since I got it and I think a viewer who want strong performances instead of blockbusters would enjoy this film.",1211241600,2,3776,4.7265745007680495
747992,4,6303954103,"This is a highly entertaining, suspenseful, intelligent serial-killer movie. As you know, it's based on the Thomas Harris novel ""Red Dragon"", which was the ""prequel"" to ""Silence of the Lambs"".

The plot involves FBI agent Will Graham, excellently portrayed by Will Petersen, who attempts to catch a warped (aren't they all?) serial killer nicknamed ""The Tooth Fairy"". For help, he consults Hannibal Lecter, portrayed by Englishman Brian Cox, who is institutionalized. Eventually, of course, he figures out the clues left by the killer and meets up with him in a dramatic, thrilling end scene.

The cinematography and the images are beautiful. The music, while disturbing, is perfect for the film. Tom Noonan plays the ""Tooth Fairy"", and does a great job of portraying a psychotic killer. He even injects some humanity/sympathy into the role, making it all the more fascinating to watch. I did not find Hannibal Lecter ""scary"" or even creepy, for some reason. Interesting, of course, and a great foil for our hero.

Better than ""Silence of the Lambs""? Not sure. But it is undoubtedly a great movie, with top-notch acting, a creepy psycho, a likeable hero, and a thrilling ending. My only complaint is that the ""red dragon"" symbol and its meaning to the killer was never fully explained (maybe it is in the book).",1203897600,,1311,5.004587155963303
747993,5,6303954103,"Now we finally have the DVD release of the proper version of this film.  In recent years we've seen two DVD releases containing a total of 3 different cuts of this film.  But none of them contained the original theatrical version (the one released on VHS and laserdisc oh so many years ago).

This one, the MGM release, is the ""definitive version"" that most of the fans have been screaming for for a long time.  I can't believe it took this long.

I was delighted when the other versions were released on DVD because they had some bonus goodies included with them, but my delight faded as soon as I discovered the film was cut differently from the version I had seen so many times on VHS and Laserdisc and had grown to love.  The other DVD versions are missing parts of scenes, have alternate versions of some scenes, are missing dialogue, and have added scenes that interrupt the flow of the movie.  At least one of the other versions includes a coda at the end where William Peterson's character pays a visit to the family that would have been the Tooth Fairy's next victims.  Being so familiar with the original theatrical cut, I found that coda to be unnecessary and and even a bit clunky.

This new MGM release has no bonus features at all.  And you know what?  I don't care.  I didn't buy it for the bonus goodies, I bought it for the FILM!

And with all due respect to Sir Anthony Hopkins and his take on the Hannibal Lector character (which grew more over-the-top with each sequel/rehash), Brian Cox's portrayal of Lector is shrewder and more believable.  His Hannibal is far more understated than Hopkins', and it works better for the character and the film.  Hopkins' portrayal seems ""too Hollywood"" by comparison.  But as another reviewer so rightly pointed out, ""Manhunter"" is a crime drama and ""Silence of the Lambs"" is closer to being a horror film.  Brian Cox's Hannibal wouldn't be as effective in ""Lambs"" and Hopkins' Hannibal would be FAR too much in ""Manhunter"".  So I guess it really is like comparing apples and oranges.

But you don't have to choose one over the other.  You really should like them both.  ""Manhunter"" is gritty, ""Lambs"" is eerie.

But you need to have one definitive version of ""Manhunter"" to hold up high and cherish, and this version is it.",1202083200,5,2281,4.594059405940594
747994,5,6303954103,"I did not think this was ever going to come out after three itterations that were chop shopped up by Anchor Bay.

I am a huge fan of this movie and was still holding on to my VHS copies as the DVD releases that previously came out were......not good.  Why they cut certain scenes and poorly edited dialogue, while adding previously unseen ""cut"" scenes that added nothing to the orginal threatical release is beyond me.

THIS is the movie that I have long since beleived to be one of THE finest made crime drama movies ever made.

The ORIGINAL Hannibal ""Lecktor"".  The orginal Will Graham.  The Original Tooth Fairy and Dennis Farina and Joan Allen and Micheal Mann Directing, too boot.

If you own the DVD already, BUY this anyways.  There will be NO dissappointment.

I guarantee it.

Addendum:  Here is my orginal review of the movie when it was first released on DVD.  The difference between THAT and THIS is amazing:

""How difficult is this? You'd like to rate this movie five plus stars, because it is indeed a masterpiece (Don't listen to those whiney saps who want to compare it to Silence of the Lambs. Manhunter was a crime drama. SOTL was a horror movie. While I don't favor Hopkins cartoonish portrayal of Lechter, I'll admit it was entertaining. I prefer Cox's cerebral portrayal which resembled the book. But let's stop this bashing back and forth, it's tiresome.), on the other hand, Anchor Bay butchered it so much, it doesn't deserve the high ranking. What do you do? I'd almost like to opt for a seperate rating system here at Amazon. One for if you like the movie, and a seperate one for what fans of the movie thought of Anchor Bay's ""remastering"".
For those of you who'd be interested, here is Anchor Bay's ""canned"" response to a recent critique:

""Dear Customer:

It has come to our attention that our THX version of Manhunter is missing several seconds of footage which can be found by viewing other sources.

Please be aware that the interpositive of the film was used to make our disc, not a print, of which there are many with varying differences. This was and is the best source in the world for the film. We were aware of several minutes of differences between this version and the director's cut, so we went to Michael Mann for the master containing the only existing and exact version of his preferred cut.

Michael Mann's cut is the version he wanted on home video, and he, as well as Anchor Bay understood the trade-off of content at the expense of state-of-the-art quality. It was with that in mind that ABE followed the quality path to create the THX disc version.

We have heard positive feedback from most in regard to both of our releases and are sorry if you, our customer, prefer one of the several other versions that are in distribution in other media or territories.

We were (and are) opposed to cannibalizing Manhunter to create a hybrid version of the two, and apologize to anyone who feels we didn't put our best efforts into each version. I think you know we always appreciate your feedback (good or bad) and strive to do our best for each film. In this case, the versions released are the best we could do, and for the record, we're hoping you, our customer, enjoy our efforts.""

Yes it is a very lame response and I took my shot back at anchor Bay telling them that in fact what they did do was indeed ""Cannabilize"" this film (interesting choice of words.). they never responded back.

What did I really expect though. Again in summation: Five stars for the movie. 0 stars for Anchor Bay's effort/laziness.""",1193702400,5,3561,4.592417061611374
747995,3,6303954103,"This is the first of the Hannibal Lector series.  The second which is a more known film, Silence of the Lambs, came out 5 years later.  Manhunter introduces us to Dr. Lector through the FBI agent Will Graham.  All we know is that Graham captured Dr. Lector and he is now in jail, but Graham still respects Dr. Lector's knowledge on forensic psychology and helps him to find another serial killer, ""The Tooth Fairy"".  This serial killer prays on ""happy families"" and remains illusive.  Will Graham is determined to capture him at any cost.  Lector is played by Brian Cox.  I have to admit that I like Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of the diabolical Lector better.  ""The Tooth Fairy"" is played by Tom Noonan and is by far his best acting role and he should have received some award for it.  He made the movie.  This film is produced by Dino De Laurentiis, the same producer as all of the Lector series except, Silence of the Lambs.  The story line was good, but the screen play adaptation could have been better, alot was lost.  I still believe this first in the series is an excellent choice and explains Hannibal's character.  This should be viewed before seeing Silence of the Lambs.",1192492800,,1181,4.5933014354066986
747996,5,6303954103,"This is the first film to feature Hannibal Lecter. It predates Silence of the Lambs by five years and is frequently forgotten because of the later film. However be assured this is a marvellous film in its own right and superior to Red Dragon (which is the same story) in every way.

The reason for its excellence is mainly due to Michael Mann, the director who was meticulous in the design and look of the film. His use of colour and the way the film was lit are crucial and as he said ""all are there to create dread"".

The casting is very good; Brian Cox plays Lecter completely differently from the way Hopkins plays him. In Manhunter it is a smaller role, but Cox's performance is crucial to the films success. Cox spent time researching criminal psychology and preparing for the role and he is the most important actor in the film. Having said that Tom Noonan is truly terrifying as Francis Dollarhyde, and if the film does have a weakness it just might be William Peterson...",1191369600,,980,4.5

an agent who uses psychology and empathy with his target to pursue him.
This film, based on the equally original novel RED DRAGON by Thomas
Harris, is stylish and effective.  Its luster may have been diminished
by the many subsequent efforts in the same area (I won't say imitators),
but it is still worthwhile for its ""Miami Vice"" style direction and
music(Michael Mann directs), its taut police procedural scenes, a chilling
""key revelation"" scene, and star-making performances by Tom Noonan, Joan
Allen, William Petersen, and especially Brian Cox as the original
Hannibal Lector.

Note: There are two earlier widescreen DVD releases of this film, each
with extra features.  One is a ""director's cut"" special edition, which
has received mixed reviews.  I didn't think it was an improvement over
the original.  Both editions appear to be out of print, but there are
many ""New & Used"" sellers on Amazon.  I would recommend the ""flashlight

747998,5,6303954103,"I bought this DVD a few years ago and I haven't had any of the problems that some of the new editions have.  That said, This is a great movie in every respect.  The acting is top-notch all through.  I don't think that Red Dragon can stand up to this movie at all, despite its star-power.  I am a huge fan of Edward Norton but William Peterson is much better.  You can really feel him getting deeper and deeper into the case.  The scene where he realizes that Dollarhyde has seen the videos is one of the best ever.  And although Anthony Hopkins is THE Hannibal Lector, Brian Cox is actually better.  He doesn't play it for laughs at all.  I read the book Red Dragon quite a few years ago so I knew that the ending in Manhunter was not true to the book, but it was still terrific, especially with the use of ""In-a-gadda-da vida"" in the scene.

One isuue I would like to talk about is the last scene in some of the versions.  Graham (Peterson) goes to the house of the would-be victims and tells them that they would have been next.  Many people thought this scene was unnecesssary (why tell them anything at all?)  I think the reason it was put in was to make the audience think for a split second that Graham went there to kill them.  Remember that the reason they brought him in was because he could get into the mind of a serial killer.",1176768000,6,1338,4.216535433070866

This film's Hannibal was so subtle that the actor probably gave ppl the creeps on the subway for years.  He is also under-rated...Brian Cox.

Just see it, and see how much BETTER (not ""nearly as good,"" as the descr states) it is than ""Silence.""  And DO NOT EVER spend any money supporting the remake, which is such a joke that I am still laughing...

That's my short version.",1174953600,4,522,4.56989247311828
748050,5,6303954103,"I am one of those people who typically leans towards the original version of a movie.  To put it nicely, I hate remakes.  Well, the same applies to this great movie.  ""Red Dragon"" isn't even close to being as good as ""Manhunter"".  To me, ""Manhunter"" is a contemporary classic in the truest sense.  Michael Mann can do no wrong, and certainly hits the nail on the head with this flick.

Now, this movie is 20+ years old, but ages perfectly.  I will even go as far as to say I like this movie more than SOTL.  That doesn't mean it's a better movie, just more favorable to me.  ""Manhunter"" really is creepy, more than SOTL.

The music is perfectly scary, the way Mann directed the cameras to cue when ""Graham"" flicks on the light of the bedroom of the first murder scene we see is so shocking.  And really, this movie is probably the first of it's kind in regards to showing forensics, criminal profiling, and in-depth FBI usage.

Another cool thing Mann does is when he uses the quick camera movements.  I can't describe it really, but for example when ""Graham"" is slaying the dragon so to speak at the end, you see several of these quick camera movements.  It's really interesting style and works great.

This movie also gives us the introduction to one of the most diabolical villians in the history of cinema, Dr. Hannibal Lector.  Not played this time by Anthony Hopkins, but brilliantly by Brian Cox.  Cox does a wonderful job.  Maybe not as good as Hopkins in SOTL, but better than Hopkins in ""Hannibal"" or ""Red Dragon"".

Most people are disappointed to know that Lector is already in jail in this one, but that makes his character even more mysterious.  All you know is that Special Agent Will Graham caught him and sort of how he caught him.  That formula worked well with ""Manhunter"" and SOTL.  But when he escaped and was on the lose, the movies sunk tremendously (""Hannibal"" and ""Red Dragon"").

I highly recommend this movie.  If you liked the SOTL series or ""Miami Vice"" or ""Thief"" or any other Michael Mann stuff, you will absolutely love ""Manhunter"".  It will not disappoint.  It really is a brilliant movie.",1174953600,5,2120,4.571808510638298
748051,5,6303954103,"Francis Dollarhyde has to be one of the more disturbing and chilling villains in modern day literature and cinema.  Abused and damaged as a child to a point where only a series of rudimentary, barely functioning social masks takes the place of a whole man, Dollarhyde hides the savage pathology of a serial killer who annihilates entire families to fuel his twisted desire and impossible longing.

Although ""Manhunter"" is less true to Thomas Harris' book ""Red Dragon,"" and the 2002 film version with the same name, I found it to be a vastly superior film.  Despite its retro `80's fashion and the distinctive pastels and sun-drenched look of Michael Mann's work during his Miami Vice television series days, you will find a film that cuts through the meat, slicing through the bone and exposing the marrow.  Tom Noonan's performance is one of the most haunting and pitiable on celluloid.  Noonan delivers the tortured, damaged and ultimately unsalvageable soul of Francis Dollarhyde in a way that even Harris' book didn't convey.  He is a howling soul in Hell--a grotesque who is driven by his delusions.

William Peterson is Will Graham, a  former FBI profiler, who retired after a near death encounter in apprehending the notorious and now incarcerated Hannibal Lector (played by a wonderfully sinister and reptilian Brian Cox).  When Graham's former handler, Jack Crawford (Dennis Farina), asks him to help him profile the murderer, Graham visits Lector in his jail cell, to recover the mind-set necessary to track the killer.  In doing so, Graham incurs Lector's wrath and his collusion with the very killer Graham is pursuing, bringing him far closer to the case than he anticipated.

Joan Allen absolutely shines as Reba McClane, the blind girl who has the misfortune to be attracted to Francis Dollarhyde and who unwittingly serves as Dollarhyde's last connection to his vanishing humanity.  Early on in their relationship, Dollarhyde takes Reba to a veterinarian who is set to cap a sedated tiger's tooth.  Watching Reba's facial expressions as she ran her hands along the tiger's fur and listened to the beating of its heart, with tears streaming down her face, was almost painful.  Dollarhyde watches her from a corner in the room and seems to experience something akin to an emotional release from her experience.  It is one of the strangest and most erotically charged scenes I've ever seen in a film.

When I first saw this film in its theatrical release, I remember thinking, ""Thanks a lot, Michael Mann, you've totally ruined Iron Butterfly's Inna Gadda De Vida for me.  Now I'm never going to be able to hear this great song from my youth without feeling vaguely frightened.""  Even so, the sound track for the film contains some of the most eerily beautiful music from `80's groups like Red 7, Prime Movers and Shriekback, which Mann has integrated flawlessly into the film.

""Manhunter"" might annoy some viewers who remember only too well the big hair and bad fashion of the 1980's.  However, if you can manage to put these aside, I think you will find an often overlooked and intense gem of a thriller.",1173052800,14,3120,4.940613026819923
748052,5,6303954103,"I have seen the ""director's cut"" and the theatrical release. I strongly recommend this DVD (I own it). It is the theatrical release and, quite frankly, Michael Mann's original editing instincts were on target. The ""director's cut"" really doesn't add significant impact to the film. The only detrimental thing I have to say about this DVD is that it is not widescreen. But, it's really not worth spending between $25 and $300 dollars for out-of-print director's cuts. Or, get the new 3-disc Lector set that includes this film, Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal. Unfortunately, as with many of Mann's films - the director's cut releases reflect poor judgment by the director [Last of the Mohicans is a prime example -- ruined by Mann in re-editing. And, the theatrical release was withheld from DVD.] Invest in the theatrical cut of Manhunter while it's available.",1171843200,4,862,4.993055555555555

""Manhunter"" (1986) directed by Michael Mann - is a masterpiece, pure and simple. It took me five times but I finally realized it. I see it as the best adaptation of the favorite book written on the subject of serial killers and investigation of their crimes. I also discovered William Blake and his fascinating art, including the painting which gave the book its title, ""Red Dragon"", thanks to Mr. Harris. Michael Mann certainly read the book ""Red Dragon"" before he started to work on the movie and he was able to get inside of it as well as the book's main character, Will Graham was able to get inside a murderer's mind. The scene where Will Graham (William Peterson) finds out who the killer is makes me shiver every time I watch the movie. I can not recall another ""moment of truth"" as powerful and convincing as this one. It is more powerful that the similar scene in ""The Sound Of The Lambs"" where Clarise Starling figures out who and where the ""Buffalo Bill"" can be. Michael Mann took his time understanding how important the scene was and it received a royal treatment in the movie. I used to be disappointed that Mann cut the book's very impressive ending but after many viewings I think I understand why he did it. For me, the whole movie was a build up for the ""moment of truth"" scene and after Graham figured who the murderer was making us the participants of the process, it did not really matter (at least for me) how they were going to catch Francis ""Red Dragon"" Dolarhyde.",1170892800,5,1531,4.527075812274369

There will be only one Hannibal Lecter, imho, and it is the exquisitely bland Brian Cox, not Anthony Hopkins (not a dis, Sir Tony, you're great and all, but hoooo wheeeee, Brian!).  I dare you to hear Iron Butterfly's ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"" without shuddering.  A classic horror film with subtle nuances that will flash in your subliminal mind at the most inconvenient times.

748055,5,6303954103,"I agree with JJ Justice's review, ""Manhunter"" is great and the ""Red Dragon"" remake was a travesty. It truly was a slap in the face to the great early work of William Petersen and director Michael Mann.

I still ask, why oh why did William Petersen not become a humongous star in Hollywood? He had the movie star looks, the charisma, and he's a darn fine actor on top of it all. He's BELIEVEABLE. He put his heart and soul so much into the role in ""Manhunter"" that it literally drained him physically and emotionally. Brian Cox was also superb, and in my opinion he was better in many aspects than Anthony Hopkins ever was.

If you want to look more into the work of William Petersen, I highly encourage you to check out ""To Live and Die in L.A."" If you don't believe in his star quality, you will after you see that movie. What a shame he never truly rose to the top.",1157760000,7,867,4.248484848484848

Manhunter should have been re-released in theatres and i don't care if it made less money than ""Red Dragon"". Check out ""To live and die in L.A.""

748057,4,6303954103,"Based upon the wonderful, well written novel ""Red Dragon"" by Thomas Harris, this is a superior and chilling thriller. Grim and gripping, it features William Peterson in the role of taciturn, retired FBI agent, Will Graham, who is called back to service in order to track down a bizarre serial killer. It appears that Graham has the uncanny ability to get into a killer's mind set and figure out what his next move might be. It is as if he and the killer become one. In his preparation for this, Graham even consults the imprisoned Hannibal Lecter (yes, THE Hannibal Lecter), deliciously played by Brian Cox.

The movie is compelling and, at all times, gripping. Joan Allen affectingly plays a blind woman who unknowingly involves herself with the creepy serial killer who is chillingly played by Tom Noonan. It is her involvement with him that helps bring the film to its stunning conclusion. Good performances by Dennis Farina, Stephen Lang, and Kim Greist round out this fine, ensemble cast.

This film is a taut, unnerving psychological thriller that is deftly directed by Michael Mann and accompanied by a terrific, musical score used to great effect. Who ever would have thought that Iron Butterfly's heavy metal ""In A Gadda Da Vita"" could be used to such chilling effect in the final, climactic scene? This is a film well worth watching.",1146009600,,1343,4.860262008733624
748058,2,6303954103,"This is Michael (LAST OF THE MOHICANS, HEAT, THE INSIDER) Mann's far superior, first film adaptation of Thomas Harris' RED DRAGON. It's superb. Creepy, tense, edgy, slick when you don't expect to be, and genuinely even-handed about the story's anti-hero Will Graham and the supposed monster Francis Dolarhyde (portrayed as just as twisted a human as the detectives who pursue him), MANHUNTER is a artfully crafted thriller that stands apart from the other ""Hannibal the Cannibal"" films. I also far prefer Brian Cox as Lektor, he gets under your skin without making an incision, while Anthony Hopkins splattered the screen with patent medicine ookiness.

That said.... I was very disappointed when I rented this particular set. The second, ""director's cut"" version is clearly a pre-release work print, with lower grade titles and dubbing, and a final scene of Graham visiting near-victim family #3 that is just terrible.

The first disc is the release version, and though it restores a few scenes which were snipped from the VHS cut, a quick line from the scene in which Graham figures out how Dolarhyde is picking his victims is ""missing."" (""As a child my heart bleeds for him ... as an adult ... slaughters whole families for selfish, trivial ends. ... Are you uncomfortable with this kind of understanding?"") Whether it really needs to be in the scene is arguable. Mann may've removed it from the final version for good reasons. He sneers at his friend and former colleague, Crawford. Alienates him. It's a false climax in a scene when the REAL climax is the storeroom guard (on the phone) confirming Graham's breakthrough discovery about the mountain of forensic evidence.

Other than that, the first disc is superbly transferred. If you've only seen this on tape, the clarity and color saturation of the original film will amaze you. Save your pennies, buy the ""release version"" single disc release, and let Canal/Anchor Bay learn that mis-labled ""director's cuts"" just won't sell.",1139270400,11,1985,5.064220183486238
748138,4,6303954103,"Over the years, critics have lauded this as the best of the movies featuring Hannibal Lechter.  I found it a little more ""flashy"" and ""artsy"" rather than truly compelling, but one must credit Michael Mann for his mastery of the ""music video goes cinema"" look he does so well.  Based on Thomas Harris' RED DRAGON novel, the movie follows William Petersen as the agent who captured Hannibal Lechter, only to find himself back on the scene again once the Tooth Fairy emerges.  Petersen's performance is edgy, tight and believable; Tom Noonan is mesmerizingly evil as the fairy; Joan Allen has a supporting role as a blind girl who Noonan fancies; and Dennis Farina is competent as Petersen's boss.  Brian Cox does well as Lechter, but he doesn't control the character as well as Anthony Hopkins does later.  MANHUNTER has a very effective climax with a disturbingly good use of IN A GADDA DI VIDA during the pursuit and capture.  While definitely a well done film, I don't think it's overall as effective as SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, but it's as good as RED DRAGON and better than HANNIBAL.",1130112000,3,1083,4.73404255319149
748139,5,6303954103,"Plot: Will Graham (William Petersen) is pretty much set in his retirement from the FBI. But when approached with a new case -- that of a twisted and incredibly elusive serial killer nicknamed ""The Tooth Fairy"" (Tom Noonan) -- he decides to take up the assignment. He seeks help from the imprisoned Dr. Hannibal Lecktor (Brian Cox) in an attempt to get into the mindset of a serial killer -- a dangerous mental experiementation that nearly broke his mind in two in the past. Indeed, the case swells up over him. Soon, his job becomes his own personal burden. There is a race against time to make sense of this massive puzzle and save another victim, and through the mind games of Lecktor as well as the mysterious Tooth Fairy, it's going to be a no-holds-barred showdown for ultimate justice. It seems this extraordinary murderer may finally meet his match.

Manhunter (based on the Thomas Harris book ""Red Dragon"") is in every way a classic. Many have been known to say it is superior to Silence Of The Lambs, and I completely agree (not to say SOTL was any less of a classic, but you get the idea). Obviously there are many great aspects to the film, including an amazing score, a tense and nighmarishly realistic atmosphere, and superb directing by Michael Mann. But the thing that really hits me when watching this is the characters, as well as the actors playing them. William Petersen is incredible as the under-pressure Will Graham. There is an obvious sense of inner struggle and you get the idea there is much more going on than that which meets the eye. Definitely alot of psychological effect filling in the already mind-boggling atmosphere. And much of that psychological effect is driven to the edge by Brian Cox and Tom Noonan. Although the character of Hannibal ""the cannibal"" Lecktor will always strike the image of a creepy Anthony Hopkins in our minds, I believe Brian Cox was just as good. He seemed so well in-tune to the storyline and to the character that I for sure felt the sense that he deserved this role. For the movie's sake, he hit the nail on the head. The mind games between Graham and Lecktor are undeniably unnerving, and really jerk the viewer into their world -- easily, a world of pure madness. But for full psychological terror, we must turn our attention to Tom Noonan's legendary performance as The Tooth Fairy. Every bit freaky and creepy, Noonan's quiet, calm, and collective take on this mesmerizing character was a spooky touch of perfection. A man of profound theatrical talent, he truly brings the killer to life and could fool anyone into believing this was real. With the combination of Graham's near-breaking psyche, Lecktor's dark cleverness, and the shattered mind of The Tooth Fairy tearing across the script like broken glass, Manhunter becomes one of the greatest thrillers you could ever see.

In conclusion, Manhunter is a true masterpiece that deserves a spot in every DVD collection. And with excellent special features including an 18 minute featurette with Petersen, Cox, and Noonan (among others) as well as quite extensive bios for all of the big stars of the movie, you've got every reason to pick this DVD up.",1129766400,4,3171,4.7846715328467155
748140,4,6303954103,"Back in 1986, when this film was released and before any of the movie-going audience had a real grip on who Hannibal Lecter was, I thought this was one of the most intense police thrillers I'd ever seen.

I was not a watcher of MIAMI VICE, so I didn't even try to use Michael Mann's original police creation as a method of comparison.  It was fresh journey into the mind of a serial killer, with actor William Peterson (who had scored in TO LIVE AND DIE IN L.A. just one year before) taking us inside.

While Anthony Hopkins may have won his Oscar for his portrayal as Lecter in THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, I always felt the ""scary-eyed, slithering tongue, over-the-top"" approach to the character was overdone and overbakes.  Brian Cox's simple and subtle approach to the character was equally, if not more frightening.

Dino DeLaurentis produced MANHUNTER, which was not a great box office success.  For this reason, he turned down producing SILENCE.  Bet he's just a little sorry now.

And finally, just a reminder that when we last left HANNIBAL, both movie and book, Hannibal Lecter was still on the loose.  Wonder what authour/creator Thomas Harris has in mind next?",1128038400,4,1169,4.719211822660099
748141,2,6303954103,"UPDATE: 10/26/05

After just finishing the book Red Dragon. I have a few more nuggets to throw in this review.

First, the book blows both cinematic adaptations away. The detail, the story about Dollarhyde, some of the character development. It gives me a much more satisfying experience than the films.

The book accentuates my dislike for Manhunter a bit more. The total cop out at the end of the movie (In-A-GADDA-DA-VIDA.. pffft), the scene with Graham at the hospital outside of Lound's room after he gets toasted by Dollarhyde. Why that hospital scene is left in is beyond me. Lounds telling Graham on his deathbed that he set him up was pivital in that sequence. To kill that scene but show Graham at the hospital talking to Jack made no sense. It missed the whole substance of the setup.

And... Dollarhyde... any backstory on him? Not really. Dollarhyde is just a backstoryless freak who is killing families. Its a disservice to the story to marginalize him that way. Manhunter doesn't even encorporate Dollahyde's Grandmother's house. A Harris' strength in the book was while Dollarhyde distburbed and infuriated you, towards the end you almost felt sorry for him. Do you get that essentual plotline with Manhunter. No.

Last thing, alot of you snobs who bash on Brett Ratner. You're out of line. While Red Dragon (2002) is a bit detached and goes by the numbers. Its refreshing to have that. A director who just gives you the goods rather than trying to be overly flashy. Red Dragon has richer imagery (Lecter's cell vs. Cox's Lecter's cell). It isn't perfect either. It condenses and deletes details from the book too (Dollarhyde's history, Graham and Molly's interaction, Lounds deathbed accusation - wisely Red Dragon kept Graham out of the Hospital if they weren't going to do the Lounds deathbed scene). The difference here is that it makes a superior effort at the story from the book. Manhunter does not. Manhunter has moments that it starts to gather steam only to lose it and finally jump the shark in the end sequence. Tom Noonan dancing around to Iron Butterfly - cheesy. Noonan's Ripper Character in the Last Action Hero was creepier.

If you like fast and loose campy adapations of movies with underwhelming 80's synth - go with Manhunter. If your a fan of the book - Red Dragon is leaps and bounds superior.

Manhunter - **
Red Dragon (2002) *** 1/2

- end update -

This movie will always be compared to Red Dragon (2002). Before I go into that, I'll offer my thoughts on this movie in a non biased way.

First, this movie is very dated by 1980s production. The music is the real link back to that era. Hannibal Lecter is a much reduced role than I expected. He's more of a plot device here. This movie is about Will Grahams struggle with his sanity and to catch the ""tooth fairy.""

I liked the how Graham's struggle is center stage. I think thats the strengh of this film.  His conflicts with Crawford really add to the movie. William Peterson's brooding and frustration were believable.

Negative aspects there are many - There isn't much backstory on Graham's capture of Lecture the few years previous. It would've served the story much better to have it. Tom Noonan's tooth fairy isn't nearly as menacing as I'd have liked. His romance with his coworker feels forced. Which leads me to another critique.

Much of the acting is substandard. Other than Graham's struggle very few actors put in a memorable performance.

Now, to the inevitable comparsions with Red Dragon (2002). The 2002 film is superior in many ways - acting, storyline, backstory and of course Anthony Hopkins. In the wake of Silence of the Lambs its obvious that the role of Lecter was raised due to popularity of the character. Which helps that film. Dollarhyde in the 2002 release is much more menacing than Tom Noonan. The only thing that Red Dragon sacrifices is some of Graham's anxiety.

I think the 2002 release of the film is helped greatly by the opening scenes. Rearranging Red Dragon from the book and adding the Lecter/Graham confrontation off the top where Graham got stabbed was brilliant. It pulled you into the movie immediately. Manhunter never quite pulled me in. Don't get me wrong Manhunter tries to connect - its just not very effective at it.

There is a loud chorus of people who sing the greatness of this movie. These people have a chip on thier shoulder about it, but they are off base. Manhunter does not flow or develop nearly as well as it could have been.

As Brian Cox has said, the title Manhunter is a bit cheesy. It fits the film. Its a B film plain and simple.

Bottom line if you are a fan of these Hannibal Lecter movies. Buy this used as I did or rent.

Up to par with the later movies it is not.",1126569600,3,4732,4.657863145258103
748142,4,6303954103,"Manhunter, What a great movie. Not only for the story and the hallmark acting. But also from a film making perspective as well.

So many innovations. Concepts and styles that due to their genius,stay relevant today.

  Noonan and Cox bring the film to almost a 3 dimensional reality with performances that go far beyond what would be expected from a couple of ( at the time ) unknown actors. In my opinion,these guys really run the show. No disrespect to the outstanding work of William Petersen,who captures the role with a spooky resolve. He plays the role so well,That you realize as an actor, he's really doing what he's performing as an investagator. Getting in the heads of the people he's pursuing/playing.

  The music is almost as much of a cast member as any of the actors. Music that is brilliant in its use and construction.

If ever a soundtrack deserves a CD.Its this one!

  Anyway, I have the basic ""Manhunter"" dvd,and the restored directors cut. I really enjoy the commentary's. The difference between the two, to me, is really a matter of the two different commentary's. The basic unit has the cast,Petersen,Noonan,Cox and

Allen. The restored directors cut is Michael Mann going solo.

  Mann's commentary is a collection of thoughts and techniques. Inspiration of character development and a lot of ""film school"" stuff that is of interest...even to a layman...

  The basic unit with the cast is a lot more interactive. No they

dont exactly hoot it up, but it is slightly more entertaining

as a behind the scenes deal goes.

  Mann's comments are a plus in that he does enjoy the film and

seems at times to be getting caught up in it. As a result,he

has moments where he doesnt speak,but instead watches the movie with the viewer. Kinda cool. You get to see the point hes making rather than having him talk over it as the moment goes by.

  So there ya go. Ya pays your money and ya takes your chances.

The director of red dragon simply has no vision, and none of the performances hold up to those in the earlier film, although emily watson does her best, and can't be blamed for having to suffer the empty mechanics of ralph fiennes, when joan allen had tom noonan's uncomfortably potent performance to play off of.  'empty mechanics' will do for edward norton as well, and i know everyone loves anthony hopkins as lecter--i won't argue with that--brian cox is not as much fun in the role, but he is more frightening because he's more believable; his arrogance for one thing feels like the real arrogance of a very smart, well-educated, thoroughly vicious english man rather than the over-worked screenwriter's device that hopkins already allowed it to seem in the silence of the lambs with his broad accent and theatrics.  but whether you agree with that or not, and whether it's a matter of hopkins vs. cox or of the different filmmakers' conceptions of the character in the two films, by the time of red dragon hopkins was admittedly tired of the role, and the character of lecter is more like your favorite, naughty uncle or a wild animal long since de-fanged and dependent on you and your family as a meal-ticket--in hopkins' case, a very winning, more than $10 million ticket. really the only thing red dragon has over manhunter is that everything about it is circumscribed by audience expectations--so if all you want is to pay to have your expectations put up on a screen for you, then rent red dragon, and don't bother with manhunter.  if you've already seen red dragon, it's okay, rent it again.  you already saw before you saw it anyway...(oh, and that clown from washington bringing soylent green and logan's run into the argument is totally off base.  manhunter has nothing in common with either of those movies.)

748144,2,6303954103,"After reading numerous reviews for ""Red Dragon"" ranting and raving about this film and how great it is, I felt like I really should see what all the fuss is about -- so I rented this film.

""Manhunter"" is very dated, and not in a good way. The score sounds to me like Vangelis having a bad hair day (and I'm a big fan of synthesizers). There is far too much exposition, which is always a sign that the screenwriter failed in properly translating the literary medium to the visual medium of film.

Acting here is rather mediocre... not poor, but nothing remarkable. And perhaps worst of all -- this film lacks Anthony Hopkins. As ridiculous as that may sound, he *is* Hannibal Lecter. Nobody can do Lecter like he can. Any ""Hannibal Lecter"" movie without Hopkins is automatically missing something. This is just my opinion of course, and I recognize that some people may not care too much who plays Lecter.

I found myself getting bored and a bit drowsy while watching this, and the feeling never left. I barely managed to sit through this film. In case you want to peg me as a kid unable to appreciate pre-90's films, I'm 40 years old and some of my all time favorite movies were made in the late 70's through mid 80's. This one just lacks the taut script, production values, acting, cinematography, musical score and visual storytelling ability of ""Red Dragon."" Contrary to what many have said while reviewing the aforementioned movie, this one *was* ripe for a remake. It would have been a shame to leave perhaps the best of Thom Harris's ""Hannibal"" books with this lousy adaptation.

Many fans of this film state various silly reasons why they like it... the presence of the song ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"" (huh?), the ""kitschy"" atmosphere (go watch ""Soylent Green"" or ""Logan's Run"" instead, they're far better kitsch-fests), the more subtle atmosphere (which, incidentally, utterly lacks suspense and differs enormously from Thom Harris's novel), etc.  Not a single explanation yet makes sense to me.  If you like ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"" so much, I'd suggest picking up an Iron Butterfly CD rather than this movie.

Not having read the book, I'm not sure how much ""Red Dragon"" stole from ""Manhunter,"" and how much came from the book. All I can say is that ""Red Dragon"" does it better in every conceivable respect. Skip this turkey, and rent ""Red Dragon"" instead.

Hopkins is brilliant as well, but I always felt that his Lector was like an animal who would strike only of thouroughly provoked. We see Cox and Petersen as equals on different sides of the fence, with little separating them other than Petersen's Graham's knowledge of right and wrong.

748147,5,6303954103,"I first saw ""Manhunter"" back in 1986 as the tail-end of a double-bill with a Rodney Dangerfield vehicle, ""Back to School""(?).  Now I was not favorably inclined to see this film because I was not a big fan of Michael Mann's ""Miami Vice"", which was all the rage on TV at that time.  What I found was an engrossing FBI procedural that entertained me at the time but I backburnered it until ""The Silence of the Lambs"" came out.  I revisited the film on cable and with repeated viewings over the years have grown to appreciate this film more than ""Silence of the Lambs"".  Mann has masterfully directed the complexities of this story of a serial killer case that crosses state borders.  There is terrific ambience, particularly in the scenes shot at night.  The climax of the film where agent Will Graham(William L. Petersen) confronts the serial killer, Francis Dollarhyde(Tom Noonan) while the organ solo from Iron Butterfly's ""In-A-Gada-Da-Vida"" plays in the background is classic.  Enough cannot be said about the cast that Mann has assembled here.  William L.Peterson portrays Graham as a man who is clinging to his sanity while trying to feign cool detachment as he investigates this gruesome case.  Tom Noonan effectively assays the pathos of Dollarhyde but also shows us the monster in the man.  Stephen Lang does a good supporting turn as sleazy reporter Freddy Lounds.  Joan Allen demonstrates the toughness and vulnerability of the blind woman, Reba, whom Dollarhyde falls in love with.  Inevitably we have to compare the performances of Brian Cox and Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter.  All I have to say is these two superb actors deliver different interpretations of the character and both are equally fine.  Cox chose a more detached reading of Lecter and for this film that was the correct call.  Also good are Dennis Farina as Crawford, Graham's FBI superior, and Kim Griest as Molly, Graham's wife.  ""Manhunter"" at the time of release was a box office dud but fortunately for us it has grown in stature with the passage of time.",1104969600,4,2041,4.872463768115942

I still am surprised that William Peterson did not become more of a star after his performance here and in To Live and Die in LA.

You owe it to yourself to witness the amazing performances in this film.

You wouldn't think it from reading the cast list, but the lesser-known stars of Manhunter actually did a much better job than the high-end names in Red Dragon.

Light years better than it's `replacement' ""Red Dragon"", ""Manhunter"" has a remarkable performance by the entire cast involved. Starring the immensely talented and skilled actor William L. Peterson, ""Manhunter"" is a great and outstanding thriller.

 Will Graham (Peterson) is a retired forensic scientist who left his job after a confrontation with notorious mass murderer Hannibal Lector. Graham has had a troubled past but comes out of retirement to track down an unknown serial killer who randomly targets his victims and is known as the ""Tooth Fairy"". Graham may surprisingly find some answers from his arch nemesis Lector who's in prison but may hold some pieces of the puzzle in figuring out where ""The Tooth Fairy"" may strike next. Graham has the ability to be able to study the minds of murders, albeit at a great cost with enormous mental stress at doing so but he's willing to do whatever it takes to hunt and nail ""The Tooth Fairy"" before he strikes again. Meanwhile a blind woman unaware of it, falls in love with a man named Francis Dolarhyde.

 The cast of this movie is great, much better than that of it's 2002 counterpart ""Red Dragon"". While Ralph Fiennes is a wonderful ""villain"" actor, he doesn't hold a candle to the towering Fred Noonan as the psychologically twisted antagonist Francis Dolarhyde. The mood of this movis has a strange greatness to it, something that I feel was missing from ""Red Dragon"". The background music was also great ranging from disturbing ambient background music to heavy metal like the epic Iron Butterfly track ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"". There is an uncertain sense of gloom, foreboding, and doom throughout the movie but in a way that it's not excessively depressing or grim but just right.

 While the popularity of its brilliant sequel ""Silence of The Lambs"" has unfortunately overshadowed this, ""Manhunter"" is a great and awesome movie with a unique style that makes it stand out amongst it's peers. There are disturbingly graphic scenes but for those who love crime thrillers or murder mysterious, this is a movie that should be checked out. While not necessarily viewing it as bad or even mediocre, it actually is good to me anyway, when it comes to this and it's remake ""Red Dragon"", if I had a choice between the two, I'd easily take ""Manhunter"" any day.

748230,4,6303954103,"This first film version of Thomas Harris' novel ""Red Dragon"" is, in a number of ways, the better of the two. Manhunter features somewhat less known, but by no means lesser, actors in the lead roles. A young William Peterson is, in my opinion, rather better than Edward Norton as FBI profiler Will Graham. It's something of a toss up between Manhunter's Dennis Farina and Red Dragon's Harvey Keitel in the Jack Crawford role. (All in all, I really liked Scott Glenn's portrayal best, but that was in a different part of the story.) Tom Noonan takes on the part of insane serial killer Francis Dollarhyde. I find that I prefer him to Ralph Fiennes, who was, among other problems, really too good looking for the part. Noonan has played a number of killers of varying stages of insanity during his career, but Dollarhyde is probably the capper. And, lastly, Brian Cox has the character of Hannibal Lector--the novel's Lector, not the later film version--down perfectly. It's a smaller part than in the more recent film, but Lector's part was smaller in the original novel as well.

Manhunter is, mostly, quite faithful to the novel. Given the limits of the film media, particularly regarding running time, a bit too much background material seems to be missing. I doubt that anyone could film this story exactly right in much under five hours. Noonan's makeup shows the effect of the character's surgically corrected cleft lip and palate, but it isn't really explained (though there are bits of dialogue that suggest it might have been before the film was edited). Some of Cox's lines as Lector are precisely the same as those spoken by Anthony Hopkins, which is to be expected as they are lifted straight from the novel.

The major departure from the novel is the ending. Again, I'd suspect running time may have been the culprit (and I doubt that anyone who hasn't read the novel will even notice, since the film's ending is effective enough). Filming the real ending might have been even more effective, but it would also have added at least another quarter hour to a two hour film.

748234,5,6303954103,"If there were three movies I was asked to bring with me to Heaven before dying, Manhunter would be among them, no doubt. Forget about the 2002, low-level, totally tasteless Red Dragon, which is a mere commercial by-product of Manhunter. Some of the acting lines and dialogs are literally Copy-and-Paste sections of the original movie.

My brother strongly advised me to watch Manhunter one evening, in 1990, merely 4 years after its low-key release. I watched it and damn it! The movie got me hooked, nice and firmly. I started wondering about the reasons why I had been so impressed by Manhunter. I guess there is a mix of things here.

Most definitely, the most fascinating part of it is to follow a high-calibre, irascible cop's journey into the mental and behavioural depths of a high-level, highly intelligent, socially integrated serial killer. The two finally meet, physically and mentally, in a very obscure, twilight zone. The underlying fascination that one might feel while watching this movie certainly comes from the perceived fragility of the line that separates an intelligent monster from his hunter. Call it education, conscience or empathy, internal balance, strength or maturity: there is just something that will draw a dividing line between the two. And it's a fragile line! Intelligence without conscience creates monsters like the serial killer, Dollarhyde. Manhunter is perhaps not the first movie to address the theme of the serial killer's Behind-The-Scene personality, but it's probably the first one that addresses it so clearly, so close to the real world.

Another huge merit of the movie is to stress the fact that people can never be portrayed as simple black-and-white, 2-bit characters. Reality is always much more cumbersome, much more subtle. For all that they are worth, there is always some good in men. Like this: at once, the cop gets into an argument with one of his colleagues who is complaining about the lack of progress in the investigation. The cop turns back to his colleague in anger and shoots back a sentence that can be summarized like this: I feel pity for the little boy that became this killer. He lacked love and attention. But as a grown-up, I agree that he should be destroyed. Is this too subtle for you Jack to understand???. Another pathetic and disturbing scene is the one in which we see the killer laying still in his bed next to -will you believe it- his brand new date. The sensual woman inadvertently drops an arm on his bare chest while sleeping, and the killer, like the little kid he has never completely ceased to be, burst into silent tears. The viewer can only hypothesize about what goes on in the killer's mind and heart at this moment, but the emotion that the killer is still able to display has you wonder: even serial killers can cry.

Third, serial killers could be roaming the area around you without you knowing. After all, Dolarhyde has a managerial position in a media/photography-related company. He works with his colleagues just fine, he is capable of attracting women easily because of his smooth tone of voice, his gentle manners, his apparent quiet caring for others. He is just not one of these brutes that tend to be portrayed in larger audience movies. I guess this realistic paradox contributes to this sense of fulfilment, of accuracy that you?ll feel after watching it.

To conclude, I believe that if, like me, you feel that there is never enough time and material to study mankind, if you are looking for subtle thought material, if you like movies that mix fast-paced actions with intellectual races, then this movie is just right for you.",1090454400,,3637,4.888168557536467

Will Graham, (William Peterson), is the ""Manhunter"" hunting down ""Frances Dolarhyde"", and also the man responsible for imprisoning Dr Lechtor, at great phsycial, and emotional harm to himself.
Don't be fooled by Dino's latest grab at a buck, the rediculous ""Red Dragon"". (Which is odd, since Dino owns ""Manhunter"" as well..)
So, Red Dragon is only a remake of this great film.
It's ultimately embaressing to watch Lechtor and Chilton's charachter's re-acted, only ""made up"" to look 20 some years younger! (Red Dragon).
This is the Real McCoy, and Brian Cox, IMHO, should have stayed Hannibal Lechtor.
If you want another good performance by Anthony Hopkins, see ""Meet Joe Black"".
BTW, as far as I can tell, Barney's character, (Frankie Faison), is the only actor to play in all ""Four movies of the Trilogy""..
If you want the original psychological thriller in this series, you found it..

Let me say this clearly:
There would be no ""Silence"", ""Hannibal"", or, ""Red Dragon"" without Michael Mann's screenplay and movie, ""ManHunter!
How would he know? That this would turn out to be more than a one time thriller?
So, why not change the ending, vamp on the ""book""?
Who cares?
It's movie making at the level of Michael Mann!
If you enjoy any of the series, don't let the ""Original"" go unseen!
Get, ""ManHunter""!

748236,4,6303954103,"MANHUNTER is the 1986 crime-thriller that began Michael Mann's career as a respected filmmaker.  Adapted from the novel ""Red Dragon"" by Thomas Harris, this film will be remembered as ""the film with the OTHER Hannibal Lecter"" and will dismissed by many as a good first try, but nothing special.  CSI's William Petersen stars as Will Graham, a gifted FBI agent who is working to track down a mysterious killer nicknamed the ""Tooth Fairy"" before the next full moon.  Aiding him in his hunt is the (curiously mispelled) criminal genius Hannibal Lecktor, played by Brian Cox.  Being a huge fan of the Hannibal Lecter film series and Harris' novels, I have more to work with than some other people.  MANHUNTER was adapted and directed by Michael Mann, who also produced ""Miami Vice"" - and it shows on the glittering design and stunning soundtrack.  The acting is okay, but is great only in the cases of Petersen and Dennis Farina (who also featured on ""Miami Vice"", as well as certain other people who appear in the film).  Mann's direction is the greatest part of the film.  Brian Cox's performance as ""Lecktor"" works fine, but is completely incomparable to that of Anthony Hopkins, who played him in the later films.  MANHUNTER has been unfairly dismissed as a piece of crap.  It's no masterpiece, I'll grant you that, but the fact that the film is so dated, and the work that people like Mann and Petersen have done, make it a wonderful, ""Miami Vice""-esque thriller.",1087862400,,1463,4.792828685258964

748279,3,6303954103,"I know Manhunter is somewhat dated and has a very 80s feel to it, but this was a very well-done, creepy film with decent acting and decent directing.  Unfortunately, the powers that be (which I suppose in this case is director Michael Mann) have made it so that out of the 4 or 5 different VHS and DVD releases of this film, not one has ever been of the actual theatrical film.  Even though these new DVD releases have some new footage put in, there are several short scenes from the original cut that have always been chopped out of these home releases, for some unknown reason.  This particular release includes some new clips that add nothing to the plot of the movie and actually make you like some of the lead characters less; they were better off left on the cutting room floor, as they were originally.  What makes these new scenes most distracting is that their quality is terrible, so you'll be watching a crisp, high-quality scene and all of a sudden a little grainy, awful-looking clip will appear, having been spliced back in, and then the picture quality suddenly goes to perfect again.  Very distracting.  I've never seen a director's cut of a film done this way, and I hope I never do again.  Most directors would cringe at the thought of saying, ""Yes, this is my perfect vision of how this film should have looked, even with these horrible-looking clips included.""  To get the best experience of this movie, stick with the 2001 release.  This one is only interesting for one viewing, and only then just for hard-core fans of the film whose curiosity is piqued.",1075334400,7,1576,4.6

748281,5,6303954103,"Manhunter the restored director's cut is the most comprehensive version of the film and the transfer was supervised by Michael Mann, but the source print doesn't look like it's in as good of shape as the one used in the Anchor Bay 2001 theatrical version DVD release. I am referring to all of the scenes. The color is more washed out and there is more film grain present than the 2001 release. The picture has a darker look to it, the lush colors of the 2001 release are lacking. The opening scene is framed differently and is grainier than the other version. The scenes edited back into the movie are of horrible quality, and add little to the film, but nevertheless work very well. The opening credits appear as Will Graham is asked to help track the Tooth Fairy on the beach instead of shortly before. There is an extra scene with Will and Molly having a telephone conversation, along with an extension of a scene with Dennis Farina. The most noticeable difference is the end where an additional scene is provided where Graham visits the Jacobis, which on the theatrical release were only referred to. The shootout between the Tooth Fairy and Graham is edited a little different too. I prefer the 2001 DVD for this scene, but that's just me. This version of the film is in Dolby Digital 2.0 instead of Dolby 5.1 used in the 2001 release. The sound isn't going to test your home theater, but does exhibit decent separation. This movie is a Super 35 movie which shows more grain than anamorphic 2.35 or Academy Flat 1.85. This also means that both DVD versions show more width than what you might have seen on TV, or the VHS release, but are matted and show less height. This is just the Super 35 process which allows more flexiblity in framing. This is the version Michael Mann intended for you to see, still if you like the film, the 2001 DVD release isn't a let down because of the slightly better transfer. The director's cut print doesn't seem to be in as good of shape. Highly recommended.

These murders are suspected to have been the work of notorious serial killer known as The Tooth Fairy. Interested enough by the case, Graham makes use of profiling, or tries to think exactly like the killer in order to gain clues regarding his various whereabouts. He consults the incarcerated psychopathic psychiatrist that put him into retirement through near-fatal violence, Hannibal Lecktor (Brian Cox), for further clues. Graham is put into considerable danger when Lecktor warns The Tooth Fairy via phone of the case. It is only a matter of time before The Tooth Fairy will create another victim.

748284,5,6303954103,"My first Michael Mann movie was ""Heat"", a stunning drama in itself. When I saw ""The Insider,"" I was hooked on to his style. This movie predates the other two, so this is where his style must have developed. Lots of wide-angled shots, a fluid narrative and some astonishingly riveting music (the soundtrack is hard to find btw, it is a collector's item now and boy does it deserve to be!)
Manhunter was the first movie adaptation of Tom Harris' book called ""The Red Dragon"". Although this is a Hannibal Lecktor movie (yes, with a ""K"") the role of Hannibal is not that prominent here, although what little there is does leave a malevolent tinge. Apparently, Brian Cox (as Lecktor here) caused a lot of furore in 1986 but after having seen Anthony Hopkins thrice in the quietly sinister role I must say he is unmatched. The voice of Hopkins has much more current than Cox's. IMHO.
With the exception of Hopkins though, whom I prefer, almost everyone in this film is more compelling than the newer movies (Silence of the lambs, Hannibal, Red Dragon.)
I found William Petersen as FBI manhunter Will Graham much more appealing than Jodie Foster's or Julian Moore's Clarice Starling. Petersen's portrayal of Graham as the haunted, introspective, reluctant hero is more complex and believable...you get the sense that he is driven by inner demons to solve the crime he is faced with, but doesn't really want to be there and would much rather spend the remainder of his days in the bosom of his family on the beaches of Captiva Island.
The centerpiece of the film though is the terrifying portrayal of psychotic killer Francis Dollarhyde by the underrated but talented actor Tom Noonan. Noonan's hulking build seems a stark contrast to his character's quiet, introverted, soft-spoken persona, which hides the inner embodiment of pure, psychotic evil. Here is a guy who runs a photo lab by day but returns every night to a spooky, surreal lair which obviously reflects his inner psychosis, which he has learned to hide from view. The symbolism of his relationship with the blind Reba (Joan Allen) is obvious. His character is able to present a normal appearance to everyone around him yet goes out on the night of a full moon and slaughters whole families whose pictures he has processed, simply to fulfill his fantasies.
Give this film a go if you can manage the tension and the buildup to the shattering climax. Then give the family a hug afterwards, and make sure your doors and windows are locked at night. Mann's filmmaking has a way to make your skin crawl.",1066089600,8,2553,4.765237020316027
748285,5,6303954103,"What can I possibly add that 300 + reviews haven't already stated.
I know after watching Red Dragon (the Brett Ratner version) I wanted to write Michael Mann a personal letter (definitely not my style!!!) thanking him for the beautiful movie he made in 1986 called Manhunter.
It has always been one of my favourite, must have movies, and after seeing Red Dragon, I now knew why. For those who Silence of the Lambs/Hannibal/Red Dragon were first introductions to these characters, I wish they had only been acquainted with 'Manhunter' first, but generational and promotional gaps can't be helped. Mann's film was low budget, but he presented one of the most influential crime films of its time. The style and atmosphere were an inspiration to many a movie and television drama after it, despite its lack of monetary backing.
I rewatched Manhunter after Red Dragon, and even noticed that Jodie Foster played her character in Silence of The Lambs much like Petersen did, even down to facial twitches when speaking to Hannibal. There's something about the Frankenstein Dungeon atmosphere of the 90's adaptions of Hannibal that has always for me 'telegraphed' the menace of the cannibal psychologist, but I always felt that Anthony Hopkins was brilliant as Hannibal just by the sheer menace that boiled underneath him. Great actor, and I personally feel he saves all 3 films from a slight mediocrity when held in comparison to Mann's Manhunter. Hannibal in an all- white prison cell (as in Manhunter) somehow allows the actor to ''create'' that menace in a blank space. The big difference in Hannibal's (Cox & Hopkins) is the speed in which they deliver their insanity. Hopkins is very slow and menacing, manipulative and calculating in speech, Brian Cox quick and sure-footed, adapting quickly to each situation and response as it arrives. I feel both are suited for that character. But there was something about Cox's way of getting Will Graham's home phone number in Manhunter that I found more believeable and chilling at how easy it was gotten. Hopkins is a wonderful actor, and I can only imagine what Mann could have done if given the liberty to work with him, but Cox is certainly admirable and credible in the role as well. Understated is the word. Hopkins LOOKS crazy. I'm not so sure I would go to him for psychological advice. Cox is much more approachable, and thats where the danger is.
There is so much in Mann's Manhunter that stylistically, atmospherically and artistically dwarfs the later adaptions, even though it was low budget, that I cannot even begin to describe how well this movie worked on so many levels. The main one being, the characters are so much more defined. Details from the book are somewhat left out, but what is brought in its stead is 'mood'. Dennis Farina carries the protective air over Petersen's Graham to much greater effect. The feeling is that Farina's Crawford is just as in danger of falling over the psychological 'edge' as Petersen's Graham, but he serves as a foothold for the character should they start falling. You start caring about these characters and their dependency on eachother in mad circumstances, Lecktor/Graham/Crawford and The Red Dragon/Tooth Fairy Dolarhyde. The relationships are shown and explored through camerawork and very understated acting. Everything is very low key. Until the menace begins to grow.
Brilliant film. Too bad Mann was not asked to direct Red Dragon. THAT would have been justice!",1065484800,7,3467,4.989637305699482

This limited edition set is hard to come by anymore, but might be worth it just for the extras.  The director's cut isn't much different from the original, I didn't even really notic a difference.  The original is remastered and boy does it look better!  If you want to see the difference in picture, just pop in the director's cut, which for some reason doesn't seem to have been touched at all.  This is one of the few movies by the way, in which I was actually happy and tense at the end when the good guy (William Peterson) confronts the bad guy.  This movie had me hooked the whole way though and I have to say I liked it more than the newer adaptation (cough......remake.......cough cough).  I actually like Brian Cox as hannibal lecter more than Anthony Hopkins, although it is a tough one for me to call.  The collector's booklet is really cool and a nice touch.

748346,5,6303954103,"""MANHUNTER"" is a 5 star film that has yet to receive the treatment it deserves. Technically speaking, this new DVD gets 3 stars, which is a big step up from the 1 star treatment it got in 2002. I'll dispense with the superlatives about Michael Mann's screenplay and direction and the performances of William Peterson, Tom Noonan and Brian Cox and concentrate on the merits of this new DVD edition. I became familiar with this film from a taped broadcast from The Movie Channel back in 1987 which Mann also reworked from the original theatrical release by adding the same footage included in this new edition. The only difference is the deletion of a scene in which Graham has a brief interview with the director of the institution in which Dr. Lecktor is imprisoned. In that scene, Graham becomes irritated when asked about his ability to get inside of Lecktor's fantasies. It's not an important scene, but it does help convey Graham's discomfort with the talent that makes him such an asset to the FBI. The scenes which Mann added both to that TMC release and this new edition are welcome improvements.
  There is a notice at the beginning of this edition advising that some of the footage is of less than optimum quality due to some inferior source material for scenes that were not included in the theatrical version.  That's an understatement. The image quality through 95% of this film is very good. However, several shots are of VHS quality and a few look like they were shot through cheesecloth. In the director's commentary, Mann explains this dissapointing result. But it's by far the best version available. Especially since the 2 versions released by Anchor Bay in 2002(the same distributor responsible for this new edition)are so awful.
  How many fans of this film noticed that the theatrical version released in 2002, which claimed to be widescreen, was not? I thought something looked strange, so I compared it to the tape I'd made from TMC 15 yrs. prior, which was of course in standard full screen (1.33:1) format. I found that the left & right borders of the image stopped at exactly the same point and that image which appeared at the top and bottom of the frame of the VHS was covered by the black bars on the DVD. I was amazed & appalled; they'd taken a full screen original and plastered black bars over the top & bottom and pawned it off as widescreen. The Director's Cut that was simultaneously released had the worst image quality I've ever seen on DVD. I returned my copy for a refund.
  This new edition actually is widescreen. The extras are only so-so. There's the usual theatrical trailer and production stills. Michael Mann's commentary is interesting at times, but doesn't provide much insight into the movie making experience. Unless forgotten original film negatives of the added scenes are found in some studio storeroom, it's unlikely that there will ever be a better version of this excellent film. In spite of the technical flaws, this disc is a must-have for any ""avid fan"".",1060128000,7,3013,4.782692307692308

Not gory or flashy with special effects, this film plays more on psychological themes...well obviously.

748348,3,6303954103,"First off, the movie itself is excellent. I give it 4 stars. I bought this movie back in 1987, remembering that I wanted to see it based on previews at the theaters, but I never got to see it until it came out on VHS. However, this DVD release get's 3 stars only because it's nothing really special and it's the Limited Edition's Director's Cut with the video much improved. But, it still has a glaring omission that I will cover later in this review.
I remember Showtime advertising a Director's Cut of the movie and I remember it being so much better than the theatrical version. The one scene that especially stands out in my mind is the final confrontation between Dolarhyde and Graham. First off, Graham has a 38 Bulldog special which only holds 5 rounds. Also, he is using Glazer safety slugs. In the theatrical version, Graham gets off six shots. WHOOPS! In the Director's cut, they get it right. He only fires 5 shots. Also, with Glazers, the bullet does NOT travel through the body. The whole point of Glazers is that they explode on impact, preventing them from passing through the intended target and possibly hitting someone behind them. In the theatrical version, you see blood spray after the 2nd or 3rd shot hitting the kitchen wall behind Dolarhyde. This would not happen with Glazers. Also, due to the impact and explosion of the bullet upon impact, anyone hit would have been down on the first shot.
In the director's cut, the blood spray never happens, although there is blood on the back wall. I guess Mann decided to cut out the scene that contained the spray rather than reshoot it since the director's cut came out on Showtime some couple of years after the movie was released in theatres.
With the theatrical and limited edition that Anchor Bay released, I got what I was looking for, but only to a degree.
First off, the DVD theatrical version is NOT the true theatrical version. There are extra scenes added that were NOT in the theatrical version. Also, a scene where Graham sympathizes with Dolarhyde before the final confrontation is left out for some unknown reason. The Director's Cut is still not the TRUE director's cut that I saw on Showtime because of the missing scene just mentioned. However, it was the only version available, but the picture was horrible. Colors bled and overall, it appeared to have been copied from a pirated copy on VHS. That's how bad it looked.
Much to my surprise, I was looking at a local store and saw the Restored Director's Cut. I was excited to finally have what was not given to us before. Or, so I thought. I guess the sentence that sold me was the one on the back of the DVD case: ""The restoration of this Director's Cut was overseen by Michael Mann to bring you the definitive version of this chilling classic."" I guess I thought since Mann oversaw this version, I figured it would have the complete movie in it.
To begin with, unlike the theatrical version that Anchor Bay released, this is only in Dolby 2.0. Not a big problem. The picture through MOST of this version is excellent. Apparently, they used the theatrical version for most of the movie. However, you can tell when it switches to the director's cut scenes because they are not as crisp and clear as the theatrical scenes, but it is still a big improvement over the first Anchor Bay Director's Cut. However, the scene with Graham sympathizing with Dolarhyde is STILL missing. The actual scene is as follows:
Agent Jack Crawford FBI: You feel sorry for him.
Will Graham: As a child, my heart bleeds for him. Someone took a little boy and turned him into a monster. But as an adult... as an adult, he's irredeemable. He butchers whole families to fulfill some sick fantasy. As an adult, I think someone should blow the ... out of his socks.
This scene is still absent for whatever reason and many of us fans feel it is too bad that it's missing. It's a powerful statement that actually hints as to what drives Dolarhyde to become such a brutal killer. It actually coincides with what is explained about Dolarhyde in the book.
What is nice is to have Michael Mann's commentary. At one point, he does briefly explain that DEG went bankrupt in the 1980s, making it impossible to find the original film prints for many of the scenes. So, this possibly explains the reason why the Director's Cut scenes are still grainy and also why the ommitted scene is still missing. It's too bad, but apparently, there are European versions of the theatrical release that contain the missing scene, so why they could get ahold of it, but Anchor Bay could not doesn't make much sense.
Other than that, this DVD doesn't have much to offer. There are still pictures of deleted and alternate scenes, a trailer, and those with a DVD ROM can read the script in PDF format. Since many scenes were filmed with Tom Noonan with the Red Dragon tatoo on him, it's too bad they couldn't have put those into a deleted scenes section. But, then again, maybe due to DEG going bankrupt, they couldn't find the original prints for those scenes.
If you have the Limited Edition and theatrical version, keep it since there is nothing else special about this DVD. Still, to have a better looking Director's Cut, this DVD is worth it.
Due to the lack of special features (except for Mann's commentary) AND the still missing scene, this DVD release gets a 3-star rating. Still, it's worth having to complete your Hannibal collection (and I still think it's better than the remake, although that's a good movie as well).",1059004800,4,5511,4.618756371049949
748349,5,6303954103,"Even though RED DRAGON released last year ...
This adaptation was made four years before SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and was based on the earlier Thomas Harris novel RED DRAGON. They did not call it RED DRAGON, because there was another movie that year with DRAGON in the title that did not do so well...and the studio feared it would get confused with that film. It's driected by Michael Mann who is famous for MIAMI VICE, and yes it shows in this film. But it's a grueling fast-paced reality-based thriller similar to SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. Big challenge is they had to vocalize Will Graham's thoughts in the book into actual lines in the movie. Sometimes you can tell the film was made on a smallish budget in the mid-80s, but on the whole? It holds up today as a great adaptation of a great book! It's a fun movie, and if you are a fan of the other thrillers like SILENCE OF THE LAMBS this will be right up your alley. Yes, there is a wonderful appearance by Hannibal the infamous cannibal -- though not much is made of his modus operandi. He is never referred to as a cannibal. But Brian Cox's portrayal is strong if brief. The real stars here are the actors portraying Will Graham and the killer. Both give creepy a human edge as they play cat and mouse with each other. And fans of Joan Allen -- her portrayal of the blind Reba is amazingly well done. Sexy and stylish, not too much gore, and very tight pacing. I can't be more effusive about this movie.
DIVIMAX DVD presentation of the film with added scenes before only seen on television showings.  The only problem with that is you see a difference in the film quality when they go to these scenes. They really don't add too much, but worth a look.  Also in this version is a commentary from Michael Mann.  He's not as chatty as some directors, but gives you a good idea of what he wanted out of this thriller.",1058918400,,1863,4.347701149425287
748350,5,6303954103,"I know Silence of the Lambs is more popular in the series than this one, but I think this is a better movie. It stars William Petersen as Will Graham, a semi-retired FBI profiler, who is called into service to catch a highly methodical serial killer. Will has the unique ability to get into the killers' mind, see what he sees, understand the motives behind the crimes. Only problem is when he gets so close, lets all those bad thoughts in, it's difficult to deal with them, as they sort of poison his mind. This, along with the physical injuries he sustained on a previous case, forced him to go into semi-retirement/seclusion with his family.

At the time this movie came out, I got the feeling that profiling of serial killers was a fairly new science, and not yet deemed as useful of a tool as it could be. This is represented in the meeting Will attends with a group of FBI agents who are working on the new case, with the killer named 'The Tooth Fairy'. It's not that they derided him when he presented the information in the course of his profiling, but you felt like they looked at him like he was making psychic predictions and his input wasn't all that credible. That was my opinion, and I may be wrong. Anyway, it was amazing to go with Will to the murder scenes and see things they way he saw them, that is to say they way the killer may have seen them. He uncovers clues missed during previous investigations, clues that help to further along the case against the ever elusive Tooth Fairy.

Some really great scenes involve Will visiting Dr. Hannibal Lecktor, played by Brian Cox. While I thought Anthony Hopkins did a great job in the part in the following movies, I will always visualize Brian Cox as Lecktor. He brought such a subtle and sublime presence to the part, and underlying evil that is so evident that his prison walls, while managing to keep his physical being, seems unable to contain his spirit of evil. Will visits Dr. Lecktor, the most recent serial killer he caught and the one that made him leave the work behind, to try and develop the scent, so to speak, get the feeling back, to track this new killer.  Another thing I really enjoyed was the methodical investigation performed by the FBI. They weren't made to look like a bunch of fools, in that clues just fell out of the sky and the case solved itself. The scene where the letter from the killer to Lecktor is scrutinized but different groups within the FBI was really fascinating. It was amazing to see how much they could do with so little information.

Dennis Farina has a great role as FBI section chief Jack Crawford, the person who brings Will back into the world that he tried to put out of his life. He knows Will is the best, even if he doesn't understand his methods. He shows a genuine friendship for Will, concern for when he thinks Will is getting in too deep, but has to travel a fine line between friendship and duty, which sometimes gets blurred and causes conflicts. One of my favorite lines in the movie is when Will and Jack are arguing about it being too late to catch the killer, as the killer operates within a certain time frame, and Will is unwilling to give up, telling Jack ""I'll tell you when it's over!"" with such conviction. And Tom Noonan does a great job portraying the killer, who always manages to seem a little off kilter with the world around him, out of sync, but sort of hidden from view, like something always in your peripheral vision but never in plain sight.  The scene where the FBI eventually catches up to the killer is one of the most memorable movie moments for me. The music combined with the visuals is incredible. The movie really kept my attention throughout, but the end kept me riveted.

This version looks really good, and I did notice that a few scenes were added, hence the director's cut, and I think they added to the movie. The high definition transfer looks really good. There is also a new commentary by the director, Michael Mann, trailers, promotional stills, advertising materials, and alternate and deleted scenes. On thing I did notice was in some of the pictures, the serial killer has a rather large tattoo on his back, with what looks like wings, but wasn't present in the movie. It looked pretty amazing, and I haven't listen to the director's commentary to see if he explains not using that visual effect, but I would be interested to know why it wasn't used.  This movie will stay with you awhile, and holds up extremely well to repeated viewings. Another really good movie with William Petersen was the one he made before Manhunter, called To Live and Die in LA, which also stars Willem Dafoe. It's not as good as this one, but just as taut and highly intensive viewing, but not on DVD at the time this review was written.

748351,4,6303954103,"Before Jonathan Demme's Academy Award winning Silence of the Lambs graced the screen with Anthony Hopkins in all of his visceral glory, Michael Mann's little remembered (and seen) thriller, Manhunter presented a very different kind of Hannibal Lector. While Demme's film opted for over-the-top performances and needlessly gory scenes of violence, Mann's film took a subtler, creepier approach to its material. Manhunter is less interested in depicting the actual killings (the main attraction of this genre when it became popular) than in the cerebral and actual legwork required to enter the killer's frame of mind and track him down.
Anchor Bay had previously released Manhunter on an excellent two-DVD ""Limited Edition"" set that featured a re-mastered work print (which they mistakenly billed as the ""theatrical"" cut) and a poor looking director's cut taken from video tape. Both versions featured footage not seen in the actual theatrical release or on VHS. Anchor Bay received so much flak for the substandard version of the director's cut that they had Mann personally supervise a re-mastered version of his preferred cut of the movie.
For fans who bought the Limited Edition set, hold on to your copy because this version has none of the featurettes or the creatively packaged booklet that came with that version. Upon closer scrutiny, it also becomes apparent that Mann did not include all of the added scenes in the Limited Edition's Director's Cut (LEDC). For example, on track 7 when Graham goes to meet Lecktor in his cell the LEDC has him meet with Dr. Chilton briefly who tries to bait Graham much in the same fashion as the Atlanta Police. This footage is not in the Restored Director's Cut. This means that this new DVD is yet another version (bringing the total, if you count the old VHS version, up to four).
Having said that, this version is certainly required viewing for fans of Mann and of Manhunter because of the audio commentary that he contributes to the DVD. While there are the occasional lulls, Mann talks at length and very eloquently about the themes of the movie. He points out that that this was one of the first films to feature a main character who is a profiler of serial killers. Both these terms were not as common as they are today. Mann also talks about his admiration for Thomas Harris' novel and explains that in regards to Lecktor's screen time he opted for the ""less is more"" approach because the psychiatrist was such a charismatic character. However, while Mann does acknowledge the added footage, he doesn't always explain why he put it back in, nor does he talk about some of the footage he has subsequently cut, like an excellent monologue delivered by Graham in regards to his feelings about Dollarhyde.
Also included are a theatrical trailer and a rather sizable still gallery that consists of production stills, deleted/alternate scenes and posters and advertising materials. While the production stills are a welcome addition, the deleted scenes photos and movie posters are nothing new if you have access to the two excellent Manhunter websites on the Internet...",1058745600,3,3117,4.996153846153846
748352,5,6303954103,"If you haven't checked out this, the first ""Hannibal Lector"" (or ""Lecktor"" as it is spelled in Manhunter) film you are certainly missing a hidden gem of the mid-80s.  Why this movie was a box-office bomb is beyond me -- perhaps a limited budget, lesser known (at the time) stars, bad push by the studio, who knows.  This film is one of the best in its genre if you go into it without a lot of expectations set by ""Silence of the Lambs"".
William Petersen has become one of my favorite actors and you can see a bit of ""Grissom"" from CSI in his portrayal of Will Graham, the FBI profiler protagonist of this film.  However, the character is very unique and Petersen, a master of the stage, jumped into this, only his second film, rather well.  His portrayal of someone on the edge, someone who becomes disturbed himself by putting himself in the minds of the disturbed is simply amazing.  I don't know if Petersen says there's some Graham in Grissom but I would bet he would.
Petersen and Brian Cox are simply brilliant on the screen together and the four fellows I mention above: Petersen, Brian Cox (Hannibal Lecktor), Dante Spinotti (cinematography), and Michael Mann (director) really shine in the Lecktor scenes.  First of all, Petersen and Cox have an energy playing off of each other that is simply amazing.  These are different characters than ""Lambs"" and the portrayal is totally unique.  Petersen is going where he doesn't want to go, Cox knows it and toys with his prey, Spinotti's use of color and lighting are intense and Mann tops it all off with unique camera angles and use of the geometry of the bars and other parts of the set.  This scene from ""Manhunter"" should be part of any Cinema 101 course if it isn't already.  Like other reviewers, I liked Cox's portrayal of Lecktor in a more subdued and subtle fashion.  No, there aren't any great catch lines or funny sounds, just great subtle acting, it's the nuances that make the performance stick with you.
Finally, the finale is simply astounding with the use of Iron Butterfly's ""In A Gadda Da Vida"" both in buidling of tension and timing.  It's truly a blazing ending and the editing is equally blazing.  The use of quick flashbacks is a gripping portrayal of such a traumatic event and to anyone who's experienced trauma it should seem very unsettling and very real.
""Lambs"" was a brilliantly done film but so is ""Manhunter"" with far less of a budget and star power to go on.  The best comparison I can think of to ""Manhunter"" came from the same time period -- ""Terminator"" was similar is its brilliance, it's lack of initial box office draw, and its rabid cult following.  Both were done on shoestring budgets and both are impressive to watch, mid-80s warts and all.  Some reviews I have read on this film have been rather pathetic, criticizing wardrobe of all things.  I suppose these same people criticize ""Gone With the Wind"" for having such an ""1860s"" wardrobe.
As far as the DVD this review is related to the first one (Aug 2002 release) that is not the Director's Cut or Divamax version.  I found the transfer to be splendid, I didn't notice a single problem with it.  The sound was better than I expected for a movie of this age and I believe was taken from the film's 70mm soundtrack, though it may have been remastered.  The extras are token but nice (I hate gaggles of extras anyway).  All in all this is one of the best [money] you will ever spend and will leave you near breathless when it is done.  Can't praise this film more, Mann showed Heat was no accident and put himself on the auteur map with this film.",1057968000,,3592,4.553654743390358
748353,5,6303954103,"I was a huge fan of Manhunter when it was released in the early 80's but never liked the home video releases. The transfers never did it justice. This new disc finally restores the film to its glory. First off, the new digital transfer supervised by Michael Mann is awesome, crisp and saturated with color, whisking me back to 1986. There are flaws, however. Certain added scenes are not as crisp, making a jarring transition in the middle of the action. One exchange between Graham and Lector is like this, as is Will's visit to the family at the end. Mann explains (in his quirky commentary) that DEG went bankrupt in the late 80s and that the original footage for some of the lost scenes was never recovered. So c'est la vie. One other note: beware that there are NO additional or alternate scenes on this disc, just an alternate scene ""gallery"" which has stills from some oddities like the Tooth Fairy in full Dragon tattoos.

William Petersen is a much more believeable Will Graham than whoever in ""Dragon,"" and as the story was partially set in Atlanta, GA, it is nice seeing Atlanta landmarks in the movie.  (Although using the High Arts Museum as the asylum that Graham ran screaming out of is kind of...uh...).  And Tom Noonan's Francis Dolarhyde is as definitive a character a Hopkin's Lecter, MUCH more believeable and scary than his ""Dragon"" interpretation.  My only gripe is that neither ""Manhunter"" or ""Red Dragon"" were true to the story at the end, but I guess that's Hollywood: ""Have A Nice Day and a happy ending.""",1055980800,,706,4.858333333333333
748427,4,6303954103,"Let me start by saying this film, ""Manhunter"", is a fairly good adaptation of the book. Brian Cox portrays a mellower Hannibal Lecktor (as spelled in the ending credits, if I recall correctly). His performance is good, energetic, and he has the perfect face for an antagonist. His evil, however, does not show that much in this film, therefore he is not that scary, in my opinion. Obviously, he's killed people, and obviously his insanity comes back to haunt the semi-retired detective Will Graham, but I don't have any recollection of explanation about Hannibal's cannibalistic murders. Since we don't know much about the character, he is less scary, regardless of Brian Cox's good performance. Don't get me wrong; Hannibal is still really awesome in this movie! Will Graham, I thought, was portrayed well. He's haunted by his past with Dr. Lecktor, and now, working on this case again, he is disturbed because he must dig deep within the mind of the serial killer who is on the loose in order to figure out the mystery. The main problem that sticks out in this movie is the serial killer, Francis Dolarhyde, the Red Dragon. He is played well, but we don't have a real sense of his psyche. There isn't much explanation as to why he is brutally murdering people. And, his admiration of the Red Dragon painting is only mentioned about once or twice throughout the movie. Aside from these flaws, ""Manhunter"" is a well-made film, with some creepy images, and it is delightful entertainment. It's a strange, different thriller, that depends on implied violence rather than graphic violence. The problem with this is that we don't always get a full look into the horror of the story. Still, I'd recommend it, because it's fun to watch and see some of the little differences between this and the superior 2002 version ""Red Dragon"". Both are creepy and entertaining films.",1055635200,,1865,4.849529780564263

Mann did, though, write a creditable script and select a fine cast. What is, for me, the most significant aspect of the film is Brian Cox as Hannibal. Cox is a long-term, well-established member of the British theater community--a splendid actor (who often plays American in bash-em-up/shoot-em-up/blow-em-up US films). His scenes with FBI man Petersen (who has gone on to CSI fame, and deservedly so) are creepy and chilling. What Anthony Hopkins tries to accomplish with his over-the-top performances, Cox accomplishes in only a matter of minutes: the personification of brilliant malevolence. Hannibal is, after all, a shrink. And Cox uses the character's background to perfection in worming his way into Petersen's sensitivities to undermine the man.
There are some genuinely frightening scenes; there are also some stylistic touches that do a disservice to the overall effect. At moments the film looks like Miami Vice: too stylized, too primary-colored, too soundtracked. That said, though, of all the films of Thomas Harris books (discounting Black Sunday) this is the one that hits closest to the heart of what Harris actually wrote. See this, if for nothing else, for Brian Cox's goosebump-raising performance.

748432,2,6303954103,I do not agree with many of the reviews of this movie. Sure it may be ok for a low budget film but it still isn't good. The movie follows the book Red Dragon very nicely but that isn't a good thing. Sure Red Dragon was a great book but this movie is like listening to the book Red Dragon on an audio tape. It is just too boring. They needed to focus more on Francis Dollarhyde and less on the FBI agents. If they had focused on Dollarhyde and showed the reasons for why he is the way he is and shown what Dollarhyde feels and the ways he thinks hes becoming the Red Dragon this would have been a much better film. One important part that happened in the book that this films lacks is the scene where Dollarhyde feels he is loosing the fight to the Dragon and lossing his mind and goes to the museum and eats the picture. This is a very important part of the book and shows how Dollarhyde wants to change. Then the ending of this movie kills it. The new movie Red Dragon at least some what followed the true ending of the book. The ending of this is made up and is very dull. This was definatly not a huge film but I expected so much more from it.,1046044800,,1146,4.008733624454148
748433,4,6303954103,"I can understand why this movie is under-rated. The fact is, that it was made in the 80's before the major movie ""The Silence of the Lambs"" came out, making Hannibal Lecter famous. So, when we look back now and see a movie with Lecter in it, and see that it is not Hopkins playing him, or that it isn't made as well as the newer Lecter movies, most people under rate it.
But if you look past all that bull, this is a really good movie. ""Manhunter"" is based on Harris's ""Red Dragon"", the first book in the Lecter Trillogy. The movie follows the novel semi well, taking a few turns that are unexpected away from the book.  But other than a few parts, the movie is a great suspense flick.
Even though the new movie ""Red Dragon"" is out with Hopkins as Lecter and Norton as Will Graham, you shouldn't pass this one up. If anything, watch them both.  Don't expect incredible acting, because the actors in this flick are far from awesome, but not so bad that you can't even sit through the whole movie.

He also nicely handles the fragile line that separates the Lecter's from the rest of the world, and how close we all are to becoming Lecter's.
Mann is one of the best at conveying the poetry of urban life.  While this isn't as typical of his style, he does manage to turn some ordinary places into terrific visuals.
This films Dollarhyde is also far more frightening.  When the climax reveals his identity, it chills you to realize how 'normal' he is.

748485,4,6303954103,"In Manhunter, Michael Mann's direction of the novel Red Dragon shows a far different approach to the Lecter-type characterization in the later terrorizing cinemas such as Silence of the Lambs-another one of Thomas Harris' novels-turned-movies. Though similar to the Silence of the Lambs in its format, it shows entirely different perspectives such as in the investigation by the FBI and in the character of the ""insane"" Hannibal Lektor (spelled Lektor in this movie). The film's strongest points are in its direction and music score, which both add great depth to achieve the suspense and horror of Harris' original novel.
The story is about an ex-FBI agent Will Graham, played by William Petersen (from TV's ""C.S.I.""), being called back to duty to assist in finding the serial killer nicknamed ""The Toothfairy"", played by Tom Noonan. It is exposed that Graham has caught one of the other great serial killers, the former Psychiatrist Hannibal Lektor, played by Brian Cox, and can consult with Dr. Lektor for help. Given only nine days to complete his case, Graham has to quickly find this serial killer to save the lives of innocent people.
Michael Mann's meticulous design of sets, even though the lack of money and current technology are obvious, portrays a beautiful light in every scene. The camera's off-tempo and staccato shifts match the story's suspense masterfully, and the overbearing power of certain colors-matched for their poignant significance to the scene-assists in conveying to the viewer a sense of visual emotion. Also, as the Silence...used Q. Lazzarus' song ""Goodbye Horses"" to characterize the serial killer, Manhunter also uses music (Iron Butterfly's In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida) to set the tone for the killer. In the few occasions Lektor is contacted by Will Graham, a suspenseful, horrifying experience is expressed to the viewer, more accurate to Harris' novel than that done by Anthony Hopkins in the latter Hannibal movies. Unfortunately, unlike Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal, the genius Lektor-though the mastermind behind the movie-is scarcely on-screen; instead, influence is turned to the ex-FBI agent Will Graham and his ability to mold in to the psyche of the killers he tracks. The Toothfairy, played by Tom Noonan, was not allowed to mingle with the other actors on the set to create a sense of mystery and fear when they finally met on screen. Actor William Petersen himself described the aura of his scenes with the serial killer as ""compelling and repelling, at the same time.""
Director Michael Mann's low-budget film Manhunter, which was to be originally named ""Red Dragon"" but changed because it sounded too much like a karate movie, is the most accurate representation of any of Thomas Harris' novels yet.

Still, the movie, as the first installment of the Hannibal trilogy, is so much better when compared to the recent 'Red Dragon' flick, which retells the same story, with different actors and a different ending.
The plot follows detective Graham (William Petersen) out of retirement, and asking for the help of Dr. Lector (Brian Cox) - he later became Dr. Lecter- whom he personally captured in the past, in order to catch a new serial-killer on the loose (Tom Noonan).
I have to admit, seeing Brian Cox as the Hannibal made me feel strange at the beginning. For me, and many others, the role of Hannibal will unarguably be linked with a certain actor, called Anthony Hopkins. But if you manage to overcome this single shock, you will start realizing how 'Manhunter' succeeds in what 'Red Dragon' fails. To build a convincing atmosphere.
For one thing, the acting is far superior in 'Manhunter'. In 'Red Dragon' there are cases where you feel that even the actors do not believe in their lines, which is a big waste if you take into account the superb cast. What about Dolarhyde? Ralph Fiennes in 'Red Dragon' does a good job. Yet in many cases you see that he is acting, or even, over-acting. Tom Noonan in 'Manhunter' is so natural in the same part. You can sense his inner struggle, without seeing it. There is also a scene where he holds a blind woman in his arms. His reactions, the movement of his hands, the way he lays his head upon her shoulder, clearly reveal his vulnerable and shy self.
Furthermore, 'Red Dragon' decides to explain everything to the viewer as if the latter will be unable to understand by himself. It has to show us why Graham decided to retire early. In a sequence that vividly brings to mind Hitchcock's 'Psycho' it has to detail the roots of Dolarhyde's wounded psyche. It even attempts to loudly explain, through the words of Harvey Keitel, about the 'supernatural' charisma that detective Graham possesses, in order to justify the fact that he will later use it to solve the murder cases. 'Manhunter' on the other hand, does none of the above. All these facts, crucial for the development of the plot, are not explicitly stated. Rather than that, they are implied, and thus, the viewer has to discover them by himself, making the whole experience more fulfilling.
As for the ending, 'Red Dragon' decides to go for the extra suspense, for the final fear. On the other hand, 'Manhunter' chooses a much simpler road. Many would probably argue that the former fits better with the rest of the movie. Still, in my opinion, 'Manhunter' does well even in this case, bringing the film to its natural ending.

Michael Mann who brought tears to my eyes with his gunfight in Heat, absolutely crafted a masterpiece here. After multiple viewings, this thing holds up as well as Silence yet no Oscars and no Jodie Foster on board. She could have made Hannibal something special.
When compared with Red Dragon 2002, Sir Anthony has become a bit of a washed up Democrat. Just cant believe him. Kind of the Fritz Mondale of the screen. Turn in the mask, you were wonderful in Silence and Hannibal (De Palma can do no wrong). But Ratner?? wasn't he the dork in Fast Times?? hehe.

Minus points: flat plotting, unadventurous acting, the ending is changed to a ""feel-good"" cop-out, and most importantly the villain is never allowed really to blossom into his full hideous tattooed self. He remains a great big lumbering cipher, and Hannibal is almost invisible: result, the only character to engage you is the brought-out-of-retirement detective, and he's busy trying to act ""tortured but fascinated"" by looking confused or (more often) constipated throughout. Compare it to ""Silence of the lambs"": Cox just doesn't match up to Hopkins at all. Most of all, ""Silence"" has atmosphere, and a creative intelligence prowling behind the camera: ""Manhunter"" feels like a cheap made-for-TV little number. The cinematography is frequently from the ""nice postcard of sunset over the bay"" school. Read the book instead. I haven't seen the remake yet, but it has to be better. Final point: the soundtrack is only appropriate as the film has been made as a nasty little thriller rather than the horror film they should have attempted.

748586,2,6303954103,"I have been a fan of this film ever since I first saw it on VHS fifteen years ago. And with the passage of time, MANHUNTER has not lost much of its power. If you can get past the obvious stylistic comparison with Michael Mann's other project at that time, ""Miami Vice,"" then I think you will find this to be as well made a detective thriller as there has been in our generation. It really is an excellent precursor to later genre films such as SEVEN.
Personally, I prefer Brian Cox's version of Hannibal Lecter more than Anthony Hopkins', because Cox is much subtler in his ways than Hopkins. When Cox's Hannibal has a phone brought to his cell and proceeds to manipulate several people, and does it with all the nonchalance of a man enjoying bacon and eggs in the morning, it's the most frightening scene in the film because you get the strong idea this guy can do anything. There is no equivalent scene in any of Hopkins' portrayals because Hopkins never cares to hide the character's evil. Hopkins chose to play Lecter like a wild animal or a modern day Dracula, while I believe Cox is much scarier because his capabilities are hidden behind a mask of relative normality. Nevertheless, people tend to like the version of Lecter they saw first, and I'm no different.
That being said, I must warn you, dear movie fan, to avoid purchasing the MANHUNTER Limited Edition set and consider the regular widescreen version instead. Whereas the ""Theatrical Version"" (Disc 1) is sharp and well presented in almost every way, the ""Director's Cut"" DVD (Disc 2) seems to have been created as a careless afterthought, and from an incredibly poor source print. The image is very grainy and washed out, with no sharpness or depth, and it looks for all the while like a second-rate TV print crammed onto a 2.35:1 format, or maybe even a simple transfer from a VHS copy! Yeah, it's that bad. It's possible the only source print of the director's version was formatted just for TV (and I think it was never screened in theaters), but there is no excuse for presenting this version of the film in such a raw, unrestored, unfaithful form. Also consider that there are NO extras whatsoever on the second disc, and you realize you're paying a premium price for literally no added value. Just the first few minutes of the film on Disc 2 gave me the distinct impression that Michael Mann had nothing to do with this release, because he would frankly be ashamed to issue such an inferior product. The film clearly deserves better treatment than this. It's almost as if it's a deliberate attempt by Anchor Bay (the distributor) to minimize Mann's adjustments in favor of its original catalogue print. Considering the price I paid for the limited-edition set, I honestly feel ripped off, and you will be, too, if you decide not to heed this advice. Four stars for the ""Theatrical Version"" and an overly generous one star for the terrible ""Director's Cut.""
Here's hoping that Michael Mann will someday create a definitive, comprehensive version of MANHUNTER so that this shameful release can be forgotten.",1036627200,5,3078,4.712430426716141

I saw Anthony Hopkins in the role before I saw Cox so when I started to watch Manhunter, I just couldn't bring myself to finish it. Especially when I found out the Mann decided to leave out Dolarhyde's tattoo. THAT TATTOO ""MICHAEL"" HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH WHO DOLARHYDE IS. That tattoo shows the audience just who(what) he THINKS he is. I'm sorry, I watched the Documentary before the film, and when I heard that they left the tattoo out, that completely alienated me from this movie. Sorry Mann, but Jonathan Demme's, Brett Ratner's, AND even Ridley Scott's Lecter movies outpace yours by several miles. But if I had seen this one before all the others, then I probably would have thought that it was better than the others. I am 17 and even I know that Anthony Hopkins is great as Lecter(get the spelling through your heads LECTER).

The movie began very consistant with the book, which I read shortly before seeing both films, but after about the first thirty minutes it went off on its own tangent. The acting is cheesy, the dialogue is pourly delivered, and Brian Cox as Hanibal Lector was terrible. Tom Noonan portrayed the Dragon as some love sick teenager who would drop all that he had done for the love of a girl. It completely ignored the fact of how disturbed and tormented he was by the Dragon, which was of course his alter-ego personified in the painting by William Blake which also was curiously absent from this film. It left out all of the development of Dolarhydes character, including his love for Reba, and his attempt to control the Dragon. And the ending... oh boy, that was the worst. In this version you get to see him try to murder Reba, the only woman he ever had true human feelings for, when in the book he wanted nothing more than to let her live and keep her from the Dragons grasp. Red Dragon strayed from the book ending a bit as well, but was a little more consistent with Thomas Harris' original ending. Both films left out the inner-struggle of Will Graham and his ultimate cowardice before the Dragon which led to him losing his own family. Hollywood wants a hero, and although Will leads to the destruction of the Dragon, he was not a hero. Both films made him one. Red Dragon is more consistent with the book, it developes Dolarhydes character, it has a better ending, and brings more insight to the character of Hanibal Lector.

William L. Petersen in the lead is another outstanding performance and makes Edward Norton in Red Dragon look childish in comparison. The makers of Red Dragon don't focus on this character as much as Hopkins is the star but they should have as the main story line is this character's overcoming his fears just as Clarice had to overcome hers in Silence of the Lambs. In fact every role here is played by actors you know the face but not the name. Much more stylish and slick than Red Dragon, this is the best movie you've never seen.

748591,5,6303954103,"Two points I would like to add to the general commentary beyond agreeing that this film is well worth checking out, even if it means you will never be able to listen to ""In-a-gadda-da-vida"" every again.  First, the difference between the current release ""The Red Dragon"" and this earlier adaptation of the Thomas Harris novel titled ""Manhunter"" is as clear as the difference between gray and white.  That would be the difference of the setting for Hannibal Lecter's jail cell.  In this version Brian Cox is dressed all in white in a cell with walls painted white.  Contrast that with with dark dungeon where Anthony Hopkins romps in ""The Silence of the Lambs"" et al. and it is a noticeable stylistic difference.  Take your pick for which one you think is more effective (my contention would be that you obviously do not get as much of a sense of Lecter from this film as you do in ""Silence in the Lambs"" strictly from the perspective of the script, without getting into the decidedly different nuances of the performances.
Second, ""Manhunter"" is not going to remind you of ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" it is going to reminder you of ""Miami Vice.""  This makes sense because director Michael Mann created the ""MTV Cops"" show two years before doing this film.  Then again, maybe you do not remember ""Miami Vice,"" in which case ""Manhunter"" will remind you of ""C.S.I."" because William Petersen plays the hero.
If you have waited until the new version of ""The Red Dragon"" came out to finally go back and check this one out, shame on you for waiting until your third and final opportunity for a new film to remind you that the original Hannibal Lecter had been patiently waiting in his little white cell for you to come visit.
P.S.  ""Manhunter"" should not be confused with ""The Manhunter,"" a 1974 TV pilot for a short-lived series starring Ken Howard as a Depression era bounty hunter.  Unfortunately there should not be too much confusion because the latter is not available on videotape, although it was an above average TV-movie with some potential for a series.",1034208000,,2057,4.723463687150838
748592,2,6303954103,"I for one am very very tired of so called critics and film experts extolling the virtues of this ""forgotten gem"" or ""classic"" 16 years after it BOMBED. Sad to say, sixteen years later it still leaves a lot to be desired.
Manhunter is based VERY loosely on the Harris novel and that is mistake number one. Why tamper with a good thing? The arrogance of Michael Mann is why.
When the script deviates from the novel, its characters lose their essence. They go from Harris' creations to Mann's adaptions, losing all respect for their original incarnations.
Next is the lame Miami Vice feel and look to this thriller. The only thing scary about Miami Vice is people still think its cool to wear penny loafers without socks.
The acting is next. Overall, its solid. However, there is no comparison in the Lecter field. There is a reason Hopkins won the Oscar. Cox is good, but he is not Hannibal Lecter. Hopkins inhabited the character in a legendary way. So much so that Manhunter's producer wanted to ""remake"" the film with Hopkins in as Lecter (true, it also cashes in on the Hannibal phenomenon).
Anyone who calls Red Dragon a ""remake"" of Manhunter should read the book.
The DVD edition of Manhunter suffers from a horrible, and I mean horrible, conversion. It is dark and murky. At frst I thought it was a lame attempt to hide the Miami Vice feel, but no...its just a bad conversion.
The movie is enjoyable on its own merits, but Silence is golden, Hannibal is king, and Dragon reigns supreme. That is the true trilogy, as it was originally envisioned.",1034208000,3,1550,4.619565217391305

In my opinion ""Manhunter"" is the original ""Red Dragon"" and for its time a far better product than the new release. Anthony Hopkins is joke in my book, and he completely ruins the movie. He is the complete antithesis of what Harris had in mind for the literary character of the insane Dr Lecter. For those of you who want save some money and see the original ""Red Dragon"", I suggest that one purchase ""Manhunter"" before you see ""Red Dragon.""  The only thing I will say about ""Red Dragon"" was that the Cinematography was better (obviously due to technological advances in the last fourteen years), and the portrayal of the Red Dragon serial killer was a little better.

Silience is a horror movie. while Manhunter is a cop thriller. it's that simple.
  Now that we have that out of the way we can get down to business. Manhunter follows the story of Will Graham, a retiered fbi agent, who is coxed out of ritirement by his old boss Jack Crawford. the reason Jack wants Will to come out of ritirement is to help him find the Tooth Fairy, a psycopath that has already murdered two families. Jack wants Will specifically because Will caught Hannibal lecter, a name I don't need to explain. To find the crimanal Will must get help from Hannibal. what follows is one of the greatest games of cat and mouse ever put on screen.
  There are a few things that need to be pointed out firstly this movie was made in the eighties so expect some diffirent clothing (love those short shorts!) and some great music, seccondily this movie was mad four years before Silience, so remember silience butured the characters (or saved them) from Manhunter not the other way around. secondily Hannibal lecter is not played by Anthony Hopkins but by Brian Cox, although I do like Hopkins portrail, Brian cox plays the character with more realism. and thirdly this is an absoulutly amazing film, although most of todays big summer blockbuster movie going public will probably get lost some where in the dialog and without a car crash every few minutes, this is a gem of a flick. with amazing performances by every one in the cast. they make the characters seem gritty and real. all in all go out and see this movie. and yes I have read the book red dragon, it is in fact my favorite book, and I still love the movie",1033948800,,2013,4.4471544715447155

Red Dragon was nicely done using a style similar to Silence of the Lambs. You will see scenes that will definitely spark the comparison and/or tying the movies together. As in Silence Anthony Hopkins will frighten and compell you. I was happy with all the acting. Edward Norton did a nice job but there is no doubt in my mind that William Petersen did a better job in Manhunter. I was also impressed with Ralph Fiennes job of Dolarhyde, but he was no Tom Noonan. Noonan first made me feel compassion for him then he frightened the hell out of me, Fiennes did not. Dennis Farina was a better Cop than Harvey Keitel and Stephen Lang's acting as the obnoxius reporter Freddy Lounds was far better than Phillip Hoffman's rendition. Michael Mann did a brilliant job with the casting, scenes, sets, and music that gave Manhunter a very unique style. Mann's style I think would have been better in the remake than the Brett Ratner version. The characterizations are so real that you can't turn your eyes away. The camera work and visual effects are some of the best you will ever see. This movie is intellectual and shocking. Why Thomas Harris refused to let them call Manhunter ""Red Dragon"" is beyond me. I have read all his books and Manhunter is my favorite movie made from them.

The ending improves on the book, and has the brilliant song by Iron Butterfly. This is also a very disturbing and very 80's film, which adds to the whole atmosphere.

When I went to the theater and saw 'Silence' I thought it was a comedy.  I laughed throughout.
I remember I completely gave up on the Academy Awards when it was not only nominated but won best picture.
I LOVE Anthony Hopkins.  He is one of my favorite actors on earth.....BUT he is not nor ever was what Hannibal Lector was intended to be.  Who, in their right mind, would visit a doctor like Anthony Hopkins as Lector?  The way Hopkins delivers all of his dialogue as Lector........well it's obvious you are dealing with an absolute lunatic!
Brian Cox is the only true Hannibal Lector as done in Manhunter.  Quiet and reserved and extremely more intellectual than Hopkins interpretation.  Brian also portrayed a much more frightening subtle Lector with far less screen time than Hopkins!  Hopkins Lector was seen as a superhuman serial killer that belongs more in science fiction than in a deeply more disturbing psychological thriller such as ""Manhunter.""
I think Edward Norton is one of our greatest American actors alive!  He IS NOT Will Graham!  He is miscast in Red Dragon.  William Peterson IS Will Graham!
""Silence"" and ""Hannibal"" are complete and total 'Hollywood' versions of Harris's novels.  Although ""Red Dragon"" may be more true to the novel than ""Manhunter""......'Manhunter' is infinitely FAR superior to the other movie versions of Harris's
novels.
'Manhunter' is the finest movie about the serial killer/detective genre there will ever be!  All others will be measured against it.  Even 'Seven' can't compete with it, as good as it was.

748627,3,6303954103,"The viewing audience was first introduced to the world of Hannibal Lecter in this 1986 film. It is not as informative about
Lecter as in ""Silence"", nor do we really see much of the character at all. Blink and you just might miss the character entirely. Michael Mann(""Ali"") directed this film based on Thomas Harris' 1981 book ""Red Dragon"". The film stars William Petersen(""CSI"") as Will Graham, an ex-FBI agent who retired when Lecter almost kills him. He captures Lecter and resigns. He is pulled out of retirement when a serial killer is on the loose. The killer is named Francis Dollarhyde(Played with incredible creepiness by Tom Noonan), who goes by the name 'The Tooth Fairy', and slaughters entire families. Will is called on the case but realizes he needs more help. He goes to Lecter to try to get the brillaint, but mad, psychiatrist to help him track down the killer. Same kind of format as ""Silence"", but nowhere near as good or thrilling. Brian Cox plays Hannibal Lecter here, and he is quite good. It's a different performance. I can't say he was average, but I also can't say that he was anywhere near superb enough to make anyone remember. He did his own thing and he did it very well. I never got any chills from him. I was never brought to believe him as a dangerous madman. Anthony Hopkins gave all that to me before he even opened his mouth. Cox is good, but he's not Hopkins. William Petersen has always been a fine actor, and he really carries this film. If it wasn't for him, this movie would of floundered. Tom Noonan is a great bad guy. It doesn't hurt that he has a creepy look to him. He is more scary and chilling than Cox. The film also stars Joan Allen as a blind co-worker of Dollarhyde's that he takes a liking too. She just might wind up as his next victim. The movie looks okay, but it was made in 1986 and it LOOKS like it was made in 1986. It could pass for a bigger budgeted episode of ""Miami Vice"" or something. When certain parts look like that, it's hard to take the film as serious as you should. Whereas ""Silence"" can stand the test of time, this movie can't. It seems too glossy to sustain the script's darker, edgier material. Even though the look is dated and somewhat cheesy, it is still shot well. The movie was known for not being entirely truthful to the book. What film adaption of a book is?. Something is always changed or taken out. For all it's worth, ""Manhunter"" is a enjoyable, passable thriller, but it is not anything that has the caliber of ""Silence"", or the longevity of a first rate thriller. I can't even begin to understand how some people can rate this film above ""Silence"". Ridiculous. People have mentioned they laughed at ""Silence"" and thought it was a comedy.

Let's start out with the positives, just to show that there's no hard feelings. Brian Cox was a brilliant casting choice. Most of the rest of the casting was done fairly well too, except for Tom Noonan. -Don't get me wrong, this man is a brilliant actor and he WAS very creepy in the movie.
- What was lost in the casting of Noonan, as well as a lapse in judgement in the screenwriting, was that Dolarhyde was supposed to look fairly normal, muscular even. It was his early childhood that twisted his mind into thinking he was a physically hideous monster that people couldn't stand to look at.
Just as in real life, it was this contrasting aspect of the book that was the real hooker. Your neighborhood, average looking Joe turns out to be the serial killer of the century. - While in the movie, one look at Noonan and it was no shocker that this mug was the family killer. On top of that, they made him look like some pathetic Disco Strangler!
The movie held little, or no, suspense. The pacing was bogged and boring and the cinematography was too ""Miami Vice"", yes, I know it was Mike Mann who directed it but...

748629,4,6303954103,"Manhunter was by far too intelligent for the average movie viewer to understand or appreciate.  Michael Mann's direction is very understated, and these so called pointless sequences featuring Will Graham speaking to himself require a lot more depth of thought than most people would like to apply to a movie.  Silence of the Lambs appealed to a more generic movie audience with its completely in your face visuals and obvious explanations of events.  A perfect example of Mann's directing style is the sequence with Graham seeing one of the murdered women awash in white light in the bedroom with her eyes emanating that same light while he is speaking to himself.  If you haven't read the book you won't know what I'm talking about at all, but if you have, you'll realize what Mann is trying to show viewers without hitting them over the head with it.  Most people are too lazy or just can't enjoy a movie unless everything is explained in clear detail to them.  Silence of the Lambs did that which is why it was a more successful film.  Manhunter on the other hand requires you to think and interpret the scenes put to film which is why it is an incredible movie and better than Silence of the Lambs.",1033603200,4,1202,4.615023474178404
748630,5,6303954103,"Michael Mann (Miami Vice director and a perfection in the Hitchcock school of doing some of the camera work yourself) shows the visions from the same source material can be so different.  Manhunter is from the Thomas Harris Book 'Red Dragon' the prequel, if you will, to the Silence of the Lambs, also by Harris.  It is so interesting to view both films together and see the contrasts.  Manhunter has a male, William Petersen, as FBI's fey tracker, while Lamb's focus is female through Jody Foster.  Lambs is so dark, brooding and dank, you think of bad 1950's mad scientist movies, while Manhunter is blinding awash in light.  Compare the cells of the different version of Lector.  Hopkins is house in a madhouse basement, where shadows are deep and bogeymen lurk just out of sight...Brian Cox's lector is in a pure white cell, white pants and TV shirt, so clean and sterile it evokes the slightly nauseating sense of antiseptic hospitals.  Hopkins' keeper is the kindly blackman, Benny; Cox's 'step back or I'll mace you in the face' redneck. The polarisation of these films is nearly endless, and yet both are so on target in achieving their aim.
Which do I prefer?  Hard to say, but I think in repeated watching that Manhunter edges out Lambs.  Mann 'paints' his movie in imagery that is so evocative, so compelling, but in a less is more manner that cause many to put him down as all style but no substance.  I have never bought that.  Anyone can watch ""Evan"" episode of Miami Vice or ""Out Where the Buses Don't Run"" and see there are so many layers to a Mann production - but it is for YOU to find the many textures and nuances.  If you don't, it's your loss.

The center of the story is the former FBI agent who is brought back to find the newest psychopathic, serial killer, the Tooth Fairy. He must get into the mindset of the killer to stop him.

Let me state right off that I haven't even seen SOTL.  The clips I've seen of it were too silly for me to want to watch it.  Lecktor kept in a dungeon, being strapped to a board with a goalie mask on.  Huh?  He's creepy all over - not fooling anyone.  Puhh-lease.  By contrast, MH's treatment is plausible.  Lecktor (Cox) is confined in an antiseptic cell, no one - no one - but the security guards are allowed to physically interact with him.  He's smooth; he has a two millimeter veneer that's friendly, disarming.  He sounds like the pompous, jaded academian he is.
Petersen looks grizzled - a man who's seen things, things he doesn't want to talk about.  Norton?  Looks and sounds like a college student.  How could he be cast as profiler who had to get out?  Put him in Van Wilder.
The treatment of the evidence and utilization of resources in MH - great, fascinating, believable.  Can't comment w/r/t SOTL.
MH's Francis Dollarhyde is well-blighted; tragic, but an unredeemable villain.  His awkwardness and insecurity making him forever embarassed in routine life.  As the dragon, he is diabolically mild, resolute, and powerful (which is of course why he chooses to pursue being the dragon).  Can't comment w/r/t RD.
Manhunter is not done to Hollywood excess.  That's something I like about it a great deal.  Manhunter is a great thriller.  Yes it has 80s music (duh Captain Retardo, it was made in the 80s).  Much of the soundtrack is by Shriekback; if you know them, then you know they are often haunting and creepy.  (Check the album Oil and Gold.)

It is not fair to compare the two films.  Both are classics.  But what makes ""Manhunter"" extremely compelling is the thrill-by-thrill crime-solving phases of the film.  The DVD version is awesome.  The THX sound goes right to your soul.  The storyline follows a Hitchcock pattern...and the music is nostalgic and riveting.  Five stars...nothing less.  The performance by Brian Cox as Hannibal Lecter is spine-tingling.  You wish he had more screen time when the flick is over.  The psychotic killer, portrayed by Tom Noonan, is worth all 6-foot-7 of him.  The manhunter, played by William Petersen, is brilliant and convinceable.  I shy from giving away plots, but potential viewers need to know that this film was the prelude to Silence of the Lambs.  The manhunter in this film is the FBI agent that caught Hannibal Lecter...now he desperately needs him to solve a haunting crime that has possessed his life...his psychie.
This movie is based on the book ""Red Dragon"", which is the basis of the film coming out in October, 2002.  It will be a remake of this 1986 classic (16 years later).
If you loved ""Silence of the Lambs"", you can't miss ""Manhunter"".  And for those of you who grew up in the Sixties, if you watch this flick, you'll never listen to the classic psychedelic rock song ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"" with the same set of ears or senses.

Adapted in 1986 from Thomas Harris's novel ""Red Dragon"", this plays (and reads) like a first draft of ""The Silence of The Lambs"". The stories are essentially the same: an FBI agent with an uncomfortable past seeks Lecter's help to catch a serial killer who is aiming for 'transformation' - both climax with a 'blind' woman wandering around the killer's lair waiting to be shot. The key difference is that the later book and film were better developed. Still, ""Manhunter"" is no slouch. Brian Cox plays Lecter, and it's a testament to the strength of his performance that he isn't completely overshadowed by what Hopkins later brought to the role. Cox isn't nearly as hideously maniacal (as written, the part gives him no scope to be) but in his few short scenes he manages to be thoroughly chilling. William Petersen makes the most of his part, but is hampered by indulgent, reflective soliloquies which desperately try (and usually fail) to depict the workings of the uber-agent's mind. Otherwise, Mann's direction is rock solid. Dante Spinotti's use of light and color are spot-on (even if a little too reminiscent of ""Miami Vice""). But the score is intrusive, over-used and sounds suspiciously like early-70s Brian Eno. The rock tracks are more successful, especially as used in the climax. This was a good film in its day, and was widely regarded as one of the most terrifying films ever made, but it's even more interesting now as a comparison to the big-budget 2002 remake, ""Red Dragon"".

Grim and gripping, it features William Peterson in the role of taciturn, retired FBI agent, Will Graham, who is called back to service in order to track down a bizarre serial killer. It appears that Graham has the uncanny ability to get into a killer's mind set and figure out what his next move might be. It is as if he and the killer become one. In his preparation for this, Graham even consults the imprisoned Hannibal Lecter (yes, THE Hannibal Lecter), deliciously played by Brian Cox.
The movie is compelling and, at all times, gripping. Joan Allen affectingly plays a blind woman who unknowingly involves herself with the creepy serial killer, chillingly played by Tom Noonan. It is her involvement with him that helps bring the film to its stunning conclusion. Good performances by Dennis Farina, Stephen Lang, and Kim Greist round out this fine, ensemble cast.
This film is a taut, unnerving psychological thriller that is deftly directed by Michael Mann and accompanied by a terrific, musical score used to great effect. Who ever would have thought that Iron Butterfly's heavy metal ""In A Gadda Da Vita"" could be used to such chilling effect in the final, climactic scene?

748700,3,6303954103,"The main thing that bugs me about this movie might seem strange. On the cover of the DVD, it says in big bold letters a section from a review: ""SUPERIOR TO THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS!"" This seems like an act of betrayal on the behalf of the video distribution company. Where would this long-forgotten adaptation of RED DRAGON be without the far superior Clarice Starling vs. Buffalo Bill outing? Its claim to fame is that it came *SURPRISE* before the infinitely superior THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and far superior HANNIBAL.
I was, however surprised at Brian Cox's portrayal of Dr. Hannibal Lecter (or Leckter as spelled in this film for reasons unknown-- the books spell it Lecter). He is rather convincing and has kind of an ubercool presence around him. Not to say that he's better than Anthony Hopkins, but he is still very good.
Another thing is the fact that it was made in the 80's, so the film is plagued with unbelievably inappropriate songs played at annoyingly loud volumes. ""HEARTBEAT"" anyone?
But enough with the bad. This otherwise, apart from the more movie-appropriate finale, is a very faithful adaptation of Thomas Harris' RED DRAGON. They cut out all the psychological explanations for the killer's ways, but I think it's a more neatly packaged film without them.
No problem with the acting. You dislike who you're supposed to dislike and you root for who you're supposed to root for. However, so much is cut out from the novel (especially at the infamous ""wheelchair"" part) that it's kind of hard to understand what's going on at times without having read the book.

However, that didn't require taking away from, what I believe, was a key element in the plot.
The book went into far greater depth about the Red Dragon (Francis) character, and while it wasn't necessary for the movie to go into his whole childhood, it might have been worth pursuing his character a bit more.  Instead, the movie focused exclusively on the pursuit.
The movie could have set up a huge suspenseful ride in the end if they had stuck to the original book ending, with Francis surviving and coming after Will in his home.  The movie violated the Chekovian rule that if you introduce something in the beginning of the story you should resolve it at the end.  Why have Lecter give out Will's home address to Francis if he wasn't going to use it?

William Petersen (The Skulls) plays Will Graham, a former FBI manhunter and former victim of Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter (Spelled LECKTOR in this film for some reason). Graham retired from the FBI after his encounter with Lecter. He also captured Lecter which is made apparent in the film. Grahams life is somewhat back on track. He now lives on the beach in Florida with his Wife and Son. He's happy now, having been driven to the brink of insanity from his work on the Lecter case. That all comes to an end when a friend from the FBI pays him a visit with news of a serial killer who kills on the eve of ever full moon. Graham tries to resist but ultimately succumbs when he is shown pictures of the families that have been killed in their sleep by this maniac. Graham then heads to Atlanta and begins work on profiling the killer, nicknamed The Tooth Fairy. What happens from here is one of the most entertaining, and interesting, detective dramas ever.
This film features some of the most beautiful photography of Florida to have ever been caught on film, I believe. Also a pumping soundtrack, chock full of 80's nostalgia, perpetuates the constant unease of the film.
This film was also directed by Michael Mann.
As for the DVD,
This dvd has neat menu screens and very well written cast and crew bios. It also has two very interesting/entertaining featurettes.
All in all this film comprises a detective film very nicely. Just don't go into watching it expecting it to be anything like The Silence of the Lambs or Hannibal.

The movie was adapted from the novel ""Red Dragon,"" by best-selling author Thomas Harris, and is the prequel to ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Hannibal.""  Michael Mann directed this movie and is well-known for his direction in more recent movies, ""HEAT,"" ""The Insider"" and ""Ali."" Right from the very beginning of the film, Mann's style of film work immediately caught my attention and drew me in. His work is best described as having ""complex camera movements, meticulous compositions and slick, shadowy imagery."" I noticed the intentional use of blue and green colors specifically being repeated throughout the movie as well. Close up shots were used quite often, to pull the viewer into the intense moments on screen. An example of this was when Will Graham ran out of the building after speaking with Hannibal Lector, and the second that he was outside and hit the open air, the camera zoomed in as he bent over to catch his breath. One of my favorite camera shots in the movie was of Graham climbing up a rope hanging from a tree, and the camera shot him from above looking down. Then there was also a great close up and lighting of the scene where the blind woman is walked to her door by a male co-worker, who then brushes something off of her cheek as the killer is watching from his van. I'd have to say that after seeing this movie, Michael Mann is now one of my favorite directors. Here's a great description of this film and the filmwork...
""Manhunter is a cool, dispassionate descent into madness - into a world of unsettlingly bright chemical colors (the azure ocean backdrop to Graham's and his wife's lovemaking) and spatially bizarre mise-en-scenes (the murderer's lair with its arty props and malfunctioning TV). Given its sci-fi veneer and Graham's scary decision to empathize with his quarry in order to catch him, it's a movie that edges into hyperspace - and as such it now looks like a small visionary masterpiece.""
I also loved the soundtrack for this movie too, but I'll likely never find this as it's OOP (out of print). :(
A little extra tid bit: The actor William Petersen who played ""Will Graham"" in this movie, also plays a very similar character, a crime scene investigation expert named ""Gil Grissom,"" in William L. Petersen's hit crime drama TV series ""CSI.""
Another little bit of information: Italian Cinematographer Dante Spinotti worked closely with Mann on Manhunter as ""Director of Photography,"" and is also a crew member on Brett Ratner's high-profile ""remake"" of Manhunter - ""Red Dragon (2002)"" -- Keep an eye out for this new movie release in just a few months, early October!

The acting is superb.  Tom Noonan plays the serial killer in his unusual style.  Scottish actor Brian Cox plays Hannibal Lector.  Is Brian Cox's Lector better than Hopkins?  Cox's Lector portrayal is a lot less flamboyant, and almost seems casual than Hopkins's and as a result is more convincing.  Personally I prefer Cox's performance.
William L Peterson plays Will Graham and is absolutely fantastic.  Will Graham is the Manhunter of the title.  Graham is able emulate the killers dark thoughts in his own imagination but doesn't know how to cope with them.

Red Dragon is a far superior story, which is also why (IMO) Manhunter is a much better film. Having read the book I was surprised at how closely the film followed the story, apart from the ending. The only major thing missing is the killer's childhood memories, but it's understandable as this would have made the film overly long, and I think would have been quite hard to incorporate without slowing down the pace of the film. It is a shame though because you really understand why Dollarhyde becomes the way he is.
The film is very stylish and uses colour and music to good effect, but if you really hate Miami Vice then you probably won't be overly keen on these aspects.
The main DVD is excellent. An outstanding transfer that looks extreamly sharp and detailed - an absolute joy to watch. Unfortunately the Director's Cut transfer, which is on a seperate disc, is so poor you'd think you were watching a bad VHS copy. I don't understand why they even bothered with the DC version if they weren't going to produce a decent transfer. The only reason then to buy the Limited Edition over the regular DVD (which appears to be identical apart from the lack of a DC version) is the excellent miniture 'case file' that is included. There are (fake) hand written notes on it and it includes some very nice pictures and documentation.

Of course, Graham was several years older than Clarice, he had a lot more experience, and he possessed no career ambitions.

748771,4,6303954103,"MANHUNTER (1986) was the film that really put Michael Mann (then of TV's mega-successful Miami Vice) on the cinematic map. Initially overlooked by most people upon release, it went on to cult video status before being cast into the spotlight due to the critical and commercial success of THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS (1991). In 1986, the films that were most popular were smart teen comedies like PRETTY IN PINK, intelligent adult comedies such as DOWN AND OUT IN BEVERLY HILLS and RUTHLESS PEOPLE, and brain-dead action fare a` la PREDATOR; therefore, a story-centered thriller that depended mainly on character development and gradual buildup of suspense just couldn't hope to find an audience at the time.  Fortunately, MANHUNTER has survived to become one of video's greatest success stories of all time.
The film has a lyrical quality to it; it begins and ends in the same place, on the beach.  The first shot is taken at sunrise; the last shot is at sunset. The music is atmospheric, beautiful, and in its own subtle way, does more to help in the creation of suspense than the usual deafening action-film soundtracks.  Michael Mann's direction focuses more on people's faces to tell the story, rather than action and cheap shocks. There are a couple of *necessary* bloody scenes (after all, the plot concerns an FBI agent on the trail of a serial killer), but these are used to inform the brutality being depicted in the film, and do not exist for the sake of sensationalism.  The ending is very well-done; I particularly like the way Michael Mann incorporates the long version of the Iron Butterfly '60's classic ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"" to build the suspense of this unforgettable climax. My only complaint is that they end the song slightly before it actually ends, therefore depriving us of the thrill of the final ""da-da-dada-da-da-DA!"" Maybe they can fix this for another DVD release. :)
Unfortunately, this particular DVD version has extremely muffled sound; you need to turn your TV volume way up just to hear the dialogue in certain scenes.  However, I suspect that the Director's Cut DVD probably improves upon this, although I have not yet seen this version.
However, I found MANHUNTER to be much more satisfying than THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, which for all of its technical filmmaking brilliance left me feeling rather cold.  Look at the way William F. Petersen (as FBI agent William Graham) arrives at the initial crime scene, calmly and professionally taking out his mini-tape recorder to dictate his description of the horrific details. As he describes the horror, you begin to see the emotion in his eyes and hear it in his voice, both of which gradually intensify. After Petersen finishes his dictation and puts the recorder away, he then lets loose with a verbal barrage aimed squarely at the killer as if he were in that very room with him. This is an example of the brilliant acting and directing in this film.
All in all, this is a very well-written, well-acted, and and well-paced film that definitely deserves the credit it has finally gotten over the past ten years. Michael Mann has gone on to direct Oscar-nominated films such as THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS, HEAT, THE INSIDER, and ALI.

It eschews the violence of the sequels in favour of creating mood (something Michael Mann excels in), and while the serial killer in this film isn't as compelling as he could be, it's still very effective.
Brian Cox does a great job portraying Lecter, and I for one would love to have seen him in subsequent film versions of Harris' books.  It may never happen, but this version is still here for all of us to enjoy.",1006041600,,868,4.515923566878981
748868,2,6303954103,"To be fair, you shouldn't compare a film to its sequel, or even compare it to the book on which its based. But in the case of Manhunter, it's really, really hard not to.
Even if you don't, Manhunter just doesn't cut it: Much of the acting, particlarly from the supporting actors, is wooden; the script hackneyed (Peterson soto voce growls ""Goddammit!"" into the camera more than once too often); the sets (while trying desperately to be 80's haute fashion) are cheap; the soundtrack is dreadful in every respect (the music was lousy in the first place, being modishly (& cheaply) electronic now it sounds dated as well, it is poorly edited and it completely fails to project any sort of mood onto proceedings); there's an utterly irrelevant scene with an anaesthetised tiger; the narrative is jumbled and there is no sense of continuity in the picture at all. Having slowly built tension for an hour an a half, with in the space of two screen minutes - one phone call - the cops have gone from having no idea who the villain is to being on a lear jet direct to his home address. Was Mann's budget running out?
Mann overdoes clever camera work and moody lighting and rushes critical plot exposition - many aspects of the story are barely explored or simply left unexplained. The key figure of Francis Dolarhyde is criminally underexplained. At the end of the film, the special effects guys had - quite literally - gone home (Petersen admits as much in the accompanying ""making of"" documentary) so the director had to improvise the splattery denouement. Boy it shows. Also it's odd that, having tried so hard (at the expense of dramatic tension) to keep the violence implicit, Mann allows the film to devolve into a ham-fisted bloodbath in the last five minutes.
And that's not comparing it either to the book or the film versions of Silence of the Lambs or Hannibal. To realise how botched a job Manhunter is, you need look no further.
In this context I can mention Brian Cox's Lektor because, like it or not, were it not for Hopkins, Manhunter's rendition of Hannibal Lektor would be thought of as nothing more than a bit part.
Despite promisingly styling himself after Bela Lugosi, Cox plays Lektor far too much like a distinguished psychiatrist and not enough like a distinguished psychiatrist who eats people for the hell of it. Manhunter accolytes say Hopkins overdid Hannibal, but even leaving aside the fact that in doing so Hopkins made one of the most successful franchises in the history of cinema, that is still nonsense - the character of Lecter as Thomas Harris wrote him is completely cartoonish, based as he is partway between Dracula and Sherlock Holmes.
Harris' novels are all tightly written, beautifully plotted and if anything over-egged with figuative structure. Mann has cut so much out in terms of plot I could barely follow what was going on (despite having read the book recently!), and he eschews Harris' symbolism for his own, which he realises in carefully contrived - but ultimately meaningless - camera angles, camera frames and lighting.
Both Jonathan Demme in Silence of the Lambs and Ridley Scott in Hannibal have drawn out the depth of Harris' writing (in quite different ways), but Michael Mann fails at this task.
The word is they're having another go at making Red Dragon. Second time lucky?",1003536000,10,3326,4.79616724738676
748869,5,6303954103,"Its saddening to read that apparently, Manhunter will be remade (by Brett Ratner of all people!), with Anthony Hopkins as Lecter, so that the film can be a ""better"" fit with Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal (and, of course, so the new film can make the producers a lot more money).  Perhaps most upsetting is the knowledge that this remake will probably lead Michael Mann's 1986 original into greater undeserved obscurity.  The original Manhunter -- adapted from Thomas Harris's book Red Dragon -- deals with FBI profiler Will Graham who comes out of retirement to track down a horrific seriel killer known as the Tooth Fairy.  In the course of his investigation, he seeks the advice of his former adversary -- Dr. Hannibal Lektor.
Lektor is played by Irish actor Brian Cox here and its a performance that, if far more low key than Hopkins, suits this film far better than Hopkins more ""loveable"" version of the evil doctor.  In Manhunter, Dr. Lektor shows up in only a few scenes and he is, make no doubt about it, only a supporting character.  This is not a film about Hannibal Lektor.  Its a character study of a decent man (the profiler, Will Graham) who finds himself being slowly consumed by the horrifying evil that he had previously dedicated his life to battling.  When Lektor appears in this film, its obvious that he is the personification of the darkness that has entered into Graham's soul, almost as if Lektor sprang into existence from Graham's very nightmares.  He is not an erudite, humorous gentlemen with a few antisocial habits.  Lektor is not an antihero.  Instead, he is pure evil and Cox brings out that malicous hatred in ways that Hopkins -- who always projects a certain gentleness in his performances -- never could.  With Hopkins, you mourn what the doctor could have been if not sick.  With Cox, you fear what he'll ultimately do and that is an approach that works perfectly for this film.
The entire film, indeed, is well acted.  William L. Petersen, at first, seems rather stiff as Graham but as the film progresses, it becomes obvious that Graham's stoic facade hides horrors that the viewer can only guess at.  By the end of the film, Petersen's gone from being stoic to being almost dangerously out-of-control and vulnerable and its a turn that Petersen manages to make extremely convincing.  Dennis Farina, as FBI agent Jack Crawford, isn't quite as manipulative as Scott Glenn's Silence version but, with his craggly face and crudely compassionate manner, Farina is actually a far more credible servant of the law.  Joan Allen, playing a blind woman who befriend the Tooth Fairy, brings a heart breaking sweetness and unexpected strength to what, otherwise, could have been a standard victim role.  Lastly, Tom Noonan's Tooth Fairy is a terrifying villian -- I know I speak for many when I say that its been difficult to see Noonan in other films without thinking about his performance here.
The main criticism directed at this film -- and a foolish one it is -- concerns Mann's stylistic direction.  ""Too '80s"" seems to be the common complaint.  Which I suppose means that it would have been a better film if it had been more ""'90s"" with handheld cameras and Graham meeting Lektor in a coffee shop and relating trivia about old television shows.  Or perhaps Mann should have gone ""'60s"" and filled the whole thing with jumpcuts, Viet Nam war footage, and protest songs!  Here's what it comes down to -- Mann keeps the story moving, he creates some very strong and haunting visuals, his use of music is haunting (regardless of whether its the type of music that people listen to now, the fact of the matter is that it all very nicely compliments what we see on screen), and he gets some wonderful performances from a talented, if unsung, cast.  If that's too '80s then take me back to the '80s!  If it seems that he sacrifices reality for style, then I think one would do well to remember that, just by the process of editing together a film, one sacrifices reality.  Silence of the Lambs and (especially) Hannibal, were not extremely realistic either.  All three of these films created their own reality and made no pretenses to being documentaries.
If the film does have any one flaw its that the motives of the killer do remains somewhat obscure, especially if you haven't read the original novel beforehand.  But this really isn't a film about the Tooth Fairy or Dr. Lektor.  Its a character study of Will Graham, with Mann's style perfectly mirroring Graham's increasingly disorted world view.  Manhunter is an excellent film that can proudly stand up to Silence and easily surpasses Hannibal.  And yes, it does all of this even though it was made -- gasp!!!!! -- in the 1980s.",1003017600,18,4719,4.762899262899263
748870,5,6303954103,"Having seen only three Michael Mann works before, I was pleasantly surprised when my ignorance was shed and I learned about this movie.  It is very much like Heat, The Insider, and Miami Vice.  The movie doesn't bore you with gratuitous murder scenes or delve into the killer's methods.  Rather, it lets you know more about the killer himself.  Some of this is conveyed by the scenes with the killer, but I think you learn just as much about the mind of Dollarhyde from Peterson.
What happened to the note from the Tooth Fairy to Lecktor regarding Peterson's family?  I am probably forgetting something there...The cinematography and screenplay in this movie are excellent.  As usual, Mann throws in a brief yet explosive dialogue between two of the main characters.  The frustrated and pure exchange between Farina and Peterson late in the movie is compelling.  The scene when Peterson is used as bait for the killer is astounding.  Too tense.  Must be seen.  I could have used a more meaningful ending sequence, but in light of the film-making constraints discussed in the interviews on the dvd, it is good.

748872,4,6303954103,"I was going to try and talk about ""Manhunter"" without mentioning ""Silence of the Lambs"", but as someone once said, if you try not to think about elephants, all you can really think about are elephants.  And really, would I ever come near this movie if I didn't have a ""Silence"" fetish?  Probably not.
The main difference between ""Silence"" and ""Manhunter"", from what I saw, is that in the former the chief investigator, who's also the chief victim in a way, was a woman.  There isn't the same sense of menace here, for we believe that protagonist Will Graham is more than capable of going mano a mano with the horror he is searching for.  Clarice Starling, for all her put-on gruff exterior, never gave us such confidence.  Which made her triumph that much more surprising.  And rather than being a psychological horror movie, ""Manhunter"" is a quaint little police procedural.  It focuses more on the work of the cops (a lot of which is done against the clock) rather than the mind of the serial killer.
Director Michael Mann, who in 1986 was best known as the brawn behind ""Miami Vice"", has created another piece of work that is definitively of the 1980s.  Skinny ties, pastel coloured clothes, constant 5 o'clock shadows on the men, and bad perms for the ladies all make cameo appearances here.  It never steps into the realm of the comical, as many '80s movies now do, but can be somewhat distracting.  Also distracting is Mann's stylish use of his camera.  He has a tendency to frame his subject off-centre in the frame.  There is one telling moment where Will calls his wife, and their incongruous framing in the scene tells the audience that these two really aren't on the same page.  But there's one shot where Will tells his wife that he loves her, and they appear in their respective frames in exactly the same shot.  I liked this technique in this scene, but in other moments it became quite annoying: one scene is filmed entirely from behind a television set, which consistently gets in the way of the action.
The image of the ""Red Dragon"", the William Blake painting which if I remember correctly was so vital in the book, is glossed over here.  Couple that with the fact that they changed the name of the movie from ""Red Dragon"" to ""Manhunter"" (nomenclature at its most compromising), and the image gets totally lost.  Only those who've read the book will fully understand the killer's obsessions.
My final complaint, before I tell you why I actually liked the movie, concerns the music.  The score reminded me at times of ""A Clockwork Orange"": epic, contemplative, and creepy.  Except for that movie synthesizers were an exciting new technology.  Here, they are only a cheap alternative to hiring a full orchestra, an '80s cliche gone bad.  Also, is it just me, or did the composing duo of Michel Rubini and Klaus Schulze (which deserves the blame?) pinch the chord progression from Pink Floyd's ""Comfortably Numb"" at one point (""Hello hello hello... is there anybody out there?"")?  The ineptness of the score is made even clearer during the final sequence when ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"", by contrast, explodes from the speakers after 90 minutes of sucky synth noodling.  It's kind of a cheesy song itself, but by comparison it comes off as an heroic rock classic.
Now for the good stuff.  Michael Mann, despite the flaws above, did a fine job with the look and pacing of the movie.  He really sucks you in to the suspense, and his garish visual style never does get in the way of that, while making the movie such a treat to look at.  His script, for the most part, retains much of the depth of the book (except for that silly Red Dragon omission; I still can't get over that), and it unravels slowly and assuredly, never letting the audience know too much too soon.
William Peterson does a fine job as the stoic, psychologically bruised genius detective.  The complaints regarding the implausibility of his mysterious magical powers are undeserved, though.  I found it to be nothing more than heightened intuition, which a genius serial killer tracker would need.  The film didn't make any more of this characteristic than it had to.
Francis Dollarhyde, a.k.a. The Tooth Fairy, a.k.a. (in his own mind) Red Dragon, compares very favourably with Jame Gumb (say what you will about the man, but Thomas Harris sure came up with some trippy names for his killers).  Both are tall, thin men, very blond and vacant looking, calm in their duties, wrestling with their own sexuality.  Dollarhyde, inexplicably, gets a love interest here (an early, blind Joan Allen), which is terribly creepy, knowing what this man has done and is about to do
I suppose I'm obligated here to compare the two Dr. Lecters.  Okay.  Brian Cox' Dr. Lektor is more like a ""Hannibal""-era Hannibal than a ""Silence""-era Hannibal.  Even though he is just in the beginning of a long prison term, he has a certain joie de vivre about him, even through his obvious anger at being captured.  Cox is charismatic, sharp as a tack, and terribly menacing.  It would have been interesting to go back to 1986 and watch this movie for the first time, without the impediment of Hopkins' Lecter to compare it to.  Would Hannibal the Cannibal have made the same impact in the movie as he does now?  I doubt it.  Not to take anything away from Cox' fine, but all too brief, performance.
As I've said in this space before, I'm a sucker for serial killer movies.  A good one will keep me engrossed from start to finish, and I'm glad to report that ""Manhunter"", despite its flaws, did just that.  Go in with an open mind, be willing to overlook its datedness, try not to compare it too hard to ""Silence"", and you'll have a good time too.",1002153600,2,5694,4.683417085427136

Also the clothes are very similar to the show, they are both outfitted by Hugo Boss.  Now this movie is not anything like Hannibal, which is absolutely horrible or Silence of the Lambs which won Best Picture.  Take the 7 minutes that Lecter is actually in the film out and no one would realize that this film had anything to od with the other two.  Michael Mann created his own version of Red Dragon through his own 80's pop culture/Miami Vice look.  You are given a look into the mind of an FBI officer who becomes the killer to catch the killer.

It is a nice low-key answer to the brilliant madman in the nicely played main scene between them.  And, this Dr. Lektor is THE Dr. Lecter of Silence of the Lambs & Hannibal.  This Dr. Lektor had nearly eviscerated Will Graham for his troubles, so Will is understandably a little uncomfortable throughout their conversation, even though they keep it civilized.  Lektor: ""Did you get my card?""  Graham: ""Yes, thank you.""
Unfortunately, you would have had to read Thomas Harris's ""Red Dragon"" to fully understand some of the subtleties in the movie.  So much information is given in throw-away lines of dialogue that if you aren't aware of what is being discussed you could easily miss it.  That is the only reason I will take 1/2 a star off the movie...you need the background of the book to fully appreciate it.
Other than that, I think the movie is terrific.  Although Silence is in some ways a more complete movie, I find Manhunter just as watchable.  Each is trying to accomplish different things, and each does so effectively.
Manhunter is more a police procedural with a physically and emotionally scarred, but gifted, profiler/detective at its center.  Lektor/Lecter is a minor, albeit vital, character.  Manhunter is a about the hunt for the ""Tooth Fairy"", and it plays out as a mystery being painstakingly unraveled.
The supporting cast is excellent with Tom Noonan a standout as Francis Dollarhyde, the serial killer, conveying the monster's torment while not losing sight of his loathsome evil.  Brian Cox brings intelligence and a cool malevolence to Lektor/Lecter, a really nasty fellow under his placid facade.  Dennis Farina is fine as Jack Crawford & Karen Allen as the blind woman who touches the human being, however briefly, within the twisted Dollarhyde.
I like the way Manhunter shows its horrors, for the most part, obliquely.  Graham alone in the old blood stained crime scene, recreating/imagining the events,  briefly glimpsed photos etc. The terror of the newsman trussed up & at Dollarhyde's ""mercy"" conveys it all.  Silence of the Lambs was more a horror story (complete with dungeons etc.).  Manhunter is a cop's story, and a good one.

Grim and gripping, it features William Peterson in the role of taciturn, retired FBI agent, Will Graham, who is called back to service in order to track down a bizarre serial killer. It appears that Graham has the uncanny ability to get into a killer's mind set and figure out what his next move might be. It is as if he and the killer become one. In his preparation for this, Graham even consults the imprisoned Hannibal Lecter (yes, THE Hannibal Lecter), deliciously played by Brian Cox.
The movie is compelling and, at all times, gripping. Joan Allen affectingly plays a blind woman who unknowingly involves herself with the creepy serial killer who is chillingly played by Tom Noonan. It is her involvement with him that helps bring the film to its stunning conclusion. Good performances by Dennis Farina, Stephen Lang, and Kim Greist round out this fine, ensemble cast.
This film is a taut, unnerving psychological thriller that is deftly directed by Michael Mann and accompanied by a terrific, musical score used to great effect.

749087,3,6303954103,"In a way, I kind of feel for William L. Petersen. According to the IMDB, he's had about 30 roles. He's currently starring in and producing the very special CBS crime drama C.S.I He's done Shakespeare and other stage theater. Yet, someday he's gonna die, and his obituary is going to read ""Petersen starred in Manhunter, a prequel to Silence of the Lambs the film that earned Jodie Foster an Oscar.""
I had to think about this one for a long time, and I have come to the conclusion that its not a bad film. I'm always the first person to say that you have to try to look at a movie in regards to itself, not its peers. But on the other hand, I'm human and I have likes and dislikes, and I can say without a doubt that I liked Silence of the Lambs better.
But it doesn't stop there, Petersen is also likely to spend the rest of his career being compared to his other ""little sister"" Julianne Moore. To put things in perspective, I'll say that I did like Manhunter better than Hannibal.
This appears to be Petersen's ""method acting"" phase. Perhaps he is trying to relate to his character, William Graham, the FBI profiler who caught Hannibal Lecter (here spelled Lecktor) by using method acting. Graham has the ability to get so into character, to feel the killer's emotions so well, that he knows how he thinks and can behave as the killer would. Sadly, Petersen just doesn't quite have that skill (or didn't in 1986, anyway). He frequently comes across as weak and overemotional, when I think we are supposed to read him as troubled and intense. There is a difference.
I've dwelled on Petersen enough, its time to examine the rest of the film. Manhunter was written and directed by Michael Mann (much like every other crime drama ever :-) ) of whom I consider myself a fan. Sadly, I don't believe the rest of the crew was quite up to the task of realizing Mann's vision. There are several poor edits in the film, sub-par special effects for 1986, and a few continuity errors in shots that easily could have been avoided.
Or maybe Mann just couldn't quite realize the vision himself. Manhunter was released at roughly the half way point between Starsky and Hutch and Heat both of which Mann also penned. I believe that Mann's career may have had a perfect linear progression between those points. Heat is a brilliant and original work with drama, character and stunning action scenes. Starsky and Hutch is a dated cookie-cutter car chase cop show. Manhunter has aspects of both. At times, Mann will give us brilliant cinematography of establishing shots of a forest juxtaposed with a characters frantic facial expressions, or hand us a well thought out character profile that draws us into the film. Other times, he will instead give us sixty seconds of drab dialogue while we stare at half of Joan Allen's butt, or totally break character of the main villain in order to add a romantic sub-plot to the film.
One thing I wanted from this movie was suspense. This is probably the biggest disappointment. I found the character profiles of the hero (Graham), the villain (Tooth Fairy) and Dr. Lecktor all very engaging. I enjoyed following Graham around and watching him discover the case through profiling. What I missed was the suspense aspect of the film. A good suspense thriller gives me enough information to try and figure things out for myself even as the characters do. I enjoy having my mind race to beat the hero to the solution and then seeing how close I came. In Manhunter this isn't possible. Mann doesn't allow us clues. We only discover them by through Graham who always immediately tells us what they mean. There is no wonder about what a plot element means because elements are only introduced at the precise moment that the story needs them. The film is still enjoyable, but the suspense is pulled from it, which immediately detracts from what good have given it a great deal more appeal.
Still, I do recommend the film. Particularly if you are fans of the genre, Mann, or the other two films. It gives an interesting alternate insight into a world that most us have come to know intimately through the other films. However, I will usher a warning. Try not to think about that during the movie. This film has no real relation to the other films save a single character in common and basis in the same series of novels. Look onto it as its own entity or risk ruining it for yourself.",989798400,,4396,4.587039390088945

Mann gives us William Petersen, a little younger and thinner, but much the same as his current role in the television feature ""CSI"".  He has nearly destroyed himself and his family life with his ability to profile serial killers, and his inability to stay out of harm's way.  The villain of this setting (and the book, ""Red Dragon"" by Thomas Harris) is called the ""Tooth Fairy"" and his slaughter of two families is particularly grisly; how and why he chose his victims will surprise you.  Mann's use of rock classics for the score, and his choice of actors for the parts of both villians are brilliant.  Although I prefer Anthony Hopkins, the Lecter role is played with brilliant understatement by Cox, an actor who can ""ooze"" madness and evil, and does so in this film.  Like many of the reviewers, I found only the original widescreen DVD, and not the 2 part Director's cut to demonstrate the excellence in this film.

This film has great character development and the element of pure mind terror. All the actors give great performances, and the movie is great. I suggest you see Michael Mann's MANHUNTER today.
  Will Graham (William Petersen) is the FBI's semi-retired 'Manhunter' who is called back into service by his former superior, Jack Crawford (Dennis Farina). His job is to track down the serial killer called 'The Tooth Fairy' (because of the odd shape of his teeth)who stalked and killed two innocent families. To catch this sick individual (played hypnotically by Tom Noonan) Graham must do two things that test his sanity. He must visit the reason he tired, and think like the killer.
  Dr. Hannibal Lecter is merely a secondary character in MANHUNTER. However, his brief appearances are terrifying. I'm sad to say that having seen THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, I cannot rightly see the talented Brian Cox as our favorite cannibal. He is however a fine actor, and a key addition to this film.
  This film uses many things to make it great. It uses ""mind terror"", some scary images, and acid rock. Mann uses acid rock throughout the film and particularly at the stunning climax to fuel the film. The few flaws I saw were that of Dr. Lecter's character, (although to be fair, this is due to my bias on Anthony Hopkins being the better Hannibal)and at some points, the plot falters. Other than that, this is a top of the line thriller. If you enjoy great movies, you must own MANHUNTER.",987552000,,1613,4.742857142857143
749125,2,6303954103,"This movie comes from the book ""Red Dragon"", an excellent read.  However, this is not a good translation of the book.  The character central to the book, Francis Dollarhyde, is not explained at all in the movie.  You get no real motivation as to why he is the way he is.  You don't get the connection to the painting ""The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed with the Sun"".  You don't learn about the abuses of his grandmother.  You don't get the explanation behind the teeth that he uses to bite his victims with.  These were all very central to the character's development.  Without them, he was just a creepy guy.  (You get more evil characters out of Batman cartoons.)
Instead, the movie focuses more on Will Graham and his journey.  He is not that interesting of a person, either.  At least, not enough to dedicate a whole movie to.
I am a fan of Brian Cox, but he did not ooze the quiet evil that Sir Anthony Hopkins did in ""The Silence of the Lambs"".  So as a whole, the characters were not engaging.
And then there is the ending; the big shock at the end of the book was wasted.  The movie had the typical stylized Hollywood ending that made me cringe.  Not to mention the director's need to linger on a closing shot of the happy-family-in-paradise a good fifteen seconds too long.  Michael Mann may have redeemed himself on later movies, but with Manhunter, you got the Miami Vice, 80's quasi-style of directing.

Although presented in a 2.35:1 widescreen display, the picture doesn't display as much detail as the theatrical. So it can only be assumed that it isn't really widescreen, just made to look widescreen. The transfer is one of the worst transfers I have ever seen. The director's cut is far superior to the theatrical cut but its displayed with seriously shocking picture and sound.

The film is superbly directed by Michael Mann, who also made ""Heat"" and ""The Insider"" and like in those movies, he shows here an exquisite eye for visual composition. The photography is rich and makes use of colors and shadows. Mann's screenplay, based on the novel by Thomas Harris, is complex and is full of believable characters. But what should be most admired about the movie is how Mann, combining superb performances with rich photography and edgy music, creates an intense atmosphere that stays during most of the movie. He has a true understanding here of what is really creepy. The acting is also very well done. William Petersen makes us feel the tension in his character, Tom Noonan presents one of the creepiest psychos ever devised for a motion picture. Brian Cox is also interesting as Hannibal Lecter, he doesn't surpass the Anthony Hopkins version, but he's still good at it. And remember that it is probable that Hopkins took edges from this role because ""Manhunter"" was made in 1985, way before ""The Silence Of The Lambs"" was released. The only thing lacking is more energy, Mann needed to add a more visceral edge to his movie and then it would have been a masterpiece.

My very first encounter with any content of this film was in a video production class, in college. Where our teacher examined the end sequence with us.  Basically he used it as an example for ""bad"" editing.  That had kind of put me off about viewing the movie, but that was some time ago, and I figured what the heck. I still do agree, with what our teacher said about the editing of the last sequence, but according to the dvd supplement, they didn't have much time while filming (like a day or something). So that doesn't bother me much. Mann always turns up some pecurlar editing in all his movies.
I've read allot of the reviews and there are allot of debates between Cox and Hopkins portrayles of Lector.  I know I can't tell you who was better.  It's hard to believe that anyone can.
Overall, I thought the movie was extremely well done. The DVD version of the original cut is realy clean.  But the Director's cut seems to be cropped a bit, or zoomed a bit (still has the 2.35 aspect), and really low on the compression end of things.

After seeing Red Dragon I must say that Manhunter is the better film. I like Norton, but in RD he looks like a child. Hopkins is always good and played Lector brilliantly. Francis dollarhyde was much more convincing when played by Tom Noonan. My two cents...

You'd like to rate this movie five plus stars, because it is indeed a masterpiece (Don't listen to those whiney saps who want to compare it to Silence of the Lambs.  Manhunter was a crime drama.  SOTL was a horror movie.  While I don't favor Hopkins cartoonish portrayal of Lechter, I'll admit it was entertaining.  I prefer Cox's cerebral portrayal which resembled the book. But let's stop this bashing back and forth, it's tiresome.), on the other hand, Anchor Bay butchered it so much, it doesn't deserve the high ranking.  What do you do?  I'd almost like to opt for a seperate rating system here at Amazon.  One for if you like the movie, and a seperate one for what fans of the movie thought of Anchor Bay's ""remastering"".
For those of you who'd be interested, here is Anchor Bay's ""canned"" response to a recent critique:
""Dear Customer:
It has come to our attention that our THX version of Manhunter is missing several seconds of footage which can be found by viewing other sources.
Please be aware that the interpositive of the film was used to make our disc, not a print, of which there are many with varying differences.  This was and is the best source in the world for the film.  We were aware of several minutes of differences between this version and the director's cut, so we went to Michael Mann for the master containing the only existing and exact version of his preferred cut.
Michael Mann's cut is the version he wanted on home video, and he, as well as Anchor Bay understood the trade-off of content at the expense of state-of-the-art quality.  It was with that in mind that ABE followed the quality path to create the THX disc version.
We have heard positive feedback from most in regard to both of our releases and are sorry if you, our customer, prefer one of the several other versions that are in distribution in other media or territories.
We were (and are) opposed to cannibalizing Manhunter to create a hybrid version of the two, and apologize to anyone who feels we didn't put our best efforts into each version.  I think you know we always appreciate your feedback (good or bad) and strive to do our best for each film.  In this case, the versions released are the best we could do, and for the record, we're hoping you, our customer, enjoy our efforts.""
Yes it is a very lame response and I took my shot back at anchor Bay telling them that in fact what they did do was indeed ""Cannabilize"" this film (interesting choice of words.).  they never responded back.
What did I really expect though.  Again in summation:  Five stars for the movie.  0 stars for Anchor Bay's effort/laziness.",984441600,9,2640,4.582978723404255
749134,2,6303954103,"I read the five and four star reviews on this movie (even though I knew I had to see it anyway) and they got me quite pumped up to see it. It's better than ""Silence of the Lambs"" some said. Ha! This is nothing but a chessy, poorly acted and ridiculous 80's film. It's lack of resemblance to the magnificent novel ""Red Dragon"" by Thomas Harris is astounding. The only reason anyone should see this is to see the differant (and not that bad) portrayl of Hannibal ""Lecktor"".
I have read all three of the books by Thomas Harris about the good doctor and the events that surround him. All three are some of the greatest popular fiction novels ever. My personal favourite of the three is ""Red Dragon"". When they turned ""Silence of the Lambs"" into a movie they made a powerful, stylistic and true-to-the-novel film. But apparantly when they made ""Red Dragon"" into a movie they had to change the ending into a predictable one, hardly even attempt to get inside of the killer and get rid of almost anything that actually has to do with the red dragon aspect of the story. Instead the screenplay is conventional, boring and predictable. I sat in disbelieve as the end credits came up and couldn't help saying to myself ""That's it? What's all the fuss about?"".
But just to compliment the terrible screenplay and cardboard acting they had to through in one of the worst movie soundtracks ever. The terrible eighties electronic music fills the speakers at any chance it gets much to my dissapointment. The only bit of music that works in the whole film is Ina gada divita at the end and that was still a bit cheesy. Oh and the worst was that song that was at the end of the movie when Graham and his family are all standing happy on the beach.
Brian Cox was interesting as Hannibal. He played it differantly than Hopkin's and because of that it is not fair to say who was better or worse at it. You only see Lector for like ten minutes in this film anyway so it is hard to tell.
So if you like cheesy action movies and have never read ""Red Dragon"" maybe this film will be for you but for others the only reason you should watch it is to see Cox's version of the Lector character becuase the rest of it is just Mann screwing up a hell of a good book.

I decided to try the directors cut first, to see those enigmatic cut scenes - now while I found those scenes interesting, the picture quality was absolutely abysmal! Surely Anchor bay could have taken the time to have this print re-mastered as well. On the whole, the quality on the Directors Cut is barely watchable for those accustomed to the delights of dvd - with a film as reliant on use of colour as Manhunter, this is painful to watch. To make matters worse, the scene where Graham is sympathising with the Tooth Fairy (you know, he says something like ""my heart bleeds for him as a child"") is AWOL in the Directors Cut - some directors cut, first ive ever heard of that leaves integral dialogue out.

The plot is basically the same as Silence, although Cox doesn't have nearly as much screen time as Hopkins.
Wil tells his son that Lector killed women ""in bad ways."" As opposed to good ways? Since it was directed by Miami Vice's Michael Mann, Dennis Farina plays Jack Crawford, with his midwestern accent intact. The role was taken over by Scott Glen in 'Silence.'  The first forty-minutes are perfect; gruesome crime scenes,  a strong plot, a wheelchair-bound body engulfed in flames. Unfortunately, I think the movie sags in places and eventually runs out of gas. It would be much better without the horrible 80's music. ""In a Gadda da Vida"" you can take or leave.  Another thing that bothers me is that they always have to make psycho killers superhuman. You have to shoot them 27 times for them to fall down. And Graham's semi-descent back to near insanity is unconvincing, almost cheesy.  Despite its flaws, it remains one of the best thrillers around.

The THX master of the (un?) theatrical version is excellent and surpases even the halloween one. with the changing of scenes, this film now has a different tone because Will Graham seems a bit more humane and not so distant. My opinion is that this might have been a european version, im not sure but im still happy with the cut. I think that the restored love scene helps show this as well. As someone else mentioned this film definately has a brain behind it and also the soundtrack is brilliant and rates alongside Heat's soundtrack. Why do so many people say that its got cheesy music, I mean it did come out in the 1980's and that was the type of music that was out. Ever heard the soundtrack for 'To live and die in LA'.  The second disk is very interesting to me. They should have called it the TV version because thats what it is. The quality is not so great but adequate.

It looks like a 4:3 version thats been cropped at the top and bottom.  My overall opinion is that the set is very good and im happy with it. The film is superior to Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal is not even worth mentioning. Its amazing that Ridley Scott to this day still makes dodgy films.

Since it was made by Miami Vice produce Michael Mann, rest assured that the entire movie (including Soundtrack) looks like a Miami Vice episode.  Unfortunately this dates the movie horribly, and may make it unwatchable for some.  Mann's stylistic fetishes just don't belong in this story.
The acting is horrible.  Don't pay attention to the cover that says the story of Hannibal Lecter starts here, it doesn't.  It's the story of his patient that gets mentioned in Silence of the Lambs.  Checkout the Internet Movie Database, there's no Hannibal in this movie at all!
Why does it get 2 stars?  Chris Elliot is in this movie for a handful of seconds.  Otherwise it would get 1 start.  The people who claim this movie is great or fascinating don't know what they're talking about.  I have yet to meet one person who actually likes this movie.

It's distracting. The acting is equally choppy.  William Peterson never managed to convey to me that thinking like a killer was draining. Oh sure, he dramatically pounds tables and broods over family photos of the victims, but he never looks like he lost even an hours' sleep during the whole film.

749222,4,6303954103,"""Manhunter"", directed by Michael Mann, who later went on to make ""Heat"" and ""The Insider"", is the film that features the enigmatic psychaitrist-cum-serial murderer, Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lector. The role is played by Brian Cox, who succeeds in being no less charismatic in the role than his successor, Anthony Hopkins, who transferred Hannibal into a pop culture icon. This modestly budgeted installment, (an adaptation of the bestselling novel, ""Red Dragon"", by Thomas Harris) is actually the best of the three big-screen adaptations of Harris's works, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and the recent ""Hannibal"". It is a slick, glossy and understated suspense thriller, whose treatment is contrary to the cartoonish mannerism of the other two, and which succeeds in generating some chillingly tense situations. What recommends it is its realism and its refusal to pander to the baser instincts of the audience, in excising the gory details of the murders. Peterson is convincing as Will Graham, the manhunter/interrogator figure equipped with the psychic ability of tapping into the killer's consciousness and reconstructing his thought patterns. The soft-spoken Tom Noonan manages to portray one of the eeriest onscreen serial madmen, the harelipped Francis Dolarhyde. Expertly-crafted, this is a thinking man's serial killer film, even though the ending is rather overblown, and the chief aspect in which the film deviates from the original.",982627200,3,1440,5.520361990950226

749307,4,6303954103,"This movie by ""Miami Vice"" creator Michael Mann is way ahead of its time, which can now work to its benefit. Its hero, FBI criminal profiler Will Graham, is brought out of retirement to track a serial killer of entire families, cruelly nicknamed the Tooth Fairy by the tabloid press; like the hero of TV's ""Millennium,"" a good ten years later, Graham has an uncanny ability to enter the mindset of his quarry. This gift, or curse, has already led to one nervous breakdown, and now threatens to ruin his marriage and happy home life, even as he returns to a life-threatening pursuit of one killer, aided by another, the imprisoned Hannibal Lecter. Mann's direction of the film is self-assured and relentless, driving ever onward without a pause, and while the violence is horrific, the triumph of good over evil is never seriously in question. William Peterson, who plays Graham here, portrays a similar, but substantially toned-down character on the TV show ""CSI""---Dennis Farina plays his ex-ex-FBI boss. Brian Cox, a British character actor, plays Hannibal Lecter; he is perhaps less attractive than Anthony Hopkins, but this makes his Lecter even more chilling and repulsive---and the fact that he doesn't shamelessly ham up every line reading helps, too! The climax of the movie, as Graham takes the fight right to the killer in a secluded woodland home, is incredibly suspenseful, even though you suspect that Graham will prevail; the use of dim lighting, and a thunderous refrain of Iron Butterfly's ""In-a-Gadda-da-Vida"" makes it one of the more memorable endings in recent film history.

While the subject matter of a serial killer is dark and ominous, he uses bright stylistic lighting to underscore the duality that exists in the mind of a dark psychopath.  His depiction of Lecktor as an everyday guy (in attitude and appearance) is what empowers any psycopath:  The ability to blend in.  Hopkins, by his own admission after Hannibal, believes that is how Lecktor should be depicted, and that is why his portayal in Silence of the Lambs (although powerful) is inconsistant with the author's (Harris) vision of the character.  This story is more suspenseful, the acting more powerful (From Hannibal, to the FBI agent played by William Petersen, the hunted serial killer, and the supporting cast), and the direction much better than Silence if the Lambs could ever have hoped.

749311,1,6303954103,"This film is the Great Satan of Thomas Harris film adaptations. ""Black Sunday"" was made into a very good film with Bruce Dern and Robert Shaw...""The Silence of the Lambs"" (of course)...and ""Hannibal"" (while not exactly top-notch) was good, as well. What this atrocity of a film does, however, is take Harris' greatest novel to date (""Red Dragon"") and mutilate it as Dr. Lecter might mutilate a psychiatric patient. The screenwriters for this film excised nearly every element which made the novel so intensely brilliant and (by some twisted logic) left in parts of the novel which became irrelevant in the film, due to the changes made.

Why does the character of Reba even EXIST in this film? Her role in the novel was of paramount importance in the closing chapters of ""Red Dragon""...in ""Manhunter,"" however, she is all but a throwaway character. My second problem with the film is this...since when is Hannibal Lecter SCOTTISH? That's right, Scottish thespian Brian Cox portrays Lecter with a distinct accent, despite the fact that Harris' works state that Lecter was born in Lithuania in 1938.

A further problem, and certainly the aspect of the film which garners most of my animosity toward it...how can any screenwriter justify reducing Harris' breathtaking finale in ""Red Dragon"" to a trite ""good guy vs. bad guy"" showdown? Some people who actually READ ""The Silence of the Lambs"" may remember the following statement made by Jack Crawford about the condition of Will Graham following his final encounter with Dolarhyde...""Will's face looks like damn Picasso drew him."" I think that should say enough. They left in the TIGER, but left out the ending.

All in all, this film is absolute trash, and the most blatant smearing of a great novel it has ever been my misfortune to witness. Luckily, Ted Tally (screenwriter of the film version of ""The Silence of the Lambs"") is currently working on his own screenplay for the novel. Hopefully, he won't repeat the same mistakes that the ""Manhunter"" screenwriters made, and the new ""Dragon"" film will live up to its source. Bottom line: ""Manhunter"" was a great cosmic mistake and a painful viewing experience for true Harris fans. Read ""Red Dragon"" instead...you'll thank me later. And if you've already read the novel, wait for the new film...don't bother with this cliched Hollywood tripe.",982108800,4,2340,5.010282776349614
749312,4,6303954103,"MANHUNTER was a flop when it was released in the mid-1980s, but has enjoyed a much-deserved renaissance in the past few years with the box office success of HANNIBAL and SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  And now, finally, it has been released on DVD for a second chance with audiences.
The debate rages on as to whether MANHUNTER is the best of the trilogy, and you can read numerous postings below about this.  Personally, I think MANHUNTER is superior because it deals with the detailed investigation of horrific crimes versus the crimes themselves, its villain is much more terrifying because he's portrayed with more humanity, and the tone overall is creepy and serious versus horrific and campy.
If you're seeing MANHUNTER for the first time and are a fan of the other two films, be forewarned that:
1. This is a crime drama, not a horror movie.  And while it is well shot, it is a low budget film with production values just slightly above a TV-movie.  But you will be so engrossed in the story that this won't matter.
2. It is definitely a film of its time period, with 80s fashions and a MIAMI VICE-type booming soundtrack that tends to interfere with otherwise quiet and introspective moments.  But the music, as with most of the other films directed by Michael Mann, is excellent, well chosen and progressive (for the mid-1980s).  Even though the film seems dated to some, if we are to judge movies forever by the time periods they were created in, then we might as well stop going to the cinema.
3. If Hannibal Lector and Anthony Hopkins are one and the same to you, then seeing Brian Cox in the role might be jarring.  He plays Lector (spelled ""Lecktor"" here) with much more subtlety than Hopkins, and may disappoint those who are fans of Hopkins's over-the-top (though enjoyable) portrayal.
You can read plot details in the many postings below - the real question is how good is the DVD?  Since I was forewarned about the bad video transfer on the 2-disc Director's Cut, I bought the 1-disc Theatrical Cut, which has all the extras of the former.  I am very pleased with the transfer I've seen.  There is some graininess at times, but the picture is generally sharp with vivid colors.  Probably the best version I've seen since I saw it in a theater in the 80s - maybe better.  The audio can be muddy in spots, but the soundtrack booms out of the speakers, particularly the excellent Shriekback songs.
There are a couple of scenes on this DVD that I don't remember seeing before - someone can correct me if I'm wrong.  One involves Will Graham touring the empty home of one of the murder victims with a real estate agent, the other is a love scene with his wife in a hotel room.  The former seemed unnecessary, but the latter only heightened the emotional stakes in Will's pursuit of the killer.
There are a couple of short, but very informative, documentaries at the end of this film - one featuring the actors, the other featuring the cinematographer.  It was very interesting seeing Tom Noonan (the villain) interviewed, as I've never seen him in any other context but this film.  There are some great nuggets of information for fans of the movie, as well as a collection of movie posters from around the world.
The glaring omission is any input from Michael Mann himself.  I, for one, am not as enchanted with running audio commentaries on DVDs, as I feel they tend to take away some of the ""magic"" of the film itself.  But it's too bad he didn't contribute to the docs at the end.  There is a sense from the actors' interviews that the crew had had it with Michael Mann toward the end, and began walking off the set, leaving a skeleton crew for the final action sequence.  Perhaps this has something to do with it.
To sum up, the 1-disc MANHUNTER DVD is probably the best version we'll ever get of this classic film.  Picture and audio are excellent, and the film itself - at least to this viewer - has aged well.  The solving of the crime is so complicated that repeat viewings are beneficial and enjoyable.  And the extras are very informative without being long and overwhelming.

749313,4,6303954103,"""Manhunter"", based on the novel ""Red Dragon"" by Thomas Harris provides the introduction of Dr. Hannibal Lecter (spelled Lecktor in this film). He is in prison here as well and serves as a consultant to the FBI agent who nabed him and gives his insights on a serial killer who is killing entire families.
The blurb on this dvd case says that ""fans and critics alike feel that ""Manhunter"" is a far superior film to ""Silence of the Lambs"". I have to disagree with this. ""Manhunter"" is indeed a very good thriller but it does not have the taut pacing or the suspense of ""Silence"". ""Manhunter"" is beautifully photographed with sharp details and brilliant color and the set designs (there is lots of glass everywhere) are well done. The acting is good - Tom Noonan is very creepy as the killer and Joan Allen, who plays a blind girl that befriends him, is memorable. William Petersen, as the FBI agent, is adequate but he has a lot of scenes where he talks aloud to himself and here he sounds unconvincing and awkward. Brian Cox plays Hannibal Lecter. It is strange seeing an actor other than Anthony Hopkins in this role, but Cox is a believable Hannibal.
On the negative side, the soundtrack is horrendous and does not fit the film. The heavy rock vocals used here kill the tone and mood of the film and it is very annoying. They make the film feel like a tv movie.
Overall, this is definately a film to see especially if you enjoy the FBI serial killer profile procedural. Just don't get your hopes up and expect another ""Silence of the Lambs"".",982022400,,1541,4.526881720430108

the 2 featurettes, included on this disc, are also excellent -- in particular the 18 minute retrospective featuring William Petersen, Brian Cox, Tom Noonan and Joan Allen. some great behind-the-scenes anecdotes here -- essential viewing for any fan of this film and of Michael Mann's other work.

In ""Manhunter,"" we are introduced to the forensic area of psychological profiling of a serial killer.  We see the results of what happens when one of these profilers gets too close to the mind of Hannibal Lektor/Lector.  While it might not be as accurate as ""Silence of the Lambs,"" (John Douglass of the FBI's Behavioral Crime Unit was an advisor), it still has all the makings of a great crime film.
Because of the director (Michael Mann), it's got '80's written all over it. From the glitz to the art shots so prevalent in ""Miami Vice."" But sometimes it's great to have a little reminder of what we used to watch twenty years ago!  The soundtrack was interesting, although I thought that it got in the way of some of the dialog.
Brian Cox was great as Hannibal. While he isn't portrayed as the sociopath that we have all grown to love in ""Silence,"" he is, however resourceful and highly intelligent.  In comparing Cox and Hopkin's portrail of Hannibal, I thought that both were actually downplayed.  In either of these films, Hannibal could have been made into an over the top evil villian, but both Mann and Demme looked to have their actors subdue the roles, which I think makes them much more menacing.
My only negative comment regarding this movie (or should we call it the Hannibal Trilogy), is that we never see the capture of Lector. There are a few loose ends that could have been tied up, but otherwise a great movie to own and watch. It's one of those movies that you can pick things up in each time you watch it.

749382,4,6303954103,"This is a very entertaining, disturbing and stylish thriller which preceded SILENCE OF THE LAMBS by a number of years and first introduced Hannibal Lecter to the cinema.  I first heard of MANHUNTER in a video store.  Strolling down the aisle I could hear the movie on the monitor, but couldn't see it.  The soundtrack and dialog alone gave me the willies, and the clerk was talking about how the movie kept her up at night.  I took the movie home and was treated to an exciting, suspenseful, and highly involving tale of the hunt for a ver-r-ry unpleasant serial killer nicknamed the Tooth Fairy.
William Petersen, an engaging and seasoned actor, plays a retired investigator who left the force after getting to close to such a criminal and getting viciously carved up for his trouble. His former boss, played by Dennis Farino, comes to see him one day with a plea for his help in finding a new serial murderer who is butchering whole families in their bedrooms.  Petersen reluctantly takes the case, visits the crime scenes and interviews an institutionalized madman named Hannibal Lecter, both to get the sick mind set back and to ask Hannibal for help with clues (much as the Jodi Foster character does in the later film).  The Petersen character's own post-traumatic stress makes his commitment all the more admirable as he helps the cops make headway toward an understanding of the twisted motives and methods of the new killer.
Enlisting the help of a tabloid journalist who meets his end in an exclusive visit with the deranged killer that I guarantee you'd never want to experience, Petersen finally connects with the killer only to realize that he may be too late to stop the next ugly stage of the rampage.
In an edge-of-your-seat extended climactic sequence that will have you appreciating the long version of ""Inna-gadda-da-vida"" in a whole new way, Petersen and some unfortunate cops finally bear down on the Tooth Fairy even as the serial killer crouches over his next victim like a huge spider.
Michael Mann has been a highly respected director since the 70s, directing James Caan in the star vehicle THIEF and inventing the high-style runaway hit MIAMI VICE on television.  This movie's dark and intimate style complements the story and works just fine, and all the cast is quite good.  Hannibal Lecter is a stand-out as played by Brian Cox, giving us two fine performances of the Lecter character to enjoy.  Cox's Lecter is just as cool and calculating, a mad genius who gets fan mail from the Tooth Fairy and plots to reveal the whereabouts of Petersen's family to him in return.  There is no need to take sides between SILENCE and MANHUNTER.  Thankfully, MANHUNTER is an excellent interpretation in its own right, and a worthy book end and enhancement to the fine job done on SILENCE.  In some ways, the Tooth Fairy is more gruesome and more fully rendered than Buffalo Bill, and Tom Noonan is absolutely creepy throughout, every bit as ghastly a villain as any I can remember, including the weirdo in the first DIRTY HARRY movie.
Never mind the small minority which doesn't get this film, and see it for yourself.  It is a compelling treat of a ride, and we are lucky to have this good a film companion to SILENCE. There would have been no special edition DVD with a director's cut and extended commentary if this were not a film appreciated by many.",981676800,18,3370,4.75
749383,4,6303954103,"I am usually happy just lurking in the background and only offer an opinion when I think that people are missing something special (I've only done one other Amazon review.)
But I have read some reviews of this movie that are way off the mark.  For example, ""What's with all the 80s rock music.""  I, too, couldn't figure out why 80s music would show up in an 80s movie.  I was angry when 70s music showed up in ""Harold and Maude"" (1971).  And, well, when 60s music showed up in ""The Graduate"" (1967), I almost turned the movie off because I was so horrified.  Laugh out loud!
I rewatched the DVD last night to make sure that I was not forgetting some ""Oingo Boingo"" tune, and I was not--there were only a couple of real songs in the movie (one, In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida was released in the 60's) and most of the movie was backgrounded with the suspenseful instrumental music that the reviewer was looking for.  This same type of music shows up in the 90s movie ""Heat"" (also a Mann flick & worth checking out in my opinion.)
And then others are making fun of the script when compared to Silence of the Lambs?  Please.  In Manhunter, Hannibal is in a real prison where he is sealed in a private cell.  The bars are covered with glass and he has to turn his back when the guards place anything through the little opening in his cell.  In Silence, the mass murderers get to hang out in dimly lit cells where they are free to throw items between the bars.  In Silence, Hannibal cuts off a person's face and uses it to escape.  Sure, if I had a nickel every time I saw this happen in real life.....
Is Manhunter perfect?  No. The editing is not the best and some of the wrinkles were not ironed out of the story (I, too, wish the detective had not talked as much to himself when figuring things out.)  But Manhunter overcomes these minor annoyances to deliver an enjoyable and believable thriller about the FBI trying to catch a serial killer.  It does this without exploiting the subject matter so that even the faint of heart can watch.
Next, Manhunter delivers two of the best performances that I have seen in any movie.  Brian Cox does an outstanding job as Hannibal and Tom Noonan is spectacular as ""The Tooth Fairy.""  I came across Tom Noonan in an episode of the X-files and I stopped what I was doing to watch (even though I am not a huge X-files fan) because his role/performance ten years earlier in Manhunter was that good.  This is the highest praise that I can give any actor.
The quality of the DVD transfer is not great, so I'd suggest that you can save yourself a couple of dollars and just buy the video instead.  If you enjoy these mystery/thriller type movies, then you should enjoy Manhunter.",981590400,2,2699,4.416161616161616
749384,4,6303954103,"The book ""Red Dragon"" is a wonderfully written, powerful and suspensful novel.  Harris does a fantastic job of creating these characters and making them come to life.  In Michael Mann's film version ""Manhunter"", some of the great ideas in the book are left out, such as the finale when the Tooth Fairy fakes his own suicide and blows up his house to fool the FBI, and then shows up on Grahams doorstep in florida.  The ending in the book was far superior to the film, however Michael Mann did a great job in directing this movie and using the actors to bring life to Harris' characters.  The investigative procedures where created brilliantly.  The Tooth Fairy was well-acted and so was Graham.  I prefer the portrayals of Jack Crawford and Dr. Chilton in ""Silence of the Lambs, however.  The actor who plays Lecter (Lektor), does a fine job in portraying a younger version of the character that Hopkins would later play in ""Silence.""  His dialogue with Graham is similar to that of the book, and there's more to this scene in the Director's cut edition DVD.  Although there is a better ending in the book, the one here is fine.  Set to music as the FBI tracks Dolarhyde to his home for the final showdown while he holds his lover hostage.  The low budget of the film most likely did not permit the explosive ending of the book. For the DVD, I wish Anchor Bay or Mann would have removed that awful song from the end credits however.  That seems to me to be the only real flaw in the film.",981590400,6,1488,4.470370370370371

749387,1,6303954103,"Well, this one's a dud. Let me start off by expressing my extreme  annoyance in the use of dated, 80s rock music in a thriller movie! Yes, I understand it was made in the 80s, but that doesn't excuse the use of the music! You don't see thrillers today using Britney Spears or Sting. That's because thriller movies are supposed to set a tone and they usually are smart enough to use thriller music, usually instrumental suspenseful music. This had dated, horrible rock music that seriously made me sit and laugh. Not a good sign when you, as the director, are trying to scare or shock people. Michael Mann made quite a few creative mistakes besides the music. I'm sorry, but the detective talking to himself, or rather the killer, all the time got pretty annoying. The script went nowhere and barely touched on the character and background of the killer. I will admit that the brief scene or two with Lecter (Lecktor in this one) were well written and acted. That's it, though. Throughout the rest I found myself yawning and asking when it was going to end or do something worth while. And I of all people give every movie a chance. I wanted to like this one because I LOVE SIlence of the Lambs and I know I will love Hannibal! But I don't view this as an installment in the series, because it's simply not good at all. I can't fathom how anyone can say it's superior to Silence of the Lambs. Name ONE single thing that was superior to Silence of the Lambs. Certainly not the writing, DEFINITELY not the directing, the acting was fine, no complaints there. Although I would have preferred to see Joan Allen put to real use as a detective alongside the men. They needed a female counterpart as a smart detective. The whole thing just felt lopsided and clumsily-done. I haven't read Red Dragon, but I've read Hannibal and some of SOTL, and I am pretty confident in saying that Manhunter was a sloppy interpretation of Thomas Harris' brilliant  work. This movie wasn't horrible, it just wasn't good.",981331200,6,1995,4.569832402234637
749388,1,6303954103,"I got the new limited edition 2 disc set of Manhunter and I have to say I have never been more disapointed with a DVD in my life.  First of all the first disc that is supposed to be the theatrical cut of the film is not. Several important scenes and patches of dialouge have been removed, and unimportant scenes from the directors cut are added in out of context. And to make matters worse the cuts are made very crudely, sometimes cutting people off in midsentence.
Then there is the director's cut on disc 2. Saddly this version was never remastered from the source print so the picture quality of the whole film is that of a deleted scene i.e. worse than VHS. Not to mention that several scenes appear to be taken from brodcast tv as several lines of profanity are crudely dubbed over.
Take my advice if you are a fan of this movie stay away from this poorly produced DVD, as refusing to buy it might be the only way get Anchor Bay to correct this horrible problem.",981072000,213,968,4.318681318681318

I have just viewed the ""Limited Edition"" of the DVD which includes both the theatrical release version and the special Director's Cut, plus two short ""featurettes"" with interviews with Dante Spinatti and the key actors.  The DVD is not perfect -- an optional audio commentator by the director would have been much appreciated and, unfortunately, the ""Director's Cut"" version has not been enhanced to give the same visual clarity as the theatrical version -- but I still rate it 5 stars based upon the film itself.

749410,5,6303954103,"Michael Mann's acutely disquieting cinematic voyage into the psyche of serial murderers, the conscience of the law enforcement officers that pursue and clean up after them, and the oblivion of insanity that mark both sides whether they want to or not remain unwavering themes of magnitude throughout this hauntingly remarkable pioneering thriller by director Michael Mann (Last of the Mohicans, Heat, Insider). Based on the memorable best seller by Thomas Harris (Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal), Manhunter recounts the story of a well known serial killer known only as the ""Tooth Fairy"" who apparently kills entire families in apparently brutal, inhuman, and excessively savage fashions during every lunar cycle. With two families already slaughtered and time desperately running out until the next predicted homicides will probably take place, F.B.I. agent Jack Crawford (Dennis Farina) requests the help of retired F.B.I. agent Will Graham (William L. Petersen) to assist in helping to track down the maniac before he strikes again.
Graham is initially hesitant to participate due his strangely personal relationship with serial homicide. He was previously the chief agent responsible for the apprehension of numerous serial killers including well-renown psychiatrist Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lector (Brian Cox). During the Lector arrest, Lector viciously attacked Graham leaving several immense scarring wounds along with significant psychological damage derived from Graham's attempts to get inside Lector's head. Reluctant to act due to his wishes of his wife and fear of having a relapsing psychotic episode, Graham grudgingly accepts and begins a long and painfully personal descent into the mind of a madman. Only through Graham's gift of thinking like the murderer can he possibly hope to stop him.
However conventional, predictable, or just plain uncreative this plot may sound to you, Manhunter remains an unexpectedly inspired odyssey into the modern human heart of darkness by way of the canvas of the modern morbid American obsession/fascination into serial killing. By seeking to metaphorically define the sometimes subtle mystique of the unsavory subject of serial murder and its effect on society, Mann has concocted a surrealistic nightmare that emits a dense film noir type feeling of depravity and hopelessness as we are lead through a multitude of authentic sights and sounds of the American Dream gone awry through the eyes of the victims turned victimizers. The murderers are represented as misunderstood geniuses that happened to find a most deadly form of self-expression. Life has given them a raw deal, and now it's time for life to receive its bitter medicine back in spades.
One essential basis to Manhunter's continued success and exceedingly fond admiration among fans and critics alike is the icily candid yet childishly impulsive virtuoso performance of Tom Noonan as Francis Dollarhyde (The Tooth Fairy). He exudes a grain of harshly treated humanity gone astray by mistreatment and misunderstanding. He is too far along for spiritual redemption, yet Noonan still permits Dollarhyde's impoverished humanity to seep through to an unforgettably sympathetic performance of man doomed to be a killing machine.
Manhunter invariably set the stage for other more well known psychological thrillers including Jonathon Demme's Silence of the Lambs and David Fincher's Seven. Though it may not be quite as action packed or gruesomely depicted, Manhunter's dramatic intensity and perceptive glimpse into primal humanity will always distinguish this emotional powerhouse from its descendants.
As for the special Anchor Bay Manhunter DVD, it has an excellent Anamorphic Widescreen presentation, two documentaries about the making the film and it's cinematic look, theatrical trailer, special director's cut, and 24-page collector's booklet. This is a Must-Buy for fan of sophisticated horror, Thomas Harris, or Hannibal Lector.

749411,1,6303954103,"Sorry. The movie just didn't do it or me. I read the book first and it was quite good. In fact, a few friends and I joined together last year for what we called, ""The Thomas Harris Reading Project, 2000""...sort of in preparation for the release of ""Hannibal"" this year. In that pursuit, we researched and found VHS issues of the Manhunter movie and we all watched it after we read Red Dragon. We were all very disappointed. The Manhunter movie, did not even make a loose attempt to follow the movie and it was low budget, badly acted, and, as the man in the theater mentioned in one of the other reviews, looked more like a video. What an insult.
Definitely a B-movie. I'm sure it is being trotted out and hyped now since Hannibal is coming out soon, but pls, do not buy this movie expecting anything on the production level of Silence of the Lambs. I also read the book of that last year, as well as watched the Anthony Hopkins movie, and also found THAT book much better than the movie. Having read Hannibal, I don't expect that movie to measure up to the book, either. Let me recommend to true Hannibal Lector fans, the unabridged audiobook of Hannibal. It is beautifully acted, and was thoroughly entertaining.",980640000,5,1214,4.497737556561086
749412,2,6303954103,"Having seen Silence of the lambs years before I got around to watching Manhunter I was disappointed with the original.  Perhaps Manhunter was much better in 1986, (I was 10) but by todays standards it just isn't very good.  The film opens with a lame, cliched cop investigation cast with overused cop actors. Then we get to agent Graham who must come out of retirement because he is the best.  Maybe that story line was fresh in 1986, but is smells tired to me.  I thought it was laughable when Will Graham tried to explain his job to his son in the grocery store.  It was like a bizarre after school special.  Also I felt most all of the tension that the movie managed to generate was broken far to early by showing the killer's face midway through the film.  When we see that he is just a man, he loses all mystery and Manhunter loses its edge.  I think Silence managed to hold its tension even after the killer's face was revealed.  I credit that to the acting... when Jame Gumm mocked and howled at Catherine in the pit it was demonic and animal. Manhunter's killer while adaquate, never manages a scene quite that sinister. Now, having said all that, let say what I did like about the movie.  Brian Cox!  While not as elegant as Anthony Hopkin's aristocratic Lector, he is at least as clever. But again I have to conclude that Silence is superior.  First of all I thought Anthony Hopkins was a little more subtle.  Take Silence's first shot of Lector.  He is standing... very prim and proper, and very aware that Clarice is coming.  With one seconds worth of film Hopkins and Demme suggest that Lector knows more than Clarice and that he is in control. Compare this to a slouching Brian Cox on his cell bed in Manhunter's first scene with Lector.  My second Lector complaint with Manhunter is that while entertaining and well written, Lectors scenes in Manhunter aren't all that crucial to the story.  Where as Jack Crawford hopes to use Clarice to extract information from Lector in Silence about a killer that Lector knows, Graham merely uses Lector to get back in the mind of a killer.  Which strikes me as a flimsy excuse to use this really cool Lector character in the movie but doesnt really drive the story forward.  In conclusion I find Manhunter worth watching simply to see a few more minutes of Hannibal in action, but not the equal of its sequel.  Silence of the Lambs is just one of those rare examples of a sequel that is better than the original.  Hope that trend continues with Hannibal Feb. 9th.",980553600,3,2517,4.512141280353201
749413,3,6303954103,"mainly because the Tooth Fairy is a more compelling figure than Buffalo Bill was.  (Tooth Fairy?  Buffalo Bill?  These are pretty silly names, aren't they?)  This generally well-executed  (pardon the pun, pleaz)  movie is at its best when we start getting to know the killer, excellently portrayed by Tom Noonan.  Even though the press have dubbed him  ""Tooth Fairy""  because of some nasty bite marks on the cadavers, our killer prefers to think of himself as  ""Red Dragon"" -- a suitably macho monicker which perhaps compensates for his painfully shy, socially inadequate, hare-lipped persona.  While he's butchering families, he finds time to actually fall in love with a blind co-worker, and in so doing generating enough sympathy that you may find yourself surprised.  This is a great character; this is good writing.  (Although the writers fail the Tooth Fairy somewhat with the slam-bang slo-mo cliche ending.)
Not so good is the overelaborate set-up with William L. Petersen's Will Graham and the FBI.  Amusingly, the movie couldn't care less whether you're able to follow all the details of the high-tech tools, diagrams, psychoanalytical profiles, et al., that are thrown at you during the first half-hour.  One would think that the FBI is sending Agent Graham to the Moon, rather than putting him on another case.  And the notion of our hero putting himself in the exact frame of mind as our killer passes belief.  Finally:  what's the deal with Petersen's weird little beard?
Well, not quite finally.  A word about the legendary, mythic, pop icon, blah blah HANNIBAL LECTER.  Okay, here's the news.  In  *Manhunter*, he's a minor personage, and shouldn't be worth so much discussion in all these reviews.  This movie stands quite nicely on its own merits without dragging in baggage from later films.

749414,5,6303954103,"Manhunter is based on Thomas Harris' novel Red Dragon.  That is the book that first introduced Hannibal Lecter to the world.  Unlike Silence Of The Lambs, the real star of the movie is not Dr. Lecter, but Will Graham, a retired FBI agent brought back in by the department to hunt a serial killer dubbed the Tooth Fairy.  William Peterson plays Graham with the perfect amount of torment and intensity.  In order to find the killer, who preys on families, Graham must try to inhabit the killer's skin.  Mr. Peterson's performance is quiet and brooding (he does a great job of conveying many emotions through facial expressions) and is the finest of his career. Brian Cox brings the doctor to the screen and though Anthony Hopkins would win an Oscar five years later and create one of the most indelible screen figures from the same character, Mr. Cox does an effective job in the role.  He is a minor character in both the book and movie, but Mr. Cox makes the most of screen time by chillingly bringing a quiet madness to the character.  Michael Mann does a fine job of directing the film.  He was also doing Miami Vice at the time and Manhunter takes on the color and stylings of a Miami Vice episode. The closing scene, set to ""In A Gadda-Da-Vida"", which finds the killer and Graham finally clashing is tense and thrilling.  Manhunter is a first-rate thriller.",980208000,13,1361,4.614107883817427

After reading the book, and several of the glowing recommendations at Amazon, I thought I would be in for a treat, but received a trick!  The film dragged along for just shy of 2 hours, and missed vital elements of the book necessary for a true telling of the story.  The main factors which led to the killer becoming the monster he was were completely omitted.  Instead, we have poor acting, and less than believable location shots, interspersed with ""dreamy"" montages that do nothing to evolve the plot.  Anyone who was ""gripped"" or ""terrified"" by any portrayals in this film must have extremely low thresholds for excitement or suspense.

For whatever reason, the scriptwriters decided to change the script and eradicate several parts essential to the understanding of the story. The reason behind making up their own, somewhat bland and completely different ending to the twist in the book will remain a mystery to me. I may seem a little unfair, as after watching Silence Of The Lambs and reading Red Dragon, Manhunter had a huge reputation to live up to, but it failed dramatically. It's no wonder Dino De Laurentiis wants to make it again. Wait for that version - with the real Hannibal (Hopkins) we all know and love.",978134400,3,751,4.921259842519685

Secondly, the script is flawed, as it often lacks spontaneity and realism.  Third, the film raises a series of interesting ideas that are tragically undeveloped - for instance, Lector's character and the Petersen's psychology - it failed to attempt an answer to some of the film's major issues.  The killer's character didn't work - he seemed far too frail and pathetic to have murdered two sets of children in cold blood - the dualism of tenderness and cold violence doesn't really come off.  The idea that the killer wants to become like God is also underdeveloped.  There is also a fundamental structural flaw - the tension accumulated before we meet the murderer is impressive - sadly, his arrival not only destroys the tension, but also the psychological enigma surrounding his behaviour.  His character is, to be frank, a disappointment and there is a general sense of bathos after his introduction. That said, the film has some serious pluspoints: Dante Spinotti's photography is, as ever, masterful; Mann's direction is subtle and suggestive; Brian Cox is superb as Lecter - the entire scene in the mental hospital is the crowning glory of the film - profound, disturbing and intense.

749477,5,6303954103,"In his novel ""Silence of the Lambs"", author Thomas Harris revisted the character of Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lector, a  super-intelligent, super-sick serial killer locked up in a hospital for the  criminally insane.  Revisted, because Lector first appeared as a supporting  character in a previous novel called ""Red Dragon,"" which is the  source for Michael Mann's film, ""Manhunter.""
Before  ""Heat,"" before ""Last of the Mohicans,"" Mann informed  film fans that he was a huge talent with ""Manhunter.""  This taut,  slick thriller tells the story of Will Graham, a burnt-out retired FBI  agent with a terrible gift.  Graham can empathize with murderers so clearly  that he can start to think like them, and eerily predict their next move.  The problem is, by the time he starts to think like them he has put his  sanity and soul in peril.
If this sounds a little gimmicky, the  combination of Harris' story, Mann's direction, and William Petersen's  performance as Graham keep it real.  Graham is brought back by his former  boss to help the bureau with a pattern killer.  Unlike ""Silence of the  Lambs,"" which pushed the pursuit of Jame Gumb into the background,  ""Manhunter"" is almost entirely about the pursuit of a serial  killer known as the Tooth Fairy.
Mann's direction is nothing like  Jonathon Demme's; despite the presence of a few common characters (Lector,  FBI commander Jack Crawford, psychiatrist Dr. Chilton) the movies are  totally dissimilar in their ""look and feel.""  Yet Mann's film is  terrific.  Visually clearer and more brightly lit, ""Manhunter""  proceeds more as a straight-ahead crime drama than the psychological  thriller of ""Silence of the Lambs.""
Like ""Silence of the  Lambs"", ""Manhunter"" is about two monsters, and as in second  film, Dr. Lector here is the FBI's key to finding a killer still at large.  Brian Cox portrays the bad doctor as more outspoken and confident.  It  isn't Hopkin's portrayal -- it's quite different -- but it's so effective  that, when I learned of the casting of Hopkins, I felt disappointment.  Cox, I thought, was the obvious choice.  (Live and learn).
As good as Cox  is, perhaps the biggest draw of ""Manhunter"" is the hypnotic  performance by Tom Noonan as Francis Dolarhyde.  Noonan is touching, tragic  and terrifiying as the man driven to murder entire families.
Noteworthy  too is a piece of music:  Mann uses Iron Butterly's acid rock classic  ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"" to score the action climax.  If that sounds  like an odd choice, it isn't; it's one of the most exciting sequences on  film.
I recommend ""Manhunter"" highly, both to fans of  ""Silence of the Lambs"", and to anyone who likes a good crime  thriller.",969062400,17,2674,5.020642201834862
749478,4,6303954103,"I first came across Michael Mann's version of Thomas Harris' ""Red Dragon"" in the fall of 1987.  I was mesmerized from the first scene of  the movie as the ""Tooth Fairy"" Francis Dollarhide began his  ascent up Charles and Nancy Leeds staircase and it did not let me loose for  3 years.  I became obsess with finding as much information about this film,  the Author, the music.  There is only one other movie of this genre that  has had the same affect on me and that was the David Fincher masterpiece  ""Seven"".  I realized what they both had in common was that neither film  showed any of the murders.  They forced the viewer, through the forensic  evidence & it's detectives, to reconstruct these horrific crimes in  their own mind...boy does it work!  I spent months with the images of the  Jacobys and the Leeds and how they were killed and same as Will Graham  suffered for a resolution.  I than finally, by accident, came across a copy  of ""Red Dragon"" and read the book cover to cover in three days.  I could  not put it down!  It helped somewhat in filling in the holes left by the  movie.  Than in 1988 the cable movie channel ""ShowTime"" began a series  called ""Director's Cut's"" and one of the first movies was Michael Mann's  ""Mannhunter"".  They opened with a 10-minute conversation with Mann and  ended with a brief discussion.  The movie itself ran 2:07 long and included  8 minutes of added footage removed from the theatrical and video release.  This extra footage included a conversation with a real estate agent, inside  the Jacoby's house.  Another scene was with Ton Noonan and Joan Allen on  the evening of their first date after they visited the tiger.  The most  important scene added was at the end, with the third chosen family and was  a very very powerful scene and displayed the emotions of Will Graham  brilliantly.  As far as a comparison between Manhunter and Silence of the  Lambs I favor Manhunter, but that is not to say that Manhuter didn't suffer  from what sererval Michael Mann project do...Substance.  In his earlier work,  Thief, The Keep, Miami Vice, Mann constructs amazing sights and sounds at a  break-neck pace.  At the end of all of these works the viewer needs to  catch their breath and check their pulse.  It was why the removed ending,  with the third chosen family, would have lent itself to the substance of  the film.  My only copy of this particular version Manhunter is on VHS and  was taped on a 6-hour speed.  My hope is that the DVD version of this film,  release date 10-10-00, includes these scenes and is remastered in 5.1  and/or DTS.  A director commentary track would be nice also.  We'll see  when 10-10-00 comes round.  If these things occur I give this film a 9.5  out of a possible 10 and strongly recommend it to any one who is/was a fan  of these Thomas Harris novels/films.  By the way the third installment  ""Hannibal"", being directed by Riddley Scott, is also a great read, and I  can't wait for the movie!  Mason Verger, referenced in Manhunter as one of  two Lector victims still living,  is being played by Gary Oldman.",968976000,9,3092,4.595194085027726

It was directed by Michael Mann (Heat,The Insider)  and he manages to get closer to the book than the more famous sequel ever  did. By having the character record his thoughts onto tape during the film,  the viewer gets right inside the mind of the FBI agent Will Graham as he  tracks down a serial killer. So good is the script, that even a scene of  FBI agents sitting in a room talking about the case can be more tense and  exciting than most action sequences you will see elsewhere! The acting is  great (check out the first screen appearance of a certain Hannibal Lector  played by Brian Cox), and the ending will have you on the edge of you seat.

749522,4,6303954103,"While comparisons with 'The Silence Of The Lambs' are inevitable, they are both completely different films. 'Silence' is more atmospheric and isn't faithful to Thomas Harris' novel, 'Manhunter' is creepier and more  unnerving. But it is better to view both films for what they are and avoid  any comparisons at all. Michael Mann directs with a forceful grip on the  audience and chose to add a heart-pounding soundtrack that heightens the  atmospheric dread. William L. Peterson is superb as the brooding retired  (?) FBI agent who uses a very successful but also mentally damaging method  for tracking serial killers. The method consists of Peterson actually  'thinking' like the sadistic killer and foreseeing his next move so he can  be captured, the scenes where Peterson is slowly delving into the criminal  mind of the 'Tooth Fairy' are compelling and fascinating. This method, as  complex as it may sound, is actually used by the FBI in real life and also  the method used is 'Silence'. Brian Cox is also great as Hannibal Lecter,  while he is no Anthony Hopkins, he creates an equally compelling character.  While definitely not as scary or as memorable as Hopkins, Cox managed to  create psychological tension between Peterson and him in their few scenes  together. There is also a very interesting scene that tells us how Peterson  tracked down Lector. Tom Noonan is unforgettably creepy as the 'Tooth  Fairy', who gets his name for appropriately sadistic reasons. Joan Allen is  also great in an early role as a blind woman who may become his next  victim, she shows us very early in her career what she is capable of, her  performance is very carefully calculated and extremely efficient. A  forceful and gripping thriller that never lets go. From a scale of 1-10 I  give this film a 7!",964915200,3,1798,4.903654485049834

They did not call it RED DRAGON, because there was another movie that year with DRAGON in the title that did  not do so well...and the studio feared it would get confused with that  film.  It's driected by Michael Mann who is famous for MIAMI VICE, and yes  it shows in this film.  But it's a grueling fast-paced reality-based  thriller similar to SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  Big challenge is they had to  vocalize Will Graham's thoughts in the book into actual lines in the movie.  Sometimes you can tell the film was made on a smallish budget in the  mid-80s, but on the whole?  It holds up today as a great adaptation of a  great book!  It's a fun movie, and if you are a fan of the other thrillers  like SILENCE OF THE LAMBS this will be right up your alley.  Yes, there is  a wonderful appearance by Hannibal the infamous cannibal -- though not much  is made of his modus operandi.  He is never referred to as a cannibal.  But  Brian Cox's portrayal is strong if brief.  The real stars here are the  actors portraying Will Graham and the killer.  Both give creepy a human  edge as they play cat and mouse with each other.  And fans of Joan Allen --  her portrayal of the blind Reba is amazingly well done.  Sexy and stylish,  not too much gore, and very tight pacing.

He was a fasinating Hannibal Lektor (spelled Lektor, not Lector as it is in the  books and Silence of the Lambs) I think Brian Cox played Lector more how he  is potrayed in the book, The Red Dragon. I'm not saying Sr. Anthony Hopkins  didn't do a supurb job playing Lector in Silence of the Lambs...he did,  he's also my favorite actor, but I just pictured Brian Cox when I read all  3 books. The only complaint I have is the ending. I didn't think the ending  was as good as it could have been, I wish it would have ended more like the  book. I also wish that Lektor would have been in it a little more, like the  book, but still I was thrilled to find and watch this movie, I was so  surprised to find that most Silence of the Lambs fans knew nothing of  Manhunter...I love both movies and can't wait to see Hannibal...but I must  put my vote behind Manhunter. If you haven't seen it you don't know what  you're missing!

749526,3,6303954103,"Although I saw this movie when it was released in 86, I never rembered it being the first movie to feature Hannibal Lecter (Lecktor in this film).Now made so memorable in the Silence of the Lambs, I went back to revisit this  movie and found a nice little gem of a film. Always a big Micheal Mann fan,  since Miami Vice, I followed his career through this movie, Theif, Last of  the Mohicans etc... to the undisputed winner of best film of 1999 (well, at  least in my book) The Insider. I like the fact that this movie prtrayed  lecktor in a more believable light. In Lambs, he is almost super-human (  and especially made more unbelievable as he is played by an older actor  like Hopkins). He is shacled, mouth cuffed, and wheeled around whenever  being dealt with. In Manhunter, he is a deranged cannibal who was made  fallible when caught by Peterson. When Lecktor asks Peterson how he caught  him, Peterson replied that he had one weakness; ""he was insane.""  Brilliant! This was also one of Peterson's few good roles, as he seemed to  slip later in his career either into playing secondary characters or  starring in B movies ( like that giant squid picture recently!).Lecktor was  also made more human in his vengenace towards Peterson by aiming the killer  Peterson is now after to his family! The Lecter of Lambs would never be so  overt. What keeps this movie from getting higher marks, hard for me to say  since I love Mann, is the direction. I'm not sure he was quite right for  this film as it was supposed to be ""dark."" Mann was still caught  up in his then trademark day-glo, neon coloring. Compare Lecktors cell to  that of Lecter in Lambs. Manns is bright white and sterile. In Lambs,  Lecter is kept in a dark, dank dungeon where he can barely be seen in the  shadows. There was also Manns signature of inserting blaring rock music  into the musical score. Again, this was the type of film that would have  better benefited from a mix of a rock track and symphony track. It was  ironic that he chose In A Godda Da Vida by Iron ""Butterfly"" for  this movie instead of the second where butterflies, or moths, are such an  intergal part of the movie. Still, Mann was just starting out in features  then, and has now become one of the greatest directors of our time! With a  picture like this, you can understand why & watch his career develop!

749527,2,6303954103,"Manhunter suffers from some of the problems that arise when a novel is adapted to the screen: it's generally too talky, and it attempts to work every scene of the book into the film.  This is especially true of the  first half of the film, where you'll often find the characters are telling  you things the film should be showing you.  This drags down the pace of  individual scenes, though overall the film moves from scene to scene at a  breakneck speed, trying to fit in as much of the book's content as  possible.  The end result is disconcerting.
Things improve quite a bit in  the second half, where the screenplay eases up on trying to fit everything  in, and a few haunting scenes show Michael Mann's visual skills to best  advantage - but ultimately, the (apparently) low budget and the cast (which  is competent, but not really memorable) keep the film from the heights it  could have achieved.
The full-screen VHS cassette of Manhunter has a few  drawbacks that deserve mention here, most notably that it's in EP mode,  which harms the quality of the image. Because the film was photographed in  the Super 35 format, the transfer is made without too great a loss of  visual information on the sides -  but by taking in more information on the  bottom and (especially) the top, the composition of the frame is too loose  and uninteresting, and a boom microphone makes occasional appearances at  the top of the frame.

Yet I'll throw my vote behind ""Manhunter""  as the best of the movies made from Thomas Harris's characters. Based on  his ""Red Dragon,"" Director Michael Mann brilliantly tells the  tale of a serial killer (a spooky Tom Noonan) and an imprisoned Hannibal  Lector (Brian Cox) and a tortured FBI man( William L. Petersen) who has met  and been scarred by Lector before and has to be coaxed out of retirement.  Petersen is an excellent actor, giving a great, multi-faceted performance,  not so much a supercop, but adept at ""getting"" into the head of  the killers, not something he likes but is necessary. Part of the greatness  of ""Manhunter"" is watching Petersen put the pieces together and  being haunted by the strange doctor he can't get out of his thoughts. Brain  Cox is no Anthony Hopkins, but his Lector is more subtle, yes a little more  creepier. The action sequences are short, shocking and well done. Michael  Mann goes more for the psychological truths and turns out a classic movie  of great strength, integrity, and does what its  supposed to do, what it  does to Petersen, gets into the viewer's head and leaves you with a case of  A-1 creeps! A great movie. Revisit it and compare it to its sequel. They  are both interesting but I cast my vote for ""Manhunter"" as the  best of the two films.

William Peterson plays the physically and mentally scarred  Will Graham, (because Dr. Lechter sliced him with a linoleum knife, and he  can think like a killer); Tim Noonan is fun as Francis Dolarhyde; Dennis  Farina is the driven and wheedling Jack Crawford, drawing Graham back into  the game he (Graham) hates, yet excells at solving; and this Dr. Hannibal  Lechter is better than Anthony Hopkins.  I realize this may be  sacriligious, but it's true. Read the book and compare the scenes. The  details are closely followed down to the all-white cell, clothing, and  hockey mask. This Dr. Lechter, I'm afraid and apologize that I can't  remember the actor's name, is truly ""sleek as an otter.""

Brian Cox gives Lektor a cool & calculating, yet sinister,  sheen -- much more subtle than Sir Anthony Hopkins' take on him years later  in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. Comparisons are unfair, though.  Both were  excellent.
Most interesting about MANHUNTER's story, the reluctant yet  vigorous and obsessive pursuit of a serial killer by a retired FBI  profiler, is the detail of the search -- the forensics, the legwork, the  research, and the careful plodding.  When FBI agent Will Graham finally  breaks the case open, we feel the same horrifying thrill.  We are  simultaneously excited and fearful.

This movie had exceptional dialogue, motivation, and depth - at a level Silence of the Lambs could not  touch.  William Peterson presented a believable and capable FBI profiler  and Dennis Farina complemented this with the impetus you would expect from  an FBI director.  Brian Cox was magnificent as Hannibal Lektor, living the  script as a genius and psychopath.  Francis Dollarhyde (killer) was a truly  terrifying nemisis, which his educated yet perverted manifestation of  artistic impression.  The supporting cast rounded out the plot with the  detail and grounds to move from ignorance to a well defined conclusion.  Michael Mann also imposed a wonderful musical score suiting every stage of  the movie.
Silence of the Lambs (1991) extended the Lektor myth.  Although a decent movie with good acting,  the movie was relatively  shallow.  Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) was an upcoming agent, but her  methods were weak and blind luck was her greatest asset.  Buffalo Bill (the  killer) was basically portrayed as a moronic psychopathic killer with a few  gadgets to provide him his edge.  Lektor (Anthony Hopkins) was portrayed  more of a demon with supernatural abilities, as opposed to the low-key  sophistication and intellectual prowess the character originally had.  Also, note the many dialogue rip-offs from Manhunter when Lektor is being  interviewed Clarice Starling versus Will Graham in Manhunter; these were  convenienltly removed from the re-release of Manhunter so beware... you may  not be getting the original version.

Michael  Mann takes Harris' novel and tells the story on his own terms, wisely  abandoning Harris' literary aspects in favor of his own visual and aural  strategies.

And Mann fills the screen (as usual) with actors  able to convey the story with effective, often silent performances (William  Petersen, Tom Noonan, and Joan Allen's turns are every bit as impressive as  Cox's).
We can only hope that producer Dino di Laurentiis will cash in on  the interest in the HANNIBAL film project (and in Mann's latest film THE  INSIDER) and rerelease this in a restored version.
Incidentally, an  interview with Cox on playing Lecter can be found in a volume of John  Boorman's film journal PROJECTIONS.  Essential reading.",937267200,3,1365,4.890350877192983

749700,5,6303954103,"A true sleeper. This is Mann at his best. He shows his unique ability to combine music with image oh so well in this film. Several times the movie seemed to draw you into it. LAMBS may have had a bigger budget and bigger  name stars, but Manhunter was a supurb potrayal of Lecktor and Graham. I  hope that when the next Lecktor movie is made, that the character of Will  Graham is brought into it. It would be nice if Mann could direct it as well",929404800,,446,4.103448275862069
749701,1,6303954103,"I pity anyone who watches this film without having read Red Dragon.  This film works more as a Cliff's Notes adaptation to a brilliant novel.  It seems as though the director wanted the Tiger scene so bad, he left out all  explanation to the audiendce.  I advise people to READ THE BOOK, and stay  away from this hokey, BORING, movie.",929318400,,334,4.5
749702,5,6303954103,"One of the best movies, book-movie adaptations I have ever seen. I hadn't read Thomas Harris' novel Red Dragon before seeing Manhunter, but the film inspired me to. The book was magnificent and looking back the film had  captured all of the suspense leaving nothing out. The soundtrack is great  too, but unfortunately only available on cassette.",918691200,,346,5.052631578947368

If you liked 'Heat', or any of his others, youll love this so often overlooked masterpiece.  William Petersen!  Michael Mann!  Richard Gere, Paul Newman, and Mel Gibson all considered until MM saw Petersen in 'To Live and Die in LA'.  History in the making...",1523318400,,493,4.891566265060241
