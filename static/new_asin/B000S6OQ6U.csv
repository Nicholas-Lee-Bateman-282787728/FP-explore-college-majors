This set of DVDs is a compilation of documentaries from various sources.  It focuses on Hinn, although there is plenty of Paul Crouch footage and a little Catherine Kuhlman (Hinn says he modeled is ministry after hers).  References to others is purely incidental and ancillary to the examination of Hinn.  The producers have an ENORMOUS archive.  The second DVD is the best.

I could do without the ""humor"".  Watching late night comedians poke fun is not entertaining or informative.  The DVD gives you the option to skip those parts.

I found the HBO special - especially concerning hypnosis - very informative.

Combined, the set examines every aspect of Hinn's activities in depth: the healings, the money, his organization, the personalities.  Investigations into his claims:  He says he went to a hospital and multitudes were healed.  So investigators went to the hospital.  Hinn claims a man was raised from the dead and they have it on tape.  (The platform is always taped from multiple angles, because they sell and broadcast the tapes.)  So investigators ask for the tape.  Hinn agreed to provide medical documentation of claimed healings, so investigators followed up on all five.

I'm selling it short.  The set is multi-faceted, detailed, and well documented - sometimes to the point of boring redundancy.  Despite the redundancy, be sure you watch the whole thing.",1247616000,10,1530,5.084677419354839
