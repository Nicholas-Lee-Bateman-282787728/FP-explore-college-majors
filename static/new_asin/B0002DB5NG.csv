2078202,5,B0002DB5NG,"Hey All.  I just got done watching this well done DVD.  I love Conan, and this DVD brings all of his best moments together.  Once I started watching it, I couldn't stop.  It truly is amazing how one person can be this funny. I highly reccomend it for anyone who would like to enjoy a good laugh for 63 minutes.",1092268800,,310,4.116666666666666
2078203,5,B0002DB5NG,"The Best of Triumph the Insult Comic Dog will probably not do well outside of the targeted demographic, or with those unfamiliar with the irreverent canine made popular through stints on Late Night with Conan O'Brien.  But if you are a fan, you will LOVE this DVD!

It's amazing to see the progression of Triumph from his early days.  The older segments are the weakest and the Westminster Dog Show clips do get a little stale after a while, but the ""Man on the Street"" bits and face-to-face celebrity insults are when Triumph shines his brightest, and he's got plenty of time to shine here.  The interviews with at the American Idol tryouts and the Star Wars premiere are the most side-splittingly funny moments on this DVD.  You'll also see Triumph give a tour of Celebrity Hollywood Homes, picking up a special guest along the way, as well as pooping on pop stars at the MTV Video Music Awards.  Insults are hurled directly at John Tesh, Pauly Shore, Survivor's Richard Hatch, Jerry Springer, and Tom Arnold among others.

Triumph is a cult favorite among males 18-35, and this DVD won't disappoint them at all.",1092268800,4,1114,4.711340206185567
2078204,5,B0002DB5NG,"Every memorable skit of Triumph is present on this DVD. Picture and sound quality is great especially if you are only used to the crappy downloads from ifilms.com or even worse from filesharing clients.

This DVD is very funny and I'm having a very hard time thinking of another DVD that made me laugh this hard...

Especially the Outtakes are great - where you will find out that the man himself (Smigel) is quite a lunatic ;)

To sum it up: Do yourself a favor; stop licking yourself for a minute and order it right now!",1092268800,3,522,4.416666666666667

2078241,5,B0002DB5NG,"On word of a new show starring Triumph & Jack McBrayer starting soon on Adult Swim, I re-watched a bit of this video the other night to gain a fresh perspective. Namely, Smigel's hand puppet alter-ego is best when his humor is broad and less compulsively focused on his twin obsessions, sex and excrement. The Westminster Dog Show segments are therefore the weakest, the nerd-baiting at a Star Wars movie opening the funniest. It's a comprehensive DVD with a wealth of material though, so fans can skip over a lot and still have a lot left to enjoy. Recommended but not for watching with Ma  unless her surname is Barker.",1423353600,,621,4.6454545454545455

Eight years and two talkshows later I was happy to catch this on sale for $6.70 There are some very funny Late Night moments on this, I'm happy with it. I'm also impressed I ordered it less than a week before Christmas and it showed up Christmas Eve. The list price is currently about $15 but I don't think I would've paid $15 for it (especially since NBC is probably getting a cut of the profits). $10, sure but $15 seems a bit much. So if you see this on sale for a decent price it's worth picking up. Be sure to find the hidden ""Secrets"" segments they're hilarious!",1356393600,2,615,4.176470588235294

2078273,5,B0002DB5NG,"Because I work for a living, Late Night has never been must see TV for me. Triumph is new to me. I enjoyed the episodes and it reminded me of that unique type of humor one must have to enjoy odd-ball type of humor such as Mr. Bill or this.

 I enjoyed nearly all the episodes, especially the jam session with Bon Jovi as well as the Star Wars episode and the making fun of William Shatner's ""acting"" in the additional poop section. I did not enjoy the making fun of French Canadians. It was more insulting than humorous, unlike the rest of the episodes.

Before I would buy or rent this movie, I would check on line for episodes to see if you enjoy this type of humor as half the time it is crude and vulgar.",1285459200,,708,4.115942028985507

2078279,4,B0002DB5NG,"Yes, I know that Triumph (aka Robert Smigel) does not appeal to all people's tastes, but I (mostly) love his stuff.
The REAL reason for this purchase was the Star Wars movie premiere piece, which I had seen a few years ago.
Admittedly, some of the humor borders on the level of Beavis & Butt-Head, but it is simply wonderful seeing people we all wish we could make fun of getting it from a hilariously primitive rubber Rottweiller puppet.
To the credit of the Star Wars nerds, they did not mind laughing along, even though the jokes were aimed at them.
At least they had a modicum of coolness.
Also, of the two Westminster dog show pieces, I actually found the second one funnier.
I only wish _I_ could do that...and get away with it!

2078280,3,B0002DB5NG,"Conan O'Brien popularized the insult comic dog puppet, Triumph. The dog is tacky, raunchy, crude, at times hilarious, in bad taste, and in your face. When he visits the Westminster Kennel Dog Show the owners are often shocked, annoyed, and genuinely teed off by his profane comments. A lot of his humor falls flat because he's so gross, pushy, and aggressive. At the MTV video music awards show he gets in a tussle with Eminem and ends up at a press conference wearing a neck brace.
 Either you enjoy his raunchy humor, or he turns you off. Scatological, obnoxious, noxious episodes include his visit to Quebec to do a number on French Canadian boorishness, his gig at the Bon Jovi concert, his attack on the costumed dorks and nerds outside a Star Wars movie premiere, and his appearance on Hollywood Squares where he jokes about flatulence. He'll do anything for a dirty laugh line. Often people don't know whether to laugh at him or hit him; it's often nervous laughter from hapless victims. This is an acquired taste. Some people like liver and onions; some people abhor it. Be ready for vulgarity, lewdness and tastelessness.",1216857600,,1130,4.794871794871795

The jokes come a mile a minute, and are unbelivably funny.  Smigel has never been better than with Triumph.  I thought my heart was going to stop, from laughing so hard.

This DVD covers Triumph's correspondent trips to a few Westminster Dog Shows, the opening of a Star Wars movie, American Idol tryouts, the MTV Video Music Award and more.

My personal favorite is the Star Wars opening.  The stinging insults Triumph dishes out on this particular occassion are insanely funny - and he even enlists the help of Dr. Spock to come in and finish the job.  This should not be missed... Seriously!

My only complain about this DVD is regarding the extra features, in which I felt a little bit disappointed. There was plenty material from 10 years of great shows to pick up and put as extra. Unfortunately, the selections were not the funniest. Regardless of the existence of other DVDs or books, the extras should have included, for example, bits from Triumph and from the ""In the year 2000"" sketches. There is nothing from them.

2078374,5,B0002DB5NG,"I do not remember the last time I laughed as much as I did in watching this DVD.

""Discovered"" by Conan O'Brien in 1997 in a dog's contest (Westminter's), Triumph the Insult Comic Dog has made a ""career"" featured by:
- His uncanny ability to ""say it as it is"" (for example: making fun of the nerds on line for days to watch the release of a Star Wars movie, or making fun of American Idol contestants, or of Pauley Shore, John Tesh, William Shatner ....)
- His restless and unbounded ""sexual drive""

This DVD has a lot of content. Perhaps the most relevant is:
- The ""main"" part, which includes many Triumph ""specials"" in which he was sent as a correspondent of Conan's show to describe events such as: a Jon Bon Jovi concert in New Jersey, the Westminster dog contest, American Idol, Hollywood Squares, the MTV Video awards, etc.
- Live appearances of Triumph on Late Night. Here you will find classical Triumph material with William Shatner, Tom Arnold, etc.

This is edgy comedy that is not suited for everybody. But if you have enjoyed watching Triumph's appearances on Late Night, get this DVD. It is more than worth it.",1129420800,2,1125,4.5594059405940595

2078393,4,B0002DB5NG,"The DVD of Conan O'Brien's 10th anniversary is well done and fairly cheaply priced. You get neat extras along with the special that aired a few years back.

There are a lot of mixed feelings about this special. First thing, this was on during prime time, so they had to hold back a little. Being a clip show, it tried to recount past memories and funnies and present. The thing is, there are too many great Conan moments and so the task was at once impossible for the format (63 mins). They tried anyways, and for the most part it's a hit. Good times (even from his unfunny period) and some that will have you questioning its inclusion fill the time, along with several guest appearances. Some guests are on for like 3 seconds (on a three-man bicycle) and it seems too short, while others have five minute long singing parts that seem to go on forever.

In the end, it comes down to whether or not you're familiar with Conan or not. If you're not, it's a treat to see some of his really great stuff. If you are, then there seem to be three ways to go with this special: 1) this is stupid, I've seen this before, bring on the new stuff 2) this is good, funny stuff I remember from back then, or 3) these are okay clips, where are the funny ones that made me fall in love with Conan?!

One of the major selling points would be the extras. There are extra shorts, clips of interviews, and away from the studio pieces.

I felt Conan deserved more for his comedic contributions and making people laugh, but until we can store masses of episodes on hd dvds or whatever, this will have to do. And it does.",1123027200,3,1598,4.281456953642384
2078394,4,B0002DB5NG,I love this dog! My stomach was hurting from laughing so hard. These DVDs are a great choice for those of us who can't stay up late enough to watch Late Night with Conan O'Brien. I highly recommend this DVD.,1121817600,,207,4.2
2078415,5,B0002DB5NG,"Triumph the Insult Comedy Dog is one of the most unlikely successes of the past ten years.  Veteran SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE writer Robert Smigel has managed to create the funniest and most irreverent insult comedy act since Don Rickles, though with two major differences:  unlike Rickles he is truly funny, and unlike Rickles, whose insults rarely are personal, Smigel/Triumph hits uncomfortably close to home (i.e., his insults really are insults, while Rickle's are usually invalid name calling).  Appearing primarily on the Conan O'Brien show, Smigel has managed to parlay what would have with a less funny individual into a one-note gimmick act into a significant second career.  Triumph is a cigar chomping miniature Rottweiller with what appears to be an East European accent, who covers, as he loves to put it, various events ""for me to poop on.""  I personally am not drawn to the sexual and scatological humor in Smigel's act, and I haven't found Triumph's dry humping a host of interviewees to be all that funny.  But his one-liners are absolutely hysterical, and the way he can perfectly bury someone with a deadly accurate crack is a thing of wonder.  How can you take someone seriously dressed up as Darth Vader (""the nerd before whom all other nerds tremble"") when Triumph asks which button on his chest pack contacts the wearer's parents to come pick him up?

This DVD does an excellent job of sampling some of Triumph's best interviews.  We get not one but two visits he takes to the Westminster Dog show, where he spends most of his time boasting of his many sexual conquests, getting thrown out the first time and coming the second pretending to be either Ed Bradley of 60 MINUTES or Barbara Walters.  There is a short account of his experience on the HOLLYWOOD SQUARES, and a long piece covering the lead up to a Bon Jovi concert.  My favorite part of the entire DVD is, however, his encounter with many STAR WARS fans lined up for the first showing of THE ATTACK OF THE CLONES.  The disc also includes the extremely disturbing moment where Eminem's entourage unhumorously shoves Triumph to the side

Triumph is definitely not for everyone.  Not everyone is going to take to his humor, and some people find his shtick to be a little too far on the negative side.  If you don't already know Triumph, the disc should be approached with caution.  But if you already know and enjoy his humor, I can highly recommend the disc.  Triumph has managed to build a surprising following over the years, and last year even managed to get interviewed by Terry Gross on NPR's ""Fresh Air,"" the height of respectability.

I do slightly regret the timing of the release of this disc.  Only a couple of months after the appearance of THE BEST OF TRIUMPH, probably the funniest single thing he has ever done appeared on Conan when Triumph covered one of the presidential debates in the piece known as ""Poop Valhalla.""  The video can be seen on various sites on the Internet, and anyone Googling ""poop,"" ""Valhalla,"" and ""Triumph"" will definitely have their efforts regarded with one of the most hysterically funny bits one can ever hope to see.",1119744000,13,3137,4.774074074074074

This is one hilarious DVD! ""The Best Of Triumph"" contains all of his skits and a few more highlights (checking out the special features is a must).

The hour long ""Best of"" show features Triumph at the Westminster Dog Show (sneaking in the following year as Ed Bradley from ""60 Minutes""), the line at the Ziegfield theater for the opening day of ""Star Wars Episode II"" (Triumph humps a plush R2-D2 to death), traveling to Hawaii for the ""American Idol"" tryouts, & Triumph poops on Bon Jovi telling him Bon Jovi gives poop a bad name.

There is a lot more in the special features section. Triumph poops on David Hasselhoff, William Shatner, & Fabio, to name a few. Also included, all outtakes from the hour long ""Best of "" show. I haven't laughed this hard in loooong time.

2078419,5,B0002DB5NG,"Triumph clips were yanked off the net a couple of years ago by NBC's legal department.  People hosting Triumph clips were actually threatened with lawsuits.  This was ridiculous in my opinion because I would never have found out about Triumph if it wasn't for these clips circulating on the net.  Certainly, I never would have thought that something like Triumph could exist on the utterly mindnumbing Conan show.  While NBC eventually hosted streaming clips of Triumph I think that being able to download clips is what fueled demand for what has ultimately arrived.  And what has arrived is awesome.

This DVD gives it up in a huuuuuge way.  Every clip that you ever wanted is presented in full fidelity and is mostly uncut.  I think the editing that was done works to make the DVD more enjoyable from a presentation standpoint.  However, I do agree that it would be awesome to get ALL the raw footage that Triumph ever did on Conan.

I can watch it over and over so there's definitely good replay value here. There are a few sketches that I just can't get enough of; like when Triumph goes to Quebec and the Bon Jovi concert and when he goes to Hawaii for the American Idol auditions. These are just classic.

2078423,4,B0002DB5NG,"No one will ever accuse Conan's show of being the funniest thing on tv. He isn't fast with the comeback like Letterman (nor does he have Letterman's slightly odd and neurotically funny take on things); he isn't as hilarious as Leno (whose team of writers is one of the best since the Jack Benny show); his timing is often off; his comedy is  more visual (the best jokes on this DVD are sight gags) than one would expect from a talk show host. The first few years of his show were grim - many wondered how they could have made such a poor choice for such an important slot. Now comfortably in his second decade, Conan's show has become enjoyable because it has become so familiar. Andy Richter is everyone's pudgy, funny, frat buddy. Conan has become the polished wiseass that we all love. The regulars are outrageous enough to provide some comedic highs in an generally tepid show. This DVD gathers some of the best bits and the pace moves quick enough to be very entertaining. As soon as a bit appears to be dying, you get another one.

Before watching this DVD, which is a compilation of most of the stuff relating to Triumph on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, I was a little skeptical.  True, I knew Triumph to be one uninhibited and outrageously funny son of a b! tch (literally), but I was not sure if all that low brow humour was going to be able to sustain itself and keep me laughing for 2 and a half hours.

I'm glad to say that I did, in fact my face was so sore after laughing non-stop I had to stop the DVD 30 minutes into it to take a break.  Now I will tell you that Triumph's jokes and stunts revolve mostly around things of a sexual and/or fecal nature.  But there's a different twist to it because each time he's doing it with a different audience.  The best segments for me are his role as a commentator at the Westminster dog show; his appearance on Hollywood Square; and his trip to Quebec (those French Canadians get it bad!).  His humour is always outrageous and ruthless, but seems to be very on-the-point.  He's like a Howard Stern on high grade crack cocaine, who spares no one and is humping and pooping all the way to the bank.",1105056000,,1189,4.276785714285714

If you have never seen Triumph the Insult Comic Dog before, the synopsis is simple but sweet: Triumph is a cigar-chomping, foul-mouthed sock puppet dog, who attends gala events to interview the participants. He covers rock concerts, dog shows, movie premieres, and even the citizens of Quebec!

All of his greatest Conan O'Brien moments are here, with his appearance at the Star Wars ""Attack of the Clones"" premiere stealing the show. Both of Triumph's infamous Westminster Dog Show appearances are here (security ejects Triumph from each show!), as is his coverage of the Bon Jovi concert.

As for the extras, they are priceless for different reasons. His first appearances on O'Brien are included, and while not all of these clips are knock-out funny, it is fun to see how the Triumph persona evolves into the crass sock puppet we have grown to cherish. His barbs at Conan's guests are priceless, especially when he begs forgiveness from Don Rickles after mocking him.

2078449,4,B0002DB5NG,"This DVD is a companion piece to Conan's tenth anniversary show DVD, which I prefer due to the broader range of material, but this DVD is definitely the most poop intensive DVD on the market anywhere. The box modestly claims a 61 minute running time, but when all the extras are included it's actually about 2 1/2 hours long.

The highlights of the DVD for me are Triumph's escorted tour of Hollywood (John Tesh tags along), his verbal attacks on celebrities (especially Simon Cowell, Jerry Springer, and William Shatner), his taunting of the ubernerds waiting in line for a Star Wars premiere, the scuffle with self-important Eminem at the VMA's, doing the weather at a local NBC affiliate in Honolulu, and best of all, singing with Bon Jovi in concert in front of a live audience in New Jersey with some appropriately modified lyrics.

This DVD is probably for existing fans only, as it is extremely obnoxious, generally in the form of poop references. The DVD includes many extras including outtakes and Triumph's music video, ""I Keed,"" as well as his outlandish appearances on the Hollywood Squares, where he discusses Al Roker's flatus at length. Yes, it is pretty sophomoric, but it is generally very funny, and some bits rank up there with the best improv comedy ever caught on tape.

2078455,5,B0002DB5NG,"Unlike the few remaining people who have not warmed to Conan O'Brien, I have found him to be the most innovative and consistently amusing host on late night television from the beginning of his network run. This show is a 90 minute special taped in New York on the occasion of his tenth anniversary show, and features many guests and ""greatest hits"" clips from the first ten years. I was particularly amused by the Andy Richter cameo and the fitting tribute to Conan of having John Tesh, Abe Vigoda, and William Shatner ride a bicycle built for three across the stage. I am unsure why that was a fitting tribute, but in context it certainly surprised and amused the audience. (Shatner also pleases the crowd to no end when he forgets the name ""Captain Kirk"" during a memory lapse, only to be goaded by Conan.) There is a disturbing, yet hilarious bit by Will Ferrell, which will haunt your memory for a very long time after viewing. The only real negatives were sketches featuring Jack Black and Ben Stiller both of whom took up valuable time and were even less funny than usual.

The DVD has several extras, including outtakes, behind the scenes views, and particularly amusing (and lengthy) comedy pieces. I was especially fond of the trip to Ireland sequence, and the sketch in which Conan starts his own boy band.

My favourite moments would have to be Gwyneth Paltrow's secret confession, both appearances by Jim Carrey and of course Conan's own self-deprecating sense of humour. ""I had a dream and that dream was to be known as that jackass who comes on after Leno.""

I often wonder what it would be like working on this show. Absolute madness with no boundaries. As an Australian, I can only get episodes of Late Night on cable TV and most Aussies haven't seen him. I think most Aussies would agree that pretty much all of the attempts at talk shows here are quite lame, and one particular host just plain plagiarises Conan's stuff only minus the comic delivery.

This is definitely the best talk show around",1097625600,8,861,4.541935483870968

And when the continuing characters all come out (like vomiting Kermit, who I thought was a gem) it's really funny, too.  Kermit DOES vomit everywhere,so...

I was laughing so hard I couldn't breath!!!  The very next day I woke up with a mission in life, and that mission was to go buy this DVD.  That was it.

Then the next night I invited all of may family over to my grandparents house to watch it on the big screen, and EVERYONE could not stop laughing.

That would be more than enough to make this worth the effort.

I own DVDs of Seinfeld, Chris Rock, Chris Tucker, Dave Chappelle and 5-6 Saturday Night Live ""Best Of"" DVDs, and Conan's 10 Year was, is, and will be the funniest out of the entire collection!  (Chappelle's ""Killin' Them Softly"" is a close 2nd).

Triumph to Jon Bon Jovi: ""So I hear you are in a Vampire movie. Is that right?""

2078494,3,B0002DB5NG,"I've downloaded a lot of Triumph's segments and was certainly pleased to know that there'd be a DVD coming out. Unfortunately, I'm rather disappointed that there were plenty I had which weren't on the disc and some unneccesary cuts, too:

EDITS NOTICED:

- attacking Simon Cowell of 'American Idol' (about 40 funny seconds missing; another zing at Simon...and Triumph has to fix his arm)

- from the Christmas special skit, as was mentioned earlier by another reviewer, there's no longer a part where Triumph gets annoyed with Kathie Lee's singing; also, he and Conan sang

  a lot more of ""Let It Snow"", which is gone for some unknown reason (about a minute and a half missing)

- during the 125th annual Westminster dog show, about a half minute is gone at the beginning where Triumph is talking over the announcers and putting them down

- another segment, the 2001 MTV Viewer's Choice Award, where he in the audience and wants to sniff Jennifer Lopez (J-Lo's) butt, is gone -- and riciculously replaced with an artist's  rendering and some 'warning' that last for just a few seconds

COMPLETELY MISSING:

- roasting Rob Reiner at the Friar's Club (shown on Comedy Central; about 3:20)

- 'State Of the Show' segment (about three and a half minutes)

- singing 'Underaged Bejon' (before a commercial break; about a minute)

- ripping on sidekick Andy, who visits after he left the show (about three minutes)

- making fun of guest in upcoming show (about two minutes)

- interviewed on 'Daily Show' with Jon Stewart (shown on Comedy Central; about 4:15)

- there are segments of Triumph in Hollywood on the DVD, but there was an earlier one where he was 'already there' and was talking about Conan's upcoming week of shows in Hollywood;

it's too bad that this isn't available on the disc (about 3:20)

- he pops out of a gift box on Conan's birthday, gives him a special cake, and sings (about four minutes)

- segment for the troops (I got this 2 minute clip from the NBC site; Triumph's in a tank... drops a bomb of poop on Geraldo's head...etc.; I'm sure there's more to it)

- Barbara Walters mock interview (almost 3 minutes)

They're all great! Each is a 'best of' to me and they're so small that I think everything possible should have been included. Perhaps they weren't able to get permission to use the Comedy Central parts for some reason, but for not putting SO MANY others on here is somewhat inexcusable.

So, this is a hilarious collection that did have things that I never saw before (i.e. the very first appearance), but it needed a bit more work: more segments and better arrangements of the available segments. The main part runs for about a quick hour and then there are lots of other skits in separate areas ... but I don't see why, for example, the longer 'American Idol' skits were shuffled off to an extras area instead of being in with the regular batch. Just a bit of unnecessary usage of the remote; the humour could have kept flowing. Also, not a big deal, but there was a main word right on the menu that was spelled incorrectly.

It's funny; has a great price; and looks good. I'll give it a 3 1/2 stars in the end. Perhaps we'll get a volume II with all of these plus some new ones in a few years; I know I'd buy it.",1093478400,16,3251,4.536878216123499

The Hollywood Squares episodes, especially with Kathy Lee was priceless!!  The American Idol auditions - another gut buster!!

If you want to laugh and you admire excellent satire, buy this DVD!  You'll find yourself watching it over and over!  A nice job by the DVD production company to pack this thing full of extras.  For $17.00, it's worth every penny.",1093305600,4,525,4.808988764044944

The great thing is, after you get done with the main part of the DVD, there are so many great extras it's like getting 2 DVDs for the price of one!

Triumph popped up at the bottom of the screen and uttered the classic line: ""PLEASE SHUT UP B**CH"" and then howled in pain for a few seconds before groaning, ""help me jesus."" im sorry but this was one of my favorite catch-phrases at work for people who don't know when to stop yammering. anyway this is a great dvd with all of Triumph's best moments captured for us-and i say YES!!!

* Comedy shorts- 8 very brief(under a minute) clips that didn't make it to the main show that aired. (my favorite being Clive Clemmons' Innappropriate response Channel)

* Favorite guest moments- 6 very brief clips as well.  (including the classic Courtney Thorne Smith vs Norm MacDonald segment where Norm went to town on a movie ""Chairman of the 'Bored'"" she did with Carrot Top)

* Conan on location- 4 comedy bits in their entirety.  Including Famous helping people(good one with Sting 'celebrating' those celebrity/charity music things); Conan in Ireland(another good one with him 'looking' for his roots); Conan visits LA actresses(great one that is PAINFULLY funny! this is where he visits past female guests of the show to try to 'get it on');  Dudez a Plenti(another great one, this is the first one where Conan is forming the band not the one where they make the video.  classic, plus the song is not bad either)

There's also an extensive backstage photo gallery of the annivesry show, and a ""celebrity...secrets"" bonus in the dvd.  Again, whether you're a fan or not, this is highly recommended to those who love to laugh and want value in their dvd's.

2078536,5,B0002DB5NG,"The premise of ""Triumph the Comic Insult Dog"" is one of those strokes of genius that comes along once every decade or so: A rubber rotweiller sock-puppet (though referred to in this disc as a ""Yugoslavian hound,"" probably because his master is Jewish and doesn't feel too comfortable with the Third Reich connotations of owning a Teutonic terrier) who chomps on an unlit stogy and hurls invective and Don Rickles-style brickbats at easy targets in a Borscht-belt Slavic accent while humping their legs!

What could have been a minor bit of curiosity has become a full-time gig on the Conan O'Brien Show and even a cottage industry all due to the caustic wit and snarling antics of Triumph's creator and master, Robert Smigel. Last week, Triumph was even a guest on ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" although he went really easy on the thin-skinned sandbagger from Levittown. I imagine it was because the pooch was in awe of being in the presence of a fellow insult-hurler par excellence.

Smigel, who created such off-the-wall ""TV Funhouse"" fare for Saturday Night Live as ""Fun With Real Audio,"" ""The Ex-Presidents"" and ""The Go-Lords,"" is the rather boychik looking brains behind his canine alter-ego. Smigel's bits work so well because while it would be extremely shocking and bizarre for a curly-haired Jewish nebbish to hump a poodle or to call Barbra Streisand a b*tch, it suddenly becomes uproariously hilarious when seeing a talking dog hand puppet doing same.

This collection's greatest bits are:  Triumph's spoofs on lame musicians Jon Bon Jovi and John Tesh (though I must hand it to these two: They both rose quite highly in my estimation for so good-naturedly taking Triumph's dead-on poop on the chin, insult after insult!); Triumph's skewering of Star Wars ""Ueber Dorks,"" those people without lives who camped out for weeks in front of the Ziegfeld Theatre in Manhattan, just to be the first to see the new ""prequel"" Attack of the Clones; and, Triumph's rolling over and playing fetch to the Lord/God/King of all insult comics, Don Rickles.  ""No! Rickles, they put me up to this.  I want YOU to poop ON ME!"" shouts our pug-nosed protagonist whilst emerging from a toilet bowl.  I was doubled-over in laughter at that one.

But, the best one of all is his decimation of the Quebecois, those French-Canadians in Quebec City, where Triumph scored his biggest triumph, when the Conan show was taping in Toronto.  Triumph brings renewed vigour to every (true) stereotype about the French and the Quebecois, such as ""I don't know that much French. Just everyday sayings like 'I surrender'"" and ""Hey! This is North America! Learn the language!""

The merde-de-la-merde was when he interviewed a pair of ""100 per cent"" self-identified separatists, and, hushing them, asked them to identify ""what is *that* sound? It's the sound of NOBODY GIVING A S***!!!""  Touche!

There are tons of extras on this disc, best of all, Triumph's rap video ""I Keed,"" in which he steamrolls over the current celebrity scene, from Britney Speers, Justin Timberlake and Coldplay to Snoop Dogg, P. Diddy and Jennifer Lopez. But he saves his best rhyme for minimalist composer, Philip Glass:

Philip Glass / Hey, Atonal a** / You're not immune / Write a song with a f***ing tune!

To Triumph and his grand master, Robert Smigel: We thank the comic gods for edifying us with your scatological erudition. You guys are the greatest....FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!",1092441600,13,3422,4.939024390243903
2078537,5,B0002DB5NG,"In the late-night wars, Letterman and Leno may be battling for the crown, but Conan O'Brien is firmly entrenched as the court jester. Taking cues from oldsters like Johnny Carson, O'Brien is still fresh enough to embrace the comedy landmarks of Kids in The Hall and the really good SNLs. His talk show, really a showcase for his wit and ability to subvert any tired and true TV cliche, is reason enough to celebrate.

The DVD package here is a tenth anniversary special Conan and the gang did from the beacon theatre back in September '03. I put this down on tape when it aired, but already it had started showing signs of fading. I had to get the DVD.

Though it adheres to the standard ""clip package"" of most talk-show retrospectives, you can never expect Conan to settle for merely showing some favorite clips from his ten-year reign. Will Ferrell, Jack Black, and the triumverate of Tesh, Vigoda, and Shatner make appearances. Even erstwhile sidekick and beloved cult figure Andy Richter stops by, modestly as always.

There are other great reasons to own this DVD, wanna hear 'em?

The bonus features include Conan classics that didn't make it into the show: a hilarious commercial Andy and Conan did in a furniture store (think low budget/bad acting), the immortal ""Dudz A Plenti"", and Conan stalking various Hollywood beauties. But wait, there's more!

Favorite guests clips includes Courtney Thorne-Smith's appearance to plug ""Chairman of The Board"" (as Norm MacDonald cracks wise in the next seat), and so on...

If there were any way to make this DVD better, I'd shoot myself while covered in gravy!...okay, there is one way: include the fifth-anniversary special, or Andy's last night on the show (both of which are on my fading tapes collection, perhaps lost to the ages). Otherwise, this is an awesome DVD package...for me to poop on!

Anyway, don't let my hijinks scare you off: Take two ""Late Night With Conan O'Brien"" and call me in the morning.",1092441600,11,1961,4.835820895522388
2078538,5,B0002DB5NG,"For those of you that don't know, Robert Smigel was a SNL writer during the early 90's (Farley, Sandler, etc).  You may have seen his acting in many Adam Sandler movies: The Wedding Singer (the chef; ""Relax""), Billy Madison (chem teacher/boraphil guy), and Happy Gilmore (Repo man; ""You really hate me now, don't you?"").  Well he is the voice, the arm, and the brains behind Triumph.  There was a spinoff of Triumph, TV Funhouse (he wrote all the TV Funhouse skits on SNL), which featured many animal puppets, and was short lived on Comedy Central greatly due to its very adult content.  However, Triumph has continued to be a hit.  The Star Wars: Episode 2 opening feature has become a classic among Conan fans.  Some truly great stuff in that one, along with others.

As much as I love Austin Powers, the Simpsons, Seinfeld, George Carlin, Airplane movie, and anything else comedy related, these never make you belly laugh continuously from beginning to end.

Triumph the Insult Comic Dog does!!!

And it comes so effortlessly.  It's not a mystery what this CD is.  For the few who don't know, Triumph the Insult Comic Dog is a barb sharing, accent laden puppet - a character performed by Robert Smigel and a regular on Conan O'Brien show.  Triumph simply goes out and interviews people at various locales.

These are simply clips of Triumph's best moments from Conan.  Bon Jovi, Westminster Dog Show (two of them), MTV awards, Hollywood Squares, Quebec, Canada, and the best of them all, the Star Wars premiere. You might have seen most of them if you watch the show.  But its comic gold... rude, clever, no holds barred, and so intelligent.  Robert Smigel's mind is crazy and brilliant.  And so so quick.

I happen to flip through the TV listings the other night and saw that ""Triumph"" was to be on the McEnroe show on CNBC.  I knew this was required viewing.  For the 1/2 hour he was on the show, I laughed the entire time.  Triumph ripped McEnroe and his sidekick apart, with mostly improv material I believe.

Caught the Conan O Brian, infomercial for this product as well.  Triumph's apprearance is unbelievable as well.

This is easily the best $15 you can spend.  If you watch this clips over and over, they will still be funny.  And I haven't even viewed the extras yet.

Why in the world they do not give Triumph (Robert Smigel) his own show is beyond me.  Just give Triumph a talk show and it would be hilarious every night.

Hope this helps.  Enjoy!!",1092355200,10,1782,4.601910828025478
2078541,5,B0002DB5NG,"I watched the informercial for this DVD yesterday night, and the 10th anniversary show last year. Both are hilarious and full of witty humors. Conan is best at making fun of himself and his own show. Few people will push the edge, but he does. I truly adore him for someone who is not classically handsome.",1092355200,3,306,4.482142857142857
8026506,5,B0002DB5NG,"easily one of the most consistently funny and irreverent DVD's of all time, Triumph (and the man behind him) are brilliant.  The attack on the Star Wars fans and the interview with the guys from Bon Jovi are side splitting.  Buy this now !",1516752000,,239,4.409090909090909
