8053647,5,B0007XLFEK,"Through this 20-minute documentary, the Christian persecution ministry Voice of the Martyrs introduces us to five Christian victims of the recent wave of convert-or-die Indonesian Islamic terror.  The DVD interviews the victims and intersperses some reenactments of traumatic events to convey their suffering and message that God used it for His good purpose.

Though there is not much graphic violence depicted, probably it is too much for younger children.  Johannes, a Christian, does show his scars from being hacked and stabbed on the ear, shoulder, arm, back, neck, and leg.  Remembering the verse from Mt 6:15, Johannes had declined the jihadists' option to convert and deny Christ before men, and yet he survived and now expresses his desire to thank his attackers for helping him to become closer to God.  The other interviewees stories vary in the details, but are alike in bearing witness to faith strengthened through fellowship of suffering and  gratitude for world Christians who have helped Voice of the Martyrs in their support of the refugees, rebuilding churches, supplying literature, paying school fees, and more.

The persecution in this Indonesian nation is severe, and this DVD can be used as an inspirational tool to fulfill the command to ""bear one another's burdens.""  This is not a feature-length film nor even an entertaining one, and my high rating reflects on excellence for what the movie attempts to do: raise awareness, expose evil, and bear testimony.  The problem is big, literally--Indonesia, nation of 200 million Muslims, is not some tiny island, but an archipelago of 17,000 islands stretching a distance approximating the span from New York to Los Angeles.",1165708800,10,1696,5.2518518518518515
