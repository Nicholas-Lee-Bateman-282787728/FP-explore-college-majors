6110421,5,B00GSTZD68,One of the best kid movies to explain the bible. Adults will learn from it as well. Educational and fun to watch!,1418774400,,113,4.181818181818182
6110422,5,B00GSTZD68,"Fantastic!  My kids love watching these DVD's.  The writing is funny and entertaining, but the content is far more than you would expect from a children's program.  I really appreciate the depth of information.  Phil Vischer doesn't flinch from the tough questions.  I've learned a bunch too!  We'll be purchasing the full series.",1416614400,2,330,5.132075471698113
6110423,5,B00GSTZD68,This is good stuff. The kids love watching it (so do the grown folks) and it is stuffed full of good biblical information.  I recommend it to everyone :),1411948800,,153,4.275862068965517
8627157,5,B00GSTZD68,Everyone in our family enjoys this show! It's really fun but also so informative! My husband and I learn a lot about the history of the Bible along with our kids. I love how Phil doesn't shy away from complicated word and concepts or hard things that happen in scripture because it's a kid's show. We've recommended it to a lot of people-even people without kids-as a way to get a better understanding of God's word. Highly recommend this one!,1490659200,,443,4.55
8627158,5,B00GSTZD68,We love these dvds!  We kept getting them from our library and just decided to buy them since they were so good.  I am an adult who has read and loved scripture for years and I find myself learning something every time we watch as a family!,1490054400,,240,4.085106382978723
8627159,5,B00GSTZD68,"Great Product.
Ordered for my kids to teach them more about the Bible.
Really humorous approach to a sensitive topic. Everybody loves it.
I really learn a lot!",1489881600,,159,4.714285714285714
8627160,5,B00GSTZD68,This series is great for easily explaining Bible truths and principals to children.  My eight year old cannot get enough of these videos.  We are buying the complete library and I will share them with other parents that want their children to receive something edifying and informative.,1485820800,,286,5.0638297872340425
8627161,5,B00GSTZD68,These dvds are a good way to teach Bible lessons in Sunday School.,1485561600,,66,4.153846153846154
8627162,5,B00GSTZD68,Great movies for very young kids. My three and seven year old enjoyed them.,1484524800,,75,4.428571428571429
8627163,5,B00GSTZD68,"My family loves these movies! We have a 6, 3, and 1 year old and these movies keep all of their attention just as well as any other movie made for kids - but they're learning theological truths along the way! Every movie we've seen so far (we have 4) presents the gospel and talks about how all of the bible is pointing to Jesus coming to save us. My son (6) has loved the silly jokes (the Penta-tacos joke helped him remember the Pentateuch). There are a few things that we don't LOVE. In the 2nd movie one of the characters talks about people hearing God's voice and following, and the way it's presented sounds like it is meant for today, and our family believes God speaks through the bible now and not a voice in our heads. They also stay far far away from any 'scary' talk of hell, which I completely understand. We do talk truthfully with our children about how hell is presented in the bible but I understand that some parents might want to talk to their kids about those subjects without the help of a movie. For the most part the characters simply address it as a place far away from God. These movies are extremely fast paced and packed with information so our children have no problem watching them over and over. I also hear something new almost every time that I didn't remember from watching it before. These movies are a hit with our family and we tell all our friends with small children about them!",1482796800,,1416,4.367424242424242
8627164,5,B00GSTZD68,"These DVD'S are awesome...interesting for kids AND adults. These are made by the awesome Veggie Tales folks and are really well made. Great gift idea, I highly recommend!",1482796800,,170,5.107142857142857
8627165,5,B00GSTZD68,"One of the best Bible teaching tools I've ever seen, and for all ages!  I watched this series with early elementary age kids and I learned as much as they did!  This series goes into great detail about how the Bible was constructed, by whom, what it contains, and what it means for mankind, and I learn something new every time I watch it.  It teaches adult level concepts in a way that children can understand and appreciate, and it does so in a witty, funny, and entertaining way.  And it doesn't pull any punches on the hard stuff.  It approaches controversial Biblical accounts in an open and honest way, and provides intelligent and enlightening explanations for them.  I love this series and highly recommend it for the whole family.",1450224000,,739,4.6461538461538465
8627166,2,B00GSTZD68,I purchased for my granddaughter and am glad I watched it first.  It is maybe informative but not entertaining for young children.  Wish I had not purchased.,1435363200,,157,4.777777777777778
