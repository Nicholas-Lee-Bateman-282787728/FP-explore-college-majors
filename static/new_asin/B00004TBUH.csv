1349878,5,B00004TBUH,An off-beat story of a man trapped on a ship his entire life.  His talent  as a jazz pianist gives him noterity and a chance to escape his alienation.  The sequences of him playing the piano in a challenge and during a rolling  storm are compelling and unique.  If you love jazz this film is a must.,955152000,,299,4.175438596491228
1349879,5,B00004TBUH,Waht a magnificant movie.  Like being in a dream.  Do not miss the scene  of the piano rolling  in the stormy weather.  If you are into piano music  you will give it 10 stars!,953942400,2,175,4.0

1349886,4,B00004TBUH,Very engaging and different but a bit strange to watch an Italian film originally spoken in English ( with Anglo actors) then dubbed in Italian. Not quite what I had expected,1493424000,,174,4.645161290322581
1349887,5,B00004TBUH,"It is a wonderful movie and Tim Roth is extremely talented actor. This movie is about life in music, unusual man, true friendship and overall is very romantic movie. Have a box of tissues ready too. I strongly suggest watching the movie, I have seen it probably 10 times and the music haunts you for a very long time. Great story, wish we had more of movies like this one.",1489449600,,372,4.328571428571428
1349888,5,B00004TBUH,Genius is always discord with the secular life. Their pure thoughts and the pursuit of the arts made them to be phenomenon. The life makes us alienates the familiar affection; utilitarian makes us secular friendship and the desire betrays our love. What is the most impressive of this film for me is the purity of the life.,1488758400,,323,4.684210526315789

1349890,5,B00004TBUH,"I'm what you would call a Millennial. You know, one of those street urchins that typically have their eyes glued to their cell phones? Yea, that age group. I came across this movie by watching the awesome piano duel on you-tube. Then I discovered the full movie had been uploaded too! Gave that a watch and had to purchase the DVD in case the video was taken down. I love this movie. Even though I may be a millennial, I can tell you I still have a heart, and this movie definitely reminded of that fact. The music is incredibly unique and accompanies the story line beautifully.

Go watch a a scene of this movie on you-tube and you'll likely make the same discovery as me, having a heart, that is.",1487289600,,699,4.33587786259542

1349892,5,B00004TBUH,"It is so beautiful to watch. The DOP is to be commended for his work on this film. I loved the sense of an adult fairytale. Some of it was so mesmerising: eg the dancing piano scene. Tim Roth was perfectly cast,as was all of the cast. Thank you for a wonderful couple of hours viewing.",1485302400,,285,4.107142857142857

Later I Netflix-ed it because I liked it so well, I wanted to see it again, and then, I bought it. Both thumbs up.",1479168000,,286,4.277777777777778
1349899,4,B00004TBUH,"To say this is an ""off beat"" story would be true, only the music is ""on"". The story itself is simple, there have been similar tales, this one has something else, it could be true - at least possible. Almost all the scenes are on the ship where a musical prodigy, named 1900, thrives. He never goes ashore. With that as teasers, I'll say this - the sets are good, the cinematography is good, the acting is good, the characters are good, the story is good (sad but good) and the music is top notch. Maybe you have to have been a musician, or done some ocean traveling, or both, to enjoy this movie, the piano duel makes it worthwhile.",1478131200,,632,4.275

Tim Roth was amazing. Clarence Williams was utterly fantastic as Jelly Roll Morton. I thought after ""Mod Squad"" he was a goner. He really showed his chops in this movie and brought a lot to the party. I had hoped, that after what he accomplished here, we'd see more of him, he was so good.",1474416000,,463,4.523809523809524

Without giving too much away, it is a really great story of a man that was born on a cruise ship and grows up never touching foot on land. The man was born with a talent for piano and plays with the cruise ship orchestra. His story is told through his trumpet playing friend who is pawning his trumpet, eventually his friend learns the grave mistake of pawning his instrument and there is a surprise ending.",1458518400,,508,4.3578947368421055

1349921,4,B00004TBUH,"This is a movie that viewers tend to either love or hate with a passion. Being a musician I love the musical theme. While it is an English speaking film, it definitely has an Italian flavour, again something that tends to polarise viewers. The story is a form of modern fable, told in a larger than life style. If you can get past these three elements, you'll get hooked from the very first and the film will take you on an amazing journey. I adore this film and would dearly love to see the original length cut at 200+ minutes. This theatrical release omits chapters rather than essential story elements, so there's no loss of dynamic at 125 minutes. Tim Roth is brilliant and is ably supported by a solid supporting cast and fascinating production, sound and editing. I won't spoil the storyline so take the plunge and the voyage. It is really worth it.",1457740800,5,855,4.52258064516129

He was adopted and raised by the engine room crew and grew to become a world class pianist during the early 1900s.  But he couldn't get himself to leave the ship even for love.  The story of his life is told retrospectively by a trumpet player down on his luck later in life, and the music is stunning.

1349957,5,B00004TBUH,"So much happening in this film that it requires countless viewings to begin to understand all of the nuances being offered.  Being a piano player, I was astounded by the absolutely beautiful music and the seamless way in which it was presented.  The segment that portrays a duel between Jelly Roll Morton and 1900 is unforgettable.  There have been many interpretations of what this movie is about.  Basically, I think the moral of this tale is that most people live on their own ship for their entire life, fearful to get off because of the uncertainty of leaving what is familiar and known for limitless choices. The thing is that 1900 makes a conscious decision to go down with the ship because he knows that if he leaves he will never be able to hear and play his music again, which he eloquently talks about at the end of the film.  I had to watch this movie several times to fully hear and understand what 1900 was saying and why, for him, staying on the ship was really the only choice he could make.  This is a movie I will come back to revisit often and highly recommend.",1426982400,,1080,4.429292929292929

The movie starts out in a pawn shop in Britain. The customer, a former ship's musician stumbles across an old trumpet and an old 78 recording. He begins to tell the pawn shop owner the story behind the trumpet and recording.
In 1900 a new born baby is abandoned aboard a luxury liner. The infant is discovered by the ship's crew. For some reason the crew decides to keep and raise the infant. As the child grows it turns out that the child is a musical prodigy with the piano. There is an incredible piano duel between Tim Roth and Clarence Williams the 3rd.

They all play well, except this one, which would not play (gave me a region error message) no matter what I did. Had to return it, and I'll have to wait for a blu-ray released for US consumption. I HATE giving this one star, but please note it's one star because it wouldn't play, even in a region-free machine, NOT because of the film -- it's a 5-star film from the wonderful mind of Guiseppi Tournatore, creator of CINEMA PARADISO, EVERYBODY'S FINE, and several other terrific films.

1350017,5,B00004TBUH,"I've seen so many movies in my lifetime (60+ years) that when something comes along that totally surprises me, positively, it's cause for celebration! To quote the character Max, ""You're never really done for, as long as you've got a good story, and someone to tell it to."" What a story!  Danny Boodman T.D. Lemon 1900 (how he get's  the name is just one of the film's many treats) is a remarkable character, who was an abandoned baby left on a cruise ship, adopted and raised by a coal stoker in the engine room , and who grows up to become the most remarkable, self-taught pianist the world has ever known. I won't tell you anymore-you have to discover this gem by yourself!
Back in 1975, Robert Altman directed a film called NASHVILLE - one of the poster taglines for the movie was ""The damnedest thing you ever saw!""  That would be perfect, for this remarkable film!
By the way, part of the title for this review refers to a personal philosophy of the main character. You'll understand when you see it.",1404000000,,1006,4.516483516483516
1350018,5,B00004TBUH,"Always the Tim Roth fan I managed to view this movie at a friends house and was simply astounded. Not only is Tim Roth one of the worlds greatest actor I remain curios as to whether the man can actually play a role that is poorly done. So far that answer is simply, ""no"".
The Legend of 1900 simply floored me. Great story line which I will not ruin for anyone in this review. Just please, take my word for it and either purchase a new copy or a good used one and watch it. I guarantee it will not be the last time you view the film so I do recommend purchasing a copy either in digital format through Amazons Online movie collection or as a DVD (or Blu Ray if its available).
The story is once again up to the incredible talent that Tim Roth posesses and the pairing of the two makes for a movie that you will simply never forget. It may not be up there with your first time having sex but I do guarantee that you will never forget this film, its acting (and not only by Mr. Roth but the entire cast simply excells). If you ever get trapped into ""having"" to what your wife would  consider to be a ""chick flick"", you will make her (and yourself), extremely happy by chosing this movie to watch with your significant other.
In short, this is one of the finest movies I have ever seen in every aspect. If you need another Tim Roth movie to watch under the same potentially ""slit your wrist because you have to watch a chick flick movie"", Mr. Roth has a smaller role in another movie called I believe ""Beautiful Country"" (might be wrong but I think its the only pairing of Mr. Roth and Nick Nolte. Again, Mr. Roths role in the latter movie is much smaller than his lead in The Legend of 1900 but once again his performance like every performance I have seen the man in is unforgettable. Always complicated, multi layered and outstanding. If there was a Beethoven in the acting world, Tim Roth may be that much of a true artist at his particular craft.",1403740800,,1947,4.233870967741935

Through his incredible ear he was able to recreate any musical piece he heard and his talent surpassed that of the best musicians of his day.

1350058,4,B00004TBUH,"This is one of those movies that you shouldn't watch before bedtime because it was just too profound.  It was also kind of unbelievable that someone could be born on a cruise line, left behind, and be raised by employees.  At some point someone would intervene and take pity on a poor waif like 1900, but alas, it didn't happen.  It was an amazing story, nevertheless as we see the unfolding of the life of a man who becomes a celebrity on board ship because he is a talented pianist.  None of the music he plays is anything anyone has ever heard--it's all his own!  He is even challenged by the very notable Jelly Roll Morton, probably the greatest jazz and ragtime piano player of that time.  1900 also has the special talent of being able to read people which is kind of interesting because he really hasn't had many personal relationships in a life where his whole world view is from a ship.  He knows which people are stowaways, are potential criminals, have something to hide, and no one is the wiser.  Tim Roth really shines in this role and makes the character come alive.  His good and only friend, Max, played by Pruitt Taylor Vince acts as the narrator in this film and he plays an itinerant musician down on his luck very well.

One of the best parts of this movie is the music of the jazz age and the dancing that goes on.  There are some humorous parts also as we see 1900 learning to read by looking at racing forms.  There's also the scene with Jelly Roll, played by Clarence Williams III which is pretty funny.  But the rest of the movie kind of left me feeling sad as I saw a man who because of his whole life being spent on the ocean could somehow not ever be able to find contentment in a landlocked environment.",1370476800,2,1732,4.341614906832298

I saw 1900 (not in its entirely) on TV and loved the movie.  I kept checking to see when it would be shown again so I could record it.  Finally I ordered it and was anxious to watch it and then have some friends over to watch it.

After watching it, I can't invite my friends.  I had to keep turning the volume up and down.  It was often so difficult to hear the dialogue and I would turn it up, then the background music/sounds would overpower the voices and be very loud and I'd turn it back down.  I missed some things because I couldn't understand what they were saying.  The mixing was terrible.  I agree with my husband, who has a music studio and knows all about mixing.

Is this a quirk in a few DVDs or all they all like this?  Also, is there an edited version without so much cussing?  I don't remember all of that in the TV version.",1359763200,,913,4.125

It was overlooked by many major awards ceremonies but should be in every video collectors' collection, as it's one of the best movies ever made, and I don't say that lightly. Tim Roth leads a stellar ensemble cast who bring this movie to life. Great cinematography, great story, great sound, great music, just a terrific movie all around that no matter how many times myself, or my friends watch it, we never tire of the movie. It's one of those classics that stay with you. After watching it, I immediately ordered the soundtrack and have never been dissatisfied.

But when I saw the movie I was just blown away how well done it was.  Only problem I had was that the first one I ordered had some kind of interference that caused it to go from B&W to color, almost like the old VHS stop-copy interference.  I think that it was the company in Ontario.  The second one we ordered was no problem.  Every one that I recommended it to felt the same way I did about the movie.",1352419200,,632,4.181818181818182
1350084,5,B00004TBUH,The Legend of 1900 is a very different story than what we are used to seeing. It might even be original.  It is about a child born on a cruise ship in the early 1900's who is left abandoned.  He is raised by a ship employee and becomes a prodigal piano player.  Some of the cinematography is stunning.  My favorite part is when the ship goes through a storm and he starts playing his piano and unhooks the piano wheels so he can become mobile.  I really enjoyed this film and have no regrets about the purchase.  I am now sharing it with all of my friends.,1351123200,,556,4.149532710280374

extremely entertaining (musically) the story is gripping. I won't bore you with the story line, a hundred others
have already done that... however, I will say that this movie is so refreshing, so different and very very touching that
you can hardly walk away without thinking about it for days!  Yes, I actually wondered if something this bizzard
and yet beautiful could ever happen to someone? Tim Roth is perfect in this part and the movie never lets you be
bored. If there is a top ten for unusually unique films with a great story this has to be in the top ten! You will

Writen and directed by Giuseppe Tornatore from Italy with an American and English based cast of actors, it's cinematography, superb acting and beautifully scripted storyline, its an intelligent film that leaves you spellbound.

I read numerous reviews on Amazon with regards to this film before buying it, and as one customer previously wrote...""I remember having a guest over one evening who was seeing it for the very first time. His reaction (after wiping a tear from his eye) was to exclaim ""what a wonderful movie! How did anyone even get a film that quirky made?"" There is no Hollywood 'formula' to this film. It proceeds without any of the usual conventions: no good guy vs. bad guy struggles, no sex, no violence, and no crude jokes. It is like that really good book that you start reading one night when it is already too late but are unable to put down until you have turned the last page""...

1350095,4,B00004TBUH,"I had been wanting to add this movie to my collection for a few years now.  This has a great fairy-tale type story line.  After reading some of the low-star reviews it sounds as if some people just haven't developed a stronger appreciation for original plots.  It's not a story about the Titanic, we have already seen and heard of that one.  This is an original idea that most with open and deeper understanding minds will surely appreciate.

The minor warning that I have is something that I overlooked and could only be disappointed in myself; is that the cover and on-screen instructions for the movie is NOT in English.  Luckily, the voices are in English and with a little luck, I was able to play the movie without the subtitles at the bottom which were in another language.  Wish I would have studied the ad a little further to realize that I was buying a copy in another language other than English.  Still a great film!!",1327363200,,929,4.520958083832335
1350096,5,B00004TBUH,"This is a very good movie about one of the best books I have ever read. I wold go as far as saying it helped me understand the meaning of life! Novecento, toward the end of the movie, talks about how a keyboard is finite, it only has 88 keys, but the music one can play with it is infinite. So is life: one has a finite number of years to live (a number that is more or less the same as the number of keys on a piano!) but one has infinite possibilities on how to life those years.

And it is just as well that it is so, it would be impossible to live an infinite life, just as it would be impossible to play music on a keyboard with an infinite number of keys. Only God, 1900 tells us, can play on such a keyboard. Very deep, even if you don't believe in God",1325548800,,759,3.8343949044585988

Over the years, at some time or another, it would play on one of the hundreds of TV stations I get on my satellite service and we would ALWAYS stop and watch it, to the end...it's so compelling. You have a real affinity for this man,(played by Tim Roth) who was born on the ship to an immigrant mother but left behind to be raised by the crew...and then never having any reason to leave the ship he didn't! Turns out he was quite the prodigy on the piano and played his own wonderful music with (and without regard to) the in-house bands!

The costuming, the colors, the story, and, of course, the music all transport you to a magnificent otherworld where you not only understand why 1900 never sets foot on dry land but you want to join him and live your life in his perfectly splended world of water, beautiful people and music. I was totally carried away on waves of delight and wonder for the entiregty of the movie.  It is truly enchanting to those who can appreciate quality entertainment that relies on consumate acting, well-written dialogue, a truly compelling story and some of the most beautiful music I have ever had the pleasure of sharing.

1350110,5,B00004TBUH,"To reality I go not...for 'tis here I choose to remain. Nuances of The Eagle's Gift (Carlos Casteneda) and the tonal come to mind as this landless nagual chooses to remain where HE wants to be, at risk of the lure of fame, loveliness, fortune and the expansive and endless world. It took me over 30 years to experience reality beyond the traditions, icons and allegations of duality, and to hear its call drawing me away to reality's loving embrace. And as I partook of its gentleness, and longed to share it with the world, I found myself intentionally pausing on my own gangplank, just two steps away. I had to admit that despite its obvious shortcomings and disappointments, I wanted this world where the keyboard is quite finite...for it is here that my joy finds expression, and makes my longing heart sing and soar. Whether it is Carlitos taking the courage in hand to leap from the pinnacle in hopes of assembling a new world before reaching the ultimate disaster below, or is perhaps 1900 facing...not a tragic end, but the loving acceptance of all he and his world mean to him personally. I have never read anything by Alessandro Baricco, nor heard of him before today. And judging then by the movie alone...it is not merely quirky, eccentric, or compelling. It is indeed a masterpiece, in flavor not unlike the Call of the Wild (Jack London) versus the sanity of survival. As el matadore...1900 faces ""his"" world head on, rather than spending his soul on an alluring tomorrow's world. Where indeed can I dwell, but here in my own heart?",1290988800,,1546,4.6875

Truly, The Legend is a 1900 is one of the most beautiful and moving films in modern film history, an overlooked classic, and a tribute to the Piano in every sense of the word.

Danny Boodmann T.D. Lemon 1900 was found orphaned, most likely born to and forgotten by immigrant parents, aboard the Virginian a luxury steamliner much like the Titanic, by a steam room worker. He took in the child as his own and named him Danny Boodmann (After himself) T.D. Lemon (After the advertisement on the box he was found in) 1900 (After the year he was found in). He is a man without a birthday, he is a man without a country, he is a man born to The Virginian. 1900 proceeds to live out his childhood in the ship, learning about the world and the languages of the passengers until one day, the crew discovers he's a piano virtuoso, and soon after that, he becomes part of the ships orchestra, as word of his talent is spread by anybody that has ever heard him. Occasionally, the film also flashes forward to around 1945, where The Virginian is being prepped to be scrapped after World War 2, but with 1900 still aboard, and his friend Max's efforts to get him off.

Being the only English-language film of the Italian filmmaker Giuseppe Tornatore, the film is incredibly beautiful to look at. The striking beauty of the ship is one of the most stunning aspects, choosing to accent backdrops and provide a unique setting for the proceedings. The cinematography of the film is so well-done, as is with the rest of the film, I'm very disappointed that this was Tornatore's only English work, since his use of the language of the film is also very well done, considering most of the crew, including the screenwriters I believe, were Italian. But not only is the film striking as a whole, there's just so many memorable scenes in here that are simply brilliant in the way they are composed and played out. And what do all but two of these 7 or 8 scenes that stick out in my mind have in common? All of them involve the piano. I'm not a big fan of classical music by any means, but the instrumental works, and the way they're shown on screen is unequivocally magnificent. Composed mostly by Ennio Morricone, this is truly one of the aspects that makes the film stand out for me.

Tim Roth leads out the cast played by relative unknowns to my mind, and he gives the performance of a career. After watching this film, I came out with a great deal of respect for Roth as he displayed acting talent I didn't even know he was capable of. He sells every aspect of 1900 perfectly. Whether it's the humorous side of the character, the quite side, the peaceful side, the cursing side, the romantic side, or the speech-making side, Roth makes you invested in the character, as if the character development in the movie weren't enough. I don't know if Roth actually learned to play the piano for this movie, but he sold me on that too. Pruitt Taylor Vince also plays the character of Max well, and even though he isn't asked to do all that much, he did a fine job portraying his lifelong friendship with 1900.

I don't want to use the word ""beautiful"" too much in this review, but it aptly describes this movie. Some have called it epic, but it's only epic in its emotions. This movie will valiantly attempt to bring tears to your eyes, laughter, and everything in between. There's a particular scene where 1900 comes to accept his fate the only way he knows how, by playing the piano. But in this scene, there is no piano to play, so he plays air piano. But instead of cheesy, it's touching. There's no words needed to tell the audience the gravity of this scene and this moment, but you feel it. And that's what a movie should do. It should make you feel. It's only a couple hours long, but those couple of hours were all that I needed to be turned into an emotional wreak.",1278115200,2,4176,4.426527958387516
1350117,5,B00004TBUH,"The Legend of 1900 is an amazing film about a man who was born on a cruise ship in 1900, and never set foot on land. Abandoned as a newborn in the ballroom of the ship, 1900 is found, adopted, and given his name by a crewman. One night in his childhood, he is discovered playing the piano in the ballroom by the captain and astonished guest. Why astonished? Because he's a prodigy.

The film is narrated by 1900's friend, Max, a trumpet player who meets him on the night the ship is being tossed around by a storm. Max is seasick as hell, and 1900 helps him through. Max and 1900 become fast friends, and the film flashes back and forth in time during Max's narration, from Max's present, at the port where the now-ancient ship is rusty and ready for demolition, and the ship's heyday. We watch 1900 as a true musician; he's a man who just loves playing piano for everyone, rich or poor. We also see him through the eyes of the passengers he meets.

The score is beautiful and haunting, with a touch of aching nostalgia thrown in for good measure. I have the soundtrack on my wish list!

This is the oddball life of ""1900"", the title character, played very well by Tim Roth. He becomes a word of mouth draw for transatlantic travelers, such that even the self-described 'worlds greatest piano player' AKA Jelly Roll Morton, must come and see him...just to KNOW who's best.

1350123,4,B00004TBUH,"This was my first introduction to Tim Roth, and now I own most of his DVDs.  He is an actor's actor and I loved his directorial debut ""the War Zone"" and am presently reading the book by Alexander Stuart.

I don't wish to give away the ending, bit I thought he was marvelous.  His humble beginnings began at sea (the Atlantic ocean) where he was abandoned and raised by the crew aboard.  He was a child prodigy, whereas, at about the age of 7 or 8 walked over to the piano and started playing ""magically"" as a professional musician, music that was alive in his head.  As he became a grown man, he played nightly, to the guest's amazement.  He would also entertain those less fortunate in steerage.

He was kind, empathetic, sincere, intelligent and witty.  I personally, fell in love with his character and wish this would have been a  book, so I could have really gotten into his heart, soul and mind.

He bonded and had a great friendship and rapport with the actor who played the trumpet in the band.  He seemed to appreciate his music and the man he was, more than anyone.  His life was sadly, lonely and sort of out of touch with ""reality"", in the terms of life on land.  The only life which was familiar and ""real to him' was life aboard an ocean liner.

Unfortunately, I am having trouble, putting into words  all the emotion in the movie.  It was extremely moving and I found it surprising, that is didn't receive the credit it deserved.  I still, think of it often and find it so very moving and wish I could have known a person as the character he portrayed.

By the the way, I own the CD. which is available through Amazon.  I have viewed it numerous times and am still intrigued by it.",1252886400,,1696,4.343949044585988
1350124,3,B00004TBUH,"The only reason I give this movie 3 stars is because the music, its very good. Ennio Morricone composes another masterpiece! This is a surface level film, looks good but nothing happening underneath. Its almost like the movie was a vehicle for the terrific music. Makes we wonder if the music came 1st...

Besides the music the characters are weak and have little depth. Why is it the supporting actor, a trumpet playing best friend, despite being about the same age as 1900 (24) acts like some wise sage when lecturing to him at times?? Also the supporting actor's acting is a bit...transparent... His character if given more screen time would of been really annoying. The plot is simple, but thats fine, most of the best movies have a simple plot. Some people are upset by the ending, but it works and makes sense to me. I suppose I must mention the racial angle which also angered some viewers. I to rolled my eyes when he defeats Jelly-Roll, who I seriously doubt was so extravagant and wealthy due to his exploitation by the white music business owner's system. I also doubt they would let him enter and leave using the main ship exit. Such neglect of historical fact and accuracy is slightly insulting.

In closing, if I were to ever watch this movie again it would be for the music, which makes me think seriously of going ahead and buying the soundtrack now to spare myself of the trite film.",1248134400,,1400,4.596
1350125,5,B00004TBUH,"Since most of what needs to be said about this fine movie has already been said, I'll just give one example of why some professional critics who panned it just don't get it, not only in their dismissals of it as treacle in general (hey, we're too fashionably jaded for this!), but in the details.

From Stephen Holden's review in the NY Times--

""In the film's dramatic climax, Jelly Roll Morton (Clarence Williams 3d), who has heard rumors of Nineteen Hundred's genius, books a passage on the Virginian specifically to challenge him to a piano duel. But the piece (composed by Ennio Morricone) with which Nineteen Hundred defeats Morton is a whirling, twirling, fussy, ''Flight of the Bumblebee''-like finger-flying exhibition that has velocity but little coherence. It is no match artistically for Morton's propulsive meat-and-potatoes jazz.""

Yep, Jelly Roll Morton was one of the greatest pianists of all time (and by all accounts just as much of a colossal jerk as portrayed in the film), though I doubt he would've been pleased by Holden's description of his music as ""meat-and-potatoes jazz.""

But Holden has no clue about what audiences expect, even demand, in such musical competitions-- head cutting contests, in jazz and blues jargon. They want exactly what 1900 gives them, a display of technique for the sake of technique. Artistry? Give me a break.

Ennio Morricone gets this. 1900 gets it. And you can bet Jelly Roll Morton himself, the real one, got it. Stephen Holden doesn't. He's the kind of guy who is overawed by the glories of REAL JAZZ.

You want to win a head cutting contest? How many notes can you play in one minute? How cleanly can you play them? Audiences eat this stuff up. 1900 understands this. He doesn't want to cut heads with Morton at all, and tries to avoid it until Morton ups the ante beyond recall.

""And eff jazz, too!""",1245888000,2,1860,4.8119122257053295
1350126,4,B00004TBUH,"""The Legend of 1900"" is one of my keepers. It is an unusual movie with some fantastic music. I especially enjoyed the piano duel between the main character T.D. Lemon, ""1900,"" played by Tim Roth, and ""Jelly Roll"" Morton, played by Clarence Williams III. This scene alone is worth the price of the movie--and then some.

The story has a decidedly Italian flavor or style, given it by writer and director, Giuseppe Tornatore, which adds to its uniqueness. Use of the ""F"" word is one example, but it is used with a special meaning, as if dismissive of all convention. A few other examples: the musical description of various ""odd characters,"" passengers described in music by Lemon; the joy of seeing the Statue of Liberty, by the immigrants who shout joyfully, ""America!""; the philosophical Italian peasant who talks at length with T.D. Lemon, ""1900,"" and then just happens to be the father of the beautiful girl played by Melanie Thierry who appears on a later voyage. The hauntingly beautiful piano tune Lemon creates after seeing the girl. All these things and more, give the movie its unique quality.

But as a whole, for me, there was a major flaw. The story was a tragedy but there was no need for it to be. The Tim Roth character had enough internal fortitude and a great talent to make it anywhere; and after meeting the girl, he was inspired to do so, to take the next step in his life and leave the ship. Instead he exhibited cowardice at the last moment, and for no good reason I could see. A very disappointing and unnecessary ending.",1244937600,2,1544,4.631386861313868

1350129,5,B00004TBUH,"1900, saw the world pass him by, 2000 people at a time.  In the middle of all that, he bucked the conventions from the moment he was found in a T.D Lemon box on a grand Piano. His grand piano.  The movie starts after the second world war where a Trumpet player goes to sell his trumpet, then plays it one last time.  Thus starting the story of 1900, spinning a true yarn with the shop owner about the song, a the broken and mended master record.
1900, is deep down a lively story, that shows us a path from childhood to adult hood.  the gang plank and land he fears so much, is really growing up and leaving all you know for certian and going into the uncertian future of adulthood.
He's an adult, 1900, with the childlike frankness and intuition of a child, and the piano playing skills to make him the best kept secret, ever.

possibly the most brilliant movie, and each person depending upon their life's background, understand it, and get a different 'message' or way of thinking of 1900 then the next one.  we're all 1900...most of us with out awesome piano proweress...or a huge ship to sail in.  *sigh* lucky man.",1241222400,2,1120,4.381642512077295

The movie is definitely unique, about a man who spends his entire life on board an ocean liner and is a fantastic piano player. The best thing about this film, to me at least, was not the story- which I did enjoy - but the cinematography. Wow, what a great-looking film. Speaking of looks, Melanie Thierry is gorgeous. Too bad she has only a small part in this movie.

It was nice to see Tim Roth play something other than a detestable villain and Clarence Williams was fun as the arrogant ""Jelly Roll Morton,"" who comes aboard ship to challenge Roth to a piano duel, which has to be seen to be believed.

This was filmed by the same man who did the much more well-known Italian film, ""Cinema Paradiso,"" and if you appreciate how good-looking that film is, well, this is even better!",1231977600,3,1069,4.35678391959799
1350133,2,B00004TBUH,"This is an interesting, entertaining movie in many respects, and certainly the acting is excellent.  What stands out to me, however, is that this is a kind of ""great white hope"" story.  The character ""1900"" (Tim Roth) is sui generis--a unique oceanic human that is born, lives, and dies on an ocean liner without ever setting foot on land.  Of course, he is the offspring of an unknown European immigrant mother, who abandoned him; notwithstanding his de facto adoptive black father (Bill Nunn), ""1900"" he still represents Eurocentric values and attitudes.

Like Sylvester Stallone's ""Rocky,"" Giuseppe Tornatore's ""1900"" is a fictional character whose greatness is ultimately measured by his ability to beat the black champion.  In Rocky's case, of course, the opponent-champion, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers)was also a fictional character.  But it doesn't take a doctorate to see that Creed's character represented the reality of heavyweight championship fighting being dominated by black fighters.  ""Rocky II"" (the come-back episode where Rocky beats Creed) was necessarily birthed out of the white psyche's need to justify themselves as the necessary center of western society.

Tornatore's story of the oceanic keyboard player, which is supposed to be based upon another Italian theatrical production, is pretty much the same kind of story when viewed from the lens of ""race"" and racism.  Tornatore's ""1900"" is also the white upstart facing a black champion, except the contest is musical, though hardly less combative.  Of course, in contrast to Apollo Creed, Tornatore's ""great white hope"" faces off against a real historical figure, and a giant in the annals of African American music, Ferdinand ""Jelly Roll"" Morton (1890-1941).  In one of the most dramatic moments of the movie, Roth's ""1900"" hesitantly faces off with an arrogant but brilliant Morton (Clarence Williams III) [Roth and Williams were also co-stars in ""Bumpy Johnson""].  At first ""1900"" only dabbles at the keys, showing respect to the great black master (the narrator is sure to tell us that Morton's greatness lies in the fact that he invented a music that could be played in whorehouses with much success).  Then ""1900"" reproduces Morton's brilliant playing like a virtual recording, further infuriating his black opponent.  In the last round of their musical competition, ""1900"" unleashes his master-race abilities at the piano, and humiliates Morton by almost literally burning up the keys.  As if that weren't enough, Tornotare has ""1900"" smarting off as the defeated Morton quietly slips off the boat at port.  ""F--k Jazz,"" says ""1900.""

""The Legend of 1900"" is ultimately a tale of white-racial oneupmanship more than it is a story about music and musicians, or about a man who is afraid to live on land because it seems endless and mind-boggling to him.  Nor is it just a fantasy about a white super-musician who can exceed and excel the great classical music tradition of the U.S.A., Jazz.  At its fullest, it is a story that illustrates the white man's belief that no matter how brilliant and powerful the contributions of his black fellow man, white people's music--like everything else in the construct of western culture--affirms white-centeredness, even white supremacy.

It is no surprise that such a figure as the stubborn ""1900"" must be blown up at the end of the story, dying with the only ocean home he knew.  This is where the parallel between ""1900"" and ""Rocky"" ends.  The ""Italian Stallion"" series continued, probably because the majority psyche of the U.S.A. is much more desperately in need of a ""great white hope,"" and much more likely to market them to the point of absurdity.  On the other hand, Tornatore understands that to perfect his  white ""legend,"" he must blow him up at the end--kill him off quickly so that the character ""1900"" can transcend (escape) Tornatore's disingenous and disrespectful use of the real genius of ""Jelly Roll"" Morton.  ""1900"" is not only a ""legend,"" he is a fake legend, and if anyone deserves to be dismissed with the ""f-word,"" it's him.  Unlike Morton, he never existed.  What really exists, however, is a pervasive mentality among too many whites (but not all of them!)which requires them to feel themselves superior and to dismiss dark humanity and its great contributions as secondary to their own.",1220572800,2,4334,5.136752136752137

It was an immensely unsuccessful movie in U.S unlike the other Tornatore movie ,i.e Cinema Paradiso. I pondered the reason why it was not only unpopular but also received such a mixed bag of reviews from critics ,then concluded that it is because of the huge difference of emotional receptiveness between U.S viewers and those of rest of the world. In addition to that, to majority of viwers, the movie's almost mawkish sentiment might be more than over the top as well as the larger than life character of 1900 seems to be quite unreal. Yet, as the cover of DVD says it is a fable , not realistic quotidian drama. In spite of its dismal performance in the U.S movie market,fortunately, it earned  such as cult status among its royal fans. It deserves its ""cult"" status though ,for acting , cinematography, and message it tries to convey is more than those of 2 or 3 star movies.

This movie is very nostalgic one that make viewers look back the last century through the life of very fictional character named 1900( originally his name is Danny Boodman T.D Lemon 1900 after a stocker who became his surrogate father) who is born and died on the ship called ""Virginan"" and never set his food in land. 1900 is a some sort of Piano virtuos who can express the change of his emotion by the dint of playing the instrument. He and Max, through his narration movie progresses, meet by chance and subsequently there is very memorable scene that clearly cements their friendship. What truly superb about this movie is its wonderful soundtrack and cinematography.

At first it might seem a bit slow, but the film script is a well planned poem that stretches over two hours of pure artistic magic.

It is warm, funny , intellegent and so much more.....

You may think this is a one sided point of view but i'm in fact a massive science fiction and adventure movie fan so this review can be trusted.

The piano duel scene is one of the best scenes of cinema i have ever seen and Tim Roth is brilliant.

Enjoy!!!

1350147,4,B00004TBUH,"Legend of 1900 (1998), directed by Giuseppe Tornatore

Tornatore favors dreamers. Here he depicts the travelers to America, in a liner full of immigrants from various parts of Europe. They arrive, get ecstatic to see the Statue of Liberty, America is in sight. But not all of them get out. A baby is born there--in 1900--and never leaves the ship. He is a gifted musician, plays the piano and composes original and exciting music, and his sidekick who plays the trumpet urges him to get out and visit New York. He stays in the ship until it blown to pieces. Tim Roth is superb as the alienated man who finds in music and the piano keys a sort of infinity which gives him all the space he requires. Whether this is a metaphor for musical eternity, or self-sufficiency, we do not know. Stylistically glamorous, the movie offers generous soundtrack music, reminding somewhat of Being There, with Peter Sellers, a man who only lived in a garden and learned life by watching TV. A sort of modern Gregor Samsa, Tim Roth, nicknamed 1900, achieves a self-willed immortality by denying any other existence but that of the self. The piano has only a definite number of notes, but its music can achieve infinity. A human being that does not need the external world. And an America on which he never sets foot, for the infinitude inside him suffices. The ship, eventually a useless wreck, is blown up, and he with it. Incidentally, by missing America, he also missed the girl, the only thing he really wanted, but lost when she left the ship. She had understood his music. But she too is absorbed by this alien world.",1196035200,,1605,4.631578947368421
1350148,5,B00004TBUH,"This is the European release of ""The Legend of 1900"" and is an absolute must see movie.  Trust me, this is something you have to OWN because it's compulsive viewing that requires watching over and over again and be delighted to find new things each time afresh.

This is not a romantic love story that some reviewers had us believed.  The strength of the story lies in the human journey of life, the poetic script and the delivery of lines, the hauntingly beautiful music and cinematography, the strong acting of a fine cast, the thoughtful production and vision of the director- all the elements we come to appreciate in European films as opposed to the pedestrian Hollywood box office stuff.  It's an Italian production directed by Giuseppe Tornatore and made in Rome.

Tim Roth shines.  Don't miss his stunning performance.

The story begins with the touching scene of Max, a down and out talented musician selling his trumpet at a pawn shop for next to nothing to buy a decent meal.  He begged to play his trumpet one last time and began to play the music created by a ""nameless"" pianist known as 1900.  The indifferent pawnbroker was at once moved by the music and curious about the story behind.

Max reminisced the past on how he got to know 1900 when he played on the luxurious ocean liner, Virginian.  His first meeting with 1900 is absolutely mesmerising.  He was so sea sick that 1900 showed him the way to cure his misery- the now famous piano ride scene- with 1900 playing magical music on a moving grand piano(with brakes taken off).  It's an amazingly breathtaking scene that completely captivates the audience with the piano surging backward and forward to the rhythm of the rough sea, crashing everything in the way and landing them in trouble with the ship captain.  While being punished to shovel coal in the engine room, 1900's story was told.

He was a newborn foundling in a lemon box on top of a grand piano in the first class cabin discovered by an engine room coal stoker.  Hardship and harshness of life had not diminished his kindness of heart and yearning for love so he raised the boy to avoid the boy's doomed fate of an orphanage.

Audience will be moved and enjoy how 1900 still talked about people would be locked up in an orphanage if they don't have children as his adoptive father told him once in jest when he was little. This is 1900's own quiet way of coping with his private grief and keeping his adoptive father's memory alive.

He was born to make music on the piano with magical fingers which impressed the ship captain and others so much that he was allowed to stay on board to entertain after his adoptive father died in an engine room accident and was adored by all.  But there would be lonely moments when he and his music were left abandoned by the adoring crowd after the ship docked and passengers flocked ashore to their respective lives and then he was all alone again with his piano.

1900 knew little beyond the confines of the ship and was innocent and naive of the ways of the world.  His communication and interaction with people were through his music which he created instinctively to express himself and in response to his immediate environment through his keen observations of people and the world around him.

Through some lovely and thoughtful piano recital scenes for both first and third class passengers, the director shows us how unaffected 1900 was and how he was totally comfortable mixing with the rich and the poor unconscious of class distinction. He was as relaxed with the rich in his tailed tuxedo in the first class cabin as with the poor immigrants in third class who would utter some incomprehensible notes and asked 1900 to play a tune that reminded them of the home they left behind.  1900 would make magical music just on hearing a tune once, to the delight of the crowd.

The three landmark episodes of his life were played out in the following poignant scenes:-

1) His humble response to the ostentatious King of Jazz's bully and challenge to a piano duel.  Watch out for how they use a cigarette to prove who has the lightest butterfly fingers whilst making the most earth shattering music and how he plays as if he had two pairs of hands.

2)  His gentle, brief yet profound encounter with the girl, a third class passenger, the power of which lies with the director's deliberate intent to leave an indelible mark on the audience through the unsaid, the unspoken and the unrequited love.

3)  His trust and friendhip with Max culminating to the bittersweet ending of the story through his most endearing and enduring soliloquy about his fear of life not so much because of what he saw but what he didn't see- ""Where the whole thing came to an end....how do you just choose one woman, one house, one piece of land to call your own, one landscape to look at.....one way to die.....You don't even know where it all comes to an end......it's a voyage too long, perfume too strong...I can't get off the ship(his reality); at best, I can step off my life...""  This is some powerful stuff that could easily be uttered by anyone of us in our eternal search for our reality and the meaning of life.

This sums up the tragedy that's his and ours.",1185667200,5,5222,4.599784250269687

1350150,5,B00004TBUH,"I feel that many of the reviews here do not get Tornatorrwe. To appreciate this fabulous Italian director is to understand that the plot does not really matter in and of itself. The plot here is simle, if unusual, a boy who is a musical genuis - born and living his whole life on a transatlantic liner in the golden age of translatlantic voyages.

Those looking for a ""period drama"" will be disappointed here. This movie, like many of Tornatorre's films, is a journey through time and human experiences. The film is interlaced with retrospectives back and forth through time, weaved on a canvas of beautiful images - such is the picture of fascinated passangers arriving in America when they see the statue of Liverty or the main character playing a piano which is ""dancing"" in the ballroom of a ship.

This movie is a rich poetic and artistic exerience for those who are willing to take the journey. The music of Enio Morricone is wanderful, the performances are impressive and the experience memorable.

Gen on the ship and enjoy the journey!

p.s. for those who like the movie, I recommend other Tornatorre/Moricone features, such as ""Malena"" and, of course ""Cinema Paradiso""",1184544000,2,1178,4.816831683168317

The music played in this movie are amazing with classical and Jazz music; Ennio Morricone and Amedeo Tommasi composed some great pieces in this one with some very lovely and intimate songs like Playing Love, Magic Waltz, Danny Blues & A Mozart Reincarnated (similar to Mozart's Piano Sonata No 11 in A Major K331 <same song played in Jet Li's Unleased, which is also a great meaningful movie with the theme of ""Music Saves Lives"">). You have to buy the sound track and enjoy the music (recommend buying the Italian version because it has more songs). Anyway, the movie is quiet buy very nice; kind of sad at the end but a person who truly understands art won't mind sadness as much. This movie also introduces the Jazz legend Jelly Roll Morton with some of his very awesome songs like the Crave and Fingerbreaker. This movie really got me interested in Jazz piano. Tim Roth, the main charater, performed a great role in this movie; one of his best. He also fakes playing the piano really well. I heard that it took him 6 months to learn how to fake playing piano.

Forget the story line. The music tells the story.  Don't ask me how this happened,  but somehow I first watched this movie without the dialogue.  I could hear glasses tinkle and footsteps, and all the background stuff, but no voices...and oh my goodness...the music! Most enchanting and enthralling of all is the scene where they have decided after all these years, to finally record the main character playing his music.  As fate would have it, it happens on a day when a naturally pretty immigrant girl just happens to catch the eye of the pianist through a porthole, and what emerges from his fingers and the piano keys is one of the most poignantly romantic pieces of music to touch the hardest of hearts anyone has ever heard! You  can tell just what he must be feeling just from the sound of the music. (I replayed this part over and over several times the first time I saw this movie).  This film is one of those that you are likely to feel skeptical about at first, but will turn out to be one that you are ultimately glad you got just because of the feelings and emotions it will invoke in you through the music.  It sort of puts you in the mind of the movie, ""Somewhere In Time"" with Chris Reeve and Jane Seymour with the music of Rachmaninoff, but without as good a story to go with the music.

1350164,5,B00004TBUH,"_The Legend of 1900_ is a film I recommend wholeheartedly to anyone. It is a film about friendship, about knowing yourself, about love, and -- above all -- about art.

It is a film that quietly seeps into your soul and remains there, so that (before the DVD was released) I always jumped at the chance to see it whenever it rarely showed up on cable.

It is a film that continues to elicit my emotions. . .ok, often my tears. . .whenever I view it. The soundtrack adds to the emotional evocation, but also underscores the points of the film: that friendship endures, that backgrounds and stereotypes are thin where true and honest character is concerned, that other-oriented love motivates while self-oriented love (true love) can also instruct; and that art -- into which one can become fully emerged (whether that art is musical or has to do with story-telling) is a force that needs an outlet, must have an outlet -- will be shared. . .eventually.

I teach English at the college level, and share this film with both colleagues and students. It is stunning, both artistically and philosophically. It is a film very much worth viewing and discussing",1120953600,8,1151,4.7164179104477615
1350165,3,B00004TBUH,"This offering from director Giuseppe Tornatore was billed as ""an epic story of a man who could do anything... except be ordinary.""  Tim Roth stars as the title character - the spastic, moody pianist who was born and raised on a ship, and named after the year in which he was found.  He encounters many unique personages on his travels, most notably the story's narrator, Max Tooney (Pruitt Taylor Vince).  The two become fast friends: 1900 teaches Max to find his sea-legs, and Max becomes his most devoted fan.  For 1900 is a piano prodigy.  He plays beautiful music that no one has ever heard before, inspired by the faces of passengers that he sees.  Appropriately, his most gorgeous piece is written when he catches sight of the woman he is destined to love.  There's only one problem: he refuses to set foot on dry land.

The film is, basically, a fantasy.  A grown-up's fairy tale.  Not for a moment do I believe that any of this could ever happen, and neither did all the critics who gave it negative reviews.  This kind of movie is acceptable, perhaps, in Europe.  Not in America.  Our critics demand realism, and their usual beef with any given film is the ""unrealistic"" happenings, or ""plot holes"".  But it's The Legend of 1900 for a reason...it isn't real, and we're not meant to believe that it is.  In order for this type of story to work, the characters must be compelling enough to carry a fantastical tale.  Films like Goldfinger and Ocean's 11 have banked on this before, and we've become used to such hijinks in the action/adventure genre.  But an unbelievable drama?

There's no question that Roth's 1900 is fascinating.  Charmingly neurotic, he endures the ribbing of his friends and enemies with Bogartesque grace.  The character of Max Tooney is meant to be the duller companion to his genius: the Watson to his Holmes, the Robin to his Batman.  Unfortunately Vince's performance leaves something to be desired, and his character is given little to do.  He plays the trumpet well and (reportedly) tells a great story, but he lacks the charisma needed in a sidekick.  When 1900's home ship, The Virginian, is destined to be destroyed, Max embarks on a quest to find 1900 and save him from the explosion.  This search spans the whole film, intercut with flashbacks to the many voyages of Max and 1900.  The ending is predictable.  In fact, each moment in the film is predictable, with one exception.  Almost every single plot point is shamelessly foreshadowed at least once, and I found myself wondering wearily how long it would take to reveal each ""twist"".  Maybe it's the American in me.  I just wanted to see stuff get blown up.

The one truly interesting scene is the ""piano duel"" between 1900 and jazz sensation Jelly Roll Morton (Clarence Williams III).  You find yourself as bewildered by 1900's behavior as are the passengers...what is he doing?  Why?  When will he finally show Jelly Roll who's boss?  In spite of yourself, you really want this strange young sea-bound man to win.  You like him.  What's not to like?

But liking a character isn't always enough to carry a film.  Such is the case here.  In the end, you realize that you never really had any vested interest in 1900 or his fate.  He's interesting to look at, but his magic lasts only as long as his fingers play.

1350167,5,B00004TBUH,"This movie, which reeled me in with its mysterious premise- a baby found abandoned on a ship, who grows into a man who never steps a foot on land- turned out to be spectacular.

First off, the camera work was fabulous, the film sumptuously shot.  This isn't a movie where you bounce from frame to frame.  I love movies that take their time and explore what they've created, not zip through it once lines have been said.  Virtually every shot, every frame has an essence, a feeling, be it gaiety, romance, sadness, etc.  That alone made it a joy to watch.

Tim Roth was fabulous as 1900- those big, thoughtful eyes can convey such emotion.  Though some will sight this movie as being too sad, with a terrible ending, I cannot agree.  The only sadness comes from 1900's predicament- having lived his whole life on a finite ship that finally cultivated a paralyzing fear of the rest of the world.  Other complaints have their merit- the girl for whom 1900 finally tries to get off the boat has really no relationship at all with him, making it odd to take such a big step for someone he hardly knows.  Yet I like to chalk it up to her representing something to him- love, companionship, a home, and a family- even if she isn't the one, she brings up these feelings in him.  There are logical gaps in the movie- where did this baby come from?, why in the world did one of the workers get to keep it?, 1900 could just sit down as a kid and play?, did the boat never go in for repairs, in which case 1900 would have to get off?, how did 1900 manage to survive when it was so decrepit and ready to be blown up?  But the movie is mythical- after all, a legend.  The details melt away in the grander vision of things.  I cannot say that the movie will let you leave feeling good.  It could have ended with 1900 finally getting off- maybe seeing the girl from the boat again somewhere- but it wouldn't have fit.

The movie is just so magical.  I couldn't keep this silly grin off my face when the piano began to spin in the ballroom as the ship rocked and rolled, with 1900 playing- it was perfectly whimsical.  I cheered when 1900 won the piano duel by lighting the cigarette with the strings hot from his playing.  I loved the way he observed people and made up little songs to suit them.  I gasped to hear him say ""F*** the regulations.""  These little things just stick in my head.  Watch this movie.  You won't regret it.",1116892800,2,2415,4.305986696230598

1350170,5,B00004TBUH,"I am always delighted to discover a new Tim Roth film. Like most filmgoers, I first saw this amazing actor flaunting his talent in Quentin Tarentino's ""Reservoir Dogs"" a decade ago. Obviously, I haven't seen every Tim Roth film, but every one that I have seen him in is usually good. Even if the film itself isn't that great, Roth still shines. Consider his small but critical role in Tarentino's ""Pulp Fiction."" With barely any screen time he still managed to contribute something special to the scenes he appeared in. The same goes for Peter Greenaway's ""The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover,"" which I think was Roth's first film role. He showed up in only a couple of scenes, yet stood out in a stellar cast that included Michael Gambon and Helen Mirren. Another great Roth movie is ""Rob Roy,"" where he plays a depraved protg of a character played by John Hurt. Again, this actor easily held his ground. All of this blather brings me to ""Legend of 1900,"" a marvelous picture that shows Tim Roth can do the leading man thing just as easily as he can work in a supporting role. I guess I can understand some people not liking Roth, but I don't understand why they don't like this movie. It's a gem.

Most of the film takes place on one of those luxurious ocean liners so popular as a means of transportation in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. One day, a grunt from the engine room named Danny (Bill Nunn) discovers an abandoned baby in the ship. Not knowing what to do about such a startling find, he decides to keep the little guy and raise him as his own son. With the help of some of his fellow employees, Danny also decides to name the infant 1900 as a tribute to the start of the new century. You would think a young baby on board an ocean liner might draw attention, but Danny keeps 1900 out of sight for years by keeping him in the engine room during work hours and in the sleeping quarters the rest of the time. The ship's crew is so busy dealing with the passengers that they hardly have time to notice one kid wandering around from time to time. But when a young 1900 hears a piano playing in the ship's lounge, he strolls inside for a closer look and ends up playing some tunes for the amazed passengers. When someone notifies the captain, he realizes the profit in having this young prodigy stay on and play the piano for the passengers. After Danny perishes in an accident, 1900 becomes a sort of mascot for the ship as well as its star music attraction. Most importantly, he never leaves the ship.

We learn about the story of 1900 through a series of flashbacks from his best friend and fellow musician Max (Pruitt Taylor Vince). His story positively enthralls the owner of pawnshop to whom Max is attempting to sell his trumpet. For example, when Max first signed up to play with the ship's band, his inability to acquire his sea legs led to long bouts of nausea until 1900 stepped into the picture. He took the trumpet player on a most memorable tour of the lounge--you need to see it to believe it--that miraculously cures his seasickness and turns the two men into fast friends. Max also relates a lengthy story about 1900's duel with legendary musician Jelly Roll Morton (Clarence Williams III). The jazz great, amazed and angered to hear that a white musician on this ship plays the piano better than he does, arrives onboard to show this upstart who is the boss. After a lengthy back and forth battle of the ivories, good old Jelly Roll retreats with his tail between his legs. The story never reaches a wider audience because 1900 won't leave the ship and he won't record his music. His failure to do both of these things, even for the girl he falls in love with (played by Melanie Thierry), leads to obscurity and ultimate doom.

I enjoyed this film. Roth does his usual bang up job as the melancholy yet supremely talented piano player 1900. His monologue delivered to Max towards the end of the film, explaining why he could never find it in his heart to leave the ship, is a wonderful piece of acting. Pruitt Taylor Vince was a good choice to play 1900's best friend and sometime confidant, and he also provides some much needed comic relief when the movie turns serious. The best part of the film, however, has to be the music, which should not come as a surprise considering this is a film where music essentially acts as a co-star. None other than the great Ennio Morricone scored ""Legend of 1900,"" and he did his usual fabulous job. The movie, I think, even won Morricone a Golden Globe award. As good as these elements are, I did have one problem with the movie: the CGI effects. The filmmakers often used computers to create the ship, and they also used them to create a whole city when 1900 makes his lone attempt to leave the boat. You know how there are good CGI and bad CGI effects? ""Legend of 1900"" uses bad CGI. Still, this small difficulty rarely intrudes on the story and does not act as a deterrent to enjoying the film.

I also liked the extras on the DVD if for no other reason than hearing the song Roger Waters composed for the film. Called ""Lost Boys Calling,"" it's always great to hear the former front man for Pink Floyd recording new music. Aside from the music video for this song, the disc offers us a trailer and filmographies. Give this one a shot if you like colorful, introspective European films.",1103414400,29,5381,4.4765784114052956

We can all learn alot from the character 1900, especially in today's chaotic, stress filled society. I thought it was brilliant how he derived his music via visual interpretation of one's demeanor or mood, thus providing him with infinite unique musical masterpieces. He painted musical Michelangelo's on a keyboard and was more than content to remain on a ship, confined within it's walls for his entire life. He valued the quality of his life over the quantity, and in that respect he lived a thousand lifetimes. WATCH THIS MOVIE AND ENJOY!!

1350173,4,B00004TBUH,"There are several interesting metaphors in this film, one of them is that Nineteen Hundred  refused to live  the modernity or pos-modernity of the times, he did not want to live  in the 1900, for he never left the ship. The uncertainty of a life which  can bring daily millions of possible  choices for him was unbearable. His question "" How can you make music out  of an infinite keyboard""?  really represents the fear and anxiety generated by  the enormity of social connections and possibilities, which were made possible through the expansion of Capitalism in the twentieth century. As Bauman puts it: ""Today the problem of identity arises  mostly from  the difficulty of holding to any identity for long. (...) It is not  so much  the co-presence of many kinds that is the source  of confusion  and anxiety, but their fluidity, the notorious difficulty  in pinpointing them and defining - all this  harking back to the most central and painful anxieties: one that is related to  the instability of one's own identity and the absence of lasting, trustworthy  and reliable reference  points which  would help to  render  the identity more safe and secure.""

So, in post-modern times, or in our times, for many people(that's just a part of the world, for at the same time we're post-modern,  we can be pre modern, modern or medieval - anyway that's the part of the world I find myself in),  there can be no end, the number  of  probabilities is infinite depending on your social positions and personal skills. Most of the times we don' t see ourselves  in a position where you can see an end. How do we choose? How must we choose? Those our central questions for many people  nowadays. Once  you're given the possibility of moving, of taking up different professions, in different places, of meeting all kinds of different people this question is a part of our lives.

For Bauman, postmodern discontents are born of freedom, instead of oppression. Society offers more individual freedom at the price of no security and no certainties at all. One of Nineteen Hundred's last lines  is, ""Life passed me by,  while I was on this ship, but 2000 people at a time"". For Umberto Eco, as Bauman quotes him,  that is precisely the reason why so many people  are driven to the entertainment industry of fiction, because there  you can get what you cannot have in  real life, that is, the complexity of life is simplified, the characters and acts  are selected  , "" the infinite chaos of reality is cut down  to an intellectually manageable , comprehensible  and apparently logical size"". So, that was  the  situation  Nineteen Hundred lived when he was  on the ship, and he wasn't willing to give it up.

""Land is a ship too big for me, its music I don't know how to make"". So here  goes the question, how do we  try to make music out of  our daily discontents of chaotic and  apparently purposeless  existence? Do we  really try to get some sense out of it? Do people really care about that  or do they just refuse to discuss it or even to think about it.? If you really face it , the anxiety that comes along is enormous. Numbing our senses is probably the easiest thing to do, which can be easily achieved by any sort of obsessive activity  compelling us to refuse to stop and think about our lives, about other people's suffering, about how our sufferings are interconnected. This way, there's no  time left for any kind of self  or the other's perception.

But still, at least for me, making/listening to music out of this disorder is a challenge. Yes, there can be  music in the world, you just have to listen carefully. I think sometimes the world around me sounds like a  tragic opera, or an Albinoni's Adagio, sometimes like an exciting Rock sometimes like a numbing techno and sometimes I can't really hear anything out of it except confusion and purposelessness. But anyway, those moments go by and  there has to come some music out of it, some hidden order in the chaos. Refusing to believe so would make life unbearable and would truly justify Nineteen Hundred's own-chosen death, exploding with the wrecks of the ship in the end of the movie.",1103068800,7,4147,4.654218533886584

The reason why I love this film so much is flat out for the music.
Tim Roth is amazing too. You really feel for his character. Also this film has some of the most beautiful images as expected with a Tornatore film.

The time comes for him , the piano and his intimate friend , the trumpeter are the only friends he has.
All the story is told in third person, before a seller of old musical instruments and musical scores; I mean a true dialogue between two categories of memories ; the emotional and the historical.
In that sense Tornatore signs his directorial prints on his favorite theme: the memory. That's the clever device of Cinema Paradiso.
But the pianist (in a brilliant performing of this underestimated actor of one million carats talent, Tim Rith), refuses in every decisve moment to leave his own country ship; he belongs to it. He was born there and a invisible link ties him: not even the only love , and mighty inspiration motive for his best composition is capable of make leaving his water home.

1350181,5,B00004TBUH,"I agree with some other reviews I've read above on how some people criticize this movie too easily. I don't think it's necessary to sit down and watch it with some preconcieved idea as to what to expect, rather than just let the movie and the soundtrack seduce you to it's full extent. I believe Guiseppe Tornatore and Ennio Morricone have put together a film that will be referred back to by many generations. It's one of those films that refuses to age in time. The brilliant performance by Tim Roth in an not-so-usual role brings to life 1900, a character so much within us all, representing what he has to say and do in this world through his magnificent piano-playing, (""A light that shines so bright yet for so little time""...taken from blade runner). I haven't the slightest intention of drawing any conclusion for the reviewer of this movie but if your not into great expectations, you'll probably wind up with more than that at the end of the film. My opinion is that the story didn't necessarily need to take place on an ocean liner, it could have been anywhere where 1900 felt safe and secluded from the bustle of the surrounding world but through his greatness as a pianist, he was always bound for fame and glory as well as his inevitablity. I feel it's important to get this point across to those who feel the need to compare this ""insignificant"" aspect with the movie ""Titanic"", yet I would have wished half the musical score in ""Titanic"" this film has. The main character leaves me with the sensation that he's subconsciously set out the task to leave a mark on this Earth while he's never literally set foot on dry ground and that all of us who have strived in our own lives can relate to easily yet again, he leaves an unfinished task to those who haven't.

I watched this movie for the first time, not knowing what to expect.  As the end credits rolled there were tears in my eyes and a smile on my face.  Within a couple weeks I went out and bought a copy of it on DVD.
Anyone I've shared this film with has thoroughly enjoyed it, they watched with no expectations and by the time the end credits were rolling there were smiles on their faces or tears in their eyes.
If a movie can elicit such a strong emotional response, be it positive, or negative it has done its job.  This movie not only did it's job it's kept me coming back for seconds, thirds, and...  well you get the idea.
Tim Roth is brilliant, and while I wasn't a fan of his before this film, I certainly was afterwards.  Knowing he can play vile and venomous (in ""Rob Roy""), quirky and fun (""Rosencrantz & Guildenstern are Dead""), piss and vinegar (""Resevoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"") and then take a turn in an utterly sentimental role truly shows his versatility.

One very important point that neither supporters nor detractors of this movie have mentioned is that it seems to be a metaphor for cinema.
Mind you, it is easily missed, in fact, I can't say for certain it was even intended! But just below the surface lies a resigned nostalgia that suggests the ""greatness"" of cinema is a thing of the past. Like a big old rusted ship about to be consumed by an indifferent ocean, the film implies that cinema is washed-up; the brilliance and splendour it once had has gone, and now it can only aspire to repetitious cycles of dead-in-the-water entertainment's - one lumbering ""Titanic"" after another.
When one considers that Tornatore is the creator of that other over-blown ""paean"" to movies, CINEMA PARADISO, it isn't beyond the realm of possibility to assert that ""cinema"" could be one of his thematic preoccupations. The structure of THE LEGEND OF 1900 (particularly the early scenes) parallels the emergence of film, and given the year of production it's not too much of a stretch to see it as another ""tribute"" to (or comment on) the first 100 years of the medium.
There is a pivotal scene near the end of the film where Max (Pruitt Taylor Vince) searches for the character known as ""1900"" (Tim Roth) within the rusted bowels of the abandoned ship (the wreckage of cinema). 1900 has never been on dry land, and as the ship creaks and groans beneath them, Max hopes to convince him to leave the ship before it is destroyed. He describes the world beyond the vessel as a place of infinite choice, but 1900 replies that he can't abandon the only reality he has ever known. In his heart Max knows that 1900 could never accept the ""sea of anonymity"" (mediocrity) that life on dry land (modern commercial crowd-pleasing movies) promises. Having no place in this world, 1900 (the embodiment of ""true"" art) goes down with the ship (the discarded notion of cinematic art). Perhaps Tornatore is signalling his own intention to go down with it. On the evidence of this film, it's a loss I could live with.
So, did Tornatore intend THE LEGEND OF 1900 as a denunciation of big-budget commercial Euro-puddings, cleverly made in the vacuous style of its worst excesses (criticising the likes of James Cameron's equally wretched TITANIC by emulating it!), or has he simply made a vacuous film? If Tornatore does believe that the glory of cinema has gone, it's highly plausible that he made this film  as a sad celebration of its passing, a ""wake"" of sorts, trailing wistfully behind the phantom ship of the lost glory of movies. (Oh dear, I'm beginning to sound like him!)
But I fear I'm giving this slice of over-boiled ham more credit than it is due. It pains me to have to even give it one star. I whole-heartedly share Zachary Norwood's astonishment at how highly this film is regarded. That such a lame, manipulative commodity should elicit such impassioned approval crushes the spirit of those with more cinematic discernment (and hope for the medium). Where Zachary recommends films like LAST TANGO, I'd be more inclined to suggest anything by Alexander Sokurov, Bela Tarr, Michael Haneke, Theo Angelopoulos, Robert Bresson, Carl Dreyer, Sharunas Bartas, Zhang-ke Jai, Hou Hsiao-hsien, Tsai Ming-liang, Bruno Dumont, Gaspar Noe, Jacques Rivette, Jean-Marie Straub, Chantel Akerman, Claire Denis, Margarite Duras, or Jean-Luc Godard, a short list that barely skims the surface of the depth of cinematic choice available, and in relation to which something as gratuitous and banal as THE LEGEND OF 1900 pales into insignificance. (For lovers of Tim Roth, I suggest his remarkable directorial debut, THE WAR ZONE, or any of his English work as an actor, particularly MADE IN BRITAIN by the under-rated and extraordinary Alan Clarke.)
As a ""fairy-tale for grownups"", THE LEGEND OF 1900 flatters the laziest of viewers, which demeans grownups and fairy tales. As one character says, ""You're never really done-for as long as you have a good story and someone to tell it to"" - or did he mean to say, ""someone to sell it to""?

1350185,5,B00004TBUH,"This Tornatore venture virtually oozes four decades of atmosphere and is beautifully embellished by punctiliously detailed sets, costumes, and threaded with lush musical themes. The life of a child abandoned on an ocean liner at the turn of the century(""1900"" played by Tim Roth),is recounted in the present and flashbacks by his friend Max(Pruitt Taylor Vince),an aging, down-on-his-luck trumpeter,to a pawn shop proprietor (Peter Vaughan).
1900's prodigious musical talents are displayed many times, but three instances are outstanding for their humor, drama and melancholy, respectively: the piano ""duel"" between 1900 and Jelly Roll Morton(Clarence Williams III); the rhapsodic pathos of a love theme as 1900 records a wax matrix while absorbed in the angelic face of a young woman outside his window(Mlanie Thierry), soon to be lost in a crowd leaving the ship--and him--behind; the brightly lilting tune he plays as the brakeless piano rolls about the ballroom in a turbulent sea with Max at his side.
To refer to this story as mere character development understates its value. 1900 symbolizes a man, never having left the confines of the ship, who lives in a defined, finite world and who,though the piano finds infinitude in his imagination and music. Ultimately,however,he must confront the inevitable: to leave the ship for the seeming boundlessness of dry land or die in a state of non-existence. There is no record of his birth and only one recording of his work.
Roth's subtle skills are brought to the fore in 1900' sometimes brilliant,sometimes naive--and always irreverant--character.

Anyone that says the scenes are more or less ""sappy"" must be very jaded, to say the least.  This is a movie to be watched when relaxed and not be critical.",1052006400,2,614,4.1525423728813555
1350188,2,B00004TBUH,"This movie has a great premise.  In 1900, the year after which the main character is named, the world was changing from a place where one's entire world was confined within a few miles' horse-ride from his home into the world of mind-numbing complexity stretching out in all directions, as alluded to in the final scene.  The sea was the romantic call to someone of the 19th century, and the ship visiting the city could have been a powerful metaphor for the cultural change.
Unfortunately, this movie feels like it was written and filmed by an immature teenager.  This movie has all the characteristics of a boy of about 14.  To name a few, there's silly scripted swearing that sounds like someone trying to look tough; a sappy, over-romanticized vision of beauty (she conveniently pauses at each porthole so we can see her as she walks along the deck); an absurd testosterone showdown, where the performances are intended to ... and over-the-top purple-heart sophistry on the meaning of life, and how some people are just not meant for this crazy world.  Plus a big improbable EXPLOSION thrown in! (I guess the scrap metal market must have been pretty depressed in postwar England, so they just blew those old boats up....)
To add to the mess, the director destroys what little mood he can work up with jarring edits, ineptly ordered flashbacks and jaw-droppingly stupid dialogue.  The worst example in the script is his rendering of the boat-as-world metaphor into garbled ""god's piano"" psychobabble in the final scene.  To make it even worse, he then immediately tacks on some kind of (supposedly) comic relief about having one's left arm blown-off and replaced by a right arm --- apparently to ensure the removal of any tiny amount of emotional power there might have been in this scene.  The rest of the movie is peppered with cutesy aphorisms like ""Life is worth living as long as you have a story and someone to tell it to"".
Movie magic can allow us to overlook - or even celebrate - the bizarre coincidences and strange occurrences.  The cigarette-on-the-strings bit works, more or less.  But the the director doesn't give us enough magical moments to allow us to want to believe in any of the 10 or 15 improbabilities in the script.  ""Can I play my trumpet ONE LAST TIME?""  ""Hey, I just GLUED that song BACK TOGETHER!  And they're blowing up the ship TOMORROW!"".  I think I would have loved the scene of the piano on the rolling ship, if I wasn't so distracted wondering how they managed to keep the bench and piano together.  And am I supposed to believe that only ""one guy"" notices the Statue of Liberty?  It's right beside the freakin' ship!
The only mildly worthy bit of this otherwise unwatchable movie is the Jelly Roll Morton scene, which has some exciting piano playing.  However, this is mitigated by the one-dimensional portrayal of Jelly Roll, and the confusingly equivocal quality Tim Roth gives to the confrontation.  It seemed like this would have been a good time to (finally!) give us some insight into the character, like his apparent dislike of competition and love of the music.  ....
This movie might have been great.  Instead, it's a mess.  Give it a pass.  If you still are thinking about watching this movie, get Ennio Morricone's soundtrack instead.  Assuming it has the piano duel on it.",1051228800,10,3322,4.769230769230769

I was left with a sense of wholeness and joy, even though the ending was sad. I recommend you see this film and cry with the best of us. No movie has ever made me feel so alive and I love the fact that it moved me to tears. If you don't cry by the end of the film, then you did not understand the complexity of the characters. Tom Roth makes you feel his pain and his difficulty to be ordinary. The passion and simple pleasure he brings to the screen is one I haven't seen since I saw the English Patient. If a movie makes me sob like this one did, then I regard it as a miracle. By far, the best movie I have ever seen! Watch it and keep a kleenex at the ready.

Poor fellows, they can't watch anything without dissecting them into body parts, and the so-called film reviews end up being film-making-techniques-reviews.
Upon saying so, the film was beautifully made, and impeccably acted, raw and refined at the same time.  It is one of those films you would get more and more by each viewing because their story and characters are so complex in their simplicity, and so simple in their complexity. I think it's better explained in music than words--let's just put it this way. If you had seen the film, you'd know what I meant.",1043452800,4,788,5.00763358778626
1350192,5,B00004TBUH,"I've adored this movie from the beginning to the Hong Kong DVD to the Canadian DVD and now the Italian DVD which is 169 minutes long and has a second disc with interviews and how the movie was made, etc.
This longer version adds even more magic to this unforgettable film.  It's as though these wonderful, memorable characters came back to just tell you a few things more.  Most of the additional footage is in the first half of the film and no matter how well you know the shortened version, the additions are virtually seamless, making you think they were there all along.
For those who question why this film didn't do well originaly, it was released around the time of Cameron's ""Titanic"" and people had all the wrong expectations for this one.
The Italian version (in PAL format) has dialogue and subtitles in both English and Italian for not just the film, but the bonus materials too, so many (well, if you have a multi-region DVD player) people can enjoy.  This movie is reason enough to blast the studios for fighting all multi-region ""firmware"" out there for DVD players.  Otherwise, we'd have to go to Italy to see this version.  Ridiculous.
Oh, if you get it, turn on the subtitles--since they were done in Italy (the Canadian DVD has none), it seems they might be from the original script and you can compare them to the onscreen dialogue which is more idiomatic and character-driven.
Now can we please get the long version of ""Bagdad Cafe"" on DVD?  The one that runs on Bravo....",1041292800,7,1493,4.615094339622641
1350193,5,B00004TBUH,"I, too, first saw the movie on IFC (one of my favorite channels) but only caught the 2nd half of it. The next day I came back home praying that IFC would show it again, and they did! What can I tell you, I got hooked. I still haven't returned the rental DVD (2nd week now). Needless to say, I'm just about to order the uncut, Italian version. It is a shame that a movie of this caliber is found by accident here in the US, while you get force fed with ads for big budget hollywood b.s. till it starts coming out through your nose.
Aside from the director, I think the two men that played a major role to the success of this movie are Ennio Morricone, whose music is simply amazing, and Tim Roth, who shines in this role. As much as I enjoyed the movie, it felt like it could've been made a bit longer. Today I discover that there IS a longer version, yesss! I'll come back to write what I think of it.

I adored this movie.  There is something fantastic and appealing about the grand ocean liners, and this film uses that setting as its world.  The cast is superb, the images striking, and the story of the life of the main character is moving beyond words.  The scene as he is stepping off the ship to find a woman really tore at my soul.  The music, a vital component of the plot, is by the remarkable Ennio Morricone, who has been scoring hundreds of films over the past 40 years (including, for example, Wolf, Mission to Mars, Cinema Paradiso, La Cage Aux Folles, Once Upon a Time in the West, The Good the Bad and the Ugly, and Fistful of Dollars).
Like many other reviewers, I discovered this film by accident on television late one night in Paris.  I do not know why this film was not more popular, but there seems to be a growing cult of devotees.

The crew member who found him named him 1900 since he was found on the first day of the first month of 1900.  1900 lives his whole life aboard the ship on which he was born.  The Legend of 1900 is the story of his life aboard the ship.  This movie is magical.  It is enrapturing and has an amazing ability to draw you in from the very beginning with it's magic.  1900 is a phenomenal piano player and the movie comes alive with his music.  Only once is 1900 tempted to leave the ship to visit a beautiful young girl who inspired the most beautiful song of the movie.  This movie is an experience, not just a movie.  You inhale this movie rather than watch it!",1036281600,4,763,4.060402684563758
1350196,4,B00004TBUH,"THE LEGEND OF 1900  has as its protagonist a man named D.B.T.D.L. 1900. The ""1900"" is indicative of the year he was born and found abandoned on a luxury ocean liner, the ""Virginian"", after its passengers had disembarked in New York. Let it suffice to say that the other initials stand for the ship's crewman that discovered him, and the brand name on the produce crate in which he was lying.
The time frame of this film can be tricky at the beginning unless one pays attention. The ""now"" is, apparently, after WWII. After pawning his trumpet in an English hockshop, Max (Pruitt Taylor Vince) begs to play it one last time. While doing so, the pawnbroker recognizes the melody as that played on a piano on an old record. He spins it for Max, who identifies the pianist as 1900, whom he met in 1927 when he (Max) signed aboard the Virginian as a band member. In a flashback, he recalls the story of 1900's birth, emphasizing that the man never ever left the liner to set foot on solid land. On being asked where he found the disk, purportedly the master copy of the recording session and the only one in existence, the shop owner says it was hidden in a piano that came off an old hospital ship berthed in the harbor. On going to the dock, Max recognizes the rusting hulk as the Virginian, which is in the process of being loaded with explosives designed to scuttle the vessel. Convinced that 1900 is still aboard and hiding, he insists on a search. Interspersed with this activity are more flashbacks to the 20s and 30s when Max played with 1900 in the ship's main ballroom.
THE LEGEND OF 1900 is not a perfect film by any means. The character of The Girl (Melanie Thierry) and her relationship with 1900 are left frustratingly underdeveloped. Sad-faced Tim Roth is wonderful as the enigmatic 1900, who is perhaps too inscrutable. (But, then, legends generally are, or they wouldn't be legends. Remember the old saw, ""Familiarity breeds contempt."") Without the monolog by 1900 towards the end when he explains himself to Max, the viewer would be left with precious little of the former to fathom. However, one thing is known for sure - 1900 is a phenomenal musical talent. He can play a melody on the piano, no matter how complex, after having heard it only once. He demonstrates this and more (wow!) during a ""dueling pianos"" session with Jelly Roll Morton (Clarence Williams III), the ""inventor"" of jazz, who comes aboard for an Atlantic crossing just so he can challenge the famous upstart. And, in perhaps the film's most entrancing scene, 1900 plays the piano in the deserted ballroom while the ship rolls in the ocean swells. 1900 has unlocked the piano's anchor wheels, so the instrument glides serenely back and forth over the dance floor while managing not to hit anything until ... well, you have to see it.
Viewed as a tragic figure, the viewer will understand 1900 when he says, ""The world has passed me by 2000 people at a time.""  The film is bittersweet to be sure, but well done. See it if you're looking for something on the slightly eccentric side of ordinary.",1033603200,86,3076,4.611313868613139

 When I first tried to watch this movie, I was at a loss as to why there was no dialogue.  Only background sounds. I was ready to return it to Blockbuster when suddenly I had a brainstorm--- maybe something needed to be done to the sound, a feature checked, or unchecked on the menu.
 Well, lo and behold, the menu indicator was on ""Music and Details Only"", so I checked ""Dolby Sound"" or whatever the choice was, and it was a miracle.  They talked !!

1350198,5,B00004TBUH,"BUY this one.  Rent something else. This is actually a slightly tragic story, but there is a scene in this movie that is so funny, that if you don't laugh, call the coroner, because you're dead. That scene alone could have carried the film if the rest of it were a dog. But it's not.  The piano music is stunningly brilliant. Except for three snippets shot at the dock, this entire movie is set on board the cruise ship ""the Virginian"". Yes, they do blow up the ship toward the end, with ""six tons of dynamite"". But there is so much more reason to see this movie!  Okay, maybe the actors aren't your big name over-paid familiar type people. The cast perform outstandingly, without a single instance of ""bad actor"" distraction! The roles are believably portrayed with the depth of character that might prove too challenging for the Mel Gibson sort of Hollywood actor. The sets weren't cheap, either. Only detectable reason for the ""R"" rating is the occasional use of the ""F-word"", when a ""screw it"" would have sufficed.  Too bad, really, because this is otherwise a great PG movie the whole family would enjoy. No nude scenes (but I liked it anyway!)

The Legend of 1900 has touched me so deeply that it is indeed hard to even come up with the words to say that would show how much this movie means to me. The story of this Piano player,the greatest in the world. Abandoned on ship in 1900,he quickly gains the name of that year as no one else knows what to call him. He grows into a man on this ship. His only escape however is playing a piano. Everyone who sees him knows how good he is. But while the fans are cheering and the people are worshipping 1900,he is secretly battling himself. Trying to overcome the fear of the true and real world,while knowing he is someone on this ship. I cannot tell you everything because I would ruin the story. But I will Highly reccomend this movie to anyone and everyone who has not seen it. It truly will touch you. In many ways 1900 is more like you and I than we care to think. He is a man who is good at what he does and content where he is,yet knows there is so much more to life than the ship in which he abides.",1031097600,4,1164,4.0
1350200,5,B00004TBUH,"The first time I stumble across this movie on the Independent Film Channel (15 minutes into the movie) I thought, hmm... this reminds me of the Titanic (yes, I mean *the* megahit ""Titanic"" movie).
The similarity is uncanny... Same era, same piers/docks, same ship model/size/interior style/number of smoke-stacks/coal burning engines/grand ballroom/third-class cabins/first-class cabins. The story is even similarly unfolded as a narrated flashback scenes.
Can't really explained it, but somehow I stop myself from switching to a different channel because something tells me that this movie is better than the Titanic. I have to tell you, *that* was a good decision.
This movie is more satisfying than the Titanic.
You can read other reviewer's synopsis about the story, I'd like to point out the stuff that amazes me. First of all, the music is gorgeous... some jovial, some grand, some sweet, a couple... haunting. Second, the movie does an excellent job in portraying the 1900 character as a piano genius that draws inspiration for his music from what he observed... in real-time! In one of the memorable scenes, he literally changes his music as he looks at different people on the ship. Third, the character's view of the world is... ""interesting"", and I guarantee that you'll talk about it long after the movie ended.
You don't have to be a pianist to appreciate this film, but for those of you who plays piano, all of the piano scenes in this movie are well-executed (there're a lot of them), I was hard-pressed to spot that the actor is ""faking"" it. As I learned later on, one of the actors is actually a well-known jazz musician. Some of the scenes are really imaginative and really ""smoking"".
Finally, seeing this movie really deepen my appreciation for independent moview. This movie feels like a fresh breeze from the ocean compared to the cookie-cutter type Hollywood movies. Like one of the characters said:

This is a simple movie with a simple concept with a profound message for us all delivered in a unique, clever, sentimental, charming, and deeply affecting way.

1350206,5,B00004TBUH,"""The Legend of 1900"" is a movie unlike almost any other I have seen. It takes place entirely on a ship at sea, but the action spans more than 40 years. It is the story of a musical genius who is born, lives out his life, and ultimately dies on board a grand trans-Atlantic liner in the first half of the 20th century. He watches the world pass him by just a few thousand people at a time, has a fabulous piano-duel with none other than Jelly Roll Morton, is sought after by recording companies, and listens to and learns from the music of all the different cultures who are emigrating from the Old World to the New, but he never once leaves the ship. Indeed, the mere thought of setting foot on land is his ultimate nightmare.
I remember having a guest over one evening who was seeing it for the very first time. His reaction (after wiping a tear from his eye) was to exclaim ""what a wonderful movie! How did anyone even get a film that quirky made?"" There is no Hollywood 'formula' to this film. It proceeds without any of the usual conventions: no good guy vs. bad guy struggles, no sex, no violence, and no crude jokes.

1350207,5,B00004TBUH,"Director Giuseppe Tornatore (Cinema Paradiso) has lovingly crafted a bittersweet story about life, music and the intricate weave of one upon the other.  Tornatore caresses the heart with characters steeped in emotion and sentimentality without descending into sappiness (okay, maybe just a little at the end).
The setting is turn of the 20th century.  On New Year's Day, a baby is abandoned on an ocean liner and adopted by one of the crew members who names him ""1900"".  The boy never leaves the vessel and crosses back and forth for his whole life.  As a child he learns to play piano and proves himself to be a genius at the instrument.
The story is interesting by itself, but Tornatore brings incredible feeling to the tale.  1900 has an amazing gift of being able to put not only his emotions to music, but characterizations of others he sees around the room.  All his pieces are impromptu and as original as the people surrounding him.
Tim Roth is fantastic in the lead role, displaying extraordinary range.  He renders a believable pianist, but more importantly, he simultaneously brings the character dynamism and depth.  When he is playing the crowd he is the flamboyant showman, yet when he is alone or with Max (Pruitt Taylor Vince) he is reflective and moody.
Pruitt Taylor Vince also comes through with a strong performance as 1900's close friend and fellow musician.  Vince plays the part with great empathy and the interactions between him and Roth are often moving.  Clarence Williams III (yes, that's Linc from the Mod Squad TV series in the 60's) is electrifying as Jelly Roll Morton, the self proclaimed inventor of jazz.  Williams steals the show for at least 15 minutes as he and Roth duel it out on the piano.
The music is exquisite.  Ennio Morricone is a prolific composer whose career spans 40 years with five Oscar nominations.  He has scored over 400 films including ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"", ""The Untouchables"", ""Days of Heaven"", ""Disclosure"", and ""Twister"".  His ability to find the right music for the multiple moods in this film is astounding.
For viewers who enjoy complex character studies replete with unabashed sentimentality, this film is worth hunting down at the movie store.  I rated it a 9/10.  It is a richly rewarding experience.",1028851200,7,2277,4.860103626943006

First of all, as a pianist, I can tell you that the piano ""faking"" by Roth and Williams is FABULOUS! (We won't go into the trumpet mimicry, although I think Pruitt Taylor Vince is a major talent.)  And the pianists and piano music for the film's soundtrack are spectacular. This is a magical, mystical fairytale type story.  It would make a mesmerizing stage musical, and I hope to see that someday. If you love magical,romantic, witty and intelligent fables, this is for you. The original Italian novel (NOVECENTO) has yet to be translated into English, which is a shame, because it's VERY short and should have come out with the US release.  Although there are no extra features on the DVD, enjoy! Tim Roth at his BEST!

Update! (1/7/10) I'm in my final year of teaching high school music. Last year I taught my last Music Theory class, and it only had 3 students. But what a 3! One incredible musician/pianist, a dancer, and a football player. We had an incredible bond, and when I realized that there was never a film you could show to a music theory class for fun/enrichment, I chose to show this one as a little break after midterms. They were mesmerized. All three were seniors and I gave them each a copy of this for graduation. You'd think they'd been given a new ipod they were so happy!!!",1028592000,3,1744,4.54140127388535

There are no great tragedies, no huge twists of fate, no massive deus ex machina to put everything right or smite anyone down.  It's just a fairy tale of sorts, the simple yet extraordinary story of a man who could play piano like a god, but never quite figured out where he fit into life.  This film proves beyond a doubt Tim Roth's talent and versatility as an actor; he is outstanding.  By turns hilarious and heartbreaking, ""The Legend of 1900"" is well worth anyone's time.

There are scenes that I will never forget in this film.  A piano duel with the father of Jazz, a spontaneous composition when the hero sees a beautiful woman through a porthole, and many more.

I was so excited to see that amazon was carrying such a beautiful movie that has, undoubtedly, not receieved nearly enough recognition.  The Legend of 1900 is one of the most amazing movies that I have seen and has an amazing soundtrack to accompany it.  Why this movie has not recieved the recognition it deserves, I do not know.

Not because of the cinematography, or the special effects, or the ""star billing"" but because this film captures an emotion that we are all familiar with and portrays it so excellently.
Tim Roth steps out of his Tarantino mold and does a SUPERB job of capturing the essence of an ellusive and eccentric and talented musician... and (to the credit of another fav of mine) ""all that that implies...""

The  amazing part, Tim Roth plays as the amazing piano player ""1900"", has touched everybodies heart in a different way. He plays the roll so natural that you would think he actually knows how to play the piano in real life. Tim Roth is an outstanding actor and all of his films must be watched. The most amazing part of this movie is when he challenged to a piano duel. The King of Jazz, known as ""Jelly Roll Morton"", hears of the amazing piano player, 1990, and decides to challenge him.

Roth really put his heart and soul into this role and it really shows. This movie is definatley on my top 5 greatest movies list. This movie has it all: action, suspense, drama, and even comedy.

This film is extraordinary in its exploration of the mind of a man whose life circumstances are so different from anyone we might ever know.  Roth is superb in letting us inside his head (and heart) through his body language, facial expressions and, of course, through his music, long before he verbalizes it.  In fact, we get to ""see"" the formation of his philosophy as it happens.
The relationship between Max and 1900 is a solid foundation for the film, which should have gotten every editing award on the globe for the sequence of the piano duel with Jelly Roll Morton.  The film's look is wonderful except for a truly tacky plastic model of the ship Virginian.  But the dockside scenes are great and are beside a ship that looks the right vintage.  Every actor, including the extras, is just right.  The ship's interiors are wonderful, and so is the interior of the pawnshop.

This is quite possibly the most beatiful film I've ever seen. One year before i saw it, I heard the Roger Water's song ""lost boys calling"" The song was excellent but i never heard it in the proper context. When it's played on piano in the film, when 1900 sees the girl, he tracks her and plays it, she leaves and there's only the sea. The song is also on the end credits.
The acting is superb, the story even better. I think those who've seen this will never forget the ""piano duel"".

The film deals with the people he meets, fleetingly as they reach his destination and his struggle to come to terms with the realisation that there is a big new world at the end of the gangplank.
It has the feel of one of the sixties epics, but using the sound and cinematography of the 21st century to create a rich, deep feeling of being on board.  Sometimes the film seems to drag, but as we are brought up on a diet of films with explosions incredible special effects, and quick cut scenes it is refreshing to see a film that is both,interesting and uplifting.  And if you enjoy good music, especially piano you are in for a treat.

Tim Roth stars as ""1900"", an abandoned infant who is raised on a steam ship and never sets food on dry land. His whole world exists only with the passengers and co-workers. Soon  his talent as a piano player becomes legendary which forces a showdown with the great Jelly Roll Martin ( Played by Clarence Williams III ). The jazz soundtrack done by Tornatore's frequent collaborator Ennio Morrocone alone is worth the price of admission. All in all this movie is a real gem.",1011830400,,625,4.434782608695652
1350224,5,B00004TBUH,"You probably know Tim Roth from playing bad guys, as in ""Reservoir Dogs"", ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Planet of the Apes"" --if you didn't notice, he was the bad ape--, or ,even, in ""Vatel"". Now, watching ""The Legend of 1900"", you'll be surprised seeing him playing the title role, 1900 -- yes, this is his name-- who is a very melacholic musician.
1900 was found in a ship when was still a baby. Adoped by one of the men who worked in it, he grew up watching people immigrate to America and being greeted by the Statue of Liberty. He is a natural born musician, so he can perfectly play piano, and it starts to call people's attention. So the film follows the life of this man who never leaves the ship. The story is told by one of his band mates.
The script is very fine, balacing some funny moments and some melancholics events. It is impossible to forget the impressive duel between 1900 and the father of the jazz. And Ennio Morricone's score is superb. The music that 1900 `composes' in the very moment a record is being recorded and he falls for a beautiful girl resonated in my mind for days. This piece is deeply touching. Giuseppe Tornatore is, as everybody knows, Italian and he directs the movie with the Italian approach, in other words, it will touch your heart and will make you cry many times.
There is no doubt that Tim Roth is the heart, soul and fingers of the film. Although he does not play piano, he just mimes, it is so good that one may think he is actually playing the songs. Other thing that is not impossible to avoid mentioning is his eyes. They are so deep and expressive. Most of his feelings are expressed by those melancholic pair of eyes. 1900 grabs your heart and, even though being so surreal, he looks so believable that you think you're watching a story very likely to have happened.
I recomend this movie for those who like Italian Cinema, and music as well. I don't think this is the kind of film for everyone, but, surely, it has its audience.",1011744000,10,1971,4.417582417582418

this film will appeal to people who like their stories with a tender touch. As long as there's a story to tell, its never the end and Guisseppe Tornatore directs this like a great fable with rich cinematic visuals and orchasteral direction. Ennio Morricone the composer once again leaves the winds breathless and asking for more.

1350236,4,B00004TBUH,"The Legend of 1900 (Giuseppe Tornatore, 1998)

Tornatore, who more recently made a few waves with his Oscar-winning 2000 film Malena, here gives us a simple, demented, and utterly delightful story of a boy named Novocento, born on a cruise ship in 1900 (hence his name), raised on the cruise ship, and... well, unable to leave the cruise ship. Novocento (played in his adult scenes by the always wonderful Tim Roth) has never set foot on dry land. After he grows up, he gets a job on the ship as a pianist and becomes fast friends with the ship's new trumpet player, Max (Pruitt Taylor Vince). The story is told in flashback by Max as he pawns his trumpet.

The story of 1900 is the story of the passing of an era; to hear Max tell it, 1900 invented jazz (and in one of the film's climactic scenes, he's challenged to a piano duel by Jelly Roll Morton [Clarence Williams III]; the final seconds of this scene are truly unforgettable) and was, in his time, the most popular
musician on earth-- but he only allowed his music to be recorded once, and he destoryed the wax pressing afterwards in a fit of pique. Ah, but times pass, and the music, the cruise ship, and the man went out of fashion.

The movie didn't spend much time on American shores, and that is truly a crime. If you get a chance to rent the video, do so. Roth is above even his usual level of excellence, Vince is finally given a role that his minor pieces in many great films (Barfly, The End of Violence, Jacob's Ladder, etc.) have convinced us he was capable of and he handles it with aplomb, and the music is marvelous. Definitely a keeper. ****",987379200,5,1614,4.391304347826087
1350237,5,B00004TBUH,"When I saw this movie this time,I thought the music was great. It will be able to  tell someone something in our heart, which we cannot express no matter how carefully we choose and collect words. And probably it will be able to unify our minds easily than any eloquent speech. But I think it is no wonder that music, which was born much earlier than language, has that sort of power.  I think music is not only something made complete as a tune but it includes the sound of the sea, the sound of the rain, the sound of the car, the note, footsteps, breath, the rhythm of a heart beatingcall the sounds. It is not made by us. It is in our body by nature. So I think this movie impress us whether we have played the piano or not.  I have been playing the piano for a long time, I have always played tunes which someone composed in the old days. My playings reflect some gstoriesh in my life, but they canft become mine entirely. So I envy 1900( protagonist of this story )who can make beautiful tunes which come from feelings in himself. They are his words, and not any othersf. I think it is more worth while being called emusicf than any other thing.  Because 1900 has born on the ship and he has never got off, he doesnft even exist in the eyes of the low. But in his life, he is surrounded by kind people, plays the piano to his heartfs content, meets with setbacks sometimes, has the best friend Max, who believed him and cried for him and he can even choose the way of his own death. So I think his life is not bad. I think it is more important to remain in somebodyfs memory than to acquire a nationality. So I only hope there is a piano which can play with two right hands in the heaven.",977184000,,1694,4.155487804878049
