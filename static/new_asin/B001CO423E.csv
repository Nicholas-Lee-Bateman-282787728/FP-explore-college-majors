3514392,5,B001CO423E,"In the past four years, director, producer and screenwriter Judd Apatow has become a well known name in the comedy genre. This 3-disc comedy collection includes three of Apatow's most outrageously funny comedies: ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"", ""Knocked Up"" and ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"". In ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" (2005), mild-mannered forty-year-old Andy Stitzer (Steve Carell) never had sex. While his close colleagues are determined to help him lose his virginity, Andy begins a mutual no-sex relationship with a single mother (Catherine Keener). In ""Knocked Up"" (2007), a drunken one-night stand changes the lives of career-minded entertainment journalist Allison Scott (Katherine Heigl) and immature slacker Ben Stone (Seth Rogen). Now facing parenthood, can these two mismatched individuals forge a relationship and raise a child? In ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" (2008), struggling musician Peter Bretter (Jason Segel) was dumped by his famous girlfriend, actress Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell), and takes an impulsive trip to Hawaii to forget her and raise his spirits. Unfortunately, he ends up staying in the same luxury hotel with his ex and her new self-absorbed rock star boyfriend (Russell Brand). All three unforgettable comedies are big-hearted and laugh-out-loud funny. They feature likable storylines, good ensemble casts, hilarious awkward moments and plenty of over-the-top raunchy humor. All three movies were commercially successful and well received by US critics.

For fans of rude, crude and outrageous humor, the 3-disc ""Ultimate Unrated Comedy Collection"" is a highly recommended purchase. All three Judd Apatow comedies are presented in their theatrical 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen formats. Both theatrical and unrated versions of these movies are included in this 3-disc Blu-Ray collection. The picture quality is pretty good but not awe-inspiring. Its DTS-HD audio is well balanced and perfectly clear. Each Blu-Ray disc comes fully loaded with special features including feature-length audio commentaries with the film's director, production crew and cast members, extended and deleted scenes, outtakes, gag reels and short behind-the-scenes featurettes. Overall, ""Ultimate Unrated Comedy Collection"" receives an ""A-"".",1222905600,10,2246,5.953560371517028

Buy this - I own 2 sets I like these movies so much.

FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL was phenomenal and shot at the former TURTLE BAY HILTON in Kahuku Hawaii. I have been there 5 times so I felt like I was there in the movie.

40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN is one of my favorite comedies of all time

KNOCKED UP is a great movie

3514461,5,B001CO423E,"First of all: I bought this set today at Best Buy, in store, and it was only $19.99 which made it all the more sweet and made me inifinitely happy because buying these film separately would've costed about $60 (3-Disc ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is about $30 there and both ""Knocked Up"" and ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" are both about $15) and I see it costs just about that amount here on Amazon. This is very interesting and Best Buy is exactly that in this case, the ""best buy"".

That aside, this set is almost too good to be true. Three amazingly funny and kind of touching movies in one set. And the special editions of each of them make it still more amazing!

I'd review each of the movies separately but I really don't feel like it, but yeah this set is almost too good to  be true.",1247270400,,786,4.333333333333333

3514464,4,B001CO423E,"I bought this 3 pack since it was cheaper then getting each of them individually, and honestly all 3 are worth owning for fans of the Judd Apatow type of comedies that we're seeing lately.  The real world, rated R type with a combination of stoner and dirty humor mixed together.  The humor throughout is pretty much the same because of the source, and you'll also see some of the same characters pop up that are normal to Apatow's crew like Jonah Hill and Seth Rogen.

All 3 are solid comedies, with my favorite being Forgetting Sarah Marshall.  I only give this 4 stars because the Blu-ray quality on all of these aren't exactly the greatest.  They're better then DVD, sure, but they aren't as sharp as some of the best looking Blu-ray transfers out there which is a bit of a disappointment.  My box also came with all 3 blu-ray cases inside a bit nicked and damaged, which is a bit of a disappointment.  The box these come in is just a cheap cardboard cover with the 3 regular movies kept inside.

3514490,5,B001CO423E,"3 hilarious movies for the price of 2! I had wanted all three of these movies on Blu and what a great deal this was. All 3 movies are in their own cases same as the ones when you buy them single and are the same versions as well. You don't get anything special aside from the one box which I didn't really need or want. Usually ""comedy packs/collections"" come with one good movie and the other two would be decent or just plain bad. This is the rare gem where all 3 are great movies. My personal favorite is Forgetting Sarah Marshall, but honestly all three are excellent.

40 Year Old Virgin is the now classic Steve Carell movie. Knocked Up continues the trend of odd characters and great humor. Although it's not as popular among females who call it out saying it's unrealistic for Katherine Heigl's character to end up with someone like Seth Rogan. Most guys of course, would have no problems ending up with someone looking like Katherine Heigl. And finally Forgetting Sarah Marshall brings another great cast together for even more bizarre comedy. All of them have some equally funny stuff in the extras as well. They are all great discs.

If you liked any one of these movies then chances are good that you will like all of them all and getting this as a pack at a great price is a good way to expand that Blu-Ray collection.",1226966400,,1331,4.428571428571429
