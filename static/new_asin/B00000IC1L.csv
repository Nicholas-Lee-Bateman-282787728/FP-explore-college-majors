1220773,3,B00000IC1L,"That being my favorite line from the libretto of ""Francesca da Rimini,"" an overripe operatic melodrama that the Met exhumed about twenty years ago at the behest, I believe, of conductor James Levine.  Bless him, cause he assembled a superb cast, far better than the piece deserves.  Stylistically, it's a somewhat uneasy mix of ""Turandot"" (bombast), ""Thais"" (exotic lyricism) and ""Doktor Faust"" (atonalism) that often plays like a Roger Corman horrer-fest set to music.  (That severed head looks heavy!)  Frankly, I find it a hard opera to love.  Very difficult to sing, it's at times difficult to process, particularly in Act Two when everyone's screaming at the top of both their lungs and range.  There are very few lyrical moments, and one wishes that Zandonai had had a better sense of shape and pacing.  (Perhaps that's why he's pretty much a one-opera wonder.)

But, my God, what a spectacular production this is!!  Stunning sets, sumptuous, beautifully detailed costumes, evocative lighting, and more smoke and fire than you'd expect to find at a fundamentalist book burning.  The cast, as noted, couldn't be bettered, but this being a killer score, with so much placed in the high tessitura, the four leads at times sound a bit strained, particularly MacNeil.  But they're a passionate quartet, milking every ounce of angst from their dysfunctional family dynamic, be they lame, maimed, insane, or just incestuously star-crossed.  The audience is rightly swept away with the sheer fervor, grandeur and spectacle of it all (almost to their own frenzied fever pitch) -- but in my opinion it's a lot of sound and fury signifying very little.  Kudos to the Met for broadening our operatic horizons.  I just wish I enjoyed the view a bit more.",1192665600,25,1747,5.020833333333333
1220774,5,B00000IC1L,"Being too young to have ever experienced Scotto live, I was confused as to why Met audiences held her so high in her heyday.  I had heard her recordings and thought she was interesting but that her floppy high notes were a major turnoff.  Then, I saw this DVD.  I completely understand her appeal now.  She is magnetic and (I can't believe I am saying this) the loose high notes didn't even bother me.  Everything else in this production is high quality as well.  If you are a fan of Scotto, this is a must have.  Also, the score of this piece is worth hearing and I haven't heard it done better than this (in fact, it is hard to find many recordings of this at all)...",1140480000,11,669,4.2204724409448815
1220775,5,B00000IC1L,"The Metropolitan Opera went all out to make its production of this rarely performed work a success. The sets are beautiful and match the music perfectly. The conducting and playing could hardly be bettered. Scotto is nearly perfect in the title role (just a few years earlier she would have been absolutely perfect). Domingo was at his best as Paolo. Nevertheless, veteran baritone Cornell MacNeil nearly steals the show as the nasty, brutish Gianciotto. At this stage of his career, his voice was no longer beautiful, but it still had the range, power, and expressiveness to personify this evil character. The opera falls somewhat short of being an unqualified musical masterpiece, but it is a fascinating and dramatically effective work and has some stunning scenes, including the longest battle scene I have ever seen on stage in an opera theater (Die Walkure, Act III Scene 1 is shorter and the actual battle seems always to take place off stage). I recommend that you get this one. You won't be bored.",1028678400,32,1006,4.923529411764706
1220776,5,B00000IC1L,"Francesca da Rimini is a fascinating opera and in parts - the end of act 1, the second half of Act 3 - truly magical.  It is not the sort of opera which would take kindly to a minimalist production or to updating, so - in this case - the lavish sets and costumes provided by the Met are entirely appropriate and highly effective (though I do wish the audience would refrain from applauding the scenery). The opera stands or falls by the casting of Francesca and Paolo and in this production it definitely stands. In 1984, Placido Domingo was a dashing and handsome Paolo acting with verve and on top vocal form. We perhaps too often take him for granted because he has been so good for so long.  Francesca is supposed to be young and beautiful. Renata Scotto is neither, but for much of the time she makes you think that she is. Her acting is most certainly of the operatic variety, but it works. At this stage in her career, when she is called upon to deliver the highest notes her voice turns hard and wobbles - fortunately there are not that many of the highest notes in this part. The rest of the voice remains gorgeous and infinitely expressive.  Levine and the Met orchestra play superbly.",1026432000,25,1195,4.422727272727273
1220796,5,B00000IC1L,"Just who talked the Met into producing this once  (but no longer) popular opera, I don't  know.  However, the performance is from Renata Scotto's heyday and she and Domino, MacNeil and Levine put forth an estimable effort in  promoting the passionately 'purple' score.  There is much lovely music that stays in the mind and a great break from the standards.",1359417600,,357,4.883333333333334
1220797,3,B00000IC1L,"The only reason why I got this opera is because I saw it on the 2012 MET HD schedule. I had never heard of Zandonai but of course we love Tchaikovsky's Francesca da Rimini. First in defense of the 3 star review this gentleman has all the right to rate it lower because he did not appreciate it....he is discerning. All operas cannot be 5 stars. This would appear to be a forgotten opera but I have to admit it does not belong on the trash heap. The opera itself is not particularly memorable; the orchestration however is quite remarkable and the love duet reminds you a little of the crazy passion between Tristan and Isolde. The production is quite stunning and the actors all in fine form. Scotto and Domingo are in fine form though we do get spoiled with attractive younger divas now such as Netrebko. In short, if you have seen the top 100 or so operas and looking for something new, this is worth getting. It is less than the price of the MET HD movie ticket....worth owning and viewing but certainly not in the top 100 operas of all time.",1346457600,5,1045,4.364102564102564
1220798,4,B00000IC1L,A rarely performed opera. Zandonai is reminiscent of Puccini. Renata Scotto and Placido Domingo are splendid. William Lewis a standout in support.,1327968000,2,146,5.681818181818182
1220799,5,B00000IC1L,"This is certainly one of the Metropolitan Opera's most fascinating productions available on DVD.

In 1984, the Met mounted a new production, directed by Piero Faggioni, of Riccardo Zandonai's ""Francesca da Rimini,"" after the purpled play by Gabriele d'Annunzio.  Most of us knew the score from the 1969 recording of excerpts from Decca, starring Mario del Monaco and the magnificent Magda Olivero, conducted by Nicola Rescigno.  Here, we had Renata Scotto, Plcido Domingo, and Cornell MacNeil as the tragic triangle, conducted by James Levine.  (This writer saw several rehearsals and performances of this production in the theatre.)

Faggioni's staging is really grand, recreating the theatre style of the verismo era, and resembling great silent-film acting.  The detail and grace of his work here is indescribable.  Ezio Frigerio's sets and Franca Squarciapino's costumes are truly magnificent.  To have seen this in the theatre is to never forget the experience.

Scotto's performing here is sublime, her movements marvellously co-ordinated with the music to moving and authoritative effect.  She was certainly one of the finest singing-actresses, and her voice, sometimes harsh, is totally expressive, her musicality exquisite.

Domingo fits the character of Paolo il Bello to perfection, and MacNeil roars like a beast in a stunning portrayal of the betrayed husband.  The remainder of the cast could hardly be improved.  Especially noteworthy are Richard Fredricks, William Lewis, Natalia Rom (a great artist and a marvellous Biancofiore, near the start of her career), Gail Robinson, Isola Jones, Anthony Laciura, and Brian Schexnayder.

A thundering, transcendent experience.",1325376000,11,1684,5.630952380952381
1220800,5,B00000IC1L,"I agree with all the positive opinions given here on this DVD.  I was lucky enough to have seen this production twice at the Met during the two seasons it was performed.  Having attended the Met many times, I can say that this was overall one of the most stunningly beautiful productions I'd ever seen there, let alone at any other opera house.  Aside from the sets and scenery, the staging and singing is magical, and through their passionate performances, Domingo and Scotto (despite some vocal shortcomings) seem to become the illicit lovers Francesca and Paolo.  Scotto does a particularly magnificent job of conveying Francesca's girlish innocence at the beginning and her uncontrollable passion at the tragic end.

As for the opera per se, if I had to describe Zandonai's score, I would say it sounds like Puccini crossed with Richard Strauss.  It is a highly individual, richly orchestrated and passionate work.  The music and poetry of the libretto capture the ecstasy and sadness of a passion bordering on the obsessive.  The florid writing of the libretto, however,  may be a bit much for some tastes, given that it was written by the eccentric, ""decadent"" poet/playwright/right-wing Italian patriot Gabrielle D'Annunzio and taken directly from his play of the same name.  In any case, Zandonai's opera is not for everyone, but it is very special and deserves to be performed more frequently in the U.S.  If you are a ""Francesca da Rimini"" fan, this DVD must be in your library.",1259539200,8,1488,4.93574297188755
1220801,5,B00000IC1L,"This is probably Zandonai's most-performed opera.
The piece is not romantic nor modern. But it does smacks something like Shostakovitch's 'Lady Macbeth of M'tsensk'.
True that there is generally few lyrical arias in it - not even the dancing and singing, the supposed entertainments for Francesca.
MET managed to present a most sumptuous set for the score, and the cast simply could not be bettered.
The three male protagonists - 'the lame', 'the blind', and 'the handsome', all are utterly convincingly portrayed by MacNeil, Lewis and Domingo.
And the title role of Francesca of Scotto who is neither young nor beautiful. But who cares? Scotto manages to evince an aura of beauty and youthfulness throughout the entire performance. And this is some thing that smacks true mastery and complete artistry.
A very enjoyable performance of an otherwise difficult to digest score, and rather outlandish opera.
I for one am not a Domingo fan, but have to admit that Placido Domingo is in his absolute best here, vocally, dramatically as well as visually.
This DVD is for every serious opera lover.",1245110400,6,1091,5.066666666666666
1220802,5,B00000IC1L,"I saw--and absorbed---Francesca da Rimini when the Met offered it, and like almost everyone else, I was swept away. Oh, yes, Zandonai is not Puccini, not Mascagni, but there is just something ""special"" about Francesca da Rimini that has always captivated me (well, I also like very much Spontini, Montemezzi, Auber, R.Strauss, and Mussorgsky). With the right cast and staging it DOES work...and the Met production, with Domingo, Scotto, and MacNeill, all in stellar voice, and those magnificent sets, well, it was indeed an ""event"" of the first order. And this DVD preserves it all.

I must confess that I really adore all the twists and exotic turns musically, as well. Ovderheated? Oh, yes, most definitely. Not something you want to hear or see everyday...but, wow, yes, most assuredly from time to time. The love duet at the end of Act III and the final feverish scene of Paolo and Francesca are simply spectacular, passion-filled, volcanic eruptions....I don't fight them, rather I just enjoy them.

Magda Olivero, Leyla Gencer, and Raina Kaibavanska sang Francesca, and I enjoy each of their interpretations, but this Met production remains unique and special.

Let yourself go, let the music (as overblown as it may seem, at times) and the drama envelope you. Have a glass of wine with it all, and simply enjoy it. Highly recommended.",1242172800,20,1341,5.031531531531532
1220803,5,B00000IC1L,"Superb, amazing, exotic, erotic. As Gabrielle D'Annunzio's poetry, such it is this Metropolitan Opera production of Francesca da Rimini. A classic on recorded operas, we have to thank the Met for registered this magnificent production.
If the sum of talents weren't enough, there is Renata Scotto. As the critic of the moment (1984) remarked, she found HER character. I haven`t found a better Scotto on video, no matter how much I love her Giorgetta. Here, as Francesca, she reinvented herself and reach the stars. She MUST be seen.
Do not miss this one.",1237766400,16,554,4.967741935483871
1220804,3,B00000IC1L,"I love opera and I'm not picky, so it isn't often that I watch an opera and say, ""Gee, when is this going to be over?"" But the Met's 1984-85 production of Zandonai's Francesca da Rimini had that effect on me. The staging in the first scene was absurd. As I looked at the little garden in the center of the stage, I kept wondering who had died, for it appeared to be a coffin covered with silk flowers. The action at the meeting of Francesca and Paolo was so hidden that if I hadn't been watching via video, instead of from third balcony, I couldn't have possibly seen it. The battle scene was staged better.

Voices were top notch. Domingo and Scotto lovers wouldn't be disappointed at that. But the acting was so incredibly stilted and ridiculous that I could hardly bear it. This was exacerbated by the fact that Zandonai writes so much interlude that the performers are forced to stalk about the stage acting aimlessly.

The use of Arthurian lore in the central love scene is interesting, but I didn't think it was supported well musically. By the time they kiss, we should be longing with them. I wasn't. Meanwhile, on stage, Domingo is jerking Scotto across the bed in some kind of rag doll style move that reminded me more of puppetry than passion. Renata's decision to turn upside down for the last kiss was, in my estimation, a theatrical mistake.

So the question remains, ""Did Franscesca and Paolo deserve to go to Dante's hell?"" Based on this production, I'd have to say yes!",1223683200,5,1486,4.537313432835821
1220805,5,B00000IC1L,"While I agree with the other review about the merits of this performance, I do not agree that his review should be a forum for the merits of Francesca di Rimini as an opera.  Francesca is well known to the opera cognoscenti for generations. Zandonai had a unique voice which was never to everyone's liking. Nevertheless, Francesca has remained in the repertory in Italy without interruption.  Clearly there are enough supporters of the opera to keep it popular. If you don't like this opera, don't buy it. Meanwhile don't damn this superior DVD with only three stars because you don't like the piece in the first place. This is not a forum for your learning curve.

As to the performance itself, without the likes of Magda Olivero or perhaps Raina Kabaivanska in her prime, Renata Scotto brings a sense of authority and style to this music that is incomparable. Perhaps one may not like this high note or that, but her supreme knowledge of the verisimo idiom makes her the only choice for this role at the time of this broadcast. Domingo is in spectacular form and looks the part to perfection. MacNeil also displays vocal flaws but performs the role to the manner born: he is truly menacing. The production is exquisite in every way and gives the opera the best possible presentation imaginable: this includes intentionally stylized acting, presumably recreating the style that was prevalent at the time the opera was written. James Levine conducts magnificently as if this opera were indeed a masterpiece.  I do wish (and I know this is a controversial opinion) that some cuts had been made, especially the redundant music written for Francesca's handmaidens. Cuts in this opera are routine in Italy however controversial they may be.

This DVD is a MUST for any lover of the verismo idiom! Thank you DG for this wonderful re-mastering.",1199059200,56,1838,4.859424920127796

7909945,5,B00000IC1L,"This is a major opera: it is an opera about opera as a theatrical art form: the story is high stakes drama based on Dante and very well worked out by Ricordi as librettist. Scotto and all are magnificent. These musical, scenic and dramatic artists remind us that the current Met regime telling us that they are bringing ""theater"" to the opera now (implying that there was never theater in the ""old days"" of opera) is such a fraud. There was more ""theater"" on the radio in the previous eras of opera when people really knew how to sing and that was the bottom line: the art form is built from the bottom up from mastery of the vocal technique. Scotto in slightly below best form (she made her stage debut in 1953!) is so far above the level of the lead singers of today in any role of her repertoire. Get this disc! The physical production is deluxe and beautiful: no ""video artists"" employed in creating it.",1371427200,3,907,4.404761904761905
