8204760,5,B000GETTQQ,"This is a good instructional DVD. Martin Simpson teaches various guitar alternate guitar tunings. He goes slowly and explains very well what he is doing. He focuses on the user understanding how the different tunings function and how once you know one tuning you can often adapt it to another tuning. It is strictly instructional, so if you want to hear him play full-length songs, I would suggest you get one of his concert videos. I recommend it to people who want to start using open tunings, which have enormous potential to improving your playing.",1316563200,4,552,4.821052631578947
