8619722,5,B00CC3XMOY,I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. It follows the true story of Gary Wey and his pursuit to be a successful musician. The film is very creatively shot and the performances are extremely good. I felt they captured the time era (the 1970's)in a great light. It's definitely a bumpy ride as you follow the lead character through all his up's and downs. The ending left me curious and wanting more. All in all a very well done film.,1377820800,,435,4.45
