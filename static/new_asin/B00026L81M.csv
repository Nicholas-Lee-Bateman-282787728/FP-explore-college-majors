8022863,3,B00026L81M,"I purchased this video with the intention of showing it to my first grade children in hopes that it would give them a new and different perspective on a variety of learning situations.

The video says, ""Come play with Kari Page, funnyman Lenny Schultz, and Pop, the old grouchy animator.  Learn that it can be fun to play indoors and make your own playground rock.""

I guess this is true; however, the human characters portray craziness and messy behaviors.  They take things that they say and try to create cartoons.  Now the cartoons themselves are actual 30-60 seconds of ""Playhouse Rock"" viewing; seen on lots of television stations on Saturday morning cartoons.

A lot of time is wasted in the room with the three human characters (Kari, Lenny, and Pop) showing traits that you are trying to stop but then puts a spin on it with a cartoon on how to correct it.  First of all, adults should be the example.

The DVD did show a lot of different ideas and thoughts but it just did not attract the attention of my first graders nor kept it.

The video was re-mastered and of poor quality reproduction. It could have been better if each little traits could have been listed in the screen scenes and not as a one time play all situations that way you could have picked and chose which one you wanted to view instead of having to view all or nothing.  If you are wanting a DVD that talks to children specifically about good character building traits without all the extras you may want to reconsider, however, if you are looking for a video that is clean and crazy, yet, shows character building demonstrations with a little of uncontrollable behavior in adults then you may want to get this video.

All in all, it is not a video I would have purchased knowing what I know now however; I bought all six DVD's. I considered it a waste of my money. I do however, try to make the best of a mistake and show hit and miss parts of the video that explains certain ideas and traits with the fast forward button.",1097020800,2,2002,4.457534246575342
