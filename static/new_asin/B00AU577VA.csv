5510184,5,B00AU577VA,"This romantic comedy revolved around four forty years old gentlemen and four women. The four men are good friends from childhood, they are all successful in their own way but still act like a kid when they are around each other, this is what makes the show funny. I like that every episodes shows flashback of the past, what the guys were like before they became gentlemen. They can't make up their mind about many things and have to consult each other daily, mostly about the woman in their lives. The show is funny from beginning to end, it has a good ending. All the gentlemen found love and end up with the women they are suppose to be with.  Because of its good acting (especially lead actors Jang Dong Gun and Kim Ha Neul), very funny, very good story line, very good English subtitle, and a very happy ending that is why I rated this DVD five stars. I think this is a romantic comedy that both men and women would really enjoy seeing.",1372204800,,941,4.377142857142857

5510197,5,B00AU577VA,"Growing up is most often seen as an ill-defined mixture of chronological aging with emotional advancement. A GENTLEMAN'S DIGNITY is one of the few films that takes this theme and creates a vastly interesting plot around which circulates the love issues of four highly successful Korean men in their 40s. These four have been bonding ever since high school and are closer than brothers; they know each other well enough to engage in constant teasing about their collective choices of work, romance, and ethics. This teasing is not rooted in mindless jesting. It is simply how they choose to pass trenchant comment on one another.

Each of the four has romance issues. Kim Do-Jin (Jang Dong Gun) is a confirmed bachelor playboy and is determined to stay that way until he literally collides in dress unraveling accident with Teacher Seo (Kim Ha-Neul). He falls for her and spends the rest of the film pursuing her. Complicating matters is that Teacher Seo has long had a secret crush on Do Jin's best friend Im Tae San (Kim Soo Ro), who in turn has eyes only for golfer Hong Se Ra (Yoon Se Ah). Tae San's younger sister Im Meari (Yoon Jin Yi) has loved Attorney Choi (Kim Min Jong) for years but he is reluctant to pursue her partly due to her age (24) and partly because of his relation to her brother. Closing out the interlocking constellations of romances is Lee Jung Rok (Lee Jong Huyk) who has had a rocky ten year marriage to wealthy businesswoman Park Min Sook (Kim Jung Nan)  What carries the film is how each of the four men and four women bounce off each other at all the right moments, all of which artfully combine to produce alternating tempos of crushed egos, elevated egos, and reconstituted egos. The key word here of course is ""egos,"" for A GENTLEMAN'S DIGNITY above all is thoroughly rooted in a collective ego, which must be constructed so that all of its discrete parts can harmonize. The viewer can watch during its run of twenty episodes how seemingly irreconcilable egos can be induced to make others happy. This is no mean feat and in a romantic comedy such as this, it is the gradual unveiling layers of paper-thin slivers of ego that invest A GENTLEMAN'S DIGNITY with the true dignity worthy of the title.

5510198,5,B00AU577VA,"This drama is about four guys, in a four different relationships. It was very funny at times and bring to tears, too.
Very entertaining to watch, I would recommend this drama.",1396137600,3,175,4.67741935483871
5510199,5,B00AU577VA,This a must have. These guys are amazing as well as the ladies. Love the story could not stop watching in. All the guys are too fine and sexy. Love the way the portray their culture. Love it.,1395619200,,191,4.052631578947368
5510200,5,B00AU577VA,"I loved the entire series and knew by Episode 8 that I would be purchasing this series for my own.  Loved the couples as they moved together.  Yes, there are heart-breaks, but then again that is LIFE you know.  Jong Hyun (CNBlue) is excellent!  {Lordy, is he beautiful!}  Some of the best parts for me were the FIRST 2 minute Prologue of each episode, as it showed something in the 4 guys past that created them as the friends they are now that they are in their 40's.  These prologues flavored how that episode was going to go.

You will NOT go wrong in watching or purchasing this series.

Now I have to go look up some more Jang Dong Gun shows....my new favorite actor.  What a sweetie!",1391644800,,689,4.3203125

5510202,5,B00AU577VA,"This cast fits together like no other I've ever seen.  If you are an older Kdrama fan (and maybe are tired of the Flower Boys), this is the series for you.  The comradeship among the four males is priceless, especially in the flash-backs to their younger days.  These are all seasoned actors who are familiar to anyone who has watched Kdramas, and they are at their best in this series.  Do yourself a favor and order the DVD's, PLUS the soundtrack.",1390435200,,449,4.506172839506172
5510203,5,B00AU577VA,"This was absolutely great. At times it might seem to drag, but that is the way their lives are. Hard to make committments and decisions. Great attractive cast. Good laughs with a little lesson in Korean culture once more. I don't think an American relationship would make so much of a 20 year old affair.....one that occured 20 years prior. I don't think our society would ban a person for this especially in the circumstances that happen in this series. No I will not tell. I hate people who talk too much and give away a story line and plot. Watch it and find out. Thanks Amazon for increasing your Korean library. Please continue to do so.",1386806400,,642,4.495726495726496
5510204,5,B00AU577VA,Loved - loved - loved it!!!!  I had never seen anyone in it but they were awesome.  I have to say it has the BEST engagement scene I have seen in any  K-drama.

5510205,5,B00AU577VA,"Love.... Love....Love this korean drama. Story of four crazy guys who were best of friends since high school, were all successful and each had a wacky romantic story to tell. I am a sucker for romantic comedy and this has all the ingredients for a good laugh. It's a male version of sex in the city I should say. Just watch it!",1379808000,,327,4.290322580645161

5510207,5,B00AU577VA,"I first watched this k-drama (Korean drama) online, waiting each week for new episodes to air, so I knew before I purchased the DVD set that I liked the storyline, the characters, etc. However, despite several sets with great subtitles, I own three sets of k-drama DVDs that have less-than-stellar English subs; how would this set compare?

Quite well. The subs differ slightly from the ones I read online, but that's to be expected, as there are different translators, but overall the subs are solid. (Yeah, expect a misspelling here or there, but that's nothin'.)

Enough with the technical details, what about the story? I'm glad you asked! ;)

The writing is witty and grownup, despite some of the childish behavior the characters might display from time to time -- gentlemanly dignity is something they possess a little and must learn a lot before the story ends. There's humor here, some of it snort-out-loud funny, but also more serious mature situations -- no sex scenes, but adult concerns: jobs, relationships, single parenthood (later in the story), grief, family, fidelity, and so on. This isn't a romantic comedy aimed at teenagers or twentysomethings; this is for forty-year-olds and older (despite some of the adolescent behavior displayed by a 24-year-old character (sister of one of the men), as well as by the men a time or two.

I appreciated the honesty of the characters' emotions. One woman, a golfer, is combative with everyone, but even she becomes truthful about her true feelings. Her roommate, a teacher and the female lead in the story, has to tell herself the truth first before admitting it to the man she loves. One of the men, married to a slightly older and far wealthier woman, must overcome his flirty nature and show his wife that not only does he love her and only her, but that he's faithful in every way; actions must match words, enabling her to believe him. There are blurts of honesty (ones the characters didn't intend), and sometimes honesty spoken only when someone leaves the room.

Misunderstandings and jerk behavior are resolved as the characters smooth each other's rough edges, decide what they care about most, and learn they're not as grownup as they thought they were.

All the while, there's humor, interesting side stories, and everyday life going on. Oh, yeah, and romance! It's messy but funny, and -- despite the k-drama tropes and the utter fiction -- it feels real.

I highly recommend this series, and this particular DVD set:

The subtitles are a little off on the English expressions, and if 2 people are talking, the 2nd person is on top rather than underneath, and sometimes they can be a bit quick.
