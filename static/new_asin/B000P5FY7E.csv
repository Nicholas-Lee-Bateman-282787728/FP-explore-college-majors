The remaining races have traveled planet to planet in search of the foretold savior. They found a feral boy named Age. Age is the one who can free the galaxy from the rule of the Silver Tribe.

This anime is visually stunning. There are so many beautiful scenes and backgrounds. The story is very good too. It is similar to a Star Wars type of sci-fi story. There are many compelling characters, with good voice actors to boot. I was very surprised by this anime. If you have seen Dragonaut and liked it then you will definitely like Heroic Age. I highly recommend this anime.",1354665600,,703,4.4921875
8189060,5,B000P5FY7E,"Alright people,

Because I will be the one to review an anime that I just finished watching (and I mean all of it thanks to where I live) and these series might most probably come to the US after a year or something (hopefully earlier) I will try to give you an overall picture of this wonderful series. Just keep in mind that the creator of Heroic Age was able to surpass his previous masterpiece called Fafner.

To begin with, if you are into harem anime series or lighthearted ones and so forth, than avoid this one cause it is not meant for such an audience. But, if on the other hand, you prefer anime series that include kick a** action, top notch animation, great soundtrack, a solid and a strong story with many twists in it, very good acting, outer space, power games, romance and of course mechas than this series is highly recommended for you (not to mention the fact that this series does manage to break away from your typical known mecha type stories).

Now to the story of this series:
Originally the story is heavily based on ancient Greek mythology centering on the Argonauts campaigns, Hercules and his labors, and on the cosmogony, according to the sagas of ancient Greek philosophers such as Hesiod (pronounced more accurately - in Greek - Isiodos); that is why some members of the Argonaut have ancient Greek names such as Iolaus who will become best friends with Age (pronounced Eigi), the main protagonist and who resembles more Hercules based on the labors he has to fulfill (based on the mythology Iolaus and Hercules were best friends as well). The main female protagonist is the princess called Dianeira and leader of the Argonaut (which again based on the mythology was Hercules wife).

The story starts of as follows:
At first there was once a primeval race who called itself the Golden Race and possessed many powers such as creating planets and foresee the future. They then called on primitive beings far across the galaxy and told them to explore the universe. Three races were able to reply to to reply to their call and the Golden Race referred to those as the Silver Race, the Bronze Race, and the Heroic Race. Long after, just as the Golden Race was about to move on to another universe, a new race replied to their call. The newcomer, was referred to as the Iron Race, basically us humans.

Due to their extraordinary powers and aggressive nature, the titanic beings known as the Heroic Race instigated an interstellar civil war and caused the destruction of thousands of planets and stars. The expanding ruin angered the Golden Race, and forced them to capture and punish the surviving five members of the Heroic Race for the destruction they had caused. Caught in a magical cage, they were subdued and condemned to serve races weaker than them. Reduced to the state of diamond-like stones, they were given to five individuals, who were then referred to as Nodos (imagine it something like that these (almost immmortal) five people have extraordinary powers in their human form but are also able to transform to supper giant kick a** mechas). The Heroic Race member, Bellcross , entered the body of a boy from the Iron Race, and became known as the fifth Nodos (which are: Age for the human race and who has to fulfill 12 labors, while Karkinos - Mehitak, Lecty and Yuty serve the Silver Tribe and have to fulfill 4,3,5 and 8 labors accordingly) . The child was directly raised by the Golden Race on the ruined planet, Oron, in order to fulfill a prophecy passed down by the Iron Race's royal family.
It was then that the Golden Race issued prophecies to each Race (Iron and Silver) who possessed a Nodos, telling them that they could make contracts with those exceptional beings and allowed both parties to draw a specific number of clauses, called Labors. In the Iron Race's case, there are twelve conditions, the famous Twelve Labors of Hercules, assigned to a yet to be found, lone human announced as their new messiah: a teenager named: Age.
However, soon after they came into play in the equation, the Iron Race's homeworld, Earth, was attacked by several dozen hives from the Bronze Race. The local population was exterminated and the planet conquered, forcing the survivors to emigrate towards safer parts of the universe. It was later revealed that the attack had been staged by the Silver Race, who ruled over the insect-like Bronze Race. To this day, the Iron Race is still greatly endangered by the combined forces of the Silver and Bronze Races and, although its new homeworld is still ensconced in a relative sense of safety and secrecy, its survival, however, is only guaranteed by this stealthiness, as the difference of power between the youngest race (Iron race - Humans) and the others is still too great (Silver Race and Bronze Race).
This is the main setting. As the story progesses eyecatching battles will be faught all across the galaxy, humans will be chased and cornered in desperated fights, humans fighting back, romance will evolve among the main protagonists, no matter the tribes ( with the exception of the Bronce Tribe which resembles more insects alike creatures), endless deaths will be inevitable, mecha fights - besides the Nodos - will occur and people will switch sides. To be more exact, a `black-white' situation does not exist. And while the Argonaut is trying to reach the final destination that will lead to the Golden Tribe back again and end the galactic war, Age and the Princes alongside with their friends will have to fight like hell to survive. Especially when the Nodos will fight each other destruction is inevitable; and when they enter the so called mental chaos - Berserk like condition - they cannot distinguish among friend or enemy and entire systems will go staight done to hell.
To sum up the series it is a top notch animation and action packed romance adventure story caught in the midst of a mercyless galactic war for survival and will make you jump forth and back on your seats because of the emotional rollercauster you will undergo for the main protagonists.
As a final memorandum, because I don't know when this series will reach the US or Europe I cannot tell you what extras the DVDs will have (something that is impossible at this point in time). All that is left to say is that the series is accompanied by a great soundtrack and that I do highly recommend it!!!",1209600000,,6374,4.7284172661870505
