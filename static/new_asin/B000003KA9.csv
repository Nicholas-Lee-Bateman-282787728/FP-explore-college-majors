7902614,5,B000003KA9,"In Episode 33, ""Meld"" (Story by Michael Sussman, Teleplay by Michael Piller, Aired February 5, 1996), ""Star Trek: Voyager"" finally gets around to really dealing with Tuvok (Tim Russ) as a Vulcan.  A crewmember is found dead in Engineering and the Doctor (Robert Picardo) discovers he was murdered.  As Security Officer Tuvok investigates and his suspicions fall upon Suder (Brad Dourif), one of the Maquis.  When physical evidence points to his guilt, Suder confesses, explaining that he killed the other man because ""I didn't like the way he looked at me.""  This motivation does not compute to Tuvok, who continues to interrogate Suder about the murder.  But when Suder cannot explain his violent outburst he agrees to let Tuvok do the good old mind meld.  The Vulcan not only wants to understand this act of violence but hopes that some of his sense of self-discipline will help Suder to control himself in the future.  Of course as we all know from Picard's legendary mind meld with Sarek, such exchanges go in both directions.
""Meld,"" as you would expect, comes down to the performances of both Tim Russ and Brad Dourif.  Obviously Russ gets to really brake out of the straight laced mold into which Tuvok is poured, but Dourif, one of the great psychotics of recent vintage, is almmost as important to the story.  Yes, I would agree that Tuvok should have expected some of the risks to himself in attempting this particular mind meld, but as ""Star Trek: Enterprise"" has repeatedly reminded us, your average Vulcans are extremely arrogant people (and underscoring that Spock was only half-Vulcan).  Consequently, Tuvok's sense of self could well contain this tragic flaw, although with all his interactions with humans on ""Voyager"" he really should have known better.  In the final analysis, ""Meld"" is an above average episode on the strength of the memorable performances more than the storyline, but the stor",1058659200,,1914,4.987421383647798
7902615,4,B000003KA9,"B'Elanna and Ensign Hogan investigate a problem with the warp drive and when B'Elanna goes to check it out, she discovers the dead body of a crewman.  What at first appears to be an accident turns out to be murder.  Evidence points to Ensign Suder and he is interrogated by Tuvok, who has taken charge of the investigation.  Suder seemingly proves his innocence until the doctor discovers DNA on the dead body of the crewman and the DNA turns out to be Suder's.  When he realizes he is caught, Suder confesses to the murder.  Tuvok asks him why he committed the murder and Suder replies that he had no reason.  Tuvok is not satisfied with this answer because to his Vulcan mind, every crime has a logical purpose, an established motive.  The Vulcan decides to mind meld with Suder so he can understand why Suder killed the crewman.  Suder agrees to the meld in hopes that the meld will somehow help him to control his violent tendencies.  The meld has an adverse effect on Tuvok however, which makes him gradually violent like Suder.  Suder, in the meantime, has finally found some peace as a result of the meld.  Tuvok tries to control his violent thoughts but is unsuccessful.  He returns to Suder and while talking with him, Suder realizes that the violent impulses have found their way into Tuvok.  Tuvok also realizes that he is about to lose control, locks himself in his quarters and notifies the captain that he is unfit for duty.  When the captain talks to Tuvok, she realizes how dangerous he has become.  Tuvok is transported to sick bay where the doctor tries desparately to cure him before he sinks too far into his dementia.
This is a very good Tuvok episode as it shows the dark side of the Vulcans, as they used to be. Tim Russ always did a wonderful job of portraying Tuvok and he really outdoes himself in this episode. We get to see Tuvok not only with emotions, but violent emotions. Brad Dourif does a fantastic job of portraying Ensign Suder! If you're a Tuvok and/or Vulcan fan, this is a must see episode. Note: The character of Ensign Suder will re-surface in 'Basics.'",1034640000,,2094,4.576407506702413
7902616,4,B000003KA9,"This is great episode of Voyager, and I'd highly recommend it - especially to fans of the character of Tuvok.  Tim Russ does some of his best acting to-date in this episode, and is matched perfectly with the violent psychopath who cannot control his urges.
This episode also gives one pause to think about some very important issues facing us today.  What to do with violent individuals who cannot control themselves?  How do some violent offenders live with themselves?  Do they struggle at all with their violent urges?  Interesting questions to consider, and some consideration is given to those questions here.
All in all, a strong episode for Tuvok and an opportunity to think.",996019200,,682,4.947368421052632
