4464852,5,B004SYA84M,"Apparently this is based on a super famous novel. I haven't read it. I'm actually a fan of the director Anh Hung Tran (Scent of Green Papaya). Anyway, I bought this DVD/CD set with no real expectations since I hadn't really heard anything about it and was blown away. The story is amazing, and the combination of the hypnotically mesmerizing cinematography and breathtaking mountainous landscapes with commendable cast performances put the film over the top. This is a movie about life, and relationships, but is done with cinematic flair rarely seen. The soundtrack adds to the experience, and its a nice touch that the original movie soundtrack comes in this set separately. It has some amazing pieces on it. This DVD plays just fine here in the USA.",1317081600,26,752,4.8828125

4464854,4,B004SYA84M,"'Norwegian Wood' has a triple value. First of all, it's the name of a famous Beatles-song from 1965. Second, in 1987 Japanese author Haruki Murakami wrote his very succesful novel 'Norwegian Wood', admitting to be greatly inspired by this song's mood. And third, in 2010 Murakami's story served to make this film.

Set in the Japan of 1969, the plot of 'Norwegian Wood' deals with an adolescent guy having more or less fortunate relationships with several girls of his own age. While closely following Murakami's book, the film's story is presented in a steady Japanese pace that may appear unusual to you. Anyway, you are allowed plenty of time to follow all its developments. Its way of telling is intimately but never sentimental - having the bottomline that life must be lived to its very end.

The acting in 'Norwegian Wood' is true Japanese high-quality. Unfortunately it makes a somewhat sad contrast to this film's picturing: one cannot figure out if there wasn't enough money available, or if the director deliberately applied 1969 shooting-methods for authenticity.",1301443200,5,1075,5.1022727272727275

4464857,4,B004SYA84M,"Beautifully filmed. I can't say I agree fully with the interpretation of the romance with Naoko, but that can be chalked up to the interpretation of the individual. I do feel they missed the mark on Reiko. By not focusing on her earlier in the movie it made the ending feel awkward and weird instead of beautiful which is how I saw it in the book. I also feel they miswrote her character and drained the story of some of the humor and fun the Reiko brought to it. The films strong suit was the beautiful shots, especially of the landscape, which I presume took place in Japan although I'm not sure. If you read the book I think the movie is worth watching at least to see a visual representation but almost no movie can outshine a book, especially a Murakami. I also feel like if you haven't read the book the movie is not going to make quite as much sense because it feels like a lot of the scenes are disjointed and only a person who read the book would know how they fit together.",1462233600,,983,4.23404255319149
4464858,2,B004SYA84M,"The film version of Murakami's most realistic and reality-based work sadly disappointed me, and I don't think it did a good job of capturing the beauty of Murakami's writing.

Of course, this would be a tall order for any film director, as Murakami is a singularly imaginative and talented writer. But, Norwegian Wood, is one of his most straightforward works - without his typical forays into magical realism and alternate realities. In fact, it is a relatively straightforward coming of age story, relying heavily on the internal struggles of the main characters for the dramatics.

While there were some beautifully composed scenes in this film, many of which were captured in the satisfying trailer for the film, I found the full feature to be slow, a bit boring, and not captivating. If you've read this novel, avoid watching this film - it won't live up to your expectations.",1459382400,,881,4.945945945945946

4464865,3,B004SYA84M,"Read the wonderful novel first, then watched film. This lead to a huge disappointment. The film is calm and beautiful and based on a very powerful story. But the film misses out on some of the best moods and small plot details of the book. I would say that it is rather tone deaf. The book has quite a bit or humor, which could easily have been included in the film, but is left out. The film is very somber and dark, lacking in the wit that makes Murakami a great novelist. The film also strikes me as rather prudish and conservative in the way it deals with some of the love scenes and dialogue. It is like a Murakami novel that has been heavily censored. One positive in the film is that it does attend to the beauty of natural landscapes as a backdrop.",1441238400,,756,4.220689655172414

4464868,3,B004SYA84M,"Murakami wrote this book having no idea that it would become a best seller in Japan and force him to flee the country because of his reluctance to become a media celebrity.  This is probably his most ""straight ahead"" or realist novel within his arsenal.  Upon publication, Japanese teenagers were overwhelmed with Murakami's love story and at the same time, traditional Japanese literary intellectuals hated it.  To this day, Murakami remains an outsider in these circles in spite of his numerous literary awards and international success.  As an older reader, the book and subsequent lame movie have little to no interest to me.  But, it is written by Murakami so you can't avoid it if you want to be a completist.",1430697600,,715,4.87603305785124

4464871,3,B004SYA84M,"I'm giving this film 3 stars, for beautiful scenes and doing the best with what it could on a limited time frame for a film. The book of course, is significantly more enjoyable. That's a clich line that everyone says about books to film, but in this scenario it is true in my opinion. Haruki Murakami, the author of the novel this film is based on, is in my opinion an expert on characters. He has characters I simply get lost in and those characters provide witty lines and thoroughly enjoyable dialogue.

This film however, couldn't provide the time to devote to each of these characters. For example, one character, Stormtrooper, is shown twice in the film. Once waking up the main character and wanting to exercise with him and then once, examining nose hairs. However in the book, he hands Toru a firefly that he caught in a jar. Toru, feeling situational melancholy, releases the firefly on the roof of the dorms in a scene I simply would have loved to view in the film. Stormtrooper leaves the dorm shortly there after, about the time when Toru is beginning to feel more and more alone. There's also Reiko who, though present in the film, is a very enjoyable character who gets heavily overlooked here. She cracked me up laughing with her dialogue in the book.

Again I don't fault the film, it's always hard to match a book to film and sometimes it isn't the best thing to do. But in all honesty, had I not read the book, I probably would have enjoyed the film more.",1429142400,3,1474,4.496268656716418

4464875,2,B004SYA84M,"The movie, though faithful to the story line of the novel version, is however less enjoyable to follow. It was hard to care for any of the characters or their situations and stay engaged. Some types of stories and works are better suited to specific mediums.
 The cerebral aspect of the storytelling is what kept the novel version interesting for me.  However this type of cerebralism ripe for the novel medium is difficult to carry over into film because it's difficult to show interiority in movies unless there's constant voiceover, which would get annoying. The lack of emotion and lack of interiority in the movie were distancing and I could not find myself caring about these people or their situations.",1420329600,,709,4.9

Certain details were omitted and changed to fit into the time, and it was still a long film, but the photography and direction really brought this story to life and highlighted the emotions of the story. I think that having recently absorbed the novel made the film easy to understand and I would recommend that the book be read first if possible. The best part of the book was the strong character development and not having this as a primer might take away some of the power of the movie.",1411084800,4,624,4.3418803418803416

4464881,3,B004SYA84M,"Japanese movie that takes place in the 60s. The movie seemed so promising but it lacked depth. Torus best friend commits suicide (we don't know why) and he is devastated but moves on and goes to college. One day he runs into Naoka who is his best friends ex-girlfriend. They start seeing each other and have sex. Toru finds that Naoka is a virgin and is shocked that she didn't have sex with his best friend before. Naoka is upset by the comment and disappears after the night. Weeks later Toru finds out that Naoka is at a sanitarium, they write letters, and soon he visits her. Her mental issues are complex and she is staying at the sanitarium long term, and wants Toru to wait for her. He agrees, but he soon falls for another girl at school. They have a platonic relationship because he wants to be faithful to Naoka. I want to point out that one of the turn offs is the overdone emotional responses. The sex scene between Naoka and Toru was not graphic but it had enough moaning for a porn film. More awkward than authentic. Eventually Naoka commits suicide and he gets with the new girl and his life moves on even tho he loses two people in his life. End of story. If the auteur focused less on making it dramatic and kept it lighter I think it would have been a better movie. Instead his insistence to maintain a certain mood left me disatisfied.",1392595200,,1354,4.376984126984127

But not near as great as Departures or Shall We Dance. Both very different movies, granted, butI enjoyed it, but didn't have the transcendence of the aforementioned films or just as a movie can be really fabulous.",1384819200,,341,4.796610169491525
4464885,3,B004SYA84M,"I have a love/hate relationship with this movie which splits it neatly in half, I loved the first half and hated the second.

First I want to say the cinematography, design, ambiance, and particularly the casting were excellent in this movie. However, limitations of the script leave several characters as only shells of their book-counterparts. Hatsumi, Reiko, and believe it or not our main character Toru are the biggest victims of a script which was unwilling to fully recognize its source material. Toru has many whimsical and funny lines in the book which are cut in favor of a deadpan, always serious, awkward, and uncomfortable image portrayed in the film.

I understand that a director must make some decisions regarding interpretation to turn a book into a reasonable length movie, but some of the creative license taken in this film are completely at odds with the book. Here again, Reiko is totally screwed. Her final interactions with Toru share only the most basic resemblance with those in the book, which are MUCH more positive and lead to a MUCH brighter ending. In fact the entire second half of the movie, largely due to an overly oppressive screeching violin soundtrack, pulls the viewer into some kind of nightmare depression when in actuality the story should never really shift in tone. It has all the feel of melting clocks and screaming heads, as if the viewers themselves have lost control and are slowing going crazy. This is an extreme stylistic choice the director makes which I thought was pretty detrimental. The plot at this point should be thoughtful and introspective, not a roadtrip through crazytown.

Although the dialogue is fairly true to its source, a few lines, particularly in the interactions of Naoko and Toru, really gave me problems. Toru has a pivotal decision which comes up again and again in the story. His, and Naoko's, feelings on the decision are ambiguous. However, the director adds a single scene in which Naoko shouts some brand new dialogue, and this really forces the viewer down a single interpretation. It turns a thought-provoking work into a spoon-fed movie. And the interpretation offered was trash in my opinion. This happens again a few times throughout, and again, it manages to screw over Reiko's character once more before the end.

As critical as I am, I really did like the vision this movie offered. It is gratifying to see, in film, a depiction which so well matched my own. It may be a testament to the author's ability, but it must also have required great effort by the filmmaker. As a stand alone film, I would possibly rate it higher, but as a rendition of a book I love, it is just passable.",1376524800,,2670,4.835886214442013
4464886,4,B004SYA84M,"Film keeps you focused on how some persons have a hard time dealing with death and some never get over it. To be fair, it is an interesting film which keeps the viewer interested. Best part is that it kept me guessing as what will happen next.",1370649600,,243,4.191489361702128
4464887,1,B004SYA84M,"What a terrible shame!

As a huge fan of Murakami I was really looking forward to a film version of his seminal work. Alas, alas, Tran Anh Hung appears not to have either read the book or understood it if he had. Although some of the cinematography was gorgeous, there was little that really conveyed a sense of 1960's Japan, specifically in Tokyo at the time of the student riots - a shot of some protestors marching down the street does not an atmosphere make. The novel is also chock full of wit and whimsy, so much so that a half-way decent script writer would have danced with joy at being presented with the task of turning into a movie. Sadly, this film's script writer has failed miserably to latch onto the buzz. For me, Murakami is the nearest thing the Japanese have to a Beat poet. His style has an edgy, jazz feel to it that is all too often missing from the film. All the obsessive strangeness from the page is missing too. Another reviewer praised the characterisation of Midori - I cannot agree with this. In the novel Midori is a very interesting girl with some rather striking views and behaviours. Virtually all absent here, for instance - the poignant balcony/dinner/kissing scene while Midori and Watanabe watch a nearby house fire should have been an easy spot for a good filmmaker to pick as a filmic moment.

Overall, all the characters emerge as shallow, almost shadows of their penned selves. Such a pity.

Note: the other Murakami adaptation I have seen is Tony Takitani, which, while somewhat tedious, at least captures the intent of the story from which it springs. Ultimately this author needs a director with vision, a scriptwriter who understands the hook of ideas, actors that are not one-dimensional, and a cameraman that sees past the simple beauty of the landscape to more haunting landscapes of the human soul under strain.",1369612800,,1860,4.699386503067485

4464890,4,B004SYA84M,"I am a big fan of Murakami and have looked forward to seeing this movie ever since I first heard the announcement of its production.  Norwegian Wood is Murakami's most-loved book and adapting this masterpiece to the screen is a challenge that I'm not sure anyone would want to undertake because you are bound to disappoint just about everyone.

I found the movie to be absolutely gorgeous. The soundtrack was amazing. The actors all captured the characters the way I always imagined them to be.

However, despite my love of the novel, and the casting and direction of the movie, I felt that at times I was watching the events in the event as though separated by soundproof glass...the actions were visible but I (at times) failed to catch the emotions (good and bad) of the book.  The characters seemed separated from the viewer, almost as if the viewers were Kizuki watching from beyond the grave.

While Rinko Kikuchi is the biggest name in this film (she was Babel and got nominated for an Academy Award for said movie, making her the second Japanese female to have that happen and the only living one) I think the male lead really steals show.",1354924800,2,598,4.396396396396397
4464895,5,B004SYA84M,"Incredibly so, after about a century of movies production ""Norwegian Wood"" might be the first one that realistically shows human sexuality by focusing on its problems and deviations. Virtually all movies flat out ignore the prosaic but still severe pains of human sexuality by portraying it as something too easy to do and enjoy anywhere, in private and public (in an elevator, in shopping malls' dressing rooms, behind restaurant tables, etc.). Those scenes have been a male perspective, we -men- reach orgasm far easier than women, and even then movies have far exaggerated its easiness. And by those mean they have severely distorted the sexual expectations of whole generations starting in their youth (along with parents who couldn't tell their children that the media was lying to them)

This is the first movie showing me a female perspective by focusing a lot on the character Naoko, her trauma and struggle to enjoy sexual pleasure. There are many ideas about how much of such pleasure women need, but it's a fact that sex is a rather frequent problem in many relations (maybe in most, but it's kept hidden) everywhere literally and also fact that many men may go insane without such pleasure. This was Naoko's situation, indeed.

It should be a scandal that it's been only until now that one director bothered to approach this issue. Ultimately, movie directors mostly follow the crowds. Right here, it's only me pointing Naoko's frigidity. Everyone else has focused in the same old, same old topic in almost all fiction works: death, death, death and some additional comments on the movie's sexiness, smartness, and the like in this much ignored movie. Well, you'll get to see a corpse here, happy?

The movie surely has more characters and topics, still revolving around sex. This is not a XXX movie at all, though; don't expect many racy scenes. But many of the soul-feeding landscapes scenes might make up for it (at least they did for me). It was comforting that virtually all of the characters were rather plain looking rather than the typical very handsome actors that movies show.",1353283200,,2098,4.954545454545454
4464896,2,B004SYA84M,"Let me start out first by saying I am a HUGE fan of Haruki Murakami. I have read pretty much all of his translated works and even one in Japanese.

Maybe for a non-fan, this is a good movie. I don't know. But as a huge fan of his works and of Norwegian Wood in particular, I found this movie to be flat and utterly disappointing. Murakami's Norwegian Wood is a poignant, dreamy work full of subtleties. The emotions he wrote of so vividly were not captured in the film. In addition, Murakami's prose is smooth and flowing, and his masterful rendering of each scene is something to be enjoyed. Instead, the movie is choppy, awkward and abrupt with stilted, forceful acting.

In addition, at risk of sounding like some sort of sex fiend, the sexuality of this movie was not compelling AT ALL. One thing Norwegian Wood is known for is its eroticism and frankly the sex/sexual tension in this movie was utterly boring.

All in all, aside from having characters of the same name who do vaguely the same things as the book, this movie was nothing like Murakami's masterpiece. I was so so excited for this movie but I just couldn't like it at all.",1347408000,9,1140,4.471153846153846
4464897,5,B004SYA84M,"This film surprised me quite a bit. I found myself drawn to the unfolding angst of finding your way in love as depicted by the main character. The setting of Japan in the 60s as well as the cultural web of interactions from a student's perspective were definitely interesting. I found the characters somewhat cool and non-expressive, but I am not sure if that is linked to the directions/acting or the cultural norms existing in Japan. Regardless, I was intrigued.  The director did an amazing job with the emotional scenes between individuals with wonderful close-ups of faces as well as (quite often) haunting backdrops of nature revolving through the seasons. I thought the film was quite enchanting in its own unique fashion depicting the complex path of finding one's way through the maze of attachments and deep connections in the maelstrom of humanity. I never read the novel the film is based on, but if you are looking for an excellent contemporary film taking place in Japan I would definitely recommend ""Norwegian Wood"".",1340668800,,1031,4.959537572254336

Well ... that blurb may describe the book but it has nothing to do with this film. I carry a bunch of love for that song and it does bring with it a great sense of nostalgia. Somebody paid somebody a bunch of money to play that song over the end credits, that's all. There isn't any real sense of nostalgia in the film except for some of the fashion and the big telephones.

Greenwood's soundtrack might be interesting to listen to by itself but in the film all the lilting strings sound bombastic. I literally muted the film several times it annoyed me so much. I don't think this is Greenwood's problem, though. Tran has been known to over-saturate a film or two with torturing soundtracks (The Scent of Green Papaya, I'm looking at you). Ping Bin Lee did come through. There are many breathtakingly beautiful scenes in the film, a few of which played silently for me because of the soundtrack's habit of stomping all over the film.

I'm not a fan Rinko Kikuchi's acting, Babel notwithstanding. I've seen her in a handful of films and while she gets some moments right, she often brings too much of her international star self to roles (even before she had it, which is an achievement) and I struggle to see a character beyond her personality. She whispers a lot, which is a phony way to be dramatic used by people, strangely, desirous of attention. Fortunately she is only half the focus of the film. Texas born Kiko Mizuhara is awesome as the main ""other"" girl, Midori, in Toru's life. She's cute, spunky, forward, sexually confident and blunt, but comes off as merely an outline of a character. I wish the whole film were about her. Ken'ichi Matsuyama, as Toru, is serviceable as the supposedly nostalgic one but hardly awesome enough to be a guy that three different girls just have to sleep with. Gorgeous Eriko Hatsune has a nearly film-stealing scene but that's all we see of her.

The film contains some rather bold, and funny at the same time, sexual dialog. I loved it and laughed when Midori calls up Toru and says ""My dad died. Will you take me to a porno film? The most perverse one."" She also has a few moments describing to Toru how she'd like to be bedded by him, which are entertaining. Kikuchi's Naoko, after letting Toru know that she's too crazy with despair to sleep with him asks him if it's torture to have an unserviced erection: ""I can help with that"", she then inexplicably offers. There is a good bit of sadness and mixed up desire in the film but the characters and the story aren't developed enough to see it as more than young angst.

I think this film will appeal to teenagers and twenty-somethings who've read the Haruki Murakami novel because most of the holes in the film will be filled in and a sense of nostalgia might be there. Not that teenagers have a lot of nostalgia for the sixties but the film is about loss, and the film is fairly good at presenting that---except the adolescent level of it is pretty thin. The film is NOT about the way things were---the last few wonderful lines of the film and a Beatles tune can't save it. It's just a young-love story which lacks the depth to appeal to those not feeling the same way already. Young people experiencing the whirlwind of sexual awakening, and/or those who've had a friend commit suicide, will love it.

Norwegian Wood is a great looking film but not very well written or acted, and since it is also quite slow moving I don't think it will engage general audiences who haven't read the book. It's not sexy enough nor smart enough.",1337644800,4,3929,4.551626591230551

4464900,4,B004SYA84M,"This is an interesting study of a young man who is entangled in the unhappiness of others. Due to loyalty to his friends, he almost forgoes any chance for his own happiness. It is well worth watching and the music (somewhat quirky, which is not unusual for an Anh Hung Tran film) and cinematography are excellent. However, you may have to watch this alone if you need the subtitles, or don't have a friend that likes dark movies. I would have given it 4 1/2 stars if I was able. It is not a perfect movie although it it very good. It is probably the best movie I have seen recently and is by far better than anything from Hollywood.",1334102400,5,632,4.275

4464902,2,B004SYA84M,"Okay seriously this is not that great of a movie. The characters were bland and unemotional. The overall mood of the movie was very creepy and at times awkward. In a nutshell the movie's plot is about horny sexually frustrated youth in their early 20s set in the 1960s. They never really explained the importance of the song ""Norwegian Wood"" in the movie although they did play it in the end credits.

Plus the dvd that I received came with very bad English subtitles thus making the movie even more incomprehensible.

Stick with the book and avoid this movie.",1323820800,,560,4.646464646464646

I would not call this a movie more a guilty pleasure for those who want a beautiful cinematography from the books narrative. I felt some characters were not well developed enough. Some scenarios were changed which I felt they could have added if they would have cut the scenes where he goes and visits Naoko. The ending scene I felt was lack luster as we didn't even get the happy funeral that lead to the love making of the haruki and reiko. I wish they could have added the porn flick with midori and the cucumber scene. The director should have done a better job of highlighting the fact that midori is 'life' and thus was a key element in the book.
