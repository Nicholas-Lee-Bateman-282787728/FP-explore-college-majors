8341769,1,B001TK2A2Q,"I am sure Mr. Nutter is great as a Feng Shui consultant, but a teacher he is not.  The DVD is a poor recording of an in-class event (possible at a trade show, since he keeps referring to the Booth number he is at).

The presentation felt very disconnected....after an introduction to the three different kinds of Feng Shui, it was a mix of answering specific questions from audience members and general coverage of some areas of the Bagua.

He frequently starts a sentence, only to interrupt himself and start another one. Very hard to follow for someone new to these concepts.

Overall this CD left me very confused.  I watched Alice Inoue's ""Feng Shui Demystified"" the same afternoon and got a much better basic intro to Feng Shui from her.",1257552000,4,742,4.633587786259542
