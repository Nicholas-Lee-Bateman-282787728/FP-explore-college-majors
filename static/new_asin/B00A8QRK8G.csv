5401099,5,B00A8QRK8G,"Page is an expert guide to the voice. Her insight and experience, combined with her engaging delivery of information, makes for a video that I can return to again and again. The video offers a variety of useful warm ups and vocal exercises that address a range of vocal issues and help to keep my voice in shape. The work is specific, but also quite adaptable, for times when I want to target a particular vocal need or have limited time to spend on my warm-up practice. This video is a great ""take-out, take away"" version of her classes, perfect for when I'm working on the road or living away from the city. I understand my own voice; its needs, strengths, and quirks, better now, using entry points and information Page provides. Page understands the relationship of the voice and body and finds skilled ways to purposefully connect them.  The video provides clear tools of study and support and her encouragement prompts me to do the work in ongoing, rather than onerous, ways.  I've had the great good fortune to take class from Page and to experience the positive outcomes that using her vocal warm ups and exercises provide. As a professional actor I will always want to study with Page- and with this video I can.",1368576000,,1221,4.622119815668203
5401100,5,B00A8QRK8G,"My daily routine includes one of Page's great warmups. They help me to open up my voice, relax and focus, but most importantly to UNDERSTAND my voice. No arbitrary exercises. Page's soothing and confident voice takes you through a relaxing and energetic set of exercises geared towards understanding your body and how it relates to the voice and your surroundings. I don't just feel warmed up afterwards, but educated and self-assured.
She also has some very insightful videos included which are specific to certain problems, i.e. screaming without hurting your throat, or finding musicality in your speech.
I also do this warmup when I'm feeling tired. The stretching and breath work energizes and inspires me for the rest of the day!!

Get this DVD, for your sake and the sake of anyone who has to listen to you! ;-)",1359590400,,818,4.884892086330935

8548443,5,B00A8QRK8G,"I both work with Public Speakers as a voice and accent coach, and have used these techniques before my own speaking engagements. The exercised are easy to understand and implement in any situation. Even the most seasoned speakers need a vocal warm up routine, which is so often overlooked. Page understands the power of voice and breath, and I would recommend this CD to anyone!",1464220800,,378,4.8307692307692305

She's very clear and professional and I love the section for specific problems. It is great to be able to look up a specific issue I'm having with an actor and have a very clear, simple solution that really works.",1460246400,,380,4.7727272727272725

8548446,5,B00A8QRK8G,Page is an incredible vocal coach.  I went from having a voice that literally used to put people to sleep to nailing an audition that was all about vocal power - thanks to Page's work.  Her warm-ups are essential for any public speaker or actor or anyone who needs (or wants) to be able to 'own' a room effortlessly with the voice.  I can't recommend her work enough!,1426464000,,367,4.367647058823529
8548447,5,B00A8QRK8G,"Page Clements' ""Vocal Warmups & Exercises for Actors"" has been very helpful as I just (nervously) entered a rehearsal process after a hiatus.
The warm-ups are wonderful for getting me centered and thinking about breath (something so simple and yet so often neglected!)  I find the tips which address an array of specific problems very helpful. (In fact, these tips may serve to alert us to 'habits' we have or may fall into.)  Most of all, I enjoy the encouragement Page offers as she shares her wisdom.

8548448,5,B00A8QRK8G,"One of the easiest and most thorough approaches to a proper use of voice. Comes with her full warm-up, and the short quickie version you can do last minute. The essential vocal warm-up tool for any actor, speaker or performer. Am a 35 year professional actor in theatre and film. I used this daily as a warm-up before reporting on set for a major feature for Disney, as well as day-of warmups before stage shows. Can only give it my highest recommendation. A must-have for every actors portable tool kit, whether for theatre or film, or public speaking.",1389312000,,553,4.653061224489796
8548449,5,B00A8QRK8G,"This video shows very simple exercises but very effective for vocal strength.
I myself as an actress use this video, and feel much more stronger actress.
Because actors need to tell a story, and if audience can't hear you, there's no point to be on stage or on camera. She shows you how to breathe and control your voice. And once you know how to control your breathe, you will gain your confidence.",1370822400,,399,4.47945205479452
8548450,5,B00A8QRK8G,"I have only been using this DVD for a week and have already started to notice the benefits! There are three warm ups to choose from, depending on the amount of time you have, and as a result I have been able to fit some kind of warm up into my routine every day. The warm ups are all very effective, and I can feel a change in my voice after each one, even the five minute warm up makes a real difference. The best thing for me is the greater amount of focus and relaxation I am able to achieve with Page as a guide, as opposed to warming up my voice on my own, and this has already contributed to a stronger and more deeply resonant sound, and increased breath support. The ""Common Vocal Issues"" section allows me to add additional exercises specific to my own needs, and this gives my routine variation, which helps to keep my interest. Whether a beginning or experienced actor I would highly recommend Page's DVD as a tool to help you to develop your voice.",1369008000,,960,4.251366120218579
