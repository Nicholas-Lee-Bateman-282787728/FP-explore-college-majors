3761226,5,B001PU8N0S,"The first few Lovejoy seasons were great, but by Seasons 3-4 it was getting tired, and script writing became exceedingly poor.  But if you're a Lovejoy fan you can purchase Season 5 with confidence because it is the best of all five seasons.  A few of the characters have departed, and a few new ones have been added to the team.  At first we were disappointed at the loss of Lady Felsham, but after a couple episodes we were over it and couldn't wait to view the next segment. With Season-5 the show is the best ever and the writing is stellar.",1244160000,2,545,4.323529411764706
3761227,4,B001PU8N0S,"Season 5 of the Lovejoy series sees two old friends moving on and two new faces coming onboard. Phyllis Logan says goodbye as does Chris Jury... Personnel reasons and career moves. Oh well...
 As stated by other reviewers this is not the best season of the series. Not bad or anything like that, just not as good. The group dynamic has changed with the new cast members so the settling in period experienced in season one is back in play. The series is still completely enjoyable and the image quality is vastly improved over the previous seasons. (Better technology during the original production.)
 Lovejoy is still up to old antics. He has many close calls with the ""Old Bill"" and is picked up for questioning several times. ""Always for something he didn't do rather than for what he did do to some unlucky punter."" The ever ongoing search for lost relics and a fast pound at the expense of the unwary is still the core of the series. Several cons and many shady deals see Lovejoy make and loose small fortunes. Owing money to the Mob and a few other money making / get even scams make for a few of the better episodes in the entire series.
 Over all you will like this season even with the loss of two old friends and the arrival of new ones. The image and sound quality still need the assistance of modern re-mastering technology but are still far better than the first three seasons.  Unfortunately there is only one season remaining in the series and then no more Lovejoy... The past is the past and Lovejoy doesn't live there anymore...",1243555200,14,1544,4.543165467625899
3761228,1,B001PU8N0S,"This is the destruction of a great series, they changed characters and have very poor scripts compared to the first four seasons. I did not like any of the episodes in this season, and I loved some of the episodes from previous seasons. The worst is they lost Lady Jane and tried to replaced her with several mediocre characters none of the actresses as good as Phyllis Logan. Her interaction and the sexual tension with Lovejoy were one of the central themes of the series. It looks like they thought Charlotte Cavendish could replace her, but none of the scripts really did anything with this character or developed more than an antagonistic relationship with Lovejoy. I wish I had not wasted my money on this season, if I had seen this season first I would have never purchased the first four.",1243382400,9,796,4.652482269503546
3761229,4,B001PU8N0S,"Year Five brought about cast changes that disrupted the chemistry of the series.  While the mysteries were still good, our favorite characters were disappearing.  The trouble started the year before when Lovejoy, in his usual financial troubles, lost his home.

Now this year Lady Jane Feldsham is bankrupt & selling her mansion.  She had always been untouchably rich and stable, a rudder to keep the gang steering on course.  Now she is adrift & leaving the series.

Add to that Eric's desire to leave and take over his uncle's pub, now some of the ingredients of a good stew have been left out.

Beth was a nice addition, but not enough to fill in all of the gaps.

I still liked the series, and this year has grown on me with repeat viewings, but the gang is not all here (and will not return).",1242172800,6,797,4.486111111111111

3761235,1,B001PU8N0S,"Although we enjoyed Lovejoy when it was on PBS, this particular DVD release is an abomination and discredits this series. It opens up with commercials for other shows, all of which are sharp and clear. That all changes when the main feature starts. It seems like a VCR tape only recopied onto another tape. I only watched five minutes and that was enough as the pixilation was horrible, even on the subtitle text!
Acorn media should never have released this on DVD in that condition. I shall be returning this as fortunately I bought at Costco. Very disappointing

Lady Jane moves along as her husband's bankruptcy means no more mansion, and Eric finds a new path as well. But never fear, Lovejoy welcomes the lovely auctioneer Charlotte, played by Caroline Langrishe, and Tinker's keen new assistant Beth, portrayed by Diane Parish, to this merry band. Just don't expect Lovejoy & Co. to walk the straight and narrow--the fakes and treasures still abound. This engaging whodunit series with Ian McShane's wry asides to viewers includes a trek to America this season, along with guest stars James Nesbitt and the legendary John Gielgud. If you're a newcomer to Lovejoy's world, you'll quickly learn how much you know--or don't!--about antiques, and you'll look closer at your yard-sale trash or treasures; if you're a fan reveling in Acorn's splendid remastered issue of this popular 1990s series, you can still look forward to another season (and yes, we haven't seen the last of Lady Jane).

3761241,5,B001PU8N0S,"LOVEJOY, Series 5. Lovejoy, that handsome rogue, an antiques dealer and part-time detective, is played by Golden Globe winner Ian McShane (so winning in DEADWOOD) in this cult favorite British comedy/crime drama. The hit television series, loosely based on the fast-paced British mystery novels by Jonathan Gash, was made in the 1980s and 90s, seen on the BBC for six series, (1986, 1991-1994), and, in the United States, on A & E. Our friend Lovejoy --we never learn his first name-- has an eye for a find, a forgery, the ladies, and a good sob story.

Series 5 opens with a young Phyllis Logan, (DOWNTON ABBEYS Mrs. Hughes), as Lady Jane Felsham, married well-heeled decorator, partner to Lovejoy; Dudley Sutton, (THE BEIDERBECKE CONNECTION), as Tinker and Chris Jury, (THE BIG GAME), as Eric Catchpole, Lovejoys associates.  However, we will soon lose two of these popular characters, the sultry Lady Jane, and the ever-in-trouble, never quite competent, Catchpole.  In return, we see more of Malcolm Tierney, (DALZIEL AND PASCOE) as Lovejoys friend/colleague/enemy/landlord Charlie Gimbert.  And we meet Caroline Langrishe, (JUDGE JOHN DEED), an icy British blond of the week back then, as Charlotte Cavendish, successful auctioneer/love interest to the scamp Lovejoy.  Also Diane Parish, (EAST ENDERS), as Beth, new trainee to the antiques trade: charming, much more competent, but less entertaining than Catchpole.

The box set consists of four discs that run approximately 777 minutes, 12 hours.  I was given this as a review copy. The series contains brief coarse language and nudity. Mind you, its makers warn that, due to the age of the original material, they have not always been able to restore it to top DVD condition. But thankfully, they have given us subtitles, for who would want to miss a minute of this light-hearted whodunits fun!

Lovejoy, called a divvy by his colleagues, apparently a person who can just smell a great antique, was called the James Bond of antiques dealers by the New York Times. Guest stars in this series include: actors icon John Gielgud, (ARTHUR); a very young here, now veteran James Nesbitt, (the HOBBIT trilogy, MISSING); Colin Salmon, (PRIME SUSPECT); the estimable Pete Postlethwaite, (INCEPTION, THE FATHER), and Selina Caddell, the ditzy Mrs. Tishell, pharmacist to DOC MARTIN.

The episodes are, with thanks to RLJ Entertainment/Acorn:

Disc 1
Episode 1: Pig in a Poke
Through Lady Jane's amateur theatrical career, Lovejoy finds  several rare 17th-century prints by political satirist James Gillray. The dealer manages to turn them for a profit, but installation in a client's home raises questions about their authenticity.

Episode 2: Who Is the Fairest of Them All?
Jane convinces Lovejoy to sell an 18th-century French mirror, rumored to be recovered from a shipwreck. But the second it comes into his hands, she begins avoiding him for reasons unknown.

Episode 3: A Going Concern
Lady Jane goes walkabout; in her stead, Lovejoy is looking over her home now for sale. Never one to pass up an opportunity, he stages an antiques show, hoping the estate will lend the items value. This doesn't square well with Charlotte, the hall's appointed auctioneer.

Episode 4: The Kakiemon Tiger
Lovejoy receives a rude awakening when a ruthless businessman, Sandy Litvak, calls in a 14,000 debt that the cunning dealer owes. He'll need to find a way to pay back the sum in five days or else face the brute force of Litvak's henchmen.

Disc 2
Episode 5: Three Men and a Brittle Lady
Charlie, who had purchased Felsham Hall, now purchases an authentic 18th-century Bow figurine at auction. But when he shows it off, it appears to have been swapped for a fake. Lovejoy must now charm the withholding Charlotte to get to the bottom of the crime.

Episode 6: Ducking and Diving
Eric and Tinker go on a seaside vacation in Tollesbury but end up in the company of crooks. Meanwhile, Lovejoy is stranded with a giant Flemish dresser, subjected to the scrutiny of an overzealous detective.

Episode 7: Stones of Destiny
Lovejoy's infatuation with Charlotte grows stronger, but he upsets her by inadvertently allowing a thief to make off with an extremely rare and valuable apostle cross. The two must travel to Wales to recover it.

Episode 8: Poetic License
Lovejoy agrees to appraise some paintings for Charlotte's friend, who runs a mental institution in financial trouble. But his presence there may not be welcome, as someone tries to take his life.

Disc 3
Episode 9: The Peking Gun
A widow seeks Lovejoy's help in selling off her husband's eclectic antiques collection. Most of it is rubbish, aside from a large 15th-century Chinese gun from the Ming dynasty. To authenticate the item, Lovejoy and Charlotte will have to consult with dangerous experts.

Episode 10: Goose Bumps
To pay off a dentist bill, Lovejoy agrees to track down an antiques dealer presumed to have fallen overboard from a ferry to Holland. Meanwhile, Charlie begrudgingly puts on a dog show at Felsham Hall.

Episode 11: Swings and Roundabouts
An elderly carnival worker, looking to retire, asks Lovejoy to sell his large collection of brass candlesticks. When the carny is arrested on suspicion of having stolen some of them  from  wealthy town residents, it's up to Lovejoy to clear the mans name.

Disc 4
Episode 12: Never Judge a Book by Its Cover
Two bizarre sisters contact Lovejoy, hoping their antique book collection will help them out of debt. They do, in fact, apparently possess a rare and valuable 16th-century Marston Bible, but Lovejoy will first have to convince their very reluctant brother to sell it.

Episode 13: The Price of Fish
Lovejoy accompanies Charlotte to a class reunion, hoping for a romantic weekend. But the trip takes a turn when he's asked to appraise a fish, beneficiary of the taxidermists art that is famous for having swallowed Isadora Duncan's jewelry. To make matters worse, Charlie serves him with an eviction notice.

Episode 14: The Lost Colony
Lovejoy encounters a Southern belle from North Carolina who, oddly enough, shares his surname and penchant for exquisite antiques. When a trove of valuable artifacts once belonging to Sir Walter Raleigh goes missing, he travels to the United States to track her down. This particular episode is feature length, don't ask me why.  And it stunned me by coming, while in North Carolina, to the very seaside area in which I live: Cape Fear. So named centuries ago for its dangerous waters, full of shipwrecks (we are not that far, nautically, from Bermuda and its notorious Triangle.)  The shipwrecks are an important plot point.  Up on screen, Frying Pan Shoals, the Orton plantation and its mansion, also used in the first, black and white CAPE FEAR.  And even the well-known green Moran motel on Kure Beach.

As Lovejoy, described by the Washington Post as one of televisions most charming and appealing characters, uses his wit and charm to buy/sell, and help solve the various mysteries/problems that come his way, he also enjoyably scours the salesrooms, auction houses and stately homes of Britain, all ensconced in beautiful scenery.  Theres no violence, no blood and gore in this popular, saucy entertainment, and only the most respectful of sex. I have always loved this show, never missed it when it was on A & E.  For whatever the reasons, perhaps, partially, the shows visit to my home of the last ten years, I especially loved this particular series, and have here fallen in love with it all over again. Highly recommended.",1427500800,,7538,5.014423076923077
3761242,5,B001PU8N0S,"This Lovejoy set is 1993, Series 5. Nostalgic Brit drama based on antiques, not traditional crime. Lovejoy (Ian McShane) is a likable rogue dealer of antiquities. He's a divvy (aka gifted spotter of antique value) sometimes bordering on unlawful, occasionally charmed sleuth. I love antiques shopping, thus this series is a treasure. LOOSELY based on Jonathan Gash novels.

Regular cast (characters all exquisitely developed) includes ""Tink"" (Dudley Sutton -`Beiderbecke' trilogy) a divvy who drinks too much; Eric (Chris Jury) partner for 6 episodes; gets replaced by Beth (Diane Parish ). Lady Jane Felsham (Phyllis Logan) quickly makes way for Charlotte (Caroline Langrishe), both antique lover, Lovejoy lover. Gimbert (Malcolm Tierney) Lovejoy's dealer nemesis & new landlord. 2 regulars are missed, but the show manages to keep pace and moves on with equally good replacements.  4-6 guest stars of the 90s to today in each episode (a few noted below.)

For four seasons, we watched the hijinks of Lovejoy, Lady Jane, Tinker and Eric. They were loyal cohorts and they infuriated each other. During this season, there are several changes. Alex Felsham, Jane's globe-trotting husband, goes bust. The marriage busts afterwards and Lady Jane leaves the country for a job in America.
Then later in the Season Eric gets an offer he can't refuse, and also leaves Lovejoy Associates. Lovejoy's new intern, Beth, is a nice addition and is the straight man to Lovejoy. But she just can't fill the shoes of Jane and the bumbling Eric. I enjoyed the whole season, but half a star off for Season 5, because though there are some great plots and lots of farcical humor, at the end I still missed the old team.

...1... ""Pig in a Poke"" Jane is in an amateur theater production, dressed in her flapper dress. Lovejoy wants to show support by watching it, but not really. But he feels better about going when he finds that the set decorations include 2 valuable 1790s watercolors.
...2... ""Who Is the Fairest of Them All?"" You guessed right, this episode involves a mirror! And it also is a long good-bye to Jane, who is moving to America.
...3... ""A Going Concern"" Felsham Hall is empty and going to be auctioned off. Lovejoy almost ends up in jail  again. The big question is, can Lovejoy Associates survive with the three partners left?
...4... ""The Kakiemon Tiger"" Ben Windsor's will is read. He left Tinker a Staffordshire teapot. Charlie Gimble gets silver grape scissors. And Lovejoy is left a 1915 French cigarette case. It's ""trench art"", made by a soldier from a cartridge case. But it's not enough to keep Lovejoy out of the clutches of a loan shark.
...5... ""Three Men and a Brittle Lady"" Introducing Charlotte, a smart and beautiful auctioneer. She is a new recurring character and Lovejoy enjoys the sparks between them. Watch this episode just to see Fanny the Fainter at work.
...6... ""Ducking and Diving"" Eric and Tinker are on ""the cheapest, charmingest holiday we've ever had'  until the duck hunting starts. They're in Tollesbury, where Eric's Uncle Jack owns a historic pub. So historic that Uncle Jack is a bit of a pirate himself.
...7... ""Stones of Destiny"" An old cohort comes through town. Lovejoy tells us, ""You know, people are always telling me that antiques is a crooked business. Well, Bible Joe is living proof that it isn't, entirely.... He's got a great eye and he'll never screw you."" This is just before Bible Joe steels a Celtic cross out of Charlotte's showroom.
...8... ""Poetic License"" It's a beautiful day. Lovejoy spends it at the river painting ""a homage a Norwich School. With a few little touches that will identify it to the half-knowledgeable punter as a John Thirtle""  whose paintings bring in a lot more money than a Lovejoy! To make up for this nefarious business, Lovejoy helps a charity find the funds to keep open. This is a feel-good episode of hope and help.
...9...""The Peking Gun"" Mrs. Dimmock is a widow with grown children. She decides to sell the house and most of its contents and move on. Lovejoy finds that most of her stuff is junk, but there in the back is a flower pot that started life as something entirely different. Something worth fighting over.
..10.. ""Goose Bumps"" Terry Sullivan, ""the Lovejoy of King's Lynn"", got on a ferry and was never seen again. Including that he never got off the ferry. His widow, assumed widow since they never found a body, is in financial straits and Lovejoy sells some statues for her. This is a tale of obsessed collectors  who collect anything geese.
..11.. ""Swings and Roundabouts"" The carnival is in town! Lovejoy goes with Charlotte and it turns into business. Boswell, carney boss: ""By nature, I'm a travelling man, Lovejoy. But the game's changed and I haven't."" He wants Lovejoy to value his collection of brass candlesticks as his ""pension"". But  what if the candlesticks are stolen?
..12.. ""Never Judge a Book By Its Cover"" Charlotte takes Lovejoy to Cambridge, her alma mater, for the Annual Cambridge Antique & Book Fair. They meet the elderly Doncaster sisters, Faith and Hope. They are in desperate need of funds and hope some books in their library may be worth selling. Only one could be, and it is a rare find. If only it wasn't a fake.
..13.. ""The Price of Fish"" Charlotte takes Lovejoy to Barraclough Hall (pronounced Bare ah cluff) in Norfolk, family home of her friend, Hattie.  It's a huge place and impossibly expensive to run. Hattie's father, Peter, asks Lovejoy to look over items for possible sale. The most promising is also the most unusual, stuffed and mounted pike that ""was later discovered to have swallowed a bracelet that allegedly belonged to the famous dancer, Isadora Duncan.""
This is a lovely episode, lively and funny and a nice ending to the Season.

Season 5 of ""Lovejoy"" originally aired September through November 1993. Note: This Season 5 set does NOT include the December 1993 Christmas Special, ""The Lost Colony"". The 13 episodes of Season 5 total about 650 minutes. The DVD presents it in 4:3 aspect ratio and English subtitles are available on the episodes and the single Bonus Feature.
... Bonus... ""Ian McShane Talks About Lovejoy: Part 5"" (9 minutes) A 2004 interview with McShane, who plays Lovejoy, is divided into six parts. One part appears on each of the six Season sets.
You can learn a lot about the antiques business by watching this show. McShane says, ""The writers were grounded in antiques and all the stuff that came out in the show was actually verified and true.... It's one of those shows antique dealers like because you told stories and they loved the stories... and we only gave away half the secrets!""

8334702,5,B001PU8N0S,"Have loved this series a long time and am so happy to be collecting the series on DVD now. Lovejoy (Ian McShane at his most delightful) is one of our beloved flawed heroes. His cohorts are fabulous foils to the plots and one can always count on fascinating information about objects d' art of the genuine and fake variety as well as furnishing a mystery or two along the way that may or may not be solved. Lovejoy doesn't make a to-do of his ""divvy"" abilities the way others might but knowing the genuine article, that frisson of delight he gets in the presence of it is fun to watch as is his regret to inform hopeful customers if it is not.
Don't be put off by the fact that Lovejoy barely makes ends meet most of the time and that he has professional enemies who delight in making his life difficult all of the time. It's a fact that many who have extraordinary abilities do not reap the rewards of same.
So enjoyable and quite poignant.",1502841600,,940,4.31638418079096
