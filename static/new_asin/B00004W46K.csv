1359864,5,B00004W46K,"I saw this film for the first time a few weeks ago, and I still can't stop thinking about it.  ""Secret Ceremony"" is a truly fascinating psychological drama directed by Joseph Losey. It stars my favorite actress, the magnificent Elizabeth Taylor.  In ""Secret Ceremony"", Elizabeth Taylor portrays Leonora, a thirtysomething prostitute who is befriended by Cenci(Mia Farrow), a girl who strongly resembles her deceased daughter.  Cenci brings Leonora to her large, luxurious house where she starts calling the woman ""mommy"". At first, Leonora is opposed to acting as Cenci's mother, but she soon realizes that Cenci is a very troubled girl and decides to stay on and look after her.  In time, Leonora starts to develop maternal feelings for Cenci, and the two women are then able to create a world of their own where they can live as ""mother"" and ""daughter"".  Their private world is disrupted, however, when Cenci's lecherous stepfather(Robert Mitchum) enters the scene.  This is a rich, strangely moving film that sticks with you long after it has ended.  Elizabeth Taylor gives a stunning performance as the complex, emotionally damaged Leonora. It's one of her most daring roles, and Taylor handles it like the consummate actress that she is.  As the waifish, deeply disturbed Cenci, Mia Farrow also delivers a top-notch portrayal.",988588800,9,1331,5.158139534883721
1359865,3,B00004W46K,"When this movie came out in the late sixties, I remember watching it in a freezing little theater in Fargo, N.D. and I was about the only person in there. I was horrified to see my Cult Queen Liz so heavy and plump and in some ways repulsive, when she's gobbling up the huge breakfast prepared by the really repulsive Mia Farrow--yes, Mia, of the simpering, cutesy, little girl, waifish idiot--and then belches. But I enjoyed a millions more when I recently watched it on TV here in Manhattan. I loved the incredibly furnished mansion where most of the action takes place. Liz is terrific--but still looks bloated. Mia is still repulsive--her whining, babyish voice, and halting delivery--inciting one to slap her.  This is a haunting movie, though, and once you've seen it, you've got to study it again--primarily for the decor and furnishings of the London mansion and Liz's mod-English outfits. She actually looks like she's suffering from a terrible hangover throughout the filming--and in reality, she probably was.",978912000,6,1020,5.0
1359866,4,B00004W46K,"This is during Taylor's Spate of more experimental film of her long and somewhat uneven career. She is undenieably beautiful even at the balooning of her weight which began with this film. The lesbian aspect of the film is still a bit of a shocker with she and the ever bonish Mia Farrow rolling in a bed naked or sharing a tub. She overacts outrageously just as she does in her other ccult classic with director Losey, ""BOOM!"" which John Waters has called the best worst film of all time. It too is a cult camp classic. So Liz is puffy but beautiful and Farrow does her spaced out skeleton number with the most sumptuous interiors ever. Beautifully phtographed but a real  mind twister. BTW La Liz played another lesbic turn in X<Y & Zee which she eats the screen along with poor Suzannah York and Michael Caine as appetizers. I love Overblown, overdone, over- ripe Taylor! She is definitely the LAST true MOVIE STAR!",977616000,10,918,4.5636363636363635
1359867,4,B00004W46K,"""Secret Ceremony"" is, I think, a fascinating psychological drama that was unjustly savaged by most critics upon it's initial release in 1968.  That the film's release came on the heels of another Taylor/Losey project - the awful ""Boom"" - probably didn't help.
The film chronicles the strange, co-dependent relationship between a childlike young woman suffering from arrested development (Farrow) and a prostitute (Taylor) whose child has died, and who bears a striking resemblance to Farrow's dead mother.  Taylor moves into the house and takes on a mothering role to Farrow, thus both women play off each other's needs.
Enter two meddling, thieving aunts (Peggy Ashcroft, Pamela Brown) and Farrow's unscrupulous stepfather (Robert Mitchum, miscast, and the one jarring performance in this film), and the stage is set for tragedy.
I'll be the first to say that ""Secret Ceremony"" isn't for all tastes.  But it does improve with age.  Taylor gives, I think, one of her best, most understated performances.  Her scene at the very end is excellent.  I recommend this film for those with adverturous, eclectic tastes in film.
Hope this comes out on DVD.",972518400,14,1148,5.178378378378379
1359888,5,B00004W46K,"My spouse is a Mia Farrow addict, and enjoys seeing her old movies.  She was bummed that she could not see this one, but I mentioned our player is supposed to handle PAL discs, and is region free, so why not give it a shot?  Sure enough, plays just fine, even in Texas!!  You DO have to ensure your player will play both PAL and be region free, or allow region changes.",1353888000,5,369,4.097222222222222
1359889,5,B00004W46K,"In a remarkable setting, this deliberately paced, provocative film held my interest and showcased two talented actors, both women, isolated in loss and grief. Artsy, weird, and not easily forgotten.",1351641600,2,198,5.633333333333334
1359890,5,B00004W46K,"A very 60's film, and acting like you will never see from anyone in today's films.  You'll love the look of the sets, the clothes, everything... because back then movies were less artificial.  This film is art. It's eccentric and dark. Its great.  SOMEONE NEEDS TO RELEASE IT TO DVD. No one should hold this film back from DVD format. Same with the Elizabeth Taylor/Richard Burton film titled ""Boom"".  These are gems. Release them to the public as DVD's, ok ???!! Right now,only option is to get the VHS copied to DVD...so do that because this film is worth it especially if you are an Elizabeth Taylor fan who wants to see how great she could be away from the boring usual ""good girl"" roles. Mia Farrow was also perfect in this.  You can get VHS tapes copied to DVD, look it up.  Or get a VHS player. I also HIGHLY recommend the disturbing but brilliantly acted  Elizabeth Taylor film ""The Driver's Seat"".
Elizabeth is a freaking genius who makes it look easy.",1276992000,4,961,4.520231213872832

elizabeth about modulation, but at times, with continuous dialogue (all signifying nothing), one felt her famously imitated voice was wandering

1359893,3,B00004W46K,"Here, she is a tired two-bit hustler, or as Liz put it, with typical finesse, ""I play a dikey prostitute in this one."" For the first time in her career, she plays a character who doesn't like men, a middle-aged woman battered by a life on the streets who has come to regard men as her natural enemies... Given her animosity, this is a Taylor triangle with a twist: her character fights a strong Robert Mitchum for possession of a foolish girl Mia Farrow...

A psychological thriller, the movie depicts the fantasy world created by the young girl and the older prostitute... The girl thinks Taylor is her mother, and she brings her home to her once resplendent, now faintly decayed London town house.... The two women, locked away from the world outside, enact a ""secret ceremony"" in which fantasy mingles with and reshapes reality, and Taylor is only too willing to exchange her role of streetwalker for that of the mad girl's rich mama...

""Secret Ceremony"" is a thickly dark, arty movie, and her role is tricky, complex: the hooker must become a big lady... Nervous, agitated and confused in the face of a supply of illusion and reality, Taylor uses her Virginia Woolf number for a role that needs cunning shadings...

""Secret Ceremony"" looks terrific (Joseph Losey again going to work on a magnificent dream like house), but this is no triumph for Liz... The role pushes against Taylor stereotype, but she isn't elastic enough to transcend her new-found image...",1234224000,,1465,4.805555555555555
1359894,5,B00004W46K,"I like these shows where you jump back in time before computers, cordless phones, and pre surgery Liz Taylor. I just watched it for the first time on a hidden channel on cable. It amazes me that people are just as F&^%ed up in 1963. Everything is so timeless. I couldn't help but be sad watching the movie though. It pulls out that dark place in your soul that we try so hard to numb. You may need to open a window and let the sun in, and a bottle of antidepressants or ativan in hands reach watching it though. Or just make a fire, close the curtains and stave off suicide instead! Not a movie for christians even though there are catholics in it, just be warned. Peace out!",1222992000,3,675,4.2
1359895,4,B00004W46K,"Creepy and wonderfully bizarre, ""Secret Ceremony"" stands to be reexamined today. When it came out in the late 1960's the film was not well received. And in those days Miss Taylor's work after ""Virginia Wolff"" was for the most part not appreciated. Some thought she had lost touch with the times, some felt her choices were off the wall and just plain bad. Now years later we can look back on such films as ""Boom"", ""Reflections In A Golden Eye"". ""The Driver's Seat"" and this film and see what a brave actress she was. Always willing to take chances and go with a project that challenged her she stepped out of the crystal cocoon of M.G.M. that gave her a career and worked at being more than a manufactured star. She worked at her craft as an actress.

  Here an equally gifted cast, Peggy Ashcroft, Pamela Brown, Robert Mitchum, and Mia Farrow support her.  Mitchum, scraggily and sinisterly sexy is perfect as the destructor of the fragile dream world of Cenci and Leonora. Ashcroft and Brown as the dykey Aunts who see through the dream but keep silent for what they can get out of it. And, Mia Farrow in a role that is more chilling than the one she gave in ""Rosemary's Baby"".

  Director Joseph Losey serves it all up in a clammy cold blue London light that keeps things on the edge somewhere between madness and comfort. Hot baths, huge overheated beds beckon while outside it is as cold and lonely as a child's grave in winter, a winter that will never end.

  It is a film well worth seeing and should be regarded as another job well done in a series of great roles by Elizabeth Taylor.",1104278400,21,1593,4.462068965517242
1359896,5,B00004W46K,"having seen few films by either the magnificent ms taylor and/ or ms farrow, i was certainly impressed and would highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys well-made classical psychological dramas. needless to say, the performances here are nearly flawless and i am actually surprised that neither actress was nominated for anything. i must say first of all that i am a lover of the strangest films and often campy ones too so this really was a true find for me. having read the other reviewers comments here, i can agree only so much with anything anyone has written here thus far. generally speaking, i am not fond of leonard maltin as a critic but i believe perhaps his review of this film comes the closest to carefully examining this exercise in psychological drama. secret ceremony can be disturbing at times in it's almost uncompromising depiction of tragedy and how we tend to cope with unbearable incidents. we find ms farrow here playing a young girl in her early twenties named cenci who has never truly accepted her mother's death. she meets lenora played by ms. taylor whom she almost instantaneously believes is her mother and two form a strange friendship. having lost a loved one in her life as well, lenora tends to feel sorry for the young cenci and agree to play ""mummy"" for her until the meddling aunts or cenci's sleazy, abusive stepfather appear. i didn't particularly find the breakfast scene between cenci and lenora to be repulsive. in fact, rather felt sorry for lenora off and on throughout the film and was glad to see her receive a nourishing meal. so what ?? ms. talor was beginning to gain a bit of weight but i still believe she looked radiantly beautiful in many scenes here. GREAT FILM AND VERY OVERLOOKED BY MANY.",1012003200,9,1753,4.713355048859935
1359897,4,B00004W46K,"I first heard about this film on a radio call-in show in 1985, when I was 14 and *obsessed* with movies. Although I was in Illinois, the show was broadcast out of Philadelphia (WCAU-AM). The show was on from midnight to 5 am (CST), and it was hosted by a guy named Stephen Friedman. It was a call-in show where the subject was nothing but movies--and I swear this guy had seen ALL of them! Does anybody recall this show?? I just loved it!
Anyway, I was intrigued by a conversation he had with a caller on this film. They were talking about what a wild psychological drama it was, and that (at the time) there was basically no way to see the film in its original state. The film had not been released on video yet, and the TV print had been notoriously butchered to make it more ""acceptable"" for TV. The network (ABC?) even went so far as to shoot additional footage with psychiatrists explaining the sordid details of the story (a la ""Psycho"", perhaps). Well, I finally tracked it down. So after all these years, the wonder is over...
I can only imagine what I would have made of this film as a naive teenager. Even now I find myself creeped out by the horrible secrets of Mia's character, and by the painful emptiness of the soul of Liz's (this film would be considered bold even today; it's not tame by any standards). Mia's character seems a bit over the top, but I do believe there are people like that in the world. Her past traumas seemed to have led her to have a total lack of physical boundaries with people. As for Liz, she was moving at times, rather unpleasant at times (like in the all-too-real breakfast scene), and practically another character in others (like the fake British accent she adopts on occasion).
There is certainly an element of camp in this film. It doesn't dominate the film, so I wouldn't call it camp. But some of the dialog and sets are not to be believed. Liz croaks out some pretty bad lines, with my favorite being ""that's too drab for a spring day--that should be worn on a day when it rains like p*ss!"". Robert Mitchum, thoroughly repulsive as Mia's stepfather, gets some of the best (worst) lines, like his line to an overweight Liz, ""I'm very fond of cows. Moooooo!"".
I don't want to give away the plot, because the film is worth the time just to watch the story unravel and to enjoy the creepy atmosphere (full of baroque-y music, Mia's bizarre mansion, and constant dread). If you put the lapses into camp aside, you'll find it's not a bad psychological drama. You won't regret spending the time to check this unique film out.",992217600,21,2569,4.456475583864119

7924585,1,B00004W46K,"Review of Secret Ceremony
Hot Toasty Rag, September 18, 2017

If this movie didn't come out the same year as Rosemarys Baby, Id wonder what possessed anyone to make it. Ill chose to believe everyone wanted to help launch Mia Farrows spooky movie by releasing a similar film at the same time. Thats my standard for recommending this movie: if you actually liked Rosemarys Baby, rather than just appreciated it, then you can feel free to watch Secret Ceremony.

Elizabeth Taylors daughter is dead, and Mia Farrows mother is dead. Miraculously, Liz looks like Mias mom, and Mia reminds Liz of her daughter. Somehow they find each other, bond quickly, and become enmeshed in each others strange, sick lives. This is a very weird film, with unexplained plot points, melodramatic acting, and mentally-ill characters. Mia repeatedly reenacts a rape scene while shes alone. She calls Liz Mom and takes a bath with her, and the two girls giggle about what nuisances men and sex are. Robert Mitchum costars as Mias stepfather, but unless he, too, wanted to support Rosemarys Baby, I don't know why he agreed to be a part of this movie.

This movie is so strange, awful, and convoluted, it makes the 1968 horror flick seem like a Mister Rogers episode. If Id cared enough about it, I would have been seriously disturbed, but thankfully, I didn't let the film get the better of me.

Kiddy warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to some very strange and upsetting content, I wouldnt let my kids watch it.",1505692800,2,1526,4.7908745247148286
