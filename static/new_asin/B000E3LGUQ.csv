2487693,3,B000E3LGUQ,"Was looking for something more along the lines of the mission. This was a bit more Classic Western style. Not what I expected, but not bad.",1353456000,,139,4.384615384615385
2487694,4,B000E3LGUQ,"Our family (parents, 6 kids from teenagers on down) recently watched this movie and I'm really glad we did!  What an incredible man!  What an impossible work he did for the glory of God!  The story of European missionary efforts to the native American tribes of the Southwest is difficult to tell accurately, as it has been obscured through the passage of time, the changes in worldview, the changes in religious ""fevor,"" the admittedly bad treatment by many Europeans of native Americans and so forth.  This man seems to shine out as something amazing and the movie is well worth watching for a window into his witness of courage, faith, fortitude, creativity, zeal and many other virtues.  Our kids had studied the CA Missions and Fr. Serra a year or two ago, now I got to ""meet"" his predecessor, Fr. Kino, and I'm glad for it.  Only drawback: film has a fairly ""dated"" feel to it; if that doesn't both you, you should enjoy the content.",1332288000,4,939,4.626506024096385
2487695,4,B000E3LGUQ,"I only watched half of this movie; was planning to watch the other half but my rental expired and I don't want to pay again.  Yeah, it's not the most gripping and entertaining movie, but it seemed that the story was true to what I know of Father Kino... admittedly not much... but I've done a little reading about him.  My kids watched the half-movie with me and we were able to discuss the treatment of the Indians during the time of the Spanish missionaries, and we discussed what might have been different about Father Kino than the other missionaries, and even discussed what a mission trip should and should not involve.  It's a slow-paced movie, the wardrobe and cast might not be entirely accurate (why does that Indian look like a white guy?), but I think it's a good visual of early Southwestern missions.",1294790400,2,814,4.6
2487696,4,B000E3LGUQ,"Unfortunately, this is a very old movie and the DVD shows it.  However, it is an important story in the Jesuit missions to North America.  The story takes place from 1685-1699 in what is now Mexico.  Fr. Kino and the other Jesuit missionaries worked diligently to bring those peaceful people to an understanding and love of God through Jesus.  Like the Flathead Indians who cried for joy at Fr. DeSmet's arrival, almost two hundred years later, those Mexican Indian rejoiced at Fr. Kino's message and service.

Regrettably, it was difficult for the Indians to distinguish between the Spanish soldiers and miners, who also wore a cross and claimed to be Christian, and the heart felt, loving Christianity of Fr. Kino and the other Jesuit missionaries.  The soldiers resorted to violence too quickly and indiscriminately and the minors turned the Indians into slaves to work their mines.  So, they made enemies of the Church and Christianity among some of the Indians.  This movie is the story of that conflict.

Traditional values families might wish to discuss this issue, that of people claiming to be Christian but who do not live with Christ's love.  Today, Islam is facing the same issue; Moslems claiming it is a peaceful and loving religion, while other's claiming to be Moslems who are preaching terrorism and violence.  Fr. Kino stood up against the soldiers and miners; will Moslems claiming peacefulness do the same against their Islamic terrorists?  These are good issues for family discussion that arise in this old movie.",1156291200,18,1534,5.019762845849803

8105516,3,B000E3LGUQ,"Don't need a feature movie to tell history.  Everything about this movie is B except the story.  As a scholar of the Spanish colonial Southwest I really enjoyed the narrative about the exploration and settlement of Arizona and Northern Mexico.  The dramatization did a pretty good job demonstrating the  difficulty and costs of exploration and settlement.  Now, we need an accurate low budget B movie about Fr Junipero Serra.",1492992000,,425,5.101449275362318
8105517,3,B000E3LGUQ,"This recording really shows its age, and the actors for the most part are mediocre at best. We enjoyed the narration by Fulton Sheen and it offered a decent overview of the story of Father Kino. I hope someone decides to remake this story.",1482192000,,239,4.454545454545454

8105519,2,B000E3LGUQ,"Very dated, as a historical reinactor of this period had hoped for some ideas.  Laughably and patronizingly deals with the native Americans, and the acting is more wooden than the mesquite beams in the ramadas.  Managed to make a fascinating and important time in SW history pretty awful.",1463443200,,288,4.979166666666667
8105520,4,B000E3LGUQ,"Well, I can't help but like, I was a cowboy back then, and my boss rented the horse's to the movie, some 41 years ago. I met the Richard Egan, I played the Mexican cowboy on the cattle drive, riding next to Egan. It was filmed outside of Scottsdale, AZ, to the north.",1407715200,,267,4.056603773584905
8105521,3,B000E3LGUQ,"THREE STARS ONLY BECAUSE MY FATHER, ARTHUR COATES, PRODUCED THE FATHER KINO STORY.  HE BELIEVED IN OTHERS WHO CONVINCED HIM THAT THEY KNEW HOW TO MAKE A WONDERFUL PROFIT MAKING MOVIE.  HE LOST A FEW MILLION.  LESSON: NEVER BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU ARE TOLD.  IF IT'S TO GOOD TO TO BE TRUE, IT PROBABLY IS, ESPECIALLY IF PEOPLE WANT TO PUT THEIR HAND IN YOUR POCKET.  JOHN ARTHUR COATES  (I TRULY MISS HIM)",1407283200,,403,4.527777777777778
8105522,2,B000E3LGUQ,"Okay, I sometimes wish I weren't interested in history...but since I am, dressing the 17 century Spanish Navy in uniforms left over from the Mexican army at the Alamo made it hard for me to concentrate...Mexico and Spain are two different countries, and the uniforms were about 250 years off and while we're at it, Portugal isn't Spanish at all and is in Europe and doesn't serve Margaritas [which has nothing to do with this movie, but I'm just saying]... the garb of the clergy was way off...and the Indians...the acting was nothing to write home about.  Good story could have been done better...",1395014400,,598,4.75

8105524,1,B000E3LGUQ,"I attended the premiere of this movie in Phoenix, AZ. quite a few years ago when i worked as a reporter for the Phoenix Gazette. Ken Kennedy is a friend of mine. I know he was passionate about doing the story on his patron saint Father Kino. But the only shots Ken, a cameraman for a Phoenix television station, seemed to come up with were shots of Father Kino, stave in hand, walking toward the camera, or walking away from the camera. This is a dull, dull movie, with very little action and no character movement. I felt sorry for Ken, whose brother is the award-winning film director Burt Kennedy. If it hadn't been for the Catholic Church buying the film rights and placing it in the Catholic archives, Ken and his investors would never have gotten their money back.",1363132800,,770,4.507142857142857
