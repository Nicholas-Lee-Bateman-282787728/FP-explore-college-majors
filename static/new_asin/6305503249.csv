7891984,1,6305503249,"This movie is BAD!!!! I HATED IT! A poor dog is ALWAYS dieing in this flim! And SO many dogs that were suffering didn't get to a good home! And poor Buck(The star/dog-German Shepherd)

Buck had to suffer in almost THE WHOLE MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 WHAT makes Jack London(The Writer) think that people wiil want to read or watch abused and dieing dogs????!!!!!!!! And at the end Buck's owner dies and Buck is left living with the wolves. Sure he's got a family. BUT he still could get shot and killed!

  This movie is NOT good for little kids!  SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!",1118534400,,568,4.62
7891985,1,6305503249,"From Winthrop Harrison ""winharrison"" review:

""Still, this dull film contains one classic Chuck Heston line - words he was born to speak: ""Mister, if you touch that dog again I'm gonna shoot ya!"" Yippee!""

There is one other great Heston line in this film.  With Buck growling at a malevolent frenchman, Heston says, with rifle in hand, ""My dog don't like the way you smell.""

There.  Now you don't have to watch the movie!",1107129600,9,423,4.662162162162162
