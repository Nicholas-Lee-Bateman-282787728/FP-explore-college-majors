The set has great artwork. The the episodes have great audio and the picture is bright and crisp. Not bad for a show from the seventies.
The translation is excellent and the viewer is no scratching their head with bad translation. All episodes are unedited.
I would hope this will be a launching pad for future titles such as Grendizer and Getter Robo G Aka Starvengers.",1470182400,10,483,4.694117647058824

8755313,5,B01D9T0D5U,"I bought these DVDs out of nostalgia. I grew up watching the series and now I just wanted to enjoy it again in its original language. And I'm really satisfied! I have thought that maybe I have loved this series only because it's part of my childhood, but I have found that I truly enjoy the stories and characters. Some of the aspects of this series are of course already 'classic', so if you're only used to current anime you will probably find them odd. But the characters still shine, and the stories that take them every week to a different country or archaeological site are just very interesting. My childhood memories go hand in hand with an adult glee as I watched this. Love it - thank you Discotek for bringing this back!",1474243200,2,731,4.462686567164179

8755315,5,B01D9T0D5U,"Daikuu Maryuu Gaiking is one of the classic Japanese anime series from the 1970s (1976-1977).  It was dubbed in English and broadcast on American TV during the 1980s as one of the Force Five anime series, a collection of 5 anime series from the 1970s which were all dubbed in English and introduced in the US market, but this DVD set presents the original series as it was broadcast in Japanese.  The audio is Japanese only, and the user has the option to enable or disable English subtitles.

This DVD set refers to Daikuu Maryuu as ""Dino Mech,"" but the most literal English translation would perhaps be ""Great Flying Mystic Dragon.""  The character ""Ma"" is often translated as ""evil"" or something similar, but it can also mean ""magic"" or ""mystic,"" depending on the context, and I personally believe that this is more appropriate.  ""Dino Mech"" is good enough, though.

The overall theme of Daikuu Maryuu Gaiking focuses on the so-called ""ancient astronaut"" theory, which suggests that Earth was visited in the distant past by intelligent extra-terrestrial beings, and these beings were actually the source of many Earth legends and myths.  In this series, many of the legends and myths turn out to be all too real - and that is not a good thing.  As far as I can tell, the ancient legends which are explored in this series, such as the great stone statues of Easter Island and the kofun tombs of ancient Japanese history, are generally based on fact.

Six thousand light-years from Earth, the planet Zela is in its death throes.  Its sun has degenerated into a black hole, and the once-peaceful Zelans have become the victims of their own technology.  Now ruled by Emperor Darius, who is in reality a gigantic robot, and in company with his 4 henchmen, he has enslaved the Zelan people, mentally conditioning and physically transforming them into a murderous horde.  Armed with super-advanced technology and driven by evil, the Zelans have focuses all of their energy on their objectives - the slaughter of the human race and the conquest of Earth.  However, not all of the Zelans are bad, just as not all of the humans are good.

Some people on Earth have become aware of the Zelan threat, and have gathered their forces to defend Earth against the Zelan onslaught.  Professor Daimonji and his team have developed several mecha to defend Earth.  Daikuu Maryuu (which was called the ""Space Dragon"" in the Force Five incarnation) is a gigantic dragon-shaped mecha which serves as both a battleship and a mother-ship for the other mecha.

The team is an eclectic mix.  They are led by Professor Daimonji, who is both a father figure and commander to the crew.  Tsuwabuki Sanshirou is an ex-baseball player who was injured in a Zelan assassination attempt, but his trademark ""magic pitch"" later becomes Gaiking's secret weapon.  Fujiyama Midori (voice-acted by Koyama Mami, from Appleseed (2004) and Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny, among many other things) serves as Daikuu Maryuu's communications officer, is originally not from Earth, and is telepathic to a certain extent.  The team also includes a technological genius, an American who served in the US Marine Corps, a Japanese sumo wrestler, a martial artist from Hong Kong, an expert in scuba diving and water operations, and a boy who is sort of the team mascot but also contributes to victory on several occasions.  Most of their back-stories are explored along the way, and this adds to the show's appeal.  Daikuu Maryuu also has a large crew of engineers, technicians, and weapons systems operators.

Gaiking, the title mecha, is composed of 3 sections which are individually launched from Daikuu Maryuu and combine in mid-air.  Armed with a variety of built-in weapons, Gaiking is nearly invincible once the pilot, Sanshirou, gains more skill and experience.  Daikuu Maryuu also carries 3 support mecha.  Each is optimized for a specific environment - air, sea, and land.  Throughout the series, Gaiking and Daikuu Maryuu receive several weapon upgrades to cope with the increasingly fearsome Zelan mecha.

The viewer should remember that this series was made in the 1970s, and some of the storylines reflect that time in history.  In one episode, the Zelans attempt to deceive the human race into destroying itself by provoking a nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union.  It is likely that most people who purchase this DVD set will be too young to remember the Cold War, but this series provides a window into that historical period for younger viewers.

One of the defining characteristics of Japanese anime from the 1970s was the music of Kikuchi Shunsuke (or Shunsuke Kikuchi, if you want to write his name American-style with family name last).  He created unique musical scores for many anime series during this time, and I consider the musical score for Gaiking to be some of his very best work.

This is just my personal view, but this really was one of the best series of its time, and it never loses its mojo, from start to finish.  For those who are familiar with newer anime series, shows like Gaiking set the pattern for the art form that anime has become.  For anime fans who have been around for a while, this will be a very pleasant trip down memory lane.  I would really like to see more shows from this time brought to the US market.",1472256000,20,5330,4.843267108167771
