8383738,4,B002XJDV3Y,It's all about the main event Penn vs sanchez. This is Penn at his best. Alot of people were backing Sanchez but Penn put on a classic stand up display. It was a brutal fight and the atmosphere was electric. Plus you get to see a new Frank Mir fight after bulking up. wwwdotufclatestdotcom,1297209600,,289,4.37037037037037
8383739,4,B002XJDV3Y,"Good DVD, the only reason why I didn't give it the 5 stars is because these last DVD releases do not include the fighters original entrance music used on the night of the event. I hate it. They use some crappy instrumental rock music - thats my only gripe.",1271030400,,256,4.244897959183674
8383740,4,B002XJDV3Y,"Purchased  107 a couple weeks ago and just got around to watching it. Very solid event overall with a couple very bloody battles. The Guida-Florian match was just flat nasty and entertaining to watch. Frank Mir, coming of his beatdown at the hands of Brock Lesner, puts on an impressive outing aginst always game Cheick Kongo. Mir is noticably bigger and its not fat. I would personally like to see him get another shot at Brock. The main event is Diego Sanchez vs lightweight champ BJ Penn. BJ is a machine at lightweight and have the time looks like he isn't even trying. All tht respect in the world for Diego taking his punishment like a man. This one also has a cut from hell in it. This one is worth the money in my opinion.",1269648000,2,730,4.367647058823529
8383741,5,B002XJDV3Y,"Let me tell you, this was filled with what the UFC is made of. Now, I think a lot of fighters are good sports, but with a lot of them, when the time comes near to fight, there is trash talk. Sometimes it makes a hyped up fight look even more interesting. And Diego Sanchez, with his first chance to fight BJ Penn for the title, starts the trash talk early on. ""This is MY HOUSE, homey."" ""I'm begging BJ Penn to meet me in the center of the octagon, and fight me."" Well, Penn has some words for Diego. He'll gladly fight him hard! Is Diego going to take this belt and be the new Lightweight Champion?

The Co-Main Event was destined to be a quick finish. Either a fast knock out or quick submission. And former Heavyweight Frank Mir says it will be no big deal to take out Cheick Kongo. Mir even goes as far to say that he has better boxing than Kongo. And Kongo has something to say about that, ""Mir has a big mouth. And for that, I'm going to kick his ass."" SO, was Dana White right? Will this be a quick finish? For this to go the distance would be stupid.

And I think, as an added bonus, Kenny Florian and Clay Guida get to go at it! Sounds like fun to me! And so did the rest of these scraps. There are 11 fights on these DVD's, and I'll list them below.

Disk 2: Preliminary Fights

Kevin Burns vs. TJ Grant: Let me tell you, one of these guys I can't stand. And the sucker got TKO'd in the 1st round, and was let go by the UFC! HA!!

DaMarques Johnson vs. Edgar Garcia: Well, Johnson got smoked by Wilks in the TUF Finale, US vs. UK. And Edgar Garcia lost a split decision in his UFC debut that was hotly disputed by him and fans. And one of these guys is fired up enough to submit the other in the 1st round.

Rousimar Palhares vs. Lucio Linhares: Two fighters with excellent ground games. And one of them pulls off the submission in the 2nd round. Or as a lot of people put it, the battle of Paul Harris and Lin Harris...HA!

Johny Hendricks vs. Ricardo Funch: Hendricks beat Amir Sadollah quickly, but not everybody was impressed. And Funch is the grappler with the beads in his hair who trains with Gabriel Gonzaga. This is a good, yet dominant scrap that goes to a unanimous decision.

Matt Wiman vs. Shane Nelson: Wiman's coming off of 2 losses, and Nelson could stand to win too. They both fight a great fight, but only one gets the unanimous decision.

Alan Belcher vs. Wilson Gouveia: Belcher's pissed that he's not on the main card in front of friends and family, and Gouveia needs to start making weight, AND get the win. This is rock 'em sock 'em robots until one man goes down in the 1st round! AND it is fight on the night!

Disk 1: Main card

Paul Buentello vs. Stefan Struve: THE HEADHUNTER is back, but he's gotta go through a SKYSCRAPER who's on a winning streak. This isn't a half bad fight that goes to a MAJORITY decision.

Kenny Florian vs. Clay Guida: WOW! I enjoyed this. And it ends with a great submission in the 2nd round!

Jon Fitch vs. Mike Pierce: Both of these guys beat Brock Larson, both in their UFC debuts. So who's the better man? A unanimous decision answers that question.

Frank Mir vs. Cheick Kongo. It didn't take long. This fight was finished in a little over a minute. It was pretty good!

BJ Penn vs. Diego Sanchez: Other than the fact that this ended mid-way through the 5th round, if you want to know anything else, go to BJPennDOTCOM.

I wasn't disappointed, and I hope you aren't either! ENJOY!!!",1269302400,3,3451,4.245801526717557
