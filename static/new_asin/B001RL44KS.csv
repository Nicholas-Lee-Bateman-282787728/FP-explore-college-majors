8338183,5,B001RL44KS,"No elevator muzak here. Richard Smith does an admirable job of imparting killer licks and concepts over simple ""groove"" progressions. Blues, rock, call and response, triad substitutions, bending are all covered in detail. If you enjoy players like Larry Carlton and Robben Ford, this DVD will teach you how to ""cop"" some of their stylistic nuances. NOT for beginners, but intermediate and advanced players will certainly glean valuable information from this ""jam"" packed instructional DVD. FANTASTIC PRODUCT!",1247011200,4,508,5.6103896103896105
