8669125,5,B00LYN5ZEI,"Although Stan & Ollie are both on the cover this is only a Stan Laurel film made before the boys were a team or even starred in the same film together. The film was made in 1918, a year before Laurel & Hardy starred in: a Dog's Life(their first film together but not yet a team).  The film shows a scene which would be racist compared to modern standards, an actor who co-starred with Stan in this film playing an escaped convict is trying to hit on a woman in a park; when he sees she is black he runs away. However, he and Stan both try to hit on the warden's daughter who is white.  In those days there were no interracial marriages,it was illegal in all states. The director of this film was simply the product of his time.  Stan plays an escaped convict, not his usual role, who desperately tries to escape but at the end is handcuffed and taken back to jail.",1443312000,,864,4.192771084337349
