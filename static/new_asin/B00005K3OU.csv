1615354,5,B00005K3OU,"What an enjoyable and well conceived film!
Set in the reign of Louis XIV of France this film perfectly evokes the era and skillfully draws one into the paranoia, intrigue and sycophancy of the king's circle; the eye of the storm around which all of 17th century France rotates.
Excellent star turns from Gerard Depardieu, Uma Thurman and Tim Roth working through a great script by Tom Stoppard with strong visual direction and lavish design to create an absorbing and rewarding film.  I won't give the story line away but there is romance, intrigue and skullduggery aplenty!
This film will transport you to another era and immerse you in the ambiance of the court of the ""Sun King"".  A very classy and enjoyable experience and wholeheartedly recommended.",1012867200,3,754,4.929133858267717

Ah, serendipity. This film is an eyefull with an ending that left me blinking rapidly . . . How did I miss this extraordinary film in theatrical release? (N.B.

1615357,4,B00005K3OU,"A sumptuous, somewhat flawed film directed by Roland Joff (Gaumont, 2000), the outdoor scenes were shot at Vaux-le-Vicomte even though the story takes place at Chantilly (actually Le Notre's favorite garden). The festivities staged in the gardens are nothing short of fantastic 'Baroque' spectacles and the riches (and decadence) of the aristocracy are lavishly unpacked in a film that might have also packed a suitably revolutionary message if it had not, instead, descended to the bathetic in charting the romantic pas-de-deux twixt Head Steward (Gerard Depardieu) and Lady in Waiting (Uma Thurman).
Depardieu continues to add his bulk to the French national trade surplus and lays in one of his more natural roles similar to his Jean Valjean in Les Miserables (also released in 2000). Uma Thurman and Tim Roth do their best to cop airs, and Julian Sands disappears under a mountainous wig as the Sun King, Louis XIV.
Visit the Gaumont web site for a taste of the stylish (modish) accoutrements of this visually ambitious film. Note: This is not so much a Merchant-Ivory 'full house' (costume drama) as it is a 'royal flush' (operatic carnival) in terms of extravagant artistic rendering of time and place (lacking undue and mawkish or slavish attention to historical precision).
The screenplay by Jeanne Labrune and Tom Stoppard is on par with Stoppard's work in John Madden's maddening Shakespeare in Love. Madden's film was marred by a wastrel (cheeky) sensibility and Gwyneth Paltrow (as Viola) should never, never, never have triumphed over Cate Blanchett (in Shekhar Kapur's Elizabeth) at the 1999 Academy Awards. Actually, Stoppard saved the production of the Madden film from a certain muddleheadedness, at the very last moment, and Miramax handed him a pile of money in appreciation. His role in Vatel was similar, in that he co-wrote the script adding his characteristic bons mots and jazzing up the intellectual pedigree.",1006041600,14,1934,5.201923076923077
1615358,3,B00005K3OU,"This exquisitely wrought film is a sumptuous visual masterpiece. While it is, undoubtedly, a  feast for the eyes, with stunningly beautiful sets and costumes, the storyline does not keep pace with the visuals.
The story itself is simple. The King of France (Julian Sands) and his royal retinue and entourage of sycophants pay a visit to the financially pressed Prince de Conde (Julian Glover). The Prince impresses upon his steward, Vatel (Gerard Depardieu), the importance of the King's visit, as the Prince hopes, should his efforts to please the King succeed, for a war time Royal appointment to lead troops against the fractious Dutch in order to restore his too depleted fortunes.
Vatel does all that he can on a shoestring budget, and his efforts are glorious indeed, beautifully rendered and an absolute delight. Vatel's eye is caught, however, by one of the King's mistresses, Anne De Montausier (Uma Thurman), a woman whose tender nature has not, as yet, been hardened by the cruelties displayed by the ruling class, and he is smitten. His affection is eventually returned by Her, and it is here that the story line begins to pall, not because Depardieu is considerably older and timeworn, and Thurman is young and beautiful. It palls because there is really nothing that would lead her to take such a leap of faith in such a short time and at such danger to herself. Afterall, the King's entourage is only at the Prince's estate for several days.
Still, Vatel does all he can to contribute to the restoration of his master's fortune, only to find out that he has been the subject of a bet during a card game, one which his master has lost to the King, who has coveted Vatel's artistry and entertainment virtuosity. Vatel discovers that he is to go to the Palace at Versailles, where he will now work. His spirit crushed by this and his heart broken on any number of fronts, Vatel, nonetheless, continues on to his very last breath with his heroic efforts to make his master succeed in with heart's desire.
Look for a beautifully nuanced performance by Depardieu, as well as a compelling one by Uma Thurman. Julian Sands is marvelous as the extravagant and morally bankrupt King of France. Julian Glover is excellent as the financially strapped Prince. The rest of the supporting cast is likewise superb. All this, as well as its visually dazzling art direction, however, is not enough to make it any more than a moderately entertaining period piece. It is a visually sumptuos confection that, ultimately, fails to satisy an appetite.",1003536000,21,2543,4.845977011494253
1615359,5,B00005K3OU,"With Vatel, I took a chance because I just bought a DVD player and had to buy a DVD, naturally.  I had enough reasons to buy this.  After all I adore Depardieu, love France, ""Amadeus"", ""Farinelli"" and I love watching how French teams almost always win Paul Bocuse competion with sheer confidence.  No wonder.  Now I have a better understanding of history behind the French culinary arts, to say the least.
I was also tired of waiting for the film ""The King is Dancing (Le Roi Danse)"" to come out on DVD in US.  Buying Lully's music pacified me for a while.  Any authentic movie about Roi Soleil would have done the job for me.  The result was, ""Wow!""  As another viewer said, the historically accurate set design took my breath away.  You really feel like you are there watching the show.  It was like Behind the scenes and Up close and personal looks at the creation of finest food in the world.
Vatel is simply grande, yet it is not phony or superficial.  I enjoyed Depardieu's presence.  Sure, it would have been better if he was speaking French,  but with his level of acting, a lot is said when he is NOT speaking.  Such profound emotion.  Then again, I've been his fan for decades so I may not be very objective.  Uma Thurman may be the only actress in America who can be in the French costume drama and not look out of place.  She was very picturesque.
Question:  The colors in the film looks like as if it was filmed in B&W then tinted.  I seem to remember only brown, gold(yellow) and lavender (blue) which leave strong impressions.  Like the color of Vatel's parrots.  Or was it just my TV's color setting?",1003104000,,1616,4.428571428571429
1615360,5,B00005K3OU,"This film is such a visual masterpiece! It's absolutely stunning from beginning to end. The set design is by far the most accurate historically that I have ever seen (and believe me, I have seen just about every 17th century period piece there is). The actors performances are overall, perfection. Gerard Depardieu does a magnificent job as playing the title role Vatel, who is a party planner extrodinare! The pretense is an all important visit from Louis XIV (played beautifully by Julian Sands) to Vatel's master's estate. Everything must be perfect so that the Sun King may grant Vatel's master a commanding generals position in an impending war with the Dutch and thus, bestowing riches upon him. Intrigue, lust and pure love is what transpires over the three days that Louis spends at the estate. Uma Thurman gives a great performance as a courtesan who catches most everyone's eye, including that of Vatel however, the King catches her first which complicates matters. Tim Roth gives a fine dastardly performance as a Marquis. In my opinion, this film is a masterpiece of set and costume design, such is the case that the actor performances are secondary, which is fine by me. I cannot praise this film enough, it has knocked off my all-time favorite period piece ""Restoration"" off of the first place pedestal. It is a gourmet feast for the eyes!",998870400,46,1353,4.886956521739131
1615361,4,B00005K3OU,"Gerard Depardieu is Vatel, the Martha Stewart to the Prince de Conde when the Sun King, Louis XIV, drops by for a banquet and entertainment in the ultra-lavish ""VATEL.""  This French production directed by Roland Joffe, from an original French screenplay by Jeanne Labrune adapted into an English version by highly regarded playwright Tom Stoppard is based on a real man and an actual incident.  The time is 1671.  Julian Glover is Prince Conde, who is bankrupt but seeks a royal appointment to wage war on the contumelious Dutch.  If he can put on a lavish enough reception, then Julian Sand's King Louis may reverse his fortunes.  But all depends on Depardieu's master steward Vatel creating and directing a big enough spectacle -- on credit with promises of payment after-the-fact -- for the all the senses of the king and his sycophants.  But in between the King and Vatel there is Uma Thurman's Anne de Montausier, the King's beautiful, and not quite morally benumbed ""lady-in-waiting"".  Tim Roth is the magniloquent Marquis de Lauzan one of the monarch's carousing buddies.  Murray Lachlan Young is the repellent king's brother with an unquenchable penchant for buggering little boys.
More than any movie of recent memory, this remarkable film is about indulgence and display in conflict with the moral decay festering under the glitzy surface like a deadly mold.  This staggeringly extravagant, unrestrained and somehow desperate festival at the center of this ultimately tragic melodrama evokes an alternate world that is both past and very much present (hint: a social class politically neutralized by the pursuit of pleasure).  Miramax is distributing this stunning widescreen DVD with little fanfare, maybe intimidated by the critics who didn't ""get it.""  The incredible production design alone is worth the ticket.  But this is much more than an elaborate costume drama and Depardieu as the brilliant but conflicted artist who discovers his conscience is remarkably understated and real.  I loved this movie.  This fabulous moral fable based on fact is a satisfying feast for the eyes and mind.  Highly recommended.",997833600,,2126,5.193548387096774
1615362,5,B00005K3OU,"It's 1671, and the King of France, Louis XIV, is looking for a general to carry war to the insufferably insolent Dutch. One of his nobles, the Prince de Cond&eacute;, wants the job, thinking such royal favor will relieve his chronic impoverishment. The Prince's strategy to entice the sovereign's attention is ... well, to throw a lavish party, of course. VATEL is Cond&eacute;'s master of the kitchen and entertainment planner for the big event, for which the King, his Queen, and a large coterie of sycophants will descend upon the Prince's country estate to be lavishly fed, housed, and amused for several days. The expense and bother of it all will be staggering.
G&eacute;rard Depardieu, Julian Sands and Julian Glover play the roles of VATEL, Louis XIV and Cond&eacute; respectively. Additionally, Uma Thurman plays Anne de Montausier, the King's favorite ""lady-in-waiting"". (""Waiting for what?"" would be an obtuse question.) And, Tim Roth has the role of the creepy Marquis de Lauzan, one of the monarch's carousing buddies.
The best elements of this outstanding film are the opulent costuming and production design. Indeed, the culmination to the King's entertainment is a sensational ""live event"" that is itself an eye-popping spectacle within a spectacle. Depardieu, relatively unknown to American audiences, gives a bravura performance as the over-worked, hard-pressed and self-sacrificing major domo struggling to make his boss look good on a shoestring budget. (His contribution to the alleviation of Cond&eacute;'s gout is particularly heart wrenching.) Roth, in a style he does so well, is exquisitely slimy as the villainous Marquis. Thurman is fetching as a young woman not yet too debased to not want something better out of her life.
In my opinion, VATEL should have won an Academy Award for art direction if nothing else. Visually, it's a truly sumptuous piece. The viewer will leave the screening disgusted at the extravagant excesses of past royalty, but certainly impressed with the flash of their presentation.",990576000,102,2034,5.30030959752322

1615385,5,B00005K3OU,"This is a fabulous film--obviously known for its stunning period costumes and art direction.  But the cast is first rate and working at the top of their bent--Depardieu is full of integrity and presence as the household steward Vatel whose tragedy is trusting in the honor of his employer, Uma Thurman as the lovely and gentle/kindly aristocrat caught up in the ugly toils of power and sex in Louis XIV's court, and Tim Roth in his inimitable evil characterization of a corrupt and heartless member of the court, pimping and manipulating for Louis XIV.  I love period films when they're intelligent and attempt to do justice to the time/place--this one does.  it is a portrait of a court of insane extravagance, monstrous pride and corruption, and the toils of politics and power woven around an absolute monarch, the Sun King.  It's not a happy story, but it filled with truth about how people deal with unjust power--do they submit and corrupt themselves or do they take whatever path they can to be free?

1615402,5,B00005K3OU,"Brilliant film. It's like watching a Peter Greenaway movie within a documentary perspective enhanced by the luscious strains of a Enio Morricone score and baroque period theatrical stagings set to the music of Jean Phillipe Rameau.

In essence the film portrays a slice of ""life at court"" in the literal sense; which in spite of it's depictions of superficially sumptuous delights; is in fact a glimpse into the grotesqueries of unbridled excess and treacherous machinations of the French nobility during the reign of the Sun King, Louis XIV.

Vatel is a relatively obscure figure in the storied life of the Bourbon Dynasty; he is a minor foot note at best, however his position as Majordomo or Chief Steward of the royal house of Louis de Bourbon, Prince de Cond provides a perfect window from which we can observe the sinister, self serving intrigues of the various courtiers, ministers and parasitic entourage of the Royal Court.

The abbreviated story of the Sun King's visit to the estate of the prince is a test of loyalty and an attempt to broker a reconciliation between the ruling monarch and the Prince de Cond whose family is a cadet branch of the Royal House of Bourbon.
The complexities of deciphering the Bourbon family tree is an arduous task that contributes little or no value to the film and the role of the Prince de Cond in the Franco-Spanish war is far too complicated and expansive to expound upon here, although the tale of this crucial visit is the perfect springboard for the films plot.

Gerard Depardieu delivers a most convincing portrayal as the encumbered Chief Steward in charge of creating a series of elaborate banquets and amusements for the royal court.
Uma Thurman provides an equally satisfying performance as Anne de Montausier; a noble woman recently summoned to the royal court to serve as Lady in Waiting to the queen.

The interaction between these two pivotal characters is a highly unlikely fabrication, although it provides a convenient basis from which we can expound upon the circumstances of their respective roles and the resulting consequences of this fictitious pairing.

Anne de Montausier ultimately tires of navigating the minefield of complex intrigues of court life  abandoning her role as Lady in Waiting and retires to her family estate.

Vatels alleged suicide is depicted as an unlikely dissatisfaction with a royal directive to leave the Prince de Cond and accept a position at the royal court at Versailles.
The depiction of his faithful obedience to the prince which borders on a carefully distanced friendship is palatable although probably exaggerated.

If we are to take the suicidal motives on face value as depicted in the film, it disproves the absurd but popular notion that a mishandled delivery of fish was the reason for self annihilation.

The film suggests that he no longer wished to serve the Royal prerogatives at Versailles and bemoans the the fact that persons of his low birth and rank are nothing but tools and puppets of the ruling class.

This supposition is contradicted by the fact that previous to his position as majordomo to the  Prince de Cond; he was also Chief Steward to Nicolas Fouquet, the doomed former Minister of Finance; so a directive to relocate to Versailles was nothing more than a glorified promotion, and Vatel would most certainly not be any stranger to satisfying the whims of the royal court.

It is hinted that Vatel was detrimentally obsessed with the preparations for the royal visit and had not slept for the majority of the grandiose 3 day fte. It is this premise that is the most likely reason for his suicide, no matter how unromantic and anticlimactic this may seem.
it is essential for the audience to exercise at least a modicum of common sense to overlook some of the ridiculous allegations associated with Vatels suicide.

The extreme effects of sleep deprivation culminating in suicide is coldly clinical and decidedly bereft of any dramatic operatic like conclusion to this story, but the premise that somebody kills themselves over a missed delivery of fish is outrageous beyond any sense of reality and patently comical.

All in all, this overly romanticized and lushly embellished production is impressively entertaining and visually stunning.",1431561600,,4268,5.008474576271187

Without putting to fine a point on it, the central character, Vatel, is a cipher, because of Depardieu's inability to say/read his English language lines with any measure of conviction, intelligence, or even at times simple comprehension. All the hustle and bustle around him mean little as the main character bumbles and lurches through his part.
A subsidiary gripe: the musical score is just awful. Oboes play on screen, and recorder music comes out of your TV, etc etc. In 2000, when the film was made, there were plenty of good baroque music specialists who could have made an intelligent and graceful score.

I won't even get into how completely wrong the versions of Cond&eacute; and Lauzun are in this movie, vis a vis the real (& very interesting) personalities. But to invent a wholly fictitious love story for Vatel, and to have that become his primary motivation, totally twists the meaning of what happened into something that no one in the 17th century would either understand or value. In the original incident, as recounted by Mme de Sevign&eacute;, Vatel killed himself for honor, because he (mistakenly) thought the event he was managing had become a disastrous failure and he took it personally.

Vatel as presented in the film is a master of food and entertainment with a gift for improvisation and his own standards of perfection.

As some other reviewers have noted, the story here is a little thin.  How do you make a film about a chef working to prepare a feast?  You add Uma Thurman, who plays a love interest of King Louis XIV, courtier Roth, and of course Vatel.  This contrivance works, although the ending is not satisfying.

Depardieu performs well as Vatel.  Roth is a very over-rated actor who can only play one character, characterize in one way, and never manages to master other aspects of acting like accents.  He takes you out of the film every time he's on screen, and you just wish he would go away but the film can recover.  Uma Thurman is convincing in an undemanding role.  The other actors were not known to me but did fine.

1615474,5,B00005K3OU,"Vatel brings to the screen the story of a French noble's manservant whose task is to set up three-day long extravagant activities to keep King Louis XIV and his entourage entertained.
The setting is Chantilly in 1671 and the Prince de Conde's head steward, Vatel, is trying to put on the show of a lifetime for his master who wishes to be assigned command of the French armies in an upcoming war against the Dutch. Vatel, however, will soon find out that the difficulties encountered go well beyond the technical aspect...
The film brings to the screen two main stories, which are unfolding simultaneously: On the one hand, life at Louis XIV's court (along with the first signs that things are not going well such as wasteful, corrupt, and overly aloof royals, bankrupt nobles, and unpaid creditors; in essence important factors contributing to the 1789 French Revolution that is to come), and on the other, Vatel's inner struggle with his own emotions.
The movie portrays life in France in the seventeenth century and provides valuable insight into a very important period of French (European) History. We get a taste (though a very light one) of France's domestic and foreign political situation (i.e. corruption, clientelism, and cronyism as well as tense Franco-Dutch relations).
Gerard Depardieu, Uma Thurman, Julian Sands, Julian Glover, Tim Roth, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows!
The setting, the dialogues, the music, and the costumes are all wonderful!
Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a thought-provoking movie that will definitely provide for an evening's entertainment.

1615479,2,B00005K3OU,"Roland Joffe directed two masterpieces: The Killing Fields & The Mission. But those two films, directed in 1984 & 1986, were made twenty or more years ago. I'd recommend either of those two films to anybody but Vatel I would recommend only to those viewers who can enjoy a film for its look, its set design and its attention to period detail even when the story and characters themselves are not all that captivating.

Vatel is a film that should have everything going for it. As mentioned the director has at least two masterpieces to his credit, Tom Stoppard had a hand in the screenplay (more on that in a minute), Uma Thurman is beautiful, and Gerard Depardieu & Julian Sands & Tim Roth are each capable of delivering memorable performances when they feel inspired. The problem is no one feels inspired by this material. And that is in part due to a lackluster set of characters--supposedly based on actual people--and a story that never really manages to capture our imagination.

Gerard Depardieu as master steward ""Vatel"" is required by his boss, the gout-stricken Prince Conde aka General Conde, to arrange elaborate feasts and entertainments for a visiting retinue of royals that include King Louis XIV, his mistresses, his brother, and various advisors & handlers. If these feasts and entertainments succeed in capturing the kings fancy then Vatel's boss may receive the honor of commanding the French troops in a war with Holland (that may or may not happen). So virtually every frame of the film is dedicated to following Vatel as he personally oversees virtually every dish and set decoration before it is presented to the royal retinue. As viewers we are amazed by Vatel's ingenuity with everything from outdoor theatrical sets that resemble large fold-out books to his ability to make delicate lanterns out of vegetable gourds (Martha Stewart would be impressed) but our interest is purely aesthetic because we never really care whether the Prince gets his royal comission or not and we barely care about Vatel. Next to the selfish, scheming and utterly corrupt royals the selfless and earthy and incorruptible Vatel seems, well, selfless and earthy and incorruptible. Along with his many domestic and artistic talents Vatel also has an uncanny way of understanding people's true natures and needs better than they. The problem with Vatel is that he is perhaps too selfless and so while he busies himself with entertaining others his own life is virtually a non-event.

Uma Thurman plays a woman of precarious social standing. She is from a noble family but her position at court is not yet secure and like everyone else she must humor the King to assure his continued favor. When he suggests that they meet in private ""for a cup of chocolate"" she has no choice but to agree. She is under no illusion that she is anything but a temporary amusement for the King but to refuse the King's advances would be social suicide. The royal world sickens her and we are supposed to see her as somehow too earthy and real for court life but one problem is that this character is barely there. Uma just barely goes through the motions when she is onscreen; instead of seeming like she is dissatisfied with court life she just looks like she is dissatisfied with having to be in this royal dud of a picture. This is too bad because she is supposed to be the muse that awakens or re-awakens Vatel's long dormant passions but there is absolutely zero spark between Uma Thurman and Gerard Depardieu. When the obese fifty-something Depardieu kisses the thirty-something Uma we just don't get it. Few screen romances have ever felt so unconvincing and so void of passion and so uncomfortable to watch. We do know that Depardieu as Vatel is capable of feeling affection because he is very fond of his pet parrots but alas none of this affection is apparent when Uma Thurman is in frame. We're supposed to feel that its the rabid social competition of court life that reduces love to a mere game of conquest and that true love in such a world doesn't have a chance. Instead what we feel is that lack of chemistry between actors is what kills passion.  Since the Depardieu-Thurman romance doesn't manage to throw off even one spark the primary story-line is D.O.A. . The elaborate theatrical productions and fireworks displays might hold your attention for a few minutes but this film is not interesting enough to hold your attention for two hours.

Julian Sands does a pretty good job as King Louis XIV and Tim Roth an ok job as one of the kings advisors but neither of these actors are given anything very interesting to do or say. Though Tom Stoppard's name appears in the credits when you look closer you realize that Tom Stoppard didn't write an original screenplay rather he merely adapted a French text. Thus even though this film tries to ride on the coat tails of the Stoppard penned Shakespeare in Love this production does not have any of Stoppard's signature cleverness or wit.",1163289600,10,4982,4.788372093023256
1615480,3,B00005K3OU,"This exquisitely wrought film is a sumptuous visual masterpiece. While it is, undoubtedly, a feast for the eyes, with stunningly beautiful sets and costumes, the storyline does not keep pace with the visuals.

The story itself is simple. The King of France (Julian Sands) and his royal retinue and entourage of sycophants pay a visit to the financially pressed Prince de Conde (Julian Glover). The Prince impresses upon his steward, Vatel (Gerard Depardieu), the importance of the King's visit, as the Prince hopes, should his efforts to please the King succeed, for a war time Royal appointment to lead troops against the fractious Dutch in order to restore his too depleted fortunes.

Vatel does all that he can on a shoestring budget, and his efforts are glorious indeed, beautifully rendered and an absolute delight. Vatel's eye is caught, however, by one of the King's mistresses, Anne De Montausier (Uma Thurman), a woman whose tender nature has not, as yet, been hardened by the cruelties displayed by the ruling class, and he is smitten. His affection is eventually returned by Her, and it is here that the story line begins to pall, not because Depardieu is considerably older and timeworn, and Thurman is young and beautiful. It palls because there is really nothing that would lead her to take such a leap of faith in such a short time and at such danger to herself. Afterall, the King's entourage is only at the Prince's estate for several days.

Still, Vatel does all he can to contribute to the restoration of his master's fortune, only to find out that he has been the subject of a bet during a card game, one which his master has lost to the King, who has coveted Vatel's artistry and entertainment virtuosity. Vatel discovers that he is to go to the Palace at Versailles, where he will now work. His spirit crushed by this and his heart broken on any number of fronts, Vatel, nonetheless, continues on to his very last breath with his heroic efforts to make his master succeed in with heart's desire.

Look for a beautifully nuanced performance by Depardieu, as well as a compelling one by Uma Thurman. Julian Sands is marvelous as the extravagant and morally bankrupt King of France. Julian Glover is excellent as the financially strapped Prince. The rest of the supporting cast is likewise superb. All this, as well as its visually dazzling art direction, however, is not enough to make it any more than a moderately entertaining period piece. It is a visually sumptuos confection that, ultimately, fails to satisy an appetite.",1147651200,,2546,4.845977011494253
1615481,5,B00005K3OU,"Vatel, perhaps a weak title to a spectacular film; it recreates the excesses of the French court in its pre-off-with-their-heads-phase. In order to escape bankruptcy, the gout afflicted Viscount must entertain the King so sumptuously and so entreatingly, that the King may commission a war with Holland, thereby paying the Viscount's debts. To keep the King and his courtiers entertained, it was no small thing, so the entire countryside is enlisted in the feasts and entertainment. None will be paid unless the banquets are a success. Louis' entourage of Queen, mistresses, and waggish cavaliers run riot through the festivities. The fete is essentially an Olympic opening parade that goes on for three days in dazzling costume orchestrated by one great artist, the Viscount's steward, Vatel.

Vatel orchestrates the extravaganzas and falls for Uma Thurman, the King's new mistress. She is not yet the jaded courtesan and sees greatness in Vatel's can-do veneer. Indeed, Vatel is a man of integrity, denying the King's pedophile brother a young kitchen boy at the risk of his life. Vatel swats away meddling noblemen and women for the entire feast while making love to Thurman, star-crossed lovers though they are. Gerard Depardieu is brilliant even with his modest grasp of English.",1147651200,6,1284,5.233009708737864

""Vatel"" has apparently kept Joffe out of the director's chair for the last 5 years.  Visually, it is stunning.  If you love period pieces with spectacle, this is going to be great!  The costumes are gorgeous and the sets exquisite.  The banquet with fireworks and ice sculptures is visually stunning.  Gerard Depardieu who is one of the most consistent working actors in the world and got his sole Oscar nomination in 1990 for Cyrano de Bergerac does a good job in his role.  I found the picture was about courage.  As Vatel, he stands up to the brother of Louis XIV who wants to use a kitchen boy for his sexual pleasure.  Vatel seems to have a modern sense of outrage and protects the young lad, only to himself become the target of the brotherly affections.  Vatel works for Prince De Conde played by Julian Glover from ""Troy"" while his lovely daughter Princesse De Conde played by Arielle Dombasle romps around lightheartedly.  Julian Sands as Louis XIV who previously worked with Joffe in ""The Killing Fields"" plays the king with a balance of style and danger.  Tim Roth plays the rather unsympathetic Marquis De Lauzun and hits on Uma Thurman.  As the lady in waiting honored by the king's bed, Thurman is lovely and is one of the few along with Vatel to show a sense of ethics.  Her role highlights the dependency of women of her day on pleasing men and her scene where she breaks down is heart-wrenching.  ""Vatel"" certainly is not a flawless film, but it is delivered with style and panache.  The themes of courage and personal ethics make it a film about something important.

1615483,2,B00005K3OU,"The biggest French box-office disaster in recent memory (it lost more money than Heaven's Gate, wiped out the massive profits of Asterix et Obelix Contre Cesar and nearly took Gaumont with it), this pretty much completes Roland Joffe's unbroken post-The Mission run of box-office and artistic failure. While not as bad as The Scarlet Letter, it's also not as much fun. Unfortunately, this is the kind of film Martha Stewart or Delia Smith might appreciate, but few others will.

It all starts off so well. So well that I was wondering why this has such a bad reputation, but it quickly becomes apparent that it really is just a film about a lavish three-day party seen from the point of view of the caterers. The fact that the party is thrown for the Sun King gives it plenty of visual opulence, but the lack of substance becomes more and more apparent as it drags on towards the third day - it's definitely one of those parties that goes on way too long and which you should have left much earlier while it was still in full swing. When one of the characters kills themselves because there aren't enough fish to go around and the script strains to turn it into an act of revolt against a world where nobility of the spirit counts less than accidents of birth, you know that someone's reading a little too much into it.

Gerard Depardieu looks alarmingly unhealthy throughout, Tim Roth gives a very bored reprise of his Rob Roy party piece and the wooden Uma Thurman is borderline disastrous/vaguely competent (the scene where she stops the wind by force of will is one of the most laughable pieces of face pulling in recent years). The supporting cast fare better - mostly Brits like Julian Glover, Timothy Spall, Richard Griffiths and Julian Sands. Shot in English, it is very odd to note that Depardieu is dubbed for the odd few words (but rarely full sentences) by another, very British sounding actor. Maybe he was too ill to make the ADR sessions.

It is lavish and you can see where the money was spent, you just can't see why.",1090108800,,2034,4.582417582417582

With that said, I didn't like Vatel, which had all of the above qualities.  This is due to a lack of remotely serviceable story.
Louis the 14th is visiting the estate of Prince de Conde, who hopes to wrangle an army commande from the king to pay off his heavy debts. His faithful steward, Vatel, is charged with ensuring that the King's visit will be memorable one.  Vatel is a genius in all the arts of housekeeping and entertaining, a veritable 17th century Martha Stewart.  Of course, when the House of Bourbon come a calling, the word ""entertaining"" acquire a whole new level of meaning.  Throughout the movie we are treated to one dazzling set piece after another of Vatel's epic efforts.
Unfortunately, the highlights are overshadowed by very underwhelming story and characters.  The central romance between Vatel and the lady-in-waiting generate less electricity than a AAA battery, and is implausible to boot.  Bobbing along in the movie is a theme of a decent man standing up to a world of corruption.  But with most of the filmmaker's effort focused on the lavish parties, it quickly gets lost amidst all the fireworks, ice-sculptures and food-preparation.
Of course, all that is pretty enjoyable to watch. Your eyes will have a feast, but it's mostly empty calories.",1087689600,9,1448,4.9300411522633745

The direction is first rate , the astonishing visual angles are supported by a descriptive style, breathtaking ""travellings"" ,  monumental images and a superb cast. Depardieu show us once more why he's a living legend and one of the top twenty actors in the world; the exquisite and exceptionally gifted and beautiful Uma Thurman gives probably the most powerful performance in her career and obviously Tim Roth, amazing as always.

It's difficult watching an hour and a half of hundreds of people making themselves miserable trying to please a childish king so that he might hire the owner of the chateau to go to war.  The ""good"" characters are strongly outnumbered by the slimy ones, and when it's over I felt nothing but sadness and hopelessness, having seen how human beings were treated as nothing more than garbage by the members of the royal court.
No characters here grow or change or learn--they only suffer.  One character does make a change in her life, but does so by leaving, and we never even see how she comes to this dramatic decision--we just see her carriage driving off.
The only purpose that I can see for this film is to present some documentation of the lavish extravagance that members of royalty were used to and expected, and to see to some extent how the royal court functioned and how people in it lived.  Students of French royalty of the era might enjoy this for the costumes and settings, but the story definitely will let them down.
The two stars are for the technical aspects, the acting, and the direction.  Other than that, I wouldn't recommend this film at all, as there's little here to enjoy.",1050796800,8,1328,4.610169491525424

The art direction during the banquets is very impressive, but there is little else of interest in this tale of aristocratic decadence and trickery.  The only extra on the DVD is a very short piece supposedly (but hardly actually) about the film's costumes.

Unfortunately, there has to be more to a film than that---there needs to be compelling, 3-dimensional characters and a decent plot.  In both respects, this film falls short.
Instead what we have is a slow-paced costume drama with cardboard characters: Depardieu, as the silent but pure-hearted and hardworking Noble Servant; Tim Roth in a stock role as the ruthlessly conniving court advisor; dull-witted but decadent royalty wielding unlimited power over their hapless subjects; Thurman as innocence-waiting-to-be-crushed.  It's all stuff we've seen a million times before but unlike ""Dangerous Liasons"" this film has no verve, plot twists and surprising character development to keep it humming.  1-2-3, drearily predictable, you know what's going to happen a good 30 minutes before it happens.

VATEL is an absolute visual masterpiece--the costumes, scenery, special effects, and accute attention to detail left me breathless as I watched this film not once, not twice, but three times.  This is a film about a master party planner, and it certainly delivers on that premise.
VATEL, played by French actor Gerard Depardieu, is a fiercly loyal steward to his master--he rarely sleeps during the king's visit because he alone is responsible for the successful staging of the over-the-top festivities.  I suspect the audience is supposed to get a good sense of his rags-to-riches story, admire him for his selfless service to his bosses, and root for him when he falls for the impossible Anne (Uma Thurman in an understated role) but the character of VATEL, as poignant as it is, is all but lost in the overwhelming eye candy of this film.  Other subtle hints at the lavishly opulent lifestyle of royalty (nothing has changed, really) and distinct separation of the ""servant"" and ""the served"" are also fuzzed by the abounding superfluity.  The lack of sufficient buildup to VATEL's final decision left me a little confused until I watched it again and was finally able to focus on the actual storyline.
While watching this film for the first time, one will be too overwhelmed with the artistry of this picture--which explains why it was nominated for the art direction Academy Award--but the real ""plot"" is there and it's a good one.

  and the fish failed to arrive in time, Vatel committed suicide. The authenticity of this story is doubtful.
  -The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2001.
Playwright/Screenwriter Tom Stoppard and Director Roland Joffe have taken the Francois Vatel of historical legend and turned him into a
quintessential French hero in this fabulous looking but oddly soulless film.  In France in 1671, Louis XIV is King and, as Mel Brooks might say : ""It's
good to be the King!"" Fab babes are always ready to get their freak on with you and your nobles will do anything to curry favor.  So when the Prince
de Conde is informed that Louis and his court will be coming to visit his estate , Chantilly, Conde tells his famed steward Vatel to pull out all the
stops.  Perversely, Conde, who is in desperate need of money, will have to plunge himself even deeper into debt in the mere hope that Louis will
choose him to command the royal forces in the coming war with Holland.
Given a blank check, Vatel proceeds to put on the most sumptuous and ornate feasting imaginable.  There's a moment early in the King's visit where
as the King walks through the garden the scenery rises, collapses, is rearranged and fits together again like pieces of an elaborate puzzle--by itself this
scene is worth the price of admission.  It is remarkable.  As the visit goes on, Vatel must improvise when shortages crop up, must respond to the
extravagant requests of the various guests, and must navigate the petty jealousies of the spoiled visitors.  He gets himself in a real bind when he
dallies with the beautiful and reserved Anne de Montausier (Uma Thurman) who is both the King's latest favorite and the object of desire of the nasty
and vindictive Marquis de Lauzon (Tim Roth).
The caged bird imagery that Mr. Joffe resorts to is a tad heavy-handed, but the film nicely captures the stratification of society (though that does make
the relationship between Vatel and Anne rather improbable) and shows the degree to which everyone is subject to the whims of the King, who can
make or break you with the wave of his hand.  Gerard Depardieu as Vatel is appealingly earnest and his total commitment to his work raises it to the
level of artistry.  He is so decent, and the culture around him so indecent, that we can understand why Anne is attracted to him, even if we don't
believe they could have been friends given the circumstances of the day, let alone lovers.
Then the story takes a couple of odd twists, one that seems to have been pilfered from Ruggles of Red Gap, as Conde loses Vatel to the King in a
card game, then one which matches the fate of the historical Vatel but which occurs for precisely the opposite reason.  In real life Vatel supposedly
killed himself for failing to serve the King well, here he kills himself rather than serve the King at all.  That seems too much license to take with
history.
The film received a well-deserved Oscar nomination for Art Direction, but one wonders if so much energy went into the look of the movie that the
filmmakers lost track of the need to tell a compelling story along with the pretty pictures.  When the climactic scene of the film was going on it came
so suddenly and was shot so obliquely that, not knowing the background of the story,  I honestly didn't realize what had happened right away.  The
logic they saw on their story boards didn't quite make it to the screen.  It's definitely worth seeing (and DVD is a must), but you can probably watch
with the sound off; it's intended to be looked at more than watched.

1615507,4,B00005K3OU,"Chances are you've never heard of either Vatel, the movie, or Vatel, the legendary French historical figure. The movie was a huge hit in Europe but little seen in America. As for Vatel himself, he may have been a footnote in history, but he' a fascinating one.
Vatel is a costume drama set on a lavish French estate in the 17th Century. There are those who simply do not like movies that take place in the distant past, and there's nothing that can change that. This attitude has little to do with our times. These films have always turned some people off. Sixty years ago, the head of a major studio turned to one of his assistants and said, ""I don't want to see any more movies where people write with feathers!"" He hated such pictures, even though they had made a fortune for his company. I personally enjoy them. Recently, I saw an interview with a costume designer who pointed out that they are as close as we are likely to get to time travel.
It is the time of Louis XIV, the Sun King. He was the man who built Versailles, perhaps the most opulent palace ever conceived. Actually, he was something of a control freak. By keeping many of the lords and ladies of France at Versailles, he could keep an eye on them. Countries then were not nearly as unified as they are today. Intrigue was everywhere, and keeping one's throne, as well as one's head, was a tricky business. Louis kept both.
Gourville [Timothy Spall] was a man with an opulent lifestyle and very little cash. He was also a great general, and the threat of war with Holland brought a letter from Louis [Julian Sand] announcing his intention of coming to Gourville's chateau to visit for several days. The king's assistant, Marquise De Cauzan [Tim Roth], implied that, if the visit was pleasurable to Louis, Gourville would head the army in the fight with Holland. The money he would be paid would make him rich again. He went to Vatel [Gerard Depardieu], the master of his household, and begged him to put on a magnificent show for the king. Vatel was a clever man and was trained in many arts. The feasts, dances and entertainments he created for the king's stay are said to have been some of the most opulent ever devised. It was all a great success, but Vatel could never have imagined the price he would pay for his efforts or the effect the beautiful Anne de Menausier [Uma Thruman], who was travelling with the king, would have on him.
This is one of the most lavish films around, and it's an old-fashioned lavish, not the new kind that's cleverly composed with computer graphics. The sets and the costumes are amazing, and I broke into a sweat just thinking about the work that went into them While director Roland Jaffe says that you cannot really recreate the past because you will always put a modern spin on it that audiences can relate to, he has certainly done a fine job of giving us a grand illusion of life in the 17th Century. Despite all the sumptuous trappings, he still manages to focus on the characters, all played by marvelous actors. Not only is Vatel wonderful to look at, it tells a wonderful story as well.",1016064000,6,3101,4.5
1615508,5,B00005K3OU,"Vatel, a steward in the house of the Prince de Conde, wishes to impress Louix XIV by orchestrating a sumptious three-day feast.
Vatel's motivation is two-fold:  If he can impress the king with his elaborate festivities, he will win approval for his master, which will bring much needed money into that man's coffers.  Vatel is the type of person who keeps deep feelings at bay by organizing and managing his life and the lives of others.  To succeed in impressing the king would be the ultimate challenge to his organizational and managerial skills.
There are many minor conflicts in this story.  Vatel's master is nearly bankrupt and the creditors do not wish to extend him more credit to pay for the food and pyrotechnics. The fishmongers are unable to obtain enough fish to feed the royal party, the candle globes break during shipment, and a worker is accidentaly killed during one of the fireworks shows.  But, the biggest external conflict is between Vatel and the villain, the Duc de Lauzun, who is jealous of his connection to a certain noble lady.  The internal conflict is intense.  Admist all of the festivities and preparations, Vatel has fallen in love with one of the royal guests.  Because of his impoverished background and demanding position in his master's household, he does not allow himself to connect deeply with others.  The feelings he has for the young woman wreak havoc in his neatly ordered life.
