8747252,1,B01AFN8HCO,"no direction. this JOSH is a honking goose with no comb. his affinity is to be non-committal on experience. all affect is flat and drab. there is no joy to this BOYZ life.
he has people who orbit within his eyesight but there is no connection. he loves a dog but will not fill up the water bowl. JOSH is a piece of whiteboard and we just paint our experiences on to his surface. there is no there, there. putty boy",1514073600,,414,4.1234567901234565
