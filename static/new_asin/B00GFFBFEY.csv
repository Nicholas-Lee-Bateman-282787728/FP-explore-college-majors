8622619,3,B00GFFBFEY,"Regrettably, no producer's interview is available to gauge some sense of this work presenting a mix of reality with schizophrenic delusions.

Sometimes it's really hard to distinct between a major character and his rich-tattooed lodger, either friend or brother of him, who is seducing into the shadow pleasures like devil and doing all things bad.

Something similar to ""VizitorD"" plus anus-hungry drug dealer-turned-
zombie and sex-obsessed masturbating dad.",1456272000,,460,5.75
8622620,1,B00GFFBFEY,"Don't know what this confused mess was all about, but if you have a brain that works, avoid this flick at all costs. To be fair, the tattooed guy was great in it, but he was struggling against a really uncomfortable plot and thoroughly repulsive fellow characters, and there was no saving this film.",1455235200,,299,4.555555555555555
8622621,5,B00GFFBFEY,"Adam Mason pours a cocktail of taboos in the independent film ""Junkie"". Sex! Drugs! Rock and Roll? (Well, there is a cool soundtrack of songs by The Dogs d'Amour) But, in ""Junkie"" the third word to add to any proclamation starting with Sex & Drugs is blood. And, damn straight, there are buckets of it. Here, there, everywhere.

So, now that the obvious aspect of the film is out of the way; let's move into what makes Adam Mason's ""Junkie"" a hypnotic trip. Broken family. Broken dreams. Broken house. Danny and Nicky are in a fight between themselves, the past and future. And in this film, the ring these two square off in a house that looks like it's stuck in a time warp.

Dirty dishes, dirty house and dirty souls all about. Danny (Daniel Louis Rivas) dwells in depression. Nicky (Robert LaSardo) exists in excess.

When their drug connection Otto (Tomas Boykin ) arrives, he tickles the brothers' funny bones and veins. Danny's ex Sonja (Tess Panzer) pops by to see if the wagon is in tact; or if he's burning it down like the bridge of their relationship. Toss in Dad (Andrew Howard) into this mix; and, the twisting of sobriety and sanity goes through the roof and gets straddled into the basement for both brothers.

Rivas' performance has a twitchy Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates quality to it. His character of Danny is low-key. Now, of course when one key is low, another has to be crashing the cymbals.

And, in ""Junkie"", Robert LaSardo's character Nicky does just that. His performance is as high as helium and furious as a Tasmanian devil. Adam Mason's direction plays off both character's quirks. In an unobtrusive style, director Mason lets the camera fall back and let the actors rip it up. Robert LaSardo is an unguided missile in red boxer trunks. For that character, that wardrobe is an apt choice. Nicky's battling his brother and clawing for a championship. Danny, on the other hand, is just trying to stay one step ahead of the next round coming around the bend.

Written by Simon Boyes and Adam Mason, there is an improvisational quality to the interactions of the leads and supporting cast. And, if you look closely, there is even a scene with a flash of poignancy between both brothers. It passes by quickly, but Nicky (Robert LaSardo) and Danny (Daniel Louis Rivas) really hit the mark in that scene.

Adam Mason's ""Junkie"" proves that the greatest obstacle to getting clean and sober is the person who knows us best.",1431907200,,2446,4.687645687645688

8622624,5,B00GFFBFEY,"A dark horror comedy that kept your attention. Tomas Boykin, Robert Lasardo and the cast was awesome in this great production.",1387238400,,126,5.0476190476190474
8622625,4,B00GFFBFEY,"When I first saw the cover of this DVD, I thought it was a serious and dark film.  As it turns out, I was halfway right; the film is really dark, although its certainly not serious at all.  This self-described pitch black comedy is surrealistic trip through crazy territory...and its worth every minute of it!

If you are easily offended, youd probably better skip this film.  Its full of crude and crass  humor, but I loved it.  Yet its also so much more than a dark comedy.  If you look deep enough, you can find a lot of symbolism and metaphor.  This aspect is a big part of what makes the movie so good.

JUNKIE is shot very well, and I especially like the opening credits sequence.  Each member of the cast and crew is listed on a torn off piece of newspaper that has been tacked or taped somewhere around the house.  While this probably cost only $5.00 to film, this ingenious credits design looks excellent onscreen and also helps to set the tone for the whole film.

The acting is incredible, with Daniel Louis Rivas giving an excellent performance as the titular character.  But the rest of the cast rocks, too.  Robert LaSardo gives a commanding bit of realism to his character, and Tomas Boykin owns his role as the drug dealer Otto.

My sole complaint about JUNKIE is that its hard to really make out what is going on, especially at the end.  *WARNING: SPOILERS FOLLOW*  If Im correct, Danny is actually an ex-junkie who has vivid nightmares about his tripping days...and the whole film is one of those dreams.  When he gets the phone call from Sonja, he chooses to ignore it because he cant handle both his stress AND hers.  Im not sure if Im right on this, but thats my perception of what happened.

Regardless of whether Im right or wrong, JUNKIE is an excellent head-trip of a movie and I recommend it to anyone who likes quirky, unique films.  But don't give it a look if you object to hard Rated R material; you will quickly find yourself upset.  The film is available now in a variety of formats.",1384473600,2,2015,4.448087431693989
