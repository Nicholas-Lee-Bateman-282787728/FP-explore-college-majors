7845626,5,6303398448,"This has that Altman mix; often brilliant, and occasionally over the-top, and self conscious. The acting is generally good, but a little uneven. Some characters are very real, others come off as pure caricature. The series felt longer than it needed to be to make its points. The middle
episodes were a bit boring.
(Spoiler alert!)

But then there's the episode where Tanner goes into the hood and meets w/real mothers of murdered kids, in a lengthy improvised scene of pain and anger which is simply devastating, and the whole series felt redeemed.

Overall, while watching it, I liked it, not loved it. But looking back, it left me with a much more powerful and lasting impression. And on 2nd viewing the sad power of the piece seemed much more important than the occasional flaws.",1436572800,,783,4.792592592592593
