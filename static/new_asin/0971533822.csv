7794394,3,0971533822,"Overall this tape is helpful with regard to teaching your baby to sign. The basics are covered in here along with the justification for teaching your baby to sign things like, drink, poop, hungry, thirsty... and so on. Maybe if this was a DVD it would have been more useful, it just seemed that they rushed it a bit and left out many other aspects of signing. All in all its ok, but I would recommend looking somewhere else for more in-depth training for your baby.

Thank you for reading my review.",1272326400,,499,4.423913043478261
7794395,5,0971533822,I think using signs when a child is too young to talk is the only way to go.  This book was great.,1168473600,,98,3.4545454545454546
7794396,5,0971533822,"It was my daughter's first birthday and she has the flu.  We just got this video and popped in her for her.  She loved this video and learned all the signs that week.  She can tell us when she needs her diaper changed, if she's hungry, thirsty, wants more of anything, sleepy, or wants to see the moon at night and many more things.  She expresses herself so clearly with these signs.  We have found this video to be so helpful in our communication with her.  She doesn't need to cry anymore to get what she wants, now all she does is sign to us and we understand each other.  We love it!  Highly recommend this to new moms and dads!",1018915200,,633,4.1735537190082646
7794397,5,0971533822,"I was sceptical when a friend suggeted that I try teaching baby sign to my son.  My wife was also very sceptical  that it could be  of any use.  We were both amazed and amused at how fast he learned  and how helpful it was in our daily routines. A  12 month old that could ask for food or drink directly without crying or fussing.  You've got to love that . My oldest son (3 yrs) learned the signs as well just to help his brother out.  They both enjoyed the simple entertaining video and for a time it was the tape that was most requested.( using the baby sign for ""more"" of course"") I could not recommend the tape or the method more highly.  As  he learns to speak he uses the baby signs in  conjuction  with his  new  vocabulary just for fun. ("" Please"" and ""elephant"" are his favorites)  Teaching Baby signs is worth the little  bit of effort and the quality time that you get to spend with your kids.",1017964800,3,905,4.144508670520231
7794398,5,0971533822,"I love this video.  I started using it with my son when he was just 7 months old, and the results are incredible.  The great thing about Baby Signs is that they've customized some signs to be EXTREMELY easy for babies!  Babies can learn and use the most basic signs before they even have complete control of their hands! (the very simplest signs are made with the mouth - which babies have great control over at a very young age.)  Baby Signs proves how much cognitive ability babies have before their motor skills even develop.  My son, now 13 months, knows and uses not only the signs from the tape but other ASL and non-ASL signs as well.  He can tell me what he wants, what he is thinking about, and even make little puns.  It sounds impossible but its true. This video made me a better parent and made my son a much more engaged, less frustrated baby.  Please do this with your baby, you won't be disappointed.",1017792000,5,915,4.372781065088757
7794399,5,0971533822,"One of the parents at our daycare told me about BABY SIGNS and I didn't believe it until I saw it in action.  Soon after she began the program her daughter used the sign for ""more"" at the center!  Then  one day at her house saw the baby use Baby Signs to ask for more food, to tell her mom she was ready for her nap, and to ask  what happened to the rain (why wasn't it raining after she woke up!).  It was amazing!  I've worked with a lot of babies and this is truly great!  I got the tape and the book for my son (he's 6 months, a little young yet) but other parents at our center are using it now.  Its incredible. We recommend it to everyone who registers!  Do this for your baby!",1016582400,4,684,3.898550724637681
7794400,1,0971533822,"I was very disappointed with this video. Besides the fact that it does not use American Sign Language (ASL) signs (which I believe is more beneficial for my child to learn in the long run as it will allow her to understand and ""speak"" a second language) the production of the video is extremely poor. It looks like the producers just got their kids together and told them what signs to do in front of the camera. There is nothing in this video that keeps my child's attention long enough for her to learn anything. For anyone serious about teaching their child signs I suggest See N Sign or the Sign With Your Baby kit. The kit is fabulous and worth the money if you are interested in your child learning something that will not only help him or her now to learn signs, but to help your child learn signs that can be useful in the future.",1014249600,4,838,4.310126582278481
7794401,5,0971533822,"There are not many videos directed at babies, and of those not many are quality productions.  and This isn't Disney - it is not only entertaining but so useful - To be able to communicate with little ones so early is incredible and both parents, caregivers and babies enjoy learning this way.  Thank you to the authors and producers for this wonderful approach.  It really works!",1005177600,9,379,4.712121212121212
7794402,5,0971533822,"This video is one of a kind!  My wife bought baby signs about a month ago for our 11 month old boy and I have to tell you at first I had my doubts.  We started showing it to him and within days he was signing!  Our 4 year old daughter loves it too.  They watch it together and play games making up signs for things.  One of the great things about this video is the music.  A lot of kids videos have repetitious music that can be annoying but not baby signs, I should know too since my kids watch it at least once a day.  I even find myself singing along.  The greatest thing though is the first time your baby signs to you.  Being able to communicate with your baby is priceless.",1004054400,11,679,3.9703703703703703
