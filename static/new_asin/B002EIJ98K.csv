3917633,1,B002EIJ98K,"Saw this movie as a child and it stuck with me ever since. Saw it on TV countless times, had a VCR copy I'd taped until recently accidentally taped over it. Saw this on Amazon and decided to order it. When I watched it, however, I was disappointed to see that the video transfer was of the poorest quality. If I'd had the equipment, I could have transferred my VHS copy to DVD and got a better picture and sound quality. Amazon definitely needs to be more aware of the quality of some of the products it sells...this one definitely fell through the cracks.",1293321600,10,556,4.355769230769231
3917634,5,B002EIJ98K,"""Mysterious Monsters"" is a nostalgic look at the unknown creatures of the world, or at leat a partial view of some of them. I like Peter Graves as the narrator/guide thru the world of the strange and unexplained. He gives a solid  effort and it shows. While some of the sound is scratchy, I still enjoyed it enough to give it 5 out of 5 stars.
 At 86 minutes you get your monies worth of entertainment and satisfaction from the work done by the production crews. I never saw this DVD before July 2010, but it captures the 1970's world to a tee. So, if you like this sort of query into strange creatures, then find the lowest price possible and get yourself a copy.",1280620800,2,664,4.304
3917635,4,B002EIJ98K,"This documentry covers it all; from various eyewitness sightings, including three campers who recorded vocalizations in the early 70's, Albert Ostman's kidnapping by a bigfoot in 1924, and early accounts of bigfoot in the 1800's. Footprints are examined and discussed, even self proclaimed footprint hoaxer Ray Pickens is interviewed. Dr. Peter Byrne appears briefly when discussing the Yeti, but Dr. Grover Krantz is given the most screentime when discussing why bigfoot does exist and explains why certain casted footprints are genuine. The Patterson film is also examined and discussed.

Although the documentry is mostly about bigfoot it begins by discussing other animals that were once considered monsters before they were discovered, like the Gorilla. When examining the Loch Ness Monster and how people say it can't exist it mentions the Coelacanth that was thought to be extinct but was discovered off the coast of South Africa in 1938. Examination of the Loch Ness Monster is given quite a bit of time and includes Peter Macnab's photo taken in 1955 of Urquhart Castle with two humps in the water, and the photo taken in 1934 by Robert K. Wilson, known as ""The Surgeon's photo"". Also included is the film by Tim Dinsdale taken in 1960 and John Cobb's attempt to break the water speed record in 1952 that ended with him being killed when his boat hit a wave supposedly caused by the creature.

The reason I give this only four stars is because the bigfoot costumes look like something you would see from the Planet of the Apes films, just a little bit scarier in the face. The other reason is the film itself is noticeably dirty, something you will immediately see in the opening shot of Peter Graves addressing the audience.

A must have documentry that is definitely worth buying!",1279929600,5,1791,4.943521594684386
3917636,5,B002EIJ98K,"I was probably about 10 or 12 years old when I first saw this movie (on television, probably during the summer vacation), and although I now approach some of it with lighthearted skepticism and grammatical criticism (""Hey! The 'Surgeon's Photo' was established as a hoax almost a decade and a half ago!""; ""Don't say 'facts', 'proof' and 'prove'; say 'evidence', 'suggest' or 'support'""), back then I accepted it all without question. It probably aired about once a year through the mid 1980s (during the height of the cryptozoological/paranormal documentary years) and I watched it as often as I could (but was pretty much subject to the whims of the station owners and programming executives of the time; this was in the dark ages of home theater, before DVRs, Tivo and even VCRs, remember), until it all but disappeared from the scene. Armchair cryptozoologists like myself were forced to wait almost two decades before it would be made officially available on DVD.

The audio [on the Cheesy Flicks DVD edition] isn't perfect, and the picture is actually pretty poor (there's probably only so much that can be accomplished, even with modern remastering and restorative technology, and especially when you allow for the likelihood that the original video probably hasn't been treated with a whole lot of TLC over the past three decades), but are both are far superior to other copies I've owned on both DVD and VHS (which were in retrospect, of questionable legality and almost certainly bootleg, respectively).",1267401600,15,1512,5.072289156626506
3917637,1,B002EIJ98K,I was looking forward to revisiting this childhood favourite but the copy I received was covered in scratches and my doorstep has yet to see the promised replacement from Amazon.com.

3917638,4,B002EIJ98K,"Oh boy oh boy! Do I remember this one!

And the `70's in general. A time where the paranormal, the Bermuda Triangle, and yes, monsters were very much in vogue.

I will never forget seeing this film at a local mall outside of Richmond, Virginia in 1975.

My dear, dear father, who was/is a devout minister or ""elder"" in the Jehovah's Witness religion originally didn't want to take me to see this film thinking that it was somehow potentially 'demon possessed'. When we got to the mall movie multi-plex in order to (so I thought) actually see it, he flatly said, ""No. I am not seeing that movie!"" and instead we saw Robert Wise's ""The Hindenburg"" with George C. Scott, which I truly enjoyed.

However, I was practically breaking into a cold sweat with the knowledge that just on the other side of the fire wall, in the next mini-theatre, the really creepy wonders of which I lusted over - those of the Yeti, the Loch Ness Monster, and our favorite, native American huge hairy biped, the great Sasquatch, Ohma, or Bigfoot were playing to audiences who must be delightfully scared at the eye-witness accounts, the re-enactments, the tales of the historic sightings, the photographs and those truly awesome plaster casts of the bigfoot prints!

Well, I don't remember exactly how, but my father finally relented on another night and he, my mom and I, at the age 15 and a half, went to see The Mysterious Monsters. I think that a partial reason that my dad gave in was that he liked Peter Graves in the CBS adventure/drama series ""Mission Impossible"".

The film did not disappoint me. I was hooked from the second Peter Graves introduced the film and said, ""This may be the most startling motion picture that you will ever see."" Among other wonders of the unknown - such as psychic Peter Hurkos feeling a sealed brief case containing a bigfoot plaster cast and describing the creature in detail and sketching it out for Peter (Mission Impossible) Graves, we have such giants of Bigfoot-dom as adventurer/searcher Peter Byrne, intrepid bigfoot hunter Robert Morgan with his `Mr. Clean' haircut and chilling tale of his personal encounter with a Sasquatch, and the late great Doctor Grover Krantz and his detailed analysis of the famous Roger Patterson film.

Also, we have the rational and highly convincing Tim Dinsdale who captured what is still regarded, even today, as the most authentic cine footage of `Nessie' yet filmed. And, an infirm and perhaps moribund British explorer, Eric Shipton recounts his discovery of Yeti footprints in the Himalayas. As pictures of the prints he discovered are shown, he states, ""Then I had this...really, eerie feeling, that here, one was in the presence of something quite...unknown."" My hairs still go up on the back of my neck as I recall this scene from the film.

I will never forget the delicious creepiness of the re-enactments! One is the terrifying night encounter by the retired high school football coach who picks up his (really cute) daughter from a baby-sitting job on a lonely road, only to have a near collision with a bigfoot just down the lane. The truly frightening late night encounter of Rita Graham, of upper Washington State, who had a huge, hairy arm reach in through her living room window as she was sipping coffee and watching TV. Or the actual hypnotic regression of Jerilou Whelchell as she shudders and convulses as she re-lives her encounter with a bigfoot creature reaching into her car to injure her arm. This is great entertainment in the finest nostalgic tradition. A true piece of Americana - even if part of it recounts events from the far away cold Himalayas, or the dim waters of Loch Ness in Scotland.

One of the goose bump inducing moments for me is the re-enactment of the three men who are camping and make the recording of the sounds of a bigfoot. Later, when the sounds are analyzed in an actual audio laboratory, Peter Graves asks the sound specialist, ""Do you know what made these sounds?"" and this technical authority responds with a slight grin and a reverent shake of the head, ""No..., I don't."" Yep, I still get those goose bumps!

In a decade which saw some truly momentous events such as the subsequent moon landings of the Apollo program, the Watergate scandal, the end of the Vietnam War, the truly horrifying human monsters of John Wayne Gacy and Ted Bundy, there's something rather pure, innocent and escapist about the Mysterious Monsters and I will always remember this B-grade ""documentary"" with true affection. It is a light reminder that there yet may still be unknown phenomenon in our vastly advanced, documented and construed culture.

It's interesting to note that others have also recalled this film with some affection. In the episode of ""The Simpson's"" where Homer and Groundskeeper Willie accompany Mister Burns and Smithers to Loch Ness to capture the famous Nessie, Homer says, ""But Mr. Burns, you can't capture the Loch Ness Monster! He's eluded both Leonard Nimoy and Peter Graves!"" - these being obvious homages to the ""In Search Of..."" TV series with Leonard Nimoy and ""The Mysterious Monsters"" movie with Peter Graves. Get the DVD, make the pop corn, turn out the lights on a Friday night, snuggle up with your wife and children and ENJOY! There may indeed be some unknown beasties that still go bump in the night.

For another great film of this genre, please see ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"".",1261353600,45,5405,4.8125

3917648,2,B002EIJ98K,"My rating is for the DVD quality, not the film which is excellent. I thought CHEEZY Flicks would do a nicer job on the film transfer, but it's actually worse quality than the version I downloaded from Archive! The picture is blown-up (missing elements from the original 4:3 ratio), and plenty of motion blur, especially when the camera glides across forest trees. Also, when scenes change, there are lines that appear quickly and that is always a sign of low quality video. Whoever made the actual transfer must have been drunk or high on something, no doubt.
I'm very disappointed, but I guess it's the highest quality version available on disc, so I'll keep it.
Occult movies like these deserve a lot more respect and preservation than they currently have, so I hope one day they will be awarded the releases they deserve on DVD or Blu Ray.

It has its downfalls, a couple of areas such as the hypnotized lady & the sound expert, both those segments were drawn out a bit. I enjoyed the segment on Bigfoot and the Patterson film etc. Overall even though its clearly dated, this is a great piece of history if you want to know what some of the BUZZ was in the mid 1970's.",1429747200,2,599,4.217391304347826

3917663,5,B002EIJ98K,"One of my favorite documentaries from the 70's.  Thanks to Cheezy Flicks for releasing this one!  Like Leonard Nimoy from ""In Search Of..."", Peter Graves is an excellent host for this feature-length look at the Loch Ness Monster and Bigfoot (and its brethren in the colder and mountainous regions of the world). The film opens with a brief summary of other ""legendary"" creatures, such as the gorilla and okapi. Eye-witness accounts and reenactments (which often resemble low-budget horror films... and that's fine by me) make up a good part of the film, but there are also commentaries and demonstrations by scientists, polygraph experts and monster hunters, as well as the familiar and reassuring presence of Peter Graves, who invites us to explore these mysteries along with him. Whether you're a skeptic or true believer, this is a fun and fascinating overview of our most mysterious yet at the same time, most familiar, creatures.",1413158400,6,934,5.098039215686274

3917675,5,B002EIJ98K,"""The Mysterious Monsters"" is a classical documentary from 1976, featuring actor Peter Graves from ""Mission Impossible"". Graves investigates observations of Bigfoot, but briefly also deals with the Yeti and the Loch Ness monster. He interviews pro-Bigfoot scientist Grover Krantz, Bigfoot hunter Robert Morgan, Nessie researcher Tim Dinsdale and even notorious hoaxer Ray Pickens, running around in Bigfoot boots! A few sceptics are featured, some of them not even named. The bulk of the show consists of interviews with eye-witnesses, and re-enactments of their experiences. The actor starring Bigfoot looks suitably scary.

Judging by other reviews, ""The Mysterious Monsters"" was quite the hit when it was released. Graves and his team try to solve the mystery as best they can, analyzing voice-recordings, subjecting witnesses to polygraph tests, and so on. But, of course, the mystery still remains 40 years later. What struck me when watching ""The Mysterious Monsters"" is that the Bigfoot scene looks almost identical today as it did when Graves' very own IMF task force trailed the monster. The UFO phenomenon has changed considerably, but it seems Bigfoot is still his old self: huge, hairy, smelly, elusive...

But then, what did we expect? ;-)

The show climaxes, as it should, with Graves showing part of the famous Patterson-Gimlin film, still considered the best single piece of evidence for the existence of Bigfoot. A standoff ensues between a sceptic and Krantz, with no side really emerging as the winner. This, too, sounds eerily familiar...

Somebody should try to solve this issue by sending out an expedition to Skookum or British Columbia. But remember: if any of you get caught or killed, the Ashtar Command will disavow all knowledge of your actions!",1376092800,3,1772,5.295373665480427

You'll end up doing what I'm about to do...return it!!",1329436800,5,649,4.2
3917688,5,B002EIJ98K,"I had not heard of this film but decided to purchase it based on the excellent review of Monster Man. He was right on! Even though I am a Bigfoot fan and have seen many documentaries on the subject, this DVD was a rare treat. A great host with good interviews make this a great monster documentary. What really makes it stand out are the recreations. Even though this is dated, many of the stories I had never heard of. The recreations were very creepy. If you love Bigfoot, mysteries and legends, this is definitely worth having. This is now paired with Legend of Boggy Creek as my all time favorites. Thanks Monster Man for introducing me to a great gem. Again, there are many interviews and recreations of stories not found in many of the Bigfoot documentaries.",1329004800,5,764,4.543478260869565
3917689,5,B002EIJ98K,"This is a classic Documentary; it is well researched and put together in a very cohesive manner.  And at 35 years old, the information provided is still valid and on point.  Now I've seen some complaints about poor video transfer quality... yeah, sure, but I'd still much rather watch this documentary than some of the newer ones that are being pushed on people interested in the Bigfoot subject.  If you're looking for a serious and legitimate documentary on the Bigfoot subject, this is one is a MUST HAVE!",1325721600,,508,4.75
3917690,5,B002EIJ98K,"If you were lucky enough to grow up as a pre-teen in that great decade of the 70's, you'll remember how that decade was full of fads, the newest ""Big Thing"" of the moment that changed from week to week, and Bigfoot! Yes, Bigfoot.  The 70's were the heyday for the sasquatch, yeti and Loch Ness Monster.  There were documentaries aplenty about these strange and elusive creatures, and kids like myself couldn't get enough of them!  We read every book and saw every TV show that would come on about the mysterious creatures.

And then along came this bad boy.

Over the years I've talked with other guys my age and asked them if they ever remember seeing this movie.  It is amazing how many of them did, along with myself.  It also amazing that to this very day, almost everyone of them says this was the scariest movie they ever saw.  And I'd have to agree with them.

For kids who were under 16 or so back then, the concept of living creatures like the bigfoot here in America and also in the Himalayas (the yeti)were totally accepted as fact.  Now, take that one idea and carry it over to watching a film that is a no-holds-barr attempt to show the creature as not only mysterious, but potentially mean and harmful to whomever may run across its path.  I saw this in the theater when it was released in '75.  All of little boys came out of that theater (wherever you may have lived and seen it), scarred for life!

I lived in metro Atlanta, GA.  The closest thing I had for a forest (where Bigfoot could possibly be hiding and waiting for me)was a line of 4 or 5 trees separating our house from a busy main road.  It didn't matter.  That night after witnessing this film firsthand, I ran into my parents bedroom crying and telling them that I just knew a sasquatch was coming to pick me up out of my bed and then take me out to his lair (which I guess must have resided somewhere between the 4 trees in our backyard) and then do God-only-knew to me!

Many other fine, upstanding young men that I met over the years told me the same story about their experience after watching Peter Graves tell us kids in the most solemn of tones, ""Bigfoot is REAL!"".

If you love the subject, and you love those classic B-picture psuedo documentaries from the 70's, do yourself a favor and get this one.  The Mysterious Monsters is the grandaddy of them all!  You won't be disappointed!",1319155200,21,2371,4.382151029748284

3917692,4,B002EIJ98K,"If you were a kid in the early/mid 70's, then you certainly remember the show ""In Search Of"" with Leonard Nimoy.  Well, imagine a full length version of that show, but substitute Peter Graves for the Host and you get the idea of this film.  If you are a true fan of crypto-investigation, this is a must have to add to any collection.  Obviously, the DVD transfer has not been remastered, so it retains the ""damaged"" or ""lined"" look to it (think ""Planet Terror"" by Robert Rodriguez), but that only adds to the quaint charm.  If you love 70's ""Cheese"" and/or anything reminiscent of the wonder and excitement you felt as a child when you first heard about the legendary ""Bigfoot"" or ""Loch Ness Monster"", then you won't be disappointed.",1300492800,2,733,4.615384615384615

8367767,4,B002EIJ98K,"I remember watching this as a kid back in the late 70's and early 80's. As a child I wanted to believe that bigfoot existed and so I bought into all the ""supposed"" evidence that this documentary brought out. In 1985 I taped this show off of late night tv. The picture is pretty bad, not due to the age of the tape but the condition of the film when it was broadcast. The colors are very muted, everything seems to have a green tint to it and most colors are not identifiable. About once a year I still watch this show. It brings back memories.

However, when I now watch this film I can't help but to chuckle at the so called ""evidence"" that is displayed. Most of it is open to interpretation and not concrete proof and some of it has been, evidently, proven a hoax since this film was released. I believe most of the so called witnesses either were out and out lying to the interviewers so that they could get their 15 minutes of fame or they so wanted to believe in bigfoot that they convinced themselves that what they saw was a bigfoot. In many ways it's like those who believe they have come in contact with aliens or seen a space ship. Have you ever noticed that most of us never see an alien or space ship but those who have seen one of them once have usually seen one of them more than once?

What I enjoy most about this film is Peter Graves interviews and narration. If you are able to view this film watch and listen to Peter Graves as he creates a fact out of a thin air. For example, Mr. Graves will ask a person who has witnessed a bigfoot sighting about their experience and then he will make a statement of fact something like this: ""...now that we've established that bigfoot does exist..."" and then he'll move on to his next point. In other words he takes an unverifiable event and treats it as fact. Now, as an adult, I can't help but to chuckle at how this film attempts to sway the viewers opinion on the existence of bigfoot.

This so called documentary does try to appear unbiased by interviewing professors and experts in various fields some of which believe in bigfoot and some that do not. Again, this is not what it appears. Watch how the comparisons are made. Peter Graves usually asks someone who believes in bigfoot to explain why he believes and then he asks another person why he doesn't. Once the person who does not believe gives his reasons Mr. Graves goes back to the first person and gives him a chance to refute what the person who does not believe in bigfoot has said but Mr. Graves never gives the person who does not believe in bigfoot a chance to respond to the first persons refute. Thus the person who believes in bigfoot gets the first and last word.

For some reason I still enjoy this film. I guess I don't really believe in Bigfoot or the Lock Ness monster anymore. With today's technology I think we would have more concrete proof that these two entities exist. That being said, this documentary is fun to watch. It's kind of like Santa Claus for an adult. You no longer believe but it's still fun to read or watch the stories and remember when you did believe!",1508803200,,3110,4.320205479452055
