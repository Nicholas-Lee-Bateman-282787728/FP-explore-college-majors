8534036,5,B000WN9FOW,"Tamra-henna is an excellent teacher.  In this DVD she will show you how to interpret Arabic rhythms, and how to reflect these rhythms in your movements.  This is a Great DVD for a beginner or intermediate dancer as she explains that Arabic music is based on structure, timing and how to interpret the music with your body and hip movements.  The diagrams of the beats or the different rhythms, Beledy,  Maqsoum, Wahda, Malfoof and Ayub are helpful to understand what she is saying, then she shows you the movements to that music, and eventually progresses to more complex combinations.

Traveling steps are then demonstrated and how one moves their hips and body at the
same time.  Tamra-hennas teaching style is easy to understand, and it is helpful to watch her demonstrate the steps or combinations on both sides of the body.  The drummer, Amir Sofi, accompanies her throughout the video with his precise and exciting drumming, first as she explains the 4 beat rhythms, then the 2 beat rhythms. I really enjoyed watching her performance at the end.

I highly recommend this DVD.  It is easily in the top 5 instructional belly dance DVDs on the market.  And I would go so far as to say it should be mandatory if you want to be a good dancer.",1418688000,2,1243,4.660550458715596

The information is very clear and concise, I especially liked the visual aid of a chart while Amir Sofi demonstrated the rhythm,  making it easy to understand.  Dancing the combinations further helped to connect the body movement with the music.  This is one of those rare DVDs that hits on multiple areas and goes beyond a series of combinations.",1339286400,,421,4.887323943661972
