7812440,5,6301449126,This movie is just what I wanted. I listen on sat radio all the time and now have this great movie,1328745600,3,98,3.7142857142857144
7812441,4,6301449126,".....I found this film to be a bit tedious. This is probably because we have become so much more sophisticated since the 1940's. Fibber and Molly, Bergen and Charlie are great on radio especially since both shows were so well written with the verbal interplay intense yet very entertaining. I guess I am doomed to listening to them on XM. Perhaps they have ""radio faces"" that make them less attractive in person than hearing their voices.
At any rate, these films are rare but enlightening. Not hugely entertaining.",1289001600,,515,4.863636363636363
7812442,4,6301449126,"Too bad some old films are not available in DVD. I am a fan of 30s and 40s radio programs, and especially Fibber McGee and Molly. I know they were in a couple of films, but this is the only one I have found in any video format. This is classic Fibber and Molly: Fibber the inventor; the famous closet; the long-suffering and genial Molly; Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve as the antagonistic next-door neighbor/friend. Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy are the catalyst in the plot, but the film would be nothing if it did not center on the McGees. This was my first taste of seeing Wistful Vista, and it was well worth it to see these characters portrayed in film.",1195689600,11,661,4.516666666666667
7812443,3,6301449126,"Radio stars of yore, Edgar Bergen and Fibber McGee and Molly (Jim and Marian Jordan) are teamed in this cute and corny little 1941 flick which will be of interest to those who relish nostalgia.  Bergen has his airplane factory built in Wistful Vista (Fibber McGee and Molly's fictional radio hometown). Halton is Bergen's rival and hammy Neil Hamilton (remember Chief Inspector Gordon on BATMAN?) plays Bergen's millionaire friend who buys Bergen's property to build an airport.  Harold Peary - aka - THE GREAT GILDERSLEEVE, is hammy but amusing as McGee's pal who unwittingly aids Halton's schemes to ruin Bergen.  As Julie Patterson, 30 year-old Lucille Ball is vivacious and quite pretty as Bergen's secretary who almost marries Bergen's business manager, but predictably  ends up the arms of Candace Bergen's Pop. Look for Sterling Holloway and frequent I LOVE LUCY guest player Charles Lane in bits.",1030579200,17,904,5.171232876712328
