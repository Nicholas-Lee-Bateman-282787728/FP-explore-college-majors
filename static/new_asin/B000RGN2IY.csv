2866768,2,B000RGN2IY,"I'm convinced that the story for ""Vacancy"" could not have been told in a new way, which makes me wonder why it had to be told at all. This is one of the most implausible, predictable, and unoriginal thrillers I've ever seen, borrowing elements from countless other thrillers of the same basic plotline. I'm referring to the story of an isolated couple in an unfamiliar location, stalked by one or many psychopaths; has this not been told before? I can appreciate the tension that runs through the film; indeed, many startling and creepy moments occur, most of which are satisfyingly edge-of-your-seat. If only the filmmakers had attempted something original, something that leaves the audience feeling exhilarated instead of indifferent.

The plot focuses on David (Luke Wilson) and Amy Fox (Kate Beckinsale), a married couple on their way home to finalize their divorce. The film opens with them driving in the middle of the night on an isolated road, because--obviously--David just had to get off of the interstate and attempt a shortcut. After swerving around a raccoon sitting in the middle of the road, David hears a strange noise coming from the car engine. After he and Amy bicker like immature teenagers, they stop at a rundown gas station for help. From what I've described thus far, it's no small wonder that absolutely anyone can figure out what would happen next; the lone mechanic (Ethan Embry) inspects the car and sends them on their way, only for the car to completely break down. Stuck in the middle of nowhere, they realize that the only option is to walk back to the gas station and call for help.

That's when they discover the Pinewood Motel and its manager, Mason (Frank Whaley). Here's a man Norman Bates (a much more convincing character) would have been glad to know; from the moment we first lay eyes on him, our internal weirdo-meters go off the charts. He's eerily phony, with a friendly casualness and an offbeat personality that only accentuates how abnormal he is (especially since no one else seems to be staying at this place). It makes one wonder why anyone would choose to stay in a motel run by this man. Yet David and Amy make that very decision, realizing that they can't reach help so late at night. Does the word ""convenient"" come to mind, here?

They finally enter their room, which of course is old, unkempt, and dirty (I found it hard to believe that the entire room was inhabited by only one cockroach). That's when the psychological torment begins, firstly when someone repeatedly bangs on the door, secondly when David pops a videocassette into the VCR and watches a series of gruesome murders. Both he and Amy quickly realize that their very room also served as the video's crime scene, meaning that the murders are real. They're watching a snuff video. Making matters worse is a series of hidden cameras, placed all throughout the room. Clearly, whoever runs this motel is watching them, waiting for the right moment to strike.

That's about as much of the plot as you need to know. From there on out, it's all about trying to escape. It's also about cramming as many horror movie cliches into the story as possible, from the mask-wearing killers to the dark, cramped spaces, to the moments of panic and despair. If it weren't for the inclusion of Wilson and Beckinsale, I would have classified this as a teen slasher film, most of which have relied on formulaic stories for a years. It probably would have been better for ""Vacancy"" to be a teen slasher film; I still wouldn't have recommended it, but at least I would have known I was in for a run-of-the-mill plot. But when the lead victims of a thriller are an older married couple, I expect something with a little more depth, something that had even the tiniest shred of originality. It doesn't help that serious subject matter is hinted at, namely the death of David and Amy's son; that kind of material doesn't work in a slasher film because we're not supposed to invest in the characters emotionally.

The worst part of the film involved the discovery of a network of underground tunnels. Not only is it difficult to believe that anyone had the time or patience to create this network, it's also impossible to understand why David and Amy would actually crawl through it, knowing the killers are using it frequently. It's a lot easier to run away from a lunatic out in the open than it is through a three-foot-wide tunnel. And let's not forget the obligatory swarm of subterranean rats; they serve as a scare tactic, for both Amy and the audience, but otherwise have no relevance to the plot. This idea was reminiscent of the crypt scene in ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,"" a film that appropriately refused take itself too seriously.

""Vacancy"" could have been halfway decent had it done the same thing. This film follows a formula that's too overused to allow anyone to take it seriously; this is bad because it was constructed as a straightforward thriller, not as a parody. Ultimately, I can think of no good reason to recommend this film. It fails as an original idea. It fails as a plausible story. It fails to be mysterious. It fails, period.",1177372800,,5160,4.740534521158129
2866769,4,B000RGN2IY,"I've always thought that horror flicks are better when you can watch it and say ""That could happen to me"". Cannibal chainsaw maniacs chasing me around my neighborhood? Possible but not likely. Flesh eating zombies breaking into my house? not possible, not but the events in this film are. When I was a kid my father and I would go on fishing trips though out Colorado and we stayed in many a seedy hotel. Needless to say, the plot hit close to home. Vacancy follows the story of a couple taking a road trip. The boyfriend (played by Luke Wilson) decides to save sometime and take a back road. He soon finds that he's lost and having car trouble. The girlfriend(Kate beckinsale) starts to nag him and we find that the two are having trouble due to the death of their child and have decided to call it quits after the road trip. The two abandon their car and check into a seedy hotel with a creepy hotel manager who seems way too eager to get them checked into a room. When they check in the couple are soon pestered by someone banging on their walls. When they complain the banging stops but they soon find the truely frightening aspects of their room, VHS tapes of former occupants being tourched to death and carmers mounted in the room. The couple find themselves traped in the room and hunted by knife weilding freaks. They have to put their relationship problems aside in order to survive. ""Vacancy"" is a soild thiller. Wilson and Beckinsale work well together and make what would otherwise be corny materal enjoyable to watch. Wilson keeps his cool through out the film and plays a very believable lead man in the film. My only gripe about the film is that you can see whats coming next from a mile away but the beauty is the film still makes you want to watch it. Vacancy is a great thriller. It goesn't re lie on excessive gore and it will change the way you look at that little hotel out in the middle of nowhere. check it out.",1177372800,2,1935,4.407821229050279
2866770,3,B000RGN2IY,"3.5 stars. David (Luke Wilson) and Amy (Kate Beckinsale), who recently lost their son, find themselves forced to spend the night in a seedy motel after their car breaks down in the middle of nowhere. They soon realize that there are hidden cameras in the room and judging by the tape in the VCR, which shows couples being assaulted and killed in the very same room they're in, they're in for a long, brutal night.

This is the kind of movie you watch thinking, ""this could actually happen in real life"" and it just makes it even more frightening. A very interesting premise indeed for a horror film, well-shot, and well played by the lead actors, but sadly culminates to an anticlimactic ending. Director Nimrd Antal shows promise, helming a claustrophobic horror film in many imaginative ways. The first half hour is intriguing and very unnerving. To imagine one in a situation like that of the two protagonists is simply terrifying. Unfortunately, the script fell into a lot of clichs and the characters started doing all those things nobody would do in real life. First off, when you realize you're in a situation like this, GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE!! David and Amy kept beating around the bush and wanting to find out who was hammering down their door; in real life, I doubt anybody would've stayed in that room much longer after the first episode of relentless pounding. They would still have had time to hit the ground running.

All that aside, the film did succeed in making you care for its central characters and make you hate the antagonists. It even managed to make me jump once or twice and took me by surprise with one of its twists. Most of the film revolves around our couple escaping through underground tunnels and hiding out in dark corners. The film moved at a quick pace and surprisingly does a great job of keeping the story engaging within its limited options (very few characters, setting of a motel, a few hours of night to resolve everything). There are a few plot holes (which I can't discuss here without ruining certain parts) and the ending to me felt botched; as if they didn't know how to tie everything together.

I can't recommend this film to everyone, but if you're a horror fan or have a fear of motels, then, by all means, you should definitely check in for the night; Vacancy has a few scares in store for you!",1177286400,10,2349,4.601431980906921
2866771,3,B000RGN2IY,"A whopping 47 years after Norman Bates and the Bates Motel made the ""evil motel"" genre of horror films famous, comes 'Vacancy', a psychological thriller as opposed to a slice-n-dice horror flick. Bare in mind that 'Vacancy' really is not a horror movie. In fact, without the presence of Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale, it might have made its way to your local art house theater and not your local mall. In fact, Beckinsale might be the only element keeping this movie from a more limited release, seeing as Wilson has made an uncountable amount of art house films. 'Vacancy' devotes at least 30 minutes of its 80 minute running time to Beckinsale and Wilson driving down a secluded road talking about a recent family tragedy and their dying marriage. That's another thing. At times, most of the time, actually, save for a small action scene at the end, 'Vacancy' plays like a stage play. After those 30 set-up minutes, the movie becomes a psychological thriller, and a suprisingly plausible one at that.

'Vacancy' keeps it's simple plot going as long as it can. It's about a couple that takes a shortcut (more on this later), has car trouble, wind up at a secluded motel, find snuff films, and discover that they are next on the long roster of victims in the manager's sick collection of videos. The movie runs an amazingly short 80 minutes, and if you subtract the long credit sequence at the beginning (a throwback to 'Psycho'), it's probably about 77 minutes. The movie contains very little violence, and when the violence does come around, late in the third act, it seems almost tacked on, like director Nimrod Antal decided that a little horror movie revenge would make the movie better. While it adds nothing to the overall movie, it probably interested the people in the crowd who came expecting a slasher movie and were bored by what they got. The footage from the snuff films is not as graphic as one might expect. The violence seen on the videos is never bloody, and although it is mildly disturbing the first time you see it, it looks way too much like a cheesy horror movie. I know the point was to make it look homemade, but the videos have the look of somewhere between homemade and professional. That means they look cheap. The movie was rated R for brutal violence and terror, brief nudity, and language. There are some pretty suspenseful scenes in the movie, but it hardly warranted the rating for brutal violence. This could have been an easy PG-13 without the quick shot of nudity and the bloody shooting at the end. The R is mainly for the amount of language, which is not gratuitous in any way. The point of those sentences was to underline the fact that this is not a normal thriller. Bodies are not found hanging in closets, and, honestly, outside the snuff films, only one person is killed by the murderers.

But don't let the level of violence fool you. 'Vacancy' still falls into some of the old horror cliches. I'm so damn sick of people taking short cuts. Screenwriters: come up with a new device to get your characters in hot water. Horror movie characters: stop taking so many f*cking shortcuts! Just once, I'd like to see a horror movie where they kill the guy in the first five minutes, then roll credits, it's over. In real life, the killer either kills the person immediately, or the person kills the killer immediately, or the police come immediately. I know it's just a movie, but is it too much too ask for some realism? If I were in half of the situations I see in horror movies, and thrillers like this one, I would get myself into a sealed corner where I could see the guy(s) coming, and then stick them with something sharp when they find me. That easy. These days, so many people are taking so many shortcuts, you'd think they'd learn a lesson. There are several other cliches that the movie falls victim to: a man shows up at the hotel who seems like he is going to help David (Wilson) and Amy (Beckinsale), but he turns out to be buying some of the videos. The killers wear masks. That in and of itself isn't that bad, but they look similar to the Michael Myers mask. Creepy banging noises are heard from the ""empty"" room next door. Then, possibly the biggest cliche of all: the woman takes charge in the last ten minutes. It's always great to see women taking charge. But it got old in the '80's. How about a guy and a girl taking on the killers at the end. Girl power is over in terms of horror movies. (Although, I will admit, at the end of 'Grindhouse' when the three girls show Kurt Russell who's boss, me and the people I was with joined the rest of the audience in clapping, because let's face it, that was an awesome sequence.)

'Vacancy' has two other rather large problems. First off, there is no mystery to who is orchestrating the murders. Before we even meet the manager, we hear him watching a snuff film in his office. An overly cheerful gas station attendant can only mean one thing, and it's not that he got Grease Monkey of the Month. The last problem, and arguably the smallest, is that the chasing/hiding/running scenes get old after a while. For a movie that spent the whole first hour playing with our heads, it sure seems intent on nearly killing that vibe by having endless scenes of hiding and running. They aren't even chase scenes most of the time. I'm not complaining at the lack of action. I'm just saying how the last 20 minutes could have been better spent. 'Vacancy' is a good movie, and it certainly deserves a look. It might not be what the previews made it look like, but it's certainly entertaining. For the first hour.

80 minutes.

Rated R.

Contains snuff film related images, some violence, brief nudity, and language.",1177113600,2,5704,4.56
2866772,3,B000RGN2IY,"This one could have been great. Alas, it seemed like the writer of the film, Mark L. Smith, placed years of clever thought into the first 90% of the movie, only to rush the last pieces to screen in an attempt to make a deadline. You WILL be disappointed with the end of this film. Make no mistake.

The plot deals with David Fox (Luke Wilson) and his wife Amy (Kate Beckinsale) en route to their home in California after a trip. We quickly learn that their marriage is on the rocks due to some form of tragedy that has recently taken place, and the two are probably headed for a divorce. When David decides to take a ""short cut"" on a remote road off the interstate, things quickly plummet from bad to worse. As things usually turn out in the world of creepy cinema, the Fox family develops car trouble and are forced to take up residence in a seedy motel. As they walk into the lounge of the motel office, a women's screams can be heard from a back room, apparently from a smut video the night attendee has been watching. It is the Fox's first indication that this motel is not exactly going to be rated in anyone's ""Most homey motels of America"".

Any form of security the Fox's might have had in their questionable surroundings quickly dissolves when David, unable to get the TV working, pops in a dusty VHS and watches in horror as a group of college women are tortured and brutalized in the very room where David and Amy are sleeping, room 3. After popping in two more videos, David and Amy learn that all the videos are indeed the recordings of violent murders that have occurred in room 3. BE WARNED, THE FILMS ARE HARD TO STOMACH.

It's while watching these videos that the lights go out, and unseen assailants begin hammering on the room's door and a connecting door that leads to another room. David and Amy quickly begin a process of trying to anticipate the moves of the killers and outthink them in an effort to keep themselves from being victimized on film.

As a viewer, I couldn't help but feel for the Fox family and their horrific plight, as the thought of things like this actually happenning in dark corners of America became more real to me than the film I was watching. As I left the theatre with friends, I said, ""You know this kind of thing really happens. You know it does.""

A solid film that will entertain and compel for the first 90% of the movie, but ultimately make the viewer wish for more when the credits begin to roll. Even still, the resounding thought of nightmarish places and people like the ones featured in this film being all-too real in the underbelly of America, where people get off at watching REAL violence on screen and paying big money to do so, is what will ultimately stay with you after you've gone home and crawled into bed.",1177113600,,2776,4.424657534246576

2866817,3,B000RGN2IY,"A couple that are not feeling a lot of love for one another are on the road one night. The wife is unapologetically sleeping, they've even spoken of ending the marriage and divorcing one another so they both know this is probably one of their last nights together. The night keeps getting stranger and stranger for the two beginning with some map trouble and then some car trouble. Eventually they land up at a motel with a strange receptionist. They take their room left with no choice and they discover the room is a double room with a connecting passage. The film REALLY begins when they start hearing banging coming from the other room with no way to open it. Then they hear someone banging on their door. Mind you, the wife has taken some sleep tablets but she can't sleep now...

I thought Vacancy was very unsettling. Maybe not disturbing but it definitely gave my wife and I some cold chills with no reluctance whatsoever. The plot is a bit like a dark hole where events that are unexplained may happen and the protagonists will be left at the mercy of the wrong doers. Is this film new? Even if it is, trust me this s not the film you will be looking forward to ever re-watching. I suggest you watch this if you are curious like me and have to watch every single decent creeper.

2866826,4,B000RGN2IY,"I would call the 2007 film Vacancy a Thriller more than Horror.  The movie begins with a young married couple named David and Amy driving down a road in the middle of nowhere.  If your as big a horror fan as I am you know that always means trouble.  We quickly learn that this couple is planning to be divorced and are bickering constantly.  Much of the tension stems from the accidental death of there toddler son.  Amy is on antidepressants and blames herself for the boys death.  When David swerves to avoid hitting a raccoon there is some damage to their car.  They stop at a gas station/motel for help.  When the attendant tells them they can make it to their destination they leave, only to have the car breakdown again.  Upon returning to the gas station they are told by the creepy desk clerk that the attendant has left for the night.  Amy and David deside to stay the night in the motel.  Then the trouble starts.  First there is someone banging on their door and a phone ringing with no one there.  Then David pops in a VHS tape that is on top of the VCR.  What he realizes is that the gory murders shown on the TV were filmed in the room they are staying in.  David then finds the camaras hidden in the wall and realizes that they are being watched, and are about to be the stars of the next snuff film. Then begins a cat and mouse game between the couple and the men who are trying to kill them.  They are lead by the desk clerk.  Every time they try to leave they are chased back into the room.  Now David and Amy must find a way to escape through the underground tunnel under the motel.  As they struggle to survive together the couple grows close again.  I like that this movie does not have nudity and sex.  The acting is great and the movie never feels slow.",1418860800,3,1776,4.226190476190476

Its no spoiler to reveal that this is a movie about a couple who check into a motel and then discover they're inside a death trap. But because the logistics of that trap have been so precisely thought out that it's a joy to watch as the the couple, played by Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale, try to reason their way out of that trap while at the same time playing out all the subtle shifts of status that take place between two otherwise self-reliant adults undergoing the bitter end stage of a marriage.",1415750400,7,667,4.512396694214876

And the car breaks down, low and behold.

We walk to a motel and checkin to a room,
The manager wreaks of impending doom,
Room number four would become their tomb.

While in the room with nothing to do,
They see some videos to look through.

I put one in the VCR and hot play,
and understood almost right away,
It was another couple in the room one day,
And watched them die to my dismay.

Was that real or was it fake?
Did we just make a big mistake?

Loud noises and banging from the room next door,
We can't stay in this room anymore.
We find a tunnel hidden in the bathroom floor
It leads to a room with monitors galore.

I hide my wife where she cannot be seen,
I run out to see if we can escape this scene.

The men find me and chase me down,
They stab me and I fall to the ground.

I am not dead, I am clinging to life,
I hope they don't find my wife.

Three shots ring out and I fear she's dead,
I picture her bleeding from her head,
And see the blood dripping from my stomach instead.

The seconds seem like hours as I wait to die,
A single tear falls from my eye.
I see my wife alive and want to cry
She clutches me and says, ""Don't say goodbye"".",1409011200,,1197,3.8688524590163933

It's 1:20am. David Fox (Luke Wilson) is driving down a lonely, quiet road at night. Suddenly, he swerves his car to miss a raccoon in the road. His wife, Amy (Kate Beckinsale), wakes up and doesn't approve of his car maneuver just to miss an animal. Everyone is alive, including the raccoon.
  David took some trucker pills hoping it would help him stay awake, but he is getting tired at the wheel. Amy cuts herself with a knife while slicing an apple. David reminds her how stupid it is and why doesn't she go back to sleep. She complained that he is not on the Interstate and he decided to take a short cut. The engine is making noise, so they decided to stop at a 1950's-looking gas station. The mechanic (Ethan Embry) says it's the fan belt and tells David he is in the wrong direction for Downey. When David drives on to find the Interstate, the car stalls. They walk back two miles to Small's Gas Station where the Pinewood Motel is next door.
  What will happen next?

When I watch this type of movie, I'm looking at new input that they put to the movie, to me that's the value of this genre, something shockingly new and creepy. Unfortunately there might be some violence here and there, but it isn't much anything else.

They got in there, they found out something wrong with the motel, they try to get out, they got traced, followed by a bunch of actions, killing, etc.

They can't break a chair and use the legs as stakes or clubs, they can't use the giant metal flashlight as a make shift weapon, they can put up a fallen metal shower curtain rod but don't think to use that as a weapon either, then later the husband rips off a metal hand rail in the bathroom to break a window out, yet tosses it aside rather than use THAT as a decent weapon after being terrorized throughout the night.

2866859,4,B000RGN2IY,"VACANCY

When this film was first released in trailer format I was kinda excited because it looked extremely interesting. I was also interested in seeing how the stars they went with would perform in this film. Still even if they were not all that great I had a feeling the story alone would be cool. I was very right as it turns out because I love these types of flicks, they feel so real since stuff like this actually happens. Now that sucks and I hate that so don't get me wrong here, but these things can and do happen.

A couple is on the road and like these things tend to do their car breaks down. This leads them to have to stay at a motel. This place is run by a man named Mason and while a little creepy all seems alright for the two. That is until they try to watch a video in the room VCR. It starts out and it seems to be a snuff film, even worse this film was made in the exact room they are in. As the tension rises the couple realizes that they are the next to star in one of these productions.

I absolutely love the idea of this film, it just seems like it could really happen [and it may have]. These types of films have always brought me in and for the most part have delivered. With this film it falls into middle I guess, I know people who love it and others who hate it. I fall in between because I like it. As far as the filmmaking I really enjoyed this flick and even from the killers themselves. The thing that got me a little was two lead cast members, Kate Beckinsale and Luke Wilson. Don't get me wrong they both did fine but a film like this really felt like it need some unknown or indie actors. The miscasting of the lead roles held this back a little for me.

Don't get it twisted I did not hate this flick but I did not love it either. To me it also felt a little like an old school horror flick which helped it. Frank Whaley struck me as the scene stealer here as he did a great job as the lead villain. Writer Mark Smith crafted a good story here and director Nimrod Antal let it play out well.

Like I said before I liked this film while I know others did not, but honestly it is not bad. The thing that I am sure most will agree on was the miscasting. Lesser known actors would have been great here I am sure. This is one of those flicks that with a less preconceived image of an actor you go in with the better the film will feel. At least that is what I think, who knows, could be wrong.",1336780800,,2428,3.9876543209876543

There is not a lot of weird or gross blood scenes to it but does bring an element of suspense and thrill that horror movies have.  Reminded me somewhat of 'Disturbia' in the way it plays out not that it is a copy of that film.  If you enjoy suspenseful thrillers than give it a watch and you should enjoy it.

2866861,3,B000RGN2IY,"With mixed reviews I was unsure what to expect from `Vacancy', but I watched it with an open mind and found it to be a decent enough film.

The basic premise is quite good I.e. couple's car breaks down, they stay at a remote motel where the proprietar makes snuff movies with the guests as the victims.  The idea is ok, but the films falls down in the execution (if you'll pardon the pun).  Kate Beckinsale and Luke Wilson are both pretty wooden in this film and whilst this starts off menacing enough, it soon loses it's tension and you just watch the film runs it's course without any great scares or unease.

Like others have mentioned the direction is heavily inspired by Hitchcock, but only for the first twenty minutes and thereafter it becomes your standard horror fare.  This has clich's a-plenty and you can guess the story from the opening credits, but it is still decent enough to keep you watching for the 80 minutes duration.  The ending is a little lack lustre, but as long as you watch this not expecting great things then you should enjoy it enough and not be overly disappointed by the end.

2866862,4,B000RGN2IY,"""Vacancy"" reminds me of ""The Strangers"", except it's less disturbing and it's not based on a true story, but it still can be an intense and creepy film. It starts pretty slow, with opening credits that last for a couple minutes (but in a cool style), and a long opening car scene, with additional fighting, but once the banging on the door starts, the terror is basically non-stop. I have to say, the scene with the snuff films is the most disturbing scene in the movie. There are a lot of different intense scenes in this movie that make it worthwhile, like the scene where they're crawling in that tunnel and the ending that isn't 100% happy, but it's good enough.

This will satisfy horror-hounds as it richly includes both humor (their marraige is falling apart and they sideswipe each other with barbs at every turn), and some characterization (that's SOME - it IS a horror flick after all--nice job on the creepy hotel manager)--but not so much that it's too campy.  Don't worry, there's enough gore to keep it entertaining, but not so much you refund your junior mints in your popcorn.  Great flick, good kick for the $$.",1295308800,4,760,4.90625
2866864,3,B000RGN2IY,"What works most about `Vacancy' is the atmosphere.  Outside of that though, there is a lot about the movie that just doesn't hit the right buttons.  The performances are choppy and the script is a tad underdeveloped.  The film revolves around a couple who is suffering the eventualities of impending divorce.  They are driving home from a visit with family when their car breaks down and they have to stay at a crummy motel.  Soon they realize that the room they are staying in is the set of multiple snuff films made by the motel manager.  Then the lights get cut and the terror begins.  It seems to be common practice to make the lead characters stupid, because how else would they get themselves caught up in these kinds of situations, but even I know that you never stay at an abandoned motel way out in the middle of nowhere; you sleep in your car.  Anyways, regardless of the preposterousness of the situation and Luke Wilson's continually dismal acting chops, `Vacancy' does provide some effective scare tactics and really made me jump a few times.  It doesn't stay under your skin as long as it could have, but it does creep you out in moments.  The score is tailored just right and the direction is paced perfectly to create the needed tension.  For barely over an hour, the film is a nice diversion and shouldn't prove to be a waste of time, but I can't help but wish that it had been better.  There were just too many moments when I said ""you should have noticed that before"", but I tell you this, next time I stay at a motel (which will be never) I know exactly what I'm `looking' for first.

2866867,4,B000RGN2IY,"Despite being based on a central premise that is pretty extreme, Vacancy (2007) is a tight, and effective high tension thriller, directed by Nimrod Antal (Predators, Armored).  Mark L. Smith's screenplay has some twists and turns, but still manages to hold to together fairly well, and maintain a high level of suspense, as a innocent couple battles for their lives.  Spoilers follow, so proceed at your own risk.

David Fox (Luke Wilson) and wife Amy (Kate Beckinsale) are travelling at night, when they have car trouble and have to abandon their car at the side of the road.  Walking to a motel, they get a room for the night from the manager (Frank Whaley), who seems a little weird.  Prank phone calls, and some crazy pounding on the connecting door to an adjacent unit, unnerves the couple.  Looking to unwind, David plays some video tapes that are lying around.  He makes the chilling discovery that there are cameras hidden in the room, and that people in the video appear to have been filmed getting attacked and murdered in the very same room.  It becomes clear to the Fox's that it is only a matter of time, before masked men will appear to kill them.

One of the reasons Vacancy works so well, is because the focus almost never wavers from David and Amy.  They are onscreen together for almost the entire film, and you feel that you are right there with them, sharing the experience and almost feeling what they feel.  Although under tremendous stress, they manage to hold things together, without getting too hysterical.

Aside from being sickos who enjoy slaughtering people, and making ""snuff films"", we don't learn much about the killers.  Frank Whaley is excellent as the low-key leader, who watches the happenings on the monitors in his office, while his two partners terrorize the couple.  It seems ridiculous that the killers don't break into the room and overpower the couple, but their failure to do so, provides the Fox's an opportunity to escape.  The underground tunnel system they discover is right out of Hogan's Heroes, but it becomes a suspenseful setting that also provides for a brief change of scenery, as hope for rescue arrives.  The film doesn't have many characters, but the few that appear are used effectively.  Eventually the attack finally comes, and David is taken out of the picture, leaving Kate to face the killers alone.  The finish is quite explosive and violent, and fortunately for Kate, the manager doesn't practice proper gun safety.

Vacancy takes a little while to get going, but it is time well spent, as the audience gets to know David and Kate, a couple who have lost their son, and are about to get divorced.  They are not helpless morons, and when the crisis arrives, you are fully behind them.  The happenings at the Pinewood Motel may not prove to be as notable as those at the Bates Motel, but Vacancy is a very well done spine tingling tale of suspense, with rock solid performances by Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale.

Unfortunately the DVD does not have a director's commentary from Nimrod Antal, who has since gone on to direct bigger films, notably&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Predators/dp/B002ZG98LO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Predators</a>&nbsp;(2010).

Antal excels in capturing honorable characters trapped in Limbo (with a capital L) who will soon experience something else (Hell) before finding, if they are fortunate, some semblance of redemption (secular r). If only the set-up for this horror trip, as edited, weren't so hoary, the villains so hapless, and twists so familiar: the movie feels inexplicably dumbed down. But once it gets going, Vacancy never stops. If you love movies, if you love homage, and if you love cinematic intelligence, you will delight in Antal's sheer film-making skill, even if the plot is nonsense. Watch how Antal's close-ups leave just enough wiggle room to the right of the frame to give you the creeps. The darkness around the edges is much a malevolent character as the snuff bandits - another noose that could any second rub out light (and lives). Wilson evokes Hitchcock most memorable heroes. This is a man fired up by his own fatigue - and one last push to redeem himself as a husband/protector. Antal's existential heroes excel in running brilliantly on empty. (Wilson's star turn makes up Beckinsale and Whaley's black holes.) Antal and Wilson keep it going, until very nearly the end. The movie comes with an alternate opening sequence. What it demands is an alternate ending - or a director's cut. Did Vacancy, Antal's first American feature, suffer the same unfortunate fate as David Fincher's Alien3 - another terrific movie re-cut on release to emphasize the cheap twists at the expense of character, mood and existential grandeur? Thankfully, we have Fincher's cut of Alien3 on DVD to admire. In a redeeming universe, we would get a Director's Cut for Vacancy, too.",1277942400,,1747,4.986301369863014

2866873,3,B000RGN2IY,"Vacancy (Nimrod Antal, 2007)

I will admit that Vacancy was something of a pleasant surprise, given that it stars a Wilson brother and a notoriously inconsistent actress and was directed by Nimrod Antal, who is yet another very talented director overseas (viz. Kontroll) who has been neutered by Hollywood (viz. Armored). And while I don't mean to overpraise what is, in the main, a second-rate knockoff of superior films (Hostel is its most obvious progenitor, but there are nods to everything from Psycho to Joy Ride to be found here), I will say that if you find yourself with two hours to kill and are in the mood for a suspense film that's actually sort of suspenseful, you can do a lot worse than Vacancy. Of course, you can also do a lot better, but yeah, you can do a lot worse.

Amy (Kate Beckinsale) and David (Luke Wilson) Fox are a couple on the verge of divorce when they encounter car trouble in the middle of nowhere. After an unhelpful local mechanic (Ethan Embry) tries to do what he can to patch them up and get them to the next town, things get worse, and they find themselves forced to spend the night in the local roach motel, run by a singularly unattractive character named Mason (Ruffian's Frank Whaley). All goes well, or as well as can be expected between two people who are about to get divorced but are stuck in a room with one another, until David starts looking through the videotapes on top of the television. They turn out to be snuff films, and he realizes after a few minutes that they were taped in the very room where Amy and David are staying...

Okay, while you've probably never seen this exact twist on the survival-horror genre, it's still very recognizable as the survival-horror genre, and you may well be able to guess everything that's going to happen in this movie just by what I've given you above (hell, you can probably guess the final scene from my first sentence; I did). And yet there is something to be said for not treading any new ground, but sprucing up the old. While Beckinsale turns in a Whiteout for every Brokedown Palace, she turns in at least a credible performance here, and Luke Wilson does something I've never seen him do before: act. Embry is the reason I watched it, and as usual he's got that great hayseed, low-rent-Giovanni-Ribisi thing down pat. But the real show-stealer is Frank Whaley. It's all too easy to believe this guy is going to come kill you in your sleep.

Technically, the movie is adequate, but it really doesn't need to be any more than adequate. This surprises me, since so many movies of this type are laden with special effects, but Antal is willing to let the atmosphere and the actors carry most of the tension. That was a really, really good idea. Had Antal tried to go the Eli Roth route, this would have been an even more boring, predictable picture than it already is. (Like, say, Marcus Nispel's Friday the 13th reboot a few years later.)

Still, while there are a lot of qualities I found myself pleasantly surprised by where this movie was concerned, it's still nothing you haven't seen quite a few times before. An original twist or two to the well-worn details would have raised this into the realm of the above-average; as it is, it's average all the way. ** ",1277251200,2,3262,4.5580204778157
2866874,5,B000RGN2IY,"This is one of the few films of its kind that actually rises above the mere thriller genre into the realm of art.  In large part this is due to the always fresh, always outstanding camerawork of Andrzej Sekula.  Yet even aside from that brilliant photographer, the characters of this film break out of the typical ""run and scream"" modus operandi.  The Luke Wilson character is one of the few (if not the only) of his type to actually DO SOMETHING to try and remedy a desperate situation.  Usually in movies like this, opportunities for portrayals of profound courage are ignored in favor of some sort of spinelessness that I can hardly believe real men in real danger would ever resort to.  Kate Beckinsale was, as usual, flawless.  Apparently Sarah Jessica Parker was originally cast for this role, and I think that would have been a huge mistake.  I imagine this may have been just one more ""scream queen"" role if Parker had been cast, while Beckinsale shows us a genuine portrayal of overwhelming fear.",1270944000,3,1005,4.708571428571428

The movie moves along pretty well for only having five principal characters and takes place predominantly in one close area, the cinematography is decent, the background score in decent horror movie stuff and Frank Whaley, playing Mason the Motel Manager, manages to make a good horror movie anti-hero.

This movie lacks real insight into the circumstance of humanity or the characters, but throws a nice net of uncertainty on the whole situation which adds to the alleged horror value, but gives the movie a lack of credibility. Ultimately, what more did we know about Jason Voorhies' mother after Friday the 13th? Not that much. Maybe we expect more out of horror movies than we used to, maybe we're conditioned to be disappointed by them if the lack a lot of gore or a lot of insight.

Either way, the movie holds water as well as the back screen door.

That being said, the price of the movie is worth the special features, notably Mason's Extended Snuff films. Only about 10 minutes in length, its a great, free-based snuff film gorging.

2866884,4,B000RGN2IY,"""Vacancy"" is not your average thriller/slasher film.  To the untrained eye, it provides nearly an hour and a half of Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale just trying to stay alive in a sleaze-bag motel while being constantly harassed by the unknown locals.  The film seems to follow a structure, it seems to be predictable, but then - it transforms into something diabolically more.  ""Vacancy"" is one of those undercut films that blends the power of a modern Hitchcock with just the right twists to keep new audiences on the edge of their seat.  ""Vacancy"", upon watching it a second time, is more than just slash and grab; it is a cineophile dream come true.

In the modern world of ""Saw"", ""Hostel"" and nearly anything Eli Roth places his name upon, it would be easy to see how this film would be overlooked.  It doesn't have a monster, people are not dripping blood in every scene, and (the biggie) there is no major twist at the end.  Director Nimrod Antal's sophomore outing is more about the style, the cinematography, and the characters than just your a-typical release of this genre.  We are privy to see our characters prior to these horrific incidents, to understand why they are pushed, and despite their ability to just run away from each other, they stay - giving us a great hour and a half.  To begin, the opening credits set the tone.  Not since ""Panic Room"" was I stricken by the originality of these credits, and how they propelled me into a immediate state of nervousness.  After this, we are welcomed into a car, a already tense filled car that keeps us on the edge of our seats even further.  Perhaps Luke and Kate will provide a moment of ease in this ride, but no - quite a different approach than we have seen prior from these two actors - they are in their own zone, and Antal controls it.  He makes us believe.  He scares us, while never taking us out of that moment of disbelief.  This could happen.  Antal knows that, Luke and Kate give us realism, and we are set for a wild ride.

The plot was strong - the acting kept up with the chilling score and Frank Whaley proves that skinny nerds can be frightening.  Whaley commands the time he has on screen, giving us small nuances of this character that others may have forgotten.  Known mainly for lower-budget roles, ""Vacancy"" demonstrates what happens when small actors get good parts (with great directors.).  Finally, one cannot discuss ""Vacancy"" without drooling over the cinematography.  Briefly mentioned above, Antal has paid homage to Hitchcock in a grandiose way by giving us these early shots of our characters not in the foreground, but symbolically traveling along the open highway.  For the first hour, prior to the desperate need to escape, there were filmed moments that just stood out - i.e. the car ride, the discovery of the tapes, the walk to the motel, and even near the end - with the shot of Kate looking through the cracks resonated early Hitch.  This is what small attention to detail can do for your film.

""Vacancy"" is worth a second viewing, and even a third - it impresses me that I like Luke and Kate in their roles, and Whaley hits his mark directly.  Antal's choice of music, cinematography, and leads prove his ability behind the camera, giving us a new twist to a genre that at times feels dated and recycled.  I would recommend this film for a good fright - don't believe it is just another product of the Hollywood machine - it stands tall and proud.

2866885,4,B000RGN2IY,"After watching horror films like ""Wrong Turn,"" you'd think that American drivers would stop taking shortcuts when traveling through the boonies.  Stay on the interstate!  Obviously, David Fox (Luke Wilson of ""Henry Poole is Here"" and ""3:10 to Yuma"") hasn't learned this.  After him and his gorgeous wife Amy (Kate Beckingsale of ""Van Helsing"" and  the ""Underworld"" trilogy) take a shortcut, their car breaks down near an isolated ""Psycho""-like motel where tourists check in but they don't check out.  In their ""honeymoon suite,"" they pass the time by whining, complaining and watching low budget slasher flicks.  Soon they realize that these flicks are all being filmed in the same room as their own.  There is loud pounding on the doors and the fiendish nightmare begins.  Will they escape this hotel from Hell?

  Reminiscent of such classic drive-in horror movies as ""Hotel Hell"" and ""Mountaintop Motel Massacre, ""Vacancy"" is highly suspenseful.  Wilson and Beckingsale make a very adorable couple whose marriage is in trouble.  Having lost their toddler son, Charlie, they are non-communicative and hostile towards one another.  However, their relationship strengthens and their love increases as they struggle to survive this grueling night.  Performances from Beckingsale and Wilson are believable and touching.  You will cheer for them as they flee the maniacs who are determined to film their deaths.  Frank Whaley gives a great performance as the evil, psychotic hotel clerk, Mason.  You want the pervert to die so badly.

  ""Vacancy"" is highly recommended for those who love horror films involving tourists who are preyed upon by serial killers.  Recommended classics from the eighties are ""Tourist Trap,"" ""Hotel Hell,"" and ""Mountaintop Motel Massacre.""  The last one, like ""Vacancy,"" also involves the usage of underground tunnels.

2866890,5,B000RGN2IY,"This is one of the most interesting and artistically competent american horror movies I've seen in quite some time (that wasn't a remake/reboot). Plus, it's scary. The last horror film I really remember in this vein was ""30 Days of Night"" (with its moody existentialism that caught me completely unawares).

Unlike that film though, this one is starkly realistic. Arguably because of that, it's more of a suspense film than a horror film. There is very little gore in the film (it may disappoint splatter fans), but it is extremely suspenseful.

Even though you read the back of the box with its description of a couple whose car breaks down, and decide to stay in a shady motel and think, ""Oh God, this premise has been done to death,"" - the movie feels fresh. It doesn't play out at all like the run of the mill American slasher. It's closer to ""Wait Until Dark"" or some of the Hitchcock films. It has a simple premise, but it has good acting, a great script and decent direction. It also feels believable. No superpowers. No intricate scheme. No scooby doo ending. This is probably the most disturbingly real film since 8mm.

The script of this film really surprised me. There is a significant amount of psychological depth to the relationship between the two main characters. There's a level of characterization that is really very rare in horror movies. It makes the whole experience feel more immediate. It also makes the experience a bit deeper than the usual hack 'n slash because of the abundance of parallels between the plot and the subplot.

Highly recommended for horror fans (as long as you realize it's not a splatter film) and people who like good movies, in general (but get turned off by gore).",1236902400,2,1712,4.7157190635451505

I still give it three and half stars. So if you have seen one to many ""Saws"", pop this in the DVD player. A married couple find themselves lost on a back road and exhausted. Finding gas and a motel becomes a challenge. When they finally find them, they may regret it the rest of their lifes which may be quite short since their room is rigged with cameras to video snuff movies.

2866895,3,B000RGN2IY,"Here's yet another homage to that grand old classic, l960's ""Psycho,"" although this is a movie that Alfred Hitchcock would never recognize. Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale portray the usual couple who are planning to divorce or separate. You never find happy couples in these motel movies. Anyway, after their car breaks down, they check into a strange room in a remote  motel. The room just happens to be the site of a butcher room where snuff films are made. At least this is an original idea.

Luke Wilson does a terrific job as the heroic, courageous man who battles a tiny army of killers and psychos who are determined to make him and his wife their latest victims. Kate Beckinsale has the thankless job of being the usual helpless, cringing, fragile woman who depends on her ""man"" for protection and security. Only towards the end does she show any signs of courage. You would think that after Sigourney Weaver made movie history in the ""Alien"" movies where she ferociously kicked major butt, that our days of seeing delicate, cringing, shrieking female heroines were over with. But, much like the female in ""The Strangers"" she's just a cowering, whining, shrieking blob of jello. You would thinks she'd pick up anything heavy to help her husband in his life and death battle with the killers. At the end, we're asked to believe that her husband does something so unbelievable that we're asked to believe it.

Despite these shortcomings, this film is reasonably entertaining and you can be sure that there are several sequels already being planned.",1230595200,2,1555,4.860377358490566
2866896,3,B000RGN2IY,"Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale put in decent performances in this claustrophobic slasher movie.  The first 20 minutes establish them as a couple on the brink of a failed marriage, who have got lost on the way back from a visit to parents.  They end up staying at a seedy motel, but they soon find the room is not going to give them any rest - the slasher movies in the video player in the room appear to be real, and take place in the same room they are in, and it soon becomes clear they are to be the unwilling stars of the next one.
There are some genuine thrills and the whole thing is put together quite efficiently.  It is not as graphic as some of the torture movies proliferating these days, and better for it.  However, there is a nagging feeling that the first 20 minutes discovering who this couple are, is the most interesting part of the movie.  For the slasher parts, there is a nagging feeling of pointlessness.
That aside, if its nasty slasher thrills you are after, then go ahead.  For dramatic substance, apply elsewhere.",1229644800,2,1040,4.4188481675392675
2866897,4,B000RGN2IY,"This is definitely not a movie to watch all by yourself. This is the kind of movie you watch when you wonder if everything has already been done, and nothing will scare you anymore. Who needs ghosts, devil worshiping murderers, or any kind of the supernatural when you have good old fashioned realistic type of events that COULD happen to you?

Amy and David got off the interstate (BIG mistake) and found that they were having car trouble. Since the mechanics had all gone home for the night, they decided to stay overnight in a creepy motel, since there was nothing else around. The place was run by an equally creepy manager, played by Frank Whaley, who I haven't seen since In the Company of Men.

Even though the hotel was quite dirty and run down, the couple starts to finally relax when someone keeps banging on, not only the door to their room, but the door to the neighboring room. As everyone does in a scary movie, you hear crazy sounds, you investigate, even if you shouldn't. In between trying to find out who is attempting to break in and planning an escape route, David notices some tapes on top of the VCR. Every tape he checks out has people being attacked and killed. Strangely, they all take place in the same room, which is starting to look very familiar...

What follows is an adrenaline filled thrill ride with lots of action, and a few plot holes. VACANCY is a short movie (85 mins) which leaves no extra time for love making scenes or nudity, which some horror film directors feel is necessary to keep us interested. There is no need. This is the kind of movie that leaves you yelling at the screen and discussing with company would YOU would do in that situation. Though I thought that the ending was somewhat weak, I think that the rest of the movie makes up for it. VACANCY 2 will be coming in 2009, and even though it will probably be like a lot of other sequels, that's not going to stop me from watching it.

The manager is a pyscho ala Norman Bates, who with a few other guys, kills the guests and makes snuff films of it to sell to some people. It does sound like a heck of a film, if it was made by someone else. Probably better as a straight to dvd horror film. This one felt too restrained and by the books. They didn't go out of the way to do anything speical, but I did like what happened towards the end. Overall, if you like straight up Hollywood horror film check this out.

2866899,3,B000RGN2IY,"Caught this one off cable recently and honestly I wasn't all that impressed. Wilson and Beckinsale do an adequate job as the broken-hearted couple who's marriage is crumbling after the death of their child, but what got me most about this film is the various degrees of illogical plot points running throughout it. Sure, as a Hitchcockian thriller it does a good job of emulating that eras feel, but in placing that type of film in present-day make sure you have your characters act accordingly. For example, if you were an inn-keeper who secretly killed various guests in a violent invasion style solely for the puropse of filming it to sell snuff films, why in the world would you leave some of the tapes in that room for the future victims to be warned? And if you saw a bunch of cameras in your room's airvents after those tapes, wouldn't you rip them off the walls in shock and anger? Though logic aside, this is a decent middle-of-the-road thriller with a couple of interesting scenes, but with a somewhat let-down ""see, I'm okay after all"" ending. Yes Frank Whaley does come off in this flix as Norman Bates-like, but could probably have pushed the limits a little more, and I'm still surprised that each new viewer of those tapes can recognize that they're in the same motel room just in seconds, even though they just got there.

Entirely predictable, no twists that couldn't be seen a mile away, a complete rip off of far, far better films.

Set in a rundown motel, in the middle of nowhere, a couple finds themselves trapped at night while being stalked by deranged killers - after they have discovered a cache of old videocassettes of murders in a motel room.  The motel room that they are currently staying in!  The cinematic effects and music add to the suspense of this thriller.

However, one unrealistic character, the motel manager (who looks like the manager of my father in law's motel, LOL!) takes away from this movie being a 5 star movie.  Luke Wilson and Kate Bechkinsale are very good actors, and you can feel and share in their horror.

Overall, it's a dark movie that will keep you jumping in your seats.  Will they ever escape before the killers carve them up?

2866902,1,B000RGN2IY,"2007's Vacancy is so bad, it goes far beyond the stretch of imaginative words one can use to describe in no uncertain terms, how truly horrible a film can actually be. The accolades that some reviewers give this, makes me cringe with fright to fully comprehend that another breathing, living human being actually thought this was worth any iota of time to even consider this more than a one star rating. The understanding that two people in a hotel who find a vhs tape with other people getting mauled in the same room was rather chilling, but the reactions by the two leads, played sophmorically horrific by Kate Beckinsale and the inate and pathetic Luke Wilson, are enough to make anyone cringe at an audition for even a Tide commercial in the big city. Luke Wilson is a two-bit pirate of a non talent, and this movie in of itself, showed the very coinage of his capacity to actually care whether or not he brings life, beliveability and cohesion to a role, which is anything but that. I know 10 year olds in acting classes that would have had a more surreal and natural response to being in a hotel room that CLEARLY was a cocoon for rampid killings, and they, both Kate and Luke look at each other, as in some sketch comedy routine (perhaps Monty Python) with their hands on their cheeks wondering, 'oh my Luke, oh golly gee oh darn, what shall we do, where shall we go...."" How about the $^$^$ door for starters, instead of sitting around both looking like lemmings getting carted off to your three hour med cycle.

Vacancy can't deliver, because it has no ensemble to tease us with. The premise is rather unique and mundane at the same time, however the fact of two people getting chased around a hotel room in the middle of a city God forgot, and hopping from different rooms to different rooms, while many extras, and gophers bang on various items or the doors, is NOT creepy, not scary, and not in the least warranted to be anything that an ill attempt at trying to cash in on the Saw series, and ones like it.

Vacancy is for patrons of ill repute watering holes, who have nothing better to do with their time, then spend their two hours on mediocre acting, without a fresh twist, plot or cliffhanger. Absolutely sad.",1219968000,6,2228,4.512376237623762

Wilson and Beckinsale, in perhaps the most hostile couple ever caught on film, are driving in the middle of the night, hopelessly lost.  Way off course and hating each other by the minute (they just had to throw in the telltale photograph of their son who has died under unknown conditions), they stop at a sleazy hotel to sleep it off when they discover some videotapes.  They realize their room is bugged with video equipment, and the murders they see on the tapes have taken place in the very hotel room where they are staying.  The movie unfolds into their harrowing attempts to escape.

It had some potential, but it didn't quite fly off as real suspense.  Instead it turned into one botched attempt after another.  Predictable and kind of hysterical, especially on Beckinsale's part.  Luke Wilson is still in the shadow of his more famous brother Owen and still trying to get out from under him.

2866910,5,B000RGN2IY,"A dark, deserted highway, a lost couple in a broken down car, and a handful of surreal characters that lure them into their horrific, twisted world - these are all classic themes that have served well in horror stories from radio, television and the silver screen.  They are woven together with brilliance in this fantastic movie.

What is great about it is not only the plot devices that were used, but also the ones that were left out.  This is no bloody slasher gorefest.  It doesn't insult you with the worn out, formulaic gimmicks reminiscent of the Freddy Krueger or Friday the 13th dreck.

The scares come more from what you don't see: the face of the guy wearing the mask, the driver of the car that wants to run you down, the source of the screams coming from the motel office, the unseen person pounding on the door in the middle of the night.

The atmosphere is chilling.  Most of the story takes place in a fleabag lodge in the middle of God knows where.  If you've ever stayed in a disgusting hotel, as I have, you'll have a special appreciation for the roach-infested room that the main characters find themselves in.  Along the way to the final scene there are eerie figures stalking the woods, a mad innkeeper with a treasure trove of dark secrets, and ghastly wraiths that seem to appear out of nowhere.  This is back to basics, ghost stories around the campfire stuff, but remade for an adult audience.

You will read complaints in negative reviews about the ""implausible"" ending.  Don't believe them.  Any seasoned paramedic or emergency room worker can tell you that the scene they are referring to is well within the realm of possibility - unlikely, but certainly not unheard of.

I loved this film and it gets my very highest recommendation.

After the banging kept going, I thought maybe ghosts were responsible for stirring up trouble.

After a while though, when it was discovered there were bad guys who apparently loved to kill anyone who spent the night in that room, we pretty much knew what the story was going to be about- the man and woman trying to find a way out of that place, and out of the town to get some help.

The other scary moment was when the couple found some VCR tapes near the TV, and when the husband put the tapes in and seen some frighteningly realistic things (I don't want to spoil what it was they seen) that part was good too.

Sure, there were some creative ways the couple found to avoid the killers, but it wasn't enough to make up for a rather average and obvious way to make a thriller.",1215216000,,1137,4.265116279069767

Amy Fox (Beckinsale) and Dave (Wilson) are a couple struggling in their relationship.  They end up having car problems, much like Breakdown, and are forced to stay the night at the only place available, a horrible looking motel that reminded me quite a bit of Psycho.  That was the first clue they overlooked.  The second clue was the manager, Mason, is about as disturbing as they come.  I didn't know what to expect, but if there was ever a place that videotapes you in the bathroom, it's definitely this place.

The rest of the movie plays out very well, as the couple must deal with the psychological aspects of fear, and eventually with the realistic possibilities of death.

The movie really did creep me out quite a bit.  It's borderline snuff in my opinion.  There are scenes in which it felt a little too real, and the voyueristic nature of the filming techniques made it that much worse.  I suppose that means major kudos for Director Nimrod Antal, because I can't remember a movie that evoked real pathos for characters like this one did for me.

The extras on the disc just made it a little more appealing to me, because they made the rest of the movie feel even more like I was watching realistic snuff purchased in a back alley.

This movie proves that you don't need to rely on computer tricks, soundtracks or bimbos running for their lives while flashing some T & A, although some of that is in the films in the film (you'll need to watch).

2866919,5,B000RGN2IY,"First let me just say that ""Vacancy"" is not a comedy. Not even a horror-comedy. The fact that this film stars Luke Wilson, Kate Beckinsale and Frank Whaley, all of whom have a history of appearing in comedies, had me confused, right up until the moment that I put this movie into my DVD player. There is no tongue planted firmly in cheek here. It is a straight-up horror film and it is genuinely frightening. It also happens to be one of the best horror films that I have see in a long time.

Wilson and Beckinsale play a couple on the verge of divorce who stumble upon the modern day equivalent of The Bates Motel when their car breaks down in the middle of nowhere. Shortly after being assigned the honeymoon suite, the couple discover a pile of home-made snuff movies which look as though they have been made in the very room that they are occupying. Knowing the fate that awaits them, the couple realize that they must put aside their differences and work together if they ever hope to leave the motel.

Although only about 85 minutes in length, director Nimrod Antal manages to fill every one of these minutes with suspense while making the audience genuinely care about the fate of the two protagonists. This is also a function of good script writing. Unlike most horror films, the script is not filled with disposable characters, making you focus on the few characters that are in it. The script is also not as predictable as some of its genre counterparts. The acting is also surprisingly good. Wilson demonstrates that he is just as effective in a serious as he is in comedies, but for me, the true star of the show was Frank Whaley as the creepy, Norman Bates inspired motel manager. Hopefully this film will pave the way for more horror roles for Whaley because I have been a fan of his since ""Swimming with Sharks"" and he doesn't seem to have been getting many film roles recently.

""Vacancy"" went straight to DVD in Australia, which suggests that it probably didn't do all that well at the US box office, which is a shame because it is a really great film. Here's hoping that it develops a cult following on DVD.",1206316800,4,2125,4.514285714285714

Luckily, they get help from a mechanic (Ethan Embry) at a gas station who fixes the car and sends them on their way, only to have the car break down again.

Knowing there was a motel next to the gas station, they hike back to find a phone, but instead, are offered a room by the manager (Frank Whaley). In the decrepit room, they watch videos left on the TV. As they watch, they learn the horror of their situation and that they may not be getting out alive.

Car breaks down, people get stranded, killer stalks them. It's a premise that never fails in concept, but can in execution. Thankfully, this reincarnation of that story is brutally well-done, thanks to the acting, direction, and overall, mood.

Luke Wilson was the last person I would expect to be in a film like this, but I totally forgot he was Luke Wilson (which is a good thing). He becomes his character and even though he may make bad decisions, you still root for him. Kate Beckinsale is also great. From scared to terrified to determined, she covers it all. The chemistry between her and Wilson is spot-on and you want them to make it out alive. The rest of the acting is quite good as well, especially Frank Whaley and Ethan Embry.

Although this film is quite scary, it's also very beautiful. Nimrod Antal does a great job with framing shots and leaving more to the viewer's imagination. After watching the film, I kept thinking about how violent it was, but when I thought it about, there actually was no real gore or blood on screen. It was all tension and shot composition that led you to believe ""how"" horrible the situations were.

If there's only thing I didn't like about the film, it's the ending. It's not terrible by any stretch, but it seemed quite abrupt and I wish there had been a better way of wrapping up things.

Overall though, ""Vacancy"" was a real treat and definitely one to watch on a rainy night. It was creepy and unrelenting and I loved it.",1203984000,2,2328,4.5285714285714285
2866924,5,B000RGN2IY,"My daughter came by for a visit and suggested that we watch a movie together. We selected this film because it had a good cast and was billed as a horror flick. Well, we turned out the lights, and for the duration of the film we were scared out of our wits! It was a truly scary movie!

A married couple, David (Luke Wilson) and Amy (Kate Beckinsale), are on the verge of divorce and their last road trip together. David has taken a shortcut off the highway, and now they find themselves lost on some secondary road with nightfall setting in. To add insult to injury, their car breaks down, but they are able to get a quick fix by an overly friendly mechanic at a roadside gas station.

Unfortunately, the quick fix doesn't hold, and their car breaks down again in the middle of nowhere. They hike back to the gas station only to find it closed. With no mechanic to service their car, they are forced to stay in a seedy, two bit fleabag motel run by a creepy manager, who rents them a rundown room for the night. While in the room, they notice some VHS tapes on a shelf and decide to play one on the VCR. When they do, they get the shock of their lives. Let the games begin!

This is an action packed film that had my daughter and me cowering.  The action is non-stop and the plot is quite novel. This is not a blood and guts kind of movie, but rather one filled with lots of tension and nail-biting suspense. Clearly, the Hitchcock influence is at work here, and the director well understands that less is more.",1203897600,9,1512,4.2578397212543555

Couple checks into isolated motel.  The management has a side business going, making ""snuff films"".  You get the idea. Very high on the creepy-meter scale.

Some great ideas, such as the video left in their Room #4 so the victim couple can see their ""future"".  Realistic interplay between the couple regarding the disintegrating relationship.  I loved the little creep playing Norman Bates' counterpart as the motel clerk.  Perfect.  Despite the seriously violent/perverted theme at play here, there was actually a minimum of really disturbing gratuitous extreme sicko acts or flesh shots(considering that, unfortunately, most of us consider stock Hollywood shooting, strangulation and mayhem to be not very disturbing).

I thought the director often had great tension and impending doom building, and unnecessarily let it slip away in favor of some basic violent conclusion.  The Hollywood violence doesn't bother me, but some Hitchcockian suspense makes for a superior movie.  This one had many great ideas which became missed opportunities.

Still, a very entertaining and suspenseful flick that will probably have even jaded suspense/horror junkies squirming in their chair a bit.  Turn down the lights and enjoy!",1198713600,2,1299,5.402985074626866

Off the beaten track their car deserts them and they end up taking refuge in a shady motel where they quickly learn that they are not the guests but the prey.

I mean, imagine what that crazy, dress-wearing mama's boy could have done with a setup like the one they've got here!  Discreetly placed video cameras, a giant media console, and a labyrinth of secret, underground passageways - all so a bunch of drooling homicidal maniacs can film themselves systematically torturing and killing unsuspecting ""guests"" at their establishment, then watching the atrocities they've committed over and over again at their leisure.  It doesn't take long for David and Amy Fox to figure out that this is one inn where the customers check in but never check out.

""Vacancy"" has some suspenseful moments, but too much of it feels formulaic and predictable, with a dribble-away ending and no real interesting plot twists to distinguish it from a dozen other run-of-the-mill thrillers.  David and Amy even have the requisite death-of-a-small-child subplot to explain their recent estrangement.  Moreover, there's a sadistic undercurrent running through the movie that spoils most of the fun we could be having with the story if it had any real soul or imagination.

And then there are all the nagging practical considerations, such as wondering how these sadistic yahoos pay for all that video equipment if they wind up killing the very few customers who manage to come their way.

VACANCY is a pleasant surprise, but I think one's expectations need to be modest. Also, the film requires a mature, savvy viewer who is tired of teenagers getting in trouble and being stupid, then heroic, then stupidly heroic. Adult thrills done with an aesthetic sensibility and yet delivering something palpable and strong are hard to come by these days. If you agree, catch VACANCY.

2866939,3,B000RGN2IY,"After their car breaks down somewhere off the highway at midnight, a young (and bickering) married couple Kate Beckinsale and Luke Wilson check into an old motel. When they think they are the only guests staying there that night, strange things start to happen, including some banging noises from the next room.

With its nice opening title back and score that strongly remind us of Hitchcock, ""Vacancy"" is an old-fashioned thriller that does not rely on gores to raise its tension. That works to some extent with the effective performances from the leads and atmospheric photography by Andrzej Sekula. Hungarian director Nimrd Antal (""Kontroll"") manages to make us jump with several scary moments at first, but the film's tension slowly vanishes as the story unfolds.

For what ""Vacancy"" shows remains (for me) very familiar. The story here belongs to the territory of urban legends including disturbing images recorded on old VCRs, but slick as it is, the film fails to show a newer angle to tell this old story told in the past.

The film's second (and weaker) part suffers from the lack of originality in storytelling, making the whole situation which was so far pretty intriguing, just incredible. I cannot reveal too much about it, but probably you will think as I did when watching these characters making worst choices. ""Vacancy"" has its moments, but overall just an OK thriller.",1195862400,16,1387,4.995670995670996
2866940,4,B000RGN2IY,"""Vacancy"" is by far a much finer movie than many of the reviews it has gotten since released in the theatres.  This is a slower paced film at first, but supplements that with a realistic feel that is missing from nearly every horror film of today.  Kate Beckinsale gives a great performance in her role, while Luke Wilson leaves a little to be desired.  He is just a little too calm throughout many of the tense scenes and seems to ""lose it"" more when him and his wife fight over marital issues.
The story line is pretty basic:  The car breaks down late at night, nothing is open, they decide to stay at the nearest motel, HELL breaks loose.  This film is very similiar to the fantastic ""Wolf Creek"" both in plot and style.  The soundtrack in this film is phenomenal as well.  Perhaps my favorite part of this movie was the ultra realistic ending.  I won't give it away, but I was proud of Nimrod Antal for giving me an ending I could believe.

There is a great atmosphere of total loneliness and despair amongst what other directors truly fail to capture.  The fact that this could very well be real is the true grit of the flick.  There's lots of horror choices out there and in most cases you'll get gore or a story, but rarely both.  In Vacancy, you get a bit of both, but not too much of either, which in it's own way makes the movie more mysterious and creepy.  I can't think of too many creepier movies out there like this one in modern time.  It's nothing like Psycho, Identity or Joy Ride, but it ranks well up there in my opinion.  I'll agree with another reader that it is better than Disturbia and the few other decent horror flicks out there at the moment.

The feeling of being trapped with people watching you opens up all sorts of scary possibilities..

This movie isn't scary and probably could have used some more gore just to set a more serious tone. Others have mentioned that the leads were probably too famous and I agree. I just never took them too seriously even when they were clearly in danger. Previous movies like ""deliverance"" have managed to use comedy actors in serious situations but this movie doesn't.

I knew exactly how it would end; nothing was surprising or tense. Too formula for a movie that had a minor twist on a horror staple.

This wasn't a stupid slasher about revenger or some myastical force, this was something that was and felt very real, a quality lacking from many movies today.

The suspense, tension, fear all build in the viewer. Much to my surprise, the director avoids almost all off ""characters acting irrationally"" cliches. They start out by panicking, but rationality and intelligence begin to reign as they gradually take back control. It remains tight and suspenseful almost to the very last cut. Given the film's terrible start I was quite surprised that at the end (a) I wanted to see it again, (b) I was thinking it might become a horror classic, and (c) I was wishing it was a bit longer.

Then it does something suprising. It gets better. A LOT better.

For full disclosure, long movies PISS me off. 95% of movies I see should be shorter; 4% are too short; and 1% are just right.

Personally, I feel that this movie isn't in the 1% of just right. It's actually a little too short. It could really use an extra minute or two of melodrama to work out some of the finer points.

But that's not bad. A too short running time actually makes it a better viewing EXPERIENCE (if not a better movie) than the majority of other films out there. I respect a film that doesn't waste my time. This is one of those.

That said, the frenzied pace -- somwhat similar to Red Eye but more satisfying -- does accomplish one thing. It keeps you on the edge of your seat.

2866956,5,B000RGN2IY,"In the era of what has been dubbed ""torture porn,"" it was only a matter of time before someone tried to take a serious crack at creating a disturbing thriller that's well acted and more about survival vs. watching the victims all die.

Amy (Kate Beckinsale, doing a great job of acting terrified instead of just sitting pretty) and David (Luke Wilson, who earns his acting kudos here) Fox have recently lost a child to an accident.  Their marriage is falling apart and they have just come back from a family party where they had to pretend things were fine.  Thus we have dramatic tension as the two bicker, driving to God-knows-where in the middle of the night.

(Welcome to Spoilertown! All who fear learning what happens to this couple should leave now.)

When their car breaks down, the Foxs are forced to stop at a local motel.  Only this motel isn't ordinary.  The guy at the front desk, Mason (Frank Whaley) is clearly a creep.  In fact, he's so creepy that he walks out of a video room to a rising crescendo of a woman's shrieks.  Refreshingly, there's nothing hidden here; everything about Mason screams ""I am a serial killer"" but our protagonists are running out of options and are too distracted by their own personal grievance. So they stay at the mostly deserted hotel.

Agitated by their circumstances, David pops a video into the VCR and discovers that he's watching a snuff film. A snuff film takes place in the very room they're in.

And thus our protagonists are thrust into a life-and-death struggle.  Refreshingly, David has a level head on his shoulders and works through each step.  If the killers left the video in the room, they knew whoever stayed there would see it, so they clearly have the upper hand.  If the killers appear from off camera in the film, then clearly there's a means of entering the room they're not aware of.  And since there's so many videotapes laying around, these guys have been at it for a while.

Vacancy does toy with our sensibilities, be it the cop who never calls for backup, the ability to survive gaping stomach wounds, or loaded pistols hanging in the lobby...but it's easy to forgive.  Every twist and turn, every desperate attempt, is riveting.  Best of all, sometimes our protagonists' gambits simply fail, with horrible consequences. Despite the premise, there really isn't much gore.

Vacancy is a particularly disturbing breed of horror.  I've been at hotels where someone banged on the door in the middle of the night.  I've been at hotels where the people in the next room sound like they're doing something illegal.  I've been at hotels where the front desk is behind Plexiglas with cameras everywhere.  Vacancy's premise blends the perfect cocktail of emotional and physical isolation with the fact that some hotels are just plain nasty.

2866964,2,B000RGN2IY,"Vacancy has all the elements of a great suspense film, despite the fact that we've seen the 'couple gets stranded in the middle of nowhere with a brokedown car' theme dozens of times. Yet, VACANCY has a unique twist. Couple gets stranded in the middle of nowhere with a brokedown car and find themselves watching a snuff film in a hotel room that was also the set of the forementioned film.

Many things are done right in VACANCY. Ultimately, the movie is sort of rattling as it begins to unfold. You feel the helpless situation that Amy & David Fox (Kate Beckinsale & Luke Wilson) are facing. With nowhere to turn and no means of transportation, the violence and fears unfold quickly. Many scenes are very memorable.

*SPOILERS AHEAD*

Yet, too many things were done horribly wrong and it spoils what could have been a great film. First of all, obviously, the couple is experiencing grief from the death of a young son (explained early in the film). It is never fully explored and ends up being ultimately pointless in a movie that only lasted 80 minutes. The movie then has a solid middle, with good build up, good fears and good execution, all the way up to the shocking demise of a key player. Only to be ruined by one of the most coincidental, cliche finale's I have ever seen.

Amy Fox has a physical altercation with Mason, the hotel desk clerk (the Norman Bates of the film), who knocks her gun from his hand and it flys across the room. Why, after being successfully careful about making a scene and keeping his sick obsession hidden, does he throw her around in the front room instead of dragging her back into his office where he can't be seen? Well, that leads to him throwing her... where?... oh of course, ON THE GUN. Sheesss...

Then, as Amy Fox tries to drive away in a car, one of the crazies jumps on her car and so she hits the gas and drives out of control... well forward... out of control... but of course, the other crazy steps out of room right in front of the car which crashes into him, into a room and kills BOTH MEN. It can't get worse... can it? ... well, sure. As she finally is given some breathing room and is given the opportunity to grieve the loss of her previously knifed to death husband... he coughs and begins to breath... aaaaahhhhH!!!!  NO!!!!

Frankly, I can't believe that a hollywood director or a hollywood studio or hollywood actors would allow such a ridiculous closure to a film these days... but it happened. Can only be described as LAZINESS. In an 80 minute film, I can't see why they couldn't have shot some more scenes, made things more feasible and finished this film properly.

As much as I love Kate Beckinsale, I can only recommend the first hour of this film.",1191369600,4,2717,4.48582995951417
2866965,3,B000RGN2IY,"Director Nimrod Antal broke out the Cliff's Notes on Hitchcock when he put ""Vacancy"" on the screen.  From the frantic music in the beginning to a story littered with bizarre angles and dark corners, you'll see the legend's thumbprint throughout this film.  Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale play a couple on the edge of divorce who's car breaks down in the middle of nowhere.  A friendly (perhaps too friendly) mechanic (Ethan Embry) fixes them up just enough to make it to a larger town.  Unfortunately his mechanical skills leave them stranded once again, and they are forced to stay in a run-down motel under the management of Frank Whaley (in full creepy guy regalia).

Once they get into their dilapidated room, Wilson decides to watch a few VHS tapes left on top of the television.  What he and Beckinsale soon realize is that the ""movies"" they are watching all seem to have been filmed in their room.  From there, the movie begins to pick up the pace.  Wilson and Beckinsale have to dodge the attacks of two killers trying to add them to the latest film.

There are a number of problems that I found with this film.  Firstly, there isn't very much original about it.  Antal literally lifted a number of ideas from Hitchcock.  Wilson and Beckinsale open the movie with a long and boring midnight ride where they bicker with each other.  I'm assuming that this is to build interest in their characters, but they really aren't that likeable.  In fact, Whaley is the only real standout in the cast.  His character is sinisterly whacky.  Ethan Embry does pretty good with the minimal lines he's given.  The action in the film is tense at moments, but you soon get the feeling that you've seen it all before.  In the end, the movie does slightly redeem its forgettable first act, but it's not worth more than three stars in my book.

The extras on the DVD are par for the course.  The highlight of the special features is a ""making of"" featurette in which we get a peek at how the film came to be.  It's a little self-serving, but most featurettes like this are.  If you feel like it, the snuff films that Wilson and Beckinsale watch during the film can be watched in their entirety, but they really aren't worth it.

In short, this movie has a bland opening that nearly kills the film.  The story does manage to hold one's interest once the killers enter the picture, but I'd only consider ""Vacancy"" to be a rental and nothing more.",1191283200,5,2432,4.563510392609699

The acting was somewhat blah but was tolerable. Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale probably only acted in this mess to pay off a past due car note. Neither seemed all that thrilled to be in this production. Additionally, I felt that the sets were cheap and the lighting was bad teamed with the fact that Katie B. needed moisturizer and makeup, as she looked an ashy mess in some scenes. However, I will say one thing for this film. The plot was solid, even though it was executed sloppily.

It's a terrifying premise made even more so because it could  very easily happen in a modern, frenetic and oftentimes, twisted society, where pedophiles prowl the internet hunting for children and teenage slaves are found hidden under the stairs in homes in suburban America.  The idea that  sexual deviants could set up a snuff-film factory in an out of the way motel, is really not in the least far fetched.  Keep in mind that the idea behind Eli Roth's Hostel was an actual place in Thailand where for a fee, human's hunt other humans for sport.  The mind of the sadist has no limits, as we've seen it time and again through the course of history, from Elizabeth Bathory, to Marquis de Sade, to Joseph Mengele and this film just sheds light on another aberration of the human psyche:  Watching someone brutalized and murdered in order to incite sexual pleasure.  A more than sub-genre of the pornography industry, snuff films do exist and there's no telling where one of its progenitor's may be hiding, just waiting for the right moment to create and capture death at its most violent and disturbing.  It's this idea that disturbed me the most about ""Vacancy;"" they've managed to turn something as commonplace as a motel and make it a wholly terrifying place, completely vulnerable to the machinations of a sick mind.  Over 40 years ago, Hitchcock served us our first motel shocker in his inimitable and brilliant ""Psycho,"" but there was a method to Norman's madness.

They inadvertently sort of end up with car problems and some major coincidences happen that give one deja vu to a few recent horror films which weren't that good either.  They enter a motel run by a sick SOB(Frank Whaley in bad need of money) who has two guys dress up in Slipknot masks and kill people while taping it. Ho-hum.  People bang on doors, they watch the videos of people being tortured and murdered and realize that hey, THIS IS THE MOTEL WHERE IT HAPPENED!  At no point is there a real sense of pathos or even anything that disturbing.  It's about as believable and engaging as an address to the Nation by our current President.

2866974,2,B000RGN2IY,"A movie with so many holes they've been known to sell it at donut shops, ""Vacancy"" is all about nobody being home. Take for instance a couple of spoilers in this spoiler: A stack of homemade VHS tapes in the control room of our motel hell implies the trio of S&M hick-nerd antagonists have snuffed out hundreds of guests in previous bursts of exuberant torture. So why is it such a difficult task to finish off awkward, amoeba-jowled Luke Wilson when he's lying unconscious on the floor of a motel room? A sudden aversion to the sight of blood or just a real fondness for ""Old School""?

We've been down this road so many times I'm starting to think that these movies are subsidized by the Department of Transportation.

The yellow brick road allegory of stick to the path or you will die. Stephen King milked it when he wrote about the secret path to a pet cemetery. It's almost an endorsement of pack mentality.

How about this one? Does anyone believe a whitebread woman living an upscale lifestyle, given a situation in which she is stuck at the fringe of civilization at midnight with a car broken down on the side of a highway a mile from that hotel standing a mere 100 feet away, would utter, ""Let's go back to the car and wait"" to her husband moments after smiling comfortably while talking to the obligatory gas-station-in-the-middle-of-nowhere clerk? No. It's stupid and this kind of lazy, half-donkey dialogue shows up constantly like a renegade fly buzzing around your bedroom will occasionally ruffle your hair.

The buildup of suspense in this movie is tremendous. A distraught couple on a road trip gets lost in the middle of nowhere.  Then the car breaks down and they're forced to walk to an old creepy motel.  Okay, this might not be totally original, but we're still doing okay.
When they get to their room, it gets totally freaky.  They pop in some complimentary tapes in the VCR, and are totally shocked by the show.  It's a smut tape, depicting some pretty savage murders, as smut tapes usually do.  The worse thing is, these murders are apparently taking place in the very room they are staying.  Holy potatoes!  Crazy, party of two, your coffin is ready!
At this point, I'm totally drawn in, nervous, scared of the outcome...but unfortunately, Hollywood then takes over.
Vacancy then begins to revel in its own absurdity.  The two hotel guests call 911 from a payphone, of course the murderer answers.  Shortly after he drives his car through the phonebooth, smashing it to pieces.  Thats the start of the cliched and unbelievable moments that caused my interest to spew out of my ears.  How about this one--the woman makes a mad dash for a car in the parking lot, of course it starts up but the bad guy lunges at her through the moonroof as she drives frantically into the hotel wall.  It's well shot and gruesomely bloody, just slightly ridiculous.
There's more where that came from, underground tunnels beneath the rooms for example.  Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale do a pretty good job in this, but I found myself begging for their characters to die to add some realism to the story.

2866977,5,B000RGN2IY,"""Vacancy"" is riveting, frightening, and absolutely engaging from start to finish, easily one of 2007's best.  A broken-down car on an isolated road that was supposed to be a short cut between the interstate highways leads Amy (Kate Beckinsale) and David (Luke Wilson) - whose marriage is crumbling away to nothingness following the accidental death of their only child some time ago - to a remote motel.  Once settled in for the night, the couple tries to take their minds off their mutual discomfort by finding something to watch from among the room's large collection of videocassettes, discovering only amateurishly shot, grainy, ultra-violent films that, as becomes quickly apparant, where all shot in the same motel where Amy and David are now staying.

  The motel, it seems, is run by sociopaths who use it as the staging ground for making their own snuff videos.  And as the only current lodgers in the place, Beckinsale and Wilson are apparantly slated to star in the next feature.  Isolated in the proverbial 'middle of nowhere' with no vehicle and no weapons.

  Thankfully, ""Vacancy"" doesn't follow the same path as other films that have tried to be horror movies, to in some way be about horror movies or movies in general, and still be a critical indictment of horror movies.  Ergo, there's no attempt to draw some ludicrous link between real-life killings or supposedly 'real-life' snuff films, and legitmate horror movies.  Instead the movie keeps itself charged with enough suspense, horror and thrills to create one of the most electrifyingly watchable, white-hot tense films of the year. It comes off surprisingly plausible, and mixes mystery atmosphere with more action-oriented, high-velocity horror moments with perfect skill. That it's utterly comelling from the very beginning, long before getting to the ominous motel, is thanks in no small part to terrific performances by Beckinsale and Wilson, smart writing, and perfect pacing.  It's almost inconceivable that by year's end, ""Vacancy"" won't still be among 2007's ten best.  See it.",1189209600,2,2060,5.18429003021148

I must say i really enjoyed this movie, it was a solid thriller with alot of twists and turns, very very intriguing.

for me, I really enjoy Thrillers alot, especially ones involving a small group of people being lost or trapped and which usually takes place in one night or one day, and Vacancy fulfills this criteria as the plot involved a couple who have their car broken down in middle of nowhere, and they are forced to spend a night in a creepy motel, and things gets really scary there..i won't go on so i don't spoil anything for others..
But i highly recommend this movie, it kept me glued to the TV set as i watched and i literally sat on the edge of my seat as the movie became more and more suspenseful and thrilling.

Do they stand around and argue, or walk back a few miles and stay at the empty-looking hotel with the friendly mechanic (who happens to be Ethan Embry in the weirdest out-of-character role since Anne Hathaway in Havoc)?  Vacancy promises to answer these burning questions and more.

Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale, both capable actors in their own right, do their best to create David and Amy Fox, a couple who lost a child, and are about to lose their marriage. We learn all about their marital problems in the longest expositional scene in recent history. After 20 minutes, when audiences are still waiting for something to happen, that 80 minute running time doesn't feel as short as it originally did. By the time the couple's car breaks down and they settle into the hotel room to begin the inevitable torturous night that the ads proclaim, the Foxes are lucky to still have an audience watching at all.

Director Nimrod Antal received a great deal of praise for his Hungrian-made Kontroll, but in bringing his skills to the American screen, he's lost something in translation. Though the camera work is mostly top-notch, despite some terrible framings on the opening car shots, Vacancy still lacks a good amount of punch. There's no real drive behind the story. In a film that's all about action, the action is glaringly absent. The only excitement to be found is in yelling at the main characters each time they do something else completely illogical. Audience members will find themselves shouting (again) ""No, don't do THAT!"" This is the kind of horror movie that was tired in the 60's. 40 years later it's beyond cliche.

Vacancy is not a film for the faint of heart, but for the faint of mind.  Pushing itself off as a Hitchcockian suspense thriller only serves to highlight the film's shortcomings. In reality, Vacancy is more comparable to a side story Eli Roth might have left on the cutting room floor of Hostel II.

I did not hate this movie. The story was actually very interesting, but the way it was played out was disappointing. Not only was it predictable in some parts, but it also felt incomplete- like you felt they could have done so much more to make the film better than it was. The ending was especially anti- climatic and the tension build up overall was not as intense as others promised it would be. It was a pretty tame film actually to my surprise.

Honestly it's a mediocre thriller above all. It is entertaining enough, but I sincerely doubt anyone would deny it could have been much better as well.

Every little ""boo, here I am"" is yet another ""ooo, ahh, didn't see that coming"" moment.  A part of my life I would gladly like to have back to invest into something else.  What is worse, I can't believe that Luke Wilson or Kate Beckinsale would associate themselves with this below B flick.

2866989,4,B000RGN2IY,"I didn't have anything to do one Wednesday evening so I went to the movie theater to see Vacancy. I fully expected this movie to be total cheese and derivative of every other horror/slasher/roadside motel movie ever made. I was completely right, it was cheesy, exploitative and derivative but... surprise, surprise! I was still entertained more than this seemingly bad movie had any right to entertain me!

Some of you might get discouraged because this film looks like another tasteless torture flick that we've been subjected to recently by many sleazy Hollywood producers and directors. But you'd be wrong. This is not a torture flick, the only really sleazy footage are the video tapes that are left behind in Luke Wilson's and Kate Beckinsale's motel room for them to watch. We don't get to see any hardcore violence, it's more of the psychological atmosphere that involves us. So, if you are a big baby and scared of gore or if you are a mature filmgoer who doesn't need to watch stupid exploitation like Hostel, don't worry. Vacancy is cut from a different cloth of filmmaking, evoking past themes from Psycho and classic horror films.

Both lead actors do admirable jobs in their roles and Frank Whaley ( yeah! ) plays the motel manager. This film is lean and effective. There is little padding, the set-up is classic horror stuff drawing in the viewer minute by minute and the movie is fairly short. Near the end, the film starts to stray from it's formula and starts to go over the top a bit, like most horror films of late, but I'll give it's deficiencies a pass. This movie is a fun rental for genre fans, but not a necessary purchase. Enjoy!",1188691200,,1654,4.7
2866990,3,B000RGN2IY,"Wow, you look at the DVD cover and see Luke Wilson and the stunning Kate Beckinsale and think ""this looks like a good one."" I guess that just goes to prove that first impressions can be deceiving.

The '07 release 'Vacancy' shamelessly uses every gimmick one has come to expect within the arsenal of the slasher/psycho genre;

1- Car breaks down late at night on a dark and lonely road off the beaten path.
2- They come upon a seedy motel with a sleezy man behind the registration desk and check in for the night.
3- The television set in their room plays only unlabeld snuff films on vhs tapes provided by the management.
4- When they discover something is extremely wrong with their lodgings they learn that the telephone is disconected and a man in a leather mask is stalking the motel grounds preventing any escape.

Does any of this sound familiar? It even uses the obligatory quick peek behind the shower curtain routine and the usual hordes of rats in an attempt to make the audience squimish. Unfortunately 'Vacancy' contains all the necessary ingredients but none of the unique quirkiness that attracts a cult following. Looking for some shock value? The only thing I find shocking about this film is the thought that two stars the caliper of Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale would actually be in such schlock.

2866991,3,B000RGN2IY,"All of the ads made Vacancy look like just another entry in the current sexy, torture, gore sweepstakes, but this is actually one of the more restrained, non-exploitative psychological/horror/thrillers to come along in quite some time. And while it's also one of the better ones to come along of late, it's almost completely sunk by a truly awful final conclusion, one that leaves a pall over the rest of the movie. Hence, the ending sucked.....The first hour was great, the two lovers running around a seedy, old motel that has sub basements and tunnels dug everywhere.
The director does something interesting in the movie, he frames the shots so that me, the audience gets an intense claustrophobic, locked up feeling. During the middle and towards the end of the movie the intensity widens and all hell breaks loose to a real crappy ending.
I don't know what went wrong with the ending, but I can't imagine why anyone thought what happens here would be the way to go. The finale is abrupt and unbelievably anti-climatic. For a moment I actually wondered if something happen to the movie reel in the booth, but alas I was wrong and it just ended anti-climatically.",1188518400,3,1166,4.8059701492537314
2866992,4,B000RGN2IY,"I saw the previews for Vacancy in the theater and knew I had to see this movie. Well, I missed it in the theater but I bought it on DVD. While it is not without its flaws, Vacancy is a nail biter. It has a script that pairs logic and believability together for the set-up.

For all of us who have seen every stranded motorist film...or Psycho rip-off (which ultimately, this is...), this film is the most intelligent and fresh of them all.

Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsdale are a married couple on the verge of divorce. We aren't told specifically why (which makes this all the more believable), but glean from information provided, that the death of their only son is causing it to crumble. When the husband slams on the brakes to avoid hitting a raccoon, the car starts making noises...but nothing serious. They pull into a service station to have the noise checked out (since they are in the boondocks) and the ostensibly well-meaning service guy (Ethan Embry, excellent in a small role) helps them out...or does he?

The car breaks down and they must hit the road to go back to the service station to get assistance. Since it's late and the station is now closed they relegate themselves to staying the night in the small town's Rat Pack era motel. And that's when things start to go really bad.

This film builds suspense and tension and uses our own inate fears to forward the frights. While I confess that the first 2/3 of the film are well planned and the frights believable, I found the last 1/3 to be more run of the mill, and far-fetched. That said, it didn't diminsh the frights previously delivered.

Another point that bears telling: This is NOT a gory film. It is not a ""gross"" film. It is a frightening film with very very limited blood. There is no sex and, if my memory serves me, there is little cursing. It's an exercise in fear that extends beyond the teen slice 'em and dice 'em films.

Frank Whaley is great as the spooky / creepy hotel manager.  From the start, you can tell there is something not quite right about him.  I've always been a big fan of  Kate Beckinsale, even though in this movie her character is exhausted and chippy before having to struggle just to survive.

It is actually a very well crafted, edge of the seat, thriller in a Hitchcockian style. It has more scares and jumps than the usual serial killer type flick and does away with the usual generous helping of gore of this genre while still capturing the terror and fear you would feel if in a similar situation. The characters behave very naturally and appear human rather than heroic.

It's heavy on suspense and light on violence.  The violence that does occur on film is cleverly shot as to not be gratuitous (i.e. people get stabbed and the cut is slightly off screen).

The film focuses on a near-divorced couple who wind up in a run down part of Americana and get stranded.  They check into the kind of motel that only Leatherface would sleep in and before long realize that they are about to become stars in a real-life Snuff Film.

To give away more would spoil the point of the movie.  There's some jumps, chases, scares, fights, screaming, and a decent game of cat-n-mouse.

2867010,3,B000RGN2IY,"VACANCY may not be the best thriller of the year, though it does provide three good performances from Kate Beckinsale, Frank Whaley and a surprise serious role for fine comedian Luke Wilson, but it stands apart from many by the fact that it unveils a piece of the underbelly of crime by addressing the creation of snuff films (films made by strange minds that show the death of the actors, and whether or not we like to believe it, there is an audience for that!). The fact that the film (as shown in the very good featurette additions) was filmed entirely on a studio set adds to the admiration that grows after the fright diminishes. And writer Mark L. Smith and director Nimr&oacute;d Antal deserve credit for their project.

The plot is simple: on a night road married couple Amy (Kate Beckinsale) and David Fox (Luke Wilson) are lost and the tension of the night only ads to the fact that this couple is in the throes of a broken marriage, one that fractured at the accidental death of their only son.  Frustrated and angry with each other and their plight, they end up stranded in the middle of nowhere and check in to a morbid motel managed by the oily and repulsive Mason (Frank Whaley).  From the moment they enter their room they realize something is wrong: the videos on the television are snuff films filmed in the room in which they are staying.  From there the action of the film speeds up and is a non-stop ingenious attempt to escape the killers that besiege their room.  The trauma of the night makes Amy and David reconsider their history and the film ends with a grande guignol bang.

Beckinsale and Wilson make a credible couple and the writer and director have opted to make the film more about the relationship of the estranged couple than just about horror.  It works.

From the beginning score during the credits it's like something from a Hitchcock film and like Hitchcock's psycho were back at a Motel on another suspenseful thrill ride.  Instead of Norman Bates we get Mason a desk clerk played  effectively by Frank Whaley, however during Psycho we as viewers find ourselves almost nervous for Norman as when the car stops sinking in the bog, there is no sympathy for this desk clerk, only anger and hatred.

The plot is simple enough a couple with issues perhaps on there way to divorce car breaks down and they find themselves at the above mentioned motel.  The couple is played by Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale who in my opinion have never been better, they are a relatable and believable couple and there is character development.  They get there room from the awkward desk clerk and soon after that there is banging at the door and the phone rings but nobody is there.  These subtle things are real, can happen and can be terrifying however the horror comes when Luke Wilson's character inserts the videotape in his room to find something shocking and disturbing.

The Film is 80 minutes long and is filled with suspense, particularly the beginning when they are driving, every shot you feel like something is about to happen and you are on edge, it loses itself a bit towards the end but the 80mins does go by fast.

As Laura Kern states in this months Film Comment Magazine ""it's no Psycho - but what is?  Still, with its perfectly eerie sets, stark lighting, inventive camerawork, and jarring frights, Vacancy comes closer than any other thriller in recent memory.""  I would agree 100%.

No peoples, you will not see her romancing fighter pilots among parachutes like that movie Pearl Harbor, in this movie her and her husband are on one last venture before getting divorced, which logically makes absolutely no sense whatsoever since they argue all the time anyway.  Ok peoples never mind the loss of romance, this is just pure horror, it is not a slasher it is a scary movie.  Not the Scary Movie franchise peoples and I doubt this one will have any scene played in any future Scary movie films, but that is not relevant!

What is relevant is that you do not be stupid when venturing somewhere that you are not familiar with.  Being nice to the dude who was not fixing his car but secretly destroying it so they would be stranded was just dumb.  Then again there are so many rude people in this world I can see where they thought being nice to the young man might get them some candy points.  BZZZZZZZZZZZZ! Wrong again!

I did not understand what the gray face paint was for.  What was that all about?  Did they run out of urban camo and just use some bearing grease from the garage?  Oh and that tunnel under the hotel motel California (you can check out any time you like haha but you can NEVER LEAVE HAHAHAHA) was  way out of code, the inspector would have caught that.  And the phones not working and on and on, this fool would have only gotten away with this kind of krap for about 23 hours and then Eric Estrada and the Chips dudes would have busted them big time.  This was also the same motel used in the movie Cobra and obviously they fixed it up since then because in that movie Stallone and his lady were getting shot at and stuff.

Just keep driving, and if you do stop bring a .45 and some roach spray.  Oh and a DVD player and a stereo to because nothing works at that place.",1187136000,5,2491,4.2

2867016,4,B000RGN2IY,"Although it becomes a bit predictable by the end of the second act, ""Vacancy"" breathes new life into the suspense thriller genre by taking an unusual premise, a married couple at the end of their relationship  and mixing it up with dazzling techique to create a great little thriller. Director Nimrod Antal and the writer take an unsual tact by actually creating characters we care about that are having  major martial problems. Although it becomes predictable by the second act, I was sucked in to the film enough so that I was willing to stick around and finish the ride.

SPOILERS*

David (Luke Wilson) and Amy Fox (Kate Beckinsale)are stranded in the middle of nowhere while on a trip. They end up staying at a ratty looking motel. The creepy manager (well played by Frank Whaley in a role that echoes both ""Psycho"" and ""Touch of Evil"")and dilapated appearence of the motel hint that it isn't going to be a quiet night for the couple.  What David & Amy don't realize is that the survival of their marriage is the least of their concerns.

END OF SPOILERS*

A taunt, well directed thriller, ""Vacancy"" isn't deep--it's a nail biting thriller that doesn't take the easy like a lot of slasher flicks that rely a bit too heavily on blood and gore. ""Vacancy"" works due to the appealing work of Luke Wilson, Kate Beckinsale and the creepy performance of Frank Whaley. Unlike a lot of thrillers, the backstory for the characters is actually interesting.

Using his skills in film technique Antal manages to create suspense electing NOT to take lazy approach that we see in all these torture porn films (yes Eli Roth I am talking about your films ""Hostel"" and ""Hostel II"") simply putting more gore on screen. The film reminds me of ""Identity"" and ""Breakdown"" (and, of course, the granddaddy of all these films ""Psycho"") in that the director digs deep into the characters to help create suspense during the first half of the film. Sure the film has a couple of cheap thrills but on the whole the makers of ""Vacancy"" opt for using their characters and the situations to generate suspense as opposed to just throwing blood and guts at the audience. Those expecting a film like ""Hostel"" or ""The Hills Have Eyes II"" will be disappointed but those expecting solid performances and skillful direction will enjoy this film.

 ""Vacancy"" reflects the skill that John Carpenter or even Hitchcock might have displayed at the top of their game. What makes the film unique is that the director and writer doesn't make this into your typical slasher film developing the main characters so that we can identify with them and root for them once they are on the run from the killers.

The transfer is top notch with solid blacks, a sharp looking picture and bold colors. The extras on the disc are a bit disappointing. We get a deleted scene, a couple of the ""unedited"" films that Amy & David see when they put the videos on their room and a short featurette on the making of the film. I'm a bit disappointed that there isn't a commentary track from the writer or director but, really, the film kind of speaks for itself with its marvelous set pieces. We do get a lot of previews for forthcoming flicks. I didn't watch the pan & scan version included on the same disc so have no comments on how it looks, sounds, etc.

You might want to check into this motel. You won't get any sleep but you will get a suspenseful filled thrill ride. The film takes some unexpected twists and turns in its plot that will keep you on the edge of your seat. 3 1/2 stars.",1187136000,9,3529,4.593004769475358
2867017,3,B000RGN2IY,"...although I would not really consider it a slasher as it lacks the gore and body count of such. The story: a couple make a detour while on a trip, their car breaks down, end up in some old Motel, then end up fighting for their lives. Not a horrible movie, however, as I said before, a very very low body count, and not enough suspense or action to fill in the gaps. As far as the HD presentation, I was disappointed, I've seen better HD transfers, this one is not one of them (maybe it is because most of the movie takes place in the dark). I have not seen the DVD version, but this did not look that much different from a standard DVD. Worth as a rental, and a rental only.",1187049600,,676,4.052238805970149
2867018,3,B000RGN2IY,"A white-knuckle thriller with a wide range of terror and a narrowed setting, Vacancy plays out with a stark level of realism for its hopefully farfetched plot, but feels cornered by Hollywood's demand for a clichd conclusion. With solid performances, a catchy horror score, and an inventively macabre premise, Vacancy still manages to be a lot of fun packed into a minimal amount of time.

Unhappy couple David (Luke Wilson) and Amy Fox (Kate Beckinsale) are returning home from a trying endeavor involving their failing marriage and take a shortcut off the highway to save time. An unexpected turn of events finds their car out of commission and the weary travelers are forced to stay at a seedy motel whose visitors meet a ghastly fate for entertainment, and do anything but smile for the camera. In order to escape, David and Amy must rely on each other (as well as a few blunders on behalf of the murderers) in a desperate fight for survival.

Both relative newcomers to the horror film genre, Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale add a charmingly realistic appeal to their characters as a troubled couple on the verge of separation, possibly due to the death of their son. Their early incessant bickering and apparent exhaustion of each other's presence on the tiresome drive home puts an interesting spin on the typical horror movie victims. Because there are only two main protagonists, all character development is more intensely focused and the audience is treated to a richer introduction to their lives, resulting in added appreciation and sympathy for their dire situation.

Without ""stupid"" villains, most horror films would last only ten minutes with all protagonists dead and disposed of in half that amount of time. For the sake of suspense and feature-length thrillers, the entities of evil involved usually make a mistake somewhere along the line, allowing the forces of good to prevail, if only for a little while. The antagonists in Vacancy aren't spared from this trait and while they are certainly menacing, they are equally dimwitted, unambitious, and unimaginative when it comes to the dastardly deeds set forth for them to commit. On top of this they are also inexplicably absent while their prey is attempting to escape. We forgive them though, because without their ineptitude there would be no harrowing close calls or shocking near-misses.

While the trailer gives away more plot twists than I probably will, those afraid of spoilers may want to skip this paragraph. Hollywood seems to have an infatuation with happy endings in horror films, or the overly clich twist ending where the bad guy isn't really dead or the creature mutated, transformed, or otherwise escaped in part or in whole from whatever intricate and seemingly inescapable plan was devised to destroy it. Vacancy contains no such alien life forms, but it does offer a rather unexpected (and unfortunately unwanted) twist in its conclusion. Perhaps the studios believe that the majority of audiences wouldn't enjoy a more tragic ending, or were test audiences not pleased by a more realistic encounter with vicious thugs? I suppose a plot involving only two main protagonists might create too strong an emotional bond between the characters and the viewer to see such a grievous fate befall them. But then again, it's a horror film. Isn't violent death a prerequisite? Shouldn't one expect dark tragedy to afflict its characters? Director Nimrod Antal has created a believably realistic scenario with a likeable couple placed in a chilling plight, but ultimately betrays his audience with an unrealistic twist - though the decision may not have been entirely his.

Regardless of any intentional or forced changes in its denouement, Vacancy manages to entertain for the extent of its relatively brief running time and Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale make compelling victims. A twisted story infused with an intense struggle for survival and a subtle yet searing commentary on voyeuristic violence as entertainment creates a thriller definitely worth seeing - but possibly on DVD.

Its not the scariest movie ever, but it will scare the hell out of you. The movie starts out with a couple traveling home after a family gathering. The couple is in the middle of a divorce after the death of a child and their car breaks down with a little help from a creepy mechanic. They have no where to turn so they check in to the creepiest motel EVER. Once there they are bothered by phone calls and knocks on the door and they become nervous. They pop in a movie, provided by the motel, and watch a slasher flick that was filmed in their room! Only- they aren't slashers- they are real life murders taking place on cameras that are set up in the very room they are in. What unfolds is pure terror. This is not a gory film but some of the images on the video tapes are haunting.
  What I enjoyed about this film is how real it felt. The main characters do what any normal person would do. They try to run. They try to fight. They try to hide. They call for help. But they are all alone because it turns out that the motel makes an income on selling these gory tapes to freaks and creeps and everyone is in on it. I haven't given anything away because this all unfolds in the first half hour. It is a very spooky and uncomfortable flick that will make you scream just enough- but it never goes over the top.",1187049600,3,1441,4.1063829787234045

Will the cheesy horror genre ever end? Once again, we are dealing with a so called ""horror"" flick about a lost couple--preferably sexy city people-in the middle of nowhere who are being watched by a bunch of evil guys. Amusingly, this time around, they have sophisticated video surveillance equipment. These foes come in different shapes and forms, but share one thing in common, they want to kill you slowly. This clich genre is so played out that nothing will scare you anymore and unfortunately Vacancy is not an exception.

Story:
A dysfunctional married couple David Fox (Luke Wilson) and his wife Amy (Kate Beckinsale) are taking a nocturnal road trip to see some relatives--apparently they are trying to hide their dying relationship. David decides to take a detour while Amy is asleep--it's not cool to upset her because she is depressed and with a chronic bad mood. They are lost now. As he is driving those dark backroads, a raccoon appears in the middle of the road. He pushes the breaks and off the road they go. Our little raccoon friend is unharmed, but their car seems to have a problem. They are fine, but keep driving anyways until they find an old gas station where the clerk helps him with the car and tells them to follow a specific road. They take off, fight some more, but after few minutes drive, the car breaks down again. Now both are tired and moody. What else is there to do? It's dark and late, so they decide to walk back to the gas station, but it appears empty. There is a motel next to the gas station and they decide to stay there for the night. They are about to experience the worst night of their lives.

Review:
Originality is something the horror genre needs desperately, pure and simple. Vacancy borrows heavily from dozens of other films. It has a promising beginning--the first room scene has potential--but then it jumps to survival mode way too fast and stays that way until the end. The cat and mouse game between the characters is very predictable as well. You don't need to be a movie expert to figure out how the chase is going to end. Clichs aside, neither suspense nor gore are found to keep the audience entertain. Sorry but cheap thrills or a guy chasing you wearing a plastic mask do not count.

Vacancy has 2 good actors. I love Kate Beckinsale in Underworld (who wouldn't) where she is a sexy vampire fighting a wolf army. Unfortunately, in this ""room temperature"" film, she is reduced to a depressed and annoying character that either complains or cries too much. Her acting skills are limited here. On the other hand, Luke Wilson is the one who shines. He is a likable character and the hero of the day. The way he deals with the situation makes me think that he still loves his wife after all the fights and humiliations. It is strange how extreme situations bring people closer.

The Verdict:
Been there done that. Vacancy has a lot from other films but very little suspense and gore to keep the new generation of horror fans happy. Guys wearing masks and fake snuff films are not scary. Even the credits in the film is something to laugh about.",1185667200,2,3119,4.594254937163376

It is one of those situations that you really would not know what to do if it happened to you.  if you like movies like Scream, this is for you -- way better than the similar ""1408"" Great setup, great performances -- I am now such a big fan of Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale is perfect and so much suspense that I was literally shaking hours after the experience.

It stars Luke Wilson and Kate Bekinsale, and that's it. Besides the killers there wasn't anyone else in the whole entire film. They play a unhappily married couple on the verge of a divorce. One night they just so happen to break down and end up at a very disgusting, not to mention, rundown hotel. A hotel I'm quite sure they wished they never would've  checked into. They end up putting in a video tape that shows numerous couples being tortured and brutally murdered by a group of sick individuals who obviously enjoy taping their tirades. Needless to say, in the exact same room they are standing in. Don't get me wrong, it had it's creepy moments, but it left me with too many unanswered questions. Who were these people? What were they getting out of this? I could've understood it better if they were making snuff films for a profit. The million dollar question is.. Why were they doing this to those people? I guess the most obvious reason is they were crazy, but still, an explanation wouldn't have hurt. I mean, every ""real"" slasher or killer has to have a motive and a story behind their insanity in order for me to be interested. It hate it when they just have a psycho running around stalking and killing people, but they don't bother to explain anything, and that's exactly what this movie did.

1. The couple, Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale, are having marital troubles. This is a nice twist on the formulaic ""couple is in love, has sex, gets killed"" theme. You won't find that here.

2. They end up in a really run-down motel run by a truly whacky guy.

3. Things get very frightening and it isn't the usual slasher flick. There are some nice twists and turns here...well, maybe not nice..but definitely riveting.

4. I was surprised several times and screamed my head off. You don't really want me to reveal much more, do you? If you're looking for a horror film, I assume you want to know if you're likely to get scared silly. Based on my reaction, I'd say yes. I also wanted to know how this was going to affect this couple's marriage. I mean, stick two estranged people in a motel with a psycho and see how that changes their perspective...

From the very moment that this couple enters the motel, things go haywire, and the intensity and speed of this movie really pick up, and that is, mind you, virtually from the very beginnnig of this DVD.

Okay, some have said that this movie was to simple in term of plot, but I mean, why complain?  I have seen enough thrillers, that were ruined because the producers tried to make the plot all the more intricate and complicated, by putting too many twists and turns into it, so that in the end those movies wound up being much to far fetched, and unrealistic.

Not so here, since this story could really have happend.  And like pointed out already, here you have a really suspenseful thriller that leaves nothing to be desired.  Perhaps the end was a bit to ""Hollywood"" like (see it and you'll know what I mean), but besides that, this thing really kicks and is a lot of fun to watch, and its not overdone in terms of length either, being around 90 + minutes.

No review should be too long when this movie is the topic because there really isn't much to it. The movie starts with a married couple David (Luke) and Amy (Kate) are driving down a road and realize that they don't exactly know where they are. Their arguing might be the main reason why they are miles away from the road they're suppose to be on.

They pull into a gas station only to find nobody around but then all of a sudden someone comes out of nowhere. Who else would it be but the guy that owns the station and garage or so he says. David and Amy tell him where they are trying to get and asks him for directions but of course he tells them to take this secret road ""sound familiar?"". The guy doesn't let them go until he checks their engine to make sure they can make it to where they're going and sends them on their way.

While driving on the secret road the car brakes down and the closest garage just happens to be the place they just came from. The garage owner is gone but there just happens to be a motel right next to it and David and Amy are stuck there for the night. Once in the motel room strange things start to happen like someone banging on the door from the next room over. What do they do when they find out that there is more to the motel then they thought?

The pros in ""Vacancy"" are basically in the acting because without the good cast this movie would be nothing. The cons are that there are no twists, what you saw in the preview is pretty much what you're getting when you go to the theatre. ""Vacancy"" even bites off of other movies to makes its story. When you find out why what's being done to David and Amy is being done you won't be surprised at all. They do a bad job of foreshadowing and hyping the crowd up for the surprise. It has little suspense and is far from horror. For you scary movie fans seeking a scary or gory movie don't attempt to watch this. If anything ""Vacancy"" is for the lighter scary movie fans or maybe a group of teens that need a movie for Saturday night. It might entertain some but will most likely disappoint most people, for me it was too predictable and simple. It didn't even fall along the lines of a good simple movie.

Putting a videotape into the VCR in the room, David and Amy are treated to home made snuff films that were made in their hotel room.

I would definitely find another place to stay if he was working the front desk at a place I wanted to stay at.

2867029,4,B000RGN2IY,"""Vacancy"" knows what it is and doesn't try to be anything else.  It sets up its simple premise, throws a few thrills and chills your way, and then rushes madly toward its finale.

Kate Beckinsale and Luke Wilson (horribly miscast) play a divorcing couple who break down in the middle of nowhere and decide to stay at a decrepit motel for the night.  They quickly discover that the motel's single purpose is to kill the guests who stay there and videotape the murders.

The action that follows is pretty basic and expected, but the director, Nimrod Antal (now THAT is a name, folks), really knows how to goose his audience with a perfect shock-cut, and uses every element within the frame for maximum anxiety.

The movie is really effective in the beginning, when the couple first realizes its predicament and the frights are so real to us -- the startling sound of someone banging on a door, the dread of knowing you're in a deadly situation, the sinking realization that the rational world you were living in mere hours ago has shattered and left behind something violent and completely illogical.

After this spooky first round, where Beckinsale and Wilson escape death, things get more action-packed, but less scary.

The ending sort of shoots off the charts in silliness, and the final scene is a very weird cap to the movie.

When Luke Wilson and Kate Bekinsale find themselves stranded near the motel as their BMW breaks down, they check into this motel, and obviously become the next victims so it seems. Luke Wilson plays pretty good, ... it's just difficult not to think of his brother Owen when Luke starts talking, ... both seem to talk through the nose quite a bit and they have the same rhythm in their voice.

Needless to say, that the murders are senseless, and overall I would say that the storyline of this film is a bit more tasteful than Hostel was, which was a completely ridiculous and stupid film, but it's a slasher film of the classic low-budget era.

Oops almost gave the ending away. I hate to not be able to say more but I've probably seen it three times over the years.,1517097600,,271,4.132075471698113
