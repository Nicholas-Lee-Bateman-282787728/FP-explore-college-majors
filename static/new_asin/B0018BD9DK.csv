3414782,5,B0018BD9DK,"Of course I like the Dog Whisperer, but I don't get the channel the show is on.  I was thrilled to find this 3rd season at such a good price!  I have the first two years of the series on DVD, and this 3rd year will complement my collection.",1218067200,2,240,3.877551020408163
3414783,5,B0018BD9DK,"Just when we think we've viewed/read/used the best Cesar Millan-Dog Whisperer has to offer......we get even better!  There just is no comparison or equal to Cesar Millan DVDs for a dog owner (dog, since mine comes running when he hears Cesar's voice to watch too). Dog owners who have chosen to give their dogs the 'best' have turned to Cesar Millan for help, and have received a make-over they absolutely love. You just can't get any better than being the ""Pack Leader"" your dog needs to be in balance, happy and healthy without Cesar Millan-Dog Whisperer.

Season 3 is definitely one to add to your Cesar Millan ""Tool Kit"", it's definitely one you will not want to be without. No way to get as good or use again and again and again.  This one is pure ""magic"" and more. Five stars simply doesn't do it for this ten star DVD. What makes it even more helpful is having the "" The Ultimate Episode Guide"" to go with it.

3414784,5,B0018BD9DK,Cesar is much better at explaining why he is doing what he is doing in this season. He just keeps getting better.,1217203200,5,113,4.181818181818182
3414785,5,B0018BD9DK,"You'd think after watching the first two seasons of this show, that I'd begin to anticipate Cesar's dignosis for each set of human/pet combinations he works with, yet I'm still left dumbfounded after each episode, continuously amazed at this man's instinctive understanding of dog/human interaction.

In this 3rd season, Cesar takes to the road and visits a wide variety of locations. The formula remains basically the same, but why fix what isn't broken? If you're a dog lover who enjoyed the first two seasons, there's no reason you shouldn't enjoy the third.

Amidst the sea of garbage television, Dog Whisperer continues to be one of the only shows I enjoy, and certainly one of the only I'll purchase. May there be many more seasons to come.",1217116800,38,746,4.912698412698413
3414786,2,B0018BD9DK,"This show, like season 2, was shot in widescreen format.
If you watch this on a standard 4:3 television, everything will be alright. The image will be letterboxed.
But if you're watching this on a 16:9 widescreen, guess what? You get to watch it ""windowboxed"", meaning black bars will be on all four sides. The studio who released this screwed it up royally. How could this happen? After all this time, you'd think botching video presentation like this would be a thing of the past, but obviously it is not. It's a shame because this is such a good series.
I'm giving it 2 stars because it is still watchable; if you play it back on a screen 50"" or larger you probably can overlook the non-anamorphic picture. You could zoom it out using your screen controls on your television to fill the screen, but it will look pretty bad. You've been warned.",1215561600,14,846,4.5359477124183005

3414797,5,B0018BD9DK,"After watching seasons 1 and 2, I continue to enjoy and learn from Cesar's dog rehabilitation/people training. Although the main principles remain the  same, it is fascinating to watch an expert evaluate new situations and employ the appropriate response. Dogs and people develop more confidence, inner peace, and harmonious communication. Although, already a competent dog trainer when I discovered Cesar Milan; he has dramatically increased my understanding and skills.

As  a spiritual practitioner, I recognize that Cesar  has done a lot of self cultivation. He is  authentic-in touch with his true Self. Just being around or observing such a person is uplifting. If you appreciate Eckhart Tolle , Klaus Hempfling, or similar mentors, I would recommend this video. My daughter  told me that she loves for me to watch ""Dog Whisperer"" (because when I do, I radiate such positive vibes).

The above-mentioned daughter told me that I should add that we used Cesar's methods with our new puppy, Bruno. Our adopted (Rottweiler? Doberman? mix?) quickly became a happy, well-behaved member of the family. What really amazed me, is that by using Cesar's teachings, we were able to teach Bruno  not to eat from the cat's bowl. We leave Dumbledore's dish on the floor with dry food in it, all the time. Bruno knows that he is not allowed to eat this and leaves it alone, whether we are around or not! This was not accomplished through harsh methods. It was achieved by gaining the puppy's respect for us as calm, assertive ""pack leaders"".",1405987200,,1531,5.023715415019763

3414820,5,B0018BD9DK,"Ok, here we are.  Another episode of The Dog Whisperer and once again, Cesar Millan is off to do his magic to help troubled dogs and their owners.  Over the seasons, the show has had the Dog Whisperer visiting other parts of the country, delivering help wherever he is needed.  This time around, he stays close to home.

First, he visits the home of Bo Istrate and Julie Souders in the high desert of California.  The two aerospace engineers are having trouble with their aggressive Rottweiler, Titan.  The couple rescued the 120 lbs. Rottweiler from a shelter.  Ever since, he has shown aggression towards visitors coming to the house.  Cesar invites Titan to the Dog Psychology Center.  He also enrolls the overweight Rottweiler in a sheep herding class.

Next, Cesar visits the home of TV personality ""Downtown"" Julie Brown and her beautiful daughter, Gianna Schuermann.  Gianna's dog, Candy, is very aggressive towards her and also quite possessive of Julie.  Cesar shows the young teenager how to administer correction whenever Candy, a Yorkshire, exhibits aggression.  It seems Gianna was always hesitant to correct Candy for fear that she could hurt the tiny dog.  Julie also receives some training from Cesar.  Gianna and Cesar take Candy for a walk.

The last case involved a rescued terrier mix named Bella.  Actor Michael Damian and his wife Janine are worried because the dog continually harasses their cat.  Wanting better living conditions for their cat, the Damians called on the Dog Whisperer for help.  Within minutes, Cesar notices that it was the cat who initiated the hostility.  He demonstrated to Michael and Janine the proper way to correct the unwanted hostile behavior from both animals.  The Damians, Cesar, and both animals then go on a walk together to establish trust.

I am always in awe of Cesar Millan.  Technique is secondary.  His techniques work because he understands dogs, and apparently cats, very well.  He knows right away when an unwanted behavior is about to happen, and ""nips it in the bud"" before it escalates.  Actually, he prevents unwanted behavior from taking place in some cases.  He knows their body language and can read it with great accuracy.  Being a pack leader is not all that easy when you do not understand dog body language.  Most of us can never hope to understand, to communicate with, and to manage dogs the way Cesar does.  But we owe it to our dogs to make the effort each and every day.  All in all, another great episode of The Dog Whisperer.",1356393600,,2508,4.858156028368795

3414824,5,B0018BD9DK,"My first words in this review are: Thank you, Cesar! Thank you for motivating us to become more understanding towards our best friends, our dogs! You make it look so simple, yet, strange enough, that is exactly what we seem to be needing: to be shown that in a time where our ever-busy heads have taken over our lives, the heart and the good old gut feeling have a voice, too! So thank you, also, for making us see where we can improve ourselves, not only in order to become better dog owners, but also to become better and more balanced people.

I have watched season 1, 2, 3 and am currently into season 4, volume 1 and all I can say is that I just don't tire of watching Cesar doing his ""magic"" with dogs and people - and this in his honest, open, yet respectful, charming and uncomplicated manner that just makes you love his way. I get very much out of this series (insight, laughter, tears, knowledge, understanding, empathy, goosepimples...) which is why I consider it my absolute favourite! There is so much inspiration in it, which is why I highly recommend it to anyone interested in dogs and people :)!

I have always enjoyed watching his programs and find him easy to understand. I think he inspires all dog owners to be more involved with their dogs, and provides practical examples of how dog owners can better teach their dogs.

So we purchased Cesar Millan's DVD set about how to deal with aggressive dogs. Within two days of watching these DVD's, our little guy was behaving 200% better than he was at the beginning. We have now had him for two months and happily report he no longer ants to bite, gets along very well with our other dogs and is a loving little guy that just needed some TLC and proper training.",1323907200,2,669,4.275590551181103

3414829,5,B0018BD9DK,"Cesar Milan is a true Guru, his knowledge and experience is explained in his own words and actions, there is no pretence, just good solid advice most of which, if applied with care, can be accomplished by an amateur although some techniques shouldn't be tried without advice or by a professional, this is clearly stated where it is applicable and if you don't feel confident in applying these methods, again you should call in some-one who is, but I would check first that that person is sympathetic to the `Dog Whisperer' and his methods, simply because they work and they are sustainable without unnecessary apparatus or cruelty.

Cesar Milan is not going to teach you how to train your dog to sit and stay, he is dealing with dogs that, through no fault of their own, have gone beyond everyday acceptable behaviour and turned into various sized monsters with issues and phobias. Without exception, these animals have been brought back to be useful loving pets and working dogs, and he will show you how this was achieved.

A truly miraculous transformation can be attained with kindness and hard work.
I am honestly in awe of this man and his work and the videos in these series are a real testament to his ability. I have owned and trained Rottweilers for over 40 years

Me and my dog Mr. Schroeder (12 years old, from a dog shelter) had had lessons with three Dog-Trainers for two years, but nothing really helps, until I discovered what Cesar did, how he is treating and teaching a dog and showed the owners to do it right. And what a surprise. My little pug-mix-berserk became a pug-mix. I continue practicing Cesars teachings and every day it's going better and better. No fightings any longer, no barking. We are just on the walk. Even the other dog owners in our neigbourhood realized, that something is going on with Mr. Schroeder - something good. We can meet other dogs, they enjoy each other. Last week Mr. Schroeder helps to catch another dog that was all alone in the street and was completely lost, anxious and bit everyone who wants to touch him. We calmed him down until the people from the shelter came to pick him up. The same evening, the owners were found and this dog went back to his owners. Very lucky little guy. I was very proud of Mr. Schroeder.

I can only say: It works. I hope that very soon we will have the show to be seen on German television (translated into German), so that more people can benefit from Cesar's teachings. This would be very useful. Or much better: Cesar will show up in Germany for a big tour. I want to be the first one to shake hands with him and say THANK YOU, CESAR.

What continues to fascinate viewers are the variety of dog owners and how rehabilitating the owners is often the most crucial step towards balanced dogs and owners!  This season has improved over the first two seasons because the venues are different and more interesting (not just the L.A. area), there are more interesting, complex case studies, and Cesar seems to be learning more and increasingly being more intuitive, often imitating his trusty pitbull, Daddy, and continues to make use of the Dog Psychology centre.

3414844,5,B0018BD9DK,"Before watching Cesar, I had no idea how to train a dog. I used to have cats for many years and thought that if you just give tons of love and affection to your pets that they would return the love and respect. Now, after having owned my first dog for 3 weeks, and after watching Cesar for 2 months, I can understand how crucial it is to establish leadership when you have a dog. My dog is a shepherd mix and a shelter dog, so very stubborn and pushes the limit as much as she can. If am not firm with her, I know that we would not have enjoyed her as much as we do. It's still going to require much time, training for me and my dog, but to start on the right foot is a big help!",1233446400,3,679,3.8226950354609928

3414848,5,B0018BD9DK,"I've been a fan of Cesar for a number of years and found that this season, he gets more in depth as to the subtle sign that dogs give as indicaters or warnings.  The DVD is great for getting a second or third look at the different scenarios.  For people with dogs and people who just love them, Cesar is a MUST!  He is informative, humorous, and warm.  His way with dogs is unmatched and his way with poor dog owners is as enlightening as it is humorous.  These people really do need help!",1226966400,5,489,4.159574468085107
3414849,5,B0018BD9DK,"After watching Season 1 and Season 2 of the ""Dog Whisperer"" I became a big fan and had to purchase Season 3 for myself. It arrived in good condition in a timely fashion and every disc played without a problem. The set consists of 6 DVDs (the 6th is mainly ""filler"" and could have been left out).  It is marvelous to watch him in action - he truly loves what he does and approaches each situation without any preconceived biases.  I enjoyed watching him travel to different parts of the country and participate in the lives of the people.  He delivers his truth: ""Dog is an animal not a human"" with gentleness and respect.  I also appreciate how he sometimes makes it a family affair by including his wife and son to help with the rehabilitation of the animals. I see many people walking their dogs and it is often obvious which one is the the ""real"" pack leader.  Ceasar""s videos should be required viewing for anyone who is thinking about getting a dog.",1225152000,3,954,4.459770114942529

3414851,5,B0018BD9DK,"With his super-hero theme playing of over footage of Cesar Millan racing to an emergency call, yet another Dog Whisperer episode begins.  In Season Three, Cesar has ditched the fire-engine red Jeep for a more upscale ride. I miss the Jeep.  It was so Cesar.

Far from settling into an easy routine of formulaic shows, Dog Whisperer continues to turn out fresh, well-crafted, rewarding, highly entertaining episodes.

This series seemingly could go on forever.  The material is endlessly fascinating. I'm still a little confused as to when to invoke the ""no touch, no talk, no eye contact"" guideline. Sometimes Cesar makes eye contact with a canine client without explaining why it's OK this time but not others. I would like him to clarify this, perhaps as a bonus feature.

I would also like to see a guide to episodes so viewers can quickly access segments by subject matter.  Cesar's website has capsules of some, but oddly not all, segments.

Molly the Tire Biter
This is one of the best segments because we see Cesar's joy at returning to this farming roots.  He's accompanied by the handsome pit bull Daddy, a confirmed city slicker. The farm is a beautiful spread outside Omaha. At one point Cesar is invited to pilot a combine (mammoth harvester), and Cesar gushes, ""This is better than Hawaii!""

The segment is the origin of the Yee-haw! Cesar delivers from the driver's seat of a tractor during the Dog Whisperer opening sequence.

The farm's working dog Molly, a Blue Heeler, has developed a dangerous tire-bite fixation.  The farmer and his comely daughter have tried an e-collar without success.  An e-collar delivers a humane stimulus to deter unwanted behavior.

Cesar diplomatically refrains from comment as he listens to the farmer's flimsy excuse for not sticking with the e-collar.  It was the wrong size. What about exchanging it?  Duh!

Every episode is a major production.  They bend over backward to pack each segment with visual description and content interspersed with Cesar's thoughtful mini-lectures on dog psychology.  The biker dog segment is a good example. Holli the American Staffordshire Terrier is hit by a school bus.  We see shots inside the bus with booted feet slamming on the brakes cut with a dog's eye view of the blinking stop signs.  There are shots of the animal hospital, instruments, dog surgery.  The veterinary surgeon is interviewed.  It all appears effortless, but these touches make Dog Whisperer stand far above typical reality shows.

I didn't appreciate how much went into the segment until I replayed it to listen again to Cesar's dissertation on Zen and the art of driving a motorcycle.  You have to hear it twice to get where he's coming from.  While Cesar delivers it, biker-gal Renee gives Cesar the most comically-perplexed look. It's a clue to Cesar's abstract thought process.  His approach involves symbols and imagery as much as practical stuff like collars, leashes, or treadmills.

He launches into the motorcycle monologue after saying he doesn't know anything about motorcycles! Understated humor is one of the show's hallmarks.  Fans of the Marx Brothers will appreciate the sly reference to the movie ""Cocoanuts"" in the segment featuring Marley & Me author John Grogan. Cesar visits Grogan's magnificent country estate outside Philadelphia.

If Dog Whisperer were only about the Town & Country crowd, it wouldn't be so compelling. The Dog Whisperer crew can be depended on to produce shows with profoundly human themes.  One segment shows Cesar's work with United Hope for Animals, a rescue organization that serves Tijuana, Mexico.  In an especially compelling segment, Cesar teaches a young disabled woman how to walk her dogs, bringing enrichment to her ""cumbersome"" life.  I enjoy these segments the most because they show human and animal nature at their best.

Though he did his best to hide it, I think Cesar was creeped out a little by the lady with the pink fetish who even dyed her dog pink.  She greeted Cesar in a flimsy pink negligee.  For my part I was creeped out some by the gent who goes commando in loose lounging shorts (walkin' the dinosaur).  I'm surprised no one from the show thought to tell him, ""Dude, you're going on nationwide TV. Put on some underwear.""

I don't have a dog but I have benefited from Cesar's teachings. In Episode 2, Cesar uses a tennis racket to control an aggressive Blue Heeler.  In my canvassing rounds for Senator Obama, I was able to use my clipboard in a similar fashion to ward off charging neighborhood dogs.  Thanks, Cesar.  One of Barack's strengths, incidentally, is calm-assertive energy.

There was the time I parked near two dogs (one a pit bull) tied to a parking meter.  I could tell from their energy that they were balanced dogs, so I wasn't concerned about passing near them.

Even though the dogs showed no alarming signs, two young women fearfully tried to sidle past as if the dogs might attack.  ""They're OK,"" I told them, and bent to pet them.  The dogs responded as nice as you please. One of the women joined me in giving affection while the other hung back.  She seemed a little less terrified, however.

I'm sure Cesar disapproves of approaching any dog stranger, but he has created a monster. There are probably lots of dog whisperer wannabes like me who think they can judge a dog's energy.

I guess Dog Whisperer has been nominated for an Emmy Award.  I tried watching a recent Emmy telecast.  It was an embarrassing trainwreck.  The Dog Whisperer certainly deserves an award, but I'm not sure the Emmy is worthy.",1223510400,22,5560,4.898286937901499
