I had already bought Shannon Miller's DVD for during pregnancy and loved it, so I decided to give this one a shot.  It did not disappoint me.  Great video!  I would recommend this DVD to any mom after having a baby to get back in shape.",1351728000,,310,3.873015873015873
7901674,5,9363860868,"First I should say that I was completely skeptical to order a workout DVD since I never use them more than once when I usually order them.  But since this one was endorsed by my youth idol and it was specific to losing baby weight & getting the post-baby body back, I decided to give it a shot.  Not only are these workouts fun, but they challenge me in a way that I can feel that I am getting a workout, but not overwhelmed with steps and strain.  My heart rate is elevated and I am challenged, and enjoy the trainer and Shannon (who are neither annoying or overly smiley like in most DVDs).  I highly recommend this for a postpartum woman.  Actually, I recommend it to anyone who wants a fun & quick workout.  I will use it well after I get my pre-baby body back.

Oh!!! I do want to mention that you should have some 3 pound (or similar) weights and an exercise ball if you are going to use this DVD. It wasn't mentioned anywhere in the description.",1343260800,2,952,4.197802197802198
7901675,5,9363860868,"I kept up with Shannon's Fit Pregnancy Video throughout my pregnancy and loved it! So of course after my son was born and I wanted my old body back, I turned to Shannon! She's so encouraging and easy to work out with! I loved it! Getting my old body back wasn't as hard as I thought it was going to be! I really recommend this video!",1328140800,,333,4.0606060606060606
