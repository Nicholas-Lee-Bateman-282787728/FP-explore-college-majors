8260882,5,B001652FME,Really fun and somewhat challenging fast-paced routine with good practice options on DVD.  DVD is chaptered and full practice sequence without instruction is available as one pick.  Or you can do the technique-learning pieces one-by-one.  Just wish they would consistently show Jillina's feet & legs.,1510272000,,300,5.622222222222222
8260883,5,B001652FME,This is a great video.  The run time is long so please take your time with this video.  The technique parts are great.  Jillina breaks out the technique and she does it with you in a practice set.  Then she takes all the single moves (8) on this DVD and strings them together in combos- BOOM there is your dance.  I never knew what a Saidi hip drop was until I watched this video and I've been dancing for a long time!,1430784000,,418,4.048780487804878

8260885,4,B001652FME,"When one reviews the moves on the CD, the names of the moves are labeled as Egyptian this and Egyptian that. I was expecting Lebanese moves both oriental and possibly folkloric...though I do understand the history and how the styles are related.",1386288000,,245,4.857142857142857
8260886,5,B001652FME,"This DVD is near-perfection, offering a wealth of ideas for the advanced dancer.  (Beginner and intermediate dancers can benefit from the technique section--and who better to learn technique from than Jillina!--but  the speed and complexity of the moves in the rest of this DVD will challenge even highly-skilled dancers.)  She generously shares 7 jam-packed combinations, and then she strings the combinations together into a Lebanese pop routine.  If that wasn't enough, she then shows you a few variations on these combos!  This is what I picture a dance seminar or private lesson with Jillina being like.  Be prepared to sweat, take notes, hit ""rewind"" a lot, put your thinking cap on and check out this DVD--it's one of the best available that I've seen for higher-level dancers! There's a lot of beginner/intermediate level stuff out there, but this DVD will put you through your paces and take your dancing up a notch!",1375315200,3,925,5.052631578947368
