This video does not go the best route - it translates line by line - singing first French, then the English translation or vice versa. And the translation is not even exact. Please avoid translation when teaching children a new language.  The music is mostly poor as well. I do like that it is all real people, not cartoons. I also like that there are captions. But there's no way I'd choose this video with so many better options in this day and age. It's not even high enough quality to fit on a wide screen (there is gray on either side). I have no doubt that young kids or kids who love learning will be fine with this video but time is limited and resources are limited so I would definitely buy something else.",1500508800,,816,4.403973509933775
7796083,5,1560153253,"This is the only decent French video I have found for my daughter. We bought it when she was about 1 but it's only since she was two that she really started watching it regularly and loving it. Now, at 3, she knows all the songs, sings them and requests the video over and over again. Last week we were visiting the Santa Monica Pier and my daughter pointed to the beach and said ""J'aime la Plage"" (one of the songs) and then started singing the entire song in French. The others we have bought were awful (see my other reviews) but this one has really taught my daughter some French. Adults, however, will find it cheesy and somewhat annoying but no worse than putting up with Barney and Caillou : )  I highly recommend this video.",1136073600,5,732,4.343065693430657
7796084,5,1560153253,"I am the mom of a nineteen month old to whom I speak my mother tongue - French - everyday. He is learning so fast that I just can't keep up with him. I have been looking for so long for more French videos. I am just so happy I came accross this one at the library, now I have to have it! The songs are great and in tune.  The pronunciation is perfect, and the topics are varied. We learn the vocabulary of animals at the zoo, the beach, the alphabet, the weather, the seasons, the days of the week... etc.  In addition, it couples French and English which also makes daddy happy!!! Love it!!!",1100131200,4,592,4.094827586206897
7796085,5,1560153253,"This entertaining bilingual video is recommended for children who really want to learn French if they've heard of French.  Even kindergarteners will tolerate this video.  Throughout the video, children sing 11 songs in English and French and the lyrics are subtitled at the bottom of the screen.  This and all other Lyric Language videos contain the songs:
* At the Zoo * At the Beach * At the Supermarket * Happy Birthday to You * The Rain * The Seasons * The Days of the Week * The Night
* The Alphabet * I Wish I Could Fly * Jump Rope",980812800,31,537,4.297029702970297
