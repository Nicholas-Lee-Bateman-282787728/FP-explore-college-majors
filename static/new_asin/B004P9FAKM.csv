4444053,5,B004P9FAKM,"My girls, 2 and 4, love Mickey Mouse clubhouse so naturally they love this disc. The icing on the cake was that my 4 year old is super into camping right now, and this disc includes all outdoor episodes including a camping themed one. My only ""issue"" is that I cannot seem to get to the main menu quickly, I have to skip several previews/ads to get to it.",1308096000,8,355,4.159420289855072
4444054,4,B004P9FAKM,"My boys love Mickey Mouse Clubhouse and this new DVD set ""Mickey Mouse Clubhouse:  Mickey's Great Outdoors"" is perfect to get them ready for summer.  It includes five episodes (one of which has never been on tv) that all involve playing outside!  The set includes the regular DVD, a Digital DVD to put the episodes on you computer or portable device (iPod etc...), and the Mickey Mote.  The Mickey Mote is a kid-sized red Mickey Mouse shaped remote with four colored buttons.  Setting it up is easy as you just aim your regular DVD remote at the Mickey Mote and push the buttons to correspond.  You can then watch the episodes in regular mode or Discovery Mode where your child can interact to answer questions.

I tried setting up the Mickey Mote with my two DVD players but couldn't get all the buttons to work, so we ended up using our regular DVD remote (you use the Up, Down, Left, and Right buttons only.)  My son would answer the questions and I'd push the button he told me.  It is a great way to break up tv watching and get kids involved and I am sure with some extra trying I can get the Mickey Mote set up but my boys would not let it go!  So while the Mickey Mote is a great idea, you can use your regular DVD remote or there is a Auto Play mode which allows the questions to pop up and answer without using a remote.  I will say the episodes had a good amount of questions and they were easy enough in Level 1 (there are two levels) for my 4 year old to answer.  He was very excited as he thought it was a game! .

Mom and More Disclosure: I was sent this DVD to review in exchange for my honest opinion.",1306713600,31,1618,4.163987138263666
4444055,5,B004P9FAKM,"My daughter and my son absolutely loves this movie. For me, the Disney Fastpass feature is the best, as it will auto-play your movie. If your kids are a fan of Mickey and the gang, or Disney in general, this is a good purchase. It is a typical Mickey Mouse Clubhouse movie, with some extras thrown in.",1474329600,,301,4.298245614035087

4444063,2,B004P9FAKM,"My 2yo loves Mickey Mouse clubhouse. So, I bought her this DVD.  I like it because it has several episodes that can be played alone (so you can play only one at a time) or you can just let it play the whole way, which is great for a long car trip when Mommy can't stop every half hour to tinker with the DVD player.
What I REALLY DON'T like: In one episode, Minnie, Daisy etc go into the jungle to find a friend for their goldfish in the bowl. They find several ""friends"" at the base of a waterfall: a hippo, a seal, and another goldfish.  The three new ""friends"" wont' fit into the goldfish bowl.  So they RELEASE THEIR GOLDFISH into the wild.  We have so many problems with invasive species across the United States.  Not to mention that pets often are not equipped to fend for themselves in the wild or that habitat might not be hospitable for a released pet.  I do not want my two year old watching programs that make it appear appropriate to do something potentially very harmful to the environment or a pet.  She is not old enough to have a conversation about why this is not a good thing to do.  I could tell from the very beginning of the episode tha the other alternative was going to be capturing a ""friend"" from the wild - also not an idea I want to promote.
So, the rest of the episodes that I have watched, and most importantly the format of the DVD and the fact that my kid likes it, get 4 stars. the terrible moral gets 1 star.  so I figure it averages to two.",1461283200,,1475,4.147368421052631

4444131,5,B004P9FAKM,"These are episodes from the Disney Jr. Channel show Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. Each episode runs about 20 min long (5 episode included on this DVD) Each episode consists of an overall challenge (ie, go camping to get a ""clubhouse camping badge"") and 3 to 4 ""mini-challenges"" (ie. Get to campground, set up tents, catch a gooey fish) that are solved with the aid of ""mouske-tools"" that are chosen from ""Toodles"", the mouse-ear shaped character who flies into the screen when you call his name. The show's simple teachings on color, numbers, shapes, adding, subtracting, and cause and effect are perfect for toddlers to preschoolers. My 3 year old is obsessed with Mickey Mouse and his friends. The songs are cute, but I will admit to an annoyance with a few (especially the song sung at the end of every episode -hot dog hot dog, hot diggity dog. *insert shudder and eye roll here*).

Much to our surprise, there is no easy way to put the content the DVDs on his Android tablet.... it will only allow you to copy the product to I-devices (must use iTunes), or devices with windows media player installed.  He is turning 3 soon, and I just can't justify purchasing anything other than an inexpensive tablet.  This thing comes with a onetime use download code and some copy protection hocus-pocus that does funky crap to you computer and storage devices.....

I understand why Disney wants to protect their intellectual property, but, they need to remember that the people purchasing the DVDs are trying to do it the right way or they would have just downloaded it via some pirate site in the first place.....so my advice to any Android customers is don't buy this DVD.  I know my saying this will have little or no effect on the empire that is Disney, but, if I save one other person some grief, it will be worth it.",1419724800,16,1044,4.616216216216216

Although our Mickey Mote didn't work, I was able to ""sync"" it to our personal DVD remote and use the interactive option that way. Be warned that of the 5 episodes on the DVD, only the first episode has the interactive option. However, the product is still a good value considering you get 5 episodes (whereas with other children's compilations it's usually 4) AND the digital copy.

So first things first, have you signed up for Disney Movie Rewards? Go sign up disneymovierewards.com and then everytime you buy a disney movie you enter in the code and get points to spend on free stuff, like more movies, gifts, sticker books, lots of fun stuff. Ive gotten lunchboxes etc, - thats not the point, and I don't get points if you sign up, I just think if your checking out disney cartoons you should know.  I buy these for car trips for the car. They always have a positive theme, and I love that toodles helps them figure out problem solving.
Im so much happier with the disney family of movies than say - Spongebob, no fart jokes, its just all age appropriate sharing, working together, solving problems, etc, no one is getting kidnapped, hurt, manipulated, etc.",1351987200,,898,4.577639751552795

My four year old was very excited about getting the Mickey Mote. I am less excited about it. First of all, the remote did not work with our rechargeable batteries - we had to purchase new regular batteries to get it to work. Programming was fine. But what is really frustrating is that there is apparently no way to select what episode to play after you choose ""Discovery Mode"" which lets you use the Mickey Mote. This is so frustrating! If he wants to do ""Daisy In The Sky"" in Discovery Mode there IS NO WAY to choose it. It seems to just randomly choose an episode and if you try to skip through it to get to the next one you just end up starting over. Did they even test this thing before putting it on the market?
