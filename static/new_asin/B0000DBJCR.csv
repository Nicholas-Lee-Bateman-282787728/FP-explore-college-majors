8000334,1,B0000DBJCR,What the heck this is suppose to be a guided relaxation. There is only 14 minutes of a anorexic looking man babbling about how you should eat.  You have something wrong here,1363824000,2,173,4.40625
8000335,2,B0000DBJCR,"Needed a dvd that is soothing and relaxing, it talks about letting go from your stressful day, ect. Just music and scenery would be nice and positive breathing and techniques to relax, does not do this.",1320969600,,202,4.638888888888889
8000336,1,B0000DBJCR,"This DVD is very misleading.

While the short yoga sequence is great, the ""guided"" portion is obvious advice (""planning ahead can reduce stress"") given overvoice while pretty pictures of waterfalls, etc, are shown. There is nothing guided about it.

Personally, if I want facts, I'll get a book, so the nutrition part was a non-starter.

The idea of a guided relaxation sequenced should be talking you through how to relax at that moment. This does not do that at all.",1152316800,20,468,4.825
8000337,2,B0000DBJCR,"In this companion video to GUIDED RELAXATION FOR SLEEP, Dr. James Rouse is back to provide a new series of techniques that will help to reduce stress. Also included are the segments ""Foods for Stress"" and ""Stress-Balancing Meal Plan,"" which introduce to viewers the foods that best help the body to manage stress.",1100304000,3,313,4.9245283018867925
