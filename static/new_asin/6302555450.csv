They seem to be quite thick  headed about it, but in the end, they finally understand that this is and  should be a life or death struggle to maintain the purity and sanctity of  the land on our Mother the Earth, as Arthur, the character portrayed  passionately by Graham Green, takes it to be.",911606400,3,563,4.704081632653061
480472,5,6302555450,"Clearcut is an intense movie, and does have a point, although many don't seem to get it. Another reviewer is right- it's not all ""feel-good"" or New Agey. It has a very strong message.

Lawyer: ""Violence never changed anything""

Arthur: ""Now, just who are you lying to?""

I suspect this movie disturbed a lot of people, namely greedy executives. They probably don't want anyone getting ideas, like kidnapping them, showing them what they are really doing, and holding them accountable.  Some will really relish this confrontation regardless of the violent method Arthur uses to open the eyes of the lawyer, the executive and several others.

Arthur seems to be a flesh-and-blood manifestation of the land itself, who appears first in the form of a little girl. After he feels he has gotten through to the lawyer at the end of a long fight that ends up in a lake, Arthur grins and steps back into the water, allowing himslef to sink down to the bottom. This imagery mirrors the beginning of the film, when the camera rises from the depths of the same lake.

Arthur detaches from the combat when he is certain that the lawyer has lived a little bit of the reality that the land is going through as a result of the greedy executive type. He believes that he has fueled he lawyer enough that he will not compromise and take things sitting down anymore.

This is a thought-provoking, moving film that is definitely worth seeing for its symbolism that cuts to the core of life on Earth today- what's really happening.

Graham Greene pulled off an excellent performance as Arthur in what must be his most extreme role to date.  This needs to be available on DVD!",1254182400,2,1654,4.6563573883161515

480474,5,6302555450,"I'm NOT Indian, but I agree completely with baylor in the previous review.

This is a very good film...I own it...watch it maybe once a year - and NOT at bedtime - because I am tired of all the feel-good films and this expresses very well the anger and feeling of helplessness that goes with disenfranchisement.

The characters are true to themselves so have to be admired, even if you don't like them...and in some indefinable way, they all ""grow"" too.",1178409600,,453,4.580246913580247
480475,4,6302555450,"It has been a while since I viewed this movie but I do recall that I found the role of Arthur an interesting turn for Graham Greene. Most of the exposure I had of him to that point was his role in Dances with Wolves, Maverick and his occasional appearance on the Red Green Show as the bumbling explosives ""expert"". I appreciated seeing him in a role where he isn't portrayed as the nice guy or ""Noble Savage"" (for lack of a better term). I thought the story was solid enough and I'll admit I was shocked to see Mr. Greene commit the acts of violence (the finger removal scene was unexpected). I think it is a must see for fans of Graham Greene.",1142553600,,644,4.201612903225806
480476,5,6302555450,This movie was as it states clearcut. The whole basis of this movie is to make aware what is happening every day to our forests and how our fine Government steps all over the first peoples. How money is more important than our very future. If you caught the end you notice that Arthur disappears into the water which leads me to know that he was in fact a spirit of the tree peoples. I loved the movie.,1135123200,2,402,4.166666666666667
480477,3,6302555450,"The film is about average in most regards; the plot is somewhat predictable but not painfully so. Greene gives a fair performance, but the film's style is anything but innovative. All in all, this would be worth a rental if you're a Graham Greene fan.

One more thing... Clearcut portrays Red Rock, Ontario as a backwater reservation where people live in squalid conditions. Having lived there for most of my life I must say nothing could be further from the truth. It's an average, sleepy little suburb town the subsistence of which depends on the paper mill in question. The majority of the people there are middle class laborers.",1094515200,,632,4.798165137614679
480478,4,6302555450,"I didn't ""like"" this movie, but I respect it for taking a serious problem (corporate destruction of the environment) and using it to tell a story about one man's love-hate relationship to the problem; he both mourns the lost beauty of nature, and profits from it. Does that remind you of anyone?
This is told with great authenticity and integrity to the Native point of view; ""Clearcut"" is one of the first, best examples of Indian filmmaking, and it's great to see Native attitudes, values, humor, suffering and wisdom depicted after all those decades of Hollywood shoot-'em-ups.
The Indians in this movie are smart, funny, PO'd and in charge. Hee-yah!
Yes, the film is shocking and has some gruesome scenes. Yes, it's sometimes hard to understand; you have to pay close attention, or watch it more than once. The character of Arthur, superbly played by Graham Greene, is a conjuring of the White lawyer's own contradictory impulses; he wants revenge, and Arthur gives it to him, but then the lawyer doesn't like the revenge he's summoned up. The key scene takes place in a sweat lodge; Arthur is a submerged spirit the lawyer sees in a vision, and having once called him up, he cannot keep the tragedy from unfolding, any more than the ancient Greeks could.
Beware of entertaining the Trickster. He's likely to turn around and trick YOU.
Besides the gory scene of the papermill owner being ""debarked"" (that is, skinned alive), the film's biggest weakness is that it is a melodrama; this is not, as some have said, a character study. Cliches abound here; we learn nothing of the lawyer's history or personality. He's simply a type -- just as the thieving industrialist is. The title of the film works on two levels; not only is the forest clear cut, so is everything else here, the characters, the value systems, the issues. But that makes the story easier to follow. We know whom to root for, the Indians and the trees.
The cinematography is, as advertised, spectacular, but so are the details of the set decoration, especially in the wise old man's shack on the reservation. He's got pipes but no running water, despite the ""improvements"" the government promised when it appropriated his land and settled him on the res.
I was privileged to watch this movie with a two-spirited Apache who draws great strength from this film. On the day I wrote this, ""Clearcut"" was Amazon's #6 bestseller in a town in the Canadian Northwest; that says something important. If the Whites don't always get it, the Natives seem to. Maybe the most important message here is that Graham Greene's become a bona fide star in the world's most glamourous medium, decades after Hollywood told us the Indians were all justly annihilated. I guess the Trickster bites Hollywood, too.++",1023062400,30,2759,4.835095137420719
480479,2,6302555450,"I enjoyed the movie, but I found the depiction of Greene's character disturbing. He was reduced to a violent savage, and the white lawyer ends up the hero in the end. Does this stereotype really need a reprise?

480480,1,6302555450,"I bought Clearcut because it features Graham Greene, who has done so well in other movies such as Dances With Wolves and Thunderheart. Unfortunately, Greene didn't perform well and the script was awful. The violence depicted in the movie had no point, and the environmental isses that supposedly led to the violence were not resolved. The basic message is: Don't bother watching this movie.",1000684800,7,390,5.109375
480481,5,6302555450,"Each Time I see this movie I think that is how it should be done as people just don't want to listen, corporate profits and the loss of Our Sacred areas is a very important matter. What will be left for Our children....",991353600,7,219,4.116279069767442
480518,5,6302555450,"As an Indian, i find some of the other reviews here a bit perplexing, so let me see if i can explain why. i do *not* think this is a movie about logging, the environment or silly New Age slogans such as ""raping Mother Earth"". Yeah, there's a forest, a white logger and an Indian, but i don't think that's the point of the movie. It most certainly is *not* an environmental statement - there's no kind, gentle, Hollywood, New Age ""love Mother Earth"" stuff here. It's a much more serious, psychological and sociological profile completely lacking in good guys, kind of like an Indian version of ""Falling Down"" or maybe ""Resevoir Dogs""
The Plot: Arthur, who doesn't want *his* forest cut down (i don't think there's any global environmental statement), but, unlike in other movies, he doesn't decide to show the mysteries of the forest to the logging company, call upon the ""good"" Whites for help, ask the courts to decide, stage a protest, write a newspaper article or talk to young, environmentally-concious kids who ""get it"". Instead, he kidnaps the president of the logging company and tortures him. It's nasty too (this movie is not for the squeamish). That's pretty much the movie
This ain't Disney. There is no clear good guy, no obvious message, no feel good ending. It's not a movie that's easy to understand, explain or summarize. If you're White, you might feel sickened, insulted, confused or scared (in my interpretation, it's not Indian vs. logging company, it's Indian vs. Whites in general, or at the very least Whites who don't get it, which includes those who think they do). If you're Indian, well, it's a violent movie but it is a little hard not to sympathize with Arthur.
If i had to say what the core themes of the movie were (and i'm completely guessing here), i'd say that they are: 1. How frustrated some (many?) Indians are with how Whites act (as in ""let's kidnap and torture them"", not ""let's protest and talk of peace and love"") and  2. How talking doesn't really work (to say ""you're raping mother earth"" are just words and tremendously fail to express the true depth of feelings of point #1)
So why i'd give it a 5? i guess it's (a little) like Schindler's List, Three Kings, Being John Malkovich and those other movies that are heavy message, character studies more than they are plot-driven or feel good movies. It's a movie that causes a lot of people to stop and think. It's good for starting conversations, pondering, introspection or getting a reality check. It's a powerful movie. But i honestly don't know how to explain it",991094400,45,2560,4.688888888888889
480519,4,6302555450,"One criticism I've heard levied at this film, surprisingly absent on this site, is that the depiction of Arthur as an almost homicidally violent man could shift public sympathies AWAY from Native American causes or the environmental movement. That's a fair criticism, but fails to understand that Arthur, as someone else pointed out here, is really only an extension of the frustrations of the white lawyer, whose building sense of injustice summons Arthur up... That's a brilliant insight, and as transparent a filmic comment on the notion of the ""imaginary Indian"" as one could ask for. Arthur's decent into the waters near the end of the movie is a perfect visual metaphor for violence and hatred submerging once more into the subconscious, from whence it arose (a slasher movie motif, really -- the ""killer"" always can return, even when apparently dead). The filmmakers are clearly aware of what they're doing, and make it as obvious as possible that such aspects of the film should be read symbolically. That all makes for some very interesting viewing. Greene's performance is top-notch, as well. This is, however, a thinking-person's movie -- viewers hoping to be passively entertained may at various points get their rocks off on the brutality herein, but will probably be left wondering what the point of it all is.
Oh: until such a time as an SP version of the movie is made available, I'd suggest shopping for a used copy...",989193600,4,1435,4.95850622406639
480520,4,6302555450,"This film is a shattering experience, and must be seen more than once to appreciate the mystical overtones within it. Graham Greene is fantastic as Arthur, a Native man who has had enough of white greed destroying his peoples' land and who decides to make someone pay. The true identity of Arthur and his origins become clearer after the second viewing. To me he was a deeply spiritual avenging spirit called up by the anger of the white lawyer who tried to defend the Natives against the logging industry. Be warned that there are a few scenes of graphic violence not meant for the faint-hearted, but this film is a must-see for anyone who is outraged at the rape and plundering of the earth by white industry, whether it be in Canada or the States or the equatorial rainforests. It is also an amazing and powerful performance by Graham Greene, who manages to convey both outrage and fierce determination while keeping an ironic sense of humor throughout. I highly recommend this film to anyone who is either an environmentalist or a Graham Greene fan..or both!",987638400,5,1062,4.745945945945946

The anglo  saxon/european settlers destroyed everything in their path in the name of  progress, and their decendants are still destroying the environment today.  First, it was the Native Americans/Canadians and the land, and now the  forests.  In this movie, Mother Earth was symbolically asking the  businessman, ""How would you like it if I ravaged your body?""  while Graham Green represented the Native peoples in exacting cruel  punishment on a symbolic cynical, greedy, self-serving businessman.

7827550,2,6302555450,"This movie is really good. No matter how many times Graham Greene's character tries to explain to the President of the logging company that the logging is destroying the land and spirits of the Indigenous people, he just doesn't care. That's why Graham's character acts the way he acts because he is extremely frustrated and reaches his breaking point. He takes an aggressive approach to try to end the problem, the problem being the never ending mistreatment of the Indigenous people and the destruction of the land, acts committed by white people for hundreds of years. The end result of the movie makes sense, it's not possible to make the white man care or understand the extent of physical and psychological damage he has inflicted upon the Indigenous people, and the damaging effects of deforestation. The violence in this movie adds so much to the story, showing how frustrated and angry Graham's character truly is. The story is a message, the message being, how do the whites like it when the Indian refuses to be a door mat and gives them a taste of their own brutality. I don't feel that this movie is intended to promote a racist message, it's intended to assist people in understanding how frustrated the indigenous people feel.

7827553,5,6302555450,"I saw this film many years ago and its been haunting me ever since.

What people seem to be missing here is that Graham Greene's character can be viewed as being utterly psychotic. Its a perfectly valid interpretation of the character.

7827554,5,6302555450,"The ancient, innate Being of the Native American is to Mother Earth such as few non-natives can comprehend. Allusion was made to this directly once or twice in this extraordinary film, and ineffably embodied by Graham Geene. Personal experience has shown me that the relationship between the Indian who has not signed agreements with this society but kept his own, and the Earth Mother, is undivided. Never has GG so embodied the power of silence of his race, or the physical beauty of an animal-god as he does here.

The portrayal of the two white men as classic ignorant a-holes was so over the top fantastic that I was able to actually watch the more violent parts with the sound on, and to laugh several times during this film. The humor of the Indian is beyond subtle, it is Great Mystery holding its sides over our self-created dramas as opposed to the real ones of Natives and the Earth which are one. So is everyone else and what good is it if we don't know it in our cells and live it with every breath.

Most glaring was the inability of the white man to shut up, perfectly true to life in most situations, from the banal to life-threatening, as though reactive insults and yelling would have any effect ... on an Indian!! Anyone who has spent a long time among Native Americans who've kept their soul intact has been touched by a power of silence, the silence of unity. The spiritually intact Native American possesses a self-containment that is the envy of other men and women. A self respect, an other-respect, a respect for all living things and those that do not appear to be living yet are.

This is a courageous and unforgettable film. Why is it not on DVD?????? Too dangerous.

7827558,4,6302555450,"This may be a bit of a spoiler if you haven't already seen the show.

  Only one other review I've read here seems to understand that Arthur is a Spirit. I don't believe He is specifically a ""tree"" spirit, He is more like a spirit of the environment; a spirit of nature, a fundamental force, perhaps even the Great Spirit.
  The very beginning of the film, shot underwater, is Arthur's manifestation; He rises from the water to the sight of McGuire (the white lawyer & the Spirit's focus of attention) commuting by plane, out to the clearcut.
  Later, when Wilf is giving both Arthur & McGuire a ride back to town, in the boat, McGuire asks Arthur where He's from. Arthur responds ""Lately?"" then splashes lake water in McGuire's eyes. McGuire doesn't realize he's been answered.
  At the end, unsuccessful in His bid to provoke/turn even one white man into His defender, Arthur recedes back to the depths from where He came. It's only once he's gone, that McGuire realizes with whom he has lived the past few days.

  I've watched this show maybe once a year, since the first time I viewed it, I always enjoy it. It's a little stiff at times, and the debarking/necklace-making scenes still unnerve me, but the story plays out well.
