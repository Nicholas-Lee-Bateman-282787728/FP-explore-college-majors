8491036,4,B00627HMFQ,"Like many a central-Kentucky kid growing up in the '70s, I, too, was glued to HAPPY'S HOUR, catching up with shenanigans of Froggie while watching the ""latest"" Buck Rogers chapter or Our Gang rerun! So glad to see a documentary on the subject that interviews many of the people who were there, along with vintage clips.

It is the clips themselves (or rather, the presentation of them) that leaves a bit to be desired. First off, the picture quality is quite a bit below standard on those portions, though I am giving allowance for the fact that it's quite likely that none of the original master tapes survived, and perhaps the filmmakers had to rely on old, off-air recordings on Beta or VHS.

That being said, though, there is no excuse for the filmmakers poor decision of cropping the original 4:3 image to fit into a widescreen frame! They should have pillarboxed the image (bars on the sides) to preserve the full picture, or place the full image to one side of the screen and run some trivia text on the leftover space to the side.

This cropping also occurs in the bonus footage. For shame, for shame! Not everyone out there expect the picture to fill up their flatscreen TV 100% of the time, especially if it means chopping the top and bottom off!

Would've been five stars had it not been for cropping the picture on all the vintage clips!",1323648000,,1349,4.56198347107438
