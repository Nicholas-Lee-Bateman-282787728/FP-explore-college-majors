2160742,5,B00062IYX2,"This video guides you through some key songs to get you comfortable with this style of blues fingerpicking. I consider Grossman the best teacher when it comes to early blues picking. He offers many other video's that take you much further into this unique guitar style. If you want your guitar to sound like a whole band, get this video. Also check out deltabluestips on youtube, and another great video to check out is KEB MO's homespun tape.",1281571200,,443,4.6923076923076925
2160743,5,B00062IYX2,"Country blues was a style of music that I had convinced myself I could not learn to play.  Then an acquaintance suggested this DVD set of lessons after I had raved about ""Learning Fingerstyle Blues,"" by Arnie Berle and Mark Galbo.

This is a tremendous value for your money.  What will you get?  A gentle progression through the country blues idiom.  Each lesson builds on the next and at the end you have a beginning repertoire and a clue as to what to try next.  It is rare in my experience that you get more than what you pay for...with any product.  Well, here's the one that exceeded my expectations.

Songs include: Oh Papa, Shake That Thing, Death Come Creeping, Nobody's Dirty Business (a personal favorite of mine), Pallet On Your Floor, Coffee Blues (great Mississippi John Hurt tune), Crow Jane, Oh Mary Don't You Weep, Delia, Old Country Rock and nice variations on Will The Circle Be Unbroken.

All well arranged and all will boost your confidence, performed by a great artist who is not afraid to be generous with his gifts.",1258502400,7,1038,4.628415300546448
2160744,5,B00062IYX2,"Simply put, I got the dvd I ordered, and it arrived well-packed and in a reasonable period of time. Thanks very much! The DVD is a fabulous instruction DVD. Stefan Grosman is a very good teacher, and the use of split screens helps see what the right and left hands are doing during every part of each song. I recommend this DVD to anyone with basic chord-changing skills who wants to play fingerstyle.",1250985600,,401,4.506849315068493
2160745,5,B00062IYX2,"I was looking to challenge my increasingly distracted aging mind and decided to learn fingerpicking; these vids were the perfect choice. Stefan Grossman knows and loves the subject matter and is a very fine teacher. Though the songs are short and basic, he starts by having you focus on getting a good sound. So, it's all good and it all stays interesting in its' relative simplicity. There is also something charming about his unabashed singing interspersed throughout and that makes me smile.

Though I have casually played guitar for thirty years ( in an undisciplined self taught way, think punk shredder) it took me almost three weeks to settle my brain and fingers down to get the first song.  And although the work is a lot of fun, most days I could not give it more than 15 minutes in short four or five minute intervals. Thus my progress is measured in weeks, not days.

I recently forced myself to play that first song in front of a few friends, since it's extra hard for me to play in front of people. One of them said I sounded like "" that guy ... Jordan... Yorta...Yurma Whatshisname."" I laughed plenty hard at that. And thanked him. Yes he meant Jorma Kaukonen, no I do not sound like Jorma, not at all, at least to the trained ear/ guitar player.

However, I like to think that what he heard is that I am learning to develop a good sound, as mentioned above. In summary, these are great introductory videos. I figure it might take me six months to get through them, YMMV. Enjoy.",1243728000,13,1493,4.498154981549815
2160746,5,B00062IYX2,"There are many gifted guitarists who make videos for students.  I know; I own most of them.  However, too many that are wonderful guitarists have no gift of teaching.  It is like a brilliant mathmetician teaching class, but no one can pass the class.  He does not possess the gift of teaching.

Stefan Grossman does.

This is an excellent set for those who wish to learn fingerpicking (I also strongly recommend Happy Traums Fingerstyle 1-3 from Homespundotcom; here at Amazon).  Both teachers:

1.  communicate in a non-threatening, non-ego, gentle manner. They encourage students.

Ever walk into a guitar store, have an employee with a haircut from the '80's demo a guitar for you with wild screaming licks, and then feel humiliated when he hands it to you?  Well, this is not what you get.

2.  Anticipate tough spots for students.  A good teacher will instinctively know when to slow down, and in this case, when to recommend the Pause button:  go and practice, and then come back!

3.  Build ""line upon line, precept upon precept"".  What this means is this:  DO NOT skip any songs.  Why not?  Even if you do not like a song, DO NOT skip it.  Grossman and Traum both have picked out songs that build upon each other.  You will find that one song has a note sequence in it, perhaps a small and relatively easy one; and then the next song will be similar, but slightly more complex.  As you progress through the DVD lessons, you will find that you are increasing in your understanding and your ability.

4.  have real value.  What do private lessons cost?  $ per hour?  What if you could take lessons from some of the countries greatest players?  This is what it is like to ""sit at the feet"" of some of these great teachers. Herein lies the greatest value.  Take for instance, Stefan Grossman's ""How To Play the Blues"" volume 1.  This is in the Key of C.  It is under 2 hours in duration.  I have gone through it carefully, bit by bit, stopping to practice, and then ""meeting"" with Grossman for the ""next lesson"".  This one DVD may end up equaling 6-12 weeks of private lessons, depending upon your level and how quickly you learn.  THEN, perhaps a year later, you will find that you go back and review those same lessons, only know you have learned to add in your own touch (called ""signature"") and the DVD retains its value to you.  This 2 DVD set may really end up equaling you months of lessons.  How much would that cost you locally?  Here it is about $40 for a single lesson, under 1 hour.  If you take lessons once per week, in 12 weeks, you have paid $480.  With the DVD here, you have saved yourself $440 AND can revisit it anytime you wish.

One more note about DVD lessons.  You will find that if you are serious about learning, you will be spending a lot of hours ""with"" a teacher.  If you do not like his demeanor, or personality, it will rub on you and you will be limited in your learning.  If a teacher is overly in love with himself, for example, it does not work that way with me.  You have to be comfortable with the teacher.  On one lesson, Stefan describes his voice as ""frog like"" in a touch of humor.  You can see him blush. He is a very humble teacher, who, like Happy Traum, seems to love to impart the music that they are so passionate about.  It is contagious.

Just a few recommendations for teachers like this who have put out wonderful DVDs for guitarists, or, in Traum's case, will play the role of ""host"" to a player and he skillfully slows down the guitarist to help the student.  I wholeheartedly recommend:  Stefan Grossman, Happy Traum, Artie Traum, Pete Huttlinger, Ernie Hawkins, John Miller, John Sebastian, and a few others.  Their web sites have video clips to let you experience the teacher to see if it is something you might like.  If a personality suits you, go with it, stay with it, and learn.  It is a rare gift to have men so incredibly talented musically, to also possess the gift of teaching.  This DVD will surely example that to you!",1214784000,19,3989,4.448753462603878
2160747,5,B00062IYX2,"I've been hacking for years and wanted to learn some real fingerpicking blues. This DVD is a great start for several reasons.

1. Stefan is a pleasant teacher. His easy-going attitude does come across, and it's a good element of the video.

2. The songs (there are 11 songs on the 2 DVDs) are well laid out in the booklet, both the lyrics and the tab. Stefan's tab is slightly different than some other tab, and I've read some grumbles about that, but my take is that if you're used to tab, it should take about, hmmmmmm, 30 seconds to adapt.  Not a big deal at all, and the larger print is actually better IMHO.

3. Stefan is a student of guitar history, and generously sprinkled throughout are video clips of some of the legends (Mance Lipscomb and Rev. Gary Davis to name just two.) Watching the greats is ... great.

4. For each song, Stefan teaches it from several angles (though I tend to focus on the tab booklet): first he performs it; then he talks about it; then he walks you through the phrases; then a split-screen (each hand is shown) slow-temp walk through.

5. This is aimed at a beginner fingerpicker (though not a beginning guitarist). So, if you're familiar with guitar and are interested in fingerpickin' blues, this is a great start. It'll keep you occupied for several months learning these 11 songs.

Here are the songs on these 2 DVDs:

Volume One: Oh Papa, Shake That Thing, Death Come Creeping, Nobody's Dirty Business and Make Me A Pallet Of Your Floor 88 minutes.

Volume Two: Coffee Blues, Crow Jane, Oh Mary Don't You Weep, Delia, Old Country Rock and Will The Circle Be Unbroken 82 minutes.

Just a great place to start.  I would also highly recommend Stefan's website.",1124755200,31,1699,4.555921052631579
2160805,4,B00062IYX2,"I like it a lot. As Grossman's books and CDs usually are, they are clear and basic. It's kind of a bummer to have to download and print out your own music tab sheets and lyrics...but worth it. It keeps the price down because they don't send you a book. These are traditional songs and he is a good teacher.",1400284800,,306,4.116666666666666
2160806,5,B00062IYX2,"Haven't had a good look at DVD yeah,but it will help me with my getting better with my fingerpicking guitar",1377561600,,107,4.4
2160807,5,B00062IYX2,"I've been learning guitar for about 3 or 4 years now, both flatpicking and fingerpicking.  I've tried many paths into fingerpicking, both books and video, most of them based on what was most highly rated on Amazon.  Grossman's offerings are by far the best (or maybe I should say they have worked the best for me).  Partly that's because this is the style I like the best--country blues and ragtime like Mississippi John Hurt, Gary Davis, Blind Blake, and so on.  But it's also because of the nature of the instruction.  The explanations are very helpful, but even more than that, I find it helpful to watch and listen as Grossman plays the songs slowly and then a little faster.  That's how I have progressed from merely playing the correct notes to getting a feel for playing the music--both for the rhythms of it and for the technical matters of how the thumb and fingers strike the strings.  For this reason this is a video I return to again and again, to work over songs I already know--I keep picking up nuances I hadn't noticed before.  My only criticism is that the video does progress pretty fast in terms of how hard the songs are to play.  But that gets better if you buy this along with another Grossman DVD, Fingerpicking Country Blues Guitar, and move back and forth between the two as you progress through them.  For instance, the first song on the other DVD, My Creole Belle (which is in the key of C), is a bit easier than the first song in the key of C on this video (Nobody's Dirty Business).  If you want to learn this style of playing, buy this DVD and FIngerpicking Country Blues Guitar--you'll have a good year's worth of fun learning ahead of you!",1358035200,2,1671,4.481848184818482
2160808,2,B00062IYX2,"Barely any emphasis on right hand string picking.
This video focuses more on chord techniques than how to finger pick.

I see that this DVD received many good reviews, so I picked up a copy. I am an experienced acoustic guitar player. I am great with my left hand on the neck with chords. But I never learned how to finger-pick the strings with my right hand. I only know how to strum or pluck the strings with a pick, and I do that pretty well. So I picked up this DVD with all the great reviews, to finally figure out how in the heck to pluck the strings correctly with my fingers. If you don't know how, or have absolutely no idea how to finger-pick, like me, this DVD will be disappointing.

The video begins with him introducing several acoustic songs and discussing the history of finger-picking songs. He spends a long time instructing on your left hand chord positioning on the neck. We begin hitting the strings with the right hand or finger just to get through the songs. But the focus is mainly on chord positioning on the neck, not how to pick the strings.

When he finally gets to showing the picking technique, he starts you plucking with one finger, then two. Then, in less than a minute, he assumes  you have the full technique with your thumb, index and middle finger. And immediately changes the subject back to chords and songs. The rest of the video assumes that you know the picking technique, and he moves on to more difficult songs. And that's the rest of the video. Never really concentrates on how to pick the strings. I am left as uneducated and unlearned on how to finger-pick as I was before I bought the video.

I am serious. If anyone wants to add their comments to this, go ahead. But I stand by my review, and this video is for people who already know how to finger-pick, or have the basic hang of it. Finger-picking is not easy, it is a hard thing to do. It's lIke typing. If you don't learn how, you will probably type with single fingers instead of all ten. You can't spend one minute on that, and 59 minutes learning about the typewriter.",1348876800,9,2074,4.390625
2160809,4,B00062IYX2,I just received the DVD.  I was surprised to see that it arrived without the booklet.  It turns out that the booklet is a PDF on the DVD itself.  Brilliant!  I look forward to Mr. Grossman's tutelage.,1348358400,,200,4.324324324324325
2160810,3,B00062IYX2,It was OK but not great. A lot of talk but not so much on instruction. Was not able to find any written materials - just DVD. I believe you would be able to find something better and this is all about old blues type fingerpicking and not so much on Acoustic.,1347926400,,258,3.980769230769231

2160812,1,B00062IYX2,"I requested a ""new"" product but one of the DVDs was severely scratched-up and as a result, did not work correctly.  It was obviously not a new DVD.  Also, the Tablature book was not included (but was included in the product description).  Not too useful without the Tablature book.  Too bad, it seemed like it would have been a great product.",1312243200,2,342,4.557377049180328
2160813,5,B00062IYX2,"I have been playing guitar for 2 to 3 years and wanted to improve my finger picking.  This was just the right book for me.  Easy to follow with good instruction taught slowly at first, Mr Grossman is genuine and comfortable ( He admits to not being a good singer and he's right) but he more than makes up for it with his excellent instruction and finger picking skills.  He teaches the old southern picking style that uses the thumb to keep the beat and the index and middle finger to play the melody.  Tabulature can be printed off of the DVD.",1312156800,,544,4.303921568627451
2160814,5,B00062IYX2,"I began playing guitar two years ago.  Early on, I found myself wanting to learn finger picking styles of playing.  I spend the usual time on YouTube viewing videos here and there, and I came across one of Stefan's tutorials.  I like his methods of teaching and his humble approach to guitar.  He often says ""I'm not a singer""... and that is ok because I didn't buy the DVD to hear him sing.  He is one of the best finger picking guitarist out there.  This DVD comes with tabs and lyrics to songs he teaches.  The format he uses is instruction with commentary and then he plays the tune on a split screen where you can see his fret hand and picking hand together as you practice.

I like most of the tunes on the DVD and still play them as I practice my playing every day. Learning to finger pick guitar is good for hand coordination and timing.  Stefan is an excellent instructor.  Highly recommend.",1299974400,,900,4.367469879518072
8037103,5,B00062IYX2,"A selection of tunes that move progressively at a reasonable pace. Some may not be something you will keep in your repertoire but they are actual musical statements that help you develop specific techniques as opposed to rote exercises removed from a ""real-life"" musical situation. I'm an experienced guitarist but always played plectrum-style. Most fingerstyle or fingerpicking educational material I found was either too rudimentary or too advanced but Mr. Grossman hit the right combination for me on this set.",1513555200,,513,5.425
8037104,4,B00062IYX2,Love his style and his manner.  Look forward to learning all the songs on this DVD.,1508025600,,83,4.1875
8037105,3,B00062IYX2,This book and dvd assume a level of competence that I don't possess.,1500508800,,68,4.3076923076923075
8037106,5,B00062IYX2,"This 2 DVD set provides tremendous instruction into fingerstyle blues, country/blues and ragtime-ish music and is a great value.  I am just loving the boom chick of the alternating bass line along with the high end melodies singing out and have really learned a lot and come a long way in about 2 months of using these DVDs.  I actually find it hard to believe how good I have gotten - the songs sound way more complicated than they are to me now.  I would say I am an intermediate guitar player, but I think more novice pick players that at least can finger chords decently would do well with the DVDs.  The DVDs are laid out so that it is pretty easy on the fretting hand at first so you could really focus on the right hand strumming fingers.  The songs of the first DVD get progressively harder but stay in the same keys of C and G so that your skills build from the prior songs.

One obstacle I had was that it was not very clear at least to me which portion of the palm that you should use for damping the bass strings played with your thumb.  I had thought the fleshy stuff below the thumb was the correct portion of the hand, but this was very difficult to do and made a thuddy, distorted sound.  Low and behold I found that the fleshy portion below my pinky and above the wrist (think karate chop on the strings near the bridge) with very light pressure makes the bass sound great.  If you are on the fence getting these DVDs, my advice is to listen to a song or two by Mississippi John Hurt.  If you want to start learning to play those type of songs, totally get these DVDs as they provide great instruction and you will gain the tools to be good at that style of music.",1497398400,,1681,4.192546583850931

8037108,5,B00062IYX2,"Any aspiring guitarist who wants to define themselves by playing acoustic guitar, or anyone wanting to grow in their development of playing acoustic guitar, should begin to purchase Stefan Grossman's instructional DVDs, if I may humbly say.  I love Stefan Grossman and plan on getting all his DVDs.  Each song is broken down and I keep practicing that one song and once I feel comfortable I move on to the next one.

8037110,5,B00062IYX2,"The more I study fingerpicking guitar, and the blues in particular, the more I am finding that aside from holding the guitar with the soundhole facing out  :)  there aren't any rigid rules. I've been amassing a good amount of instructional material, and picking up a lot of effective information particularly from DVD videos.

This course from Stefan Grossman is very good - he focuses on sound textures and how to produce an 'authentic' sound and phrasing. He occasionally uses some archival footage of old masters working their craft to illustrate a point, which is pretty cool.

He does have a rather unique way of presenting guitar TAB - for clarity, he uses the spaces instead of the lines to indicated string and fret number - he also uses vertical lines to indicate if it's a finger or thumb that picks a particular string. There's a booklet inside the DVD case, and there's also a PDF file on each disc.

Anyway, there's a lot of good information here, as well as numerous potential pieces to add to your repertoire.",1449619200,2,1024,4.698324022346369
