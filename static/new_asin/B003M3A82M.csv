4154316,5,B003M3A82M,"I love ""The Real McCoys"" even though I'm a Hatfield...LOL. This show is one of the best all-time family comedies. The cast is wonderful with Walter Brennan, Kathy Nolan and the under-rated Richard Crenna. GREAT STORIES that seem timeless. I cannot wait for the last 2 seasons,.",1278720000,2,277,4.914893617021277

4154319,5,B003M3A82M,"It's been a long two years since the release of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Real-McCoys-Season-3/dp/B001675ZHY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Real McCoys - Season 3</a>&nbsp;but we gladly welcome back Grandpa Amos McCoy and family into our homes once more.  Billed as rural comedy, it is often hilarious and at times will bring moisture to the eyes.  The Real McCoys is a supreme example of perfect family viewing in this ever changing American media landscape.  This refreshing and very affordable set (at time of pre-order) offers a whopping 39 episodes (no half season set here)!  Recommended without reservation for families all!

UPDATE: 06.21.10

As with the other three season sets, each episode runs about 3 minutes short; truly a great loss of fine programing...but, still many thanks to Infinity Entertainment for bringing back an American family classic for todays contemporary audience!",1273795200,26,949,6.097744360902255

However, all six seasons of the show are now available, but must be purchased individually. The price should be much more reasonable than in the past ($40 compared to over $100).",1415145600,,356,4.393939393939394

4154336,5,B003M3A82M,"I am so glad they have released another season of this wonderful show, although Kate McCoy (Kathy Nolan) is missing from several episodes in the middle of the season. This was due to Miss Nolan getting injured while riding a horse during the filming of an episode of the show. Despite this, the show is still a cut above most shows of the time and most of today's. Kate did return for the remainder of this season and was then on the show throughout the fifth season. I certainly hope the fifth season will also be released on DVD in the very near future.",1297123200,2,555,4.346153846153846
