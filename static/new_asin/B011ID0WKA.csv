8724271,1,B011ID0WKA,With Danny Glover I had some hope that this was a sleeper hit. It was a sleeper alright. Story line wasn't bad nor the acting nor the script but the movie moved like molasses with very little energy.,1473033600,,199,4.2631578947368425
8724272,4,B011ID0WKA,"I was hopeful this would be a good movie. It took a while to build the whole vision of the movie, and right when I was just ready to call it quits things rolled up and turned into a very enjoyable and gratifying story. revenge is always sweet and its great to really root for the good side. I would have liked to see more of ""the ever after"" But as in most fairy tales your left with the good guys off into the sunset.",1472860800,,418,3.929411764705882

8724278,1,B011ID0WKA,"This is the lamest acting I've seen, considering the three main actors have considerable acting experience.  The plot - undeveloped; script -  juvenile.  The virus was ludicrous and as large and luminous as a firefly.",1445904000,2,217,5.142857142857143
8724279,2,B011ID0WKA,"Yet another crap infection movie where nothing of merit happens. Theres a lot of missing tension between people in this movie and thats the only way these type of flicks work. If the infection isn't turning them into monsters or making them crazy, then you have to create a drama between the people or the movie is a bore. And this movie is a definite bore. They do the tried and true method of low concept, low budget genre filmmaking in terms of casting. Hire a couple people with skill, but have low demand so you can get them cheap. Then hire a bunch of nobodies with dubious acting skills to fill out the cast. The story has almost no originality and it just feels like a retread of all the bad infection flicks that came before it. Formulaic and lame.",1444953600,,757,4.375886524822695
