8589413,4,B00D48F1A4,"Therese,La Religieuse,Angels of Sin, life in Holy Orders is a particular subject that attracts major film makers like bees to honey. The Nun,directed by Nicloux,is an adaptation of Diderots novel. Diderot in The Enlightenment was writing about the abuses of power in the Catholic Church,the result of patriarchal power and class structures. Pauline Etienne,giving a powerful central performance,embodies remarkably,faith tempered by reason,as Diderot rails against religious fanaticism and the ills that can afflict novitiates of the cloistered life. Lacking religious vocation, Suzanne refuses to take her vows. Niclouz charts the trajectory of this 17 year old girl. Suzanne illustrates the lack of power of the impecunious bourgeoisie in 18th century France:without a dowry she cannot marry,but her class prevents her from working. Her feckless parents have handed her over,since all their money has gone into marrying off her 2 older sisters. This decision is also motivated by her being illegitimate. Her mother(Martina Gedeck) asks her to expiate the sin of her birth. She had a brief love affair ,Suzanne the fruit of this liaison,without Suzanne knowing who her true father is.

The film divides roughly into 3 parts that correspond to 3 mother superiors. Madame de Moni(Lebrun) is kindly but embodies gentle coercion,manipulating Suzanne into becoming a nun against her will. Her life ends in mysterious circumstances. The 2nd, Sister Christine(Louise Bourgoin) is cruel and merciless, Suzannes hair is chopped off, shes stripped naked, forced to wear rags, starved, sleeps in the dungeon, and in one painful scene, lead barefoot down a staircase covered with crushed glass. She has secreted writing materials to pen the memoire that frames the narrative,also to pen a complaint to the authorities about her situation. The 3rd,St. Eutropes Mother Superior,illustrates how a cloistered,female-only existence leads to lesbianism and madness. Huppert known for extreme roles(The Pianist) portrays hysterical physical desire and her need for affection,but she has the girls competing to prove their devotion. Etienne is less victim than rebellious spirit,her nave,round,soft features,and pale eyes combining with her ability to convey strength and rebelliousness,despite suffering many ordeals. The script excellently brings out the strength and agency of the female characters. The convent scenes are filmed naturistically(contrasting with Rivettes mannered treatment), The film is beautifully shot, courtesy of cinematographer Yves Cape's crisp camerawork and the production design is excellent, particularly Anais Romand's period costumes. In addition, rather than going for outright melodrama and high emotion, the script has a matter-of-fact quality to it that is deeply unsettling. The Nun is a watchable and well made French period drama with stunning production design work and a superb central performance from Pauline Etienne. Worth seeing. Although the film was not banned as Rivettes was,Nicloux had to shoot the convent scenes in Germany,due to refusals in France for the sets due to the subject of the film.",1395100800,,3126,5.6937901498929335
8589414,4,B00D48F1A4,"""The Nun"" (2013 release from France; original title ""La Religieuse""; 114 min.) brings the story of Suzanne, a 16 year old girl, growing up in the late 18th century. Suzanne has 2 older sisters who each have their eyes set already on getting married. Alas, for Suzanne, her modest-to-do parents couldn't possibly afford to marry out three daughters, so Suzanne is sent to a monastery, with the hope of becoming a nun. Once at the monastery, Suzanne is overcome with doubts about taking the final oath to become a nun. After much back-and-forth, Suzanne gives in and becomes a nun. However, disaster strikes when ""mother nun"", the head of the monastery, passes away (under apparently dubious circumstances) and the new ""mother nun"" reigns with terror over the sisters. At that point we are not even halfway into the movie, and to give away more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first and foremost, this is a very sober and restrained movie, which makes for a very intense and not always easy viewing experience. The movie, which is based on the book by Denis Diderot, does an excellent job in putting you, as if it were, right in the middle of the monastery and letting you experience how these nuns live their modest lives on a day-to-day basis. There is almost no music in the movie to speak of, which only re-emphasizes the sparse environment of the movie. The acting performances are ace throughout, none more so than Pauline Etienne as the young woman Suzanne, as she brings the doubts and the desperation experienced by Suzanne with a chilling effect. Of course Isabelle Huppert is great too as one of the ""mother nuns"".

I saw this movie in April earlier this year during a family visit to Belgium. The screening where I saw this at in Belgium was very well attended, and at that time I could see this movie possibly becoming a hit in art-house theatres here in the US. Now 6+ months later, it's clear this will not be released in US theatres, but will go straight to a DVD/Blu-ray release. Bottom line: if you are in the mood for a top-notch foreign movie that is miles away from your standard Hollywood fare, you cannot go wrong with this. ""The Nun"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1384473600,2,2272,4.6633416458852865
