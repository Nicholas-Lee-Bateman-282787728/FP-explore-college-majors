7982159,4,B00008DI36,This season was probably the best out of all the seasons for this show.  I loved how they created the show and I got pulled in.  But after the second season it got much worse.,1345507200,,175,3.9714285714285715

7982162,5,B00008DI36,"My boyfriend & are 21 & love this show so it's not just for young teenagers even though it deals with a lot of teen problems though the 5 years it was on. My boyfriend remembered how much he loved seeing this show come on when ever he could so he ordered it & we were both hooked right away. We have watched season 1 & 2 now together (season 1 is probably the best) & were ready the get season 3, lol i must say though the only down points i've found are there's A TON of charecters to keep track of.",1227916800,,500,3.8640776699029127
7982163,5,B00008DI36,"This is a Great show.  Think of Mad Max meets Lord Of The Flies.  Don't let the costumes, hair colors and makeup fool you.  This show somehow pulls you in and makes you care about the characters and the world there now living in.  For every teen that thought the world would be a better place without adults and think they could do a better job, think again.  This is the world of THE TRIBE.  How long could you live off tinned food (caned food) before you would have to organize farms?  How would you get kids to work on a farm?  Do you pay them?  If so, with what?  Or do you use kids as slaves?  Who do you go to when you get sick?  What to you do when all the antibiotics run out?  All these and more are things that come up in the 5 seasons, 260 episodes of THE TRIBE.

The bad news is this was never released in a USA DVD format and it never will be.  I got all 5 of my box sets from Amazon UK.  They shipped them from the UK right to my door here in USA with no problems.  Don't worry to much about them being in PAL format.  Many of the big box mart stores sell DVD players that will play both PAL and NTSC formats for around $40 US.  Most of the time it will tell you on the outside box or you can ask to look at the owners manual and it will be listed on the specifications page.

If your from North America  and sitting on the fence waiting for a USA DVD format you can forget it.  It's not going to happen.  There were only so many copies of THE TRIBE produced and when there gone there gone.  Do some footwork and I guarantee you'll find a player at a box mart store near you that will play both PAL and NTSC format.  Then go to Amazon UK and get all 5 seasons.  You'll never forgive yourself if you don't.",1227398400,7,1719,3.9101449275362317
7982164,5,B00008DI36,"I love this show. I just wish this would be released in the USA format already. I've been waiting for years for it to come out. It's the best show, targeted specifically for teens. No adults from a toxic chemical in the air that only kills the adults, so only the kids and teenagers are alive and they run everything. Chaos ensues, different ""tribes"" form (almost kind of like different governmental systems if you think of it), a lot of adult themes though..like sex, unwanted pregnancy, babies, death, killing, things like that. The older teenagers think they are more mature than the kids so they automatically presume that they are above, like the parents were, and can tell everyone what to do (which of course ends up in the ""anarchy"" like chaos thing I mentioned). It's more like a soap opera drama sci-fi thing for teens. I'm 23 now and I've been watching it for awhile (until the series ended which was a bit ago. pretty sad. My favorite character was killed) with my mom. We both really enjoyed this show. I just hope this comes out soon for USA format. I would buy every season.",1224633600,3,1089,4.561224489795919
7982165,5,B00008DI36,"This show was fantastic!  I wish this would be released in the USA, I'd get every season!!!!
The adults died from some chemical released in the air, so only children are alive.  The teens have to run everything.  It was just so fascinating to watch.  And the young New Zealand actors did such a wonderful job!",1220313600,,309,4.464285714285714
