This isn't even a B-grade movie though, in fact it didn't even ""feel"" like a movie.  I had to fast forward and finally I just couldn't finish it.  I promise you folks, this is very difficult to watch.  I understand martial arts movies are not ment to be all out great most of the time, but they are supposed to at least have good fight action.  This is the first and only film I have seen that has no choreogrpahy whatsoever.  These guys are just literally throwing their legs and arms around.  And the fights drag on and on and on cause each movie they throw is sooooo sloooooow.

I'm sorry but I had to be honest.  This is a fine video for ameaturs, and I couldn't do better thats for sure.  But this is not a movie, at least it just does not have a movie feel.  To leave on a positive note, there is plenty of great footage of Hong Kong and Vegas, but thats what the travel channel is for i guess.  I should have listened to the reviewer before me before I got this, he was right.",1178755200,2,1153,4.1441441441441444
7873498,1,6304527616,I am a major martial arts movie buff and hate to give these movies bad reviews but have no choice on this one. I guess when I brought this film thinking it was going to be good but was mistaken big time and only got it for the fact that at the time when it was purchased by me there weren't any comments on this movie so i took the gamble which is obviously my own my own fault. The fight scenes are by amateur so called martial artists who don't know anything about real full contact fighting because every time a punch or kick is thrown it goes nowhere near the opponent but he still manages to hit the ground in a fake grunt of fake pain. Don't get this movie unless you have run out of other movies to purchase if I could take it back this would be going to the very last of my collection purchasing on amazon or anywhere else.,1131408000,,831,4.042424242424242

And yeah, I was glad to get a break and make movie music, but this film is  really a hoot.  There's a lot of subtle stuff, inside and left field jokes.  (This was just after the OJ trial and there's a great scene with a  suspected killer trying on a pair of gloves!) There's naked girls a-plenty  and some really good performaces and, if you like kick boxing, (which the  ""NBC"" of Mexico does 'cause they aired it nationally,) you can't  get better than Guerrin and Storm. I love the Shakespearean fake cop duo,  resigned to their 'kill or be killed' fates.  Fate is explored through out  this film.  It's smart and culty.  It's bad in a really good way.  I'm  proud to be associated with it.  And the newest singing sensation, Wendie  Colter (""Payday"" -1999) sings the title track in an unmistakable  Shirley Bassy, Goldfinger style.  We had a blast scoring it, watching it,  and laughing between immitating the kicks... And Vernon Wells ( Road  Warrior) is such a great presence...
To my way of thinking, this Movie is  a collectors item.  Try it! ( or go rent it to see if you want to purchse  it...) by the way, Amazon is 1/2 the price I usually see it for due to its  relative rare status.",940291200,5,1339,4.385245901639344
