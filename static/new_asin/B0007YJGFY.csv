2251429,5,B0007YJGFY,"I borrowed this DVD from my library when I was transitioning from a vegetarian diet to a vegan one.  I found this extremely helpful, especially with the grocery store suggestions and her tips for ordering out at restaurants.  Most restaurants typically have only one vegetarian item on their menu (if at all) and this DVD made it easier for me to recognize items that can be made vegan with a little customization.  The presentation at the beginning is very, very informative, but I agree with the other reviewers that it could be a little more sophisticated.  I also love her meal planning tips/suggestions to make grocery shopping and cooking easier.  If you've planned ahead and already thought out what you will prepare for every meal, it makes it much easier to stick with it.  I'm glad that she had the idea to put together a presentation like this-- hopefully it will help convince more people to go vegan!",1215475200,3,913,4.746835443037975
2251430,2,B0007YJGFY,This DVD was something that I really wanted to like but just couldn't. The quality is poor and the material in it seems really dated. Save your money on this one.,1198713600,,162,4.258064516129032
2251431,3,B0007YJGFY,"The intent and content of this video is outstanding.  The person who speaks and teaches throughout is a formerly overweight woman who lost weight and improved her health by switching to a vegan diet.  She admits once that she occassionally may slide, but is thankful there are not vegetarian police watching.  Her slide presentation is full of very good content, but is just poorly done given that it's old transparencies on an overhead projector.  I can imagine though with the same information done on Powerpoint it would be awesome.  She has a section on the video where she takes us shopping.  I think this section could've been expanded a great deal.  She points out just a few items that are good transition foods like Boca burgers, but doesn't show the bulk sections, doesn't discuss grains or cooking methods, barely points out beans on the shelf.  The final section is around some basic ""cooking"" demonstrations if you can call what she does cooking.  She basically throws some stuff into a food processor for different recipes and bakes it or eats it fresh.  Not too bad for working moms who are looking for quick meals for kids, but as someone who likes really cooking this video falls far short.  She does provide some interesting looking dishes at the end without any recipes for them.  Probably the part I found useful was when she goes to various restaurants and orders an insane amount of food off the menus just to demonstrate how you can make just about anything on a menu vegan, or at least vegetarian.  With a little confidence and creativity she showed that asking them to leave out the butter, cheese, chicken, etc. can really work.",1178668800,5,1654,4.76140350877193
2251432,5,B0007YJGFY,"My 9 and 6 y/o daughters and I watched Jill's DVD as soon as it arrived.  We've been Vegan for a very short time and watching her DVD reinforced the reasons why.  She provides a wealth of information, including the detriments of eating animal products and the overwhelming benefits of eating plant based foods only.  I especially loved her trips to a grocery store and a natural foods store.  She pointed out many items that we already use and some we hope to try.  Her recommendations were very helpful.  My daughters got a kick out of her trips to various restaurants. It made them very hungry!!  And her outtakes were hilarious.  It showed how very real and down-to-earth she is.",1139616000,16,682,4.625
2251433,5,B0007YJGFY,"I received my DVD yesterday and watched it last night.  Jill Ovnik does a wonderful job in presenting the facts in an interesting, down-to-earth way. I have read many books on veganism and believe her presentation is very accurate.  The plus is that she is witty and grabs your attention. I will watch it again and again, and learn something new each time.",1137542400,11,356,4.634920634920635
2251434,5,B0007YJGFY,"This DVD will give you some facts and figures that you never would have previously entertained.  Jill Ovnik, the creator and ""star"" of the DVD, walks the viewer through her personal transition from a diet which included meat and dairy products to a diet that is completely void of such items, a vegan diet.

If you are a vegitarian that is ready to go to the ""next level"", or if you are a meat eater that has thought about veganism, this DVD is for you. If you have health issues, especially those that could be related to meat consumption, (heart disease, cancer, osteoporosis) then this DVD is for you. You will learn about the benefits of a meat-free, vegan diet in terms of solid facts and statistics. Jill will take you shopping to explore the many choices that are available with such a diet.  She also details several recipes that are favorites of hers and instructs viewers how they can go about eating in their favorite dining establishments while still adhering to their food preferences.

Give this DVD a chance--it will, as the title suggests, change your life!",1127692800,16,1073,4.691489361702128

8054026,1,B0007YJGFY,"I only lasted about 5 minutes into this video. As soon as she said she wasn't a doctor or dietician I became a bit concerned.
Production value aside, what she's promoting is dangerous. She's focused on fat without realizing or alluding to the fact that there are different kinds of fat.
Remember the ""fat free"" craze of about 20 years ago when companies starting producing ""light"" versions of everything. The reduced the fat by introducing more refined carbs and it just made everyone fatter.
She lifts up items listing the fat content in each. She compared salmon to potatoes. Salmon is full of healthy fats and protein, whereas potatoes while low in fat contain LOTS of starchy carbs that will react in the body like sugar. Spiking insulin levels and if the carbs aren't used up quickly, they get converted to... You guessed it. FAT. Stored fat!!
Where the fat contained in salmon will be used to help lower cholesterol, help with joint health as well as skin and hair health.
She may have better points later in the video, but I think it's likely she's talking about things she doesn't fully understand.
What she did worked for her, but could prove dangerous to others.",1376438400,,1172,4.721951219512195
8054027,5,B0007YJGFY,"IF you are trying to  improve your health, this is a great DVD to refer to. The ""Vegan"" gal is straight forward, informative and gets you motivated.",1316822400,2,148,4.481481481481482
8054028,1,B0007YJGFY,"I am always looking to learn about nutrition and came across this DVD.  She talks about how many animals an individual eats a year and stated if we were meant to eat meat we should be able to attack a cow and eat it.  Of course we know the answer to this.  A couple of days later I came across a youtube video titled ""foods that Kill"".  I could''t believe it.  It had the same dialog in many of the sections contain in this DVD including the diagrams as well.  Who copied whom? I don't know.  So don't waste your money just watch ""foods that kill"".  It is the same thing except his face is not as attractive as hers. Furthermore, the youtube video is by a physician and provides extensive information more so than this DVD and its FREE!",1305676800,,736,4.207142857142857
8054029,2,B0007YJGFY,"Well, for one, during her presentation she spelled ""Atkins"" wrong. Then, when she took viewers vegan shopping, she pushed a lot of processed soy products, talking about how great they were but barely glazing over alternatives for those concerned about the breast cancer issue (the medical jury is still out, but those who want to go vegan and are concerned about their health might like to hear about other options). During one of her restaurant meals, she made a remark that olive oil is ""pure fat"" and will go straight to her thighs. Okay, I get that everyone metabolizes things differently, but I would have liked her to say something about how olive oil is a ""healthy fat."" I sort of laughed because she ate olives with every meal she showed us (and she ate A LOT of meals - sometimes four or five per restaurant, which, to each their own I guess). I don't expect every single bit of health information from one DVD or anything, but for those who do find her accessible and choose to use her information as their vegan starter kit, it would be nice if they received accurate and well-rounded information. I don't see why this needed to be a DVD for sale. She could have just posted the information on a web site (and did some more research) and called it a day.",1304121600,,1265,4.504347826086956
8054030,4,B0007YJGFY,This is a pretty good DVD on Veganism. But I was a little disappointed to see the use of non organic food during her cooking segment . Hard core Vegans will likely agree with me on this that the lady doesn't go far enough in her quest to embrace a healthy life. But still it is a nice introduction for new Vegans and people considering going Vegan.,1302998400,,348,4.208955223880597
8054031,5,B0007YJGFY,"perfect: nothing 'hollywood' about this video. i felt like i was watching a good friend happily sharing valuable and fun information, presented professionally.",1283990400,2,159,5.956521739130435
8054032,5,B0007YJGFY,"I think this video is very informative and I love the way that Jill put it together. She is funny, she knows what she is talking about and she  makes you feel like you are watching a friend talking, She shows the problem, the solution and the way to do it properly and how easy it can be to keep this lifestyle.
Great! 5 stars",1270166400,2,326,4.015384615384615
8054033,5,B0007YJGFY,"This is a *great* DVD.

I learned more from this DVD than I did from dozens of doctors I've been and books I've read to over the years.

What I especially like about this video is the second half which not only goes to a health store supermarket and tells us *brand name* products we can but, but then also the narrator of the DVD takes us out for breakfast, lunch and dinner and shows us how easy it is to order a vegan meal at any *regular* restaurant.

I watched this DVD at about the same time I was reading Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn's wonderful book ""Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease"" -- [...]
As a result of my vegan diet and my increased exercise, I cut my cholesterol from 184 to 150 and my triglycerides from 221 to 169 IN SIX WEEKS, BABY!  Six weeks!!!!!!

I am now faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive and, soon, will be able to leap tall buildings in a single bound.

Seriously, this DVD shows how much you owe it to yourself to get a.) off the junk food, b.) stop listening to mainstream doctors who know *nothing* about nutrition and c.) start listening to people who have your best interests at heart.",1255305600,3,1140,4.328638497652582
