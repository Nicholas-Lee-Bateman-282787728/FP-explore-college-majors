7924854,2,B00004W5T7,"This is a sappy and poorly-acted film.  I wanted to see it because I love the singing voice of Gary Morris, who plays the main character.  Wilford Brimley appears only briefly, but is on the jacket photo presumably because his is the best-known of the names in the cast.  Mr. Morris is the actual star.  I had read that there are a couple of his songs which have not been included on any of his other recordings, and that is the reason I bought the DVD.  Unfortunately, they are background music, not easy to hear.  Mr. Morris's character in the film is himself a country music star, and the plot includes a concert, in which other successful country singers perform full songs....yet his character is not one of them!  The DVD went straight from the TV to the trash can.",1426550400,,771,4.464285714285714

It was the movie maker. Also, there was too much hanky panky going on. Even if the ""father"" was the bad guy.",1260576000,,279,3.912280701754386

7924859,2,B00004W5T7,"have you ever seen a bad movie?  well this one could probably be worse! here is 7 reasons why i think it was the worst movie i had ever seen.

1.horrible story line.

first he's there to sell his dead brothers farm then he's there to fix te farm and save the crops then he's there to get back ""his lady"" who happens to be married

2.too much left unexplained.

he says to this guy named ""paul"" ,""who are you paul... when were you born paul... you died in 1969... you borrowed money from a big company... were you going to murder me too... etc, etc, etc!  he never ever explains any of this!!!

3.dumb people.

they (good guy and lady) think they should just leave.  like come on the ""good guy just returned from being away for 10 years, he has been there for about a month and now they are talking about just leaving the ladie's husband who she has been married to for 9 years they just want to leave and take the daughter who has been raised by the lady and her husband and has thought that her mom's husband was her father but really the ""good guy"" is her father. and listen here they like seriously kiss when the lady is married.  they also kiss right in front of ladies house where her husband is watching the (although they didn't know). like hey lady this guy has been gone for 10 years just settle down and stay with your husband! don't go and act like your young again.

4.the picture cuality isn't so good.

it's kinda scratchy all the way throught the movie but then at one point when they are in the barn it's light outside then it just turns black! just like that.  you can hardly see the people.

5. BAD ENDING!!!!!!!

the end is so stinking dumb!  the good guy talks to paul who is ladies husband and says, ""i know who you are paul, bla bla bla!"" in the end the bad dude tries to run over good guy (you never know y) little girl rides in front of car paul turns to miss the girl and hits as tree then the car blows up (which is kinda cool) then good guy runs to try to save burning dude who is still alive but ,"" oh no it's too hot, i can reach in two feet to pull out burning dude."" oh and hey little girl, the guy who you grew up knowing as your father is burning alive!

7.never explains why ""paul"" killed good guy's brother.

you cannot have a good story without an explanation as to why the bad guy killed good guy or his brother!

all in all i can TOTALLY see why this never made it to hollywood or blockbuster.  the only reason that it's getting two out of five is because the little girl was a pretty good actor and could have been hollywood material with a little bit of work.  if it wasn't for her it would be a 1 and if i could do it zero.

-bhc

p.s. only buy this movie if you have ABSOLUTELY NO WAY TO SPEND YOU DAY!

otherwise it's not worth snap.",1179014400,5,2776,4.069981583793738
