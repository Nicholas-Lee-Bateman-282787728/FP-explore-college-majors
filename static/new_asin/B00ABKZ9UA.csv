8549836,4,B00ABKZ9UA,"This is a class that feels better than it looks.  In fact, it feels good enough to make me use it to practice with despite the obvious disadvantage of having to stop/replay the barre exercises in order to work both sides.  This wouldn't matter for its target audience of dance teachers looking for tips on how to use the musical selections on the corresponding album to structure their classes to best advantage.  The pace of the music is slow, something Americans, always in a hurry, sometimes complain of in Russian ballet classes even at much more advanced levels than this beginner-intermediate class, but it works for me, as does the added slowing effect occasioned by Roudnev's many  comments, corrections and explanations..  I've been away from ballet for a while, know more than I can actually do at this point, and Roudnev's attention to every detail provides useful reminders, as the slower pace gives more opportunity to notice whether I'm actually getting it right.  The result is that I'm less hot and breathless after an hour with this DVD than after 20 minutes with some others and I finish practicing with a rather agreeable sense of ""feeling"" the effort in all the right muscles--a sense of having actually made progress I'll be able to see down the road if not today.

As for the criticisms that have appeared in some reviews--if the student demonstrator was perfect, there would be small opportunity for corrections which serve to point up things the dance-teacher audience needs to be aware of in their own pupils.  And trying hard to please the instructor is more admirable than pitiable.  The forced look of the turnout, with a resulting tendency to roll-in on the arches is less worrisome if you remember that it is apparently a carefully considered strategy of the Vaganova method.  Students are typically admitted to the six-day a week pre-professional program around the age of 10, which gives about a year when, according to medical thought, it is still possible to increase the natural degree of turnout.  Pushing for a perfect fifth early does make for some things that look bad in the short run, but probably sort themselves out over time.  At least, if you look at adult Russian dancers, most of them seem to have outgrown the swaybacked look.  Possibly because their instructors kept reminding them not to push the shoulders back and the stomach out, and so on..and on.",1424995200,,2401,4.8697788697788695
8549837,2,B00ABKZ9UA,"Although he talks about placement of the body and arms, I wouldn't recommend this video. The girl's hips are tilted down so she ""sticks out"". She has a sway back. Her elbows are dropped so her back muscles aren't held. Her feet are over turned out and there are clear video moments of her feet going in one direction while the knees are going in another direction. Ouch and what damage as well. Her a la seconde when she lifts her leg side is completely turned in. I mean the heel is facing the back of the room. So the beautiful first position is not coming from the hip joint like it should but unnaturally from screwing her knees and ankles. To me she is a mess. She is so stiff she might as well be a doll. I don't think she could dance because she is over stressed with technique. I  hope she can still walk.
I hear that some of his other videos are good. This was the first I ever saw and I am really disappointed.",1396742400,3,920,4.139664804469274
8549838,3,B00ABKZ9UA,"I gave this video 3 stars although it doesn't deserve it from the visuals...only the theory Dmitri is talking about. Unfortunately his student is not able to follow his instructions...not because she doesn't try but because she can't.......which makes me even feel sorry for this little girl in writing this review. The little girl is trying very hard to execute what Dmitri wants ...but all is forced and it is quite painful to see her trying to keep her balance in full turn out which she can't manage and see her sticking her 'bum' out to compensate. Ditto her arms ... since she doesn't have the turnout she's 'grabbing' with her arms which means her elbows are permanently dropped even though he keeps telling her to 'rest them lightly on a table top'. Pity since all the other videos  Dmitri has produced are great - Partnering Secrets, Ballet Class Vols V and VI as well as Ballet Class in Russia. Regarding Ballet Class V and VI he uses Amercian professional dancers (Joffrey Ballet)... whom, quite frankly, I thought were amateurs due to their lack of a deep and controlled pli which made their work look 'choppy' but overall they were doing what they should do. As a comparison the 14 yr olds in the Russian Ballet Class video show how important correct training in ballet is from the very first lessons. Although they are struggling at times their bodies are properly prepared and hte steps are executed fuidly and with control not brute force ....like poor Maggie in this video. Sorry Dmitri!",1373846400,3,1504,4.740458015267175
