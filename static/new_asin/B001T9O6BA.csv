8340846,1,B001T9O6BA,"Wow, where is the proof that Brett Dillon is ""The Last Great DJ?  This video does not make that argument, let alone prove it.  I thought I  was going to find a nice independent documentary on the radio business and how a DJ named Brett Dillon fared over the years in a business that has been totally taken over by corporations with ""crap"" as the format to play.  Instead I got a 71 minute video that was lacking in content, has way too many camera switches, has bad editing and is full of filler music of small bands, probably from Texas.  Now if you want to hear some new music, kind of a progressive country, you can learn about some new musicians from this video. If your in need of having to hire a DJ, Brett Dillion has sent you his resume via this DVD. This DVD does a great job of telling you who he is, where he came from, why he likes the radio/music business and why people like him.  From this video I learned that Brett Dillon has moved all over, been a DJ in various places in the West, has a great radio voice and his listeners like him.  I'm sure after watching this he's probably a great DJ,

Dillon is right on when he says that people want local radio to play local news, tell local information and that people don't want some satellite radio broadcast to fill in for their morning commute.

Unfortunately if your looking for a watchable video that would help you understand the shirking radio business and the disappearance of the American DJ, this video needs to go back to the drawing board and be re-done.  Sorry, I just couldn't sit back and feel like I got a good purchase.  The flow of this video is poor.  Filler music and filler footage of cars driving down the road with music playing could have been cut and the video would be about 30 minutes and probably a better product.  I am not sure if this is a first direction by Dean J. Augustin, there is a lot to improve on here, hopefully this review will help in that regard.",1358640000,,1951,4.283378746594005
8340847,5,B001T9O6BA,"The last great DJ; Brett Dillon.  Great story about an old hippie/country dj who has radio in his blood.  Like a lot of other dying industries, radio will one day dump disc jockeys out on the street without so much as a fond farewell.  Hopefully by that time Brett will have developed other monetarily gainful interests & will be able to somewhat stay in the industry he loves so much.  Good luck to the last great dj; Brett Dillon.  Live long & prosper to a great radio station; KHYI 95.3 ""THE RANGE!""",1247702400,,502,4.413043478260869
