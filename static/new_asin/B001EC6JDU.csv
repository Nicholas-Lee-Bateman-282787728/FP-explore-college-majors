3549144,5,B001EC6JDU,I really am enjoying the Hard Core Fusion workout.  It has the right amount of intensity and challenge but isn't too overwhelming.  I think Allie is my favorite instructor with the firm because she explains things so well and is encouraging.,1256601600,,241,4.853658536585366
3549145,5,B001EC6JDU,"I usually get bored with dvd workouts very quickly and they end up gathering dust in a corner. But I've stuck with this workout for over 4 months now. Allie is a great instructor! There is a short warm up, and then the fun starts. It's a tough, challenging workout that will give you results if you stick with it. You'll sweat with the cardio and burn with the muscle toning. All you need is some dumbbells and the desire to achieve great results.",1255046400,,447,4.333333333333333
3549146,5,B001EC6JDU,I love the difficulty of this workout and the fact that all you need is 2 sets of weights.  Allie is a great instructor and the workout is very fun!,1253577600,,148,3.933333333333333
3549147,4,B001EC6JDU,"I love the Firm, and Allie Del Rio is a great instructor.  I was drenched in perspiration when I was done with this.  You can always modify if some of the exercises are strenuous.  Great workout.",1242000000,,195,4.361111111111111
3549148,5,B001EC6JDU,"I have done this workout a few times and it is getting to be one of my favorites.  It is a mix of sculpting & cardio segments.  The sculpting segments are challenging, the cardio segments are fun & different.  Allie's cuing is good, and I find her fun & motivating.",1240099200,2,265,4.26
3549149,5,B001EC6JDU,"I started out with the original Firm products and then for some reason, the ""middle years"" were not my favorites with the Transfirmers.  I really like the last two that I've purchased.
Alli is a very detailed instructor. The DVD starts with a warm-up and then the workout is a mixture of sculpting with weights, aerobic dance, and toning without weights.  The total workout (about 55 minutes) includes upper/lower body combos and also a modifier for the beginning exerciser.
Alli keeps the workout fun and interesting without being too ""cheerleady.""
The routine is not overly choreographed, but not a bootcamp style either.
I will add this one to my rotation.",1239321600,14,659,4.9818181818181815
3549150,5,B001EC6JDU,"Hard Core Fusion is a fun workout that will make you sweat. This workout is full of squats/lunges, so if you have bad knees, I don't recommend it.  You need two sets of weights; light and medium.  There is a full workout-55 min & an express workout 35 min.

The full workout begins with the warm-up then the segments alternate sculpting(5) & cardio(4).  Allie has a good mix of upper body exercises - lat row, curls, french press, medial delt lifts, overhead presses, push ups. Some of these are combined with lower body lunges or squats for total body exercises.  The cardio segments are fun and intense. Allie's cardio has more hip movement than I am used to.... there are a couple moves that seemed kind of goofy to me. The last segment for scultpting includes side bends and some good core and tri work.  She wraps the workout up with some awesome stretches!

I recommend this workout for beginners through intermediate-advanced. The intensity level gets high, but doesn't remain there for long. There are modifications for beginners, plus on the bonus features section on the DVD, you can choose ""Learn the Moves"". It is one of the more enjoyable workouts I've done in a while, which is why I give it 5 stars =)",1236124800,41,1216,4.627906976744186

3549152,5,B001EC6JDU,"I have always enjoyed the Firms workouts. When I first started working out years ago, the Firm was the workout I chose and saw great results. Over the years I have tried other challenging workouts, such as, tae-bo, Jillian, insanity, Chalene, which have all been great and very challenging. I wanted to go back to the firm because they had come out with new workouts that I wanted to try. I was very impressed with this one workout. It was high energy, but not a lot of high impact. I really look forward to this workout.",1434067200,,521,4.4375
3549153,5,B001EC6JDU,"I'm not really one to write reviews for things, but I feel as though these workouts deserve recognition. My first experience with The Firm was a few years ago when I decided to buy and try the Transfirmer series of workouts. I wasn't necessarily a beginner at that time, but man..those workouts kicked my butt! I then ordered the previous body sculpting series videos to rotate to avoid boredom. I had great success with them but for whatever reason, I ended up joining a local gym and the The Firm videos/step began collecting dust. Fast forward to present, a husband and almost 2 year old daughter later, I decided I needed something that worked for me at home bc trying to coordinate a toddler to your desired gym schedule isn't necessarily the easiest task (not to mention wasting so much gas). It dawned on me to re-order some of The Firm workouts, new and older DVDs; no more driving 30 minutes to the gym for me! Let me tell you, as someone who is by no means a beginner when it comes to fitness, these workouts are no joke. I got a better workout with these DVDs than I did at any class or time on the treadmill/elliptical. I HIGHLY recommend them to anyone who wants to get in shape and get there FAST. I can tell a change in my body already-they promise results in 10 workouts, but you'll see it before then. Trust me. What's also great is that you can make them as easy or as challenging as you desire-increase or decrease your weight. Either way, you'll get a great workout!",1431993600,4,1486,4.427007299270073

3549155,3,B001EC6JDU,"I just love Allie in the Total Body Toner workout.  This one is a good workout but it moves way too fast from one exercise to another. By the time my body realizes what it is doing, she is switching positions. Not my idea of an enjoyable workout, but you certainly will feel like you got some good exercise.",1428969600,4,307,4.203389830508475

3549158,1,B001EC6JDU,"This is a boring and awkward workout.  The leader and participants looks as if they are constantly contorting themselves in the most unnatural and uncomfortable positions.  I love many of the Firm workouts, but this one is not a keeper.  I regret spending the money on it.",1425081600,2,272,4.74468085106383
3549159,5,B001EC6JDU,One of my favorites.,1417564800,,20,4.25
3549160,5,B001EC6JDU,Great workout! High energy and she keeps it moving the whole time.  Even the shortened 30-minute version gave me a great calorie burn and kept me challenged. Allie is my favorite trainer,1407110400,,186,4.8125
3549161,5,B001EC6JDU,"Great workout - I love having the option of doing 35 or 55 minutes. Allie is a good instructor, and even though it's not as intense cardiovascularly as some others, that's probably good or I wouldn't be able to do 55 minutes of it! Great overall workout!",1404604800,,254,4.425531914893617
3549162,5,B001EC6JDU,"I love any workout from Allie and this one is no different! from beginning to end this is a fun workout that keeps you going, I also like the option to do the short workout for those days when you are pressed for time because you can still manage to get in a great workout!",1398556800,,273,3.981818181818182
3549163,5,B001EC6JDU,This is a great workout that strengthens all areas and it's fun and easy to get the hang of.  Allie is adorable and easy to follow.,1397001600,,131,4.038461538461538
3549164,5,B001EC6JDU,First off I am a very big fan of the Firm fitness and have been working out to the firm on and off since I was 20 and now I am 30. I love this DVD and Allie as always is a great instructor . She is one of my favorite from the group. This DVD will kick your butt so be prepared for some fun challenging workout. It is long but it's well worth it for the bod you want to achieve at home with no gym membership,1392681600,,407,3.5842696629213484
3549165,5,B001EC6JDU,"After checking this out of the library consistently for over 2 years, I figured I'd better let someone else enjoy it.  Finally bought my own copy.  Allie is a polished instructor who makes her directions clear and easy to understand.  As a Firm video user for 10 years, I can testify that the claims they make are true, and highly recommend both this video and others in the Firm video library.",1390176000,,394,4.52112676056338
3549166,5,B001EC6JDU,Easy moves to follow. A good hard workout.  Allie is one of the favorites.  Stick with the firm workouts and you'll get results!,1384732800,,128,4.521739130434782
3549167,5,B001EC6JDU,I like this DVD. The moves are a little awkward at first but after you get the sequence they are fun and challenging without being too much and I still feel like I get a good workout.,1384214400,,183,3.972972972972973
3549168,5,B001EC6JDU,"I have come back to The Firm after taking some time off for a hip surgery (not exercise related; I'm just poorly assembled).  I wanted to get back into shape while minimizing the risk of re-injury, so I was hesitant to use my old Firm videos with the fanny lifter.  This video really hits the spot.  As usual, they provide modified versions of the higher impact moves, which is very helpful.  I made some further modifications, like staying in place for lunges instead of stepping forward onto the same foot for each rep, to minimize jarring of my hips and knees.

Allie is my favorite Firm instructor.  I'm glad she's still around.",1381363200,,632,4.598214285714286
3549169,5,B001EC6JDU,"I like this workout.  There are two versions - the long and the short.  I've done both and prefer the short (30 minutes), mostly because my time is limited.  I'll add some time on the treadmill or elliptical before I start - it adds some cardio time and helps warm up the muscles a bit more.  Allie's a good instructor.  I prefer her workouts - the cuing is easy to follow and she's upbeat.",1377475200,,390,4.216216216216216
3549170,3,B001EC6JDU,"There is a lot of ""dancing"" type moves and that is something that does not interest me.  I like simple steps and moves.  I gave it three stars because I did like the waistline work.  These were new moves to me and they really do work.",1375660800,9,234,4.043478260869565
3549171,5,B001EC6JDU,She is my favorite firm instructor. She works you hard and encourages you through it all. Keep following her. I've lost 50 lbs doing with her cheering me on every step of the way. I lost my tapes in a move and am replacing my favorite ones.,1374537600,,240,4.127659574468085
3549172,5,B001EC6JDU,"I reviewed most of these before buying via Gaiam (thankfully) so I knew which were worth the money and which were not. The Hard Core Fusion,  Get Chisel'd, and Body Crunch are the best in my opinion! These are ""fusion"" workouts, meaning they are circuits (cycles between resistance with hand weights and cardio without weights). These are not just for the young, I am 52 years old (regular workouts in the last 1.5 years) and I hang with them just fine (although I often do the low option when they get to higher outputs regarding knees, but there is always a ""low"" option shown!). I have many workout DVD's, and these are some of my go to DVD's on the 1-2 days a week I use weights with my workout. You won't be disappointed. Really.",1363478400,9,734,4.437037037037037
3549173,5,B001EC6JDU,"I love anything Allie does and I do this one usually once a week. The complete version is 55 minutes, very intense but easy enough for a 61 year-old llike me. Highly recommended. There is a shorter version included as well.",1357603200,2,223,4.463414634146342
3549174,5,B001EC6JDU,Had this before and re-ordered because I gave it away. I love how I feel afterwards and won't make that mistake again. I recieved it as promised. new and it great condition.,1354233600,,173,4.4375
3549175,5,B001EC6JDU,"The Firm is a great way to work out. Met my expectations and more. It is easy to follow, working with weights, you get a great work out and it is actually a lot of fun.",1347753600,,168,3.6944444444444446
3549176,5,B001EC6JDU,"Just did this video this morning and absolutely loved it!  Allie has been around for awhile and is very, very good and cueing (even fast-paced)and mixing up the moves!

There are tons of lunges in the video, so you really have to be careful and watch your form, but you will feel them working.  There was also plenty of arm work, and also cardio.

This will defnitely be a good go-to video form me when I want to get everything done in an hour, since the video is just short - 55 minutes.

Allison was the instructor to watch for beginners and I know I also ""act"" as a beginner when doing a video for the first time.  She really modifies the moves well but you can get your heart rate up even following her and without the weights.

I have beend doing the firm consistently for 6 months now and this was a new purchase for me to mix things up a little and I bought it based on the awesome reviews.  I certianly don't regret it and can't wait to do it again!

Thanks for all the great reviews, and thank you to Allie and The Firm for this awesome video that will help me stay in shape while in the comfort of my own home!!",1341878400,2,1121,4.105504587155964
3549177,5,B001EC6JDU,"I was using this dvd and a few others last year before i got preggers last year and it is a nice workout. The express workout was the only part I ever used due to constraints on time and it's a nice high energy little diddy :-) I just purchased the 'thin in 30' set, hope the results are as gratifying :-)
oh why did i only use the express? It has pretty much everything needed in about a 25 minute workout so why spend an extra 20 minutes to get the same results? Work harder in the shorter period instead of ""slow walkin'",1323993600,,523,4.038461538461538

3549179,5,B001EC6JDU,I really love this workout.  I like that it has both cardio and weights.  The weights section is challenging-- usually the next day I can feel it in my hamstrings.  Ali is one of my favorite instructors and does a really good job in this one.,1300320000,,242,4.217391304347826
3549180,3,B001EC6JDU,"I really like The Firm workouts and I really like Allie -- she's a great instructor.  I was really disappointed with this workout and I'm not sure why it got such great reviews.  The intensity is just not there -- this is a very low impact workout -- my heart rate never got up there at all.  Toward the end I was yawning.  I am an advanced exerciser though so I want challenges.  Also, the moves are very different.  There are a bunch of dance moves which, to be honest, I didn't care for.  I want a workout, not a dance class.  I want a workout that helps me burn calories and makes my heart stronger.  This workout doesn't do that at all.  I like my weekend workouts to be a little less intense; so that is what I will use this for.  I'm looking forward to doing Calorie Explosion which looks much more intense.  Here are a few of my favorite Firm workouts:  500 Calorie Workout, Pump, Jump n' Jab, Cardio Sculpt, Bootcamp Maximum Calorie Burn, Cardio Burn Plus Abs, Get Chisle'd, Fast & Firm Series: Hips, Thighs and Abs, The Transfirmer Supercharged Sculpting, and Ultimate Calorie Blaster (an oldie but a goodie).  I recommend these workouts to get you super-fit.  They are also safe; no injuries wanted.  Overall, I wouldn't get this video unless you're looking for really low impact.",1299715200,19,1291,4.5
3549181,4,B001EC6JDU,"I purchased this DVD in a case that came with three others - Hardcore Fusion, Cardio Party, and Cardio-Overdrive.  This video is a nice blend of cardio and toning with weights (5, 8, and 10 pounds).  There are a few odd cues here and there, which tripped me up the first time around.  I've done the video about 10 times since then and I have no problem with the cuing.  I am certainly stronger now!  This was a great way to get me from sitting on the couch to having more energy and stamina.  Recommended if you're bored of beginner videos.",1297728000,3,540,4.297029702970297
3549182,4,B001EC6JDU,"I really enjoyed this one. The cardio was not very challenging, but I liked the dance moves, which I found fun and fairly easy to follow. I really liked Ali's energy, though I was a little bugged by the constant smiles of the other participants, which I find creepy; I don't generally smile nonstop when I'm working out. The strength training was good, and the 55 minutes flew by. So all in all, a fun, effective workout probably more geared to beginners.",1295395200,2,455,4.560975609756097
3549183,2,B001EC6JDU,"I am always looking for new FIRM dvds. I have never had one with Ali as an instructor so I bought this one based on Amazon reviews. I did not care for it. First, Ali is very nice but not a great instructor. She miscues or cues too late, and her voice is very sing-songy and annoying. I know that isn't relevant to the workout, but it was something that really got on my nerves. Second, this dvd recycles many of the moves you see in other FIRM workouts. There are very few new moves and even the supporting cast looks kinda bored. Third, this workout just did not get my heart rate up. I used 5 and 8 lbs weights and still was barely challenged, and believe me, I'm no bodybuilder. There is one segment where you do weird dance moves that are not only silly but also ineffective. I was definitely disappointed with this workout. I would only suggest it for beginners and even then, you might be annoyed.",1283212800,4,903,4.286549707602339

I've been doing the Firm workouts for years, but had a hard time being able to keep up with the cardio portions of this workout due to the unfamiliar moves. I did this workout after having done Jackie Warner's Power Circuit Training the day before, and Hard Core Fusion didn't feel like I was working much of anything. I think I'm hooked on Jackie Warner's training, and I can already see results of it. Very disappointed in this purchase.",1265760000,,517,4.51063829787234
3549187,5,B001EC6JDU,"I highly recommend The Firm workouts for women.  I bought the starter kit, this DVD and a few others.  I love the variation of the workouts and the fact that they get every inch of me.  They are fun and effective.  Be prepared to sweat and firm up.",1264982400,,248,4.104166666666667
3549188,4,B001EC6JDU,"I have tried a few Firm videos in the past, but it is not my normal workout regime.  I do a variety of workouts from cardio, pilates, yoga, step, kickboxing & dance (and just about anything else that I can do to keep it interesting).  This video had many good points.  I felt the cardio and toning fusion was good, maybe not extremely challenging, but still good, often working biceps along with quads, etc. to get in extra calorie burning by working two muscle groups together. Allie Del Rio Pointer is a good instructor who cues the moves well and shows good form, reminding you when to keep your back straight or when you need to concentrate on a specific element of the exercise.

For people familiar with the firm, she uses their weight sets, light and medium hand-weights.  For those of us not as familiar with the firm we are a bit lost as to what constitutes a light or medium weight.  I used a 5 lb weight throughout the workout knowing that my last reps should be starting to tire my muscle.  If you are tired early, I would go down a notch if you are new to weights.  You will need to gauge for yourself how much or how little weight you would like to use.  There is also one exerciser who works with no weights and just her own body resistance.  This is also an option and you will still get a good workout if you are just beginning.

There are two workouts in this dvd.  The main workout is 56 minutes long with a 5 minute warm-up, 49 minute cardio and toning segment and 2 minute cooldown.  The express workout is the same sequences, cut into a shorter workout which lasts approx. 35 minutes.  When you are stretched for time this will give you a nice workout to get you energized for your day.

Overall, good workout, but an intermediate exerciser may tire of the routine rather easily.  If you are beginner/intermediate this would be a nice way to start burning some fat and working on some muscle tone.",1263513600,,1919,4.378531073446328
3549189,4,B001EC6JDU,"I'll be the first to admit that most of the Firm fitness dvds trip me up because they tend to shout out the cueing while it's happening and use their own terms for certain workout moves (i.e. ""funky biceps"" etc.) so that you can sometimes get tripped up unless you do the Firm dvds often and know the moves and move names or unless you don't have a large collection of dvds so that you can learn how to do them via memorizing.

I mention this because if you feel like you should shove aside all the Firm dvds if you, too, might get lost during some of them...think again on this one. It packs a punch and is easy to follow along.  I really like it!

CALORIC BURN: I wear a bodybugg (aka GoWear Fit) to monitor my daily caloric expenditure. This also tells me how many calories I burn per minute during a workout and how many I burn total during a workout. I mention this only so that you know what I say is based upon scientific measurement rather than perceived exertion...although I have a large library of dvds that I work out to, this is an excellent one and rated well for caloric burn, strength moves (to build muscle) and some cardio thrown in (to up the caloric expenditure).

TRAINER: She is really good, comfortable in front of the camera, personable, and energetic

SAFETY: Excellent instruction so that you not only do the moves right for optimum results, but that you do the moves safely.

MUSIC: Firm music is always upbeat and flows smoothly to the rhythm of your moves

WEIGHTS: Although Firm dvds always suggest various weights (light, medium, heavy) I always just use my medium weights...you decide what you need. I actually have their whole weight set so it's not that I am against buying all the tools they suggest, but always just use 6-7 lb weights during moves and have excellent results. So just know you can.

FOCUS: strength training but gets your heart rate up with some cardio. Great combo.

CUEING: It's actually some of the best cueing Firm offers...However, still, in the cardio portions there are some places those less coordinated may get a little tripped up but I promise you I have two left feet and I love this dvd so don't let this scare you off...I honestly think anyone can do it.  I WISH they'd get some cueing comparable to some other dvds I have where there is just no doubt in your mind what the next move is and how to do it but I rarely keep a Firm dvd that I try and I seriously REALLY like this one...so this is no big deal. The cueing is EXCELLENT for the strength training moves and that is what the dvd focuses on mostly anyway.

BACK UP TEAM: The usual Firm team, very cute and motivating.

LEVEL: For any level. Beginners follow one trainer and you just add more weights as you advance so anyone can do it.

CONCLUSION:
You'll see results with this one, regardless of your level and it's a joy to do with an excellent trainer who is very motivating.",1258675200,49,2901,4.410112359550562

Two days ago, I finally got the courage and ambition to do the full 57 minute version, and I liked it a lot. I can't give it a perfect 5 stars because this video can't really be done by beginners. I know because I tried it when I weighed 224 pounds, and I needed frequent breaks to get it done. Also, even 42 pounds lighter, I struggle to keep up with the cardio dance moves (for example, the slice and the hip bump near the end of the workout).

I love Hard Core Fusion because it's fun to do and is constantly changing, which alleviates boredom. Allie hits all of the muscle groups and keeps the cardio intervals interesting. This is my second copy of Hard Core Fusion. Wore out the first!",1487721600,,384,4.833333333333333
