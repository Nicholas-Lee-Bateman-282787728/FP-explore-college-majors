8646745,4,B000R17Y8S,"This is an enchanting collection of music and visual entertainment.  I enjoy a variety of music, but have rarely heard solo harp till I met Jane Overgard's husband through my work.  I was delighted to discover what a talented harpist Jane is and looked forward to being able to take some of her music home on CD.  This DVD is better than I'd hoped for.  The acompanying video is a nice complement to the music: serene, but engaging images with even a bit of humor.  I especially enjoyed being able to watch how the harp is played.

This is good music to listen to and to share.",1180828800,,577,4.345794392523365
