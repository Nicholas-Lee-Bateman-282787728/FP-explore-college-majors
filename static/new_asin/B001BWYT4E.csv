3499744,5,B001BWYT4E,"The pacing of this film is superb. It peels away layers of the legendary artist to reveal a Salvador Dali whose public persona was much different than his core personality. Like any great documentary it educates through enticing visual imagery. I was amazed by the amount of rare footage in the film. Most of it I had never even heard of, let alone seen. Just coming up with all this footage must have taken years. This was truly a labor of love and it shows.  The clips of Dali are stunning, but equally poignant are the interviews with Nobel prize winning scientists pouring out their reverence for Salvador Dali.  Like getting to hang out with the cool kid in high school, they were downright enthusiastic to have known Dali

It was suprising to see J.D. Watson, who with Crick discovered the structure of DNA, refer to himself as the second smartest man in the world, second only to Salvador Dali.  This is a most unusual art documentary in that it moves like a feature film. I was expecting your typical boring narrator, but instead the the film is narrated by an American, Dali.com  expert Joe Nuzzolo who has a strong grasp of the Dali vernacular.  This is the best art film I have ever seen.  5 stars",1219276800,,1208,4.539170506912442

Though as we watched it, I found myself completely immersed in the film which reinvented and reinvigorated my appreciation of Dali and his art. The film showed a side of the artist which I never would have imagined: his intense passion, knowledge, and thirst for more insight into the astounding minds of renowned scientists and how this affected his art. I was also pleasantly surprised by the narration, Joe Nuzzolo, an American, who narrated in such a way which was unobtrusive to the enjoyment of the film and yet so pertinent to my enjoyment of the film. This is one of the best and intriguing documentaries about an artist I have ever seen and I highly recommend it to any Dali fan and also anyone who is even remotely interested in Salvador Dali.",1219276800,,844,4.633333333333334

3499747,5,B001BWYT4E,"This is truly a remarkable film that reveals so much about the genius of Salvador Dali.  It introduces us to concepts that composed the thinking and art of this remarkable man.

While he was well-read, his tremendous knowledge of science and the working of the human mind was mainly intuitive, allowing him to create work never before seen by his critics.  It was the inability of his contemporary art critics and historians to comprehend the meaning and importance of Dali's art that led them, in self-defense, to consider him to be an irreverent fool or buffoon.

This important documentary should help establish Dali's true contribution to art history, as we can better recognize his genius today, than could his contemporary critics.

3499748,5,B001BWYT4E,"REVIEW OF THE DALI DIMENSION

I am a thoughtful person with a deep interest in modern science.  At the same time I love art, especially Dali's.

I often ask myself ""What is this great artist trying to tell me?  What possessed him to create these perplexing yet exhilarating images?""

I was elated to discover that this DVD ""The Dali Dimension"" definitively answers these questions that burn inside me.  Its subtitle ""Decoding the Mind of a Genius"" told me exactly what this wonderful film actually did for me.

I learned that throughout his life Dali was caught up in the most advanced intellectual developments of his age.  In the late 1920's and 1930's his passion to gain the higher understanding that I myself seek made him study psychoanalysis, the most revolutionary and liberating development of those decades.

As this DVD points out he even gained an audience with Sigmund Freud, the father and high priest of psychoanalysis.  That Viennese genius recognized the artist as a quintessential Spaniard as well as a fanatic.  Indeed Dali was a fanatic, as I hope I am, when it comes to the gaining of wisdom and tp immersing myself in the highest of high art!

By the 1940's, after the detonation of the atomic bomb, Dali transferred his intellectual allegiance from Freud to Einstein, Shroedinger, and Heisenberg. He came to see mathematics, nuclear and quantum physics as the gateways to our intellectual salvation -- with Dali himself as our artistic Savior.

What blew me away about ""he Dali Dimension"" was its showing exactly how Dali, one of the greatest modern artists, translated the most important scientific principles of our age into dazzlingly beautiful artistic images.  Presenting painting after painting the film's expert narration introduced me to numerous geometric forms such as the tetrahedron which Dali had precisely depicted in order to uplift our intellects into the stratosphere of higher understanding.

I was especially struck by the narration here.  This is provided by the film's star, Joseph Nuzzolo.  His commentary is ultra accessible.  It provides nothing less than oversight to the whole DVD, particularly to its dramatic nuances and keeps the film moving at a brisk and wonderfully compelling pace.

I found that another appealing aspect of the DVD is its using the artist himself as well as famous scientists such as James Watson, a friend of Dali's and co-discoverer of DNA, and preeminent art scholars like Dawn Ades, the world's leading academic expert on Dali, to help us understand and appreciate the dozens of paintings presented.  Seeing so many Dali masterpieces at one time is in itself a transforming and uplifting experience.

I can only say that anyone who has an interest in Dali, modern art or 20th Century science --and even life-- owes it to him- or herself to watch this DVD.  I have no doubt that if he'd live to see it, Dali himself would have loved ""The Dali Dimension.""",1218412800,24,2930,4.98559670781893
3499749,5,B001BWYT4E,"The Dali Dimension: Decoding the Mind of a Genius

By Paul Chimera

One of the benefits of the passage of time, especially when it comes to as controversial and flamboyant a personality as Spanish Surrealist Master Salvador Dali, is that it allows us to gain perspective, jettison trivial side-show nonsense, and focus more appropriately on the serious body of work the artist has left behind.

If, therefore, you're looking for a lot of crazy, zany, performance-art antics from the madcap limp watchman of Surrealism, you're going to be a little disappointed. Refreshingly, this 75-minute documentary brilliantly shines a light on the more serious side of the Catalan painter, whose thoughts and creative expressions were deeply steeped in science.

Don't misunderstand, however. It would be impossible to have Salvador Dali the scientifically minded genius and painter, without also having Salvador Dali the eccentric showman. Each side of his personality fed the other, and what's that they say about the oh-so-fine line between madness and genius?

But The Dali Dimension: Decoding the Mind of a Genius is a long overdue treatment of Dali's career as it set out to harness, in a serious and inventive way, the various discoveries and phenomenon we've gained from the scientific community.

Personally, I think this is the best documentary ever made about Dali, and credit goes to filmmakers Joan Ubeda, Susi Marques, and Eli Pons, plus narrator Joseph Nuzzolo, president of The Salvador Dali Society, Inc. ([...] whose organization holds exclusive North American distribution rights to the film.

The video is heavy on classical music, making the presentation nearly as impressive on an auditory level as on a visual one. ""The words and concepts used by scientists and the way they talked - it was like violin music to him,"" a co-narrator declares, adding that musical notes have a direct relationship with numbers: the numbers are science, the sound is art. You'll get more insights about that metaphor when you watch the film.

There are appearances from the likes of J.D. Watson, who together with Frederick Crick unraveled the double-helix genetic structure of the DNA molecule, and discusses the concept before Dali's monumental canvas, Galacidalicidesoxyribonucleicacid - a jaw-breaker of a moniker and the longest single-word title of any Dali painting. A delightful anecdote informs us that Watson once sent a letter to Dali, announcing, ""The second brightest man in the world wishes to meet the brightest.""

Great stuff!

We also learn how Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and theories of quantum mechanics suggest that relativity is determined by what the observer decides to observe. ""Certain information always slips through our fingers, no matter how hard we seek it,"" we're told, and that realization must have greatly inspired Dali.

Rare footage abounds in this documentary, which - while intelligently focused on the serious scientific nexus between the laboratory and the studio - is smartly entertaining. This is not a college lecture hall with microphone and camera turned on, but rather a fast-paced, richly nuanced production that paints a picture of Dali as a man of science, while never losing the importance of pacing and drama that keep viewers wide awake in their seats.

If it were a book, it would not only be profoundly informative but simply a darn good read!

I was positively enthralled to see Dali in front of his breathtaking painting, The Sacrament of the Last Supper - one of his most famous works - explaining how he applied Rumanian mathematician Matila Gyka's principles of the Golden Section to the construction of this uber-precise oil on canvas. Standing with him is a man immortalized in a portrait by Dali: Chester Dale, the great collector of French Impressionist paintings, who donated Dali's Crucifixion to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Speaking of Crucifixion, which incorporates a hypercube fusing with the body of Christ, there's one scene in The Dali Dimension where Thomas Bonchott - a mathematician friend of Dali's and a pioneer in computer-generated images - discusses a paper hypercube. Narrator Nuzzolo reminds us, with a distinct passion and measured sense of drama in his voice, that ""Dali had already painted a hypercube"" 20 years earlier - suggesting how far ahead of his time the artist had always been.

The documentary transports us to Pubol, a town near Dali's Port Lligat home and of which he was officially named Marquis, and we're exposed to a brief explanation of Rene Thom's Catastrophe Theory. The curves of Thom's equation were depicted in what is considered Dali's last painting: The Swallow's Tail.

It's truly fascinating to observe, often for the first time, how this film shows us the direct connections between Dali's works and the scientific findings that influenced them.

One eye-opening highlight of The Dali Dimension is a congress of researchers who convened at the Teatru-Museu Dali (Dali-Theatre Museum) in Figueres, Spain, in 1985 - an important event Dali observed intently via closed-circuit TV, as he sat in his special room contiguous with the museum's grand foyer. The milestone event - which I had never known about or seen prior to the screening of this documentary - was organized by physicists from the University of Barcelona. The experts discussed Dali's immortal soft watches and the painter's creative debt to Albert Einstein and Sigmund Freud.

Sprinkled throughout The Dali Dimension: Decoding the Mind of a Genius are such scenes as workers unwrapping Dali's immense The Madonna of Port Lligat, which had to be hoisted through an upper floor window of the Carstairs Gallery when it arrived in New York from Europe; Dali discussing his thoughts about the genetic code; part of a revealing and amusing interview with journalist Mike Wallace; a glimpse of Dali's iconic Christ of St. John of the Cross being dusted off prior to an exhibition; and various views of Dali and the enigmatic Gala Dali, his wife, muse and leading model.

Little wonder this film took first prize in the Tele Film Festival in the Czech Republic in 2006, among a handful of other important industry honors. At the end, we see the Maestro himself - old, weak, but deeply grateful, who, over a TV screen, declares to the congress of physicists, artists and others at his Teatru-Museu Dali: ""Thank you, my dear friends, for according me this great honor.""

I've seen most every documentary film on Salvador Dali. This one, in my considered judgment, is the best.

It was a bit sad to see Dali here, not too long before he died, and so weak. This DVD may even go over some heads, so if you hate science, you might be bored.",1274918400,3,484,4.21505376344086

I've been an avid Dali supporter for most of my years and it warms my heart to see the most ""rational"" & ""Apollonian"" facets of Dali's genius so clearly demonstrated in language the layperson can fairly easily follow...

And HAIL the EXTRAS! What a treat to get to see Antoni Pitxot expound upon Dali's ravenous hunger for scientifc broadside, treatise and theory! Here is a profound gentleman and great artist in his own right...

This is LONG LONG overdue, and the hilarious thing is it just BEGINS to explicate the riches mined by SD.

3499757,5,B001BWYT4E,"I have a background in science, but know relatively little about the art world. All I ever associated Dali with was the image of melting watches. When a friend suggested I watch this DVD, I didn't know what to expect.
  The documentary is pretty impressive. I learned quite a lot about the man and the motivation behind his work, and gained an appreciation for what he set out to do.
  Dali fans will be enlightened, and those not familiar with his work should develop a strong curiosity to see and learn more of it.",1222819200,,516,4.457446808510638
3499758,4,B001BWYT4E,"This 50-odd minute documentary doesn't so much look at the life of this often misunderstood genius, but rather it looks closely at the Catalan painter's ties, affiliations, and inspirations from more scientific realms. Beyond being the most widely-recognized and famous of the surrealists, Dali's dalliances and friendships with leading scholars from all fields -- scientists, mathematicians, philosophers, and quantum physicists -- inspired his own art as he searched for common threads between all of life's subjects, both scholarly and literally. From DNA to the subconscious mind, Dali was simultaneously student, fan, and visual accompaniment/co-conspirator.

'The Dali Dimension' is a fine portrait of the man who continually re-invented his work as he learned, grew, and metamorphosed though his storied and eccentric life. Films of Dali, as well as interviews with those close to him show a portrait of an artist consumed by his vision and guided by science like possibly no other artist since Da Vinci.

I was initially exposed to Dali way back in my teens, and was instantly drawn into his otherworldly, fantastic dreamscapes, and the way he created worlds never before seen, and with so many hidden layers just waiting to be unpeeled and deciphered. I believe he was truly one of the great minds/souls of this (last) century, and his paintings are still magickal in most profound ways, to me.",1220486400,,1403,5.286995515695067
3499759,5,B001BWYT4E,"From Freud's psychoanalysis and Einstein's theory of relativity, to the splitting of the atom, Salvador Dali was obsessed with the scientific discoveries of his time.  Dali Dimension: Decoding the Mind of a Genius is a multiple award winning film that delves into the psyche of the most important Surrealist artist who ever lived.

J.D Watson, who together with Francis Crick discovered the structure of DNA, sent a letter to Dali, declaring that ""the second brightest man in the world would like to meet the brightest.""

In this 75 minute DVD we are taken into the realm that no other Dali depiction has taken us, into the scientific underpinnings of the artist's work and the mind that created them. It is narrated by Joseph Nuzzolo, the president of the Salvador Dali Society, who does a very good job of guiding us through the complex person that was Salvador Dali.

Throughout the video I was amazed how much Dali was into the science of the time and how he pursued meeting these men of science. One of the highlights of the film was when, in 1985, Dali gathered an unprecedented congress of scientists and researchers who convened at the Teatru-Museu Dali in Figueres, Spain to discuss various scientific theories and discoveries. Dali, who was too ill to attend directly, watched the proceedings via closed-circuit TV while sequestered in the Torre Galatea adjacent to the museum. You could see the awe and admiration these scientists had for the artist when they were allowed to visit with him. Keep in mind he was tethered to a feeding tube and very weak, but he still possessed a spryness of mind.

As I said in my full review on Blogcritics.org, there are also a number of extras in which those close to Dali explore some of the aspect of his fascination. The topics include the origin of life, the golden mean, holography, antimatter, and the hypercube. All that I can say is do yourself a favor and see Dali Dimension: Decoding the Mind of a Genius.",1220486400,,1962,4.758823529411765

8285029,4,B001BWYT4E,"This prizewinning 2004 documentary, created by the Salvador Dali Society and narrated by its then president, Joseph Nuzzolo,  focuses on only one dimension or aspect of the famous Surrealist artist, but it is certainly an interesting one: Dalis fascination with science, including psychoanalysis, relativity theory, DNA and genetics, mathematics, and nuclear physics. It includes short excerpts of interviews with Dali, comments from scientists (including several Nobel Prize winners) who met him, and scenes from a special concert and meeting of scientists held at Dalis home in his honor during the last years of his life; he was too ill to join the festivities in person, but he watched them on closed-circuit TV. It also shows Dali works that were influenced by imagery and ideas from the various scientific disciplines he followed. Subtitles are provided, not only for speakers in languages other than the one chosen (the DVD can be played in English, French, or Spanish), but for the heavily accented speech of Dali and some others, which is helpful.

I would like to see a more general biography of Dali and/or a more thorough survey of his work and its relationship to other Surrealist art, but this documentary does not claim to be those things. As someone who, like Dali, believes that science and art can enrich one another as alternate ways of looking at the world, I enjoyed it for what it was.",1472169600,,1407,5.0085470085470085
