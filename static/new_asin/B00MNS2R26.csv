6590505,5,B00MNS2R26,"Do you hate creeps?  Of course you do.  This neighborhood wasn't so bad until the creeps came around.  Now the neighborhood isn't as good as it used to be.  Never fear though because Death Wish, I mean Charles Bronson, I mean Paul Kersey is here to save the neighborhood and kill all the creeps.  Windows will be broken like you have never seen before.  Rocket launchers will be used for anti-personel instead of vehicle.  It's glorious and if you haven't seen it you are missing out.",1463788800,5,484,4.558139534883721
