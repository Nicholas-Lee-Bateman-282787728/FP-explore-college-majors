This came in like 10 days after I ordered it which was totally unacceptable and if I could find this somewhere else even more expensive I don't care I would get it just because of how horrible and slow they were to deliver it, I don't think they even sent it out until 2-3days AFTER I placed the order I even had to cancel the other tape I ordered from them because 4 days past and they didn't even prepare it for shipment yet, so service I give 0 out of 10 they should be closed down and never opened again.",1393372800,,770,4.14
