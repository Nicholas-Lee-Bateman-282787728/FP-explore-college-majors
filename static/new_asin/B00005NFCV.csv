1633857,5,B00005NFCV,Fabulously musical video my 2 year old grandaughter watches over and over.  Keeps her interested but not bored..me too as I watch it with her. Sometimes we even try the dance steps together.,1001030400,6,190,4.757575757575758
1633868,2,B00005NFCV,"I could overlook the weird animal characters if this movie actually did what it says - TAUGHT dance moves. It does not, at all! Instead, it just shows a group of kids doing a variety of dances - once each, at regular tempo, without even a brief description of the involved moves. It would be difficult for me, having seen, heard of, and even done some of these in the (somewhat distant) past, to keep up with most of them. It is impossible for my kids, whom I bought this for because they wanted to learn some dances.",1441929600,,517,4.285714285714286
1633869,5,B00005NFCV,"I never write reviews but I felt compelled to do so with this DVD. My son is 11 months old and is absolutely hypnotized by this DVD as soon as I turn it on, the ENTIRE show. He LOVES it and it never gets old for him. It's just something about kids singing and dancing that really gets his attention!",1439683200,,299,4.0

1633873,3,B00005NFCV,"My elementary students are preparing for a whole school dance festival, and I was hoping this would inspire them. I don't care for the silly costumed characters or the man who keeps interrupting the waltz. That will limit my viewers to my youngest students. Otherwise, the dancing is just what I was looking for.",1428019200,,312,4.796296296296297

1633878,5,B00005NFCV,Liked by both of my grandsons and I think this is my favorite !  I purchased another copy for my grandchildren in another state and they also like it !,1377475200,,151,4.033333333333333
1633879,5,B00005NFCV,Great DVD for young children to dance to and learn different styles of dance.  Great exercise too for a new mom trying to get back into shape!,1366156800,,142,4.2592592592592595
1633880,4,B00005NFCV,My daughter loves these movies.  This one is cute but not her favorite one.  Loves the Day at the Circus one best.  Well made and if toddler loves music they are great.,1365984000,,168,4.1875
1633881,2,B00005NFCV,"My kids had no interest in this one (neither did mom!) Unless you like formal dance music, this is just of no interest to little kids. Bad choice for a kids video! The ""Day at Old Macdonalds Farm"" video in this series is a lot better!",1352073600,,234,4.108695652173913
1633882,4,B00005NFCV,"Kidsongs-I Can Dance is an exciting video.  The children dancing are excellent and I really liked their choise of songs.  However I expected this to be somewhat instructional and that is not the case.  They do not show the audience how to do any of the dances and at times the camera is not focused on their feet making it impossible to follow.  But overall it is very entertaining.  Just don't expect to be able to follow what they do.  Songs include Mexican Hat Dance, Charleston, The Yellow Rose of Texas (line dance) and other old favorites.",1240963200,3,545,4.56701030927835
1633883,3,B00005NFCV,"I bought this for my two year old because she loves music and loves to dance.  I played it a few times and she still doesn't get into it.  I don't know if maybe she's just too young for this.  The music and the dancing and the quality of the video is just so-so.  The ones she really loves to watch is the HBO Classical Baby series, and I also picked up a cheap DVD from Target that's from Baby Genius and she has watched that one almost every single day.  If she's not dancing to it, she just likes to have it on in the background to listen to it.  This DVD of kid songs is probably more appropriate for older kids.",1215043200,,616,3.967479674796748
1633884,5,B00005NFCV,5 Grandkids started watching at 6 months! They all love Kidsongs!! I even like them.  The songs are the ones I learned when I was young.  Some of my grandkids are in their teens now and still enjoy watching with the younger ones.,1211241600,,229,4.3023255813953485
1633885,5,B00005NFCV,I am really enjoying the Kid's Songs series.  I was not sure about this one so I read the reviews.  They were right!!  The movie totally captures the children's attention.  I have age 4 months to age 5 enrolled at my daycare.  They were all enjoying the music and very colorful outfits.,1211068800,,286,4.423076923076923
1633886,4,B00005NFCV,"My 22 month old loves this DVD. The first time we watched it she made me hit repeat on a couple of the songs. The production quality isn't amazing (looks like a couple semi professionals taped the kids dancing all over their town); but the kids are cute, the costumes are adorable and it gets my kid up and dancing. It isn't instructional with a step by step dance lesson, but my kid wouldn't follow that anyway. There is a bonus track/promotion at the end which has short clips from their other (maybe 5 or so?) DVD's...we watch those too. I would buy another one of these. It's worth the money.",1203897600,,596,4.378378378378378
1633887,5,B00005NFCV,"Good Bye Barney, So Long Sesame Street.  Give me more of Kidsongs I can Dance.  The reviewer who was negative because the Kids were not professional dancers misses the point entirely.  He is totally off the wall.  First of all, the songs are fantastic.  The songs represent whole decades of music and dance in America.  The moves done by the Kids on the DVD are the classic moves developed over decades of American dance.  Your children will learn many, many wonderful dance moves by watching and participating with this DVD.  Moreover, the songs are just clean fun.  It is soooo, soooo important to introduce Kids to these songs before they are affected negatively by Rap and Break Dancing.  The children who dance on this DVD are so wonderful, so lovely, having soooo much fun.  That is what all of us desire for our children.  Good clean fun.  American fun.  Wholesome fun.  And all you need is a DVD player, and good speakers, and you are off to the races.  My son and I go crazy over this DVD.  He is 2.5yo and he is learning all sorts of moves from this DVD.  He is fixated by the lovely kids, boys and girls dancing together in a sweet manner, the great music rhythms of prior decades, and the wonderful costumes that change for each song.  I cannot speak highly enough of this DVD.  It is a BARGAIN at three times the price.  I will purchase all of the DVDs from this company.  We need to encourage such a company to produce more.  Goodby Barney and GoodBye Sesame Street.  Hello Kidsongs.",1196726400,4,1497,4.479553903345725
1633888,3,B00005NFCV,"This just does not catch my daughters attention at all, not one of our favorite kidsong episodes.",1175817600,2,97,4.764705882352941
1633889,5,B00005NFCV,"My three year old girl loves this video. The songs are many we grew up with which  helps when your child wants to watch it over and over. It is not instructional, but it does get her up on her feet moving about. She has learned the words to many of the songs.",1155081600,2,259,3.8867924528301887
1633890,4,B00005NFCV,"Our 3 year old daughter loves to dance and loves this tape! It has color, rhythm, and movement from beginning to end; she just has to put on her 'dancing slippers' and sing and dance along with it. This is not an instructional tape but it's engaging and features kids. Doing the Charleston with your daughter is great fun. This was an excellent value for our family. We'll look for other Kidsongs cds.",1129680000,13,401,4.506849315068493
1633891,2,B00005NFCV,"For an adult, this video is painfully bad.  For my 18-month-old daughter, it is a pure delight.  It's not good singing, it's not good dancing, and it's not good acting, but your kid will probably like it, too.  Somehow, it does actually get less irritating with repetition, which is good because my daughter wants to watch it all the time.",1129507200,15,339,4.616666666666666
1633892,3,B00005NFCV,"Decent singing and dancing, but zero instruction.  ""We'll teach you how"" actually didn't at all.  Try ""Hip Hop Shop"" to see the difference.",1127088000,6,139,5.0
1633893,5,B00005NFCV,My 4 year old daughter loves this!  She puts on her favorite dress up clothes and dances and sings along with the children on the DVD several times each week.  Definately worth the money.,1110931200,6,187,4.470588235294118
1633894,4,B00005NFCV,"This video is a very simple format, but lots of fun.  My 19 month old son enjoys all of the songs and claps and dances along to the music.  This video line doesn't have the production value of say a sesame street show or any recognizable children's characters, it's just a lot of kids singing and dancing, and that's what makes them so good.  We just purchases 6 more of the DVD's since he likes these so much.",1102809600,12,410,4.230769230769231
1633895,5,B00005NFCV,My 3 month old daughter loves this dvd.  She moves her hands and taps her feet to the music.  She even coos when her favourite songs start.  She loves the conga and the mexican hat dance. In fact she loves the entire thing.  I can't wait for her reactions when she actually is old enough to dance.,1082678400,,297,4.157894736842105
1633896,5,B00005NFCV,"This episode is awfully talented! Each Kidsongs VHS tells a story. This one is about, you guessed it! Dances! The Kidsongs Kids teach Ruby and Billy how to dance. All of the songs in this VHS are cool. The songs that are included in this adventure are:

My 3 years old baby-sitting charge Garfield can't get enough of that VHS. He and I just love to watch it! If you are a Kid-At-Heart you will love it too. I am 17 years old. ""Kidsongs"" was and still is my fave TV-Show.
Lots Of Love,

1633897,5,B00005NFCV,"The kids in these videos are so talented!!  My 14 month-old daughter loves this show, and so do I!  It is so entertaining, but mostly it is very educational.  It shows dances from different cultures, as well as from different eras of the U.S.  It is high-energy and fun to mimick!  It's nice to have this kind of music and dance in my child's viewing rather than some of the stuff on television these days.  Thank you Bruce, for producing such a fabulous array of dvd's for our children.  We love all of them.",1068422400,9,509,4.351063829787234

7947091,5,B00005NFCV,I have the VHS versions that my daughter watched over and over when she was a kid.  I decided to get the DVD versions.  They are just as great as I remember.,1492560000,,157,3.875

7947093,2,B00005NFCV,"Bought this for my 2 year old granddadughter. She likes to watch the kids dance on it, and sometimes dances along.  I bought I because I could not find anything that actually targets her age with simple dances. This video shows kids dancing several types of dances, wearing costumes typical for the dance type. I would have given this 5 stars except for 2 issues thar stood out.  One is that some of the little girls dancing in the video are wearing shirts that expose their bellies, which I do not like, and which is unnecessary.  I would not have purchased the video for my granddaughter had I known, because that is not the kind of clothing we want her to wear.  The other is that they totally messed with the waltz.  The kids are dressed up really nice and do a decent job of waltzing, but for some reason they decided to make this dance goofy, with an adult standing on a stepladder in the middle of the dancers, making strange faces and singing so loudly that it is hard even to hear the music (kind of like the drunks portrayed on old 50's movies).  My 7 yo grandson asked me why he was doing that, and I had no real answer since it was totally unnecessary and quite unpleasant.  Some of the other dances are well done; the kids look like they are having fun.  The video shows a little foot motion but does not actually teach the dances, which I knew from other reviews.  Very uneven....love some parts but others spoil the whole thing.  Needs to have a few parts removed, and then it would be a 5 star.",1456617600,,1510,4.322695035460993
