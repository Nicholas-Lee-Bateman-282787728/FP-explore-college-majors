But NO!! This episode lived up to EVERYTHING I expected of it!! The icing on the cake was the""cryptic""comment that the dying changeling whispered to Odo that sent a chill through my body:""It's too late,we're EVERYWHERE!! SUPERB episode!!",1218240000,,856,5.255474452554744
7902887,4,B000003K80,"Captain Sisko is approached by Ambassador Krajensky and informed of a coup on the Tzenkethi home world.  The Ambassadors requests the Defiant make a tour of Federation colonies near Tzenkethi space to head off any possible aggressive actions.  However, it turns out the Ambassador is really a Changeling, sent to start a war.  It certainly took the writers of DS9 a long time to get around to an episode based on the rather obvious idea of the Changelings using their shape-shifting abilities in the war between the Dominion and the Federation.  Of the course the chief fun of this episode is figuring out whose identity the Changeling has taken next as ""The Adversary"" becomes a game of cat and mouse.  I do not think this episode takes full advantage of the possibilities, especially since the Changeling's final disguise is a rather obvious choice, but it is still a decent outing for Sisko and company.",997574400,,906,4.857142857142857
