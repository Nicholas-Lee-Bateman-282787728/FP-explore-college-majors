862538,5,6304410492,"""There is an unturned key inside everybody."" So says one of this amazing films' souless and mournful characters. I saw this film right before viewing Kubricks Eyes Wide Shut and the two films share immense  similarities. Using the guise of science fiction, Director Frankenheimer  and Cinematograper James Wong Howe along with actors Rock Hudson and John  Randolph work to create a terrifying and heartbreaking portrait of life  lost. This is not an uplifting film in the slightest, of course that is  like saying the same thing about King Lear. Classic American character  actor Will Geer is the ultimate in gentile evil as the mephestopholian CEO  of a mysterious company that gives middle aged men new identities. One  cannot ever go home again is one of the many profound messages this film  slams home. Devistating and disturbing. Don't miss this!",932428800,14,852,5.071942446043166

It's hard to believe that this film received  poor reviews when it was first released. I don't want to give anything  away, but the ending is incredible.

862540,5,6304410492,"""Seconds"" is a fascinating and engrossing realistic fantasy tale that deals with the question of  the identity and above all, the  exploration of madness symbolized by the search of material  happiness and the search of eternal youth which leads to the  most claustrophobic fate. ""Please  be  yourself !"" can be the warning of this film. The innovative and the  post-expressionist  cinematography of James  Wong Howe (the use of the 9.7 mm fish-eye lens, low-key lightning, extreme  chiaroscuro, tilted low angle shots,  hand-held camera shots) combined with the stylish graphic  work of Saul Bass and a cold, taut and harsh music of Jerry  Goldsmith makes it like a Faustian  tragedy  with a Kafkaesque approach. The whole film is about distortion. The twisted  vision of  the main character trapped in his  own nightmarish world, full of ""re-borns"" and  ""employees"".  But the real nightmare  is the dreary routine of his existence. For instance, the scene of the  train  when Arthur Hamilton is reading his  newspaper and feels suddenly sick with his life. We see  very short shots of the train window and his sad face. The more  oppressive scenes are silent  just extreme  close-ups of faces. Perhaps, the best film directed by John Frankenheimer  and the  best paranoiac film ever created.  ""Classic"" is a weak word to define this masterpiece of modern  terror. ""Seconds"" is the last film of the John  Frankenheimer's paranoiac trilogy, without  forgetting : ""The Manchurian Candidate"" and ""Seven days in  may"".",925862400,4,1515,5.119834710743802

862732,4,6304410492,"The below is a review of the Criteria Collection standard definition DVD release of Seconds.

This review is on this particular release of this DVD, as opposed to the movie itself. Little will be said about the movie itself, other than to state the obvious that it is quite disturbing, well photographed and carries the message that we really cannot escape ourselves, as hard as we may try. Most people who are considering purchasing this DVD, however, probably already know this. Hence this reviewer will instead examine this particular DVD edition of the movie.

In short, the quality of the film transfer and DVD extras make this DVD worth owning. With respect to quality of the transfer, the re-mastering is magnificent. The film looks very clean and the audio too is a match in terms of quality. Considering that this is the case on the standard definition version, one can imagine the quality of the Blu-ray (probably awesome). Criteria has done an excellent job, as usual.

With respect to the DVDs extras, there are four. One involves a short on the actor Alec Baldwins views of the films. This is quite strange. Why he was selected to interview about this film instead of some well-known filmmaker or, for that matter, some professor of film history or other expert on the films of the director John Frankenheimer is quite baffling.

The second extra consists of the standard interviews with cast et al. on the making of the film. This is pretty much standard fare and in this reviewers opinions really does not add much. A third is the voice over of the commentary of the director himself over the film. This commentary was recorded some 20 or more years before the release of this particular edition of the DVD. Very interesting.

The last, most important and most interesting extra on the DVD is a 11 or so minute interview (actually more of a monologue than a give or take with an interviewer) with the director made in the early 1970s. The quality of the video leaves much to be desired but the it captures magnificently Frankenheimer the filmmaker (albeit he says nothing about his movie Seconds in it). One learns very much about his style of filmmaking, in his own words. For example, how he was inspired by Japanese painters of the 1800s (presumably Hokusai and Hirosage), other painters such as Turner and a variety of photographers. One also learns that Frankenheimer was hard on himself. He was always critical of himself and tried his best to steer himself away from hiring yes men sycophants on his crew. He emphasized this was of great importance to him and was, in Hollywood, quite difficult to do (i.e., far too many posterior kissers). He also provided some of his critiques of cinematography in films of his times. The most important of these was that there was way too much meaningless movement of cameras to no good effect. He stressed that he tried his very best to ensure that there was always a reason there should be camera movement and that was not that cameras had to be moved, paraphrasing, just because they had wheels. This 11-minute interview is pretty enlightening. Its a shame that so few Criteria DVDs do not have the equivalent (instead of the all too standard clich&eacute;s contained in interviews of stars in films, etc.).

In short, a good dvd to have of this film for its fans (and for those just interested in the director Frankenheimer himself).",1475280000,,3396,4.767006802721088

I saw this film when it  was first released in 1966. Then, I was stunned by the powerful B&W photography,  the audacity of the concept, the score, and by what I took for the bad acting. Bad acting aside, I never forgot about it.  Now, years later, I see, yes, the acting is somewhat awkward, but Rock Hudson must have felt 'somewhat' awkward in the role of a man faking his way through a life contrary to his real proclivities, with (to say the least) catastrophic consequences.. Combatting this are the pitch-perfect performances of his co-stars Will Geer, Salome Gens and Jeff Corey. I read that director John Frankenheimer (MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE) was dissatisfied with the second half of the film.  So be it.

862840,5,6304410492,"Seconds is excellent but surreal in the extreme. I think one of the people interviewed on the Special Features may have compared it to Kafka. The purpose of the distortion of the familiar word is to show how ""twisted"" our ""normal"" lives really are. The visuals are confusing and frightening, but the more frightening idea is that our workaday routines have always been this strange and we've just grown accustomed to them.

Seconds gives us a man--John Randolph--who believes he'd like a chance to be young again to pursue dreams such as painting that his business-driven life have always blocked him from. After the operation, however, his life on the West Coast as a swinging single guy is also unsatisfying.

The extras say that the movie intends to contrast West Coast and East Coast views of happiness. The problem is that, at their core, they're both materialistic and selfish. John Randolph/Rock Hudson never learned that true happiness can sometimes come from directing your love outward and doing things to help others. At his core, JR/RH only cares about self-gratification--financial and sexual--and perhaps that's the greatest horror in a movie filled with horrors.

Watch it, enjoy it, but be prepared for a movie that is uncompromising in its visual style and its criticism of contemporary American society. Also be prepared for an outstanding performance by Rock Hudson. He reminds me of an early George Clooney trying to transition from TV heartthrob to big-screen star. Alec Baldwin's commentary on his performance is especially insightful.",1454198400,,1557,5.170634920634921

The grip of the story and the cool, electrically charged performances lose nothing for their age.  And the eery and unsettling photography by James Wong Howe shows its influence in more recent efforts like ""The Insider"" and ""The Revenant.""  John Frankenheimer is famous for ""The Manchurian Candidate,"" ""The Train,"" and ""Grand Prix.""  But those stories use powerful external threats to energize themselves, like Communist brainwashing, the Nazi occupation of France, or a high-stakes international racing competition.  But here the camera and the focus of the story stays close to fears and suspicions of the leading character, played by Rock Hudson in a surprising departure from his signature roles.  Other performances by Will Geer, Salome Jens and Murray Hamilton keep the pressure up.  I give no plot details for reasons you'll hopefully soon understand.

It's SciFi strictly speaking, but Frankenheimer's intimate yet dramatic black and white makes it about as far from AVATAR as it's possible to get.

863152,4,6304410492,"As a fan of films, Im often times forwarded requests of discs to spin in my DVD player from any number of folks.  I do research every suggestion Im given, and  as do most of us  I tend to weed out a great deal of them based on my own preferences, predilections, and desires.  Plus time just won't permit me to watch and review every flick or TV show even Ive heard of, so its a constant battle of give and take.  However, as a fan of director John Frankenheimer, Ive always been interested in viewing SECONDS.  I recently picked up the solid release from the Criterion Collection, and I wanted to share a few thoughts with readers.

(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you're the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then Id encourage you to skip down to the last paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at things to come, then read on )

From the product packaging: Rock Hudson is a revelation in this sinister, science-fiction-inflected dispatch from the fractured 1960s.  SECONDS, directed by John Frankenheimer, concerns a middle-aged banker who, dissatisfied with his suburban existence, elects to undergo a strange and elaborate procedure that will grant him a new life.  Starting over in America, however, is not as easy as it sounds 

To be blunt, SECONDS is a science fiction film in much the same way that The Scooby-Doo Mysteries are horror shorts.  This is to say that it really isn't legitimate so much as it generously pilfers elements of SciFi and heftily deposits them in the first third of the feature, much in the same way Scooby-Doo really only flirts with ghosts and demons in the storys set-up; once the masks come off in the finale, those pesky kids always find a solution much closer to home than they ever do the afterlife.  Otherwise, what you're experiencing compliments of director John Frankenheimer is largely more appropriately labeled a psychological drama steeped in helpings of disillusionment.  (I don't say any of this as an insult; instead Im only trying to clarify that those coming to SECONDS believing they're witnessing the Second Coming of SciFi are apt to be as disappointed as the films character Wilson is with his predicament  both times!)

But borrow heavily from SciFi it does!

SECONDS has secret socieities.  It has new age mysticism.  It has cutting-edge science and psychology.  Heck, one could argue it even involves themes as classic in art and literature as Mary Shelleys Frankenstein because the story as constructed examines life resurrected via technology much like the Monster enjoys compliments of Victor Frankenstein.  Hudons Wilson even suffers a cruel, cruel fate at the hands of villagers masquerading as doctors when they show up in the conclusion to do what they feel is necessary to protect their secrets and lies in the only way they know best.

What else there is in SECONDS is yet another up-close-and-personal look by Frankenheimer of one of his most affecting themes: identity.  No secret to paranoid thrillers, the man had already explored much of this subject matter in two far-more-efficient pictures  THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE (1962) and SEVEN DAYS IN MAY (1964).  Clearly, MANCHURIAN (loss of individual identity) is the directors best picture (in my humble opinion); and  on this subject matter  even SEVEN DAYS (loss of institutional identity) clocks in vastly stronger than SECONDS.  Precisely because the man had quite probably said cinematically all that one need to have said about such paranoia SECONDS ends up feeling more like thirds, an interesting quandary given the fact so many scholars have christened the film the third installment in whats often called his paranoia trilogy.

As a consequence, there isn't all that much fresh, vibrant, and original to SECONDS.  To make matters marginally worse, the films middle third is bloated and lethargic, weighing down an already lengthy set-up and slowing the pace for the vastly more engaging final act which pits Wilson against his makers with an almost Hitchcockian intrigue.  If you're watching closely, then you know it isn't all going to end well, but at this juncture you cant look away.  Wilson is now ready for his second chance  having spoiled his earlier one  but life teaches us second chances rarely if ever come along that often.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  So long as you're prepared for more psychology than you can shake a stick at, SECONDS is a nice diversion.  It isn't nearly as resourceful as other films from director Frankenheimer, but keeping in perspective he made this at what mayve been a creative peak for the storyteller certainly helps keep the slow parts in perspective.  Also, Star Trek fans should keep an eye out for the lovely (and shirtless!) Salome Jens; interesting that she would appear much later in her career as the presumed head of the Founders, a near-mythical society of shapeshifters that used paranoia in much the same way the director does here.",1424304000,,5077,4.97508896797153
863153,4,6304410492,"""Seconds"" could be reasonably rated from one star to five stars. I'd like to give it five, but I've rated it four, because it's impossible to overlook its principal flaw -- Rock Hudson's serious miscasting.

Frankenheimer wanted to use the same actor for Hamilton and Wilson. Hudson accepted the role on the condition he not play Hamilton, thus obliging the casting of John Randolph, a much better actor. In his running commentary, Frankenheimer never explains why Hudson was cast in the first place. But one suspects Paramount insisted on a bankable name for such an odd and disturbing film.

Hudson was an actor -- to put it charitably -- of limited range. Had he played both roles, this wouldn't have mattered so much. Though he does a good job mimicking Randolph's speech patterns and mannerisms, you just don't believe they're the same person. This, too, might be overlooked if it weren't for the party scene, in which Wilson gets drunk and makes a fool of himself. Hudson insisted on playing the scene drunk, and Frankenheimer foolishly accommodated him. The result is amateurish and embarrassing -- and goes on much too long. Frankenheimer should have told Hudson ""When you're drunk, you lose control. And that's not acting. We'll help you through this, and you'll see how much more effective playing ""drunk"" sober is.""

Fortunately, ""Seconds"" is a blunt attack on our society's lack of meaningful values, and can be appreciated on that level, regardless of how you feel about Rock Hudson's performance (and it has a terrific Jerry Goldsmith score). It's a must-see, so it's unfortunate there's no reasonably priced home-video version. (This review is of the out-of-print MGM DVD. Picture and sound are excellent.)

Whether by accident or design, the ending is prefigured early on, though you probably won't notice this on first viewing. It's one of the most shocking endings you will //ever// see in a film. EVER.

I've seen most of the original, brilliant TZ episodes and am forever affected by many of them. So I did, like many other reviewers, feel that this was ""simply"" a TZ feature film, much like the X Files later turned out a movie. And I was able to guess how it would end, even if just several minutes before the twist was revealed. (I wish I were a more innocent viewer and could be surprised by twists these days.) But to be ""simply"" identical to The Twilight Zone is an excellent thing! I honestly have never seen Rock Hudson in anything else, but I thought he was a perfect casting choice and did an outstanding job. The final scene doesn't seem like anything too unusual or challenging, but Hudson does it so well, I'll be forever haunted by it. Maybe I'm not so jaded after all.",1417564800,,881,4.281437125748503

Critics accuse Rock Hudson for rather wooden performances. This was a real stretch for him and I think it was his best performance.
For me the test for older movies is "" Does it stand the test of time ? "". Seconds is more possible and plausible now than it was when it was made almost fifty years ago.",1411948800,3,473,4.266666666666667

863261,5,6304410492,"Get it on DVD, but regardless this is a scary, really smart one.  It's a surprise that Hudson would be in this dark film--no Doris Day or happy talk here, and he doesn't get in until perhaps a third of the way thru, and then turns out more an antihero.  At least as smart as ""Rosemarie's Baby.""  A flawed guy, he decides to go back to the old life.  But that would hurt the organization!  Can't have that.

No chainsaws, no blood, none of the current stupid SFX stuff, computer graphics, kiddie stuff.  It starts mundane in NY Grand Central commuter flow.  The protag. of the moment is suddenly handed a note, and when he reads in his train car he begins to sweat.  A new life is possible, a complete remake.  The plot develops darkly, intriguingly, more and more suspiciously--and still no Hudson.  Eventually, yes, but star power isn't needed here, just decent looks and good acting, and Hudson holds the level up commendably.  This film really should be viewed, and on DVD better, closer to as filmed.

Hard to review it well without giving away too much.  Take a chance.  It should be cheap to buy by now.  Very occas. it will be on TV.",1407542400,3,1140,4.434782608695652
863262,5,6304410492,"Occasionally referred to as one of director Frankenheimer's paranoia quartet, Seconds, even after repeated viewings, is quite unsettling.  Although it stretches credulity to breaking, this tale of a man reborn is so masterfully done as to be completely involving.  That being said, lead actor Rock Hudson, never the best choice in any of his film roles, comes as close as he ever did to mastering a character.  Will Geer, Jeff Corey - perhaps best known as a mainstay instructor at the Actor's Studio, home of method acting - Murray Hamilton, later ""Mr. Robinson"" in The Graduate; and the lovely and talented Salome Jens make for an acting showcase.",1405900800,,649,4.9907407407407405

The performances were ok and here is my problem, I won't tell you the plot or anything but I will say this, I felt like I was watching a ""Twilight Zone"" episode. Nothing special and nothing extraordinary, I knew how it would progress and end. I was torn between 2 and 3 stars and so on the basis of the talent involved, lots of familiar faces, I went for 3.

Debauchery ensues and he comes to realize ""there's no place like home"". To me, the Bacchus festival & orgy scenes are ridiculous. However, the ending is a strong statement against the death penalty by lethal injection or otherwise.

The moral of the story is that there are NO second chances. Be careful what you wish for because you just might get it. The 1945 version of ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" also comes to mind.

Of course you would! Well, Seconds is that movie, and if you haven't seen it, it's time to correct that oversight.

What if you got a truly fresh start with a second life, a new young body and new identity with complete freedom to do as you wish while retaining all the knowledge, experience, and wisdom gained from your past life? Sounds like every person's dream, doesn't it? Well, this is America with its famous 'American Dream', isn't it? The land where your dreams can come true! You can have anything you wish, but, of course, it's going to cost you. It's going to cost you through the nose.

John Frankenheimer, the same genius who brought us The Manchurian Candidate, made arguably an even better movie with Seconds, an incredible film that succeeds on every level- script, score, cinematography, acting, editing, and direction. What Frankenheimer has really done with Seconds is to fashion a sci-fi scenario that enables him to butcher the sacred cows of America - the parasitic (and in this movie, ""cannibalistic"") corporation/consumer relationship, youth obsession, and the notion of progress as an absolute good - in an extremely insightful and disturbing way. After this movie is done with you in its last frame, you will be in stunned silence from both watching a masterpiece and from doing a serious soul/gut check.

As usual, the Criterion version has some awesome extras. There is a great interview with Alec Baldwin about his friendship with Frankenheimer and his thoughts about the movie.

Sounds too good to miss? You're right. Do yourself a favor, watch this movie, and let it sink in. It could change the way you think about your life and what is truly important.",1385251200,6,1952,4.942073170731708

Wouldn't you cherish the opportunity to be free of your past? Emerge with a new and bright future ahead of you.
I'd have to think hard about it myself. Our character (Rock Hudson)is given a special invitation by a friend that will help him to do just that.  An organization that helps people get out of their current life and emerge with a new and better one does just that. Our character goes through the process of emerging and getting just what he craved a bright,new whatever he thought he wanted. However,things start to fall apart and the bright and future turn to dark and dangerous. Remember,There's a cost for everything.you'll see!

  See the movie! You'll be pleased. It's five star!!!!

863471,5,6304410492,"This was one of those movies that was ahead of it's time. Released in 1966, it's a chilling look at the lengths that futuristic corporations and entities might go for profit. Easily a five star. The ending is unexpected and shocking. Some scenes are quite graphic - even for this day and age.. Plot twists everywhere. It's a very underrated classic!",1382486400,2,349,4.737704918032787
863472,5,6304410492,"To say I was astounded by this film would be an understatement. I took a chance- I paid a lot for an obscure film I had heard nothing about. And was rewarded well beyond my investment. ""Seconds"" is not only a social statement but a time capsule of sorts. In it we can sense the heartbeat of its time, in this case 1966. In it we see a composite of ambitions that would in almost all cases fall apart- fantasy, science fiction, social critique, totalitarianism, casting of a major star, casting of obscure no-names, directorial by a controversial visionary... these are the ingredients for utter flops. It is akin to every spice on the rack thrown into a dish; typically these efforts fail miserably.

And yet Frankenheimer not only pulls it off, but gives us something that grows well over time, travels well, even in its mid-1960's trappings. We can forgive the obviousness of the storyline (although it is not at all obvious at first) and the double, if not triple-entendre of the title, ""Seconds."" I was fortunate- I knew nothing of this film and chose to keep it that way until my first viewing. That is, in almost all cases, the best context to view a film. And so it took some time for my thick head to begin understanding the definition of what `seconds' might mean. I thought of  the relatively quick amount of time it might take an individual to transform, or to wish to transform. Or the notion of a second chance. Or even the way 'seconds' is used to refer to a second helping at the dinner table.

John Randolph as Arthur Hamilton is captivating. Absolutely and unequivocally. Randolph captures the drudgery and predictability of what most would find a privileged and fortunate existence. His is the upper white crust of suburban New York, the daily train rides in and out, the dutiful wife awaiting him at the station. Why Randolph didn't go on to a major leading figure in Hollywood is beyond me. But that too, speaks to the subversive and critical light Frankenheimer offers us. It's as if the commentary was too critical, too in-your-face for the time.

Rock Hudson, and let me say now I was never his biggest fan, is remarkable. What we see in Randolph, we see its opposite in Hudson. Youth, ambition, exuberance, a wonderful future lying ahead. And yet Hudson finds a way to get the viewer to understand, outside of his physical characteristics, that in his mind he is still aging Arthur Hamilton. He still thinks like Hamilton, still feels so. Ultimately this ability to connect with his former self, or as the ""company"" would see it as his inability to let go of his former self, lands Tony Wilson, his new identity, back into a kind of office waiting room -like Purgatory.

Lesser known but equally skilled actors, many of whom I am quite fond of, give memorable performances. Will Geer, Richard Anderson, Murray Hamilton and Karl Swenson just to name a few. Hudson's love interest, Salome Jens, didn't do much for me though she is quite beautiful which is, kind of, 90% of the role. The wine-stomping orgy scene, at least for me, was unsuccessful and in my opinion the only scene that doesn't travel well through time. Still, the spirit of the scene was enough to get me through to the next scene.

Criterion's edition offers plenty of commentary from Frankenheimer himself, which I found brilliant and fascinating. There is footage of not only a 1971 interview with Frankenheimer but also a ""The making of Seconds"" documentary. This film, like all Criterion films, is not cheap. I found it to be well worth the price and have watched it five times already. Read my other reviews- I am not at all generous in offering such acclaim.",1382227200,9,3653,4.682242990654205

When viewing this, by all means turn the cell phone off, and if needs be, stop the player until you can resume.  Don't miss one moment, from the very beginning, to the very end.  This work by John Frankenheimer may well be the best directed film of all time, and where on earth were at least the Oscar nominations for John Randolph, or Salome Jens, or Jerry Goldsmith, or any nominations at all?  Now, as for the grape pressing orgy for ten minutes during the middle of the film, could this even have been an ominous warning against one Aldous Huxley and his ilk?  This might also mean that if you thought that the Satan existence religious theory was outdated, well apparently so did Mr. Ruby. Back to Huxley, was there also symbolism when Arthur Hamilton was walking through the cold storage room? Concluding, at least James Wong Howe did get an Oscar nomination for best photography, and this may have even surpassed the photography of Citizen Kane.",1377993600,3,1052,4.544973544973545
863570,5,6304410492,"...and did you ever think to identify Rock Hudson with any film with that description? Hang onto your fedora, but the Rock rocks this one wide open.  Made in 1966, before the age of biometrics, DNA analysis, etc - when men were men and corpses were ID'd by fingerprints and visual inspection only - this movie was shocking and even terrifying to the audiences of the time. It's intensely disturbing even now, although I think as much for the plot as for the sad realization that even after nearly 50 years, the same impulses, needs, fears, hopes - and greed, venality, self-absorption and evil - control even more of our lives and culture. The acting is stellar by all the characters. For a 1966 flick it's pretty fast-paced.  The ending isn't telegraphed as in so many thrillers, so you owe it to yourself to try to avoid reading the entire IMDB or Google description before you watch it.

It is like a very dark version kind of like 'Mr. Destiny' with James Belushi.  He gets his wish for money, freedom, and fame...not what at all what he thinks it will be.  I highly recommend it just for the uniqueness of its time and the very interesting 'plot', this movie has real truth in it.",1376784000,,452,4.2823529411764705
863572,5,6304410492,"This fabulous and forward looking film is the Olympic equivalent of javelin catching. Frankenheimer may have been a Liberal but he could forsee what would be roaming through the Executive branch of the Federal government, destroying this country, while the ""re-borns"" in Congress sat back and watched. The effect of the last scene in a theater, where the screen distorts and appears to fall down, was an apt ending for the ticket buyers who left the theater in stunned silence. THey had to go home and think about this; something that rarely happens anymore. Love it or hate it, you will never forget it.",1376611200,4,604,4.8173076923076925
863573,5,6304410492,"Criterion's Blu-Ray edition of Seconds features an impressive looking transfer that showcases cinematographer James Wong Howe's stunning black and white camerawork. The detail and depth of image is superb and all scratches and dirt have been removed while still preserving the filmic look.

Ported over from the out of print Paramount DVD is director John Frankenheimer's informative and frank commentary. He isn't afraid to admit the film's shortcomings, specifically its failure to connect with a mainstream audience. He also gives credit where credit is due; pointing out that it was Rock Hudson's idea to have the protagonist played by two different actors. This is an excellent and revealing commentary.

""Alec Baldwin on Seconds"" features the actor talking about Frankenheimer and the film. They had worked together on the director's last movie and Baldwin shares an entertaining anecdote about the man. He also speaks admiringly of Rock Hudson's performance, citing specific scenes that resonate.

""A Second Look"" features interviews with Frankenheimer's wife Evans and actress Salome Jens. The latter talks about how she was cast and her impressions of working with Frankenheimer. Evans shares some fantastic anecdotes about how the film came together, like how her husband wanted to cast Laurence Olivier, but the studio wanted a bigger star - hence the eventual casting of Hudson.

""Palmer and Pomerance on Seconds"" is a visual essay on the film. Scholars R. Barton Palmer and Murray Pomerance analyze the film's style and themes in detail.

There is a vintage interview with Frankenheimer from 1971 where he talks about his philosophy on filmmaking and how other art forms influenced his own work.

Finally, there is ""Hollywood on Hudson,"" a rare WNBC news special that was shot on location in Scarsdale, New Jersey. The actor briefly talks about his character and working with Frankenheimer.",1376438400,5,1903,5.3478260869565215

It is about a middle aged successful professional who becomes bored with his life.. pretty common premise, but what happens to him is not. I won't give away the story details but it is kind of film-noir-ish. And I found it to be quite entertaining. Not great, but very good.",1376352000,4,342,4.276923076923077

I love horror movies, I love sci-fi, I love 60's films, and I LOVE Rock Hudson. I was especially excited when I came here and saw that people who purchase this also love Soylent Green.

 This is no Soylent Green. It's no Logan's Run. It's like a weak episode of The Twilight Zone, but stretched out to a two hour length for no comprehensible reason. There's very little dialog, the plot isn't particularly complicated- the ORGY scene was BORING !!! How do you film a boring ORGY?

 Rock does a fabulously acted freak out scene at the end where he is screaming and thrashing about. If someone under the age of 12 saw that- I can imagine a very disturbing ""feeling"" sticking with them throughout their life. But as an adult, watching this for the first time, I was waiting for a deep twist to give meaning to the whole boring meh-fest at the end. Nope. I knew exactly what was going to happen at least half an hour before the film was finished. And that sucks.

863700,5,6304410492,"What if you could begin a brand new life?

New face.  New identity.  No past ties.

That's the choice that middle-aged New York bank executive John Randolph gets in SECONDS, an intriguing and frightening science-fiction thriller from director John Frankenheimer, which has now been released onto DVD in a new restored 4K digital film transfer by The Criterion Collection.

This film grabs you in its first moments when a total stranger approaches Randolph as he boards a subway train, and thrusts a scrap of paper into his hand.  There is only an address on the paper, yet when Randolph goes there, his life, as he knows it, ends.

The ""Company,"" as this strange organization calls itself, is in the business of giving wealthy dissatisfied people a fresh start.  Randolph, for example, seldom sees his married daughter, has only a polite relationship with his wife and his life has, for lack of a better word, become dreary.

By setting up a Company-controlled trust, which will not only provide for his family, but also insure a comfortable new existence for himself, Randolph takes the first step that will include faking his own death, undergoing extensive plastic surgery and body toning, and finally, a move to Southern California where he will take on the new identity of a successful painter, with his reputation already established by the Company.  Indeed, until Randolph can develop his own artistic style, the Company will supply interim paintings.

By this point, actor John Randolph has disappeared and his character's new guise is being portrayed by Rock Hudson, who certainly turns in his finest motion picture performance in SECONDS.

Hudson soon finds that his new life is not what he'd expected.  He feels like a fish out of water, and yearns for things past.  In a rash moment, he decides to bolt from the Company's control, yet he discovers that such an action can have horrifying consequences.

Co-starring in the superb film are Salome Jens, Will Geer, Murray Hamilton and Jeff Corey.  Extras on this Criterion edition include audio commentary by director Frankenheimer,  a new interview with actor Alec Baldwin,  excerpts from Hollywood on the Hudson, a 1965 television program featuring on-set footage and an interview with Rock Hudson, a recent ""making of"" featurette, and 1971 interview with Frankenheimer  and, of course, the usual Criterion essay-filled booklet, this one by critic David Sterritt.

863701,5,6304410492,"I had just turned 15 when I saw this film.  I believe it was part of a Saturday matinee double-feature.  I quickly forget the main feature, but not this film.  Since I was not a licensed driver at the time and had to arrange for someone to pick me up after the show, I had to stay for both features.  Otherwise, I might have left after the first main feature.  I mean after all, what did this movie have for a 15 year old boy?  It was B&W and starred Doris Day's lover boy, Rock Hudson.  Boy am I glad I had to wait for that ride home.  The film blew me away!  I'm now 61 years old and have seen thousands of movies, but this one still sticks in my mine, just like the The Manchurian Candidate in 1962, also directed by John Frankenheimer.  As an eleven year old in 1962, I didn't follow everything going on in that film, but I knew I really, really liked it.

I am so looking forward to this new DVD release of Seconds.  I haven't seen the film in many, many years.  The film dramatically changed my view of Rock Hudson.  Instead of simply waving off a movie in which he appears, I wait until I've actually watched it to judge.  That's how I found out that I also liked his performances in Ice Station Zebra (1968) and Pretty Maids All in a Row (1971).",1374105600,5,1253,4.098765432098766

863708,5,6304410492,"This extemely unorthodox film really hits hard and forces the viewer to ask many of life's deepest and most painful questions. Frankenheimer & Rock Hudson score a gigantic artistic success with the film; unfortunately financial success proved elusive and the film has languished in obscurity for over 4 decades now. Having just completed a trilogy of very commercially successful light comedies with Doris Day, Hudson was seeking the right vehicle to allow him to explore new genres. He found the right vehicle with Seconds, and turned in the best performance of his career. His acting in the final scene is so intense that it is actually difficult to watch.

It is rather ironic that Rock Hudson plays a man who's true identity is not who he appears to be, as this is the exact way Rock Hudson lived his life in Hollywood. An extemely handsome and talented actor, his public persona as a manly screen heart throb was forged by the studios and and bore little or no resemblance to the man he was in private.

Seconds demands each of us to take that painful self-test to find out if we are truly happy or not. How is happiness and satisfaction found?.... Sex? Good looks? Career? The protagonist fakes his death, and then is ""reborn"" into a new life with a new face, new body, new career, and new friends. Yet the happiness he seeks somehow still eludes him.

We never really find out exactly why he is unhappy in his new life. At first I found this lack of insight disappointing, but then I figured that perhaps there really is no specific reason or circumstance causing his unhappiness. His character may be viewed as simply being unhappy in ""attitude""; he is not thankful for the things he has, but merely longs for the things he doesn't have. Upon personal relection, I feel perhaps rebirth is something spiritual (John 3:3) and not physical. Perhaps happiness is an attitude (1Thes 5:18) and is not based on our circumstances. Perhaps the void we feel inside cannot be filled by a new job, new friends, or sex (Eccl 5:10-12), because that void was not designed to be filled by those things.

In closing, the film takes a long sharp look at the fantasy fascade that eludes most westerners. Seconds obliges each of us to take a spiritual inventory of our lives and the things we value and strive for. Please be aware that the film is extemely downbeat, and does not follow the archetypal format of: Boy Meets Girl/Boy Loses Girl/Boy Wins Girl Back. So if you are expecting a ""Doris Day"" type film, you best go rent ""Pillow Talk"". If you are looking for a deep & dark film, that is not afraid to go way outside the lines, then check this out! Be warned, the rated R version does contain some nudity (but curiously contains zero profanity or violence) and there are fun cameos by ""Grampa Walton"" from The Waltons and ""Oscar Goldman"" from the Six Million Dollar Man.",1337126400,3,2865,4.633858267716535

863812,5,6304410492,"Fascinating cult drama about an end-of-the-road, middle-aged businessman who is given an opportunity to legally expire, change face and body [including fingerprints and signature!], translocate and begin another life devoid of family and friends. Veteran 'everywhere' character actor John Randolph, plays the tired, depressed banker [Arthur Hamilton] who decides that his loving wife would be better off without him. Rock Hudson, in possibly the finest performance of his career, plays the 'reborn' Hamilton, now known as Antiochus 'Tony' Wilson.

  The second chance is provided by a clandestine organization of scientists, plastic surgeons and middlemen that seems to be primarily concerned with the successful re-identification of its clients, with its own marvelous achievements---and with the bottom line. Their clients' faked death is made possible by the company's procurement of cadaver replacements---Hamilton's replacement is burned in a fire. Actor Jeff Corey [Tom Chaney in the original TRUE GRIT, 1969] plays the group's front man---just can't trust a guy with those eyebrows and that face [remember what the boys did to informant Corey in BRUTE FORCE, 1947]. Will Geer [grandpa in TV series The Waltons, 1972-78] is perfectly cast as the group's elderly inside man. He presents a wonderfully creepy performance, with an unsettling, fixed harlequin grin and seemingly cogent interrogation that seemed to conceal an inherent evil [a similarly-flavored performance was seen two years later by actor Sydney Blackmer who played the elderly satanist neighbor, Roman Castevet, in ROSEMARY'S BABY, 1968].

  Banker Arthur Hamilton of suburban New York is now California painter Tony Wilson. The organization facilitates Wilson's lonely assimilation into his new life by bringing him together with his ""neighbors"". In addition, he meets a new lady-friend played by sultry and exotic cult actress Salome Jens. The bohemian gal pal engages him in hedonism---with group parading & singing and group nudity [the latter surprising for a 1966 mainstream flick] quite similar to the paganistic frolics in THE WICKER MAN [1973]. Later Wilson tries to party & drink his way to euphoria and harmony in his new environs but to no avail; unfortunately, the transformation did not alter memory, experience or conscience. He is not happy and decides to visit his ""widowed"" wife Emily [played by lovely Frances Reid of Days Of Our Lives soap, 1965-2009] back East under the ruse of being a friend of her ""dead"" husband. Wilson gains much insight into his mistakes and shortcomings in this bittersweet encounter, his prideful and stalwart spouse saying it all with: ""Arthur was dead long before his body was found in the fire"". Wilson now needs to return to consummate abandoned responsibilities to the only central thing in his life---his beloved Emily. He returns to the organization asking for his original identity back.

  Director John Frankenheimer [THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, 1962], Oscar-winning and legendary cinematographer James Wong Howe [also nominated for this film] and ubiquitous, legendary musician Jerry Goldsmith collaborate to give us a dysphoric, brooding perspective into the psychological terrors of modern American society. Black & white filming, mood-capturing and mood-evoking shots and locales [i.e. remember the desolate and rocky California beach] and the incongruous music all work well in propagating the living nightmare. Love those brief behind-the-head shots of the ambulating character evoking a sense of devitalization, of vulnerability and of isolation. Goldsmith's interspersed pipe-organ score lends a perverse, carnal and lurid feel to the otherwise seemingly 'safe' but sterile urban, suburban and seaside environs presented.

  The film presents a surrealistic depiction of the emptiness, and emotional/spiritual cost, of the American dream. This is about modern industrialized man---desensitized and emotionally sterilized by anxiety, fear and overwork: racing against time instead of living for the moment [spending most of his time thinking about what COULD happen instead of what IS happening]; apprehensive at the prospect of failing to fulfill economic responsibilities to his family, his job, to himself; squeezed like an orange by the economic leviathan that has programmed him since youth, until he is an automaton depleted of time, judgement and courage. Indeed, modern man's sign of election appears to be work & money, profit & things, instead of people and meaning.

 Banker Arthur Hamilton, previously denatured by fear, faithlessness and exhaustion, is now certain that the chain of events that comprise his life is not a random thing or an accidental by-product of some other massive celestial project, but determined by how he lives each moment. His fate in this film, however, is not-surprisingly determined by the same forces that made him opt for escape rather than risk self-destruction, as the organization---to remain viable---could not afford to lose another investment.",1314489600,5,5025,5.594736842105263

863814,5,6304410492,"John Frankenheimer's 1966 film ""Seconds"", starring Hollywood legend and tortured star Rock Hudson, is one of the most psychically jarring and profound films I believe I've ever seen.  A decidedly downcast meditation on happiness, identity, and who we pretend to be vs. who we really are, it has the smell of a Raymond Chandler novel coupled with an oppressive sense of Kafkaesque madness. The cinematography is claustrophobic, perfectly complimenting the atmosphere.

John Randolph plays Arthur Hamilton, an old man who has lived the archetypal American life.  A few plaques here, a few trophies there, he is perfectly successful and perfectly miserable.

In one of the scariest, most angst ridden scenes I've ever had the pleasure to witness, and old friend from his college tennis club calls him--a guy who died 10 years ago.  He informs him that there is ""always a second chance"", convinces him of his identity, and tells him to hit a small spot in the city where he can be given that second chance.

The way Frankenheimer juxtaposes the scenes of a rainy 1960's NYC with this man's entrance into an unknown bureaucratic human meat market of identity change is a testament to his mastery.  With ""Seconds"" and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Manchurian-Candidate-Special-Edition/dp/B00020X88Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Manchurian Candidate (Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;it is curious that he is often not mentioned in the same breath as other great filmmakers.

Through a series of skillfull but somehow revolting series of physical surgeries, Arthur Hamilton becomes Antiochus ""Tony"" Wilson (Rock Hudson)--an artist with a fabricated background in painting and prestigious following.

There are some touching moments in this film where Arthur/Tony becomes liberated from his rigid, conservative background and meets Salome Jens (Nora Marcus), a beautiful blonde woman who also found her life tedious and unsatisfying, thus contacting ""the Agency"" to fix it.

Unfortunately, though, a fake is a fake.  Costume jewelry is not real jewelry.  The last half hour of the film consists of an identity split--Arthur's rebellion against this pre packaged destruction of his tortured, but real identity, lands him in a most unfavorable situation indeed.

When speaking about the film, Frankenheimer often mentioned that Hudson, a known alcoholic, insisted that he actually drink when doing the scenes in which he rebels against the other people (products of ""the agency""). Hudson always controlled himself on the set of movies and never drank on set.  This was particularly important to him.

Rock Hudson died of AIDS on October 2, 1985. His entire life he had tried to suppress knowledge of his homosexuality and was largely successful, even resorting to pointing out other men in the closet like James Dean for the press.  While this film is much, much more than metaphor for repressed homosexuality, Hudson's extraordinary performance is obviously informed by this intense inner conflict.  I remember first seeing this film at the age of 15, and when rewatching it on Amazon Video On Demand I noticed that I'd forgotten nothing.  It is that powerful.

Other reviewers have successfully probed the circumstance of plot and production.  My comments here laud the otherworldly visual presentation that Frankenheimer and Howe created that seemed to extend the tools of cinematography to absolute limits.  I think that the use of B&W cameras gave Frankenheimer the lightness and flexibility to experiment in this way, a way that still shocks 4 decades later.  The use of strap-on cameras continues to jar the viewer today.

John Randolph, as Arthur Hamilton (the ""before""), is absolutely gripping in his portrayal of the disillusioned and desperate banker.  Each bead of sweat betokens his terrible conundrum (uncertain life or celibate, empty ""death"").  A monumental performance.  The supporting roles are all creepily terrific, Will Geer most notably.

Rock Hudson, on the other hand, appears totally lost as the ""after"".  The viewer looks on longingly for coherence in his performance, any kind of persuasive communication of the character's vertiginous situation.  Watch how he struggles with his facial expressions during the crucial (but failing) Malibu scenes.  Plainly way out of his depth.

863889,5,6304410492,"Many years ago, I read David Ely's book Seconds and I had long wanted to watch the 1966 film based on his book. I had high expectations for Seconds, but John Frankenheimer's film exceeded them. I highly recommend this film to any viewers who want to watch a film that forces them to think about life's inevitable frustrations.

Seconds is about a comfortable, middle-aged businessman who has become bored by life. He comes into contact with a mysterious business that makes him an offer that's too good to be true - the business will arrange to fake his death, give him extensive plastic surgery to make him look younger, and create a new identity (and life) for him. The businessman must decide whether to leave everything that is familiar in exchange for a ""second"" chance at life.

This is a different type of film. It is not the standard shoot `em up where everything is tied up in a too-neat package at the end. As a viewer, you'll have to find the answers for yourself. Specifically, the viewer must decide whether it is ever possible to start over or whether there is truth to the old saw that ""wherever you go, there you are.""

John Frankenheimer's direction in this film is very ""artsy."" He filmed in black-and-white and he makes maximum use of shadows. Also, some of the unconventional camera angles are right out of Orson Welles. Seconds has a spooky, tension-filled soundtrack that adds to the viewer's discomfort.

Critics have noted that Seconds is a bleak film. This is true, but one could argue that the film is no bleaker than life itself. The point that Ely's novel makes is that there is no easy solution to getting older and realizing that some paths are closed forever. Viewers who want simple escapism, easy answers, and car chases should avoid Seconds. For viewers who want to think, this is an amazing film.",1262131200,8,1831,4.6770186335403725

One day a phone call, a secret address is passed, and ""The Company"" has an offer to make him -- plastic surgery, exercise, new identity, new life -- your death is faked, we supply the body -- and you live newly.

863894,5,6304410492,"SECONDS is a five star film made in 1966 with Rock Hudson  which I did not see in the theaters. Made during the peak of 60's political paranoia this film was a veritable celebration of this condition. Filmed with no less than four previously black balled actors and writors, this film explored the prospects of being completely ""reborn"" with no chance of returning to normalcy or prior life.  The unusual camera work and use of distorted sets was as interesting as the plot which was basically a waking nightmare. Many of the scenes bring back memories of 60's newsreels and for some of us, 60's memories.

I found this film to have many emotional and visual similarities with a relatively recent movie, THE GAME, which also explored paranoia to the extreme.  While the depicted scenario and plot were totally different, the feelings experienced by viewers I have spoken to were very similar to THE GAME.

863895,5,6304410492,"The best damn 90-minute episode of The Twilight Zone I've ever seen! That's a compliment, by the way. A trippy, creepy masterpiece directed by John Frankenheimer at the top of his game. Middle-aged businessman finds a fountain or youth and nearly drowns in it. The best performance Rock Hudson ever gave.",1233360000,6,304,4.980392156862745
863896,5,6304410492,"More than 40 years old now, this small, darkly powerful film still packs a devastating, heartbreaking punch. The story itself is simple, and one that anyone can appreciate: a middle-aged man, vaguely dissatisfied with his supposedly successful life, is offered a second chance in a remade, rejuvenated body, complete with a new life. And of course it's a monstrously Faustian bargain, something that's made clear from the first ominous notes & disorienting graphics of the opening credits.

But it's the relentlessly oppressive tone & the fine acting that take this basic premise into nightmarish territory. For anyone who thought that Rock Hudson was only capable of lightweight comedy or soap opera melodrama, this will be a real eye-opener. He gives it his all & lays his soul bare, nakedly raw, especially in the final scenes. His despair, his anguish, his hunger for something so desperately lost & never found, burns through the screen. It's such an intense & vulnerable performance that it's almost physically unsettling to watch!

There have been complaints about the length of the vineyard scene -- but I think that drawing it out actually adds to the meaning of the film. What begins as a potential orgy, an invitation to release all inhibitions & revel in sensual pleasures, becomes something dreary & nasty as it drags on & on, revealing the spiritual emptiness beneath the facade of endless sensation & instant gratification. There's no real love to be found here, no real human connection, not even the release of genuinely earthy & healthy sex. There's only constant noise & movement to cover the unbearable truth.

And it's a truth that our doomed protagonist learns too late -- what required changing wasn't the outward appearance, but the inner man. All the plastic surgery, the fast cars, the beautiful women, the glamorous lifestyle -- all of it is hollow, if you're still the same person within, unwilling or unable to grow spiritually & emotionally. If only he could go back, try again! But there's no going back.

What's especially chilling is how the emptiness depicted so scathingly here has become a guiding principle for so much of contemporary society. The promise of a new life is even glossier today, far more glittering, as trendy & uber-hip as it could be ... but in the end, still as unsatisfying as ever, offering nothing, taking everything.

If you're looking for horror, forget the adolescent titillation of torture porn & zombies & CGI monsters - this is the real thing. For me, it's one of the finest & most frightening examinations of midlife that I've ever seen -- most highly recommended!",1233273600,25,2629,4.979498861047836

It had a great impact on me(of coures at 14, in the 1960s you'd have to be practically dead, not to be influenced by what was going on in San Fransico).  I still think about it from time to time and happened to catch it on tv the other night.  The only thing that no one seems to mention, is that John Randolph didn't have much of a choice to stay the way he was.  He was blackmailed by the ""company"" showing a black and white film of him rapeing a young woman. Still it was a great performance by Rock Hudson and the other actors or course.

It's a Faustian tale that cautions the viewer to ""be careful what you wish for, for you just might get it"".  I read the book before I ever saw the movie, and was not one bit disappointed in the film.  It follows the book pretty much to the letter.  John Randolph is transformed into Rock Hudson through a series of plastic surgeries and leaves behind his former life (and wife and career) to begin again as an artist in a southern California community.  What the character doesn't realize is that although the exterior may change, you still take with you the core of who you are.  The movie received terrible reviews when it was released, primarily because I think people wanted the Rock Hudson they knew of the Doris Day light comedies.  He plays very much against type and the movie is heavy all the way through.  I won't spoil the plot and give away too much, other than the fact that I never forgot this film though I saw it some thirty years ago and it never compromises or cheapens itself with a pat ending.  There is one very slow segment in the film that lasts about ten minutes and could have been edited out, but it's still a five star film.  It's pure science fiction without the special effects, but not at all unrealistic. It's a shame that neither Rock Hudson nor John Frankenheimer, who directed it, didn't live to see this become a cult classic that is very much appreciated nearly 40 years later.",1184544000,4,1650,4.525252525252525

Hamilton is as much a victim of his own desire to be someone else as he is of creepy company founder ""The Old Man"" (Will Geer), and Hudson portrays his character's naivet beautifully. Strong support from Jens, Randolph, and Addy, the butler who's uncomfortably keen on coaxing Hamilton to let loose and indulge himself, round out a superb cast.

863971,4,6304410492,"I watched this movie last night and I thought it was okay. The idea of having the main character change lives reminded me a lot of the Jim Carrey movie ""The Majestic"" while the ending is brilliant in which the doctors are about to torture and kill Tony Wilson/Arthur Hamition (Rock Hudson). That scene seemed to be a prelude to ""A Clockwork Orange"" five years later in which the hero (Malcolm McDowell) raises so much hell that his friends, like what happens to Rock Hudson in this movie, start to turn against them and plot to sabotage him (of course in the case of ""Orange"" McDowell's Alex is strapped and his eyelids are clamped). The opening credits from Saul Bass are also brilliant and it is almost paying homage to the credits of the Roman Polanski film of that time ""Repulsion."" But there is one thing in ""Seconds"" that wasn't brilliant: The wine vat Felliniesque orgy scene between Hudson and Salome Jens because I didn't know why it was in the movie and I never saw it coming. In his audio commentary director John Frankenhimer (dead) admitted that this really happened in Santa Barbara where they shot it and he also said that half the scene was cut out under the Catholic Church's orders. And that leads me to my dissatifaction with the MPAA: Can you believe they gave this movie for its DVD release an R rating because of the scene that I just mentioned? While at the same time they give ""The Professionals"" another 1966 movie with Burt Lancaster, a PG-13 rating for its own DVD release and yet it has more graphic female nudity/bare flesh that this movie and to push it even futher ""Blow-Up"" (also from 1966) has it share of female nudity and skin and that is NOT rated! This go to show that the rating system is a joke, it is a true child of the 60's, and it violates the first amendment for freedom of expression. Also, why is the MPAA so conservative over sex and nudity? It does lean towards censorship. Anyway, that is why I give this movie four stars and not five.",1166400000,,1984,4.483425414364641
863972,5,6304410492,"Based on a novel by David Ely, adapted for the screen by Lewis John Carlino (The Great Santini) and directed by John Frankenheimer (The Manchurian Candidate, Ronin), Seconds (1966) stars Rock Hudson (Pillow Talk, Ice Station Zebra).  Also appearing is Salome Jens (Harry's War), John Randolph (Pretty Poison), Will Geer (In Cold Blood), Jeff Corey (The Sword and the Sorcerer), Murray Hamilton (Jaws), Frances Reid (The Andromeda Strain), and Richard Anderson (Kitten with a Whip), whom I best remember as the character Oscar Goldman from the television series ""The Six Million Dollar Man"".

As the film begins we meet an aging banker named Arthur Hamilton (Randolph) preparing to take the train from the city to his home in Scarsdale.  Prior to getting on the train he's given a slip of paper containing only an address by an unknown man, followed up by a phone call later that night from a friend he thought passed away sometime ago.  The next day Arthur goes to the address, and after some cloak and dagger stuff he ends up in an innocuous office environment where he meets a man named Mr. Ruby (Corey) who makes him a fantastic offer, one that entails Arthur breaking all ties from his past and starting over again with a new identity.  After some convincing Arthur signs on, which leads various aspects including faking his own death, financial arrangements, numerous cosmetic surgical procedures and extensive physical reconditioning (that eventually turn him into Rock Hudson), and a brand new identity.  As a result, Arthur Hamilton is no more, as he's now Tony Wilson (Hudson), a bachelor and established artist who has a swank pad on a Malibu beach.  While adjusting to his new life Tony meets a blonde woman named Nora (Jens), a sort of free spirit weirdo type and the pair attend a Bacchanalia wine festival where Nora gets nekkid and dances in a vat of grapes, along with a bunch of other oddballs.  Tony may be Tony on the outside, but he's still conservative Arthur on the inside, and has difficultly letting go of inhibitions developed from his previous life (eventually Tony does seem to get into the swing of things).  Sometime later Tony throws a cocktail party, one intended to allow him to meet his neighbors (and vice versa), gets snockered, and slips back into his previous life, causing a bit of trouble with those in attendance who happened to go through the same process he did in being `reborn'.  Anyway, Tony/Arthur makes a trip back to Scarsdale to visit his widowed wife, staying in role of Tony, claiming to be a past acquaintance of Arthur's, and learns some interesting truths about himself from back when he was Arthur, which leads to Tony deciding go back to the company with the intent of starting anew again, this time wanting the freedoms he now perceives not available to him in his initial go around...turns out what he wants is possible, but there's a few catches involved resulting in an unexpected and particularly disturbing finale.

I thought this a most excellent film with a thoughtful and intelligent story and characters.  The main crux of the feature seems to be with Arthur trying to come to terms with his new identity and perceived freedoms, struggling with having to distance himself from the life he once knew after being absolved of all previous responsibilities.  On the surface it might seem easy, even favorable, but imagine cutting all ties to who you are, your family, friends, etc., and picking up somewhere else as someone completely different.  Also imagine learning exactly what people thought of you, especially those closest to you, when allowed to express their true, unadulterated feelings...keep in mind these are individuals you left behind to start a new life specifically because you felt life wasn't worth continuing under your previous identity (chances are you're going to get a perspective you might have been aware of peripherally, but never actually delved into for fear of having to actually face your own failings).  I thought the concept of a company, complete with shareholders, board members, etc., who's sole business was to provide well to do individuals with the possibility of happiness by faking their own death and starting over under a completely developed and established identity an interesting one, and I especially liked the amount of detail provided in terms of how they went about accomplishing the goal.  I thought all the performances here strong, especially Hudson, whom I had grown accustomed to seeing primarily in bedroom comedies with Doris Day.  The story here featured an uniqueness for me in that while it have specific science fiction elements, it also looked at the human condition pretty thoroughly, in terms of an individual forced to view his own life and learning that which he had been taught to strive for, ultimately did not fulfill some very basic necessities (i.e. being rich and successful doesn't necessarily to happiness...although it doesn't hurt).  The direction was certainly interesting and innovative, especially the unusual camera angles employed (there were a few shots that seemed perhaps the camera was actually mounted on the performer's shoulder).  Normally some of the shots employed would be used to create a sense of tension, but here it was more of a sense of unease, as if we were experiencing something that shouldn't be...it's difficult to explain, but perhaps it would make more sense after having watched the film.  At the very least it tended to keep things interesting.  One scene I really enjoyed, beside the ending, was when Tony/Arthur visited his former wife in the guise of Tony, and got the lowdown on himself.  While her comments about the man she believed dead weren't caustic or mean, they weren't entirely flattering, either.  She had some very perceptive ideas about her dead husband, ones she couldn't share with him when she was alive due to his distant and disconnected nature.  I thought the ending especially strong, throwing in a great twist, one I really didn't see coming, but one that fit in perfectly in terms of how the company operated.  There were some hints to the ending provided earlier in the story, but they were subtle enough not to be overly revealing.  All in all I thought this an excellent, slightly unnerving film, worth watching more than once.

The picture, presented in widescreen (2.35:1), enhanced for 16X9 TVs, looks sharp and clean, exhibiting a few minor flaws, and the Dolby Digital mono audio, available in both English and French comes through very well.  Extras include an original theatrical trailer, a commentary track by director John Frankenheimer, and English subtitles.

863973,5,6304410492,"Like the ""Manchurian Candidate,"" ""Seconds"" is one of John Frankenheimer's best works--a film that is rarely seen and relatively unknown and a far cry from the typical Rock Hudson/Doris Day vehicle made during the mid-60's.

Gritty, unsettling, and disturbing describes this tale about a married, middle-aged man (John Randolph), a Princeton grad and bank VP from Scarsdale NY, now granted a virtually new identity via a manufactured ""death"" to be ""reborn"" with plastic surgery. Enter one ""Tony Wilson"" handsome, successful, late 30-ish professional artist seeking youth, meaning, and freedom with dire consequences.

Frankenheimer's film is one that deserves multiple viewings to fully appreciate the director's subtle touches of irony inserted in to the scenes. For example when Randolph finally arrives at the clandestine organization for his appointment with Mr. Ruby (Jeff Corey) and his eventual transformation, he makes his trek through a slaughterhouse and meat packing plant ( ""Honest Abe's""), a portent of evil things to come.

The disc includes an informative full audio commentary from Frankenheimer himself, and apparently, Kirk Douglas was offered the role first, but bowed out at the last minute resulting in Hudson as the director's second choice.

Personally, what makes the film so interesting is the number of odd circumstances and loose ends presented by the film.  Some have pointed these out as a flaw, but upon repeated viewing these ""holes"" make the film's plot and character motivations more interesting and fun to discuss.

The film has a great start and a great finish.  What few problems the film has with pacing are more than compensated for by the ""suprise"" ending.

863978,3,6304410492,"Bored and alienated businessman Arthur Hamilton (John Randolph) is given a second chance at life when a mysterious organization makes him an offer he can't refuse.  Through surgery, calisthenics, a cannily staged death and a handful of craftily forged documents Hamilton is transformed into swinging bachelor Tony Wilson (Rock Hudson.)

  There's something inherently appealing about being given a second chance at life - especially if you come back as Rock Hudson circa 1966.  According to John Frankenheimer's commentary on SECONDS, though, the public wasn't buying it and the movie was a box office flop.  Those who wanted to see a Rock Hudson movie didn't want to see him in THIS kind of movie, and those who wanted to see this kind of movie didn't want to see Rock Hudson in the lead.

  Now that SECONDS is a certified Cult Classic I suppose we can dismiss the reaction of the nattering nabobs of the first wave.  In fact, Hudson is quite effective as the retooled man and provides a seamless transition from the somewhat dumpy and dour Hamilton to the buff and dour Tony Wilson.  The black-and-white photography by master cinematographer James Wong Howe is eerily disorienting.  Some of the secondary characters, especially Jeff Corey as the hard-selling Mr. Ruby and Will Geer as the folksy Old Man, are welcome infusions of life.

  That SECONDS desperately needs as many infusions of life is a problem.  Hamilton/Wilson is such a private and solitary grump it's nearly impossible to ride along with him.  When Wilson meets beautiful young Nora Marcus (Salome Jens) and crawls out of his shell and begins to Live! it should be a moment of pleasant satisfaction, at least, but Hamilton/Wilson is such a cold fish I didn't really care how many breakthroughs he achieved.

  I usually don't notice such things, but considering the stellar talent responsible for this movie SECONDS has way too many snafus and goofs - camera shadows in the shot, cameras reflected in the mirror.  I didn't notice the big continuity problem until I watched it with the commentary track.  Frankenheimer told how the right-handed actor Randolph had to learn to do many thing left-handed to match the left-handed Hudson.  The comment was made while Randolph, as Hamilton, was riding a commuter train and doing a crossword puzzle right-handed!

  There are plenty of plot twists in SECONDS and for the most part I didn't think I wasted my time watching it.  Interesting movie with an unusual bit of casting in Hudson.  Tepid recommendation.",1118275200,13,2523,4.985611510791367

SECONDS, directed by John Frankenheimer, may be perhaps one of the greatest American movies that no one has ever seen or heard of. It's obscurity is a real crime considering that the inferior (but still very good) AMERICAN BEAUTY and the absolutely wretched EYES WIDE SHUT (not to mention the bloated LAST TANGO IN PARIS) have enjoyed greater notoriety while dealing with exactly the same material.

In fact a great festival would be to show all four films together. Although one may want to shoot themselves afterword.

SECONDS, like all the great tragedies, truly is a pessimistic and depressing film on one hand, and yet, on the other hand, manages to elate the viewer in terms of the incredible mastery of storytelling craft that the filmakers John Frankenheimer and James Wong Howe so expertly display. The acting, script, direction and cinemaphotography all blend perfectly together to create a shattering and unforgettable experience.

The narrative, dealing with a middle aged suburbanite getting a chance at a new start via a shadowy company with real Satanic overtones, is filled with haunting, frightening and utterly truthfull revelations about the fragile human condition. Arthur Hamilton/Tony, the sad protagonist (expertly played by both John Randolph and Rock Hudson(!)) finds all too late that there is no place like home, and once you're gone, you're gone. This is a lesson that Hamilton/Tony doesn't learn until it is too late.

The film proposes this as a fact of our existance that ultimately we all must come to face and accept. Our choices will then lead us to either making our present state better or diving off into changing what cannot be changed: the past.

Watching this film is not escapist entertainment. It is challenging, disturbing and creepy. It is however, a work of art. Don't miss this. A 10 out of 10.",1107820800,58,1891,5.006369426751593

I must admit, the hippy bacchanalia scene now looks slightly embarrassing and feels too long - but it serves its purpose in the story.

864050,5,6304410492,"Seconds is probably the trippiest film you're likely to see.  It stars Rock Hudson as Tony, a ""reborn"" of John Randolph (one of the actors blacklisted under McCarthy).  It's ostensibly about this guy in a midlife crisis who is forced into this super secret organization that creates second lives for people by giving them new identities.  This film hit so close to home for Rock he nearly broke down during filming.
  At first glance the second chance at life looks great.  A new identity, a house on the beach, and a beautiful new girlfriend in the seemingly hippyish Nora (Salome Jens).  Then things go downhill and into a nightmarish realm.  Really the whole film is a surreal nightmare, from the meat packing district to Randolph being drugged to out-of-proportion camera lenses and strange angles.  And especially inside the reborn offices; what happens there is utterly otherworldly.  Filmed in black and white this captures an experiment in surrealism that a major director wouldn't dare attempt today.  And like all great '60s films this has a '60s feel and atmosphere to it.  Especially when Nora and Tony go to a hippy festival, though Tony feels out of place there; after all he was formerly a square banker.
  When Beach Boy Brian Wilson saw this film when it was released in 1966 he literally went insane. He believed Phil Spector was beaming him secret messages through the film to sabotage his career (the main character's last name was Wilson which may have added to his paranoia).  But for a relatively healthy viewer it won't drive you insane...but it'll definitely have an effect on you.
  If one had to pin down what this film is a metaphor for, it would have to be the old alienation of modern society theme, but here with an intense sci-fi-like twist.  A must for all Frankenheimer fans, Rock Hudson fans, and/or '60s afficionados.",1072310400,5,1853,4.828571428571428
864051,5,6304410492,"Without question, ""Seconds"" is a disturbing and unique film.  It's odd, unclassifiable, and not easily forgettable. It is also one of the few films that will upset you with each subsequent viewing.  The passing of John Hamilton gives me pause to reflect on this underrated films - one of the best dramas of the mid-1960s, and one of the best psychological thrillers ever put to film.
John Randolph is Arthur Hamilton, a man haunted by the thought of life passing him by.  Arthur is brought to a strange agency, and is given a unique opportunity: the agency will erase Arthur's old persona via a convenient faked death, perform plastic surgery, and give him a new life as a ""second"".  Rock Hudson plays Tony Wilson, his post-surgery ""second"" persona.  In his new ""second"" identity, Tony learns that a new body and new identity don't address his need for individuality.  Tony never lets go of his supreme self-centeredness, which eventually leads to his downfall.
The film settles in the pit of your stomach with several strange and unsettling scenes.  At the agency, he meets a friend who has something on his mind...he seems very intent that Arthur adopts a ""second"" identity.  When Tony awakes from surgery he is bandaged, and is told not to talk because his teeth have been removed.  As he recovers, he is given a strange personality and occupational aptitude battery (I have never trusted these after seeing this movie!)  Eventually After having too much to drink, he realizes all of his friends are fellow ""seconds"".  Tony visits his wife, who think's he's dead.  The gravity of Arthur/Tony's choice is clear; he can never go back.  Eventually Tony returns to the agency, and is asked to suggest fellow clients...he never realizes the danger of not ponying up a new candidate.  And the final scene...I won't spoil it, but you'll feel cold afterwards.
Hudson is brilliantly and presciently cast, as it was made before his sexuality was common knowledge.  It's little wonder that ""Seconds"" is recognized as Hudson's best work.  John Randolph as the gray, depressed Arthur Hamilton is overshadowed by Hudson, but his understated performance is critical to the  Hudson's portrayal as Hamilton's ""second"" chance. Never a great actor, Murray Hamilton is at his best as a frightened agency client - we know why he's nervous, but wonder why Arthur can't see it. Will Geer is eerie and unforgettable as the agency's patriarch, who waxes philosophical with his failed clients. Frankenheimer's work is brilliant.  ""Seconds"" takes a toll on it's viewers, and I find that I have to steel myself to watch this great film again.  Strongly recommended.",1061337600,13,2640,4.972665148063781
864052,5,6304410492,"The core concept of this film has special relevance almost 40 years after its initial release, given recent developments in genetic engineering: Recycling of human beings, whole or in parts. As I again watched it, I thought about several themes which have intrigued man throughout history, such as eternal youth (e.g. the fountain of youth) and unholy pacts (e.g. in the Garden of Eden and, later, Dr. Faust). Dissatisfied with his life, Arthur Hamilton (John Randolph) presents himself to The Company and agrees (for a substantial fee) to become a different person and have a lifestyle about which he has obviously fantasized for many years. After extensive surgery, he becomes Antiochus (""Tony"") Wilson (Rock Hudson), twenty years younger, strikingly handsome, physically fit, and living what is for many males an idealized bachelor's life. He seems to have everything Hamilton once desired and yet....
This is among the subtlest but also one of the most frightening of films. To say more about its plot would be a disservice to those who have not as yet seen it. Suffice to say that, under the brilliant direction of John Frankenheimer, the cast plays out what becomes a horror story of almost unbearable impact. My opinion is that Hudson's performance is his strongest throughout a lengthy film career. Will Geer appears briefly but memorably, as do others in a diverse cast which includes Murray Hamilton, Jeff Corey, Richard Anderson, and Salome Jens. Also noteworthy is James Wong Howe's cinematography which nourishes, indeed intensifies the gradually-increasing sense of terror as Wilson attempts without success to re-negotiate the terms and conditions of his surgically-enhanced life. Whenever I recall the final scene, I shudder despite the fact that I have seen this film several times and know that it is ""only a movie.""",1058918400,59,1834,5.199324324324325
864053,4,6304410492,"Director John Frankenheimer, cinematographer James Wong Howe, and composer Jerry Goldsmith have each produced a body of outstanding work. Likewise the terrific supporting cast (Will Geer, Jeff Corey, John Randolph) have given many impressive performances over many years. So it is no surprise that, when they come together with SECONDS, they create something special. What is a surprise is the powerful performance by the much-maligned Rock Hudson. It is searingly effective in its focused intensity-- certainly among his finest work.
Interestingly, at the time he was too popular a ""star"", with a recent spate of successful if insubstantial romantic comedies to his credit. No one felt it believable that John Randolph could be transformed into this familiar celebrity. Now, with Hudson's face and figure much less familiar to new generations of filmgoers, this concern is somewhat alleviated, and his performance can be valued on its substance.
At the same time, with our fuller knowledge of Hudson's personal life and tragic death, his ability to portray a man leading what is essentially a double life is far less surprising. He brings to the role a scorching insight and personal perspective that is both pointed and poignant, and in the end degenerates convincingly into desperate fear and rage.
As the adjectives used above would indicate, this is not a ""nice"" film. There is no happy ending to this story that transcends genre to speak to the dark places in all of our souls.
SECONDS has become something of a cult classic. While this is understandable, it is deserving of more attention than that. It has its flaws, but its impact goes beyond nit-picking.

The title of the film always got to me...""Seconds."" I always had a curiousity to see the film again to find out the title's meaning. Finally, after waiting so long, jumping from video store to hock shop in search of it, the DVD released and I ran to Blockbuster fast to get it. Well, I know now what the meaning of the title is, and for so many years, I never knew where I had heard that chilling musical score before. Frankenheimer really decided to challenge audiences with this movie back in '66...I mean, how often was it that you saw something like that in those days. Jeez, even my grandfather told me that he never saw anything like that way back when. I was really impressed with this nice & clean transfer onto DVD, and now more people can be able to view what all of the controversy was about.

This is worth picking up to see that Rock Hudson was more than a face and that Frankenheimer was years ahead of his time and one of the truly great directors of the 1960's.  This was such a fantastic marriage of bizarre camera work, sterile settings, and a sense of something slightly ""off"" about the everyday world.  It succeeds where countless films and TV shows have failed.  Much like what you would expect from one of today's Indy directors taking on an old Rod Serling story.  It has a very deliberate pace and is recommended for those that have the patience to appreciate every scene.  The director commentary from Frankenheimer is insightful and honest all the way through, giving much credit to cinematographer James Wong How.  Highly recommended for anyone that wants to see one of the only examples of good ""Sci-Fi"" post 50's schlock and pre-70's popcorn-flicks.",1039564800,3,1032,4.890804597701149
864137,5,6304410492,"This haunting chiller qualifies as one of director John Frankenheimer's best films. John Randolph plays a middle aged businessman who is given the chance to start is life all over again. He looks 20 years younger thanks to the benefits of radical, cutting edge surgery. He's given a new face and identity. The catch is that he can't contact his widowed spouse or their children ever again.

Sucked into this surreal world, Rock Hudson gives one of his sharpest and most impassioned performances. Perhaps that's because, despite his matinee idol looks and heterosexual swagger, Hudson was gay. In many respects he had to project one image while hiding another and those around him couldn't be clued in because it would destroy his career. The role is something Hudson might be able to identify with (ironic then that the gay actor Will Geer most famous for playing grandpa on The Waltons is the head of the company that ""renews"" people) because he had to maintain a public personna in order to continue to work in the industry.

Frankenheimer's direction is imaginative. The cinematography, editing and overall look of the film could be a textbook on surreal cinema by itself. Frankenheimer uses a variety of short, long and wide fisheyed lenses to convey the frightening world that Hudson's character has fallen into. Despite the fact that it was released in 1966, Seconds could be a modern fable about identity and discovering who we really are vs. who we pretend to be.

The Criterion releases (and the earlier DVD)features a commentary with director Frankenheimer ported over from an earlier laserdisc release. Although Frankenheimer does fall silent during the second half of the film quite often he still provides quite a bit of detail on the making of the film from choosing the various lenses with his DP to the challenges of location shooting (or shooting an orgy).

Arguably Frankenheimer's finest film (the other films that belong in the same category are his films of The Manchurian Candidate and The French Connection 2), ""Seconds"" features one of Hudson's best film performances. The Blu-ray and DVD release from Criterion is a deluxe edition that has many of the usual bells and whistles we've come to expect from Criterion and other quality DVD/Video companies. Be warned, though, that ""Seconds"" is not a film everyone will enjoy. The film comes with a decidedly downbeat ending (somewhat unusual even in American cinema in the mid-60's, Frankenheimer was clearly influenced by the French New Wave movement that was going on at the same time)but is powerful and leavea a lasting impression.",1037318400,13,2605,5.023148148148148

You just HAVE to!!""  So OK.  So I did.  So it's truly brilliant, and on my list of fave flics.  This film is one of those ""fatal decision"" stories, where the character, without due consideration, unwittingly makes that irrevocable and irretrievable committment to alter the course of his life, and in doing so, comes to the horrid realization that the choice made was, in fact, the wrong one, and maybe life before the decision to change wasn't that bad after all.  Too late! Frankenheimer does a brilliant job of powerfully conveying that moment of gut-wrenching realization that the character can't go back, can't change his mind.  Camera angles are used very effectively to impart a sense of skewed reality that the main character experiences.  In all, a gem of a film. Definitely worth a watch.

One must realize that in the '60's, everyone was attempting new approaches toward everything; shock value was essential and surrealism was in a neo-phase. ""Seconds"" is profound, if nothing else. Mr. Frankenheimer is somewhat known for his ""trilogy"" (""Manchurian Candidate"" and ""Seven Days in May"", along with this, all films about mistrust and alienation.) The fact that, in 1966, he also made ""Grand Prix"" is somewhat of a mystery; it won an Oscar for it's editing (action scenes) but the narrative itself was a trite and silly soap opera. I liked ""Seconds"" on many levels. The Oscar nominated photography of James Wong Howe is a bit artsy but creates quite an amount of tension and insecurity. (Note: this was the last year the Academy separated categories for Color or B&W; it lost to ""Virginia Woolf?""). I understand this was orignally designed to be a TV episode, but I can't imagine it being stream-lined to a 52 minute show and remain coherent. Also, commercials would've damaged the flow. The screenplay by Lewis John Carlino (a fine and intuitive playwright) was tightly and carefully designed. The incredible intricacies of the plot demanded time to ""soak in"". The acting is first rate. I've always liked John Randolph, a fine character actor; Will Geer (pre-Grandpa Walton) and Jeff Corey (respected acting coach) have small but pivotal roles. Salome Jens, always great and never used often enough to good advantage, truly shines here. There's only one lead character, and the other half of Randolph's character is covered by Rock Hudson, in a career-turning performance. Many thought he'd get an Oscar. He was truly centered and in control. The final responsibility goes to the late, great John Frankenheimer who wove this bizarre series of events into a believable and very frightening narrative. Jerry Goldsmith was a great film composer in many ways, but I thought he sounded a lot like Les Baxter (the Roger Corman/Poe films). If you watch this film, make sure there are no distractions; keep your mind open and absorb. It's quite a remarkable film.",1027555200,6,2184,4.953678474114441

864143,3,6304410492,"""Seconds"" is one of those films that is both too long and too short. Conceived as a half-hour episode of the original ""Twilight Zone"" series, it might be a compelling nightmare, a kind of Borgesian sick joke shot by Fritz Lang on speed. We'd accept the story's heavy-handed sententiousness as a necessity of the short format and revel in the snap with which it was made.
As a feature film, though, it's schematic, a series of sub-philosophical postures enlivened by filmmaking a little too clever for its own good. Not that the idea couldn't work as a feature. The problem is that instead of focusing on the main character's realization that his humdrum life results from a bankruptcy that can be blamed on no one but himself, Frankenheimer and company seem more interested in hanging a phantasmagoric swirl on their skeletal idea.
Why do filmmakers believe the best way to present the paranoid is to dump a lot of ""style"" in our laps?  Master fabulists like Kafka and Borges achieve their effects through language so precise it is *itself* surreal. An arty fable like ""Seconds,"" all tense technique slammed in our faces, ultimately falls flat because the film has not been *structured* visually. When a man can't get on a commuter train without the camera doing whirligigs, jumping around from one bizarre angle to another, there's nothing left for the kicker moments, no real horror when we need it. It's a failure of discrimination, an inability to recognize when the fantastic is appropriate, or better, how the fantastic is best revealed through the utterly mundane.
With the main character's transformation more stated than demonstrated, the action feels dragged out, the technique pasted on to distract from the empty subject. It's a pity, because the story could provide a compelling portrait of a grey man's realization of his mediocrity if the filmmakers had the perspicacity to develop the logic of the situation. Brilliant in stretches, rather frustrating because of the obvious talent involved, watching ""Seconds"" is a lot like listening to a drunken opera star sing out of tune.",1019433600,10,2092,5.011494252873563

The height of when America was so ""twisted"" and still trying to find exactly what we expected of ourselves as Americans. So when Frakenheimer made a film that attacked teh preconceived ideals of beauty, health and self respect no wonder it was ignored. Seconds is a visual masterpiece. Fish eye lens' and over lapping dialogue run a muck as an aging banker arthur Hamilton, decides to reivent himself and his looks but nothing is that simple because as this is done an organization is already in place that will control exactly how your life is run. Of course Hamilton is transformed is not only disgusted with his choice and tries not to correct his prior life but to correct himself. This is what makes this an ecellent film!

He does want to under go another surgery though so he can find some sort of balance-sohe can make himself a little more respectable. But when he returns to the organization he finds that his life and soul are as expandable as he thought of his former life. Haunghting and thrilling to the bitter end ""Seconds"", leaves the viewer not only thinking about looking past beauty but thinking about why we ever looked at it in the first place! Hudson turns in his best performance for a man who built his career on a preconceived notion of masculine looks he never flinches to show us his being destroyed!",1015200000,2,1590,4.661921708185053
864233,4,6304410492,"Underappreciated at the time of it's release and still not half as celebrated as it should be, Seconds has been described as the most ""disturbing episode of the Twilight Zone ever made.""  Well, the plot certainly does sound like one of the mini-morality plays that Rod Serling would have concocted for his show.  A middle-aged banker (played by character actor John Randolph, who is heart breakingly real as he attempts to find some way to communicate his ennui with his wife) recieves a late night phone call from ""Charlie,"" an old friend who died a few years back.  Except it seems that Charlie didn't die.  Instead, Charlie sacrificed his life savings for a chance to be recreated as a new, younger man.  As part of his payment, Charlie is now recruiting his friends.  Randolph, of course, chooses a second chance at life.  With the help of the deceptively friendly Old Man (played by Will Geer in a performance that will give you nightmares by the film's end), Randolph's death is faked and after a great deal of plastic surgery, Randolph emerges as Rock Hudson.  Now, this might seem to stretch the film's suspension of disbelief to the breaking point.  However, both Randolph and Hudson do a good job of convincing the viewer that they are the same man.  Hudson was never a great actor but he gives a truly brilliant performance in this role.  After years of playing lightweight roles, Hudson felt that this might be his last chance to truly prove himself as an actor and maybe even when an Academy Award.  As such, it is obvious that he truly pushed his talents to its limits with his performance here and, perhaps more importantly, also put his total and complete faith in director John Frankenhiemer.  Hence, Hudson never forgets that he is playing an old man in a young man's body and he is totally convincing as he painfully tries to figure out how to be young again.  Doubtless, Frankenheimer used Hudson's own awkwardness at such a change-of-pace role to signify his character's awkwardness at being a new man but that doesn't take away from the fact that Rock Hudson -- he of the much-mocked personal life and the almost comedic movie star name -- gives a sincerely touching and powerful performance that shows he never really got the chances he deserved to be something more than just Doris Day's sleazy suitor.
Hudson is given a new life, living as an artist in a ""bohemian"" beach community.  However, he is still an old man with old values and he finds himself isolated and lonely in his new life.  When he pursues a romance with a younger free spirit (well-played by Salome Jens), he instead discovers that even the things that are bringing him what little happiness he has are fakes, set up specifically to make his new life easier.  All of this comes to a head in a heartbreaking sequence that begins comedic but ultimately turns quite dark and leads the film to its disturbing conclusion.  At a party, Hudson gets drunk and finds he can no longer keep quiet about who he is.  His careless words lead to him being attacked by the other party goers.  Apparently, Hudson was actually drunk during these scenes and his tearful rantings of the pain of being forced to live a double life no doubt carried a lot of meaning for him as well.  As a result, the scene is painfully honest.  Watching it, one is struck by the raw honesty of Hudson's ""performance.""  The party scene leads to Hudson asking for yet another ""second"" chance which leads to the film's shocking but inetivable conclusion -- far more darker than anything you'd ever see on the ""Twilight Zone.""
Director John Frankenhiemer has had a bizarre career, to put it mildly.  His work has varied between some of the best genre films of all time to some of the absolute worst and finally over to a few obscure, cult gems like this film.  His direction is, at times, a little too flashy.  This is obviously a film from the late '60s but Frankenhiemer's need to experiment pays off in that it mirrors Hudson's own confusion at what his life has become.  The use of the fish-eyed lens at the film's end has been much commented on and it is a perfect, if unexpected, touch.  Seconds is not a happy film but it is one that I would recommend to anyone with an interest in how a good director and a dedicated actor can even make the bleakest of material infinitely watchable.",1014163200,10,4342,4.618489583333333

This picture plays very, very much like an episode of Rod Serling's Twilight Zone TV series.  In fact, there IS a ""Zone"" program that is nearly identical as far as content [entitled ""The Trade-ins"", where an elderly couple grapple with the mighty life-changing decision of whether to trade in their bodies for younger models].

""Seconds"" offers many good performances.  In addition to Rock's stellar outing, look for veteran actors Will Geer (as the head man of the nameless ""company"") and Murray Hamilton (as a fellow ""reborn"").

I had never quite been able to accept Rock Hudson in any roles other than the lighter, fluffier stuff .... until I saw this movie!  He was commanding in every scene, especially the very emotional final reel, during which he nearly bursts a blood vessel or two in a struggle with ""company"" doctors.  This surely must be Rock's finest dramatic performance.

Watch for some unique camera angles and unusual trick shots here as well.  It's an unsettling hour & three-quarters, but worth the trip.

Some Facts & Figures..............

""Seconds"", filmed in 1966 (premiered in theaters on October 5th, '66).
Black and White.
107 minutes.

864236,5,6304410492,"People today, if they know who he is, berate or underappreciate the work of John Frankenheimer.  The director should have been catapulted to fame with The Manchurian Candidate, but instead the film tread too close upon the actual assassinations and subsequent paranoia of the 60's.  It was pulled from release for decades.  His masterpiece having never had existed, Frankenheimer, who always oscillated between being a premier action director and an iconoclastic arthouse director, was forced to take jobs when he could get the funding.  Under these circumstances, his productivity remains remarkable.
Seconds is key to proving his unrecognized excellence.  More or less relegated to a cult film, the film has stayed in print most likely because Rock Hudson is the star power in the film.  Those watching this film expecting Pillow Talk or Giant must have been unwittingly traumatized.  The film deals with a businessman given another identity to live out for the rest of his years.  The cinematography by the master James Wong Howe (check out Hud for proof)  never allows the viewer to settle passively into the film.  The viewer is always too close or too far, his/her vision is blurred and myopic.  And when we share Hudson's point of view, we are pulled along through his life as we share his groggy paranoia.  Hudson is excellent although one wonders if this excellence is due to the fact that his uncomfortable departure from his established ""softy"" roles mirrors the uncomfortable transition from one troubled life to another.  Hudson being a closeted homosexual must have understood what living a lie truly meant for he plays it astonishingly well (Doris Day surprisingly could also do thriller roles so convincingly that she avoided them in order to not become them). The rest of the cast is filled with solid B actors' performances and unknowns.  But the true kudos goes for Frankenheimer making a paranoid shocker years before it was laudable to do so.
In short, Frankenheimer may join ranks with Robert Aldrich and Bud Boetticher of being the best of the underappreciated and before-their-time directors.  But there are many true underground gems that move beneath the day-glo veneer of  1955 to 1968.  Seconds is one of those gems--unsettling at first, but worthy of seconds.",1008288000,2,2288,5.091152815013404
864237,5,6304410492,"It's great to see that this superb film is being released on DVD uncut and with a commentary by director John Frankenheimer.  This is without question one of Frankenheimer's best works.  Based on a novel by the always inventive David Ely (read his other novel Mr. Nicholas for a startling look at the issue of privacy), the feeling of dread has rarely been captured as well anywhere else.
What would you do if you had the chance to live your life, well, not exactly all over again, but from about 30 years or so before today--if you had a second chance?  Would you revel in the glories of sensual pleasure?  Or would you find that your personality has undergone so severe a trauma from the transformation that things just don't seem to fit into place--no matter what you do?
As we approach the era--not long in coming--when genetic manipulation, advanced biochemical agents, and nanobiology will all make these kinds of changes more likely than ever before, this film is an increasingly relevant work.  Made in 1966, it was way ahead of its time, which may explain why the commercial video appeared and then disappeared almost immediately.
The powerful plot drives the film, but it's great to see Rock Hudson in a role that significantly de-emphasizes his playboy mode and underlines something far more sinister.  Equally strong are Salome Jens as his 'girlfriend', Richard Anderson as the surgeon, and Will Geer, Jeff Corey and Khigh Dhiegh as the three company men whose business it is to insure compliance on the part of the customers--or else.  And Murray Hamilton turns in a solid performance as Hudson's fellow 'reborn' traveler, as does John Randolph as Hudson's former self.
The pacing is tight as a drum, the script is sharp and tough, and Jerry Goldsmith's score is absolutely one of the best he's ever done.  It's a shame the soundtrack is not available on CD; it's great.
This is the film to see when you are thinking, Gee, why didn't I do THAT when I was younger?  The answer may surprise you....",1006300800,6,2009,4.75
864238,4,6304410492,"Seconds (John Frankenheimer, 1966)

Something happened to John Frankenheimer in or around
1980. Since then, he's managed flop after flop (anyone
remember the remake of The Island of Dr. Moreau?),
coming up with a single decent film, Andersonville
(and due to its length, it was relegated to miniseries
status on TNT). Worse yet, he's presently filming a
prequel to The Exorcist.

Better to focus on what came before: the brilliant,
underrated Prophecy (1979), Black Sunday (1977), The
Iceman Cometh (1973), and a slew of other films
ranging from the above-average to the truly excellent.
While Seconds didn't quite live up to Frankenheimer's
pinnacle The Machurian Candidate, it does a pretty
good job in the running for the second slot.

Imagine a world where anyone who wanted to could, for
a price, enter the Witness Protection Program. Dump
your former life, have your death faked, go through
major plastic surgery, and get set up in the life you
always wanted. So you think.

Banker Arthur Hamilton (John Randolph) is called by an
old college buddy whom he believes to be dead. He's
sufficiently intrigued by the idea that he ends up
donig it himself, becoming Tony Wilson (Rock Hudson),
an artist living in California. Problem is,
Hamilton/Wilson wasn't entirely sure he wanted to do
it before he did it, and the conflicts he has with
himself comprise the film's main tension.

Frankenheimer uses many of the same techniques that
were so successful in The Manchurian Candidate to
create the same atmosphere of dissociation and
paranoia here: out-of-focus shots, distorted camera
lenses, quick cuts from a character's point-of-view to
an omniscient one. They work here just as well. While
the storyline isn't quite as they-can't-DO-that
brilliant as TMC was, everyone involved does an
excellent job at keeping both the paranoia and the
believability at maximum levels throughout. The ending
is sheer perfection.

Highly recommended. **** 1/2",1005696000,4,1946,5.181528662420382
864239,2,6304410492,"The case of 'Seconds' is a bit like that of Jennifer Lopez's recent thriller 'The Cell' - does one deplore it as pretentious and derivative (which it certainly is), or does one stare gobsmacked and celebrate the sheer mind-boggling unlikeliness of such a film ever emerging from a major Hollywood studio, even in the late 60s and 70s, when it was more open to experimentation?
this is a film that could only have been made in the 60s.  From the opening Saul Bass credits, you know you're going to be in for all sorts of visual and editing trickery, fish-eye lenses, trolley close-ups, jump cuts.  The film, like many Hollywood films of the period trying to cash in on the crazy stuff the kids were watching, is a slavish attempt to imitate European culture, with 'borrowings' from Kafka (the opening chase sequence; the bureaucratic nightmare; the exam hall; the plot of a consciousness in a new body, like the 'Metamorphosis'), Franju (the graphic surgery scenes), 'The Prisoner' and 'The Avengers' (the paranoid plot about a Company planting the real world with doubles), honorary European Sam Fuller and many more.
Unlike most Hollywood films ripping off the arthouse, though, Frankenheimer's trickery is thematically relevant, his visual experimentation creating a world where the everyday becomes unstable and distorted, where vision is skewed, where there always seems to be someone beyond looking at you.  The ingenious sets emphasise huge spaces that mark the characters' loneliness and alienation, while extreme, screen-filling close-ups suggest their inability to escape.
In many ways, 'Seconds' is a 50s film made in the 60s, about the soul-destroying consequences of giving your life to capitalism and family.  it is a film deeply suspicious of conspiracies, like Frankenheimer's masterpiece 'The Manchurian Candidate', with shadowy mandarins reorganising lives wholesale, making illusions reality and vice versa - the whole film is an allegory for the repressive apparatus of the State.  But it also critiques the burgeoning hippie ethos as contrived and complicit.
'Seconds' is best enjoyed as an investigation into the image of Rock Hudson, of what it is to be a real person, with needs spectacularly unaddressed by mainstream Hollywood, and forced to inhabit this mask of hulking identity.  The first time we see Hudson, the result of surgery on his middle-aged first incarnation, he is like Frankenstein's monster, all scars, stitches and scary hair, as if this is the reality behind the smooth public image.  Its's irresistable to see this as a cry for help, with the Company's minions as Hollywood brokers, forcing the actor into public marriages etc.  In this way, the film becomes quite moving.",999734400,11,2715,5.2110091743119265
864240,5,6304410492,"I just finished watching ""Seconds"" on AMC and immediately went online to find it on DVD.  I cannot figure out why this film has managed to stay off of every single critic's top 5 list!  All I can say is you must purchase this film now and have it shipped next day air.  ""Seconds"" is a film that could have been made last year and still be cutting edge.  Cinemetographically, it is an obvious influence for Darren Aronofsky (Pi).  Rock Hudson's performance was absolutely phenomenal.  The plot is gripping.  I COULD NOT turn off this film.
Although I am reluctant to ever place such lofty praise on a film, I simply cannot say enough good things about ""Seconds"".  I agree with a fellow reviewer: it is definately a SIN that this film is not on DVD and it is equally as bad that Criterion Collection has not picked this film up.  WHY?  WHY?

The best element is the mysterious, haunting musical score.  This is really three movies in succession.  The first third is about an unhappy elderly man, who pays to a company a steep financial price to fake his death and give him plastic surgery, so he can start over as a younger, more handsome man.  The middle third is a chaotic Bacchanalian rite with much full-frontal nudity.  In the last third the man finds out--as Steely Dan once said in a song--that you can't run away from yourself.

A beautifully photographed black and white film where the characters may not be as they seem. They may get on with their new lives and memories but Rock's body may be changed but he can't forget his old life.
