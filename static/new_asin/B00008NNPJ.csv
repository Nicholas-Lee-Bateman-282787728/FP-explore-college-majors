Persuasively argues that international financial organizations like the IMF (controlled largely by the US and Europe) maintained substantial control over Jamaica's postcolonial economic policies through the mechanism of debt and lending.",1524096000,,382,6.074074074074074

First of all I would like to thank our Professor Loraine for recommending this movie, it gave me (hopefully other students in the Principal of Export and International Business) the sens of real life out there, how the deals are signed, the conditions and terms of the IMF, Word Bank, with the Emerging Countries.
What really blew my mind is how the Jamaican's Prime Minister and his government had sign these crazy deals, their hands were tight, they were screwed. The movie showed how difficult was for the Jamaican government to make any better deal, then the hypocrisy of the IMF official, who every time was speaking on the camera, you could see the carelessness and fake smile on his face, then you have the people of Jamaica who didn't know what was in the deal, when the deal was sign? So, pretty much they had no idea of those senseless deals, but they were the ones who paid the price (specially those Farmers and factory workers). To summarize my review, the Life and Debt movie made me think about what goes on in Africa (heavily in debt) and other poor countries, who don't have muscles to wrestling with the IMF, World bank, people think that they are there to help, but in reality they are there to keep them strangled, YES THE RULES & TERMS OF IMF, WORLD BANK, WERE MADE BY THE USA, EUROPEAN COUNTRIES (SOME), THEY MADE FOR THEM. NOT FOR ANYONE ELSE.",1395705600,,1410,4.5770750988142295
7985796,5,B00008NNPJ,"I used this in a world geography class to help students think about the big question -- what makes some places rich and others poor. The response was overall positive. The Amazon online version, however, was completely unreliable and I had to show it via Youtube -- the resolution wasn't as good but at least it worked.",1392163200,2,319,4.614035087719298
7985797,5,B00008NNPJ,I have shown this to my class in Anthropology when we start talking about globalization and they always vote that I should make sure I show it to the next semester class.  They see the value in it and so do I.,1355875200,,209,3.9761904761904763
