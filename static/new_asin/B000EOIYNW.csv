2525233,5,B000EOIYNW,"There are plenty of great comedy/sports greats on these two roasts. There are a few people aboard that will be of interest to those of
us over sixty. Even LITTLE kids from the time remember THE BEATLES on the Ed Sullivan, but have forgotten Jackie Vernon and his
dead-pan comedy delivery.
I won't spoil anything. I'll just say that if you like Dean Martin; enjoy comedy legends; --- MOST of these people are now dead --- want
to see a-c-t-u-a-l celebrities; you'll love these men and women ""honorin"" the roastee by insulting them... and the rest of the roasters.
Great entertainment with even MILD vulgarities blipped out such as ""bitch"" and ""bastard"", unlike the more-modern diss-fests on Comedy
Central.

They take the best of the best from each of these various episodes of the show and show it on the infomercial.  The rest of these DVD's contain quite a bit of some seriously unfunny people.

2525261,4,B000EOIYNW,"Dean Martin did just about everything in the entertainment field, having dabbled in the film industry, in the recording studio, the nightclubs, and television. He had a successful variety show on TV which ran for nine years. In the 1973-74 season, to bolster the flagging ratings, a segment called the ""Man of the Week"" celebrity roast was put in. When the Dean Martin Show ended in 1974, NBC then began airing specials set strictly to the celebrity roast format with Martin as the always congenial Roast Master. This DVD of THE DEAN MARTIN CELEBRITY ROASTS features Ronald Reagan and Bob Hope getting bagged on.

Ronald Reagan was ""honored"" as the inaugural roastee on September 13, 1973 on the Dean Martin Show, this roast running at under 27 minutes. It was such a huge success that it paved the way for 53 other celebrity roasts. At the time, you had to call him The Honorable Ronald Reagan because he was the reigning Governor of California. So there's a bit - not too much - of political digs in this one. And because of the half hour running time, the mockers on the dais aren't allotted too much time on the podium. Dean Martin kicks off the festivities with some barbs about Reagan's film career (""His movies are so bad they were shown at drive-outs."") and then he begins ushering panelists to the podium.

Most of the folks are very funny, but a few bomb. Dom Deluise stinks up the joint with his Godfather routine, although maybe it's just me not having liked Dom Deluise... ever. I've seen swimmer Mark Spitz on the dais before on other roasts, and just when I was beginning to think that maybe he wasn't ever allowed to the podium, he gets to speak on this one. His stab at being funny clocks in at about 20 seconds. Meanwhile, raise your hand if you've ever heard of Jackie Vernon? What about Pat Henry? Well, these two guys get on the mic here, and maybe there's a reason why you've never heard of them. Nipsey Russell comes on as Reagan's twin brother ""Donald Reagan"" and this bit is every bit as funny as it sounds.

But the rest of the show is rib-tickling stuff, from Jack Benny (""He can't stay long. He only put a penny in the parking meter."") to an absolutely hilarious Jonathan Winters in drag as Reagan's old schoolteacher. And then, as happens more often than not, Don Rickles, Mr. Warmth himself, steals the show in what might be his best turn ever at a roast (oh, the bile on that man). And then it's the Man of the Week's turn, Ronald Reagan's turn to dish out his insults. And, looking at this guy, his warmth and easy delivery and grace in front of an audience, well, he had that something. I find him funny enough that I'm going to end up quoting him three times before this review's done. In fact, here's one of them now:

- Ronald Reagan, this time ""honoring"" Bob Hope: ""Thank you, Dean. I was, uh, a little surprised when I was asked to be here tonight to honor Bob Hope. Well, 'surprised' isn't exactly the right word... Annoyed.""

Bob Hope's comeuppance came on October 31, 1974, and it went on for 51 minutes. This constitutes plenty of ammunition fired at Old Ski Nose. Topics covered vary from his patriotism (""He's entertained six Presidents. He's performed for twelve."") to his over-acting to his dependency on his comedy writers and his cue cards. Surprisingly I don't remember his nose being poked fun of. Ginger Rogers, Sugar Ray Robinson, and Mark Spitz lounge on the dais, but we don't hear a peep from them, and this is probably a good thing. The Reverend Billy Graham, General Omar Bradley, Henry Kissinger, and Neil Armstrong open their lips, but at least they keep it short. John Wayne dishes at Bob but from location, and he seems bent more on promoting his movie (ROOSTER COGBURN) than anything else.

If you've never seen Foster Brook's drunk act, then you're in for a treat. Impressionist Rich Little and the always reliable Milton Berle crack me up, something which Jimmy Stewart hasn't been able to do for me, much as I like the guy. Howard Cosell applies his multi-syllabic skills and, in that distinct delivery of his, has a great bit reciting a verse from Dean Martin's hit song ""That's Amore."" Ronald Reagan, still Governor, earns some big, big laughs and delivers one of my favorite zingers: ""It gives me great pleasure to tell you that, in honor of this occasion, the state legislature has unanimously passed a bill naming you California's foremost citizen."" (pause) ""I vetoed it.""

Don Rickles brings down the house again and even provokes a spit take from Dean Martin. In a charming moment Bob's wife, Dolores, introduces her husband. The ""Man of the Hour"" then comes on and dispenses his own brand of, as he calls it, ""affectionate malice."" His humor, down the years, has been classified as vanilla, but he's fairly edgy here. On this evening some of his zingers have bite.

Unlike the Comedy Central roasts, there's not much profanity here, although, okay, in the Bob Hope roast there is that moment when Flip Wilson calls Nipsey Russel the ""n"" word in jest. But everyone on the screen laughed, so probably it's only my finely tuned, out of context political correctness kicking in.",1275350400,13,5147,4.635964912280702

BEING ABLE TO SEE ACTORS THAT HAVE LONG SINCE PASSED AWAY MINGLING WITH THEIR PEERS IS PRICELESS. I LAUGHED THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE SHOW PRETTY MUCH. NO EXAGGERATION. ADD TO THAT A ROAST OF REDD FOXX ON THE SAME DVD AND YOU HAVE A BRICK OF GOLD IN MY OPINION! IM GOING TO ORDER MORE ROASTS THAT HAVE OTHER ACTORS I ADMIRE THAT ARE AVAILABLE.

2525264,5,B000EOIYNW,These are hilarious.  As a child of the 70's it was really great to see all of the old-time comedians together again.  Mu daughter even enjoys them.  They are a lot of fun.,1256860800,3,172,4.151515151515151

2525266,5,B000EOIYNW,"This brought back a lot of memories I watched these with mom growing up. We watched with my 23 year old son & his girlfried who I did not think would like it or get many of the jokes. I was suprised how much they laughed and we had a great conversation over how tv has changed since the 70's.

We loved seeing all the old timers like Don Rickles, Foster Brooks, Nipsey Russell,Ruth Buzzi, Foster Brooks, Freddy Prinze and Red Buttons. They were funny without swearing and you could telly they enjoyed thenselves.

Everyone smoked  and drank while on air now everyone and it was no big deal. All anyone has to do is watch these shows and see these comedians worked hard but made it look easy. Nothing has to be sensored the whole family can watch.

We watched Sammy Davis first this was a remarkable time in tv history. You have a mixture of races, religions, male, female and no matter what was said no one got upset. It was ment to be funny not mean & hurtfull if yu've watched the recent Celebrity roast on Comedy Central you'll understand the difference.

So many great jokes just to many to notate, I would reccomend buying at least the Ratt Pack box set.",1243814400,,1159,4.372093023255814

2525268,5,B000EOIYNW,"In 1976, Dean Martin himself was the ""Man of the Hour"" in his celebrated ""Dean Martin Celebrity Roast"" series (which ran on NBC Thursday nights in the 1970's and 1980's). Of the many roasts produced in this series, this episode is especially hilarious! The hilarity is primarily due to having the greatest put-down artist of all time, Don Rickles, as the host of the roast. Rickles is at his absolute peak in this show. He leads off the roast with a monologue that insults and prods every member of the dias. Rickles introductions of the guest roasters follow, and every one is preceeded by a short Rickles monologue. Although Dean Martin is the ""star"" of the show, Rickles is a laugh a second and absolutely had me on the floor laughing! He easily steals the show. My sides and stomach muscles hurt for days afterwards. I had forgotten how very funny Don Rickles is.

The roasters are a who's who of Hollywood - John Wayne, Barry Goldwater, Hubert Humphrey, Jack Klugman, Bob Hope, Milton Berle, Flip Wilson, Angie Dickenson, Joe Namath, Gabe Kaplan, Muhammad Ali, Howard Cosell, Orson Wells, Jimmy Stewart, Dan Rowen and Dick Martin, Ruth Buzzi, the fabulous and infomparible Rich Little, and Red Buttons among many others. These were the greatest stars of the original Hollywood era, and they all shine in their own unique way. It is so much fun to see them all again. It is good clean fun for the entire family. There is nothing to compare to it today. The Comedy Channel is too profane for family viewing, and comedians today feel the need to shock their audiences with profanity-laced ""jokes"". Not so with the Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts. These are adult oriented shows, certainly, but the jokes and gags are camoflaged enough so that little ears are not offended.

The writing is fabulous, the comedy routines hilarious, and I guarantee you will laugh or I will refund the full price of this review!

If you want to own just a few Dean Martin Roasts, I strongly recommend this one and also the Frank Sinatra episode. Both are classics and both will have you laughing out loud for an hour or more.

Want to laugh until your belly aches? Get this in VHS or DVD!

The roasts were supposed to be offensive but never mean-spirited. Sure the celebrities took jabs at each other but it was all in good fun. Ted Knight and Betty White were cast mates on the celebrated ""Mary Tyler Moore"" show.

The Betty White Roast featured her husband, Allen Ludden. before Betty took to the podium. She was roasted by Bonnie Franklin, Jimmy Walker, LuWanda Page, Phyllis Diller, Milton Berle, Jimmy Stewart and others. The Ted Knight Roast episode included an appearance by Renee Richards (the most celebrated transgender celebrity athlete of the 1970s) and Jackie Mason. I enjoyed watching Scatman Crothers, Paul Williams, Orson Welles, Foster Brooks and others. ""Mary Tyler Moore"" show castmate, Georgia Engel, appeared in both roasts. She was a frequent guest on the dais.

The DVD included an explanation about the Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts. He was truly a renaissance man--actor, singer and comedian. He just seemed to have a good time even when he was the subject of some nasty roasts as well with regards to his drinking habits. The roasts took place at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada.",1520726400,,1262,4.92018779342723

The one thing I didn't like is some of the celebrities were cut completely out or their section was edited down.  I'd like to see an entire show without any editing.",1513296000,,320,4.245901639344262
