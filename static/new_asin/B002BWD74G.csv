3895970,4,B002BWD74G,"Silver-haired and mysterious, he wanders through Japan helping people who are plagued with mushi -- mysterious supernatural creatures.

And while most live action movies adapted from anime/manga are tepid CGI-heavy affairs, ""Mushi-Shi: The Movie"" is an ethereal, atmosphere-soaked piece of work that shows the brilliant Katsushiro Otomo at his best. The storyline is kind of fragmented as it explains the protagonists' history, but the eerie plot and hauntingly lush backdrop of medieval Japan make this an exquisite piece of work, with a subtle tinge of horror.

A silver-haired wanderer -- a ""mushi-shi"" or ""bugmaster"" -- named Ginko (Joe Odagin) takes shelter in a small village, where the local matriarch asks him to help with some problems. One is that some of the villagers have gone deaf in one ear; the other is that her granddaughter is hearing bizarre things that aren't there, and grown a pair of strange horns from her forehead. With his know-how and an assortment of herbs, Ginko manages to deal with the problems.

While all this is going on, we see a silver-haired woman named Nui (Makiko Esumi) adopt a child whose mother died in a landslide. She urges him to go in case the local mushi affect him, but she grows fond of the boy -- leading to a magical and horrifying transformation for them both.

But new problems arise when Ginko travels to the Tanyuu household, home of a bizarre hereditary mushi and a vast store of mushi-related information. The mistress of the house (Y Aoi) has become mysteriously ill, and information about a kind of mushi called the Tokoyami stirs old memories in Ginko. And as he tries to seal away the mushi that threaten to swarm through the mansion, he comes face-to-face with a tormented soul from his past...

""Mushi-Shi: The Movie"" reminds me a little of ""Dororo,"" only with lovelier landscapes and less messy monster-slaying. The only real problem with this movie is the fragmented storyline, especially since the first half is a series of interconnected vignettes and flashbacks -- half is backstory, and half is about Ginko's ability to seek out mushi and deal with them.

But Otomo manages to keep the plot threads of past and present woven into a shimmering web, and the second half is a beautiful, painful expanse full of danger, blood and past pain. And we see how deadly the mushi can be, rather than the minor pests and nebulous dangers in the first.

It's a beautiful piece of work, roaming languidly through lush leafy forests, pale misty light, and deep woodland ponds fringed with trees -- it's utterly gorgeous. One particularly haunting moment is when we see of Nui and the boy Yoki ""flying"" in deep pondwater, murmuring to each other as they drift. And the beauty of most of it makes the horrific parts (including a piece of clothing slowly filling itself with swarming darkness) even darker and more ghastly.

Joe Odagin (with a headful of silver dye) does a pretty good job as the perpetually mellow Ginko, who gradually seems to awaken emotionally when a crisis arises that he can't immediately fix. Makiko Esumi is absolutely brilliant as Nui, Nao Omori has a good supporting role as Ginko's rainbow-hunting sidekick, and Aoi has an excellent small role as a legendary mushi-shi who is infected with one herself (and deals with it by writing about them).

""Mushi-shi: The Movie"" is a visually lush, slow-moving piece of fantasy, relying on subtlety and a strange brand of ""bugs"" that can only be dead with by a mushishi. It requires some patience, but it's a beautiful piece of work.",1244505600,32,3553,4.87893864013267

Most of the movie deals with how Ginko became a Mushi-shi and the person who taught him about the Mushi.  In addition there are a couple of new stories (to me) presented in the movie.

The data surface of the disc looks wavy, with ripples, rather than even the way most discs look.  I'm surprised others haven't reported the same problem.  Maybe it is a batch of bad pressings.

3896035,4,B002BWD74G,"The ANIME's individual volumes are as little as $0.42 (vol. 1) at Amazon Marketplace. The animation, graphics from Japan, audio (English option) are bright, poignant and varied; coherent, vibrant overviews of the MushiShi concept and  its many applications. (All enjoyable, intriguing varieties of adventure). Anime's original and classic, beautifully rendered. In all, abit more exciting than the movie version, which is visually sumptuous and atmospheric, though  darker (in feeling; the print's a wee bit at times dark, though). This movie is reserved, underplayed. Like, darker.

You may want to have both movie and Anime series. If so, your might want to start with the anime... There is a complete collection or you can sample piecemeal. I'm saying this because the movie is as slow as it is 'dark'.
As such, very beautiful in a poignant, Japanese watercolor sense.

Mushi-Shi is a fine look into one bit of rich Japanese folklore. Another movie of this sort is a collection of Japanese folk stories directed (maybe written by too) by the legendary Akira Kurosawa - DREAMS. It's VERY beautiful; enough maybe to hook you on all of Kurosawa's major movies: I have an extensive list of Japanese film favorites. Ask via 'comments' section and you will see.

He now travels all over and helps people that have strange encounters with Mushi. Mushi are a different form of life that not everyone can see. Those that can are either intrigued or frightened. A Mushi Shi is a person that studies and learns the ways of these different types of Mushi. Ginko meets many people on his journeys and helps them with their Mushi related problems. There are several different tales in this movie. Ginko helps a girl that has grown horns, a group of people that have lost their hearing, and a man that searches for a snake-like rainbow. All of these are caused by different types of Mushi. We also see a girl that has an inherited Mushi curse, and we learn about Ginko's relationship with his surrogate mother, Nui.

I rented this movie b/c I have the amazing anime. It doesn't quite live up to the incredible animated series, but it's still quite good. Several of the stories from the anime series are told in this live action film. The acting is pretty good. Many of the characters form the anime are portrayed very well. It's a slow moving story, so bring your patience with you when you sit down to watch it. If you can sit through it, I think that you will probably find it fairly intriguing. If you haven't seen the animated series, you should definitely watch it first. This isn't a very good representation of the way the series played out, but it's still a pretty good movie in its own right. It was like a rushed half retelling of the anime. I don't think it's one that you are gonna want to own though. I suggest renting it. I can't see myself ever watching it again.",1356825600,,1742,4.393188854489164

The title character is a Mushi-shi called Ginko who roams a Japan of over a hundred years ago, solving problems caused by Mushi or by people incorrectly interacting with them.

I haven't read the manga, but I think this movie does a good job at telling a few of the stories from the anime: Ginko's history, the Mushi that eat sound, the man who chases rainbows, and the young woman who has a way with words.  By the end of the movie, a few plot threads are left dangling, but perhaps they were hoping to do a sequel.  It captures the feel of the anime and there's some beautiful camerawork and scenery, though I don't care for the color filters they use sometimes, which makes things look kind of ""muddy.""

The series was a nice little visualization of the spirit of nature and one man's (Ginko's) understanding of that nature.  In the original series, Ginko was like Odin, striding thru nature, having exchanged an eye for wisdom.

The movie, on the other hand, it poorly paced, has uninspired acting and visuals (in fact this dvd looks very grainy, and even has some damage type artifacts, like damage circles that you see on old films!).  There is way too much of Ginko as a kid and the old woman (who was really a very minor part of the original series.  Overall, not worth the viewing.",1339286400,,777,4.594202898550725

Most humans cannot see these Mushi-Shi, and so, they call upon the expertise of Bug Masters for help in getting rid of their unknown ailments caused by them. This film plays out fluctuating between Ginko's present; Yoki is thus named in the Present Scene's, and Yoki's past. And so, I advise grabbing a cup of coffee or green tea in order to stay alert and focused throughout this deeply emotional dramatic fantasy world of Bug Master Ginko who; after long years of separation, ultimately sacrifices his life for the life of his beloved Teacher & Guardian, Nui.

The dubbing is just fine in English, well done in fact I would say. It just drags a little. It isn't the actors, it's just missing some finesse that would've made it a great movie and I would say that's on the producers & the director. I will say it isn't at all what you would expect and it does have some terrific moments.

I just wish they had stepped it up a notch so it would've been fantastic to watch.
Why not make it fantastic when it was in reach, imo. Don't expect a ton of action. Instead, expect a mystery and you should enjoy it.",1300924800,,678,4.2153846153846155
3896047,3,B002BWD74G,"I was really looking forward to watching this movie; I have read the Manga & have watched the entire anime collection. Both are simply astounding. There's a tremendous sense of timeless beauty & a serene (and sublime) soundtrack that accompanies the anime.

If you have not read the Manga, nor seen the Anime, you might enjoy this film. It is dark, spooky, & beautifully shot. The acting is first rate & the effects are nicely done.

However, the film departs radically from both the tone and content of the Manga & Anime.

The film lifts elements & characters and re-arranges them, changes relationships & fabricates new events. The result is confusing and disappointing for fans of the Manga & Anime.

Where the tone of the anime is at times playful, beautifully animated (and sometimes dark & scary), the film is dark, gloomy, and subdued.

Ginko's character is portrayed as weak and ineffectual, relying on other characters in the film to save him.

There's little of the subtle humor and interplay of the characters evident in the Anime & Manga.

This film is worth seeing, but please do yourself a favor and see the Anime & read the Manga first. You won't be disappointed by either.

3896051,3,B002BWD74G,"Don't let the American translation ""Bug-master""  of its title fool you, writer/director Katsuhiro Otomo's (Akira) ""Mushi-shi"" has nothing to do with bugs. The translation of the title is actually ""Mushi-Master"" and is based on the award-winning manga series by Yuki Urushibana and the anime series of the same name. The series was such a big hit in Japan that a live-action adaptation was to be expected. The film is about a silver-haired one-eyed man who wanders a pre-technological 1800's Japan where magical creatures such as the mushi exist and he does what he can to banish them from hassling people.

Mushi are creatures that have links to the essence of life, good or bad. Among those who can see and exercise any sort of mastery over them are people called Mushi-shi and Ginko (Jo Odagiri, Shinobi Heart Under Blade) is one such individual. He travels around the countryside aiding those who have been infected by malicious or unwelcome Mushi; using potions, herbs and knowledge that only a Mushi-shi can grasp. He encounters a variety of infections and situations that lead him into finally dealing with the problems of Tanyu (Yu Aoi) who must write down the stories of the mushi to keep it from overwhelming her. Ginko must deal with the secrets of the Tokoyami, the Kouki and his own past...

It is such a chore for someone to cram an anime series into a 130 minute film even for an award-winning director such as Otomo to pull off. I haven't read the manga and have only seen parts of the anime series but I guess it is safe to say that the film has adapted some of its episodes. It would be safe to say that the film adapts most but not all of its source material, and it was rather obvious that the film has its own problems. The anime was quite episodic with its characterization, origins and plot details; while it may work with its source material, the film encounters a lot of problems in staying true to the style and delivery of its roots. A lot of details are left to the imagination and for fans of the manga to fill in, thereby making the film is a little too episodic and having some problems of coherency.

The film also has some issues in keeping the pace even, as much of the film is told with a heavy atmosphere and a sense of the presentiment. For one to understand the film (would become a chore itself) one has to have a deep understanding of existentialism, a belief in the duality of intelligent beings, and that each living thing carries a ""spirit"" that are linked to one another and is in turn given life via an umbilical cord by Mother Earth. We see the backgrounds behind Ginko and his origins, as well as the little girl he helped in the film's opening act. There's a powerful essence within Ginko and his one-eyed quality may actually serve as the dark and the light that resides within him. Tanyu represents something that controls the mushi by recording them, meaning that to understand something is to gain power over them. The little girl in the film's beginning may represent something that was victimized and clinging to the past, and fearing the future. The film can get very cryptic and very slow-moving, that it may frustrate a lot of viewers and may even alienate some of its fan base.

The film does have plenty of atmosphere with the proper mood to set the viewer's enjoyment. The film does have some good visual effects that didn't overwhelm the film's story, I loved the part when Tanyu used her magical sticks to capture the enchanted mushi records. Nui (played by Makiko Esumi) is a mysterious woman that took in a young boy named Yoki (Inada Hideyuki) that serves as a great plot device to get the film going. The film does have its redeeming moments as the means as to how Mushi is dispatched by Ginko and Tanyu proved very interesting and nicely executed. However, as interesting they were, the mushi itself lacked further development and the screenplay is hampered by the fact that it takes too long to get the audience really care about Ginko and even Tanyu. I guess while the concept is interesting, it gets very difficult to care since some details are set in such indistinct language that those who can't read between the lines would be lost.

""Mushi-Shi"" is a manga adaptation that tries to be more than a commercial serving of the anime series and for this I have to give it some credit. The film has an artistic quality that is beautiful and enthralling but these same qualities will undoubtedly form a disconnection with its viewer. The film requires a very patient viewer and one who is used to reading between the lines and filling in the answers for themselves. ""Mushi-shi"" would have proved more enjoyable if it focused more on clarity and energy to keep the viewer awake. Its lack of an overriding plot and focus makes it a little bit of a bore. The artistic qualities should've been balanced with a more mainstream energy so that it can enthrall rather than alienate. The film has great ambition and does have spots of creative flair, but it may have been a little too late as it fails to serve up intrigue and suspense, it sort of just dawdles from one event to the other and goes nowhere.

The film will appeal to fans of the manga but others would be better off renting it.

Rental [3- Stars]
The image of the dvd goes from mediocre to good; and some scenes carry a lot of grain. The picture is decent but nothing special. The 5.1 Dolby Digital Japanese track is accompanied with great subtitles. There is also an English language track.

3896052,3,B002BWD74G,"For a decade, manga writer/artist Yuki Urusihibara is known for the award winning series ""Mushishi"" which was publicized in Kodansha's ""Afternoon"" magazine (1999-2008).  The manga was eventually adapted into a Japanese animated series and later adapted to a live film by ""AKIRA"" and ""STEAMBOY"" creator Katsuhiro Otomo.

The film would star Jo Odagiri (""Shinobi"", ""Azumi"" and ""Kamen Rider Cougar""), Makiko Esumi (""Shomuni"" series, ""Over Time"" and ""Love Revolution""), Yu Aoi (""Tokyo!"", ""Hachimitsu to Clover"" and ""Tekkon Kinkreet"") and Nao Omori (""Tokyo!"", ""Tekkon Kinkreet"" and ""Prisoner"").

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""MUSHI-SHI THE MOVIE"" definitely deserves high marks for its visual appeal.  The positive aspects of the film are its breathtaking locations and just overall look.  Traditional Japan is captured with its lush greenery and its hills along the countryside.  The DVD captures the film's grainy appearance at times but the negative aspect is the amount of dust, scratches and film warping.  There was not a tremendous amount of it but it was visible throughout the film.

The film tends to use lighting effectively.  From the darkness of its deep blacks and blues to the aged and sometimes burned-like hues, the film seems to have its beautiful and incredible moments, its eery and dark moments and also its vibrant and colorful moments.  Also, seasons are captured...with Ginko walking through the snow or through a village full of grass.  But the cinematography by Takahide Shibanushi is absolutely beautiful.

As for audio, the film is presented in Japanese 5.1 Dolby Surround and English 5.1 Dolby Surround.  I primarily watched the film in Japanese and for the most part, the film is a dialogue-driven film.  Front and center channel speakers play the dominant role.  There are some scenes that utilize some bit of action and of course the music by Kuniaki Haishima definitely sets the tone for the film.  Surround is best utilized during the scenes that feature mushi and are effectively used during the eery scenes.  As for the English 5.1 Dolby Surround dub, personally it's more of a preference to watch Japanese live action films in Japanese but I did watch some of the film in English dub and for the most part, FUNimation Entertainment has been good by casting quality voice talent for their anime and the same for their live action films but personally, Its just my preference to watch this film in Japanese.

JUDGMENT CALL:

There are major positives and major negatives about ""MUSHI-SHI THE MOVIE"".

First, the negatives.  One of the problems that a film like ""MUSHI-SHI"" would have  is that the film is adapted from a lengthy manga series.  There is a lot of story to tell.  At least with the anime series, there are 26 episodes that can help introduce the various characters and through the many storylines, you can see how those characters are developed.  With the live-film adaption, ""MUSHI-SHI THE MOVIE"" requires your full attention.  It's a 131-minute film that is easy for your mind to stray, because for the first hour, you watch this mysterious character named Ginko helping villagers with their problems.

Many Japanese fans of the manga and anime series were quick to post on the Internet that if you know the backstory of ""MUSHI-SHI"" you would be fine but if you didn't, you're going to be lost or even bored.  I absolutely agree.  There's only so much you can do in trying to get so much story into a 131-minute film and there were times during the film that I'm waiting for Ginko to help more villagers but it doesn't happen.  We are treated with flashbacks and dialogue about mushi and tokoyami and it is easy to get lost.

As for the positives, the film looks absolutely beautiful.  The scenery is absolutely breathtaking, the CG is not overdone and works quite well with this film.  Also, the costume department deserves recognition in order to create that old Japanese style (despite not knowing what time period of Japan the film takes place), everything seems to work just right in terms of achieving the look and feel of ""MUSHI-SHI"".

""MUSHI-SHI THE MOVIE"" is absolutely breathtaking in visuals and there are moments that may be near borderline horror or too eery for some people.  As one scene depicts a knife going through a person's arm in order to use the blood of a person to drive away mushi.  It's a very bloody scene.  And in one scene, for one consumed by mushi, seeing their bodies so black that you feel they are covered in tar.  Very eery !  So, I wouldn't necessarily watch this film with young children.

But another positive that one can find in the film is the amount of talent that are in the movie and those behind-the-scenes of the film.  Joe Odagi, Yu Aoi, Makiko Esumi and Nao Omori are just awesome talents that are quite common to see in Japanese films and dramas and personally, it was great to see ""Shomuni"" actress Makiko Esumi in such a role.  And of course, knowing that Katsuhiro Otomo is directing is another major plus for the film.

""MUSHI-SHI THE MOVIE"" is one of those films that you want to recommend but at the same time, it all depends on the viewer and if they are the type that can put their entire focus into the intricate details of the film for 131-minutes.  In fact, it's a film that can easily lose people right at the end.  Even for myself, as I paid close attention to the film, the final 15 minutes of the film, I felt it went over my head and I realized, maybe if I read the manga series or watched the entire anime series, it would all make sense to me or I have to watch it all over again.  I guess you can say that at the end of the film,  I felt may I have missed something inportant.

""MUSHI-SHI THE MOVIE"" does have its share of cool and eery moments (and I emphasize this film does feature beautiful cinematography throughout the film) but I think that ""MUSHI-SHI"" is a storyline that is best suited for a manga or anime series or even a live action television drama series in which its intricate storyline is deserving of stories that emphasize on the character's development and could be told in many hours than just 131-minutes.  There's too much storyline involved with ""MUSHI-SHI THE MOVIE"" that 131-minutes is clearly, not enough (although I also felt the film was a bit too long) to effectively showcase the storyline and explanation of mushi, tokoyami and even Ginko's role as  Mushi-shi.

Overall, ""MUSHI-SHI THE MOVIE"" was entertaining and visually wonderful but unfortunately, the storyline may be too difficult for some viewers to comprehend.  If you were a big fan of the anime series or the manga series, then ""MUSHI-SHI"" will definitely worth checking out but for those not familiar with the storyline, it's a film that will require your full attention.",1250726400,14,7355,4.850722311396469
3896053,3,B002BWD74G,"While Mushi-Shi The Movie cannot claim to have many ties to anime-giant Funimation (after all, it is a 2006 live action film that has cleaned up at movie festivals), the franchise itself is deeply rooted in the anime/ manga industry.  Yuki Urushibara was the mastermind behind the original manga (which was awarded an Excellence Prize for manga at the 7th Japan Media Arts Festival in 2003) and a rich 26-episode animated series followed shortly thereafter in 2005.

In 2006, amidst the successful run of the anime, Katsuhiro Otomo directed this live-action incarnation, which enjoyed its world premiere at the 2006 Venice Film Festival.  It then opened in Japanese theatres in March of 2007.

Released to North American markets at last, Funimation has acquired the exclusive rights to the motion picture, which occupies a single disc within a standard-sized DVD case.  Runtime comes in at 131 minutes and language options follow the standard set in the anime business: Original Japanese dialog (in stereo) and an English dub option in Dolby 5.1 Surround.  English subtitles are available with either voice choice.

The film wears an appropriate TV 14 rating due to the slightly disturbing imagery though the film does a wonderful job of steering clear of sexual situations, foul language, or glorification of gore.

Extras on the release include a host of deleted & extended scenes (opposed to the theatrical release), Mushi-Shi premieres, original trailer, and a crop of coming attractions (which includes live-action features).

The story, which basically follows the format established in both the manga and the anime, goes something like this:  In turn of the century Japan, a mysterious traveler named Ginko arrives to a small village where he happens upon a houseful of individuals afflicted with inner-ear trouble.  As fate would have it, the traveler is one of few living Mushi Masters; an individual who has devoted his life to studying strange, iridescent parasites called Mushi.

What's more, these parasites cannot be seen by everyone, which of course makes them particularly dangerous as their choice for entering their host (human or animal) is through the ear.

Infection of the parasite results in deafness and the appearance of four small, upward curving horns on the forehead (which are capable of detecting new sounds that unaffected men cannot hear; whispers and ringing bells).

The tone of the film is surprisingly serious, with near-constant tension and mysteriousness.  It requires a certain level of patience and willingness to sit back and allow the film to weave its story.  Action-lovers will probably be disappointed but horror-film fans will probably have little trouble adapting into the proper state of mind by the mysterious series of events with which the film opens.

Some have expressed extreme disappointment in earlier American-renditions of the film, which, like many foreign properties before it, brutalized the subtleties and genius of the original in translation.  If you seek examples, consider this: The original English translation was titled ""The Bugmaster""; a name used to identify Ginko as the Mushi themselves was translated simply as ""bugs"".

In my opinion, viewing the creatures as a simple bug infestation certainly downplays the mysteriousness and borderline-disturbing nature of the creatures.  These aren't the type of pests that one can get rid of by calling in the Orkin Man.  Instead, there's mysticism at work here that builds well by playing off the natural scenery and darkened environments of the film.

J Odagiri's portrayal of Ginko is quite impressive as well thanks to an affinity of confidence-filled grins and slow, deliberate motions.

The dub is decent and certainly holds up pretty well against the original dialog, though not quite as smoothly as the generic mouth flapping that anime allows.  Once the initial distress of lips that do not match the dialog fades, expect a solid job by the English voice actors coupled to the benefits of Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.

Pacing is fairly slow and methodic throughout but for the most part, well done.  Films like this rely upon tension and release in its prose rather than endless action sequences or CG-induced visual overload.

About the biggest source of confusion comes in the form of the frequent flashback sequences that without the benefit of some corny wavy screen-wipe effect could easily be mistaken for current events.  These segments, which can be identified by a woman with the same silver hair as Ginko, are in fact memories of Ginko's distant past.  The silver haired woman is in fact Nui; young orphan Ginko's own mentor and her teachings are the type of philosophical infusing one might expect should be present in an Asian film.

Perhaps the picture's greatest strength lies not in what's seen but in what isn't- as in dimly lit sets, misty mountainsides, and minimal-use of the computer-generated parasites all add up to a creepy undertone that works extremely well.  It's often said that some of the finest tension-thrillers are those where the villain is rarely seen on screen (but left to the viewer's imagination).  Ridley Scott has reiterated this point when discussing his 1979 film, ALIEN time and time again and indeed, it's the quick shots of the monster that make it so terrifying and keep viewers studying the shadows in every scene.

In all, this movie certainly isn't for everyone.  As stated above, it takes a certain level of patience and commitment from the viewer to fully enjoy.  The over-two-hour runtime can feel long and tedious if approached with the wrong expectations.  The tones and themes here are definitely much heavier and more depressing than those presented in the anime, manga, and video game incarnations of the property.  In all though, a very unique picture that will surely impress those who view artistry and emotionally driven storytelling as one in the same.",1250380800,26,5941,5.163883089770355

The special effects weren't terrible or overdone.  I watched it twice and decided to give it to my niece, who is also a fellow anime enthusiast.
