6568194,5,B00ME8EOVW,"Kehinde Wiley is incredibly thoughtful.  The New York Times article on his work should have been more generous and engaged with how much work Wiley puts in his work and the fact that he actually articulates the theory and history behind his practice.  Wiley tries to do art in the context of both world history (in which the recent history of black people is mostly a history being ""third world people"" even when they live in Western countries and what he calls ""the burden of art history.""  This is the perfect complement to the brilliant video currently showing in an exhibition of his work at the Brooklyn museum in which he reveals himself to be a multi-lingual, multicultural person who works with a multiracial crew for whom he has a great deal of respect.",1425859200,6,762,4.6716417910447765

6568196,5,B00ME8EOVW,"As a fan of Kehinde Wiley's work I enjoyed this documentary for a few reasons. First of all, it was insightful. It answered some questions that I've wondered about, i.e., why he never paints women (with the exception of Salt N Pepa) and how is it that he is so prolific?

Also, it was great to watch the creative process unfold. I don't know how the great masters found their subjects (aside from being commissioned to paint them), but it was fascinating to watch Wiley and his assistant scout for models on the streets of Harlem and Downtown Brooklyn. (My sister was stopped, too!) I couldn't help but wonder if in 500 years people will be as enchanted by these women as we are now by the Mona Lisa?

Furthermore, we see his creative process at work on two other continents (talk about being dedicated to one's craft) and how it culminates in a gala event: Wiley's very first series of female portrait.

For me, this was 54 minutes well spent.",1413676800,6,944,4.508771929824562

6568205,5,B00ME8EOVW,"The documentary, ""Kehinde Wiley: An Economy of Grace"" is a must watch film for anyone interested in contemporary art and culture. I felt honored, watching the film, to join Kehinde Wiley as he planned his paintings and interacted with the subjects who would create the content for his paintings and the galleries and institutions that would show his work. An enjoyable and informative look into the world of contemporary art. Highly recommended.",1428192000,,445,5.194444444444445

8671764,5,B00ME8EOVW,"I recently attended a retrospective being held at the Seattle Art Museum 2 months ago for Kehinde Wiley, and would definitely recommend this documentary for anyone interested in Modern Painting. I think that Kehinde Wiley is so influential in the landscape he is exploring which is derived from so much old world technique & craft, modernized into completely relevant subject matter to today's social climate.",1463788800,2,409,5.3076923076923075
