6934119,4,B00RNTYKA2,"My grandson (age 17) loved Dr. Suess from childhood. I was surprised when he asked for the Lorax movie as a gift. We all loved it. So, for fun,I bought him Horton Hears a Who.  The story is still there, but our feeling was that it had been TOO embroidered, too filled out, and therefore lost some of the feeling of the original. Maybe that was necessary to justify an entire ""time-slot"", but we didn't love it, like we did the Lorax, though it remains a favorite tale.",1492128000,,468,4.318181818181818

6934123,4,B00RNTYKA2,"This is a cute movie... I really liked it... until my 4 year old said ""shut up mouse"" I had no clue where she picked that up from because we filter ourselves as much as we can and besides I would rather her say ""be quiet"". But the evil Kangaroo in this movie said it and for whatever reason it stuck with my 4 year old. Bummer! But still this was a cute movie overall.",1485388800,,368,3.92
