6248291,2,B00I3P3BF0,"Enjoyed a serial watching a fairly representative day to day/week to week
rendition of what it is being as LGBT and living, dating, breathing, thinking etc
But the transitions from episode to episode are choppy, do not establish
any sort of reasonable premise other than being gay.  Story lines are not
properly established nor are characters properly written.  Dialogue is weak
and is entirely too predictable.

6248292,4,B00I3P3BF0,"very well done, and heart felt as a gay man that endured the coming out process, the series hit home.",1396396800,3,101,4.1
6248293,4,B00I3P3BF0,This was really pretty good.  It caught me by surprise.  At first I thought it was unusual because each episode is only 10 to 12 minutes long.  It runs about the same length as a movie all put together so you can definitely watch it all in one viewing if you want. The acting and script are far better than the usual cheesy gay-oriented things that are out there. It is definitely in the top tier. Very enjoyable.,1395964800,5,413,4.269230769230769
6248294,4,B00I3P3BF0,"Although my high school French is (extremely!) rusty, I really like this show.  Thankfully, it's also subtitled!  My only complaint would be that the episodes are a little too short (10 - 15 minutes each).",1395705600,4,205,4.828571428571428
6248295,2,B00I3P3BF0,"The program was just a attempt to feed of the success of Queer as Folk.
None of the characters were interesting and the plot was boring.",1395705600,,136,4.269230769230769
6248296,1,B00I3P3BF0,Coming Out displays all that's negative in the LGBT community. As a gay man I've already seen enough of that to find it unappealing. There is nothing positive or hopeful in this sordid soap. I'll take a pass on this one.,1394928000,3,220,4.390243902439025
6248297,5,B00I3P3BF0,"The French AND the French Canadians can say so much with so few words...this has always amazed me.  I am simply blown away by this series. Each episode drew me deeper and deeper in and made me realize again that high art can come in many forms.  There is no comparing this series to QAF or anything else for that matter.  This series stands on its own, as it's own unique body of work.  With stand out performances by EVERY actor, even those with very small supporting roles, it is truly something worth your time and does not leave you feeling like you wasted part of your life. Watch it for yourself and form your own opinion. Bravo!!",1394064000,12,636,4.364406779661017
6248298,4,B00I3P3BF0,"This is the Canadian TV, Mini Series that will inevitably draw comparisons to the UK's `Queer as Folk'. It tells the quite `explosive' lives of a group on Montrealers but mainly with a gay context. Mathieu is a photographer who has been sowing some wild oats after splitting with long term partner Ian; but then he turns up on the scene again after being the victim of a homophobic attack. We also have Gen who is married to Olivier, she is a doctor and he is a cop and he is also sleeping with his wife's work colleague Hugo.

Then we have street kid and AIDS carrier Teo who lesbian Caroline - a social worker- is trying to save. She also wants to have a baby with her lover. We also have a transsexual Mexican lady who steals every scene  she is in - there is a lot crammed in here; I feel like saying the old `SOAP' phrase - `confused? You will be!' etc.  There are scenes of a sexual nature but nothing too full on and some drug taking and some violence, but actually it is all done quite tastefully.

The only real issue is that this is twelve episodes and they last about twelve to fifteen minutes each, so these are very bite sized indeed. Whilst the makers cram as much drama as possible into each segment it can get frustrating as soon as you get hooked the ruddy thing goes and ends and you have to press the scene skip to get to the next episode. Still I found it very gripping and watched the whole lot in one go. This would make a brilliant film and if they are going to make more - which I hope they will- then please be brave enough to make longer versions as I think the quality of the programme deserves it, in French, English and a smattering of Spanish with OK to average sub titles - this is really quite good.",1392422400,25,1731,4.1891891891891895
6248299,5,B00I3P3BF0,Really good series and so sad they didn't go past season 3!  I loved hearing them speak French and seeing how French Canadians live their daily lives and the acting was very good.,1459209600,,179,4.424242424242424

6248301,5,B00I3P3BF0,"The 10 minute segments of this Montreal-based serial were not a deterrent in engaging me. The characters become real and developed in short order with few stereotyped versions of gay life. Mat and Ian's relationship which ended before the series began is a thread that weaves throughout the series... and much of the story line is about how two men who genuinely love one another navigate being apart. The comparisons to QAF are apt, but this is not an American-style series. It is more nuanced and compelling.",1456617600,,510,4.873563218390805

6248350,3,B00I3P3BF0,"I should rate this higher since I got hooked on the series, and want to see more. However, the lack of original story or perspective drags down the rating. My issues are that the short episode format, though well used, can be frustrating; still I appreciate the straight to the point context. The subtitles sometimes miss connecting what is being translated to the character that says it. In my opinion, the biggest problem for me are the subject matter cliches; it's another look at the cliches of gay life that have been told repeatedly. Damage from unaccepting parents (every parental relationship in this, provides us that.) There's gay bashing, self loathing, married cop coming out, a drug addict prostitute with AIDS, the social worker lesbian. The whole series is all melancholy, with trite promise of better days ahead in the end.  {*** Spoiler - they actually use the rom-com stereotype of one who's leaving being stopped at the airport at the last minute. I guess the gays deserve this scene too. --End Spoiler ***}. Although the show has nothing new to say on its topics, what makes it worth watching (for folks interested in more than the spattering of sex scenes) is the production. Although everyone but the lead gets little attention and the full fleshing of character is missing, the pacing is good, the camera work interesting; the music evocative, and the script is not dumb. Outcomes come about too easily since there's no time to process range of emotion, but what's here isn't nonsense. The characters are fairly grounded with few stereotypes (except everyone's parents) and no undue histrionics (except everyone's parents.) It's not phony (there are issues with the inability to properly portray the lead character's work and success but it's excusable) The makers of this did try casting a net out to the deep end, but the story and character complexities and developments don't go beyond neck deep. Still, I guess I do actually like melancholia with trite promise in the end. There's talented voices at work here, too bad they're telling unoriginal stories.
End Note: Cliches are what they are for a reason. This stuff really happens, over and over. Many people share similar experiences to these, generation after generation. As much as we're culturally changed, at the individual hearts of us, we're the same. I get it. But as a seasoned person, and with as much as has been said on these matters, a new take, a fresh point of view, much less a different story told this well would be refreshing.",1418083200,,2523,4.894859813084112
6248351,2,B00I3P3BF0,"Meh. I wanted to care about more of the stories of these characters. But in the end, either they lack sufficient background and character development to make you care of the stories were simply lacking. You get what you pay for.

I would hope a second season is in the works.",1401926400,2,447,4.6
6248384,3,B00I3P3BF0,"I liked it. The episodes are very short, just minutes long. You can binge watch this entire season in an hour plus. I hope there is a second season.",1401753600,,148,4.137931034482759
6248385,4,B00I3P3BF0,"Other than you have to read subtitles the tv show is very good.

Like the fact the the episodes are really short.",1401494400,,113,4.136363636363637
6248386,4,B00I3P3BF0,"Only watched the first episode, but after seeing it, I actually look forward to watching the next one.  This series looks to have potential. Multi dimensional characters, absorbing storyline, and cool vibe.  Check it out.",1401494400,,221,5.285714285714286
6248387,3,B00I3P3BF0,"First, I will start by saying that I only watched the first 3 episodes of Season 1. Unfortunately, the plot was not interesting enough to catch my interest. Maybe is the fact that each episode is about 30 minutes or less and there is so much story that can be told within such short time.",1400716800,,288,4.254545454545455
6248388,5,B00I3P3BF0,Nicely acted! :) Want to see more of JP. Enough said and hope they continue on with season 2 with few NYC characters :),1399507200,,119,4.0
6248389,3,B00I3P3BF0,"I am happy that there is another gay type series, and they do seem to be getting better and better but they all seem
to be missing one thing or another.  Again, I;m haapy to see these shows so I hope they get more supporters.",1398902400,,225,4.0
6248390,5,B00I3P3BF0,i had anticipated a gay drama with subtitles .... but more than I expected.  Excellent drama and sexual situations along with emotional connections which hit home for me.  HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR GAY MEN.,1398729600,2,210,5.147058823529412
6248391,4,B00I3P3BF0,Great production values.  Deals with many issues the gay community faces that are very individual.  You don't have to be gay to enjoy this film.,1398729600,,144,4.72
6248392,1,B00I3P3BF0,"What a waste of time. Thankfully, I did not have to waste money as this was offered free, and now I know why it is free.",1398297600,,120,3.6538461538461537
6248393,4,B00I3P3BF0,"Stubbled on this program since it was on Prime and watched all of it since it was in French.  Happy that I was able to understand Canadian French which is unusual at time.

Some sad items in this story.  Believable.  The shows were very short for some reason.  Perhaps it was a half hour show when it aired with lots of commercials.  So run time is about `10 to 15 minutes per show.

Passionnant !",1398211200,,398,4.226666666666667
6248394,5,B00I3P3BF0,"Good Drama, Sorry the episodes are just 8 minutes long perhaps next season the episodes are not that short. Waiting for the season 2.",1397779200,,133,4.583333333333333
6248395,5,B00I3P3BF0,Anxiously wait for season 2 - a very riveting drama that makes you want to see more and more. Great show!!,1397779200,,106,4.095238095238095
6248396,3,B00I3P3BF0,It took a while to like the cast.  By the end of the season I thought the show had improved.  I hope it gets a bit more interesting next season.  This is too much like real life.,1397347200,,178,3.7567567567567566
6248397,5,B00I3P3BF0,"This show makes the US Looking series seem a plodding, dull and lifeless bore. Coming Out packs more into one 12 minute episode than other gay shows do in weeks. The characters are great, you feel for them, you get to know them and you want more of them. The story line is the intertwined lives of the main characters.

You really have to watch this show to appreciate it, one of the best gay series I have seen in years.",1397174400,3,421,4.197530864197531
6248398,5,B00I3P3BF0,"Great format.  The beginning hooks you, Brief, well written and acted.  The ending keeps you looking forward to the next episode.  Can't wait for next season.",1397088000,4,158,5.0
8638733,3,B00I3P3BF0,"It's not bad, but full of cliches and covers absolutely no new ground. The biggest problem is the main character is such a self-absorbed ass that he is not sympathetic, and I ended up hoping he would NOT get together with his love interest. It's hard to invest in a selfish character with no redeeming qualities, although the actor is solid. I don't know if Montreal society is unusually homophobic, but we seem to be covering 80s issues - AIDS, parents disowning children, etc. I know this still happens, but in a sophisticated urban center in 2012? Was it necessary to have TWO characters go through this?

That being said, the acting, while uneven, is very good for a show like this.",1505088000,,686,4.622950819672131
8638734,5,B00I3P3BF0,"I'd had this in my Watchlist for a while, and finally watched an episode around midnight last night.  And then I watched another, and another.  Before I knew it was nearly 5am and I'd watched the whole series, it's that engaging.",1499472000,,229,4.560975609756097
8638735,5,B00I3P3BF0,"The character development is great, and the arc of the overlapping story lines held my interest. I live rural and isolated shows like this help me to feel like sometimes I'm still part of a community.",1498003200,,200,4.583333333333333
