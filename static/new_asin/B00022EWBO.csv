8020454,5,B00022EWBO,"This series is an excellent resource full of compassionate, helpful information, that covers the whole Alzheimers disease process.
 It is very professionally produced, but is very sensitive in how the information is shared. This series has been very helpful, not only to my Dad as a primary caretaker of my Mom, but also to us as the children & family of an Alzheimers patient.
