2968380,5,B000WGC58M,this is about 2 kids in a hospital for kids with illnesses.  there is nudity.  see in the movie the 2 main kids are in bubbles.  and they learn how to get out.  and play any where that it is not the bubble.  this is a good movie.,1338940800,,229,3.6875
2968381,5,B000WGC58M,"This movie was recommended by a friend who likes foreign films.  She gave no thought to the fact that there was nudity in the picture.  At first, I was shocked, but the admiration of the production took over.  The director and producer should be commended for their ""arrangement"" of images.  They arranged images and crafted a story the same way a florist arranges flowers.

This movie is cinematic art at its very best.  The children were natural and unspoiled.  You get the hint that a social message has been subliminally introduced, but the message is more about the abuses of the medical profession.

By the end of the movie, you are aware of the inevitable changes that come to all of us as we grow older and wiser.

This may be a movie that is about two children, but it is NOT for children.  It is about change and how it effects the way we live.

If you are easily offended by nudity, you will want to politely pass up this film.  It is not sexually oriented or motivated, so if you want cheap thrills, this movie is not for you.

The nudity was modest in its presentation and is a non-issue in its portrayal.  It is neither forced on the audience nor is it hidden in shame.  It has a great pace and balance to it.

It is well deserving of 5 stars.",1318204800,27,1257,4.3076923076923075

This touching and beautifully executed film is far too soft to be named french surrealism though that is what it is.  The two main characters, children of about 10, suffer from some unnamed immunological disorder.  The physicians apparently justly take pride in their technological success in having prolonged their lives.  However, these children know better, longing to be cured; to touch one another; and, to see what lies beyond.

2968399,5,B000WGC58M,"This is a wonderful film which is bound to make the viewer think about a number of issues, including medical science and the nature of freedom. It is also a lovely tale of adventure and discovery, suitable for all ages. As many others have mentioned, there is a lot of nudity, but it is completely innocent and non-sexual, and an important part of the plot. The two children at the centre of the story are nude for the majority of their scenes, but although there are a few glimpses of Tom's penis and Lola's vulva, most of the time it is difficult to tell which is which; they are just two beautiful children with completely shaven heads, and far more similarities than differences. It is easier to tell them apart when they get dressed to go out in the world. Apart from that, there are two other scenes with some nudity; the 3 children at the house of Tom and Lola's friend are nude when T & L visit, but nothing is really visible, and we see one breast of a nude woman whom Tom and Lola watch giving birth.

There are also some great comedic moments, my favourite being when Tom and Lola visit another child-patient in the medical facility, in one of their excursions before the great escape, and he takes the two bald, naked creatures for Martians! Another example is the children's wonderful, quick-witted verbal exchanges early in the film, where they demonstrate the great intelligence which is an important factor in their ability to outwit the staff of the facility and escape from their ""captivity"".

All-in-all, it is a highly entertaining and intelligent movie, suitable for children and adults, for different reasons. My only problem with it is a minor matter which is probably a result of this version being transferred from a VHS tape: the English subtitles cannot be switched off. It's nice to have the subtitles, but it would be nicer if I could choose to watch the movie as it was filmed, without any subtitles, as well.",1367971200,2,1939,4.633720930232558

First I was kinda dissapointed how the DVD case and the DVD label looked like.
It looked like some kind of a pirate DVD. On DVD it even says DVD-ROM.
Also the picture quality is very bad and the subtitle is white so most of the time I couldn't read them clearly since the movie is coated with white background more than half of the running time.
But after watching the movie, all that flaws seemed like nothing.
The movie was so beautiful and I won't forget the ending for a long time.
It's so pure and dream like movie.
If you think about the nudity it's worthless choosing this movie.
It's not about nudity.
I hope some day I can see a better picture quality version.
Two actors are adorable. They are so real and innocent.

8223180,5,B000WGC58M,"This DVD film is an excellent rendition for the tragedy of severely damaged immune systems from the viewpoint of two youths.  Both Tom and Lola are portrayed engaged with realities of their birth defect that defies any remission and the fantasy world behind all the medical probes with isolation to cope day-by-day.  Their immune systems are so damaged to the extent sterile conditions required them to live completely nude with no clothing in hermetically sealed plastic bubbles: Such portrayals of nudity are actual conditions of their medical needs to avoid any infection.  They watch TV shows and dream of a distant continent with ice, snow, penguins, whales and dog sleds.  Both Tom and Lola dream of physical contact which is not sexual but caused by deprivation.  In the French culture, it is common for the young to sleep nude at night until puberty begins; this is manifested when Tom and Lola are relentless protagonists to breach their isolation bubbles and explore.  The message behind the nudity of the youngsters emphasized the deprivation of Tom and Lola to just have normal contact with other individuals, even to the extent of kissing and fondling each other.
Their fantasized quest to reach a surreal Alaska and intermittent contact in other settings are the epitome of youthful innocence and charm.  Especially in vignettes as juvenile fugitives they demonstrate the race against the mortality of their birth defect in which many do not survive puberty.
The young actors in the role of Tom and Lola are really precocious, extraordinary and brilliant.  This is a good family movie, especially for those who are affected by terminal birth defects.",1467676800,2,1664,5.091911764705882

It's a strange little story that doesn't develop and seem to be going no where. It's an expensive DVD and not really worth the investment.
