8672724,2,B00MJ4068G,It's a cute show. The father/son dynamic is great. The reason for the two stars is that the sound is missing from disc two on.,1453852800,,126,4.08
8672725,5,B00MJ4068G,Well casted.  You really root for the father and son duo's development over the course of the series.  Silly but very entertaining.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  They put resources into this policy dramady with good music and graphics.,1424044800,2,232,5.026315789473684

8672727,4,B00MJ4068G,"A light touch comedic police drama. Don't take everything serious on this drama,
 just relax and enjoy the comedy. The casting is good too.",1412380800,2,139,4.791666666666667
