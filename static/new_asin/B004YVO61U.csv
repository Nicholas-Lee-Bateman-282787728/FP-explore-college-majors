8448925,5,B004YVO61U,"Kink Kong 1933 B & W version is still my favorite of all ever made, But let me tell you that this 1976 remake has it's own charm. First of all the Dino De Laurentis magic touch: Big production, big special effects (excellent considering the lack of computarized techniques that Hollywood has today) and the presence of a new beautiful face with a remarkable sex appeal and overall, talent: Jessica Lange who became one of the best actresses trough the years.

Orca, which I specially bought this set for, is yet another of my animal themed favorite movies  ever. Charlotte Rampling and Richard Harris, great performances and a very preetty Bo Derek way before the stunning body she showed inher film '10"".

Finally, Congo..a lot of suspense, not one of my favorite films but just a bonus treat.

Excellent price for this set and great service from Amazon.com, as always.",1422835200,,870,4.78
