5724601,5,B00CJN84L8,"Where do I start. I first saw this series back in 1984 on a 6th Generation bootleg VHS tape, no subtitles and almost no color.
Yet it started a life long obsession ""ANIME"" let me tell you drugs would be cheaper!

This DVD set is truly a revelation and a dream come true. Restored video and english subtitles, Life is good!
A note to the those individuals who only watch ""Dubbed"" Anime you are missing out on a legend in Anime, this title will not be dubbed and will only be issued for a limited time so get this one for your collection it is truly a ""Must Have"" for any fan of anime!",1297814400,5,583,4.114035087719298

I'm guessing if you're looking at this product, you've already seen Part 1.. this is more of the same (a good thing). If you just stumbled across this DVD by accident, start with part 1 first.

First off, this series is from 1985 -- Amazon is listing it as 2011 (when the DVD was released), so keep that in mind to avoid any surprises.

It's a very fun action-comedy show in space, following a group of girls (the ""Lovely Angels"" around) on a sort of ""problem of the week"" series. It reminds me very much of a mix of Lupin III and Bubblegum Crisis, to give you an idea of what to expect.

The show was originally 24 episodes, then 2 were released on video later on (26 total -- 13 in the first set, 13 in this set).  The episodes are divided on 3 discs (5 episodes + 4 + 4), each about 25 minutes. Each disc is in a slim DVD case, with all 3 housed inside  a cardboard box.

The set includes more extras than Part 1 - but that's not saying much - you get a ~20 page text interview booklet from 1993 with Haruka Takachiho. You also get an art gallery, clean closing and trailers.

I'm assuming that if you're looking at this, you've already seen the first set. The picture/audio quality is right about the same. I found the video to be pretty good for an older title (although no means perfect). As a reminder, the show is in Japanese language only (with english subtitles).

I'm a bit disappointed in the overall quality of the packaging. The sets come in a somewhat thin cardboard packaging - while nice looking (good shot of each girl on each side), they're poorly made the covers just being ""glued on"" - both of my sets were peeling at the seems on arrival (most sets print directly onto the boxes, or use a stronger adhesive). The volume 2 box also arrived with several big dents from shipment. The spines look very similar, with the Dirty Pair logo, but ""PART ONE"" and ""PART TWO"" are in very dark grey text on a dark background, making it almost impossible to read except for being up close and looking hard. The other disappointment are the individual cases - these are set up in a similar way, with ""DIRTY PAIR"" and then the disc # (1, 2, 3) - the problem being Part 1 has ""1, 2, 3"" and part 2 has ""1, 2, 3"" - it seems like it would have made more sense to have ""1, 2, 3"" and ""4, 5, 6"". Like the spine, the PART ONE text is in dark grey on black background. On a shelf it would look like ""Dirty Pair 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3""

In the end, the packaging isn't terribly important. The lack of a dub is disappointing, but I've accepted that it wouldn't be included. The small amount of extras leave you wanting a bit more, and the audio/video get the job done, but won't be impressing anyone too much. It's also a bummer that it's split into ""Part one"" and ""Part two"" when so many series' have a complete collection available for the same price (or less) than each volume.

...But what really matters is that the show is enjoyable, and this is the only way to see it. For that, I still recommend it for any fan of the genre.",1297209600,3,3396,4.462903225806452

Kei and Yuri are the Lovely Angels (or more disrespectfully, the Dirty Pair), a pair of ""trouble consultants"" working for a private corporation, the World Welfare Works Association (WWWA or 3WA), which helps member solar systems deal with planetary-scale problems by dispatching agents like them (for a small fee). Depending on how you look at it, they are either the 3WA's best agents or their worst: because though they always solve the case, solving the case often involves collateral damage on a Biblical scale. It's worth noting that said damage is never technically their fault, but this is usually small comfort to the victims.

This collection consists of the second 13 episodes of the original TV series.  Chronologically that works out like this: ""Affair of Nolandia"" from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dirty-Pair-Original-Features-DVD-Collection/dp/B0072GPQJK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dirty Pair: Original Features DVD Collection</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dirty-Pair-The-Original-TV-Series-Part-1/dp/B00BY6XMKE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dirty Pair: The Original TV Series, Part 1</a>, this set, ""Project Eden"" from the features set,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dirty-Pair-Original-OVA-Series-DVD-Collection/dp/B005S0STWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dirty Pair: Original OVA Series DVD Collection</a>, ""Flight 005 Conspiracy"" from the features set, and finally the reboot series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dirty-Pair-Flash-DVD-Collection/dp/B007Q0JK4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dirty Pair Flash DVD Collection</a>.

14: The Vault or the Vote?  A Murderous Day for a Speech: During a planetary presidential campaign, 3WA headquarters provides a venue for a speech but on the same day discovers it has been infiltrated by a master of disguise.  Kei and Yuri are called upon to find and stop the infiltrator before he can carry out his plot, whether it is assassination or something else.  Collateral damage?  Several flying security bots destroyed, one undefeatable security computer shut down with a grenade, two 3WA employees murdered.

15: Dig Here, Meow, Meow, Happiness Comes at the End: While on vacation Kei and Yuri rescue what turns out to be a grizzled old treasure hunter looking to hire them for a share of the treasure.  Collateral damage?  One potential boyfriend rendered unconscious, one hotel room shot up, one helicopter gunship shot down, one garlic induced robot malfunction and crash landing, one ancient monument damaged, several minions minced.

16: Leave It to Us!  The WWWA Is a Wonderful Job: Kei and Yuri are hired as bodyguards for a teenage heiress who wants to go out on the town and have some fun.  What they don't know is that an assassin has been hired to kill her.  Collateral damage?  One cigar severed, several cars wrecked, several windows shot out, one 3D laser tag game dome totaled, one toothpaste tube squeezed out.

17: Come Out, Come Out, Assassin: A murdered 3WA agent manages to pass on some critical intel before dying: the particular commercial spaceflight a wanted master of disguise assassin will be taking in order to get to his next job.  Kei and Yuri are sent aboard in disguise in order to seek him out, but unfortunately the pilot chooses this trip to commit suicide and take everybody aboard with him, posing a quandary because the disguised assassin supposedly possesses the skills necessary to disarm the suicide's trap.  (One of the best episodes IMHO.)  Collateral damage?  One escape shuttle blown up, one cockpit door blasted, several people killed.

18: Pardon Us.  Trouble on the Run, So We're Coming Through!: In another very good episode that amounts to a parody of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Gauntlet/dp/B003ASLJNG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Gauntlet</a>, Kei and Yuri are sent to bring in a fugitive.  What they don't know is that the fugitive is going to be a key witness in a trial against a drug syndicate, and said drug syndicate would rather he didn't live to testify.  Collateral damage?  One hotel leveled, one flying car bombed, several buildings damaged, several cars and trucks wrecked, one city bus shot up, one police station rammed and leveled by a semitrailer truck.

19: An Unjustified Lover's Grudge, Let Me Love You Without Revenge: In the course of completing a mission fairly successfully (by blowing up something they were supposed to), Kei and Yuri drop a space pod on a mansion.  Fortunately, no living beings are killed or hurt, but a humanoid doll is destroyed, and a couple days later the enraged owner contracts with the 3WA to find out who did it so he can personally take his revenge upon them.  Guess who get assigned the job.  Collateral damage?  One fighter jet shot down, one space pod flown out of fuel and crashed, one mansion severely damaged, one humanoid doll destroyed, two minions poisoned, several others shot, blown up, etc., one unstoppable villain stopped.

20: Nostalgic Blues Make a Killer Soundtrack: A famed but long missing assassin resurfaces, and Kei and Yuri are sent to apprehend him but due to a bizarre series of circumstances (OK, not so bizarre for them) find themselves forced to work together with him.  Collateral damage?  One bar totaled during a fight, one helicopter gunship shot down, one monorail engine blown up, one monorail track severed, one monorail car derailed into a volcano, one air car obliterated.

21: No Way!  463 People Disappeared?
22: We Did It!  463 People Found!  In this two-parter Kei and Yuri are called in one day before another long overdue vacation to investigate the mysterious disappearance of 463 passengers and crew from a commercial space liner... while it was IN flight.  Collateral damage?  Several oil drums punctured, one kid's air cycle and several air cars wrecked, one picket fence splintered, one precious flower garden ruined, one computer disk crushed, 46.3 million credits scattered to the four winds, one giant bulldozer compacted, one case report falsified, one divorce ruined, one beach buggy load of beach supplies dumped all over the road.

23: Something's Amiss...!?  Our Elegant Revenge: Called off a mission to ""take out"" (with a bazooka no less!) the creator of a dangerous new drug at the last minute due to pressure applied to the 3WA, a furious Kei and Yuri agree to work privately with a conman to take him down.  Collateral damage?  Several security bots destroyed, a couple of air cycles and one air car wrecked, 30 million credits incinerated, one romance nipped in the bud.

24: Are You Serious?  A Condo Is a Dangerous Place to Live: Kei and Yuri are tasked with stopping a serial killer who has murdered 33 beautiful young women,... by using themselves as bait.  Collateral damage?  In what has to be a record low for them, one window broken, one birdcage smashed, one caged bird escaped, one light fixture broken.

25: Eek!  The Boy in the Manor Is a Terminator:  Because Yuri is out on a date when the call comes in, 3WA Chief Gooley sends his deputy, Calico, with Kei to apprehend a counterfeiter whose excellent work has caused a financial crisis.  Unfortunately, Calico demonstrates a recklessness that makes the Dirty Pair look careful.  Collateral damage?  Several robots, some of them dangerous, destroyed, one mansion damaged, one terminator terminated, two suspects escaped, one trigger happy superior reined in.

26: R-Really?!  For Beautiful Women, ""Cannon"" Is the Keyword to Escape: The 3WA security chief goes rogue, seizes the 3WA weapons lab, murders the entire staff, captures Chief Gooley, points the God Cannon at the city of Eleanor, and holds them both to ransom.  Rather ruthlessly the 3WA responds by refusing to pay or to attempt a rescue, instead rigging the dormant volcano the lab is built on to blow.  Will Kei and Yuri obey orders and stand down?  (Do you have to ask?)  Collateral damage?  One canister of whipped cream emptied improperly, one refrigerator door jammed shut, one nasty cold caught, one road sign knocked over, one balloon shot down, one cable car derailed into a gorge, many minions massacred, a capsule full of top secret weapons records dumped, one weapons lab volcanized.

Nozomi Entertainment and Right Stuf! deserve a lot of credit for doing a nearly perfect job of re-releasing an anime classic by marrying remastered video with Japanese audio and English subtitles, all at a reasonable price.

Note: This show is only subtitled in English. There is no English voice dubbing.

Note: The first appearance of the Dirty Pair, shooting up a storm in several scenes of a drive in movie, occurs in the movie on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crusher-Joe-The-Movie-and-OVA-Collection/dp/B0000BV217/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crusher Joe: The Movie and OVA Collection</a>.",1458000000,,9059,5.571219868517166

8582691,5,B00CJN84L8,"Now right after I got this and watched a bit of it I gave a quick 2 line thumbs up but, I prefer to be better when it comes to my anime reviews. If for one reason or another it has taken until now to get the T.V. episodes in the States and this is a great release. If you are a long time fan or want to check out what us old kids are yammering about, DON'T MISS THE ULTRA-DESTRUCTIVE, Kei & Yuri (C/N LOVELY ANGELS) known through the galaxy as, THE DIRTY PAIR!

 This is part two of a 2 part release for the 26 T.V. episodes for the duo and also the very first release in the U.S. for the T.V. episodes and it is definitely a good one. I have the ADV release for the OVA's, Movies, and Flash and the packaging is exactly like the Thinpak boxes for the OVA and Movies, 3 cases in nice and sturdy chip board boxes with nice art featuring our leading ladies. As for sound and video, It's an 80's classic so you get a stereo mix for sound and it does sound really nice, it looks equally nice wearing it's age well, just don't expect it to look like the latest and greatest out. That all said this looks and sounds great especially for a show produced in 1985.

*A note before I continue, this show is presented in Japanese with Subtitles ONLY, so be prepared there isn't an English Dub!!

 As for the story, it's a sci-fi action saga set in a future universe following the exploits of WWWA trouble consultants Kei and Yuri as they solve intergalactic crimes and mysteries, all while leaving a path of destruction wherever they go, hence the nickname Dirty Pair.
If you are a lover of the classics, or a first time fan, or a long time Dirty Pair fan, don't miss this one!",1374796800,,1666,4.145510835913313

8582693,5,B00CJN84L8,I (and a lot of other people) have been waiting for this series to be released here for countless years. What can i say about Kei and Yuri other than the 1st anime feature that I purchased 12 years ago was the Streamline release of Affair On Norlandia. I've been a big DP fan ever since and waiting for the now defunct ADV to release the tv series after they released all of the other DP (Flash and original) variants was a big pain. And since it never came to pass I went out and got the R2 Japanese dvds of the tv series which cost me quite a bit and was trying to subtitle it myself which proved to be a daunting project. Thankfully Rightstuf decided to release it and I was so happy. The remastered R2 dvds (which as previously mentioned I own) were used and the 2 releases are identical as nearly as I can tell. Kei and Yuri are 2 trouble consultants who work for the 3WA whose codename is the Lovely Angels but everybody calls them the Dirty Pair for their habit of blowing up almost everything the come into contact with. This is highly recommended for any body who has watched it and for those who haven't-you should really give it a try.,1298332800,3,1146,4.237442922374429
