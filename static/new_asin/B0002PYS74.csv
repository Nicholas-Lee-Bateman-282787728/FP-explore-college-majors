2113792,5,B0002PYS74,"I started taping the Garfield specials and other holiday specials when my daughter was born, and for 20 years we have been watching the same VHS tape. Through the years some of the programs have been partially deleted, or the tape goofs up, or whatever. It's nice to know we can get the Garfield episodes brand new on a DVD! Those are our favorites! I bought the Claymation Christmas last year, and I think I'm pretty much caught up on all my favorite holiday specials to where I can finally throw the 20 year old tape away! Thanks for bring back Garfield, Odie, John and Grandma. We are excited to sit down and watch them without having to 'track' the tape. HAHAHA

2113793,5,B0002PYS74,"I'm ecstatic that these are now available on DVD.  My sister and I would watch these every year when we were kids, and now I can share them with my kids.

Awesome!",1097020800,2,163,4.0625
2113794,5,B0002PYS74,"But I'm really happy it is.  It's always really cool when something comes out of DVD that you have not seen in years and that has passed into near obscurity.

The DVD gives us three old Garfield Holiday specials which have not been televised for many years.

A Garfield Halloween first was shown in 1985.  This Garfield short I love! It is a terrific Halloween show and the first time I saw it many years ago I was very surprised about what happened in the old house and it is actually scary!

Lorenzo Music was very good as the fat cat Garfield and he is just hilarious in this one! Thom Huge was good as John and Binky the Clown! If you love the season of Halloween and autumn time then this is the perfect animated feature to watch.

Garfield Thanksgiving was first shown in 1989.  The jokes are classic, even if some of them are more for adults than children. I laughed uncontrollably during the Orson Welles joke when Garfield was on the talking scale.

A Garfield Christmas was first shown in 1987.  The plot is simple Garfield, Odie and Jon spend a family Christmas in the farm home that Jon grew up in. The songs are great, it's funny, sweet and ultimately moving. It manages to avoid the sentimentality that usually crops up in Christmas specials just by having Garfield constantly undercutting the feel-good nature with cynicism. Show this to the children in your life. It really is magical in a way that all the Disney animations could never be - because it has heart.

With all these holiday coming very soon, this is the perfect set to get.",1096588800,19,1553,4.494661921708185
2113795,5,B0002PYS74,"Ever since I blew the opportunity to have purchased the Garfield Halloween special on VHS back in the early 90's, I have been kicking myself.  This special has since become hard to find and often times very expensive when you did finally track it down (on VHS no less).

I can't believe the wait is almost over, and not only for just the Halloween special, but for the *classic* Christmas special, and Thanksgiving special as well.  These were some of the staple ""special"" programs from my childhood, which I imagine even children of today would enjoy.  The kids still go for the Charlie Brown specials, so why not this too?  I know me, being a kid at heart, looks forward to finally obtaining these specials.

I have very fond memories of the Halloween special, the most vivid of which involves the old man at the end.  That guy, along with the Pirate Ghosts, always managed to scare me as a child.

Finally, the empty space next to ""It's the Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown"" will be filled, and I feel like my DVD collection is closer to completion.",1094860800,24,1047,4.561497326203209
2113796,5,B0002PYS74,"For anyone who loves these specials, this DVD collection is a real gem.  The videos have been long out of print and go for a pretty penny on sites where people sell used copies.  They are essential for holiday viewing and I am very excited about finally seeing them in DVD quality.  I have also bought the other Garfield DVD's that were recently released and I have been very pleased with them!  I just hope they continue to release the other Garfield specials and TV series seasons as well.  Now I didn't see the new Garfield movie, but if for promotion sake it had a hand in pushing the release of all these DVD's then I'm all for it!",1091836800,5,636,4.310924369747899
2113797,5,B0002PYS74,"I can't begin to tell you how long i have hoped these specials would make it on dvd. I LOVE garfields Halloween, very humorous and the old man in the haunted house always creeped me out!!! ranked up there with the great pumpkin in my book. Garfields Thanksgiving never got much air time and was a hard one to find on casette, one of the weaker ones but still a good one to have. Garfields Christmas was without a doubt one of the top christmas cartoons. Always felt it was up there with Charlie Brown and Rudolph. Jon , Garfield and odie head to the farm and have a family christmas with Jons folks. Garfield is a bit of a scrooge but learns the meaning of Christmas in a heartwarming and humorous cartoon. If you have kids or just are like me ( a kid at heart) you will love this collection for years to come.",1091491200,9,810,4.198717948717949
2113798,5,B0002PYS74,"I'm very excited to see these Garfield specials come to DVD!  As a kid, Garfield's Halloween always scared me silly (it still does, at that--ghost pirates, brrrrr!).  The Thanksgiving special, in which Jon invites veterinarian Liz over for Thanksgiving dinner, is the weakest of the three specials in the package, but is still a welcome addition.  But the best of all by far is A Garfield Christmas-- which I haven't seen for years but remember vividly (I still have the companion book for it).  I've spent years searching for A Garfield Christmas on video and then DVD, but to no avail until now, because it is, as I consider it, one of the best conventionally-animated holiday specials around (perhaps surpassed only by the original Charlie Brown Christmas and It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown).  If you were only getting the Christmas special, this offer would be a great bargain and more than well-worth it; with the Halloween and Thanksgiving specials thrown in, it's nothing short of a spectacular deal!  I'm eagerly awaiting October 26!",1091145600,8,1048,4.994252873563219
2113799,5,B0002PYS74,"I've been hoping these specials would come to DVD. When my son was young, we use to watch the Garfield shows on t.v. At the time they also showed the three holiday specials. My family loved them all. The Holloween special is the one where Garfild and Odie get to dress up and go out trick or treating, and as Garfild would say ""candy, candy, candy!"" They also vist a haunted house. The Thanksgiving special I can shed some light on. Jon takes Garfield to the vet, she puts him on a diet, and Jon gets up enough nerve to ask the vet to his place for Thanksgiving. A comical adventure begins when he finds there's more to making dinner, then he thought. I don't want to give to much away, but Garfield saves the day by calling someone to help out with the dinner. The Christmas one is where Garfild and Odie go with Jon to his parents for Christmas, and where Garfield finds the real meaning of Christmas. For anyone who loves Garfield, these are a must.",1091059200,5,952,4.324022346368715

Interestingly, there is a part in the Chirstmas episode that I don't even remember from when I watched this in my youth.

The Thanksgiving episode is just awkward and uncomfortable. Jon essentially gets a date for Thanksgiving by weedling. I know he's supposed to be a sad lonely guy but it made me feel really uncomfortable for everyone involved.",1419811200,,582,4.878787878787879

The Halloween episode is scary, I remember it being scary as kid and I remember correctly. As an adult it's not terrifying but may be a tad frightening for the young'ns.

The Christmas episode is one of my all-time favorites. Filled with good humor, songs, and a lot of heart. This episode alone makes it all worth it.

Unfortunately it looks as though this DVD is out of print and pretty expensive nowadays. I still have the $10 price tag inside my case from when I bought it years ago from blockbuster.

It is sooo scratched up & the box is worn out! lol I bet it has been played 100+ times. My youngest daughter has just loved it. We get it out every holiday. Halloween is coming up soon, and I'll be getting it out to watch with them. This video has good, clean, family values in it. It also shows the true meaning of holidays.

I had seen all three but remembered the Christmas and Halloween ones the most.  I don't remember the scene where the ghosts follow Garfield and Odie home though.  But that's probably because until about 4 years ago, the last time I had seen these specials was when I was around 10 years old.  I never understood why these specials are never shown on TV anymore but it doesn't matter now that I found this.  My 5 year old daughter likes the specials too and we just watched them earlier.  Rather, we tried, but she likes to handle the DVD's on her own and got a deep scratch in it that can't be fixed.  But I will definitely be ordering a new copy.

He really enjoys Garfield's funny facial expressions, and the animation is easy to watch without a lot of loud noises and special effects that might over-stimulate a younger child. Much of the humor is a bit too sophisticated for a young child but that makes it more fun for adults who sit through it. We've watched it together a half dozen times now and I still laugh at Garfield's dry humor, body language and his silly antics.

2113973,5,B0002PYS74,"Here is my review for ""Garfield Holiday Celebrations"" on DVD.  It is the second DVD to feature three Garfield television specials (the first one being ""Garfield As Himself"").  The three specials featured on this DVD are: ""Garfield's Halloween Adventure"", ""Garfield's Thanksgiving"", and ""A Garfield Christmas Special"".  I will give a brief review for each of them and what they are about:

- ""Garfield's Halloween Adventure"" is about Garfield and Odie going trick-or-treating for Halloween when they stumble into an old house that is haunted by ghostly pirates.  I first saw this special when it was on TV about ten years ago as I post this review; it's as funny and good as I remembered.

- ""Garfield's Thanksgiving"" is about Jon inviting Liz (Garfield's vet) over to his house on Thanksgiving; unfortunately for Garfield, he is also put on a diet before the big day.  This was the only Garfield holiday special I never got to see when it was on TV.  Luckily for me, I was finally able to see it once I bought the DVD; it's just as humorous as I hoped it'd be.

- ""A Garfield Christmas Special"" is about Garfield and Odie spending Christmas with Jon at his family's house.  I watched this one quite a few times when I was a kid, and I still enjoy it each time it's on.

If you are a big fan of Garfield like I am, I suggest you get this DVD before the holiday season ends.  Just like the Peanuts gang, Garfield is another great comic character that knows how to star in television specials like these.",1259020800,,1501,4.559701492537314

2113997,5,B0002PYS74,"Especially at this price of under $10., there is no reason to not get this dvd.

The Halloween special is a great start. Garfield and Odie decide to go trick or treating as Pirates. All goes well, until Garfield decides that they haven't gotten enough candy, and they decide to go into a strange area. Of course, they get lost, and they run into an eccentric old man who warns them that they may be seeing some real ghost pirates soon. (Nice transition from a plausible start into the horror.)

The Thanksgiving special is interesting in that Garfield has to go on a diet right before Thanksgiving, and for once, John Arbuckle may actually have  date with Liz. But of course, John has to mess up the dinner, and once Garfield is released from his diet, he has the hilarious, but at the same time touching solution. (Call Super Grandma)

The Christmas special is also really nice. John and Odie want to go to the family farm for Christmas, and of course Grinch Garfield is not so eager: ""Why can't they come here where my warm bed is?"" Though he is reluctant, he endures the trip. But he soon finds out that he has a friend in Grandma. This is when we see a more gentle side of Garfield. There are some comical moments that keep the show going. (Though it does seem strange that at his age, John and his brother do not know that 1 AM is not an appropriate time to suggest opening Christmas presents.) But the end has an especially touching moment.

Overall, this is a great Garfield package. Highly suggested if you are a Garfield fan.",1232409600,,1534,4.444839857651245

2114004,5,B0002PYS74,"Tese are some of the best animated TV specials that have ever aired on television. Garfield, Odie, and Jon are here to celebreat Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. ""Garfield's Halloween Adventure"" is my personal favorite out of three of them, because it's sometimes unusually creepy for a Garfield cartoon. ""A Garfield Christmas"" is a fan favorite, because it contains lots of dramatic material (and Pat Carroll as Grandma!). ""Garfield's Thanksgiving"" is a bit weaker compared to Halloween and Christmas, but it's still good entertainment nonetheless. So the next time these three holidays are around, I'll be watching these cartoons for sure!

2114049,5,B0002PYS74,"I have no idea why these Garfield holiday specials never seem to air anymore.

Garfield's Halloween Adventure (1985) - I saw one reviewer mention a missing scene where the ghost pirates find Garfield and Odie.  I don't remember it.  I'll have to dig out my old VHS from when it originally aired in 1985.  I don't doubt it because I have a comic strip version that includes that scene.  It's a shame they left it out.

Other than the exclusion of that scene, it's a great Halloween special.  I'd rate it second to only The Great Pumpkin.  Maybe the fact that it's actually kind of creepy is why TV chooses not to air it anymore.

Garfield Thanksgiving Special (1989) - While my least favorite of the three, it's an amousing special.  It's worth having especially since TV doesn't even want to acknowledge Thanksgiving anymore.

Garfield Christmas Special (1987) - I can still remember the first time this aired like it was yesterday.  Has it really been 20 years?  John, Odie, and Garfield go for an old fashioned Christmas down on the farm.

Filled with Garfield's usual dry humor. I think his line ""Whoever thought of the idea of Christmas trees should be drug out into the street and shot"" may be why we don't see this one on television anymore.  Aren't we all so sensitive.

It even has a very touching scene with John's grandmother telling Garfield about her late husband.

If you watch it - focus on the grandmother. Although she appears to be the typical jovial yet criticizing character if you listen to her speak in a moment of reflection it is actually touching and makes you stop to think about your own family's reaction to this special holiday season that only comes once a year.

2114081,5,B0002PYS74,"Growing up in the 80's, I always looked forward to watching the Garfield specials.  We didn't have a VCR until I was almost (note, almost) too old to worry about taping something like this, so staying home to actually see the show was of the utmost importance.  This DVD puts together three Garfield holiday specials in one place.  It is so nice to be able to pop it in and relive a little piece of childhood.  It's too bad that the powers that be cut out a section of the Halloween special.  Instead of going straight from finding the boat to being in the house where Garfield gives up half his candy, the original version on TV included a short segment of the ghosts following Garfield and Odie home to collect the ring Garfield took.  Yes, the ghosts may scare a few of the littler ones, but if they can handle seeing them at the island, they would be able to handle seeing them outside of Jon's house, too.  I have watched the Thanksgiving segment once and was really happy with it.  I can't say that I ever saw it on TV, but I did read the comic book, and the special stayed very close to the book.  I have not seen the Christmas special yet, but I am looking forward to it!  That one was on TV, along with the Charlie Brown Christmas, and I didn't ever want to miss that, either.  Time will tell whether or not this special has any editing or was left in its timeless TV version.  I would tell any Garfield lover (or anyone who just loves the holidays!) to buy this DVD!!!",1163376000,3,1478,4.258064516129032

2114083,5,B0002PYS74,"Garfields Christmas is another all time fave. The eighties really rolled out a slew of timeless Christmas specials that are now tough to catch on TV anymore. This was one of the best. I can remember cracking up everytime I watched them light up the tree and go ""OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOh."" Its one of those perfect moments. And what about Grandma? That crazy firecracker, putting all the chilli pepper into Ma's gravy.

I was always a huge fan of Garfield anyway, the cartoon was on at 7:00am my entire school career. (1st through 12th grade, no joke)I watched it nearly every morning while I ate my CAPN CRUNCH. It was always well written, great for any age... the specials were no exception.

THANKSGIVING: Also has Grandma in it. She takes charge when Jon is too wimpy to fire up a conversation with that hot veteranarian he was always after. Its hillarious, of course.

HALLOWEEN: When Garfield and Odie get mixed up with Ghost pirates. Man, I haven't seen those two in YEARS!

The CHRISTMAS one was the best though. We get to meet Jons family down on the farm. If you are trying to get some goods to view with the FAM this holiday Season... GARFIELD is way up there on the ""classics"" list.",1134432000,4,1185,4.5754716981132075

But don't throw those old VHS copies away just yet - at least not the Christmas special.  Although the Halloween and Thanksgiving shows are fine on DVD, the color is very uneven on the Christmas special and in some scenes looks like pre-final sketch work that has not been fully colored in at all.  This is obvious when you compare it to the old VHS edition.  That's really a shame and, unfortunately, not that uncommon (see some of the reviews of the DVD edition of ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"" which suffers from even worse color distortion).",1133740800,3,674,4.455284552845528
2114085,5,B0002PYS74,"Everyone's favorite fat cat delivers a disc full of Halloween hi-jinks and yuletide cheer in this wonderful collection of 3 classic holiday specials!

From 1985 comes ""Garfield's Halloween Adventure!"" Rudely awakened on the morning of October 31st by the Binky the Clown Show, Garfield is thrilled to find it is Halloween! He immediately goes into preparation, after another nap and breakfast that is. With faithful pup Odie alongside to increase Garfield's candy collecting by 2, the anxious cat selects pirate costumes for the pair and off they go! Little do they know that their night of successful candy collecting will eventually wind them up in a creepy old house lived in by a creepy old man and haunted by some REAL pirate ghosts!

Next up, 1989 brings us ""Garfield's Thanksgiving."" This delightful story of Jon's first date with veterinarian Liz takes a tragic turn when we discover that Jon has no clue when it comes to making a Thanksgiving dinner (should have just made lasagna). It's all the worse for Garfield, who has been put on a diet by Liz, ruining his favorite day of the year! Luckily, a change of heart and quick call to Jon's grandma saves the day for everyone!

Finally, from 1987 we have ""A Garfield Christmas Special."" Garfield dreams of having the perfect Christmas at home with gaudy decorations and lasagna and presents galore! His dreams are shattered when Jon informs him that they'll be spending Christmas with his family on the farm this year. Soon, everyone is together at Jon's childhood home. Jon, Garfield, Odie, Ma and Pa Arbuckle, Grandma, and Jon's brother Doc-Boy take us through all their Christmas traditions, from a big Christmas Eve meal to decorating the tree, to singing around the piano and reading their favorite Christmas story. Jon and Doc-Boy feel and act like kids again, awake all night in anticipation of opening their Christmas gifts the next morning! Garfield, meanwhile, forms a bond with Jon's feisty grandma and gives her the greatest gift she could receive on Christmas. It's a heartwarming and tear-jerking holiday special you won't forget!

These three Garfield holiday specials are true classics, and, honestly, I'm surprised they're not quite as old as I thought. I certainly remember watching them as a kid, and it is great to finally have them all to watch whenever I want! There just aren't enough Halloween and Thanksgiving specials out there, and these two are fantastic! And, as for Christmas, few animated Christmas specials are this real and emotional! Full of great songs, characters, stories, and animation, this disc is a must have for the Garfield and holiday lover's DVD library!

2114100,5,B0002PYS74,"These three Garfield specials have been part of my childhood and now can be enjoyed even as an adult. A lot of the other reviews already gush over my favorite parts, so I won't bore you with posting any the same. I will however point out that the Halloween special has been edited and is not the full version shown on television.

Once Garfield and Odie return home after their scary adventure they are about to walk up the sidewalk to their house when they notice that the ghost pirates have followed them home. Scared, they both race up a tree with their candy as the ghosts circle the base of the tree waiting for them to come down. While up on a branch Garfield asks Odie why they are still after them but then notices that there is a gold coin in one of the Halloween sacks. Garfield then takes it and drops it down to the ghosts. They smile upon seeing the coin and vanish, after which Garfield and Odie are safely able to go into the house.

I have a feeling that this scene may have been taken out of the DVD release so as to not scare little kids into thinking that ghosts can follow them home. Still, I kind of feel bad the scene was taken out as it was a very memorable scene. But if you can live with the edited version, I strongly suggest you buy this set as they are just great.",1118620800,74,1292,4.164

Two years later, A Garfield Christmas Special, an Emmy nominee, became an annually looked-for seasonal tradition. 1989 brought another Emmy for Garfield's Thanksgiving Special. That was also the year Jim Davis redesigned his comic cat. Film Roman would bring the new Garfield to life in a an ambitious weekly series, the wonderful Garfield and Friends, now out on DVD. Setting milestones in every area of animation, the carefully crafted, wittily written, winningly-voiced, subtle, amiable, ground-breaking show would establish Film Roman as a leading studio that would take animation to new heights with The Simpsons.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the Halloween ep is kinda scary for toddlers. My son is 2.5 and was basically shaking, hiding behind me when the ghosts were swirling around when they got to the haunted house and he didn't like the man who told the story either.

When my son's around I just play the Thanksgiving and Christmas ep's, When he's gone I play them all. ""Nice touch""...",1105833600,,665,4.1875
2114104,5,B0002PYS74,"I'm really beginning to enjoy these DVD releases of the Garfield TV specials. In this one we are treated to the Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas shows. And they're all great.

'Gimme!' Such a wonderful way to ask for candycandycandycandy. Well it's Garfield's way. And candy he certainly gets in this wonderful Halloween Special. It all starts on one cozy Halloween morn with Garfield waking to the sound of the TV. Normally he'd be irate at waking so early but when he learns what day it is he cannot wait to go trickortreating and get his paws on some candycandycandycandy!

He and Odie dress as pirates and go off on an adventure that happens to involve the ghosts of REAL pirates and real buried treasure. In the course of these brilliant 25 minutes we get the typical assortment of great Garfield humor and wonderful songs.

If only the movie were this good.

As for the incredibly sweet Thankgiving episode, once again, Garfield proves he can pull off more in 25 minutes than movies that take 4 times that long. It's Thanksgiving and Jon loves to make a huge deal of it. On a trip to the vet (keep a lookout for Orson the Pig in the waiting room) he manages to pluck up enough courage to ask out Dr. Liz on a date. Amazed? Well she actually accepts, how crazy is that? If only she knew what she was getting in to.

Jon doesn't plan the Thanksgiving dinner very well. He's got NO clue how to work a kitchen. And he's on the verge of blowing his big chance with Liz. But Grandma Arbuckle comes to the rescue. And so John, Liz, Garfield and Odie sit together at the table for lovely evening in which Jon actually manages to impress Liz. Well, will wonders never cease?

Finally there is the Christmas Special. Is it just me or do the Garfield TV specials seem to have a real emotional touch to them that gives the whole series higher integrity than the average children's animation.

It's Xmas time once again and Jon takes Garfield and Odie back home to the farm for a good, old-fashioned country Xmas. Originally against the idea, Garfield quickly becomes accustomed when he remembers how much he likes Grandma. John and brother Doc-Boy behave like kids again and can barely contain their excitement at the forthcoming prezzies (who can?) and what on earth is Odie up to in the barn?

The Garfield Christmas Special is a warm, sentimental and meaningful cartoon with great songs (once again) and the kind of everlasting charm most would kill for. Highly recommended!

The episodes are presented in 1.33:1 full frame, as drawn, with Dolby Mono sound and no extras. NOTE: The R2 version replaces the Thanksgiving episode with Garfield in the Rough.",1103500800,,2656,4.646055437100213
