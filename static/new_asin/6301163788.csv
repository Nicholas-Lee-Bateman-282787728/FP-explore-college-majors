312345,5,6301163788,"OK, WE ALL REALIZE THAT JEAN-CLAUDE VAN DAMME IS A GOD... BUT THIS MOVIES PROVES IT. YES, YES, I KNOW THAT THIS WAS ONE OF HIS EARLY MOVIES, AND THE ACTING MAY LEAVE A BIT TO BE DESIRED, BUT OVER ALL, IT WAS A GREAT MOVIE!  NOT ONLY THE MAIN CHARACTER IS THE SEXIEST MAN ON EARTH, BUT THE PLOT IS  WELL WRITTEN. IT HAS A GOOD DEVELPOING THEME ON PRIDE AND INTEGRITY. THE  MARTIAL ARTS ASPECT IS GOD, AS WELL AS THE DRAMA.
I WOULD DEFINITLY URGE  OTHERS TO SEE IT!",945907200,2,463,4.0
312346,1,6301163788,"All right...in this genre of film, the only saving grace is usually the choreography.  The acting almost always bites, the stories are unoriginal, and the characters are just too cheesy for words.
But this movie had some  of the worst fight choreography I've ever seen.
I'll admit that I'm a fan  of the old school, but there are several ""modern"" chop-socky  flicks I like - ""Revenge of the Ninja,"" most of Jackie Chan's  80/90's work...heck, even the first ""Lethal Weapon"" counts (the  end fight does, at least).
But this movie really sucked.  Truly.  ESPECIALLY the fight scenes.
Now, I hate it when they speed the film up  to make the moves look faster, but these guys were moving WAY too slow and  the movements were simply NOT REALISTIC.  So Bolo's winning the fight, and  suddenly, he can't put up a guard against a flying spin kick?
huh?
Van  Damme's movies generally bite anyway, but this one was just  atrocious.
Probably his best one to date is ""Kickboxer.""
But  this ""classic"" shouldn't be preserved...just let it rot like the  garbage it is.",924825600,2,1053,4.734806629834254

312408,5,6301163788,"A classic Martial Arts movie: Full of action packed scenes, suspense, emotions and morals.. A must see if you haven't already!!",1514160000,,127,5.095238095238095
312409,3,6301163788,Purchased the movie Bloodsport for my husband since its one of his favorite movies but received a 4- film favorite that also included 3 films that he doesn't like.  Kept it since it was a Christmas gift and I received it on Christmas Eve.  This is the second issue I've had with Amazon within 2 weeks.,1514073600,,301,4.357142857142857
312410,1,6301163788,It won't play in my DVD player very disappointed,1513641600,,48,4.444444444444445
312411,4,6301163788,"Based on the allegedly ""true"" story of martial artist Frank Dux, ""Bloodsport"" follows Dux (Jean-Claude Van Damme) as he travels to Hong Kong's famed Kowloon Walled City to fight in a secret, international, no-holds-barred mixed martial arts tournament--the Kumite.  Joined in the contest by fellow American Ray Jackson (Donald Gibb), Dux faces off against a bevy of fighters from around the globe, showcasing numerous martial arts styles, until (of course) having to square off against defending champion and evil bad guy Chong Li (veteran martial artist Bolo Yeung).  All the while, Dux is pursued by American reporter Janice Kent (Leah Ayres) and two U.S. Army CID officers (Norman Burton and Forest Whitaker).

This is an odd film.  Made in the late '80s, set in the early '80s (although the ""true story"" it purports to follow would have been set in the late 70s), and filmed on shoe-string budget, it has flaws--a LOT of flaws.  The acting is uniformly terrible.  The script is uniformly awful.  There are some pretty gaping plot holes, not least of which being the ""secret underground"" martial arts tournament which forms the centerpiece of the picture and everybody seems to know about.  The story takes a painfully long time to really get rolling, focusing on various cringe-worthy flashbacks to set up Van Damme's protagonist, then introducing a group of cookie-cutter secondary characters who, truth be told, really don't add anything beyond standard cliches to the picture.  Honestly, it plays out as the very, very bad low-budget martial arts film which it is...right up until the fighting starts.

And then we get to see the only reason to actually watch this film.  The series of fights centering on Dux, Jackson, and Li during the Kumite are VERY well choreographed, and feature some very, very good (and very real) martial artists.  Just as interesting are the variety of styles on display by the various combatants: from muay thai to karate, sumo to ju jitsu, and just about everything else you can imagine (to include Jackson's bar-room brawling), these fight scenes are not only the highlight of ""Bloodsport"", they are some of the better battles ever put on film.

If you're a film snob, you probably passed this one by as soon as you saw Jean-Claude Van Damme as the top-billed ""actor"".  If you're a fan of B-movies in general, this is one that can be skipped.  But if you're a fan of the martial arts, it's worth sitting through all the attempts at storytelling to get to those fight scenes throughout the second half of the run time.  Three stars would probably be a more justifiable rating, but cheesy nostalgia is worth the fourth star for me.",1513555200,2,2666,4.917410714285714

312413,5,6301163788,"Bloodsport is an amazing fighting film. It follows the classic Rocky formula, but if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Van Damme is fantastic and really pulls you into the fights. In the dialogue heavy scenes and dancing scene in particular, I'm not sure what he was intending, but it's all very entertaining and funny in a lot of cases, intentional or not. The villain is also one of the best I've ever seen in a martial arts film. It's a fun, exciting film that goes by really fast and has a lot of memorable moments.",1513296000,,515,4.375

312415,4,6301163788,"Yes, Bloodsport is cheesy. Yes, the fighting scenes are extremely unrealistic. Yes, there is a cloud of controversy regarding the veracity of this ""true"" story about the experiences of Frank Dux. Despite all that Bloodsport is a classic martial arts movie. I've watched the movie numerous times since I was a kid and enjoyed it each time. Recently I re-watched it with my wife, who had never seen it before, and we both thought it was great.

Is it a good movie? No. But it's a classic due to its excessive 80's kitsch, nostalgia for a simpler bloodier bygone movie era, and historical importance. I would recommend this move to anyone with a passing interest in martial arts movies or 80's throwbacks. Just don't take it too seriously.",1512864000,,736,4.75

312549,5,6301163788,"I remember the morning of july 12th 1991.  It was raining and unseasonably chilly.  I was but a child.  It was one of the last summers in which the only responsibility I had was to decide if I wanted to go swimming or play baseball.  My older sisters were away at girl scout camp and my mother offered to bring my brother and I to the vhs rental store.  It didn't take long for my brother and I to gravitate to the martial arts section.  We (obviously) chose 1990's TMNT because like duh.  However, my moms let us pick another movie, we chose Bloodsport.
This was the first JCVD we've seen.  Little did we know, that day we would both become men.
But (real talk) that TMNT from 1990 was seriously kick ass.  Golden Harvest was at the top of their game and successfully made a live action ninja film rather than going with muppets.  They stunt men in those turtle costumes were clinical with their moves.  Why can't we see a TMNT film made like that again.  I mean, I'd rather watch TMNT III than the new ones.

I would have paid for it since I'm trying to trim down my physical collection and start collecting on my digital collection. Anyway on with the movie.

Classic plot: retribution for his master, flashbacks to when he was a chubby kid and karate helped put him on track, revenge for master's son who died tragically. I love that revenge of the nerds star was in this as well. Acting is horrible, but the fight sequences and music were well put together and you know you are rooting for Frank Dux!

312589,5,6301163788,"Based on a true story, Van Damme is Frank Dux, Dux like ""put up your dukes"". Hong Kong is the background of one man's journey to honor his teacher. Enter the Kumite , a legendary full contact competition nestled deep within a shadowy underworld in the heart of tourist paradise.

Basicly, the local authorities frown upon this activity, deemed ""blood sport"" and Frank is determined to enter this contest no matter the cost.

The cast of characters in this movie are great. From the main cast, to the other fighters with a dream for victory. It's kind of like the Street Fighter game , with diverse line up of international fighters.

There's a tad of romance in the movie, when Frank meets the nosey reporter lady who insists on making the ""big story"" and separate the myth from reality.
 Another friend he makes is Jackson, a big american biker looking kinda guy who is one of the best additions to the cast in this movie, he's a crude beer drinkin all american hot head who loves to bust people's heads open.
Along the way , Frank is pursued by two american government agents whose mission is to bring Frank back to the states. Apparently he went awol in the military so he could compete.

The plot is alright, the acting is well, okay haha. It's loosly based on a true story. So ya, take that how you want.  But all the characters are memorable and lovable. And we get to see Frank go through intense training via flashbacks , also scenes of his childhood how he first met his teacher.
The budget of this film was just enough, relying much on natural existing areas for sets. I'd say that the biggest prop in this film is the place where the Kumite is held.
 By the way, the matches in this movie are unforgettable. Van Damme is the real article, along with legendary Bolo Yeung, of asian Kung fu cinema fame. Bolo plays the undefeated bad guy, and he's ruthless as a South Korean fighter.

This movie is pretty funny too, sometimes unintentionally funny at times, but it makes it such a timeless 80s martial arts Classic. Filled with genuine martial artists and an awesome musica soundtrack.

A must buy for anyone who loves this era of martial arts movies. So it deserves 5 stars for the the awesome fighting, likable characters and amazing soundtrack.",1464825600,,2257,4.566831683168317

Do not expect a deep plot or well-developed stories. That said, the fighting is legit and surprisingly compelling. The motivations are simply but clear and by the end of the film you really do find yourself rooting for Van Damme. Please take note that this is a low-budget film from 1988 and there are instances of casual racism and sexism that are typical for the time but not so over the top that it makes the film unwatchable. It what I described sounds like fun, then you will give this 5 stars. If what I have described sounds bad then it is your fault for watching it.

Much can be said about Van Damme, but this movie has been so positively influential in my life.  It put in this deep seed of what real martial arts are about, the cultivation of discipline and focus.

312682,2,6301163788,"A few weeks ago, I watched Kickboxer, which was my first real JCVD martial arts movie (at this point, I don't consider seeing Street Fighter when it hit theaters anything). I wasn't impressed, and was laughing at so many things that were wrong in it, or how absurd certain aspects of it were that it ended up being enjoyable for me. When I saw that another classic, Bloodsport, was available to watch too, I threw it on my queue instantly. Not in the mood to watch anything that looked interesting, I settled on this one tonight and once again, was floored by how dumb it was. As expected, this was another 80s Movie: The Movie, full of cliches and poorly choreographed fight scenes. This shows you just how low standards were for martial arts movies in the 80s, as people my age and older are -still- talking about it for some reason.

Frank Dux is in the military and leaves when he finds out that a big fighting tournament is being held in China. He heads for the home of the man who taught him how to fight, to see if hell finish training him. It turns out that the mans son was killed in a kumite, and Frank wants to avenge him and restore honor to the father. The guy trains Frank over what seems to be a few days, and Frank leaves to enter the kumite. Fighters from all over the world have gathered here to find out who the strongest is. And thats essentially the entire plot of Bloodsport. You also have a quick love sub-plot involving a reporter who just wants to know about the kumite, and two military dudes who go on a Benny Hill-esque chase trying to get Frank back to the US. Frank also seems tove been bit by the bromance bug after meeting a big burly biker dude when he beats him at a karate arcade game.

Yeah, theres no depth here, and I don't think anyone would expect there to be any. I was actually surprised at how much fighting there was in Bloodsport, and how everything else took a backseat, even the would-be love plot. The movie starts out incredibly slow, with Franks training montage by the guy whos either Japanese or Chinese but they never say because back when this movie was made, no one bothered to figure any of that stuff out. This is something that bugged me because is a Japanese word used in karate, but they used it as the name of a tournament, and the tournament was held in China. The guy who trained Frank was teaching him karate and had a katana, but it also turns out that Frank learned Dim Mak, a Chinese stylethough here its used to destroy specific bricks in a stack. The whole things a mess. Not that anyone involved in making this movie cared, because it goes right into the action. And that, unfortunately, is another thing that bugged me. None of these fights were convincing. None of them. You have tons of fighters from all over the world, and not a single wrestler or grappler shows up. Most of the fighters have the tendency to whiff moves by at least a foot, sending the opponent flying back with blood spewing out of their mouth after getting hit in the leg. The final fight has a very obvious missed attack that goes in front of the guys face, who doesnt even attempt to dodge because theres no way it could hit him, but he still ends up blocking it. How do you make a movie with so much action, so many fights, boring? The guys responsible for Bloodsport managed to find a way.

I could go on and on about other goofy things in Bloodsport, but what got me the most was when I looked up info on the real Frank Dux. See, at the end of the movie, theres some text that pops up and says that the movie was based on the real life events of Frank, claiming that he had over 300 matches and was undefeated, and holds world records for fastest knockouts, fastest knockout with a punch and two others. I laughed out loud when I read this and went straight to researching him. And wouldnt you know it? The majority of links out there with his name in them also have fraud in the title. It seems that everything regarding Franks action-packed years are most likely made up. There was a picture of him posing in his military uniform, featuring medals for both the Army and the Marines. Its also argued that the trophy he won for the kumite he went to was actually bought at a trophy store not far from his home, AND the address for the group that put together the kumite was Franks own address. I guess Frank never expected that years down the road, people would easily find out things about other people, and lied himself into a hole.

The final thing that bugged me is how often the word kumite is thrown around. I don't think they said tournament once in the entire movie. If you did a drinking game, taking a shot every time they said kumite (and especially when its repeated in the chorus of a song, as it is the ONLY word in the chorus), you're going to have alcohol poisoning in no time.

I blame this movie in particular for the dumbing down of martial arts in the 90s. Yeah its only a movie but man, having these top fighters at what should be the grandest stage, practically taking turns hitting each other and not reacting to anything with counters of any sort make a dumb action movie even dumber. It gets 2 stars just for making me laugh a couple of times, and because the Muay Thai guy was the only one who put in any effort, even if his opponents didnt.",1445212800,2,5316,4.317317317317317

It worked out so well that 2 years later, in 1988 I was once again, back in Hong Kong with JCVD as the Director of KICKBOXER...

312866,5,6301163788,"Greatest Movie of All Time; it's one of my favorites, anyway.  It's certainly a cultural timepiece and must have inspired video games like Mortal Kombat.  The movie displays a number of fighting styles that must have hailed from a time before organized MMA coalesced all these styles into a similar aesthetic.  Jean-Claude Van Damme (in the role of Frank Dux, kumite legend) is a powerhouse, and the movie brings a certain machismo with it.  There are many memorable moments from the movie, including the initial training scenes and the championship combat with Chong Li (played by Bolo).  It is a no-apologies masculine story of Frank Dux fighting at his prime.  There is a healthy amount of blood and foul language but none too much to overshadow the rawness and reality of the martial arts being put into practice in this movie.

This is the movie that made him a star. Bloodsport is a classic! Not much of a plot or dialogue to be all amazed about but the classic fight scenes that make Bloodsport a masterpiece. No wires, no stunt doubles, no crazy special effects. Bloodsport was defined with hand to hand and pure fight scenes to where the actors were real fighters. Van Damme isn't the best at acting until recent years with films such as (JCVD, IN HELL, REPLICANT, THE EXPENDABLES 2 AND ENEMIES CLOSER) But I thought Universal Soldier and Timecop were some great blockbusters. Bloodsport also inspired UFC and Mortal Kombat and some other later martial arts films. This movie is worth a lot more and I hate that it's going to be remade by hollywood in the future. If they were smart they would at least have Van Damme as a part of the remake and not screw it up like Adam Sandler did by casting Burt Reynolds in the longest yard remake.",1414713600,,1077,4.336633663366337

313109,5,6301163788,"In 1987 Belgian Martial Art star Jean Claude Van Damme starred in this movie ""Bloodsport"" that launched his career and made him an international celebrity.  This is basically a rip-off of Bruce Lee's ""Enter The Dragon"" and even has as the main bad guy the great Bolo Yeung starring as Chong-Li, a martial arts champion and winner of the ""kumite"" a tournament where you fight your opponent in the ring and is quite lethal.  Well, Van Damme stars as Frank Dux, a real person who was a martial arts champion and winner of the Kumite.  It is a full contact tournament.  Van Damme had definite great martial arts moves and did a great job, however you can tell this is his first main speaking role, but he does okay.  The supporting actors are decent enough with Donald Gibb (Ogre from Revenge of the Nerds) as Dux's friend in the tournament, and the female interest is Leah Ayres (who nobody knew before the film, and nobody knew after the film).

The fighting is great, different styles are used in the film, the action is somewhat intense, and this is a good movie for the basic ""guys who like movies"".  This is mindless fun that makes womens eyes roll, but hey this movie isn't for the ""sensitive"" types.  It's a movie that is great on a rainy afternoon sitting in the man cave!

313153,3,6301163788,"Loosely based on the life of fighter Frank Dux, Bloodsport (1988) has a very familiar storyline, where a westerner trained in the martial arts goes to Hong Kong, to participate in a fighting tournament known as the Kumite (""sparring"" in Japanese).  Jean-Claude Van Damme is in top form physically, his acting is reasonably good, and his boyish charm shines through, making Frank Dux a likeable hero.  The fights feature flashy choreography, leading to an eventual showdown between Dux, and the current champion, Chang Li (Bolo Yeung).

Against the wishes of his superior officer, soldier Frank Dux leaves his base, and visits his marital arts sensei and mentor Senzo Tanaka (Roy Chiao) who is in poor health.  Tanaka had been training his son to participate in the Kumite, but after his son's untimely death, Dux replaces him as Tanaka's representative.  Arriving in Hong Kong, Dux becomes friends with fellow American fighter Ray Jackson (Donald Gibb), local fight organizer Victor Lin (Kenneth Siu), and reporter Janice Kent (Leah Ayres).

Dux is followed to Hong Kong by Helmer (Norman Burton) and Rawlins (Forest Whitaker), a pair of military police types, who want to prevent him from fighting, and bring him back to face charges.  Defending champ Chang Li (Bolo Yeung) is destroying his opponents with brutal ferocity, and severely injures Jackson in a match.  Emotions run high, and dirty tricks are employed, when Dux and Li meet for the championship.

With a secret tournament featuring numerous top fighters, Bloodsport has superficial similarity to Enter The Dragon, perhaps at this time, the most well known Hollywood produced martial arts film.  To its credit, Bloodsport does attempt to show some respect for Asian traditions as Dux trains with Tanaka, and learns some spiritual aspects of fighting, as well as the physical.  A bulked up Van Damme is in fantastic physical condition, and frequently displays his amazing flexibility.  His fighting moves are very solid, although he doesn't always have the charisma and presence to dominate the screen.  .

As you might expect, the fight choreography isn't very realistic, but it is mostly entertaining.  Bolo Yeung, probably most known for being in Enter The Dragon (1973), is pretty menacing as a one dimensional villain, although like many of the fighters, Yeung is limited as an actor, and has his voiced dubbed.  Key supporting characters like Ray Jackson and Janice Kent, aren't given a lot of depth, and along with Helmer, Rawlins, and Siu, are mostly window dressing.  Now regarded as a cult classic, Bloodsport was a solid financial success that has thus far spawned three sequels.  The film is elevated by the presence of Jean-Claude Van Damme and Bolo Yeung, who are the primary reasons to see the film.",1328572800,,2776,5.103982300884955

If you like Bloodsport, you'll more than likely enjoy ""The Quest"" which is basically the same idea, kumite, fighting for sword/pendant,training sequences galore, van damme doing the splits and the same roundhouse kicks...in the end, he gets the girl and garners the respect of the fighting communtity over, end of movie. :)",1313884800,,556,5.032608695652174

313171,5,6301163788,"Hello,

I initially saw Bloodsport at the Movies when I was fifteen, and it had a profound impact on me.

Now older, I have bought a copy and these are the points (for me) which make this movie so effective:

* The producers/director really gives us the feel of the ""back-streets"" of Honk-Kong where this competition occurs. From the poor dirty corridors, to the washer in the Kumite who grabs a gold tooth left-over from a fight. The ambiance and setting is very-well set.

* This movie feels realistic. There are no 100-foot leaps from ""Ninjas"" who land without a scratch... Also, the ""Dim Mak"" sequence also feels real; it comes down to learning and practicing all your life a particular technique and method... I have seen karatekas break bricks on TV so it is no stretch of the imagination if a master is proficient enough in this skill to control which brick (s)he can break...

* I love all the various fighters in this movie: from Chong-Li, to the Italian ""Paco"", to the big Sumo fighter, to the African fighter who fights on all fours,... This variety helps add personality and spice to all these fighting scenes.

* Lastly, a big thank you to the actors, not only Jean-Claude Van Damme, but Bolo Yeung as well. I love his one-liners! His mannerisms and looks also re-enforce what he says very well too!

313174,5,6301163788,"With today's Hollywood seemingly running out of original ideas and the spew of so-called Old School Action movies this year: The Losers, The A-Team (which isn't really old school as they've used CGI in places) and The Expendables (message to Stallone and his representatives: Please don't ruin my adolescent years by making this a girly PG-13!)- it's a pleasure to revisit The Muscles from Brussels, Jean-Claude Van Damme or JVCD, in what is arguably a movie that is 70% action and 30% story. The premise is that Jean's Frank Dux (Dukes on whose story this is based on...even I had forgotten that fact) wants to take part in Kumite (the Bloodsport of the title), to honour his not-so-well master, Tanaka (Roy Chiao). Frank's an army man and against the wishes of his superiors, flies out to Hong Kong (hotly pursued by Forest Whitaker & his faithful sidekick, Kato - just kidding!) Well, you know the rest from there, as I'm sure other Amazon folk have synopsosised this to death!

Admittedly, the movie has moments of bad acting, BUT that adds gravitas and lends a certain charm to the whole proceedings. This is after all, the glorious 1980s, where money was more readily available and even the so-called low budget fare like this (made and distributed by Cannon...I miss those guys! Did they later become Golan Globus?) - looked expensive and colourful, too. Even more impressive is the fact there are no wire-work sequences at all (compare it to the fact that in a gym, old school free weights are better than using crappy machines which can damage you some more!) and none of the choppy, quick editing that's so prevalent in today's actioners (Paul Greengrass, are you reading this, Sir?). In fact, I would say the last decent martial arts I've seen in the last 20 years are ""Perfect Weapon"" with Jeff Speakman (why hasn't that seen the light-of-day on DVD?) and 1997's Drive with Mark Dacascos.

All too often, you hear the term ""a man's film"" bandied around, but this for me is up there with the Die Hards, Lethal Weapons and Commandos! I love the genuine onscreen chemistry between Van Damme & Donald Gibb's Ray Jackson - and even after they've declared their undying devotion to each other, with Ray declaring: ""Anytime, any place, if you ever need me...I'll be there"", that to me, is the non-gay, ultimate Man Love declaration, right there in your face, hahaha! Whatever you think of Tom Cruise, Top Gun definitely spawned the whole 1980s ""You can be my Wingman"" mentality (let me take a minute here to breathe, I'm just getting emotional again...) Which reminds me, I need to book my place for 80s throwback comedy Hot Tub Time Machine!

Another vital component of 80s film culture is the obligatory pretty blonde...here played with perfection by Leah Ayres. Yes, she's a tad ditzy and allows her character to become the center of attention for grown-up men to fight over her, but who cares? She's drop-dead gorgeous, her hair is gloriously permed and at least she has a natural body which makes her dresses look sooooo, mmmm! It was also a joy to know that Stan Bush lent his vocal talents to the Official Soundtrack, after doing the same thing for the Transformers animated movie. Man, just hearing his songs have got me pumped-up! Speaking of which, I thought Jean-Claude nailed his death stare right-on-cue, even if his opponents were a deadly pile of bricks! I reckon they should have given Bolo Yeung's man-breasts an extra screen credit, which at times, seemed to involuntarily do their own acting! But Bolo, what a legend and what a good sport for playing chilling bad guys.

Loud synthesizers,dazzling action sequences and a great location (Hong Kong under British rule), no wonder Bloodsport is considered an all-time classic. This Blu-ray release is stunning and didn't think they could make an 80s classic look so fresh again. Along with Willis, Stallone and Schwarzenegger, Jean-Claude Van Damme should definitely be ranked along those guys for epitomising the 80s (and 90s to a lesser degree). I need to devote a weekend to watching pure 80s gold, such as No Retreat, No Surrender; Weird Science, Rocky, Terminator, Lethal Weapon, Die Hard, Rambo, etc. That'll be one pizza, Dr. Pepper and all the Man-roars to go, please!!

313176,3,6301163788,"Frank Dux (Van Damme), a Karate student of a Japanese master, decides to compete in a no holds barred sparring tournament in Hong Kong referred to as Kumite. He strives to win this bloody tournament in order to keep the legacy of his Karate master.

Before we judge this film, we need to keep in mind that it is an 80s film, meaning that the action delivered should not be compared to the action we get in 2009 movies. However, I still wasn't very pleased with the action since the movie was obviously a low budget one and could have been made much better. Take for example ""Best of the Best"" and ""No Retreat No Surrender"" movies, which were made in the same period however delivered better action scenes. However lets also remember that this was one of Van Damme's first movies where he is the main star and perhaps not many wanted to bet on it being a success, this is why not much was spent on producing it.

There was no real story to tell. There was no main plot. The whole movie was packed with punching and kicking scenes that got quite repetitive after a while. I think the best part of the movie is the final fight between Van Damme and Bolo, which was full of amazing fighting techniques.

However, one of the reasons why this movie is so popular is that Van Damme made some great shows with his amazing techniques. Take for example his flying kicks. This is also one of the first movies to illustrate no holds barred mixed martial arts competitions where you get fighters from different arts in competition. Perhaps this movie and others like it inspired the people who introduced to us the Ultimate Fighting Championship in the early 90s.

Based on the success of this movie, Van Damme starred in other great movies afterwards such as Kick Boxer and Double Impact. It was surely a great start for him.

Van Damme is currently starring in a new film called ""Karate"", which is somehow similar to the idea of bloodsport. He will be playing the role of a Karateka who is fighting in a tournament against Mixed Martials Artists and will surely give them a lot of beatings. He will be somehow like UFC's light heavy weight champion, Lyoto Machida. This should be an amazing film.",1259452800,,2185,4.507575757575758

313216,5,6301163788,"I eagerly await the prequel, Bloodbirth, currently in production telling the story of a young Frank Dux born with his umbilical cord wrapped around his throat. Stan Dux, Frank's once kindhearted sweater knitting father, blames his wife for the accident. Stan begins drinking heavily. His drinking becomes out of control and culminates in a scene at his son's 6th birthday party.

Upset and disoriented after a particularly viscous round in the moonwalker, he vomits on his boss's wife before challenging him to arm wrestle. When his boss declines, he runs inside only to return moments later wearing a karate gui and sporting the $300,000 conquistador helmet he had appraised at antiques roadshow. He is greeted with the silent stares of concerned parents while the voice of Rick Derringer ominously begins blaring ""I am a real American"" from the stereo. From the front porch, he surveys the lawn and chooses his target. Like a man possessed, he charges Tinkles the clown, headbutting him into a coma before turning his attention to the pony.  The pony, already skittish from the clown's beating, rears and dropps a child to the grass.  Thankfully, before the pony is able to trample the child, Stan greets him with a ferocious scissor kick to the spine sending him to his knees spurting a violent stream of an organ/excrement slush like a tube of toothpaste that just had a bowling ball dropped on it.  Chaos ensues.

Parents and children screaming run from the scene trampling the bloodied unconscious clown, the pony howling in his death throes as Stan, enraged at the pony's lack of fight, continues to brutally scissor kick until the midget, hired by Luvable Hugables petting zoo, wearing an all black t-shirt with white letters in all caps spelling ENFORCER across his chest and a crossbow full of tranq darts  is able to subdue him.

His marriage is now on the rocks and in the depths of a 72 hour Sparks and Grey Goose binge, he begins to beat his wife Mary blaming her for the birthing incident that resulted in their son's motor skills becoming so impaired that he speaks with a Belgian accent. Little did Stan know...that on that dark day where he murdered his wife by repeatedly slamming her head into a refrigerator door, that the accident had actually imbued Frank with super strength and reflexes rivaling those of legendary quarterback Jeff George.

Onto the film.
A young American boy (played by Dustin Diamond) mysteriously wearing a New York Giants Shirt and a San Francisco Giants cap is peer pressured into breaking into an aging Vietnamese man's home. The Vietnamese man, a noted Samurai warrior, is so impressed by young Frank's love of all things Giant that he decides to teach him the way of the Samurai. After many days of training, Frank has grown into a noted CIA agent and gained super powers through utilization of an intense kung-fu focus that allows him to sense attacks while serving tea blindfolded and the ability to capture koi with his bare hands, also while blindfolded. One might wonder why the early plot development has such a focus on fighting while blindfolded.....but that's because you are stupid.

Frank is later summoned to the Kumite, a world where violence and intrigue are mingled with casual sex and even more intrigue.  I'll stop here as I don't want to take you any further into this modern take on Shakespeare's Hamlet but suffice to say that while most movies flounder and fall short after such an epic opening, Bloodsport is a non stop thrill ride that will have you swearing that each scene is the greatest moment of your life and gives the whispered words ""Mateeee..."" dominion over Citizen Kane's ""Rosebud"" for cinematic significance.

If you could take all the music ever made and compress it using ""science"" it would be but a flickering candle to the sun that is the soundtrack for this movie. Bishop's Steal the Night makes angels weep, but be careful of the setting you are in while listening to Fight to Survive as without the accompanying video to focus your mind, you may go into a rage so powerful that you enter the telephone lines ala the lawnmower man.",1226880000,,4122,4.824362606232294

313249,3,6301163788,"It's kind of difficult to write a review for ""Bloodsport"" if you're neither a hardcore fan nor a devoted detractor of the movie. For certain it has its place in history, and for certain a lot of its aspects hold up favorably to some of the cut & paste work Jean-Claude Van Damme phoned in during the later years of his career, but personally, I regard the movie as I would a Sherman tank: a physical powerhouse of its time worthy of commendation but no longer a winner of conflicts. Far be it for me to not have this classic in my personal collection, but I can think of a number of movies that have since done better at just about everything that this one had going for it.

The plot: supposedly based on a true story, martial artist Frank Dux (Van Damme,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Timecop/dp/0783225520/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Timecop</a>) deserts his military duty to answer his deceased master's call to the Kumite - a fabled underground tournament bringing together the world's top fighters to determine who the best of the best is.

It's noteworthy that this film was Van Damme's stepping stone into Hollywood, considering that all of its campy faults could've just as easily done it in and stopped his career before it started. Parts of this movie are so poorly staged and so poorly acted that it's almost enough to make you turn it off. Different from the misguided enthusiasm of Van Damme's previous cult classic,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Retreat-No-Surrender/dp/B0002848WQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Retreat, No Surrender</a>, this one has a couple scenes (most notably the flashbacks) in which the actors are giving such a slack-armed, poor-posture performance that you wonder whether they even want to be there. Of course, the alternative is a decent bit of overacting, which I prefer since it's fun to watch these big, tough guys let it all hang out because they don't know how to do it any better. It's especially entertaining to watch the movie in retrospect, knowing that it'd be a round two decades before Van Damme realize his dream of becoming a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/real-actor/dp/B001PWY4NG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""real actor.""</a>

Of course, his thematic ambitions seem unnecessary when considering the abundance of the film's selling point: tons and tons and tons of fights. Seriously, there's a lot. I've forgotten the exact number of brawls, but it's definitely one of the few I know of to exceed twenty hand-to-hand matches. And the variety of fighters and fighting styles-! Not since the heyday of Bruce Lee had there been such a cattle call for varied martial arts practitioners, representing disciplines from karate to muay thai, straight pit-fighting, monkey kung fu, and more. Never before in western cinema had there been such a flat out give-'em-what-they-want splash of nonstop martial arts action, one fight after another...although the quality of these fights fluctuates. No, I can't even say that: while half of the matches are split between so-so and very-good quality, the other half are only shown in segments or are over with too fast. This allows for several montage scenes wherein the action flows smoothly from one bout to the next, but it doesn't let you reminisce about quite as many separate thrills when you're thinking about the fights later.

The casting is solid. I really liked the inclusion Bolo Yeung (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Enter-the-Dragon/dp/6304981635/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Enter the Dragon</a>), who - through an almost purely physical performance - cemented himself as one of the few memorable villains in martial arts film history. Of course, why Forrest Whitaker (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-King-of-Scotland/dp/B000NIVJF4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last King of Scotland</a>) and his cohort are in this movie, conducting their own little subplot, still eludes me. As far as production values go, the movie is a model of efficiency, accomplishing more on a $1 million budget than a modern theatrical production could hope for (how the heck did they manage to pay all the fighters?). For accomplishments like this alone, ""Bloodsport"" deserves recognition, but it doesn't quite earn my love. Van Damme would outdo himself in the action department in later years, and as far as the tournament setup goes, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/underappreciated-sequel/dp/B00005MM61/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">underappreciated sequel</a>&nbsp;matched and improved on it. No karate buff ought to go without watching this film at least once - lord knows, many future features would have benefited if their directors had seen this one and built off of its standard - but it can only endear itself to me so much thanks to its limited but significant faults.",1212105600,,5024,5.785135135135135

313253,5,6301163788,"Hello B fans, Sid the Elf is back to review Bloodsport. We mean this in the straightest way possible when we say that the most impressive thing in the movie was when Van Damme does the splits. No, actually, this film was wonderful. We picked it on the spur of the moment and it didn't disappoint. It had everything we could ask for. There was horrific acting from everybody involved. This even includes Forrest Whittiker from 35,622 buckets of fried chicken ago. You have Jean-Claude Van Damme in his first starring role and he hit this one out of the park on the first try. Although we're not quite sure why they chose a local special needs fry chef to play the young Frank Dux, but it was more than made up for when we heard the kid talk and saw him get kicked in the chest by the little Chineese kid. Then you had Ray Jackson, the big cross-eyed guy, who was nothing short of hillarious. Finally, there was the one, the only Chong-Li. Here you had a jacked, utterly insane Korean who instead of pounding hot dogs like Kobyashi, ate 34 egg white omelettes in 8 minutes while training for the Kumate. He just has a presence. When the screen showed his name opposite Ray Jackson's Sid the Elf froze. It was momentous.

Bloodsport is actually a true story-seriously. It is about Frank Dux, the only American to ever win the Kumate. When he was a kid, Dux was taken in and trained by his Asian master. In a hilarious sequence, we see Young Dux(sounds like a rapper doesn't it?)learning all the awesome tricks he would later unleash in competition. When his master is on his death bed, Dux goes AWOL from the military to see him. After his death, Dux decides to honor his master by entering the Kumate. So, he not only has to fight  insane opponents, like the completely frightening Chon Li, in the Kumate, he also has to elude Military Police who know he's at the Kumate and want to bring him back home. What makes Bloodsport such an awesome guy's movie is that the majority of the movie revolves around either karate fighting or training to karate fight. There are just too many cool or funny happenings in the movie to recount them all.  As we, Sid the Elf, like to do when there's just too much to go over, we'll break this one down Joe Bob style and let you use it as a guide when you watch Bloodsport. Here are the Drive-In totals:

3 bricks broken, 1 with a head-butt

1 compound leg fracture

2 tazerings

1 skinny Forrest Whitiker falling off a boat

1 partially nude Van Damme

1 pair of red bikini briefs worn by the Muscles from Brussels

1 Mr. Fuji style eye salting

56 hilarious facial expressions

1 ref beating courtesy of Chong-Li

1 homicide in the ring

313257,5,6301163788,"In the movie Bloodsport, Jean-Claude Van Damme and the other actors do a fantastic job playing their roles. Van Damme became a big celebrity after starring in this film. It's inspiring to see him train and fight. It amazes me on how he's super flexible and is in great condition. The statement Frank's shedoshi said, ""It brings mind, body, and spirit together"" is the truth. It makes me think to myself, ""You can do anything if you put your mind to it.""",1165449600,,453,4.536585365853658

313288,5,6301163788,"The sucess and popularity of Bloodsport makes this movie one of Van Damme's very best ever.  Bloodsport also marks Van Damme's first role as the main character in a movie. (The previous film he had a role in was ""No Retreat No Surrender"" in which he played the villain but had a much smaller role).  Bloodsport went on to make 3 more sequals, however without Van Damme.  This first installment is overall the best, ""a true classic"", althouh I find certain elements are more appealing in some of the sequals.

The story in Bloodsport is fairly original for its time and the acting is not too bad, even though half the people in this movie seem to barely speak English well (Van Damme included).  Now when I say not too bad, I'm coming from the fact that I'm pretty hardcore about cheesy martial art movies - most have baaaaaaaaad acting.  The great thing about the story is that it is based on the true events of Frank Dux (played by Van Damme), who was the first Westerner to ever win the kumite and to hold several records.  The soudtrack to this movie, I hate to admit for an 80's film, is very nice.  I enjoy both the original music composed by Paul Hertzog, and some of the songs, by Survivor I think (same group who performed Eye of the Tiger in Rocky III).  I even enojyed the opening credits scene - it sets the tone for the movie wonderfully.

The real meat and potatoes of Bloodsport, of course is the tournament.  There are plenty of fights, many very short, and some that don't look very realistic.  Not many fancy moves, but its always a treat to see Bolo Yeung as the villain, ""Chong Li"", on the platform. The final fight between Dux and Chong Li lasts about 7 minutes, but a lot of it is in slow motion with some of those ""now somewhat cheesy flashbacks"" to early training scenes.  The end of the fight showcases Van Damme's leaping spinning split kicks that quickly became his signature move and can be seen in more of his following films including Kickboxer and Double Impact.  If you wanna see another fight between Van Damme and Bolo Yeung, be sure to check out Double Impact.",1155859200,5,2094,4.447643979057592
313289,5,6301163788,"Van Damme's best martial arts movie - heck perhaps best movie ever, considering his others were lousy except for Timecop and In Hell. Bloodsport can arguably be ranked right behind Enter The Drgaon as a true fight classic. In fact, in many ways, Bloodsport not only gets inspiration from Bruce Lee's masterpiece, but by finally seeing the massive baddie Bolo fight a worthy opponent, it does it one better.

One of the most incredible visuals and kinetically amazing cast members of Enter The Dragon was Bolo Yeung. Never actually classically trained as a martial artist, Bolo was a Chinese bodybuilder - sort of China's Schwarzenegger. He was bigger than life, bigger than Bruce, bigger than anybody he shared the screen with, yet when the credits rolled, he had only broken the necks of a few lame bodyguards and had fought Roper, played by John Saxon. Now, Saxon is a fine actor and a pretty good martial artist, however he's no Bruce Lee. The confrontation everyone was waiting for in Enter The Dragon never happened, until that is Bloodsport came along.

Now, yes, Van Damme isn't Bruce Lee. There are many who would say he couldn't hold Bruce Lee's jockstrap. But in his muscular prime his lightning fast style has beyond most come close to Lee's high kicking, hard punching brand of film fighting. So when Chong Li severely injures Frank Dux's big buddy Ray Jackson, you know Frank's gonnna get revenge and we're gonna get the fight we never got but wanted to see in Enter The Dragon.

Certainly there are many other good things about this movie. The acting is always decent, Forest Whitaker plays an FBI agent in an early role and even Van Damme is relaxed, confident and comes off better than most any other role. However when all is said and done, Bloodsport works on a purely adrenalin pumped level of martial arts action that is unmatched - save for Enter The Dragon. So, when the credits roll this time, we're satisfied that someone as incredible as Bolo has been used to full measure and the [...] kicking we longed for is the high point of this movie - visually and emotionally.",1155081600,16,2093,4.713114754098361
313290,4,6301163788,"I remember the first time I saw the movie on TBS in the U.S. As usual, I started watching half-way into it and I was amazed by an unknown actor/star (Van Damme) who captivated my interest with some of the most awe-inspiring martial arts moves I'd have ever seen at the time. As a young teenager, this movie was very inspiring (to get involved in martial arts).

Plot - B

Does a movie such as this need a plot to be an enjoyable movie? Simple answer is no. The plot is very basic. A soldier (Frank Dux) in the U.S. military goes A.W.O.L. to compete in a no-holds-barred tournament in Asia (think Ultimate Fighting Championship--Asian style). He is competing to fulfill a promise to his old martial arts mentor. The U.S. military sends two agents after him to bring him back in one piece and to keep him from competing. Along the way he makes a friend (who is also competing in the tournament) and a girlfriend (who is a reporter who is covering the tournament). Expect lots of different styles of martial arts fights with Van Damme's fights being the most impressive. The side stories of the friendships and the relationships are not fleshed out very well. The movie is all about the action! According to interviews, the original cut was unreleasable. Van Damme went back and re-cut the movie and even 16-18 years later, the movie holds its own in the martial arts movie genre.

Acting - C

The acting is pretty bad from all, except for the small role of a military agent (played by a young Forrest Whitaker). Van Damme is young and very goodlooking, but it doesn't compensate for his trouble with the dialogue and his rather wooden presence (even in the romantic interludes). He does display at times a boyish charm, but it does not occur often enough. Who needs acting skills when you can dazzle with your martial art skills.

Music - B

I found the music soundtrack (which I actually own) to be quite entertaining and fit perfectly in a fight-type movie. The songs were done mostly by  Paul Hertzog and reminded me of the fight anthems of Rocky IV (by Survivor). Very original to this movie and remain among my favorite of any fight type movie.

Cinematography - C

The movie occurs mostly indoors (with a few shots of the Asian streets) so there isn't much to comment on. The choreography of the fights and the camera angles really make the fights appear authentic and rather gruesome.

DVD - D

The only extras are a trailer and some behind the scenes info you can read. Typical ""movie-only"" release for this kind of film.

Overall - B

If you are wanting to relive '80's fight action movies or are a martial arts fan, this is the movie for you. Very good movie and I consider it one of Van Damme's best.",1147305600,,2709,4.515337423312883
313291,5,6301163788,"There's only one word to describe this movie: suhweeeeeeeet! Despite the dozens of imitators, Bloodsport was the first and best of its kind. From the classic training sequence where young Frank Dux masters the martial arts (and receives the katana he coveted as a boy), to the motley group of tournament fighters with their goofy fighting techniques, to the repeated chanting of ""Ku-mi-te! Ku-mi-te! Ku-mi-te!"" on the pounding soundtrack, there's hardly a moment that won't have you pumped and calling for more. The only parts that don't quite work are the chase scenes and a young Forest Whittaker, who seems not to have completely understood what sort of production he was appearing in. But they don't detract from the main attraction: bone-crushing, blood-spattering beatdowns, and plenty of 'em.

Plot: the Kumite is an international underground fighting contest that annually gathers the world's best fighters. Frank Dux (Van Damme) escapes from the US army to participate and to  honour his ageing ""Shidoshi"", Kenzo Tanaka.

Van Damme is in perfect shape, the setting is Hong Kong, and the Kumite is a full contact no-limits extravaganza of fighting styles.

We are treated to the powerful and evil Chong Li (the villain), Janice (fearless reporter and love interest), and most of all the awesome Ray Jackson, the protagonist's sidekick and most eccentric fighter to have ever participated in the Kumite.

Overall an excellent film, good rhythm, good choreography in the fights, and many unforgettable lines (""Brick not hit back"", ""Aren't you a little old for videogames?"" etc. etc.)

Belongs to the DVD library of every Van Damme connoisseur.",1141084800,3,939,5.144736842105263
313293,4,6301163788,"I just relived my teen years by viewing this film yesterday and let me say that I do see the similarities to Bruce Lee's classic ""Enter The Dragon"" now.

Yes, it is an ""ETD"" clone but as ""ETD"" clones go, its pretty damn good and stands on its own! Other than Kickboxer, Lionheart and perhaps the first Universal Soldier, this is easily Jean Claude Van Damme's best performance ever!

Like other reviewers, what kept me glued was the training montages and seeing all those different styles of fighting! While some of them were overplayed for the sake of film, many of these styles exist in real martial arts so it was fun to see them even if they were exaggerated a bit.

And while they didn't have any dialog, I found the other fighters to be engaging just by what they did on the Kumate mat! My favorite non-speaking character was, and still is, real-life fighter Paco! My friends and I loved him for some reason!

Bolo Yeung is the guy most young adolecent boys dream about being. Very little talk but all action! His portrayal of the villian Chong Li wasn't an acting masterpiece but it didn't need to be to convey that this was one bad mutha.....well you get the idea!

While this was based on the life of Frank Dux, the story has been exposed as fake in recent years. Still, even with that knowledge, its still a fun film to watch though it is toned down violence by today's standards. Imagine if they re-made this film today!? The level of violence would probably be off the page!

Van Damme, who had starred in other low-budget action films before this (most notably ""No Retreat, No Surrender""), got his first starring role in this film and enjoyed a good run from 1987 until about the mid-90's! Still, this is one of his brightest moments in film! Enjoy martial arts action, 80's style!",1140912000,2,1794,4.521604938271605

I've been watching this movie since I was a little boy and to this day I never get tired of it! Like someone else said... if this movie is on TV, there is NO WAY I'm not going to finish watching it. The whole thing just never gets old! Wow... for a movie made in 1988, it's still shown over and over again on cable television. That says something about how popular this movie is. It's by far the best Van Damme movie there is. And as a young impressionable boy, this movie is what got me interested in martial arts. I would stand in front of the TV watching this movie while trying to imitate all the moves I saw. Needless to say, I was the best fighter in first grade and performed many punches to kids' groins and spinning kicks to their faces while also breaking necks Chong Li style (ok im just kidding... but it does raise the issue of TV violence and its influence on children, doesn't it?) Anyways, good classic fight scenes that are also realistic (i.e. no wires, just man-to-man fighting). While in a real fight you would never perform the flying spin kicks nor would you take your sweet time walking up to your opponent and kicking him in the face as if he was too slow to react, the fight scenes are definitely entertaining and will put you into a hypnotic trance that will render you speechless and cause drool to drip out of your mouth (ok maybe not). Another thing I like about the movie is the movie soundtrack, i.e. the background music that's playing whenever there's a fight. Gets me pumped up and ready to go spin-kick someone at a gas station... then we start our own kumite in the back alley!

Sound is a 2 channel Dolby Digital, which isn't as surrounding as a 5.1 channel presentation. Yet speach is kept low enough to crank up the sound and furthermore enjoy environment sounds.

One of the most interesting things about this film, to me, is not Van Damme, or his American friend, or the girl he meets, but rather the vast array of interesting personalities that he fights. The worldwide survey of the practice techniques of the participants is very cool (wouldn't it be cool to learn how to slice a coconut with my bare hands?) and I found the African participants moves to be interesting, even if they were only showcased briefly.",1119657600,2,681,4.396825396825397

I have seen this movie at least 20 times. I'd easily call it Van Damme's best, and place it in my top ten of martial arts films.

It can be a little cheesy, especially the very beginning, but I think it redeems itself by doing an awesome job with two of the things martial arts film lovers love best: training sequences and fighting competitions. It shows a lot of different fighting styles. It has a strong message of honor throughout. It has lines that are hysterically funny, sometimes unintentionally. It has a very 80s soundtrack.

And let's not forget what really makes the film for me: Bolo Yeung, the BEAST from the east, plays Chong Li, Van Damme's nemesis. Bolo doesn't do a lot of talking, which is probably a good thing, but he doesn't need to say much to convey his power. His is an intimidating presence, one you won't quickly forget.

313343,4,6301163788,"When i first came to Australia some 15 years ago i watched this on tv and back then BloodSport was a kickass movie for western standard anyway... story is simple and straight forward a westerner gets trained by japanese master and enters a tournment to honor his dying master and wins becomes the champion!!!

The good:

Whats good about the film is the originality of fighters all around the world... i know enter the dragon did this first but its exploration is limited only a few fighters enter the tournament but here bloodsport has given more fighters eg, japanese sumo, african monkey style(which seem more chinese), thai kick boxing, brazilian street boxing, and judo, and chinese martial arts all pour into one ring.... what a mix!!! :)

I have reason to think the most popular arcade game ""STREET FIGHTER 2"" has had its influence from this film but i could be wrong...

The fighting scenes are good for the west this is as good as it gets and lots of blood helps! lucky van dan's basic kicking skill is very good and he's able to pull off all the moves easily and making it look very convincings good... other good bits are scenes of hong kong and its people, the guide for frank and his friend is great! he's line of "" we love asian people here cos we are GOOD looking!!"" is fantastic really is...

script is well written with lots of funny lines!!

story is ok good enough for a martial arts film... The acting is good though the younger frank seems a bit on the slow side but hey he's a nerdy kids so he can be dumb if he wants to...

The BAD:

there are many irregulars in the film what i mean is he's master looks japanese but the wife looks philippino. The chart of human anatomy on which his master teaches to frank is clearly in chinese and not some acient japanese anatomy chart. Frank's freind the wrestler seem to be a first timer at kumatai but he seem to have seen the korean champion chong li fought in the last kumatai... what's also bad i think is the typical sterotyping of asian and ethnic fighters in the movie. The middle-eastern fighter with a gold tooth, the black african fighter who taunts frank and chong li(korean champ) are all made out to be evil people and dishonourable fighters... this movie has that good old heroic amerian thing here which i do not like... its so typical of amerian films to make other people look bad and evil to glorify themselves and thats is totally wrong!!!

so its ok for frank's friend to smash other fighters face in and not ok for other fighters to hurt him? no no no... it isn't right. but again i understand this is an american film where amerian is the heroe...

The UGLY:

well after having watched the film i was interested to find out about the real FRANK DUX and his amazing records... so i did a bit of research online and to my surprise and utter atonishment it seem this film is a big fat FAKE!!!!!!!!! its claim for based on real life story just flys out the door... this real frank dux is a liar and he's very good at making up stories... he's records and involvment in kumatai is all a figment of his imagination, apparently he's trophies are brought from some maker not too far from his home.. and he has never left American or join in some fights and the whole thing is made up... yes he's record of winning 56 consecutive fight in one tournament is a total bull!!! think for yourself if he defeated 56 fighters just by himself how many fighters do you think is involved atleast 200 to 300 and the tournament went on for only 3 days???? hmmmmm and he's record knock out are totally unbelievable they must have measured him with a speedo gun when he knock out the other guy in 0.21 sec wow less than 1 sec !! must be a invisible punch... anyway i will stop bagging the real frank i guess the facts are never pretty... whats disappointing is the fact this film can actually get made claiming on real life but really total rubbish...

overall... just thinking and watching this movie on its own merits its a good film with many good moments ...

i will give this movie ***** 4 / 5 *****

Everytime I watch this totally radical, creative masterpiece, it gets me wetter than watching a flash-kick about to take out your pyscho-crusher.  My only problem, with this movie is, that the monkey-man gets defeated.  He is clearly the most well developed character besides the main actors, and i feel that he should have a spin-off movie called ""Monkey-Man and Ray Jackson versus the Amazin-Fruit Bears and their dark legion of Gooch-berzerkers.""

After 30 minutes of attempted plot development, ""Bloodsport"" really gets going with some of the finest one-on-one fights I have seen as the Kumite competition begins.  There are different fighters with all different types of styles, from brute strength, unorthodox defense methods such as hoping around like a kangaroo, and Van Damme's martial arts style.  The Kumite makes up most of the remaining 60 minutes of the movie and is riveting.
Van Damme can't act to save his life (and I get a kick - no pun intended - out of his American accent), but he puts on a good show here.  That's because he doesn't have much dialogue.  Bolo Yeung, who plays arch-nemesis Chong Li is ripped and very convincing as the villian.  Donald Gibb (Ogre from the ""Revenge of the Nerds"" movies) plays Van Damme's fellow Kumite participant who gets his clock cleaned by Chong Li, causing Van Damme an extra incentive for revenge.

In this movie, Van Damme plays Frank Dux, a military officer with super martial arts skills.  In his childhood, he learns karake from a Japanese master.  Now Dux has to enter a fighting competition called the Kumite to uphold the honor of his master.  That's basically the whole plot.  My favorite part is the flashback to Dux's childhood where he is played by a boy with the weakest sounding French accent.  It's a real must see.

I was 7 years old when it came out in theaters, and when I watch it today I get that nostalgic feeling that I love. The movie has a dash of everything: action, comedy, romance, and memorable one-liners...typical of 80's films.
The movie just oozes 80's. First of all, the music is AWESOME. Songs like ""Fight to Survive"" and ""On My Own Alone"" go down as true 80's classics.  I love the scene where Van Damme is playing Karate Champ...a game that has been extinct longer than the dinosaurs.
The scenery and backdrop of the movie is great. You really get that ""Hong Kong"" feeling when watching this movie, and I love the scenes filmed within the dark, narrow corridors. The fight scenes are decently choreographed, and some of the fighters are pretty cool, especially Paco, the dirty kickboxer. Of course he is nothing compared to Chong Li, the main villain. He beats heads AND flexes his pecs.

313426,3,6301163788,"While it may not have been a victory for the acting world, ""Bloodsport"" was more responsible than any other movie for launching the career of a certain high-kicking, strongly accented Belgian action hero.  ""Bloodsport"" tells the (kind of) true story of Frank Dux, a Franco-American army officer who goes AWOL in order to honor his Japanese master by fighting in a secret full-contact tournament called the Kumite.  Along the way, he gets busy with a leggy American reporter and befriends a hulking fellow competitor (played by Donald Gibb, best known as Ogre from the ""Revenge Of The Nerds"").  Of course, Van Damme movies are not known for their moral ambiguity, and this one is no exception.  The bad guy role in this particular film goes to Chong Li (played by the very imposing Bolo Yeung), who is, in the grand tradition of Van Damme movie villains, PURE AND UNMITIGATED EVIL.  He intentionally cripples (or kills) his opponents, taunts Van Damme after beating up his friend, and generally looks mean and scary.  You just know Van Damme and Chong Li are going to meet in the finals (isn't it just a major coincidence that they're on opposite sides of the bracket?), so suspense goes pretty much out the window right away.  However, things like plot and character devlopment aren't exactly requirements for a Van Damme movie anyway.  What ""Bloodsport"" does offer is frequent fight montages where hard-bodied martial artists do the kinds of things that look really freaking cool even if you can't completely follow what they're doing.  And of course, you get to watch Van Damme dispatch a variety of foes with impossibly fast and limber movements on his way to the championship.  And what else are Van Damme movies for?  Sure, the plot and acting are negligible, but ""Bloodsport"" stands as a milestone of the mindless action genre.

Also.. in the last fight sequence, am I the only one who noticed that the moves Van Damme does are very similar to the ones he uses in the last fight in the movie ""Kickboxer""?
Thats very poor by Van Damme. He did the fight choreagraphy in this movie as well didn't he?

The movie introduces us to Van Damme's  incredible martial arts ability. The story line is simple and unremarkable but effective.  Van Damme  participates in the Kumite against the wishes of the government which trained him.  The cast is certainly unremarkable, led by Bolo Yueng, first(?) seen in ""Enter the Dragon"",  playing Chong Li, the film's key villain and kumite champ.
What makes the film, though for martial artists (and fans) is the incredible range of fighting techniques seen through the film.  Some of them are great, some comical.

This movie was Van Damme's first starring role in which he portrays real life martial artist Frank Dux, an American who was the undefeated heavyweight champion of the kumite from 1975 to 1980 (don't quote me though).  The reason this movie was so great was that it showcased Jean-Claude's martial arts and gymnastic prowess rather than his sub-par acting ability.  The story was simple but effective:  a shady and brutal Martial Arts tournament is being held in Hong Kong and Dux (Van Damme) is going to participate to honor his shidoshi and surrogate father Senzou Tanaka.  Leah Ayres and Donald Gibb did an average job of playing Van Damme's cohorts.  But who really shines in this film is Bolo Yueng who did a great job in playing Chong Li, the film's key villain and kumite champ.

Whatever video source they used, they did a pretty good job on the transfer. There is some weathering of the film in the darker scenes, but I'm going to assume that's because the original film was shot on a lower budget than his later flicks. Cause, overall, the rest of the movie looks fine. This is pretty much a no nonsense dvd in that there's are really no extras. It's just the movie, chapter selection, and cast bios.

313493,3,6301163788,"BLOODSPORT may not have set the precedent for the tournament-centered martial arts film, but over the years it has proven to be the standard by which others of its ilk are judged.  Interestingly enough, this movie is loosely based on the achievements of real-life Frank Dux, who is something of a legend in winning the Kumite in Hong Kong.  Dux, played by Jean-Claude Van Damme, enters an underground mixed martial arts tournament and wins it despite cheating by his final round opponent, the fearsome Bolo Yeung, who is still remembered as John Saxon's losing opponent in ENTER THE DRAGON. The plot is not what sells the film to each new generation.  The key to overlooking the cliches which tumble from a poor script lies in the good looks and high-kicking ability of Van Damme.  As in many martial arts pictures, revenge is the driver for the protagonist.  Jackson, played externally as crudely yet as one who harbors a noble soul by Don Gibbs, is one of the contestants and is brutally beaten by the villanous Chong Li (Bolo).  Naturally, Dux gets to avenge his friend in the finals.  But the real charm lies in what precedes this climactic encounter.  There are numerous bouts which showcase the fighting talents of the actors.  Unfortunately for the realism of this movie, the growing popularity of mixed martial arts tournaments such as the Ultimate Fighting Championship has given the lie to the kinds of fighting made popular by this and similar fight movies.  When true martial artists fight in the Octagon, the result is rarely high-spinning reverse kicks or Kwai Chang Caine Tai Chi movements done fluidly amidst a bout. Most true fights wind up on the mat, usually ending in a choke or arm bar.  What BLOODSPORT succeeds in doing is giving the audience a wide range of both fighter physiques and fighter styles.  The preliminary fighters run the gamut from a monkey-like ground crawler to a mountainous hulk who gives Dux a hard time before succumbing.  One of the prelim fighters is actor Michel Quissi, who a few years later Van Damme resurrected to play Tong Po, the Thai villain of KICKBOXER. These battles are interesting and thrilling, and very nearly compensate for truly terrible scripting and amatuerish acting.  The final between Dux and Chong Li is memorable for the slow-motion kicks that earlier had been done by the far more literate David Carridine of television's KUNGU FU.  Bolo Yeung is the most watchable of Van Damme's opponents.  In fact, he reprises a similar role in other and later Van Damme actioners.  Bolo, as Chong Li, is a hugely muscular fighter with the traditional sneer and disregard for both life and rules.  Repeated viewings of this closing match indicate the high level of choreography that must have been required to avoid harm to the actors.  Despite cheating by Bolo, Van Damme wins, and as the closing credits flash, the audience learns that Frank Dux was a true fighter who retired as the undefeated heavyweight karate champion of the world.
  Movies like BLOODSPORT bear as much resemblance to mixed martial arts tournaments as military music does to music, but the real charm of their enduring appeal lies in the willingness of the audience to overlook the many flaws of a second rate production to focus on the beauty of the first rate fight scenes. Hollywood first learned that lesson decades ago, and as Stallone proved more times than I can count, that hopefully will never change.",1024099200,2,3442,4.869639794168096

The acting is mediocre. Almost everyone just puts on a walk-through performance. Not Van Damme (Frank Dux), though. He proves once again that for a guy who usually plays a stereotypical American.  In fact, he's quite laughable, to say the least. That forced Karate shrek's gotta go too. Surprisingly, Donald Gib(Jackson) and Bolo Yeung (Chong Li) stand ahead of the others, even though Yeung has maybe as little as 8 minutes of screen time.
Now for the plot. We have martial arts graduate Dux aiming to make his sensai (not ""shendoshi"", Van Damme) proud by a ancient, noble tournament, the Kumite. Of course, how the Kumite can be an ancient and noble tournament when it has an Asian mafia boss as one of the people running it is beyond me. There's also a break for romance that is really appalling.
But again, I enjoy this movie.  You'd probably have to hear him say that in this supposedly serious scene, but you get my point.
Also, there's a good side plot with these two government agents who are sent to capture Dux because he's a valued soldier and the
government has a professional concern for him getting hurt in the
Kumite.
Finally, there's fight scenes galore, which was more than likely what the consumer was expecting from this movie. Not the best fight scenes, but still entertaining despite some botched choreography here and there.
In short, ""Bloodsport"" is a terrible, terrible movie that I really like. And I'm not ashamed to admit it.",1011052800,,1515,4.734848484848484
313541,5,6301163788,"This is a Van Damme favourite, even though not my favourite VD film. True story about Frank Dux who goes to HK to fight in a Kumite, replacing the place of the Tanaka Clan. He's first trained. He goes to HK where he meets up with a reporter and finds a friend, Jackson. Frank and Jackson enter the kumite, a secret underground tournament. Kumite = Japanese word for fight. Lots of action scenes, a a true Martial Arts film. There is one thing I don't get. Why isn't this film on DVD????

313542,4,6301163788,"Bloodsport is the one movie from Van Damme's career that stands out.  Great fight scenes that'll have you at the edge of your seat, even if you're a pacifist.

The best aspect of Bloodsport is the music, bar none.  It's such a winner, that people at Ebay are willing to spend $50+ for the Bloodsport CD soundtrack.

Donald Gibb (Ray Jackson) was decent, Van Damme was slightly better, but Bolo Young (Chong Li) stole the show and his character really held the movie together.  That guy's fighting moves were flawless! The blonde reporter had some good moments (except for that argument she had with Dux at the hospital, which was bad) but those two G-men weren't all that believable.

Nevertheless, I bought a copy to watch the fight tournament, but I stayed for the soundtrack! A great 80s B-rated movie that I recommend for karate & action hero fans.",1005696000,,852,4.684563758389261
313543,4,6301163788,"Honestly this is the movie that jump started van damme's career.  The music with the fight scenes keeps the movie looking good with awesome fighters around the world.  What also made it real good was the fact that it was based on a true story and he fought for his friend and sensai, what more can I say, the movie is a must see for martial arts fans and one of van damme's best ever in his collection.  Don't miss out on this one!!",1004054400,,432,4.119047619047619
313544,1,6301163788,"This movie, like many Van Damme movies, is the touching tale of a dim-witted kickboxer who thinks he is a martial artist and often takes of his shirt, pours oil on himself, and jump kicks people while grunting loudly.
Actually, all Van Damme movies are like this, not just many.
The movie is about a martial arts tournament where people from around the world come to compete and try to win the prize, which is something I forgot. It is probably run by a super-evil vaguely Asian guy with mob connections. I haven't seen the movie in a while, but I know a super-evil Asian guy controls the tournament because EVERY martial arts tournament in movies is run by a super-evil Asian guy with mob connections, and Van Damme movies aren't known for being very original.
The movie features the really huge muscular guy from Enter The Dragon. I think his name is Bolo, but that could be his real name, his name in Enter the Dragon, or his name in Bloodsport. Anyway, immediately after someone smashes a brick in his presence, he says ""Very Good. But Bricks don't hit back."" (or something very similar), which is a quote from Enter the Dragon. I can see quite easily how this line made it's way into the movie.
WRITER #1: This movie is really bad.
WRITER #2: I know! Let's ... a bunch of stuff from a good martial arts movie to put in our bad martial arts movie! That should make it good, right?
If you want a good movie, watch something with Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee, or even Chuck Norris. Repeat to yourself ""Van Damme bad. Bruce Lee good."" Ok?",995500800,3,1533,4.459074733096085
313599,3,6301163788,"Bloodsport is about an American soldier who fights in a full-contact martial arts contest called the ""kumite.""  That's pretty much it.  There are distracting subplots, like the federal agents who are chasing after him to return him to the states (why is never explained.  It is mentioned that the government does not want him dsiabled. Does the army forbid officers to skydive or hunt for recreation?)  There is another subplot where an obligatory beautiful reporter/love interest tries to get into the kumite for a story.  The hero meets and befriends a buddy whom he must later avenge (aside formn being a cliche, its hard to see why they became friends as the buddy is a loudmouth jerk).  Then there is the old cliche about the hero trying to please his demanding master by busting heads (this subplot does little excpet highlight the writer's ignorance about Japanese martial philosophy).  If you can ignore/fast forward through the subplots, you have a collection of great fighitng scenes the provoke a great deal of macho enjoyment.",995241600,,1038,5.0

I was wincing whenever the hero got hurt, and pounding my hand with my fist whenever he laid down the hurt on the bad guys.  The final showdown at the end is the best fight scene ever.  All martial arts movies have a comeback scene at the end, but this movie's is the best.  Plus, this movie has the best soundtrack, too.  You've gotta hear the music in the final fight sequence.  Be SURE to see this movie.",984528000,,572,4.280373831775701
313606,5,6301163788,"I usually think of Van Damme as the prime example of a martial artists who puts minamal effort into his movies. Jean Claude Van Damme has the biggest muscles of any tv martial artist on tv that can still do the splits. no compromising.
In this movie he seems to know he can't act, he knows what the audience wants and he delivers in high doses. only in ""The Quest"" does he ever again offer so much quality or quantity. His unlimited potential shines in this old eighties movie. This was a great way to leave back the old days of poorly dubbed people hitting each other with what sounded like whips. I think this is a prime example of a martial arts flick because thats all it tries to be.
After this movie Van Damme raised his goals and thus drops his standard. So don't judge this movie off any of his other titles. This movie is one of a kind.",982368000,,845,4.222222222222222

As someone said on a previous comment, my friends and I, too, have seen it so many times that we've memorized basically every line. Hell, I took a break from writing my college thesis last night and watched it. Bloodsport to us is a cult classic, and unfortunately none of Van Damme's later efforts is as good.",981504000,,514,4.65934065934066

313651,5,6301163788,This is most likely the best martial arts movie set in tournment style ever achieved in the history of cinema. From the musical score to the dramatic movements of the characters this movie really does set itself in a realm beyond all others.,978393600,,241,4.627906976744186
313652,3,6301163788,"All right, I admit it.  This is a pretty useless film as far as film buffs go.  But place yourself back in grade 7 when we first saw this film and you'll realize exactly what we liked about it.
It had to have been the well-choreographed (for a low-budget flick), well-glossed production of what's basically a b-level action film, but even then you couldn't deny Jean-Claude Van Damme had a certain charisma to him.  And I couldn't tell you how many times we re-enacted the fights in our backyard.
Obviously enough people agreed at the time, because it wasn't long before he started making bigger-budgeted movies like Hard Target and Timecop; but this is where he struck paydirt first.  It has my favourite old school villain Yeung Tze (Bolo Yeung--underused in this film, with regard to technical ability), some unbelieveably bad acting all around, and a superb score by Mark DiSalle, who's early-techno beats really help make the fight scenes work.
Years later, we all know this film has aged badly, even when you throw it to the designation of 'camp-classic.'  But where Van Damme films are concerned (especially his later films), you could do much, much worse.",976060800,,1163,4.853535353535354
313653,4,6301163788,"Okay, let's get something straight right off the bat: the acting in this movie is pretty much appalling, the story is non-existent, and the fight scenes aren't even that well designed (they are very slow, all technique and no realistic moves).  But this movie is a pure rush, and is loads of fun. Frank Dux, as many know, is a real person.  He holds several strong titles, and was the founder of his own personal blend of ninjitsu and karate-do.  Van Damme is not Dux.  Van Damme is not a fighter.  But if you can look at this without thinking about the real events it is based on, then you will enjoy this film.  JCVD does a great job looking like the dedicated student, with some impressive splits, kicks, leaps, and muscle build (as usual).  Like the also great 'Kickboxer', this is a fantastic workout film.  If you are a practitioner of the martial arts, just pop this baby in, stretch, train, and enjoy yourself.  This is truly that kind of film.  It is just a pure slam-bang action film.  nothing more, nothing less.  Great fun",972950400,,1034,4.5
313654,5,6301163788,"Although the martial arts scenes are spectacular, this movie is really about what a man learned from his martial arts training.  It's the true story of a man who, at a critical juncture in time (when most people would have given up in despair), looked within and found the necessary strength of spirit to face a deadly adversary.  It's really a story about the power of integrity and character. Well worth watching many times over!",972432000,,431,4.733333333333333
313655,5,6301163788,A very exciting movie. It is action packed from start to finish. This movie is based on a competitive tournament held in the Orient. Van Damme decides to compete. It is certainly competitive in the tournament. Van  Damme makes it to the finals against the reigning champion. The champion is  the ultimate in a villain. He kills one of the competitors during the  competition. Van Damme battles the champion very skillfully. The champion  blinds the American challenger with a white powder. Van Damme calls upon  his training to overcome this act of cheating. Van Damme finally wins the  competition becoming the first American to do so. This was really a movie  that you could get into.

313656,1,6301163788,"I have quite a few van Damme films and this is by far the worst. Even though the story is based on real-life, it is predictable right from the start. There is nothing new in the action which comprises most of the film  and some of the sequences have been badly shot - e.g. one backwards  roundhouse kick clearly misses by a good inch, the victim's reaction is  clearly delayed by a fraction of a second and, despite the obvious miss,  the blood still flows. The Federal agents on van Damme's trail are pathetic  and the female reporter, who looks as out of place as a bucket of manure at  a wedding, is not believable and the FBI/press part of the story is boring  in the extreme. I have seen van Damme confront his final opponent in  'Double Impact' (also played in Hong Kong!) and that was a much, much  better example of the skills involved and there was at least some  credibility in the story. I admit that van Damme's physical prowess is hard  to follow, but he should not have downgraded himself by performing in this  film.",964224000,,1031,4.396825396825397

However,  Bloodsport is just, well, fun.  It has this sort of quirky charm that can  only come from the 1980s; right down to the synthpop soundtrack and Ray  Jackson's torn blue jeans.
I grew up with movies like this,  so it's  really nostalgic. I guess that doesn't count in a review, though.  But, the  choreography isn't half bad!
Some impressive fight scenes, cheesy  (albeit true) dialogue, and the charm of the '80s make this an enjoyable  movie; and I don't care what anyone says!",963705600,,688,4.603305785123967

The final fight scene, in which he does the  flying split kick, may not be technically accurate (yes his groin is wide  open), but it knocks my socks off!  As a matter of fact, I didn't even  realize that there was a Bloodsport 2 until I ordered it here on Amazon,  and am panting with eagerness to see it.  Now if we could just see more  like this, Lionheart and Kickboxer, I'd love it!  (More of Van Damme's  strengths and less acting and gratuitous violence.)",952732800,,704,4.4140625
