This is a movie I have never heard about. And NO, it is not good.",1505433600,,255,4.12
8130861,1,B0002OXUUG,"This DVD is a cheap release of an irredeemably horrible movie.  If you're anything like me, you're a fan of some movies that are so bad they're good, like The Room or anything by Godfrey Ho.  This movie is so bad its bad.  It's boring.  It makes no sense.  Save yourself a few precious hours of your life and pass it by.",1358899200,,320,4.096774193548387
8130862,3,B0002OXUUG,"Joe(Ross Kettle), an ex-CIA operative is forced out of retirement to rescue his loving wife, a beautiful scientist who's the sole survivor of an ambush by a ruthless tycoon and his band of ninja warriors in the jungles of Africa.

Sounds like a decent plot right? Wrong, this movie continues to hurt the NINJA saga as to make the movie a joke. First off the hero of the story isn't even a ninja. He is just an ex government agent using machine guns and rocket launchers. Second, how many ninja warriors do you know in the jungles of Africa?

The story centers around a plant who's waste is poisoning the drinking waters deep in the jungle. A group of environmentalist scientists are studying the local waters only to find the deadly toxens in the water supply. Out of the blue a band of ninja warriors slaughters everyone at the camp except Joe's wife (Kimberleigh Stark) only to kidnap her setting off Joe on a mission to rescue his wife and dismantle the plant facility in the process.

Sadly that was the interesting part of the whole movie. It drags on from there and becomes more rediculous as the movie progresses. Poor scripting and bad acting ruined a potentially decent film.

I gave it 3 stars because it was a later film, so good sound and video quality with ninja in uniform instead of the usual kung fu movie with the word ""ninja"" in it to sell the video.

2 words to sum up this movie....
