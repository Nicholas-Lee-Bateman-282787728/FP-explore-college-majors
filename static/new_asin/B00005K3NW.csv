1613534,5,B00005K3NW,"This review is for the Collector's Edition of 'The Howling' released by StudioCanal.

I'm not going to go into the details of the plot on this one. It's very well known and if you are looking to buy this you have probably seen it and if not there are plenty of other reviews.

I'm giving this 5 stars simply because the extra's are superb. They by themselves make this a 5 star release. Anything you can possibly want to know about this movie is included. There are commentaries, documentaries, deleted scenes and outtakes, trailers and photo galleries. Also included is one of my favorite types of extra's. This is a look at the locations used the way the looked then and today. Very few releases do this sort of thing and it is always very interesting.

I hadn't watched this movie since it came out in the early 80's. At the time, I thought the transformation scenes were better than 'An American Werewolf in London.' Today I think differently but the transformation was still pretty spectacular when you factor in that no CGI was used.

Anyway, if you are a fan of this movie then you will want this release.",1514937600,,1112,4.545

I would definitely recommend this release to any fan of the horror genre.

Product review:
The Shout Factory Blu Ray looks and sounds fantastic. This release is packed full of great special features. I'd recommend the 50 minute feature, The Making of The Howling.",1506211200,,514,4.576086956521739

1613623,5,B00005K3NW,"Pretty near complete in its Blu-Ray packaging, this re-issue of Joe Dante's 1981 gem THE HOWLING features a nice transfer of the original film negative and a whopping horde of extras that will have fans giving their howls of thanks every time there's a full moon. THE HOWLING is a creepy film, but there's practically as much comedy and cinema buff in-jokes as there are moments of fright, but Rob Bottin's transformation effects in this picture are just about unequaled in terms of their quality (what baffles me is that 1981 had three great werewolf pictures in cinemas, and today there are none to speak of; oh well, the good old days). I imagine that the Eddie Quist transformation scene was pretty shocking for viewers in 1981, and really the effects work here remains pretty imaginative today. While scary in concept, THE HOWLING is constantly messing with your head, throwing in a parade of jokes and quasi-humorous references to other movies, and even featuring cameos (Roger Corman, Mick Garris, co-writer John Sayles, and Dick Miller spring to mind) that make you go ""Oh!"" in the middle of the picture. Of course, there is the sexy and visually arresting Elisabeth Brooks to capture your eyes here, as well as some interesting werewolf characters (like Slim Pickens!) to make you gasp every now and then. While a fun movie, THE HOWLING lacks a great deal of action that might have made it even more intense, but what survived the cutting room floor is pretty good. While the movie has become a staple of the genre for horror fans, its real contributions have to do with the effects on display and the unusual concepts found in the movie itself, and how Dante cleverly reworks the genre for a new (and more tolerant) generation. While I personally didn't find the picture all that offensive (there is a high-concept werewolf sex scene that is fairly explicit but not overly shocking, and apparently this is the one scene that author Gary Brandner enjoyed from the movie), there are moments that will definitely make fans of the original 1941 WOLF MAN wince. But compared to other werewolf-themed films, this one goes a long way towards redeeming itself by not taking its efforts too seriously, and by providing some pretty freaky moments overall. And the ending is, well, a scorcher!
While some of the extra content included on Scream Factory's new release can be found elsewhere, the company has yet again gone above and beyond the call of duty in presenting us fans with some really nice extra content. Chief amongst these new offerings is an exemplary interview with effects creator David W. Allen (I want one of those werewolf figurines!) in which he explains why his work for Dante was not used in the movie (with the exception of about two seconds worth of footage that comes near the end) and how he went about designing his own werewolf creatures under contract for the picture (best of all is the cut footage in which we get a glimpse of Allen's unused work). But the extra that caused me to spring for this new release was the audio commentary with author Gary Brandner, moderated by DVD producer and filmmaker Michael Felscher. While the old 2-disc DVD set put out under the MGM banner had some strong extra materials, it did not include any information about the source novel (other than the producers saying that they had decided to throw the back out and start over with a fresh script!) and this was a dramatic oversight in my opinion. While it is true that books belong to a completely different world than that of the movies, the story's source is important for understanding where the initial ideas themselves hail from. And the commentary track on this Blu-Ray is a whopper of an item if you ask me. The only thing that could have improved it would have been a video interview with Brandner, but the audio itself is great--probably even people who may not care about the writing of books (or movies) will find it an enjoyable listen. Brander is fairly open when talking to Felscher (he claims that he was on a ""skyrocket to mediocrity"" after the original Holwing novel was published, hilarious) and he offers some insights about what it is like to work for the ""Hollywood people"" and to have his novels translated onto film. He also mentions that his novel ""had a better story"" than the Landis-concocted mesh that was used as the basis for AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON, and I agree with him on this point. Brandner's source material does in fact make the picture a bit stronger than it would have been without a more solid story to build its script upon. Brandner's own opinion about director Joe Dante is not so flattering, but he does say that the man made a good movie and it did undoubtedly put Brandner on the map (so to speak) as well. I have not read the original Brandner novel yet, but it is clear from the get-go that Dante's movie is less an adaptation than a completely original take on the werewolf mythos. This extra is, in my opinion, a collector's item. I also have to mention that the making-of documentary material here is equally great, explaining the complete making of the original picture and even covering (briefly) the making of the many sequels that are still going on to this very day. I also would be remiss if I do not offer my opinion that Dee Wallace Stone was magnificent in this movie, paving the way for herself as a future scream queen in horror cinema (following up this performance with another strong turn in Lewis Teague's CUJO). But overall I also have to say that the entire cast seemed to be having a good time with this movie, and viewers in turn will also have a good time watching them.
Scream Factory's presentation of THE HOWLING on Blu-Ray should become a standard-setter for future releases. The original artwork and the newly commissioned artwork included in this package is fantastic, and the wealth of extras doesn't hurt either. The TLC given to the picture and sound transfer is also quite nice. If you want to know why a lot of us love the work that Scream Factory is doing, simply pick up a copy of this release. It pretty much speaks for itself. A+ (for the whole package)",1487721600,,6158,4.681734317343174

1613677,4,B00005K3NW,"I always heard of this movie but never got around to checking it out.  In Australia it appeared in the budget section of a major retailer, amongst mostly unknown other titles, so for just a few dollars I thought I might as well check it out. For a budget DVD (we're talking about region 4) I was suprised to find this one comes with a lot of special features, there's, deleted scenes, the teaser, the trailer, (oddly the original porn video from that scene), and an around 45 minute 2003 interview with Joe Dante, and lots of the cast and crew called Welcome to Werewolf Land.  I actually found that quite interesting, obviously they talk about making the film, in it you learn it didn't have much of a budget and initially didn't have any werewolves in it, just a guy in a bear suit apparently and they showed the film as it was to the investors and said how much better it would be with werewolves in it.  Belinda Balaski tells us you can tell what was filmed first and later by the fact her hair changes length. They talk about the sequels which they weren't involved in since the book author this was based on didn't like them much since they didn't follow his book.  They of course say they were terrible (haven't seen them but the ratings here on Amazon don't tend to agree with them).  I found the documentary quite interesting, as you learnt a lot about 80's horror and how different film making now (well 2003) was to then.  Oddly apparently when this was promoted with the same cover of woman screaming behind slashes that's on this version's DVD, as the movie poster and in the trailers, the audience were surprised when it was a werewolf film.  I find that a bit hard to believe with the title but apparently that was the case.

The film itself I thought had both some really good special effects, such as the transformation of a guy into a werewolf around the hour and seven minute mark, but also some pretty average ones as well, such as what the actor who wore it refers to in the documentary as acid face, which just looked like a cheap mask, even though it apparently wasn't.  At times you also wonder who the target market was, there's a rape scene as a porno movie playing in a scene, you also see full frontal nudity for a sex scene, yet at other times the final werewolf we see looks like something out of the cartoon Hotel Transylvania.  The acting especially by the non main characters is a bit average at times, but overall it's a decent movie.",1479254400,,2468,4.416299559471366
1613678,4,B00005K3NW,"Released just before the critically-acclaimed ""American Werewolf in London"", Saturn-awarded ""The Howling"" is a unique mess in the lycanthrope genre. With a satirical approach loosely based on the Gary Brandner novel, Joe Dante's film is a cult classic that delivers style and even a small bit of substance but it doesn't all happen without a few problems along the way. ""The Howling"" should at the very least be on any werewolf fan's watch list.",1479081600,,445,5.027027027027027

Then all of the sudden years later I got a huge itch to buy Shouts! blu ray that I couldn't scratch and I'm glad I did. It's one of those movies I must've misunderstood the first time because I thought it was really good the second time. Not perfect like An American werewolf in London or Stephen King's Silver Bullet but its pretty solid. Great practical effects, some effective scares, terrific cinematography, lighting and great old school Joe Dante style direction. There are a good amount of great misty nighttime woods scenes that are terrifically atmospheric. It's a great October horror movie addition and Shouts! blu ray is great.

Yes horror fans it's still frightening 35 years later this is the film that made Dee Wallace a star she starred in ET the following year and got Cujo in 83. It also features the great man into werewolf transformation seen onscreen until American Werewolf changed things in 82 and won the first Oscar for makeup. Wallace plays a news reporter traumatized by an encounter with a man named Eddie who isn't what h appears. unable to report her story on the new the following night after her encounter with Eddie she's sent to a colony to get some therapy from a well known psychiatrist who's colony turns out has residents that are werewolves.

1613794,5,B00005K3NW,"This is a nice upgrade from the dvd.  The picture is better and there's lots of extras.  The movie is a horror classic that did very well at the theaters in 1981.  they raked in the cash but the sequels never were even close to this one.  Although part 2 is wild and ok but more cheesy fun. This is more serious and it has top rated actors in it. Like dee Wallace and others and it was directed by Joe Dante. It also has Elizabeth Brooks best known role.  She went on to star in many b movies.  But she died  young at age 47 of brain cancer. (1997).  She is the main sexy baddy in this one.  this is a good film that  has a good plot and it isn't a action fest. A woman goes to a colony to get better after a ptsd causing incident.  she instead finds a group of werewolves who want her to join them.  MOVIES , don't have to have action all the time to be good. I saw some complain about that.  This movie is not a action film.  So move on!. It's a good film.  And worth belonging in any horror films collection.",1463875200,,1011,3.9113300492610836

I don't know about anyone else, but I like to see a werewolf monster in horror movies rather than just a giant wolf like in the Twilight movies and some others. Honestly, I think those are kind of stupid. This movie did have at least one nude scene that I think was cut in the theatrical release so be warned. It was totally unnecessary and could be embarrassing depending on who you happen to be watching it with. I watched it with my older sister who also loves horror flicks, and yes, I was embarrassed.

1613981,3,B00005K3NW,"Either I hadn't seen this in full back in the 80s, whereas the Wolfen and American Werewolf in London I know
very well indeed, but, having finally sat down tonight to screen the new special edition of The Howling, now I realize
I didn't miss anything really spectacular.  The Howling is a fun film but by no means the masterpiece of horror
that everybody seems to think it is. It IS definitely somewhat (or even, a good deal) dated and the FX of course as well, although
mainly they are still pretty good but this is a movie from 1981 and all. For horror fanatics like myself it's also
fun to see the in-jokes, references (not sure how much of this is from Gary Brandner's novel) and cameos by
Roger Corman and Forrest Ackerman from Famous Monsters (in the occult bookstore scene), but for me this movie
is just let down as a fright-fest by just an overkill of humor and goof-off stuff.  John Sayles' walk-on as an
M.E. with a missing dead serial killer in the vaults is also funny, but all of this doesn't add up to much.

There's such a thing as too much comic relief and sadly, The Howling suffers enormously from this, in retrospect.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed
The Howling and I am a long-time Joe Dante fan, I just couldn't be scared by this now compared to 1981,
that's for sure, and much of this just seemed sophomoric since I'm now longer in the tooth, as it were.
The ending, which should be truly horrifying, ends up falling utterly flat, due to the silly jokey ending
in the bar and such. How do you like your burger lady? ""Raw.""  Oh boy.  I personally still think that
A. American Werewolf in London still fares and holds up better to this day due to the genuine scares in it, amidst
the laughs and B. the mainly superior effects in that film.  A lot of the acting in The Howling is just genuinely
awful, too.  Dee Wallace is great, Patrick Macnee is great, as always, otherwise it's a mixed bag.

My final summation is that this film is good fun but if you're expecting a horror masterpiece with true gravitas, like ALIEN or The Shining, you're not gonna find it here. Gotta find a balance between horror and humor and The Howling's scales just tip a bit too much to the latter side to make
this a truly classic fright movie, but it's an entertaining popcorn horror movie and it holds up better, for the most part,
than most of the horror films of that time.  I haven't seen The Wolfen in many years, and I don't recall being super-impressed
even at the time with THAT (Strieber's novel is still pretty good although The Hunger is a better work, overall), so I wonder how well that film would hold up now, as well.  I'm not sure I'm sufficiently enough of a werewolf fan to even bother finding out, to be honest. Probably better off watching an old Christopher Lee Hammer film, which is what's next in the queue for me.  Glad I revisited The Howling but I just can't declare it a total masterpiece, as much as I'd have liked to. A lot of this was coming off to me as not much more than an ""amped-up"" TV movie and that's not good, even given the time period in which it was produced.  Then again, I never thought Gremlins was an utter masterpiece, either,
as enjoyable as it was.

Still, I'd rather watch any of these films over most of the ""slasher"" films of the 80s which I never liked
AT ALL. I also hate The Evil Dead which I thought was nearly unwatchable a few years ago, having caught up with that,
and I'm talking about the original one, not the remake which I've not seen and don't plan to.  Too many people declare
films ""masterpieces"" that don't deserve the designation.  The Howling: fun horror movie, and funny? Yes. Masterpiece of all time: nah.
If you want one, go watch the original Nosferatu and you'll see an original horror masterpiece.  Even John Carpenter's remake
of The Thing is, I believe, BY FAR as close to an actual Horror/SF classic the genre had produced in the 1980s, and much
closer to a true masterpiece that truly does not seem dated, than The Howling.  I had a good time watching this, but none
of it was terribly memorable and it didn't move me much either way.  The laughs were more memorable than the scares
so, for me, that's not really a good sign.",1434758400,,4203,4.386100386100386

1614172,5,B00005K3NW,"Joe Dante's The Howling is considered by horror fans to be one of the three movies that constitute the canon of werewolf films, explores the notion that the media generates mediated content targeted at a commodity audiences and, in so doing, conditions them into accepting graphic violence and gratuitous sex in mediated texts as acceptable forms of mediated content which in turn molds them into audiences who expect these forms of mediated texts as the norm, insidiously depriving them of freedom of choice for better mediated texts, and incorporates what is considered to be ground breaking special effects by special effects legend, Rob Bottin, in what is today considered a cult classic.

However, the main subtext of the movie revolves around the theme of a psychiatrist who, himself being infected with lycantrophia, encourages others infected with the disease to suppress their hunger for human flesh and blend in with the community for the sake of their survival while encouraging them not to suppress what he considers to be natural human sexual desires which he believes constitutes a normal part of the libido, until the heroine, played by Dee Wallace Stone (the lead character who plays the part of mom in Steven Spielberg's classic E.T.), is infected with the disease and attempts to demonstrate to the rest of the world that the unrestrained indulgence of sexual cravings subtly deprives decent human beings of a well principled life based of morals by transforming into a werewolf before a live television newscast.

1614174,4,B00005K3NW,"The Howling had the misfortune of being completely overshadowed by An American Werewolf in London, which was released later in the same year, and so to this date it is largely forgotten except by rabid fans of the genre.  What those fans will probably tell you is that, as a whole, this film is actually better than the Oscar winning film.  Sure, An American Werewolf in London has its moments (and that subway scene is brilliant) and yet it has a rather lazy ending and takes quite a while to heat up (this one starts from the getgo and keeps it coming).

So, as a horror film, The Howling is far scarier.

The film tells the story of a newswoman who is mentally scarred from an encounter with a stalker.  This event causes her to take retreat, upon her doctors suggestion, at a mountain resort he runs.  Upon reaching the resort, Karen and her husband are turned off by the obvious bizarreness of it all, but soon things turn ugly (and scary) and the obvious bizarreness of it all melts away into the realization that the residents are werewolves hiding away from mankind.  When the fangs come out and the claws start scratching, Karen seeks out help from home only to drag in more victims and raise the bloody body count.

There are obvious detractors here.  The actual morph scene is WAY TOO LONG.  The one in An American Werewolf in London is far more effective because it is more abrupt and doesnt last ten minutes (exaggeration, but close to serious).  The barn scene is kind of stupid.  To think that two humans could force a mob of angry werewolves into a barn, lock the door and set it on fire unscathed it preposterous.  If the film had ended there I would have taken a few marks down, but what happens next is brilliant.  That final newscast is an epic ending and singlehandedly steals the thunder from An American Werewolf in London.

The wolves here look a little more like mutant bunnies, but I kind of like that look, and the moonlight werewolf love scene is awesome.

At the end of the day, this may be largely considered the inferior one, but it is far more to the point, far scarier and far more inventive.

But yes, An American Werewolf in London has better makeup and special effects.",1383609600,,2205,4.5

It has some really scary scenes, including the best transformation scene; done without any CG or camera tricks.  It is worth listening to the additional commentary on the making of the movie.",1381104000,,573,4.767676767676767
1614209,5,B00005K3NW,"An intelligent, raw, and powerfully driven werewolf flick that has been modernized from Chaney's old tale with some adaptions on the old myth and legends concerning lycanthropy. These werewolves are slightly different than the norm, and with the combined blue-lighting and direction of the film (dark, heavy, forboding), we have a winner in the eyes of the fans of the furry.

 News anchorwoman Karen White, after helping the police track down the dangerous serial killer Eddie Quist, retreats to the Colony, a resort to help her cope with her fears and recent trauma. The Colony, set in Drago, has a few surprises of its own, and Karen won't be recovering anytime soon. She is now in much more dangerous territory than she ever imagined.

 The beginning is one of my favorites and there is no better way to start a movie such as this. A wierd radio type shot with bits of dialogue and incidents that come from later on in the film loan an almost mystical feel. The action starts right from the start with Karen going through the routines of meeting Eddie for an ambush. Meeting him in a small, run-down porn shop furthers the sick, dirty, and rather helpless mood of Karen. The pacing then slows down a bit while Dante takes the opportunity for introduction. We get a better impression of the cast and are welcomed into the plot of the colony; there we see a slow unraveling of events, where we're not sure exactly what's going on until an excellent ending shows itself and wraps up the whole banquet.

  The werewolves aren't shown right away; we get some POV shots and guesses; as in, is the werewolf out in the woods right now or is he not? Is there more than one, and is something going to happen right this second? Any chase scenes involving the werewolf hold plenty of tension and drama, particularly with Terri. This movie is not known for outright violence, so don't go in hunting for that.

 Werewolf myths and tributes are all over the place. Scenes from the 1941 Wolfman plays on TV, a werewolf cartoon, myths and folklores of the wolf, old bookstores concerning lycanthropy, ect. Also the werewolves in this movie are a little different than other films. They don't consider it a curse to be what they are and can change anytime they wish, whether it be day, night, or anywhere near a full moon.

 Dee Wallace Stone, one of my favorite horror actresses, excels in her role as Karen White, the news reporter on the brink of a breakdown. John Carradine makes one of his final film appearances here as the Doc and really comes through. Her husband is a semi-stiff actor, and some of the other characters could be approved on but thankfully they do not detract from the movie. Christopher was played by director Dennis Dugan (Big Daddy, Saving Silverman).

 The director was from the big talent of Joe Dante, who went on to create Gremlins and the B-movie Piranha. The movie was loaded with creative lighting, sometimes dim with plenty of fog for the night scenes, and other times a slight sharp contract to help things come through. An almost grainy feel during some of the scenes, and others are more modern/mainstream. The casting, although some were less than superior in acting, were all perfect nonetheless.

 People have commented on the soft humor in this film but I just don't see it. Any humor comes from some of the cast members as a type of cruel joke. Maybe it's one of those deals you only get depending on your own perception, I don't know.

 There have been a lot of different opinions circulating regarding the ""colony"". If you have any good suggestions on the purpose of Eddie venturing out and the colony itself, let me know. I'd love to hear it as I'm trying to form my own theories myself.

 Awesome effects from Rob Bottin that almost equal an American Werewolf In London, which came out the same year. The werewolf transformation scene when it does happen (you know, the ONE) was eye-popping although carried out a bit too long. We get it, he's changing! Certainly a year for the werewolves.

 The forest scenery rocks! I love the old ""cabin in the woods"" bit. Very effective direction and visuals help enhance this film to be a classic collectable for the horror fan.",1379635200,,4200,4.656292286874154

1614213,5,B00005K3NW,"They should separate the blu ray reviews from the standard DVD and VHS reviews. They mix them all together, which makes sorting through them more difficult for the consumer to see accurate item-specific product reviews. Anyway, Shout Factory really knows what they're doing with these blu ray releases. They've been releasing a lot of the ""underdog"" catalog horror and sci-fi titles from the 70s, 80s and 90s that the major studios have no interest in upgrading to high-def on their own. The A/V presentation on these films so far is very good and for the most part, is MUCH better than their DVD counterparts, considering a lot of these films were shot in a ""soft"" focus on very limited budgets.

I know they are a new company, and I looked for contact information for them to make some suggestions on some other seemingly forgotten titles. So Shout/Scream Factory if you happen to be perusing these reviews, how about considering releasing these forgotten gems: Lets Scare Jessica to Death (1971), Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things (1972), Don't Be Afraid of the Dark (1973), The Reincarnation Of Peter Proud (1975), Burnt Offerings (1976), The Haunting Of Julia [A.K.A. Full Circle] (1981), Fright Night Part II (1988) and Earth Girls Are Easy (1989)?

BTW, Most of their titles have the original theatrical poster art on the reverse side of their new animated style ""pulp"" art. So, flip them over! Film enthusiasts/genre collectors can definitely appreciate this.

1614215,5,B00005K3NW,"The Howling is a true horror classic and ranks among one of the best werewolf movies ever made. Joe Dante, fresh off of Roger Corman's ""Piranha"", re-teams with writer John Sayles for a fun and spooky tale of lycanthrope loose in the California hills that was based on a book by Gary Brandner. After a traumatic close call with a strangely animalistic serial killer named Eddie Quist (Robert Picardo), a young newswoman, Karen (Dee Wallace) is sent to a holistic retreat by her therapist, Dr. Waggner (Patrick Macnee) for treatment. But unknown to Karen and her husband, Bill (Christopher Stone) The Colony is actually a haven for werewolves that the therapist is trying to civilize... and that a certain, Eddie Quist was one of his 'patients'. But, some of the pack have other ideas and are looking at Karen as their next meal. Dante brings a very Roger Corman feel to the proceedings and gives the legendary producer a cameo as well. The film has some fun moments but, also some legitimate scares, too and Dante mixes fear and fun very well with one never overshadowing the other. Makeup FX master Rob Bottin provides the creature and gore FX and beat American Werewolf In London by a few months with the first on-camera werewolf transformation and it still impresses after all these years and got him the job on John Carpenter's The Thing. A great cast, including legends Slim Pickens, John Carradine and Dick Miller, that knows when to play it straight and when to camp it up, adds to the mix and makes this a very entertaining Halloween treat and a bonfire horror classic. Countless sequels followed that all sucked but, this one still holds up and is one of my personal viewing choices for the Halloween season. Also stars the smoking hot Elizabeth Brooks as sexy nymphomaniac werewolf, Marsha.

1614217,4,B00005K3NW,"From the opening sequence to the climatic finale, Joe Dante's ""The Howling"" is a horror movie classic - not just from the 1980's or in the werewolf movie category, but of all-time. As 80's horror movies go, it's easily a top 10 entry, and as far as werewolf movies go, it's second only behind the original ""The Wolf Man"" in my opinion. Joe Dante's unique blend of expert storytelling, humor, and flat-out scares presents us with a very solid effort. It is much more engaging and scary than ""An American Werewolf in London"", which it is often compared to, and I would even venture to say that I liked the on screen werewolf transformation put together by Rob Bottin on ""The Howling"" better than the Rick Baker effort for ""An American Werewolf in London"". There just something gritty and real about ""The Howling"", which makes it all the more fun to watch.

The acting is at times fair and at other times superb. Although I found Dee Wallace's portrayal as the tragic heroine of the film, Karen White, a bit melodramatic and at times weak, I found the main strength of this cast to be in the very strong supporting group - Robert Picardo (as Eddie Quist), John Carradine, Slim Pickens, Patrick Macnee, Dick Miller, Kevin McCarthy, Dennis Dugan, and Elisabeth Brooks all turn in great performances, and Belinda Balaski steals the show as Karens ill-fated friend, co-worker, and confidant, whose investigative efforts, and ultimately, her attempts to save her friend Karen, lead to her own untimely demise.

The production value of this movie is top shelf. From the great score by Pino Donaggio, and the beautiful cinematography by Jim Hora, the movie is a joy to watch. Simply put - ""The Howling"" is a definite must own for any horror fan. I have not seen the new Scream Factory Blu-Ray release yet, but I will update my review once I have.

UPDATE - I recently purchased Shout! Factory's ""The Howling"" Collectors Edition Blu Ray. First off, the new slip cover art is FANTASTIC, as usual, and is what we have come to expect from these new Blu Ray/DVD releases from Shout! Factory. The film transfer looks great and the movie truly has never looked better. The sound mix is also nice and really enhances the creepy atmosphere of the film, especially in the finale. My only big gruff with the release is that the special features are not up to the standards that I've personally come to expect from Shout! 95% of what is found on this release was carted over from the previously released (and still a worthwhile purchase) ""The Howling"" 2 disc special edition DVD set. What should have been a bright spot for the Shout! release is that there is a ""Horrors Hallowed Grounds"" episode hosted by Sean Clark which is one of my favorite features of these new Shout! releases. Unfotunately, it is by far the shortest and least intresting of the group that I've seen. Overall, this is a great Blu Ray to purchase if you love this movie and want to see it look as good as it ever will, otherwise, the cheaper 2 disc special edition DVD set will suffice.",1374537600,,3037,4.641263940520446

1614262,5,B00005K3NW,"One of Joe Dante's best films has now been released on Blu-ray by scream factory
that is part of shout factory
any fan of the film knows what the plot is and what the film is about
which is Werewolves, Joe Dante's 2nd film i think and it's made with so much rawness it's old school film making
cause of it's realism which i prefer compared to today's way which is mainly CGI film making
and cheasy acting in my opinion
CGI (Computer generated images), basically some scenes that require monster special effects
that get done with CGI which to me is cheating and looks fake compared to old fashioned special effects
but that debate can go on forever, everyone has opinions.

so this review is about the new scream factory release and how it's different from the old MGM DVD release

this new Collectors edition by scream factory as it all
all the special features/extras from the original MGM DVD release has been brought over to this
new collectors edition blu-ray, even the Unleashing the beast making of Doco has been brought over
so all the interviews are from 2002-2003 MGM DVD release
the Deleted scenes, outtakes have been brought over
and the Audio commentary by Joe Dante and actors have been brought over aswell from the 2003 release
except for 3 brand new interviews done in the past 12months
interview with Exect producer Steven Lane who talks about his involvement in THE HOWLING
and also talks about the sequels actually, he was exect producer for all 4 sequels i think
which is very interesting interview goes for 15mins
interview with Mark Goldblatt who was the Editor on the Howling
and an interview with one of the writers of the film, the screenplay had 2 writers

the new Blu-ray transfer is excellent picture and audio quality 10/10
any blu-ray release that comes out these days is widescreen so of course it's widescreen
better than the MGM release from 2003
As i said all the special features from the 2003 MGM release
has been carried over to this scream factory collectors edition
plus you get 3 brand new interviews added

so i think scrap the old MGM release and get this new scream factory blu-ray
definitely time to upgrade for sure definitely worth the money
5 stars i gave this new blu-ray version of THE HOWLING",1372464000,,2242,4.654040404040404

Here the change from man to wolf is done slowly and very scary! Dee Wallace does a great job and never looked better. The Bluray
transfer will knock your socks off! This movie looks and sounds better than ever. This is a classic and is better than CGI werewolf movies of today. Here what you see on film is what the camera saw.......no CGI.This is what a werewolf movie should be laughs,
thrills and plenty of nightmarish chills!",1372118400,,698,4.4609375
1614264,5,B00005K3NW,"I remember waaaay back in my high school days when we all loaded up to go see this movie in the theater.  We were all scared out of our pants, and completely amazed at the special effects.  I mean, we sat there and actually watched these people turn into werewolves right in front of the camera....it was AWESOME!!  This was way before computer animation, so we had never seen anything quite like this before.  Over the years, I've purchased this movie at least twice, with the last update being several years ago.  I had feared that it might never get its turn on Blu-ray, that is until I saw a few months back that Shout Factory was going to be releasing it. Up to that point, the only other title I had in my collection from Shout was Phantasm 2, and I was totally satisfied with what they did to make it a special edition.

Here's one thing that Shout has continued to do on almost every title I've since purchased from them.  They will create new cover artwork for the film, which I love.  But just in case you're not a fan of the new artwork, they also provide the original movie poster artwork on the flip side of the cover insert.  There are some titles where I like the newly commissioned artwork, but then there are titles like The Howling where I just don't think you can ever outdo the original work with the claws ripping through and you see the lady's mouth screaming through one of the tears in the fabric.  What I love about that artwork is it is not clear if she is being attacked by a werewolf, or if she is actually becoming one.  I'm so glad that Shout continues to honor the work done by the original artists, thereby giving me the option to decide which cover I go with.

Now let's get to the movie itself.  It had been a few years since I've watched this film, so some of the frights still worked for me.  I turned the lights off and the sound up as the iconic scratch marks rip across the screen, which as the camera pans out you realize spells The Howling.  When the screen suddenly explodes, that got my adrenaline going, and now I was ready for the ride.  The picture on this is just absolutely beautiful.  I really have never seen such a clear print of this film.  The colors are really rich and vibrant, and the blacks have a good solid look to them.  If the picture doesn't blow you away, then the sound certainly will.  They have done a great job with the surround effects.  One of the things I had forgotten about this film was the music.  The way the organ is used really brings you back to the glory days of the Universal monster films, but then the orchestral score  is woven so beautifully  which helps create a really creepy atmosphere.  Listen for yourself, and I think you'll agree.

The one thing I was afraid of seeing this in high definition was that it might make the special effects look a little less than pleasant.  That is not the case at all.  This still stands as a groundbreaking film in the use of special effects, and I think they hold up very well to some of the CGI crap I've seen.  The only scene where it really stood out to me was the one where the man and woman turn into werewolves in the midst of there loving by the fire.  The animation is much more apparent in HD, but it's not a big enough distraction to ruin the whole thing.  It is amazing how they managed to pull off the effects with what they had to work with back then.

One of the things I really like about Shout is the fact that many times they will produce some new special features for these new releases.  But never fear, because the other features from the DVD are also included, some of which have had a visual upgrade since their original release.  The new features are really cool, and give us some fresh insight to the behind-the-scenes goings on during the making of The Howling.

Bottom Line:  If you like a good old-fashioned horror film, then you owe it to yourself to get this movie.  If you already own the DVD version from a few years back, forget it.  The new sound and video upgrades are well worth a double-dip.  Not to mention some new special features.",1371859200,,4094,4.30890052356021
1614265,5,B00005K3NW,"It seems like forever this movie has been on home video of some sort. I have had the Laserdisc, DVDs, and now blu ray. Shout! was the selling point for my blu ray purchase (besides being an awesome movie!). But let's face it: Fox/MGM has not been kind to their transfers of this classic onto home video (I admit the special edition DVD was cool, but the movie looked bad). This 1080p disc from Shout! gives this movie a resurrection it so deserved. The image is the best it will probably look. There were a few soft spots (but were probably intentional) but over all the disc is detailed like never before. The night scenes you can actually see what's going on. I thoroughly enjoy watching this movie and all its tongue in cheek humor with all the character actors from the past. And now in glorious HD!! Shout! has been releasing many Fox/MGM titles onto blu ray that Fox would not think of doing (still waiting for True Lies, The Abyss, and Strange Days to get released with anamorphic video!!) and giving these releases a good (sometimes great) transfers. Shout! is our genre movie rescue like Criterion rescues the classics. Shout! has made a big addition to my DVD/blu ray collection. After purchasing The Howling, Lifeforce, Rolling Thunder, Town That Dreaded Sundown recently, I cannot wait to see what Shout! has in store for us fans in the near future.

1614268,4,B00005K3NW,"I can always count on Scream Factory to present me with opportunities to revisit the cult classic horror films of the 1980s. ""The Howling"" gets an upgrade, marking the first time the movie has ever been available on Blu-ray. Many werewolf fans are wondering if the film feels aged in a high-definition format. I'm happy to report It's not without its faults, but holds up quite well.

After news anchor Karen White (Dee Wallace) is attacked by a mysterious stranger (Robert Picardo), she starts having bizarre dreams and night terrors about the incident. Karen's doctor (Patrick Macnee) convinces her that she and husband Bill (Christopher Stone) should go through his treatment at ""The Colony."" Strange things start to happen as soon as they arrive. Could Karen be cracking up or is there something sinister going on in the secluded resort?

Like most movies from the 1970s and the 1980s, ""The Howling"" is a slow-burner. This isn't one of those horror films that starts with a bang, keeps a frantic pace, and goes out with a bang. It slowly establishes its plot and characters and gives the audience a little at a time until the climactic and shocking end. Things might move too slowly for today's impatient audience. I even found it tedious at times. The scenes get choppy throughout and it seems like director Joe Dante was rushing things at some points.

Rob Bottin's special effects for ""The Howling"" are still just as effective today as they were in 1981. The werewolf transformation scenes are unnerving and quite detailed. One transformation takes what seems like three to four minutes. It's all about attention to detail when it comes to Bottin's practical effects and animatronics versus today's obsession with rapid fire CGI scenes of metamorphosis.

""The Howling Collector's Edition"" is presented in 1080p high-definition widescreen (1.85:1) with 5.1 surround sound. The picture clarity is wonderful and the audio immerses the viewer in ferocious howls, sound effects, and a quirky musical score. The only problem is that the high-definition transfer exposes the dated animated effects in the movie, such as a couple distant shots of werewolves.

""The Howling"" does feature quite a bit of the usual unnecessary nudity found in 1980's horror films. However, this time around director Dante attempts to justify it by analyzing our need to let the beast within out, mostly through sexual and physical acts of violence. The doctor, played by the late Patrick Macnee, convincingly regurgitates a lot of ""primal scream"" mumbo jumbo throughout the movie.

As usual, Scream Factory packed ""The Howling Collector's Edition"" full of exciting bonus material. Audio commentary is provided by Director Joe Dante and Actors Dee Wallace, Christopher Stone, and Robert Picardo. It includes the multi-part ""Unleashing the Beast: The Making of 'The Howling'"" and ""Making of a Monster: Inside 'The Howling'"" documentaries. We also get a tour of the film's locations thanks to ""Horror's Hallowed Grounds."" Deleted scenes, outtakes, a photo gallery, and theatrical trailers round out the special features.

Scream Factory proves to be a champion for horror classics once again with ""The Howling Collector's Edition."" This is one of those essential werewolf films which genre fans have waited to be released on Blu-ray. Although it's a bit slow and takes some time getting started, great special effects and interesting, albeit hokey, social commentary set this apart from the normal monster movie fare.",1370476800,,3493,5.19360568383659

Special effects like the ones in this movie still cannot be match today. The woods, the fog, the creepy characters are all used to full advantage.

1614293,1,B00005K3NW,"This review is based on the product received and not the actual movie.  I work at a library, and we purchased this movie for patron use.  The album art is slightly different than pictured here.  It is white with the wolf pictured behind the torn screen.  Also, the disc is only single-sided.  There is a standard looking image label over the front of the disc, so you can't play that side.  For the main side which you CAN play, you get the movie, scene selection, theatrical trailer, and language options.  I don't think the special features are supposed to be Easter eggs (based on what I could find online), and if they are, well they're *extremely* well-hidden.

Anyway, a one-sided/movie only disc will be fine for our patrons, but it's misleading for the paper insert to state that the DVD is double sided and then list all the special features.  I'm sure this will also annoy those patrons who like the special features.  Since we've already put a barcode and other stickers on the item, we won't be able to return it.

1614294,5,B00005K3NW,"Werewolves taken seriously and fantastically !  I can still watch and enjoy this movie alongside new releases--and not because it's so bad it's good, but because it's just plain good!  This is the second best werewolf movie ever made--behind An American Werewolf in London (also 1981).  FOR THE SUPERFANS:  There are a lot of major familiar faces in this movie.  The director also took every possible chance to throw wolf cartoons, movies and books in the background, werewolf movie directors' names for characters, etc. throughout.  This could make for a great horror geek drinking game!

After a stalker (Robert Picardo; Legend, Munchies, 976-Evil) attacks newscaster Karen (Dee Wallace; E.T., Cujo, Critters, Hansel and Gretel), she is a wreck--she can't work, she can't sleep.  As a form of rest-and-relaxation therapy, Dr. Wagner (Patrick Macnee; Bloodsuckers, Waxwork, Waxwork 2) prescribes some time at 'the colony.'  So she and her boyfriend Bill (Christopher Stone; Cujo) venture to this hospitable, beachside, group-therapy retreat run by Dr. Wagner.

The locals are a mixture of odd, inbred, occult and hillbilly--but generally friendly.  Colony locals Marsha (Elisabeth Brooks) and Erle (John Carradine) serve as harbingers that something strange is going on...you see, they're all werewolves!
Annnnnd, that's the plot.

Meanwhile, Karen's colleague Terry (Belinda Balaski; The Food of the Gods, Piranha, Gremlins) is investigating werewolves with her boyfriend.  Why?  Because Karen's stalker had weird werewolf drawings--including a werewolfed-up Karen--all over his apartment.  Evidently, he was a werewolf!  Under the guidance of used bookstore owner Dick Miller (Piranha, Gremlins), they watch old movies, read up on lycanthropy.  Then Terry joins Karen and Bill at the colony while Terry's boyfriend rounds up some silver bullets.

Yeah. This makes sense.  I often seek sage advice from used bookstore owners in small towns.  Especially when dealing with all things supernatural.  Totally normal.

The build-up is long and slow, but things get moving when Bill is attacked by a werewolf during a display of non-CGI, creature costume effects that today's standards find laughable.  Suddenly Bill, a vegetarian, is eating meat and loving it and succumbing to the sexual draw of ""the beast within.""  Keeping in step with sex and the beast, the first transformation scene is mid-coitus.  On camera we see incisors elongate, but otherwise the camera looks away, then returns to a yet hairier, now contact-lensed Bill.  The effects turn to crude ""wide angle"" silhouette animation.  It's awful in terms of effects quality, but in its 80s horror-ness, it is not without some charm.  Further indicative of budgetary and technological limitations, we largely see only the head or only the claw or arm of a werewolf during attack scenes earlier in the movie.  Again, though, with an 80s horror appeal to it.
However, breaking away from typical 80s limitations, we do eventually see many good shots of ""whole"" werewolves.  I must say, for 1981 (or even today!!!), it looks really impressive and rather cool even next to more recent releases using CGI (Underworld Awakening) or costume/make-up (Cursed).  It's more lean, tall, shaggy and rough looking; more sinister and monstrous than simply a man-wolf hybrid.  This really may be the scariest looking werewolf ever.  They did a damn good job!!!

The gore is not abundant in the first hour, but several scenes delivers some cool, gross, slimy effects after the hour mark.  I should also add that, like what more we see of the creatures later in the movie, we likewise will see more provocative transformations with pulsating skin and elongating jaws.  We see a long transformation that the director really wanted us to enjoy, much as in The Company of Wolves (1984) or An American Werewolf in London (1981).  They're fun celebrations of slimy latex prostheses.

Director Joe Dante (Piranha, Gremlins) took a new approach to the werewolf movie and it worked.  Dante gives us werewolves that regenerate at a ""realistic"" speed with their classic vulnerability to silver, but unlike most movies of the time, he presented werewolves as a subspecies living in a group, like a wolf pack.  Other approaches up to that time were limited to single, cursed individuals depicting werewolves.  These depictions were very Jekyll and Hyde, with the afflicted individual having no control or recollection of the actions of the wolf.  In The Howling, lycanthropy is still a transmittable affliction, but it alters the psychology of the afflicted rather than adding an altogether new and mutually exclusive personality.

The ending is cool--and even gets farcically ripped in Howling 3: The Marsupials.  Make sure you see this classic.  Even effects whores will be happy with the gore, transformations and make-up work which stand the test of time.",1358467200,,4886,5.296488946684005
1614295,5,B00005K3NW,"5 Stars = Masterpiece

If you're a werewolf lover, than 1981 was your year to howl! Three masterpieces of the sub-genre were presented to us to feast our fangs on! We had, ""An American Werewolf in London,"" ""Wolfen,"" & ""The Howling."" All of these, true groundbreaking horror films of the hairy kind! This was before werewolves, vampires, & zombies became the CGI infested, mundane, out of thrills, overused sub-genres they are today. This was when fresh blood was pulsing through the viens of horror!

""An American Werewolf in London"" is my favorite, but the ""Howling,"" runs a wolf's hair behind in second place. While both these films had mass amounts of neck hair sprouting scares, terror, & suspense, ""The Howling"" played it a little more straight than ""An American Werewolf in London."" That is not to say, ""The Howling"" lacked any black humor & winks, for there is some in abundance, especially the beach cook out scene, where we get to see all sorts of weird characters come out of the woods. All belonging to a commune of sorts. But, this is not your 60's style hippie commune, though the characters are strange enough. They don't welcome everyone, just people that are inclined to sprout hair, grow fangs & claws, & eat people. It's really quite a novel idea, a psychological retreat for werewolves, so they don't eat people. Kind of like telling a Zombie to have a bowl of Captain Crunch. Though this works for awhile, you can take a human out of the wolf, but not the wolf out of the human, & mayhem is but a hair away.

On the serious side, ""The Howling"" is filled with dread & suspense. A couple of scenes come right to mind. Dee Wallace (what horror film has she not been in?) as news anchor Karen White, is doing a story on a serial killer that is still on the loose. They have been corresponding, & ""Eddie,"" the self proclaimed killer wants to meet. Meet at a peepshow booth in an adult store. This scene seethes menace, suspense, & terror, as Eddie comes up behind Karen in the dark booth putting his hands on her shoulders, wanting to enlighten her to his world. He starts to change, & we can only see glimpses of him, as Karen stares at the camera, wide eyed in terror & screams. All through this, we get a very effective music score to go with it, it is something you won't forget. There is also another scene in the Northern California woods, that is the definition of dread, as Karen's husband hears wolves howling, & goes out to see for himself. This scene truly feeds on the deep down instinctive primal fear of going into the woods at night, alone. Not knowing what or who is out there. The human psyche at it's most primordial & vulnerable.

Yes, ""The Howling"" does just about everything right, & the most amazing is the special effects! The transformation scenes are pure genius, as make up artist Rob Bottin makes his creatures come to life! Rick Baker started on ""the Howling, but left to make ""An American Werewolf in London,"" which was John Landis & his dream movie. Meanwhile Rob Bottin proved he was more than capable of taking Baker's place. He then went off to do ""The Thing,"" & like Baker, became a legend in the business. One unforgettable scene of Bottin's wizardry is where Eddie is transforming after being shot in the head & says, ""I'm going to give you a piece of my mind,"" as he digs into his forehead & extracts a piece of brain with his fingers. The black comedy of this scene is not lost, but it's really the horrifying special effects that are the star, & when ""The Howling"" first came out, this scene was a revelation in effects & horror that is now immortal!

I'm sure most of you, that have read this review, have seen ""the Howling."" For those of you that have not, why? See it today, tonight, tomorrow, but see it! Now we just need it on Blu ray!",1357689600,,3794,4.492753623188406

Repression is the father of neurosis says a TV doctor. [Has this been proved scientifically?] The TV Lady is doing a story about a suspected killer (as a decoy). Karen White enters a porno video store and then a private booth to meed Eddie. Two cops enter the store, open the door and fire shots to end the reign of terror from a killer in Los Angeles. Karen now has an emotional problem. I don't remember. Reporters enter the room of the suspect and view his artwork. [The police weren't there?] Karen goes on TV but freezes; she is removed and replaced. She cant remember what happened. A doctor recommends rest and vacation for her amnesia. She and her husband Bill visit a resort, the Colony. We see the people there. [Recognize that old man?] There is music, singing, and a pig roast. That night she hears howls. The wind or a dog? Karen hears animal noises at night.

The dead suspect, Eddie, has disappeared from the morgue! Two women go walking in the night when their flashlight goes out. Cattle mutilations? Karen tries to recall that traumatic event but cant. A bookseller touts his wares. Marsha will cook a rabbit later. Something attacks Bill in the dark. A couple watches an old movie at night (The Wolfman from 1940). The next day Bill now has an appetite for meat. Karen has dreams at night. She hears howls at night and records them. Bill meets Marsha at night. [Do they need an orthodontist?] Karen goes exploring in the daytime. She finds a small cottage and enters, then takes photos. Suddenly a furry beast attacks! A hatchet severs its paw, Karen runs to the main building. Was that a nightmare? Scratches on Bills back are a clue!

Reporter Terry goes to investigate the Colony and looks into the files. She calls reporter Christian at the news station to tell what she found. Suddenly a furry beast disturbs her search! Can the Sheriff send help? Karen finds her body! Next she sees Eddie again! How is this possible? He changes shape before her eyes and becomes a threatening monster. Karen throws a yellow acid on him and runs away. But she is caught! She is told the secret of the Colony. Shut up, Doc! Karen is too well-known to simply disappear. Christopher arrives with his rifle and special order bullets. Where is Terry? Christopher finds the werewolves and begins shooting. The werewolves are trapped in the barn, which is set afire to kill them. Can they get away? Two more werewolves show up! They have to warn people and make them believe! [Would you believe this?] Karen will report the news of the fire at the Colony. There is a secret society living among people! Karen offer irrefutable proof! There is a final scene in a tavern. One customer orders hamburger rare. What happens next?

This movie could have been better with a better story and writer. It just seems to be missing something. [Compare it to the 1940 movie The Wolfman.] Does it remind you of The Invasion of the Body Snatchers from 1956 with aliens invading society? Werewolves are people who turn into anti-humans to prey upon the people. [Do they symbolize Wall Street Financiers and their synthetic credit derivatives that prey upon investors?] I wonder when this and other films will show up in a 50 movie pack? It took a good guy with a gun to stop these beasts, a lesson for some. Will this be allowed in future horror films? The beginning shows scenes censored in earlier times. Is there a society to complain about this treatment of werewolves?",1342310400,,3482,4.6477272727272725

You would probably say that the psychopath was crazy... but what if your worst fears were his desires and they were to keep you up at night while that dreaded howling can be heard from the town called Drago.... That is what Karen White (Dee Wallace Stone) experienced!!

Plot: Karen White is a reporter with inside information of a man only known as Eddie whom is being tracked down for his sex offending ways.... he wants Karen to be his latest victim.. But his plans are foiled and he ends up being shot in the head.... for Karen's sake of comfort her doctor suggests that she stay in a town in the middle of nowhere called Drago.... The Folk seem friendly but the strange howling at night is concerning her more and more until she finds out the towns dreaded secret!

Review: I have only started reading the novel and I enjoyed Joe Dante's other work such as Piranha (1978), Gremlins (1984) and Gremlins 2 (1990)... But this is by far his most sadistic and chilling vision I have ever had the pleasure of watching. The Howling is a movie that exceeds the boundaries where you feel as there is no where to run.... I know that if I was in the situation that Karen was in I would've given up. It that feeling of no help to be found and that dreaded fear of being chased by werewolves! This movie is superb in things such as the special effects to the atmosphere!

Acting: Dee Wallace Stone (Cujo, Abominable etc.) has a very strong performance and takes her role very seriously and as for Robert Picardo (Star Trek) he plays the perfect Eddie Quist!

Gore: a ripped throat (off-screen), a severed hand, some mutilated animals, and some dry shootings.... I do have to say that I was a bit disappointed in the gore department... but the special effects absolutely make up for the loss!

The Bottom Line: The Howling will be enjoyed for years to come and It is defiantly worth the fair price of the DVD!

1614323,5,B00005K3NW,"Yes that is an ACTUAL question from our friend Santa posed back in 1998. As we sat around that evening we discussed which monster out of the classic creatures would be the worst to come into contact with. It was a thought provoking discussion that left us all in agreement on a clear winner....the Werewolf. Seriously who in their right mind would ever be able to overcome a werewolf? Unless your strutting around with some silver bullets you'd be completely screwed. First off they're huge and powerful, secondly their fast like the wind, and lastly they'll either rip you to shreds or turn you into one of them. So clearly this is a beast to be reckoned with. Now when it comes to horror B you can never go wrong with some straight up wolfman action. There's plenty out in the movie world to choose from, by why not start with the best known. It's a film very easy to obtain which has kept it on the back burner. However with October approaching we thought there's really no better time to indulge in the werewolf classic from 1981. And what better way for the Howling to celebrate it's 30th year then with a Sid review?

The Howling starts off with a nice early 80's gritty feeling as a newswoman prepares to go on an undercover story. Her name, Karen White. The objective, get an exclusive interview with a serial killer. For some reason the killer wants them to meet in the back of an adult video store, surprised Santa wasn't there, while sitting in a peep show booth. Once there Karen becomes terrified to see this killer is more of a creature then human. Yup you guessed it, he's a wolfman. In a porn shop Santa wouldn't have been phased, but Karens a normal human and severely traumatized. With the help of her psychiatrist she decides to go on a retreat. Unfortunately for her it's a trap, and she's stuck in the woods with a whole pack of werewolves. We must say the wolf people were AWESOME for 1981. These were some scary looking creatures. We won't go further because it should be witnessed, and Sid doesn't want to spoil an actually good horror for you.

So it turns out we now have physical proof that our wolfman theory was correct. There's nothing beating out a wolfman except maybe a bigger wolfman. The Howling really had everything Sid needed. The movie takes a little while to heat up, but once it gets flowing you really want to be friends with it. The creatures were fantastic, especially when the one guys morphs in front of our very eyes. It looked very uncomfortable like Santa attempting to squeeze into in football pants. Yet wasn't funny like when he fell on his face and then started crying. The morphing scene is something that has been talked about in horror history with good reason. There's even a hot 80's wolf lady whose pretty much the leader of the PACK. Vroom Vroom. Yeah we're envisioning him doing the fruity motorcycle thing then point to his yellow hat. So outside of the confusing references, please watch the Howling if you haven't done so yet. It's a film that should have been done 3 years ago on an epic Thursday Chuckfest.",1315699200,,3072,4.543321299638989
1614324,4,B00005K3NW,"The Howling is a werewolf film that is a little different to your average horror -- which is probably why it has endured so long. Karen White (Dee Wallace -- who every bloke went bananas over, in the day, though I thought Belinda Balaski (who plays her friend Terri) was far more ""appealing"" in this respect!) is a TV reporter who (whilst going undercover to try and expose a serial killer who is stalking her) survives a werewolf encounter. Because of the shock, she is invited (by her therapist -- a Christopher-Lee-like Patrick Macnnee) to recuperate at ""the colony"" (a spooky, woodland reserve by the seaside) where -- as you might guess -- when the moon comes out, all is not as it seems.

The acting (as was the case for the subsequent year's big werewolf film, An American Werewolf in London) is much better than you would expect in a ""creature feature"" and the main characters are all convincing. The atmosphere of the colony is great -- think misty trees, wood cabins and sixties (Lost-style) university buildings. Of course, any werewolf film also lives or dies on the beast itself and in this respect, The Howling is a somewhat mixed bag. It seems that the budget was saved for the later stages of the film, as before then (due to some truly awful -- at one point animated! -- effects) I was thinking this was a 2 or at most a 3 star film (nothing more than a well acted B movie, with men in hairy suits; I was wondering how I could have remembered this so fondly!). Throughout, though, there is an razor-sharp tension, that builds and builds and then suddenly erupts into the horror you were expecting from a film of this standing. When the beast emerges fully, you are left suitably terrified to realise what the fuss was all about! (Far more so than with any modern CGI Werewolf!)

Like Piranha and Gremlins, Dante's trademark dark humour is in place (though somewhat muted, in comparison, to make way for genuine tension here). There is occasional skin, but nothing to write home about (if you like that sort of thing in your horror films!) Ultimately, if you like early eighties horror films, then you will feel right at home here. The production values are somewhat mixed, but the setting is charming and atmospheric and the leads keep the story moving, and when the terror emerges it is genuinely unsettling! If it weren't for the B-movie patchiness at times, I'd give this 5 stars, but don't let that put you off: it's still one of the best werewolf films out there (possibly competing with Ginger Snaps for second place to American Werewolf -- my opinion!)

1614325,2,B00005K3NW,"This is one of those movies that everyone has seen and has become a standard part of most people's [of a certain age's] consciousness--and yet I had never seen it. So off to rectify that situation immediately, and now that I have, I can authoritatively say: yup, there it is.

This stars horror icon Dee Wallace as newscaster Karen White, is co-written by John Sayles, has music by Pino Donaggio, and is directed by Joe Dante. We first meet Karen walking through an alley, where a hot bearded dude propositions her. Ah, for the days when hot bearded dudes dressed like truckers were just hanging around alleyways. Karen has been sent to meet with a stalker who has been hounding her, and is wearing a wire connected to her news station. It's all going to be part of a news exclusive. We soon learn that her signal is spotty at best, placing her in mortal danger, which the news crew only shows so much concern about. Present in the studio is smoldering mustachioed man-hunk Bill, Karen's husband, and pretty much the only one worried about her. Karen goes into a porn store, then into a booth, where she soon realizes she is not alone. On screen in the booth is a rape video, where we see a woman being tied up and attacked by two guys with stockings over their heads. Effective use of this movie within the movie to indirectly bump up the threat of what will happen to Karen. So Eddie, her stalker, comes out of the darkness and, presumably, reveals himself as a werewolf. Karen freaks, but by then the police are there and she barely escapes as Eddie is repeatedly shot right in front of her. Afterward, Karen is in deep shock, and does NOT seem like she's going to be okay.

Present at the news station is Dennis Dugan as Chris, one of Karen's friend and an important character throughout the movie. Karen is deeply traumatized, and goes catatonic on air her first day back on the job. She's also having issues with intimacy, which her husband, who is a man who has needs, is not exactly sensitive to. She gets sent to a psychologist, Dr. Waggner, who sends her out to this new-agey retreat on the California coast to recuperate. There they meet all the resident messed-up weirdoes during the required bonfire on the beach, which is where we meet black-clad super-vamp Marcia. She's got her lusty eye on Karen's steaming hunk of man-slab Bill, and who can blame her when he poses so provocatively in his red and white nylon racing jacket.
Meanwhile, back home, Karen's co-workers Chris and Terry are continuing to investigate the case of Eddie the rapist from the beginning, finding spooky drawings in his room, then discovering that his corpse has gotten up and walked away. They go to a witchcraft supply store which the movie establishes, as a blinking title says ""Crucial Exposition,"" keeps silver bullets in stock.

Meanwhile, Karen's husband Bill has proven himself not to be a sensitive 70s hunk after all but rather a callous 70s douche, becoming all frustrated with Karen's ongoing trauma, particularly when it means lack of sex for him, or being woken in the middle of the night. He ends up in the home of sultry Marcia, who makes it clear that he can shake his pepper on her eggs any day. He resists, barely, and is attacked and bitten on the way home. By the way, we learned, back in the exposition shop, that this movie will NOT respect the whole full moon thing, but that it will arbitrarily maintain the whole silver bullet thing. Don't ask impertinent questions. That afternoon, formerly vegetarian Bill is seen tearing into a chicken drumstick, never a good sign, and ends up walking out into the woods in the middle of the night, looking for love in all the wrong places, after once more receiving not so much as a toe job from his traumatized wife. Why, who should be out there by the fire but lusty Marcia, and they go at it. But soon they're growing big teeth and drooling all over each other, in one of the scenes I'm SURE your friend with cable had you over to watch when you were a teen, and finally resolving into some ANIMATION that show us the people transforming while scrumping. Talk about the beast with two backs.

Meanwhile Terry has come up to investigate, and soon recognizes the cove as the place they saw in Eddie's drawings. Then she gets attacked, and it's all run, run, chase, chase, and I must admit by now I was kind of losing interest. She chops off the hand of the attacker, and it turns obviously hollow and rubber, then turns back into a human hand. Then she goes to this office and calls Chris, who is watching some cartoon with a wolf [basically, every possible wolf reference is worked into the background somewhere]. Chris can barely hear what she's saying because of the TV, to the point where you want her to say ""Can you turn off the TV and listen to me?!"" Especially since we saw them in bed together earlier, so they're not just good buddies [although maybe they are--it's not for me to judge]. Anyway, Chris does the whole ""It was probably just a bear"" thing, and assigns Terry to rifle through the files in the office and dig up some info. She finds some info--but also a werewolf, who chases her around the doctor's office. At one point she turns on a bright light that causes the werewolf to recoil in horror, after which she clearly thinks ""Great! Now let me abandon the one and only thing that has offered me any protection, and get back in the open where I am much more vulnerable to being disemboweled!"" Which is precisely what happens.

Next it's Karen's turn to do something phenomenally stupid. She's in the same office, where she finds Terry's body, and also Eddie, who turns into a werewolf right before her eyes [which seems to involve his cheeks and brow bulging a lot], a process that takes a full minute of screen time, while Karen considerately stands by, doing absolutely nothing, just standing, staring. Maybe she thought it would be rude to look for something to defend herself? I mean, how would that make him feel? He might be offended. No, better to just stand there staring like a dope, Karen. Good job. It must also be noted that Wallace looks pretty bored. She finally grows a brain cell and throws some random fluid at him, which, lucky for her, turns out to be acid! Because it's not labeled and, frankly, it looks like Mountain Dew. Poor dumb Karen would be out of luck if it was Mountain Dew, huh?

As you can tell, by now I had pretty much lost all interest and just wanted it over with. So the doctor shows up and drags Karen out to the big barn dance, where we find out--surprise!--that everyone at the retreat is a werewolf. You'll notice around this time that Karen's husband Bill has simply VANISHED from the film and what's more, she doesn't seem to notice. Some marriages are like that. Anyway, terror, terror, until Chris shows up with his rifle full of silver bullets. Only it's one of those things where the werewolf is advancing on him slowly and he refuses to shoot. You know, I understand we want to create suspense here, but when your characters are acting like idiots, it's easy for us, the audience, to lose respect for them. Especially in the case of Karen, who at least has been a stone cold moron from the start, making it consistent with her character when she seems to decide ""Yeah sure, my friend with a gun is right over there, but maybe I'll just stay here surrounded by werewolves for a while."" I think she's too concerned with other's feelings, frankly, which may be why she married such a self-centered loser. But I digress. We barely have time to wonder at how Chris' rifle seemingly need never be reloaded before they get in his car and escape, a journey punctuated by several additional wolf attacks I fast-forwarded through.

For a big finish, Karen decides that she must go on the news and let the public know about the werewolf menace. So she starts reading her own speech, then transforms right on air. We have a smattering of viewer reaction, including some kids who casually tell their mom ""The news lady turned into a werewolf,"" and two guys at a bar, one of whom believes, but the other saying ""It's amazing what they can do with special effects these days."" Then Chris shoots her right on air! And without so much as a parental advisory. Well, there go opportunities for a sequel, but--DOH!

Sometimes it's hard to watch these things decades later and get into it the way one might have when it came out and was new. For the first half I was fairly into it, mostly for the energetic oomph of Dante's direction and the film's sense of fun, both of which go a long way. But after a while the film simply drops the interesting personal melodrama and social and sexual issues--for example the non-resolution of Karen's marriage and the abrupt vanishing of her husband--and it just becomes a series of stalkings and chases that are not particularly distinguished. Not to mention that as it goes on it becomes quite apparent that these characters are a touch more obtuse than most, and act in certain ways just to extend the running time of the film or evoke certain effects--which can distance one from the characters, and thus the story. If they keep doing things just to extend suspense, and that it quite obvious, it takes one out of the story and reminds you that you are just sitting there watching a film. Plus, one has to face that by now--and even when this was released--we had seen all this stuff many times before.

Nevertheless, it's good fun for a while, and one can appreciate how when it came out things like the werewolf sex scene and the news desk transformation were new and kind of awesome. And even now I suppose it's good to have seen, just to complete one's 80s horror movie knowledge. Yeah, I wish I could get more excited about it.",1303516800,,9778,4.554292211483798
1614326,5,B00005K3NW,"1981 saw the release of two werewolf movies that are now considered classics of the genre - An American Werewolf in London and The Howling. The former is a fun little horror flick, full of self-referential in-jokes and genuinely scary sequences. The Howling attempts a similar tack but to much less effective results, though it's hard not to appreciate Rob Bottin's astounding special effects work.

Part of the problem is the oddball storyline, which takes far too long to get going and eventually places all the action within a bizarre woodland retreat. The script, by John Sayles and Terence H. Winkless (and based on a novel by Gary Brandner), is packed with instances of off-kilter humor and surprisingly violent kill sequences - though everything in between such moments doesn't fare nearly as well. That the film ultimately doesn't work is made all-the-more baffling by the presence of director Joe Dante, who's no stranger to this sort of thing (ie Gremlins).

Dee Wallace stars as Karen White, an investigative journalist who comes under attack while on a gig. The violent encounter leaves Karen traumatized and unable to function, so her shrink (played by Patrick Macnee) tells her to pay a visit to The Colony - a place where other assault victims gather, presumably in an effort to get over their collective traumatic pasts. But it becomes increasingly clear that this no ordinary retreat, and it's not long before Karen and her husband Bill (Christopher Stone) must fend for their lives.

One thing that the movie does right is holding off on the werewolf reveal - we don't get a good look at one until about an hour into the movie - a risky choice given how dicey such special effects can be, but Bottin certainly delivers. His creature is far more animated and interesting than some of the performers, particularly Wallace. Though she's since proven that she's a decent actress, Wallace is completely out of her league here - particularly in the few sequences that require her to come face-to-face with a werewolf. Rather than all-out fright, Wallace's reaction is somewhere in between curiosity and ambivalence (the rest of her performance is equally underwhelming).

Yet The Howling has its followers, and the film has since spawned several sequels. But with its slow pace and lack of compelling characters, it's hard not to wonder just what it is about the movie that fans have latched onto - though there's no denying that Bottin's work is as impressive as one might expect.",1297814400,,2493,4.94272076372315

1614328,5,B00005K3NW,"TV anchorwoman Karen White (Dee Wallace) agrees to be wired and meet vicious serial killer Eddie the Mangler, in the hopes of his apprehension by authorities. While the end result is seemingly successful, Karen's brief ordeal with the monster has left her emotionally distraught and the final few seconds of their meeting repressed in memory. Behavior expert Dr. George Waggner (Patrick Macnee) suggests that she takes some time off and go to ""The Colony"", an isolated retreat where residents all share, in their own ways, dealing with inner issues. As the title of Dr. Waggner's latest best seller would indicate, many people certainly have to deal with ""The Beast"" within them... however hairy and bloodthirsty they may be...

Where do I begin on how much I love this movie... There is a bit of bias involved, as werewolves are my favorite horror villains. That said, the one-two punch of director Joe Dante and writer John Sayles could've done a horror movie about caterpillars and have a great result (see Piranha (1978) for further evidence). Not to mention a cornucopia of familiar and likeable supporting actors (horror legend John Carradine, Dick Miller, Slim Pickens, Balinda Balaski, Kevin McCarthy and the very seducing Elisabeth Brooks), art direction from Robert A. Burns (responsible for the unsettledness in Texas Chain Saw Massacre), excellent FX by Rob Bottin and loads of in-joke references to other werewolf movies that even the most notable enthusiast of the subgenre won't likely catch them all. It is understandable for some viewers to feel this entry in the ""Year of the Werewolf"" (a brief revival of said movies in 1981 which included Wolfen and the often favored An American Werewolf in London) is light on lycanthrope screentime and questionable on logistics at times, of which I agree, if only very slightly. Nonetheless, this is my favorite werewolf movie and one of my favorite horror movies ever. Perfection? No. But you rarely get a horror movie made by horror movie fans for horror movie fans, and dog(wolf?)gone it, that's something special. Note: Within the multi-part documentary as part of the special features, behold the (thankfully) discarded FX scenes, including stop motion animation and, snicker, rocket propelled werewolves! 9.5/10",1294790400,,2274,5.1961852861035425

1614360,4,B00005K3NW,"This particular offering from Joe Dante and crew back in the 80's was one of the first werewolf films I had ever seen uncut and unedited, thanks to the ancient wonder of ""premium channels"".  Perhaps that may make me a little biased subconsciously, but I like to think I'm mature and objective enough in my passion for film to see what there is to see...or what's NOT there.

That said, ""The Howling"" still ranks as my very most favorite werewolf movie.  I love ""An American Werewolf in London"", huge fan of ""Dog Soldiers"", ""Ginger Snaps""...I could go on, but you get the point.

Are any of these 'better' films than ""The Howling""?  In the grand generalized scheme of things, likely so...but to paraphrase Obi-Wan Kenobi, it depends on our own point of view.

What works for me in this flick can be explained in 1)  The concept:  werewolves DO exist...always have...but to get away from what some of them view as persecution (torch and pitchfork wielding villagers spring to mind), they've enacted a ruse to ""fit in"", having their own little society at a secluded compound, raising cattle for food, and day to day representing themselves as regular, if a bit odd, members of humanity.  Some of this clan don't agree with what they see as ""hiding"", and with a flair of superiority would prefer to take their place as top of the food chain.  Lo and behold, one of their members does just this, but covers himself in the trappings of a serial killer...

...and this is where the film begins, and brings me to the second point of why I love this one, 2) Execution.  The stunning Dee Wallace turned in what I thought to be a phenomenal performance as an investigative newswoman who has been contacted by the 'killer' (our wayward werewolf, played by Robert Picardo in a creepy performance that can only be called 'chilling'), and is determined to put a stop to his activities.  Needless to say, things don't go well, and after a confrontation with this killer, she suffers amnesia and severe anxiety.  The film goes on to her traveling to a remote compound run by a famed psychologist in order to ""recharge"" and therapeutically work through her issues.

I won't go any further into the plot than that, but you folks out there can probably figure why the word ""compound"" was used twice in two paragraphs;)  Regarding the story itself, the pacing does get a bit shaky at times, but never to the point that it's senseless or, in my opinion, difficult to follow.  A lot of the supporting actors are a little stiff, but still on or above par with the contemporary films of the day.

The special effects, where many reviewers here were not impressed, were to my eyes very impressive for their time, and even still...both transformations and gore are prevalent in this film, albeit largely in the second reel.  One glaring departure:  there is one scene that, due to budgetary constraints, had to be done with animation; it's quite obvious, and quite weak...a blight on the film that cost it one star in my rating.

Finally, several other peers of mine have complained that the ending was dissatisfying...I can only say (and not give too much away) that the film itself answers the question of 'why' things transpire at the end the way they do...you just have to pay attention.

So there it is; I'm not saying it's a great MOVIE, but I think it IS a great HORROR movie.  All in all, I love the flick, and if you dig werewolves, watch for many in-jokes for us fans, and tips of the hat to what has gone before in the genre. This DVD also offers a marvelous smorgasboard of behind the scenes features that, to me, improved upon my enjoyment of a film that I already thoroughly enjoy.

If you're looking for an high-end werewolf film and expect to be blown away by big budget production values, you may be better served by checking out one of the other movies I mentioned earlier, but if you love horror films for being horror films, and want to see a genuinely creepy, atmospheric spin on the lycanthropic side of the genre, I'm of the opinion that you won't be disappointed in ""The Howling"".

1614363,1,B00005K3NW,"I usually really enjoy werewolf movies. Werewolf movies never scared me, but I always enjoyed them for the action, hummor, or premise. My favorites have to be Ginger Snaps, American Werewolf in London, and the Underworld series. But oddly I was actually really bored throughout this entire movie. It wasn't until the end that some action happened and even it lasted for only a few minutes. 100 scariest movie moments of all time actually had this in the top 40 scariest and I say BS. I prefer American werewolf in London over this because at least it had more happening and I liked the story better too.

 The ending of this movie turned me off by alot with that werepoodle. It was cute, but so stupid and out of place. I've actually been reading the book lately (bought it off Amazon)and I can't help but wonder why the makers of this movie didn't stick with the original book ending. If they would have stuck with it The Howling would have had much better sequals that are actually related to the first movie. There are 2 sequals to the book and they sound extrremely good. It just baffles me. Reading the book I realized that the movie could have even started out darker too. I mean the book starts out with the reporter literally getting raped after getting married. Plus it would have had been even more original because the werewolves would have just been 4 legged wild wolves instead of Wild E.

1614364,4,B00005K3NW,"If you like werewolf movies, The Howling (1981) is worth watching. You'll either you'll like this 91 minute movie and think it's scary, or you won't like it and think it's boring and laughable. Myself, I give it 3 3/4 stars, rounded up to 4.

The best scene in the movie is when Bill (Christopher Stone) and Marsha (Elisabeth Brooks) do it by the campfire under the full moon and transform into werewolves. I don't mind the animated ""cartoon"" werewolf that howls at the moon at the end of the scene. I think it's cool and old school.

The screenplay is solid. I think one of the strengths of this movie is the story. It's not a mindless, shallow movie about werewolves. Instead, the movie has a solid story. The movie takes a long time to gain momentum. It is somewhat boring for the first hour. Then after one hour the action starts to pick up and you'll start to see some werewolf action. The ending of the movie has the most action, although a lot of it is predictable. The movie has a little humor in it. The movie is also a little bit cheesy at times. The werewolf transformations are cool, and overall the special effects are pretty good by today's standards. The acting is pretty good. The musical score by Pino Donaggio (Carrie, Dressed To Kill) was a little weak. The music doesn't seem to fit certain scenes. Sometimes it sounds like haunted castle music, other times you'll hear music that sounds like it came from something like Little House On The Prairie. At the 59 minute mark you'll know what I'm talking about.

This movie isn't about just one werewolf. It features several werewolves. I don't want to give away too much. Watch the movie to find out.

The ending of the movie? I don't know what to make of it. It's supposed to be shocking and scary, but for me it is more laughable and light-hearted. Why? It's because when Karen (Dee Wallace) transforms into a werewolf she looks like a cute little stuffed animal rather than a scary looking werewolf. My rating of the movie took a hit because of this scene alone. It's a silly looking werewolf.

Overall, a pretty good werewolf movie.",1275177600,,2103,4.523684210526316

To add to the suspense, the killer has gone missing, and files from the retreat prove that he once lived in the same village she now finds herself in. THE HOWLING offers a unique plot line, interesting characters, an extremely creepy atmosphere set by a foreboding forest and fog effects, ground-breaking special effects, and pissed off werewolves. This isn't your daddy's Wolfman; the creatures in this film shred their victims with razor claws and teeth on screen, rather than choking them or alluding to the action off camera. The use of bladders and an array of other brand new effects are implored to create one of the first physical on screen transformations with few cuts, lending credibility to both the makeup and the effectiveness of the creatures. From start to finish, the film is dark and pessimistic, never offering a moment of relief to any of the characters. This succeeds in maintaining the sinister mood, but also makes it more difficult to relate to the protagonists, who are constantly in a state of fear, dread, or panic. It sets itself apart from any other werewolf film before or since, and though I prefer Landis' AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON, this is a staple genre film and a must-see for any horror fan!

To say the least this movie proves great nastalgia for me and reminds me of not only a superior GOLDEN AGE of movies but what was greatly possible effects and storytelling wise in the pre-digital age.

However, there is a great time to be had with The Howling.

Karen White, a TV newscaster, is on the edge of catching a serial killer named Eddie. She is told to meet Eddie at a local adult shop. She arrives at the shop and enters a theater booth. In the booth, she is assaulted by Eddie. Karen narrowly escapes due to the police arriving just in time. Eddie is shot and assumed dead. Karen is traumatized by the event and has breakdowns just thinking of what happened in the booth. Her doctor suggests taking time off at a secluded retreat known as ""The Colony."" ""The Colony"" is not what it appears to be though. Many hairy secrets are hidden underneath the anomalous characters living in ""The Colony.""

I doubt I am going to spoil the story for anyone when I say that Werewolves are the huge secret. Karen Shaub, a fellow reviewer, asked me not to use the word cheesy in my reviews anymore, so I will try to use other words to describe these furry beasts. The Werewolves epitomize the archetypal 80s style monster. Clearly, you cannot expect&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Underworld/dp/B0001WTUH6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Underworld</a>&nbsp;type visuals from this 80s classic. The Werewolves are frequently men in imaginative Werewolf costumes. The transformations, while detailed, lasted far too long and came off as ridiculous. The Werewolves might have been good for their time, but are nothing compared to some of today's CG marvels.

The acting in this movie is decent. Sometimes you will deal with overacting or under acting. At one point, Karen's best friend is killed. Karen sits in sorrow for less than a second and continues what she is doing. Music works to perfection. Suspense is created with the sound track. Even those who are not usually afraid of 80s horror will find themselves jumping every now and then.

This DVD is a dual-sided disk packed with extras. On the side with the film, you can listen to a commentary track with the director and others. The other side of the disk is jam packed with good extras. There are many making of features. There are also deleted scenes and outtakes. There are trailers and a photo gallery. This pulls The Howling up to a four-star rating. Pick this one up to satisfy you 80s horror craving.",1223856000,,2620,4.880898876404494
1614407,5,B00005K3NW,This movie kept me from sleeping when I saw it as a kid. I still love it today. It is a little dated but the werewolfs and the story are still great even today!,1208390400,,160,3.735294117647059
1614408,4,B00005K3NW,"After viewing this film, did you ever wonder ""What kind of lycanthrope should i become in a full moon night"", the werewolf version of myself? I don't know about me, but i'm pretty sure my boyfriend should look like a mutant giant Saint-Bernard drooling all over the place, or maybe my little baby nephew should look like a cute little yorkshire terrier with a little pink lace. Now, how can those ""deep"" thoughts emerge out of this creepy, menacing, visceral, thrilling over the top horror clasic? Out of  the genre-defining movie that changed not only the looks and feels of the werewolf physical nature forever, but the very escence of the mythology in this lycanthropy movie culture?

The answer is simple: Self-awareness. The old stereotype of the werewolf as a lonely creature holding a cursed soul but a good heart, desperatly escaping is own terrible fate and evading the deadly moonlights, is gone. In this movie, werewolves are presented for the first time as an organized clan of self-aware vicious and evil creatures, hidding behind their HUMAN day forms, and not the other way around. See? That is a big achievement in horror morphing-creature films, and a big ""breakthrough"" vision for the new 80's more extreme and bloody industry.

On the other half,  the ""wolf man"" seems light-years away from this groundbreaking Epic in terms of creature evolution and special effects design: Say goodbye to the classic human disguised in make-up, with hair, nose and teet, and say hello to the new giant mutant wolves walking in two legs, and the consequent animatronic and visionary special effects features. The gruesome design of humanoid wolves instead of hairy humans was the major contribution of this film for the horror aesthetics industry till today. Check the first creepy ""realistic"" transformation ever filmed. Yes sir!

On top of that, put some nudity and some adult situations and you get the new standard for raw and gory horror films for the newborn decade of the 80's. I guess Joe Dante never imagined that back in 1981, he designed and invented the new werewolf culture for times to come.

Of course i won't talk about the creepy, atmospheric, twist-and-turn  and incredibly tense story. I can't tell you that but this i can tell you: This is history in horror filmaking, the bible in werewolf films. Of course there's my beloved ""American werewolf in london"", a classic ""cursed soul"" type but incredibly funny, with the zombie-friend and victims haunting the poor guy, the incredible ""hound out of hell"" monster, the painfully detailed transformation, and the touching love story. This is completely different in every aspect, but somehow people tent to compare them, big mistake.

Enjoy this wonderful DVD edition with the remastered full-lenght theatrical version, with great sound and picture, full-packed with extras and all the information available, including interviews, trailers and documentaries. The most important of course, the special effects and creature design feature. A real piece of work.

Seeing little red riding hood and the gypsy in Lon Chaneys ""the Wolfman""footage  along with Dee Wallace as the newsanchor turning into a cute werewolf then getting shot and switching quickly to a closeup of dogfood in a commercial were pretty cool!

1614433,4,B00005K3NW,"The early 1980s saw a revival of the werewolf genre in horror films.  Along with such films as ""Wolfen"" and the classic ""American Werewolf in London"", ""The Howling"" returned the werewolf to the forefront of American horror cinema.

This movie stars Dee Wallace as television news anchor Karen White.  Karen has been tracking serial killer Eddie Quist (Robert Picardo) and she hopes to catch him on live television.  She agrees to meet Eddie in a local adult book store.  Once there, Karen finds out that he's more than meets the eye.  Karen momentarily loses her memory, and two of the local police have come and filled Eddie with bullets.  Suffering from psychological trauma and flashbacks, Karen, on the advice of Dr. Waggner (Patrick Macnee), agrees to go to the doctor's ""Colony""; a ""retreat"" in the California woods for patients who need to ""unwind"".  Karen's husband Bill (Christopher Stone) accompanies her on the trip.

After arriving at the retreat, Karen and Bill begin to realize that things aren't entirely normal.  Everyone seems friendly at first, but strange things begin to happen.  There is strange howling noises coming from the woods at night.  And Marsha, the camp's resident nympho, has her sights set on Bill.

Meanwhile, Chris and Terry, Karen's friends from the television station, are continuing the investigation of Eddie Quist.  Upon visiting the morgue, the two have found out that Eddie's body is missing.  Chris and Terry's search leads them into the world of werewolves, and, after receiving a frantic call from Karen, realize that the ""Colony"" may actually be a colony of werewolves.  Can Chris and Terry arrive in time to save Karen, or will the werewolves get her first?

This is a pretty scary movie.  What makes this movie so exciting and scary is the awesome special effects.  The werewolf transformations are definitely the highlight of the film.  The ending will leave the viewer wondering if they should ever watch the nightly news again.

I recommend this movie to horror fans.  I've been a fan of horror movies for years, and I especially enjoy movies about werewolves.  Although I consider Lon Chaney Jr's classic 1941 film ""The Wolfman"" to be the best, this movie is still very good and it has some very scary scenes.  Horror movie fans will definitely enjoy this movie.",1192147200,,2315,4.953246753246753
1614434,5,B00005K3NW,"L.A. reporter Karen White (Dee Wallace Stone) was assulted by a criminal named Eddie Quist (Robert Picardo) in a porn store, she decides to get away for a while in the countryside with her husband Neil (Christopher Stone) to a place called ""The Colony"", where it's a secluded resort area owned by author Dr. George Wagner (Patrick Macnee). Yet, strange things are happening there including howls done by wolves to mysterious muders.

An excellent 1981 horror thriller from director Joe Dante who later thrilled us with ""Gremlins"" and one of the greatest werewolf films in history. This dark story is based on a novel as it's quite a nice adaptation of it. This does some some clever funny wolf in-jokes to it with great characterizations and excellent special effects from Rob Bottin, it's also a nice take on lycanthropy legends as these shapeshifting beings don't require the full moon like traditional werewolves but that's what i like about this movie as Dick Miller's character says ""The movies are just hollywood, the classic werewolves can change by day"". The film co-stars John Cariddean and Slim Pickens with appearance by Dick Miller, this is one of my favorite horror films since i was 5 when i saw it on video. It became a success in 1981 as it with American Werewolf in London made werewolves popular again thanks to their uniqueness.

1614438,4,B00005K3NW,"I love Horror films. When talking about the many sub-genres involved and the low percentage of quality horror films, some films stand out as merely ""important"" rather than achieve a level of greatness (Last House on the Left, Friday the 13th). The Howling is such a film.

When looking at the great werewolf films out there and considering the times they were released, the original Wolfman stands next to An American Werewolf in London as perhaps the greatest Werewolf films of there respective times. The Howling may very well be a challenge to the latter of these two films as the best of it's time. Both were released in 1981, but the Howling was developed before the Landis project. It doesn't really matter, as I do believe An American Werewolf in London to be better film but the Howling is an important film along with being entertaining. Neil Jordon's In the Company of Wolves came out a few years later and is my personal favorite of any in this sub-genre but all that aside, The Howling is a true horror classic and a werewolf movie fan's treasure. It is a must have of hardcore horror fans because it contains and helped identify the many traits we've seen before and after it.

The Howling starts off in a similar vein to that of the original Dawn of the Dead, putting the idea of a werewolf into the mainstream media (disguised as a serial killer) and it ends on a similar note. This allows us to sort of picture this mythical creature on scale with today's society, or at least that of 1981. It's dated and it's thrown right on TV so we can all feel connected. The film is handled as a kind of film noir at first and slowly brings itself from that and into the werewolf sub-genre in fairly atypical fashion. The acting is really only good by it's main protagonist, whose name escapes me. It also has it's share of character actors who we've enjoyed in these kinds of films before. The Howling isn't afraid to laugh at itself either, which I think is almost a must in horror films...it interesting how almost all other notable werewolf movies (i.e. Dog Soldiers, An American Werewolf in London) also make us laugh. This helped me in some respect to look past a lot of the dated special effects and to laugh at them. The film gets more microcosmic later on and sets itself up for some good scares and some eerie and outstanding howls in the night. Unfortunately, the film ends a bit too quickly, but the Howling remains almost as important as An American Werewolf in London for bringing this great myth back to the forefront of horror films again.",1178841600,,2560,4.550976138828633

Who cares about digital efects in a great high budget production, if the result is you taking off your seat. The howling was one of the first werewolf films that explores, along with ""american werewolf in london"", the subject of the transformation from regular guy to man-eating hellhound monster. It made a remarkable achievement in the use of short shots of different transforming parts of the body, attaching them into a full sequence of horrifying effects of latex and creepy sounds. The result was one of the most terrifying transformations, and revolutionary werewolf designs, according to the experience and personality of each character (see the final sequence, a very touching piece of work).

Cast:  Dee Wallace Stone, Patrick Macnee, Dennis Dugan, Christopher Stone, Belinda Balaski, Kevin McCarthy, John Carradine, Slim Pickens, Elizabeth Brooks, Robert Picardo.

Running Time:  91 minutes

Rated R for violence, gore, nudity,and sexual situations.

Director Joe Dante's (""Gremlins, ""Piranha"") infamous cult horror movie was released just a matter of months before ""An American Werewolf in London"", and both are generally regarded as being the most memorable werewolf movies ever made.  Karen White (Dee Wallace Stone in a fine performance), a television reporter, is lured into a trap by a psychopath which involves her going into a sex shop, being made to watch a violent porno and then witnessing the man changing into some kind of monster. She is left emotionally-scarred by all this, in a very Hitchcock-ian way, and so a respected psychologist suggests she spend some time as his secluded retreat called ""The Colony"". As it turns out, the colony is the last place on Earth she wants to be, and both Karen and her husband (Christopher Stone) becoming increasingly unnerved by it's occupants and the strange creatures that seem to stalk through the woods at night.  ""The Colony's"" eerieness is highlighted by cabin neighbor Marsha (Elizabeth Brooks) and her creepy cannibal brother, T.C. (Don McLeod). Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Karen's coworkers, Chris (Dennis Dugan) and Terry (Belinda Balaski) are on their own scavenger hunt, investigating deeper into the bizarre and creepy persona of Eddie Quist, leading to a discovery of why The Colony residents are so suspicious.

In the age of animatronics and latex handywork, Rick Baker and his special effects team provide the awesome visual wizardry that make this (and many horror movies of the 1980's) so fantastic.  With Joe Dante directing, expect to see a lot of Dante cast regulars, including Robert Picardo as Eddie Quist and big screen horror favorite, Dick Miller (who is nearly always cast by Dante and is paired up with Picardo again in the Dante horror comedy, ""The Burb's"" as the garbagemen). While ""American Werewolf in London"" is most known for it's terrific special effects sequences, it is not the best werewolf movie of the 80's simply because the story isn't all that entertaining (and often becomes too long) because it's too simple (two hikers get lost in England, one killed by a werewolf, and the dead friend floats around in purgatory trying to warn his friend that he, too, is now a werewolf since he was bitten by the same creature). The fact that ""The Howling"" offers a more entertaining story and characters (and the wacky soundtrack) that will really leave you with a disturbing feeling (what is it about these weirdos at The Colony and what does it all have to do with Eddie Quist).  This is quite a different werewolf tale as well, though it has elements of the old 50s horror movies (like old, wise locals warning people newcomers to beware of something evil about the town). But, for the most part, it is an original, entertaining story, with super special effects and solid direction from one of the masters of the comedy horror genre.",1135814400,,3155,5.022988505747127
1614478,4,B00005K3NW,"When I was in second and third grade, I was OBSESSED with werewolves.  I loved ""The Wolf Man"" when I watched it, and when I finally saw ""An American Werewolf in London"" in fourth grade, it became one of my favorite films.  There was only one werewolf movie I'd never seen: ""The Howling"".

I could have watched it, mind you.  But I put it off.  Because although I am fascinated with the werewolf legend, it just so happens that the animal I fear the most ... is wolves.  I thought ""The Howling"" looked extremely scary, so I put off watching - until this Halloween, when I received it for a gift.  So, at last, I sat down and watched the last major werewolf film I needed to see.

The film stars Dee Wallace as a popular Los Angeles newswoman who is involved in a near-fatal incident with a serial killer (Robert Picardo).  A respected psychiatrist (Robert Macnee) sends her to a rehabilition center called ""The Colony"", located in the Californian forest.  Wallace believes there's something weird about the place as soon as she arrives - but once she begins to hear the howling, she believes there may be something deadly lurking in the forest ...

The only Joe Dante films I'd seen before watching this were ""Gremlins"" and ""Gremlins 2: The New Batch"", both of which I enjoyed very much.  Dante directs this film with an obvious love of the genre and of the classic horror films.  It really enhances the movie.  The cast is good, but the only two performances which really stuck out to me were that of Patrick Macnee and particularly John Carradine.  I thought it would've been nice to see Carradine's part expanded.  I also thought it was good to see Dick Miller, though I couldn't place what else I'd seen him in at first.

I thought that half of the time, Pino Donaggio's soundtrack was good, and the other half of the time I thought they made the film seem hokey.  I loved the film's ending tune, though.

The highlight of the film is undisputedly the spectacular special effects by Rob Bottin.  The scene where Robert Picardo transforms into a werewolf has been rivaled only by the transformation in ""An American Werewolf in London"", and ""The Howling""'s transformation may be even better.  The effects really made the film for me.

The film's script was nothing really original, and the movie was at times quite cliched.  But that's part of the fun of it.  All in all, ""The Howling"" was not as scary as I expected it to be, but I enjoyed it very much and would gladly watch it again, if only for the special effects.  Werewolf afficianados and horror movie lovers will have a howlin' good time.",1131148800,,2598,4.559395248380129
1614479,5,B00005K3NW,"If John Landis's ""American Werewolf in London"" is the funniest werewolf film, and Mike Wadleigh's ""Wolfen"" is the grimmest, then Joe Dante's twisted and gruesome ""The Howling"" is by far the sleaziest---and when I say sleazy, I mean that in the nicest possible way.

""The Howling"" is about investigative news anchorwoman Karen White(played competently though underwhelmingly by Dee Wallace-Stone), who in the course of investigating a notoriously brutal serial killer (she arranges to meet him in a screening booth of a porn shop, no less!), nearly becomes one of her erstwhile subject's 'works of art'.

The traumatized White follows the advice of celebrity Dr. Wagner(veteran actor Patrick Macnee, who brings aplomb and class to the proceedings), and takes a sabbatical to the Good Doctor's health-spa resort and retreat in the Northern California mountains with her husband Bill (played by real-life husband Christopher Stone).

This seems a welcome reprieve from White's high-pressure career, particularly as the most troubling element of our heroine's recollections concern what she thinks she saw of the Killer in the dim and flickering light of the porno booth: a bestial, glittery eyed, fanged creature.

White takes Dr. Wagner's advice, packs herself and husband Bill off to ""The Colony"", and begins a roaringly good excursion with all the amenities of a high-end health spa, such as mud baths, morning exercises, yoga, meditation, and of course---flesh-eating and howling at the full moon.

In the process, you're treated to some pretty raucous bloodletting, a densely creepy and deliciously terrifying atmosphere, exquisite werewolf effects by Rob Bottin (a Rick Baker disciple who later produced the goopey effects for ""The Thing""), and gratuitous Kevin McCarthy and Slim Pickens.

Beneath its sleazy and nihilistic modernist elements, Joe Dante's ""The Howling"" is stoutly traditional, drawing on all the elements from the classic werewolf films: fog-shrouded forests, lycanthropic legendry, a lady in peril, and the voracious appetite of the transformed Beast. Dante has conjured real terror here.

As for the Special Edition, ""The Howling"" has never looked better, and the 5.1 remastered soundtrack will have you glancing over your shoulder for red eyes in the darkness. The DVD is stuffed with special features, including mercifully deleted scenes, amusing outtakes, bloopers, and interesting commentary from Dante, Wallace-Stone, and John Sayles. You get a Making Of documentary, a promotional featurette, and much more---certainly enough to sate the hungriest Wolf-in-Man's-Clothing.

Some have criticized the characters in ""The Howling"" for behaving unrealistically: standing rooted to the spot while the werewolves transform, rather than running for the hills. But for me, that simply adds to Dante's dream-like film. In the realm of Dream, of course, when the Dark Deadly Thing comes calling, out of your closet or beneath your bed or through the window, you can't run.

You remain frozen with terror, scream stifled in your throat, while the Thing's teeth tear free from bleeding, ulcerated lips, as talons distend from its twisted, bloated fingers, as tufts of hair writhe across its body and its spine grows long and twisted. You stand transfixed as it hunches, and begins its low, throaty, rumbling growl. While it prepares to spring...

1614482,5,B00005K3NW,"PLOT: The film opens in California. A recent occurrence of grisly murders has gotten the attention of the police. Famed newscaster Karen White (Dee Wallace Stone) has agreed to assist the police in a sting operation in order to find the killer. The biggest lead they have come up with is a mysterious man named Eddie (Robert Picardo). Following a phone call, Karen agrees to meet Eddie in a film booth at a porno shop. Karen goes (followed by the police.) Karen meets Eddie in the booth and suddenly a scream is heard which sends the police racing into the shop and firing at the booth. Eddie is killed from the bullet wounds instantly. Karen is left in such traumatic shock that she can't remember what she saw. She starts having strange nightmares and is forced to take a break from her anchor job. Karen's reporter friends, Terry Fisher and Chris (Belinda Balaski and Dennis Dugan) find the apartment of Eddie. It is filled with strange objects and realistic but strange drawings of people covered in hair. ""The kid had talent,"" remarks Chris. By looking at the signature on the drawings, they discover that Eddie's last name was Quist. Karen later visits the psychiatrist Dr. George Waggner (Patrick MacNee). He is affiliated with Karen's news station and recommends that Karen go to his clinic in upstate California called ""The Colony"", in order to relieve some stress. Karen is accompanied by her husband R. William (Bill) Neill (real-life husband Christopher Stone). The other people at the colony are really weird, especially the eccentric yet sexy nymphomaniac Marsha (Elisabeth Brooks). At night, Karen awakes in her cabin to hear strange howling sounds from outside in the wilderness. By the time Bill wakes up, the sound has stopped. Terry and Chris later go to the county morgue to see Eddie's body, in an attempt to get some information for an upcoming TV special they are working on. When the morgue attendant (screen-writer John Sayles) opens the compartment door, he sees that the body is gone. There are also claw marks on the inside of the door. ""You don't suppose someone could have stolen him, do you?,"" asks Chris. The attendant replies, ""Well he didn't get up and walk out on his own."" Karen is still having her nightmares and she still can't remember what happened in the porno shop. She has trouble fitting in with the people at the colony, but Bill starts to fit in right away and he constantly finds himself drawn towards Marsha. One night, on the way back to the cabin, Bill is suddenly attacked and bitten by some sort of wild animal. Before he can see what it is, it's gone. He is immediately treated by Dr. Waggner for rabies.  Not too long after this, Karen realizes that she is in a place where no one is who they seem to be.

COMMENTS: Joe Dante's The Howling is a delightful film and easily one of the Top 5 best werewolf films of all time. It is based on Gary Brandner's1977 novel of the same name. It is not a faithful adaptation however. Dante and the other filmmakers wanted to make an homage for other werewolf films and they used Brandner's novel as the base. Many people have claimed that this is one of the few times when the movie is better than the book. The filmmakers decided to base the werewolves on original legends: they would look like large wolves standing on two legs, they can only be killed by silver or fire, if they aren't killed properly then they will regenerate, and they can change at will and don't have to wait for the full moon. Many of the character names have been changed to the names of directors of werewolf films. Many other references are made, such as Terry and Chris watching the Wolf Man on TV, Bill's reference to radio DJ Wolfman Jack, a photo of a young Lon Chaney Jr. in Dr. Waggner's office, Chris is seen watching a cartoon with the big bad wolf while he has a copy of the book ""Howl"" on his desk, and the sheriff of the colony is seen eating a can of wolf chili. Rob Bottin's special effects for the transformation scenes are absolutely amazing and he was only 21 at the time. I think it looks better than some of the CGI crap that filmmakers use today. No more cheap lap dissolve tricks from films like ""The Wolf Man."" Rick Baker served as the special effects consultant on this film and afterwards he did the special effects on ""An American Werewolf in London"", which won him the very first Oscar for special makeup effects. The Howling franchise introduced us to sexy female werewolves and Elisabeth Brooks as Marsha was a fine example. This movie was also the first to show a ""werewolf sex scene"". Since this movie was such a big hit, Joe Dante later went on to direct movies such as ""Gremlins"", ""Innerspace"", ""The `Burbs"", and ""The Explorers."" Dee Wallace Stone went on to play the mother in ""E.T."" The Howling started a franchise and was followed by 6 inferior sequels: Howling II: Your Sister Is A Werewolf, Howling III: The Marsupials, Howling IV: The Original Nightmare, Howling V: The Rebirth, Howling VI: The Freaks, and Howling VII: New Moon Rising. Some were o.k. (Howling III), some were so bad that they were hysterical (Howling II) and one was so bad that it wasn't even funny (Howling VII). The original Howling is a timeless horror classic. I would recommend this film to anyone. The new special edition DVD is awesome. The picture and sound have been completely remastered and it can be viewed in full screen or the original widescreen theatrical ratio. It also features deleted scenes, outtakes, photo gallery, original theatrical trailers, commentary w/ Joe Dante, Dee Wallace Stone, Christopher Stone, and Robert Picardo, a 1981 documentary entitled ""Making A Monster Movie: Inside the Howling"", and a brand new documentary entitled ""Unleashing the Beast: Making the Howling.""

Rob Bottins effects are masterfull, hey the guy was only 21. No one has ever seen this stuff on the big screen, he is a legend and a pioneer in his field. The story tends to be a little slow but the director is only trying to build character relationships and a dark mood setting. We don't need werewolves from the start chomping on everthing, that is what a climax is for. If people can sit and actually get themselves indulged in this, it does deliver. Joe Dante's(director),hidden tributes to past werewolf films, including names, and visual effects, (wolf chili, wolf cartoon on T.V., etc.), is very complimenting to the genre. Alot of humor mixed with a soundtrack that is a bit over the top, but hey this is early 80's, no cgi, no digital remix, no overuse of bluescreen. Rick Baker,(fx-wiz), no doubt, used this film as a blueprint to his transformation scene in ""American werewolf In London"". Like anything, things get better and more elaborate with time, but this film does deliver, and does a wonder for the special effects industry to be created in future films. Rob Bottin is God.

The werewolves are also the coolest EVER! Standy uppy, giant werewolves have always been my favourites but they go even further that as the head, mouth, teeth and ears are all shaped as I imagined the ""perfect werewolf"" to be.

Though lacking the dry humour of AMIL, this is a stand out film in it's own right. the only reasons why it gets 4 instead of 5 stars is because of:

a) the dodgy animated love scene by the camp fire; and

b) the cute poodle that Dee Wallace becomes at the end. Apparently, it seems that the studio guessed we would have more sympathy if she looked somewhat cuddly.

These werewolves are bad arse! They shapeshift at any time - night or day - and can seriously f**k you up!

The coolest scene was when Eddie Quist (as werewolf) casually picks a file out of a nosey woman's hand, before gently placing it down and then giving her an almighty back hander...whilst roaring in that menacing, freaky way they all do.

Just watch it for the transformation scene of Eddie Quist alone.

1614518,4,B00005K3NW,"Updated Review: March 2015

Along with John Landis' ""An American Werewolf in London"", this early 80's horror film directed by Joe Dante, is in my opinion, one of the greatest werewolf movies ever made. It is most definitely one of the scariest despite not being too over-the-top gory. This movie scared the pants off me when I first saw it as a kid; now 30+ years later, the film still succeeds in raising a couple of hairs and giving me a few goose-pimples. This is largely due to the films bone-chilling atmosphere and hideous but effective make-up and the gruesome transformation scenes which retain their impact. It is even more remarkable considering none of this was achieved using CGI. Of course this is due to this film existing before CGI effects were a staple, but it needs to be said, especially when referencing horror films, when practical effects are done right, there is no need for it.

The film's plot centers around Karen White (Dee Wallace before she was Stone'd), a well known television news anchor who is being stalked by a psycho killer- Eddie Quist (Robert Picardo). She decides to help the local police in capturing him and agrees to meet with Eddie in a seedy porno theatre. The encounter leave poor Karen traumatized and on her kind Doctor's insistence, she along with her husband, Bill (Christopher Stone) go to a small forested community for some alone time and relaxation unaware that the friendly townspeople are not who they appear to be.

The film starts off well- with the anxious Karen setting herself up to become prey to an elusive killer and the atmosphere is surreal, gritty, with obnoxious characters (Karen excluded), a whole array of neon lights and a lot of mystery. When the story changes gear and setting it loses a bit of steam. However, once the film gets going, there's no stopping it. The film's main highlights are the bone-chilling transformation scenes; the main one involving the nefarious Eddie as the frightened Karen watches on. It is 2 and a half minutes of pure torture and creative genius. The sound effects are as chilling as the nasty visuals. There's nothing quite like the sound of pulsating skin and stretching flesh. There are also some great performances here. Dee Wallace is great as our tormented heroine, vulnerable, attractive yet tough while the supporting players fair just as well. Robert Picardo is bone-chilling as the lead monster. He is on screen only briefly but he makes the most of his limited screentime and his voice, low, seductive with a touch of evil, is perfectly suited for Eddie. The late Elisabeth Brooks (nope it's not Angelina Jolie) is equally compelling as the leather clad, voluptuous Marsha Quist and John Carradine, a man who appeared in many cult horror films of the time period, is his usual creepy, loony self.

For those of you wanting a good, scary, monster movie, ""The Howling"" will or should not disappoint. It has been several decades since its initial release, and in the age of CGI monsters in CGI settings, it remains fresh and genuinely scary. It may not be without its flaws but like every good horror fable, it remains chilling to the core.

There are several DVD versions available. I recommend Shout! Factory's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Howling-Collector-s-Edition-Blu-ray/dp/B00BNAE2AU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Howling (Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray</a>]. It includes numerous commentaries and a whole assortment of extra materials that are too many to list here. Despite the films age, the transfer is splendid. There are countless inferior sequels that followed and bear no relation to this story other than the werewolf theme. Many are awful - ""Howling 2"", ""Howling 7: New Moon Rising"" so watch at your own peril; the others may be worthy of your time if you do not mind campy, straight-to-video horror movies with the best being ""Howling 5: The Rebirth"".

1614519,2,B00005K3NW,"A fan of horror movies I loved the premise of ""The Howling"", what with the main character being the target of a Werewolf psychopathic killer, but as soon as they moved down to the country I lost interest alltogther. The only characters I liked were the main characters friends in the city, researching the Killer and finding out about werewolves. They were very cool and could take care of themselves quite well. Unfortunately they weren't in much of the movie (more towards the end). The middle dragged on and on (much like I am here, for emphasis of it's dragging) and arrived exactly where it could have been from the very start of the movie. The only saving thing was the incredible makeup effects, but even still, it looks like there were seven different concepts as to what he should look like as he changes, and they picked the best footage from all of them and meshed it into one sequence (His face changes constantly back and forth from looking wolfish, to just like a dead person). At least in the end we knew he HAD to turn into a werewolf or else everyone would be upset. Also, any movie that has the ending credits scroll over a cooking hamburger loses A LOT of points in my book. Great for cult fans, maddening for everyone else.",1097539200,,1243,4.504424778761062
1614520,5,B00005K3NW,"Karen White (E.T.'s Dee Wallace-Stone) is a TV news reporter who's become the object of serial killer Eddie Quist's psychotic obsession. One night, in a daring attempt to catch the killer on live television, Karen comes face to face with the beast inside him. A rookie cop comes to the rescue, and fills Eddie with lead before Karen can be physically harmed, but she's already the victim of psychological damage. Even the famous Dr. Waggner (Patrick Macnee) can't help Karen remember the face she saw that night, which has been locked away deep in her subconscious.  Finally, the concerned doctor suggests that  Karen and her husband, Bill, spend some time at his ""Colony,"" a retreat in the California woods for some of his patients who need to ""unwind."" When the two arrive there, however, they find the place is hardly a relaxing setting. Surrounded by strangers who just keep getting stranger, disturbing howls coming from the woods at night, and a sudden rash of animal mutilations, Karen is not having a restful stay. To make matters worse, the Colony's lovely resident nymphomaniac, Marsha, has designs on Karen's frustrated husband, Bill. Meanwhile, back in the city, Karen's friends and co-workers, Chris and Terry, are doing their best to discover the secrets of Eddie Quist, who they find has mysteriously disappeared from the city morgue. Their search leads them on a path of werewolves and the supernatural, and both will have to come to terms with what they believe if they are going to save their friend from the dangers that surround her before it is too late!

Only a few months before the legendary  ""An American Werewolf In London"" was released, Joe Dante gave us the OTHER best werewolf film ever made, the original ""The Howling."" Rather than the lone, cursed wolf-man figure, The Howling gives us a very different take on the genre, portraying werewolves as pack creatures much like the real-life animals they take their names from. Everything from alpha leaders, to challengers, to mating, hunting, and socializing is shown from the werewolf's point of view, giving us a much more realistically-based depiction. These tall and very impressive looking werewolves are also able to shape-shift whenever they choose, day or not, making them quite the formidable adversaries. But ""The Howling"" doesn't disregard the traditional Hollywood legends completely. It still takes silver bullets or fire to kill these werewolves, and  their condition is still spread as easily as a single bite. The Howling's effects are fantastic, only outshined by ""An American Werewolf In London,"" released that same year, and just as in that film, the material is handled with great love and respect. It's loaded with humor and cute and funny references to wolf and werewolf pop culture, from cartoons and illustrations, to a can of Wolf brand chili. There's no shortage of gore and horror either though, with some genuine scares for any lone, nighttime viewers. The cast is excellent, studded with camp and horror favorites like Dick Miller, Patrick Macnee, Dee Wallace-Stone, John Carradine, Kevin McCarthy, Christopher Stone, Slim Pickens, Dennis Dugan, and Roger Corman, among others. Elisabeth Brooks is breathtaking as the frighteningly seductive temptress, Marsha. Now, for many, the final scene (or rather, the next to final scene) in which we see a VERY different type of werewolf, tends to ""ruin"" the scary and impressive style of the rest of the film. Don't let this ruin it for you! According to Dee Wallace in a recent interview at thewerewolfcafe.com, this different look of the final werewolf was done to depict the character in question's unwillingness to submit to the evil transformation. Knowing that makes the whole thing much more acceptable (thanks, Dee)! Overall, ""The Howling"" adds up to one frighteningly good time that I highly recommend!

6 sequels followed ""The Howling,"" ALL of which have an awful reputation. I recommend checking them out and judging for yourself. They're all very different, and a couple might be rather enjoyable to you, but avoid the no-budget part 7 (New Moon Rising) at all costs.",1093996800,,4127,5.097633136094674

In this movie a werewolf changes whenever he takes a notion too.  Not only is this stupid, but it damages the pathos we would have for the monster(remember Lon Chaney Jr.?).

As to the beastly love-making..yeah.  What is this, Anne Rice?  For some reason, it worked in the 1992 Dracula but not here.  Oh, I know..vampires are supposed to be romantic.  There it is.

I picked up ""The Howling"" after all the hype it got as a cult classic, the same kind of hype the terrific ""Evil Dead"" got.  After watching the movie, I have to say, ""Evil Dead"" was much better.  In fact, ""Evil Dead"" is on a whole different level.  The plot of ""The Howling"" is hilariously bad (though some movies with bad plots are good i.e. ""Evil Dead"" and ""Night of the Living Dead"") and the plot is really the major weak point, along with a terribly under-developed script.  The special effects, while good (from effects master Rob Bottin) are few and far between.  The few seconds of cartoon animation only added to the hilarity of the sex/transformation scene.  The only reason I would ever recomend anyone to see this movie is so they could see the awsome transformation scene in the hospital.
I would recomend you see teh 1981 movie ""An American Werewolf in London"" or the 1940 movie ""Wolfman"" (starring Lon Chaney Jr.)  They are much better than this, which has only become a cult classic because the director, Joe Dante, and the star, B-movie heroine Dee Wallace-Stone.

1614523,5,B00005K3NW,"When ""The Howling"" appeared in theaters in 1981, it heralded a mini-revival of the werewolf movie that took advantage of advances in special effects; two films followed later that year: ""Wolfen"" and John Landis's beloved ""An American Werewolf in London."" Although ""The Howling"" doesn't quite match the artistry and continual popularity of Landis's film, it nonetheless has aged wonderfully and is still one of the most enjoyable horror films of its decade. It's scary without getting too gory for the average viewer, has superb special effects that don't overwhelm the story, features a fun cast of familiar faces, and has a quirky sense of humor and loads of movie in-jokes for horror movie fans.
MGM first released ""The Howling"" in a no-frills DVD that let the movie down: no extras, a cheap and scratchy transfer, and a very dull mono soundtrack. Thankfully, they realized the popularity of the film and are now giving us a nice edition with revamped sound (5.1 Surround), a sharp picture, and a big bowl full o' extras.
John Sayles's script (co-written with Terence H. Winkless) unapologetically drops the classic werewolf legend into the modern-day -- in this case, the world of television news and the fad of self-help psychology. News anchor Karen White (Dee Wallace-Stone), while on a special assignment to lure out a serial killer (Robert Picardo from ""Star Trek: Voyager"") in the city, is attacked by something bestial. On the advice of psychiatrist Dr. Waggner (Patrick Macnee), Karen and her husband (Christopher Stone) head to Waggner's clinical retreat in the woods. However, there's something very disturbing about the other patients in the colony, and those weird wolf howls at night won't stop...
The werewolf transformations supervised by Rob Bottin still have an amazing effect on viewers. Using air bladders, make-up, rubber, and pneumatics, Bottin was able to create a real-time transformation of a human into a nine-foot two-legged wolf. We see limbs snap, snouts grow, claws sprout, the whole deal, and it's damned incredible. (Amazingly, only six months later Rick Baker would do this movie one better with the transformation in ""An American Werewolf in London."")
The cast goes a long way to making the film work away from the effects. Dee Wallace provides the serious angle to the film, and is convincingly fragile. The rest of the actors add a wonderful loose humor: Slim Pickens, John Carradine, Belinda Balaski, and director Joe Dante's favorite actor, Dick Miller. The beautiful Elisabeth Brooks steals every scene she's in as a femme fatale who burns with sensuality, mystery, and one weird leather fetishist outfit. Director Joe Dante, who would go on to direct such wacky films as ""Gremlins"" and ""Looney Tunes: Back in Action,"" puts his nutty sense of humor all over the film and packs it with in-jokes.  The names of many of the characters are directors of werewolf movies, werewolf films and cartoons pop up on the televisions, and ""wolf"" items are scattered all over the place (Wolf Chili, a book by Thomas Wolfe, a reference to Wolfman Jack, a copy of the book ""Howl""...and so on).
The extras, most of which are on the flip side of the disc, are excellent. There's a feature-length commentary by Joe Dante, Dee Wallace, Christopher Stone, and Robert Picardo. Dante has plenty to say and is a very lively commentator, and this is a generally enjoyable audio track. ""Unleashing the Beast,"" a fifty-minute documentary (divided into separate parts, but you can play them all together) goes into great depth on the making of the film. It includes new interviews with Joe Dante, producer Mike Finnel, cinematographer John Hora, writer John Sayles, and actors Dee Wallace-Stone, Robert Picardo, Dick Miller, and Belinda Balaski. Conspicuously missing is effects wizard Rob Bottin, but you can see him on ""Making a Monster Movie,"" an eight-minute featurette that was made in 1981. It also contains vintage interviews with Joe Dante and Patrick Macnee. The extras also include two trailers, production photos, and deleted scenes and outtakes (some of which are very funny). But the really major extras for most people will be the new picture quality and the remixed 5.1 sound. If you're a purist, you can still listen to the original mono mix -- it's here too.
""The Howling"" makes most early 80s horror films, with brute slashers cutting down dumb teenagers at summer camps and slumber parties, look pretty awful. This is fun, funny, scary, smart -- and the effects will still make your jaw drop or maybe your fangs grow.",1088726400,,4548,5.047872340425532

(so the first one was a pretty decent werewolf movie but don't tell me that was superb acting and a little ridiculous- i was subjected to violent pornography so we can't make love. what?!) so if you're not already a fan of bad horror movies, i first suggest that you prepare yourself to view at best, a horror-comedy. anticipate the one-liners and nonsensical scenarios and the werewolf effects that amount to lots and lots of rubber and a guy in what looks like a bigfoot costume. embrace these elements and laugh. laugh heartily. the good thing about these movies is that the plot is never too asinine or to boring to lose interest, in fact they can be quite creative: a group of people stuck in a huge house thing to only find out there's a werewolf amongst them, marsupial werewolves! what more could you possible want? and let's not forget about unecessary sex (howling2) the main ingredient in the formula for a bad -i mean good- movie. in times when presented with movies of this ilk, i say turn a bad situation into a light one. buy all of the howlings and poke fun at them, then move on to the amityville sequels (especially no. 4). ^_~",1086739200,,1520,4.432142857142857
1614525,5,B00005K3NW,"I think that the Howling is a great classic horror film, in werewolf's movies. This movie is not the same as other ones(the Wolf Man), and it has really great special effects, when I bought it I saw it like 20 times, I've got really obsessed, cause a my dad recomended it to me, you're gonna love it.",1086393600,,300,4.189655172413793
1614526,2,B00005K3NW,"ok i didn't know anything about the movie when i bought the dvd so i guess it's my fault. horrible b-movie, but then again that's what it was meant to be.
there are a couple of good scenes here, especially the one of the werefolf attacking what's-her-name while she's on the phone, so it's not a complete waste of time. i guess it was more scary at the time and then again with such a small budget it's amazing anything was produced at all.
meanwhile i give this dvd an extra star becase of the commentary track featuring hilarious director joe dante with robert picardo, dee wallace and christopher stone along for the ride. dante's sense of humor is through the roof and he knows exactly what he's produced and he doesn't try to make it seem like shakespeare so kutos to him. the documentaries are a good lesson in how to make a movie for a couple hundred dollars and how to adapt a book into something completely and entirely different (the book plot was changed so much for the screenplay that it was reused again for the howling part iii apparently). finally the trailers are probably the best part of the entire production.
this is a nice dvd-9 from mgm, i.e. a two-sided disc with the film on one side of the dvd and most of the extras on the other. yellow smiley face included.",1080432000,,1285,4.4261603375527425
1614551,4,B00005K3NW,"Released back in the early 80's, The Howling (1981), directed by Joe Dante (a Roger Corman alum), competed against An American Werewolf in London (1981), and Wolfen (1981), for your werewolf movie going dollars.  In my opinion, An American Werewolf in London was/and is the one to beat, but that's not to say those other films weren't great fun.  Where An American Werewolf in London focused on an individual suffering from lycanthropy, The Howling deals with the more sinister notion that these creatures not only exist, but live among us, and gather together creating a sort of secret society, one that deals with the problems of how to best fit in, and maybe, one day, assume control.

Dee Wallace-Stone (then Dee Wallace) stars as Karen White, a TV newswoman who has formed a tenuous phone relationship with a man suspected of being a serial killer.  After a meeting with the suspected serial killer, known simply as Eddie gone wrong, Karen and her husband leave for a weeklong stay at a retreat run by Dr. George Waggner (Patrick Magee), sort of a commune on the coast of California.  While at the commune, strange things occur, and tensions between Karen and her husband escalate.  Karen's friends back in the city investigate the character of Eddie, and learn he may not just be a regular man, but something of a werewolf, a creature that can shape shift, regenerate lost limbs, even come back from the dead.

Some great supporting characters in the film include Slim Pickens, John Caradine, Kevin McCarthy, Dick Miller, and Robert Picardo.  The violence is more implied within the film, but there are a few choice gory bits, especially when one character does a brainectomy on himself.  Dante keeps things moving along nicely, even though the story is a bit on the light side.  The creature effects are really amazing, and hold up well, even today.  You could almost feel your skin crawl as the transformation took place.  And the creatures were huge, really giving a sense of helplessness among those unlucky enough to encounter them.

There are a slew of extras with this release, most on the flipside of the disc, of which are listed on the product page.  One in particular I wanted to mention is a little Easter egg that, when activated (look for the smiley face) has a nice piece with Dick Miller relating how he got started in the movie business.  Also, look for cameos by Roger Corman, the man who really gave Joe Dante his start in the business with Pirahna (1978), Forrest J. Ackerman, or Uncle Forry, the legendary creator of the magazine Famous Monsters of Filmland, writer/actor/director John Sayles, and Bill and Beverly Warren.  The print here looks really wonderful, and the audio is very decent.  It's really nice to see such treatment to these older horror films, especially ones that stood out among the pack.  This film was followed up by the forgettable sequels The Howling II (1985), The Marsupials:  The Howling III (1987), Howling IV:  The Original Nightmare (1988), The Howling V:  The Rebirth (1989), Howling VI:  The Freaks (1991), and Howling:  New Moon Rising (1995).  If you enjoy werewolf movies, I would recommend the Lon Chaney Jr./Universal wolf man films along with the more current Dog Soldiers (2002).

1614552,3,B00005K3NW,"I heard that this movie gives you nightmares-deluxe......I thought it was nowhere as intense or scarry and wonderful as Dog Soldiers, another werewolf movie but from about 2 years ago.

There are some cool scenes, and as most reviewers all ready gave the movie away, I san safely say that the scene in the doctors office, and right before it was kick as. The only gripe I have is not enough character development, and the werewolfs weren't only changing at night during full moon, but in broad daylight, with birds chirping and bees buzzing, they also looked like super tall rabbits, and the girl  at the very end, looked just like my persian cat, so I thought they were all very cute, but still bit nasty, I mean they did eat people.

Not bad, but not scarry in my oppinion, although I will watch it again one day, It did not scare the daylights out of me; but it was jumpy and fun horror to watch.
I think I enjoyed Howling 3 ( where the werewolfs go from looking like persian cats and rabbits to looking like cangaroos! Really!",1076284800,,1030,4.439153439153439
1614553,4,B00005K3NW,"THE HOWLING came out in April 1981 and featured the first ""on-camera"" werewolf transformation, beating AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON by about four months or so.
(Director John Landis had written AMERICAN WEREWOLF around 1969 and got Makeup Effects genius Rick Baker onboard, so he hit the roof when he found out Baker's protege, Rob Bottin, did the effects for THE HOWLING and ""stole his thunder,"" as Baker recalled in a interview).
Whether it was bad timing or shrewd marketing strategy, the two best modern werewolf movies both came out in 1981.
THE HOWLING is still a fun horror movie, winking at its drive-in movie roots while effectively mixing both horror and humor.
I enjoyed the extras but thought the documentaries repeated stories that were included in the commentary.  (I was also confused that the late Christopher Stone is present for the commentary--since this was a new DVD edition--but I've read that the commentary was recorded a few years back for a laser-disc edition).
Elizabeth Brooks, who plays the sexy but psycho nymphomaniac werewolf Marsha, has also passed away and I didn't see any mention of that.  Sometimes they talk about these things, sometimes they don't.
And I was a little disappointed that Director Joe Dante said several times, ""I wish I could remember more about this.""
But that all sounds like quibbling.  I ended up having more affection for THE HOWLING than I thought I would.  The interviews with Dante and screenwriter John Sayles are interesting for their approach to the material and I loved all the little cameos and stories about Roger Corman, Forrest J. Ackerman, etc.  I also loved the stop-motion footage that was discarded and the story about the flying werewolves that left smoky ""contrails.""

MGM managed to pack a very good amount of special features here (just like they did with their release of The Fog) and should please long time fans of this cult classic.

1614557,4,B00005K3NW,"(Updated for the Blu-ray edition 7/13)
Deftly combining social satire and horror, Joe Dante's The Howling remains a seminal and important film from the 80's. Unlike Steven Speilberg or Brian DePalma, Dante has managed to maintain his love of the genre and marry it to a modern sensibility. The screenplay by John Sayles captures the character quirks and clever plotting that would later appear in his own work as a writer and director. Sayles essentially junked the source novel keeping the key appeal of writer Gary Brandner's original work--a modern day Werewolf story. Sayles and Dante proceed to satirize the rising self help movement, sensationalism of tabloid television all the while paying homage to the Universal horror films the writer and director grew up watching as kids. Dante and Sayles fill the film with witty references to these old horror films via the names of the characters (almost every major character is named after a horror /werewolf film director) and clips (The Wolf Man and a couple of vintage cartoons and films crop up when you least suspect it) allowing a commentary within the film itself. It's self-reflective filmmaking at its best; it's witty and intelligent without falling into the art film school trap. It's clear that Dante and Sayles have a great love of old films.

SPOILERS:

Dee Wallace Stone plays Karen White a TV newscaster on to the most sensational story of her career; a serial killer (played by the marvelous Robert Picardo) who uses smiley faces as his trademark and has been terrorizing the city wants to meet with her to give her his side of the story. He feels that there's a special connection between them. He selects a porno shop in the seediest part of town. Whey they meet up face to face, he tells her that he has a special gift for her. He then begins to turn into a Werewolf. Her husband Bill (the late and under appreciated character actor Christopher Stone) is alarmed when the station loses contact with her through the wire they have her wearing. The police and her husband arrive in the nick of time to save her from Eddie the serial killer. Traumatized, Karen takes a sabbatical and, at the recommendation of someone else, visits a colony run by a TV psychologist guru George Waggner (the droll Patrick MacNee). She's blocked much of what happened with Eddie and continues to have emotional problems due to her encounter. Waggner suggests that he join her at the Colony where he works with patients in a group setting. She agrees as long as her husband will come along.

END OF SPOILERS:

Sporting the 2010 transfer (the same as the Studio Canal release from overseas), fans that have been barking at the moon for ages to get ""The Howling"" on Blu have gotten their wish but it hasn't changed into the big, bad monster that many were hoping for. It's a pity that Shout! Factory couldn't have asked for a new transfer to be done for the film.

""The Howling"" looks better than the previous DVD edition however there's evidence of noise reduction being applied unnecessarily with the darkest scenes fairing the worst. There's a lack of depth and detail in many of the night scenes and the skin textures are, at times, scrubbed to a waxy sheen.

Still, for all these drawbacks the film is till a marked improvement over the previous DVD.

The audio sounds marvelous for a vintage film with a nice 5.1 DTS lossless transfer. The remix for this 5.1 presentation is quite good. Audio is clear and there's nice activity in the surround speakers.

The special features have all been ported over from the MGM DVD edition.  We get the ""Unleashing The Beast"" documentary, ""Making of A Monster"" documentary, outtakes and a photo gallery.

What's new here is ""Horror's Hallowed Grounds-A Look At the Film's Locations"" which runs under 13 minutes taking us back to the locations hwere the film was shot. We also get a number of interviews including ""Howlings Eternal With Steven A. Lane"",  ""Cut to Shreds With Editor Mark Goldblatt"" and an Interview with Terence H. Winkless the other screenwriter (John Sayles is the other one)on the film.

While the HD transfer isn't ideal, it is an improvement over the DVD and the additional special features that Shout! included are quite good. Although it would have been nice to see ""The Howling"" transformed into a bigger and badder monster than the UK version, it looks decent in this edition.",1064016000,,4389,4.798675496688742

Howling is definately one of the best. Even with the clever story line in American Werewolf in London, Howling is the true werewolf movie. Aside from the awsome effects the movie kept close to the lore and even though the budget was low the quality was amazingly sharp for it's time. The effects top knotch and I still get shivers watching the transformation of Eddie. The dark mood does cover the effects flaws but also brings alot to the mood of the film. The only reason I don't give it a 5 out of 5 is because if your

1614594,3,B00005K3NW,"I saw ""The Howling"" for the first time the day after I watched ""An American Werewolf in London"" for the first time. Sadly, I do not feel that ""The Howling"" measures up in storytelling terms. Also, while the transforming special effects are impressive and on a par with ""Werewolf,"" other special effects really fall flat ... most notably a cartoonish silhouette of two wolves mating by a bonfire that is laughable. Also, when we do see the monsters in their full wolfen glory, they resemble nothing more than large Muppets.
The storyline here is also a bit fragmented and never really comes together.  I had too many questions left in my head after the film.  These are not the types of tantalizing questions that filmmakers will dangle before you and lead you to think about for years after (such as the scene in Vertigo when Kim Novak parks her car and stares out the window of a hotel, but then is said to have never been there) but rather such questions in ""The Howling"" are just the result of plot holes.  But the thrills and chills of the film do make it rather enjoyable.
Dee Wallace does the best she can, but she has such a quavering voice and unsteady manner the entire film that it can grate on ones nerves after awhile.  Christopher Stone as her husband (and real-life husband as well)is given very little to do and even vanishes for a while in the film.  More notable are the charismatic late actress Elisabeth Brooks as Marsha Quist, the Colony's witchlike temptress and Belinda Balaski as Terry, Wallace's best friend. Both of these women are very charismatic and add a lot to the film that helps it overcome some absurdities. The cinematography is also splendid, making the fog filled forest primeval look like something out of the darkest of fairytales.
This film is definitely worth a look, for all fans of werewolves or those just curious. ""The Howling"" is supremely entertaining despite its shortcomings.

A monster movie with lots of genuine chills and jumps, The Howling succeeds primarily due to its skillful balance of horror and humor.  Director Joe Dante is careful never to mock the material, but also knows when (and how far) to stick tongue in cheek and welcome the audience to delight in the story's cliches.  The entire cast is splendid, featuring numerous famous genre character actors including Slim Pickens, John Carradine and Dick Miller, and cameo appearances from the likes of low-budget director Roger Corman.  Numerous references to key figures in werewolf films are evident for long-time fans to enjoy, subtly enough placed that those with no particular interest in the horror genre won't even notice.

1614644,4,B00005K3NW,"This is an atmospheric and often scary horror flick, a classic in the werewolf genre. It stars the sweet voiced Dee Wallace as Karen White, a prominent television anchor woman. Contacted by  serial killer/rapist Eddie Quist, who has been butchering women, Karen agrees to meet him, hoping to out scoop her competition and end his reign of terror. When she does final get to meet him clandestinely, things do not go as expected and Karen is severely traumatized by their encounter and unable to recall what happened when they met or recall what Eddie looked like.
Needing to recover from her ordeal, she goes with her husband (Christopher Stone) to an idyllic rural retreat, called ""The Colony"", on the advice of a celebrity therapist(Patrick MacNee). There, she meets an odd assortment of characters, including the beautiful and sexy Marsha (Elizabeth Brooks), an obvious seductress who makes no bones about desiring Karen's husband. Venturing into the forest one night, he has a memorable encounter with the feral Marsha, an encounter that the viewer will also not forget. From then on, things do not look good for Karen, as her world seems to close in on her. Tormented by the unearthly shrieks and howls that emanate from the forest at night, Karen is a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown. When a fellow reporter and friend (Belinda Balaski) discovers that there is a connection between Eddie Quist and ""The Colony"", Karen is left to put all the pieces together. What she discovers will keep the viewer riveted to the screen. Look for a surprising ending.
This is a highly entertaining horror film with a number of scenes that are sure to unnerve the viewer. There are also some campy and laughable scenes, as well, but these do not detract from the overall impact of the film. It remains one of the best werewolf movies around. The special effects are very good and the film is well paced with enough action to go around. The scene in which Karen's friend discovers the real nature of ""The Colony"" is absolutely terrifying. The ending of the film is surprising and unique. It is a horror film not easily forgotten.

1614646,2,B00005K3NW,"Being such a huge fan of John Landis's entertaining horror/comedy AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON, I rented THE HOWLING (released around the same time as AAWIL) hoping that it would be just as good, maybe even better than what I was anticipating.  Unfortunately, I was once again suckered into believing the reviews of this movie, calling it ""The Best Horror Movie.""  THE HOWLING is far from it, an exercise of how bad you can screw up a seemingly good premise with poor pacing and a disjointed plot.
Dee Wallace stars as Karen White, a TV news reporter who at the beginning of the film is being used as bait to capture demented serial rapist Eddie Quist (Robert Picardo).  Karen meets up with Eddie, never seeing his face, but her brief encounter with him makes her traumatized.  Since her trauma is putting a strain on her life and marriage, therapist Patrick MacNee sends her to ""The Colony,"" a backwoods group therapy center which contains a host of patients including the sexy Marsha and a suicidal old man.  Needless to say, Karen, along with her two friends, discover something fishy going on and soon the blood and fur start to fly.
Although Eddie Quist's transformation into a werewolf towards the end of the film is truly amazing, and the funny moments involving a mortician and a librarian are short but sweet, there's not much else to say about THE HOWLING.  It's no small wonder why Dee Wallace has been starring in low-budget B-pictures ever since; she's a terrible actress.  Throughout all 90 minutes of this movie, I never believed once that Karen was in any kind of danger or threat.  Joe Dante is a good director, however, but his use of shocks and scares are predictable.  Plus, the scenes where Karen's husband Bill (played by Christopher Stone, Dee's real-life beau) gets bitten by Marsha, has sex with her the next night, and automatically turns into a wolf is utterly ridiculous.
THE HOWLING is, in short, a disappointment.",1005696000,,1945,4.782089552238806

Back then it was unlike anything that I had ever seen and this opinion still holds almost 20 years later. The Howling is one of the few movies made back in the early 80s that does not have a ""cheese factor."" The story is genuine as far as horror. I think that the most frightening part of the movie is how Karen White (played by Dee Wallace Stone)is so vulnerable. The special effects look very real in the werewolf transformation. If the Howling were made by today's technology it would be ruined by cheap looking computer generated effects.

Some of the most chilling moments result from the camera focusing on only shadows or only the eyes or feet of a werewolf. A frantic pace, a remote setting, and some incredible pre-CGI creature effects help make this a classic horror flick. I've tried (unsuccessfully) to endure each of the sequels, but have never made it more than a few minutes through any of those B-movie clunkers. Instead, I watch this favorite again and again. If you must watch a werewolf B-movie, stick with the horrible but amusing Bad Moon or Project Metalbeast. Better yet, watch the good werewolf flicks, like The Howling, An American Werewolf in London, An American Werewolf in Paris, Stephen King's Silver Bullet, and some of the earliest black and white ones. You might even try The Wolfen, which features a complex mythology of werewolves in the clever and scary book; though the movie just uses wolves with glowing eyes, it certainly isn't bad either.",1002067200,,1043,4.898305084745763

Suffice to say, along with ""An American Werewolf In London"" (which has its ""definitive"" DVD release this month, and it's not bad, though it could have included extra footage), this is THE pinnacle in werewolf transformation sequences (ah! the days before digital efx).  To put an early posts conundrum to rest: Dick Smith pioneered the ""airbag"" or ""bladder""  transformation with Rick Baker when Baker was signed to do ""The Howling.""  Baker created the designs for the werewolves eventual shape and size, and began work on the transformation sequences (pre-production) only to find that John Landis finally, after a long struggle, finally got the clout and funding to do ""An American Werewolf in London.""  Baker had pledged to do Landis's film since when they were in their early 20's and filming a little known movie called ""Shlock"" (which included one of Baker's first ape makeups).  Baker turned to his protegee, Rob Bottin, who he had been training since Bottin was about 15 or so.  Bottin was well versed in the Dick Smith designed bladder makeups (the bladder was usually a condom, tied off in different spots, with a small hose out one end and hooked up to either a syringe, a pneumatic ram, or a ""harmonica"" which the controller blew into to create a ""bubbling"" effect.  The bladder was covered with a prosthetic appliance or latex that blended to the actors skin, or could be designed as part of a full puppet prosthesis).  Bottin improved on the design and though Smith created it, Baker dropped it (it wasn't used for ""American Werewolf In London, which went in for ""change-o"" heads of David Naughton/wolf to achieve a smoother transition from a man to wolf's skull structure), Smith later used it in ""Altered States"" for scenes of William Hurt transforming from Dr. Jessup to primitive man... it became Bottin's signature, utilized in many of his outrageous makeups and monsters (""Twilight Zone: The Movie,"" ""The Thing"").
Having cleared that up... ""The Howling"" is a brilliant film with Joe Dante creating what amounts to a drive-in chiller with smarts (courtesy of Dante's tuteledge under Roger Corman, and John Sayles witty and knowledgeable script) and a keen sense of satire (""The Colony"" could easily be in Big Sur, as the Esalen institute is... get in touch with yourself, baby!) and absurdity... it plays with the genre in much the same way ""American Werewolf"" does, and it's hard to say which is the better film when they are both supurb examples of a time when filmmaking was more of a craft than a yet another pop-culture chore.
So, the DVD blows chunks, but the film is still a great date movie!  (""'Cause it's a Thrillah!"")",1001030400,,2711,4.876086956521739

About a year ago I got around to renting An American werewolf in Paris and although it was a cool movie the werewolves looked more like gorillas than  what they really supposed to be and the transformations happened so fast that I really didn't get to enjoy them.

1614781,3,B00005K3NW,"I haven't seen ""The other early 80's werewolf movie"" In about a decade, So I will make no more refrences to it, I Promise. This is a review for a 1981 movie, on a 2001 DVD, and in the case of most horror movies : Horror + Many Years = Not scary, bordering on pathetic. Nobody over the age of eight is going to be scared of this movie today (Accept maybe PETA), and tomorrow doesn't look good either.
  This is honestly, THE movie I've been waiting for on DVD since I bought my player, and I am somewhat disappointed by the MGM release. The picture quality is only so-so for DVD (Meaning it's better than original) blacks aren't super-black, colours aren't too vibrant, But for a low-budget twenty year old horror movie, I guess you can't expect a frame for frame restoration like 'Akira' or 'The Exorcist'.
  Audio quality isn't anything to write home to momma about either. The dialogue is clear, sound effects aren't too shabby, and the music isn't bad ('Untouchables ' was really bad). I don't remember who composed, but chances are some other reviewer did, and you can find out from their review.
  Special Features are nonexistant. You get a trailer and subtitles, Not even a commentary. I don't care who directed this, but he should have had a commentary track. And if the directors dead, then put the stars in the commentary. If the cast was eaten by werewolves during post production (It would have been horrific and ironic), then they could have got some guy off the street to do commentary. I like commentary, and this DVD seems to lack that basic feature. Also 'The Howling' will not let you be late for work tomorrow because you won't oversleep, because you will have no reason to stay up late watching featurettes. No Making-of's, storyboards, scripts, behind the scenes, free T-shirts, collectible ashtray's, or Lobby card's are included.
  As for the film: It's a B horror movie. It's not very good. It's probably closer to bad. But if it is bad, then it is so bad it's good. It seems to enjoy its early 80's gorehound campy horrificishness (I just made that up). The fact that THIS is the best werewolf movie to date (Maybe 'Wolf', I won't argue too much here) is saying something either about Hollywood, or werewolves in general. Hopefully it says something about Hollywood, because I happen to enjoy the werewolf mythos. Someday werewolves will have their opus, as zombies had their 'Day of the Dead', vampires had their 'Dracula', necrophiliacs had their 'Nekromantik' and mummies had 'The Mummy'. But this is not that opus, At least I hope it's not. This is really just a special effects slasher movie with dog hair. But I love it none the less, and I can't explain why.
  This movie was followed by a series of sequels that were either bad (6 and 7), worse (2 and 5), Really really really bad (3), or a quasi-remake of the first (4).",999820800,,2854,4.611439842209073

Patrick Macnee is the patriarch of these howlers, even though he is not one of them. They all live in an artist's colony up the coast of California - a Malibu for lycanthropes. Into this steamy setting arrives a TV reporter (Dee Wallace Stone, as she was then known) seeking to escape the pressures of her encounter with a werewolf. Her husband (Dee's real life husband, Christopher Stone) comes with her only to be snatched up by a vampy werewolf. The idyll ends with Dee being chased by the howlers. The highlight of this film is the ending when Dee returns to the TV station to report on the werewolves. I won't give away the ending, but will say she won't be reporting the news for awhile.
For its time, this film was first-rate, fresh and original. And I believe it still holds up its quality end like it was yesterday. This is enjoyable on all levels - humor, sexual encounters and scare. Ahead of its time and just right for now.",999043200,,1172,4.455813953488372

It is my favorite modern (post-1970) werewolf flick, with a fresh, intriguing script (co-written by John Sayles, another of my favorites), a healthy dose of eroticism, lots of cool ""stunt casting"", and generally excellent makeup effects. I say ""generally"" 'cause, admit it diehards, the first major transformation scene is drawn out way too long, spoiling the potential effectiveness of the admittedly awesome makeup. The second, shorter one is much more effective by comparison. I suppose at the time they just couldn't help showing off their new bladder technology, but I think the first transformation would benefit from some judicious editing. But that is my only major complaint in an otherwise scary, funny, sexy film. And you have to love John Carradine as a ""fundamentalist werewolf."" The DVD is typical of MGM Home Entertainment's budget DVD releases, containing only the widescreen print of the movie, trailer, chapter stops, and subtitles. But the print does look terrific; extremely clean, with vibrant color, rich blacks. I only noticed some occasional film grain (not the fault of the DVD transfer) and a handful of tiny flecks.

Joe Dante's best film is a superb entry into the werewolf genre, arriving one year before An American Werewolf in London. While much debate has raged over the years about who really pioneered the 'airbag' make-up process used for the transformation sequences (was it Rob Bottin or Rick Baker?), it nevertheless remains that The Howling delivered it first and, arguably, with as much success as John Landis' film. The werewolves here are actually achieved by three different processes; mostly it is animatronic/puppet work, with a few sequences achieved with animation (the campfire scene) and stop-motion (the escape scene).
More than a simple werewolf-on-the-loose, The Howling, based on Gary Brandner's inferior novel, deals with a whole (decidedly redneck) community of lycanthropes who are encountered by TV journalist Karen White. The werewolf colonists are presented with distinct personalities, particularly Elisabeth Brooks' intelligent and assuredly sexy Marsha and Robert Picardo's psychotic Eddie (sadly Brooks died of cancer in 1997), and the shock sequences involving them are executed with style. The two scenes where Belinda Balaski's character is attacked are truly superb, with some awesome make-up effects on display.
Dante's three regulars are all here - Kevin McCarthy, Robert Picardo, and Dick Miller playing his 'Walter Paisley' role for the third of five times.
This review is written before edition details of the DVD are available. I hope MGM do include something in the way of extras (beyond a trailer). Surely some material must exist of the make-up process that could be included.",995673600,,1622,5.46613545816733
1614787,3,B00005K3NW,"The Howling (Joe Dante, 1980)

Joe Dante has done some amazing work in his time. He's also done some godawful things for which he should be ashamed. The Howling falls dead in the center of those two. It's creepy, atmospheric, and effective, due in no small part to the incredible talent assembled behind the scenes (John Sayles adapted Gary Brandner's novel; Bottin produced; Dante directed). Unfortunately, it also shows exactly why Dee Wallace never made it past B movies, with the argualble exception of E.T., and disease-of-the-week TV flicks. I mean, she's just bad. The rest of the cast makes it work, though, including ""holographic doctor"" Robert Picardo in his big-screen debut as the serial killer obsessed with Dee. His line ""I'm going to give you a piece of my mind,"" and the action that follows it, are some of the finest moments in horror film.

As a sidelight, this was also the only major film in which the late Elisabeth Brooks appeared (as Marsha, the seductress who goes after Dee Wallace's husband). Brooks is worth seeking out in just about anything, but this is the only flick you're likely to find on rental-house shelves. (She actually made four; the other three were all late-eighties products that have unfortunately faded into obscurity.)

If you didn't see this when it came out, you'll probably find it somewhat on the cheesy side. Well, okay, it is, but remember that in 1980 this was groundbreaking stuff by anyone's standards. For those of us who did catch this one back in the day, it makes for a great nostalgia trip. Makes a great double bill with its contemporary Wolfen (1981).",995500800,,1613,4.836956521739131

1614811,5,B00005K3NW,"THE HOWLING is a rare original cult-movie, far from the reluctant werewolf pattern. The idea of werewolves instead of a single one hadn't been well developed before, as some legend variations. It has the legendary transformation scene with Rob Bottin's effects, stronger with Pino Donaggio's score (with no CD releasing yet). Rick Baker (Bottin's brother) was consultant and created later the Oscar winner effects of AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON, other historical movie.
Both movies are linked. Contemporaries, they represented a new era. There's no point discussing which one's the better. ""AWIL"" is more modern in a way, having non-sense humor, bloody scenes and unbelievable effects. THE HOWLING, earlier, has a classical movie profile, surprising plot and ending. Its characters were named after classical werewolf and horror movies directors, like George Waggner, Sam Newfield, R. William Neill, Erle Kenton, Lew Landers, Terry Fischer, Charlie Barton, Jerry Warren and Jack Molina. There are lots of ironies, like THE WOLF MAN quotations during the film and after credits, and the wolf cartoon in a tense scene. John Carradine, Roger Corman, John Sayles and Forrest J. Ackerman appear, giving additional charm. It's the first time more complex werewolves characters emerge, like Eddie (Robert Picardo, the scariest werewolf on movie history) and Marsha (Elisabeth Brooks, 1951-1997). Joe Dante made this classic with $1,6 million and used his own garage for the rated movies scene.
Lots of ideas were borrowed later (""the gift"" in WOLF). There were sequels non-related to the original, without the ""THE"" of the title. Most of them have nothing to do with each other. It's depressing to someone expecting a real sequel to watch HOWLING II.
Comparing to THE HOWLING, Brandner's book is different in many aspects, but both are unique. If you liked one, try the other, but don't get anxious finding total equivalence, some points of one aren't in the other and vice-versa.
Unfortunately, the movie had no lucky on TV. Its first release on VHS had a blueish image. Later, a brighter version came, yellowish, but allowing explicit sight of the effects and a better screen fitting. I can't tell which one has the original color or if none of them has. The MGM VHS release (August, 2000), after years of ""out of print"", is a very good presentation - no cuts, Hi-Fi Stereo. The only possible complaints are a few optical ghosts during the title presentation and a beautiful but not original cover. The light gets closer to the brighter version, with impressive color balancing. But I don't know if it's closer to the original.
Lucky are those who watched it in the theater, with original color and no lateral reductions. We'll have to hope for a DVD version in a letterbox format, with tone color and light fidelity to the cinema's. A special edition, maybe director's, would be wonderful: interviews, soundtrack, theatrical trailler/teasers and more.

This is simply oneof the best modern werewolf movies ever made.  A lot of people like American Werewolf in London, but The Howling far exceeds that one in terms of the film's entirety.  An American Werewolf in London seems ""choppy"", doesn't flow very well, and the acting is played down, relying mostly on werewolf transformation sequences and dark humor.
The Howling, on the other hand, really delivers in terms of completeness.  More ethereal and atmospheric than American Werewolf, The Howling is classic horror that makes a lot of connections from the beginning of the film and onward to the ending.  Even the cliches throughout the movie are necessary elements, which truly give it a firm place in the history of werewolf horror.
Long-haired Eddie, played by Robert Picardo of Star Trek Voyager, is a known serial killer who mutilates his victims.  Dee Wallace plays the news reporter who meets up with him in the beginning of the film in an adult store. She is monitored by her news crew for safety reasons, and their objective is to provide enough coverage to bring Eddie in to the police....
Along with a strong story, the sounds and effects work extremely well, and their integration into the film gives it a stronger sense of realism than American Werewolf in London. The transformation sequences (effects by Rob Bottin - The Thing [1980], Robocop [1989]), in particular, are highly effective with their slow, subtle changes that erupt into one of the most memorable werewolf creations in the genre.  The echoed, ethereal sounding ""howling"" effects even add to The Howling's overall mood, giving it a richness that is unsurpassed by American Werewolf.
With a good cast of actors, including Slim Pickens as the sheriff (Blazing Saddles, Dr. Strangelove), and good direction by Joe Dante, The Howling stands out as one of the gems of 1980's horror.

""American werewolf in London"" is the other one.
Both done in the 80s, then 20 years of nothing (sadly).
This century the best is ""Ginger Snaps"" and ""Dog Soldiers"".",1524268800,,195,4.6
7942673,5,B00005K3NW,"I have to say that this is a superb Blu-ray release of this Werewolf movie!! The quality of the transfer to HD is really good. It's better than anything that has come before and that includes the 2003 MGM DVD Release with those special features on it.

That is a good DVD Edition though and has 2 ""features"", if you will, that are NOT on this Blu-ray.
On the MGM DVD Edition, there are 2 Theatrical Trailers. The one that is on this Blu-ray edition and the ""RED BAND"" Theatrical Trailer.
The ""RED BAND"" Theatrical Trailer is NOT on this Blu-ray contrary to what the ""editorial"" says above. They obviously didn't view this new Blu-ray for the recent features.
The ""other"" feature is the ""Promotional"" materials for THE HOWLING. It is pictures/stills of the various materials and posters.
Other than that, all of them have been culled over to the Blu-ray and look fabulous for the most part, now.
Menu and background music is great, loved it.
There are quite a few ""actors"" in this movie that are well known, even in 1980. I really couldn't believe that Robert Picardo is one of the main Werewolves in this picture!! I have seen Star Trek: Voyager and he plays the holographic doctor. I also believe he was in 976-Evil and played the main nemesis on the phone.
The overall quality and sound are well done here.
I saw this movie originally on Cable TV after the Theatrical debut had ""run out"". It was great then and it is even better now with all these Special Features added. Makes for a great Werewolf movie and one of my all time faves in my Horror library.
Highly Recommended!!",1521417600,,1578,4.536842105263158
