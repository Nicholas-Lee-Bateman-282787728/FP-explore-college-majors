7887793,5,6305338787,"A truly brilliant basketball video, covering the 1988-89 Detroit Pistons quest to become NBA champions. The tape features great highlights on and off the court, as well as exclusive interviews and never before seen footage.
The Pistons were a great basketball team, often overlooked because of their physical play. All the stars are here - Thomas, Dumars, Johnson, Mahorn, Rodman, Aguirre and Laimbeer.
Unfortunately not much of a Finals series, with the Lakers losing Byron Scott and Magic Johnson to injuries during the Finals. However, the Pistons were worthy winners all the same.",976579200,3,584,5.290322580645161
