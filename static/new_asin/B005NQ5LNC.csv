4849161,1,B005NQ5LNC,"If you've played the video games, killing everything in sight, then you know that the levels pretty much stay empty.

And that's about where this series takes off. Nothing happens. Seriously. Nothing.

Oh, there's atmosphere--about as much as looking at the nice art CAN give. Stuff is happening SOMEwhere, but not on camera. To perfectly sum up what goes on, our hero is traveling with a totally clueless girl blathering on about nothing; a tiny monster appears out of nowhere and the hero kills it; the girl does not notice.

Completely forgettable and a chore to watch, especially if you have any kind of expectations for action--ACTION? Did SOMEone say action?

They must be playing the video games because this is a snore. ZZzzzzzzzzZzzzzZZZZzZz",1337472000,3,750,5.024193548387097
4849162,5,B005NQ5LNC,"This is one of the few series I really got into. A half-human, half-demon named Dante who goes around killing evil demons with the aid of two gun totting female demon hunters. The action is well done and the characters are well developed. I enjoyed the interaction between the two demon hunters and Dante, especially the one who used to be his side kick. I highly encourage anyone who likes this style of anime to get this series.",1332720000,7,430,4.5256410256410255
4849163,5,B005NQ5LNC,"This is a great action packed anime series, Dante a wisecracking tall hot white haired half human half demon who is addicted to and loves strawberry sundeas and lives on pizza modern day devil hunter who ironically hunts and kills demons. His weapons are his two guns Ebony and Ivory are always kept loaded and ready, a really cool long gothic looking sword Rebellion he carries on his back, and his amazing martial arts fighting skills is given strange cases to work on

In the first ep he is assigned to take care of and escort a young girl Patty the heiress to a fortune to the reading of the will and along the way she is hunted by demons that Dante protects her from. One part I think that people will like in ep 1 is while Dante is driving her to the will reading he pulls the girls hat down over her eyes then with his gun kills the demon that is about to kill her while it is holding on to the side of a moving truck without stopping his car I personally found that to be freaking awesome

Some of Dante's cases include a rich man who's daughter is being romanced by a handsome guy with powers and her father thinking he's a danger to her wants Dante to kill the guy, that tale has a very interesting little twist to it I don't want to give it away and spoil it for anyone

An ancient jeweled mask that grants wishes with a twist

The beautiful human singer who mysteriously disappeared some time ago and when one of her songs is played appears as a deadly demoness

A motorcycle racer racing another guy trying to evenge his brothers death a situation that has a freaky unexpected surprise in it

Later on it leads up to patty again unknowningly patty and her mother are part of a lower level demons plot to gain great power he is gathering various artifacts to perform a ritual in order to obtain his goal

If you love lots of action mixed with humor, and interesting characters like Lady a human female devil hunter who works with Dante and the one who also busts his chops at times. And later on Trish a gorgeous female demon and Dante's ex partner who controls and uses lightening. Morrison his agent the interaction between he and Dante is hilarious, and others. And has some of the most awesome music there is then this is for you, you will not be bored with this series, it is a full of amazing special effects, plots, action, and great characters from start to finish, this is one of the best anime investments I have ever made, I only wish they had made more episodes for the series the second I saw the first episode I was hooked on it",1328313600,19,2554,4.297297297297297

4849195,2,B005NQ5LNC,"This was such a waste of good material. The Devil May Cry game series seems perfect for the anime format but this was a botched attempt if I ever saw one:
*Dante is turned from a witty badass to a perpetually broke guy who loves strawberry sundaes.
*The long stylish action scenes were changed to quick boring ones.
*There are almost no references to anything in the games that the series is based on.
*Dante finally uses his Devil Trigger in the final episode (it's like a super form for those who don't know) nut you don't actually get to see it! All the viewer sees is a flash. I'm not joking.
*The main antagonist of the series is a joke.
*There is one episode I recall liking and laughing along with. That's one out of twelve people.

This is probably the worst anime I have ever seen even though I wouldn't call it bad just REALLY mediocre.",1480636800,,846,4.3544303797468356

4849244,5,B005NQ5LNC,"Fans of the Devil May Cry series will probably love this anime, which is canon and takes place between Devil May Cry 1 and Devil May Cry 4 in the series timeline. The only annoyance is one common with anime (and cartoon) adaptions of Video Games, the shoe-horned in character of Patty Lowell, a little girl that chooses to hang around Dante and nags him constantly, which, if you know Devil May Cry, isn't anything new for the character since Lady and Trish do the same thing, though not to the annoyance level of Patty due to not being children. Overall though the plot and episodes are great and feature that trademark Devil May Cry style.",1445385600,3,641,4.5344827586206895
4849245,5,B005NQ5LNC,"I gave this copy to a friend, but I love Devil May Cry. It gives you more of Devil May Cry 1 Dante. What Dante is more about and the jobs he takes as a Devil Hunter.  This takes place after Devil May Cry 1 just as a warning and adds in Devil May Cry 3 characters so if you don't know who Lady or Trish are and who they are to Dante it doesn't really hinder, but its nice to have more back story than that.  It would also be good for people who have not played the games.  It's a good starting point if you want to explore the series because it doesn't spoil the games and gives you a feel of how Devil May Cry works.",1441756800,,616,3.75968992248062

The anime is very cool, and you can get into it even if you have not played the game series it is based on.  My only beef is that he is not as cocky as he usually is in the games, and he does not Devil Trigger,....well on screen anyway.  Love the bonus features as well even if its now a bit old with the Devil May Cry 4 trailers, but still cool anyway.

4849252,4,B005NQ5LNC,"This anime is pretty awesome, both for fans of anime and of the Devil May Cry series.
That said, the audio is somewhat flawed, becoming much quieter and muffled whenever the camera isn't focused on the one speaking or the one they are talking to turns their attention elsewhere.",1431907200,,278,4.6938775510204085
4849253,4,B005NQ5LNC,"I absolutely adore the Devil May Cry series in all its hack and slash splendor. Before games like God of War and Bayonetta were making waves with intense action gameplay, Dante and his exploits were there to satisfy fans of fast and brutal action. However, one of the things that irked me about the games was that outside of the main narratives (which by no means were bad) they never really explored the world that Dante lived in in any meaningful capacity; I wanted to know more about Dante's day to day life and what other jobs he got up to when he wasn't saving the world. My prayers were answered in the form of the animated series, which do a great job of going inside the cocky demon-slayer we all know and love.

For starters, I just wanted to say hooray for Reuben Langdon for returning to voice Dante for the animated series. Considering that other returning characters are voiced by different actors (who still do a good job regardless) I was glad to see Mr. Langdon voice Dante because (in my mind anyway) his voice matches the character perfectly; seriously, part of the reason I couldn't get into the new DMC reboot was that the new guy just makes Dante sound like a total douche bag. Apart from the sound, however, the series is quite nice in terms of visuals. The fights never really reach that level of speed that the fights in the games do, but they're still nicely animated and Dante is just as fun to watch as he is to control. On a side note, Dante never activates his Devil Trigger; it felt like such a missed opportunity to not see Dante tear s*** up in his DT form (the closest equivalent being when Goku turns Super Saiyan in DBZ).

However, in keeping with the title of my review, if you're not a fan of the games, there really isn't much for you here. The games are what set up the universe and backstory of Devil May Cry, and if you haven't familiarized yourself with them, you probably won't get what's happening or not care; you won't really understand Dante's relationships with characters like Trish and Lady, and you won't really get a good grasp on his demonic heritage and tragic background. A few friends of mine watched the anime on my recommendation; those that were fans of the games loved it, while those who never played the games or had little experience with them didn't quite care for it.

Ultimately, whether or not you'll enjoy this series depends on whether you like the games; if yes, you should enjoy it very much, but if not, you probably won't care for it. The fights are nicely animated and fun to watch and it was great to gain further insight into Dante and the world he lives in. I was a little disappointed that the show is only 12 episodes long, but it's a satisfying 12 episodes and I was happy with the end result. If Capcom never continues Dante's story in the games and decides that the new emo Dante is what they're sticking with, we at least have four amazing games and a great anime to remind us all of what could have been.",1431648000,,2988,4.429090909090909

4849276,3,B005NQ5LNC,"Decent animation quality. Not as violent or graphic as I was expecting. The boss class encounters are rather abbreviated, so no uber-badass, god-like fights here. All in all, a solid anime that doesnt do justice to its source material.",1404172800,,235,5.051282051282051

Always for hire and always ready to slay demons, wherever they may be found, Dante readily packs up his sword and guns and gets down to work. Based on a video game, Devil May Cry continues the trend of great animation, impressive music, and continuous action. This is a pretty good deal if you're buying the S.A.V.E. version, although I wouldnt say no if you wanted to buy the regular DVD.

4849280,5,B005NQ5LNC,"Madhouse is such an overrated animation studio. Most of the stuff they make is eye candy and nothing more, plus they're responsible for that unholy, GOD AWFUL, overrated abomination Casshern Sins. And of everything they ever made, this is one of only three good shows they did. The other two being Black Lagoon and Highschool of the Dead. But this review isn't about Madhouse themselves. That was just something I wanted to get out of the way. Devil May Cry isn't the first Capcom franchise to be adapted into an animated series obviously. And usually, these adaptations turn out great, such as the Megaman cartoon from 1994-95, The Nightwarriors OVA from 1998(?), and the Power Stone anime from 2001-2002, and this is a welcome addition to that circle. You don't even need to be a fan of the games to enjoy it, and that's really saying something. It's supposed to take place between DMC2 and DMC4 from what I understand, and the director, Stephen Foster even got Reuben Langdon (who plays Dante in DMC3 and 4) to reprise his role, and he has great chemistry between the rest of the cast which includes many other great voice actors like Luci Christian, who plays Trish, and does a great job at it, Rob Mungle, Hilary Haag and others. Most of the episodes are self-contained, but the plot from the first episode does get revisited in the last two episodes, but I won't say how, because I don't want to spoil it. The show is great and the action sequences are fun to watch. One of my favorite of the battle sequences is from the end of the 7th episode in which Dante has to battle an evil mask. One of my favorite episodes as a whole however is the 5th episode:In Private, in which this guy is trying to score with a waitress at a diner Dante hangs around and she tells the guy that she wants somebody like him and he gets jealous and starts following Dante around and sees him killing certain people that are demons, but doesn't know that at first and thinks he's some kind of hitman and tries to warn the waitress at the diner. It was a very funny episode. Other notable episodes include:

4. Rolling Thunder
6. Rock Queen
and 10. The Last Promise

But enough of my personal favorite episodes. Foster did a great job directing the cast, and animation director Shin Itagaki puts the talents of the animation staff at Madhouse to some good use. Plus Bingo Morihashi, who was one of the writers for the games was also on the writing staff for the show, and made sure to come up with a good story line so Madhouse doesn't produce something that's just eye candy like most of the other stuff they did. I don't think it's for everyone, but it is worth checking out, and if you do end up liking it, you'll probably be revisiting at least certain episodes like the ones I mentioned. Although Trish (my favorite character in the whole series) is only in 4 of the 12 episodes (3 of which are the last 3) and she should have gotten a bigger role in the show than that.",1397347200,,2958,4.455719557195572

Yes every episode is just a stand alone but when it comes to the third disk it becomes a true story. Every so often we see his emotions but what makes it funny is his attitude towards everyone. Not being able to play the games myself, I enjoyed the anime from the many story lines to the music.

4849298,4,B005NQ5LNC,"On the quality of this show: The animations for DMC are fluid enough. They put a sizable effort into it. The graphic style is similar to the movie Blood. Not every cell is super detailed but its more than enough. The sound mixing is very good. Its setup for someone with a home theatre. Lots of cool music that was as good as the game and lots of gun sounds. The voice acting is good and silly like the video game. I'd say thats where it shares the most similarity.

The plot of this show is more like Buffy with some kind of an anime twist. Lots of demon slaying. Dante does jobs for different people and is struggling to survive. You get some typical supporting characters that were added for comic effect. Dante is himself and so is the city he lives in. It does expand the game very well in that respect. The early episodes were one I enjoy most. For $20 you get a nice distraction and a high quality set. I'd recommend this for DMC fans, and maybe not every anime fan out there, but I'm sure some people unfamiliar with the game will also like it. Its pretty much hours of demon slaying, OK dialogue, good animation and good music. There is nothing that you could say was a disappointment. The downside is there is nothing in here that will change your life. Its a set to watch when you are bored. I'd buy it again because it has a cool factor and I also liked the game.",1380067200,,1375,4.228136882129277

Overall I'm very pleased with the series. There are plenty of moments where I find myself chuckling and rewatching certain scenes.
The only thing missing from the series was Dante's Devil Trigger, though I didn't mind too much.
In terms of timeline this takes place after the first game and before the fourth game.
(timeline goes game 3, game 1, anime, game 4 then game 2; at least that's what i've been able to gather)

Quality was very nice. Would recommend this to any DMC fan out there along with anime fans to get them into the games. Interesting plot lines and comebacks though a couple characters were a bit overdramatic or too melodramatic. It was still nicely put in though.

4849316,5,B005NQ5LNC,Just like stated: S.A.V.E. good buy for the price compared to other vendors. Its also a good show. go buy it,1364169600,2,108,4.190476190476191
4849317,4,B005NQ5LNC,"Good price, and its really nice that all the discs are stored in the single case, saves a lot of space. The cover is reversable so that you don't see the save along the spine. Actually though, its not that big a deal and ugly as some make it out to be. For the price, I could deal with it even if it didn't have the reversable cover",1362096000,2,332,3.8970588235294117
4849318,4,B005NQ5LNC,"this series was so amazing and entertaining i loved the characters except the little one, she was annoying. the only thing i didn't like was the ending it was overly predictable and to easy . it didn't leave me in suspence or anything i wish the story was longer so that i could have hade more closure",1360454400,,301,4.298245614035087

4849320,5,B005NQ5LNC,"I found out that Devil May Cry had an animated series almost a year ago but never decided to buy it. Once I found out about DmC (Devil May Cry 5) was coming out, I decided to give it  a try. I actually enjoyed the series for what it was. To me it seems that if you know nothing about DMC, you will have a ton of questions, and there is the fact that is doesn't really follow the games besides the main protagonists.

I like the way the episodes were divided into missions so that there is an actually conclusion rather than cliff hangers every episode. I didn't like that the series was only the standard 12 episodes. If there were a second season, I would definitely get it. If you are a DMC fan, or just would like a nice, short series, I recommend this.",1358380800,2,756,4.136054421768708
4849321,5,B005NQ5LNC,"I am a hugh fan of DMC. I love the animated series. That was my 1st interduction to DMC. I watched all the episodes in English. And have been wanting it watch it all again. I don't really do video games but I really like the movie apeal put together by a YouTuber. They are called DMC 1 Outtakes, DMC 2 Outtakes, and so on. I am not sure I like the new look of Dante. Though it is being advised to not give up on it based on his ""New Look"". The punked hair ok, but making it black. That's just not Dante. But this is about the animated series. I love the English dubbed version better than the Japanese. I don't like subs, they hurt my eyes. What drew me to Dante's character in the first place was that ""I don't give a s*** about anything attitude which Justin Cause captured perfectly. I don't think they could have found a better voice actor for Dante he is totally the best. Although I am not normally and slasher fan, DMC is probably the best out their. Highly recommend it rather you watch it Subed or Dubed.",1357516800,3,1014,4.152284263959391
4849322,3,B005NQ5LNC,"The sound control is horrible! They have the dialogue so freakin' low but the gun fires on max. I had to turn up the volume to hear what they're talking about but then get scared s***less when they start shooting and before I can grab the remote control. The subtitle is horrendous too! It lacks and sometime completely saying something different. Anyways, I still like this series. ? I like Dante and the game series so I might be bias here. Anyways, he looks cool, calm and badass as usual. I'm disappointed though, he didn't even use the Devil Trigger :( Youre like, Waaaah?!  IKR??? Its a good fix for DMC fans. Ha. So watch for that and not for deep story or character development or tear jerker or mind opening. It's watchable. This series is packed with actions, how else are you suppose to kill demons .",1355184000,,811,4.47972972972973
4849323,4,B005NQ5LNC,"Dante is half demon that works as a demon slayer for hire. This anime follows his adventures with his friends Trish, Lady, and Patty. He goes all over killing demons that devour humans and cause all sorts of trouble. This series reaches it's climax when Dante takes on a demon that is trying to destroy the entire world.

This anime is pretty good. It has a very methodical feel to it. Each episode is a different story. The plot does however have a direction and a conclusion. The animation is good and the music is very cool too. The voice acting is kinda so so. The action and fight scenes are all really cool. The ending seemed very rushed though. All in all this anime is fun to watch. If you can get it for $15 or less then I'd say you got a good deal. It's not one of the better anime series out there, but it should keep you entertained for a bit.",1351296000,5,855,4.181818181818182
4849324,3,B005NQ5LNC,It should be a lot longer I rate 3 stars because no devil triggers no weapons except rebellion and ebony and ivory but you should definatley play at least two of the games before buying,1344556800,,185,4.314285714285714
4849325,4,B005NQ5LNC,"The show is awesome but it's missing one very important thing, Dante never ever Devil Triggers! I thought this show would be like the game where in tough times, Dante will need to show his true form and that's when he transforms himself to demon mode. I don't know why they didn't do that. It was a very big part of the game and it was awesome to do. Heck, even in Marvel Vs Capcom 3, Dante can devil trigger and that give him more power, speed, etc.

It wasn't like they didn't know about it either. They had Dante enemies turn into Demon form, and that gave them more power, but Dante himself didn't do it. And, they were very much like Dante, half human and all. Does that mean he couldn't do it? Does that mean he didn't know how to? Does that mean, he didn't need it because he cocky like that? I don't know because it doesn't show or explain this at all.

I thought at the very end of the series that...okay...maybe, just maybe, this will be the moment. He going to do!!! He has to do it!!! OMG, what is he waiting for?????? Yes, yes, finally!!! He needs MORE POWER!!! Then, it happened!?!?

His friends helped and encourage him to just kick butt. WTF?

Dante, just suddenly believes he can do it and pull a win out of nowhere. He kick the last bad guy butt like nothing. What??? He didn't need more power? He didn't need speed. He didn't need life gain, which I believe he looked like 1 cm of life left - the last bad guy should had just touch him with a finger and he should had be finished. What in the world? Dante didn't need to do anything at all. He had it in him all this time? All he needed was his friends to believe!!!!

Damn these Japanese animes with friends believe and it's BEATS EVERYTHING and ANYTHING! Booo!!!

There you go, Dante wins. And the series ends and you're left in a WTF mind?

This show would had got 5 stars, but is only 4. Give us Devil Trigger, Dante!!!",1338076800,11,1892,4.195592286501378
