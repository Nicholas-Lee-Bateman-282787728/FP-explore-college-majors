at the desk.
It sounds like members of the Moraz, Howe and Anderson families were battling over the sound controls during production - and the Morasses dominated most of the time.
The camera usually gets it right, so you see where the action is, still you hear the wrong instrument playing, which is very frustrating.
The worst rockumentary I've seen so far.",1269993600,7,436,4.75

8236972,3,B00104AZ5A,"One of that things that typified Yes, especially during the 70s and 80s was their cooperative writing style and the way new musicians were able to bring their style, and their ideas into the Yes gestalt and still be Yes. The era recorded here was Patrick Moraz's contribution and, short lived though it was, it produced some of Yes's best material.

But! And it's a really big but,the sound quality leaves a lot to be desired. Especially at the start of the concert where Moraz's biggest contribution is featured, which means that even though this ""part 2"" DVD features better sound it is also missing key tracks. (I had the VCR tape copy). I was actually at this show, waaaaay back, and I remember the sound taking a long time to get right. In fact I've noticed that at a few concerts and it is my main gripe with Yes.

Part 2 is OK bur misses important songs, especially for the Moraz period. But if you get both parts to get the whole show The opening 30-40 minutes have really bad sound.",1401494400,,991,4.43956043956044
8236973,5,B00104AZ5A,"I don't know why this item is not an official realease yet. This is a concert which any Yes fan, specially the old ones,would like to have  In the early 90's, it was released on laser disc format by a Japan company, I guess, with a very good image, slightly superior to the one contained on this dvd. Other thing to be lamented is the fact that it has been divided in two parts. I am aware it is a long duration show, but, couldn't it be accomodated on a single dvd?",1382140800,,466,4.065217391304348
8236974,4,B00104AZ5A,"I chose to buy just part two because I had watched part one at a friend's and the sound was pants. If you watch them on youtube you'll be able to realize it yourself. It's a pity to have to go with just part two but certainly worth the while of any Yes fan.

Pic and filming : the VBR picture goes from just over 3 Mbps to 7, but stays mostly closer to the floor. Nevertheless most camera angles are crystal-clear, esp. those shot during daytime. Almost no grain and lacking just a tad of sharpness, everything from color saturation to gamma levels have unsurpassable  quality. I didn't count the number of camera angles as I was having such a good time watching the powerful performance but there were several and certainly more than enough. For 1975 it's almost unbelievably good. I wished more of the contemporary dvds in my collection looked this good. Filming is old-school but very dynamic at the same time, you get to see everything with time and in time, solos, etc. Lovely.

Audio : Good,but lacking bottom end and volume varies between songs, but nothin a good sub can't succesfully correct. Bass, guitars, vocals and keyboard are nicely audible and well balanced/mixed. Even the cymbals are audible ! Unfortunately you can only hear the kickdrum and the rest of the kit is there, just too faintly mixed-in. I think the sound is mono but has been given a phase treatment to convey the impression of stereo (with AWESOME results). It also has a fake 5.1 soundstream but sorry, I don't do surround for concerts, only for movies.

I own not all, but the best Yes dvds and this ranks highly among them because of the unusual lineup and historic and musical value. And it's the one I come back to the most.",1371686400,,1711,4.545454545454546
8236975,5,B00104AZ5A,"Yes: Live  1975 at Q.P.R. is a 2-set video release of a 1975 concert by Yes at Queens Park Rangers Loftus Road stadium in England. For many years, the performance was available only as a bootleg before former Yes manager Brian Lane finally coordinated a 1993 VHS release without input fromor any consultation withthe band members themselves.  It had a 2-disc DVD release in 2001.

It is a good way to see the band with Patrick Moraz, as before Rick Wakeman returned to Yes in late 1976-early 1977.",1370390400,,497,4.625
8236976,5,B00104AZ5A,I know Yes have been arounds for a long time. I love the band. The band is awesome. It is different than other music I listen to. Jon Anderson have an awesome vocal. I will buy more music from Yes,1357948800,2,196,3.925
8236977,5,B00104AZ5A,"What an incredible experience this DVD is for a 1970's Yes fan.  You can feel the anticipation in the air among the English crowd stirring around in the final hour of daylight as our heroes get ready to take the stage....

Sure there is a sound problem at the concert's start.  But speaking as someone who's been to, heck, 120(?) concerts, that's just part of the unexpectedness of what goes on.  You just make the most of it.  It happens.  I really go to a concert to WATCH the rock being delivered.  If the sound is 75% there, I'm fine with that.  If I want to listen to a pristine performance of any band....I'll put on the studio CD and some headphones.  Y'all should do the same.  :0)

Is it just me or is this video quality really great?  I don't know what technology they were using there in 1975, but it looks as if it were being broadcast live.  Particularly the daylight sections.  Extremely clear.  McCartney's 1976 tour with all his money and top-notch equipment comes out grainy as I recall.  At least that's how I remember the comparison.

Great song selection and just a blast to be there, as progressive rock history was being made.

I have both parts 1 and 2.  I can't imagine having one without the other.",1312416000,13,1223,4.427927927927928
8236978,4,B00104AZ5A,"I almost didn't order because i couldn't get a time lenth of disc. label says 67 min.but was more.
Video decent clear for 1975.far from stage and close up cameras going. Saw show in chicago 4th of july 75 were ace opened. And people from the balcony(being the 4th) were throwing firecrackers.but after that stopped, show went on.
dvd shows the cool stage props from roger dean. I am so glad this i bought this and waiting for part one to arrive.",1310256000,,445,4.439024390243903
8236979,5,B00104AZ5A,Yes it seems the band didn't multi track this concert. The band doesnt care about the past so much as Benoit DooDoo This is as the ONLY complete and the yet released or found 1977 gfto tour which has 1 or 2 video cameras and is on you tube. I have lived with the sound and just be glad there sound at all. This is really the only proper complete concert of the 1970's the only real era Im afraid. You'll never see them young again please take the mix for what it is. I first saw this with the the laser disc 20 years ago. Now we have it on dvd which is expensive because it's a independent release the Japanese have own this and preserved the 1 inch video tape copy. By the 2nd song it gets better anyway. We are talking both discs. Offord or Tate was out there in that vast park things go wrong...happens,1280188800,,805,4.069182389937107
8236980,4,B00104AZ5A,"This is an historic document of the world tour for RELAYER that blends the previous and more dense Yes' material with the Relayer's more modern sound. In ""1975 at Q.P.R., Vols. 1 & 2: Live"", with Patrick Moraz on Keyboards the band showed an extended musical maturity and an unexploited experimental side, never before listened in the Yes music's catalogue, owed to the adition of Alan White (drums & percussion) and Patrick Moraz (Keyboards). At this point we have to remember that Bill Bruford (after the ""CLOSE TO THE EDGE album) and Rick Wakeman (after the TALES FROM TOPOGRAPHIC OCEANS) had left by diverse musical reasons.... So with songs like ""Sound Chaser"" that developed a Progressive jazz fusion music type (never before listened in Yes music), the soft ""To Be Over"" and the bombastic ""Gates Of Delirium""; In an intent to emulate (as the band said) the esque and the totemic proportions of the mystical ""Close to the Edge"" album...

The concert is maravellous and outstanding in spite of the lack of a perfect sound (that is good) or diverse camera takes, but enough to enjoy a great show realisisng the virtuosity of every Yes member; with songs like ""Ritual"", a dinamic good version of ""Sweet Dreams"" or the enigmatic acoustic version of ""Long Distance Runaround""... In this tour the band used a big Roger Dean's scenography with an amazing moving syncronized robo-lights. If you are a real Fan, It's amazing, and it really worth the prize you have to pay for this DVD, just to have this document, and great images of what YES were reaching at that moment...Good Luck!",1275868800,10,1581,4.833948339483395
8236981,4,B00104AZ5A,"This is the review for Yes Live At QPR 1975 Part 2 DVD, release dated 2009 and 2010 (depending on what part of Amazon you are on) with the dragon rider on the cover.  I have waited years to buy this and I am glad I did.  I love the picture quality, some shots look brand new and the sound is very good.  This is from 1975 remember and the sound gets better as the concert continues.
This shows what a draw Yes was selling out big stadiums. This is a part of history and as cool as the stage looks the next tour they did had even bigger stage effects.
I want that one too.
I purchased this from Amazon and not a secondary source so if something was wrong I could return it.  No problems.  This is a bare bones release with no extras commentary etc but I am glad to have it and any true Yes fan needs to get this.
If Amazon decides to sell part 1 for the same price I will get it.",1271376000,11,878,3.88268156424581
