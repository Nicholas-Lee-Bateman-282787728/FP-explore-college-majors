8694173,3,B00R58CMLK,"If it were the Thirties, and I was a 10 year old boy who'd spent all his allowance on buying The Shadow magazine, and I'd saved for a week to buy a ticket to either of these films, I would be outraged.  Neither has any Shadow action to speak of:  No clouding of men's minds, no mysterious mocking laughter, no twin blazing automatics, no Margo Lane, no Harry Vincent, no Burbank!
The Shadow Strikes is a standard B programmer; the only concession to Shadow-dom is a couple scenes of Lamont Cranston sneaking into a room wearing black.  And worse, a newspaper spells his name wrong.  Twice.
International Crime is even further off-base.  Lamont Cranston is a newspaper crime reporter writing under the byline of ""The Shadow"".  He never ever skulks around in a black cape and slouch hat.  He does, however, have a picture of The Shadow framed on his office wall, so that's something, I guess.
However, viewed dispassionately, I.C. isn't too bad a movie.  Rod La Rocque is personable and has some nice lines to deliver.  The publisher's daughter, Penelope Lane (sigh), is nicely played by Astrid Alwyn.",1519603200,,1099,4.742105263157895
