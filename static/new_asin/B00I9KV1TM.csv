6254512,5,B00I9KV1TM,"Bates Motel, gives there audience thriller, suspense's, drama, tension,deceit and a psychological spend. I stumbled a crossed this series about an month ago, and decided to take a chance on it,  and watch the first season. Well, I was quite surprised at the entertainment the actors delivered during every single episode( BOOM,BANG ,POW) yaw dropping performance. I can't wait to see what exactly happens in season 2 as, Norman's mother convinces him to kill his teacher(in his head), because she thinks the woman is trying to seduce her son that's just plan crazy. If, you are thinking about purchasing this don't think just get it and you will walk away a happy customer.",1393200000,3,673,4.95575221238938

6254520,5,B00I9KV1TM,So well written and acted. I remenber the arguements when they first tried to put the Hitchcock Psycho on late night local TV.

6254545,5,B00I9KV1TM,"The ten episodes contained in Season Two of ""Bates Motel"" continue the gripping storylines, superb acting and excellent production values set by the opening season of this bizarre, yet captivating modern day take of the original Hitchcock masterpiece, ""Psycho"".
Flawlessly cast as the beguiling mother-son combination of Norma and Norman Bates, Vera Farmiga and Freddie Highmore are exceptional, adding a fabulous edginess to their roles and come off as a totally believable and an unforgettable ""couple"".
The supporting cast is first rate, especially husky Max Thieriot as the other son, Dylan, who provides a  welcome contrast to his other family members. And the lovely Olivia Cooke adds a nice touch of sweetness and common sense to the otherwise crazy goings on in White Pine Bay - a beautiful location but seemingly riddled with crime.  Special mention to Paloma Kwiatkowski who makes quite an impact with her portrayal as Norman's friend Cody.
Hopefully the next season will be just as intriguing as the first two, although I fear as with shows like this, stories can become too far-fetched and lose all credibility.  Fingers crossed that ""Bates Motel""  will not suffer that fate!
In the extras, I enjoyed watching English actors Highmore and Cooke speak in their native accents.  Quite strange to hear Freddie in his ""cultured"" tone and Olivia  with her Manchester accent as compared to their flawless American accents in the series.",1466035200,,1441,5.189655172413793

6254571,5,B00I9KV1TM,"This entire series is magnificent.  The whole cast is great, and Freddie Highmore and Vera Farmiga are putting on an acting clinic.  Aside from the first two episodes, which worried me that the show had lost its way, every episode is a slam dunk. I've watched all three seasons and eagerly await the fourth.

If you like daring, interesting, wonderfully acted television, watch this show.",1452988800,,388,4.938461538461539

6254573,5,B00I9KV1TM,"Season 2 brings Norman slightly closer to what we know he will become in Psycho but leaves a lot of room for Season 3 and beyond to take him there. Norma as well is becoming, especially towards the final episodes, more and more unhinged. The relationship between mother and son is becoming even creepier and she certainly doesn't a new girl in Norman's life and is quick to forbid Norman from spending time with her. We've got a nice Breaking Bad type side plot also happening with Norman's brother which Norma's tunnel vision for her own and Norman's needs puts her non favourite son in further jeopardy. Emma we see a bit more of as well. Season 2 is a great next chapter in this show's life.

You can of course point out holes such as who is running the motel when Emma along with Norman and Norma isn't there? If someone is trapped underground wouldn't people comment or gesture with body language about the smell, if somehow the prisoner could hold it in wouldn't the first thing they ask to use the toilet when it is opened up? But we can live with these things, when we are being superbly entertained.

Besides deleted scenes and a sort of behind the scenes short documentary, Season 2's DVD also has some late night TV show called After Hours we're we see some of the cast interviewed on a couch (Freddie Highmore via satellite). On the DVD are the first episode season two premiere show and the final episode. The woman hosting the first one made a few mistakes in her delivery and came across as a bit of a ditz and it wasn't surprising that by the time the final episode came around that she'd been replaced. You don't learn a great deal about the actors or the show from watching these but it is interesting to see the actors speak in their own voices, including two British accented ones.",1451520000,,1801,4.47112462006079

6254636,4,B00I9KV1TM,"""Bates Motel "" is classified as a horror, but in all actuality the series is so much more. It is at times comedic, creepy, mysterious, dark, twisted and heart wrenching at the same time. This show is a prequel of sorts to the 1960 Alfred Hitchcock film called Psycho"" it doesn't stick faithfully to the film, but the writing and acting are top notch so you don't even care. ""Psycho "" is one of my all-time favorite movies and I didn't know if I would like the TV series, but I  do love it. I've been watching since the beginning and am completely hooked.

6254648,5,B00I9KV1TM,"Season two picks up four months after the conclusion of season one. The motel is now thriving although the threat of the town bypass is still looming. The sheriff is investigating the murder of Miss. Watson and Norman is still obsessed, visiting her grave and treasuring her necklace and a press cutting. The unfortunate Bradley is going off the rails and the feuding drug families are still feuding.

The character development and plot groundwork so carefully set out during season one have really borne fruit. Norma and Norman continue to shine in their lead roles while we learn more of Dylans past and a new girl from the wrong side of the tracks befriends Norman. There is a lot going on in this season; death, gang wars, a bit of police procedural stuff, blackouts, shifting allegiances, revelations and more death.

It is all very dark, charting Normans gradual descent into full-blown psychosis and Normas increasingly tenuous grasp upon reality, but it never loses pace and somehow manages to maintain a witty lightness of touch. There are some lovely and thoroughly fitting homage to Hitchcocks masterpiece without being overly reverential and, as with season one, the quality of writing and performance is outstanding. Knowing the ultimate fate of Norma and Norman does not dull the experience one little bit; Bates Motel is a marvellous bit of drama and I think Hitchcock would have approved.  Excellent stuff. Season three premiered in March 2015 and will be on our wish list as soon as it becomes available.",1426464000,,1521,4.980314960629921

I haven't seen season 1 yet so I didn't know the full story but even without knowing the whole narrative I really enjoyed season 2. It was creepy but you also like (or at the very least, want to like) Norman. Definitely a disturbingly close mom and offspring relationship but we kind of expect that (no incest or anything...between Norma and Norman anyway). Some very interesting surprises in season 2 and a lot of suspense that usually does not cross the line into the realm of frustrating suspense.",1426291200,,559,4.490196078431373

6254654,5,B00I9KV1TM,LOVED THIS SHOW - I HOPE ITS BACK FALL 2015 - VERY UNIQUE !!,1425254400,,60,3.357142857142857
6254655,5,B00I9KV1TM,"Considering there have been about 28 people killed in the sleepy little town of White Pines since the Bates showed up, the residents are remarkably unfazed. If they have a population of 2800, 1% of the town's residents have been murdered in a period of several months. If that death-rate continues, Norman, Dylan, and Sheriff Romero will wipe out the entire community in just under six years, AND all three of them have full-time jobs or school to deal with. Excellent work.

I had fairly low hopes for this show. Gus Van Sant's remake of 'Psycho' was a perfect example of 'Why are we doing this again?'-film-making; a shot-for-shot redux of Hitchcock's classic. But 'Bates Motel' is a very different breed of stuffed owl; it sets the iconic house and motel in a modern-day environment, and takes on the ambitious task of charting the transformation of Norman Bates -- from the polite, helpful. sensitive boy who is intensely close to his mother, to the completely insane 'Psycho' who stuffs her dead body and becomes 'possessed' by her murderously punitive pseudo-personality. There's more soap than subtlety here, but the writers keep the drama simmering 1-degree below boiling-point whenever a situation isn't in straight-up melt-down mode. The town of White Pines is like Twin Peaks, if the residents traded in their LSD and Shrooms for good old-fashioned coke and a few metric tonnes of sour diesel. Nestor Carbonell is brilliant as Sheriff Romero, bringing a gravity and enigmatic charisma with him from 'Lost' (where several of the writers and producers, like Carlton Cuse and Javier Grillo Marxuach, were scribbling and pointing and yelling before they moved into the Bates Motel). Max Theriot -- who joins Nestor in the 'Guys who look like they're wearing eye-liner, even though they aren't'-club -- plays Norman's brother, Dylan Masset, the true wild card thrown into the game. As the older half-brother who has long been treated like an outsider, forced to endure his the obvious favoritism she displays toward Norman. As Dylan becomes an integral part of the drug-production that props up the local economy, with plenty of his own troubles, he is forced to do terrible things to protect his family, saving their lives again and again. Dylan is the voice of reason, and along with Emma, the conscience of the series. The fact that he's a drug-trafficker and a killer makes it all the more sweetly ironic. After the shock he received in season 2 about his father, and the position of power he has stumbled into, season 3 promises to be interesting. Norma and Norman are the crux of the matter, however; Vera Farmiga has been creeping up on genius in her performance, handling the one character more complicated than Norman with a deftness and subtlety that is lacking in the story. And then there's Norman himself -- facing the crucible that might trigger the inevitable break in his psyche, like an egg cell dividing to produce twins.

The series is a bit uneven at times, with over-the-top scenarios that no one seems to be reacting to in a realistic way -- (SPOILERS) the storyline involving Keith Summers' sex-slave ring ends with the girl they rescued being chased into the woods by the Deputy; after he's dead, they're all sitting around devising a story, instead of trying to find her -- he claimed to have killed her, but he might have been lying, or he might have been wrong; she could have been badly injured, but alive. No one's going to see how the poor sex slave is doing? Really? Then there's the question that gets repeated about 20 times per episode, in many creative combinations: 'Are you alright?' 'I'm fine.' 'Are you okay?' 'Yep!' 'Is there something wrong?' 'No, why would there be anything wrong?' 'You know you can tell me what's troubling you Norman, you know that, right?' 'I do know that. And thank you. But everything's fine.' Everyone's constantly asking each other if they're 'fine' or 'okay'. It happens quite frequently, and once I noticed, it became pretty annoying. But it's not that big a deal. I suggest you forget I mentioned it in the first place. You'll be okay, right?

This is yet another addictive, beautifully crafted series that threatens to overtake the traditional film in terms of artistic importance. There have been very few films that are as powerful as The Wire, Game of Thrones, Rome, Breaking Bad, The Pacific and Band of Brothers, Deadwood, The Walking Dead, The Sopranos, Boardwalk Empire, Fargo, Broadchurch, The Returned, The Shield, Vikings, The Borgias, Banshee, Penny Dreadful, Black Sails, Orphan Black, Bates Motel... and those are just some of the best dramas.",1425254400,,4633,4.929577464788732

Norma even tries her hand at dating a very normal and likeable guy, but as with the other men she has associated with Norma just does not do normal.

Creepy brother Caleb comes into town and realizes that he is the father of Dylan which only complicates things even more, and speaking of Dylan he finds himself even more involved with the local drug cartel in many inescapable ways.  Norman says goodbye to his first high school love and meets another girl with family issues and she in return realizes that Norman has issues and after a death leaves town.

Throw in the sheriff and his many investigations involving the bates family and his somewhat flirtation with Norma, a nice tie up of loose ends in the season finale and you have me at the edge of my seat awaiting season 3.",1419638400,,1029,4.54054054054054

6254726,4,B00I9KV1TM,"I love Bates Motel. The show is a bit slow going (not boring, just slowly paced) at times; however, this season is obviously the major linchpin in the personal backstory of Norman Bates.

(Warning: sort-of kind-of spoiler-ish info ahead)

Season 2, at only 10 episodes, manages to show not only how MESSED UP his family actually is (and no, there is no mother/son physical intimacy as implied by the preview. Thankfully.) total enmeshed mother with codependent/borderline tendancies. Norman is still a ""good kid"" in this season, but we see how far in the dark he is about his own problems. (I won't say that we see that Norman is mentally ill,  as his symptoms seem more neurological - like an absence seizure combined with a super controlling and maladjusted mother who keeps him wrapped up in lies (perhaps for his own good)...combined with SOMETHING sinister.

FYI: As an advocate for the mentally ill, I want to highlight that the writers and directors do an amazing job (in my personal opinion) of avoiding the stereotypical [terrible] portrayals of mental illness. There is no ""Norman Bates is a psycho."" and no ""Norman Bates is suffering from a mental disease/defect/illness and is therefore a horrible person/can never be helped/should be locked away/straight up going to murder you and wear your skin.""

What we do see is great concern for Norman, and a misguided attempt from Norma to ""protect him"" from the truth of his blackouts.

In honesty, I feel that in retrospect, the viewer is given an opportunity to understand how damaging a lack of medical care for a patient can be.

In contrast, Norma's other son (Norman's half-brother Dylan) receives a terrible truth about his own life, and copes remarkably well. (PERSONALLY, if someone told me the same thing my head would explode.)

It is amazing to research the season with this thought in mind: Norma let's Dylan live his life and Dylan is allowed to hear a truth about himself. = Dylan stays Dylan.
vs.
Norma doesn't let Norman make any decisions for himself and has no healthy boundaries in her relationship with Norman. Norma ensures that Norman never learns the truth about ""his episodes"" EVEN THOUGH NORMAN SENSES SOMETHING IS TERRIBLY WRONG. = Norman Bates becomes NORMAN BATES.",1415577600,3,2249,4.931216931216931

6254732,5,B00I9KV1TM,"Consider the contents of the Blu-ray disk as one long movie and the makers were kind enough to add nine intermissions.  This review is for ""Bates Motel: Season 2 (Blu-ray), a TV show whose season consists of a mere 10 episodes.

The disk may contain 10 episodes, but ""Bates Motel"" is not episodic film-making.  It has all the hallmarks of a big-budget Hollywood movie extravaganza.  Every aspect associated with ""serious cinema"" is in expert hands behind the scenes, creating a stage suited for actors to practice their craft with abandon, passion, and convincing realism.

The story of ""Bates Motel"" is buoyed by the disturbing themes explored in Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece theatrical film ""Psycho.""  Hitchcock created the foundation as well as the precedent in telling the story of Norman Bates, so the makers of ""Bates Motel"" knew making the series was a risky undertaking.  It was easily a sink or swim endeavor.

Evidently, the series makers did their best to overcome the likelihood of failure that so many film makers face when attempting to recreate, re-imagine, or borrow from highly revered original films.  Just as evident is the fact that the series makers' ""best"" to beat the odds was enough to overcome the risks and they managed to create a genuinely fascinating and highly successful TV show based on the inimitable ""Psycho.""",1415145600,,1345,5.049773755656108

6254749,5,B00I9KV1TM,"Well, it is that time of year when the new shows have not quite all started, I don't have anything to watch, and I start looking desperately for something that will keep my attention.  I love binge watching shows - watching one episode a week causes the show to lose momentum for me, and often I stop something that might be good because I simply lose interest from week to week.  So I googled the best tv series on Netflix and on Amazon.  The first time I tried to watch this show was when it was on TV, and I watched part of the first episode, lost interest, and never watched again.  But it made many of the lists, so I decided to give it a try.  I am really glad I did.  I watched season 1 and season 2 over the course of a few days.  The acting is superb.  Vera Farmiga is unbelievable, and I feel lucky to have her outside of the big screen (where she firmly belongs).  The scenery of the town is also spectacular, and the characters are really interesting.  I really enjoyed this, and cannot wait for season 3.

6254779,5,B00I9KV1TM,"Bates Motel is the next take on the Alfred Hitchcock famous classic film Psycho.  What set this apart from the bad countless movies except the groundbreaking original is that it focuses on Norman and his Mother relationship as he is going down that path that makes him into the adult Norman Bates in 1st Psycho movie (played so well by Anthony Perkins).... Freddie Highmore (August Rush, Toast) is  the teen  Norman Bates who is showing sighs  of mental breakdown  because he having blackouts that he has no memories of his actions.  His Mother is aware of his blackouts,and what he capable of  when having one. She sets out to shield him and protect him.  Unfortunately she is a women who is unstable  with a long history of abuse and traumatic occurrences in her  own life. She also a magnet for the wrong people and wrong things. Which just causes Norman abnormal behaviors to get worse. The series is solid in story telling it's cohesive with Alfred Hitchcock vision and is extremely well acted by Vera Famgia and Freddie Highmore The first season was one of the best debut of a Television  series in tv history. With both star Freddie and Vera getting praise and Vera a Emmy Nomination for best actress in a Television series. The second season had a  hard act to follow. It manages to  be even better  going  deeper into the life of this tragic mother and son...introducing new plot twists . The second season we see Norman trying to make sense of his actions and trying to exert his will more  often while pulling apart from his controlling mother with deadly results.

I really get into each episode and each scene of the episode; very well directed and the muted lighting in most scenes is instrumental in maintaining that dark essence of the Psycho story.  It is very interesting to watch the interplay between Norma and Norman Bates as Norman's psychosis develops and is intensified.  GREAT acting by all, and particular kudos to the Norman actor!

6254806,5,B00I9KV1TM,"I wasn't sure if season 2 could equal the enthralling moodiness of season 1, but it definitely does.  The story continues it's twisty and often times emotionally warped path.  Vera Farmiga is beyond outstanding as the neuroticly nurturing Norma.  Her mental & emotional instabilaty simmers just below the surface, and Farmiga plays this with such a defined subtly, she's painfully heartbreaking at times, and Freddie Highmore as the jumpy but loveable Norman brings a sweetness and vulnerability to the unstable,often dark, Norman Bates. Max Thieriot as Norman's older brother Dylan just seems to be a character that gets better and better every season & every episode.  Nestor Carbonell as Sheriff Romero, brings just the right mix of, the long arm of the law, and conspiracy, with a heavy dose of sexual tension between him & Norma. Olivia Cook as the sweet yet unassured front desk clerk, Emma, has much more of a storyline in this season & she slowly has become a very interesting character. Bates Motel is a bit of a somewhat wild ride, but you'll find yourself wanting to ride it again and again. It's ADDICTIVE!!",1406764800,,1119,4.9361702127659575

This series is great and the acting and writing is really good.
My heart actually goes out to Norman and Norma and getting to know them has de vilified the entire story for me.
I actually care about them and their family and friends.
I want them all to succeed and more I want them to be okay.

6254825,4,B00I9KV1TM,"Bates Motel was one of my favorite shows of last season. So I was really anxious for season 2, and it was worth all the wait. This time, we see a deeper, crazier side of the Bates family and they do it perfectly. There's mystery, drama, love, a little bit of crazy incest, and everything that was present last season; the performances of the whole cast were great, especially, of course, Vera Farmiga and Freddie Highmore.
The story is so well told in only ten episodes, and every episode is entertaining, you want more every week. My favorite plot from this season was, of course, Miss Watson's murder mystery. With this, we get to see that Norman is slowly becoming the Psycho we first met in the 1960 film. Freddie deserved an Emmy nomination this year, he was brilliant.
But I feel that quality declined a little bit. The season starts with a bang, and then it gets a little bit boring, and then entertaining again. Some plots weren't that interesting and they were really slow, like Dylan's troubles with the drug dealers, I felt like he deserves new plots that didn't involved drugs. Also, Emma wasn't as important as she was on season one, she's my favorite character, and I felt that she was ignored for more than half of the season, which is sad, because Olivia Cooke is really talented, but I hope there's something big for Emma in season 3. There's not consistency this season, but it's still enjoyable.
But overall, this was a solid second season, but season one was better. It still keeps you at the edge of your seat, and I can't wait for season 3!",1405468800,,1562,4.542553191489362
6254826,2,B00I9KV1TM,"Second seasons are almost always impossible to get right nowadays. Scratch that, actually: second seasons have always been hard to get right. But every now and then there are exceptions. The two that stand out in my mind are The X-Files and 24. The reason for these choices are that both concepts that are already alarmingly consistent and tense and continue to build tension and intrigue in their sophomore seasons. 24's second season showed Jack caught in a decidedly sadistic terrorist plot by mistake and enduring torture and heightening intensity until the season ended on an explosive climax. The X-Files showed our agents getting more terrifying, strange, unusually and psychologically compelling cases such as ""The Calusari"" and the episode that is without a doubt the gold standard for the series, ""Anasazi"". Moving on, second season syndrome seems to be as dormant as ever nowadays and particularly disappointing cases are ""Heroes"" and ""American Horror Story"". But it's easy to understand why: the first season seems to be awesome because it set everything in place, and season 2 tries to up it by trying way too hard.

Disappointingly, Bates Motel is a show that could have, and really should have avoided this. Maybe it shouldn't have been such a hit in the first place, but looking at the first season: it was edgy, it was fast paced, it was true to the movie's psychological nature and featured a stellar performance from Freddie Highmore, who hit all the right notes while giving his own spin on Norman Bates, with Vera Farminga proving to us she could play a psycho mum really well. And the show managed to do all of this while remaining relatively simple. Murder plot, interesting subplot about a tortured girl, and the underlying theme of Norman's deteriorating mental state thanks largely to his mother.

And what do we get with season 2? Well, a lot of things. Too many things. We get several love triangles, all of which are uninteresting. We watch an important character from season 1 get killed off stupidly early in the season and in comes this uninteresting girl named Cody, who is essentially just a more rebellious and snooty Bradley (and she's extremely boring too- at no point did I care if she died or just went away). Emma has some guy she takes a fancy to, and this is largely ignored, but when it's brought up, it's treated like the most important plot in the show. Then we get Norma's subplot with the bypass and her love for men in the town council. Then we get a drug farming subplot that seems like a bad first draft for Breaking Bad. Then we get Norman killing a guy in self defense and it's immediately brushed off like a little indiscretion. Then we get Norman having blackouts. Then we get the resolution to the principal's murder from season 1 (but it comes off as lazy and last minute). Then we get... by now you get it. Or you don't. But it's alright if you don't, because it's not like any of these are particularly interesting.

Not helping matters is that this season is only TEN EPISODES LONG, like season one. Clearly this format is proving to be a writing problem for the show. Ten episodes is enough for a show like Game of Thrones because each season is based on a book from the series and each episode is a full hour, exploring Westeros. But here, these writers are apparently so happy about the success of their beloved Bates Motel that they feel more is better. Sometimes it can be, like the aforementioned 24 second season. But look at how last minute the marijuana farming subplot is. And why is there so much focus on Norma? What about Norman's blackouts? I'm sure this will be explained in season 3, but here it just feels like lazy writing all around.

I'll watch season 3, because like I mentioned, bad second seasons are pretty much a standard for TV nowadays. I get that not every show can be Hannibal nowadays. But that can't mean that it can't be good. Though considering how many movies there were in the Psycho franchise, maybe bringing in elements from the sequels could help to explain the convoluted plots and back stories here, but if not, then it'll be even more clear that this show is a victim of its own success.",1405468800,3,4187,4.669376693766938

I can not wait for season 3. I was a little skeptical at first, as should anyone who is a fan of the original movie, but this show delivers.

If you are a fan of the original movie, keep this in mind. You have to understand it doesn't take place in the same time period as the original. They have modernized it and set it up in a present day world. There are some changes (or additions) to the original plot line. They handle it well. While watching the show you will see them slowly start adding familiar traits to Norman that help him develop into the man we all know he becomes. This really helps flesh out the character. If you're going to go into this show looking for a linear telling of the events that lead up to Psycho or even Psycho IV: The Beginning you will be a little disappointed.

I believe this show will and seems to slowly be creating the world that Psycho takes place in. The event's all are working into place. I fully trust in the writing staff and direction of the series that its future looks promising. Heck I would even be happy if eventually when they do a final season it was the original Psycho retold with these fresh actors.

Also, I don't usually purchase TV shows...I purchased this without hesitation! great work!",1401926400,,1397,4.304182509505703

6254915,5,B00I9KV1TM,"BATES MOTEL SEASON 2 (2014) immediately picks up from the freshman Season 1 finale of Miss Watson's murder with her funeral in the season-opener, then jumps forward 4 months later to the beginning of summer, when all of Season 2 takes place. Business is booming at the Bates Motel, as Norma Bates (brilliantly brought to life by Vera Farmiga, who hopefully gets her overdue Emmy that she should have won for Season 1!) is gleefully bouncing around running her little roadside motel and living the good life with her #1 son Norman (superbly essayed by young phenom Freddie Highmore, more on him later) and her estranged son Dylan (played with understated excellence by Max Thierot). Also on board is Emma DeCody (winningly played by the refreshing Olivia Cooke), who helps Norma and Norman run the motel, and Sheriff Alex Romero (exquisitely performed by Nestor Carbonell), who is trying to keep peace in the not-so-sleepy town of White Pine Bay, Oregon. These 5 major characters return from Season 1 and continue to help shape this amazing series!

A very early subplot of Season 2 involves Bradley Martin (admirably reprised by Nicola Peltz), who is suicidal over her father's brutal death back in Season 1. Bradley exacts revenge against the person she deems responsible (drug leader Gil) and then Norman and Dylan must work together to bail her out. Bradley's actions in the first episode sets the stage for Season 2's major drug-war subplot and introduces several new characters to the fray. Enter Zane Carpenter (played with sleazy, slick glee by Michael Eklund) who takes over as Dylan and Remo's boss. Special mention should also go to Ian Tracey as Remo, a minor character introduced in Season 1, who returns to help keep stability to the show. Zane is a hothead, a Sonny Corleone type who believes in ""an eye for an eye"", so he kills one of the goons who worked for the rival mysterious local drug lord Nick Ford (played with calculating menace by reliable veteran Michael O'Neill). Turns out that Ford is Miss Watson's estranged father and he pressures Romero to make an arrest, which he does early on, but Romero is not totally convinced that he's arrested the right man. Ford also makes friends with Norma at a dinner party they were both invited to by Norma's new friend Christine (well-played by Rebecca Creskoff) and her brother George (underplayed by Michael Vartan of ""Alias"" fame). Ford arranges for Norma to get a seat on the city council, but wants something in return. As Norma becomes more and more embroiled in the seedy underpinnings of the town, she begins to realize that she's out of her league. Meanwhile, Norman makes a new friend Cody Brennan (refreshingly played by Paloma Kwiatkowski), a rebellious joint-smoking, boozing, tattoo-laden outsider girl with an abusive father, but a sort of odd kindred spirit with Norman. Another early subplot involves Norma's brother Caleb (played by Kenny Johnson in the best guest performance of Season 2), which eventually compels Dylan to move out and separate himself from his creepy family. Finally, a very important running storyline involves the subtle, budding relationship between Norma Bates and Alex Romero, with stellar, close-to-the-vest acting by both Farmiga and Carbonell. After a series of very tenuous, strained interactions in Season 1, Norma and Alex find themselves unwittingly drawn closer to each other through their surprisingly in-common force-of-nature personalities and deep feelings for what they believe in.

Season 2 has a lot going on, but the MAIN draw in the entire season for me is Norman's deeper descent into psychosis, and THIS is where further discussion of Freddie Highmore comes in! As good as he was in Season 1, it only touched the surface of what Norman Bates was, mostly focusing on him being mainly an awkward, gangly teenager with rare bouts of psychotic breaks. But Season 2 really ups the ante as Norman begins to lose control more and more with more frequent breaks. An early brilliant sequence involves Norman confronting Caleb on what he did to Norma when they were teenagers. Later episodes show that Norman is becoming more take-charge, independent and defiant against Norma, whereas in Season 1 he was mostly subservient to her. As Norma sees she is losing control of her son, she starts to unravel and shirk her other responsibilities and it becomes painfully apparent that she can't live without him. In my humble opinion, Freddie Highmore completely deserves an EMMY for bringing to life again this iconic character of Norman Bates. It was like watching him become Anthony Perkins before our very eyes! The dynamic between Highmore and Farmiga as Norman and ""Mother"" is one of the most fascinating relationships ever put to celluloid. If they give the Emmys to any other actors based on these two people's work in Season 2, I will demand a recount!",1399766400,30,4871,4.990159901599016

6254927,5,B00I9KV1TM,"I rarely (if ever) read Tumbler blogs or other online fandom cites. Their comments about plot, acting, and the ""shipping"" of characters (in the case of Bates Motel, I can only imagine and respond with a resounding ""Eww"") offer only to skew my opinion of a show before I even watch it.

Some of the most brilliantly executed shows are derived from films (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, for instance or La Femme Nikita). Bates Motel falls into this category of smoothly orchestrated spinoffs as the show that continues to craft a profile of Norman Bates during his teenage years.

The psychological profile that Bates Motel offers of the eccentric town of White Pines is brilliantly executed and mirrors personality complexities of both Norman (Freddie Highmore) and his mother Norma (Vera Farmiga). The town thrives on an illegal cash crop, and ordinary (well, mostly unordinary) citizens are often caught in the middle of firefights among other dangerous situations. The town has its own unspoken rules, and Sherriff Romero (Bat Manuel in the live action version of The Tick) enforces the understood laws of the town to the letter.

Where does Norma end and Norman begin? The show continues to delve deeper into that mystery weekly.

In the Alfred Hitchcock film Psycho, Norman Bates conveys a clean cut, helpful boy-next-door image who, underneath it all, has an alter ego that is (to understate it) aggressive, murderous, and influenced by Norman's own perception of his mother, Norma Louise Bates. Bates Motel invites the viewer to debate just how much of Norman's condition is a genetic predilection (schizophrenia possibly) and an environmental one (unnatural closeness to a controlling Mom, experiences from living in a sick and twisted town, etc.) The knowledge regarding Norman's character continues to deepen just when you think it's impossible for the show to unveil anything ""creepier"" than what the audience has already learned.

Other interesting characters include love interests for Norma, Dylan (Norman's half brother), two warring drug families, and Norman's friends (which includes a school teacher with daddy issues).

I could write a four-page review, but I might include spoilers and wind up hating myself.  Watch at least the first season; you will thirst for more!",1399420800,,2282,5.201634877384196

He's just like any other teenager growing up in America (trying to find balance and boundaries with his (overbearing) mother). This season we get a sneak peak, a quick glimpse, as to what's to come (think Psycho movies). We see him manipulate. We see him protect what he loves. We see him unable to cope and subsequently find a strategy to cope.

2.) What's up with these 10 episode seasons? That needs to stop, but I'm glad this season had a lot going on in it.

3.) These actors are high rate. Norma's mousy voice, whines, and constant crying and worrying are believable. Norman, totally believable. Max is believable, trying to find his place in this family. The sheriff who makes the evidence fits into what he wants, totally believable.

4.) This season does not disappoint and is full of drama, plot twists, and emotional roller coasters.

On top of that, there are so many ridiculous elements to he show this year that would just NEVER happen, especially in regards to the way the police force operates. It's just ridiculous.

6254957,5,B00I9KV1TM,Love this show. Vera Farmiga is awesome in this roll; one minute you want to hug her and the next you want to push her down the stairs. We are hooked and even went bank to watch Psycho again.,1398556800,,191,3.923076923076923
6254958,4,B00I9KV1TM,I like the history of Norman Bates and his family... What caused him to start having blackouts? Was it when he killed his father?,1398470400,,129,4.416666666666667

6254960,5,B00I9KV1TM,I am loving Season 2 - even more than the first season. Excellent storylines. They are referring to the mother/son creepiness also this season which I like as it is a nod to the original Psycho.,1398470400,,194,4.416666666666667

6254962,5,B00I9KV1TM,"Season one was very exciting, as we experience first hand, the relationship of a boy serial killer and his troubled mom. Season two however, is really on the ball, as we watch Norman actually become his mother during his black outs. This is crucial in the understanding of Norman Bates as the mature character in PSYCHO. Norman thinks he is his mother when he lashes out on his victims, and this character flaw is much more developed in season two, and much more terrifying! I love this psycho drama!",1398297600,,500,4.629213483146067

6254965,5,B00I9KV1TM,"If you know the ""PSYCHO"" movie (Alfred Hitchcock 1960 version and even Psycho II) you'll LOVE This show.
-> Not the 1998 Gus Van Sant shot-by-shot remake (27% liked it, that's bad)
Even if you don't know the Psycho movies you will love this show.
Vera Farmiga is just fantastic in it.  Flawless performances every week.
The rest of the cast is almost equal to Vera Farmiga.. But she just shines in this show..
Watch Season One and catch up on Season Two as it's almost over..
Season Three has been picked up for the Fall... YAY!",1398297600,,528,4.443298969072165

They've got the perfect mix of eclectic characters; and the perfect actors to play them. There's ever so subtle references to the movie; that if you've never seen ""Psycho"", you wouldn't have to, to enjoy the series; as it stands well on its own. That being said, to enjoy the writing/acting/directing further, it's worth while watching ""Psycho"", if not just for enjoying a classic film; but to enjoy those subtle references to the movie of which the show is loosely based on.",1398038400,,569,4.757575757575758

His over possessive mother is also a bit of a Jekyll and Hide shrew. She can be clinging and needy one moment and then screaming and obnoxious the next. What Norma does to her son is too pathetic to be a crime but unforgivable. Now his black outs have increased and he sees his mother when she isn't there and even becomes her. We have all seen the movie and grit our teeth as we see Norman heading down the road to insanity. It is cool and definitely cannot be an accident that the actor portraying Sheriff Romero bears an uncanny resemblance to the older Tony Perkins. The story development is intense. I find myself hoping against the certain knowledge of the outcome that somehow things could turn out differently for poor Norman. Yet, as is so often true in real life, we feel like helpless spectators observing  the demise of some one we cannot save. Thrilling stuff!",1396742400,,1003,4.48087431693989

***************************
For one thing, Norman is already 17 or 18 years old and has absolutely zero motive to kill his mother. There might have been some over Bradley, but Bradley is gone. I think the setup has been established that: 1) Norman has blackouts 2) Norman's mother is beyond messed up herself and jumps from killing someone to forgetting it in some kitschy way like she really believes it is 1958 at her house 3) Norman according to ""Psycho"", killed his mother and her (sheriff) lover fairly early on and spent ten years in an asylum for it. They aren't leaving much time for this to develop either.

As much as I love Farmiga as an actress, her soap-opera goings on are wearing thin. She has already established just how far Norma will go and what kind of mother she is. We know how she's affecting her son. And that he has inherited whatever sociopath tendencies she has. I don't mind the comedy either because let's face it, some of Norman's mother's lines in Psycho were pretty funny. But I just feel like there's too much about her and not much about Norman on the show these days. Maybe that is to show how dominating she is, but we get it already that's she's running (and ruining) his whole life.

It's time for Norman to make a big move. But so far, why on earth would he kill her?",1396656000,3,1561,4.3944636678200695

6255046,5,B00I9KV1TM,"I'm very particular about what I watch, I don't have cable so when I purchase a series via Amazon and take the time to watch, it means I'm all in. Also, I have had a bias against television (and movies) re-booted from original material and after watching ""The Sarah Connor Chronicles"" (*post* cancellation... **sigh**), I've learned the error of my ways. At the moment, ""Hannibal"" and ""Bates Motel"" are some of the best storytelling in the medium. Both prequels of a sort and both in some ways surpass their original inspiration. The two lead actors who play Norma and Norman Bates are compelling. Norma vacillates from almost normal (albeit briefly) to manic at a moment's notice leaving the audience to wonder -- is it always genuine or at times engaged to manipulate her son? Their line(s) between victim and prosecutor are constantly blurred. It is co-dependency at its ugliest (and most entertaining). And what a delight to see the always wonderful Nestor Carbonell (I l-o-v-e-d him in the live action ""The Tick"" series) as the town sheriff. Their sleepy hamlet reminds me a bit of Neptune, CA in the ""Veronica Mars"" series/movie -- the town is its own character filled with dark secrets and oddball characters. Give the pilot a try and stay on for the rest of the series. Worth your valuable time.",1395705600,,1303,4.821428571428571

The second season however, started very slow and predictable. I fear that the show will fall short and become another teenage CW-like series. The character ""Bradley"" is boring and very distracting from the main thrill of the series.

Need more adults and less O2 girl. Please get rid of Bradley. I won't even mind if Norman stuffs her and puts her in his room. Terrible actress. This season better shoot for the stars because the supporting cast stinks. Killing Abernathy was a mistake. He was a strong character--could have dragged out his arc a little.

But please, whiny O2 girl and 90210 girl will be the shows downfall for real/mature/adult viewers who are sick of the bs they bring. And Dylan, decent guy---do not hook up with suicide chic. No good.",1394841600,2,665,4.541666666666667

6255095,5,B00I9KV1TM,"Bates Motel started out on a high note for it's season 2 premiere.  Everything you loved from the first season is back, and sets up for a very promising second season.  The show is dark and humorous, the performances from the actors are so fun to watch, especially Norma and Norman.  I love that you never know what Norma is going to say in a situation.  Make sure you watch Psycho before so you can see the easter eggs sprinkled in the show. Great show, great premiere, can't wait to see how the season plays out.",1393804800,6,514,4.322916666666667
6255096,4,B00I9KV1TM,"Please note: this review may contain spoilers although I've tried to avoid that by focusing on how the characters and series have evolved since Season 1 -rather than spilling details of the most suspenseful moments.

After watching the first season in one fell swoop (was snowed in), I became completely hooked by this series and had my calendar marked for the start of the next season. It wasn't a disappointment for me but not quite as spellbinding as I'd hoped. But  hey...it's early on.

Possible spoiler alert: I  really liked the fact that Bradley, the young woman who has lost none of her appeal for Norman, had a more prominent role  -- especially in the opening shocker scene. She's grown into a darker, more disillusioned person, still deeply grieving her father. She's more tormented

So while  the opening episode still lagged in some places for me, it also had some very fine moments, including humorous touches to offset the darker sections. Even so, I felt there was less bite, less edginess in this opening plot line. But I'm still trusting this series to regain its stride as it goes along and to tie up some loose ends from the Season 1 closing.

Abother possible spoiler: I wasn't particularly impressed with the new and (for now) softer version of Norman's mother. She seems less edgy, especially with her new hairstyle and tendency to wear business suits. Luckily, she hasn't lost any of her explosive anger, a fury which can be directed at nearly anyone who refuses to listen to her or frustrates her ambitions.

Freddie Highmore remains amazingly believable as the teenaged  Norman Bates  (the adult version was played by Anthony Perkins in Psycho). Highmore has the mild, self effacing manner and gentle smile that is eerily similar to Perkin's grin. It is uncanny.

As noted above, in this episode there are some humorous and light moments in between the creepy ones. Spoiler alert: Norman's mother gives him driving lessons and seems as stressed as any parent advising an inexperienced teenager behind the wheel .When she trades places with Norman and gets behind the wheel herself, he teases her about her driving skills. Will he continue to push the boundaries or will she undermine him yet again?

The humorous touches don't eliminate the tension and drama between mother and son.  Norman still resents her attempts to control his every move. He still wavers between his desire for freedom and his dependence on his her. He still turns to her for advice and she has a knack for getting him to open up, especially when he feels most vulnerable.

Plenty of questions remain unresolved by the end of this episode, maintaining enough suspense to make me eager for the next one. What's behind Norman's memory lapses? What additional secrets from Norman's past  will be revealed? Which of the townspeople are dangerous and which are trustworthy? These -and other- mysteries are intriguing enough to keep me eagerly anticipating next week's episode.",1393804800,6,2971,4.93574297188755
