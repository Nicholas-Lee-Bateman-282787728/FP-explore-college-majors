8623389,2,B001JMGS7C,"The 3-disc anthology of the British TV series deserved much better. Anyone anticipating a crisp, pristine digital restoration from the original 35MM negatives should prepare themselves for a severe letdown. What I got was digitally transferred episodes, wildly variable in picture and sound quality, with some opening and end credits in foreign languages (i.e. French). To its credit, the episodes are listed in chornological order and even highlighting the guest stars of a given episode. Unfortunately, until someone gets around to developing a far superior quality collection, this will have to do.",1352073600,7,601,5.543478260869565
8623390,4,B001JMGS7C,Rating this show is difficult since I haven't seen it since 1961-62!! And I was probably 7 or 8 years old. I adored this swashbuckling show and would love to get my hands on a copy which plays in US format. Has anyone here seen the show in the UK?,1325462400,4,247,3.96
