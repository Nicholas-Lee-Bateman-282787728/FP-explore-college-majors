8359306,3,B000EH4WU8,"He's clearly very competent;  however, I have several items of constructive (I hope) criticism):  First, this is NOT for rank beginners..he assumes that the viewer has a lot of prior experience with other percussion instruments; e,g., he starts out with how to hold two mallets in each hand-jeez, I can barely figure out how to hold one.  Second, there are a number of different ways to use the mallets--for instance, I've seen some commentaries about using first the left hand, then the right hand; other teachers suggest using the left hand to strike two bars, and then the right hand striking two bars--it would be good if he would discuss the pros and cons of both.  Third, he shows no passion in either playing or teaching--I am not looking for a Tom Cruise jumping up and down on Oprah's guest sofa; but this guy is as dull as dish-water.",1260748800,,844,4.644295302013423
8359307,5,B000EH4WU8,This product met my expectations.  Jerry is very clear in his presentations of mallet and playing methods.  This will be very helpful to others just learning to play.  The visual and narration is excellent.,1174262400,2,206,5.0
