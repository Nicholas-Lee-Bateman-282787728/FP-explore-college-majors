8517143,3,B007I1Q58U,I enjoyed watching this a kid growing up and decided to get it for my son.  I was surprised by the lack of a decent picture.  It's very fuzzy and of a really poor quality. Although I think they are a great series I probably will be unlikely to purchase any more unless the quality of the picture is improved.,1357689600,,308,4.116666666666666
