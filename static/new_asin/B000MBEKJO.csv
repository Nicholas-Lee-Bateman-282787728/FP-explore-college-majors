8167625,1,B000MBEKJO,"I wanted to get acquainted or learn a little about the Alexander technique. When I ordered this DVD I did not expect I would learn a lot, but I did think I was going to be able to receive some information in a clear, professional and respectful way. None of these things happened. This video is nothing but a tea-time conversation between the instructor and her famous student. A conversation between two people who already know what the technique is about. Apparently, the instructor,(or teacher?) has already taught her student all he needed to know and now, on this DVD, they are graciously going over part of it again, in order to publicize her classes and, possibly, get new students. What I found appalling is the fact that this teacher, in her WITHDRAWN attitude, does not even look at the camera and totally overlooks the fact that there is a human being watching this DVD and expecting to learn a little from her. The instructor has no intention whatsoever to provide the viewer with MINIMUM information, or tips, or advice as to what to do or not to do to improve posture. Not one single tip! Her rant about the technique is arrogant and disrespectful and it looks that she is much more interested in wooing her good-looking student than passing on a little information or help to the poor viewer. This is not a lesson, much less a first lesson, and any serious teacher will easily realize that this lady has no intention whatsoever of teaching anything through this video. This is nothing but a self-serving, arrogant, disrespectful DVD from a lady who considers herself to be above the rest of humanity. Her omnipresent forced smile is also very annoying.",1379030400,7,1667,4.731958762886598
8167626,5,B000MBEKJO,I think this dvd is more than just a taster about the Alexander Technique and provides a detailed and very worthwhile opportunity to understand what it is about.  Highly recommended.,1377475200,,182,5.066666666666666
8167627,2,B000MBEKJO,"It is hard to stay focussed. I think the Alexander technique is great and something everyone (not just musicians and actors) can benefit from. However, this DVD is not the best. William is not engaging and seems dull instead of excited to learn the technique. The second half is a bit better.",1365120000,,292,4.634615384615385
8167628,2,B000MBEKJO,"I started this video with high hopes of a focused presentation on techniques for AT suitable for a beginner. To be honest I actually fell asleep after the first hour with waves of boredom, then lethargy and finally deep sleep setting in. You need to be very positive about the presenters to see this as engaging in the least. William Hurt is extremely dull, offers little value and almost seems awkward when asked to help the presenter. Definitely not a good start to someone interested in learning more about AT as a beginner. The second hour is much more practical and useful so hang in there.",1354838400,2,595,4.622641509433962
8167629,5,B000MBEKJO,"This DVD will take years to absorb and I will get through it. One visual of ""freeing the neck"" made a real difference in my posture. A simple concept but extremely hard to incorporate in daily life to replace decades of habit. If I can just change this one habit then I will go back and find another and use it. Do not expect that there is a magic instant formula here but with time is should help most people that will never afford or don't have a class available close by.",1313193600,,474,4.163043478260869
8167630,2,B000MBEKJO,I must admit that I watched the first 10 minutes and lost focus as to what was happening. Needed more interactive exposure.,1286323200,3,123,4.636363636363637
8167631,5,B000MBEKJO,"I have this video, and I was lucky enough to take sessions with Jane Kosminsky and applaud her and am grateful that her video is sensitive, honest, instructive to the core of the way she works personally with individuals.  The only reason I left her was the available time that she had was around 3-4 pm and believe me if work were near her I would never have left.  This video with William Hurt is exactly the way it is when you are working with Jane, so that if you follow it and hear what she is saying and watch her you will more than benefit.  She was recommended by a friend of my son's who had a back problem...and I said ""had""..... Heather",1271635200,8,647,4.201612903225806
8167632,5,B000MBEKJO,"To be blunt: in order to learn the Alexander technique you need to work with a qualified instructor, period. Jane Kosminsky is the first to admit this. Having said that, you can still learn LOTS from this DVD and the current score for this product does not do it justice (especially because of one silly review).

If you have no idea what the Alexander technique is and before you start shelling $40 for 30 minute sessions you might want to consider purchasing this. Even after having gone through sessions, the material here will serve as a good refresher and referencing tool that you could use for years to come. It makes you aware of proper posture, what to keep in mind when thinking of posture, the philosophy behind AT and has a relaxation exercise that is very helpful. I use it often.

There are many subtleties to AT and you'll likely not learn it from this DVD alone. The least you'd take away from it however, will be a very relaxed and better posture and the understanding and awareness of what it entails.",1270857600,17,1019,4.562841530054645
8167633,5,B000MBEKJO,"I got this one out from the local library and was surprised there wasn't a review yet.  I guess the Alexander Technique is not very well known.  But this is great stuff - and I should have realised that my years of back problems were due to all the stresses placed on my back by bad posture and trying to stay propped up for long periods no matter what the cost.

There is a lot of material in this video - over two hours worth.  A great intro to what it's all about and then a second part where they go into practical applications.  Sitting at the office, reading in a chair, reading in bed, even eating at the table, etc - all things that have become a problem for me over the years.

All in all - I think the basic awareness of the specific problem postures will now be of immense value.  Then coupled with some back exercises to get some more strength in there (which I'll have to get somewhere else) I think the chronic back pain will become a thing of the past.",1213833600,47,967,4.13903743315508
