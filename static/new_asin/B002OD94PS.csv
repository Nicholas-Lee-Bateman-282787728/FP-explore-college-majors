8427276,5,B002OD94PS,This film is amazing - in its testament to Billy McLaughlin's talent and fortitude and the journey taken when the body betrays the mind of an artist.  I cheered and I cried; but mostly I cheered.  I've subsequently heard Billy play live and have discovered that he lives up to expectations and beyond.  A wonderful film by Suzanne Jurva.,1314662400,4,337,4.677966101694915
8427277,5,B002OD94PS,"There are everyday things musicans worry about...missed notes, being out-of-tune...but no fear is as great as being struck by a disease which means you can never do what you love ever again. How can you lose the means of expression and means of income? It's unthinkable, but it happens.

A renown woodwind player I knew, used to say ""never take no from an inanimate object"" and Billy McLaughlin didn't take no from doctors, his own fears or his fingers. He fought an incurable disease to make his comeback on the stage.

This documentary is a gem, in a world where documentaries are so hard to fund...then hard to find. Fortunately, it can be found on Amazon.  You can see the love, craft and admiration that was put into it.

Not only do you follow Billy's struggle to get back on stage....you get to hear him play. It's like a concert ticket to a performance.",1313798400,6,861,4.571428571428571
