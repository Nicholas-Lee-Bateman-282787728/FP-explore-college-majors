8356030,5,B0028BJCFS,My daughter bought this for her Dad for his birthday.  He has watched every class and learned something each time which he then shares with me.  At 72 years of age he is happily learning something new every day--about cooking and then putting it to use.  This is a great series.,1426636800,,278,4.411764705882353
8356031,5,B0028BJCFS,Perfect way to learn how to make some of those dishes that bully you!  She has a very  good sense about  simple ways to create a sophisticated  meal.,1395446400,,149,4.214285714285714
8356032,5,B0028BJCFS,"I have both seasons of Joanne Weir's Cooking School on DVD and I love them. I watch the episodes on PBS but I like having the DVDs for easy reference and as a refresher. Joanne has excellent teaching skills and the majority of her students are an absolute joy to watch therefore the DVDs also have a pure entertainment value. The students seem to relate to her and they obviously learn new techniques and great recipes. One thing the Season One set has is the recipes that you can print from your PC.  The recipes from Season 2 set are not available for printing.... too bad.

I would recommend these DVDs. I've never had any of the tracking problems that other's have mentioned. Perhaps the problems lie in their own equipment.",1342224000,,728,4.549618320610687
8356033,2,B0028BJCFS,"DVD do not work.  As earlier reviewers have said the shows do not work.  At least you can still get the recipes on the dvd.  When you point to an episode it goes back to the main menu without showing the episode.  It does not matter what is plays on.  I have tried it on my laptop, my desk top, my dvd player and my dvd/blu-ray player.  Same thing espisodes do not play.",1318291200,2,370,4.0
8356034,5,B0028BJCFS,"i also had dvd disc b tracking problem in one episode. and i contacted the amazon.com about this issue. and they kindly replcaced this dvd set with another one which doesnt have any tracking malfunction of the disc b.
and for the contents of this dvd set, i am very satisfyied of joanne's tutoring of cooking  even though i felt her style of tutoring sometimes tends to be like assuming her guests and audiences don't have any simple basic cooking experince but definitely not in a bad manner.",1265414400,3,493,4.6022727272727275
8356035,1,B0028BJCFS,"I have season 1 and love it.

I purchased season 2 and disk B has a bad track little over half way into the disk.

Amazon quickly replaced the set - same problem with the second one.  This is a production issue.

I attempted to contact the manufacturer directly and get the disk replaced but they can not be reached.

Until the manufacturer addresses the bad track issue - there is one lesson that will fail.

I patiently wait.

By the way, Amazon was great at attempting to resolve the issue.",1252800000,6,493,4.351648351648351
