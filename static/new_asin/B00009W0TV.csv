1891530,5,B00009W0TV,"This is the only DVD with the entire Put Down the Duckie song.  Other Sesame Street DVDS have parts of the song, but this is the only one with the whole thing. My two year old son loves dancing and singing to the duckie, and many of the other songs.",1138665600,6,249,3.98
1891531,5,B00009W0TV,"This video was made with the usual good quality of the Childrens' Workshop folks, but they have intertwined classic Sesame with humor that is definately directed toward adults.  It was probably an attempt to keep everybody happy while watching the same video, but my 2 year old enjoys other Sesame DVDs, most of which contain the same songs, more.  He tends to get bored with the ""guest star"" skits - and ""Put Down the Duckie"" is available on DVDs that hold his interest better.",1112918400,5,478,4.678571428571429
1891532,5,B00009W0TV,"I love this video and show it to my 13 month old, who gets a pretty good kick out of it too.  The reasons that other folks have listed are the same reasons I love it.  But ""Put Down the Duckie"" is one of the best songs I've seen in a long time!",1106611200,3,244,3.5849056603773586
1891533,5,B00009W0TV,"This is how I remember SS! Humorous sketches that included humans interacting with muppets, kids having fun on the street, and memorable muppet sketches, such as Grover the waiter and ""Monsterpiece Theater"". This along with ""Follow that Bird"" are the closest dvds that classic SS fans would enjoy. Only problem is that the dvd is way too short(45 minutes). It would have been nice also to see some of the old cartoons and short films too.",1092614400,9,438,4.776315789473684
1891534,5,B00009W0TV,"This is possibly the only Sesame Street video not made for kids. This one takes the best of the adult-humor material from Sesame Street and puts it all on one video. The ubsurd, the sublime, and the really cool.
Put Down the Duckie is Sesame Street poking fun at itsef. It's Phil Donahue digging up the dirt, Sesame Street style. And Barbara Walters *trying* to interview the ever-innocent Bob.
Don't buy this one for the kids. Some may like it, but I guarantee Mom and Dad will like it better!",1080518400,16,494,4.5
1891535,5,B00009W0TV,"My 16-month old loves rubber duckies and I bought this in an effort to find the Ernie classic, ""rubber duckie you're the one"".  It's not on here, but it didn't matter because my son loves ""Put Down the Duckie"".  Loves it.  It's all he wants to watch.  He's relentless, but I'm limiting him to just once a day, and then only a few of the segments.  He will watch the entire thing, which is amazing for the short attention span of a 16-month old (it's almost an hour long).  I don't even mind watching it since it's got so much music.  I think the lack of Elmo and Zoe can only be a plus.

Just an update:  my son is now 27 months old and this is STILL his favorite video!  I can't believe it.  He sings and dances along with the skits now, and Ernie is his favorite Sesame Street character.",1074211200,4,789,4.125
1891536,1,B00009W0TV,"Just bought this for my 21 month old daughter, a Sesame Street Fan.  She sits glued to the TV for ""Elmopalooza"" (worth every penny).  When we got home from daycare she found the ""Put down the Ducky"" DVD on the table and insisted on watching ""Ernie"".  She couldn't contain her excitement as I unwrapped and placed the DVD in the player I recieved cheers of ""yeah, Ernie!"".  She was enthralled during the 1st number but then got up and left the room during people in the neighborhood (right around the time Barbara Walters showed up!) Then it gets worse with Ralph Nader!
Anyway to sum up, she showed interest during the few numbers that had Sesame street characters (puppets) but was disinterested in the celebrities.  I am sorry I bought it.",1061164800,9,741,4.625954198473282
1891537,5,B00009W0TV,"This is probably one of the best Sesame Street specials on video. Great songs which range from Bob doing a round of ""People in Your neighborhood"" and Patty LaBelle's ""How I Miss My Ex"" to ""Sing Your Synonyms"" (a Sesame Street remake of sorts of the classic song ""Let's Call the Whole Thing Off"") and the title song. Great clips include ""Monsterpiece Theatre"" and a segment with Grover as the bumbling waiter.
Even though kids of today might like it, I think probably those who watched the show when Jim Henson was alive (R.I.P.) would enjoy it more. Shoot, even my MOM likes it. The reasons I think younger kids wouldn't be as interested in it is because, since this video is from the 80's, Zoe and Baby Bear aren't on there, and Elmo only shows up during ""Sing Your Synonyms"". Also, it's fun for the adults to watch because of how the celebrities who on it like Barbara Walters, Rhea Perlman, Danny DeVito, and Jeremy Irons (to name a few) have changed over the years.",1059177600,9,969,4.511363636363637
1891538,5,B00009W0TV,"Okay, I was an adult when this first came out in 1987, so can fully appreciate ""Cookiegate"" with Kermit the lawyer whispering to his client (this was Iran Contra and Oliver North era). The extensive star watching will make you realize how we've all aged but not changed much (ie, Ralph Nader probably still can't sing and Rhea Perlman looks just the same).
I like and dislike the same sketches all these years later-- the Donahue interviews are too long, ""39 Stairs"" is tedious, and ""Same and Different"" is insipid. ""I love my X"" by Patti LaBelle is heartfelt, Grover's ""Numero Uno"" is classic, James Taylor and the screaming singing kids are delightful, and ""Put Down the Duckie"" is just great, especially in the reprise when Barbara Walters sings ""you've got to weave the duck a-wone!"".
But BEST of all is conductor Seiji Ozawa seriously directing the honking, clucking, bleating, meowing, and snorting All-Animal Orchestra with the infamous (and NOT creepy) Placido Flamigo. My friends used to watch ME watch this sketch because I laughed so hard. When I finally found this on VHS, I had tears running down my face before the music even started. It's simply the funniest thing I've ever seen and I LOVE IT!
Watch for the many stars, re-live the past, and let your kids enjoy.

1891539,5,B00009W0TV,"If you grew up in the first Sesame Street era or are blessed with children or grandchildren, you may remember the hilarious upbeat tune, ""Put Down the Duckie,"" that featured more than a dozen celebrities and musicians, including Paul Simon, John Candy and Danny Devito. Jazzman Hoots the Owl is teaching Ernie to play the saxophone, but Ernie won't put down his yellow rubber duckie.

Hoots sings, ""You gotta put down the duckie. Put down the duckie. Put down the duckie, if you wanna play the saxophone!""  In my management workshops, I use this DVD to illustrate the core competency in the Book Bucket, as described in my book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mastering-The-Management-Buckets-20-Critical-Competencies-for-Leading-Your-Business-or-Non-profit/dp/0830745947/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mastering The Management Buckets: 20 Critical Competencies for Leading Your Business or Non-profit</a>.

I tell business, nonprofit and church leaders, ""If you're passionate about your mission and your Big Holy Audacious Goal (BHAG), you must practice, practice and practice the art of management.""  The Bible says you must ""lay aside every weight and the sin which so easily ensnares us"" (Hebrews 12:1, NIV) if you want to lead and manage with excellence. Put down the duckie!

So...what duckie are you willing to put down today so you can pick up a book and be a leader of excellence? Mastering the 20 management buckets may seem overwhelming to your team members--maybe even to you. But, to mix metaphors, how do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time.

Add some hoopla to your next staff meeting and show this rousing sing-along video clip, ""Put Down the Duckie.""",1216080000,,1711,5.612403100775194
1891540,5,B00009W0TV,"Not only does my 18 month old son love this, but I do too!
Who needs Elmo and his modern day sesame street?
Bring back the classics!",1213315200,,132,3.925925925925926
1891541,4,B00009W0TV,"Put Down The Duckie was originally created as a PBS Pledge Drive special in 1988, and this DVD release of that special, although full of fun fare, seems a bit more dated than many of the other Sesame Street DVDs - not surprising, since the original purpose was to make a special that would encourage adult PBS viewers to pledge, rather than as a special for kids.

Guests you will remember (but your child will have no clue about) include:  Phil Donahue, tennis great Martina Navratilova, Barbara Walters, a pre-presidental run Ralph Nader, and PBS broadcaster Robert MacNeil.  The title song also features cameos by John Candy and Andrea Martin (as their SCTV characters Yosh Schmenge and Edith Prickley - FYI, Martin is still heavily involved with Sesame Street as Wanda the Word Fairy as well as the voice of the ""Lecture Lady"" featured on the TV bits during Elmo's World, but she is not recognizable as either of those characters here), Jane Curtain, Pee Wee Herman, a very young Jeremy Irons (possibly in costume as his character from Brideshead Revisited - a nod to the pledge drive audience), Jean Marsh and Gordon Jackson (as Rose and Hudson from Upstairs, Downstairs - another Masterpiece Theatre nod), Madeline Kahn, Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman, Wynton Marsalis, Itzhak Perlman, folk singer Pete Seeger, Paul Simon and Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Jazz Great Joe Williams, Cuban salsa singer Celia Cruz, then NY Mets Keith Hernandez and Mookie Wilson, and a group of players from the NY Giants.

The special opens with a great version of the Sesame Street theme song performed by Gladys Knight and the Pips, followed quickly by a long-ish bit where Phil Donahue interviews the people on the street in his trademark style.  This segment, in particular, while amusing for adults of a certain age, is very confusing for my young son, because it basically consists of a big group of people all talking loudly and all at once - a bit a chaos you don't often see on actual Sesame Street episodes of any vintage.  Next up is Monsterpiece Theater - The 39 Stairs (a sendup in black and white of the Hitchcock Classic The 39 Steps) in which Grover climbs a long flight of steps.  This is another bit that grownups will appreciate but that doesn't have much kid appeal.

MT is followed by Bob singing the classic People in your Neighborhood, the pledge-drive twist being that, here, the three people he meets are Navratilova, Walters, and Nader.  Next up is the great Put Down The Duckie, then another song - How I Miss My X wonderfully sung by Patti LaBelle.  (How I Miss My X reminds me in spirit and performance of the the performance of Don't Know Y by Norah Jones that is in current Sesame Street rotation.)  LaBelle's song is followed by a Grover-as-waiter sketch (originally from SS Episode 2122) where Charlie's has been transformed into a Spanish restaurant (and, as usual, Mr Johnson isn't going to get a decent meal from this waiter).

The song Sing Your Synonyms is next.  This is a highlight of the video, featuring Luis and Maria as a couple in an art gallery, with Susan, Gordon, Telly, Elmo, and Bob (as a sculpture of Atlas!) appearing inside the art.  This is followed by a news segment (with Robert MacNeil) about ""Cookiegate"", where Kermit appears as Cookie Monster's attorney - another bit that has far more appeal for adults than for kids.

Finally, James Taylor performs Jellyman Kelly (another highlight), and Placido Flamingo appears with an all animal symphony in Pretty Great Performances.

Overall, as a fan of The Muppets, this is a great video for adults.  However, I think it does the material and the kids a disservice to market it as a video for kids alongside the other Sesame Street video offerings.  Because it was originally created as a pledge drive special, it has a much more adult tone than most of the other current Sesame Street compilation DVDs currently in the marketplace.  Testing it with my own 18 month old son, he was quickly bored with it, while his father and I were giggling at many of the bits.

In short, Mom and Dad - buy this for yourself.  Watch it after the kids go to bed, and have a bit of nostalgia for yourself",1200960000,5,4171,4.709766162310866

1891543,5,B00009W0TV,"I got this for my Dad for Valentine's Day and it was a great time to watch it again. Such was Jim Henson's fame for family and children entertainment that if the request came to you to be on Sesame Street or even The Muppet Show, it was really a simple choice.

The special is really not meant for children but rather for adults, since most of the guests are ones children are not familiar with. It's also fun to see people like Ralph Nader and Barbara Walters poking fun and getting poked in return.

The entire show is fantastic, but the best two clips are ""Put Down the Duckie"" and Seiji Ozawa's conducting the Muppet Orchestra in ""Pretty Great Performances....he really is a good sport. Overall, a excellent tribute to the Classic Sesame Street and to Jim Henson.",1175817600,,767,4.510791366906475

1891546,2,B00009W0TV,"I just got this in the mail today.  I was thrilled and excited to put it in, especially after all the great reviews.

One word to sum it up:  eh.

The first few minutes of the DVD is all introductory stuff.  Almost like you're watching the previews waiting for it to start, but it's part of the video.  So that made it even shorter than the description because it was just people talking.  Not really many characters.

The Put Down the Duckie song gets 2 stars.  The rest of the footage doesn't even get any stars.  Yes there are a few random old-school skits.  But when I say a few, I mean VERY few.  Like, 2?  And I would think they could have chosen better ones...

I watched the whole thing, sort of with out emotion, and then it abruptly was over.  And you're watching like ""It's OVER?  That's IT?""

If it was longer, or less money, I would have given it more stars.  But for $12, there was definitely not enough quality footage and not nearly enough material to make it worth it.

I am sorry I bought this.",1147824000,,1012,4.231578947368421

7993338,3,B00009W0TV,"I should have read the reviews before buying this video. There was nothing wrong with it, but I bought it for my two year old, and didn't realize this was more for nostalgic adults. It's got some funny parts, but it's mostly just scenes with (older) famous actors/singers and long drawn out skits that focus more on the starring extra then our sesame friends.

I got this DVD because I know from raising six children that Sesame Street is wholesome and because I want him to develop a really nice range of musical-listening adventures.  Wow!  It was the best DVD.  Killian (the two-year-old) absolutely loved it.  When it ended and the credits were rolling, he said, ""play it again, Gi-Gi"".  He dances to it, sings along, and loves every second of it.  Seeing him so animated and happy makes me happy, too.  He's not just increasing his scope of musiscal pleasure, he's dancing, too.
