8091957,5,B000BT96LY,"Its strange to think that this film is based on a comic book hero. Today Spider Man and Superman are almost supernaturally powerful beings. This guy simply  helps children out and does skywriting in his plane. The fact that adventures happen and he is able to save they day is almost accidental. Whiel this is not usually my cup of tea I liked it because it showed me a different type of hero and is not as overblown as his modern counterparts. This is certainly a  novelty film, but a  good one.",1148342400,3,496,4.369565217391305
