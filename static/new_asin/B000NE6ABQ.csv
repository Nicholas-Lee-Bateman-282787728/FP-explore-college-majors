8527113,5,B000NE6ABQ,"Brings back great memories of my childhood. My parents bought this VHS when I was about 6, and over the years we wore the thing out. Amazing skits that kept us laughing, from the oldest to the youngest. All good, family friendly fun. Wish they'd put these on DVD, since I have never seen any of these skits anywhere but this tape. If you have a VCR, this is definitely worth looking into.",1419292800,,388,4.328767123287672
