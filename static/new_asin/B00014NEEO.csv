8006371,1,B00014NEEO,I would not recommend this video unless you want to try to understand conspiracy theory.,1253318400,,88,4.933333333333334
8006372,5,B00014NEEO,"First, to let you know I did not buy this dvd, it was given to me free, by someone who I did not know (divine order?) while at a shop. I enjoyed it very much.  In fact I watched it 3x.  He explained evolution and the mayan calendar and how things progressed since the beginning of time - it made perfect sense to me.

Don't let the one star narrow minded people ever discourage you from exploring something you may find interesting.",1252713600,,432,4.2439024390243905
8006373,1,B00014NEEO,"I thought this would be a very interesting dvd that would detail with a degree of accuracy the Mayan calendar but found it very repetative, poor video quality and totally lousy.
It seems more of a scam than a tool to improve ones knowledge of the mystery.",1252108800,,255,4.446808510638298
8006374,3,B00014NEEO,"This presentation unveils some fairly new information about the levels of consciousness represented in the Mayan pyramidal structures and in the inscriptions found on various objects.  It is somewhat repetitive and the prophecies and assumptions made by the presentor(s) are mixed between truthful, assumption and already missed predictions.  Adding the information to other existing material is worthwhile.  If nothing else the accumulated body of work on the subject is enhanced by this presentation.  At least it is evident that something is happening in the Universe.  And, that people who have the slightest mental capacity need to continue searching for what it is.  Human kind may still have the option to pursue one of the two roads offered to us before it is too late to change the eventuality of our current path.  The Mayan Calendar and prophecies are at least one major piece of this puzzle. Build on what you learn from this video.",1200614400,3,944,5.090909090909091
8006375,5,B00014NEEO,"First let me say that I am a scientist and an engineer and that I am normally the kind of guy that is skeptical about this sort of thing, but after viewing this DVD, I was blown away with the accuracy of what i was seeing.  Ian, (May he Rest in Peace) is masterful at communicating a difficult subject matter and making it easy to understand for most people.  Once you view this DVD, you will have a clearer understanding of what is going on and what will go on.  The Consciousness will move on regardless of how many people try and stand in its way. One can only hope humanity will get this information in time. The planet has been long overdue for a spiritual cleansing unlike it has ever seen before. Thank you Maddy and Michael for keeping Ian's vision alive. Peace",1167091200,18,769,4.326388888888889
8006376,1,B00014NEEO,"When will people stop with all the UFO/ConspiracyTheory/superstitious ignorance?!?!? The maya calender was nothing more than a calender - a marvelous and impressive achievement without a doubt - but just a calender all the same. This video and all the other related ilk is no better than ignorant spittle from those too lazy to study the facts and accept the truth of science.

I couldn't submit this reveiw without a star rating - it really deserves no mention/no stars.",1103587200,6,471,4.962025316455696
8006377,5,B00014NEEO,Bear with the low production values and get an excellent presentation of some mind blowing information.  Ian Lungold does a masterful job of presenting the true meaning of the Mayan Calendar.  Ian and Carl Calleman have cracked the code and 16.4 billion years of precise patterns in the history of our universe are revealed in a very simple and understandable way.  This is exciting and important information.  A must see DVD.  I cannot recommend it highly enough....,1093996800,21,467,5.012987012987013
