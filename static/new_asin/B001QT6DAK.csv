3770318,1,B001QT6DAK,the previews were great so i decided to buy this dvd i wished that i could also return it this movie really is bad i am all for black movies but sometime you need to think twice before releasing it to the public,1269043200,10,211,3.9302325581395348
3770319,5,B001QT6DAK,"REVELATION!!!!!  Why? Marriage is a SPIRITUAL UNION between a man and his wife.  It is God that ordains marriage, therefore, ANY MAN LACKING THIS REVELATION IS BOTH SPIRITUALLY BLINDED & SPIRTUALLY LOST!  After all, is not sex the  universal confirmation/consummation for marriage.  I believe this dvd to be a GREAT conversational discussion for both married and soon-to-be married couples.",1268352000,14,390,5.5423728813559325
3770320,1,B001QT6DAK,This was the worst tape I have purchased.  I would not even call it a movie because it is not. The write up on the box is nothing like it is... i would never have bought this DUMB ass movie.  Please do not spend your money on it if .  I wish something was wrong with it other than that so I could return it and get my money back.,1266192000,5,329,3.6714285714285713

3770322,2,B001QT6DAK,I reviewed this movie on an online website and I can not for the life of me figure out why I purchased it. This is another very low-budget film with poor-acting and scripting. I did not like it at all. I am a big advocate of black movies (especially classics) and I try to give some of them a chance; but some of them just don't deserve it.,1261094400,13,340,4.014705882352941
3770323,1,B001QT6DAK,"This movie was horrible. It sends bad messages throughout. This couple is engaged - one is a christian the other isn't. They are to abstain from sex during premarital counseling yet share the same bed. What true christian would be engaged to a non-believer. The temptation is more than the man can stand. Understandably so. He's getting all hot and steamed up living with his fiance with no outlet. Then she takes him back in the end after he cheats on her and denies any infidelity after she repeatedly asks him. What a joke. Not in the real world. So this man gets his cake and gets to eat it to. If you just ask god forgiveness he will make everything right. WRONG  He will forgive you , but you reap what you sow.",1246838400,18,717,4.350746268656716
3770324,1,B001QT6DAK,the preview of this movie was the best part.  i understand the story but im really sorry i purchased this video. if i could return it i would.,1244332800,11,142,4.071428571428571
3770325,5,B001QT6DAK,I really like this movie I will watch more then 5 times. It's a story about a woman name Lauren who was in a relationship with a guy who loved . They where different in many ways Lauren was religious He hadn't got there yet. He did love her alot. I think they didn't talk a lot before they decide to get engage. It's really good to see relationships how they play out.,1241481600,11,368,4.054794520547945

3770330,3,B001QT6DAK,The title of this movie brings you to think something else. I won't tell the plot of this movie. I will say that there is a second one. Its a movie that you and your partner will injoy watching. If your good at guessing the ending plot.,1316217600,,236,4.042553191489362
3770331,3,B001QT6DAK,"......delivered in good condition and on time - a not too bad
movie to watch though the story line is not that well followed.  Maybe their next movie will be better than this.

I thank you.",1305504000,3,189,4.222222222222222
3770332,2,B001QT6DAK,"When one buys a low budget film, you have to remember that is exactly what it is.  But it doesn't stop the interest in it.  This movie was disappointing and confusing.  The bible verse is He who finds a Wife finds a good thing. The name of the movie would confuse anyone. Maybe you guys were going somewhere else with this title. It should have been named ""He Who Finds a Woman""",1300060800,,378,4.222222222222222

3770334,1,B001QT6DAK,I borrowed this movie from a friend. This was one of the worst movies that I've ever seen in my life. The actors/actresses could not act. I can act better than they can and I haven't even been to acting school. I laughed so hard in the scene where the preacher was preaching. He read everything off the script and could barely keep his eyes on the congregation from reading his scripted sermon. Looked like he didn't even try to rememeber his lines. Save your money. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE! Unless you don't mind watching a bootleg/low budget movie.,1296518400,3,548,4.49
3770335,2,B001QT6DAK,"I have seen low budget movies that I love and then there is this one.  We know the story line from the title.  However the acting was blah.  I might have given it another star if the movie was not so dirty for a Christian movie.  I would have like to watch this film with my children, but there was some inapproipate scene here and there.",1287014400,3,338,4.075757575757576

8336223,3,B001QT6DAK,"Great story, good script, challenging acting. Director got some good performances but  other times the actors struggled. Female lead did well. Male lead had good parts. Conversations didn't flow naturally. Director missed the opportunity to challenge actors to flow through their scenes. Some choppy sections. Enjoyed the story, tho! Keep working on your craft team.
