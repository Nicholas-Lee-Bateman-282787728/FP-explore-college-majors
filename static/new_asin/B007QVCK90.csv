There are more plot twists than a bag of licorice but because it's in French, the action is cruel yet you keep rooting for the good guys who are only slightly better than the bad guys.  .",1389398400,4,312,4.379310344827586
5105007,5,B007QVCK90,"I ordered these because Jean-Hugues Anglade is my favorite actor. After watching season 1 I feel in love with the series! I was looking for a show that would pull me in like The Sopranos did. And this did!!! I don't mind the subtitles, but I know alot of people do. If they don't bother you. Definitely check out this series!!!",1372204800,3,327,4.377049180327869

5105016,5,B007QVCK90,Camu would be proud of this series! The undercurrent of the existential is overwhelming. This applies equally to the first season.,1396051200,,130,5.238095238095238

8521079,5,B007QVCK90,"I really love this series. It reminds a lot of The Shield (as opposed to say, Engrenages (Spiral) which I also liked a lot but which was more like a gritty French version of Law and Order). I wish I could understand the language better but let's just say they don't talk like my French professor. Very fast, lots of yelling and screaming, and a fair amount of street slang thrown in for good measure so I have to rely on the subtitles but even so I'd recommend it highly for those who enjoy this sort of cop action drama with a French twist.",1530144000,,541,4.211538461538462
8521080,4,B007QVCK90,"This French series is quite violent. It handles mature audience subjects, and in the first season  gave this particular police group a bad name. After you get to know a few of these police officers, they are not likable, but have some redeeming qualities. This is a rogue group of policemen who were not been reigned in soon enough, and do their own thing.

The four police agents in the Hauts-de-Seine area of Paris are Eddy Caplan, played by Jean-Hugues Anglade, Walter Morlighem, played by Joseph Malerba, Th&eacute;o Vachewski, played by Nicolas Duvauchelle, and Roxanne Delgado, played by Karol Rocher. Their colleague Max Rossi was accused of criminal misconduct, and committed suicide.

In the second series, the four police have been arrested for crimes off trying to kill a bad guy. Many of the upper echelon seem to be in the wrong side except for a new investigator Marceau.
A plan takes the fall goes to jail, Roxanne is demoted and Theo is fired as well as Walter. Life is horrible for all. Another rogue gang has arrived causing havoc and many deaths. Marceau gives Vaplan, Roxanne and Theo amnesty to join a team fighting this new mercenary group. All hell breaks lose, but at least they are doing police work, even though undercover work is much more dangerous.

Series 2 is much more interesting, great writing and acting.

Recommended. prisrob 06-25-17",1498348800,,1370,4.887931034482759
8521081,5,B007QVCK90,"This is a great French LEO Series. The unit's personnel are hindered by the entanglements brought about by Napoleonic Law, and it's interpretation in French society ... the 21st Century. To add to those problems, the show's characters tend to go rogue --- just to avoid corruption in their department, with government officials at all levels ... including various Ministerial Divisions.
  Wiki  ""Senior ministers are titled as Ministers, whereas junior ministers are titled as Secretaries of State. A smaller and more powerful executive body, called the Council of Ministers, is composed only of the senior ministers, though some Secretaries of State may attend Council meetings. The Council of Ministers is chaired by the President of the Republic",1470873600,,748,5.3760683760683765

8521083,5,B007QVCK90,Season 2 is superb. It has many twists and turns with ultimately only 4 good cops trusting only themselves. I will say as exceptional as this drama was the ending is truly disturbing. But you can't win 'em all,1440201600,,209,4.384615384615385
