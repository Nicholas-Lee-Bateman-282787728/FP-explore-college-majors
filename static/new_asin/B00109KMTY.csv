8237457,5,B00109KMTY,Djavan has quietly made his mark with those who love modern Brazilian music and is one of Brazil's greatest composers and singers.  His compositions are played by many world artists; his melodies are romantic and moving and Djavan's voice is simply beautiful and passionate. He's been around since the early 70's and has a respectable discography.  I highly recommend this DVD where you can see the above in action.,1247875200,,415,5.0
