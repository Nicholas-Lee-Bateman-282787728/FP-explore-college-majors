One way to put a stop to these rip off merchants RELEASE IT NOW !!!  One would of thought the with the release of the book on the Yosemite killer ( the brother of steven stayner) this would of been re-released but obviously not.....that would just make good marketing sense.",1208822400,6,495,4.380434782608695
1394485,4,B000055YXJ,"What is most amazing about this story is that Steven escaped from his kidnapper, then was killed in a motorcycle accident years later.  Then a few years after this movie was released, Steven's older brother Kerry was sentenced to death as a serial killer, commonly known as the Yosemete strangler.

Amazing tragedy to affect one family.",1167955200,8,336,4.982142857142857
1394486,4,B000055YXJ,"Are they Ever going to rerelease this on DVD. they need to bring it out again. i know its a good movie. I seen it back in 1989 when it first appeared on TV, John AShton stars as Del Stayner, the father. i beleive it starts out with him home that day  in 77, when he wrote his name on the garage, and  then he goes to school that another day , and  then he never makes it home being kidnapped by Parnell and Murphy. the guy  who plays Parnell is  a good actor. Steven is with Parnell for a long 7 years. he finally escapes when Parnell tries to kidnap another boy  7 to be his brother. and then Steven finally makes it home.  They really need to re release this. If any one hears anything, please let me know.",1151884800,9,708,3.978723404255319
1394487,4,B000055YXJ,"This is the story of a little boy who was kidnapped by a pedofile posing to be a minister.  He changed his hair color and told him name was something else and moved far away from his home and told him that his parents didn't want him anymore because he was so bad...He thought it was because he carved his name into the garage door.  So ""Reverand Parnell"" spends the next 7 years molesting him over and over along with other boys as they move from town to town.  At some point and time, I believe Steven is 13 or 14 years old, he gets away when Parnell tries to kidnap a ""little brother"" for him.  The sad thing is that this is a true story.  When Steven is returned home to his real family, adjusting to a life of discipline is hard and the trial was explicit.  After all that, Steven dies in a car wreck only 3 years after the movie aired and Parnell is a free man somewhere probably still molesting boys and posing as an preacher.",1141776000,3,933,4.155555555555556

1394563,5,B000055YXJ,Saw this movie on TV years ago. It made me cry. As a sexual abuse victum myself i could So relate to it. I was never kidnapped but I was sexually abused. My heart went out to this kid Steven. This movie is excellent. worth buying.,1459987200,4,230,4.021739130434782
1394564,5,B000055YXJ,"When it comes to 'Made for TV' movies, you typically expect mediocre acting, cinematography, etc. Not so with this film. The story would captivate you (in a horrifying way) simply by it being a true story, but the creators of this film did not rest on that at all. The actors playing Steven are superb in their roles. The make-up and wardrobe crews did a fantastic job of bringing the physical and mental anguish of this child's situation to glaring reality on screen. I think another commentor mentioned the circles under a young Steven's eyes. It is this attention to detail, along with that solid acting ability, that makes this particular retelling of a true story SO impactful for the audience. Allowing us to continue Steven's story into his readjustment into 'normal' life really brings home the full effect of child abuse in a way other movies of this nature never have. This is truly an amazing story showing how child abuse will affect a person long after childhood is over.",1450224000,,984,4.760233918128655

1394627,5,B000055YXJ,"A wonderfully told account of Steven Stayner's kidnapping and return.  The movie speaks for itself.  I saw it when it originally aired on TV and the storytelling is just as powerful today as it was 25 years ago.  The production may seem a bit dated by today's standards but the overall quality is there.

I'll spend most my time reviewing the actual DVD itself since plenty of others on here have already talked about how great the movie is.  After searching around online a bit to find a copy I was a little hesitant to order it through the Amazon Archive collection where it is manufactured on a DVD-R.  Let me just say that the product quality is top notch all the way around!  Although not packaged as fancy as a big Hollywood blockbuster, the product is completely professionally made in every way.  The case and sleeve look great.  It is a 2-disc set; it's a long movie so it's split across two DVDs .  As someone who works in television I have to say that I was most impressed with the picture and sound quality.  The transfer looks great and you can really appreciate how well shot the movie really is.  It is in the 4:3 aspect ratio since it was originally produced for standard def TV.  The soundtrack is really clean and clear and sounds great on nice speakers.  I think this is really the only way you can own this movie in a digital format, so don't think your getting something less by purchasing this release.  It's a tragic story, but the price is right and you won't be disappointed.",1428192000,2,1500,4.443223443223443

1394630,5,B000055YXJ,"Everything in this movie is all true. You all can look it up on Google.

Steven Staynor was kidnapped at the age of seven, and was raped, abused, neglected, and raised by his kidnapper as his son When Steven was fourteen, Kevin Parnell (his kidnapper) kidnapped another child, Timmy White, who was five years old, planning on doing the same thing to Timmy that he did to Steven. So, Steven ran away with Timmy, to save Timmy from the life that he had.

Later (after the movie takes place), Steven Staynor's older brother, Cary Staynor, was exposed as a serial killer.

Steven died a few years after he escaped from his kidnapper (from an accident).

Timmy White died at the age of 35.

But Kevin Parnell lived to be a very old man.",1420329600,,731,4.466165413533835

1394700,5,B000055YXJ,"Even though this movie aired years ago I remembered it VERY WELL. I believed it could prove extremely productive to share with a rebellious young girl. She's dressing provocatively, and making herself appear promiscuous on her Facebook page, even though she's never been sexually active. These actions are the result of her neglectful, abusive father. When her positive efforts to gain his attention failed she turned to negative behavior in the hopes of any male attention. My continued warnings that she was setting herself up to be raped or abducted were to no avail, In obtaining this movie, for her to watch, she quietly chose to watch it three times back to back! I thank you for helping me to put the fear of God in her before it was too late; God bless you. - Minister Deborah Bacon",1409961600,,790,4.690647482014389

Seven-year-old Steven Stayner was taken on his way home from school by a degenerate who convinced the boy his parents had abandoned him. Subjected to years of lies and sexual abuse, Steven was numbed into submission.

Then, when Steven was 14, his abductor brought home 5-year-old Timmy - and Steven found the courage to escape with the child, whose tragic future he could foresee only too well.

Could he find his real family? And, if he did, could they ever be a family again? I Know My First Name Is Steven will break your heart, then heal it.",1392076800,2,648,4.436974789915967

1394767,5,B000055YXJ,"First of all, this excellent film (originally made for TV) is NOT suitable for viewing by children.  Some reviewers have described
it as a cautionary tale which they intend to show their young children.  Please do NOT show this (even to a preteen) until
you have previewed it first.  This is a sensitive depiction, with excellent performances, of the tragic life of Steven Stayner,
kidnapped at age seven and sexually abused for years by his kidnapper. Although not always graphic, the film manages to
convey the horrific circumstances of Steven's life after his kidnapping.  I first saw this film on TV years ago and it has lost
none of its power.  The second half of the film, after Steven (at age 14) returns home through a dramatic series of events which
are absolutely true,  is not at all anti-climactic.  Unlike many fictional films about kidnap victims, Steven does not easily
assimilate back into a ""normal"" life.  I've never seen actor Corin Nemic in any other role.....but he makes an indelible impression
as Steven Stayner.  He flawlessly portrays Steven's struggles to cope with the aftermath of the kidnapping, including feelings of guilt and anger.  He finds love but also sees justice denied.  Arliss Howard chose to be uncredited for his role as the
kidnapper; he's a very good actor and is the embodiment of evil in this film.  Highly recommended.",1365984000,16,1365,4.9126637554585155

Focusing on a sensetive subject of child kiddnaping, the actors/actoress give wonderful performance.  Althought the ending of the story isn't some what satisfactory, but overall, its a good piece of drama that will make you think....",1333411200,,402,4.882352941176471
1394854,5,B000055YXJ,"Wow! This is such a good movie! So sad to see what really happens out there. While it's hard to watch I still believe that all parents and children (once they're a little older and understand) should watch this. I have this movie on VHS, it's back from 1990, my mother recorded it one day when it was on TV. But I've just recently watched it and when my girls are older, I'll let them watch it too if they want. I personally believe it's good for kids to see that this happens. We can't shelter them so much that they are too naive when it comes to some things. I saw someone's review say it's not for anyone under 18, but it's not like the movie shows what happened to this poor child, but it does tell you what happened. Kids under the age of 18 know what all of this stuff is, and if watching something like this will help my children be more cautious and aware of their surroundings, know more reasons as to why they shouldn't talk to strangers and knowing that there are creeps and evil people out there in the world I definitely won't be denying the chance to show them by letting them watch this. This movie is powerful, I highly recommend it.",1331251200,2,1150,4.2318181818181815
1394855,5,B000055YXJ,This movie is based on a true story where 7 year old boy is kidnapped by a child molester.  It is a very touching movie as well. A must see!!!,1327795200,,142,3.7333333333333334
1394856,1,B000055YXJ,"I have seen this movie on TV and although it was good I would never allow my kid to be in such a movie to expose perverts that kidnap a young boy and do despicable things to the child (I won't elaborate.) The word molest says it all. It is too bad the movie was made, because this is permanent documentation to the young male actor and the adult actors casted in the role of kidnappers. This is not a filmography to be proud of. The parents of the young boy must of been paid very well to secure the acting services of this young boy. I hope any future parent who cares about their children think twice before allowing any of their children to be casted in a similar movie like this.
ADDENDUM: I have read some of the criticisms to this review. Anyway, my remarks still stand. Anytime a person writes or says something that goes outside the boundaries of accepted opinions (of general tribal thinking) then you will get flack and even disparaging names. If I am to be the only person to give a two-star rating to this movie, then so be it. Here is my response that is short and sweet. ""I have read your letter, thank you for sharing. Now it is behind me. God bless and have a nice day.""",1321142400,,1186,4.229074889867841
1394857,5,B000055YXJ,"As great and ""educational"" as I've always believed this movie is, I think the writers should of taken a closer look at the book; particularly regarding Steven's last day before he was kidnapped. In the film his last day is him getting in trouble with his father for not coming straight home and his father's last sentence to him being ""Son, don't ever make me sorry I didn't whip you here tonight."" In the book however, which is collaborated by Steven himself and the rest of the Stayner family, Steven's last day is nothing like it. It's a happy one with him going to a friend's birthday party and having the time of his life, him having a jovial conversation with his mother in the car afterwards about what he wants for Christmas, and him spending the rest of the evening at home snuggling with his father and Del delighting in his son's wonder. The writers should of made the film's beginning more like that just to add a little happiness to it before the dark story emerges.

Secondly, the critics gave all the credit to Corin Nemec about portraying Steven and totally ignored Luke Edwards. To me, that sucks all! Luke not only gives an extraordinary performance, but portrays the most intense part of the story which is being kidnapped as a little boy. So what if Luke was unknown at the time and maybe still is? That's no reason to ignore his performance.

I KNOW MY FIRST NAME IS STEVEN is a landmark TV movie that should of received more credit than it did. As I recall it received lots of Emmy nominations and lost practically all of them. Emmys should of gone to all the principle actors; starting with Luke Edwards. One of the great things about this is Steven was around to see it all come to life.

1394860,5,B000055YXJ,"I second all the reviewers who praise the performances and the importance of this movie. It illustrates a typical abductor's methods of snatching, indoctrinating and abusing a child, and the after-effects on the victim, family and community. Despite some whiffs of Lorimar cheeziness, the movie rings true and--tragically--has since been borne out by other such incidents. However, I found IKMFNIS to be the opposite of ""healing,"" as some have called it. Knowing how troubled Steven's life was after his escape and what ultimately happened to him renders the closing shot almost unbearably painful. Even so, though Steven's own children aren't portrayed in the movie, we know that he lived long enough to learn first-hand how much children mean to their parents.",1313625600,,762,5.305785123966942

1394862,5,B000055YXJ,"A movie as never affected me so deeply and made me feel in a way that I can't put into words.

Watching this movie as affected my life in a positive way and changed my outlook on life.

I feel that this movie is deeply emotional, if you had a difficult childhood yourself, it might even help you emotionally, like it did me.

At the end of this film tears were running down my eyes...

1394931,5,B000055YXJ,"I believe this story was great; I saw it MANY many years ago on tv and wanted it on disc, but it was only available on tv whenever it would show. I realize it's an old movie, but I think it should always be shown and parents should discuss it. While it's not an After School Special, it's still very important to show.
  I believe the actors did a great job in the portrayal of Steven's story. I admire Steven for his courage; I hope to name my future son after him, no foolin'.",1294099200,3,478,4.074468085106383
1394932,5,B000055YXJ,"When I first watched this movie as a 10-year old in 1989 I was blown away. At the time I didn't really know what child molesting and rape really were and this movie helped introduce me to the concepts although nothing graphic was really shown. This in my opinion was one of the best TV movies ever made. All the actors did an amazing job.
I was rooting Steven on from his first experiences as a child into young adulthood. It was easy to feel his fear, anger, betrayal by others, pain and joy. Being reunited with his real family was bittersweet as even though they were happy to be together again, he chafed under having to live once again in a home with rules and boundaries. That caused frequent arguments among the family as well his his father refusing to want to talk about Steven being molested. When he was with Parnell, he did whatever he wanted including smoking and drinking alcohol.
I was so furious that the perverted Parnell got away with his evil actions for so long and he originally served such a short prison term. And the real Parnell was much more sinister and scary than the actor who portrayed him in the movie. I'm glad that he finally got what was coming to him and spent his remaining days in prison. And then there was Murph: I had hopes when he picked up the phone to call the police about Steven's kidnapping but when he chickened out I was like ""booo!!!!"". I was upset by little Steve's school counselor who didn't really listen or seemed to care about when he was trying to tell her about the truth about himself and Parnell.",1285286400,4,1555,4.421602787456446
1394933,5,B000055YXJ,"I became interested in this case from the beginning, as relatives of mine lived
across the street from the Stayner family in Merced at that time.  I have a cable VHS copy of
this fine film, and am glad to see it is now on DVD.  It is a riveting account of
one of the most horrendous kidnappings of our time.  Even though the film ends on
a hopeful note, unfortunately it ultimately ended tragically for almost everyone
involved, while the perpetrator, Mr. Parnell received far too lenient treatment.
I wonder if the DVD adds any footnotes as to the sad fates of both victims, which
occurred well after the TV movie aired.",1283299200,17,621,4.477876106194691

1394935,5,B000055YXJ,"During 1972 when Steven Stayner was seven, a pedophile (Kenneth Parnell) in cahoots with another (Robert Murphy) who only helps in kidnapping Steven Stayner. It is a shocking true story of the notorious case of the kidnapping of Steven Stayner where Steven had been kidnapped for seven years and during that time his abductor (Parnell) had forced the young Steven Stayner into submission as well as brainwashing him. Everything changed when Kenneth Parnell, Steven Stayner's abductor, seven years later abducts another boy Timmy White and fourteen year-old Steve Stayner rescues Timmy white from Kenneth Parnell. Then Parnell is later arrested after Steve Stayner identifies himself to authorities and then later Murphy was subsequently arrested as well. Afterward, Steven Stayner struggles with realization of the confrontation Kenneth Parrell in and outside of court and  the public exposure of sexual molestation. A great and alarming true story about the kidnapping and exploitation of children.",1271289600,16,999,5.572368421052632

There is actually a passage in the movie where Steven upon his return asks where his older brother is and his mom replies he's at Yosemite; ""he loves it there.""  Now I just found out that the LA County Deputy Sheriff Timothy White, who died this past week was the 5-year-old boy kidnapped by Ken Parnell and saved by Steven Stayner.  How tragic.

However, the dvd quality is superb.  There are no extras on the dvd- a disappointment since the movie is so well made.  However, the strength of the film stands on its own.  Performances by ALL actors are top notch.  The 2 actors portraying Steve (Luke Edwards and Corin Nemec) are unsurpassd. Watching  Luke Edward's character transformation from ""Stevie"" (innocent and naive), to ""Steve"" mentally abused, sexually molested, a cigarette smoking 7 year old with dark circles under his eyes is a haunting experience.
