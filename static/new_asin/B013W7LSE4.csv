7373825,4,B013W7LSE4,"I like these home invasion movies and at first I wasn't too keen on this one. It was okay. The acting was pretty good and there were some good moments of suspense, but it was a little dull. But the story definitely picks up in the second half and really ramps up in the third act. It was worth the wait to see the violence unfold. So yeah, its pretty shaky at first but definitely finds its pace as it goes on. Patience will be rewarded well. 3.5/5",1444953600,7,448,4.1022727272727275
7373826,3,B013W7LSE4,"Kelly (Kaya Scodelario) who is athletic, sneaks into the bedroom of her boyfriend Mark (Daniel Boyd). Mom doesn't like her. She stocks shelves at the super market. Bad guys break in, tie up the family while Kelly hides. That's about it. Typical home break in. It adds a crossbow. The film centers on Kelly who got into the role. Good acting, but do we need another flat plot home break-in?

Recommend watching ""Trespass"" instead.

7373837,4,B013W7LSE4,"The plot of Tiger House is one that the average movie viewer has seen over and over- home invasion a la Panic Room, Purge, Funny Games, The Strangers, ect.  That said, it is thoroughly watchable with a few twists you won't see coming.  Kaya Scodelario is excellent as the one person in the house the bad guys can't seem to track down and deal with, though she spends much of the first half of the film hiding under a bed.  Dougray Scott's talents are pretty much wasted as a leader of the gang- he gets severely injured right off the bat and spends most of the movie atop said bed.  The second half of the movie makes up for the drawn-out nature of the first half.  There's much more action and the twists come in to play, Kaya's character fairly admitting that she doesn't know who to trust anymore.  It's well worth a watch despite its well-worn format.",1455840000,2,855,4.379746835443038

7373846,3,B013W7LSE4,"This was a pretty good home invasion flick. Granted it wasn't the best but it did have great acting. Two relationship misfortunes thrown in the mix and a twist.

It was somewhat like You're Next in that when the home invasion occurred the son's girlfriend (Kara Scodelario) had sneaked in and so no one knew she was there but the boyfriend and the mother. She hid and  when opportunities presented themselves she kind of went ninja girl on the bad guys.

There wasn't any gore but there was some brutal violence. Stand outs were Dougray Scott and Kara Scodelario but all were effective. It's not going to satisfy a hardcore Horror fan but it will serve as entertainment for lovers of One location thrillers.",1446508800,7,707,4.685483870967742

8728973,1,B013W7LSE4,"Well, what to say about this film....?  Tiger House is a film that legitimately tries, yet fails on so many levels...  The script is so horrible, I just kept shaking my head, vicariously embarrassed for the writer over the contrivances, the genre-negating hollow characters, the cliches... And the writer shouldn't bear all the blame - the director developed a visual interpretation; the director doesn't take dictates from the writer in terms of shots.

The film starts immediately doing the exact opposite for building character motivation and an emotional rationale for the audience.  Kelly is victimized first scene by characters we're supposed to care about later in the film; then it happens again and again before the actual main conflict begins.  When I first see robbers taking over the house, I'm already at the point where I want to see her boyfriend suffer a beat-down - that never happens.

And Kelly as the Femme Fatale; this is never realized...she doesn't use her specialized skills to defeat her adversaries - the camera shots are continuously showing her narrowly avoiding the robbers by accident - e.g., she pulls herself into the attic just before one of the robbers randomly enters the room; a shot more akin to the horror genre.  And she is discovered, multiple times by the leader of the robbers who helps her.....why?  Nonsense.

And in the end, the chance for the victims to learn from their wrongs, they are still oblivious - indeed, they lost all sense, essentially thanking her by sending her away, to disappear with stolen money.  It's the best for everyone.....makes sense when, for absolutely no reason, the film had mentioned early on she's pregnant with her boyfriend's child...  It's best she live in secrecy with stolen money as a single mother whose skills are competitive gymnastics and the use of an antique crossbow......wtf?

Watch this movie only if you want to learn many examples of how a film can fail; otherwise, pass on this garbage.",1507939200,,1979,4.981762917933131
8728974,1,B013W7LSE4,"It's frustrating when you have a uniformly good cast and a sizzle-reel director who work mightily to reign in the mediocracies of the script. But the script's not just threadbare-- it's bald --huge swaths of information missing. Add to this a female character who is supposed to be the lead and she's made mute by being given so few lines and motivations. Add to that the film's insistence that all a wayward girl needs is a baby (not even a mission or a man) and her future is golden! No claws here, sadly.",1495497600,,507,4.462365591397849
8728975,4,B013W7LSE4,"I am going to call it as I see it and I see it as a very entertaining movie and the fact that this is a plot that we have seen this a million times it makes no difference. The cast is superb and justified I their performances. Kaya Scodelario as the ""no account and not worthy of their son's attention girlfriend"" who is solely responsible for the helping her boyfriend and his family out of a very sticky situation where we have a bunch of bad guys who break into their house and hold them hostage and ransom. Ed Skrein and Dougray Scott as the band guys are credible and even frightening. I really won't say too much because even though we have seen this before we have not seen this level of intensity and a few surprises too. Without a doubt this is worth the view.",1495411200,,769,4.202702702702703

8728980,3,B013W7LSE4,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Once again low budget film makers have created an interesting film that rivals some major releases when it comes to creativity. The end result may not be the greatest movie ever made but at least you have a group here making an attempt at something new. With the loss of drive-ins across the country as well as double features a thing of the past, direct to DVD is the only way these independent films get made. And on occasion you get something decent.

Kaya Scodelario stars as Kelly, a young girl desperately in love with boyfriend Mark. But Marks mother isn't fond of the young girl, seeing her as someone from the wrong side of the tracks and just trying to latch on to her son. So the pair do what any young couple does, she sneaks into his bedroom at night via the second floor window. Their romance takes a dive when Kelly reveals to Mark that she is pregnant, something hes not too happy about.

That night gets worse as the pair are surprised by the sound of someone in the house other than his parents. Checking things out Mark finds a group of kidnappers in the house who take him and his mother hostage and his father, a banker, to the bank as a plan to rob it. Kelly, aware of what is going on first tries to get out the window forgetting that Mark locked it the night before and has the key on him. She quickly hides beneath his bed and tries to figure out just what to do.

An altercation resulted in the leader of the gang Shane (Dougray Scott) being severely wounded. He sends part of the team with the father and two men stay with him. Of course, the bed they choose to leave him in is Marks.

As the movie progresses Kelly is left to her own devices to find a way to either get help or take on this trio of bad guys before the rest of the gang returns. Rather than go the route of DIE HARD ingenuity or Rube Goldberg contraptions, the screenwriters here have Kelly employ whatever she has on hand to her advantage. Her first feat is to get out from under the bed and make her way around the house. Then she begins to find ways to deal with the problem first hand.

This would make the film a variation of the hostage turned heroine but rather than leave it at that more complex situations are brought into the mix. A secret that turns the story on its head late in the game comes off surprising but in review makes sense. The movie leaves you with an ending thats quite satisfying for all involved.

Some have really ripped this movie to shreds in various reviews. For me it wasn't award winning material but it was a pleasant enough 80 minutes that was far superior to many films that are released this way. The acting of all involved was quite good, especially Scodelario as Kelly and Ed Skrein as a member of the gang with a penchant for violence. The movie won't be one that youll remember long after seeing it but for an evenings entertainment it does a fine job.",1458086400,2,2944,4.293693693693694
