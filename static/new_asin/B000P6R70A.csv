2811863,5,B000P6R70A,If you get a chance to watch this movie...DO!!! It's hilarious! I purchased it because we're doing this show for our community theater production this year. The other gals & I watched it together...some of us were laughing so hard we had tears running down our faces...others were laughing so hard they were holding their stomachs & trying to stay on their chairs. It's totally awesome!!!! I'd love to see the actual show on stage...if our production can be 1/8th as funny we'll be a huge success in our small town!!!,1209168000,3,517,4.6923076923076925
2811864,5,B000P6R70A,"Hilarious.  Having seen Nunsense & Nunsense II on the stage & then on PBS TV, I had to have the DVD's, then found Nunsensations,(Las Vegas review) & Nuncrackers (C'mas revue) which I also had to have.  I watch these DVD's often &, since I live alone, I can enjoy them & laugh out loud.  I recommend them to anyone who enjoys wonderful, clean comedy.",1198281600,5,349,4.421875
2811865,2,B000P6R70A,"We have the first Nun Sense video, and the latest production is nothing like the first one. It lacks timing and the energy of the first one. It seems to have a good technical staff, but the director tries too hard to make the slower script and humor reach the quality of the first one. We didn't watch it all of the way thru.",1191974400,,325,4.09375

8189329,4,B000P6R70A,This is another great musical comedy in the NUNSENSE series.  But not Dan Goggin's best of the seven in my opinion.,1375833600,,115,4.476190476190476
8189330,3,B000P6R70A,"the video arrived promptly and in perfect condition; no complaints there.  Actually, no complaints - I was just disappointed im the content of the video... Nunsensations was very disappointing after Nunsense, Nunsense 2 and Nuncrackers.",1352764800,,236,5.742857142857143

8189333,5,B000P6R70A,This show is a HOOT!!!  My favorite character is Sister Mary Amnesia.  I am planning to audition and will be assistant choreographer for a local production of Nunsensations in September of this year.  I needed to familiarize myself with the characters and dance numbers.  It did the trick.  I would recommend this DVD to all who love the theatre.,1217635200,,346,4.796610169491525
