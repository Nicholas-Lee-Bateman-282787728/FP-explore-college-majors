648495,5,6303447740,"YESTERDAY'S ENTERPRISE is probably my personal favorite TNG episode.  Surely, Captain Rachel Garrett's attempt to defend the Klingon colony at Narendra III ought to rank up there with some of the fabulous rear-guard  actions of history and literature, if some Sir Charles Oman in the future  decides to write another book of famous battles.

648747,5,6303447740,"Still have doubts that ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" is not the best Star Trek TV series? You must not have seen ""Yesterday's Enterprise."" This has it all: wormholes, revived characters, TWO battles with the Klingons, and a life lesson that is powerfully displayed. In short: it's excellent science-fiction and most likely one of the best $[amount] you'll ever spend. The Enterprise-C has gone forward in time after slipping into a wormhole during a battle with the Romulans while defending a Klingon outpost. If they had stayed and fought, decades of war with the Klingons would have been avoided. Now, they are in the alternate dimension, where the Picard-commanded Enterprise-D is the flagship and best battleship in the fleet. Tasha Yar is still alive, and it is assumed Troi died back when they encountered Armus in the first season. Guinan knows the timeline is wrong, and tries to convince Picard to send the Enterprise-C back to its own time. Picard is now faced with an awful decision: keep the C crew in the future and refit the old ship for battle with the Klingons? Or should he send the crew back to what will surely be their deaths? This is the best episode of TNG and a great place for those interested in Trekdom to start. It was the first episode I saw, and I think it's my favorite. If you like cool space battles, tough decisions, and great characters, you'll love this episode.",1043280000,,1400,4.741803278688525
648748,4,6303447740,"...and I'm not even a fan.
This episode uses a ""temporal anomaly"" to briefly resurrect ""Tasha Yar"".  The Enterprise meets up with its predecessor, the Ambassador Class Enterprise-C.  Actually, the ""C"" was supposed to have been destroyed years earlier while fighting alongside Klingons defending against a Romulan attack at Narendra III.  The sacrifice of Enterprise-C in defense of the Klingon outpost was one of the motivating factors behind the Klingon-Federation treaty.  Vanishing into a temporal rift, however, the older Enterprise merely confirms the Klingon's suspicion of a Federation-Romulan alliance.  This results in an alternate history in which the Klingons declared war against the Federation and, by Captain Picard's time, have virtually defeated the Starfleet.  Coming to rescue the severely damaged Enterprise-C, the newer ship also appears different - darker, and in combat mode.  Also, Tasha Yar, killed in an earlier episode is alive - in the alternate history, the Enterprise had more to worry about than exploring the planet where she was killed.  Hunted by the Klingons, nobody but Guinan can sense that the situation is not only desperate, but chronometrically anomalous.  Pretty soon, the crew of 1701-D realizes that it has no choice but to send 1701-C back through the temporal rift, to an almost certain doom, but one that may prevent the Klingon-Federation war from even occurring.  Having an idea of what's at stake, it becomes a race against time to repair 1701-C enough before the rift reappears, but also before Klingon reinforcements appear and (ironically) prevent Starfleet from repairing a timeline that would save both sides a lot of grief.
This was great episode for TNG, but not perfect.  The greater-than-normal tension of the Enterprise here is a welcome change(normally it's about as high-pressured an environment as a cruise ship), and the prospect of a Federation at the brink of defeat is a guilty pleasure (you can almost hear Rick Moranis yelling ""evil will always defeat good, because good is dumb!"")  Still, the episode isn't perfect.  Having opened up a pandora's box of what an alternate history is like, our heroes are still the same decent chaps they've always been - you'd think they'd have more physical scars and a tougher skin, becoming perhaps nastier than the guys we're used to seeing.  You might even expect the wartime Federation to approximate a police state, even if by necessity, giving our heroes two enemies to worry about.  It's clear that the script doesn't have enough fun with the idea of an alternate reality (if it had, Michael Dorn would have been cast as the Klingon Commander).  The other problem is that the story really has little conflict - once Picard has been convinced by Guinan that 1701-C must return to the past everybody gets on board with little dissent, unreasonably ignoring a significant source of plot tension (you'd think that there would be some who oppose the idea of sending 1701-C off to her doom on the slim chance that doing so would impress the Klingons with whom they'd been warring for years).  Instead, it's clear that for its highs, the episode was just a great excuse to bring back Tasha Yar after an ignominous end in an earlier episode (the writers compound this impression when, after finally getting some real closure on Tasha's death, they re-open it and introduce her half-romulan daughter in a latter story-arc).  The FX looked to have been pushed to their limits (the Klingon cruisers, which always looked and moved like nimble fighter planes in the movies, seem ponderously slow here) and the Klingons themselves, never shown in the flesh, never become more than the CGI ships that torment the ship.  This was clearly standout episode, though it showed TNG's limits.

648753,5,6303447740,"Oh, yeah, I guess I already said that ""The Inner Light"" was the greatest Star Trek: The Next Generation episode ever, so ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" can't be #1.  Well, then, it's #1a!!! :)
Many times, the ""go back in time and change history"" thing doesn't work well (at least for me), but this time it's awesome -powerful, dramatic, amazing!  When the Enterprise 1701-C, the predecessor to the ""current"" Enterprise, comes through a rift during its battle with the Romulans after answering a distress signal at the Klingon outpost of Nerendra 3, history is changed, and in some mind-boggling ways...
For one thing, the Federation, instead of being at peace with the Klingons, now has been at war with them for years, suffering hundreds of billions of casualties, and actually only a few months away from surrendering!  Appropriately, the Enterprise has been transformed from a ""ship of peace"" to a ""ship of war"" - complete with beefed-up arsenals and defensive systems, a military command structure and discipline, a subtle, but ultimately much different look and feel (grayer, more cramped and claustrophobic, like Das Boot or something!), and no families on board.  And the only one who realizes all this has happened is the ultra-cool character with a sense of how things are ""supposed to be"" - Guinan - who must convince Picard to send the Enterprise C back into the rift.
This is one of the most unique Star Trek episodes ever made, and part of the reason is that of the four central characters - Guinan, (a no-longer dead) Tasha Yar, her new friend Lieutenant Robert Castillo from the Enterprise C, and Captain Picard. - only 1 of them is a regular.  Tasha Yar, of course, was killed during season #1 in ""Skin of Evil"" - a mediocre episode at best.  Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg) appears every so often, but this is her (by far) best performance - wow!  Castillo is a new character, and is excellent as well.  Finally, Picard is fascinating as the subtly-different captain of the Enterprise.  Another great acting job.
So, besides great acting, a mind-boggling story which will give you goosebumps (like when Tasha finds out she ""died a meaningless death"" in the other time line, and requests permission to go to the Enterprise C and this time at least die a ""meaningful death""), and cool battle scenes, what more could you ask for?  How about Prune Juice?  If you don't know what I mean, you'll just have to watch this episode and find out!  Enjoy!!",998524800,,2448,4.816229116945108

While the enterprise-c moves away, the enterprise-d is taking a beating.

Everyone's on edge,  Picard is at Riker's throat, and Tasha Yar strolls the gritty bridge, back  in the land of the living.
And of course, Star Trek provides us with a  moral dilema as Picard must convince the C crew to return to certain death.  One is reminded of Wrath of Khan, when does the good of the many outweight  the good of the few? It's also inspiring to give Yar a better send-off  after the disaster that was Skin of Evil.

7847369,1,6303447740,"Despite rave reviews by the press and most TNG fans, Yesterday's Enterprise, in my personal opinion, is a confusing mess at it's best.  It makes absolutely no sense when you add all the aspects and history of the Enterprise together.  Despite financial issues of the episode, to mix three different forms of the Starfleet uniform into an episode that is supposed to be comprised of just two different versions of the Enterprise is ridiculous.  And just exactly where in Enterprise history has there EVER been a female captain?  Only on this one nonsensical episode. To complicate matters, the Enterprise C is pulled forward into time supposedly 22 yrs, but to explain this whole episode, it should have been revealed that the Enterprise D apparently went back in time as well to an undetermined time period.  All we have is mix matched uniforms to even hint at this.  However, it is the only way any of this confusing mess could half-way be explained. We have a missing Worf and Counselor Troi, whom Tasha should have noticed were missing, and we have an added Guinan who Tasha should not have recognized but does.  Guinan's constant statements of ""this is not right"" doesn't even help this episode make sense. Another very confusing aspect of this episode, the conflict with the Kingons ended with ""The Final Fronteer"" where peace agreements start after Kirk and McCoy's ""trial.""  So why now, only 22 yrs into Enterprise D's past, is there still a conflict with the Klingons? That conflict ended years prior. The episode ends with everything just snapping back to normal, and none of the crew except, Guinan, having a clue what has just happened.  Did they have ""time warp amnesia?"" Who knows?  We never find out.

I am a huge Star Trek fan, but, in my personal opinion, this episode makes absolutely no sense and in no way should be considered a classic.",1313971200,,1856,4.80503144654088
7847370,5,6303447740,"I was never a fan of TNG and in fact, I found it to be a poor imitation of the original in every way except special effects. It did have its moments, however, and none better than Yesterday's Enterprise. It is a brilliant episode, with a story that involves time travel, war and peace, love and loss.
The best thing in this episode is also the best in the whole TNG series...Patrick Stewart. He consistently rises above the material and gives a commanding performance as Picard. For me, he is the only great character in TNG and especially in this episode, where he is on a ship of war, not one of peace with the kids running around, which I always felt detracted from the realism of a future exploring vessel.
The weakest thing in this episode is Guinen (sp) played by Whoopi Goldberg. She seems so ill at ease when reciting her lines it is hard to believe this is an Oscar winner. The character is bizarre and almost too convenient at times and, quite frankly, boring.
In the best scene, when she confronts Picard about the decision to send Enterprise-C, we get to see them both together. It is a polarizing scene because on the one end we have Stewart giving his best scene in the series and he is acting with Goldberg, who has a raspy voice and almost no conviction within her role. I often think of this and a similar one in First Contact, the latter being superior because Stewart had a much better actress to raise the level of the scene.
So it is not a perfect episode, it is not as good as the best episodes of TOS, but it is still outstanding and very deserving of the accolades it has received. I also find it kind of sad because this is the one episode I watch and I think 'what might have been' because this was a darker, grittier future and one that would have been far more compelling than the politically correct one we were given with episodes written like Saturday morning cartoons. Yeah, the later seasons of TNG were better but still too restrained for good drama and storytelling.",1243814400,,2001,4.425474254742547

Superb guest appearances!

7847372,5,6303447740,"My favorite and the best TNG episode in all of its 7 year historical run.  It has all the ingredients of time, space, and the '..what if' factor all role into one that has left many trekkie diehards more than satisfied.  Bringing back Tasha Yar was a coup de force after her meaningless demise which left many fans feeling angered.  Her acting was something i always admired as a security chief officer because of her protective nature she has with her crew mates. Just having her back was a joy to behold but seeing her in a romantic role with a crewman of the past is more than any fan could ask as well as her sacrifice to restore the time line.

Picard and Riker's authoritativeness in battle tested situations is a sight to behold, and very much acceptable under those conditions.  There are those who might disagree with me but Number One was not trying to undermining the captain's prerogative. He did what a 1st officer would of done and that is to suggest the best possible solution and advisement for his captain. The overtone here is wonderful and not over the top.

The ending was how it should be but what if?? ..lets say by allowing the storyline to continue on with the alternate timeline for a few more episode, if not a whole season with the crew tryin to find a way to restore history (much like Voyager trying to get back home).  Imagine the possibilities the script writers would have with this...WOW!  I mean why not?!?  seven long years with the same 'Ship of Peace' can be somewhat lagging without having the Enterprise taking full advantage of the starship's battle arsonal against the mightly Klingons.  Then having the year's season ending two hour episode with Tasha Yar insisting on going back to the past to engage in that fateful battle at Narinda 3, which will also be shown with all the flury it demands within the two hour finale.  Then once the battle ends with the Enterprise C being destroyed, the future would suddenly be restored with Worf drinking his prune juice at ten forward, which would really be their present umm oh nevermind!!!

If you never seen Yesterday's Enterprise, you are missing the best one hour you could possibly spend in front of the television.  Recommended viewing, not just for trekkie or sci-fi fanatics.",1205625600,,2267,4.651629072681704

Plot:  The Enterprise has encountered a temporal rift from which comes a ship.  Everything suddenly changes.  Everyone is armed, talk of war with the Klingons, lights are darker, everyone is on rations, Tasha Yar is alive, etc.  Well, Guinin (being something like 2000 years old) has the ability to sense time distortions, so she goes to the captain and tells him that he needs to send the ship that just flew through the time portal.  Well, the ship in of itself is interesting.  It happens to be the Enterprise-C, the Enterprise before Picard's ship.  Well, that ship was presumed to be destroyed at Khitomer along with the outpost there by the Romulans.  Well, since the ship seems to have gone through a time warp, things don't seem to be so great.  Now Picard must decide whether to send back the Enterprise-C (and to certain destruction) and restore everything back to normal, or keep the ship here.  Guinin also has a talk with Tasha about her life in real time.  Well, Tasha isn't too thrilled about being dead in the alternate (real) timeline, especially since it was pointless.

And it showcases the would-be relationships between Picard and Garrett and Guinan and Yar.

The course of history is altered by the mysterious appearance of a U.S.S. Enterprise from the past.
While on a routine mission, the U.S.S. Enterprise discovers a bizarre rift in space, which reveals an unidentified vessel. Both ships are now on an alternate universe where the Federation is in the midst of a twenty-year bloody war with the Klingons.
The crew identifies the mysterious vessel as their ships' immediate predecessor, the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-C, believed to have been destroyed in battle twenty-two years ago. Their own crew now includes Tasha Yar, the ex-security chief who was killed in the line of duty. Meeting with the captain of that vessel, Captain Rachel Garrett, Picard learns that it was responding to a distress signal on a Klingon outpost when it was attacked by four Romulan Warbirds. But in the middle of the assault, the ship broke through the space rift, thus saving it from the destruction recorded in the history books, and now history has no memory of the U.S.S. Enterprise-C's battle with the Romulans. Although Picard and his crew are baffled by the strange appearance of the U.S.S. Enterprise-C, Guinan's alien instincts lead her to believe that the Federation's current bloody war with the Klingons is the result of the U.S.S. Enterprise-C's presence in their future. Certain that the ship is now existing in the wrong time line, she pleads with Picard to send the U.S.S. Enterprise-C back through the rift in order to change the course of events, which has resulted in the loss of 40 billion lives during the Klingon war.
Picard confers with Data, who asserts that if the U.S.S. Enterprise-C was destroyed while aiding the Klingon outpost, it would have been viewed as an honorable act, which means the current war with the Klingons may have been avoided. Faced with this knowledge, Picard decides to send the U.S.S. Enterprise-C back through the time rift, to face its tragic destiny.
Meanwhile, Tasha learns from Guinan that, in the correct time line, she died a meaningless death. In response, Tasha requests that she be allowed to serve on the doomed U.S.S. Enterprise-C crew so that she may die in the heroic battle with the Romulans, and Picard reluctantly agrees.
As the U.S.S. Enterprise-C makes its way back through the time rift, three Klingon warships try to launch an attack on it. To assure that the U.S.S. Enterprise-C returns to its rightful place in time, Picard positions the U.S.S. Enterprise-D between that vessel and the Klingons, sustaining heavy casualities in the process. Just as the U.S.S. Enterprise-D's engine core seems on the verge of exploding, Data announces that the rift has closed, and, unaware of the preceding events, the U.S.S. Enterprise returns to its original time line, heading for a cultural exchange program with a Klingon delegation.",1059004800,2,2831,5.051282051282051
