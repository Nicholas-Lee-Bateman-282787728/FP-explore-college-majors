1947311,4,B0000UJL1E,"I agree with the person that said they need to put out dvds of some of the best stories GH came out with in the 80s. They should put out sets for each of the great mysteries and WSB stories, starting with the Ice Princess adventure, the DVX disc, the Asian Quarter, etc. When those stories aired, GH was getting phenomenal ratings. We had real heroes like Robert Scorpio, Luke & Laura, strong women like Anna Devane. I can't even recognize GH today. It has become horrible and I hope that soon they get new writers and bring it back to it's former glory, along with some of the actors/characters that made it great. But I would love to get DVDs of those stories that made me rush home as a teenager to watch everyday. I think they'd sell pretty good, as many fans are starved for nostalgia and the good old days of GH.",1140048000,21,818,4.283870967741936
1947312,5,B0000UJL1E,"Back in the mid-90's, ABC/Disney released three wedding videos that were about an hour each. The AMC one was hosted by Susan Lucci (Erica Kane Martin Brent Cudahy Chandler Roy Roy Montgomery Montgomery Chandler Marick Marick Montgomery), OLTL by Erika Slezak (Viki), and GH by Brad Maule and Jacklyn Zeman (Tony and Bobbie. This dvd is those three shows put together in one. They're all here again: Luke and Laura, Greg and Jenny, Viki and Clint, Lucy and Alan, and many more.

Very worth the price. You'll get the chills all over again. If you're a fan of ABC Daytime, you'll love this.",1122249600,2,587,4.699029126213592
1947313,1,B0000UJL1E,"when i saw that there was a DVD with Daytime's Greatest Weddings I immediately thought that it would feature newer weddings and classic weddings.....I was soooo WRONG! It turns out that it is just the ""Daytime's Greatest Weddings"" for AMC, OLTL, and GH!....I already have the AMC and the GH versions in VHS...I really wanted to see the weddings for Noah and Julia, Edmund and Maria,and Erica and Dmitri's second wedding....what about Asa and Alex's wedding on OLTL...or Bo and Nora's?

the only good thing that came out of it is that I was able to see the OLTL version for the first time.....",1098576000,6,592,4.6923076923076925

8003213,5,B0000UJL1E,I loved seeing this. It was great to see Luke and Laura wedding again after so many years. Plus the other weddings,1355529600,,114,4.2272727272727275
8003214,5,B0000UJL1E,"I have watched ABC Day TV since 1984,One Life to Live is my fave. This dvd is an excellent walk down memory lane of the weddings of AMC<OLTL<GH.Note the weddings only go up to the year 1993,so for those who have watched from 1963 to 1993 will be nicely suprised. One Life gives you a backstory on all their weddings plus the actual weddings. This dvd is worth having since AMC and OLTL are going off the air. I bid a fond farewell to Pine Valley,PA.1970-2011 and the city with the 2 L's,LLanview,Pennsylvania 1968-2012.",1303344000,3,519,4.531914893617022
8003215,1,B0000UJL1E,"I had bought the OLTL ABC weddings on video years back.  I was hoping this was going to be diffent.  It wasn't, had the same stuff and VERY little of anything else.  I was hoping for so much more from BEHIND THE SCENES if nothing else.  Do not recommend this DVD.",1280188800,,263,4.098039215686274

8003218,2,B0000UJL1E,"This was a nice look at some of General Hospital, All My Children and One Life to Live's greatest weddings but I was hoping it would be the actual eposides of the weddings instead of just looks at them. With almost every other tv genre putting out complete sets or collection of epsoides I had hoped that's what this DVD would be.  I was too young to watch the weddings when they orginially aired (most of them I wasn't even born yet) and hoped this would be a chance to see them.",1208217600,6,480,4.217391304347826
