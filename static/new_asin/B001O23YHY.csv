8328828,5,B001O23YHY,"This is the uncut version of the film. This movie is awesome. My only gripes are as follows:

1. The picture quality is not the best. I've seen much worse though.

2. If you are watching the original audio track which is a mixture of Japanese and English and you are watching it with the subtitles on not only is the Japanese dialog subtitled but so is the English. That can be a tad annoying.

Even with those problems I still prefer this to the edited American version.",1233619200,,471,4.329545454545454
