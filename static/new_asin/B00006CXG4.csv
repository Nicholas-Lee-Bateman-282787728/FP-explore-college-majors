The only thing good was I didn't lose much money on this junk",1525996800,,183,3.972972972972973
7967348,4,B00006CXG4,"With stars like Steve McQueen, Anthony Quinn, Kirk Douglas, Joe Pesci and James Coburn, the CRIME WAVE 10 MOVIE PACK is a sure-fire winner. There's over 30 notable actors appearing in these lesser-known action films. Even the original Raging Bull, Jake LaMotta, has a go at making crime pay, in MOB WAR.

The oldest title here, THE GREAT ST. LOUIS BANK ROBBERY, stars a young Steve McQueen as a newcomer to crime who finds himself caught up in a disastrous heist. Any fan of MST 3K is sure to remember Joe Don Baker in MITCHELL. The other seven movies here all have something to recommend them. This one's definitely for all fans of modern good guys vs. bad guys cinema.
