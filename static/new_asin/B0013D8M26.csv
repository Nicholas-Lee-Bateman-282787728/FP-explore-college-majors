3104447,1,B0013D8M26,"When I ordered The Best of Comics Unleashed with Byron Allen, I thought I was getting a great comedy DVD - boy was I mistaken!  This appears as if an amateur recorded it - with the terrible editing job.  Granted, the commercials are gone - but it was painful to think that someone was selling this for money!

There was a great list of comedians included, Cedric the Entertainer, Howie Mandel, George Wallace, Brad Garrett, etc.  I was excited to load it in the DVD player!!  Then, as I realized it wasn't going to get any better, I found myself cleaning house waiting for it to end.  (I have 2 young kids - cleaning house is not a fun task for me at all - so for me to WANT to clean vs. watch this says a lot!!)

If you are a big Byron Allen fan ... go for it.  Everyone else - pass this one up!

3104509,1,B0013D8M26,"I love comedy and thought this was maybe an anthology of current comedy acts. Wow, I could not have been more wrong. This seems like a failed pilot or a vanity project for Byron Allen. It is horrible on almost every level. The production values are worse than my 1970's high school AV squad. The ""guest"" comedians look vaguely embarrassed to be on. A couple of them even ask ""Is this going to be on TV?"".... ""What channel will this be on?"".

The only way I could even get through this 2 disc set (I watched the entire thing) was to pretend this was a version of ""The King Of Comedy"" and that Byron Allen was a black Rupert Pupkin and the comedians were his hostages. It didn't make it any better but it did occupy my mind for the 176 minutes. I looked in vain for the ""featurette"" but could not find it. I confess I didn't look that hard.

Please save your money. Or buy ""The King of Comedy"".",1211500800,,892,4.2105263157894735
3104510,2,B0013D8M26,"This DVD has the best of intentions. It assembles some of the greatest comics and comedy writers of the last thirty years. The first major problem is that this DVD is a compilation of TV shows hosted by Byron Allen. One would expect to see stand up routines but instead the segments are an informal ""made to look improptu"" sit-down with four comics and the host Byron Allen. What the segments end up being are one-liners and half developed thoughts between these great comedy minds that never get to really evolve into a routine. The next major problem is that the segments are so incredibly short that they run more like sound bite clips for the internet rather than a TV show let alone a DVD.  Adding to all of this, these extremely short clips are sandwiched between a very pedestrian stand up routine from Allen and a commentary session by the no no-name regular on the program. So much time is wasted on these two bookends of the show that even less time is given to what we are there to watch in the first place, THE COMEDIANS! The third major problem is the whole thing is filmed in the style of a bad infomerical. Last but not least, Byron Allen has made a career out of interviewing people, not stand-up comedy. He is obviously there as the host to warm up the crowd but his jokes are uninspired, fell flat, not to mention he looked pretty nervous delivering them.

The DVD itself has nothing particularly special just you're average ""play all"" menu no extra's, bloopers or anything though given this is a Vine product, please do keep in mind at the time of this review, the DVD may not be complete and ready for retail.

All in all the only reason I gave this two stars is because the guest stars they have are the best in the business and there are some (not many but some) interesting reactions.",1211328000,,1807,4.453172205438066
3104511,1,B0013D8M26,"If this is ""the best of comics unleashed,"" then they should have kept them on the leash, or at least tried to clean up their messes.  I like dogs, but this could give dogs a bad name.

Seriously, this is an example of why most comedy shows are carefully-written and carefully-scripted.  They may have been hoping for spontaneity, but the ugly little secret is that good comedians don't just ad lib.  They have carefully planned ""routines.""  Yes, there are a few like Robin Williams who appears to ad lib, but in most cases it is material he has carefully thought through, and filed away for an opportunity to use it ""on the spot"" as an apparent ad lib.

These comedians are mostly nice people--good when their material has been written and practiced.  It must have been as embarrassing for them to see this video as it would be for us to have paid for it.  Keep these dogs out of your house.",1211068800,,891,4.45679012345679
3104512,5,B0013D8M26,"The amount of hilarity on this DVD and the variety of funny personalities makes this a great value for comedy lovers.  The 2-disk set gave me plenty to watch and gave my weekend an extra perk, and if that's not enough, there are plenty of bonus features. I enjoyed many of my favorites such as Jon Lovitz, Dennis Miller and of course I practically grew up on Pauley Shore, so it felt like I had a party of old, familiar friends in my living room.  The younger generation should enjoy these comics too, even if they didn't grow up seeing them during their teen years.  The 'relaxed' atmosphere that's part talk show host/off the hip style skits seems truly enjoyable for the comics too as they interact and bounce jokes off one another. Bravo!

3104513,2,B0013D8M26,"There are people out there who don't find Saturday Night Live humorous, who think Caddyshack is too sophomoric, and would never go to a comedy club if their life depended on it.

Then there are those who appreciate The Best of Comics Unleashed DVD, featuring comedian Byron Allen.

Depending on the consistency of your funny bone, you will snicker and chortle, or steam at the ears.  Byron Allen takes a ""Late Night with..."" approach to this show, starting with a monologue (hit and miss in my opinion), then introducing his comedian guests for an ""off-the cuff"" conversation.  The ad-libbing is the best part of the show.  There is some funny stuff presented here, just as you would expect in any comedy club.  And there really is a wide assortment of comedians and comedy styles.

However, the clips from each show (remember the title, ""The Best of..."") are short.  The DVD producers include the entire ending trailer with each segment.  And the whole thing FEELS heavily edited.

This DVD has some entertainment factor, but the post-production editing really detracts from its impact.  Three stars for potential.",1210809600,,1115,4.972972972972973
3104514,3,B0013D8M26,"You've got to give it to Byron Allen: with virtually no talent, he's built a business and a name for himself in a city where most people try and fail. This DVD is an example of one of his endeavors and although it's not terrible (he does have some pretty strong talent as guests) it's hard to recommend it. Some bits done by people like Brad Garrett and Cedric the Entertainer are pretty hilarious. One recommendation if you do buy this: keep the clicker handy; you're going to need to do a lot of fast-forwarding when Allen is talking.",1210809600,,536,4.424242424242424
3104515,1,B0013D8M26,"I used to think that EVERYTHING should be available on DVD. ""The Best of Comics Unleashed with Byron Allen"" has proved me wrong. It's not that the show doesn't garner any laughs at all. There are some to be had. Not tons, but some. The thing is, I don't think something like this warrants repeat viewings. I can't even imagine bothering to watch this one more than once. When I requested it, I expected it to be a show of stand up comedy, but it is not. It is simply Byron Allen and a small group of big name comedians sitting around talking about random topics. It's been compared to ""Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn"", but Tough Crowd was a MUCH better show. Tough Crowd discussed real topics and was a reasonable one hour long (well, including the commercials). Comics Unleashed would run half an hour with commercials (and I'm still not sure where this show ever ran). That means each episode is twenty-two minutes long (there are 8 episodes here, four on each disc). After Byron's monologue, it's not much time for the comedians to discuss anything. Thankfully, they eventually cut out the extra and rarely funny commentary bit that also stole time away from the guest comedians. When they do get to discuss things though, it is the most random stuff, and clearly there was heavy editing going on, because topics come out of the blue (plastic surgery and dating being among the popular ones). At times, the audience laughter (though there is a live audience there) sounds like it MUST be canned. Overall, I can't really see a reason why anyone would want to own this set unless they were a particular fanatic for one or more of the comedians who appear on it: Dane Cook, Cedric the Entertainer, Howie Mandel, Katt Williams, David Brenner, George Wallace, Harland Williams, Brad Garrett, Kim Coles, Pauley Shore, Tommy Davidson, Jon Lovitz, Margaret Cho, Kevin Pollak, Rita Rudner, Aries Spears, Dennis Miller, John Roy, Caroline Rhea, Godfrey, Ralphie May, Tina Giorgi, Don Friesen, Lisa Alvarado, Tammy Pescatelli, and Sheryl Underwood. I'll say this much for it, filmed in Hi-Def, the picture is remarkably clear, even on my oldschool TV and player. My recommendation: Pick up a CD or DVD of these comics doing their stand-up performances instead.",1210809600,,2250,4.816537467700258
3104516,3,B0013D8M26,"Ok, for the record, I do have a sense of humor and have enjoyed, over the years frequenting many of the comedy clubs out here in the Bay Area, so I do like comedy.

I'm rating this dvd middle of the road.  I had not seen the show, but if I was up at that time of night I probably would have watched it occasionally, but certainly wouldn't have felt compelled to tape it if I wasn't going to be able to watch.

You get several episodes and it is in a talk show format.  I enjoyed Byron Allen but the comics were really hit and miss.  The first episode really didn't hit my ""funny meter"" at all.  David Brenner seemed a bit lost in the shuffle and the chemistry with the comedians really didn't work well.  By the second disc I found more of the episodes that I thought were funny. Comedy is pretty subjective, and so what one finds funny someone else might not, but I enjoyed Dennis Miller, Katt Williams, Kim Coles, Don Friesen & Ralphie May the most.

The dvd is a pretty bare bones production....just the episodes and nothing extra.  The opening bits already are dated with references that have come and gone.

Is it horrible?  No, not entirely.  Is it the best comedy I've seen in recent memory?  Absolutely not, but I did have moments where I thought that the comedy did work and when it worked it worked well.

I would say this is probably more for the ""Comics Unleashed"" fan only and not so much for someone with just an appreciation for good stand-up, which this is not.",1210723200,,1477,4.304347826086956
3104517,3,B0013D8M26,"This DVD set (2 DVDs) contains excerpts from Byron Allen's TV show of the same name. Each segment features a short monologue from Byron, then he hosts a panel of four other comics for a round robin of humor. The segments run about 18 minutes each, and while they announce breaks for commercials and cut to black, fortunately there are none of those obnoxious things to suffer through. (One big reason why I love DVDs of TV shows instead of broadcast TV.)

I don't know when these shows aired (I no longer watch broadcast TV), but it seems pretty recent as they mention Obama in one segment. The humor is generally pretty lightweight, as there really isn't enough time for four comics to get warmed up and truly crazy. There are exceptions, and some segments are funnier than others. There are a few outright adult moments, and the final segment with all female comics, which is definitely the best, does quickly launch into some pretty mature stuff (which I loved - these ladies are a scream).

While it mostly just made me smile, there were a few places that truly had me belly laughing. The comics are all good, and my biggest complaint is that there isn't enough. I want more. It felt rushed and was over way too fast. (How's that for a nice setup line?)

The DVD cover said there was a ""making of"" featurette, but I couldn't find it anywhere on the two DVDs. I knocked off one star for that major goof. I like that kind of behind-the-scenes stuff, and found it mildly annoying that it was missing.

I enjoyed seeing some of my favorite comics (Howie Mandel, Jon Lovitz, Rita Rudner, David Brenner) as well as finding new ones to like (all the others - see the listing for the set). This is good, solid humor, although not anything world shaking. I wouldn't run right out and buy a dozen copies, but I will certainly watch it again when I need a quick laugh, and will share it with friends.

It is definitely worth checking out if you enjoy comedy in general or these comedians in particular.",1210636800,,1995,4.5
3104518,4,B0013D8M26,I am a huge fan of stand up comedy and this DVD delivered.  I found it very entertaining and funny.  Great gift for anyone who enjoys stand up comedy.  Great selection of comedians.  Great DVD.,1210636800,,193,4.428571428571429
3104539,2,B0013D8M26,"[...]  What I can tell you about this product is that I didn't enjoy it very much.  This is hardly surprising though, seeing as how I consider Margret Cho to be an unfunny racist, Dane Cook to be wildly overrated, and Dennis Miller to be not much better.

There are gems on this set.  Ralphie May, Cedric the Entertainer, and Jon Lovitz did make me laugh through several of their jokes and skits.  On average though, I felt the jokes were simply not very funny or clever.  Most of the were mean-spirited.  I guess that's the point for some of the performers, but I tend to feel uneasy around mean-spirited humor.  I certainly prefer my redneck jokes to my put-downs and slams.  These days I look at comedians and wonder whether or not they could be funny without all the foul language and insults.  This DVD makes me wonder what has happened to the comedy world.

Are we so desperate for laughs we'll laugh at someone cussing out another person?  I may only be twenty-two, but I'm starting to feel old already.  Of course, as mentioned above I was expecting a different DVD.  If I had examined the description more carefully I certainly wouldn't have ordered this, because I know in advance that I don't like several of the comedians.  Your millage may vary however, and there are many reviews on here where the reviewers are fans of the material, so those may prove to be more effective when you factor in whether or not you want to take some of your budget money and spend it on this.",1210550400,,1486,4.4721189591078065

I was looking for a bunch of mini stand up comedy acts.  But what it turns out to be is a bunch of mini-round table discussions with each discussion having four comedians.  Byron Allen asks a question to someone ""when did you first get into comedy"" and the person answers then someone else jumps in with a funny reply, and so on.

So as I was looking more for single comedy acts.  This DVD is more like round table discussions.  Some people may be looking for this, and if you are, then this DVD is for you.

3104541,3,B0013D8M26,"""Comics Unleashed"" purports to be a kind of free-wheeling talk show that SHOULD be funnier than most others (at least deliberately so) because the participants are all funny for a living. While the premise is, admittedly, debatable, it would be interesting to see it tried out. Too often, however, what we get here is merely comics using the talk-show format to, basically, do their routines. Some of these routines are quite good; some are weak; none, perhaps due to built in restrictions of the format, are brilliant. Oh, and Byron Allen, whom I keep wanting to call Byron Nelson, and who created and hosts the show, is, sadly, not funny at all. Sadder still, he thinks he is.",1210377600,,678,4.754237288135593

This DVD is:
1. Funny on rare occasions
2. Erratic
3. Undeniably horrible

What you get is a collection of episodes of a comedy talk show that began airing in September 2006, minus the commercials.  The format involves a host (Byron Allen), four guest comedians and a guest DJ.  The host enters to rousing applause, delivers a humorously-challenged intro, and then sits with his guests, feeding them previously agreed lines so that they can launch into their little funny bits on cue. The DJ makes some noise to fill any awkward moments, making him one of the hardest working members of the team.

The main topics covered are:
1. ""So how are you doing (insert name)?""
2. ""How many kids do you have, and how are they doing?""
3. ""Your worst date / Your last date / Have you ever had a date?""
4. ""Hitting on fellow panel members""
5. ""How about Madonna and those African babies?""
6. ""What are you up to now, and what's your website address?""

The performances of the comedians also fall into categories:
1. The Good: Cedric the Entertainer, Harland Williams, Rita Rudner, John Roy
2. The Bad: Byron Allen, Howie Mandel, Brad Garrett, Pauley Shore, Ralphie May
3. The Acceptable: Jon Lovitz, Tina Giorgi
4. The Indifferent: The rest of the lot

3104543,1,B0013D8M26,"The truth about this show ...

""They're filming the show in HD, so if it's bad -- it will be clear"" - Byron Allen

Too bad no one took a cue from this and canceled this stinker before it got any further.

Byron Allen --

Allen is the kind of person that is rife in Los Angeles. Someone, who will try anything to ""break into the biz"", or ""get his shot"" and someone who has festered on the city like a bad fungus. He's the type of sycophant who goes to acting schools, yoga classes, singing lessons, self-help gurus and probably even applies 'medium bronze' self-tanner, daily, trying to master everything -- but never grasping the basics of one of them, or himself. He's the black male version of a Paris Hilton, which is probably more of an insult to Black Males than it is to Paris Hilton. His interviews always showed him to be self-absorbed and obnoxious. He's famous for doing absolutely nothing, unless you call being Host of multiple canceled shows something to be proud of. But how many more incarnations of Byron Allen must we see before everyone realizes that he's nothing more than a talentless hack, a groveling socialite and a wannabe?

I don't think that I've ever heard such dry, tired and haggard stand-up as I heard coming from Byron Allen's incredibly unfunny mouth. It was obvious that he had been coached, had over-rehearsed and had zero comedic timing. The joke about taking a picture of the $200 for the traffic light violation wasn't even his joke, but someone else's. I wish I could remember who it was that came up with that as I would inform them that Byron Allen is stealing their material and fronting with it on his show.

No amount of classes, coaching and B-List celebs will ever help the situation that is evident on these disks.

The Comics --

To the credit of the show, they really tried to book some really strong talent. But nothing seems to work and the show just struggles along not working for the entirety of the two disks. The look on Jon Lovitz face is priceless, as you can tell he's thinking that show will probably be canceled long before his segment airs. A similar look can be seen on the face of several of the other comics as well, even though they're struggling to be gracious to Allen. Most might think that this is a DVD full of stand-up comics delivering their best material, but it is not. It's really cheesy, episodic cable TV on disc, trying to recoup money for something that is not worth the asking price.

Harland Williams --

I once stood in front of Harland Williams in line to go see the movie High Fidelity at the El Capitan in Hollywood many years ago. He was there with some girl that he was trying to impress by being funny. The problem was that most of what he was trying was obnoxious. He sat a few seats over from me and I heard him whispering the same old tired material as the film progressed. I get the feeling that Harland Williams will try anything at all and just hope that something along the way will work, as the bulk of his humor fails to evince any laughter from the crowd. Most of what he does produce though, is nervous laughter and the anticipation to leave. Making a career out of that though is undoubtedly his trade mark. He has a Jon Gries / Steven Wright sense of timing and wit that only a select audience can appreciate.

Harland Williams appears in multiple places on the DVD, so beware.

The Audience --

It was clear that they tried to film as many shows as they could with the first audience. The first four shows repeatedly will flash back to the same young blonde audience members. You can also see them in the end credits as well. Some of the audience are behaving way too over the top as if they were paid. Several people looked as if they were having epileptic fits and others just looked downright bored or even angry. I freeze-framed the audience several times just to see some of the disinterested faces close up, just to make sure I was seeing what I thought I was seeing.

The DJ --

The DJ spinning in his little control booth above the rest of them also looked as if he might be Ted Kaczynski's little brother with a permanent scowl. What was up with that? Maybe he was just hoping the check from Byron Allen would clear so he could pay his overdue rent. He seemed to be working overtime trying to salvage the show like the Quartet on the Titanic, refusing to accept the fact that they were going down fast. The thundering bass during every commercial was just far too annoying.

The Show & DVD --

How many times are TV execs going to try to run with this over-used formula? Colin Quinn tried it, Tom Arnold tried it, Norm McDonald tried it, Chevy Chase tried it and even Adam ""Troll"" Corolla tried it. They  all failed -- because it was always a lame idea at 22 mins long. It just doesn't work.

I would skip this at all costs as it'll probably be one of those shows that will be offered up as free content online to lure in viewers to whatever website that might host this, as it's material that the studios can afford to dispose of. You can see better stand-up comedy on Youtube.

Check out James Inman, on youtube, if you're looking for independent impromptu comedy.

Takes place in a television studio, in front of an audience. Some of the top names in comedy appear on the stage in groups of four. The DVD is a compilation of the Comics Unleashed TV show. When they say we are going to be right back, you knew they were going to take a break for a commercial. Fortunately, they flip a little logo, and get immediately back to the show.
Normally masterful comics perform over a period of time, enabling them to build themes, stories, and accumulated integrations. This is not like that. Although a centric theme is often created, it is often the case where the comics free form improvise on anything they want to say.
In addition to the occasional chuckle, this is just the feel good, crack a smile level of comedy. It is as much a conversation between the comedians as anything. Ok, when Howie Mandel showed the clip with the barber routine, and sprayed the guy with the hose, that was a side splitter. There were some bright spots amongst the ocassional chuckle.
This is a 2-disc set with total viewing time just 4 minutes shy of 3 hours; sort of like a mini-comedy library. I gave it 4 stars because I am a little tough on comedians. The laugh meter can vary from comic to comic, and skit to skit, and I am always looking to peg the meter. The real rating is 5 stars for the comedic lineup, and 1 stars for material.
I've only gotten to chapter 3 and 47 minutes of viewing. I must admit that I am looking forward to revisiting the rest of the DVD, although I am not over anticipating anything special. If you have a penchant for comedy, this DVD 2-disc set may satisfy some, but if you are looking for side splitting ""best of comedy"" I would pass.",1210204800,,1863,4.4186046511627906

If you are looking at this in the hopes of seeing stand-up routines by the comics listed look some where else. This is more like a sit-down group where there are a few funny moments.

In terms of new material I was really disappointed that not much seemed new. In fact much of it has been repeated time and time again and has, for the most part, lost its luster of being funny.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoy comedy and enjoy stand-up comedy. But the ratio of funny stuff to mind numbingly boring stuff is skewed more towards the boring. For a rental this may be ok. But, I don't think I can recommend purchasing it.",1210204800,2,720,4.248175182481752

The first show was terrible. Mr. Allen's monologue was very dated material and the show spent so much time panning the audience that there was barely anytime to hear the wonderful comics.  It does improve as the shows go on, and on disc 2 there are a few very funny episodes.  I think they learned from their mistakes as they went along. The monologues were updated and they made more time for the comics to get some screen time. The show did introduce me to a few very funny comics I'd never heard of before; John Roy and Katt Willams were especially good.

Maybe I'm getting crankier as I age. Who knows. There were a few knee slappin' comments but Byron Allen's script writers gave him some pretty lame material to open the show. Another hint for the producers of this product: too many commercial breaks. Even with the commercials edited out I was irritated by the number of fade to black laugh track camera panning sequences I had to put up with. If you're going to make a show about comics sitting around jack jawing then don't do half of it with comics and the other half of it just fading to commercials!

Totally unbalanced ratio but I did laugh out loud at least twice while going through the two DVDs. Some of the material is pretty good but you'll have to put up with a lot of junk material to get the good stuff.",1210032000,2,1003,4.416216216216216

There was a great list of comedians included, Cedric the Entertainer, Howie Mandel, George Wallace, Brad Garrett, etc.  I was excited to load it in the DVD player!!

This seems like a failed pilot or a vanity project for Byron Allen. It is horrible on almost every level. The production values are worse than my 1970's high school AV squad. The ""guest"" comedians look vaguely embarrassed to be on. A couple of them even ask ""Is this going to be on TV?"".... ""What channel will this be on?"".

The only way I could even get through this 2 disc set (I watched the entire thing) was to pretend this was a version of ""The King Of Comedy"" and that Byron Allen was a black Rupert Pupkin and the comedians were his hostages. It didn't make it any better but it did occupy my mind for the 176 minutes. I looked in vain for the ""featurette"" but could not find it. I confess I didn't look that hard.

3339007,2,B0013D8M26,"This DVD has the best of intentions. It assembles some of the greatest comics and comedy writers of the last thirty years. The first major problem is that this DVD is a compilation of TV shows hosted by Byron Allen. One would expect to see stand up routines but instead the segments are an informal ""made to look improptu"" sit-down with four comics and the host Byron Allen. What the segments end up being are one-liners and half developed thoughts between these great comedy minds that never get to really evolve into a routine. The next major problem is that the segments are so incredibly short that they run more like sound bite clips for the internet rather than a TV show let alone a DVD.  Adding to all of this, these extremely short clips are sandwiched between a very pedestrian stand up routine from Allen and a commentary session by the no no-name regular on the program. So much time is wasted on these two bookends of the show that even less time is given to what we are there to watch in the first place, THE COMEDIANS! The third major problem is the whole thing is filmed in the style of a bad infomerical. Last but not least, Byron Allen has made a career out of interviewing people, not stand-up comedy. He is obviously there as the host to warm up the crowd but his jokes are uninspired, fell flat, not to mention he looked pretty nervous delivering them.

The DVD itself has nothing particularly special just you're average ""play all"" menu no extra's, bloopers or anything though given this is a Vine product, please do keep in mind at the time of this review, the DVD may not be complete and ready for retail.

All in all the only reason I gave this two stars is because the guest stars they have are the best in the business and there are some (not many but some) interesting reactions.",1211328000,,1807,4.453172205438066

Seriously, this is an example of why most comedy shows are carefully-written and carefully-scripted.  They may have been hoping for spontaneity, but the ugly little secret is that good comedians don't just ad lib.  They have carefully planned ""routines.""  Yes, there are a few like Robin Williams who appears to ad lib, but in most cases it is material he has carefully thought through, and filed away for an opportunity to use it ""on the spot"" as an apparent ad lib.

These comedians are mostly nice people--good when their material has been written and practiced.  It must have been as embarrassing for them to see this video as it would be for us to have paid for it.  Keep these dogs out of your house.",1211068800,,891,4.45679012345679

I enjoyed many of my favorites such as Jon Lovitz, Dennis Miller and of course I practically grew up on Pauley Shore, so it felt like I had a party of old, familiar friends in my living room.  The younger generation should enjoy these comics too, even if they didn't grow up seeing them during their teen years.  The 'relaxed' atmosphere that's part talk show host/off the hip style skits seems truly enjoyable for the comics too as they interact and bounce jokes off one another. Bravo!

Then there are those who appreciate The Best of Comics Unleashed DVD, featuring comedian Byron Allen.

Depending on the consistency of your funny bone, you will snicker and chortle, or steam at the ears.  Byron Allen takes a ""Late Night with..."" approach to this show, starting with a monologue (hit and miss in my opinion), then introducing his comedian guests for an ""off-the cuff"" conversation.  The ad-libbing is the best part of the show.  There is some funny stuff presented here, just as you would expect in any comedy club.  And there really is a wide assortment of comedians and comedy styles.

However, the clips from each show (remember the title, ""The Best of..."") are short.  The DVD producers include the entire ending trailer with each segment.  And the whole thing FEELS heavily edited.

This DVD has some entertainment factor, but the post-production editing really detracts from its impact.  Three stars for potential.",1210809600,,1115,4.972972972972973

This DVD is an example of one of his endeavors and although it's not terrible (he does have some pretty strong talent as guests) it's hard to recommend it. Some bits done by people like Brad Garrett and Cedric the Entertainer are pretty hilarious. One recommendation if you do buy this: keep the clicker handy; you're going to need to do a lot of fast-forwarding when Allen is talking.",1210809600,,536,4.424242424242424
3339012,1,B0013D8M26,"I used to think that EVERYTHING should be available on DVD. ""The Best of Comics Unleashed with Byron Allen"" has proved me wrong. It's not that the show doesn't garner any laughs at all. There are some to be had. Not tons, but some. The thing is, I don't think something like this warrants repeat viewings. I can't even imagine bothering to watch this one more than once. When I requested it, I expected it to be a show of stand up comedy, but it is not. It is simply Byron Allen and a small group of big name comedians sitting around talking about random topics. It's been compared to ""Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn"", but Tough Crowd was a MUCH better show. Tough Crowd discussed real topics and was a reasonable one hour long (well, including the commercials). Comics Unleashed would run half an hour with commercials (and I'm still not sure where this show ever ran). That means each episode is twenty-two minutes long (there are 8 episodes here, four on each disc). After Byron's monologue, it's not much time for the comedians to discuss anything. Thankfully, they eventually cut out the extra and rarely funny commentary bit that also stole time away from the guest comedians. When they do get to discuss things though, it is the most random stuff, and clearly there was heavy editing going on, because topics come out of the blue (plastic surgery and dating being among the popular ones). At times, the audience laughter (though there is a live audience there) sounds like it MUST be canned. Overall, I can't really see a reason why anyone would want to own this set unless they were a particular fanatic for one or more of the comedians who appear on it: Dane Cook, Cedric the Entertainer, Howie Mandel, Katt Williams, David Brenner, George Wallace, Harland Williams, Brad Garrett, Kim Coles, Pauley Shore, Tommy Davidson, Jon Lovitz, Margaret Cho, Kevin Pollak, Rita Rudner, Aries Spears, Dennis Miller, John Roy, Caroline Rhea, Godfrey, Ralphie May, Tina Giorgi, Don Friesen, Lisa Alvarado, Tammy Pescatelli, and Sheryl Underwood. I'll say this much for it, filmed in Hi-Def, the picture is remarkably clear, even on my oldschool TV and player.

3339013,3,B0013D8M26,"Ok, for the record, I do have a sense of humor and have enjoyed, over the years frequenting many of the comedy clubs out here in the Bay Area, so I do like comedy.

I'm rating this dvd middle of the road.  I had not seen the show, but if I was up at that time of night I probably would have watched it occasionally, but certainly wouldn't have felt compelled to tape it if I wasn't going to be able to watch.

You get several episodes and it is in a talk show format.  I enjoyed Byron Allen but the comics were really hit and miss.  The first episode really didn't hit my ""funny meter"" at all.  David Brenner seemed a bit lost in the shuffle and the chemistry with the comedians really didn't work well.  By the second disc I found more of the episodes that I thought were funny. Comedy is pretty subjective, and so what one finds funny someone else might not, but I enjoyed Dennis Miller, Katt Williams, Kim Coles, Don Friesen & Ralphie May the most.

The dvd is a pretty bare bones production....just the episodes and nothing extra.  The opening bits already are dated with references that have come and gone.

Is it horrible?  No, not entirely.  Is it the best comedy I've seen in recent memory?  Absolutely not, but I did have moments where I thought that the comedy did work and when it worked it worked well.

I would say this is probably more for the ""Comics Unleashed"" fan only and not so much for someone with just an appreciation for good stand-up, which this is not.",1210723200,,1477,4.304347826086956
3339014,3,B0013D8M26,"This DVD set (2 DVDs) contains excerpts from Byron Allen's TV show of the same name. Each segment features a short monologue from Byron, then he hosts a panel of four other comics for a round robin of humor. The segments run about 18 minutes each, and while they announce breaks for commercials and cut to black, fortunately there are none of those obnoxious things to suffer through. (One big reason why I love DVDs of TV shows instead of broadcast TV.)

I don't know when these shows aired (I no longer watch broadcast TV), but it seems pretty recent as they mention Obama in one segment. The humor is generally pretty lightweight, as there really isn't enough time for four comics to get warmed up and truly crazy. There are exceptions, and some segments are funnier than others. There are a few outright adult moments, and the final segment with all female comics, which is definitely the best, does quickly launch into some pretty mature stuff (which I loved - these ladies are a scream).

While it mostly just made me smile, there were a few places that truly had me belly laughing. The comics are all good, and my biggest complaint is that there isn't enough. I want more. It felt rushed and was over way too fast. (How's that for a nice setup line?)

The DVD cover said there was a ""making of"" featurette, but I couldn't find it anywhere on the two DVDs. I knocked off one star for that major goof. I like that kind of behind-the-scenes stuff, and found it mildly annoying that it was missing.

I enjoyed seeing some of my favorite comics (Howie Mandel, Jon Lovitz, Rita Rudner, David Brenner) as well as finding new ones to like (all the others - see the listing for the set). This is good, solid humor, although not anything world shaking. I wouldn't run right out and buy a dozen copies, but I will certainly watch it again when I need a quick laugh, and will share it with friends.

There are gems on this set.  Ralphie May, Cedric the Entertainer, and Jon Lovitz did make me laugh through several of their jokes and skits.  On average though, I felt the jokes were simply not very funny or clever.  Most of the were mean-spirited.  I guess that's the point for some of the performers, but I tend to feel uneasy around mean-spirited humor.  I certainly prefer my redneck jokes to my put-downs and slams.  These days I look at comedians and wonder whether or not they could be funny without all the foul language and insults.  This DVD makes me wonder what has happened to the comedy world.

Are we so desperate for laughs we'll laugh at someone cussing out another person?  I may only be twenty-two, but I'm starting to feel old already.  Of course, as mentioned above I was expecting a different DVD.  If I had examined the description more carefully I certainly wouldn't have ordered this, because I know in advance that I don't like several of the comedians.

Byron Allen asks a question to someone ""when did you first get into comedy"" and the person answers then someone else jumps in with a funny reply, and so on.

So as I was looking more for single comedy acts.  This DVD is more like round table discussions.  Some people may be looking for this, and if you are, then this DVD is for you.

Some of these routines are quite good; some are weak; none, perhaps due to built in restrictions of the format, are brilliant.

What you get is a collection of episodes of a comedy talk show that began airing in September 2006, minus the commercials.  The format involves a host (Byron Allen), four guest comedians and a guest DJ.  The host enters to rousing applause, delivers a humorously-challenged intro, and then sits with his guests, feeding them previously agreed lines so that they can launch into their little funny bits on cue. The DJ makes some noise to fill any awkward moments, making him one of the hardest working members of the team.

The main topics covered are:
1. ""So how are you doing (insert name)?""
2. ""How many kids do you have, and how are they doing?""
3. ""Your worst date / Your last date / Have you ever had a date?""
4. ""Hitting on fellow panel members""
5. ""How about Madonna and those African babies?""
6. ""What are you up to now, and what's your website address?""

The performances of the comedians also fall into categories:
1. The Good: Cedric the Entertainer, Harland Williams, Rita Rudner, John Roy
2. The Bad: Byron Allen, Howie Mandel, Brad Garrett, Pauley Shore, Ralphie May
3. The Acceptable: Jon Lovitz, Tina Giorgi

""They're filming the show in HD, so if it's bad -- it will be clear"" - Byron Allen

Too bad no one took a cue from this and canceled this stinker before it got any further.

Byron Allen --

Allen is the kind of person that is rife in Los Angeles. Someone, who will try anything to ""break into the biz"", or ""get his shot"" and someone who has festered on the city like a bad fungus. He's the type of sycophant who goes to acting schools, yoga classes, singing lessons, self-help gurus and probably even applies 'medium bronze' self-tanner, daily, trying to master everything -- but never grasping the basics of one of them, or himself. He's the black male version of a Paris Hilton, which is probably more of an insult to Black Males than it is to Paris Hilton. His interviews always showed him to be self-absorbed and obnoxious. He's famous for doing absolutely nothing, unless you call being Host of multiple canceled shows something to be proud of. But how many more incarnations of Byron Allen must we see before everyone realizes that he's nothing more than a talentless hack, a groveling socialite and a wannabe?

I don't think that I've ever heard such dry, tired and haggard stand-up as I heard coming from Byron Allen's incredibly unfunny mouth. It was obvious that he had been coached, had over-rehearsed and had zero comedic timing. The joke about taking a picture of the $200 for the traffic light violation wasn't even his joke, but someone else's. I wish I could remember who it was that came up with that as I would inform them that Byron Allen is stealing their material and fronting with it on his show.

No amount of classes, coaching and B-List celebs will ever help the situation that is evident on these disks.

The Comics --

To the credit of the show, they really tried to book some really strong talent. But nothing seems to work and the show just struggles along not working for the entirety of the two disks. The look on Jon Lovitz face is priceless, as you can tell he's thinking that show will probably be canceled long before his segment airs. A similar look can be seen on the face of several of the other comics as well, even though they're struggling to be gracious to Allen. Most might think that this is a DVD full of stand-up comics delivering their best material, but it is not. It's really cheesy, episodic cable TV on disc, trying to recoup money for something that is not worth the asking price.

Harland Williams --

I once stood in front of Harland Williams in line to go see the movie High Fidelity at the El Capitan in Hollywood many years ago. He was there with some girl that he was trying to impress by being funny. The problem was that most of what he was trying was obnoxious. He sat a few seats over from me and I heard him whispering the same old tired material as the film progressed. I get the feeling that Harland Williams will try anything at all and just hope that something along the way will work, as the bulk of his humor fails to evince any laughter from the crowd. Most of what he does produce though, is nervous laughter and the anticipation to leave. Making a career out of that though is undoubtedly his trade mark. He has a Jon Gries / Steven Wright sense of timing and wit that only a select audience can appreciate.

Harland Williams appears in multiple places on the DVD, so beware.

The Audience --

It was clear that they tried to film as many shows as they could with the first audience. The first four shows repeatedly will flash back to the same young blonde audience members. You can also see them in the end credits as well. Some of the audience are behaving way too over the top as if they were paid. Several people looked as if they were having epileptic fits and others just looked downright bored or even angry. I freeze-framed the audience several times just to see some of the disinterested faces close up, just to make sure I was seeing what I thought I was seeing.

The DJ --

The DJ spinning in his little control booth above the rest of them also looked as if he might be Ted Kaczynski's little brother with a permanent scowl. What was up with that? Maybe he was just hoping the check from Byron Allen would clear so he could pay his overdue rent. He seemed to be working overtime trying to salvage the show like the Quartet on the Titanic, refusing to accept the fact that they were going down fast. The thundering bass during every commercial was just far too annoying.

The Show & DVD --

How many times are TV execs going to try to run with this over-used formula? Colin Quinn tried it, Tom Arnold tried it, Norm McDonald tried it, Chevy Chase tried it and even Adam ""Troll"" Corolla tried it. They  all failed -- because it was always a lame idea at 22 mins long. It just doesn't work.

I would skip this at all costs as it'll probably be one of those shows that will be offered up as free content online to lure in viewers to whatever website that might host this, as it's material that the studios can afford to dispose of. You can see better stand-up comedy on Youtube.

Check out James Inman, on youtube, if you're looking for independent impromptu comedy.

3339041,4,B0013D8M26,"If you are expecting a best of comedy routine, you will be greatly disappointed. I can't really recommend this to anyone, but like they say, different strokes for different folks.
Takes place in a television studio, in front of an audience. Some of the top names in comedy appear on the stage in groups of four. The DVD is a compilation of the Comics Unleashed TV show. When they say we are going to be right back, you knew they were going to take a break for a commercial. Fortunately, they flip a little logo, and get immediately back to the show.
Normally masterful comics perform over a period of time, enabling them to build themes, stories, and accumulated integrations. This is not like that. Although a centric theme is often created, it is often the case where the comics free form improvise on anything they want to say.
In addition to the occasional chuckle, this is just the feel good, crack a smile level of comedy. It is as much a conversation between the comedians as anything. Ok, when Howie Mandel showed the clip with the barber routine, and sprayed the guy with the hose, that was a side splitter. There were some bright spots amongst the ocassional chuckle.
This is a 2-disc set with total viewing time just 4 minutes shy of 3 hours; sort of like a mini-comedy library. I gave it 4 stars because I am a little tough on comedians. The laugh meter can vary from comic to comic, and skit to skit, and I am always looking to peg the meter. The real rating is 5 stars for the comedic lineup, and 1 stars for material.
I've only gotten to chapter 3 and 47 minutes of viewing. I must admit that I am looking forward to revisiting the rest of the DVD, although I am not over anticipating anything special. If you have a penchant for comedy, this DVD 2-disc set may satisfy some, but if you are looking for side splitting ""best of comedy"" I would pass.",1210204800,,1863,4.4186046511627906
3339042,2,B0013D8M26,"This DVD is billed as the 'Best' of Comics Unleashed. First off, the description of this is a little off. If you are looking at this in the hopes of seeing stand-up routines by the comics listed look some where else. This is more like a sit-down group where there are a few funny moments.

In terms of new material I was really disappointed that not much seemed new. In fact much of it has been repeated time and time again and has, for the most part, lost its luster of being funny.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoy comedy and enjoy stand-up comedy. But the ratio of funny stuff to mind numbingly boring stuff is skewed more towards the boring. For a rental this may be ok. But, I don't think I can recommend purchasing it.",1210204800,2,720,4.248175182481752
3339043,3,B0013D8M26,"Comics unleashed is a show hosted by comedian Byron Allen.  The format is one of a talk show with four comic guests.  I was really looking forward to watching this and it was pretty disappointing overall.

The first show was terrible. Mr. Allen's monologue was very dated material and the show spent so much time panning the audience that there was barely anytime to hear the wonderful comics.  It does improve as the shows go on, and on disc 2 there are a few very funny episodes.  I think they learned from their mistakes as they went along. The monologues were updated and they made more time for the comics to get some screen time. The show did introduce me to a few very funny comics I'd never heard of before; John Roy and Katt Willams were especially good.

There are some laugh out loud moments, but I expected more.",1210204800,,824,4.46
3339044,4,B0013D8M26,"Byron Allen, one of the best stand comedians on television, who has entertained audiences over the last three decades. In 1989, he became the host of a daily syndicated late-night interview program called The Byron Allen Show. This was set similar to the highly acclaimed The Tonight Show of NBC. In 2006, Comics Unleashed, a half hour comedic talk-show was produced and aired by the Entertainment Studios production company. The show features a panel of four guest comedians, and this is similar to the Comedy Central's show, Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn. In this DVD set of two discs, there is about 3 hours on great comedies performed by some of the best in the business. You get to watch Dane Cook, Cedric the Entertainer, Howie Mandel, Katt Williams, George Wallace, Harland Williams, Brad Garrett, Kim Coles, Margaret Cho, Kevin Pollak, Aries Spears, Dennis Miller, Ralphie May, Lisa Alvarado, Tammi Pescatelli, Tina Giorgi, Don Friesen, Godfrey, Jon Lovitz, Pauley Shore, Rita Rudner, David Brenner,  and Sheryl Underwood. If you are a fan of stand up comedy set in the style of The Tonight Show, then you will love this DVD set.

3339045,2,B0013D8M26,"Unfortunately I am not really bored. I like comics and generally enjoy watching comedy from time to time. I don't think I'm ready for a talk show where comics just wing it, especially when it sounds really scripted and forced at times.

Maybe I'm getting crankier as I age. Who knows. There were a few knee slappin' comments but Byron Allen's script writers gave him some pretty lame material to open the show. Another hint for the producers of this product: too many commercial breaks. Even with the commercials edited out I was irritated by the number of fade to black laugh track camera panning sequences I had to put up with. If you're going to make a show about comics sitting around jack jawing then don't do half of it with comics and the other half of it just fading to commercials!

Totally unbalanced ratio but I did laugh out loud at least twice while going through the two DVDs. Some of the material is pretty good but you'll have to put up with a lot of junk material to get the good stuff.",1210032000,2,1003,4.416216216216216

But it looks like it actually aired on Comedy Central. The guests sit around with Byron Allen and he throws out a topic and they each say a little something. Not a bad premise, but it just doesn't work. There are a ton of breaks for commercials and no one ever really gets going. ""Unleashed"" really doesn't fit at all. No one knows when to talk. They all seem a little uncomfortable and then relieved when the episode is done.

Bottom Line: This isn't all that funny. It was a chore to get through the entire two disc set.",1213660800,,685,4.229007633587786

This is a talk show hosted by D-list celeb host Byron Alen. It features a panel of comedians delivering obviously pre-written lines about uninteresting topics of discussion.

I would love to have seen clips of standup from the likes of Howie Mandell and the rest - but alas, it's not here. This is just clips of a (I assume) syndicated late night talk show you're likely to see on basic cable when you have insomnia and don't want to watch another infomercial for Kevin Trudeau's ""Secrets of Ripping-Off Consumers They Don't want You to Know About.""",1213315200,,679,4.745762711864407

The humor the comedians display within the segments (roughly 18 min.) ranges from ok to great, depending on the viewer's own taste in comedy. Presented in High Definition Full Frame (1.33:1) video and Dolby Surround 2.0 audio, the 2-disc (176 min.) set looks and sounds great.

8250311,2,B0013D8M26,"When it comes to ratings, I reserve the one star for products that I actually, legitimately hated.  Things that offended or angered me.  I came close to breaking my rule this time, but I didn't find this two-disc set anything to get riled up about.  Mostly it's just sad, punctuated by moments where it is plain baffling.

First of all: this show exists?  I have no idea who Byron Allen is, nor how he managed to wrangle together the funds it took to create his garish set.  Replete with swerving, multi-shaped lights, dozens of flickering televisions, an inexplicable shark tank, and an even more inexplicable DJ (mostly a guy called Cobra), the studio where this was filmed appears to be a big, busy carnival of pointless, art deco nonsense.

How odd, then, that our host, Byron, is such a bland, milquetoast, non-entity.  He starts each show with a few incredibly cliched banalities, embarrassing quips about airport security or Kevin Federline, and then proceeds to sit in a chair and feed cues to four gathered comedians who mostly just rehearse pre-planned bits to each other.

Byron, in one of the first shows, mentions that his idea for the show (as if it were unique to him) came about because he loved the get-togethers that would occur after comics had left the stages and had gathered together in diners, sharing tales, goofing off, bantering in the way that creates all really good comedy.

It's a good idea.  Perhaps he should try it out sometime.  Set the show in a diner, have exhausted comedians gather with beers or cocktails and just let them chat.  The few times where these episodes do elicit laughs are when the comedians get away from the planned material and just riff off of each other.  The final episode (the All-Ladies episode) and the episode with Dennis Miller and John Roy are good examples of this.  Still, even those episodes suffer from Byron's incessant need to prod his guests with achingly obvious non sequiters.  Someone will finish talking about plastic surgery, Byron will utter his Elmer Fudd-esque laugh, and then he'll turn to someone else and say, ""So, what do you think about airport security?""

Yes.  He talks a LOT about airport security.

Considering that this is a ""Best of"" compilation, I also have to express bewilderment at its size.  You have a total of eight episodes here on two discs.  And each episode lasts roughly 18 minutes.  ""We'll be right back,"" Byron says during each episode at least five times.  I suppose it's a good thing these are on disc, because it seems like on TV you'd be watching as many commercials as you would jokes.  There are four, sometimes five, different comedians vying for the chance to pound out a few one-liners, and in shows this brief, many of them completely don't exist.  I actually saw David Brenner fade away during the course of the first episode.

For a show that is so spotty, you'd think they'd go for quantity.  I happen to know for a fact that many DVDs can contain more than 70 minutes of video.  Cram a couple more episodes on those discs, or add some special features (my DVD case claims that it contains a ""Behind the Scenes Featurette,"" but this is not so).  In fact, the funniest thing about the set?  On the back of the DVD box it says, ""SPECIAL BONUS FEATURES INCLUDE: INTERACTIVE MENU.""  Ha ha!  Say goodbye to all your non-interacting menu woes.  Those lousy, frozen, nonresponsive menus?  A thing of the past!  Space-age technology has brought you bold ""up"" and ""down"" clicking action, with the sleek and sassy ""play all"" option!  Thank you, Science!

Now, Science, if you could only do something about all that lousy airport security.",1212019200,,3645,4.728571428571429
