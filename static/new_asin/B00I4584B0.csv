While I understand it was based on a play, it just wasn't my cup of tea.  I checked this out of the library, so it didn't cost me anything.  It's a good thing, too, as I wouldn't want to watch it again.",1415318400,,326,3.893939393939394
8639053,5,B00I4584B0,I would really have LIKED to have this stage play available to direct when I was in college.  What a delightful rendition.,1414195200,,122,4.545454545454546
8639054,1,B00I4584B0,"This was NOT a movie that I would have expected from Gerard Depardieu and Harvey Keitel. I really disliked this movie. I disliked the story line the acting, just all of it!!",1398816000,,173,4.4375
8639055,3,B00I4584B0,"This is a very minor, small film, but it is actually quite well done. Fans of Depardieu and Keitel (undoubtedly the only people who will even hear of or be interested in this film) will enjoy their performances here. Depardieu is very good, and Keitel is good but in a smaller, quieter, less showy role than Depardieu.

 Film concerns a little European village during WWII where a young boy plays games with the village fool (a WWI hero who survived a gunshot to the head, and is now a simpleton). A German soldier is found murdered, and the angry German occupation demands that the village identify, and turn over, the culprit by dawn, or the top ten leaders of the village will be executed in the morning. The minister, the mayor, the constable,the town doctor, etc., and their wives scheme to get out of this predicament by pursuading the village fool to take the blame for the crime, on the grounds it will be make him a martyred, war hero saint to their village, and they'll thus make monuments to his honor and so on. The young boy and friend is the only voice of reason that doesn't want the gentle giant to do it.  As morning marches near, we wonder what the outcome will be.

  Again, this is a very small film, that plays out much like a play. Much of the film is the town leaders spending the night trying to save themselves by talking the slow-witted big guy into being  their fall guy.

 Depardieu as the village fool makes for a very likable, sympathetic character. Keitel plays the slightly sinister town minister.

 Recommended to fans of the two lead actors, or perhaps just buffs of WWII era history and so on. Most others won't find much memorable here.",1398556800,2,1672,4.5215946843853825
8639056,5,B00I4584B0,"This film is an excellent piece of production work and fine acting throughout. I loved the way all the ""important"" people suddenly wanted to become ""nobodies,"" when challenged with having to take the blame for a crime. And trying to blame the ""village fool""?

You will be surprised how that ""poor soul"" (played by Gerard Depardieu) turns the tables on the high and mighty! There's a surprise ending, too (no, I'm not about to give that away!)

Don't miss, ""A Farewell to Fools.""",1396569600,,478,4.746987951807229
