3049861,4,B0010T3ULQ,"Originally released by Mill Creek Entertainment in 2008, this was one of their early editions to present their Crown International Catalog of films.  This ""Volume"" concentrated on the so called ""Sexploitation"" Drive-In fair.  While not bad, they are not exactly great either.  And they lack the ""Cheese"" factor that I enjoy so much.  But they are still classic Drive-In fare & have some intrinsic value.
  The 8 movies in this volume are as follows:  1) Pick Up 2) The Sisiter-In-Law 3) The Stepmother 4) The Teacher 5) Trip With Teacher 6) Best friends 7) Cindy & Donna 8) Malibu High
  Many of these are included in many other of Mill Creek's multipacks & all of these 8 are in the 32 pack of ""Drive-In Cult Classics""",1405123200,,719,4.642857142857143

One of the stories is one teenager wants to prove how sexy she is and gets it in the end badly if I can remember she's a high school girl and starts working as personal prositute.

"". . angry Alice. . ."": Apparently, there is a problem dating this film. The DVD case, or at least mine does, lists 1980? Wrong!! IMDB lists 1975. Which is probably correct!! Hurricane Alice struck in summer 1973. It would not be out of the realm of possibilities for a film like this to have been made in 1973. But not released until '75. But I still feel this film, in a way, was made kind of late, for some of the ideas it holds, I feel it is a last breath of the 60's and 70's.

This film has echoes of ""Easy Rider"" and ""Deliverance"". It is commenting on nature(like a nature documentary - by the way-the entire film is set and takes place in the Florida Everglades), spirituality, and again the time period in which it was released: the generation gap, sex and relationships.

'we had that car !' ...'my mom had a pair of those jeans'.... 'we had that same crappy gold shower trim and orange countertop !' LoL

There are some good & funny lines too. These flicks are more believable and life-like than big budget Films.
'A Trip With The Teacher' is a good suspense flick that exemplifies the Jim Morrison lyric, ""Theres a Killer On The Road... His Brain Is Squirming Like A Toad""

  My reason for buying this collection is to see, Best Friends (1975), starring Richard Hatch, 3 years before he played ""Captain Apollo"" in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battlestar-Galactica-The-Complete-Epic-Series/dp/B00018LTDI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battlestar Galactica - The Complete Epic Series</a>&nbsp;(1978-79). Finally I get to see the movie unedited and I had missed the ending before.

  Best Friends (1975)

  Two guys, Jesse (Richard Hatch) and Pat (Doug Chapin) have been friends forever.  They even went through the Army together. Now they are civilians again. The plan is to travel in a trailer with two women, Kathy (Susanne Benton) and Jo Ella (Ann Nolan), on the way to Stockton. Jesse wants to get married to his lady and settle down. Pat misses the good times with his buddy and wants to travel and have a wild times with him. He doesn't want his friendship with Jesse to end. Pat begins to turn his evil head.

The Teacher (1974)

Two teenage men, Sean (Jay North) and Lou (Rudy Herrera Jr), are having fun up in a loft of a warehouse. They are sharing binoculars looking at the naked ladies sunbathing on a boat. Suddenly, Ralph (Anthony James) yells at the guys and Lou, who is startled, slips from the stairs and falls to his death.
Now Ralph blames Sean for pushing Lou and killing his brother. He did no such thing. Ralph wants to kill Sean and threatens him not to tell the police.  Sean finds comfort in an older woman, Diane (Angel Tompkins), who is a teacher.

 Other movies are:

 Trip With the Teacher, aka, Deadly Field Trip (1975).
 Pick-Up (1975).
 The Stepmother (1972), aka, Impulsion. Starring Alejandro Rey, Larry Linville, Rudy Herrera Jr.
 Sister In Law (1974) Starring John Savage. That is also John Savage singing the song.
  The worst of this set is Cindy & Donna (1970) and Malibu High (1979). I would call them really cheap ""exploitation"" movies to the point of borderline pornographic.

 Some movies include male nudity, female frontal nudity and sexual situations.
  Most of the movies are from Crown International Pictures. Low-budget, bad dialogue, one-camera, cheap film.

 Well, if you wanted to be an actor or a filmmaker, you had to start somewhere. It paid the rent.

  All movies are rated ""R"", with the exception of Cindy & Donna, which is not rated.

  Two movies appear on each side of a disc in this 2-disc, 8 movie set.

3049899,3,B0010T3ULQ,"... in MALIBU HIGH:
  Throughout the film they've used the SCTV ""commercial break"" synthesizer cue. Unmistakable!",1273795200,,113,6.0
3049900,5,B0010T3ULQ,"As others have stated, there is nothing ""classic"" or ""cult"" about these movies since it's unlikely that anyone remembers even seeing them. But for the price, this 8 movie set really delivers the goods with movies typical of drive-ins and second run movie theaters.

Pickup - Two girls get picked up by a guy driving a mobile home type bus. After that things get really weird and your guess is as good as mine as to what the plot is. Both girls take their clothes off during the film so it's not a total loss. Very trippy.
The Sister in Law - Tries really hard to be serious. It goes from a drama about a guy and his affair with his brother's wife to a crime drama about drug running. Again, only the nudity keeps this from being a total bore.

The Teacher - A step up from the previous two if only for the appearance of the drop dead gorgeous Angel Tompkins who plays the titular Teacher. The story is about the unlikely seduction of a student by his Teacher, though no scenes are ever in the school itself. The student, who is a total idiot, spurns the advances of this smoking hot woman several times because he has to ""work in his van""! Sheesh!

Trip With the Teacher - The most violent one of the bunch. A group of female students and their teacher who are on a field trip get terrorized by a couple of deranged bikers. The poster of this film is the one used for the cover of the DVD box.

Best Friends - A road trip movie about two friends back from the war with different ideas as to what their lives should be. Things get messy when one of the friends lusts after the other's girl. Richard Hatch (Battlestar Galactica) stars in this one. Pretty Good.

The Stepmother - The title is misleading since the plot really doesn't revolve around the Stepmother in question but rather around a man who is trying to cover up two murders he committed, one out of a jelous rage and another accidental. A decent crime drama with some nudity to spice things up.

Malibu High - The gem of this set. This one is worth the price of admission alone. An attractive high school student goes from bad to worse as she first begins seducing her teacher for better grades, then turns to prostitution to have easy money and then ends up an assassin for the mob! Great stuff.

Cindy and Donna - All the movies feature nudity but this one excels in that department. Lots of skin around a bare bones plot of two sisters experimenting with sex and drugs. A highlight is a dance routine in a bar by a topless babe who has the best body in the entire 8 movie set.",1271030400,13,2540,4.301255230125523

but these were pure agony, fast forwarded thru much as it is sooo inane, the dialog is juvinile at best, the theme as well, the actors certainly never made it even in a high school drama production.

more often than not, when on some dialog jag, it goes on endlessly...you can fast forward and when back they are still yakking over the same issue...

I'm not too sure about the ""cult classic"" status of these flicks either, they're prettty much just 70's grind house B movies.

The presentations aren't the worst I've seen and in some cases pretty good. Most are in widescreen, so that helps.

3049903,3,B0010T3ULQ,"When a collection of eight movies costs less than five dollars especially when the packaging refers to them as ""Cult Classics"" it is definitely buyer (and viewer) beware. In this case caution is definitely advisable as depending on your appreciation of 1970's exploitation movies you may find these insufferable or morbidly entertaining. In rating them I am trying to be unbiased, but I have to admit that most of this set did very little for me. I am reluctantly settling on a three star rating as the best compromise available. Most of the films deserve one star reviews, but bearing in mind that most people purchasing this package will fully realize the sleaze they are buying and must therefore appreciate it, I decided that as a value proposition the package gives a lot of 70's B-movie running time for the price. If you are looking for actual good movies, you are definitely in the wrong place: this is nothing but a collection of insipid and implausible cheese.

""The Pick-Up"" is a plodding piece of garbage about three losers cavorting in the Everglades after their giant bus gets stuck in the mud. If it were only that simple, it would probably have been a middling picture, but no, they had to go and mix in lots of astral visions, psychobabble, and witchery to pad out the plot. While the movie does manage to prove that baby raccoons are very cute (don't even ask), most of the film is padding. There are lots of slow scenes of birds flying, walking through mud, all told at a snail's pace with terrible synthesizer background music at every turn. The three people on the bus are a young and irresponsible couple and a creepy witch-girl who likes to take us psychically back to subplots about disgusting priests, ancient rituals, caricatured politicians, and a very creepy clown.

The film suffers from many flaws, perhaps the worst of which is sound quality. It is frequently impossible to hear dialogue over background sounds and the musical score. Do not be too upset; this actually improves the quality of the viewing experience. The film also features the most awkward kissing lesson in screen history followed by highly improbable arboreal hijinks, and continuity issues galore, all leading up to the most unnatural performance featuring a stuffed animal in cinema history. The film is as boring as it is pointless, and is the worst film of the bunch, but it does have one redeeming quality: it's short.

""The Sister In Law"" dares you to suffer through it. Transparent and caricatured characters do and say predictable things in this tedious would-be potboiler. The entire production is laced with leaden dialogue like ""Every beast ought to lick his own wounds"", this intimate exchange between two brothers: ""What's the matter?""...""I itch.""...""You gotta' disease?"", and, of course, this turgid chestnut: ""I've had your wife and your mistress, and I threw your heroin into a mountain stream!"" In other words, this was supposed a cool, swinging flick, but like so many other movies from the 70's, is merely painful and trying.

All the characters here are absolutely repulsive, so it's difficult to sympathize with any of them, though we're supposed to be aligned with Bobby, the younger brother (John Savage). Older brother Edward is a mobbed-up irresponsible lout with a hussy for a wife. Here's a tip to the wise: don't mess with your insane cold-blooded mobster brother's wife. Or girlfriend. No good can come of it. In an unintentionally humorous subplot we learn that Edward is really just a confused writer who needs understanding and one good deal to get out of his heroin smuggling ways. You will not be convinced of this, or really anything else, for that matter for two primary reasons: first, the acting is generally awful (especially from Will MacMillan as Edward, who needs to take subtlety lessons from William Shatner); and second, the soundtrack makes watching a challenge as dialogue, music, and effects go from nearly inaudible even with the volume cranked to maximum, to ear-splittingly loud, all within seconds.

The movie has little to recommend it: insipid plot, terrible acting, bad audio, and one of the worst musical scores in film history. The theme song over the lengthy opening credits was so bad I finally had to break down and mute it, and the incidental music is even worse, especially the lengthy ""smuggling in Canada, with subsequent inappropriate aquatic disposal of heroin"" montage set to banjo music. For a film set in very exclusive parts of New York, the banjo montage was jarring at best, grating at worst. On the positive side, the clothes are hilarious, especially the denim leisure suit worn by mob boss ""Benjo"", who, it turns out, has the stupidest goons in organized crime.

Despite press materials (and the title itself) blaming the whole tawdry mess on a brazen woman, everything that goes wrong is really entirely Edward's fault; unfortunately no good deed goes unpunished, which you will discover (without any surprise) at the end of the film. I recommend that you don't watch this piece of garbage if you want to avoid punishment yourself. Ugh.

""The Stepmother"" is definitely the best movie of the eight, and is a decent potboiler about lust, betrayal, and murder from producer Hikmet Avedis (which is normally a warning sign). The film is carried by a great performance from Alejandro Rey as haunted architect Frank Delgado, who becomes embroiled in two separate murders. The film opens with terrible music and the murder of Delgado's wife's lover at the hands of an enraged Rey. While he seems to have put a lid on that successfully, Rey and Larry Linville (a prototype pre-MASH Frank Burns), his business partner, have both romantic and monetary issues to overcome, and Rey is a hothead with little self-control. I won't reveal what happens with Linville, but I will say that although contrived, it's interesting. The crimes are being investigated by a wannabe Columbo (Peter Falk has nothing to worry about) who, while none too bright, is extremely grating. Along with that distraction there are other negatives to the film, not the least of which is watching a bunch of fully dressed fifty-somethings frolic on a beach: I never need to see that. There are unexpected B-movie joys here, though, my favorite of which is without question the jazz-funk flute dance.

Although the film starts and ends with implausible coincidences and features completely moronic police work, the acting really does make the film highly watchable. The technical aspects of the film are middling at best and are very dated, especially the endlessly repeated freeze frame effect used for plot transitions. The subplot about the hot young stepmother, Margo, getting high and making a pass at her stepson is both repulsive and laughable. (This pass is extraordinarily clumsy, somewhat akin to the pass Torgo makes at Margaret in ""Manos: The Hands of Fate"".) Despite the obvious flaws, though, the film is very watchable and manages to overcome its history as an example of exploitation cinema, largely through the performance of Alejandro Rey.

""The Teacher"" is a piece of 1970's trash featuring a bizarre coming of age plot superimposed with an insane lunatic stalker plot. I give auteur Hikmet Avedis credit for trying to blend disparate plots, but the entire thing comes across as one contrivance after another. The plot concerns creepy stalking Vietnam veteran (of course) Ralph, who drives a hearse and lives in a grain silo overlooking the marina where public school teacher Diane keeps her yacht moored. He keeps his belonging in a casket, which I would have thought the police would have noticed during their investigation after his brother Lou falls to death from the top. Peeping Ralph blames Lou's friend Sean (Jay ""Dennis the Menace"" North!) for the death, which sets the full psychotic stalker plot in gear. Despite numerous sightings and threats to Diane and Sean, nobody ever once thinks to call the police. That was one logically challenged area of the film, but the other bit of incredulity revolves around the fact that a public high school teacher drives a Corvette, has a giant pool, and her own yacht. How much do teachers make in California, anyhow?

In the least credible part of the plot, teacher Diane and student Sean are on a first name basis with each other, and quickly move to other pastimes together, all while Ralph watches (and gets ever more jealous) and, most insanely, with the explicit encouragement of Sean's mother. The mother was definitely the creepiest element of the film for me. Along the way there are many ridiculous and embarrassing scenes: Diane washes her car in a full length dress, a gossipy restaurant scene provides the most inept flirtation ever, and last but not least, Diane's bedroom provides the backdrop for the most ludicrous use of an umbrella in filmmaking history (and yes, I have seen ""The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies."") The film has intentions to be creepy, and the ending is a bit out of the norm, although equally implausible and predictable.

""Trip With The Teacher"" is a typical schoolgirls-in-peril-from-bikers film. A couple of mean bikers and one nice biker meet up with the girls on their geology field trip (yeah, right) first at a gas station, and later when their bus breaks down in the middle of nowhere. The most evil biker, Al, who looks like Bono in Liz Taylor sunglasses, is a murderous thug with unwholesome intentions. As soon as the bus breaks down a catfight immediately erupts, halted only by the arrival of the dangerous bikers. The bikers tow the bus full of willing victims to a deserted cabin, where they quickly dispatch the bus driver, and quickly raise a question: did anyone even consider killing the bikers when their clothes were off and they didn't have access to their weapons? The good biker decides to become a hero and get help (who bothers to carefully don and adjust their helmet when running for their life in a bike chase?) While the boys are out dueling in the desert there are long, painful passages of staring at each other, which does nothing to further the plot, but pads the running time immensely. Then one of the most annoying actresses in screen history is dispatched to run and get help, but whines and snivels about how she is scared for what seems like hours: I was actually pulling for the biker in this instance. The ending requires quite a suspension of disbelief and concludes with smiles all around, except on the audience's face.

""Best Friends"" features future ""Battleship Galactica"" heartthrob Richard Hatch in another bit of motorhome mayhem, this one even more farfetched than ""The Pick-Up"": it may be the single stupidest road movie ever. Every single character in this film is insufferable, and nobody behaves similarly to reality. In essence the story is that two Army buddies get out of the service and take their girlfriends home with them in a giant camper. What's impossible to grasp is why the four would stay together for the entire trip such are the factions involved. The crux of the matter is that one guy wants to get married (Jessie; Richard Hatch) and the other guy (Pat; Doug Chapin) spends the entire film trying to break up Jessie's relationship so the two guys can have a life on the road. Especially after Pat resorts to manipulation and physical violence, there is no rationale for staying together, and that's why the whole movie seems utterly contrived. There's a big Pat-wants-Jessie's-girl-and-vice-versa subtext here (that is utterly implausible), and the conclusion to be reached is that these characters are only capable of doing whatever is stupidest in any given situation. When Jessie and Pat have a feud over Kathy, why don't they leave in the camper, after all Pat bought a motorcycle for some reason. When threatened, leave.

There is some of the stupidest gunplay in history in this film (Let's get drunk and shoot lizards with a pistol!), culminating in a painful scene proving that Jessie is a poor shot with tragic results (no extra points for guessing) leading unsurprisingly to a pointless, unresolved ending. This film is an absolute chore to watch and should have ended the careers of everyone involved; Richard Hatch should consider himself very lucky.

""Cindy and Donna"" is the only movie of the eight besides ""The Stepmother"" featuring girls who are actually pretty. The plot is a tawdry coming-of-age piece featuring the worst parents of the 70's (which is certainly saying something) and their two saucy and irresponsible children. There are occasionally amusing diversions like when the prostitute uses a Dremel tool on Dad's chest hair, and inner struggles about how far is too far to go on a date (I call this section of the film ""Torrid Chastity"".) The soundtrack is very grating, and the banjo-intensive driving music is almost too much to endure (as is a curious trend in this DVD set). The cast and characters are unrelentingly awful, and they whole thing is a voyeuristic and uneasy exploration of pubescent possibilities. Despite the pretty girls, I really loathed this movie. The ending is particularly ludicrous, but at least it's over.

""Malibu High"" features Kim, a lazy, homely, stoner, drunk high school senior working her way through her teachers to get A's to enable her to graduate. The skank is trying to forget her high school sweetheart, Kevin, who is now dating a rich brat. I will particularly warn you about the high school disco scene, which requires a very high pain threshold to get through, and which does not go the way Kim intends. After the disco she gets the idea to use her wily feminine charms to seduce her male teachers to enable her to graduate. I will tell you that if you are expecting this to be erotic in the slightest, you will be gravely disappointed. Through her serial seductions, she turns pro, and then becomes an assassin for hire as well. This is perhaps one of the least plausible life-of-crime conversions in film history, and you will be especially entertained by the way she bumps her principal off. Eventually she is assigned on orders ""from Chicago"" to kill the father of Kevin's new girlfriend (how's that for justice?), and is assured by her handler ""There's absolutely nothing that can go wrong!"" Needless to say, he's horribly incorrect, and the hit turns into a disaster, although there is some fortunate elimination of annoying characters. The film concludes with a run down a beach and is very reminiscent of the conclusion in ""The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living And Became Mixed-Up Zombies"", although without the deft directorial or acting skills of the Ray Dennis Steckler classic.",1258070400,22,14733,4.947070707070707

3049905,4,B0010T3ULQ,"I don't see many movies and these films are from an era in my life when I was trying to be far more serious. Now that I have retired and look back mainly as a way of engaging in 40 years of recapitulation of the Vietnam war, three of these movies tell me a lot about the nature of American life. ""Malibu High"" (1979) tells me how bad choices can make people advance in the wrong direction, like the American economy has been rolling in money like a bobsled rocketing down clear through to China. Each step in the plot takes a girl further along in seeing what trouble is all about. ""The Sister In Law"" stars John Savage, who was in the Deer Hunter, but I think the interesting character is a younger brother who thinks he has supernatural powers so everything that he does will turn out right, even if he does not know what is going to happen next. ""Cindy and Donna"" mainly has girls being seduced by guys with abject reactions by people who stumble in when the worm has turned. ""The Teacher"" was a movie I thought was creepy. After watching a few other movies, I was not ready to see more than one minute of ""The Stepmother."" There are times in life, as in the movies, when someone gets killed, but if you don't like those times, don't watch ""The Teacher"" and you might not want this set of movies as much as you think.",1254441600,,1320,4.2629482071713145

I was surprised at how little the movies actually cost, considering there are eight in the set.  But as I trudged through each one (fast-forwarding through the majority) I realized nothing worthwhile is cheap.  These movies are campy and unbelievable. The story lines are non-existent and the sex scenes leave a lot to be desired...like sex.  Malibu High was a cinematic trainwreck...the gratuitous nudity (which was not exactly pleasing or tasteful) was the only interesting thing about the ""cult classic"" The pimp in the movie looks like a weasel and the Lolita prostitute can't seem to find a client under 60.

Malibu High is accidentally funnier than most comedies are on purpose.  Malibu High alone is worth the purchase price of this DVD set.  Because it is so awesome I forgive the set's overcompression.

3049912,4,B0010T3ULQ,"If you listened to many film critics, they'd say that the 1970s was the last great era of movie making, a time before studios became obsessed with the blockbuster and special effects over substance.  It was the era of The Godfather, Network, Taxi Driver and a lot of other great movies.  As Drive-In Cult Classics demonstrates, however, there was plenty of garbage in that era too.

This set of eight movies from Crown International Pictures features some movies that are cheesy fun but by no stretch are any of these films good or even average.  Using the Amazon rating scale, these range from one to two stars, though some have a so-bad-they're-good quality.  Not all of them, though.

Each of the two discs contains four movies, two to a side.  On Disc One, Side One is The Pick-Up and The Teacher.  The Pick-Up is a complete mess, exacerbated by the fact that the no-talent director tries to be artistic.  The story - what little there is of it - involves two young women who hitch a ride with a guy with a motorhome.  They get stuck in the Everglades and while awaiting rescue, sleep with each other and have various hallucinations and flashbacks.  It's borderline porn, which might be fine if it wasn't so poorly made (though admittedly, some of the nature scenery is nice).  The Teacher's tag line states that ""she corrupted the youthful morality of an entire school"".  In reality, the title character only gets involved with one former student, played by former Dennis the Menace Jay North.  As with all these movies, there's plenty of gratuitous nudity, but this one also has the semblance of a coherent story.

The flip side has Best Friends and Trip with the Teacher.  Best Friends also has a big name star (well not big, but at least someone you've heard of):  Richard Hatch, Apollo on the original Battlestar Galactica.  It's another road trip story in which Hatch, his best friend and their two girlfriends take a motor home across the country.  The close quarters and the best friend's psychological problems create issues.  Trip with the Teacher has a teacher escorting some high school students (all beautiful girls, naturally) on a weekend trip.  Along the way, they run afoul of a couple bikers.  It's one of those movies in which all the characters act stupidly and seem unable to conceive ways to get out of trouble (despite outnumbering the two bikers three-to-one).

Disc Two, Side One has The Sister In Law and The Stepmother.  The Sister In Law seems to be the only movie not made on a shoestring budget, but it is still only two shoestrings.  John Savage from The Deer Hunter play the prodigal son who has come back into the fold, just in time to be seduced by his brother's wife.  The brother is involved with drug dealers, and soon enough, so is Savage, but at least not all is lost:  he gets to sleep with his brother's mistress too.  The Stepmother has Larry Linville (Frank Burns on M*A*S*H) but only in a supporting role.  Alejandro Rey plays the lead character, a husband whose fits of jealousy lead him to murder.

Things get really trashy on the final side.  Malibu High is the story of a high school senior who, dumped by her boyfriend and failing all her classes, decides to start sleeping with her teachers to boost her grades.  She also becomes a prostitute for the cash, and later a hit woman.  Cindy and Donna is bottom-of-the-barrel, about two sisters.  The bad one sleeps with any guy (including her step-father!) and the good one wants to be bad.  With plots that go nowhere and an ending so abrupt and out of left field that you get the feeling the director must have realized he was about to run out of film, this is laughably bad.

There are some common factors in these movies.  As stated before, they all have plenty of nudity and are clearly the product of the free-love seventies.  Many of the films look like R-rated versions of Afterschool Specials, in which sex and drugs lead inevitably to tragedy.  Whenever parents are shown, they are completely ineffective, either out-of-touch or completely disinterested in their kids.  Women seem to merely exist to have sex with (though once they have a kid, they become useless); the only lead women to have legitimate jobs are the two teachers.

With no extras (not even a scene selection menu), the desirability of this set is purely based on the quality of the movies.  So how does a set like this merit four stars?  Because, despite their awfulness (or maybe because of their awfulness), some of these moves are actually fun to watch.  Others (particularly The Pick-Up and Cindy and Donna) are exercises in tedium.  And this set delivers exactly what it promises:  trash.",1247097600,11,4671,4.697044334975369
3049913,3,B0010T3ULQ,"These films for the most part are neither cult movies nor are they classic.  However, the drive-in moniker is dead on, and if you enjoy 70's b-films that are slow-medium paced, with a lot of swimming pools, sunsets, joint smoking, feathered hair, tight white pants, vans, motor homes, motorcycles, bummer endings, gratuitous T & A (in most of them), and occasionally hilarious moments of really bad dialogue and acting, then this is a good set, especially for the price.  My only gripes are 1) the sound is often a bit muffled, gets better if you have it through a stereo and can thin it out with more treble/less bass; 2) no subtitles.  these films are perfect to set it and forget it, kill the sound and put on a record, but it'd be nice to still be able to follow the story with subtitles.  3) the provided summaries are sometimes misleading.  But these are minor complaints considering the overall pleasure-to-dollar ratio available here.  Drive-in movies were a genre all their own, and shrugged off the burden of plot like it was just some unnecessary hassle.

MALIBU HIGH
Worth the price of admission alone.  This is the one that really shines out of this bunch.  Much stronger language than all of the others, classic dialogue (""Maybe if you weren't so concerned about dirt, and dust, and greasy buildup, then Daddy wouldn't have left, and wouldn't have had to kill himself because he couldn't get it up anymore!""), plenty of salaciousness, and great low budget jaw-dropppers like a high school dance that takes place in a Mexican restaurant, not to mention wicked 70s wall-rugs and phrases like ""Check you later!""  Malibu High RULES.  If only they could all be this good.

CINDY & DONNA
The second best film in this set, and a classic theme song.  Donna is the slutty older sister that ultimately lures the uptight Cindy into a trampy lifestyle.  Tame by today's standards but otherwise not for the prudish.  One of many with an astonishingly abrupt ending.

THE TEACHER
Pretty entertaining by virtue of its lameness.  The by-line on the package is totally misleading, however - she does not 'corrupt the morality of an entire school,' not by a long shot.  This one features a lovely, Cheryl Ladd-ish teacher figure - it's summer vacation so other than one shot outside the school during the opening credits, there is no school-related activity whatsoever.  This has very TV-style acting, shooting, everything, then the obligatory T & A every 20 mins or so.  It's like watching The Brady Bunch with partial nudity plus some light crime.  The goofy villain, Ralph, is a hilarious scene-stealing goon.  What's unfathomable is why the Teacher would be interested in a dork like Sean who greatly prefers working on his van to having sex.  Seriously, count the number of times he references working on his van, it's insane.  This one also has a classic theme song that  plays through 75% of the movie.

BEST FRIENDS
Weird flick.  Goofus and Gallant take a motor home on a multi-state trip as one last fling to celebrate Goofus getting out of the Army and Gallant getting married.  But Goofus just can't face the end of the footloose good times with his buddy, so he sets about to destroy the impending marriage.  Ann Noland really shines in this movie as Jo Ella - she's got a great spontaneity and charm.  But questions linger: where the hell did Goofus put his motorcycle when he was riding in the motor home?  And why didn't Gallant just waste him?  Pretty classic drunken strip scene in an Indian bar.

THE SISTER IN LAW
This is actually a fairly serious movie about two bearded brothers from a well-to-do family.  The elder brother, Edward, was a briefly successful writer who has since fallen into wearing white turtlenecks and performing deliveries for organized crime types who have a flair for dramatically handing envelopes to one another.  His marriage to a gorgeous though small-nippled woman is dissolving when the younger brother, Robert, our protagonist, returns to the swank family house from his idealistic exploration of America.  Swimming in the pool, wearing tennis clothes, and banging Edward's older soon-to-be ex-wife suddenly loses interest when Edward shows up with his mistress, another lovely woman just about Robert's age.  Eventually Edward has a movie opportunity in L.A. right about the time he's scheduled to do a particularly risky package pickup in Canada, and he gets Robert to do it for him by letting him bring the mistress along.  Plays out like a pretty good auteur type of film of the period if you're down with the laid-back 70s pacing.

THE STEPMOTHER
This one looks & feels like an extended episode of Barnaby Jones or Police Woman.  The only thing remotely 'cult classic'-ish about it is 1) there's a scene where the elite group of friends are dancing during the daytime at the beach house to flute music...and one of the dudes is revealed to actually be playing a flute, and 2) a scene where the cops bring in 'Sanchez'  or 'Lopez' or whoever and the guy lays out a very 70s racist caricature of the hot-blooded Latino.  Otherwise you'll swear you're watching TV at 12:30 at night in 1972.

TRIP WITH THE TEACHER
No relation to The Teacher.  This one is pretty dark.  Two creepy bikers trap 4 or 5 teenage girls and their teacher in an abandoned shack and proceed to torment and rape them while they cry.  If you like relentlessly hopeless situations like in Cape Fear, then have at it, but this is not for me.

PICK UP
Why this one is presented first I can't imagine - it is easily the most boring one in the bunch. Two lovely young women catch a ride with a 70s dude who is driving a motor home through Florida.  Ultimately it becomes soft porn in a swamp, with some psychedelic scenes of ambiguous mysticism, interspersed with hostile phone calls from the fat sweaty man expecting the motor home to be delivered to its destination in a timely fashion.  Oh, and some flashbacks about being molested in a church.  Don't expect a happy ending, or a payoff for all the shots of sunsets, roadside landscapes, blah blah blah.",1246320000,149,6071,4.75717017208413
3049914,5,B0010T3ULQ,"Bought this weeks ago at the current $5 asking price on amazon.  Just barely bothered to finish the last of the eight so i decided to write my own impressions.  Its been awhile since i've seen all so i might make a mistake or two.  I'm not sure how to review this(do i factor in the $5 price, the exploitation angle, the cheese-to-entertainment ratio? I don't know), so i'm just gonna slap a 5-star rating and give my impressions of each and let you decide.

* The Sister-In-Law:  Arguably the only thing in this set that could be mistaken for a film.  It starts off like a sexploitation, and i would've been happy at that.  But it veers off into a mafia crime-drama of sorts.  I would've been annoyed at that, but i was already caught up in the story and characters to care at that point.  And the ending.  Not sure how others felt, but i was very satisfied with how it ended.  Definitely worth a watch.

* Malibu High:  Arguably the most entertaining, and goofiest movie out of all of them.  Exploitive, cheesy, and mostly enjoyable; it's also very off-kilter.  The lead actress at times looked and acted as if she was from a 60's movie, while most of the others were from a 70's movie.  The styles/settings looked as if they ranged from the late 60's, to the 70's, and even early 80's, to me anyway.  I guess that's why it was so oddly compelling to watch.  Well, that and the crazy hooker-turns-hit-woman plot.  Worth a watch.

* Cindy and Donna:  Here it is.  This is what you were looking for when you bought this set.  It's cheap and cheesy, but if you wanted sexploitation(softcore), you found it.  Whether it's the subject matter(incest/promiscuity/etc), the softcore scenes(i lost count), or the actresses(creepily young), it's all here.  Worth a watch, and shower afterwards.

Those 3 are worth the $5 admission price in my opinion.  Next...

* The Stepmother:  Winner of what could've been.  The lead actress is extremely cute.  Problem is the movie plays out more like a detective drama than a sexploitation.  Btw, there is this pool table seduction scene that is kinda hot, but it abruptly ends!  Either it was poorly edited, or this is a cut version.  Like i said, with such a hot lead actress, what could've been.  Still worth a watch.

* Trip with the Teacher:  I'm not into rape scenes, and there are a few non-explicit ones in this, so i felt uncomfortable watching it.  But for those who like that sorta thing, it's there.  Not graphically, but it's there.  The ensemble works well together.  Exploitive all-around, so worth a watch, i guess.

Those two are worth a watch for the most part.  So there's your 5 hard-earned bucks right there.  Next...

* Best Friends: This is ok if you want to see Apollo from Battlestar Galactica make out a couple of times.  Not very exploitive and drags a bit, but still worth a watch maybe as the performers try their best with the material given.

* The Teacher: Disappointingly NOT exploitive.  Except for a few minor scenes, it looks like it could've been a tv movie-of-the-week.  The lead actress looks great, but the movie itself was slow and uneventful to me.  Barely worth a watch.

* Pick-Up:  My least favorite.  I suppose if you were part of the 70's, high, and into 'artsy' pretentious films you would enjoy this.  Problem is, i don't remember the 70's much, was not high or drunk while viewing this, and the ending just made me feel cheated.  But you paid for this 8-pack, so go for it.

The last 3 i didn't find very exploitive, entertaining, or interesting but that's just me.  Apparently there are some fans of The Teacher and The Pick Up so who knows, i might be too hard on them.  All 8 films are obviously of varying pic/sound quality with The Teacher maybe looking the best and Best Friends looking the worst.  The set i bought came on one dvd case, so it's very convenient and a space saver.  And since these aren't AFI film classics, you won't mind the 2-sided discs.  Overall, I'd recommend this set, for $5 or less.",1244592000,10,3994,4.548660084626234

Watching these movies is a waste of time, they aren't scary or interesting at all unless you just want to see girls take their tops off which I know some people do.

3049918,4,B0010T3ULQ,"Let me begin this review by mentioning the earliest film of the eight included here, ""Cindy & Donna.""
Let me steer your attention to this forgotten gem from 1970, especially if your partial to redheads...wow.

Okay, onto the review:

Pickup:
The latest film of the batch, 1980's ""The Pickup"", almost seems as if it's from an ealier time, with it's voluptuous, mystical hippe chicks & mobile homes.
There is a very disconcerting scene involving a clown in a meadow, that seemed to drift in from another flick.
There's also a lot of nudity split between the two female leads.

The Sister in Law:
Despite the title, this film is excellent & well directed & acted.
The story absorbs you, and the ending is somewhat heartbreaking.

The Stepmother:
The male lead's accent is a bit distracting, but the story is quite interesting.
Murder, cover-ups, unfaithful partners...
And, of course, the tragic finale.

The Teacher:
Creepy stalkers driving about town in Hearses, Voyeuristic teenaged boys, dimwitted parents, clueless, seduced adolescents...
All of this, plus a kid falling off a twenty story building!

Trip with Teacher:
Zalman King, as the demented biker bad-boy, is the star of this show.
He & his somewhat reluctant brother, follow & capture a school bus of precocious female students.

Best Friends:
What do you do if you discover your best buddy is a sociopath, hell-bent on ruining your life?
Try & shoot him, of course (in your underwear...on the beach).

Cindy & Donna:
Cindy, Cindy, Cindy!
This isn't the Brady Bunch, as the teenaged daughters mirror the destructive ways of their parents.
This one features a ""no rating"" and within the first ten minutes, it's easy to understand why.
I dare you not to hum along to the ""Cindy"" theme song, played throughout this film!

Malibu High:
Almost as good as ""Cindy & Donna.""
Probablly better.
Ahhhhh, Cindy....",1239148800,10,1863,4.964630225080386

In all honesty, some of these films were so bad that I watched mostly in fast forward mode (particularly the Pick Up, which seemed to require the use of some mind-altering substance to understand).  I suffered through the entirety of half of them, though, and none of those were particularly interesting in either a good or bad way.  There is some bad dialog and acting that's laugh inducing here and there (particularly in Cindy & Donna and Malibu High), but for the most part these movies seem to exist for only one purpose:  to provide soft-core fodder for straight men.  Thus you get to see topless young women (most of whom aren't particularly attractive) in every film and lots of rolling-around kissing scenes.  If that sort of thing is your bag, then you might like these movies.  I just found them tedious.",1230854400,15,960,4.6726190476190474

3049928,5,B0010T3ULQ,"The Top 10 things about the 70s I learned from Drive-In Cult Classics #1

10. Getting lost in an RV was popular.
 9. Most young girls ran around nekkid.
 8. All relationships ended in tragic violence.
 7. Being chased on foot for a long time was common.
 6. Hitmen were everywhere and would kill you for very little money.
 5. Being chased in a vehicle for a long time was common.
 4. Only bad guys had tattoos and usually they had just one.
 3. Female teachers dated their male students as much as they do today.
 2. If a dude was riding a motorcycle that dude was trouble.
 1. Folks got stabbed and shot a lot.

MY SUPER SHORT REVIEW OF EACH OF THE 8-MOVIES:

Pick Up - Maybe they made this one for just for pot smokers. I don't know.

The Sister In Law - Very good movie. Great storyline and acting.

The Stepmother - The least of the 8-films by a landslide. Larry Linville is M.A.S.H. to me and nothing else.

The Teacher - Even though this is a common true life story that seems to make headlines at least twice a year it's a great one to watch.

Trip With The Teacher - Watch this one first. It's excellent.

Best Friends - This is like a book you can't put down and Richard Hatch never did anything near this good on Battlestar Galactica.

Cindy & Donna - This one is rated ""Not Rated"". Watch this movie with your entire family and have them all vote on what they would rate it. You should have all votes in very early in the movie and they will all be the same vote. If your name is Cindy, you will love the Cindy song that plays in the background several times. Well, maybe Cindy won't like it but if you know someone named Cindy it's funny.

Malibu High - Either watch this one first or second. It has SCTV's going to break sound effect in it several times. This is one crazy movie. Malibu High probably was in danger of losing its accreditation after all that went on there.

EXTRA BONUS REVIEW:

All 8-movies contain very pretty girls of the 70s. The DVD is titled ""Drive-In Cult Classics"" but when you put the DVD and click on a movie the doors of a walk in and sit down theater swing open. This is a great movie collection for the money. All of the movies are very watchable and very entertaining if you lived during the 70s and experienced drive-in movies. Remember, this is a collection of ""cult"" movies. That means they are not for everyone. Horror fans would love this collection.",1229212800,30,2398,4.2727272727272725
3049929,4,B0010T3ULQ,"These movies are camp, sleaze, sexploitation, low bidget, and great! My favourite being ""Cindy and Donna"" though ""The Step-Daughter"" is quite good too.

What makes these movies appealing could depends on the person.  I'm sure that some people have memories of these films, or films like these... or at least could hear these films in the background while they were attending to alternative drive-in entertainments.  But these films have a wider appeal than just that.  There's also the tanilizing eroticism of some films.  All the films were made between 1970 and the early 1980's (I think 1983 is the year that the most recent film was made) and younger audiences be interested in seeing film from that period (and the clothes, furniture, automobiles, etc.)

These movies are not for children.  And they should not be taken too seriously either.  Be warned; if you're looking for some ""amazing"" movie, then you're looking at the wrong collection.",1227225600,2,947,5.064516129032258

3049931,1,B0010T3ULQ,"I loved being able to nostalgisize (my own word) by watching these, but the video quality seems no better than a vhs tape (or maybe worse.)  Detail is poor, shadows are empty of content, etc.  Upconverting dvd players don't really help much with this dvd.",1226707200,12,255,4.644444444444445
3049932,5,B0010T3ULQ,"Ahhh, the 70s, drive-ins, no cell phones, no texting, bad hair, groovy duds... this is the perfect purchase for lovers of all things 70s cheese. First of all, I love Zalman King and he is so freaky-deaky in Trip with the Teacher...finally this violent, warped, nutty gem is out on DVD. His performance is really creepy and intense. Zalman was actually a really interesting actor, wish he would have done more than act in three movies I am aware of. For those who don't know, he went on to direct, most notably, Wild Orchid.

Malibu High was the surprise treat; talk about a crazy, fun, bad girl flick. The acting is horendous, the plot out of this world funny, and if you love these sorts of cult (especially 70s), B and C movies with non-sensical editing, bongo tracked chase scenes, sleazy soft core, roll around simulated sex scenes, teenagers in peril or ""growing up too fast"" you cannot go wrong with this collection. Malibu High and Trip with the Teacher are worth the cheap price alone.

I have a couple more to watch and found the Pick-up to be too boring to watch in entirity (spacy drug stuff, not much dialog a half hour into it/would rather watch Psych-Out). Maybe I'll have more patience some other day. Cindy & Donna was kind of funny & warped (great scenes with the MOM..her drunken dialog and delivery are brilliantly bad), but the movie is annoyingly disjointed and could have been better. There were lots of scenes of teenage Cindy sitting in her room alone touching herself, putting clothes on, taking them off, her existence & expression at times was so boring I wanted to shoot myself. And, fair warning: her ""half"" (this is significant because the Dad in this flick is ""Dad"" to Cindy, Step Daddy to Donna) loose sister has her share of borderline gag inducing sex scenes and her breasts are no joy to behold...also the Dad is GROSS and likes 'em young (and in his house sometimes, if ya catch my drift). Yeppers...1971 and a family unit to behold. If this is the sort of family unit that so many refer to as being ""lost"" and in danger of decline, I think we should all be grateful.

The Step Sister was sort of interesting (starring a young John Savage) and I don't have much to elaborate upon...still worth a check. The Teacher was truly funny (non-intentionally, of course) and stars a ""grown-up"" Dennis the Menace coming of age (in those simulated roll around sex-scenes) with his saucy, blond teacher.

I am off to check out the Stepmother and Best Friends...

I was pleasantly surprised to find that not only have most of these films been remastered into better versions, but the aspect ratio is actually 16x9 on widescreen monitors. If you watch these on a 4x3 television, the image will be squeezed. All 8 titles are in widescreen and anamorphically enhanced.

The films are a mixed bag; I was never a fan of ""Malibu High"", even when I saw it at a drive-in when it was released, but ""The Teacher"" is a great film with a classic ending. Much has been written about ""Trip With The Teacher"" on other sites due to Zalman King's appearance, but little has been said about Howard (Hikmet) Avedis' excellent ""The Stepmother."" Avedis was one of the best and most consistent directors for Crown in the 70's, and it's good to have both ""The Teacher"" and The Stepmother"" here for people to rediscover.

""The Sister-In-Law"" features a good performance by John Savage that hints at his breakthrough with ""The Deer Hunter"" a few years later, and ""The Pick-Up"" embodies most of what classic sexploitation had (sex, violence, nudity, moral ambiguity).

Two of the gems in this collection have not been available previously in a decent video format: ""Cindy and Donna"" is in surprisingly good condition considering the age of the material (1970) and the fact that it got quite a limited release. And for all you Susanne Benton fans out there, it's good to finally have ""Best Friends"" to watch. It's a bit more serious than some of the other offerings, but still delivers the goods. Now if we could only have ""That Cold Day In The Park""...

The Crown International films were drive-in staples, and I'm glad to see this collection doing them justice. My favorite Crown picture of them all is ""The Pom Pom Girls"" which is on the SCHOOL DAZED COLLECTION. There are no chapter listings for the films, but they do have (random) chapter stops. There are no trailers or any extras for the films either. But c'mon, ""The Teacher"" in 16x9 anamorphic for $4.99 with 7 other titles? You just gotta get it!",1211155200,42,2157,4.683377308707124

I previously owned ""The Teacher"" on VHS and also have the first DVD release from Westlake, which is apparently a bootleg!! I read somewhere else that these new DVD versions are all officially approved by and were taken directly from the vaults of Crown International Pictures, who first released them back in the 1970's. If you haven't ever seen ""The Teacher"", it alone is more than worth the price of the set, which is already a great bargain. ""The Stepmother"" is also very interesting and worthwhile for fans of actress Katherine Justice, who appeared in the very first Columbo show in 1967 and was then a familiar face on such shows as Gunsmoke and Cannon. You certainly never saw her topless and bare-bottomed on any of those shows anyway!! If you love the old 1970's drive-in films this DVD set is a must have!! My only complaint is that the 8-films are on four double-sided DVD's which can be tricky to handle without leaving fingerprints.

And the movies are great, if you are into 1970s camp.  There are conflicts that come about in people's lives in every film, the conflicts usually the result of a sexual/romantic situation.  Somebody central to the film dies in every one of them.  Bellbottoms and other 70s paraphernalia (disco music, tight jeans, feathered hair, etc.) are widely represented.  The music is cool in that ""Convoy"" kind of way.  Really, for exploitation fare the stories are pretty compelling, but still just offbeat enough to give you the campy giggles.  I would pay $10 for any one of these movies - getting 8 of them at that price almost makes me feel like I have stolen something.",1202774400,168,796,4.759124087591241

But they are still classic Drive-In fare & have some intrinsic value.
  The 8 movies in this volume are as follows:  1) Pick Up 2) The Sisiter-In-Law 3) The Stepmother 4) The Teacher 5) Trip With Teacher 6) Best friends 7) Cindy & Donna 8) Malibu High

"". . angry Alice. . ."": Apparently, there is a problem dating this film. The DVD case, or at least mine does, lists 1980? Wrong!! IMDB lists 1975. Which is probably correct!! Hurricane Alice struck in summer 1973. It would not be out of the realm of possibilities for a film like this to have been made in 1973. But not released until '75. But I still feel this film, in a way, was made kind of late, for some of the ideas it holds, I feel it is a last breath of the 60's and 70's.

This film has echoes of ""Easy Rider"" and ""Deliverance"". It is commenting on nature(like a nature documentary - by the way-the entire film is set and takes place in the Florida Everglades), spirituality, and again the time period in which it was released: the generation gap, sex and relationships.

There are some good & funny lines too. These flicks are more believable and life-like than big budget Films.
'A Trip With The Teacher' is a good suspense flick that exemplifies the Jim Morrison lyric, ""Theres a Killer On The Road... His Brain Is Squirming Like A Toad""

  My reason for buying this collection is to see, Best Friends (1975), starring Richard Hatch, 3 years before he played ""Captain Apollo"" in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battlestar-Galactica-The-Complete-Epic-Series/dp/B00018LTDI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battlestar Galactica - The Complete Epic Series</a>&nbsp;(1978-79). Finally I get to see the movie unedited and I had missed the ending before.

  Best Friends (1975)

  Two guys, Jesse (Richard Hatch) and Pat (Doug Chapin) have been friends forever.  They even went through the Army together. Now they are civilians again. The plan is to travel in a trailer with two women, Kathy (Susanne Benton) and Jo Ella (Ann Nolan), on the way to Stockton. Jesse wants to get married to his lady and settle down. Pat misses the good times with his buddy and wants to travel and have a wild times with him. He doesn't want his friendship with Jesse to end. Pat begins to turn his evil head.

The Teacher (1974)

Two teenage men, Sean (Jay North) and Lou (Rudy Herrera Jr), are having fun up in a loft of a warehouse. They are sharing binoculars looking at the naked ladies sunbathing on a boat. Suddenly, Ralph (Anthony James) yells at the guys and Lou, who is startled, slips from the stairs and falls to his death.
Now Ralph blames Sean for pushing Lou and killing his brother. He did no such thing. Ralph wants to kill Sean and threatens him not to tell the police.  Sean finds comfort in an older woman, Diane (Angel Tompkins), who is a teacher.

 Other movies are:

 Trip With the Teacher, aka, Deadly Field Trip (1975).
 Pick-Up (1975).
 The Stepmother (1972), aka, Impulsion. Starring Alejandro Rey, Larry Linville, Rudy Herrera Jr.
 Sister In Law (1974) Starring John Savage. That is also John Savage singing the song.
  The worst of this set is Cindy & Donna (1970) and Malibu High (1979). I would call them really cheap ""exploitation"" movies to the point of borderline pornographic.

 Some movies include male nudity, female frontal nudity and sexual situations.
  Most of the movies are from Crown International Pictures. Low-budget, bad dialogue, one-camera, cheap film.

 Well, if you wanted to be an actor or a filmmaker, you had to start somewhere. It paid the rent.

  All movies are rated ""R"", with the exception of Cindy & Donna, which is not rated.

  Two movies appear on each side of a disc in this 2-disc, 8 movie set.

3284397,5,B0010T3ULQ,"As others have stated, there is nothing ""classic"" or ""cult"" about these movies since it's unlikely that anyone remembers even seeing them. But for the price, this 8 movie set really delivers the goods with movies typical of drive-ins and second run movie theaters.

Pickup - Two girls get picked up by a guy driving a mobile home type bus. After that things get really weird and your guess is as good as mine as to what the plot is. Both girls take their clothes off during the film so it's not a total loss. Very trippy.
The Sister in Law - Tries really hard to be serious. It goes from a drama about a guy and his affair with his brother's wife to a crime drama about drug running. Again, only the nudity keeps this from being a total bore.

The Teacher - A step up from the previous two if only for the appearance of the drop dead gorgeous Angel Tompkins who plays the titular Teacher. The story is about the unlikely seduction of a student by his Teacher, though no scenes are ever in the school itself. The student, who is a total idiot, spurns the advances of this smoking hot woman several times because he has to ""work in his van""! Sheesh!

Trip With the Teacher - The most violent one of the bunch. A group of female students and their teacher who are on a field trip get terrorized by a couple of deranged bikers. The poster of this film is the one used for the cover of the DVD box.

Best Friends - A road trip movie about two friends back from the war with different ideas as to what their lives should be. Things get messy when one of the friends lusts after the other's girl. Richard Hatch (Battlestar Galactica) stars in this one. Pretty Good.

The Stepmother - The title is misleading since the plot really doesn't revolve around the Stepmother in question but rather around a man who is trying to cover up two murders he committed, one out of a jelous rage and another accidental. A decent crime drama with some nudity to spice things up.

Malibu High - The gem of this set. This one is worth the price of admission alone. An attractive high school student goes from bad to worse as she first begins seducing her teacher for better grades, then turns to prostitution to have easy money and then ends up an assassin for the mob! Great stuff.

Cindy and Donna - All the movies feature nudity but this one excels in that department. Lots of skin around a bare bones plot of two sisters experimenting with sex and drugs. A highlight is a dance routine in a bar by a topless babe who has the best body in the entire 8 movie set.",1271030400,13,2540,4.301255230125523

3284400,3,B0010T3ULQ,"When a collection of eight movies costs less than five dollars especially when the packaging refers to them as ""Cult Classics"" it is definitely buyer (and viewer) beware. In this case caution is definitely advisable as depending on your appreciation of 1970's exploitation movies you may find these insufferable or morbidly entertaining. In rating them I am trying to be unbiased, but I have to admit that most of this set did very little for me. I am reluctantly settling on a three star rating as the best compromise available. Most of the films deserve one star reviews, but bearing in mind that most people purchasing this package will fully realize the sleaze they are buying and must therefore appreciate it, I decided that as a value proposition the package gives a lot of 70's B-movie running time for the price. If you are looking for actual good movies, you are definitely in the wrong place: this is nothing but a collection of insipid and implausible cheese.

""The Pick-Up"" is a plodding piece of garbage about three losers cavorting in the Everglades after their giant bus gets stuck in the mud. If it were only that simple, it would probably have been a middling picture, but no, they had to go and mix in lots of astral visions, psychobabble, and witchery to pad out the plot. While the movie does manage to prove that baby raccoons are very cute (don't even ask), most of the film is padding. There are lots of slow scenes of birds flying, walking through mud, all told at a snail's pace with terrible synthesizer background music at every turn. The three people on the bus are a young and irresponsible couple and a creepy witch-girl who likes to take us psychically back to subplots about disgusting priests, ancient rituals, caricatured politicians, and a very creepy clown.

The film suffers from many flaws, perhaps the worst of which is sound quality. It is frequently impossible to hear dialogue over background sounds and the musical score. Do not be too upset; this actually improves the quality of the viewing experience. The film also features the most awkward kissing lesson in screen history followed by highly improbable arboreal hijinks, and continuity issues galore, all leading up to the most unnatural performance featuring a stuffed animal in cinema history. The film is as boring as it is pointless, and is the worst film of the bunch, but it does have one redeeming quality: it's short.

""The Sister In Law"" dares you to suffer through it. Transparent and caricatured characters do and say predictable things in this tedious would-be potboiler. The entire production is laced with leaden dialogue like ""Every beast ought to lick his own wounds"", this intimate exchange between two brothers: ""What's the matter?""...""I itch.""...""You gotta' disease?"", and, of course, this turgid chestnut: ""I've had your wife and your mistress, and I threw your heroin into a mountain stream!"" In other words, this was supposed a cool, swinging flick, but like so many other movies from the 70's, is merely painful and trying.

All the characters here are absolutely repulsive, so it's difficult to sympathize with any of them, though we're supposed to be aligned with Bobby, the younger brother (John Savage). Older brother Edward is a mobbed-up irresponsible lout with a hussy for a wife. Here's a tip to the wise: don't mess with your insane cold-blooded mobster brother's wife. Or girlfriend. No good can come of it. In an unintentionally humorous subplot we learn that Edward is really just a confused writer who needs understanding and one good deal to get out of his heroin smuggling ways. You will not be convinced of this, or really anything else, for that matter for two primary reasons: first, the acting is generally awful (especially from Will MacMillan as Edward, who needs to take subtlety lessons from William Shatner); and second, the soundtrack makes watching a challenge as dialogue, music, and effects go from nearly inaudible even with the volume cranked to maximum, to ear-splittingly loud, all within seconds.

The movie has little to recommend it: insipid plot, terrible acting, bad audio, and one of the worst musical scores in film history. The theme song over the lengthy opening credits was so bad I finally had to break down and mute it, and the incidental music is even worse, especially the lengthy ""smuggling in Canada, with subsequent inappropriate aquatic disposal of heroin"" montage set to banjo music. For a film set in very exclusive parts of New York, the banjo montage was jarring at best, grating at worst. On the positive side, the clothes are hilarious, especially the denim leisure suit worn by mob boss ""Benjo"", who, it turns out, has the stupidest goons in organized crime.

Despite press materials (and the title itself) blaming the whole tawdry mess on a brazen woman, everything that goes wrong is really entirely Edward's fault; unfortunately no good deed goes unpunished, which you will discover (without any surprise) at the end of the film. I recommend that you don't watch this piece of garbage if you want to avoid punishment yourself. Ugh.

""The Stepmother"" is definitely the best movie of the eight, and is a decent potboiler about lust, betrayal, and murder from producer Hikmet Avedis (which is normally a warning sign). The film is carried by a great performance from Alejandro Rey as haunted architect Frank Delgado, who becomes embroiled in two separate murders. The film opens with terrible music and the murder of Delgado's wife's lover at the hands of an enraged Rey. While he seems to have put a lid on that successfully, Rey and Larry Linville (a prototype pre-MASH Frank Burns), his business partner, have both romantic and monetary issues to overcome, and Rey is a hothead with little self-control. I won't reveal what happens with Linville, but I will say that although contrived, it's interesting. The crimes are being investigated by a wannabe Columbo (Peter Falk has nothing to worry about) who, while none too bright, is extremely grating. Along with that distraction there are other negatives to the film, not the least of which is watching a bunch of fully dressed fifty-somethings frolic on a beach: I never need to see that. There are unexpected B-movie joys here, though, my favorite of which is without question the jazz-funk flute dance.

Although the film starts and ends with implausible coincidences and features completely moronic police work, the acting really does make the film highly watchable. The technical aspects of the film are middling at best and are very dated, especially the endlessly repeated freeze frame effect used for plot transitions. The subplot about the hot young stepmother, Margo, getting high and making a pass at her stepson is both repulsive and laughable. (This pass is extraordinarily clumsy, somewhat akin to the pass Torgo makes at Margaret in ""Manos: The Hands of Fate"".) Despite the obvious flaws, though, the film is very watchable and manages to overcome its history as an example of exploitation cinema, largely through the performance of Alejandro Rey.

""The Teacher"" is a piece of 1970's trash featuring a bizarre coming of age plot superimposed with an insane lunatic stalker plot. I give auteur Hikmet Avedis credit for trying to blend disparate plots, but the entire thing comes across as one contrivance after another. The plot concerns creepy stalking Vietnam veteran (of course) Ralph, who drives a hearse and lives in a grain silo overlooking the marina where public school teacher Diane keeps her yacht moored. He keeps his belonging in a casket, which I would have thought the police would have noticed during their investigation after his brother Lou falls to death from the top. Peeping Ralph blames Lou's friend Sean (Jay ""Dennis the Menace"" North!) for the death, which sets the full psychotic stalker plot in gear. Despite numerous sightings and threats to Diane and Sean, nobody ever once thinks to call the police. That was one logically challenged area of the film, but the other bit of incredulity revolves around the fact that a public high school teacher drives a Corvette, has a giant pool, and her own yacht. How much do teachers make in California, anyhow?

In the least credible part of the plot, teacher Diane and student Sean are on a first name basis with each other, and quickly move to other pastimes together, all while Ralph watches (and gets ever more jealous) and, most insanely, with the explicit encouragement of Sean's mother. The mother was definitely the creepiest element of the film for me. Along the way there are many ridiculous and embarrassing scenes: Diane washes her car in a full length dress, a gossipy restaurant scene provides the most inept flirtation ever, and last but not least, Diane's bedroom provides the backdrop for the most ludicrous use of an umbrella in filmmaking history (and yes, I have seen ""The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies."") The film has intentions to be creepy, and the ending is a bit out of the norm, although equally implausible and predictable.

""Trip With The Teacher"" is a typical schoolgirls-in-peril-from-bikers film. A couple of mean bikers and one nice biker meet up with the girls on their geology field trip (yeah, right) first at a gas station, and later when their bus breaks down in the middle of nowhere. The most evil biker, Al, who looks like Bono in Liz Taylor sunglasses, is a murderous thug with unwholesome intentions. As soon as the bus breaks down a catfight immediately erupts, halted only by the arrival of the dangerous bikers. The bikers tow the bus full of willing victims to a deserted cabin, where they quickly dispatch the bus driver, and quickly raise a question: did anyone even consider killing the bikers when their clothes were off and they didn't have access to their weapons? The good biker decides to become a hero and get help (who bothers to carefully don and adjust their helmet when running for their life in a bike chase?) While the boys are out dueling in the desert there are long, painful passages of staring at each other, which does nothing to further the plot, but pads the running time immensely. Then one of the most annoying actresses in screen history is dispatched to run and get help, but whines and snivels about how she is scared for what seems like hours: I was actually pulling for the biker in this instance. The ending requires quite a suspension of disbelief and concludes with smiles all around, except on the audience's face.

""Best Friends"" features future ""Battleship Galactica"" heartthrob Richard Hatch in another bit of motorhome mayhem, this one even more farfetched than ""The Pick-Up"": it may be the single stupidest road movie ever. Every single character in this film is insufferable, and nobody behaves similarly to reality. In essence the story is that two Army buddies get out of the service and take their girlfriends home with them in a giant camper. What's impossible to grasp is why the four would stay together for the entire trip such are the factions involved. The crux of the matter is that one guy wants to get married (Jessie; Richard Hatch) and the other guy (Pat; Doug Chapin) spends the entire film trying to break up Jessie's relationship so the two guys can have a life on the road. Especially after Pat resorts to manipulation and physical violence, there is no rationale for staying together, and that's why the whole movie seems utterly contrived. There's a big Pat-wants-Jessie's-girl-and-vice-versa subtext here (that is utterly implausible), and the conclusion to be reached is that these characters are only capable of doing whatever is stupidest in any given situation. When Jessie and Pat have a feud over Kathy, why don't they leave in the camper, after all Pat bought a motorcycle for some reason. When threatened, leave.

There is some of the stupidest gunplay in history in this film (Let's get drunk and shoot lizards with a pistol!), culminating in a painful scene proving that Jessie is a poor shot with tragic results (no extra points for guessing) leading unsurprisingly to a pointless, unresolved ending. This film is an absolute chore to watch and should have ended the careers of everyone involved; Richard Hatch should consider himself very lucky.

""Cindy and Donna"" is the only movie of the eight besides ""The Stepmother"" featuring girls who are actually pretty. The plot is a tawdry coming-of-age piece featuring the worst parents of the 70's (which is certainly saying something) and their two saucy and irresponsible children. There are occasionally amusing diversions like when the prostitute uses a Dremel tool on Dad's chest hair, and inner struggles about how far is too far to go on a date (I call this section of the film ""Torrid Chastity"".) The soundtrack is very grating, and the banjo-intensive driving music is almost too much to endure (as is a curious trend in this DVD set). The cast and characters are unrelentingly awful, and they whole thing is a voyeuristic and uneasy exploration of pubescent possibilities. Despite the pretty girls, I really loathed this movie. The ending is particularly ludicrous, but at least it's over.

""Malibu High"" features Kim, a lazy, homely, stoner, drunk high school senior working her way through her teachers to get A's to enable her to graduate. The skank is trying to forget her high school sweetheart, Kevin, who is now dating a rich brat. I will particularly warn you about the high school disco scene, which requires a very high pain threshold to get through, and which does not go the way Kim intends. After the disco she gets the idea to use her wily feminine charms to seduce her male teachers to enable her to graduate. I will tell you that if you are expecting this to be erotic in the slightest, you will be gravely disappointed. Through her serial seductions, she turns pro, and then becomes an assassin for hire as well. This is perhaps one of the least plausible life-of-crime conversions in film history, and you will be especially entertained by the way she bumps her principal off. Eventually she is assigned on orders ""from Chicago"" to kill the father of Kevin's new girlfriend (how's that for justice?), and is assured by her handler ""There's absolutely nothing that can go wrong!"" Needless to say, he's horribly incorrect, and the hit turns into a disaster, although there is some fortunate elimination of annoying characters. The film concludes with a run down a beach and is very reminiscent of the conclusion in ""The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living And Became Mixed-Up Zombies"", although without the deft directorial or acting skills of the Ray Dennis Steckler classic.",1258070400,22,14733,4.947070707070707

3284402,4,B0010T3ULQ,"I don't see many movies and these films are from an era in my life when I was trying to be far more serious. Now that I have retired and look back mainly as a way of engaging in 40 years of recapitulation of the Vietnam war, three of these movies tell me a lot about the nature of American life. ""Malibu High"" (1979) tells me how bad choices can make people advance in the wrong direction, like the American economy has been rolling in money like a bobsled rocketing down clear through to China. Each step in the plot takes a girl further along in seeing what trouble is all about. ""The Sister In Law"" stars John Savage, who was in the Deer Hunter, but I think the interesting character is a younger brother who thinks he has supernatural powers so everything that he does will turn out right, even if he does not know what is going to happen next. ""Cindy and Donna"" mainly has girls being seduced by guys with abject reactions by people who stumble in when the worm has turned. ""The Teacher"" was a movie I thought was creepy. After watching a few other movies, I was not ready to see more than one minute of ""The Stepmother.""

The story lines are non-existent and the sex scenes leave a lot to be desired...like sex.

3284409,4,B0010T3ULQ,"If you listened to many film critics, they'd say that the 1970s was the last great era of movie making, a time before studios became obsessed with the blockbuster and special effects over substance.  It was the era of The Godfather, Network, Taxi Driver and a lot of other great movies.  As Drive-In Cult Classics demonstrates, however, there was plenty of garbage in that era too.

This set of eight movies from Crown International Pictures features some movies that are cheesy fun but by no stretch are any of these films good or even average.  Using the Amazon rating scale, these range from one to two stars, though some have a so-bad-they're-good quality.  Not all of them, though.

Each of the two discs contains four movies, two to a side.  On Disc One, Side One is The Pick-Up and The Teacher.  The Pick-Up is a complete mess, exacerbated by the fact that the no-talent director tries to be artistic.  The story - what little there is of it - involves two young women who hitch a ride with a guy with a motorhome.  They get stuck in the Everglades and while awaiting rescue, sleep with each other and have various hallucinations and flashbacks.  It's borderline porn, which might be fine if it wasn't so poorly made (though admittedly, some of the nature scenery is nice).  The Teacher's tag line states that ""she corrupted the youthful morality of an entire school"".  In reality, the title character only gets involved with one former student, played by former Dennis the Menace Jay North.  As with all these movies, there's plenty of gratuitous nudity, but this one also has the semblance of a coherent story.

The flip side has Best Friends and Trip with the Teacher.  Best Friends also has a big name star (well not big, but at least someone you've heard of):  Richard Hatch, Apollo on the original Battlestar Galactica.  It's another road trip story in which Hatch, his best friend and their two girlfriends take a motor home across the country.  The close quarters and the best friend's psychological problems create issues.  Trip with the Teacher has a teacher escorting some high school students (all beautiful girls, naturally) on a weekend trip.  Along the way, they run afoul of a couple bikers.  It's one of those movies in which all the characters act stupidly and seem unable to conceive ways to get out of trouble (despite outnumbering the two bikers three-to-one).

Disc Two, Side One has The Sister In Law and The Stepmother.  The Sister In Law seems to be the only movie not made on a shoestring budget, but it is still only two shoestrings.  John Savage from The Deer Hunter play the prodigal son who has come back into the fold, just in time to be seduced by his brother's wife.  The brother is involved with drug dealers, and soon enough, so is Savage, but at least not all is lost:  he gets to sleep with his brother's mistress too.  The Stepmother has Larry Linville (Frank Burns on M*A*S*H) but only in a supporting role.  Alejandro Rey plays the lead character, a husband whose fits of jealousy lead him to murder.

Things get really trashy on the final side.  Malibu High is the story of a high school senior who, dumped by her boyfriend and failing all her classes, decides to start sleeping with her teachers to boost her grades.  She also becomes a prostitute for the cash, and later a hit woman.  Cindy and Donna is bottom-of-the-barrel, about two sisters.  The bad one sleeps with any guy (including her step-father!) and the good one wants to be bad.  With plots that go nowhere and an ending so abrupt and out of left field that you get the feeling the director must have realized he was about to run out of film, this is laughably bad.

There are some common factors in these movies.  As stated before, they all have plenty of nudity and are clearly the product of the free-love seventies.  Many of the films look like R-rated versions of Afterschool Specials, in which sex and drugs lead inevitably to tragedy.  Whenever parents are shown, they are completely ineffective, either out-of-touch or completely disinterested in their kids.  Women seem to merely exist to have sex with (though once they have a kid, they become useless); the only lead women to have legitimate jobs are the two teachers.

With no extras (not even a scene selection menu), the desirability of this set is purely based on the quality of the movies.  So how does a set like this merit four stars?  Because, despite their awfulness (or maybe because of their awfulness), some of these moves are actually fun to watch.  Others (particularly The Pick-Up and Cindy and Donna) are exercises in tedium.  And this set delivers exactly what it promises:  trash.",1247097600,11,4671,4.697044334975369
3284410,3,B0010T3ULQ,"These films for the most part are neither cult movies nor are they classic.  However, the drive-in moniker is dead on, and if you enjoy 70's b-films that are slow-medium paced, with a lot of swimming pools, sunsets, joint smoking, feathered hair, tight white pants, vans, motor homes, motorcycles, bummer endings, gratuitous T & A (in most of them), and occasionally hilarious moments of really bad dialogue and acting, then this is a good set, especially for the price.  My only gripes are 1) the sound is often a bit muffled, gets better if you have it through a stereo and can thin it out with more treble/less bass; 2) no subtitles.  these films are perfect to set it and forget it, kill the sound and put on a record, but it'd be nice to still be able to follow the story with subtitles.  3) the provided summaries are sometimes misleading.  But these are minor complaints considering the overall pleasure-to-dollar ratio available here.  Drive-in movies were a genre all their own, and shrugged off the burden of plot like it was just some unnecessary hassle.

MALIBU HIGH
Worth the price of admission alone.  This is the one that really shines out of this bunch.  Much stronger language than all of the others, classic dialogue (""Maybe if you weren't so concerned about dirt, and dust, and greasy buildup, then Daddy wouldn't have left, and wouldn't have had to kill himself because he couldn't get it up anymore!""), plenty of salaciousness, and great low budget jaw-dropppers like a high school dance that takes place in a Mexican restaurant, not to mention wicked 70s wall-rugs and phrases like ""Check you later!""  Malibu High RULES.  If only they could all be this good.

CINDY & DONNA
The second best film in this set, and a classic theme song.  Donna is the slutty older sister that ultimately lures the uptight Cindy into a trampy lifestyle.  Tame by today's standards but otherwise not for the prudish.  One of many with an astonishingly abrupt ending.

THE TEACHER
Pretty entertaining by virtue of its lameness.  The by-line on the package is totally misleading, however - she does not 'corrupt the morality of an entire school,' not by a long shot.  This one features a lovely, Cheryl Ladd-ish teacher figure - it's summer vacation so other than one shot outside the school during the opening credits, there is no school-related activity whatsoever.  This has very TV-style acting, shooting, everything, then the obligatory T & A every 20 mins or so.  It's like watching The Brady Bunch with partial nudity plus some light crime.  The goofy villain, Ralph, is a hilarious scene-stealing goon.  What's unfathomable is why the Teacher would be interested in a dork like Sean who greatly prefers working on his van to having sex.  Seriously, count the number of times he references working on his van, it's insane.  This one also has a classic theme song that  plays through 75% of the movie.

BEST FRIENDS
Weird flick.  Goofus and Gallant take a motor home on a multi-state trip as one last fling to celebrate Goofus getting out of the Army and Gallant getting married.  But Goofus just can't face the end of the footloose good times with his buddy, so he sets about to destroy the impending marriage.  Ann Noland really shines in this movie as Jo Ella - she's got a great spontaneity and charm.  But questions linger: where the hell did Goofus put his motorcycle when he was riding in the motor home?  And why didn't Gallant just waste him?  Pretty classic drunken strip scene in an Indian bar.

THE SISTER IN LAW
This is actually a fairly serious movie about two bearded brothers from a well-to-do family.  The elder brother, Edward, was a briefly successful writer who has since fallen into wearing white turtlenecks and performing deliveries for organized crime types who have a flair for dramatically handing envelopes to one another.  His marriage to a gorgeous though small-nippled woman is dissolving when the younger brother, Robert, our protagonist, returns to the swank family house from his idealistic exploration of America.  Swimming in the pool, wearing tennis clothes, and banging Edward's older soon-to-be ex-wife suddenly loses interest when Edward shows up with his mistress, another lovely woman just about Robert's age.  Eventually Edward has a movie opportunity in L.A. right about the time he's scheduled to do a particularly risky package pickup in Canada, and he gets Robert to do it for him by letting him bring the mistress along.  Plays out like a pretty good auteur type of film of the period if you're down with the laid-back 70s pacing.

THE STEPMOTHER
This one looks & feels like an extended episode of Barnaby Jones or Police Woman.  The only thing remotely 'cult classic'-ish about it is 1) there's a scene where the elite group of friends are dancing during the daytime at the beach house to flute music...and one of the dudes is revealed to actually be playing a flute, and 2) a scene where the cops bring in 'Sanchez'  or 'Lopez' or whoever and the guy lays out a very 70s racist caricature of the hot-blooded Latino.  Otherwise you'll swear you're watching TV at 12:30 at night in 1972.

TRIP WITH THE TEACHER
No relation to The Teacher.  This one is pretty dark.  Two creepy bikers trap 4 or 5 teenage girls and their teacher in an abandoned shack and proceed to torment and rape them while they cry.  If you like relentlessly hopeless situations like in Cape Fear, then have at it, but this is not for me.

PICK UP
Why this one is presented first I can't imagine - it is easily the most boring one in the bunch. Two lovely young women catch a ride with a 70s dude who is driving a motor home through Florida.  Ultimately it becomes soft porn in a swamp, with some psychedelic scenes of ambiguous mysticism, interspersed with hostile phone calls from the fat sweaty man expecting the motor home to be delivered to its destination in a timely fashion.  Oh, and some flashbacks about being molested in a church.  Don't expect a happy ending, or a payoff for all the shots of sunsets, roadside landscapes, blah blah blah.",1246320000,149,6071,4.75717017208413
3284411,5,B0010T3ULQ,"Bought this weeks ago at the current $5 asking price on amazon.  Just barely bothered to finish the last of the eight so i decided to write my own impressions.  Its been awhile since i've seen all so i might make a mistake or two.  I'm not sure how to review this(do i factor in the $5 price, the exploitation angle, the cheese-to-entertainment ratio? I don't know), so i'm just gonna slap a 5-star rating and give my impressions of each and let you decide.

* The Sister-In-Law:  Arguably the only thing in this set that could be mistaken for a film.  It starts off like a sexploitation, and i would've been happy at that.  But it veers off into a mafia crime-drama of sorts.  I would've been annoyed at that, but i was already caught up in the story and characters to care at that point.  And the ending.  Not sure how others felt, but i was very satisfied with how it ended.  Definitely worth a watch.

* Malibu High:  Arguably the most entertaining, and goofiest movie out of all of them.  Exploitive, cheesy, and mostly enjoyable; it's also very off-kilter.  The lead actress at times looked and acted as if she was from a 60's movie, while most of the others were from a 70's movie.  The styles/settings looked as if they ranged from the late 60's, to the 70's, and even early 80's, to me anyway.  I guess that's why it was so oddly compelling to watch.  Well, that and the crazy hooker-turns-hit-woman plot.  Worth a watch.

* Cindy and Donna:  Here it is.  This is what you were looking for when you bought this set.  It's cheap and cheesy, but if you wanted sexploitation(softcore), you found it.  Whether it's the subject matter(incest/promiscuity/etc), the softcore scenes(i lost count), or the actresses(creepily young), it's all here.  Worth a watch, and shower afterwards.

Those 3 are worth the $5 admission price in my opinion.  Next...

* The Stepmother:  Winner of what could've been.  The lead actress is extremely cute.  Problem is the movie plays out more like a detective drama than a sexploitation.  Btw, there is this pool table seduction scene that is kinda hot, but it abruptly ends!  Either it was poorly edited, or this is a cut version.  Like i said, with such a hot lead actress, what could've been.  Still worth a watch.

* Trip with the Teacher:  I'm not into rape scenes, and there are a few non-explicit ones in this, so i felt uncomfortable watching it.  But for those who like that sorta thing, it's there.  Not graphically, but it's there.  The ensemble works well together.  Exploitive all-around, so worth a watch, i guess.

Those two are worth a watch for the most part.  So there's your 5 hard-earned bucks right there.  Next...

* Best Friends: This is ok if you want to see Apollo from Battlestar Galactica make out a couple of times.  Not very exploitive and drags a bit, but still worth a watch maybe as the performers try their best with the material given.

* The Teacher: Disappointingly NOT exploitive.  Except for a few minor scenes, it looks like it could've been a tv movie-of-the-week.  The lead actress looks great, but the movie itself was slow and uneventful to me.  Barely worth a watch.

* Pick-Up:  My least favorite.  I suppose if you were part of the 70's, high, and into 'artsy' pretentious films you would enjoy this.  Problem is, i don't remember the 70's much, was not high or drunk while viewing this, and the ending just made me feel cheated.  But you paid for this 8-pack, so go for it.

The last 3 i didn't find very exploitive, entertaining, or interesting but that's just me.  Apparently there are some fans of The Teacher and The Pick Up so who knows, i might be too hard on them.  All 8 films are obviously of varying pic/sound quality with The Teacher maybe looking the best and Best Friends looking the worst.  The set i bought came on one dvd case, so it's very convenient and a space saver.  And since these aren't AFI film classics, you won't mind the 2-sided discs.  Overall, I'd recommend this set, for $5 or less.",1244592000,10,3994,4.548660084626234

I was wrong with that assumption, these movies show boobs but there is hardly any killing and when someone does die you don't know what the heck happened. Watching these movies is a waste of time, they aren't scary or interesting at all unless you just want to see girls take their tops off which I know some people do.

3284415,4,B0010T3ULQ,"Let me begin this review by mentioning the earliest film of the eight included here, ""Cindy & Donna.""
Let me steer your attention to this forgotten gem from 1970, especially if your partial to redheads...wow.

Okay, onto the review:

Pickup:
The latest film of the batch, 1980's ""The Pickup"", almost seems as if it's from an ealier time, with it's voluptuous, mystical hippe chicks & mobile homes.
There is a very disconcerting scene involving a clown in a meadow, that seemed to drift in from another flick.
There's also a lot of nudity split between the two female leads.

The Sister in Law:
Despite the title, this film is excellent & well directed & acted.
The story absorbs you, and the ending is somewhat heartbreaking.

The Stepmother:
The male lead's accent is a bit distracting, but the story is quite interesting.
Murder, cover-ups, unfaithful partners...
And, of course, the tragic finale.

The Teacher:
Creepy stalkers driving about town in Hearses, Voyeuristic teenaged boys, dimwitted parents, clueless, seduced adolescents...
All of this, plus a kid falling off a twenty story building!

Trip with Teacher:
Zalman King, as the demented biker bad-boy, is the star of this show.
He & his somewhat reluctant brother, follow & capture a school bus of precocious female students.

Best Friends:
What do you do if you discover your best buddy is a sociopath, hell-bent on ruining your life?
Try & shoot him, of course (in your underwear...on the beach).

Cindy & Donna:
Cindy, Cindy, Cindy!
This isn't the Brady Bunch, as the teenaged daughters mirror the destructive ways of their parents.
This one features a ""no rating"" and within the first ten minutes, it's easy to understand why.
I dare you not to hum along to the ""Cindy"" theme song, played throughout this film!

Malibu High:
Almost as good as ""Cindy & Donna.""
Probablly better.
Ahhhhh, Cindy....",1239148800,10,1863,4.964630225080386
3284416,5,B0010T3ULQ,"Simply outstanding. ""Malibu High"" is easily one of the best b-movies on the planet. The entire purchase price worth it for this movie alone.

3284417,2,B0010T3ULQ,Interesting movies but not great.  Acting is average to below average.  Story line is fair.  Video is okay.

My favorites are TRIP WITH THE TEACHER, THE TEACHER, MALIBU HIGH (starts out dull, but ends up outrageously fun!), and CINDY AND DONNA.

In all honesty, some of these films were so bad that I watched mostly in fast forward mode (particularly the Pick Up, which seemed to require the use of some mind-altering substance to understand).  I suffered through the entirety of half of them, though, and none of those were particularly interesting in either a good or bad way.  There is some bad dialog and acting that's laugh inducing here and there (particularly in Cindy & Donna and Malibu High), but for the most part these movies seem to exist for only one purpose:  to provide soft-core fodder for straight men.  Thus you get to see topless young women (most of whom aren't particularly attractive) in every film and lots of rolling-around kissing scenes.  If that sort of thing is your bag, then you might like these movies.  I just found them tedious.",1230854400,15,960,4.6726190476190474

3284425,5,B0010T3ULQ,"The Top 10 things about the 70s I learned from Drive-In Cult Classics #1

10. Getting lost in an RV was popular.
 9. Most young girls ran around nekkid.
 8. All relationships ended in tragic violence.
 7. Being chased on foot for a long time was common.
 6. Hitmen were everywhere and would kill you for very little money.
 5. Being chased in a vehicle for a long time was common.
 4. Only bad guys had tattoos and usually they had just one.
 3. Female teachers dated their male students as much as they do today.
 2. If a dude was riding a motorcycle that dude was trouble.
 1. Folks got stabbed and shot a lot.

MY SUPER SHORT REVIEW OF EACH OF THE 8-MOVIES:

Pick Up - Maybe they made this one for just for pot smokers. I don't know.

The Sister In Law - Very good movie. Great storyline and acting.

The Stepmother - The least of the 8-films by a landslide. Larry Linville is M.A.S.H. to me and nothing else.

The Teacher - Even though this is a common true life story that seems to make headlines at least twice a year it's a great one to watch.

Trip With The Teacher - Watch this one first. It's excellent.

Best Friends - This is like a book you can't put down and Richard Hatch never did anything near this good on Battlestar Galactica.

Cindy & Donna - This one is rated ""Not Rated"". Watch this movie with your entire family and have them all vote on what they would rate it. You should have all votes in very early in the movie and they will all be the same vote. If your name is Cindy, you will love the Cindy song that plays in the background several times. Well, maybe Cindy won't like it but if you know someone named Cindy it's funny.

Malibu High - Either watch this one first or second. It has SCTV's going to break sound effect in it several times. This is one crazy movie. Malibu High probably was in danger of losing its accreditation after all that went on there.

EXTRA BONUS REVIEW:

All 8-movies contain very pretty girls of the 70s. The DVD is titled ""Drive-In Cult Classics"" but when you put the DVD and click on a movie the doors of a walk in and sit down theater swing open. This is a great movie collection for the money. All of the movies are very watchable and very entertaining if you lived during the 70s and experienced drive-in movies. Remember, this is a collection of ""cult"" movies. That means they are not for everyone. Horror fans would love this collection.",1229212800,30,2398,4.2727272727272725
3284426,4,B0010T3ULQ,"These movies are camp, sleaze, sexploitation, low bidget, and great! My favourite being ""Cindy and Donna"" though ""The Step-Daughter"" is quite good too.

What makes these movies appealing could depends on the person.  I'm sure that some people have memories of these films, or films like these... or at least could hear these films in the background while they were attending to alternative drive-in entertainments.  But these films have a wider appeal than just that.  There's also the tanilizing eroticism of some films.  All the films were made between 1970 and the early 1980's (I think 1983 is the year that the most recent film was made) and younger audiences be interested in seeing film from that period (and the clothes, furniture, automobiles, etc.)

These movies are not for children.  And they should not be taken too seriously either.  Be warned; if you're looking for some ""amazing"" movie, then you're looking at the wrong collection.",1227225600,2,947,5.064516129032258

3284428,1,B0010T3ULQ,"I loved being able to nostalgisize (my own word) by watching these, but the video quality seems no better than a vhs tape (or maybe worse.)  Detail is poor, shadows are empty of content, etc.  Upconverting dvd players don't really help much with this dvd.",1226707200,12,255,4.644444444444445
3284429,5,B0010T3ULQ,"Ahhh, the 70s, drive-ins, no cell phones, no texting, bad hair, groovy duds... this is the perfect purchase for lovers of all things 70s cheese. First of all, I love Zalman King and he is so freaky-deaky in Trip with the Teacher...finally this violent, warped, nutty gem is out on DVD. His performance is really creepy and intense. Zalman was actually a really interesting actor, wish he would have done more than act in three movies I am aware of. For those who don't know, he went on to direct, most notably, Wild Orchid.

Malibu High was the surprise treat; talk about a crazy, fun, bad girl flick. The acting is horendous, the plot out of this world funny, and if you love these sorts of cult (especially 70s), B and C movies with non-sensical editing, bongo tracked chase scenes, sleazy soft core, roll around simulated sex scenes, teenagers in peril or ""growing up too fast"" you cannot go wrong with this collection. Malibu High and Trip with the Teacher are worth the cheap price alone.

I have a couple more to watch and found the Pick-up to be too boring to watch in entirity (spacy drug stuff, not much dialog a half hour into it/would rather watch Psych-Out). Maybe I'll have more patience some other day. Cindy & Donna was kind of funny & warped (great scenes with the MOM..her drunken dialog and delivery are brilliantly bad), but the movie is annoyingly disjointed and could have been better. There were lots of scenes of teenage Cindy sitting in her room alone touching herself, putting clothes on, taking them off, her existence & expression at times was so boring I wanted to shoot myself. And, fair warning: her ""half"" (this is significant because the Dad in this flick is ""Dad"" to Cindy, Step Daddy to Donna) loose sister has her share of borderline gag inducing sex scenes and her breasts are no joy to behold...also the Dad is GROSS and likes 'em young (and in his house sometimes, if ya catch my drift). Yeppers...1971 and a family unit to behold. If this is the sort of family unit that so many refer to as being ""lost"" and in danger of decline, I think we should all be grateful.

The Step Sister was sort of interesting (starring a young John Savage) and I don't have much to elaborate upon...still worth a check. The Teacher was truly funny (non-intentionally, of course) and stars a ""grown-up"" Dennis the Menace coming of age (in those simulated roll around sex-scenes) with his saucy, blond teacher.

I am off to check out the Stepmother and Best Friends...

3284443,3,B0010T3ULQ,I got this because it brings back memories of going to the drive in with my boyfriend or a bunch of my girlfriends back in our running around days. Now that I am older and wiser I just wanted to revisit those times with these movies.,1214265600,5,233,4.086956521739131
3284444,1,B0010T3ULQ,"I used to go to the drive-in weekly, and these are far from what I'd call classics! The folks who recommended this have way too much time on their hands, in my opinion, if they think these are worth repeated viewings. ""Cheap"" doesn't mean worth it.",1213833600,9,248,4.413043478260869
3284445,3,B0010T3ULQ,"While several stories are coherient most are just total cheese.
  The transfers are very good I thought.
  All in all, unless the price is very right, you may want to pass on this.",1213833600,3,180,4.363636363636363
3284446,4,B0010T3ULQ,this is a great value for your money you usually have to pay the same price for one and with this you get several also these are hard to find titles in one place,1213488000,,161,3.764705882352941
3284447,2,B0010T3ULQ,"I had no idea about what 70's low budget 'drive in cult classics' were like. According to few other reviewers, this set is a good example of the genre. OK then, now I know. Since it is so low priced, perhaps good buy to see what those movies were like, for the record.",1211587200,2,268,4.0754716981132075
3284448,5,B0010T3ULQ,"With the price being so low and having seen awful transfers of some of these titles before, I ordered this set with a degree of trepidation. I was pleasantly surprised to find that not only have most of these films been remastered into better versions, but the aspect ratio is actually 16x9 on widescreen monitors. If you watch these on a 4x3 television, the image will be squeezed. All 8 titles are in widescreen and anamorphically enhanced.

The films are a mixed bag; I was never a fan of ""Malibu High"", even when I saw it at a drive-in when it was released, but ""The Teacher"" is a great film with a classic ending. Much has been written about ""Trip With The Teacher"" on other sites due to Zalman King's appearance, but little has been said about Howard (Hikmet) Avedis' excellent ""The Stepmother."" Avedis was one of the best and most consistent directors for Crown in the 70's, and it's good to have both ""The Teacher"" and The Stepmother"" here for people to rediscover.

""The Sister-In-Law"" features a good performance by John Savage that hints at his breakthrough with ""The Deer Hunter"" a few years later, and ""The Pick-Up"" embodies most of what classic sexploitation had (sex, violence, nudity, moral ambiguity).

Two of the gems in this collection have not been available previously in a decent video format: ""Cindy and Donna"" is in surprisingly good condition considering the age of the material (1970) and the fact that it got quite a limited release. And for all you Susanne Benton fans out there, it's good to finally have ""Best Friends"" to watch. It's a bit more serious than some of the other offerings, but still delivers the goods. Now if we could only have ""That Cold Day In The Park""...

The Crown International films were drive-in staples, and I'm glad to see this collection doing them justice. My favorite Crown picture of them all is ""The Pom Pom Girls"" which is on the SCHOOL DAZED COLLECTION. There are no chapter listings for the films, but they do have (random) chapter stops. There are no trailers or any extras for the films either. But c'mon, ""The Teacher"" in 16x9 anamorphic for $4.99 with 7 other titles? You just gotta get it!",1211155200,42,2157,4.683377308707124
3284449,3,B0010T3ULQ,"For the money this was a good buy. Poor acting, lame plots...'70's drive-in all the way. The movies were fun for the most part, most were entertaining....the way it used to be...lol

3284450,5,B0010T3ULQ,"i could have added low rent. every one of these very entertaining  movies features pretty young girls in various states of undress. all the said young girls have gotten themselves into some kind of serious trouble and every movie has a tragic ending. all are under 90 minutes long. i found the movies, all from the 1970s more entertaining than many so called classics of the same era. the set's price make it a tremendous bargain.  highly recommended for fans of sleazy, low rent R rated entertainment.",1207008000,113,502,4.758620689655173

3284452,5,B0010T3ULQ,"I have long been a fan of ""The Teacher"" - (1974) but had never seen ""The Stepmother"" - (1971). I previously owned ""The Teacher"" on VHS and also have the first DVD release from Westlake, which is apparently a bootleg!! I read somewhere else that these new DVD versions are all officially approved by and were taken directly from the vaults of Crown International Pictures, who first released them back in the 1970's. If you haven't ever seen ""The Teacher"", it alone is more than worth the price of the set, which is already a great bargain. ""The Stepmother"" is also very interesting and worthwhile for fans of actress Katherine Justice, who appeared in the very first Columbo show in 1967 and was then a familiar face on such shows as Gunsmoke and Cannon. You certainly never saw her topless and bare-bottomed on any of those shows anyway!! If you love the old 1970's drive-in films this DVD set is a must have!! My only complaint is that the 8-films are on four double-sided DVD's which can be tricky to handle without leaving fingerprints. Otherwise it is a fantastic collection, value and bargain.",1205798400,26,1099,4.699481865284974
3284453,5,B0010T3ULQ,"This is the best DVD value on Amazon.  Eight movies for $10 and not a bad one in the bunch.  These B movies have some well known actors, good stories and decent quality.  Plenty of topless nudity too.  A must buy.  You won't be sorry.",1203984000,106,234,4.111111111111111
3284454,4,B0010T3ULQ,"Talk about value for your entertainment dollar?  There are 8 films in this collection, which is selling for just under ten bucks!  And the movies are great, if you are into 1970s camp.  There are conflicts that come about in people's lives in every film, the conflicts usually the result of a sexual/romantic situation.  Somebody central to the film dies in every one of them.  Bellbottoms and other 70s paraphernalia (disco music, tight jeans, feathered hair, etc.) are widely represented.  The music is cool in that ""Convoy"" kind of way.  Really, for exploitation fare the stories are pretty compelling, but still just offbeat enough to give you the campy giggles.  I would pay $10 for any one of these movies - getting 8 of them at that price almost makes me feel like I have stolen something.",1202774400,168,796,4.759124087591241
