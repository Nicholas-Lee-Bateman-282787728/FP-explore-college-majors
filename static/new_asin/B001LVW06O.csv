CEMETERY MAN (Italy/France/Germany-1994) is a delightfully creepy Euro-frighter that stars Rupert Everett, plus a cast of unknowns.

Although made on the Continent (the graveyard set was built on the remains of an old Italian cemetery), evey actor speaks either British English or English with an Italian accent.

This thing is crazy funny. For example, there's a talking disembodied head that rip bites from her father's neck.

This girl died while a motorcycle passenger, when the bike went under the wheels of a bus full of Boy Scouts. The bus drove off a cliff. Dozens died. All, including the decapitated girl, are buried in the town's creepy cemetery and immediately come back as zombies. Everett, the story's central character, a 24-hour a day graveyard caretaker, and his chubby assistant (the guy looks like a demented mute Curly Howard), have to again kill this small army of zombies, with dum dum bullets to the head or skull splitting spade chops.

A series of murders in town leaves the cemetery man as prime suspect. Meanwhile, he's in love with a buxom dead girl who seems to have come back to full life.

It's gory, macabre, violent, darkly amusing and gets a strong 7.1 rating at IMDb.",1378684800,,1419,4.966244725738397
