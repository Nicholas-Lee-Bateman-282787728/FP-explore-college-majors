The graphics are colorful and bright. This Easter episode teaches kids the importance of friendship versus winning a competition. Martha and her friends want to enter an egg decorating contest because the prize is an invitation to the White House Easter Egg Roll. I won't give away the plot, but it is a cute film, perfect for the entire family.
Martha's friends are always enthusiastic about DIY crafts, which encourages young kids to explore crafts just like Martha and her friends. The DVD includes three Martha webisodes and downloadable fun craft projects and recipes.",1373414400,,744,4.866141732283465
8549141,4,B00AADAKIY,"My kids are in a super competitive phase where everything is about winning from who finished their dinner first to who ran to the park the fastest. Martha's Magnificent Egg pleasantly surprised me by opening the door for a talk about the importance of winning. And here I thought it'd just be a cute Easter Egg DVD!

I've never actually seen the show before so I was curious what it would be like. Martha has her own show for her blog, which I found to be amusing and a sign of the times! When her demonstration of creating unique Easter eggs is copied by a friend, the issue of winning and losing comes up. She wanted to help her friend but now she might lose a competition because of it.

Competition and winning are commonplace among young children so this is a great lesson in why friendship and helping others is more important than a win.

While my kids are younger than the kids in the video, they still understood the lesson. The characters would be more appealing to Martha's age of ten. It's also informative as it talks about the White House Easter Egg Roll which is a true event and one I had to look up to learn more about!

I was so impressed by this DVD and it's impact on my kids. Martha's Magnificent Egg came along at the perfect time!",1360627200,,1253,4.3418803418803416

We spent the past three days home bound due to the weather. We were either playing in the snow or warming up with some hot chocolate and a movie with this one being one of them.

We love Martha and her friends Kevin, Lily and Hannah,are always up to something fun in Martha's craft room. This time they are entering an egg decorating contest. Martha combines crafting and a great friendship message to makes a DVD that kids and parents will enjoy.

We especially loved the PFD files included on the DVD! Insert the DVD into your computer and find 13 pages of Easter recipes and crafts that are extremely child friendly. Goddess asked me to print her a copy so she can figure out what supplies she needs. We will start working on our crafts next week.",1360540800,,791,4.374149659863946
