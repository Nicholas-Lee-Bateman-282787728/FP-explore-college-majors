8560051,5,B00B04NJ3U,"Jim Varney made a series of films based on his milk commercial character ""Ernest"". This series of ""Ernest"" movies is mostly slapstick humor with some Varney faces and resembles a live cartoon. This is considered one of the best of the series.

In this movie Jim Varney plays a double role as a hardened convict and an aspiring bank janitor. Due to extenuating circumstances they trade places. And his faithful dog (Rimshot) is canned. Now before you recoil I mean the canine is restrained from exposing the imposter by being restrained in a trash can. Will Ernest be able to save the dog or is it all over?",1502755200,,606,4.611111111111111

8560055,4,B00B04NJ3U,"I grew up with the Ernest movies. Ernest Saves Christmas and this one, Ernest Goes To Camp. I still don't understand why, with the popularity of Ernest, that Saves Christmas isn't on blu-ray. All the other great Ernest movies are on blu. Oh, well. The picture quality, with two movies being on one disc, is quite outstanding. Especially when it comes to Mill Creek's releases. Haven't watched Camp Nowhere yet. Not that interested, to tell you the truth, but I'm sure I'll watch it someday. I just got this because it was a cheap way to get Goes To Camp, a movie that I rented...and rented, and rented more times than I can count when I was a kid. I completely wore out my own copy of it.

The only bad thing that I can say about this release is that there are no special features. I'm sure they could have put together some interviews with Jim Varney or a commentary with the remaining cast. Or even a short behind the scenes featurette. But Ernest on blu-ray, even without features, is worth the money.",1405814400,,1004,4.456521739130435
