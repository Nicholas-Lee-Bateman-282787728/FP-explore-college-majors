5320774,5,B009DPAKTO,"This is such a fun way to bond with my daughters and get some cardio in. It keeps my girls engaged and gives us all a much needed workout in our day. Not only that, it teaches at the same time. It helps to drive home many of my own lessons and increase their motor skills while working out.

'I can Do It' let's y girls get some controlled screaming out while we run around the house. 'Saturday' is a great way to help them learn the days of the week. For a long time my oldest (3) called them Oneday, Twoday, Threeday....and this song helped her to correct that and understand where we are in the week.

I always love and appreciate how Patty combines all of the elements that draw children in and hold their attention while teaching them. Music and learning go well with preschool age kids. My kids now even make up their own songs about things going on in their lives. Patty is a modern day Mr. Rogers and a much needed",1389139200,,922,4.203389830508475
