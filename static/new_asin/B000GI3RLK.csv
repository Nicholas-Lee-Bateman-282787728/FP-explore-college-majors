2967238,4,B000GI3RLK,"Really interesting film about the sub-culture of those artists that use graffiti as an outlet for their talent. It gives examples of several artists: how they live, how they work, their inspiration and difficulties.  The work they do is just not a being recognized as art and appreciated.",1431734400,,288,5.0

2967240,1,B000GI3RLK,"I don't know.  When it comes to graffiti, I don't see the beauty of it.  Painting in places where you don't own the property is vandalism.  But do we want a world where all the buildings and walls are the same?  Hard to say.  People find beauty in many different things.  Trixter has the ugliest and most annoying tag of any of them.  You need to like this kind of art to get any enjoyment out of this documentary/movie.  For most of the film, I was bored.  The camera work was ok, but nothing great.  Very little stands out to make this a great work of cinematography.  I really wanted to stop watching this film several times.  But I kept hoping I'd find atleast one piece of graffiti presented that I liked.  I never did.  It is so ugly.  So annoying.  I just wish it would go away.  Unless you like graffiti, don't waste your time with this movie.  I don't know how I made it to the end.",1419206400,,891,4.171597633136095
2967241,5,B000GI3RLK,"There are so many creative artists that are unknown to the art world. I hope the ""Rock Fresh"" movie shows how some artists do what they love to do and live life. It is sometimes is not so easy to just follow the dream. Thanks! R.A",1410998400,,230,4.021739130434782
2967242,1,B000GI3RLK,This was the worst documentary ever!! it was a waste of time in my life watching that!! It was so dragged on and boring there are way better films about graffiti then this one!!!,1299456000,,178,4.264705882352941
2967243,5,B000GI3RLK,Definitely a must have for all die hard collectors.  Style is refreshing and content is original.  Rock Fresh is hands down one of the best urban documentaries if not one of the best urban films.  Director's style is a standout and really engages you as if you were right there behind the lense. Highly recommended.,1181260800,,315,4.6909090909090905
2967244,5,B000GI3RLK,"This one's diffrent because you get to see sorta the process of t shirt making. A display of selling your art and making it a business. Like other

videos the artists' break their stlyes down and why it's like that. More

hardcore ups and downs for the element. Good effort for the work on this movie.",1165536000,2,301,4.357142857142857
2967245,5,B000GI3RLK,"HIGHLY RECOMMEND. intoxicating, infectious, ethereal. despite the user's comment below, i found this film the exact opposite. very entertaining, informative, and most of all chock full of beautiful art. maybe the user below is one of those hardcore right wing graffiti enthusiasts, but for the majority of us who dabble in art, this film is a huge inspiration. the theme is simple - do you art at all costs. even if that means going it alone. ROCK FRESH was very well done. the extra scenes are very cool too. this dvd is definitely worth adding to your collection.",1162425600,3,565,4.775510204081633
2967246,2,B000GI3RLK,"Hard to get through, I was bored after the first 30 minutes.  It was poorly written, directed and edited... the storyline just wasn't there.  It became redundant with lines of fortune cookie text scrolling accross the screen.  Its too bad since the artists represented have been an influence in my practice.  If you want to be inspired, Piece By Piece is a great doc. about the history of SF graffiti.  Style Wars will always be a classic.  Graffiti Verite 1 is watchable.",1157155200,,472,4.695121951219512

8222971,5,B000GI3RLK,"Graff is not a subculture. Writing is culture.
So knock it off with the reviews of the masses in which choose to remain ignorant enough to even understand.
This film is very well done. Written, shot, directed.
So take your silly meds and chill",1494374400,,243,4.545454545454546
