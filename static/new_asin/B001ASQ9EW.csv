3466870,5,B001ASQ9EW,"I had bought this for my husband who has been searching for this series everywhere! Netflix nor Hulu had it, so when i snagged it on here, he was very very happy! The quality was great, and the boxes were in great condition.",1473120000,,224,4.232558139534884
3466871,4,B001ASQ9EW,"First off, I would not call this a ""box set"" as the title claims. Each season does have a matching case and were each individually factory sealed, however that's as far as a ""set"" as it went. The 3 seasons were held together with plain old clear mailing/packaging tape for the ""box set"".

Outside of that, I enjoyed watching this again. I never saw it during it's original air date but I used to stay up until 3am on Saturday night/Sunday mornings each weekend and watch this show until it was taken off. I surprisingly remembered a lot of it after all of these years and while most of it is rather corny, the story is still enjoyable. The characters kind of grow on you and while the first 2 seasons mostly setup characters and events, the overall plot was good, especially when it finally picks up for the final season. My only complaint is that the last episode, while it ends the story well, felt too rushed suddenly at the end and could have been stretched out maybe 1 more episode.

Overall I'm very  happy to finally have this series as it was in my wishlist for years hoping I could find a good price for the full series. I think the whole ""box set"" thing would have been nicer if it actually had a nice little box to hold all 3 seasons instead of them just being taped together, but the seasons were all factory sealed and new and everything played without problems so I'm happy with the purchase!",1470268800,,1406,4.379310344827586

3466874,3,B001ASQ9EW,"Let me start by separating the show from the release/packaging. The show was great. I got it on the rec of a friend and loved the interaction of the main characters. And the ferrets. Can't forget the ferrets! But, I will agree with other reviews that the choice to package the 6 dvds of each season into staggered trays of 3 dvds per side was horrible. It is practically impossible to open any of the cases without discs coming out, leading to scratches on even new sets. I'm seriously considering storing the discs in replacement cases except that the artwork is not transferrable. Unfortunately there aren't any other real options. Call it 5 stars for the show and 1 star for the cases averaging a 3. Thanks.",1464307200,,710,4.5984251968503935

3466885,5,B001ASQ9EW,This was a good followup series based on the movie.  There were some problems in that Curupira was never rescued and the third season changed the entire dynamic with the introduction  of Mark Singer and Dar's lost family.

The beastmaster has a great body, it would have been fine for once in a while for him to were clothes from time to time. But still a great bod.

Then to make matters worse I had to search around for a Dvd player that would do all regions as it only came in region 1 and I only had a region 4 pal player. I am sorry now that I bought them because I can not return them as it is passed the return date and I can not afford to buy another set,then I am still not sure if the next set could be scratched too if I tried to do another order sorry people next time I think I will be a bit more carefull about what I buy and where from.

3466899,4,B001ASQ9EW,"This review is for ""Beastmaster: Complete Collection"" 18 Disc DVD Set

September 29, 2008: ""ADV Replies To Inquiry About The Scarcity Of 'Beastmaster: Complete Collection'.""

I received an email from ADV concerning the scarcity of this DVD set, which I have placed, along with my email to them, in the comments [9/30/08--I have also copied a notice posted on tvshowsondvd.com concerning the cancellation of this set].  I was deeply saddened to read that the available copies are essentially ""mistakes;"" and those of us that have them are more than a little lucky.  I can only iterate what the customer service rep states: ""Hopefully ADV will be able to release this in the future.""  For all of you who have not been able to find it, I suggest writing to ADV encouraging them to release the set--squeaky wheals usually get greased!

Andre Norton's (noms de plume for author Alice Mary Norton) ""Beast Master,"" first published in 1959, established themes that were common to many of her books: 1) the plot takes place in the open countryside, with only short episodes in a city environment. Protagonists usually move about singly or in small groups, and in conflict situations they are more often scouts, spies or guerillas rather than regular soldiers in large military formations; 2) locations are usually earth like places, where humans can live without special protection, and have extensive flora and fauna which are described in considerable detail and often have substantial bearing on the plot; 3) the presence of sympathetically presented feudal and tribal cultures (particularly Navajo culture); and, 4) the important role of animals--both ordinary ones, such as cats, and exotic fictional ones, like unicorns, whose characteristics are meticulously worked out. The animals are often highly intelligent without being anthropomorphic, acting as virtually full partners to the human protagonists and frequently they form telepathic links with each other.  AND THESE THEMES ARE THE BEST DESCRIPTION OF ""BEASTMASTER"" POSSIBLE.

While the character in the book, Hosteen Storm, travels between planets within the context of these themes, the story line establishes the basis for the first movie, ""Beastmaster"" (1982).  In the movie, the main character, Dar, plays out the themes within the context of a fantasy story set in an imaginary world of sorcery and magic: Dar, with the help of a ""companions"" Seth and Kiri, seeks ""vengeance"" against warlord/sorcerer Maax.  ""Beastmaster 2: Through the Portal of Time"" (1991) renews the interplanetary nature of the book as Dar travels to earth, and its inherent ""evil,"" technology, and lack ""earthliness.""  Then in ""Beastmaster: The Eye of Braxus"" (1996) Dar, while wandering with his animal companions, chances to meet and ""rescue"" a family who seek the help of King Tal, Dar's brother and ""King,"" against Lord Agon, a sorcerer who has conquered their land.

""Beastmaster: Complete Collection"" (1999-2002), then, with some minor changes, picks up the story of Dar after the lands have been ransacked and Dar's family and tribe have been essentially wiped out.  Employing Andre Norton's four basic themes, the television series' arcs parallel the plots of the three movies (which may be why both the second movie and the second season are often seen as the weakest by some).  The arc of the first season tells the story of Dar (played by Daniel Goddard): (1) Dar finding out about who he is and what his hopes and dreams are; (2) Dar forming his ""new family""--Ru, a tiger friend; Koto and Poto, two expelled ferret friends; Sharak, who was once a man (played by Daniel Fitzgerald), but was turned into an eagle because of his deep love for the Sorceress (played by Monika Schnarre); Curupira (played by Emilie de Ravin), a demon who is the guardian of all the animals and has granted Dar his ability to speak with the animals; and Tao (i.e., Seth), played by Jackson Raine, who is sort of trickster character with knowledge of plants and ""Science;"" (3) Dar's search for his soul mate, Kyra (i.e., Kiri), played by Natalie Jackson Mendoza--who is first captured by King Zad, played by Steven Grives, and then hidden by The Ancient One, played by Grahame Bond; and (4) Dar recognizing and attempting to understand the idea (also the over riding series arc) that the world is changing, civilization is advancing, technology is gaining ground slowly, the old orders of magic and sorcery are fading, and the world is threatened by the supernatural being Balcifer, the Dark One, played by Jeremy Callaghan.

The arc of the second season, as with the second movie, finds Dar and his companions coming dangerously close to loosing to the spread of ""civilizations"" or material culture, the damage of technologically ""advanced"" tribes, and the losses of Kyra (killed in the last episode of season one), Curupira, and the Sorceress--although he gains a new friend in a former enemy, Arina, played by Marjean Holden.  Tao's ways of logic and science increasingly challenge and intercede into Dar's world; indeed, Xinca (visually looking like an Inca city) becomes the focus of many of the episodes, rather than the ""outdoors/forests.""  ""Tribal"" customs are caving in face of rampant ""civilized"" materialism and greed.  Dar's ability to be the Beastmaster is constantly challenged and eroded by events and actions precipitated by others.

The third season arc, like the third movie, brings the story full circle, as Dar finds out from Dartanus (played by Marc Singer, who ""poetically"" played Dar in the three movies), a Spirit Warrior, who informs Dar that he is really the son of King Eldar, who was killed by Balcifer the last time he attempted to take over the world (the first ""Beastmaster"" movie?).  As such, Dar is the only person who can stop Balcifer, the Dark One, from taking over the world by ""rescuing"" his family, who were turned into animals by his father to protect them from Balcifer's previous attempt to take over the world.  Again, this all occurs within the context of Andre Norton's four themes.

""Beastmaster: Complete Collection"" is fantasy cinema at its best.  The stories are often fantastical, humorous, educational, and entertaining--like any great ""tribal"" or ""trickster"" story.  Episodes frequently include stock footage of various wildlife that adds to the vastness of the story.  Season 2 and 3 have some interesting question and answer bonus features with Danial Goddard.  The only real blemish is with the DVD editing, as the breaks for commercials are frequently poorly done.  If you are looking for good, fun, entertainment, ""Beastmaster: Complete Collection"" is top notch.  I have contacted ADV Films to inquire as to why this set is out of print already, as it just came out on August 5, 2008!  So, hopefully, I can update this with their ""justification"" for not making this set more available.

If this review was not helpful to you, I would appreciate learning the reason(s) so I can improve my reviews. My goal is to provide help to potential buyers, not get into any arguments. So, if you only disagree with my opinion, could you please say so in the comments and not indicate that the review was not helpful. Thanks.",1222300800,,7189,5.067796610169491
3466900,5,B001ASQ9EW,"Whats's up with the Beastmaster? Season 3 almost unavailable at any price and now the complete collection -- released back in August --109.00!!  Oil or gold isn't as volatile!.  Fortunately, I got it locally  for 5 bucks more than it was offered on Amazon upon release, but at blodd diamond partner price offered here now, I'm not complaining.

This boxed kit compilation, assuming you can get it, is a very entertaining and even educational show. They are always dropping pearls of wisdom such as  ""if you seek revenge, then you are a prisoner, a prisoner of your own rage(sic),""  or ""the world is always a better place when a bad king is removed(sic) "" and so on.

The animals are also delightful  to look at, though they make use of stock nature footage for some of the scenes.  As a ferret owner, there are things that these beasts can do and cannot do (the chattering and squeaky sounds they make are of course dubbed, ferrets are largely silent) but they are interesting to view nevertheless.  I wish they would have used the ferrets in more espionage or theft scenes especially in the 2nd season as they seem to have largely gone missing, but were more visible in the third season.

Dar (beastmaster) and his sidekick Tahl (however its spelled) are good actors for their roles and in this regard the series is surprisingly good.  I watched this as part of UPN's Sci fi Saturday several years ago which included a line up of Andromeda, Earth Final frontier, Xeena, Cleopatra 2144 whatever), Mutant X, Hercules, and Stargate and maybe something else.  Unfortunately, all things must come to an end and now football and other ""balls"" fill those slots.  Not being a sports person, these hold little interest for me, but I digress.  UPN  re-ran the three Beastmaster seasons at least 3 times and I did not mind viewing them again each time.

Beastmaster highlights:

--Suitable main actors; heroic muscular Dar and intellectual but barely physical capable Tahl contrast each other well
--Largely interesting supporting guest and reoccurring actors King Zhad, Sorceress (and her subplot story), the phthalocyanine green demon girl and her backwards feet (hey, didn't she show up pregnant on ""Lost) and others.
--Animals and their antics are a continual interest driver (it IS the beastmaster after all).
--Special effects and sets are for the most part ""professionally"" done and do not look obviously fake (view Conan the Series, special effects are weak but a good series nevertheless).
--NO COMMERCIALS.  Modern TV is so clogged with loud blaring commercials almost making the show watching experience torturously tedious.  On DVD, one sees the mini-cliffhanger and gets immediate gratification as to what happens next without waiting through the intervening commercial.  On the other hand, I have noticed some memorable scenes seemed far less so as there is no time for the scene to build up suspense, ""percolating in the consciousness,""  before resolution.

Noticeable cons
-- Though the third season seemed the weakest of the group, it brings in Mac Singer of Beastmaster movie fame. The last year is largely an ""easter egg"" hunt.  This rather dorky ""look for stupid stuff"" story arc seems somewhat incongruent with what went on before which may be part of why the third series was withdrawn  by the studio prior to this Compilation.  But and I'll not go far into it lest things be spoiled.  However, there are surprises and it wraps up the series and loose ends created by the first two years.

Must have at its release price.  Any higher amount is a negotiation between your ""must have"" factor and ""disposable income"" stat.",1222128000,,3631,4.925986842105263
