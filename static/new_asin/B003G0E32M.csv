8396286,2,B003G0E32M,"This DVD is 47 minutes long.  The majority of these 47-minutees is devoted to still-life animated illustrations of the Buddha's life, from birth.  These animated still-lifes, standing alone,  could be much more compelling if incorporated in an otherwise more effective DVD production (see below).

This DVD is not a product of PBS, but would have been dazzling if PBS had produced this film.  PBS should consider producing a new film based on this DVD's concept, which is brilliant.  This DVD's concept is particularly attractive, with explosive sales potential, considering the rapidly growing interest in Buddhism in the ""West,"" and corresponding ""themed"" tours of ""Buddhist sites"" now being marketed in India.

The supposed ""stars"" of this WALK WITH THE MASTER: THE STORY OF THE SITES OF THE BUDDHA DVD, should be color photography of all of the pilgrimage sites (which are all in India) where the Buddha taught and lived 2,500 years ago - 500 years before Jesus Christ.

These Buddhist pilgrimage sites in this DVD consist of historical building structures, not much of which remains today, other than some of the brick foundations of these extensive temple or ""university"" educational complexes.  These brick foundations at least provide an outline of the size and layout of the original buildings and building complexes (e.g., palaces, monasteries, and devotional shrines), typically in park-like settings.

This DVD's ""explanatory"" narration coverage, of each of the Buddhist sites addressed in this DVD, is extremely weak, and some sites are not even effectively identified in the narration.  For example, this film mentions, in passing, the Indian emperor Asoka, an extremely pivotal figure in early Buddhism, but omits this opportunity to educate viewers about Emperor Asoka's influence in the growth of early Buddhism - for a contrast, see hostess Bettany Hughes' effective and illuminating commentary about Asoka, presented at the end of the Bouhanath Stupa scene, and at the beginning of the Temple of the Tooth scene, in the PBS DVD entitled SEVEN WONDERS OF THE BUDDHIST WORLD.

Unfortunately, this DVD's color photography is inferior and relatively ineffective.  The lighting of the outdoor film shots is often poor, because filming was often shot late in the day, with obscuring shadows, and poor focus.  Particularly ineffective is the extremely terse duration of most of the shots, which last only a few seconds.  All of the film's shots, of historic building structures,  are taken at ground-level, with viewing basically restricted to the foreground, which makes it impossible to obtain an overall impression of some of the foundations of these extensive temple complexes, and surrounding grounds.  The ""screen"" shots are very narrow, restricting the scope of one's view.  A viewer is only afforded a tantalizing taste of what these extremely important sites actually look like - and a little aerial photograph of these sites would have been a tremendous help.

This DVD's animated biography of the Buddha, as presented in this DVD, is in a presentation format which is probably more attractive and interesting to children than to adults.  This DVD's narration (and film script) is poor.  The narration is presented by two persons from India, with accented English.  In fact, this DVD is a product of an Indian company, and the film's credits only list people with Indian-sounding names.

As an alternative DVD selection, PBS has an absolutely marvelous, 2 hour DVD entitled THE BUDDHA: THE STORY OF SIDDHARTHA, a film by David Grubin, narrated by Richard Gere, and published (in 2010) by PBS - the Public Broadcasting System.  This DVD contains not only some much more compelling animated visual material, but also wonderful and informative commentary by delightful and radiant scholars who explicate - and who also seem to personally embody and exemplify - the Buddha's teachings, i.e., the ""Buddha Dharma.""

Another alternative DVD selection - also by PBS - is SEVEN WONDERS OF THE BUDDHIST WORLD, which is very effectively narrated and hosted by the fetching Bettany Hughes.  For comparison purposes - to illustrate the explosive potential presented by the concept of this WALK WITH THE MASTER DVD, take a look at the stunning photography and narration about the Mahabodhi Temple in Bodhgaya, India, as presented by Bettany Hughes.  For comparison, then take a look at the pathetic version of Mahabodhi Temple coverage in the WALK WITH THE MASTER DVD, and imagine what a DVD would look like if each and every one of the exotic historical sites of the Buddha's teaching were presented in the same way, on one DVD, which would be closer in length to 2-hours of fascinating viewer coverage.

Either Richard Gere or Bettany Hughes (or both) would be perfect choices as narrators of a PBS film about the sites of the Buddha's teachings and life.

ADDENDUM: Relevant to some of the Buddhist pilgrimage sites covered in WALK WITH THE MASTER, is that, at the time of his death, the Buddha asked his followers (disciples) to ""remember"" (not ""worship"") him by making pilgrimage to the four most important places in the Buddha's life: (1) where he was born; (2) where he attained enlightenment; (3) where he gave his first teachings; and (4) the place of his death - these Buddhist sites are included in the WALK WITH THE MASTER DVD.",1322352000,2,5347,5.14203233256351
