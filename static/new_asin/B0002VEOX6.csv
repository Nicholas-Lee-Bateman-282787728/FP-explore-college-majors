8032713,4,B0002VEOX6,"Buffalo Bob shows the cast of the first program a very, very large box wrapped in white paper and a large white bow. The lid of the box is opened to reveal that Bob has purchased gifts for all the cast. Mayor Bluster gets a book on manners, Happy gets a hand-held mirror, which later on in the show she sings about, Corny gets a life-size dummy, NIcholsen gets some little object, the Doodlers get a toy piano and other toy instruments, Clarabell gets a life-size dummy of himself and Dilly Dally gets a $6.50 toy male doll, which Clarabell breaks. That's the whole primus for the rest of the outings that follow. Bob hires a scientist to build Dilly a bionic man.
This DVD is from the 1970's Florida based Howdy Doody show. The dumbest character in the show is Happy the school teacher with her baby-talk voice. Yet, when she sings she has an alto voice. She always dresses in a red &white skimpy, short overalls outfit with high heels, go figure. Anyway, the show would have been better off without Happy.
The other episodes simply show the gang in the make shift lab of Professor Zwienstein (Corny's old storage room) dressed in surgical gear slicing open Clarabell's look-a-like dummy.
For the price I paid for this DVD, I thought I got my money's worth.
It was a cute and in color newer installment of the original Howdy Doody Show based in New York City.",1423612800,,1360,4.510121457489879
