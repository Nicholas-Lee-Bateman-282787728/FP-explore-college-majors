8538994,5,B009B0L586,"'Dropout Nation' focuses on four at-risk students at Sharpstown High in Houston. Its student body are largely poor, and minority - the school was labeled a dropout factory by a Johns Hopkins University study in 2007; during that year 41% of high-school-aged children zoned to Sharpstown chose to attend a different Houston ISD school. (A freshman Sharpstown class earlier in the decade numbered 1,000, then dwindled to less than 300 by the end of their senior year.) The district's 2011 graduation rate was 78.5%, up 14 points from 2007 - presumably due to a special program (Apollo) funded by $61 million in special funding. Sharpstown itself sees less than 60% of the freshman class still enrolled their senior year.

Sharpstown's Apollo coordinator, Brandi Brevard, works 10 - 12 hours/day to help her charges, picking some up, providing snacks, and sometimes even inviting them to live at her place. The school replaced half its teachers - however, the story centered on Brandi, two deans, and the principal. The program's first year's academic results were modest (improved math - mostly due to hiring additional tutors, minimal reading improvement), and spun as a success. The second year results were not impressive.

Marcus is the first pupil introduced, and receives the most screen time. He's intelligent, but doesn't regularly attend his first two classes due to family issues (alcoholic father abandons them) keeping him up late. (He lives only one-block from school.) His main motivation to attend school is to play football. Despite his personal insights that allow him to describe why he's not doing well at school, he also loses control and starting a fight the last day of school - threatening his future.

Sparkle, a Katrina refugee, homeless young mother (mother died shortly after she moved to Houston), and potential dropout, is obviously intelligent, but doesn't want to talk about her problems. Texas's authorities took her child, she's attempting to regain custody, and coming to school once or twice a week. After leaving school she went to Dallas to visit her brother - during that visit he was killed, and she planned to stay in Dallas.

Lawrence is close to graduating, smart enough to do so, but has anger and motivation issues. He's working 40 hours/week to support the family after his father was deported to Mexico. Lawrence ends up leaving out of resistance to taking a low stakes standardized test, and reportedly is still living in the area.

Marco is the only one of the four who doesn't seem very self-aware - yet, is the only one to clearly succeed during the documented semester. He ends up joining the Army.

Viewers may be tempted to blame the difficulties of these students on an impersonal system. That would be wrong - the program should have also provided insights from the home environments and compared those with more successful settings. The obvious questions:  1)'Where are the parents and what are they doing, not-doing?' 2)'Where are the African-American community leaders?'

Trend data on dropout rates going back to eg. the 1970s should also have been provided - thus allowing some sense of the impact of nearly tripling inflation-adjusted per-pupil operating spending over that span. (Part of the problem is that the definition of 'dropout' keeps changing, muddying the data. Another problem - schools deliberately miscoding why pupils stop coming, often claiming that 'they'd moved.' Still another technique - unaccredited home-schooling programs offering a high-school diploma for eg. $300 and some completed workbooks, or an online exam; at least one offers to go over the test material ahead of time in the office with the students.)

Bottom-Line: The Houston school district has a history of gross dropout data distortion - former superintendent Rod Paige had claimed dropout rates of 1.5%, and hundreds of thousands of dollars had been awarded in incentive payouts. Paige went on to become President Bush's Secretary of Education. It's not clear that the data provided Frontline is accurate even now.

Three-quarters of the pupils' problems were outside of school - thus, replacing so many teachers clearly seems to be misdirected effort and blame.  Further, any 'No Excuses' model of education seems naive and unrealistic. Finally, as pointed out elsewhere, while we have plenty of school data, longitudinal, value-added analysis of student, school and teacher performance needed to improve education is needed and not available.",1365638400,6,4491,5.197786998616874
8538995,2,B009B0L586,"The nation has a large dropout problem, especially as brawn jobs disappear and employers only offer brain jobs.  This gives two hours of footage at an actual high school focusing upon four students.  For middle-class Americans, this may feel like looking at the other side of the tracks.  The big point that one gets from this footage is that dropping out is a multiply-caused phenomenon.  These students are dealing with homelessness, teen parenthood, deportation of family members, and especially anger issues.

I never use the term ""acting out"" because I am not quite sure what it means.  I really think it means different things to different people.  But that term comes up here a lot because the students are having troubles at home or on the streets and they vent their anger at school.  If you don't like watching youth mouth off to adults, then you don't want to see this work.  If you hate people who don't know how to channel their anger appropriately or effectively, then you will want to punch a wall after seeing this.  I really think the program-makers want viewers to sympathize with both staff and students.  However, many viewers will leave feeling like the students are mostly to blame for their problems.  Many other viewers may ask, ""Where are their parents!?!?""  At any given moment, most parents are not at their high schools.  However, there are plenty of documentaries out there where you see parents visiting the principal or looking into their kids' problems at school.  I think this work may have focused on parent-less children and I am not convinced that those students make up the majority of dropouts.

I'm also torn about this documentary due to ""great white savior"" coverage.  Films like ""Dangerous Minds"" suggest that inner-city kids can't and don't have role models unless selfless, courageous white educators come to their rescue.  Too often, teachers of color and adult mentors of color are rendered invisible in the media.  However, I have a cousin-in-law who works at a high school in which he admits that the student population is 100% Black but the faculty is 80% white.  He admits something I sometimes forget: not enough teachers of color are out there.  Don't get me wrong: the program does show at least one Latina and one African-American staff member.  However, the work focuses on a white female counselor and a white male principal.  They have that soothing counselor style.  It's quite opposite of my late father who had an authoritative, ""Lean on Me"" type of style.

This is not a movie, so the term ""spoiler alert"" shouldn't really apply.  Still, I must say something about the ending.  The four students are a Black female, a Latino male, and two Black males.  The Black female dropped out.  Nationwide, I think the numbers suggest that girls graduate at much higher rates than boys.  Of the four, only the Latino guy graduates.  I salute him.  However, I think the numbers suggest that Latino high school students graduate at lower rates than African Americans.  They have the added issue of ESL matters.  Although this high school is located in Texas, limited English is not shown here and yet it's a huge problem.  I can think of other reasons why teens drop out of schools (e.g., bullying, homophobia, gang problems, etc.).  The silence on these and other matters may frustrate some viewers.",1360800000,2,3348,4.874113475177305
