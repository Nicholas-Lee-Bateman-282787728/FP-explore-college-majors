6934165,5,B00RPOQA9E,"I have always liked ridiculous sci-fi films from the 1960s, and this DVD is wonderfully representative of the genre. ""Zontar, The Thing From Venus"" is one of my all-time favorite cheesy sci-fi movies. It was made by Larry Buchanan in 1966 as a remake of ""It Conquered The World,"" which is itself an enjoyable bit of B-Grade cinema. By all estimates the remake is horribly inferior to the original, but ""Zontar"" makes up for in silliness and bogus science what it lacks in quality production values. The most notable difference between ""Zontar"" and ""It Conquered The World"" is the monster. Zontar looks like a three-eyed, hooded Sleestak with pincher jaws, whereas the original monster looked like an enraged carrot.

The story concerns Keith, a brilliant lunatic scientist (Tony Huston) who conspires to bring Zontar from his home planet to help the people of Earth become more peaceful. His friend, Curt (the always gentlemanly John Agar) thinks he is nuts and eventually convinces him that he must destroy Zontar, who has taken up residence in a local cave because ""it is close to his Venus environment."" (Sure.) Zontar attempts to take over the world by launching ""injectapods"" at people which fly to their victims and implant a pin in their neck making them a biological sub-unit of Zontar. (Following all this?) I love watching the injectapods fly, and you will too when you watch this movie.

After much bloodshed and panic in the streets (sample exchange after the power has gone out: ""My husband's in an iron lung, what shall I do?""...now that's dialogue you don't see in just any film,) Keith finally dispatches Zontar with a ""Plutonium-Ruby Crystal Beam Gun"" which involves the funniest special effect I have ever seen on film. The movie concludes with a real Ed Wood moment of solemn pondering about the future of mankind.

In a nutshell, this is a great piece of cheese. Sure it's silly, Sure it is ludicrous watching Keith speak to Zontar via some radio gear that just goes ""Bwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwu"" over and over. But if you are looking for an excellent piece of mid 1960s paranoid sci-fi lunacy, ""Zontar: The Thing From Venus"" would be tough to beat!

""In The Year 2889,"" on the other hand, is a dour post-nuclear annihilation movie where a group of dissimilar people survive in a big house in a secluded valley, and have to figure out who is going to repopulate the earth. This cast is fronted by former Mouseketeer Paul Petersen and the lovely Quinn O'Hara along with Buchanan regular Neil Fletcher (""Zontar"" and ""Creature of Destruction"") as Captain John Ramsey, the leader of the motley crew. The film is straightforward and bleak, and features endless discussion of the chances of rain, and when the meteorology angle gets boring, has various subplots running hither and yon involving a psychopathic misogynist, a hilarious monkey-monster with long gray hair, mange, and a fear of water, girls in bikinis swimming in a pool (yes, it's truly a struggle to survive...,) and the least sexy dance number in film history. The lines of conflict are pretty clear and it's no surprise how the film will end: I loved the final shot of a couple holding hands and a title card reading ""The Beginning."" Nice touch.

These films were made on a miniscule budget, but both worked in the cold war inspired world that tainted so many of these early science fiction films. While I absolutely love ""Zontar,"" ""In The Year 2889"" is also a fascinating and worthwhile (if depressing) B-movie from Buchanan. If you are looking for 1960s cinematic cheese, this combination is hard to beat.",1283385600,5,3580,4.881578947368421

6934167,2,B00RPOQA9E,"Zontar: The Thing from Venus: 5 out of 10: This cheap Larry Buchanan remake of the already cheap It Conquered the World has a couple of surprises.

First the things that are not surprises. The movie was made for [...] bucks. The monsters include flying killer lobsters on strings. The comic relief is so painful one must prevent the urge to take a fork to ones ears.

The surprise? Some of the acting is reasonably good. John Agar makes a fine hero and both Pat Delaney and Susan Bjurman are easy on the eyes. There is a lot of killing for a made for TV kids sci-fi (including a vicious uxoricide) and it is surprisingly effective. In fact, the narrative taken as a whole works well considering the main monster is named Zontar and is from Venus.

I recently saw Zontar for the second time and before viewing it, I noticed my score was a decent five out of ten. I felt I must have been in an overly generous mood when I first saw the film but once again, it drew me in not because of the cheese factor as so many cheap sci-fi films do, but despite it. Moreover, the monster at the end is actually pretty well done.

I admit the film causes a spell on me that transports me my nine-year-old self. Despite the fact I never saw the movie as a youth. Like an old Scooby'Doo episode or a Japanese monster movie, Zontar seems to have just the right amount that certain something that makes me feel young again. My nine-year old self is quite impressed with Zontar.

In the Year 2889: 2 out of 10: Great now I can't get that damn song out of my head. (No it doesn't appear on the soundtrack. Cope to think of it I'm not sure if this film even has a soundtrack.) For one thing all the characters dress and look like extras in the Zapruder film so I'm not sure where this whole year 2889 comes from.

The plot of of this made for TV mess? The earth was destroyed by nuclear war except this one house with three months worth of food for three people but then an extra guy shows up with an alcoholic stripper.

Personally if the earth is destroyed by nuclear bombs I'm rooting for the alcoholic stripper to show up. (Heck who am I kidding I'm always rooting for the alcoholic stripper nuclear radioactive fallout or not).

Very talky with some okay performances and silly monsters it is another Buchanan TV remake but better than his usual fair. More time wasting curiosity than anything mistaken for entertainment.",1257984000,4,2404,4.374439461883408
8695689,3,B00RPOQA9E,"Digitally remastered DOES NOT MEAN transferring a VHS tape onto a DVD and that's it. Digitally remastered means Engineers take the original film and transfer it to digital. Then they go through a process of color correction and dust and debris removal. Sound engineers also sweeten the soundtrack, much like remastering an album or CD. Sometimes engineers will change the aspect ratio to make the show or movie widescreen, as opposed to regular television screen size. However, some directors won't change the aspect ratio. David Lynch, for example, insisted on keeping his series ""Twin Peaks"" in its original aspect ratio to stay true to his original vision
This was not done to this DVD. It has all the scratches, color variations - from sepia to fading to color to who knows what. I actually saw a very nice copy from Netflix several years ago but don't know who brought it out. I had a better VHS copy. I like the movie only because I like bad remakes of old semi-bad sci-fi films. Wouldn't recommend buying.",1483747200,,1012,4.788571428571428
8695690,5,B00RPOQA9E,"If you like cheesy movies,like I do, you will love this movie! It has everything: cardboard actors, silly dialogue and ridiculous props. The picture is not dvd quality since it was recorded from a vhs tape, but it is acceptable.",1472774400,,228,4.725
8695691,2,B00RPOQA9E,"Awful recorded quality. Looks like it was copied from an old VHS tape, which was recorded from a worn out movie print. A real shame because I like this B-movie remake of ""It Conquered the World"".",1449014400,6,195,4.444444444444445
8695692,2,B00RPOQA9E,"Exactly what does, ""Digitally Remastered"" mean?

Basically, it doesn't mean anything. If you are to record a VHS tape onto a DVD, it is digitally remastered.  It doesn't mean that the quality was improved in any way.  And the quality on this DVD is poor.

I like bad movies. I have ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"", ""Robot Monster"", ""The Creeping Terror"" and other bad,(good) movies. But this movie is truly bad.",1444003200,6,405,4.661971830985915

8695697,3,B00RPOQA9E,"Dr. Curt Taylor (John Agar) refused to believe there is life, malevolent or benevolent, out there. Mean while brilliant and misunderstood scientist Keith Ritchie (Anthony Houston) invite his Venus buddy Zoltar over to earth to make a few social adjustments.

The philosophical discussions take precedence over the sci-fi action. And the wives (Patricia De Laney and Susan Bjurman) turn out to have a strong influence on the direction of the story.

This is a TV remake of Roger Corman's low budget ""It Conquered the World""

The original film ""It Conquered the World"" with Peter Graves had the alien looking like a rubber creature with tentacles for tootsies. And instead of flying lobsters they used bat like creatures. This film even though a cheap remake seemed to spend more time on significant dialog, making it more relevant to our life.

After watching these two versions of the story, be sure to watch the spoof ""Lobsterman from Mars"" with Tony Curtis.",1421366400,3,959,5.012578616352202
8695698,4,B00RPOQA9E,"Cinematic crapola at its best worst. ""Zontar, etc."", as we all know by now, is a rip-off of Corman's ""It Conquered the World"". Pretty much the same story line, but different looking Venusian. Hilariously bad, although John Agar gives his usual square-jawed and gritty performance as the heroic scientist out to save the world from boredom.

Speaking of boredom, ""In the Year 2889"" is a rip-off remake of Roger Corman's ""The Day the World Ended"" and stars Paul Peterson of ""The Donna Reed Show"" fame. Shot in glorious MuddyColor on grainy film, it concerns survivors of a nuclear attack and how they gravitate to a haven from the deadly radiation and bore the audience to death. Some cheesy chics of the era make for a distraction from the story (thankfully). But, all in all, one wishes that it was a different bunch of people (better actors, anyway) who found their way to this 'oasis' conveniently stocked with enough food to feed the entire cast of extras in a DeMille biblical epic. Mind-numbingly bad. And, in this case, that's good, right?",1330819200,2,1045,4.805555555555555
