7932809,4,B000056WSQ,"The first time I watched this episode of the Powerpuff Girls, I laughed until I cried. My tears were joyous and full of amusement. You know the three sisters who fight crime for Townsville but they decided to make another sister who could battle corruption for them. Bunny is lovable but a bit twisted in more ways that one. I would like to see a question on Jeopardy that asks ""What was the Powerpuff's fourth sister's name?"" I bet not too many people would know the answer. Now you know the response to the question.",1258588800,,518,4.463157894736842
7932810,5,B000056WSQ,"the powerpuff girls are just plain awesome, and not just for kids.  while the adventures of the three super powered little girls will certainly keep kids entertained the producers manage to throw in quite a few tid bits of adult(not like ADULT xxx or anything) humor as well, in particular the episode ""something's a Ms."" on this VHS has many references to the movie ""the big lebowski"" with various characters playing the roles of characters in the movie, the funniest being bubbles as John Goodman's character and the mayor as the other Jeff Lebowski.  Check it out, many episodes have underlying stories that the kids might miss.",1122595200,,631,4.88785046728972
7932811,4,B000056WSQ,"The episodes in this collection have a common theme:  a deviation from the way the closing credits are announced or the appearance of characters, i.e. it isn't always the Powerpuff Girls who ""save the day"" or if they do, it's presented in a different way.
""Twisted Sister"", which has nothing to do with Dee Snider, has the Powerpuff Girls so drained from fighting crime non-stop they decide to create a fourth member.  As Bubbles says, ""Three puffs aren't enough."" Unfortunately, they end up creating Bunny, the overgrown Igor-like ogre on the front cover.  Morals of the story:  A) interpretations of what's nice is relative and hence deviates from the original.  Kind of like the difference between Marxism and Leninism B) let Bubbles pick the ingredients--she chooses the best one.  Unfortunately, the story goes downhill from there, with a predictable denouement.  (Rating:  3)
Fortunately, things get better from there.  In ""Something's A Ms.,"" the Mayor's reliable and intelligent secretary Ms. Bellum repeatedly asks for time off, seducing the old codger with kisses.  Then, robberies begin, with her reporting the crime.  Ms. Bellum might as well be the Mayor's brain.  When she leaves, he's more or less a statue.  The emphasis here is that Ms. Bellum might as well be the glue holding Townsville's administration together.  Nothing had better happen to her.  (Rating:  4)
""The Mane Event"" has Buttercup and Bubbles giving Blossom a hideous haircut without her knowledge, partly to cover up a mistake, partly as a practical joke.  How hideous?  Even the monster whom they're out to fight laughs.  The scene where Buttercup and Blossom's cheeks puff out in an effort to restrain their laughter is classic, followed by their outburst of hilarity.  As the Professor tells Blossom, turn that hair-don't into a hair-do, and she does.  The scene of a happy Blossom waving her long red hair in its majesty like a fashion model is also cool.  (Rating:  5.. snrrk.. HA HA HA HA HA HA!  Omigod, Blossom, you look.. OK, I'll be nice)
The music video here is Shonen Knife's ""Buttercup (I'm A Super Girl),"" also found on the Boogie Frights compilation, but worth watching over and over anyday.  (Rating:  5).
""Criss Cross Crisis"" is the weirdest and most anarchic episode I've seen.  An experiment of the Professor involving apples and oranges results in mass body swaps a la movies like Vice Versa, Big, and Freaky Friday.  To make matters worse, someone takes advantage of the chaos to stage robberies.  All the time, the Professor in Buttercup's body(!), keeps pulling the lever of his machine to get the right frequency.  With the results he gets, he might as well be playing with a one-armed bandit.  (""No... no..."").  Well worth watching for its sheer anarchy and seeing Blossom as a weiner dog.  (Rating:  5)
""Power Lunch"" actually makes the Gangreen Gang interesting.  After pigging out on junk food at a convenience store, they are zapped by the Powerpuff Girls' laser eyes.  A chemical reaction gives them superpowers, mostly based on the kind of food they gobbled up.  For once, the Powerpuffs are defeated by them.  Ace's recalls Mr. Freeze and Snake's recalls Mr. Fantastic.  Grubber's powers had me rolling on the floor--hint he drank soft drinks.  (Rating:  5).
""Dexter's Lab"" is the best bonus cartoon I've seen.  It involves a dog that follows Dexter home.  Frustrated at being interrupted at his work, Dexter invents a formula enabling the dog to talk.  (Rating:  4).
Overall rating:  (3+4+5+5+5+5+4)/7 = 4.4, rounded to 4.",1033689600,2,3537,5.0
7932812,4,B000056WSQ,"Best cartoon on the video is ""Something's a Ms.,"" which mearks the return of Sedusa, and a new side of Miss Bellum that we have never seen.  Miss Bellum fans will really rejoice with this collection, as the double episode ""Criss Cross Crisis"" puts Blossom into Miss Bellum's body.  Of course, Bubbles ends up in the Mayor's body, and that's ... just ... not right.  Worst cartoon of the lot is ""The Mane Event,"" where Blossom learns to never let her sisters cut her hair.  An intriguing villain, but way too many bad puns associated with it.  The new cartoon ""Power Lunch"" is boffo, with the Gangrene Gang getting superpowers from irridated convenience store food.  Only real bummer is that they picked a so-so Dexter's Lab cartoon - ""Dexter's Lab: A Story"" - for the bonus 'toon.  Still, one of the best videos in the PPG collection.",986601600,4,834,4.63265306122449
