8250494,5,B0013ETE72,"Great dvd instructional for beginner guitar players like myself.  Paul teaches you the basics and by the end of the video you are hopefully playing a large range of worship songs and able to lead a  small group in worship if you like.  From this video, I was able to play a few songs at church and I have been working on the second dvd in the series.

Of course, there is no magic, it takes lots of practice but Paul is encouraging and offers Scripture and does a nice job coaching a beginner.

Surprisingly, you will be playing worship songs very quickly with just a few chords.  Enjoy!",1357948800,2,587,4.339449541284404
