1044684,4,6305508534,"Bruce Lee is fantastic and it is worth seeing him in action on the original widescreen format.  I would have loved to have in the original lanaguge.  The dubbing that CBS/FOX did way back when sounds awlful when  played through a home theatre system.  I think it might have been better to  just get the three Bruce Lee movies, Fist of Fury, Return of the Dragon,  & Chinese Connection seperately.  The Game of Death isn't worth getting  - Bruce Lee is in 13 minutes of film, and 'Bruce Lee the Legend' is ok, but  not BRUCE LEE!!",939513600,4,529,4.371134020618556

1044884,4,6305508534,"The ONLY reason why I'm giving this box set a 4/5 stars is because there is no way to hear the characters speak their actual language: when I watch foreign films I love to hear the actor's real voices and read the subtitles.  But you cant do that with these films, its all in English and with different voice-over actors.  I wish I could of heard Bruce Lee's real voice and read the subtitles.  I am a small minority, however, and if this doesn't bother you then this box set is STILL a must have.  AMAZING.  Seriously its so good and I haven't even finished watching all the movies yet.

1044885,3,6305508534,"Until Enter the Dragon, none of Bruce's films were film with sound. Vocal dubbing and sound effects were added later. The first sync sound Hong Kong movie is Police Story 3. Everything before that was done the old fashioned way.  Enter the Dragon was not a Hong Kong production and it was recorded live mic.
The voice on the Chinese versions are not Bruce Lee.  There is no version of these films with Bruce doing the dubbing.  So, don't let reviews of the dubbing cloud your decision.  Some of amazon's reviewers just don't know what they are talking about.
The 2004 Fox box set is a lot better quality and has had a serious price reduction in recent years.  The DVDs in the recent Shout Factory box may also be an upgrade from this, but who needs another DVD master if we can get this on bluray?
I'm waiting for the Bluray versions to get individual releases.
So here you have a choice of English, Mandarin and Cantonese and none of them really looks right for lip sync, so pick one of the three most right for you and run with it.  This is an old box set that has outlived its welcome by still being available for sale.  Don't buy it if you are picky about best available print and older mastering, then pass on this and move up to the next level.",1391126400,,1250,4.316239316239316

1044965,2,6305508534,"Looks like Marketing did its job but Production totally screwed up here.  The mostly cardboard package is well designed opening up into 5 holders for each of the dvds that comprise this set.  Also included is a nice colour 8-page Program Guide.  Unfortunately this overall package falls extremely short where it matters; in another example of the adage ""you can't judge a book by its cover"" the content is extremely poor!  None of the films have been restored picture quality-wise or remastered sound quality-wise resulting in a barely tolerable viewing experience of what represents the best Bruce Lee films on at least 3 of the 5 discs.  The picture quality is severely lacking with imperfections on virtually every frame while the sound quality comes only in mono.  The last disc which contains a 70's documentary on the life of Bruce Lee done soon after his untimely death is also very raw although it is not the worst disc here.

On the first disc, ""Fists of Fury"", we get an excellent Golden Harvest flick with some of Bruce's best pugilistic skills on show as he defends and avenges his family from the unscrupulous drug dealing Big Boss.  Interestingly, the hero doesn't end up in the usual happy ending that most film-goers are used to as Bruce seems to emphasize the point that violence should only be resorted to as a very last resort and that once you let the cat out of the bag there are serious consequences to deal with even for the innocent victims.

On the second film, ""The Chinese Connection"", we get a more traditional Chinese film in that the scene is set in Shanghai of the 1930s and themes of honour and allegience to a certain school of martial arts are paramount including the need to avenge the murder of one's teacher.  To me this is Bruce's best film as he shows many aspects of his acting skills showing he is not just a great fighter but that he can also emote and act in different roles as he proves in his disguise as an old man and then as a geeky telephone repairman.  There are a lot more extended fighting scenes here as compared to the first film and overall this is a very good film and I rate this even higher than ""Enter the Dragon.""  Again this story shows how violence begets violence and both the guilty and the innocent suffer its consequences in the end.

The third film, ""Return of the Dragon"", is also very enjoyable as Bruce gets a chance to write and direct a script and we get to see a very funny, humorous side of Bruce's acting as well.  We also get cameo appearances by famous other pugilists of the time pitting their skills against the master such as Bob Wall and of course the excellent scene at the end with Chuck Norris at the Colliseum where just like in the ancient times two gladiators fight to the death.  An excellent film and together with ""The Chinese Connection"" represent the best two films of Bruce Lee.

In an attempt to recoup the production costs expended before Bruce's untimely death akin to what's going on now with Michael Jackson, the studios decided to put together whatever they could in a last attempt at cashing in on Bruce's popularity in the unfortunate release of ""Game of Death"" which contains very little of actual Bruce and only comes alive at the last 18 minutes where Bruce fights against a few renowned fighters in his attempt to get at the ultimate evil villain at the top of a pagoda.  The rest of the film barely rises above filler material and you endure it just so you can get to the last 18 minutes; thankfully with this dvd you can now skip ahead.

Great idea, very, very poor execution makes this set highly NOT recommended and you are better off getting the individual movies in a properly restored format preferably with the original spoken languages as well as an option for the dubbed English if you like.  The essential viewing are really the first 3 films and you can add ""Enter the Dragon"" to get the best of Bruce's film work.  Perhaps these four films will be available in restored Blu-ray format soon?  If so, I recommend the wait.",1255132800,,4038,4.557399723374827

1044967,4,6305508534,"Being a fan of Bruce Lee (born Lee Juan Fan in San Francisco in 1940), it's hard not to like this collection with the exception of missing his masterpiece, ""Enter the Dragon"" by Warner Brothers.

This is the original release of Bruce Lee's movies unlike 'compilations' that sell for a fraction of this.  The image quality of the movies is good and it has subtitles.  Each disk is comprised of just the movie.  However, the extra disk ""Bruce Lee: The Legend"" chronicles his life and work on the movies, and even covers a bit of the conspiracy theories that surrounded his death.

The man and his work introduced the Western Culture to the World of Martial Arts on the big screen.  It is no surprise that, even today, his movies excite, entertain, and inspire martial artists (young and old) and movie afficionados.  His work ethic and commitment to his art is evident in these movies.  His movies brought ""Gung Fu"" to the modern day with many of his stories presented in the age of his contemporaries, rather than the more ancient periods of Chinese Warriors.  These works, although superficial in plot, showcased his talents and physical prowess.  We see how the acting and cinematography become more refined as we follow his career.  Each subsequent movie incorporated more and more Western actors, although Jackie Chan is never acknowledged in any of the films (Fist of Fury and Enter the Dragon).  It is interesting that none of the movies in this collection featured his real voice (except for Enter the Dragon, separate from this compilation).

Some of the celebrities in these movies, featured in other Western films, included Bolo Yeung, John Saxon, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Chuck Norris, Colleen Camp, Mel Novak, Jackie Chan (uncredited), Robert Wall and Dan Innosanto.

Just to re-iterate, these movies carry an R-Rating; although, by modern standards, these fit the bill for PG-13.

Overall, this is a no-frills collection of every movie (Minus one).  The documentary was well done and I enjoyed getting insight into this talented, introspective martial artist who passed away at the height of his career.

I am awaiting its release on Bluray, someday.  I hope future releases include 'unreleased footage', interviews and a remastered version.

Despite some limitations, I enjoyed this collection, and give it 4 stars for missing ""Enter the Dragon"".",1238803200,,2355,5.02319587628866

1045048,2,6305508534,"I bought all of the Bruce Lee films on Lasrer Disc years ago.  At that time, it was the only way to get movies in widescreen and at a higher resolution.  I have seen those LD movies so many times and I know what resolution something is.  Fox has put a flim-flam on us.  I bought mine when this set first came out about for(?) years ago.  Once that CBS Fox logo came on the screen, the first thing I said was ""these people got lazy and did not even want to re-master the original films.  Instead the just copyed a LD to DVD because they figure that most fools would not know it.""  I guess they were right.  Some of us do know it.

Just because these were Kong Kong films and considered ""B"" movies, you should still give them some decent treatment.  Even Game of Death II was re-mastered and even given some type of surround sound.  The sound on these is about as horrible as you remeber it from TV.  The picture, I cannot really get happy about it since it is not DVD qulaity.  Many people did not get into LD's or S-VHS for one reason of another(cost being the main factor), so they may be impressed and think that this is Lee on DVD in it's finest quality.  I wonder if we will ever see such quality.  I am hunting down the Asian verison which says that they were indeed re-mastered, you hear Lee's origianl voice AND it is in DTS surround sound.  They give their master the royal treatment, and we give him the ""B"" movie treatment.

I say hunt down the Asian ones.",1097712000,19,1466,4.178571428571429

The picture quality is superb compared to other Lee DVDs, and they come with subtitles, which come in handy when you miss something.
Lee's fighting is, of course, excellent as always. I don't care what my friend says, Jackie Chan could never be a match for Lee, no matter how many household objects he throws at him. Lee doesn't fool around when you throw a lamp at him, he puts his foot through your face.
It's an excellent set for any action movie fan, or anybody who wants to see a master in his medium. Look for the masterful fights in the Colisseum and for foot-knife deflecting antics on the part of Lee. All in all, I give it a solid GROOVY.",1076630400,3,917,4.4
1045050,2,6305508534,"Every couple of years we get a batch of Bruce Lee re-releases, and none of them has ever impressed me.
Thanks to the thoughtless original distributors who had handled the films on their first run in the U.S., American audiences have never been able to get official releases of Bruce Lee's films in their original language.  Even modern companies like Dimension (with their disgraceful dubbing on Jackie Chan's films) have been disrespectful to kung fu films by never including the original dialogue tracks and credit sequences, meaning fans of Bruce Lee will still hear a fourth-rate voice actor on these films rather than Bruce himself.
That was to be expected.  What was not expected was how bad the quality of these transfers was.  I don't know how much work they did in picture restoration or colour timing; judging from the picture quality, my guess would be:  None.  The three Hong Kong films -- Fists of Fury, The Chinese Connection and Return of the Dragon -- have too much contrast and unnatural desaturation, making the characters pasty-faced and the lighting seemingly too dark.  Whether that was the original intent of the filmmakers is unknown, but I know that even the old VHS editions of these films I bought 10 years ago didn't have the number of scratches, bad sprockets and picture jumps I see here.  These *are* letterboxed, (...) though it's small consolation for the number of frozen frames I see before cuts.  Even the Transformers DVD collections have a better restoration job than this, to say nothing of the impressive array of Shaw Brothers films that Celestial Pictures has been releasing.  This set is a disgraceful treatment of the master Bruce Lee's films.
The thoughtlessness continues into the fact that there are absolutely no bonus materials on the DVDs of the films.  No commentary tracks -- it should have been easy enough to get some kung fu film experts here, even if they can't get Raymond Chow, James Tien, Nora Miao, Linda Lee Cadwell or Lee's Hong Kong contemporaries; no trailers (again, an easy dig through the archives); not even film stills or essays.  You just get the film, subdivided into overlarge chapters that don't reflect the structure of the films:  The *entire* Colosseum scene in Return of the Dragon, up until the graveyard scene, is one big chapter.  Are you kidding me?
The documentary Bruce Lee:  The Legend is a curiosity.  While it has some major faults -- the horrible dubbing on Bruce Lee's very early films as a child actor, factual errors and omissions -- it also has a wealth of archival footage that is a joy to behold.  If the DVD distributors had done this kind of homework!  This documentary is definitely worth seeing for Lee fans, though I would tell them to just get this single DVD and skip the rest.
Compared to the Shaw Brothers re-releases and the bonus materials for the excellent DVD edition of Dragon:  The Bruce Lee Story, these DVDs are shameful -- another quickie repackaging of Lee's films for some quick cash, with no thought.  (...) (...)",1070150400,57,3026,4.829457364341085

1045052,3,6305508534,"So, here it is, the latest collection of DVD's featuring all of Bruce Lee's Hong Kong movies (Fists of Fury aka The Big Boss, The Chinese Connection aka Fists of Fury, Return of the Dragon, Game of Death, and an additional documentary Bruce Lee, the Legend) in one pretty package.  Note that Enter the Dragon, made by Warner Brothers and considered by many to be Bruce's finest (and certainly his most polished) film, is not included in this boxed set.  Likewise, the version of Game of Death offered is the original 1977 release, without any of the recently unearthed and restored footage featured in A Warrior's Journey.  Also, these are English-dubbed, edited (for the western market) versions of the films.  All in all though, this is probably the best collection of Bruce's films available in the U.S.
Of course, 30 years after Bruce's death, these movies are a bit campy now -- with Fists of Fury only a few steps up from Sunday afternoon 'action theater' crapola, and Game of Death (pieced together after Bruce's death with an actor double, clips from old movies, and even a cardboard cut-out to make up for his absence in all but the final fight scenes) an unmitigated travesty -- but the charismatic screen presence and fighting skills of Bruce will always satisfy die hard fans (which are the likely target consumer for this boxed set).  After all, you don't really watch this genre of movie for plot, but for the fighting, which was innovative at the time (differing from both the usual chop-sockey shenanigans as well as today's wushu-style 'wire-fu'), and to see the man who started it all and has attained an almost Elvis-level deity status.
Okay, so here's the bad news...  These U.S. Region 1 DVD's pale in comparison to the versions available in Region 2 put out by the Hong Kong Legends company ([...] -- see for yourself).  They have just released a 30th Anniversary boxed set of these movies -- their editions (which can only be viewed on DVD players that can play Region 2 movies) feature the original Cantonese language versions of the movies (as well as the English), the uncut/unedited versions (in which mild nude scenes or corny comedic sequences are left intact), with lots of additional features (critical commentaries and other extras).  There simply isn't any comparison and it is a crying shame these are not available in the U.S. (though apparently some HKL titles are beginning to come to the U.S. market).  Any serious Bruce Lee fan will want the HKL versions instead -- as for me, I'm off to buy a region free DVD player.",1065571200,158,2556,4.777777777777778
1045053,4,6305508534,"There is no denying the fundamental importance of these movies to any fan of action, and now that the price has dropped from the original $54 I can wholeheartedly recommend this version.  Be forewarned, however, that the collection does NOT include Enter the Dragon, due to copyright issues with WB studios (This set is released by 20th Century Fox) and it also does NOT contain the original language dialogue, which was a huge disappointment to me.  The gem of the collection is ""The Chinese Connection"", which shows some fun examples of Bruce expanding his role as an actor as well as a martial artist.  Just as a heads up, this movie, originally released as Fists of Fury in HK, actually has a quality (for HK films of this era) sequel starring Jackie Chan that most people haven't heard of.  Called New Fist of Fury, I thought that this was one of Jackie's better earlier films as well.",1065398400,2,890,4.649681528662421

As a part-time martial artist (Judo, Ju-Jutsu, Karate, Aikido, now Hapkido) for over 10 active years, I despise violence, especially blood shedding and normally don't like R-rated movies. My admiration for Bruce Lee grew thanks to my Ju-Jutsu trainer in the '80s who had cut together the fight scenes for training videos that helped us greatly.",1046390400,4,3152,4.781481481481482
1045160,3,6305508534,"I give this DVD set 3 stars solely because of ""The Game of Death."" The rest of the DVD set gets 5 stars or maybe 6. For those of you who have seen the wonderful documentary ""Bruce Lee: A Warrior's Journey"" you will be sorely disappointed in this cheap studio rip off of what Bruce Lee intended ""The Game of Death"" to be. They cut out a good 30 minutes of quality Bruce Lee footage, and totally changed the story. The 5 level pagoda becomes a restaurant! What a load of crap. Bruce Lee's movies always have a underlying message of truth, and ""The Game of Death"" was supposed to have one also (see the above mentioned documentary for details), but because the stupid movie studio decided to change the entire plot and theme of the movie after Bruce Lee's untimely death, that underlying message is missing... in short, ""The Game of Death"" is a disgrace to Bruce Lee.

Well, now that I have that off my chest, the rest of the DVD is unbelievable. Some don't like the cheesy dubbing (the movies were made in China for a Chinese audience), but I think that is all part of the charm of the classic Bruce Lee movies. I watched the other 4 DVDs with a huge smile on my face the entire time. In the end, I do recommend this DVD set wholeheartedly.",1041206400,36,1238,4.313304721030043

Who cares about ""Game of Death"" because a stand-in who looks nothing like the god takes up a lot of screen time. Terrible. Bruce Lee kicks major ... in the other movies. He beats up guys on a rich guy's yard, smacks bad guys in the face with nunchuks and a fat Italian guy who looks like somebody I know. ""You know what Chinese spare ribs are?"" Comicality. Bruce Lee is an ultimate god after defeating hairy beast Norris and jolly black giant Jabbar! Too much to handle for those mortals.

He was a fanatic who developed his one style of martial arts after studying numerous other....but he had only one formal teacher-Grandmaster YipMan of the Wing chun system. {Bruce eventually taught his teacher his new found teckniques.}
 As far as this collection-they could've added special features, but the company felt it wouldnt've made anymore profit from this. It didn't matter that his fans missed out. The company that put out Warriors Journey-the documetary that features ""Game of Death"" uncut wanted to work with fox video to add all the footage into the movie-there is another 20 minutes of bruce fighting that has never been seen! They said no. There is a DVD put out in Asia by ""Media Asia"" of Chinese connection-AKA Fist of Fury in Asia that is far suppior to the american version-it features tons of extras,3 dubbed languages[including english] Bruce actually dubbed the voice of the Russian bad guy on the chinese track-very cool to hear!!

The films could have been released in the original language with english subtitles, and had a second audio track for the dubbed english versions.  This is so easy to do with DVDs that it's a crime the manufacturer did not do this.  Here was an opportunity to really do these movies justice and all they did was copy the films onto disk.

1045166,5,6305508534,"This DVD set was already released (why are they getting it so late?) But anway this DVD collection is about a master, a master of the Martial Arts, his name is Bruce Lee. Bruce Lee was born in San Francisco in 1940 but would be raised in China, later on his parents would give him a crisp 100 dollar bill and would send him on his way back to San Francisco. Bruce Lee would learn various Martial Arts in China and would utilize them in his films. Bruce would go back to China to film ALL these movies in this collection (their all in english but with different vioice actors, the orginal movies were in Chineese). Then Bruce would get his big brake in 1972 when hollywood would start work on ""Enter the Dragon"" (not included in this collection, ashame, it would have completed it). Bruce would film this with multiple hollywood sensations but he would never get to see it in theaters although he WOUDLD see a full version of it just before he died of a odd brain reaction to a head medicine he took that night. Some people say Bruce is a poser, some say hes not a good actor, well i say forget what they say. Bruce is the man, next to me ;).",1021766400,,1141,4.238532110091743
1045167,4,6305508534,"This Warner Brothers set is very good-I bought it, but it's annoying that these discs are not anamorphic and you don't get the original soundtrack. However, if you are a Bruce Lee fanatic, and you have a PAL converter, and a multiregion dvd player that can play Region 2 discs, you must get the Hong Kong Legends releases. This is a UK company. They put out the four Bruce Lee films, minus Enter the Dragon, in beautiful, restored, remastered, anamorphic widescreen versions with Dolby Digital sound. This is heaven for people with widescreen TVs. They are loaded with extras(Game of Death has 2 dvds!) and also have several soundtracks so you can watch the original Chinese with English subtitles, or the English dubbed version. It's amazing, but Region 2 really outdid Region 1 in this case. You can buy them from Amazon.com.uk.  Hong Kong Legends has a website that lists all their releases, including many Jackie Chan and Jet Li films, all made to the same high standards.",1003881600,38,976,4.809523809523809

Essentially you just get fine copies of Bruce's classic kung fu movies along with the documentary except ENTER THE DRAGON which is owned by Warner Brothers. The DVDs do not come with the original chinese audio , and it comes with no DVD extras. All you get are the films and nothing but the films. Picture quality has been enhanced and the movies come with subtitles but the sound remains mono. The discs come in a terrific looking 5 disc jewel case that is chocked with pictures from the films in a slip cover case.
The films are nicely divided up into chapters from 14 to 24 chapters.
Personally , I wished that Fox could have added some DVD extras to these disc like the original chinese audio. DVD extras are the only things that these discs are really missing. Outside of that it is a nice collection of Bruce Lee's classic Hong Kong kung fu films. Buy the special edition of ""Enter The Dragon"" from Warner Brothers (which has some DVD extras that are terrific) and add it to this collection and you'll TRUELY own a master collection.",1002672000,13,1289,4.48936170212766

ENTER the damn DRAGON is a BRUCE LEE MOVIE. If all of his films aren't COLLECTED it's not a collection. You can skip all of the pretty packaging and Booklets. I just want all of his films together. That may be a problem as far as the movie studios see it. Couldn't they settle their differences for the consumers sake. I sold my so called collection to a friend of mine a day after I purchased it. I didn't realize it was incomplete. I guess I should read the boxes before I buy my next COLLECTION. I can buy each DVD seperately and save money. Especially if the quality difference isn't that noticable. One of these DVD's isn't even an actual film. It's a documentary.

Buy this collection out of respect for him, not because it does or doesn't come in Dolby Digital 5.1 (TM) and your big screen HDTV doesn't bring out the best of the films.  I'll watch these movies on a 19 inch TV and still enjoy them.  The dubbed voices are a key element in old school martial art films transfered to English.

1045236,4,6305508534,"Just got my copy of the Bruce Lee Master Collection - great packaging, really feels like a collection, with a wide, gatefold sleeve revealing 5 matching discs. However, having read the other reviews, many of which excitedly refer to the wonderful quality of the image and sound, I was itching to get these discs on, with my big screen TV and AC-3 sound system. Having bought and enjoyed Enter the Dragon, remastered and with Dolby Digital 5.1 sound, I was expecting more of the same. However, despite an adequate picture and sound, the audio/visual quality comes nowhere close to Enter the Dragon. The picture quality beats the pants off the old VHS tapes, and improves slightly from Fist of Fury through to Game of Death, but doesn't really live up to the hype of the other reviews. The dubbed sound, mono in all cases, is disappointing after reading the reviews, with the tinny music and voices that always seem too high or too low for their characters. Let's face it, the oldest of this movies is 30 years old, and some of the previous VHS/DVD releases have been [really bad], so by all means let's celebrate the fact that we can get good prints of these seminal movies in one boxed set but let's not kid ourselves that the picture is sharp and clear and the sound rings honest and true. Fox had done a good job, sure, but Enter the Dragon this ain't, and we shouldn't expect it to be. Don't get me wrong - this is a must have for Bruce Lee fans, but buy it for the right reasons - to get hold all Bruce's HK movies in one go. There are Collector's Editions of Fists, Way/Return of the Dragon and Game of Death (the last being a 2-disc set available in October) available on Region 2, with remastered anamorphic images, DD 5.1 sound and bundles of extras.

The picture quality in Fists of Fury is awfull! the American 'John Wayne' voice dubbing for Bruce was even worse. I would have rather had the option to read subtitles and hear the original chinese soundtrack.

Summary: Don't buy this. I would recommend finding a Chinese release of these movies with a English subtitle or waiting for the set to be re-done, because this set doesn't even begin to match the quality that Bruce Lee deserves.",998956800,5,669,4.575

It has Fists of Fury, Chinese Connection (which has the best nunchaku scenes in my opinion), Return of the Dragon, and Game of Death (which really only the ending has Bruce Lee in original footage.  If you look close you'll notice alot of other scenes are taken from other movies when Bruce Lee is actually Bruce Lee).
Considering it lacks Enter the Dragon which was probably Bruce Lee's best movie.  And that none of the movies have extra features or the original chinese audio tracks, I stil give this box set a 4!  I think it is an excellent buy!",998092800,,684,4.432

There are some faults, Way of the Dragon (aka Return of the Dragon ) lacks Bruce's original battle cries and is repitively dubbed which is a great pity as this is always an essential part of Bruce's performance. However, you people with multi region DVD players should consider this a bargain. In addition, you will see Game of Death with 2 extra fight scenes ( including the Dan Inasanto nanchuka fight with Bruce) and NOT just the Hakim fight- ever wondered why Inasanto was shown on the credits at the start and never featured in the film again?. February 19th 2000 sees the release of Fist of Fury in the uk UNCUT for the first time. These Homg Kong Films releases will be just as significant in that they contain the original cantonese soundtrack, commentaries, trailers and are fully remastered. If you want the ULTIMATE edition these are essential purchases. Will Way of the Dragon be uncut????? time will tell. Let's hope that the UK can finally see these films( and hear them) the way they were meant to be. if you are a fan, you will buy both the Fox box set and the region 2 releases on hong Kong films because you can't wait BUT you also want ALL those lovely extras that these films deserve.

Then you start  to cry.. realizing that the Master collection, although a wonderful gift  from God, is not the ""MASTER COLLECTIONN,"" but basically the one  nobody would buy if there was a true ""MASTER COLLECTION"" with  ""ENTER THE freakin' DRAGON"" in it. I would love to give this box  a five, but I have to give it a 3, because ME and BRUCE are so upset that  so many people got tricked and now have to buy a sith disc. He was a man of  honor...
