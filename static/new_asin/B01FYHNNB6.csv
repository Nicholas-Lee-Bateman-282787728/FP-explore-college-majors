8761822,5,B01FYHNNB6,"This disc, recorded at the Annecy Festival in 2014, offers strikingly clear HD imaging and realistically balanced sound presented in PCM stereo only. This is in marked contrast to the previous years recording that had serious problems of balance within the orchestra as well as dynamic restriction in climatic moments as well as suffering from visual distractions in the backgrounds.

None of those issues are present on this new recording which has successfully addressed all of those previous deficiencies. The lack of any form of surround sound is the only drawback to what is otherwise a rewarding pair of concerts. Collectors should know that there will not be a Blu-ray version as Euroarts have found that sales of Blu-rays do not justify the extra cost of production.

The two concerts are really quite a contrast beyond the obvious differences of program content. The first showcases Denis Matsuev as the soloist in Liszts Piano Concerto 2 and the Totentanz. The encore is Lyadovs Musical Snuffbox and not the Shchedrin Elgie as listed on the box and final credits. Matsuev is the Artistic Director of the Festival and rises to the occasion in spectacular fashion.

The concerto is given a performance of some striking flexibility in terms of rubato and more marked tempi fluctuation. This brings, despite much spectacular virtuosity, an emphasis on the lyrical aspects of the work. This gives the impression of several sections of the concerto being, in effect, extended song. This amounts to a highly rewarding musical rebalancing and uncommonly intriguing.

Totentanz, on the other hand, is delivered as an out and out virtuoso display piece with fairly violent extremes of tempo chosen for maximum thrill. The visual astonishment created by images of machine-gun-like repeated note figurations and flashing scale work is underpinned by frequent expressions of joy with a smiling enthusiasm that makes all of this seem like childs play for the pianist. This is simply an astonishing display. Fortunately the orchestra under the guidance of Zoltan Kocsis is fully up to the various challenges.

The Lyadov Musical Snuffbox encore item is a complete contrast requiring pianism of extreme gentleness and with a touch of humour as the snuffbox gradually winds down. This piece explores exclusively the upper reaches of the piano and is greeted with an amused murmur of appreciation by the otherwise rapt audience. This replaces the listed Shchedrin Elgie.

The second concert given by the St. Petersburg Philharmonic, but this time conducted by their main director Yuri Temirkanov, also has a small change of program with Elgars Salut Damour not being played. The string orchestra version of the Schubert Moment Musicaux OP. 94 No. 3 however proves to be a definitive example of taste in both the piece and the performance. It offers a perfect conclusion to intriguingly thoughtful concert consisting of two sets of musical portraits.

The Mussorgsky Pictures at an Exhibition, here presented in the usual Ravel orchestration, is unusually thoughtful with less emphasis upon display and more emphasis upon subtleties of phrasing and musical content. Consequently many of the tempi are slower than expected and some are quicker. The Gnomes and Tuileries are sedate in their depiction for example but the oxcart in Bydlo is unusually lightly laden and is almost sprightly in its travel. The Catacombs offer contrasts without extremes of volume and the Great Gate of Kiev is not allowed to become laboriously imposing.

The Elgar Enigma has one unusual characteristic in the delivery that underlines its variation construction rather than its continuous nature. That characteristic is the clear separation of each variation with a gap being made between each one. This is in complete contrast with more regular performances where pauses between variations are reduced to the point where the whole set of variations is played more as a continuous stream of sound. In the current performance one is made aware of the separate nature of each variation rather than of the unity of the whole. The orchestra plays with skill and commitment although it is likely that they are less familiar with the work than with the Mussorgsky Pictures.

This disc offers outstanding pianism from Matsuev and heads an intriguingly thoughtful orchestral concert.",1471219200,,4344,5.2298850574712645
