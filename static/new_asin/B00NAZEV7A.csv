8677058,5,B00NAZEV7A,"I've never thought I would dance Tango! Thanks to those dancing shows on TV, I've always wanted to learn how to dance, especially this classic, but passionate dance - Tango. I'm a complete beginner to dancing simply because I unfortunately don't have much sense for dancing at all. But I decided to give this instructional video a try and I didn't regret!",1420329600,4,355,4.741935483870968
8677059,5,B00NAZEV7A,"I've been trying to get my partner into dancing with me, and got this DVD to try out. Everything is super clear. The tutorial escalates from basic baby steps to the cool beautiful moves you see in movies. I'm really satisfied with how everything was explained clearly; you get the simple how-to part, followed by the chance to dance along to the music. I definitely recommend though watching it first with your partner or friend, and then trying it out, just so you can follow it more easily as it goes.

I think Tango is an immortal dance, and will do partners well to learn! Overall, dancing is a beautiful and graceful form of art, and like the saying goes, it's never too late to learn something new",1412294400,5,703,4.4921875
