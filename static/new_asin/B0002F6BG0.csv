8027600,2,B0002F6BG0,Very boring movie. They had too many stories about gay men and not enough about gay women. Did not like it.,1402185600,,107,4.142857142857143
8027601,5,B0002F6BG0,"I watched this on PBS last night and found it charming, informative and hard to forget.  Some PBS programs on gay lifestyle are uncomfortable to watch but this does not go beyond polite conversations with couples in long term relationships.  There is a wide range, including younger, older, childless, family groups, men and women.  While I know of the legal issues this program makes the dificulties very real as you see their children, parents and a couple aging partners dealing with the threats of no legal protection for their bond.  I will probably order this for our collection.",1087344000,11,585,4.938775510204081
