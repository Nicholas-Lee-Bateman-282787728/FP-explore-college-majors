2927923,5,B000UZPMBW,"I loved this movie.  The concept that the last person to die on New Year's Eve has to drive the death cart for the next year is great!  As with any Criterion movie, the video and audio are great!  The director got great performances from his actors, especially the lead actor...himself.  If you like silent movies, get this one.",1332979200,,328,4.508474576271187
2927924,5,B000UZPMBW,"Excellent tale of ""appreciate what you've got or you may lose it!""  There are so many touching and bitter moments in this film and Victor Sjostrom not only masterfully portrays the lead character but delivers an astounding example of what good direction should be.  He even influenced Ingmar Bergman with this one.  Can you imagine?  Well worth 5 stars and beyond.  Definition and special effects are wonderful considering it was filmed in 1920.  This film really pokes my soul.  I'll not forget it.",1327017600,2,499,4.9397590361445785
2927925,4,B000UZPMBW,"A psychological film that probes into the mental anguish and misery of a character, ""The Phantom Carriage"" is a film that inspired filmmakers such as Ingmar Bergman but also a film that would be the precursor of Bergman's probe into the psyche of his characters throughout his oeuvre.

""The Phantom Carriage"" (Krkarlen) is a silent film from 1921 that is a film adaptation of the novel ""They Soul Shall Bear Witness!"" by Nobel-prize winning Swedish author Selma Lagerlf (the first female writer to win the prize and is best known for her children's book ""The Wonderful Adventures of Nils"").

The film would be directed by Victor Sjstrm who would also play the lead role of the film.

Known for directing films in the U.S. during the 1920's, it's unfortunate that for a talented filmmaker and actor, the majority of his films are considered as lost.  Fortunately, those that did survive are his film adaptations of Lagerlf novels such as the ""Sons of Ingmar"" (1919), ""Karin, Daughter of Ingmar"" (1920) and ""The Phantom Carriage"" (1921).  The latter which received restoration courtesy of the Archival Film Collections of the Swedish Film Institute.

And now, ""The Phantom Carriage"" will receive its HD treatment on Blu-ray and also standard DVD release courtesy of the Criterion Collection.

VIDEO:

""The Phantom Carriage"" is presented in  High Definition, tinted color and the fact that earlier versions that many people have watched this in the past were not in the greatest condition and considering the fact that the original film elements were not fully complete, I was quite amazed to see how beautiful this film looked on Blu-ray.

The film also utilized double exposures made in the camera but used in a greater form for the film in order to create the ghost characters.  A very challenging special effect for its time.

Presented as a color-tinted silent film, ""The Phantom Carriage"" on Blu-ray is the best version of the film to date.  Is it pristine?  The answer is no.  You can see occasional white specks, hairs or tears on the original film element, flickering but with that being said, none of these will ruin one's viewing of the film.  In fact, the fact that it's complete, not hindered by any nitrate composition or any degradation, for a film that is 90-years-old, if you are a silent film fan, you can't help but be appreciative that the film look so good and that the Criterion Collection has chosen to release this film on Blu-ray.

According to the Criterion Collection, the restoration of ""The Phantom Carriage"" was undertaken by the Archival Film Collections of the Swedish Film Institute.  A new film master was created from two source elements, an incomplete black-and-white nitrate print with Swedish intertitles and an incomplete color-tinted nitrate with print with English intertitles.  From these source elements, a new black-and-white duplicate negative with Swedish intertitles was completed in 1975.  New 35 mm polyester viewing prints were then struck from this restored negative, using the color-tinted nitrate print as a color reference.

Criterion Collection also pointed out that the new digital transfer was created on an ARRISCAN film scanner in 2K resolution from the new duplicate negative, at the Chimney Pot in Stokcholm, using the same color-tinted print from the Swedish Film Institute as reference.  Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, warps, jitter and flicker were manually removed using MTI's DRS system and Pixel Farm's PFClean system while Digital Vision's Phoenix system was used for small dirt, grain and noise reduction.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""The Phantom Carriage "" is presented with two scores.  One by Swedish composer Matti Bye and the other by the experimental duo KTL.

The original 1998 Matti Bye composition used on this Blu-ray release  is absolutely beautiful.  Presented in DTS-HD MA, the music with its piano, horns and strings does a great job of enhancing my appreciation of the film.  The music is coordinated just right to the scenes of the film and for the most part, is a wonderful score which sounds great via lossless.

As for the KTL soundtrack is presented in LPCM 2.0 and the experimental music makes this film feel quite dark and menacing.  It stays that way throughout the whole film and the sound is quite eery.  The score of course is subjective to the listener but listening to the score and watching the film, it gives you the feel of a horror film.

So, overall, I preferred the Matti Bye soundtrack because it is more emotional and upbeat compared to the KTL experimental score.

The film is presented with Swedish intertitles in English and special features with English subtitles.

JUDGMENT CALL:

We often hear from filmmakers in America who talk about the American filmmakers and films that inspired them to pursue a career in the industry.

In Sweden, filmmaker Ingmar Bergman who was only a 1-year-old when ""The Phantom Carriage"" came out, would later become inspired by Victor Sjstrm's work and how his exploration of the human psyche, their melancholy, a character being miserable and the emotional pain that they harbor inside..these are things that are a big part of Bergman's oeuvre.

As Bergman is known as the filmmaker to capture human suffering, for Bergman it began with Victor Sjstrm who would go on to introduce his style of filmmaking in America and showcase the mental anguish of a person in ""He Who Gets Slapped"" (1924), ""The Scarlet Letter"" (1926) and ""The Wind"" (1928).  And while many historians have always recommended Sjstrm's ""The Wind"" (as it is one of Lillian Gish's finest acting performances), ""The Phantom Carriage"" was definitely a film which is a product of its time that does have its relevance today.

We have seen how alcoholism affected a person, especially a father and his family in film.  This is nothing new.  But in 1921, alcoholism was never fully explored, nor its ramifications.  Tuberculosis is still a problem today, but even moreso back then.  It was a bold film to take on such a subject of how an alcoholic can hurt his family and others, but also lead to one's death.  And yes, there is a little introduction to how those who submitted to God have changed for the best, but for those who frown upon preachy religious films, this is not one of them.

If anything, one can easily call this a psychological thriller mixed with drama.  The film for its time can be seen as dark as it showcased human suffering and interesting enough, Stanley Kubrick's film ""The Shining"" which has a famous axe scene is quite similar to the axe scene found in this film.  Granted, this is not a horror film but compared to other silent horror films that I have seen (which are not too scary), I can only imagine how audiences reacted when they first watched this film.  It's definitely not a happy upbeat film but it does manage to work itself out in the end and I guess, one can say the film is not all tragic.

There are life changing moments and for the most part, ""The Phantom Carriage"" is a pre-cursor of the human suffering type of films that Victor Sjstrm would create several years later and a theme that would have its impact on Ingmar Bergman's work.

So, ""The Phantom Carriage"" does have its place as an important film not only to Swedish cinema but also for its darker theme that was not as prevalent in 1921.  But as many people are discovering Ingmar Bergman's films through the new releases on Blu-ray and DVD from the Criterion Collection, the company has been good in showing films in which these filmmakers were inspired from.

So, this is one important film that fans of Bergman's work can really enjoy.  So, as Jean Renoir and Jean Vigo were an inspiration to future French filmmakers, Victor Sjstrm was the same as he inspired Swedish filmmakers, specifically Ingmar Bergman.  And for Bergman, he had watched this film over 100 times and has said that from the first time he had watched the film, he would eventually watch it every year since then.

""The Phantom Carriage"" was a big impact on his life and to know Bergman's work and why he is so enamored with human suffering, you need to look past Bergman and watch a Victor Sjstrm film.

""The Phantom Carriage"" is recommended!",1323993600,11,9189,4.936197916666667
2927926,5,B000UZPMBW,"Swedish director Victor Sjostrom's THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE (1921), while not as popularly known today as other masterworks from the era, is nonetheless as important to the development of cinema as are any of those more famous films.

The last person to die on New Year's Eve before the stroke of midnight must drive Death's chariot, collecting the souls of those who die throughout the next year. Sjostrom himself plays David, an abusive alcoholic who becomes the chariot rider's successor and is shown the harm and misery he brought to others.

THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE is an atmospheric masterpiece. Told in what was then an innovative flashback format, the film utilizes double and even multiple exposures in ways previously unseen to simulate the spectral, horse driven carriage and its doomed rider. The film is also noteworthy for some of the earliest night for night photography ever attempted in a motion picture. This remarkably moving parable of a film was a huge influence on the work of Ingmar Bergman, especially THE SEVENTH SEAL and WILD STRAWBERRIES, both from 1957.

Criterion's exceptional Blu-ray was transferred from a restored duplicate negative derived from two prints; a black and white nitrate and a color tinted nitrate. Two optional scores are included; a chamber orchestral work and an experimental, computer composition. The special features give us an absorbing commentary by historian Casper Tybjerg, a 1981  interview with Ingmar  Bergman, an essay by Peter Cowie on the film's influence on Bergman, some footage of the construction of Rasunda studio where THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE was shot, and a booklet by Paul Mayersberg discussing the film's importance.

As usual, Criterion has done a beautiful job in putting this edition together, and it does ample justice to an extraordinary film that deserves wider recognition. Its haunting quality is unforgettable.",1320192000,7,1880,5.291946308724833
2927927,4,B000UZPMBW,"I would only recommend this film for lovers of silent cinema, quite groundbreaking in it's day the film still holds up especially with the addition of the experimental soundtrack which I found to suit the film a bit more than it's original orchestrated score.
I really enjoyed it!",1319328000,3,280,4.854166666666667
2927928,5,B000UZPMBW,"It delights me no end that Victor Sjostrom's THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE is finally getting a Region 1 release and from Criterion no less. I have had the Region 2 version of this for a few years (complete with mislabeled discs) but now I will be able to enjoy the additional extra supplements that Criterion offers. Since it is also being offered in Blu-Ray I can assume that it has a digital upgrade from my release which is from the Swedish Film Institute and was already a decent restoration although I confess that I didn't care much for the modern KTL score. In my opinion, the Matti Bye score suits the material better. An improved English subtitle translation is always a plus as well. KORKARLEN, the film's original title and the name of the book it is taken from, translates as ""The Coach Driver"" and is an accurate description as the carriage and driver appear throughout and are the key symbol on which the plot hinges.

THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE is one of those silent movies to show people who think they don't like silent movies. I have yet to meet someone that I have shown it to who was not captivated by it. Part of that is due to the similarity of the plot to a well known English property which I won't name here but a lot of it is due to the simple but creative special effects that seem perfectly natural in keeping with the story being told. Credit should also be given to the lead performances of Victor Sjostrom and Hilda Borgstrom which seem as contemporary as anything seen today. It's easy to see why Ingmar Bergman would have been attracted to and inspired by this story of a vicious alcoholic who receives his comeuppance and an unexpected shot at redemption. The dysfunctional family theme, long a staple of Scandinavian drama, also plays well today. A surprising movie that still has the power to engage and enthrall audiences 90 years later.",1313193600,31,1861,4.588588588588588
2927929,5,B000UZPMBW,"I saw The Phantom Carriage on TCM not too long ago and was enthralled. This movie is one of the gems of silent cinema, and for American audiences it's still mainly an unseen gem. I hope this Criterion release will change that. The print quality is superb; even with higher-contrast orthochromatic film there is good tonal range in this restoration. This is a boon because the lighting is often subtle. I'm not familiar with the source material, but the way Sjostrom directs his actors makes me wish he'd done a silent adaptation of Crime and Punishment; The Silent Carriage is a Dostoevskyan drama that turns the protagonist's soul inside out. It's a masterpiece of direction and restrained acting, and makes me appreciate again the sophistication Scandinavian film-makers brought to the early development of the motion picture.",1312329600,47,828,5.095588235294118
2927930,5,B000UZPMBW,"**EDIT 9-27-11** The overall quality of the Blu-ray is fair, not quite as good as I had originally hoped, but it's still decent. As with most silents, the tell-tale signs of aging are still present even after the restoration, mainly age spots and vertically running scratches. But don't let this discourage you from purchasing this silent masterpiece. Although it's not perfect, Criterion still did a good job on the restoration (as they normally do) and the overall quality is better than previous versions that I've viewed.

The Phantom Carriage is a silent Swedish film made by legendary actor/director Victor Sj&ouml;str&ouml;m. While Sj&ouml;str&ouml;m is known more for his acting performances later in life, namely as the protagonist in Ingmar Bergman's Wild Strawberries, he originally made his mark as a prolific and very innovative director, beginning in the silent era and spanning into early talkies. This film is considered by many to be one of his very best and is a perfect example of how Sj&ouml;str&ouml;m both pioneered and refined techniques that were used for decades to come.

The film uses double exposures quite extensively. While this technique was not new, for this film it was far more advanced, consisting of multiple layers and dimensions. While the techniques may seem obvious and even primitive by today's standards, they left audiences awed and mesmerized 90 years ago. Another innovation of this film is the unique structure in which it's told. This is one of the first movies to make extensive use of flashbacks, going as far as having flashbacks within flashbacks.

I will briefly cover the plot, as to not ruin the film for someone who has never seen it before. The film opens on a dark and depressing New Year's Eve with a young Salvation Army sister named Edit lying on her deathbed. Her last wish is to see David Holm, an alcoholic she had tried to help the previous New Year's Eve. David promised Edit that he would return on this very day to show her if her prayers for him had been answered. Since he has yet to arrive, someone is sent to find him before it's too late. David (portrayed by Sj&ouml;str&ouml;m) is found in a local cemetery with two of his drinking buddies recalling a legend told to them by their friend Georges. The legend states that the last person to die each year has to work the following year for Death collecting souls from the dead. The irony is that after telling the legend, Georges himself died on New Year's Eve. David and his friends are drinking and laughing until an altercation occurs, leading to David's accidental death right before the stroke of midnight. His soul steps out of his body right before Death's carriage arrives revealing Georges as its driver. From here the story has a Dickens-like feel as Georges drives David around in the carriage showing him the mistakes he's made via flashbacks. The rest of the story shall remain unspoiled. . . I hope you enjoy it as much as I have over the years.

The Phantom Carriage, based on the novel ""Thy Soul Shall Bear Witness!"" (K&ouml;rkarlen) by Nobel-prize winning author Selma Lagerl&ouml;f, is an example of a somewhat modernized version of the old right vs. wrong morality tales. The main message in the film is to show how problems, such as alcoholism, can completely destroy someones life, but with a little faith and guidance, salvation is always attainable. In this, and many of his other films, Sj&ouml;str&ouml;m so masterfully shows the problems he saw within society, and the impact they could have on us if not resolved. . .

2927932,5,B000UZPMBW,"I have had this film on my wish list for a couple of years.  I finally purchased it, watched it, and then asked myself why I waited so long to get this.  Victor Seastrom was an amazing director/film-maker, I am slowly discovering, and his ability to convey incredible pathos in his films is outstanding.

The plot is briefly outlined in the synopsis, but basically it centers around an alcoholic, gambling, former family man, named David Holm (portrayed by V.S. himself).  Legend says that whoever is the last to die on New Year's Eve must take the reins of Death's chariot and spend the next year collecting the souls of all who pass on.  This is not seen as a privilege or an honor, more like a condemnation or punishment.  David is indeed the ""lucky winner"", and as the chariot comes to get him, he meets the former driver, named Georges, who was his friend in life.  The bulk of the story is told in flashbacks, as David looks back and reflects on his life.  There are, of course, a lot more details to the story than this, but I will stop here.  This is a great, mesmerizing tale of one man's journey in death to seek redemption for his life.

I mentioned before Seastrom's sense of pathos-- this is most heavily seen in his performance as David, and the performance of the actress who portrayed Syster (Sister) Edyt, and the general interactions between characters.  There is also great use of light/shadow to convey mood.  The music score by Matti Bye is great. There are places where the music is very strange at times, but it actually fits the scene very well.  The music adds much to the overall feel of the film as well.

The film is color tinted mostly in blue (at night), pink, and sepia.  Criterion has done a wonderful job on restoring this.  There are a few blemishes here and there, but nothing that hinders the experience.  Overall, the picture is incredibly clear and easy to watch. The special effects are actually quite good for the time (1921). The intertitles are in Swedish, and English subtitles appear below them.

If you enjoy silent films, try this one.  I found it extremely interesting and just all-around very well done.  Any movie that I continue to think about long after it is over gets an A in my book.",1468022400,,2237,4.545

2927935,5,B000UZPMBW,"This double bill gives you both a true classic of silent cinema, and a little known, but very interesting tele-film by Ingmar Bergman dramatising the story of the creator of ""The Phantom Carriage'.

Phanton Carriage - This Swedish silent is said to be Ingmar  Bergmans favorite film, and the movie that made him want to be a director. You can certainly see its influence of Bergmans work, as well as on a famous Stanley Kubrick sequence.  But beyond that, this is a very strong silent film on its own merits.  Echoing Dickens A Christmas Carol , but using a Swedish ghost fable as its core, a man is forced to revisit his wasted angry life at the moment of his death.

The dramatic structure is surprisingly complex, with flashbacks within flashbacks.  The acting is generally very good.  There are a few of those over the top silent film acting moments, but there are also moments of tremendous emotional power just from the look in someones eyes.  And some of the images are just thrilling, with simple superimpositions creating a tremendously effective, creepy, ghostly mood.  Great use of color tinting as well.  The modern orchestral score by Matti Bye -- included on just about all DVD and blu-ray versions is very strong  melodic, moving, never distracting, but certainly doing a great job of underlying the many many emotions of the film, without ever feeling corny or faux-period.  A fascinating and beautifully made silent that certainly had its effect on great 20th century filmmaking and film-makers.

The Image Makers - More a staged play for television than a film, this is wordy theatrical, and yet still has a lot of arresting moments.  A fictionalized dramatization of the making of The Phantom Carriage Bergmans favorite film, a film he reportedly saw over 100 times, and was what prompted him to be a film-maker.  Yet the play (not written by Bergman) is less about that specific film than a host of other themes; relationships, the adaptation of literature to film in general, generational conflict, women and mens sexualities as they age, the tension between social propriety and the desire to cast off bourgeois trappings among artists, etc.

Just four characters populate this world.  The self-satisfied yet vulnerable film-maker creating The Image Maker, his somewhat subservient director of photography, the young, unapologetically promiscuous actress the director has an affair with, and the 60 something Nobel prize wining female author whose story is the basis for the film.  Almost the entire piece takes place in a screening room as they prepare to show the great author this cinematic reinvention of her work, but along the way the group gets broken into various twos and threes working out their own insecurities and emotional and philosophical confusions.  While far from great Bergman, its always interesting, and the context of being packaged with 'The Phantom Carriage'  gives it an additional resonance and depth.",1454371200,,2950,5.055785123966942

2927944,4,B000UZPMBW,"If you'd ever been in Sweden, maybe you'd heard the locals trying to drum up scare with the urban myth about the phantom carriage. Word to the wise, take care on New Year's Eve. For the last soul to perish on New Year's Eve must drive Death's carriage and collect and transport newly expired souls. And in this supernatural office, a single night is as long as a hundred years on Earth. The Phantom Carriage (originally titled Krkarlen or ""Driver"") fleshes out this tale of doom.

It's a Swedish silent motion picture from 1921 and provides English sub-titles for those who prefer it that way. ""Once there was a poor Salvation Army sister at death's door,"" the title card kicks it off. And so we meet Sister Edit (Astrid Holm) on New Year's Eve, moments away from gasping her last, wracked with the galloping consumption (or if you prefer Doogie Howser's terminology: ""tuberculosis""). Her one dying wish is to see one last time this guy, David Holm. Cue the hue and cry and the search for David Holm. Only, he can't be found.

It's because David Holm is hanging out at the cemetery with his drinking cronies. David Holm is, without a doubt, a mean drunkard and a stone-cold reprobate. It's here that David regales his homies with that one ghost story. Comes the local bobby to inform him of the dying sister's request and David's heartless refusal and his kinder cronies trying to convince him to go. There's a scuffle and there's David Holm on the ground, his head bashed in. And there's the stroke of midnight. And there's the spooky carriage come rolling up.

Raise your hand if you know who Victor Sjstrm is. If you only recognize him as the old man in Ingmar Bergman's Wild Strawberries, then you're doing him a disservice. Victor Sjstrm, who may have abused his limit of the usage of the umlaut, was a noted Swedish director as well as the occasional actor. Other than Wild Strawberries, his most celebrated work has to be The Phantom Carriage, a fantasy film groundbreaking enough that Bergman lifted the image of Death for The Seventh Seal. Heck, it may even have inspired that door-chopping scene in Kubrick's The Shining. The special effects here are spectacular for its time, the specters' transparent effects realized thru meticulous double exposures made in the camera.

Sjstrm proves that he's capable in front of - as well as behind - the camera. He etches with great expressiveness a character that is reprehensible and lost and, frankly, hard to like. It's a film rife with flashback sequences, and, thanks to these comprehensive jump cuts down memory lane, we're made privy to the tragic events that transformed David Holm from decent family man to uncaring scoundrel to conveyer of souls. This movie isn't for everyone. It's as much a melancholy character study as it is a haunting supernatural narrative. Can David Holm find it in himself to be redeemed?

2927947,5,B000UZPMBW,"THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE (1921) This is a dark morality play that can't
help but bring thoughts of A Christmas CAROL to mind yet there is no
happy ending. Directed & lead acted by Victor Sjostrom the man that
inspired Ingmar Bergman to become a director it is a Swedish folktale
as were many Swedish movies of the time. It revolves around the story
of a relationship between a Salvation Army Worker (female) & her
attempt to help an alcoholic bum who only has negative affects on the
lives of those around him. It's a truly dark movie in all aspects with
hard lessons for everyone. Intentions are definitely shown here but the
story is about actual effects.

The FX of the carriage itself are startling & better than you'd believe
for such an early movie. My copy was a Criterion Edition & I can only
recommend that restoration as I've seen no other. This is a 10/10 for
me. It is available in Criterion Blu-Ray also & is 107 mins long, which
is the full original Swedish version. English subtitles are included.

2927951,5,B000UZPMBW,"There's simply no way to reduce this film to a category.

Perhaps the best reference point to use in explaining what this film is and does is to compare it to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Seventh-Seal/dp/B001WLMOG4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Seventh Seal</a>, the Ingmar Bergman classic that was heavily inspired by this work that predated it by more than thirty years.  Both films use the supernatural as a strange and stylistic vehicle for conveying a morality tale about average, ordinary existence.  In both cases, an embodiment of death provides an opportunity for reckoning and, ultimately, redemption for the everyman.

And, in both cases, while the visuals are delicious in their execution, the direction and camerawork remain restrained, never showing off for the sake of showing off, and never delighting in the supernatural for the sheer sake of spectacle.  These are films about the everyman, his sins and his divinity.  In the Phantom Carriage, director Victor Sjstrm (also starring in the film) never allows the film to waver from this point, even as the narrative seems to tease and drift many times before revealing its full focus and momentum towards the end.

This is a brilliant film, absolutely worth viewing and savoring so long as you are looking for more than a simplistic horror tale about the recently dead being forced to drive Death's carriage.  This film is far too complex and mature to be accurately captured by a publisher's blurb.  It's pensive and artistic -- true and masterful arthouse long before there was an arthouse.",1350864000,2,1609,5.429718875502008

8215859,5,B000UZPMBW,"Absolutely one of the finest films ever made, silent or otherwise. Everything about it is special and powerful. I've been told Ingmar Bergman was inspired to make a career as a director by TPC, and certainly, certainly, most certainly, I can clearly see why. This film is incredible. The double exposure scenes were amazing - created by use of hand-cranked cameras no less! And how progressive, for that day, to play out in a series of flashbacks.

And how the story played out. The bad are punished. The good are also. As it is in this life. Everyone pays the consequences. I felt as if I weren't watching actors but people living out life as bad or good as they made it for themselves. I felt their despair.

This is a horror film only in the fact that death is horrible. Once gone you can never make amends. There is a line in the film addressing what is called the torment of remorse. And indeed, what is worse than that? Only death. Such a lesson. As I get older these awarenesses have a more profound effect on me.

The plot line has been explained pretty thoroughly by other reviewers. I'm only here to heap praises upon a film that made me experience total emotional meltdown. And cheer for the fact that people can turn around and find redemption ... sometimes, some way, in some few cases, in this weary world of ours.

Lord allow my soul to come to maturity before it is reaped.

Amen.",1505952000,,1396,4.458823529411765
8215860,4,B000UZPMBW,"This Scadanavian silent is a remarkable experience - albeit, perhaps a bit different experience than its original viewers might have had. It's nor ""colorized"" (praise be), but different passages have different color cast to their monochrome scheme. Also, the sound track seems more modern, with jarring discords emphasizing a few crucial moments. Still, this print preserves the chiaroscuro and contrasts of the original, along with its magical optical effects and evocative sets. ""Effects"" in those days were either staged and filmed, or added in the darkroom - the latter being very effective in capturing the Carriage's ghostly nature.

Acting is as you'd expect in a silent film, with grander gestures and facial expressions than you see today - but that's part of its retro charm. The script seems light and moralistic too, culminating in a deathbed repentance and happy-ish ending. I'm glad I've seen it, but might not have room for it in my permanent video library.

8215861,3,B000UZPMBW,"The Phantom Carriage is beautifully filmed using monochrome tints, sophisticated double exposures, dainty dollhouse-like sets, and shadowy, haunting cinematography.  Its melancholic atmosphere initially piques viewer curiosity, but that interest soon fades as the scenes and sequences seem to repeat themselves. The acting is less stagy or theatrical than what you might normally see in silent pictures, but the characters feel more like props than real people. It tends to play out like a heavy-handed moral tale, being both preachy and sentimental. The main focus is on the ""sinners"", or the vile ones, who, after death are forced to drive the phantom carriage and look back on the error of their ways as a kind of atonement for their ""sins"". Unfortunately, this message is laid on too thick for too long, irredeemably stretching the film's duration to 104 minutes.  Once the film's message is realized less than halfway through, there is very little left to stimulate the viewer's eyes or imagination. If you're looking for something more creative and more liable to spark your imagination, I recommend Dreyer's dark and enigmatic Vampyr.",1494547200,,1141,5.298342541436464

8215864,4,B000UZPMBW,"This is a great silent film; However, it's far from perfect. The first hour of the movie is a complete masterpiece filled with emotional scenes, and great visuals, but the rest 47 minutes has its ups, and downs. This inconsistency is due to two issues that the movie fails to resolve: (Possible Spoilers)
1. The relationship between the protagonist (David Holm), and one of the supportive characters (Sister Edit) was underdeveloped, and therefore, some of their scenes together lose their impact.
2. The protagonist becomes very unlikable as the movie progresses, and then the movie does a poor job of redeeming him to make him likable again.

8215866,5,B000UZPMBW,"The Phantom Carriage is an incredible, moving film that everyone should see; one of the greatest ever made and also one of the most criminally overlooked, and with this release Criterion has done it justice.

The packaging is the standard hefty Criterion blu-ray case with a substantial booklet inside and fitting artwork. Nothing particularly special as far as Criterions go but still nice.

The visuals are stunning, there is a clarity here that seems like it should be impossible for a film as old as this. Scratches are present, and some irreparable damages to the film are visible but there is nothing distracting and these things add to the charm of the film more than they detract.

There are two scores available here, both absolutely wonderful in their own way; I cannot express how important it is to experience both. The first is a chamber orchestra score composed by Matti Bye and it is by far one of the greatest traditional scores I have ever heard. Both incredibly moving and foreboding, always appropriate, every instrument as clear as a bell, and not a sole wasted note; this is beautiful music and it needs to be heard. That being said, the second score is an experimental score by KTL, a project of the great Stephen O'Malley, and despite the beauty of the Matti Bye score this is the one I prefer. It is ominous and oppressive, it feels like the cloak of death hovering over you as you watch the film. It is constant but ever changing and knows when to retreat far enough into the background to let the film speak for itself. The KTL score is truly something special and should not be ignored.

The supplements here feel less substantial than most other Criterion releases, unfortunately, but I attribute this to the age of the film and a lack of resources. What we do get is interesting enough; and interview with Ingmar Bergman on the influence Sjstrm had in him, a video essay comparing the work of Bergman and Sjstrm, a short video showing the making of the studio where the Phantom Carriage was filmed, and the main attraction: a fantastic commentary that really adds some depth to future viewings of the film.

I cannot recommend this blu-ray enough; this is an incredible film that deserves far more recognition and it is beautifully presented here.",1473379200,,2276,4.737373737373737
