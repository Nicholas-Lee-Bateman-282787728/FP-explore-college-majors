8618671,5,B00FUABKA4,"I really dig this 1970's TV movie directed by the great Reza Badiyi (he did the original HAWAII Five-0 credit sequence as well as directing everything from that show to the original MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE to POLICE SQUAD and he's terrific here directing Bradford Dillman (an excellent underrated actor that always delivers) as well as Sharon Farrell (a bit shrill here but that's the character she is portraying) and the awesome Barbara Rush (a fan of hers since IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE) - she really has an intense role and just watch out for that ending! Peter Haskell does a terrific job leading the proceedings and Adam West is solid as his friend. Joan Bennett (DARK SHADOWS) is always a class act and does very well here with her role. Scary, suspenseful with awesome music borrowed from Henry Mancini's score for WAIT UNTIL DARK and music from the original OMEGA MAN flick. What fun!",1402099200,2,888,4.7727272727272725
8618672,2,B00FUABKA4,"I remember how excited I was back in 1972 when ""The Eyes of Charles Sand"" was first announced.  ""Dark Shadows"" had recently ended its original run, and star Joan Bennett had been cast in this TV movie, which was the pilot for a proposed new prime time series.  I was in middle school, and the prospect of a new weekly show that dealt with the occult sounded like a sure-fire, can't-miss proposition.  For some reason, I missed the broadcast of the movie; I was doubly disappointed when I later read that ABC had passed on the whole idea.

Well, over forty years have gone by, and having finally seen the DVD-R issued by the Warner Archives, I can well understand why ""The Eyes of Charles Sand"" disappeared so quickly.  It starts out promisingly enough, with the title character (Peter Haskell) dreaming of his sightless uncle popping up out of a coffin; seconds later the phone rings and his Aunt Alexandria (Miss Bennett) tells him that his uncle has, in fact, just died, and that she knows about the dream.  It seems that Charles has inherited ""The Sight"", the ability to see into the world of the dead.  Sure enough, at his uncle's funeral, Sand sees the corpse of a woman who died 100 years ago beckoning to him, and the main credits, a far-out blend of op-art letters and circles of light, begin to roll.

Unfortunately, it's all downhill from that point on.  The main ""plot"", something about a girl (Sharon Farrell) who has read about a murder in an old diary and confused it with what might have been the murder of her absentee brother, is rambling and unbelievable, and the performances of Miss Farrell as the heroine, and Barbara Rush and Bradford Dillman as her sister and brother-in-law, are shrill and amateurish.  The discordant musical score, blatantly ripped off from Henry Mancini's masterful composition for ""Wait Until Dark"" (Mancini sued the producers for copyright infringement and won the case), is annoyingly over-utilized, and the production values are an abomination, with what appears to be thick pink nail polish substituting for blood.  The only assets are the earnest performances of Mr. Haskell, Miss Bennett, and Adam ""Batman"" West, playing a shrink.  This film is cautiously recommended to die-hard fans of these three performers; others will probably find the entire enterprise a visual embarrassment.",1386547200,2,2333,4.893401015228426
