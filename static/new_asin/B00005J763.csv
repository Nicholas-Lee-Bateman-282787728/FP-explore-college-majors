7938809,4,B00005J763,"Three months after the release of this DVD, Eiji Ezaki suffered his career-ending injury in a throwaway match, and less than half a year later, the entire FMW promotion folded. There were other factors involved, but Ezaki's forced departure from pro wrestling was the biggest nail in the coffin because his Hayabusa character (aptly described in the narrative as a ""mysterious Oriental creature"") was, simply, the heart and soul of FMW, more than any other performer had been for a half-decade. This DVD seeks to enforce this point, with mixed but overall passable results. The 90-minute package features only three matches which are nonetheless all main-event encounters and demonstrate Hayabusa able to work against a variety of opponents with different styles. The DVD could be better, but for what it is, it's a good release.

The first portion of the show is a compilation of Hayabusa's signature moves, lifted from a plethora of matches. It's fun to watch and shows off what an aerial monster this guy could be, but also alerts you to a bunch of bouts that you wish could've been included on the set, including one against the Great Sasuke.

Vs. Masato Tanaka - the first of three matches chronicling Hayabusa's ascent to the twin championships has him squaring off with a former ECW champion and definitely one of the strongest Japanese wrestlers. Things start off speedy but grind to a painfully slow pace when the two resort to indecently long submission holds. Hayabusa manages a cool dropkick to Tanaka's elbow, but the action doesn't pick up again for another ten minutes. A series of back & forth moves - including a tornado DDT and Hayabusa's signature senton-to-Asai - make the rest of the match fun to watch, but you can't forget how long it took to get there. 3 stars

A short intermission features footage of an unmasked Eiji visiting a temple in Taiwan to learn dance moves from a master - like Tony Jaa in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ong-Bak-3/dp/B004BZ5ADW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ong Bak 3</a>.

Vs. Mike Awesome - my personal favorite of the collection. The late Mike Awesome was a fantastic physical specimen, and starts off the match by dominating Hayabusa and hitting a springboard clothesline to the arena floor. A bit of brawling with chairs and tables fulfills the ""hardcore"" quota of the DVD, but it's not the focus of the match. For the remaining fourteen minutes or so, Hayabusa and Awesome exchange cool moves, including a sitout powerbomb off the turnbuckle and more high-flying moves from both. The match is about ten minutes shorter than the other two, making it much easier for the wrestlers to set and keep up the pace. 5 stars

What follows is a video narrative, including black & white dramatized sections, documenting the careers and rivalry of Hayabusa and his opponent in the final match, Masashi ""Mr. Ganosuke"" Honda. There's a good deal more drama involved than I expected, giving the match more gravity than FMW video packages usually provide.

Vs. Mr. Ganosuke - a stout man with bleached hair, Ganosuke isn't much to look at but he proves to be a better-than-average wrestler. The match is a sort of friendly middle ground of the last two, featuring a section of boring submission exchanges that are thankfully not nearly as long as the first match's. After that, we're treated to some pleasing back & forth action with plenty of power moves, beginning with Ganosuke lifting both Hayabusa's and his partner Shinzaki's signature finishers. A cool exchange of suplexes drives the match to a head, ending with Hayabusa's debuting a new move for the finale. A short, emotional speech follows the match and glitter falls from the ceiling to celebrate the victor. 4 stars

The only noteworthy extra the DVD offers is a short segment of Azaki applying his face paint in the dressing room - not really riveting, but it's cool to watch this ritual he'd have gone through daily. Additionally, the DVD is made substantially better by the exclusion of FMW-regular Eric Gellar as an announcer: John Watanabe and Dan Lovranski call this one straight, not feigning any animosity or making wisecracks. It's a very watchable production; I just wish there was more to it.",1340236800,,4251,5.029829545454546
7938810,5,B00005J763,"This is the best way to get introduced to the FMW style of mtches. The most popular superstar on the FMW roster is Hayabusa. First off, we have a package of Hayabusa's arsenal of moves, most of wich are high flying. Then we have Hayabusa vs Tanaka. This is the first of three tournament matches leading up to the biggest FMW showdown and the most personal FMW fued: Hayabusa one-on-one with Mr. Gannosuke. This tape shows the history of Hayabusa's FMW stay but it mainly focuses on the Gannosuke/ Hayabusa feud. It also reveals where he got the idea for the costume and gimmick. For those who don't know who him, he is a masked Japanese version of Sabu. This tape is cool.
The second tounament match is Hayabusa vs. Mike ""Gladiator"" Awesome. It was a good match. Gladiator is one of the few guys that can get a clean pin-fall on Hayabusa.
But he is pinned by Hayabusa. All three matches will have you on the enge of your seat with anticipation.",1046908800,,944,4.46242774566474
7938811,2,B00005J763,"Well, for starters, there are problems with this. The music is crappy and obnoxious, some small parts of matches are clipped out, there are very, very limited ""extra"" features for a DVD, and the biggest one of all, the commentary is godawful. Its terrible, I watched this video over three days because after about 20 minutes I couldn't stand listening to those idiots anymore, ""Straight Up"" John Watambe couldn't stop himself from calling every 4th word out of his mouth ""straight up"". On the plus side, the matches that are on the CD are quite good, but again a downer, paying 22 bucks for a DVD thats essentially nothing more than three wrestling matches isn't a steal by any stretch of the imagination. So, to sum it up, I enjoyed the actual wrestling, but you have to look past some real problems, the main one being ""straight up"" morons for commentators.",1010620800,,859,4.695364238410596
7938812,5,B00005J763,"This is the best Tokyopop FMW DVD release yet. The bad jokes and stupid stories that the announcing team told in the previous Tokyopop releases are gone, replaced by straight-forward and informative commentary. I salute Tokyopop for listening to the complaints of the fans in regards to the commentary and correcting this problem.
As for the DVD itself- you get 3 great Hayabusa matches, a long video introduction showing highlights of him performing his most popular moves, and interesting stories telling you the background of each match. The matches are in crystal-clear DVD quality, with great stereo sound too. I'd recommend this to any wrestling fan, whether you are a long-time Hayabusa fan or are just curious to see how great a wrestler he is.",1006732800,2,752,5.024
7938813,5,B00005J763,This tape really shows you the skill of Hayabusa.  It is a great introduction to both FMW and the wrestler.  American fans will recognize both Tanaka and Mike Awsome and will be able to observe the abilities of Hayabusa as he wrestles against these two former ECW champions.  I have become a fan of This man,1001030400,3,307,4.446428571428571
7938814,1,B00005J763,"Nothing against the wrestling or video quality. Of course it's superb. It's the commentary that's still bad. Tokyo Pop actually listened and changed the way they present FMW. The annoying kayfabed unfunny stranglemania wannabee commentary is gone. But, the commentators are still know nothing no talent dopes. They do try to do it sports style and actually call the matches, as badly as they can. Since it's not live commentary, you'd think Tokyopop would go back and edit the mistakes out. Nope. It's like 2 guys who sitting at home pretending to be Jim Ross & Joey Styles at the same time. I love the fact that Hayabusa's moves are shown & named beforehand, but the dopes still get them wrong.
Plus, everything on here can be found on any Best Of Hayabusa Compilation tape in original Japanese and the most of the matches have no commentary at all. Sigh.
As with the past FMW DVDs, you'd think there would be extras.
Wrong. No Japanese audio track (which is the only reason I buy these DVDs), no extra matches, NOTHING different from the VHS. There should at least be an option to turn off the commentary, since it was just dropped on top of the original audio. I wish I'd known before buying. I've since sold it.",999388800,,1215,4.6036866359447
