8267349,1,B0017UC3RU,Video images are good but sound is extra poor in quality. Sound can't almost be heard and there is a lot of noise around,1243814400,4,120,4.041666666666667
8267350,1,B0017UC3RU,"Pretty bad.  This ""thing"" appeared to be raw footage captured by a rank amateur who could not (1) focus, (2) follow action, (3)zoom or pan, and (4) edit.  At all.

I have seen professionally produced videos of the Sambodromo and, until now, I thought some were a bit poorly produced.  They were magnificent compared to this thing.

Save your time, save your money, save your sanity.  Amazon really needs a ""no star"" rating for something this awful.",1239580800,6,448,4.753246753246753
8267351,4,B0017UC3RU,"Sambodromo 2008 is an excellent quality overview of the parades of costumed performers and elaborate floats that are a part of the Carnival of Rio. It seems to all be shot from the same location, the front row balcony view, as each ""school"" of the parade passes by. The widescreen view is essential to take in the large scale of this event, there are some detail shots of individuals, but mainly it is a kalidoscopic panorama of extravagant themed costumes and floats resembling fantasy architecture up to 3 stories high, with performers in lavish settings. The women resemble Las Vegas showgirls,with dazzling jewels and mountains of exotic feathers. But this is not a sexploitation film, and the occassional topless groups are in glittery body paint and incidental to the festivities.
There are basic interactive chapter menues, with informative names of each school, and the camera work was very steady and clear. The editing is somewhat abrupt and may have benefitted from a few scene transitions, but there is a LOT of material here for the nearly 2 hour show. Yes, as another reviewer mentioned there is the occasional TV crew or parade coordinator briefly crossing in front of the camera. And I was surprised to see still photographers sometimes getting right in the way of the marching schools, but this only serves to give this fantasy world a touch of the reality of media coverage. There is no annoying narration, only the live sounds of the event. Basically a high quality home movie from a tourist's front row vantage point.",1210982400,5,1537,4.915384615384616
8267352,4,B0017UC3RU,"Carnival in Rio is a huge dazzling display with a cast of thousands. The costumes are wild and the floats are grand and people take having-a-good-time seriously. Everything sparkles. There are jellyfish and dinosaurs, Aztecs, slaves and colonialists, nearly everything in the human psyche. And yes, there are plenty of bare bottoms belonging to good-looking women, but that's still just a small percentage of the show. At nearly two hours, this is just a fun disk to pop in and let it play.

The video quality is mixed. Sometimes it's sharp with clear details but other times pixilation really shows. It seems to be 1.78:1. But what it really looks like is somebody's holiday video from a theme park. You get a good sideline view of the parade, but there are all kinds of security, photographer and support guys crossing in front the camera. Hardly professional, but it could be worse. I still recommend it.",1210550400,7,907,4.851612903225806
