8350855,5,B0024RIBE4,"Eliane's performance in this piano festival is tops. Her trio really give it their all, their solo performances being very inspired .

All the songs are part of Eliane's repertoire at that stage of time, 1991.  My favorite being Choro, a song composed originally by Amilton Godoy, pianist for the legendary Brazilian Zimbo Trio, the bossa nova interpreters- by- excellence for over four decades. Amilton was also Eliane's piano teacher at the Centro Livre de Aprendizagem Musical in Sao Paulo, Brazil.  In this song, Eliane plays with force and inspiration, with a marked latin and bossa nova beat.

The Medley Waters of March/Agua de Beber, in honor to Antonio Carlos Jobim, Eliane gives us an amazing introductory piano solo, a worthy tribute to Tom.

The Way You Look Tonight brings out the best of her and her musicians. The bass player Jay Anderson and drum player Adam Nussbaum surprise us with their solos kicking in when we thought Eliane had come to the end of the song. The other jazz pieces are all excellent. Don't miss Elianes facial cues and expressions to her musicians.

If you love good jazz and bossa nova you will not be dissappointed with this rare DVD recording - I think it's the only official Eliane Elias video recording- . Try to listen to the songs with headphones or a high quality sound equipment to fully appreciate this wonderful musical recording.",1369872000,,1378,4.842553191489362
8350856,5,B0024RIBE4,"There are precious few stand alone videos of Eliane Elias unless one stitches You Tube material together for their own use , however this DVD is absolutely awesome . It ships from the EU , and arrived in about 9 days .

Eliane was 31 at the time of this concert in 1991, and she just plays her fanny off . Bassist Jay Anderson and Eliane do amazing left hand piano/bass passages in unison that will blow you away with some brush work from drummer Adam Nussbaum that is nothing short of spectacular .

The run time is 65 minutes, and you will find that it will be an hour of your time well spent .

There are 2 absolute stand out tunes among the rest , and they are ""The Way You Look Tonight"", and ""Desifinado""....these are just brilliant.
Be sure and notice the silent communication that takes place between the three of them . The glance , smile , or wink telegraph just who will do what , and also just how Eliane wants the dynamics .

The DVD is both Pal and NTSC region 2 , and worked without any problem on my DVD system , and of course played well in my computer system .

If you like jazz done right , then you will love this DVD ..

I can also recommend her CD's . Her performance on any of many standards,and of course Bossas and Sambas , is just plain ear candy.",1360108800,,1272,4.108870967741935
