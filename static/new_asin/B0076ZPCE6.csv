5058746,5,B0076ZPCE6,"My kids are 1/2 Korean, ages 4 and 2 1/2.  Although their grandmother is with them during the day and speaks to them in Korean, it's been hard to get them interested in speaking the Korean language themselves.  We currently have a private Korean tutor who comes for one hour twice a week, but purchased Dino Lingo to supplement their language classes during the week.
As an adult, the structure of the videos seem odd at first. However, after a few times watching the DVD's, I realized the structure is to keep the children entertained and interested.  It really does keep their attention and my children love to repeat the Korean words as it plays.",1339372800,8,649,4.626086956521739
5058747,5,B0076ZPCE6,"My wife is a Korean-American and we speak English at home. I purchased Dino Lingo Korean DVDs few weeks before we went to Korea as a family. I wanted my 2,5 year old daughter to learn some Korean so she could impress our relatives living there. I am glad I did it, as soon as DVDs arrived, she started watching them all the time, she loved the animations, bit by bit she started repeating the words and phrases, and she would look at the flash cards and tell us the name of the objects. When we went to Korea, all our relatives seemed so happy how she could pronounce those words perfect. They would point to her nose and she would say ""nose"" in Korean, and head, hair, hat, etc... and everybody would laugh. Mission accomplished. I would recommend these DVDs to anyone who wants to teach beginner level to their kids.  Now we're back from Korea and she picked up a lot over there, we need more advanced levels. I am happy with my purchase and I recommend.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Korean-for-Kids-Learning-Korean-for-Children-DVD-Set-5-DVDs-Korean-flash-cards-100-cards-and-a-poster/dp/B0076ZPCE6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Korean for Kids - Learning Korean for Children DVD Set (5 DVDs), Korean flash cards (100 cards) and a poster</a>",1336780800,4,1281,5.373134328358209
8511350,2,B0076ZPCE6,"So they sell 6 dvd's... but each one is very short, think like 30 minutes short. I would have much preferred less discs with longer runtimes. On top of that there is ALOT of filler that has nothing to do with whatever subject they are covering. Also, there are alot of words that are a direct import of English words, seems odd to pick words that are almost exactly the same in Korean as they are in English.  On top of that, the set I bought had weird sound issues on the first disc so that  the music was really loud, and the speaking was quiet. The ""flashcards"" that come with it are made of a very light grade of cardstock, in the range of a 80# which is almost like paper. They also have both the words and pictures on the same side. Granted that isn't a huge problem when they can't read, but its still a choice I can only ascribe to the fact that it is cheaper to print that way. That said, my daughter does like the movies, though I don't know how much she actually gets from them. I would rate the series higher if it wasn't so expensive for what you get.",1498953600,,1064,4.110576923076923
8511351,4,B0076ZPCE6,"My kids love the series. My only complaint is that the alphabet books and posters are missing letters. Hangul has 22 letters but the poster shows at most, ten. Also as a precaution to parents who cannot read Korean, the mini books are entirely in Hangul (no romanization) however Hangul is easy to learn.",1483142400,,304,4.648148148148148
8511352,4,B0076ZPCE6,"As a very basic Korean speaker who doesn't know proper grammar, etc., I want to provide my daughter with opportunities to learn the language correctly. We've only watched DVDs 1 and 2, but so far both my 3 year old and I have learned lots of new vocabulary!  She enjoys watching her language lessons, and I like playing it while I'm preparing dinner so that she is busy and so that I can pick up the vocabulary I'm lacking. Win-win situation!

The reason for minus one star is that there are some weird/cheesy interludes to keep the children's attention, but are random at best, to me the parent. (ex: a robot falls in love with a flower, they dance together in a field, he accidentally uproots her and she wilts, then he brings her back to life...). Also, I'm not using the flashcards yet, but I think they will be useful after she's watched all the DVDs to do some quizzes on the road when we're traveling or waiting at restaurants.",1453334400,,934,4.456140350877193
8511353,5,B0076ZPCE6,"I purchased this DVD set to help my 5 year old learn Korean. She found it very entertaining and was able to memorize many of the Korean words and phrases from watching the program repeatedly. The vibrant colors, cute characters and non-stop action helped maintain her attention. This is a great place to start for teaching kids Korean. It is also a good introduction for adults to learn useful everyday nouns.",1433462400,2,409,4.774647887323944
8511354,5,B0076ZPCE6,A great language tool for kids! My kids enjoy watching the Dino Lingo videos again and again. They repeat the words and seem to be learning some Korean from the videos.,1433376000,,168,4.451612903225806
8511355,5,B0076ZPCE6,"My original order had 2 defective DVD's.  I contacted customer service and they took care of it quickly and without any delay.  In today's world, it was refreshing to see a company that put customers first.  My wife and I have recommended this to other new parents with the success we have had with the DVD's.

On the DVD's alone, will your child become fluent in Korean.  No, because they don't really talk back to the TV.  But I was so impressed that my son could at least comprehend what was happening.  I now speak to my son in Korean (albeit he talks back to me in English).

The DVDs flashes moving images of the noun/verb on screen, and then the narrator (female) speaks in Korean the noun/verb.  The hangul, is also shown on the screen.  The system seems to work as my son immediately learned his colors first.  I started the videos as soon as my son was about 6 months old.  We are going to do the same thing with our second son.

ON a side note, we have mini van with dvd player.  Because kids are so bored on car rides, this forced my first son to watch nothing but this video which also helped accelerate his comprehension,

The flash cards are business card size.  So what I did was purchase a business card holder/organizer.  This way my son could flip through the pages without destroying the cards.  Due to the system, my wife even learned a few Korean words (not a native Korean speaker).",1433376000,,1405,4.37984496124031
8511356,5,B0076ZPCE6,my kids love it. It is worth your time.,1415750400,,39,3.4444444444444446
8511357,4,B0076ZPCE6,My 19 month old daughter loves these videos. They are entertaining and educational. She is always asking to watch them.,1358208000,3,119,5.0
8511358,4,B0076ZPCE6,"My kids were very interested in this video and my two-year-old repeated each word he heard.  The video does a great job of clearing linking words with images.  I may need to teach my kids to recognize the written Hangul someday because that does not seem to be a focus of the video, although I only watched one of the videos once at this point.  For some reason, the DVD played all the way through; it would have been better if it naturally stopped after each lesson.  It seemed a bit like overload and I'm not sure how much my kids will absorb. I can try to intervene and turn it off sooner, but the kids were so interested, they didn't want me to do that.",1357689600,4,657,4.190476190476191
8511359,4,B0076ZPCE6,"Good program for learning basic Korean.  It's fun with a catchy tune, making it easy for kids to learn the language.  The ""free"" calendar was a bit of a joke - one page 11x18 with no significant dates, but the program itself is worth the money.",1356739200,,244,4.282608695652174
