I cant say I would recommend this to some due to the almost constant nudity... but overall, I loved it!",1389830400,,328,4.061538461538461
7852973,5,6303704735,"Greetings;

Who hasn't ever seen a live action adaptation of a cartoon before? Has it ever been a shot for shot faithful reproduction? No of course not and why? People most people bend like that and make up can only make someone look cartoonish enough to an extent before it all looks ridiculous. So while this isn't the greatest live action movie based on a mildly pornographic adult themed anime...Wait, is it? Well, off hand, I can think of several others- Kekko Kamen-four live action movies about a nude super heroine, weather woman-have seen the anime of it but have yet to watch the live action, though I have both movie. Angel of darkness-four or so movies but I have yet to see or buy them, La Blue Girl-I think that is what it was called anyway, three volues or so(its been a while) of more sex driven live action-ness. But I would say this was still a pretty good movie all the same. One of the better of the less sex, even nudity driven numbers out there.
I can see though where some of the other reviwers are coming from, no it was as good as the anime, no it didn't have the really perverted old man who was secretly protecting the two people assigned to watch over him that were supposed to create a kind of monster-human hybrid meant to usher in a new world where the monsters and humans could live in peace together sort-of. If you look at it from the right perspective though, you could almost say this is a sequel and the plan to create the human-monster hybrid plan failed, illustrated by the half monster/human partner to the male lead. That would almost have been a smarter way to go I think, changed this one a bit more to be a sequel, but I think I am about...Lemme see now, made in 1992...So yeah, 19 years too late. 19. Oh well, I will get em' next time, I am sure.
This movie though seems to take the concept of mosters as being evolved from reptiles whereas humans are mammals and the humans of this movie and the monsters therein are just some sort of higher evolution altogether which is sort of interesting too, different slant sort of from the anime, as I recall. Some reviwers mentioned that the special effects were reminicent of godzilla movies, well, yeah, this was afterall done in 1992, CG wasn't really big back then, as you may recall. So Godzilla-ish special effects were sort of what you had to work with.
Wasn't as bad as others have made it out to be though. I just wasn't really thrilled with the ending, would have preferred the male lead...Lung had stuck with the female lead...Gaye instead of making her leave back to her world. Sort of a downer, considering all it took for her to be safe, Lung too. But at any rate, not a terrible movie.

Thank you and take care...",1295913600,,2715,4.417165668662674
7852974,1,6303704735,"I have a vague memory of seeing the live Hong-Kong version of Wicked City prior to watching the Anime version, and liking it. No idea why I got the viewing order switched around, but these things happen. I even remember liking this low-budget sci-fi stuntfest AFTER watching the Anime.

Funny how your mind can play tricks on you. With that tiny, vague memory in place, I bought a used DVD copy at a fire-sale that my local video store was having (should'a been a hint, probably). Feeling oddly like I'd just found a long lost bit of treasure, I gleefully tore home, popped the disk in my DVD player, and spent the next hour and a half bored out of my mind, wondering what the h*** I'd been thinking.

There's plenty going on here... More than director Tai Kit Mak can seem to get a handle on. The movie is creative enough within its confined budget, with more special effects, cheesy acting (LOTS of jump cuts to over-emoting actors wearing baggy suits or doe-eyed actresses in skimpy dresses), and hyper-kinetic, high-flying stunts than you can shake a creepy vampire-spider-lady at.

The plot? Something about a hundred year old war between speedy, gun-toting Humans and super-powered Monsters disguised as humans, that's quickly coming to a nasty head. Two Hong Kong cops and the head-honcho monster's daughter are the only thing standing in the way of a full-monster takeover, via an imported Monster drug called 'Happiness'; a highly addictive energy drug that causes a nasty case of spontaneous combustion if you stop taking it.

My advice? Stick with the Anime - although I haven't seen that in a long time either, so maybe it's as bad as this...",1150934400,,1654,4.7727272727272725
7852975,3,6303704735,"To ""A Viewer"" that stated that nudity is not nice to put in anime.  You cant have a good anime without some form of sex.  As far as this film goes, not quite as cool as the actual anime it was based on, but still worth the time.",1123113600,2,228,3.7291666666666665

7852977,1,6303704735,"This is by far the worst transition of a decent story to film.  It by no means holds true to the spirit of the anime.

7852978,2,6303704735,"Maximum velocity adrenaline fuels the 1994 Hong Kong live-action rehab of the anime watershed. It's got enough juice to jack up half  a dozen movies. And it's so frantic and rampant, you'd have to stop midway to catch your breath. Set in a Hong Kong strangleheld by an economic cartel of alien shapeshifters, it follows two alienbusters, played by Jackie Cheung and Leon Lai, as they get to the bottom of a bodycount of junky wormfood. The gunhappy set pieces will , of course, unhinge your jaws. And this is packed with more ideas than Roland Emmerich and Jan De Bont's combined past/present/future ouevre. But director Mak Kit Tai doesn't have a clue what to do with them. Much like Emmerich and De Bont, really. So. When in doubt,overcompensate. Mak then revs everything up to a hyperbolic bluster where one alien hatchetman becomes a killer clock and another disguises itself as punch and still another morphs into a horny pinball machine, a carnivorous elevator and a Giger-like motorcycle-woman. Amazing on paper but it all plays a losing round of catch-up with the hit-and-miss (but mostly miss) special effects. When it gets to the climactic , and laughable, airborne duel between two aliens mounting hijacked 747s, exhilaration becomes exasperation and you're never sure if you're gasping in awe or just starting to gag. Camp delirium cranked up to 11, without a doubt. But I'd stick with the anime.",974851200,6,1408,4.940928270042194
7852979,2,6303704735,"First of all, this movie is not co-directed by yuen woo ping. Woo ping  acts in this movie,and from the lack of fight scenes you can tell he didn't  have anything to do with directing. Don't get me wrong though, this does  have some very interesting scenes. For example, monster father and son  standing on top of and controlling some airplanes. Or their complete  disregard of the laws of physics. Bottom line. if you're looking for a woo  ping directed martial arts masterpiece, you'll want to look elsewhere.  Like,Iron Monkey,tai chi2, wing chun, Twin Warriors",968976000,,564,4.873684210526315
7852980,3,6303704735,"While this can't hold a candle to the anime on which it is based (in fact I recommend you see the anime first, since it makes the plot a lot easier to follow), it's still an exciting, fun, undeniably entertaining  sci-fi/action/monster movie with cheap but generally effective special  effects. Thank god for Asian cinema - an American director wouldn't have  taken the storyline seriously, even if there was one with the balls to  attempt it.",938131200,4,443,4.866666666666666
7852981,5,6303704735,"I grew up reading comic books and watching Anime cartoons.  I adore movies which revive the exitement I got reading though the latest X-Men or watching the next episode of Evangelion.

Wicked City is cheezy and  overdramatic; but this is its charm.  Comic books and Anime ARE almost  annoyingly goofy--building secret organizations with super powers, they  give a reality to our dreams.  Wicked City has surreal fight scenes.  It  has a twisting and turning, sometimes confusing storyline.  It has special  effects remnoscient of early Godzilla movies.  It is a live action Comic  book.  It is Anime come to life.  It is a pleasant change from the high  budget Hollywood movies.

To anyone who still dreams of flying like  superman, or wishes they had a superpower, this is a movie you will enjoy.",934934400,7,797,4.909090909090909
