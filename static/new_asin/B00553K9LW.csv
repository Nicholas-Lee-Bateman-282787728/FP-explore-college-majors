4571600,5,B00553K9LW,"This is one of the best movies ever made and my favorite movie. It is hardcore 60's film, which is unusual as most films in the 60's soft pedaled the 60's. Being a huge Richard Boone fan this film is everything a Richard Boone fan could want. He knows how to make love to women and this film shows that off.
The movie works on a lot of different levels and really says a lot about that era and what was happening.",1314662400,7,413,4.048780487804878
4571601,1,B00553K9LW,"Cons:

The dialog is contrived, the acting is poor, and the story is sophomoric. This all adds up to ""hokey"" as an apt description of this movie that must have escaped as opposed to being released. It's a miracle that Boone was even able to get Blondell and Miles to be in it.

An amusing professional review is provided by ""doctorx2"" at [...]

Pros:

The scenery is nice. A lot has changed in 50 years, but those who have been to Kailua-Kona will recognize some of the views along Ali'i Drive.",1314230400,3,494,4.395604395604396
4571602,1,B00553K9LW,"I appreciate that this is a stinker of a film, and maybe the folks who did the manufacturing on demand thought they were doing me a favor, but $26.99 is a bit steep for a DVD-R that's missing the final third of the movie.

Really, I like Joan Blondell as much as the next person [no, I don't really] but watching her immobilized on the screen really isn't all that interesting.",1313625600,2,377,4.309859154929577

8457419,5,B00553K9LW,"If yer not a Boone fan, this is not fer ya!
 BUT as a young man back from S.E. Asia and Wild and unsettled, I'll never forget the picture in my mind's eye of Boone at the helm of his Cabin Cruiser plowing thru the swells, cold beer in hand, much like Hemingway, the salt air blowing thru his tangled hair as he lifts his craggy face to the heavens and bellows his life force for all the world to take heed, that warrior sneer and exuberance carving his smile, warning all that a Man is approaching! He was a Great one and is sorely missed!!!!!",1458864000,,543,4.122641509433962

8457421,4,B00553K9LW,"The story is pretty generic, although Richard Boone is very good.  But, the movie did contain some great shots of old Kona, back in the 60s when, at times, it was rather wild.  (I've lived in Kona for over 40 years and was here when it was like the old West).",1405641600,3,259,4.0588235294117645
8457422,5,B00553K9LW,"I first saw this movie about 40 years ago ... on a black and white TV no less. This was long before I knew anything about Hawai'i, Kona or how corny movies could be made based solely on the past glory of a washed up TV actor, in this case, Richard Boone. The plot line is totally irrelevant; you watch this movie for the sheer fun of seeing how poorly people act and how silly a story line somebody could come up with. You will watch this and think ""Is this where they got the idea for Magnum PI?""

Obviously because he directed (wrote and produced?) this giddy shindig, Richard Boone gets all the women. His grotesque features, crappy acting and bizarre role make it so very creepy. I could hear this voice in my head saying ""Really, Mr Boone, you thought this was going to revive your career?""

Highly recommended.",1389484800,,816,4.397350993377484

8457424,5,B00553K9LW,"If you are a Richard Boone fan, buy this one.  A different role for him, but he is a great actor.  Also, made from a good book.  Good watching with interesting twists.",1371513600,,167,4.15625

8457426,5,B00553K9LW,"Excellent movie,Richard Boone part was excellent. I loved the story line and the only thing that didn't care for was the age of the young women. The 20 year old were great in Paladin but at 50 years old they just didn't look right.",1350172800,3,231,4.2727272727272725
8457427,4,B00553K9LW,"Warner Archive has unearthed another forgotten gem from the late sixties, Director Lamont Johnson's 'KONA COAST'-1968, a virtual one man show for actor Richard Boone who also executive produced and probably believed in the material. Boone finds out his daughter was injected with heroin at a sex party and turns up dead on the sea coast.  The police hush it up as a drowning incident but Boone thinks otherwise turning the films running time into a vigilante/male odyssey culminating in bringing justice his style to the thugs responsible.  The head thug is underrated Steve Ihnat who always gave memorable villainous portrayals in his movie/television forays in the late sixties/early seventies.  Boone is joined by other venerable actors:  Vera Miles who never looked more beautiful; Joan Blondell looking like a feisty version of celebrity chef Paula Dean; and Kent Smith playing against type as an old beach bum-like saloon keeper who all aid Boone in his quest. The Direction by Johnson is adequate showing his early skills from television and graduating to such films as 'THE GROUNDSTAR CONSPIRACY'-1972.  The story by John McDonald adapted to the screen by Gil Ralston seems to have been thought out for Boone in mind.  Always playing scraggily, intense loners whether in Westerns or thrillers, he always gave his all and is perfect for this film.  The beautiful photography by Joseph LaShelle shows off the Hawaiian locations perfectly complimenting the face to face Boone/Ihnat battle at the climax.  The funky jazz score by Jack Marshall ices the cake making the film an enjoyable sixties time capsule romp.  Warner releases it as a DVD-R through Amazon in a nice 1.85 transfer with no extras. If you are a Richard Boone fan, you won't want to miss this great late-in-his-career excursion.",1321056000,8,1799,5.112627986348123
