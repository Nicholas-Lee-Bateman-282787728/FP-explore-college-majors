4336143,4,B004E8LGA2,"Presenting snazzy graphics, BACK DOOR CHANNELS: THE PRICE OF PEACE opens with a 90-second summary of the Arab-Jew divide and the complications of the oil industry.  In a way, it's a hint not to have too much faith in the Egypt-Israel peace process we are about to witness in this documentary, lest the masters of war go home and start selling lemonade after centuries of profit from destruction.

That opening is the first 90 seconds of what is just a 90-minute documentary, so those who find the Middle East saga baffling will find BACK DOOR CHANNELS a quick study of one of its recent watersheds.  Nonetheless, you might want to view the film twice as it does not necessarily remind you of who's who as players are interviewed.  Sure, we know Jimmy Carter and Henry Kissinger when we see them.  But it takes more than one caption to remember this guy is Nabil Elaraby, Egypt's Ministry of Foreign Affairs at the time, or that guy is William Quandt, who served on Carter's National Security Council.

Describing an incident of one nation making war against another, BACK DOOR CHANNELS uses the doublespeak term ""pre-emptive strike,"" which governments often say when attacking nations that have not so much as fired a shot at them.  Does the school principal ever ask two kids who had a fight, ""Who threw the second punch?""

Nonetheless, see BACK DOOR CHANNELS: THE PRICE OF PEACE.  I'm gonna watch it again.",1344556800,6,1408,4.761316872427984
4336144,5,B004E8LGA2,"Back Door Channels: The Price of Peace was the most attractive non-fiction film among dozens of great offerings at the 2012 Atlanta Jewish Film Festival. And it beat expectations. This is a great view for everyone...those with only a passing interest in the region as well as those with the deepest passion for the politics and peoples involved.

As a student of the Middle East region, and native son of Jimmy Carter's home state, I wanted to get a deeper look into the lengthy Camp David peace process. My companion at the movie brought zero knowledge of the region's political history. And we both loved it. Led us both towards better knowledge and curiosity about the world around us.

The movie gives a window into the intricacies of diplomacy away from cameras and other recording devices...and how those hidden channels help immensely towards peace. Thanks to the AJFF and the Price of Peace staff who worked hard to unveil this great movie.",1332288000,9,948,4.845679012345679

8426577,4,B004E8LGA2,Jimmy Carter used a determined attitude and humility to achieve the impossible dream I couldn't have enjoyed it more It was a tremendous tragedy the death of Anwar sadat and i am left wondering how such important work could have come to a  halt  35 years later and belligerence have taken hold of the general arena .. WE pray for peace and settlement,1400457600,,350,4.5396825396825395
8426578,5,B004E8LGA2,"This is a great documentary about the Camp David Peace Treaty process and illuminates upon what it takes to negotiate, mediate, a very tough and imperfect agreement. Some things come out from the interviews. That America's position is that the settlements are an obstacle to peace from the USA perspective, and some influential Israelis too. However, nothing is mentioned about America's own captured territories from war. One way that this Camp David accord worked was that President Carter was willing to blame Anwar Sadat if the treaty did not go through and this brought Sadat to an agreement. However , at the second Camp David President Clinton said he was willing to blame Yassir Arafat if he did not accept Ahud Barak's generous offer of a two state solution, but did not really do so and Yassir Arafat did not agree in the end to the peace treaty which led to another bloody intifada, even with the peace with Egypt. Looking back, one can see the flaw in the Camp David agreement in that Egypt could not negotiate for the Palestinians even though Egypt thought that if Egypt took herself out of the war for the return of the Sinai then there would be peace. In the end because there was no negotiation at the time , there was an Intifada, and wars in Lebanon. In the end the only thing saving Israel is not her returning land and helping the political careers of national leaders hoping for historical glory,  but her continued willingness to defend herself. Looking back, probably the best thing that should have happened was that Egypt offer some land next to Gaza to the Palestinians, let the Israelis keep their settlement, the Israels in return give land to the Palestinians as a two state solution and Syria also redraws her map visa vie Israel and the Palestinians instead of demanding every inch of land back which is not helpful for a total and broad peace. This artificial map is a result of the fall of the ottoman Empire so no one has an air tight claim to their present borders. If Israel can't defend herself, there will never be peace, rather her weakening will lead to more war. In the video - all the players come out looking good, and they really tried the best they could and pushed it to the limit even though the differences are almost impossible. I personally knew Leon Charney, a great American Jew, and he was a very dedicated person and modest person who loves both the USA and Israel and did his best to help bring peace. This was truly an international effort then. Everyone interested in people doing their utmost for peace would enjoy this video.
