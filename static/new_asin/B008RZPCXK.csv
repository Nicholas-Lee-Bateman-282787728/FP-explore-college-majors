5180385,5,B008RZPCXK,Really enjoyed this video.  Brings together several different rescue groups in helping the Haiti rescue effort.  Quality is good scenery is beautiful and then tragic seeing Haiti from the many different angles. Would definitely recommend this video.,1371600000,,249,5.702702702702703
5180386,3,B008RZPCXK,"Watching a video that was shot in native 3D really shows you just what the format is really for. There were some close ups of a female pilot and her eyelashes were popping out of the screen in such clarity it was amazing!
The video as a whole was a day-in-the-life of, not so much an action packed multiple viewing fun film.
Soooo, I can't really say I'd watch it more than twice in my lifetime?",1365465600,2,395,4.2105263157894735
5180387,4,B008RZPCXK,"Excellent cinematography, accentuated with strong 3D, enhances this Imax documentary's salute to First Alert rescue teams' impact on international disasters' victims' injuries and survival resources.  The highlight is unprecedented 3D cinamatography of Haiti' s ravaged landscape after its devastating earthquake.  Highly recommended.",1363478400,,334,6.928571428571429
5180388,4,B008RZPCXK,"There are alot of great shots of rescue people doing their jobs in this one. The only complaint I have is that they didn't show them actually rescueing people by digging them out of buildings ,they did show the overall picture though. .  Still this is very impressive footage of rescue workers who give it their all. Featured are volunteer firefighters, a c-19 pilot ( a gorgeous lady who is serving our country), a u.s. helicopter pilot, a Canadian destroyer crew, and others. This is not a movie of course , it's a Imax show and they are all good imo. They give us good overviews of their subjects in a forty minute clip. They look much better on the big screen of course, but they remain impressive on a 55"" panasonic plasma too. ONe thing that struck me about this one was that rescue work is one of mankinds better endeavours. For all of our cruelty and wars we still have the capacity to care enough to rush to the aid of both people and animals. The scenes of Haiti's destruction in this one are awful but they do not show any of the 250,000 dead. This is  a educational film like all Imax films if you don't like that type of film then you shouldn't buy these. Most of us do though and I have at least fifteen 3d Imaxers so far.",1356825600,,1236,4.277777777777778
5180389,3,B008RZPCXK,"Gave it a 3 stars because thought it was going to be more about training ie Coast Guard and actual ""Rescues"" while it was more about the Hatti  earthquake and providing relief. Admirable people doing admirable work for a worthy cause. However, that is not the type of ""Rescue"" video I thought I was buying and wanted to watch.",1356739200,3,326,4.52542372881356
5180390,1,B008RZPCXK,"No real interesting,Nd the video is not great.  I was very disjointed.  How can I continue. To trash this product",1356652800,,113,4.6
5180391,5,B008RZPCXK,"I first saw this movie at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C.  I purchased a copy to add to my personal video library.  This is not a full length hollywood feature, but is about 45 minutes long, detailing first responder training, deployment and their actions during the Haiti earthquake emergency.  The Blu Ray 2D Version is Impressive, but the 3D version is Spectacular!  The 3D effects add to the realism and drama of the documentary instead of gratuitious Hollywood 3D effects.  Overall:  A feel good about America movie!",1352764800,14,545,4.934065934065934
5180392,4,B008RZPCXK,"Don't rent or buy this movie expecting a feature film. It's not that at all. Instead this is an IMAX experience that is being released to DVD in every format available, including 3-D. As with most IMAX films it isn't a straight forward story you're getting but more a look at the world, in this case the world of rescue relief workers.

The film establishes each person being talked about from a woman who pilots planes for the Air Force to a fire fighter who wants to help people. We get a glimpse into the daily routine of their lives and what they do there. About halfway through that changes and each one finds their way into helping the survivors of the earthquake that took place in Haiti.

The film then displays the contributions of each to the rescue mission that went on there. When we hear about these sorts of disasters these days it seems all we hear about is how someone didn't do enough or didn't do it fast enough. Watching this film you get the idea that doing it fast isn't always the answer but doing it right is. In some cases, as in this situation, you could see that word got out as quick as possible and the response was immediate. In some cases it was days before the actual help could arrive but it was on the way.

While there aren't dramatic instances on display in this film such as a man carrying a baby from a burning building, the efforts of each one of these people do show an amazing amount of courage and dedication to helping others. It would be nice if the world we knew had more of that and less of people not asking for help because they want it but because they need it. The selflessness on display by those involved here is worth plenty of applause.

The movie itself is breathtaking. Sure it was made for IMAX and for 3-D but the copy I have was a straight forward DVD. The images were as clear as if they were blu-ray intended and incredibly sharp. The photography was breath taking. If you're looking for something do show off what an amazing thing a big screen TV is or to see for yourself what it's capable of, then by all means this one would be worth adding to your collection. I can only imagine what it would be like in 3-D.

As it is, the film is a reminder of how fortunate most of us our in our day to day lives. Hopefully we will never suffer the devastation that those in Haiti faced. And if we do face that lets hope that those selfless heroes seen on display in this film are there to offer comfort and aid once more.",1352764800,,2473,4.253191489361702
5180393,4,B008RZPCXK,"So I'm at a local retail store. I don't have a lot of money on me but I want a good 3D title. Then,as if my prayers where heard i stumbled upon this little gem called ""Rescue"" 3D.

Rescue 3D, centers around the U.S Air Force's relief efforts after the devastating earthquake in Haiti.
The opening shots are beautiful in 3D,offering a few moments that made me feel these objects where right in the room with me. When it comes to the pop out factor, Rescue certainly has its fair share and the effect of it is done rather nicely.

The biggest drawback to this film is that theirs quiet a few shot where the absence of 3D is noticeable. The pay off though,comes with the fact that you'll watch one or two scenes back to back with little to no 3D,then the next thing you know a great 3D shot comes around the corner. Another pass i'll give this movie,is that some of the 2D shots look so awesome by themselves it really didn't bother me that not all of them where 3D. I never came away with the feeling I had been robbed of a 3D moment.

The next positive I'll give this film is that it's filled with trailers (theirs about ten or twelve of them) and the good news is most of them are in 3D as well. So it's kind of nice to test run some other Imax 3D films before I commit to buying them.
In the end what makes Rescue 3D so great isn't just the price (fifteen dollars),it's the quality of the 3D you're getting for the price. I've seen 3D not pulled off as well in other films for a much higher price.
I would highly recommend this,not just for the price,but for the content.",1352678400,18,1572,4.1644736842105265
5180394,3,B008RZPCXK,"ok heres at least 20 words.  it was pretty slow paced, minimal pop out effect, not exciting, maybe two moments of ""oo cool""  probably would look better on a 4k resolution screen like the theater when it was in Imax3D....  this bluray is a must have for imax enthusiasts but not a must have for people collecting only the best 3D content...",1351641600,3,339,4.435483870967742

5180403,5,B008RZPCXK,"Great movie on various rescue operations around the world, and the people who help others.

5180421,3,B008RZPCXK,"I've bought a lot of these IMAX short 3D films lately. This one is the least liked. It looks to me like the 3D was shot a bit less professionally than other IMAX films. The 3D is somewhat uncomfortable to the eyes to watch. The subject matter is OK, but a little boring. If you want a true ""Eye Candy"" 3D movie, get IMAX: Under the Sea 3D.",1378684800,5,339,4.0
