7903255,4,B0000048VH,When I was a kid I watched this movie all the time.  I loved the songs and knew almost all of them from the whole video series.  This is an awesome movie for kids because it is entertaining an informational but also it can be enjoyable for adults.  I would reccommend this to anyone.,1130544000,,283,4.203703703703703
7903256,4,B0000048VH,"Fast moving, well edited, with humor and some catchy songs to go with its footage of lots of animals, from cute nocturnal bush babies leaping from tree to tree, to learning about the food chain with cheetahs and lions chasing their prey; it does not however include any gory scenes of animals being killed.

A large part of what makes this film entertaining (for adults as well, who will be surprised to learn a few new things too) is Dudley Moore's narration, which is quite funny sometimes, as he does his take on two well-known TV shows with  ""Africa's Most Wanted"" and ""As the Earth Turns"", and with a variety of voices and much enthusiasm, he's our tour guide as ""Mr. Spin"", an animated globe of the world.

Full of information for kids of all ages, what amazed me was realizing how different the stripes on zebras are (""no two zebras are alike""), and like large moving unique thumbprints, the way this segment is filmed, one can view their stripes and be amazed at the beauty and variety on God's green earth.

There is also a segment with Jane Goodall and her chimps, and we watch as they take the first steps in the usage of tools, when they fish termites out of a hole with a long stick, and smash nuts with a rock.

Well written by Kate Youngdahl and Jonathan Grupper, the songs are by Alan O'Day and Janis Liebhart, and total running time is 44 minutes.",1112918400,,1364,4.461847389558233
