8667723,4,B00LPRPHVY,"I'm still sorta one of the believers of ""porn with plot."" Anybody can search the web and find people having sex. ""What are people doing when they're not having their skin smacking each other."" Or, with the current anime coming from Japan, we can say this is what some of us WANT to see happen in a fanservicy anime title (as oppose to the weakness of wills, interruptions, and other supposed ""comedy"" ideas).

This 2-episode show was set for fail and gloom; a hostage take-over because of what could happen in real life, a hot-blooded (and hot-bodied) newscaster wanting a big scoop and such. I won't spoil how it ends. But it does its job at showing some hot tail, and making use of said hot tail.

This adult anime was dubbed during the time where a few companies were selling uncensored adult anime. A lot of outside influences wanted to shut it down. And because of what happened to John Sirabella (the guy who ran Media Blasters and its sub-company Kitty Media), said outside forces nearly succeeded. Hopefully, with him getting back on track after finishing ""Voodoo Church,"" Kitty Media can start licensing and dubbing adult anime again.",1407715200,8,1143,4.738693467336684
