7892323,3,6305617201,Dated but fun!  A nice review of Christmas movies.,1458691200,,50,4.555555555555555
7892324,5,6305617201,"I rented this from Netflix and after watching it started trying to find it online to buy it.  Obviously, it isn't being sold anymore except used (and costs too much!).  This is an interesting documentary showing most of the major Hollywood Christmas movies and concentrates basically on the older ones since that is when the classic Christmas movies were made.  I watched ""Christmas in Connecticut"" after seeing it on this and loved it!  What I think is funny is I don't really care for ""White Christmas"" finding it smaltzy and this says is is the most popular Christmas classic movie...but it's not my favorite!  I also ordered the ""LemonDrop Kid"" not even knowing about it until watching this!  I really enjoyed watching this review of the movies made!",1293148800,,754,4.8515625
7892325,5,6305617201,Any person who loves Christmas movies will like this documentary.  The only problem is that it will eventually become out-dated.  But if you like classic films and the old Rankin & Bass cartoons shown on TV every year then this is a DVD to watch.,1268092800,,246,4.444444444444445
7892326,5,6305617201,"Well, there's Jane Seymour trying to decide which Christmas movie to watch with her family. What's a star to do? This 1996 special produced for the Starz cable network is a survey of Christmas films made through the years. The show does an excellent job going over all the classics (including seven versions of A Christmas Carol) plus modern films while giving us teasing moments from many holiday titles you might have missed (Come to the Stable) or overlooked (the song ""Silver Bells"" originated in the Bob Hope film The Lemon Drop Kid). The 90-minute show instills interest in watching these films, but fair warning for those who haven't seen standards like It's a Wonderful Life--some endings are spoiled. It's nice to see some obscure songs in their entirety, including Shirley Temple singing ""That's What I Want"" in Stowaway and Martha Raye singing ""Silent Night"" in a deleted sequence from Four Jills in a Jeep. --Doug Thomas Description Join host Jane Seymour for a rare look at the century's most memorable holiday films. Over the years, Christmas movies have embraced the hearts and minds of audiences everywhere. A Hollywood Christmas is the definitive collection for Christmas movies including classics like ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" ""Miracle on 34th Street,"" ""White Christmas"" and seven versions of ""A Christmas Carol,"" ranging from 1935 to 1992. This collection also brings together scenes from contemporary Christmas films such as ""Home Alone,"" ""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" ""The Preacher's Wife,"" ""The Santa Clause"" and ""Edward Scissorhands."" This incredible collection is a must for every stocking!",1164931200,,1618,5.275193798449612
7892327,4,6305617201,"Jane Seymour does an outstanding job of introducing scenes from the brightest and best of Hollywood Christmas films. There are the real classics ""Miracle on 34th Street"" (the original, of course), ""White Christmas"", and ""It's a Wonderful Life."" The excerpts from seven versions of ""A Christmas Carol"" let you compare the various actors who played Scrooge. The best in my book is the 1951 version featuring Alister Sim. More recent highlights include ""Home Alone,"" and ""The Santa Claus."" It's a nice review of the way that Hollywood treats Christmas and should be part of everyone's Christmas DVD collection.",1101772800,,607,5.204081632653061
