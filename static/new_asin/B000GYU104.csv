8135326,4,B000GYU104,"Jem and the Holograms was a favorite of my dauhgter when she was young, and now my grandaughter loves it. The CD may not have quite the original quality of the original cartoon, but you have to consider this was about a 1985? cartoon that was put on to a CD so it was over 25 years old. Still it looked pretty dawg gone good to me. She-RA and the Popples are also on the CD so there's a variety",1327622400,,394,3.9375
8135327,5,B000GYU104,This is a great DVD for anyone who wants a couple of episodes of their favorite shows from childhood.  The episodes are not in any particular order however so do not expect them to flow. Other than that it is a great buy and my friends and I have really enjoyed them!,1246838400,,267,4.134615384615385
8135328,4,B000GYU104,"I'm not a kid. I'm definitely a kid at heart though! I grew up with Jem and She-Ra, so revisiting these stories brought me back to a simpler, more happy time in my life. I love watching these stories.
The only thing I can't make any sense of is The Popples. Although I did love the Popples when I was younger, now they seem a little creepy and a little out of place in this collection of girls kicking some butt.
Also, the dvd has some imperfections which makes it difficult to watch at times. I'm not sure if it was just MY copy or if others experienced similar occurences.",1215216000,2,574,4.2272727272727275
8135329,5,B000GYU104,"I LOVE THESE GIRLS RULE COLLECTIONS!! I WISH THEY WOULD MAKE MORE....MY FAVORITE IS POPPLES,AND I CANT FIND IT ANYWHERE ELSE ON DVD BUT ON THIS ONE!!",1211500800,,149,4.555555555555555
8135330,5,B000GYU104,"Unbelievable!  Getting a chance to see She-Ra Princess of Power and Jem & the Holograms all on the same DVD.  Now, that is what I call a compilation!  I can't believe I still remember some of the songs from Jem, like ""I got my eye on you.""  That's still one of my favorites.  As for She-ra, just plain WOW.  It's been years since I saw this and I see why it was one of my favorites growing up.  I hope Harmony Entertainment continues to make more of these DVDs.  Between getting the 1st volume and now this volume, I am finally getting a chance to view Jem again since all the Jem sets are gone.  Oh, Popples (yes, that same toy) is also on this DVD too!
