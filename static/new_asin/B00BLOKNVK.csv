5644710,5,B00BLOKNVK,"It is absolutely glorious when intelligent sci-fi not only re-emerges, but returns and flourishes with spectacular results. Tucked neatly into this technologically and sometimes extraterrestrial genre of film is time travel. While time travel films aren't always done right, when they are they make one hell of an impact; the ""Back to the Future"" films, the ""Terminator"" films, ""Donnie Darko,"" ""Time Bandits,"" ""Twelve Monkeys,"" ""Source Code,"" and the fantastic little Spanish film ""Timecrimes"" are just a few examples. Combine that potential with the impressive writer/director Rian Johnson and an incredible cast that includes Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bruce Willis, and Emily Blunt and you have one of the most anticipated films of the year on your hands with ""Looper.""

In the year 2044, time travel has not yet been invented but 30 years from now it will have been. After being labeled as illegal, the ability to leap through time is only available on the black market. People who criminal organizations want to get rid of are sent back to 2044 where hired guns called ""loopers"" dispose of them. Loopers make very good money and Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is living the good life. When a looper's contract nears its expiration, the mob sends back their future self who they then get rid of and have the next 30 years to live their life. It's called ""closing the loop."" But when Joe's future self (Bruce Willis) is sent back, his life is turned upside down.

While you may not be able to totally buy that Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a younger version of Bruce Willis based on looks alone (even with the use of prosthetics), Gordon-Levitt does deserve credit for developing the ability to act like Willis along with similar facial expressions, mannerisms, and body language. Bruce Willis' character is a really interesting piece of the puzzle. The older version of Joe is committing some of the most heinous crimes imaginable, but his reasoning for it is just. As you're shown his back story, you understand what he's going through and almost find yourself rooting for him. He's like a villain with heart.

Emily Blunt is really fantastic. This might be the most straightforward and emotional that she has ever been in any performance. The addition of her son Cid (Pierce Gagnon) may make or break the film for you as it goes down a path that may find you comparing it to other films. The Cid character is an intriguing one though as his emotions are out of control, but his intentions are good and he's fairly amusing more often than not. While Paul Dano doesn't get a whole lot of screen time, it's amazing that that underhanded smarminess he's often associated with is still able to shine through.

This is Rian Johnson's best work by a landslide and that's coming from someone who absolutely loves his first two films. While the concept is somewhat familiar, it's always going in places you don't expect them to go. Seth's (Paul Dano) side plot is around the time your jaw will hit the floor. The ending is really magnificent, as well. It feels tragic on one hand, but extremely fitting on the other. While the soundtrack seems to kind of pick and choose its moments to really stand out, there are a few instances where it's emotionally overwhelming. It will only get better in repeat viewings and listens.

""Looper"" is an astounding piece of cinema no matter how you slice it. Featuring fantastic performances from the entire cast, absorbing cinematography, and one of the most unique concepts for a film in quite some time, ""Looper"" is one of the most creative, intelligent, and unpredictable films of the year.",1348876800,227,3611,4.884176182707994
5644711,4,B00BLOKNVK,"I Compare this movie to inception because tht was the last sci-fi action movie I saw that was better than I was expecting (and I was expecting a lot). This is a solid adult sci-fi flick. The first act of the film is intriguing and shows a lot of promise. It plays out a little slower more in a drama fashion or the middle third of the film. And the third act is not as satisfying as it could have been.

As a reviewer on Rottentomatoes mentioned, this is like a mashup of other classic sci-fi films. Terminator, 12 Monkeys and Firestarter immediately spring to mind. It's a good movie, do not get me wrong, but I would go with low expectations and you might find that there are some interesting concepts at play (poor Seth).

Loved the way the film was shot. The audio mix is good and the editing is pretty great (Pulp Fiction style time structure). This will be a good Blu-Ray no doubt.",1348876800,2,887,4.3053892215568865
5644712,5,B00BLOKNVK,"It's been a long time since I felt complete satisfaction about a thriller/drama/science fiction time travel. This Awesome movie has it all. Time travel is utilized by hired killers, Bruce Willis and entire cast give outstanding acting performance. The thrilling story grabs your attention, and this film entertains from start to finish. Special Effects are Good, and this is one of the best science fiction films of the year. 'Looper' understands the visual power of violence. Overall, this movie is Intelligent and enjoyable. It aims to please all thriller/science fiction lovers. The drama is intense, and there's explosive action. Highly Recommended for all those who love time travel stories and science fiction. This is one I would watch again!",1348876800,4,749,5.302521008403361
5644713,4,B00BLOKNVK,"A mind game we all play with ourselves is, if we could go back in time and kill Hitler, would you? What if Hitler were a ten year old child? Are you killing a person who will be the mass murderer of millions or a ten year old? This is roughly the premise of ""Looper.""

""Looper"" stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Joe, a hit-man, who has it pretty easy as hitmen can have it, he sets out a plastic tarp in a secluded location and the hit appears and he kills them and disposes of the body. The `hits' have been transported back in time from the year 2073 by the mob. Joe is living the high criminal life, he has a money to spare, parties with strippers and has a drug addiction. The world around him is easily extrapolated from the world we live in now and seems on the verge of chaos, the poor roam the streets and people openly carry guns to ward off danger or perceived danger. Although the world doesn`t seem totally dystopian, large glittering cities are seen in the distance and China seems a shining jewel of the future.

Joe's life seems to be going better than most even though he's on the seamier side of crime and he seems to understand that. One of the hits that comes through the time portal is a middle-aged man who he recognizes as himself from the future, he hesitates a moment and doesn't kill his older self (Bruce Willis) and he escapes. Soon the mob is after Joe, both old and young, while the young Joe tries to elude the mob and find his older self and finish the hit. In a meeting Joe learns from his older self of a crime boss in the future called `the rainmaker' who has taken over all the mobs without an army and has murdered hundreds or thousands of those who got in his way in the future and he's closing the loop on the loopers sending their older selves back in time and having them kill 'themselves.'

Joe discovers one of the possible places `the rainmaker' grows up as a boy and goes to the house to wait for his older self to show up. In the mean time Joe meets the boy that will undoubtedly grow up to be `the rainmaker' and even though he knows what the boy will grow up to do, protects him from himself.

If this synopsis is a little dizzying don't worry, the movie isn't. It's written and directed by Rian Johnson and the future he envisions is terrifyingly real looking, the seedy sides of the city look seedy and the city's proper are gleaming jewels. Even though Joe's life can be seen in any gangster movie, there's some nice science-fiction touches to make ""Looper"" fresh. Jeff Daniels also appears as a crime boss from the future that has some darkly comic moments.

""Looper"" is like a gangster movie meets ""Terminator,"" and it will keep you wondering what will happen next, there doesn't seem to be any formula filmmaking here. When you leave the theater you may find yourself asking yourself is destiny fate? Is there redemption for a would-be mass-murderer if his past could be changed?",1348790400,2,2928,4.375
5644714,5,B00BLOKNVK,"Despite containing more paradoxes than the moles in a Whack-a-Mole game ""Looper"" may well be the best time travel movie in years and it connected with me because it seemed to be a choice by the Director to not spend too much time wrapped up in the question of whether his time travel methodology was scientifically accurate and instead spend his time in the conflicts, motivations and stress factors that would affect this group of men causing them to use time travel not for the betterment of mankind, but instead in this heinous fashion.

From the previews you get all the facts you need, the mob has time travel and they use to disappear people into the past because it's too difficult to hide a body in their future. If you are one of these past time hit-men you are a Looper and your contract ends when you ""close"" your loop (Kill your future self). What makes ""Looper"" so interesting is that the main story line takes place between 10 and 30 years in the future, making it both a SciFi movie and a time travel movie.

I highly recommend you see this movie, Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance is brilliance, in point of fact I think he may do Bruce Willis better even than Bruce Willis does and the action scenes, although sometimes ""action movie"" ridiculous (including one scene where Bruce Willis holds a body much larger than himself in front of himself as a human shield as he runs down a hall shooting), help keep this movie fast and well paced despite it being about why the characters are doing what they are doing.

For the ladies, there is also a nice sized subplot between Emily Blunt and Joseph Gordon-Levitt that is evokes such movies as ""Witness"" and ""The Bodyguard"", so guys don't forget your girls.",1348790400,2,1718,4.607843137254902
5644715,4,B00BLOKNVK,"The masses will be disappointed. The trailer misrepresents the experience. There is action, blood and guts. But this is smart SF. One needs to bring a functioning brain. Because the real story is about a mother's love, or lack thereof. All actors do an excellent job. Scenes are stolen with understated professionalism.  This is really good. Some pacing issues. But a really smart, entertaining, thought provoking film.",1348790400,2,419,5.253731343283582

5644721,3,B00BLOKNVK,"Another time travel movie, and an action movie at that. Terminator or even Timecop would be my favorite of this genre. Im tired of time travel fiction in general though. It's been done. And It quickly becomes illogical if you examine the plot/rules too closely.

Not only can you insert yourself into a past state of the Universe, your pocket change, underwear, and shoes come with you! And this Universe`s future is connected to your past! Or viceversa! But only a little bit! You can have lunch with Dad, just make sure he doesn't break up with Mom....... ahhh sillyness!

Anyway what Looper offers up is the idea that your younger self and your older self could meet and be enemies. Each has advantages over the other.
And it had decent action, fx, and acting. I still don't get the main primesce of the movie; that sending rival crooks back in time to be executed is somehow useful. Oh well, its not that important to the story.",1520985600,,932,4.574850299401198

You know.. if time travel were a thing.

Barring all nonsensical plot holes, this movie feels like a jumbled mess. It seems like they mashed together various ideas and crammed it all into one film, if you ignore all the blunders (heh, get what I did there..) I guess you can enjoy it.

Calling it 3.5 stars overall would probably be more accurate,

Some of the action scenes were cheesy,
as were some of the plot elements,
but the story itself was fairly interesting, compelling, and done decently for what was probably not a big budget movie.

Character interaction was decent, very good at times, and two dimensional at other times.

I did like it's pretty unique take on a subject already touched on by countless other movies,

5644844,5,B00BLOKNVK,"This is a very good sci-fi film that focuses on time travel, how it is misused and the consequences. The disc contains a discussion by the director about the film. The film is very good, but somewhat complicated. There are many subplots and a plethora of gimmicks.
Assassins in the future are called loopers because they loop around. Since it is hard to dispose of killed people in the future the bodies are transported to the past by time travel and loopers stationed in the past get rid of the bodies.
But there are problems. One is that in the future time travel is prohibited. Another is that loopers cannot retire. If they want to quite, another looper is sent to kill them and their loop is terminated. Still another problem is that a man in the future called the rain man wants to stop the program and kill all the loopers. So, among much else, loopers in the past want to kill the rain man while he is a child so they won't be killed, but they do not know who he is.
Still another problem, a young drug addict in the past who is a looper is told to kill a man and discovers that the man is his older self. This older self wants to go back in time and save his wife from being killed, for she was killed in the past.
Meanwhile, to further complicate matters, the man's younger self is falling in love with another woman, if he maries he and has a child, the future will change dramatically.",1473897600,,1397,4.275471698113208

OK I picked the movie to see Emily Blunt.  Liked her in Edge of Tomorrow but her acting was rather limited there.  She does a bit better job, the role allowed for it, but she still comes across some what acting the role rather than being the person.",1473465600,2,718,4.296296296296297

5644853,2,B00BLOKNVK,"I'll be upfront and say I'm writing this review just to rant about the movie with no real goal of changing anyone's mind. I don't have much to say about the product specifically, other than I didn't see a lot that merited a BD release over DVD, though to be fair I didn't look at much even of the movie itself.

SPOILERS BELOW: NONSENSICAL MUTILATION TORTURE

I accidentally saw the ending first, so that might have affected my opinion somewhat, but it really does not make sense from anything other than the Hollywood Time Travel perspective (""it works because it looks cool""). The ending means the entire movie is paradoxed out of happening, but as a general rule I can forgive that on a larger scale if the rest of the movie is entertaining enough.

The rest of the movie is not entertaining enough... or, at least, the first half-hour or so isn't.

The beginning is okay, setting up this scenario where time travel is both real and ""VERY illegal"" in the future, so criminals send people back in time, where ""Loopers"" kill and dispose of the bodies that technically do not exist.  Then one Looper is sent his own future self to kill (""closing the loop""), but he can't do it, so his future self escapes.  This is the part that's stupid and made me instantly lose interest.

So the crime syndicate hunts down the younger self and start cutting up his arm, which causes the scarring to appear on the future self's arm in the form of a message telling him to be at a certain address in 15 minutes. Okay, it's an interesting concept, even though it ""realistically"" would've been something the younger self grew up with and would be meaningless at the point the scarring starts to appear.  Then his pinky and ring finger vanish, then his nose... uh, okay, gross, but we're getting the message.

When he steals a car and his right foot spontaneously vanishes--okay, that's it, you've lost me entirely, movie.  How did he survive thirty-odd years with one foot and still escape?  Then his other foot goes, then the rest of his hands, arms up to elbow, legs to his knees--by the time he's at his destination, he's screaming incoherently because they cut out his tongue, too, I assume, and they open the door to shoot him in the head, with the younger self being cut up on a table in the back of the room.

Like, the mutilation alone has disgusted me to where I've been unable to focus on anything else all day.  If Looper was a horror movie, I'd say that's my own fault, but I was told this time manipulation aspect is only used one other time, so the scene only exists for this one psychological mind-screw.  Even knowing the rest of the movie can't get worse than that as far as things to make me squeamish, I can't bring myself to ""close the loop"" and see how the rest plays out because I feel so betrayed by the horrific violence PLUS the complete absurdness of the quadriplegic future self paradox (not to mention, by that point, why is the future self even going there if he only knows he's going to die?--other than panic making people stupid).

Two stars vs. one because I'm giving the benefit of the doubt for the parts I didn't watch, and also because the draw of the movie (Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis as the same person) is admittedly well done, though it'd be one star if zero stars were possible because the mutilation is just too horrific, and it sickens me that people find this entertaining.  I guess that explains a lot about America, though, finding pleasure in someone else's misery.",1472774400,,3507,4.542857142857143

5644884,5,B00BLOKNVK,"Well . . . this little piece of dystopian sci-fi action-adventure stars two of my favorite actors - Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt - and hits all the other points that a dystopian sci-fi action-adventure film needs to hit.

""What are those points,"" you may well ask. Indeed, this review would be worthless without a little explication.

First, the dystopia should be believable without having to be explained in overt detail. In LOOPER the future is just a little more like the present only dirtier, kind of the way we expect it to be. Police seem to be nonexistent or otherwise occupied. The people take care of themselves. Maybe it's an extreme libertarian future? Who knows? The important thing is, we don't need a lot of explanation to get it. It tells it's own story as part of the ongoing narrative.

Second, the time travel tech is NOT the center of the story, it is merely a means to an end within the story. Of course it would be outlawed once discovered. Of course only the nastiest of the nasty would get control over it. Of course, they would use it to their own purposes. All of this fits within the story line without introducing conflicts.

Third, the acting has to be believable. Everyone with screen time does a good or better job with their lines. Even the minor characters keep it together and add goodness to the overall production. Now, some of that may be due to really good editing but, without seeing what lies on the cutting room floor, I'll never know for sure.

The fourth and, for me, most important point, is that the lead players worked very well together. The interactions of the Old Joe with the Young Joe are nearly flawless. Sara, the single-mom caring for her once-abandonded son against all comers while also learning how to handle his telekinetic abilities and childhood propensity to rage, is engaging on all fronts. She is played as neither to good nor too bad. The scene where she mimes smoking a cigarette made me want to light one up.

The writing is excellent. It makes Joe grow in a way that is unexpected and not in some kind of weird unrealistic way. The bit of voice-over provided during his moment of clarity is perfect.

All in all, an excellent film for the genre. Enjoy it!",1464566400,,2231,4.604534005037784

But no, this is the actual script to this turkey. I think they should of made Jeff Daniels and some other mobsters the bad guys or responsible for the future events. That would have made more sense than a kid with Carrie powers. Instead we waste a whole part of this movie on that garbage and I feel again disappointed by a movie that the critics gushed over.

And the ending, oh boy, yeah, I think Levitt solves nothing. I mean the kid's still probably going to grow up to be a dysfunctional killer or mobster or whatever. I don't think anything Levitt did would change that. In fact he probably made it worse.

Very disappointing movie. Uneven and stupid at times.",1464307200,2,1118,4.524752475247524
5644888,4,B00BLOKNVK,"Looper is a dark film set in 2044, with a league of assassins formed by a group thirty years in the future. Time travel hasn't been invented in 2044, but will be in the future. There is the beginning of telekinetic ability in some people, however, which has a bearing to the plot. The people of the future want people from their time killed and the bodies disposed of in 2044, so people are captured, a hood pulled over their head, and bricks of silver tucked in the back of their shirt. They are sent back in time to a certain place at a certain time, where the assassin is waiting to kill them and collect the silver in payment. But something is happening, someone has appeared in the future from out of nowhere, named the Rainmaker, and he has taken control and wants the assassins killed. He has the old assassins captured and sent back to 2044 where they are murdered and the bodies disposed of. But one man, played by Bruce Willis, escapes. His younger self in 2044 was to kill him. But Willis character knows what is going on and plans to turn the tables and find the boy who will eventually become the Rainmaker and kill him before all the assassins are killed.

Thats basically the plot, though it is a bit deeper. The first half of the movie was dark and confusing, with drugs, sex and assassinations. But the second half becomes clearer to the audience, and the plot solidifies and it actually has a well thought out ending. Characters all looked alike, and undistinguishable from one another until the movie moves into the second half. If it weren't for the first half being such a waste, I would have given the movie a higher rating just for the second half.",1464134400,,1671,4.46078431372549

5644900,5,B00BLOKNVK,"Five BRILLIANT Stars! Writer/director Rian Johnson's sci-fi vision ""Looper"" is an amazing look at the near future, the far future of crime, and time travel. The story begins in Kansas, 2040, where Joe is a ""looper"" who kills people sent back to his time from the future by crime lords. So the victim is put into an illegal time machine and sent back to 2040 for elimination, with due payment in bars of silver attached to the victim. Loopers are living good, partying hard, and using drugs administered in a unique way. But there is an eventual price to be paid by each looper. Joe is great at it, but trouble lays ahead from two sources: a friend and himself. Starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bruce Willis, Emily Blunt, Noah Segan, Piper Perabo, Pierce Gagnon, Garret Dillahunt, Qing Xu, Tracie Toms, and Jeff Daniels. Full of amazing sights, chases, and concepts. Five DAZZLING Stars. (TriStar, FilmDistrict, EndGame. HD. Color. CC. X-Ray. Time-1:58:51.

There were a couple of things I didn't understand about some of the minor time manipulation consequences, but they were pretty minor to me.  I've watched it three times now and I still love it.  The one thing that put me off since the first time is the only special effect that jumped out at me as being totally off (Don't laugh): People shooting a .454 casull or 45-70 in a magnum research BFR revolver one handed with about ZERO recoil!  I've shot a .44 mag for years, and it has some recoil.  These cartridges are very powerful! If Dirty Harry watched this it might say something like ""This handgun will rip your hand clean off."".  When filming sequences with firearms, have an expert help direct if you have never shot one similar.  It's pretty common sense though, if you look at the shells in Kid Blue's cartridge belt.  A typical 9mm pistol would recoil more than the BFR's in this flick.",1457049600,,971,4.566473988439307

5644936,4,B00BLOKNVK,"I hate reading reviews of time travel movies where pseudo-intellectuals think that they are all of a sudden quantum physicists because they've found a paradoxical plot hole. It's one of the reasons why I've never tried to review any of the Back to the Future movies. There are such problems in Looper, and Willis himself tries to brush them off by telling us not to think about it. However obvious these logic problems are it still makes you think more than the average action fare, which I why I am giving it higher score.

In a future that is so heavily surveilled the only way to kill someone is to send them back into the past and have them taken out by a hitman. A hitman who will eventually take out his own future self one day, thus closing the ""loop"". Joseph Gordon-Levitt (an actor I am not really keen on at all) is one of such hitmen. When faced with his old self (Bruce Willis, actually making an effort for a change) he is outwitted and vows to hunt down the old man before his mob bosses lose faith in him.

But there's a twist. The dark future is ruled by robots and old Willis is here to take out Sarah Connor, or something like it. This secondary plotline doesn't completely fit with the premise but director Rian Johnson just about makes it work as long as you don't have any ridiculous expectations. The atmosphere and cinematography are very nice and the Louisiana locations make for a refreshing change from New York or California. There's not much else to bring you back to it though, but I appreciate the film for what it is and for the quieter approach to the material which would otherwise be a loudmouth disaster in lesser hands.

Only hardcore Caddyshack fans will understand my review title.

I'll watch any film with any script and any cast when it's this creative and well done.  We'd be at the local cinema three time a week if they were there.

In a future where time travel has been invented, mob bosses send their enemies back to the past to be killed by loopers. Joe lives the high life eliminating whomever the mob bosses send back, no questions asked. Which works fine, until they send future-Joe back to be disposed of and he escapes.

What did I think?

A taut, well-paced thrill ride, this feels like one of the freshest takes on the whole time travel schtick in a long time. The script sets up the sci-fi premise of the tale, before cleverly shifting the focus onto the characters, giving Looper an emotional weight I wasn't expecting. Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a great young Bruce Willis, and Bruce Willis plays a great old Bruce Willis. And who doesnt love Bruce Willis? Serious acting props also have to go to the creepy kid (Pierce Gagnon).

It doesnt pay to look too closely at the logic behind this flick; there are holes in the time travel theory and thinking about them may make your brain explode. But really, when a movie is this entertaining, who gives a damn about logic?",1431734400,,1064,4.613756613756614

5645043,1,B00BLOKNVK,"I wanted to like this movie as I only got it based on a recommendation that it was good, the person that recommended it as good later said it was only OK. However, I found it long and boring in a lot of places and feel that if they had better editing it would be a better movie. Had Bruce Willis older self killed the Rainmaker than it would have been a much better ending. Instead it leaves an extremely dangerous kid that kills people whenever he gets angry, which he had killed the sister of his mother that had been raising him. Maybe it was meant that the Rainmaker was then not going to become the Rainmaker but I got the impression that there was nothing to stop that now, after all he had been killing anyone when he got angry. They would have been better off digitally having a younger face of Bruce Willis on Joseph Gordon-Levitt's body because he looked nothing like Bruce Willis when he was younger, he just looked extremely odd.

Potential spoilers but the movie is over 3 years old so if you haven't seen it don't waste your time

Basically in the future there are 5 mob families and they send people they want killed back in time where the Loopers kill them and take the silver bars off them and trade it for cash. Eventually the Looper's older self is sent back for his younger self to kill in which they get gold bars and this is called closing the loop. They then get about 30 years until they are sent back to die. Eventually the Rainmaker kills all 5 mob families and takes over. Bruce Willis isn't going to his death willingly and fights and gets away. He goes after the potential Rainmaker as children to eliminate the threat. His younger self has a vision and thinks that his older self killing the Rainmaker's mom spurs the kid to become the Rainmaker and makes the idiotic decision to kill himself which means his older self never came back and opening a major plot hole and paradox, not to mention no guarantee that the rainmaker would not become a killer, or even kill more than he already had..",1430524800,4,2022,4.375

5645077,4,B00BLOKNVK,"Very good & unique Sci Fi action movie.  This is a rare example when Hollywood's sci fi writing teams actually get something that has never been done before, and do it right.  My only problem with the film was Emily Blunt's character and role, and this stupid ""X-Men"" slash Star Wars ""the Force"" power she and her kid had.  That did not need to be in this, which is why I give this film four stars instead of five.

 A very intense and interesting sci fi question is brought up and portrayed in this original film, ""What would your younger self say, handle, or do dealing with your older self?"" Very weird and well played out in this movie, and they had me well fooled which I liked because usually I can pick out where characters and movie plots led to.

Basic plot: In the near future the world is in economic and moral chaos, where virtually everyone is unemployed and society has gone to complete dystopian trash land.  A younger Bruce Willis, played very well by Joseph Gorden Levitt, is basically a complete low life immoral young party animal whose job it is to hunt down and kill for money ""Loopers"", fugatives who try to escape from the future through a time machine and hide in the past.  Levitt has no mercy nor moral apathy for the people he is hired to hunt down, and even betrays his best friend while blowing his money on drugs and hookers who care nothing about him.  His life and attitude on human decency is basically in the toilet, until he is given the assignment of his life, to hunt down and kill the future version of himself, none other then Mr. Bruce Willis.

 Bruce Willis, unlike other victims of Levitt, is smart and still skilled enough to escape, where he goes on his own seek and destroy mission trying to hunt down a future super gangster villain who in Levitt's timeline is a little boy with his mother Emily Blunt.

 This movie has a weird but awesome soundtrack, and the plot turns had me guessing every different way.  Very entertaining, especially the way Levitt imitates Willis so darn well.  Thumbs up & B+ for ""Looper"" a cool and refreshingly rated R sci fi epic.",1425686400,3,2103,4.468586387434555

 Four saw blades for this innovative, imaginative, important and ultimately wise film.  Producer and star Joseph Gordon-Levitt is re-united with writer/director Rian Johnson.  They worked together in another Rian Johnson writer/director project, the clever and very well done inde flick Brick in 2006.  Gordon-Levitt was young enough then to play a high school student in a film noir crime movie set in a modern day California high school.  It was brilliant, as is Looper.
 Writer Johnson has the narrator say something about a woman who would die for her child and a man who would kill for his wife.  This is a movie about the very largest issues of life, of ethics and morality, love and death.  But, thanks to the genius of Rian Johnson, it is wrapped up in a fast paced science fiction film with a complicated, plausible plot.  How fun is that?
 Gordon-Levitt is a hard case hit man.  In 2042 his job is to dispatch victims sent from thirty years in the future.  The mob in 2072 gets rid of bodies by sending them back in time, still alive.  The looper is a hit man who greets the transported with a blast from a blunderbuss.  It is all very neat from the point of view of the future crime lords.  No body, no crime.  The looper knows that at some point he will be asked to close the loop.  That is, he will be forced to murder his future self.  But he gets 30 years of high times and for the street raised youngsters it seems to be a splendid arrangement.
 Bruce Willis plays the future hit man who returns to be slaughtered by his own younger self, only to escape.  We are constantly dealing with time travel paradoxes and that keeps us thinking while the mayhem continues to unroll.  Paul Dano (outstandingly creepy in There Will Be Blood) plays an unlucky looper.  The delightfully named Piper Parabo is featured as an unlucky but very good looking hooker.  I regularly watch her TV show but did not recognize her, so well into her character had she dissolved.  In the dystopian future most of the women we meet are prostitutes, the men either killers or victims.  Jeff Daniels is a crime boss sent from the future to oversee the looper operation, a role which he plays with understated menace and sudden ferocity.  Finally, I would mention the very talented Garret Dillahunt (Raising Hope on TV) who makes memorable a small role as one of Jeff Daniels gunmen.
 As a science fiction film, this is much better than the recent re-make of Total Recall, and on a budget of only $30 million.  It has taken in a worldwide gross of $133 million which should make producer Gordon-Levitt a ton of cash.  This is the hard working actors third major film this year after well received roles in The Dark Knight Rises and the quite recent Premium Rush.
 This film is rated R for violence, murder and naked people.  It runs one hour and 58 minutes.  This is the beginning of the season of great movies.  Looper is one of them.",1424390400,,2928,4.5353728489483744

Of course there are a few glitches with the whole ""time travel"" thing  which the characters treat, play with, and sardonically address directly in the script but as my headline says: this is not a time travel movie.

It's a movie about people, and love, and choices. Would you rather be the tortured or the torturer? is one way of saying it. Or take it this way: if each of us makes that oh-so-sad (""ah, regrettable, really ... had to do it though, you understand"") choice in our own lives  while extolling virtue for ""people"" or ""humanity"" ... do the math: we'll never get there.

5645133,1,B00BLOKNVK,"Story was intriguing, but very bad execution and movie falls apart. Things I did NOT like: time travel is okay, but introducing psychic powers and Telekinesis takes the movie to unrealistic heights. Might as well throw in aliens too. If they kept out the part about the X-Men powers of the Cid/Rainmaker character, the film would have been more enjoyable. The second thing I did not like was the character development. I'm sorry but I just didn't buy Bruce Willis character falling in love with some random Chinese lady who flipped him off at a bar. WTH was that all about? And this is becomes what drives the character to go back in time to take out baby Hitler makes no sense. They should have spent more time fleshing out this motive to make it more believable.

5645145,5,B00BLOKNVK,"In writer/director Rian Johnsons third film after Brick and The Brothers Bloom, the invention of time travel occurs sixty years from now. After it is deemed a hazard and made illegal, the mob continues to use it to get rid of its undesirables.

Mobsters capture the target and send him back in time 30 years to a specified location where a killer awaits their arrival. These contract killers are called loopers. The looper must execute the target when he arrives and collect a payment of silver strapped to his back before promptly disposing of the body in a furnace. Its violent stuff, but the mob never was humane.

One such looper is Joe (Joseph Gordon Levitt), a hard-edged drug addict who lives alone in a broken society 30 years from now where everyone is armed to the teeth and either rich or poor. There is no middle class, and everything has gone to hell.

When a loopers contract is up, and the mob is finished with him, he is sent a unique target: Himself. When that happens, a looper receives a huge payment and spends the next 30 years awaiting his death. This process is called closing the loop. Joe notices a lot of his fellow loopers are being ordered to close their loops,  and learns that there is one particular person, nicknamed the rainmaker, who is responsible.

Once the inevitable happens and Joes older self (Bruce Willis) shows up and manages to escape, Looper becomes a dark, complex thriller in which old Joe is trying to track down the rainmaker, who is a child in young Joes time, and young Joe is trying to kill himself from the future in order to avoid bone-shattering consequences from his mobster boss, Abe (Jeff Daniels).

As Joe the looper, Gordon-Levitt transforms into a character that is physically and behaviorally convincing as a man who grows up to be Bruce Willis. Willis, a great actor who seldom gets to show his real chops, brings much of the emotional weight to the movie as old Joe, who does not face lightly the self-assigned mission to kill the child who will become the rainmaker. In this sense, Looper recalls the philosophical question, if you could travel through time and kill Hitler as a child, would you?

There are also some solid performances from Daniels, Paul Dano as another looper who suffers a disturbing fate and Emily Blunt as the mother of one of old Joes child targets, a boy named Cid, played by incredibly intense seven-year-old actor. This kid can be sweet one moment and frightening the next, and shows the many notes he can play in Looper.

The abuse of the invention of time travel, and the consequences that follow are great cinematic elements, and in terms of the action/Sci-Fi genre, Looper is one of the best time travel movies I have ever seen. Johnson is an imaginative filmmaker with a vivid knack for storytelling and an eye for action that is sharp and refreshing in its clarity  the special effects in this movie are spot on, used sparingly and jarring in their realism.

There are elements of James Camerons The Terminator and dozens of other time travel movies in this film but, even so, Looper is one of the most exciting, original films of 2012, a fascinating vision of how time travel could be used in a practical sense by bad people. If invented, it could also potentially be used to kill Hitler as a child. The question is, would you do it?",1418342400,,3331,4.6305084745762715

5645193,3,B00BLOKNVK,"I found this 2012 SF film honest and quite watchable, but nothing more. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

Time travel was invented in 2074, but immediately outlawed - as result, only criminals use it. One of those uses is to send people whom criminal bosses want to be rid off in the past, so they are killed there, without leaving any traces in the present... As there is no travelling in the future, no one can return from such a voyage... This film tells basically the story of a hit man who in 2044 ""welcomes"" such time travelers and once ""welcomed"", gets rid of their bodies...

This hitman is a very average Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and in principle his story wouldn't be very interesting if it was not for a twist in the whole story which I will let you discover by yourself. Let's just say that the character played by Bruce Willis will have something to do with this whole thing...

Later, after some tribulations, Joe will meet a young woman named Sara (Emily Blunt), a single mother who struggles to make a living on a rather underperforming farm - and then things will finally get REALLY interesting...

This is not a bad film and I don't regret that I saw it, but it is not really anything very special. Yes, there are some nice twists, some of which I actually didn't see coming and yes, there are some really good scenes showing aspects of time travel which are rarely shown on the screen. But, with the exception of one really drastic and SHOCKING development, don't expect any amazing fireworks. Also, action scenes are so so, with ""bad guys"" hardly able to hit anything (sigh... what else is new?).

For my personal taste, the one character that really makes this film worth watching is Sara, played perfectly by Emily Blunt, definitely one of the best (and best looking) actresses of recent years. Sara is a complex and not entirely nice, but summa summarum rather attaching person and the calm and low-drama but still heroic back-breaking effort she makes every day to take care of her troubled child, her dilapidated farm and her messy life is something worth watching.

All in all, I am glad that I watched this film, but I am not going to buy the DVD, as it is really a thing to see once.",1413417600,,2239,4.557213930348259

5645204,3,B00BLOKNVK,"Looper is a science fiction/adventure film about how gangsters would use time travel if they could. The premise is mildly interesting, In your typical vaguely dystopian future time travel is invented, but outlawed and used only in secret by brutal gangsters who want to dump the body after killing someone. The modus operandi is to capture the person to be killed, tie him up send him back to the ""past"", actually this would be the movies ""present"" (specifically the year 2044) and then a hit man immediately executes him. The body then is expeditiously disposed of. Payment to the hit man is made via silver bars strapped to the prisoners back. At some point the hit mans career is ""over"" and he himself is slated for execution, and his future self is sent back to the past and he must execute himself. This ""closes the loop"".  The hit men here are called ""loopers"". The plot of this movie centers around what happens when a looper sent back to the past ""escapes"". As one might imagine the criminal gangs running this operation are pretty unhappy with both loopers and want to kill them both. The adventure centers around the younger self ( played here by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) simultaneously trying to hunt down his future self ( played by Bruce Willis) and also evade the criminal gangs out for both of them. Of course other people get involved in the cross fire, including a single mother ( Emily Blunt) and her child Its an interesting concept. Fans of science fiction will see plot elements taken from a number of other films, particularly this is a little reminiscent of ""Logan's run"" in which a hit man also become a target"" and of course the Terminator series, especially the original Terminator, in which time travelers are also engaged in the same sort of cat and mouse game and there are plot elements involving altering the ""past"" to change the ""future"".

The challenge for movies involving time travel is to handle the ""time travel paradoxes"" well. One of these paradoxes is that if characters travel back into time and alter the past you change the future, but this may negate the travel into the past. So if you prevent Lincoln from being shot then Lincoln lives to old age in the future, then our time traveler who saved Lincoln would not have a reason to go back into the past since Lincoln was never shot... but then Lincoln gets shot.. and we have some sort of endless loop where the Universe implodes.. or something like that. In any case movies have various tricks to address these paradoxes. For example they may put constraints on time travel, like the movie ""About Time"" or use other plot devices. The key however is to be consistent with the ""rules"" the story contains regarding time travel. Some movies do this very well such as The original ""Terminator"" and ""About Time"", and some foul it up.  This movie fouls it up very badly.  Once this starts to happen you begin to identify plot contradictions, along the lines of ... well according to the movies own conception of time travel, this could not happen"", etc etc. This eventually makes the whole movie a little silly. On the other hand finding these internal contradictions is mildly amusing, kind of like word search. Somewhere between a 2 stars and 3 stars, but don't miss a nice night out for this. Useful for a winter night when the temperature is around 5 below and you have nothing to read.",1412121600,,3376,4.66890756302521

5645216,2,B00BLOKNVK,"I liked the concept here, with the characters trying to escape their own future, and the cast is excellent. However, the movie alternated between short bursts of action and long periods of dialog and failed to maintain a balance. The script also wasn't very engaging and it was difficult to feel any emotional involvement with the characters.

The main problem I had with it was that the dialog was very quiet, almost whispering, and the action sequences, including the incidental music, were extremely loud. If I raised the sound level to the point where I could hear the verbal exchanges comfortably, the action sequences, which often occurred suddenly and without warning, were sufficient to cause my wife to come in from elsewhere in the house (she doesn't do SciFi) and ask what was wrong. In the end fiddling around with the volume constantly was just too much trouble to allow me to enjoy the movie and I gave up. I'll probably watch the remaining quarter or so that I didn't see when my wife is out just so I see how it ends.

It's a pity that this wasn't put together better, because it's an idea with a lot of possibilities.",1410566400,,1134,4.63681592039801

5645269,1,B00BLOKNVK,"This is a good innovative movie with an original storyline.
However, as with numerous other blurays, the sound balance is a huge letdown.
It seems bluray manufacturers only concentrate on the sound quality of the special
effects, eg. gunshots, moving car or ship engine sounds, explosions, thunderous
roars of monsters, etc...
The dialogue audibility is totally ignored. I am glad other reviewers also commented
on this aspect of the Looper bluray. There were many parts of the speech moments
when you could not hear what the actors were saying; it was virtually like silent whispers.
You have to turn the volume way up to slightly discern what the hell was spoken!!
When the gunshots happen after this scene, then you had it, as the bloody loud horrendous
gunshot sounds or the background music score can  even bring an office block down.
Blurays like Avatar and Elysium had very well sound balance where dialogue and the special
sound effects were rightly tuned to one's enjoyment. The special effects sound in these blurays
did not have to be overbearing, and yet they were loud enough with bass power to beautifully
accentuate the sounds of gunshots, explosions, etc...
I have read alot of reviewers comments on the horrible inaudibility of dialogues in blurays, but
why do we paying customers have to suffer this damn blight caused by the studios who made
these blurays.
There is a short commentary in the making of the ""Das Boots"" bluray which explained that the
volume of the speech level actually could be adjusted by the bluray makers during the manufacturing
stage.
This may necessitate extra cost, which apparently the manufacturers are not willing to spend on.
It is as if the studios are treating us like 5 year olds, or even mobsters and gangsters who only know
how to appreciate the thunderous booming special effects sounds, but do not understand or
require the speech aspect of the film.
At the cinemas, the sound balance of the movies are crystal clear. Thus there is no excuse why
blurays can only attain good picture quality, but very bad sound quality.
Years from now, the blurays will get this defect cleared. But then, we the paying customers would
look like fools for having paid a high price for a lousy product now.
The low one star rating reflects the very poor audio quality of the bluray, but the film itself is good.",1401667200,14,2346,4.835820895522388
5645270,4,B00BLOKNVK,"Director Rian Johnson likes film noir. He went through his own film noir craze growing up in southern Cal, and his first big feature ('Brick') was informed by film noir sensibilities: guys and girls in trouble, a central crime figure, and a fist full of violence. 'Looper' is no different, despite all the hoopla about time travel, and a few futuristic landscapes and clever, self-levitating motorcycles. When you get right down to it, Looper wears its noir on its sleeve: the entire drama is sparked by love for a woman (exotic, of course), there is a nasty,  central criminal mastermind (whose identity is kept a mystery for most of the film), and a fair number of bullets flying as things get sorted out. Rian Johnson also likes working with Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who was a central figure in 'Brick' as well.  The casting of Bruce Willis as JGL's alternate self (more about this shortly) can only invite comparison to 'Twelve Monkeys', but Terry Gilliam's fantasy world looks completely different, and should not color your expectations of 'Looper', which is grounded in more earthly concerns.

Yes, the major wrinkle in 'Looper' is time travel. The 'now' for this film is the year 2044 - where, we are told repeatedly, time travel has not been invented yet. Joseph Gordon-Levitt lives in 2044 and he's a trained assassin.  Time travel is invented sometime over the following 30 years. Bruce Willis is JGL thirty years later and returns to 2044 for the unfinished film noir business regarding the exotic female. He's mad and out for vengeance on account of the criminal mastermind from 2074, who did something nasty. Bruce Willis 'loops' into 2044, and the two 'versions' of our hero meet, share breakfast at the diner, and figure out what they're going do about the Bad Guy, so they can stop him from perpetrating the nastiness in 2074. When watching this drama unfold, it's tempting to make too much of this time 'looping'. It's really just as simple as I have laid out here. That is what this movie is about. It's not about the time machine (a device which is never seen), it's not about life in 2074 per se (which is illustrated only in a segment which sets up the Bad Guy problem, and does not look all that disarming). I'm not sure what I would do when sitting down to bacon and eggs with 'me' from 30 years in the future, but hey, this is what Bruce and Joe are confronted with. The film's ending - which I will not divulge - is just about the only way out of the dilemma posed by the narrative. To be fair to that central villain, you can see why he might have borne a grudge.

A major felicity with this production is the interaction of JGL with Bruce Willis. JGL managed to get some of BW's mannerisms and personality down, so despite the difference in looks, the viewer has no issues with the idea that they are two individuals inhabiting the same character, face-to-face. Some of the visuals and props do seem a bit derivative: the 2074 henchmen remind me a bit too much of the 'tuners' from Alex Proyas' 'Dark City' (that noir influence again), but by and large the film benefits from very limited use of futuristic setups (again, I maintain this is not really intended to be a sci-fi film). Emily Blunt lends terrific support as a young single mother in 2044.

The sound and visuals are of high caliber. There is a worthwhile feature commentary (Johnson, JGL, and Blunt - no Willis) and making-of feature. Johnson and JGL have formed a certain artistic bond, and it's rewarding to see this illustrated in these extras.",1401062400,,3535,4.657051282051282

Add Willis to the list, with one caveat. Most of his movies have become 'direct to video' affairs. His only paycheck films are the tired Die Hard movies. The rest, mostly junk.

It is rare these days that a movie surprises me, but this one has become one of my new favorites.  The idea is fresh and new, the casting was just right, and the pace of the story was easy to follow and become invested in.  Even though this movie is technically a futuristic sci fi drama, there was not an overload of special effects to distract you.  One of the best things about this movie was the child actor that played the character of Cyd.  For such a young boy he showed a wide range of emotions, and I could not help but love him.  The ending of the movie came with a twist that was both happy and sad, more so because I became so invested in the characters.  The plotline may seem silly, an assassin who kills people sent back from future until one day he is forced to kill his older self, but the movie is about how the choices we make today have lasting effects on our future, and if we knew about them how and would we change them.

 All on a Saturday night

In the year 2042, Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) has a unique profession as a ""Looper""; he dispatches people from the future for the mob. After thirty years on the job a Looper is retired by being sent back 30 years in time to himself for the purpose of being dispatched. Older Joe (Bruce Willis) is fine with this until an inappropriate shot dispatches the love of his life. So now he must go back and correct the system by removing the person who made this shot possible.

Will he succeed yes or no? In either case what will be the outcome? Will younger Joe cow-down to his wishes or learn something from this experience? We watch this presentation and wonder what we would do if we were either Joe. We too must make decisions in life and this movie may help us or not in making those decisions. In any case it's worth watching this movie at least a couple of times.

The story is really about relationships and choices. It is not really a sci-fi story about time travel. The time thing is just one dimension to help show the outcome of the choices we make.

The presentation even though having lots of action does not contain a lot of gratuitous gore. It also does not rely on a lot of CGI. There may be a tad too much background music but not enough to distract from the presentation.

There is a big logic flaw. I cannot go into detail without placing a spoiler. But the trigger that created the antagonist could not have happened the first time around in the loop. You not let this distract you from the purpose of the movie.

If you're watching the streaming version then you're going to miss the voiceover commentaries which in this case are just as good as the original presentation and give you an insight as to what they were trying to accomplish. Naturally I saw this in Blu-ray which is now old hat and does not change the story at all but does add to the viewing experience.",1393372800,,2027,4.321899736147757

5645318,3,B00BLOKNVK,"As many reviewers have already noted, this film finally breathed something new in Hollywood movies - something creative, something different.  To this end, this film is definitely surprisingly unique.  However, the creative spark, for whatever reason, was never fulfilled in the movie.

Besides a major flaw (see below) in the film's logic and other issues - Bruce Willis' (old Joe) character was never substantively developed.  This unfortunately, effectively removed some much needed depth from his character's motivation - though perhaps, this was done on purpose in a failed attempt to make the ending more palpable.

On a side note, it should be noted that Joseph Gordon-Levitt gave a superb performance in the film.

Unfortunately, while the story was unique and the execution of the film was done well, it was not without a serious flaw; the ending was so unsatisfying that it simply diluted the movie - a very unfortunate decision which really hurt the film.  Not only was the ending excruciatingly unsatisfying, but it was nonsensical too.

***

SPOILER ALERT:  The `old' Joe timeline included him killing or looping himself then finally settling in China where he met his love interest (again, all this was given in a rushed montage, rather than developed).  In this timeline, the boy still grew up, ostensibly with Sarah, to be the `rainmaker' aka the bloody tyrant.  Yet, in the ending montage (yes, another montage) `young' Joe comes to the realization that the boy became a blood-thirsty-looper-killer because he grew up trying to avenge the loss of Sarah and so kills himself so as to stop `old' Joe from killing Sarah - but, 'old' Joe never killed Sarah in his timeline.  So either `young' Joe killed himself for nothing (since the boy would still become a bloodthirsty tyrant) or the movie's time travel logic works about as well as a square wheel.

Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt made this movie so much fun to watch. I must admit there was a moment it nearly lost me because of what the lead character did, but I kept watching and began to understand. [I didn't approve really, but it's apart of the story].

Without really telling spoilers, Levitt plays a young Willis. It is based in the future, and they are killers. Levitt is literally sent people to kill, and he is supposed to get rid of them. If not, there's a price to pay. The hook to this story is one of the people that Levitt is supposed to get rid of. It's not so easy, and the movie really takes off.

Levitt and Bruce are excellent actors. I have enjoyed Levitt's work in Inception, and Bruce in all kinds of movies. I recommend this movie, and I further recommend to pause it if you have to leave. You don't want to miss a single detail of this story.",1382918400,,1011,4.287958115183246

There isn't much world-building and the main story wanders for a good 40 minutes or so.

But back to Looper - I am always curious how the writers and directors will handle this sort of a film but I was very satisfied with the issues of time travel.

5645370,3,B00BLOKNVK,"This film was really an interesting film to watch. And I mean it. When it was released back in September 2012, I had no such interest in watching it. For me the film just looked lame. I know you should never judge a book by its cover; I was just totally uninterested in this film.  For starters it had that gangster's vibe going for it. And I just don't like gangster movies, for one and the fact that it involved  killing people randomly, which I like, but this film kind of (for me) seemed to go over the edge and get a little too extreme. When I watched it, it had a very realistic and dark thing about it. What got me threw it all was the mesmerizing performances, by lead Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and supporters, Noah Segan and Emily Blunt. Okay so the issues with this film include  Bruce Willis, length, and ending. Bruce Willis. The man behind Die Hard. I don't know what to say, the guy has lost it. He just can't act anymore, why he does it most likely now is to put food on the table.  Whenever he's onscreen he just doesn't seem to be n it, he doesn't have the same momentum he used to have. The dude unlike Sylvester Stallone just can't do it anymore. He's given up trying. His scenes were very poorly acted.  The length of this film is way too long. I can think of a couple of scenes that should have been cut, or shortened more. It's just way too unbearable.  This film could have made for a decent Hour and a half film, but instead the people behind it added un- necessary additions to the film such as the half naked women in the bed scene, and the ""kid blue"" getting his knuckles cracked scene.  Those were lengthy additions that made little difference to the story. The ending to this film was also a bit of a disappointment for me. It ended with Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character killing himself so that the crazy future him, Bruce Willis wouldn't kill the kid. It was a very poor ending. The kid should have just been killed and Levitt's character ending it by killing the future him.  The kid was freaking nuts, and would end up being a ruthless killer. The kid killed people, he was already a lost cause, and Emily Blunt's character man was she a freaking air head. She should have killed the son. Heck with it, I would have, he was nuts. Well now to the good things. It includes the acting, special effects, and character development. The acting as I already explained was very good. Memorable you could say.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt nails another role in the head. He is most likely one of the best actors of today. Every film I see him in is more un- forgettable then the last! He is excellent in his role, and adds depth to his character. And a few supporting cast members as I've already stated were excellent as well.  The special effects, while minimal, are excellent and sharpened to the tip.  The character development is by far the best thing. All of the character's back stories are told neatly and well. All of the character's had an emotional back story, and you felt something for each one, good and bad. You felt their issues and problems, big and small.  Every character was proven to be realistic and had something about them that at least one person could relate to.  All in All, Looper might not be a big success, but it puts its characters in the right place and just seems realistic, and emotional. C+",1375228800,,3338,4.408130081300813
5645371,5,B00BLOKNVK,"First of all, I have to make fun of the people who need to point out plot holes in time travel movies.  I guess they are just super intelligent - but WAIT! If they were really that intelligent and science-minded, they would have known going in that time travel can't be presented without plot holes.  That's because it flies in the face of so many basic laws of physics.  It's make believe, people.  That's why it's called SCIENCE FICTION instead of educational programming.  Can you not have fun for a couple of hours without torturing yourselves?

Okay, now that that's out of the way...

This was a very good movie.  It had twists that really caught me off guard.  It had a bit of a horror movie feel to it towards the end.  The kid's character was classic.  All the characters were good.  Each character had things I loved and hated about them (I thought Willis being the bad guy was refreshing).  That makes them seem real.  Great duality and conflict.  Beautifully gut-wrenching.  It was one of those movies that just when you start to get comfortable with it, it changes, creating great suspense and the feeling of being on the edge of your seat.  My attention often wanders when I'm watching movies, but I was glued to the TV for this one.

And, what makes or breaks any movie, the ending was superb.  One of those endings where you find yourself thinking about it hours later.

Then something happened.

It is like they ran out of ideas and decided to start making another movie and just tacked the two ideas together.

It started as a LOOPER story and then transformed into a story about telekinetic super babies (like an X-men character) and the primary story line was kind of shoved to the back.

Worst yet, the ""revelation"" and ""ending"" was telegraphed so far ahead of time that it was almost painful to sit thru the second half of the film waiting to see what you already knew was coming.

The film also needed better editing.
For the amount of story, it was too long.

5645379,4,B00BLOKNVK,"Looper is a rare film that tries to do more than just entertain with a slick premise and pointless action. (Think Total Recall remake) This is science fiction, which is supposed to make you think as well as entertain you.

The description is already posted, so I won't rehash. I'll start off by saying that it was refreshing to see Bruce Willis in a movie where he's not just cashing a check on his Die Hard persona. I haven't enjoyed a performance from him since Twelve Monkeys, which certain aspects of the film give just a slight nod to.

Joseph Gordan-Levitt proves once again that he's capable of lead man status with his multi-layered performance as a dead man walking who gets the wake up call of his life while literally facing his own future.

They dystopian version of the future was realistic and veers away from the constant Blade Runner knock offs that we've seen time and again in sci fi films. The darkness in this future isn't in endless scenes of darkness and rain, it's in the souls of its inhabitants.

The only thing that I'd knock is that the story tries to encompass too many themes at once, which isn't such a bad thing when you compare it to the trivial plots of so called films that are being produced right now. Time travel and meeting one's future self is quite a load, however, and would have been perfectly sufficient without the additional moral quandary of whether it's acceptable to kill someone before they have a chance to become the worst type of person.

Still, the beauty of the story is that it manages to juggle all of its themes without dropping the ball. The characters are fresh, the acting superb, and the movie ends cleanly, wrapping up the time travel paradoxes with a single act.

The only thing I regret is not seeing this sooner.",1374278400,,1777,4.554858934169279

5645385,4,B00BLOKNVK,"""Looper"" almost passed completely under my radar. I am so glad it did not do so. At it's heart, it's a time travel movie with an interesting take on the concept. However, it is so much more than that.

Joe is a Looper, an assassin hired by the mob to kill people they send back in time. You see, time travel is possible - in the future at least - but also illegal. So the mob uses it for one purpose: to kill people, and dispose of them in the past. Loopers do this killing, until the day their contract is closed by their own future self being sent back and killed - by their own younger self. When Joe's future self comes back and escapes, there is a race for young Joe to ""close the loop"" and the mob to catch both Joes. But old Joe is a man with a mission, a mission that goes beyond mere survival...

The film ends up becoming about far more than time travel, as a mystery begins to unfold, hard choices are made, and a genuine moral dilemma appears. The story does not go where you expect it to, and even at the end you may not be entirely sure what young Joe is going to do, when he begins to put it all together.

I agree with the plot holers, so I won't bug with them.  They are right.  A whole lot of stuff doesn't make sense, and we're supposed to just gobble that because it's time travel and, actually, the acting is good, and there are some really very cool scenes where time sort of morphs back and forth.  Pretty women, too.  Especially Bruce Willis's Chinese wife.  Very dignified.

Since everyone has said everything, I'll point out the ending, which is ""noble.""  For sure.  But, and a second warning if you've not seen it....

Here's my question.  In the end, the noble younger Bruce goes nobler and breaks the loop by, supposedly, prohibiting the evil telepathic kid from becoming bitter after his mother person's potentially bloody demise.  So the loop is broken.  The guys disappear.  End of evil.

Now, given that.  Are we supposed to assume the following.  The kid, who was prevented from becoming bitter by not being on the train feeling horrified, as the younger Bruce imagines, doesn't grow up to become the monster of time and space because said loop is broken?  If so...

My dear friends.  After the aborted blow up, all the silver is lying in the road, next to the younger Bruce's or older or whatever futuristic golf cart.  If the loop were truly broken, and that's the thrust of the noble part, then the silver would not be there.  Nor the cart.  Nor any memory among anyone about what happened.  Nor the kid's wound.

And so...look at the last scene of the kid grimacing menacingly.  The real loop was never broken, if you follow my logic.  Nothing changed.  All the Bruces did was actually fill in the plot for the kid. They should have killed him.  They were set up.  So the plot isn't about the triumph of nobility.  It's about the futility of nobility, the pathos of any human desire to become a good person.  Nothing gets any better.  Evil rules and the good guys get messed and killed.

You tell me if I'm wrong, but I tend to have very few plot holes in my noggin.  If someone mentiioned this before, I apologize.  I didn't get that far down the list of reviews.  All apologies.",1372636800,3,2150,4.548556430446194

5645390,4,B00BLOKNVK,"As dozens of other reviewers probably mention, the premise of LOOPER is that the Master Criminal Gang of the future cannot afford to have any dead bodies around that might be used as evidence against them, so, with a Time Machine, they send trouble makers thirty years into the past (bound and hooded), to be disposed of by a team of young hitmen who work for them. The gang's inflexible rule is that hitmen in the past must kill whoever is sent back in time to them, including their older selves ... or suffer ""grave"" consequences.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays the younger self of the film's main hitman, and Bruce Willis plays that same hitman's 30-year-older self, who at some point will be sent back for Younger-Self-Gordon-Levitt to kill.

As virtually every viewer will expect from the beginning of this film, when Older-Self-Willis arrives in the past, he escapes from his younger self.

SPOILER #1: However, Older-Self-Willis is not just selfishly trying to prolong his own life (while putting his younger self in jeopardy); he has a special mission in the past that involves killing the younger self of the warped-genius-villain who caused the death of a woman he loves in his future world. In other words, Older-Self-Willis hopes to change the future by changing the past.

PLOT HOLE #1 involves the killing IN THE FUTURE of the beloved woman. Why are ANY exceptions allowed to the Rule that ALL ""hits"" must take place in the past? The obvious answer is: This inconsistency is needed to motivate the entire main plot about Older-Self-Willis's mission ... even if that entire plot rests on quicksand.

PLOT HOLES #2 and #3 and #4 ... and SPOILER #2: As with thousands of other Time Travel stories/movies, this one involves a recurring LOOP. And it is clear from a couple indications that this loop has already occurred at least twice before--but this is played down, and we are given no indication whether all the past loops (which may number in the billions) have been identical (clearly the most recent ones have been), and why THIS loop might be any different from them. Further, since the warped-genius-villain has encountered an Older-Self-Willis before, why does he take any chances by sending him back to the past again (and again and again)? And, since the warped-genius-villain IRONICALLY was warped as a child BY an Older-Self-Willis's attack, HOW could-or-did he ever become warped BEFORE any Older-Self-Willis went back in time and warped him? (This seems to be a FATAL FLAW in the plot, which no viewer is ever supposed to consider, especially in terms of the ending to THIS particular loop.)

SPOILER #3: In an earlier scene, a different hitman recognized his older self when he arrived (bound and hooded) because his older self was singing his favorite song. He released his older self and then tried to hide.

PLOT HOLES #5 and #6: The only reason the people being sent back are NOT drugged or gagged is that we (the audience) need to be shown WHAT happens to a hitman who disobeys the gang's rule. Logic would have dictated that the gang of the future should have killed people bloodlessly, with drugs or poisons, and merely shipped the corpses to the past for disposal. Logic would further dictate that an aged hitman in the future should be sent back to a different hitman in the past, not to his younger self (and that all younger selves should be kept uninformed about the killings of their future selves).

PLOT HOLES #7 through #57: On numerous occasions, Older-Self-Willis exhibits implausible SUPER POWERS when he is confronting multiple armed opponents. For example, while unarmed, he is able to defeat his armed younger self, having already defeated at least FOUR ARMED MEN in the future; and when he is armed, he can easily defeat dozens of armed men and cause dozens of other armed men to quiver in abject terror that he will come for them.

BUT ... WHAT SAVES THIS FILM (for me) despite all these PLOT HOLES is the ending. My favorite kind of story, whether it is found in mainstream literature, in mystery fiction, in science fiction ... whatever ... involves the sudden disclosure of a streak of unsuspected (but plausible) NOBILITY AND MORALITY in a person who had previously seemed ""only ordinary"" or even ""subhuman.""

THAT is what occurs at the very end of this film ... and I will not ""spoil"" anyone's enjoyment of it by giving more details about it.

If I were awarding this film a letter grade, given its roller-coaster ride of negative factors that terminate in a strongly positive and EMOTIONALLY SATISFYING conclusion, in my judgment it deserves a solid ""B"" ... perhaps almost a weak ""B+"".",1372464000,2,4638,4.836065573770492

When the younger present-day assassin then kills himself, the woman returns to life since the event technically never happened (i.e., the younger assassin never grew into the older Bruce Willis), yet her younger son's jaw remains injured. Die-hards will try to find other reasons for the still-injured jaw, but in my opinion a good film shouldn't require viewers to struggle to make sense of it.

5645409,3,B00BLOKNVK,"I may reveal a MAJOR spoiler in my first paragraph.  It would probably be best to only read my review if you've already seen Looper.

Looper has amazing special effects borrowed from the Matrix obviously, but the storyline is REALLY confusing.  It's a science fiction flick about a man who works as a mob hit man protecting a farmland woman and her supernatural Village of the Damned-inspired child from a 30-year old version of *himself*.  Do you follow?  Because it's extremely confusing.  In other words, Bruce Willis returns 30 years later to communicate with -and prevent- the younger version of himself (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) from making the same horrible regrettable mistakes that cost his Asian wife her life as a result of a mob shooting.

The first 30 minutes is *nothing* but confusion, but as soon as Bruce and Joseph meet up at a restaurant (after the realization that Joseph *shouldn't* try killing his older self at every immediate opportunity) this is when the storyline improves.  It's sort of funny to me however, when Joseph was simply standing in a cornfield pointing a gun at an empty blanket waiting for Bruce's character to appear so he can shoot him, lol.

It's sort of annoying that the writers didn't make Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt one and the same.  In other words, they should have simply either disguised Bruce as a younger man during the segments that involve Joseph, or disguise Joseph as an older person during the parts that portray the older version of himself.  Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt look *nothing* alike.  Hard to follow I know, haha.

Looper is also loaded (overloaded) with abrupt and VERY direct gun shootings of the violent variety.  Be prepared for these or you'll be knocked through your roof in complete shock.  They are always LOUD and very sudden, but the actual talking/conversations taking place between the characters throughout the film is really quiet.  Not a good combination.  Throw in an Asian woman who's presence never made sense to me (I *thought* I was beginning to make some sense of this storyline 30 minutes in but I was wrong- wasn't Joseph's character supposed to find *this* girl and protect her?  Why did he stick around the farmlands and form a relationship with the other woman instead?) and you have a very bizarre movie.

I think it's also strange that the action in the beginning takes a dramatic turn later on and mellows out considerably once Joseph's character falls in love with a farmland girl.  This portion of the film takes up the entire second half.  Really strange.  Overall, one of the most confusing science fiction films you'll ever see.  You know now that I think about it, I normally have trouble following mob movies, and science fiction films can either be really easy or really hard to follow (no in between) so... now I know why Looper made a loop around my head, lol.",1370649600,,2894,4.837398373983739

Unfortunately they didn't take advantage of any of those things. The acting was pretty good but I felt like it could've been better. I think both of them are really good at showing emotion but didn't in this film because of their characters. They had a few moments where they could have developed their characters more and allowed them to really act, but they just left them bland. The film crept at a slow pace, at some point I thought it would pick up but it never did. I also thought there would be more action then there was. Even the final scene was pretty calm. They had the potential to make some sweet fight scenes but it just never happened. The ending was really lame, it wasn't anything huge or emotionally gripping, it didn't leave me in shock and aww or wanting more. It was more of a, ""oh...that kind of sucks"" feeling. I also felt like they were leading the audience to side with Willis, wanting him to carry out his mission, but then the ending just threw it all out the window.

5645423,2,B00BLOKNVK,"In the future bodies cannot be disposed of without trace, so the mob syndicates send the victims into the past to be murdered and disposed of by ""loopers.""  There is a thirty year gap between the future and the movie's present (which is itself 2044 A.D.).  A Mr. Big, nicknamed the Rain Man, is ""closing the loop"" on the loopers, which means their future selves are being sent back to the same loopers for execution and disposal.  Why?  We're never told.  Is the mysterious Rain Man afraid someone will find him out?  We don't know.

As a time travel movie it shares the same problems as other such films.  Your head will spin, or as one of the characters says, thinking about it will fry your brain like an egg.  I was never quite sure at one point if the movie's characters (mainly  Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis as differently-aged but the same man) were caught in an endless loop or if there was a real ending to their actions.  It was hard to follow.  Consider this a spoiler if you wish, but it's more an example of the movie's confusion: Old man Joe (Willis) is returned twice to be executed.  Once he escapes his fate, and once he doesn't.  We tried out different scenarios as to what the latter attempt meant, with no luck.  The show, as far we could tell, doesn't make use of it or explain it.

So much for the puzzles and paradoxes of time travel.  The movie turns into a more orthodox shoot-em-up action movie towards the end, and it's unbelievable the amount of damage protagonists can do in this type of show.  The young Joe makes a decision near the end that beggars belief, as he takes a stand with a family against his older self.

Perhaps a second viewing would help clarify the movie, but I won't take the time again to do it.  Decently acted, murky, formulaic once you're past the time travel business, and a bit unbelievable that the main character does what he does, the movie was a disappointment.

The second ""half"" flips the bird to the first part so it can drag you away kicking & screaming into a completely different movie.  The rules of time travel are ignored and the plot setup in the first half is ignored.  It goes from being a movie about fighting who you might become in the future to a movie about whether its OK to go back in time to kill Hitler when he was a baby.

5645447,2,B00BLOKNVK,"The words that came to mind while watching this movie were: disjointed, disconnected, confusing, and unrealistic.  There were many more similar to those, and the list got longer the more I watched it.  First of all, it is not science fiction, it's fantasy!  For a million reasons, there is no time travel, there will be no time travel, the whole concept is totally speculative at best since you would have to rearrange the rules of the universe to accommodate it, not to mention use a ton of power to effect it.
  As some have pointed out, there is no need for ""loopers"" in the first place, scifi or otherwise, which are a ridiculous construct to try to fabricate a storyline.  This is a ""story"" that happens when writers don't know the difference between scifi and fantasy, or just don't care.  This movie suffers from actually not being either.  There have been many stories about time travel which are fun because they don't try to take themselves too seriously, and so they're interesting to watch in the ""what if you could ..."" vein.  But there is NOTHING in this movie that can actually EXIST, even potentially!  Every bit of it is so preposterous, that it just can't hold your interest. There is no real drama, because what is here is simply thrown at the viewer, like spaghetti against a wall, whether it makes sense or not; you are always aware it's totally made up, destroying your ""willing suspension of disbelief""; there is nothing which hangs even remoptely on anything scientific or plausible, including their ""TK"" (telekinetic) people.
  Telekinesis, if there were any, still would need POWER - it's not magic! And to create winds, throw entire rooms of furniture around, and blow people up, it takes POWER, that is, ENERGY.  A human being cannot MANUFACTURE it, he would have to BORROW it from somewhere, in huge amounts. They didn't do that here, they just materialized it out of thin air to create an effect: an impossible one, which makes it a silly one. This is one more implausibility on top of a host of them that make no true sense and are genuinely imposible and will always be impossible.
  ""Looper"" is not a story about MAGIC, which it should be to make all these various things occur, and places it clearly in the fantasy realm; but pure fantasy stories are much better and more believable than this, like the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies, for instance.  Good performances by the actors here save the movie from being worse than it is, but can't elevate it to a more engaging vehicle. One always knows everything that is happening is impossible and preposterous, and that saves it from being any kind of moving or productive drama. It abandons your intelligence, and thus abandons your heart, leaving you with nothing but a puzzle that has no answers.",1366934400,2,2776,4.716356107660456

5645463,5,B00BLOKNVK,"In my eyes, Rian Johnson is one of the finest visionaries of his generation.  Soon to be an auteur (or maybe he already is one), his directorial style is undeniable and his ability to completely soak into his films is remarkable.  His films stand out as his own.  He knows how to drape himself over every frame, and all three of his feature films are noteworthy in their depth as well as style.

`Looper' is probably his finest film to date.

Science fiction films are a dime a dozen these days, and they usually center around the same themes and regurgitated effects, and that's what makes `Looper' so engaging; it feels fresh and exciting.  Loopers are hired guns who make executions for the Mob.  In the future, when the Mob wants to off someone, they send them 30 years into the past and have them disposed of by these loopers.  At times these loops are closed.  This happens when the looper himself gets sent back to be killed by his past self.  When this happens the looper, after killing himself, is given the next thirty years to squander his money in debauchery, knowing that he'll be dead at the end of it all.  Sometimes, the looper has a change of heart and goes AWOL, refusing to kill himself.  In this case, Joe's future self is just too much for him to handle.

With a backstory that unwinds in the most unexpected way, `Looper' is marvelously written and expertly directed by Johnson.  He shows such grasp of themes and style, melding the science fiction aspects of the film with black comedy, sheer impact of action, minimalist romance and moral ambiguities that keep the audience completely soaked into every frame.  The action segments are insanely inspired, especially the final blowout, and the performances by the entire cast (Emily Blunt being best in show) propel this film in the right direction.

Highly recommended for anyone who is looking for a clever take on a tired genre.",1366070400,,1903,4.66966966966967

5645465,3,B00BLOKNVK,"The premise of Looper is fascinating and carried lots of potential for a riveting movie.  However, in execution it falls far short of it's potential.

To begin with there are several inconsistencies and holes in the plot and time travel paradox.  The movie sets up a world with specific rules and then proceeds to break them making it increasingly difficult to suspend your disbelief.  Why for instance, would the Mob who has to use Loopers to kill and dispose of bodies, indiscriminately kill Bruce Willis's character's wife?

Secondly, there are many completely unnecessary scenes that never get developed and contribute very little to the story.  There's Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character's girlfriend who is introduced several times but then is completely dropped.  Additional time is dedicated towards Kid Blue who accomplishes virtually nothing and is extremely unsatisfying.

Finally, if you're not a fan of violence and blood especially that associated with children, then this is not the movie for you.  Children are both the victim and the perpetrators of large amounts of violence.

However, despite these details, I still found myself enjoying parts of the movie simply because the idea and premise behind it were fascinating.

5645475,5,B00BLOKNVK,"{4.5 stars}

Despite seeing the previews, reading several reviews, and basically knowing beforehand what LOOPER's all about, I have to say that it still took me by surprise in many ways. Really fine acting, script, and cinematography bring about an immediate realism, which is especially important in a film set in the future with numerous science fictional/fantastic elements. I'm distractable and often downright dense but still followed the important points of what's going on here. LOOPER is definitely NOT one of those films that just tries to befuddle us with supposedly brilliant BS. It's one that you can watch again and again, always picking up something new in the way of hints, nuances, and details of plot.

There are a few plotholes, which is almost inevitable in a film about time paradoxes, i.e., if time travel ever becomes a reality, will it be possible to go back and change what's already occurred? A few other little imperfections here and there, but it's a film that's good enough to where something is gained even from the blemishes. This is true of anything, I suppose, but if you watch LOOPER expecting it to be good, the various anachronisms and illogicalities shouldn't be too glaring. On the other hand, if you watch it in a really critical frame of mind, on the look-out for defects, said defects may be all too evident.

The near future (2044) setting is well-done: A lot of interesting technology, but nothing too ""out there."" It's also interesting to see how Kansas City might look 30 years from now. LOOPER will obviously resonate with many science fiction aficionados, and even many who generally hate this genre will find themselves making an exception here.

This is one of Bruce Willis's finest performances. Emily Blunt as Sara is outstanding both actress and character-wise. Last but far from least, Pierce Gagnon as 5-year-old Cid is simply hypnotic and virtually steals the show whenever he's in it.",1365379200,,1939,4.9753086419753085
5645476,5,B00BLOKNVK,"This is what I said upon originally watching the film when it came out theatrically:

Last night, I saw Looper. And then, this morning, I saw it again. I loved it the first time, and it was even better on the second viewing. Its confident, charming, surprising, fun, smart, incredibly tightly plotted (despite a premise which may or may not be a bit flimsy, and which sort of begs for every sf nerd on the internet to tear it aparta concern the film itself actually addresses at a couple of points); its incredibly well-acted, and, not that its a surprise coming from Rian Johnson, absolutely fantastically directed. It was an utterly fulfilling movie-going experience, and I can easily see Looper taking the top spot in my year-end best of list. (The other contender, The Master, was wonderful as well, a truly Great with-a-capital-G film, but left me wantingwhich may very well have been by design, but it lacked closure all the same; Looper, on the other hand, challenges you and can be fairly cerebral at points, but its wholly satisfying.)

I have a lot of thoughts on Looper, from how time travel basically functioned the same way it does in the Back to the Future trilogy, to how great the performances were, to how deeply unsettled I was by a particular scene, but for now Ill just say that its without a doubt the best genre piece Ive seen this year, and one of the best films overall as well.

What I will add now: upon a million subsequent viewings, it's still great.",1365206400,,1478,4.612167300380228

5645478,3,B00BLOKNVK,"Looper is a 2012 sci-fi film about future forensic evidence being so highly developed that people send victims to the past to get killed by a hitman. Interesting idea, especially since each hitman is sent back as well at a certain age since the assassin company (or whatever) want to keep it on the hush-hush. So Joseph Gorden Levitt's future self is sent back to him, and after failing to kill his future self, they both have 2 contradicting objectives to complete, and yet they can't really interfere with each other since the butterfly effect and all. This is when the film was the most interesting for me, especially when they talk at a diner and they're both too stubborn to reason with each other.

Then later it gets weird, Bruce Willis wants to kill a kid to save his future wife, ok that makes sense, but wait, the kid has super powers now? What? Sure, he wipes out all the crime bosses, but was this part really necessary? The tonal shift was too jarring for me to really get into it after that. Some kid having temper tantrums and blowing people up was cool to watch, but it detracted from the main story a lot. Why couldn't the kid just have been normal? Also I stopped taking the film seriously after I saw Bruce Willis, a man who lived his past 20 years in China with his wife, can apparently wipe out an entire organization of trained hitmen by himself. Also why does the organization that sends people back send the hitman to his younger self? Why not send it to someone else so that there's no risk of ""failing to close the loop"". There's a lot of that s*** in this film where it makes no sense and yet you're expected to go along with it.

Maybe I'm disappointed because I came in with high expectations, but there's a lot of problems with the main story. There were many small touches to the film that were great, like Bruce Willis telling his younger self ""I can't look you in the eyes, this is too weird"", or Paul Dano's older self realizing that he just screwed himself over in a disturbing scene. Many little touches to the film were nice, but doesn't really mean much when the overall story is full of holes and tonally inconsistent. I did like the 360 degree character arc that the film had, in that both the past and future selves are justified in what they're doing, and the film shifts between who you sympathize more for. Overall though they could've cut some stuff out and contained the story a little more instead of having young Professor X jar up the 3rd act.",1365120000,,2492,4.427015250544662

5645487,3,B00BLOKNVK,"Wow, what a weird rollercoaster ride this movie is. I almost gave up on it after 30 minutes I grew so bored. The start is not good given it starts off with the whole voiceover narration explaining what a ""looper"" is. That's usually the kiss of death when you have to explain the premise of the movie before it even really gets started but once Bruce Willis shows up the story does take off. Sadly, it's only in quite spectacular spurts.

There are some huge flaws with this like why in this badass future are the guns so 18th century-like? They even call them blunderbusses. Is this some inside joke because I did not get that at all? Then we get the whole odd makeup they put J. Gordon Levitt in to make him look like a younger version of Willis. Sorry, but it did not work at all. I just found it a total distraction especially wondering if those Noel Gallagher Oasis eyebrows were going to lift off and make a movie of their own in many scenes.

Throw in an excellent Emily Blunt (oddly playing a Kansas farm girl because apparently in the entire acting community in the U.S. there is not a single American actress who could have possibly played this Midwestern role) with the scariest kid since Damien in The Omen and this movie does have some get up and go. Where it went and ends up is pure sci-fi mumbo jumbo at times. Basically, cut through all the nonsense and it's Terminator--guy goes back in time to kill off the kid before he can become the powerful evil guy in the future.

The extras help explain the connection Levitt has with the writer-director of this so now I understand why friends should not let friends act in their movies. Levitt's a very good actor, but his attempt to be a younger Willis just did not fly for me at all.",1364860800,,1745,4.363076923076923

JUDGMENT CALL:

There are many films about time travel, sentimental to action-driven films.  And part of the challenge of a writer is to create a sci-fi action film without being too banal.

Fortunately, writer/director Rian Johnson has crafted an intriguing sci-fi action film in which time travel is banned in the future and also a future that has been taken over by criminal organizations and 10% of the society which has gained special telekinetic (TK)) powers.

It sounds so far out of left field and I admit being a bit skeptical when I first saw the trailer for this film, but having watched the film now, I realize that Johnson has crafted and original and unique storyline that I never expected to see, and the fact that it was so different, exciting and provided an action-packed storyline but wasn't filled with too much action or special effects and integrated a fascinating storyline made ""Looper"" a film that was much better than what I was expecting.

In this day and age of special effects and popcorn action films, the whole entire concept of criminal organizations using time machines for illegal purposes, especially transporting people targeted for assassinations through a time machine from 2074 to 2044 for execution by Loopers was interesting.

But it's the actual meeting of present and future Joe that is surprising.  Most films tend to show a present and future version of themselves, working together for the greater good.  Considering that present Joe (portrayed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a criminal and that future Joe (portrayed by Bruce Willis) is a former criminal thanks to his loving wife who changed him, it's a different take because it becomes criminal vs. criminal but who in the end will be on top?

While future Joe has changed to become a better man, it's the fact that he has come back to the past to kill the ""Rain Maker"" that makes the story quite interesting because the ""Rain Maker"" in 2044 is a young child.  And because he doesn't know which child will be the Rain Maker, he goes after three addresses to kill all children.  This reminds you of ""The Terminator"" when The Terminator goes to all addresses killing anyone named Sarah Conner but it's hard to sympathize with future Joe because he's going to kill innocent children for his ""greater good"" (no rain maker, no tyranny.  No rain maker, his wife survives).

While present Joe just wants to kill his future self but when he finds out the boy he is protecting or has become friends with is the ""Rain Maker"", especially in Damian-esque fashion of a child that exceeds the 10% TK threshold and can have a human being explode, suffice to say, these are situations that I never expected to see for this film.

And it's those unexpected twists that made ""Looper"" so entertaining!

Joseph Gordon-Levitt has become an actor in recent years that gets better and better and as for Bruce Willis, he's one of the best action stars of all time!  Jeff Daniels moment in the film is quite short, but Emily Blunt was wonderful as the single mother and interesting to see Piper Perabo in her first nude prostitute scene.  But ""Looper"" features a solid cast who did a great job in the film!

And as for the Blu-ray release, picture quality and lossless audio are fantastic!  There are a good number of special features included but if anything stayed in my head during my viewing of this film, it's the immersive soundtrack with gunshots galore and the wonderful makeup design and prosthetic use of trying to make Levitt look closer to Bruce Willis.

Overall, Rian Johnson's ""Looper"" is an exciting sci-fi action film with a clever storyline with many twists and turns.  And on Blu-ray, the film looks and sounds incredible.  Recommended!",1364601600,,6651,5.0755064456721914

Emily Blunt adds the finishing touch along with Pierce Gagnon who plays her son. The conflicts of past and future self presented by Bruce and Joseph and the moral undertones apparent in their interactions with Emily and Pierce make this a philosophical tale of the human condition as well as a great time travel Sci-Fi movie.,1364515200,,470,4.674698795180723

ALSO, we come to expect a story where the main characters are the main object, and that the story ends with their ending-happily after or not. I've been exposed to many stories lately where the ""main"" characters are only the catalyst for the continuation of someone else's story. This movie is a prime example of that.",1364169600,,608,4.536363636363636

5645522,2,B00BLOKNVK,"THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS

So at the end he kills himself which makes the old looper disappear, if this is true why do they act like it's terribly important they can't kill the young loopers? Why do they chop that guy up at the beginning if they could just kill him and he would vanish?

Funny, the annoying main henchmen survives Bruce Willis' shoot out only to come back at the end for exclusively no reason at all but a semi-cool death. No logic fallacy there, but kind of funny how pointless it was. More indicative of a pointless action spectacle film than anything resembling a mind-bending thought provoking sci-fi needless to say.

If it's such a big deal to kill people why do they shoot Bruce Willis' girlfriend/wife so irrationally? And then on top of that they have a long range stun gun for Bruce which adds on to this absurdity. Which brings back attention to concept of this film, time looping, they think the best world to portray this concept is one where the mob has to send back bodies in the past to be killed? Really? And they could just kill anyone that startles them anyway?

The biggest fallacy of all and I'm so embarrassed by movie-goers that nobody seems to see this giant hole: In the original looper's timeline, he kills his older self, there is no confrontation. The reason the Rainmaker even exists is because at the end Bruce Willis was going to shoot his mother. Bruce Willis wouldn't shoot his mother if the Rainmaker didn't exist, which he wouldn't if Bruce didn't shoot his mother, which in the timeline Bruce is coming back from he never had that confrontation and the mother was never shot, so the Rainmaker wouldn't exist in his timeline. Is that clear? It's funny in no possible reality in this film would the Rainmaker exist, not the one where his mom was about to die (because she didn't) and not the one where his mom didn't die (because Bruce Willis killed his looper). AH! How can so many people not immediately see this?

The kid did some freaky good acting, so I'll give it 2 stars. No extra stars for the awesome special effects because it probably distracting everyone from thinking and I guess is the reason movie-goers are becoming so shallow and stupid.",1364083200,6,2202,4.592875318066158

5645546,5,B00BLOKNVK,"With Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis leading a talented cast, what could go wrong? Only a little.

When I write these reviews, I always try to not only give my opinion, but to give you what everyone else says as well. As is normal with thrillers like Looper, there are people who praised it as the most original movie of 2012. Others complained, saying that it had a silly and unbelievable plot. I would like to remind those who think this that this film is a sci-fi thriller, and by it's very nature is not going to be very realistic. Some people however delved a little further and brought up some good points. One critic said that he enjoyed the film until it detoured from the plot that was being advertised in the trailers. Joe (Gordon-Levitt) is a Looper who after executing all of his target's that the crime lords in the future send him, until they send him his future self (Willis), in an attempt to ""close his loop."" Older Joe escapes from Younger Joe, and later reveals to him that in the future, there is a dictator known as the Rainmaker who is closing all the loops. The Rainmaker is also responsible for killing Older Joe's wife in the future, so Older Joe traveled through time to kill the Rainmaker, who is still only a young boy. This is probably really confusing to those who have not seen the film, so I will sum everything up with this question: what if you had the power to go back in time to killer Adolf Hitler as a young boy? What would you do? A question that has troubled many a philosophy student, but as far as I have seen never has hardly ever been dealt with in a movie before. Anyways, this critic had said that Looper's plot strayed once it got to the use of telekinesis.

So on top of the time traveling assassination element, people in the future also have telekinetic powers. Only about ten percent of everyone has them, and even then most of them can only lift small metal objects the size of quarters. And out of these few, even less of them are truly exceptional, like Sid, a young boy who Young Joe finds living out on a farm with is mother, Sara (Emily Blunt). Sid can go as far as lifting up multiple pieces of furniture and imploding gats, the future's hired guns, who come prowling around. Oh yeah, if you fail to close your loop and ""let him run,"" you are a wanted man for the rest of your life, which usually turns out to be pretty short once the police are on your back. So while Young Joe is hiding from the police out on Sara's farm, Older Joe is hunting down all of the children who were born on the day that the Rainmaker was born, his only link to finding the future dictator.

The film's subtext is a redemptive story for Joe, with both his present and future selves. Older Joe, after he closed his loop, went on to go to China where he worked as a mercenary and fed his hunger for eye-drop drugs, until he met a woman who he falls in love with. She helps him get his life back on track and live as an honest man, and for many years they live in peace until the Rainmaker begins closing all of the loops. And Sara begins to help Young Joe with his drug addiction as he begins to go through withdrawal, and it is obvious that if they had more time together, something more than friendship would show itself. Looper takes a very unique stance on the time travel genre as well. In classic movies like Back to the Future, the characters are all trying not to tamper with the past at all in order so that their futures are not changed when they return to their present. But with Rian Johnson's film, his characters see that by using their knowledge of the future, they can make decisions that will benefit the good of everyone. Young Joe sees this, as he watches his older self prepare to kill Sara, while Sid is running away, safe from danger. He sees that all the events are coming full circle, or looping together, and that it is his responsibility to change this never-ending cycle from continuing. So in the heat of the moment, he shoots himself in the chest, and Older Joe disappears. This allows Sara to survive and Sid to not grow up on a dark and vengeful path.

The first time I saw Looper, I was a little disappointed. I did not see the real purpose in Young Joe killing himself. I thought that there would have been other ways for Sid to be taken care of and not go on to become the Rainmaker, without Young Joe having to make the ultimate sacrifice. But that is just it, what is more noble (and redemptive) for the hero to give the ultimate sacrifice for the good of all? This encouraged me to give the film another chance, and when I did I saw so much more in the characters and how the whole idea of sacrifice and redirection of a life was played with from the opening scenes all the way until the final moments of the story. Rian Johnson also decided to uses as little CGI effects as possible, and use wires and practical physical effects whenever it was possible. I applaud him and all other directors who make this choice, because the industry relies so heavily on CGI that many films look like over-stylized cartoons. It is the use of practical effects that gave Looper a gritty, realistic feel. Hollywood needs to make more films like these, that deliver great action spectacles as well as deep and believable characters coupled with great dialog. Johnson's terrific screenplay and direction brought to life this story of redemption and self-giving, while also crafting one of the most original sci-fi films of the decade, albeit having a few errors that I found easy to ignore.

5645548,4,B00BLOKNVK,Really liked this movie. The concept was the usual time-travel scenario done in a unique way. Definitely recommend it to sci-fi fans out there. JGL is really maturing into a fine actor.,1363824000,,185,4.8125

5645551,5,B00BLOKNVK,This movie may be creepy but nothing about the seller is. This was sent in a timely manner and arrived in perfect shape. I enjoyed the movie though it is not an upbeat film by any means (not that I expected it to be)!,1363737600,,217,3.9545454545454546
5645552,4,B00BLOKNVK,I thought this was very entertaining with a new story idea. The cast was great and the story kept moving without pause. Definitely worth a watch.,1363737600,,145,4.615384615384615
5645553,5,B00BLOKNVK,"Bruce Willis. Time Travel.
Best film I've seen in years.

Joseph Gordon Levitt is physically unrecogniable. This is not the little boy you expected to see from 3rd Rock from the Sun. Great makeup and prosthetic work, great acting.",1363651200,,230,4.897435897435898
5645554,3,B00BLOKNVK,Very interesting story line.  Time travel has been brought to view in several movies and over several time periods.  Interesting what future would be like.,1363651200,,155,5.16

5645556,4,B00BLOKNVK,"A little hard to follow at times, with all the time shifts.  But a very interesting plot!  I was afraid before watching that it would turn into a really bad Die Hard clone of a movie, I'm glad it did not.",1363651200,,204,3.951219512195122
5645557,5,B00BLOKNVK,"This movie was full of action, violence, and intense emotional ups and downs. I can really understand why the people who watched it felt let down by the end too. It was hard for me to put into words but...

***Spoiler alert***

For the ones who want to know why, it's simple. If you follow a character through the entire story, you want to see them get their happily ever after ending. You want to see them win. You are financially vested with the character you watched on their journey. If they suddenly die and cease to exist, it's over. Pointless, but still interesting.

To me this story was about the guy who was a looper and an assassin. When he dies, it was like what was the point of watching this movie?? The movie changed it so midway it became about the kid with the superpowers who becomes head of the mafia organization in the future. We should have been following his story, not the looper.

Still this was one of those movies that you can't stop thinking about once you watch it. I enjoyed it and thought it was well written and good, if not slightly violent.",1363651200,,1074,4.381909547738694

5645561,5,B00BLOKNVK,Since I like Bruce Willis naturally I liked this movie.  It certainly had a different twist to it.  I would recommend if you like Bruce.,1363564800,,136,4.4
5645562,4,B00BLOKNVK,"My kids wanted to see this movie so I obliged. Intriguing from the start, the movie drew me in. A little thin on some of the plot lines, but that's ok. It kind of caused you to create explanations for those holes on your own, which is why this movie worked. Little too much strong language for my tastes, but that's how movies are nowadays. This is one of those movies that you will mull over for a few days after watching. I always enjoy these types of movies because I feel like I got my moneys worth. Give it a spin thing if you like sci-fi, action, and thinking about big topics.",1363564800,,583,4.168141592920354
5645563,4,B00BLOKNVK,"I liked the movie. Original concept for a movie.  Like all time travel movies it suffers from the same, traveling to the past changes the future.  If your future self travels to the past to eliminate you, how do you exist in the future?  Etc.",1363564800,,242,4.333333333333333

5645567,3,B00BLOKNVK,"If you are a big fan of Bruce Willis then by all means you'll want to see this movie. As for me, wish I'd past. While it is an intriging premise for a movie it was hard to keep up with all the going back and forth. Other than that it's just a typical shoot 'em up Bruce Willis movie. Not bad but not good .. just OK",1363478400,,315,3.6470588235294117
5645568,3,B00BLOKNVK,"it was just okay. just another Bruce Willis shoot 'em up movie.  had an interesting premise, didn't really follow through.",1363478400,,122,5.1

The quality of the movie was not very good. I had it streamed to my tv and any other movies we have gotten this way have been clear, this one was not.",1363392000,,303,4.11864406779661
5645571,4,B00BLOKNVK,I really liked this movie. Almost loved it. I think the bad guys just didn't live up to the rest of the movies excellent acting.,1363392000,,128,4.16
5645572,4,B00BLOKNVK,Enjoyed this movie. Good acting and the plot was intricate enough to keep our interest and not be so predictable.,1363392000,,113,4.7
5645573,5,B00BLOKNVK,I will watch anything with Bruce Willis in it! He is one cool actor......If you haven't seen this movie you need to especially if you like Bruce Willis. Cool special effects............Watch It!!,1363305600,,195,5.125
5645574,5,B00BLOKNVK,"Always enjoy Bruce Willis.  Is there anything he cannot do?  Also, Joseph Gordon-Levitt shows great promise as being another actor who is chameleon-like in his on-screen portrayals.  There was enough publicity beforehand that we were able to follow the plot and make sense of the seemingly senselessness.  Only criticism:  wish there had been subtitles!  Us baby boomers are getting hard of hearing and are still vain enough that we do not want to buy hearing aids!",1363305600,,465,5.052631578947368
5645575,3,B00BLOKNVK,"Good movie, action packed and love Bruce Willis. Would recommend for anyone to watch this movie. I give this movie three stars",1363305600,,126,4.7727272727272725
5645576,4,B00BLOKNVK,"Time travel is always a difficult topic to wrap my head around because of the paradoxes.  My husband and I certainly had an animated discussion over what timelines could and could not be possible - if you do a thing NOW has it always then happened in the future?  Can you affect your older self thirty years later in a moment or would the effect of your actions ripple through the whole timeline immediately and always have happened once you've done it?  AAARGH  :-)

Anyway watching Joseph Gordon-Levitt channel a young Bruce Willis was a treat.  He was amazing, the story was gripping despite breaking my brain and I enjoyed it very much. It was really violent and gory though so if you are sensitive to that sort of thing it might not be for you.  The main characters are not valiant and a lot of people die in variously gruesome ways.  The violence mostly served the story and only seemed a little extra gruesome in spots - nothing that keeps me up at night like the extra disturbing moments cut out of the original theater release of the Sixth Sense.  I was reminded a bit of the Butterfly Effect which I also thought was a really interesting and thought provoking movie.

I recommend it, but only to adults who can handle a fair amount of gory violence in a movie.",1363305600,,1270,4.458874458874459
5645577,4,B00BLOKNVK,This movie was pretty good.  It is sort of confusing at times so you really have to watch every minute or you will get lost.  Wonderful ending!!!,1363305600,,145,4.333333333333333
5645578,3,B00BLOKNVK,"If you are looking for an entertaining movie that can hold your attention for a couple hours, rent this. It has an interesting plot concept, is fairly fast-paced, and has lots of action. With that said, it's not a movie that left me with any lasting impression -- it is neither thought-provoking nor (despite the plot concept)",1363305600,,326,4.7368421052631575
5645579,5,B00BLOKNVK,My husband and I really enjoyed this movie. Very interesting and keeps you on the edge of you seat. keeps you guessing and thinking!,1363305600,,132,4.541666666666667
5645580,4,B00BLOKNVK,And thank you Joseph Gordon Levitt! This movie was very well done! It's kinda weird to see Levitt made up to look like Bruce Willis but it goes away after a while. Good movie!!,1363305600,,176,4.205882352941177
5645581,3,B00BLOKNVK,"Lots of potential but, despite a surprise ending, this movie was between 3 and 4 stars. Good acting but needed a better script.",1363219200,,127,4.565217391304348
5645582,4,B00BLOKNVK,"Don't get me wrong; this movie is very well made. It was well acted, shot and directed. I was never bored.

But I started out watching a movie about a hit man who shoots mob victims sent back in time from the future, and knows that his final victim will be his older self. Interesting idea--even if it's not very plausible. But okay, let's just run with it. That's the movie I saw in the trailers, the one I expected to see.

So, when his future self comes back, present-day self hesitates for a moment and future self gets the drop on him and runs off. Now present-day self must hunt down and kill future self. Also interesting.

SPOILER FOLLOWS

But then, it's all about a telekinetic farm kid who will one day rule the world with an iron fist. . . er, brain. . . if he isn't stopped.

Huh. . . ? Where the hell did that come from? I know, I know, it's foreshadowed by showing us that 10% of the population has trivial telekinetic powers. They can make coins float above their hands.

But to me, this film starts one story and then switches in mid-stream to a story stemming from a second, unrelated science fiction premise.

While it was refreshing that the movie didn't just turn into a series of action sequences in which JGL tries to kill BW (which would have been a pretty one-sided conflict, admittedly) I found this shift in emphasis to be far more distracting than Joseph Gordon-Levitt's prosthetic nose. Which I never had a problem with.

Anyway, I appear to be the only one bothered by this so just go ahead and enjoy the movie.",1363219200,2,1540,4.378947368421053
5645583,5,B00BLOKNVK,"I didn't get to see it in theaters, I heard interesting things, I wanted to see it.  Practically anything with Bruce Willis in it is worth watching anyway right? So I decided I'd by the movie to give it a try and it's a lot, lot darker a movie than I thought.  It's got some really tough stuff in here, and it has a great plot, but you have to pay attention to understand all the subtle stuff, otherwise about 3/4 way through the movie the may plot if finally revealed in it's full scope and measure.  Might take two or three watches to get all the little things but it is a movie worth watching a second or a third time.",1363219200,,621,4.073770491803279

5645585,5,B00BLOKNVK,Very entertaining movie.  Good action and plot.  Enjoyed the acting and all the CG they did.  Would watch it again!,1363219200,,115,4.65
5645586,3,B00BLOKNVK,"I love Bruce Willis, but I found this movie so depressing I regret having watched it. I gave it three stars because the concept is intriguing and the movie was well done.",1363219200,,170,4.34375
5645587,3,B00BLOKNVK,"This movie was great until the plot stopped for a rest at the farm. It became a lot quieter, a lot duller. One thing: none of the women characters were anything other than types (hooker, loving wife, fiercely protective mother) and the director/writer did not write them with the same complexity he wrote the male characters. Still, it was a good movie with some great moments.",1363219200,,377,4.7272727272727275

5645590,1,B00BLOKNVK,"LOOPER is dark, dull and depressing. I watched it on Netflix but since Amazon is where I do (occasional) reviews, this is where I'll put my two cents. The film has received a lot of positive ratings, which I can't figure out. There isn't much to like here. The ""Sci-Fi"" element certainly isn't new - time travelling to kill people was exhaustively explored in the Terminator franchise. There is an irrelevant sidelight involving telekenesis, which has nothing to do with the story and seems really dated and lame (think The Exorcist from 1973)...the bad guys wear long black coats straight out of The Matrix....and the main characters are cold blooded killers. Many gratuitous, repetitive shots of people being blown away with shotguns. The editing seems sloppy so there isn't so much dramatic tension as hope for something that never materializes. A movie that never should have been made.",1363132800,3,890,5.02027027027027
5645591,3,B00BLOKNVK,"I bought this movie because I am a bid Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis fan. However, I was not very impressed with this movie. It was a little confusing at first and a little slow. I'm not crazy about the ending either, but it's not the worst I've seen.",1363046400,,259,4.3061224489795915
5645592,4,B00BLOKNVK,Really good movie. I waited a long time to see it and it was worth the wait.  I would do it again.,1363046400,,98,3.4545454545454546
5645593,4,B00BLOKNVK,"Very much how I felt watching the Fifth element. If you want to know what this movie is vaguely like watch Fifth Element.
Bruce Willis is also in this movie. Which is why I probably feel this way.
There's also that cool scene with the fire and match; I like that scene very much.

One thing: Bruce Willis does not wear an undershirt for this movie- so maybe it isn't as good as
the Fifth Element- so you should watch that, then Looper and confirm my feelings on Willis killing
baddies in an undershirt.",1363046400,,502,4.340425531914893

5645595,4,B00BLOKNVK,A time travel movie that mostly does not insult your intelligence too much.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt is great in this.  I do question the use of the heavy makeup.,1363046400,,159,4.642857142857143

5645597,5,B00BLOKNVK,"Love the premise of this movie, but the ending is slightly predictable about 20 minutes before end of movie.  The premise of the movie is amazing, and treats the subject matter with great care.  The idea of a time-traveling hitman plays into this story extremely well.  Would have liked more explanation on how the time travel itself worked and that backstory as well as the ""psychic"" abilities of some of the characters.  They are just small things that are glossed over that should have been explained better.  It, at times, has a Terminator feel to the story, but overall is a great ride.",1362960000,,591,4.699029126213592

5645599,4,B00BLOKNVK,"The movie starts off slow and takes a while to build up to the plot being in motion.
There is plenty of relatively non-gory violence while we wait to see things kick into action.

Once we get the gist of the plot, then it becomes a waiting game as the main characters circle.

It's clear long before you get to the end of the movie who is in the final confrontation.
This lead me to suspect how things might have to end.

It was worth the $5 since I didn't have to buy popcorn, soda, nor deal with talkers doing the movie.",1362873600,,522,4.098039215686274

5645610,5,B00BLOKNVK,"I watched this on my TV over Roku.

If you typically have excellent playback experience with your setup, then I highly recommend this movie.

For me it was the typical amazon playback experience, the movie stalled about 2/3 of the way in. I had to unplug my roku and my router so that amazon would quit trying to stream nothing to me.

The maddening thing is this never happens on Netflix over Roku, and Netflix uses Amazon's network. Netflix is better at using Amazon's network than Amazon.

And i was waitiing for him because i thought their would be some explosive gun battles between him and JGL. Oh and this freakin kid. I don't see what all the talk is about him. I actually thought this movie would introduce the power and awe of this kid but not at all. Anyway, the movie is just over complex for no reason. And then its like ""oh yeah in the year 2044 people have telekinetic powers"". And then the kid is not even a tk he is freakin damien.

Joseph Gordon Levitt and Bruce Willis did an excellent job of coming together to create one character at two different ages.  The makeup, the speech and behaviors, all put together made a lot of sense.  The people in charge of set dressing and props did a great job - this movie is set 30 years in the future, so it wasn't going to be full-on Jetsons, but I expected to see some surprising inventions and they certainly came through.

5645624,5,B00BLOKNVK,"I was not expecting great things from this film. From the trailer I gathered that it was going to be an attempt to put a new spin on the time travel theme. Usually, when a film has what I consider to be an overly ""clever"" premise (for lack of a better word) I wind up being disappointed. Movies with overly clever premises usually wind up being all about the premise, and they tend to leave out other things that I think are important: interesting characters, an interesting plot, and some thematic material with some substance. So that is what I was expecting with this film. I assumed I would be entertained, but I was not expecting much more than that. What I got was much more interesting, and much more satisfying, than what I was expecting.

First of all, the makers of this movie were clearly aware that they were operating with a well worn premise. We have all seen so many time travel movies and shows that we have become jaded. The interesting paradoxes that arise when trying to think about time travel are no longer all that interesting. They no longer blow minds the way they used to. There is a scene in this movie where young Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and old Joe (Bruce Willis) are sitting at a diner and young Joe starts to ask the standard, mind-bending, time travel questions (""so when I do things does it change your memory?"", etc.). Old Joe essentially brushes him off by saying ""If we start talking about that we are going to be talking about it all day"". I take this to be the filmmakers saying to the audience ""We know you have heard all of this before so we are not going to repeat it."" I always appreciate it when filmmakers are self-conscious enough to know when they are bordering on cliche. Ultimately it is probably impossible to avoid cliche entirely in a time travel movie, but I appreciated the nod to the audience, and this movie actually does succeed in avoiding cliche. It is hard to imagine a time travel movie that has something new to say, but this one does (though, not necessarily about time travel, which is not really what this movie is about).

The goal of the movie did not seem to me to be to ""bend minds"". In fact, while the premise is an interesting premise, I felt like the premise was really just a means to explore some more interesting themes. Themes about the cycle of violence, and how to break it, and about personal transformation. It also raises some interesting questions about how we look back on our old selves. Old Joe does not think very highly of young Joe. While very few of us have probably ever had the experience of traveling back in time and talking to our old selves in person (I have, but I am an exception) I think we can all relate to old Joe's attitude towards his younger self. With perspective, and hopefully a little personal growth, our past errors, and stupidity, often become glaring. This movie dramatizes that universal human experience by having Joe's young and old selves actually come face to face.

The premise, in other words, is not just clever for the sake of being clever, it serves a purpose, and it allows the filmmakers to explore a number of interesting ideas and themes, which is what I think good movies, and good premises, are supposed to do. There is a real human story at the center of this film. It is certainly an exciting, and entertaining movie, but the center of the movie is a human story about original sin and redemption. When I say 'original sin', I do not mean 'original sin' in the theological sense. I just mean that the violence of the world existed before we were born and we were all, to some degree, victims of that violence before we were old enough to make conscious decisions, and we all tend to perpetuate that violence, to some degree, into the future by visiting it upon future generations, before they are old enough to make conscious decisions, and so on. That, to me, is really what this movie is about.

There is one last thing that I really appreciated about this film: it trusted its audience. That is so rare. To explain what I mean I am going to have to give some things away about the plot, so this is my SPOILER ALERT. The ""hero"" of the film is really kind of an anti-hero. Joe is already an assassin when the movie begins. Now, it seems like most films would do everything they could to downplay that, and try to sell the audience on the ""assassin with a heart of gold"". This movie goes in exactly the opposite direction. Early in the movie Joe sells out his best friend for money, and even old Joe, who is supposed to be reformed, makes it his mission to kill ""The Rainmaker"". Old Joe knows ""The Rainmaker"" is one of three kids, but he does not know which, and so he starts killing them one at a time (two of them, remember, are innocent). Most movies would have found a way around all of that. There would have been some plot twist that would have revealed who ""The Rainmaker"" was before old Joe actually killed anyone, or young Joe would have knocked the gun out of old Joe's hands just in time. Most filmmakers would not have trusted their audience to stick with a main character with such a dark side.

Filmmakers (or maybe it is the studios) seem to think that audiences want morally unambiguous characters, or, that audiences are unwilling to put up with any moral ambiguity, complexity, or subtlety. Movies have to go all one way or the other with characters. Either they are good, in which case they can never do anything morally reprehensible, or even morally ambiguous, or they are evil, in which case they are pure evil and have no conscience at all. Fimmakers (or studios) seem to think that audiences are incapable of understanding anything more subtle than that. I do not think that is true, and it frustrates me. The world is morally complex and ambiguous, and morally complex and ambiguous characters tend to make the most interesting characters, so I wish that more movies had the guts to do what this movie did: have a hero who was clearly very flawed and unlikable in many ways. The main character in this film does not fall into either extreme. He is certainly not ""good"". He does things that are genuinely morally reprehensible. But he has a conscience, at least at times. It is just that his own self-interest tends to outweigh his conscience most of the time (does that sound at all familiar?) So I just want to say how much I appreciated the fact that the filmmakers trusted their audience enough to make their main character so morally ambiguous.

This movie is far deeper than the marketing would have you believe and frankly it should have been nominated for a best picture. Time travel is the ""branding"" of the movie but it's not important to the story. In fact the characters go as far as to tell you not to think about it and you take heed of their warning. The less you know about the plot the better, just watch and let the movie happen. Looper is mythology in it's true form and executed with outstanding performances and cinematography. I give it five stars because to me it is one of the most impactful movies I have ever seen but it is far from a movie that everyone can watch. This film is violent in a very real and human way, not a mindless action movie way. The violence isn't glorified or gratuitous, it is merely necessary for the story.

It was fun to watch but I have one big gripe that I couldn't help but knock it down a star for this review for:

Joseph Gordon-Levitt's makeup was HORRID.  They tried to make him look like Bruce Willis (for obvious reasons) and instead made a freak out of him.  It was so bad from a couple angles that he didn't even look like a real person.  Let my mind do the work on believing he's a young Bruce Willis, I can do that all on my own.  Your terrible makeup with the screwed-up eyebrows and bone structure makeup almost ruined it for me.  Thank goodness through most of the movie they're not forcing that on you or my rating would have gone way down.

5645645,5,B00BLOKNVK,"Time travel movies generally are exercises in style over substance, they aim to be pleasing and often succeed. Rian Johnson's Looper manages to be as smart as it wants to be and as entertaining as any movie I have seen this year. A smart, thriller that is not afraid to trust that it's audience is willing to think and still enjoy themselves.
 Starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and set in a vivid, but understated future. Gordon-Levitt plays Joe, a cynical blunderbuss carrying hitman, who assassinates individuals sent from the future so that no bodies are left in their present. Thirty years in the future, the
loopers are themselves sent down the line to be offed by their younger self, this is called closing the loop. As he makes clear, this job doesn't attract forward thinkers.
 Joe has plans to retire, learn French and live out his days in Europe. When his loop is compromised by his older self (Bruce Willis), who has come back prepared to take it on the lam. The older Joe isn't interested in just running to save his own life, he has a plan to search out the leader of a future criminal organization and kill him. This leaves Gordon-Levitt's Joe in a tight spot that he hopes to get himself out of by hiding out on a farm with a woman (Emily Blunt) and her 10 year-old son, Cid (Pierce Gagnon). Their roles in all this becomes more clear as the two Joes prepare for a final face off.
 A complicated plot, twisty as time travel tales often are. Happily, it all seems to come together in a bold unexpected ending. I saw the movie in a full house, when the credits come up there is no outro music and the audience was stone silent in pleasant surprise. Kudos to Johnson's excellent, well thought out and provocative script.
 This is Johnson's third film, following the brilliant high school neo-noir Brick, which failed to find an audience partially because of it's cold narrative and unusual structure. His second film was the slight, but slightly wonderful romantic comedy adventure the Brothers Bloom. Looper is his best movie so far, I can't wait to see what this unique and very talented filmmaker comes up with next, it will almost certainty be something fresh and original. A talent to keep an eye on for sure.
 In his supporting role,  top-billed Willis shows that he is still every bit an action star, but he also gets a chance to remind us that he is an underrated character actor who has anchored more than his share of tough dramatic roles over the years. This is not just his best movie in a long while, but his best role in years. He has a tricky part here, he is neither hero, nor villain, managing to be equal parts of both while maintaining audience identification. A common man action star like Gene Hackman in his day, Willis should be allotted more roles like this.
 Jeff Daniels is also very good, an unlikely casting choice, stealing his few scenes as a gangster and cast against type as the movie's lead villain. Gordon-Levitt and Daniels were previously in the excellent, but little seen heist thriller the Lookout. Daniels is a good actor often wasted in forgettable roles, not so here.
 Make no mistake though, this is Gordon-Levitt's movie, having previously starred in the director's Brick, the part was written for the young actor. A formidable presence and one of the very best actors of his age, Gordon-Levitt has been in a number of good films, giving solid performances, yet has remain relatively unknown up to this point. Under some impressive make-up to resemble a young version of Willis, this should be the film that makes stardom no longer aloof for the talented young actor.
 Dealing with themes of regret and repentance, as well as moral affecting choices things such as predication versus free will. Johnson has written an existentially moody script, it's not a heavy handed or pretentious one and should appeal to those who have enjoyed the best work of Christopher Nolan, in the past. The plot twists are well handled and followed through to their inevitable conclusions. The movie that Looper most makes me think of is Le Jette and it's English language remake, the Bruce Willis starrer 12 Monkeys. Looper is as smart as people think Inception is and as smart as Minority Report wanted to be.

5645658,4,B00BLOKNVK,"Intelligent sci-fi is a relatively rare beast these days, so its gratifying to see someone trying  even when it arguably doesnt work on every level.  In the case of this movie, we have time travel as the maguffin. Criminal organisations of the future now have access to time travel, and use it to dispose of people they want rid of, sending them back to loopers - assassins who are paid by the bars of silver attached to the victims.  This arrangement is lucrative for the loopers, but has one drawback  one day they will be asked to close the loop, when their own future self is sent back for disposal, so that no future police force can identify who is breaking the law outlawing time travel.
Joseph Gordon-Levitt is the key performer here, more so than Willis  though its always absurdly satisfying to see our Bruce pick up a machine gun and start wrecking the place..  Willis is Levitts future self, but when sent back to be killed by his younger self things don't go according to plan, and they both end up on the run, with both converging on the farmhouse of Emily Blunt and her son. At least, thats where things kick off.. this set up is just a starting point for an intriguing set up to an unexpected showdown.  Emily Blunt is excellent, and her son played by Pierce Gagnon defies expectation of child actors to play his own unique character believably.
Plaudits to the script then that makes things interesting while avoiding getting too wrapped up in the paradoxes and logic issues with time travel.

5645699,3,B00BLOKNVK,"Time travel stories are... difficult. Star Trek is proof of that. I think two things play into it: 1. No one can agree on how time travel would actually work if it's possible. Or if it's possible. 2. Because of that, writers like to use it as a magic wand. It's one of those things I kind of hate in science fiction, when the writer uses some bit of science like it's magic just because no one knows how it works. If you want to write magic, go write fantasy.

Still, all in all, I don't think the time travel was handled too poorly in Looper other than the constant paradoxes that were never addressed. What I have a problem with is being lied to, and, in essence, the movie hinges on a lie, and that really bothers me.

Now, I don't have a problem with being deceived through sleight-of-hand and trickery. The Sixth Sense is so great because Shyamalan  never lied to the audience. He laid everything out there for us to see and allowed us not to see it. A couple of movies that are very similar except that one lies and one doesn't are The Prestige and The Illusionist (which I talk about for a bit here). The Illusionist achieves its climax by lying to the audience (through omission) all the way through, which is the only reason we are unable to piece the plot together. I really have no respect for that.

Now, if you haven't seen Looper, there will be spoilers.

The whole story of Looper hinges on  the belief by the audience that young Joe dies when he falls from the ladder. At that point, the movie jumps back as if that is the moment that causes the reset. When it starts over, we accept that we are seeing a different time line because of the presentation, and it's not true. It's not like in The Sixth Sense when Crowe gets shot. Afterward, the audience just assumes that Crowe didn't die even though Shyamalan tells us several times, ""look, this guy's dead."" We just can't see it. In Looper, the truth is never offered until the end, when the lie is revealed, and that's just a cheap way of doing it.

To make matters worse, the director or the writer or someone comes out and tells us that the movie isn't going to make any sense and not to think about it. Young Joe and Old Joe are sitting in a diner together, and Young Joe asks Old Joe about time travel, and Old Joe says, ""I don't want to talk about time travel because, if we start talking about it, then, we're going to be here all day talking about it, making diagrams with straws."" Rough translation: ""Don't think about it; just watch the movie. We can't explain it either."" On the one hand, I'm glad they're honest about it. ""Look, we just want to tell our story, so don't go trying to logic it, because it won't make any sense."" [And it doesn't.] On the other hand, I'm kind of insulted. It says to me that they didn't want to bother with telling a story that makes sense, which devalues me as the audience. And, then, they lie to make it work.

The other thing that really bothers me is that the movie didn't happen, and I hate stories that didn't happen. I hate getting to the end and finding out that it was all a dream or a vision or a whatever. I mean, this was as bad as Next with Nicolas Cage. You get to the end and find out that, really, the movie ended right there when Young Joe kills Old Joe at the beginning of the movie. That's it. End of story. Everything else is just ""closing the loop"" and doesn't actually exist. I really felt cheated.

Even so, there are some good moments in the film. When Old Seth is trying to get to Young Seth and losing body parts all along the way... man, that's just freaky. It doesn't make any sense from a paradox perspective, but it's creepy enough that you don't care. The horror of that moment as his fingers start disappearing is gut wrenching. Also, I really liked Paul Dano as Young Seth.

There's a lot of humor, dark humor, in the fact that Old Joe keeps beating the crap out of his younger self. There's the urge to slap Young Joe for not listening to his older self, but, then, that's how all kids are, right?  And there's the fact that the good guys don't win. How could they? There are no good guys. But there aren't a lot of movies these days where the protagonist (hero or anti-hero) fails, and that's almost enough to make Looper worth watching all by itself.

If you're willing to just turn your brain off and watch and if you don't mind being lied to, Looper is definitely worth your time, just don't ever say, ""But why...?""

Oh, also, a big part of why Looper works is the inherent belief of the audience (and that includes me) in the badassness of Bruce Willis. There is nothing in the movie to support Joe being any kind of badass. In fact, he's more of a loser, drug addict than anything else. However, because our image of Willis is that he's a badass, we don't question him single-handedly taking down a criminal organization even though there is nothing in the movie to support this.",1361750400,,4928,4.3145945945945945

5645705,4,B00BLOKNVK,"Bruce Willis seems to likes Sci Fi, time travel, super mental powers, and movies that require a lot of creative editing to move the story along.  Looper falls into the same.  Even though it only garnered 3.5 stars here on Amazon, I took it for a spin, and actually really enjoyed it.  Normally, I find 99% of movies to be fairly predictable, even the ones that claim to have ""surprises"" in them.  This flick gets around that by building some well edited and kinda freaky scenes on top of an easy to understand premise.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt (playing the main protagonist, Joe) starts out slow, but eventually builds into a nice younger version of Bruce (the older Joe), complete with smirk (he probably studied that in the mirror for a while to get it just right).  Joe is not exactly the best good guy out there.  He definitely takes the road of self preservation first, but somehow manages to come around to a fitting end, for his character and for the movie.

The acting overall is not bad.  The action sequences are pretty good. There is not a lot of need for special effects or very fancy CGI to make this movie hum.

5645720,4,B00BLOKNVK,"You can never go wrong in choosing a movie that stars Bruce Willis or Joseph Gordon-Levitt, but when they come together, that's when the magic really happens! Looper is the brainchild of Rian Johnson, who likes to bring us unusual stories, that mainly star JGL, however Looper is much easier to follow than most of Johnson's other films. While I'm not his biggest fan, his attention to detail has always really stood out to me and is perhaps never more evident than in Looper. Johnson actually used make-up and special effects to make JGL resemble a young Bruce Willis, which I found to be ingenious. Not to be overlooked is of course how clever a story Looper is, as it blends together time travel and the mafia. In the future, time travel has been invented, but like every other good thing, it is illegal. The mafia controls time travel and uses it as a weapon to commit murder. In this future world, it is impossible to dispose of a body, so the mafia sends their targets back in time where they are met an executed by a hired gun, known as a looper. The performances are of course top notch, Willis, the action star of a generation, only gets better with age, and JGL is the simply put the hardest working, most under appreciated actor in all of Hollywood. To be completely honest, this intriguing, action-packed, thriller was not as good as I expected it to be, and I really didn't care for the way in ended.

That's unfortunate because I was truly hoping that this film would be the next Memento; a groundbreaking and mindbending blend of entertainment and art.  Looper doesn't even come close.

Rian Johnson's much buzzed about screenplay is set in the year 2044 where a group of hitmen known as Loopers carry out executions against targets sent to them from crime bosses from the future, thirty years in the future to be exact, when time travel has been invented but is illegal and utilized almost exclusively by crime organizations as a means to tie up loose ends.  One of the Loopers named Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), is placed in an unusual predicament when one of his targets is his future self (Bruce Willis) who has been sent back to be killed in order to ""close the loop"".  Confused yet?  Essentially when a looper's services are no longer needed, his future self is sent back in time for execution since the mob wants to make sure that he never rats them out somewhere down the line.

That concept requires the willing suspension of disbelief from viewers, but the real problem isn't with how absurd the whole thing is.  No, the problem is with the execution.  The movie never seems to flow coherently and feels flung together haphazardly.  Perhaps things would have turned out better if Johnson had let someone else have the director's chair.  His screenplay is brimming with ideas, but he doesn't do a very good job of bringing his vision to the screen.

The performances are poor as well.  Gordon-Levitt's likability and charm are buried beneath the ridiculous prosthetics that he wears in order to resemble a young Bruce Willis.  He spends the entire film mumbling his lines in his best attempt to sound jaded and world-weary.  Willis, who is almost always a reliable action hero, doesn't have much to work with here and his character is one dimensional and bland.  Only Jeff Daniels as a mob boss sent from the future to manage the loopers approaches the material with the kind of ""let's not take things quite so seriously"" attitude that seems more fitting.

It's too bad that Looper fails so mightily since its premise is ripe for a great movie.  This just isn't that movie.  It would have been better served by a different cast, a different director and a different tone.  In short, an entirely different movie.",1361491200,4,2470,4.767058823529411
5645722,1,B00BLOKNVK,"What bothers me most of all was that if I had once third of the money it took to make this piece of Hollywood trash that I just spent 1 1/2 hour of my life watching I could lead the rest of my life in luxury in the Bahamas. As it is, this disposable clunker will sink without a trace, without bringing a single moment of pleasure or insight to the human race. Now that's what I call tragedy. As usual, the film begins with explosive violence, people being killed, shot in the head, chest, while a cute little soundtrack plays in the background. We are then greeted by a few further killings, enormous guns, a dumb (really dumb) explanation of time travel and certain shennanigans having to do with hit men, killers, disposing of bodies, etc. The narrator attempts to explain this to us in certain occasional remarks (""Now this is what we call closing the loop"" and other really - really  - dumb sounding statements). As usual - excessive violence, needless killings, drug use, prostitution, nudity, all add up to a total bore. I'm now convinced after watching a few Hollywood films of the last year of two things: (1) the only thing worth watching are shows like Game of Thrones, Boardwalk Empire, Downton Abbey, that have some life and drama to them instead of endless bloodshed and bad acting, and (2) Lynch and Cronenberg are our only great directors. One half hour of Cosmopolis or Dangerous Method has more content and drama and insight than all this kind of trash. Avoid. F.",1361491200,3,1480,4.584905660377358
5645723,3,B00BLOKNVK,"""Looper"" is perhaps better tackled in two halves: the action half, and the not-so-much-action half. During the action half, we're introduced to the concept of Loopers, druggy hitmen who are hired to off mob targets sent back in time. Loopers are eventually forced (for reasons never totally clear) to kill their own future selves, discovering a golden payday when they do. Then they've got 30 years to live it up. Predictably, the main character doesn't pull the trigger on himself when he's supposed to. Chases, violence, cool effects, nice score ... decent fare up until this point.

Then the film drags us out to a farm, where the action grows as slow as the sugar cane in the fields. A seemingly throwaway line about telekinetic mutations comes into play. We meet a mom who simply doesn't invoke the warm fuzzies like the film intends, and a little kid who is about as charming as Damien in ""The Omen."" There's an affair that feels forced. Then we have Bruce Willis back in the city, committing actions that cause us to lose all sympathy for the character. This film just begs you not to like anyone in it.

For the rest of us, 2 stars is being generous; and it's only due to great acting by all involved... something that's rare these days.  It's refreshing to see films that are cast based on talent, not just name-recognition (see movies with J.Lopez &/or ""The Rock"" D.Johnson, for 2 great examples).

But I digress.
Despite the great acting, I struggled on the rating because the ending is *awful*... in every possible way... which nearly earned it a 1.

If you're someone who actually pays attention to the films they watch; and need for them to make (at least, some) sense, in order to enjoy them... By all means, RENT this first.
If you're someone who thinks the most important things in a film is how much action there is, how fast the editing & pacing is, &/or how 'amazing' the special/visual effects are, etc., etc... By all means, go ahead and buy it.

There is grit, action, and brains to this movie.  The characters are strong, believable, and you want to follow each of them on their path.

5645754,3,B00BLOKNVK,"In my youth I read a lot of science fiction:  Clarke, Heinlein, Asimov, et. al.  But I never enjoyed time travel as a plot device because of the old paradox problem:  I go back in a time machine to the time before my parents met and kill my father.  Therefore, I could not have existed in the future to go back in time to begin with.  Or better yet I go a back in time and kill Albert Einstein when he is a child.  As a result the entire history of the world instantly changes.  Balderdash.  On the other hand, going forward in time is at least a reasonable concept.  But I couldn't meet myself as an old man in that future time, because I had departed from my original time stream to travel into the future.  There couldn't be two of me existing at the same time.  My God, one is plenty.  ""Looper"" is just that sort of story and I keep saying, ""Wait a minute, that just doesn't add up!""

There once was a fellow named Brite,
Whose speed surpassed that of light.
He departed one day,
And in a relative way
Returned on the previous night.

Having got that off my chest I can say ""Looper"" is a well made and acted film.  I always enjoy watching Joseph Gordon-Levitt who brings an intensity to his roles.  He was particularly fine in ""The Lookout,""  ""Mysterious Skin"" and ""Brick""  I even enjoyed his small role in ""The Black Knight Rises"" especially when we find out who he really is.

I thought it was going to be a low budget, grade B movie, and exclusively centered on time travel -- but it isn't.  Well acted, good story, good effects...in a word, immersive.  I would have rated it five stars, except the science fiction (time travel) end of it was a bit predictable.  Maybe I'm splitting hairs, but it seems whenever a story contains time travel, the causality is a little too linear, or neat.  They touched on this briefly -- the main character (Willis) refers to a certain fogginess of mind due to changes in his memory, but as usual the character isn't really affected, and the environment/circumstances do not change.  I guess it's difficult to make such changes and maintain a coherent storyline.

5645767,2,B00BLOKNVK,"a young man kills for a living, without apparently any problem with it, gets high, dresses well, parties with his friends, drives a nice car, and sleeps with his favorite prostitute.  Later, because it's a time travel science fiction film, he meets an older version of himself (Bruce Willis), who figures out he must kill 3 kids, and this may perhaps save his future, beloved wife.  Most of the film is death, destruction and unpleasantness, with a few minutes of redemption at the end.  Unappealing story unsympathetically told, though the actors are good.  If the filmmaker was determined to show the work habits and lifestyle of an unrepentant assassin, I'd have preferred he'd shown the assassin's origin story, which may have at least allowed the audience to generate some sympathy for the lead character, if say, for example, he'd been forced by circumstance and lack of other options into his career choice.  As presented though, I don't understand what value the writer thought this story would have for his audience - it's not entertaining to see a male character kill over and over and over again, bound, gagged, kneeling victims which the assassin murders and whose remains he discards unceremoniously in a furnace.  I read that critics said the assassin fell in love with the Emily Blunt character, but I saw no sign of that - I saw a sex scene between them, not love.  The assassin seemed to sympathize with the rainmaker child, because the assassin himself was abandoned by his mother, and he and the child had a conversation - if anything there was a connection between the assassin and the rainmaker, but the child was written so creepily, it diluted the audience's ability to care for him, except of course we don't want a child murdered.  So, basically, no place to connect to the story emotionally for the audience; the assassin was presented doing his job, in the first 10 minutes or so we see him murder maybe 8 people, can't connect to a character like that; Emily Blunt's character enters the story in an unappealing manner - the only glimmers of positive feeling I saw the characters share were between the Bruce Willis character and his wife, and the Emily Blunt character and her devil spawn son; these glimmers were brief though, and not enough to attach an audience, i.e., to help an audience get emotionally involved in the story.  And if a storyteller is not trying to get his audience to care, why tell the story.

Additional thoughts - I suspect the writer had an idea of his story being a learning curve for his lead, who experiences an epiphany at the story's end and is able to compare, by how destructively he's led his own life, and how other characters tell him the rainmaker as an adult brings death/destruction on others, that the lead needs to kill himself (which will stop his older self, Bruce Willis, from killing the rainmaker's mother), and that this sacrifice might stop the future violence of the rainmaker - that perhaps the only way the rainmaker will not become a monster, will be to allow him his mother's care and guidance during his childhood.  The problem for the audience is this realization comes to the lead at the story's end, long after he has been established in the story as a cold blooded killer of many, including the murder of an innocent child his Bruce Willis self erroneously suspects as being the rainmaker child.  The lead is totally unsympathetic to the audience by the time he makes his sacrifice, so the value of the sacrifice is almost entirely lost on us.  The writer needed to have his lead do something positive long before his sacrifice, before he met the rainmaker child, to help the audience see him as something other than an assassin, which, after all, the writer establishes his lead as being.  A story is a proof, an argument - the writer wants to change a villan into a hero over the course of his story; he successfully introduces his lead as a villan (unrepentant assassin), but fails in transitioning him into a hero within the story in a believable way.  A single heroic act at the story's end doesn't make the lead a hero, it just confuses the audience to see a character who has been previously established as a villan, out of the blue, perform a heroic act.  If the writer wants his lead to be a hero, he needs to write situations in the story which allows the audience to witness the lead's path to heroism.  Basically, the writer didn't give enough evidence (information) of the lead's heroism over the course of the story.  In his next effort, I hope the writer will do better - he nailed the villan part, giving plenty of evidence, and I see where he wanted to go; he just left out two or three situations where a good guy vibe for his lead was required, and the audience needed to witness those scenes before the lead met the rainmaker and the rainmaker's mother.",1360886400,,4860,4.67096018735363

5645774,5,B00BLOKNVK,"Unlike most cookie-cutter stuff you see these days, this movie has a very creative & original premise.  The cast is FANTASTIC, which should tell you something about the quality of the movie if these big names believed in it.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis make an excellent younger/older self pairing.  The little kid is scary good, especially for his age, and Emily Blunt is always a pleasure.

If you can muster any ""suspension of disbelief"" at all, this movie is a sure bet.  Beware, that the movie is raw and violent, but any movie about assasins is bound to be.  I highly recommend this movie.

BTW, they don't kill the victims in the future for fear of leaving evidence of death behind, a real concern according to the storyline.  It's cleaner to send them back...

5645798,4,B00BLOKNVK,"Rian Johnson does characters in heightened realities so well. This is a great example. The time travel is really incidental to the story he's telling and the situations are all in the service of the choices the character(s) make so, as a thinking man's science fiction, it's a great film. My only real complaint, given tolerance for the time travel arguments and petty details about the future etc, is that the female character is a weak link. She's pretty much the usual woman who's trying to be tough but isn't and has to be rescued by the hero for most of the film. In the end, you see she has more grit than that but for most of the film, she's really not very strong and since she's played to be strong, it's annoying. Other than that, great movie, great cast, interesting concept. Now go rent Brick for more of Johnson's character work.
As for the disk itself, it's a good transfer, clean and clear. I only resent not being offered a BluRay/DVD combination. Too many friends don't have BluRay so I can't loan it out to make more fans.",1360454400,,1040,4.478947368421053

5645865,3,B00BLOKNVK,"""Looper,"" written and directed by Rian Johnson (""Brick"" ""The Brothers Bloom""), plays out like a made-for-TV Philip K. Dick adaptation. This is basically a TV episode or a 20 minute short film drawn out to be a 120 minute feature film. The film has one great idea that is intelligent and thought-provoking, but sadly the rest of the film is mostly generic and clich, despite the fine acting from always reliable Joseph Gordon-Levitt and charismatic Bruce Willis.

The ""looper"" is a sort of contract killer getting rid of people sent from the future by criminal organizations. There is a set of rules for disposing the victims, but the most important is that you cannot let anyone escape - even if your next target is yourself.

After the fairly entertaining first 30 minutes, ""Looper"" quickly loses momentum, looking for a story to tell. Unfortunately, the best Rian Johnson could think of seems to be the ""TK"" idea, which only makes the film's second half so predictable. The impressive cast is doing a good job, but despite their effort, it is hard for me to care any one of the characters they play. Also, Emily Blunt and Piper Perabo are both wasted.

Any films about time-travelling have some inherent flaws which I will not repeat here. Even great films like ""The Terminator"" and its sequel (I'm talking about ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"") are not perfectly free from them. But they have believable characters we can relate to, with a great story to tell, something ""Looper"" really needs.",1359936000,4,1493,4.847058823529411

5645877,3,B00BLOKNVK,I had the premise of this movie before we rented it.  The writing and plot were well written and portrayed.  The only problem is that the concluding plot point which was only hinted at at the beginning of the movie was severely underdeveloped.  Once you see the last 20 minutes you will get my point on this.,1359936000,,308,4.368421052631579

5645884,2,B00BLOKNVK,"I hoped for a slick, Hollywood style high tension sci fi thriller, and that describes this move. Why only two stars? I was disappointed by some aspects of the film, and disgusted with one in particular.
First the good: this is a high quality production, with good actors, great scenery, professional editing, and an absence of weak characters. Everyone involved worked together to make a polished product.

There were problems with believability, even inside of a sci fi story. How likely was it that the lead characters could run through a hail of full automatic gunfire from a dozen shooters, and walk away in one piece, while all the shooters end up dead? If you watch movies like this, you know the probability is approximately 100%. I know that it is just make-believe, but it gets tiresome.

There are some twists and turns to the plot, but I would not call this an intelligent film. It doesn't stretch the imagination like Inception.

This film deals in death, and death comes in high volume. The main character carries a shotgun, and his bosses carry absurdly oversized revolvers. The death count starts with the opening scene, and there aren't many death free scenes. Guns fire, the blood flies, bodies splatter, and bystanders are covered in blood, although not very realistically (through the ignorance of the filmmakers, not from a lack of trying). Some of the machine gunning takes place in a dance like sequence, although half of the dance card is a fresh corpse. The oversize handguns become a fetish object, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, the main character uses his shotgun as his signature prop. So many bodies pile up in one scene that the living characters practically wade through them. Even children are shot, and one is executed by a main character, although that particular death happens off-screen. There was way too much shooting and killing in this movie, much more than necessary, even though violence was central to the story. In the end there is one uplifting message, but it is buried in the gore.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt is the star and a producer of Looper. Some of his personal interests are included in the story. For example, he is a Francophile, and his character practices speaking French between kills. Ironically, his real life parents are founding members of the Progressive Jewish Alliance, an organization that lists an ""end to gun violence"" as one of their signature public efforts. They should have a talk with their son before they try to remodel the country. The culture of death starts at home.",1359849600,3,2535,4.9020979020979025

5645888,4,B00BLOKNVK,"I read mostly tepid reviews of this movie.  I found the movie to be much better than the reviews suggested.  Some elements of the story don't really make sense...  Why does organized crime have control over time travel for example?  Who knows.  If you can get past those elements, it's a solidly acted and thoroughly entertaining movie.

5645892,4,B00BLOKNVK,"Time travel movies require a certain amount of acceptance on the part of the viewer. Paradoxes abound, and to paraphrase one of the characters in the movie, thinking too much about it will turn your brain into a fried egg. Once you stop worrying about the contradictions of time travel, this is a well-made, enjoyable film that has elements of ""Terminator"" , ""12 Monkeys"" and ""the Walking Dead"" to name a few. The performances, especially Joseph Gordon-Leavitt, are solid. There are some dead spots in the middle, but overall it's very good film.",1359849600,,546,4.881720430107527

5645904,1,B00BLOKNVK,"With Bruce Willis you expect some blood, fighting, and profanity in movies. This was nothing as clean as the commercials for the movie. Bruce Willis and others were frequently taking the Lord's name in vain.  There were murders with plenty of blood done by different people - even by a young child - without any sense of remorse or loss.

The only really good parts were
1) changes in the memory of the older version of the character (played by Willis) getting stronger and weaker as the younger version of the character did normal actions or actions he did not do the first time.
2) how the movie ended. (no spoilers here!).

They both brought enough of themselves to the role while also adopting mannerisms unique to each other. This was nice, and at first the movie looked to be promising, but then it just got confusing and never recovered. The action was fast, gritty, and intense, the dialogue was clever and exactly what you expect from a Bruce Willis film, but none of it made any sense half-way through the film. It's a shame. There are much better sci-fi action flicks out there.

NONE of the events prior should have happened -- but it did happen even though ""Character XYZ"" NEVER EXISTED. People still remember ""Character XYZ"" even though he/she NEVER EXISTED.

5645933,4,B00BLOKNVK,"""Looper"" is a violent but rewarding action movie that delves into the mental conundrum of time travel, enjoys the mental crisis it creates, then backs off just far enough so that it's an enjoyable couple of hours. It's a heady flick that asks several questions of the viewer, especially: Would you kill your past or future self off if it meant protecting someone you love?

""Looper"" stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt , Bruce Willis, and Emily Blunt, and is directed by Rian Johnson, a relative newcomer whose claim to fame is 2005's neat little oddball film Brick [HD], which he also wrote and directed. Interestingly enough, it also starred Gordon-Levitt.

This time around, Rian Johnson offers us a clever take on futuristic action films, and ""Looper"" by and large succeeds, offering Willis in a somewhat typical role of a rough-and-tumble killer, but this time he has a sentimental side. He's been brought back from the future to be murdered (called ""Closing the Loop"" for reasons I'll explain in the next paragraph), and he hopes his actions here, in HIS past, might save the woman he loves in his PREVIOUS present (NOW and forevermore his future).

You see, Willis plays Joe, whose younger self (played by Gordon-Levitt) is a unique kind of assassin. Thirty years from the movie's ""present"" (it's set in 2044, so ITS future is 2074), digital IDs make murder next to impossible, so organized crime bosses who want people knocked off have to send them back in time with hands tied and hoods on their heads, where they are immediately shot dead and their bodies incinerated. However, something new is going on in the future, and a new crime boss (called ""the Rainmaker"") is bent on consolidating power by killing the KILLERS themselves through capturing them, sending them back, and having the killers kill THEMSELVES, thus ""Closing the Loop""--get it?

But Willis, whom I'll call Future Joe for clarity's sake, is smart (of course), and he outwits Present Joe and escapes. What happens is too complex to fully explain here, but suffice it to say that not only does Present Joe have a lot of trouble killing Future Joe, but Future Joe's reasons for staying alive are beginning to make sense to Present Joe. Worse yet, the longer Future Joe is on the loose, the more trouble Present Joe has staying free and alive; as the killer who messed up his assassination, things are getting a bit sticky for him.

Emily Blunt comes into play as a single mother who lives by the side of a huge corn field into which Present Joe has escaped, and she reluctantly takes him in to protect him. While she warns her son to steer clear of him, Present Joe has begun to take an interest in the boy's significance, and he realizes he may need to stick around to protect him from his future self.

NOTE: leaving out an entire sub-plot which, if I were to include it, would tell you too much about the movie. Suffice it to say the movie is a bit more complex than I've presented it here, but a clear head should be able to follow it. It's no Inception, clarity-wise, but there are some definite brain-teasers, surprises and plot twists here, and director (and writer) Johnson deserves credit for making a clever movie that asks action-ers to think as they watch.

An interesting side-note: some might be thrown off by Gordon-Levitt's ""alterations,"" facially...however it was done, G-L looks a lot LIKE a younger Willis, and there are some who might find that off-putting, the kind of thing that causes them to focus on the changes and let it interfere with their enjoyment of the movie. (I mention this because some reviewers HAVE mentioned it.)

While Willis, G-L, and Blunt all handle their roles well, one character I enjoyed watching was Jeff Daniels as Abe, a ""present"" day crime boss who's actually been imported from the future so that he can better fathom and take charge of the events that transpire. Rather than portraying the typical power-hungry mobster boss, Daniels plays the role with a calm intelligence that adds an interesting element to his leadership.

When another assassin screws up his own Closing of the Loop, slightly ahead of G-L's and Willis' dilemma, Abe resists those who are falling all over themselves in order to handling it. Instead, as the narrative switches to the man who should have been assassinated, we slowly witness him ""coming apart"": first he notices one finger is missing, then another, and on and on. It's then we realize that Abe has grabbed the present day assassin and, to force the future version to turn himself in, he has begun CHOPPING. Realizing what's at stake, the future criminal can't turn himself in fast enough...literally. Suffice it to say the sequence is pretty ugly...

There are other clever tricks played with the time factor, and it makes for an entertaining--though occasionally violent--movie.

If you like a good Bruce Willis movie you should enjoy this one: it's a smart movie full of action, drama, and possesses a compelling storyline. You need to keep sharp while watching, but you don't need to master the space-time continuum. Just sit back and enjoy yourself: ""Looper"" should provide you with a pleasant couple of hours.",1359504000,,5167,4.827118644067797

5645936,5,B00BLOKNVK,"This is the best Rian Johnson movie thus far in my opinion, as always Joseph Gordon Levitt was great and it always helps to have an all-star cast alomgside the main characters of him and Bruce Willis. As far as willis goes, i'd say this was his best sci-fi film to date since i couldn't even bare to watch the trailer for surrogates. Emily Blunt is a large role towards the 2nd half and she is solid as well, and always beautiful. Even if she hasn't in my opinion been cast in any stellar roles, i think she could shine in one nonetheless. I overall thought this movie was well worth the rent and would buy it later on, i was debating renting this or Taken 2 and am very glad i chose this since i know T2 would be good, but less original. The film industry needs more sci-fi that isn't cheesy and this movie does good to deliver just that.

""Looper"" has a few interesting original aspects: what happens to your older self when someone affects the younger version (well done in the movie), for instance, levitation...

The first half of the movie sets the context and environment. Even people having no clue about what time travel can be should figure out pretty clearly what's happening, what a ""looper"" is, why are they ""looping"", what is ""closing a loop"" etc... Also, we learn that people in the future (2044) evolved and developed a sense of levitation.

I liked the first half. In the second half, without revealing too much of the plot, there are a few overlong passages where the writers couldn't get the best from the original ideas developed in the 1st part.

All in all, this is a watchable movie.

5645982,2,B00BLOKNVK,"WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.

In some ways, ""Looper"" is a good movie. It attempts a unique premise on sci-fi, with very little emphasis on CGI and special effects (they are there in limited capacity, and performed convincingly). The acting is generally quite good, particularly what is offered by the protagonist. The plot was intriguing at first, but eventually fell apart by having major holes that destroyed the suspension of disbelief, in addition to undoing the earlier established ""rules"" of this particular fiction. The opening twenty minutes or so of the movie are riveting... but then things start to go south.

Although the efforts at creating a bleak 2044 Kansas are partially successfull, it's pretty jarring when everybody's driving around in current gen Ford F-150s and Chevy Silverados. And why are the ""gat men"" waltzing around with antiquated six shooters, when there are fully automatic assault rifles RIGHT NEXT to them, just waiting for their enemy to pick up (which he does, of course, before going on a cartoon-like killing spree that defies the otherwise somber tone of the movie). The murder of Old Joe's wife in the future completely unravels the earlier established premise that the mob is unable to kill in their own time, thereby ruining the entire concept of the film, and making every action of every character nonsensical and without consequence.

Furthermore, the rules of time travel are changed from scene to scene, for whatever needs the writer/director needs, until it becomes a bird's nest of paradoxes that don't hold up under even mild scrutiny. The director makes a weak attempt to gloss things over by having a couple of characters suggest, ""try not to think about the complications of time travel"", and Willis even pounds a table in anger at one point, repeating ""It [the rules/logic of our time travel] don't matter!"", as if shouting like an enraged toddler will nullify the gaping holes that have been poked in the film's logic. I'm completely capable of suspending my disbelief, and I rarely complain about things in fiction being ""unrealistic"", but these trespasses were too glaring to ignore, and they tarnish the experience.

What upsets me most about this movie, however, is that the movie has a character (played by Willis, no less), who goes about murdering defenseless children (granted, he only got one, but he planned on three) for reasons that are completely selfish and irredeemable. Really? You're going to murder three little kids, just so you can have a few more years with your wife? Old Joe goes on to explain that he loves his wife because she is so compassionate and nurturing... and yet he's completely comfortable with committing his own dark deeds for the sake of spending more time with her, thereby undoing any and all good she may have achieved in her life.

Yes, I understand that he is a ""villain"" of sorts in the movie (though the director clearly wants us to empathize with him, given all the time spent on flashbacks of his time with his wife), and I understand that the character is separate from the human being who is portraying him on screen, but there are certain things that are taboo, even in our society... and the murder of children is one such thing (particularly in this post-Newtown, post-Aurora world). That is not entertainment, it's cheap shock tactics. What's really disappointing is that this scene could have been EASILY avoided altogether... the character could have been abducted by the gat men on his first attempt, rather than his second, or he could have spent all his time trying to track down the true ""Rain Maker"", had that memory been bestowed upon him just a few hours earlier.

The premise is quite simple. When the mob wants to get rid of someone, it brings the someone back from the past and
to be killed by the younger self.
Does this make sense?

Anyway the first hour of so the film was well executed although why would the filmmakers picked Joseph Gordon-Levitt
and put him through 3 hours of make-up everyday just to make him resemble a bit like Bruce Willis?
So what he doesn't look like Bruce? Or maybe there are someone from the large Hollywood actoring pool who resembles Bruce.
Nevertheless, Levitt did a good job, as always.

Bruce Willis remains Bruce Willis.

The second half of the film made a 180 degree turning into a totally different storyline involving a single mother in a farm with a special boy.
Why would the write/director Rian Johnson make this ridiculous storyline is beyond comprehension.

The loopers know that their employers are phasing out loopers.

So why aren't loopers checking victims for gold plates before shooting?

Because Rian Johnson wrote it.

Some very good acting in a good-looking film, but now Johnson is three-for-three in having characters who aren't thinking nor doing what any credible individual would think or do in these situations--and no, it can't be begged off with the excuse that it's scifi. In fact, the only way an outlandish situation works in fiction is if the characters caught in it take it seriously as their reality. Not in RJ's world.

At least he's cut down on embarrassing dialogue this time around; Looper is vastly better than Brick or TBB in this regard. Otherwise, it's a plothole fest, just like his other efforts.

5646016,5,B00BLOKNVK,"Every fall season a movie comes along that lacks the hype and pandering for an audience. Instead, it is released and looks to succeed by word of mouth. Last year that film was the still under-appreciated Drive; this year my top contender is Looper.

Looper begins by introducing us to Joe, a barely recognizable Joseph Gordon-Levitt who performs the title task as a ""Looper."" Looper is a time-travel story, but roots itself firmly in a mostly-recognizable version of the near future. The only major difference is that time travel is invented soon after the present setting of the film, which allows for a somewhat confusing, but well executed, original story. Loopers are hired guns who kill for a futuristic mob that sends their hits 30 years into the past before time travel was invented. This allows for mob enemies to simply disappear in their present time and be disposed of in an earlier time when they wouldn't be investigated. Loopers are paid well to shoot first, ask no questions, and most of all be punctual as hits will suddenly appear in a predetermined location at an exact time. Allowing a ""loop"" to ""run"" results in some very unsavory consequences. The downside to Looping is that one day, every Looper's loop must close, which means the future version of yourself will be sent back for immediate execution. When this happens, a Looper gets a big final pay day and 30 years to enjoy it before the inevitable.

The premise for this film is imaginative and dealt with in a surprisingly cohesive way by director Rian Johnson. As with all great time-travel films, rules must be established so that the viewer may understand exactly what the limits are within these multiple dimensions. I provided a short discussion about some classic time travel theories in a previous blog post that you can read here. In short, this particular film's view is similar to the Back to the Future variety where you can co-exist with multiple versions of yourself and events that affect the younger version will also impact the later version. Thus, when Joe finds himself face to face with his older self, played by Bruce Willis, he inadvertently allows him to run. However, Willis' character can not simply run since he knows the consequences against Gordon-Levitt will affect him too.

The story's arc is much more far-reaching and complex than a cat-mouse chase between alternate versions of Joe. As we learn more about Joe's future from Bruce Willis, our sympathies are toyed with and our moral centers are jarred endlessly. Johnson's screenplay and direction provide powerful and conflicting motivations for both characters, making the movie deeply engaging and surprisingly fresh. Additional story lines regarding a futuristic crime boss (Jeff Daniels), a fellow Looper (Paul Dano), and farmhouse mother and her son (Emily Blunt and an Oman-esque Pierce Gagnon, respectively) all flesh out this film and give it real dimension and pragmatism, regardless of its sci-fi, time travel plot.

Looper is a tightly wound, entertaining film that has something for everyone to enjoy. There is a slight dragging feeling at the close of its second act, but this perceived lull is making way for a strong and dominant conclusion. In summary, this review only touches on the surface of what Looper accomplishes; there are multiple surprises in store for all audiences who see it, so let the word of mouth begin! A-

5646020,3,B00BLOKNVK,"I'm prepared to like just about anything with Bruce Willis in it. The premise of this film is very interesting - and in case you don't get it, there's a handy narrative by the young version of our hero. The topic of messing with the time continuum and changing outcomes has been explored many times, and here it is again - taking a look at the balance between personal desire and moral integrity. So that's all good and was entertaining to watch.

The plot, however, seemed to lumber along. There was a lack of continuity in the characters. As a viewer I couldn't decide whom I was supposed to like - the young hero, the old hero, the woman, the child-turn-monster. Just when you settle into an emotional track, the plot takes a strange turn. So overall, this movie left me disconcerted rather than fully satisfied.

Now you might say - ah, that's an intelligent film! But no - it wasn't intelligence that was disconcerting but rather bumpy story telling. Ol' Bruce played a full spectrum of emotions from total bad-ass killer to sensitive husband and father. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's nose was brilliantly matched to Bruce Willis'. Jeff Daniels put forth some really good character development.

So in essence, should you watch the movie? Sure! It's different, it'll keep you on your toes. There is some really gruesome stuff, some interesting stuff. Is it brilliant? I'd say no, but worth the 4 bucks I payed to see it.",1359072000,,1418,4.732793522267206

The problem is that the ending scene is completely nonsensical and it makes me feel cheated, as if the writers ran out of time and decided to just phone in the ending.

Great production, great premise, good acting, but an incompetent ending that disappoints as soon as the credits start rolling. If you watch this, be prepared to be let down at the end.

[minor spoilers ahead]

From the start, I was actually impressed that they defined a loosely coupled connection from past and future realities, which I think is fine if you are honest about it because it gives us a chance to see a movie we haven't already seen before. What really bothers me though is that the kid's mom wouldn't have died in the alternate future because Bruce Willis doesn't kill her in that one - he can't have even been at that farm in his future's alternate past because we clearly see him closing his loop and killing the older him. So then in what possible way is this future better than those two never going to the farm, and in what way has the kids future been altered at all? If I were playing devil's advocate, I could try to make a case that perhaps just meeting the two Joes makes him a better person, but there is no reason for us to believe that given the story told to us. It's much more likely, given what we saw, for us to assume that this is an experience that turns the kid even more dark and morbid than before.

It's almost as if the editors changed the ending in post and then added voiceovers to make it looks like that was always going to happen. Really? Ending a circle of violence that isn't a circle and actually hasn't happened at all until now? Come on guys!

5646049,3,B00BLOKNVK,"Looper(released Sept/12)stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Joe Simmons,Bruce Willis as Old Joe,Emily Blunt as Sara Rollins,Paul Dano as Seth Richards,Noah Segan as Kid Blue,Piper Perabo as Suzie,Jeff Daniels as Abe,and others. This film starts out at a fine pace,introducing us to its main characters and what they do,then everything comes to a screeching halt as the movie slows to a crawls pace and then until it drags into the finish line. This is not what I was wanting to see of a film like this with so much promise.
The story has Levitt as a looper. This is 2044 and loopers are basically just hit men. The twist is they hit peeps from the future that are sent back by crime syndicates,who are finding it hard to dispose of bodies in their time. Each hit has the payment attached to their backs,whether it be gold or silver bars. Jeff Daniels is a part of a crime syndicate from the future and is in 2044 overseeing operations. The initial kick and big money is the draw for folks that want to become loopers in the first place. The drawback is is that sometimes the people from the future will randomly decide that they want no witnesses at all to their hit's death,including the loopers that kill them. So the loopers themselves can become instant targets also.
One day Levitt is awaiting his hit,but it is late. When it does arrive it is himself(Willis),but older. Willis escapes and Levitt's butt is suddenly in a sling,and Levitt is now on the run from Daniels and his posse. Levitt and Willis do meet up,at which point rumours of a new future crime syndicate takeover by a man known as the Rainmaker,are confirmed. Willis has a number scrawled on his hand which he got from a friend in the future. It is the birth date and the hospital which the baby Rainmaker was born in. The task now is to kill the Rainmaker. Levitt goes to a farm where a single mother lives with her son. Willis in the meantime seeks out two other possibilities and dispatches both.
One of Daniels men finds Levitt and the child,but before the man can kill him the child kills the man. It seems the child has telekinetic skills of greater proportions than is the norm for 2044. It is then Levitt realizes that this is the Rainmaker. Willis meanwhile kills Daniels and his men right in their headquarters,then comes to the farm to kill the child. As Willis pursues the mother and her child across a cut cornfield,one of Willis's shots grazes the child and angers him. He ends up levitating his mother and Willis,but the mother calms him down enough for him to drop them both. Levitt in the meantime had tried escaping but the air blast from the child's initial rage has turned over his vehicle. An injured Levitt seeing Willis pursue the boy and ready to shoot the mother,decides to stop the child growing up to become the Rainmaker due to what circumstances would do to change him. Levitt kills himself,and of course Willis disappears.
The film as I said was moving along wonderfully and I was enjoying this kind of neat concept about loopers and what they do and why. However,when the plot took Levitt to the farmhouse,the film suddenly slowed to a snails pace and never regained the flow it had had previously. To get from Levitt's first introduction to Blunt,the mother of the future Rainmaker,to the end was interminably long and got very boring VERY fast. The director obviously had details and plot to tell,but this entire sequence of events should have been whittled down and edited with much more alacrity. As it was it spoiled(or me)what had come before and took away from an otherwise promising film. This was a very disappointing turn of events,but poop does happen unfortunately. As far as performances go,I have got to give Willis most of the credit with being the driving force of this film. Levitt is not as likable a lead actor as the producers would have us think and his performance was far too weak to be in the drivers seat. When Willis comes on the movie crackles with intensity and lights up. Without Willis,the ""lights"" dim considerably. I also found Jeff Daniels to be in top form also as the syndicate rep in 2044. I hadn't seen Jeff in ages and it was a nice change of pace role for him.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include deleted scenes,commentary,a featurette,the scoring and an animated trailer.
All in all a disappointing Sci-Fi flick,that SHOULD have been far better. It had a great concept and moved along well until Levitt goes to the farmhouse,and then the pace falters considerably. Willis is THE star here because Levitt just does not have the acting chops yet to carry the leading man role.",1358899200,,4669,4.646916565900846

Good Science Fiction action film, with a fair bit of action and a heavy dose of violence.

The ending is actually rather predictable to veteran Sci Fi buffs, but the flashbacks and odd interactions make following along a challenge.  This is one of those movies I wish had been executed better.  The failing may be in the editing or just put it on the director's shoulders.

The story line was enjoyable and fairly easy to follow for a movie that jumps around in time, and the futuristic difference somewhat believable. The lessons learned are good ones, but this definitely isn't one for the innocent little kids, there is some nudity, violence, and language. The relationship with his girl was not at all what the trailers I saw made it appear to be either, so don't be disappointed. I like the character, much like all of us, given a choice to do what is just for others or just right for ourselves. If you like to get caught up in multiple space timelines though stay away cause you won't like the way this movie portrays time travel since it allows infinite realities that still remain to exist with memory of the past practically no matter how the past changes only changing the future for the current timeline but no others in which case the ending for you will not matter since all timelines will still experience both the good and bad endings regardless of how it ends basically making all decisions, results, and the entire story-line practically pointless.

His character whines a little, screws up a little, and then culminates into nothing more than an awkward shoot-out with Joe toward the end of the movie. How does Sarah go from a completely independent woman, taking care of herself and a disturbed child, to being completely dependent on a stranger? It wasn't good, it wasn't bad.

5646129,5,B00BLOKNVK,"Time travel is a tricky thing.  There are some stories that can only be told with the inclusion of time travel, but usually when they start explaining the rules and discussing the possibilities things become convoluted to the point where it's really hard to make sense of it all.  Try, for instance, to make sense of the rules of time travel in Terminator and you'll end up with a headache  (only living beings can travel, but in the nude, except liquid metal resembling living beings can travel too, and sometimes the future can be changed but sometimes it can only be delayed, and so on).

Looper does not make that mistake.  They cleverly handwave the rules in one piece of dialogue: ""It doesn't matter!"".  And they're right, it doesn't.  Time travel is just an accessory here.  A means to an end, which is telling a good, scratch that, a GREAT sci-fi story.

On to the plot.  A looper is basically an executioner for hire.  Time travel doesn't exist in the time of loopers, but it will in the further future, outlawed, but still used in secrecy by organized crime.  In the future you can't get rid of a body, so they send them back in time where loopers do the killing and incinerating of the body.  There's a catch, though.  Every looper's last job is to kill their future selves (can't leave any loose threads), and they know that after they do that they retire and they have only 30 years more to live.  They accept it, knowing that their rewards will make up for their shorter life spans.

Until one of them decides he won't accept it, and escapes his past self executioner in order to get rid of the future that allows a personal tragedy, and his own execution, to happen.

This looper, Joe, is, of course, played by the main actors, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis, both of whom do a fantastic job of portraying the same person in different ages despite the fact that they don't look much like each other.  They both do an exceptional job at showing a person who suffers changes in two different ways, as we see the same person changing from hero to villain from one perspective and from villain to hero from another.

The rest of the cast also does a great job, with Emily Blunt being a highlight playing the lonely mother of a child who gets in the way of both incarnations of Joe, and Jeff Daniels as the man sent from the future to run the loopers.

Don't let the naysayers, who get confused at one of the easiest to understand movies involving time travel, talk you out of watching this film.  They probably get confused by anything smarter than The Smurfs or Hanna Montana.  If you want a good, smart sci-fi film that is still easy to understand then watch this movie.  You won't regret it.",1358553600,3,2712,4.489795918367347
5646130,1,B00BLOKNVK,"Looper as a whole has lots of problems.  First, incorporating time travel into a movie or television is always tricky and Looper has a lot of glaring holes in logic.  Second, Bruce Willis' character is on a mission to kill a mob kingpin when the kingpin is a child.  Because 3 childen were born in the same hospital at the same time, he has to try to kill 3 young children.  I didn't really care for this plot line.  Third, there are quite a few actions scense but there are also large portions of the movie that are fairly slow moving.  I was able to fast forward through many parts of the movie without losing any aspects of the plot - never a good sign.

The many stars in this movie are totally wasted.  Emily Blunt provides the best performance.",1358553600,,750,4.307142857142857

This is a good storyline with a deep Sci-Fi thriller built into it.  I won't ruin the story but just say that there are multiple twists and turns and the timeline implications will make your head spin.  The plot and scenario of the story will make you think so hard about what is happening that you may want to back the DVD up a couple of times and review and understand the possibilities.

This is a deep movie and its imaginative script will keep you thinking of all the possible issues that the characters are facing.  It is well directed and produced movie and its surprise ending will keep you thinking about the complications of what might happen.

I find myself checking the info pane on my dvd player to see how much time is left on a lot of movies these days. I didn't have to do that with this movie. That's a sign of a good movie for me. Also a good sign is when is analyzing all the plot lines 30 minutes after the movie is done. That happened with this movie in the same fashion of Inception, or when The Matrix first came out. I know a lot of people include plot summaries in their reviews, but I'm not going to do that. What I will say is Gordon-Levitt is  becoming a pretty good leading man. Bruce Willis plays the same character Bruce Willis has played since the 80's, and that's fine, that's what he does, and it's great. Also, good supporting roles by Jeff Daniels and Emily Blunt.

So what's really great about Looper is that the movie strays away from even trying to explain the hows and what-ifs. Looper sticks to the simple story of a scenario where time travel does indeed exist, and what happens to the life of an assassin when a criminal organization is using time travel to send those they want killed into the past to said assassin.

Director Rian Johnson gets great performances out of Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Young Joe) and Bruce Willis (Old Joe). Johnson's make up crew does an astounding job making Levitt physically resemble a young Willis, and Levitt captures many of Willis' signature personality traits to really enhance the believability of the movie. Levitt (and Willis) must have had a lot of fun with this film.

So the story really takes flight when Willis himself is sent back in time to meet the end of Levitt the assassin's suped-up shotgun. What ensues is an action packed story that's easy to follow (for a time travel movie) and fun to watch. I was completely entertained from start to finish.

A really good movie leaves you asking more about the characters and the world long after you have finished watching it. Such is the case of this film Looper. I loved it, and I wanted to know more about it. I wanted to know why they used the weapons they used, and how they dressed because it all came together so well in the final product. There are futuristic looking cars but there are also current era cars that seem to be retro-fitted with solar panels or tubes and hoses that come out of the exhaust and appear to limit emissions. All this comes together to make a futuristic society that feels real and believable. The world that is created is fresh and original, and yet very real and contemporary.
Joseph Gordon is an amazing actor and truly transforms himself into a younger Bruce Willis. Bruce does a fine job of being his usual badass self, and Emily Blunt is believable and not the typical damsel in distress.

It is so hard to find good Sci Fi lately. But this movie gets it right. Looper never tries to go over the top with its Sci Fi elements, or never makes you feel like they are making it up as they go. Personally, I feel like some movies can do that from time to time in this genre.

I knew nothing of this going in, which made it even better. If you too know nothing of it but love Blade Runner, Inception and other mind-benders, then stop reading these reviews and enjoy the many surprises awaiting you in Looper.

Without spoiling anything, I'll just say I love a great time travel story, as it opens so many avenues of plot and thought, and this one avoids many of the usual cliches. Rian Johnson wrote a sweet, tight script and directed it to near perfection, getting fine performances from everyone and probably Levitt's best turn to date. The score is subtle but tense and fitting, the costumes likewise, and the sets and especially street shots are state of the art, very believably dystopian.

What makes it all work are the concepts, some of which I've never encountered, and I've seen almost every time travel flick ever made; it's a genre I love. One thing the careful watcher will see over and over here are lens flares, which somehow fit in much better than usual (except in the work of Ridley Scott, the original flare-master). I don't think I've ever seen so many flares in one film, but Johnson always sets them up as part of the shot composition and it really works. This film looks great in general, in fact.

The blu-ray helps that along with a perfect transfer and excellent sound. There's almost an hour of extras, including a few nice docs about the making of and a fine little piece about the score with a few wonderful sonic tricks explained, like sampling the sounds of the ""gat"" gun and then playing them in pitch as a drum set. Very cool indeed.

All in all, Looper was one of the best cinematic surprises I've had in a long time, and clearly a sign that Johnson and Levitt are both headed for the top of their respective professions.

An intelligent, beautifully shot film highly recommended for all fans of sci-fi and thrillers, Looper is bound to be a cult classic.",1358121600,,1923,4.591836734693878

5646274,5,B00BLOKNVK,"Looper is a cleverly written and wildly entertaining sci-fi film that proves that there are still original ideas left in Hollywood. Rian Johnson has created a stylized and very detailed world within a thought-provoking film that is sure to stick with the audience after the credits role.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who continues to prove that he is one of the industry's most valuable new actors, is absolutely great as Joe, a ""Looper"" who eliminates targets sent to him from 30 years in the future. Problems arise, however, when Joe's older self, played by Bruce Willis, is sent into the past for execution, only to escape and attempt to change the future he's come from. The first half of the movie sets this climax up very well, while the second introduces us to Cid, played by newcomer Pierece Gagnon, as well as his mother Sara played by the always great Emily Blunt. I have to give a lot of credit to Gagnon, who gives a very memorable performance and piqued my interest in any future roles he lands.

Now, be warned that since there is time travel involved, the movie does contain potential plot holes if you dwell on events and their consequences too much. However, Johnson has created such a fantastic vision of the future, as well as terrific character interaction between JGL and Willis, that the holes don't appear unless well after the initial viewing. Because I was more enthralled with where the story was going and the brilliant storytelling from Johnson, I'm more than willing to overlook any inconsistencies I noticed.",1358035200,2,1532,4.843511450381679

5646294,4,B00BLOKNVK,"Every once in a while, Hollywood gives us a breath of fresh air. A well written, well directed, and well acted picture, that keeps us in suspense, while thoroughly entertaining us. That is exactly what we get in the recent bluray release of Looper. While 2012 saw its fair share of good films, Looper was no exception, and should go down as one of the years best. The story is engaging and interesting, and is the best time travel movies I have seen since 12 Monkeys. I did not find this film confusing, yet the writing remained complex enough to add a suspenseful ending that gave me a big ""WOW"" when the credits rolled. Both Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt were perfect in their roles as the lead characters. However, I thought Joseph Gordon-Levitt stole the show, with arguably one of his best performances to date. Rian Johnson who wrote and directed this film, shined on both ends. The action scenes were fun, the shooting scenes were realistic, and the Kansas farm backdrop added a beautiful palette of colors that looked good on bluray.

5646295,4,B00BLOKNVK,"This film was OK, but the story and acting left me a little cold. Given the Time Travel premise, IMHO, much more could have been made of this story.
The film is displayed Widescreen, and does not fill a 16x9 ratio TV, leaving black bars across the top and bottom.
The production values were good, but some of the futuristic weapons, cars and buildings could have been better.
Bruce Willis' acting was fine. The little boy, Cid had acting positively off the scale. Emily Blunt was OK.
I'm sure Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a fine actor, but I failed to care anything about his character in this film.
The synthesized film music is nothing remarkable, it's very mediocre.
The ending leaves you wondering what future effects all the changes to the timeline will cause. That sort of leaves you hanging.
I am a big fan of Fringe, a TV program of a similar genre that is cleverly written with excellent character development.
I had difficulty connecting with the characters in Looper. The little boy, Cid, was the only character that I really ended up caring anything about.

5646305,3,B00BLOKNVK,"When you watch this film, Bruce Willis will urge his younger self (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) to forget about ""space-time continuum"" stuff. This, of course, is a statement aimed at the audience, who are likely to ask questions about how time travel works according to the ""Looper"" universe.

So out of respect for this review, I will try not to poke holes at the time travel rules. But there are way too many questions to ask, especially when it comes to the logic of certain characters.

SPOILERS AHEAD! Do not read if you haven't seen!

1. Abe, the mob boss from the future who was sent back from the future to run the present-day mob, goes out of his way to explain to Young Joe (read: the audience) that it is dangerous to have someone from the future running around in the past/present. If that's true, why is Abe there? Does his younger self in the year 2044 know about him being there?

2. Why would the mob mandate that loopers in the present day kill their own future selves? It's extremely risky to assume that anyone would be okay with doing such a thing. It's already risky enough that they hire junkies, some of them with telekinetic powers, to do their dirty work. Are they trying to test the loopers' loyalty? Are they just being sadistic? It would seem more logical to send the future retired loopers to other looper assassins, and therefore keep them in the dark about their ultimate fate. This would make them much more obedient too.

3. So we learn early on in the film that whatever happens to people in the present will carry the effects to people in the future, including body mutilation and death. And this happens no matter what timeline the future people are living in. So why did the mob in the present find it necessary to cut off Young Seth's body parts in order to lure Old Seth just so they can fatally shoot Old Seth before eventually killing Young Seth? Why didn't they just shoot Young Seth in the head? They would have literally killed two birds (or, men) with one stone (or, bullet) without so much blood and carnage. And as we clearly see at the end of the film, if you kill someone in the present, including yourself, their future selves will cleanly disappear, even if their future selves are residing in the present. My only guess is that the mob wanted to be extremely sadistic and dole out the worst punishment possible to anyone who lets someone from the future run loose, especially if it's themselves. And speaking of killing your future self...

4. How does Sara know about loopers? Young Joe seems surprised that she knows, and he asks her about it. But she never answers.

5. What exactly does Young Joe accomplish by killing himself at the end? Old Joe tells Young Joe in the diner that the Rainmaker ""saw his mom get shot."" Now of course, that was somewhere during the original timeline where Old Joe does not survive his execution. But what that means is that the rainmaker apparently rose to power even without any interaction from Old or Young Joe. Why didn't he at least try to kill Old Joe? Old Joe wouldn't be able to retaliate without seriously hurting himself. And even if Old Joe succeeded in killing Sara so that he could get to Cid, it would have given Young Joe all the time he needed to kill Old Joe and try to find Cid. He could then use his excessive amount of silver and gold to raise Cid in a positive environment. After all, Cid likes Young Joe, and he's a smart kid, so Cid would be a low-maintenance child to care for. And if he succeeded in protecting Sara, then his job would be even easier with the two-parent household, AND his enormous sum of money. Not to mention the fact that Old Joe killed the rest of the mob in the present day, so they're safe from their enemies.

If Young Joe was serious about killing Old Joe, he should have done it when Old Joe pulled up in front of him and told him to go ""live your life,"" instead of shooting randomly at the truck that Old Joe was driving when he clearly could have hit him.",1357948800,5,3989,4.439890710382514

While the concept was interesting, it didn't play true through the end of the movie to this concept -- even the end felt hurried and weird....I didn't feel that attached to the characters at the end nor really care about the result because it was all over the place.

There really is not a need to lace a movie with excessive profanity like this one did -- I understand the use of profanity may be needed to establish a character, but not EVERYONE has to use it ALL the time like this movie did.

Also, unnecessary nudity -- this movie had the obligatory strip joint scene, but stuck in a couple of nude shots -- all this did, along with the profanity, was make it an R rated movie.",1357948800,,859,4.3625

5646311,3,B00BLOKNVK,"Looper is a movie that involves the idea of time travel. Time travel movies are either fun,exciting, or cheesy. This one is none of those. It's more suspense and drama with an unsatisfying ending. In the story Loopers act as executioners that kill people sent to the past from the future for whatever reason. The problem is that even the ""loopers"" fate is tied to them one day having to kill themselves off to tie loose ends. When Joe meets his future self ""Bruce Willis"" he escapes him and that's when the movie starts. Joe's future self is trying to kill a head boss to avoid the occurrences that take place in the future because of him. He goes to the past to find the ""Rain Maker"" and kill him as a child before he can become an adult and cause the chaos he brings. Sarah Conner the Rain Makers mother is a farmer and has no plans to let her son John Conner be killed by someone from the future. So she and Joe from the past plan out their moves to protect John Conner from the Terminator... I mean Bruce Willis who is going around killing people named Sarah Conner, I mean killing children that might be the rainmaker.

Looper has its moments of action but in between is a lot of drama that takes the story in a different direction. The films ending is let down because it makes everything that happened in the 1hr30 minutes or so of this film irrelevant and that really makes you feel cheated.",1357948800,3,1399,4.3396946564885495

I'm a huge SciFi fan, and I watch plenty of gory shows and movies, but this was ridiculous. It was boring and disturbing all at the same time. The storyline was illogical and insulted the intelligence of the viewer. There were major concepts that were treated in a ""just pretend we explained this part to you"" kind of way. It is a SciFi movie that didn't bother to put the effort into fleshing out the actual SciFi part of the plot. The second half of the movie was unexpected and came out of nowhere....very disjointed.  Small children were shot....which is never o.k. If this is fits the definition of entertainment, then we are a deprived society. This movie stayed with you for a while...not in a thought-provoking way, but rather more like a lingering disgusting scent that you can't get out of your clothing.  I will watch anything and everything (other than supernatural movies or those in which children are abused or killed), and this movie was trash. Don't watch it.

""Looper"" is a well-acted study of what it is to be human - growth, change, fear, love, greed, guilt, sacrifice and how we justify our actions. The performances make the film, the story however, has been cobbled together from a hundred other movies you've seen before. The special effects and production design for a story set decades in the future are just okay - so don't expect much and you won't be disappointed.

It's entertaining, and worth the purchase - and you'll only need to make space for one BluRay because there is not going to be a ""Looper 2"".  Loop closed.",1357862400,,828,4.619047619047619
5646340,4,B00BLOKNVK,"""Time travel has not yet been invented but 30 years from now, it will have been."" Thus begins the movie LOOPER, a science fiction action film that takes on time travel in a different way than most. The movie starts just a few years from now and people from the future have become involved in the present. With no way for future gangsters to dispose of people they send them back in time to be killed and disposed of. The people in our time who do this job are known as loopers.

Loopers wait at a designated area and time. When the intended shows up, they shoot them, wrap them up and then take the body to a burning disposal unit. They are paid well to do the job and down the line must eventually kill their own future self with a higher paid out at that time.

Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is one of the best loopers. He follows instructions and never looks back, making plans to one day travel to France when he retires. His friend Seth (Paul Dano) isn't quite as well groomed for the job. Seth shows up at Joe's house one night on the run. It turns out that his latest victim was his future self and he let him escape. Now the gatmen (those armed with revolvers instead of the blunderbuss that Loopers use) are tracking him down to eliminate both him and his future self.

Joe gives them an assist rather than find himself on the bad end of a bullet and continues on his way. The victims keep coming back but then Joe finds himself in the same shoes as Seth. The future Joe (Bruce Willis) is now in his sites but he hesitates. That's all it takes for future Joe to make an escape and leave current Joe on the run for his life. Trying to set things straight by killing future Joe won't be easy since your current strategy is all past history to him.

Current and future Joes meet at a diner they both love to get things straight. For current Joe to survive he must kill his future self. But future Joe lets him know that things aren't what they seem. Not only will his life change for the better but someone close to him will die if he doesn't change the past. On top of that a crime boss in the future is having all the loopers disposed of from the future so he will stand unopposed. Only finding this man in the past and killing him will set things in the future right.

Both are bound and determined to get their own way. Future Joe wants to save the world and his true love. Current Joe doesn't care, he just wants to survive. But as the film progresses both men learn something about the world and about themselves.

As the gatmen try to track them both down they take two divergent paths to try and affect things. Future Joe is searching for the child who will become the future criminal mastermind. When he does he will kill him. But a part of the map he made ended in the hands of current Joe who sets out to protect the child and at the same time finish his looper contract.

The map leads him to a remote farmhouse where he finds Sara (Emily Blunt) and her son Cid (Pierce Gagnon). Could this be the threat to the world of the future? Joe doesn't know but he does know that his future self will eventually end up here with the intent to kill. And the only one Joe wants to see dead is his future self.

Don't let it fool you this isn't as complicated as it might seem. What it is is a dynamite sci-fi thriller that keeps you guessing from the start and doesn't let go until almost the last minute of the film. There are no easy answers here just as there are none in life. The story that seems simple yet becomes more complex with each passing minute is one that will hold your interest and never let go.

The acting here is amazing. Gordon-Levitt has the mannerisms of Willis down pat. He's become an actor that is bound for more amazing roles and performances and this one just adds to his list. Willis could perform this role without breaking a sweat and he does a great job here. Blunt is good as always, giving those subtle nuances a twist to make her character deeper than one would expect.

Some would say that this is nothing more than a TERMINATOR rehash without robots but they would be wrong. There is more going on with these characters than in that film. There is a deeper meaning to the lives being lived and changed here. And by the end of the film there will perhaps be just a touch of humanity worth saving.",1357776000,,4336,4.238498789346247

His role in 500 Days of Summer was outstanding, and there's just enough of that sensitivity in this one.

It starts slowly and I found I was struggling to concentrate. However, by halfway through the pace had picked up and then was a thrilling ride to the end. Good special effects, clever concept using time-travel and very good acting.

One key issue for me was I didn't believe Old Joe and Young Joe were the same person, just 30 years different in age. I think the director should have aged Gordon-Levitt so he could play both the old and young Joe. Would have made it a little crazier too, seeing two similar looking dudes shooting it out.

Liked the idea of Emily Blunt's young son and the power he possessed.

5646346,5,B00BLOKNVK,"""Looper"" is a mind-bending, time-traveling thriller written and directed by Rian Johnson. In the near future, 2044, Kansas, USA, civilization is plagued by social decay. Cities are ruled by criminal syndicates, and life tends to be socially deterministic. Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a young man who makes a living working for local crime boss Abe (Jeff Daniels) as a ""looper"". Time travel hasn't' been invented yet, but it will be 30 years hence, and it will be outlawed. Organized crime uses time machines to send people whom they want killed back in time. The loopers kill them and collect a payment. One day, Joe's thirty-years-older self (Bruce Willis) is sent through the time machine. But Old Joe has no intention of being murdered. He has other plans. And that's bad news for Young Joe.

Other than economic collapse and a few new technologies, the world of ""Looper"" is recognizable.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt is not recognizable, however. He's wearing prosthetic makeup, ostensibly to make him resemble his older self in the form of Bruce Willis. He doesn't look the least bit like Bruce Willis, but that's okay. The makeup was not for naught. At first I thought that Johnson had cast an unknown actor in the lead. His lack of references made Joe seem more real and his predicament more immediate. ""Looper""'s success depends heavily on its ability to create a world that seems very plausible, almost mundane. Joe kills people in a corn field. He likes to dress like 20th century movie icons. He wants to retire to France. And he doesn't look like Joseph Gordon-Levitt.

Time-warping, existentially confusing movies are not new, but ""Looper"" is especially clever and effective. It's character-driven sci-fi, reminiscent of 1970s science fiction films in that sense but more aggressive. Introverted enough to be interesting. Violent enough to be exciting. People act like people would actually act. At its most basic, this is a chase movie. Old Joe must save Young Joe to survive. Young Joe must kill Old Joe to survive. They are at cross-purposes. Bruce Willis is so much more memorable in his little character roles than he is in action movies, and here he gets to do both. Paul Dano, as Joe's best friend, and Emily Blunt make memorable contributions as well. You'll solve the mystery that Old Joe is pursuing before he does, but ""Looper"" is great fun.",1357776000,,2360,4.954545454545454

They cheesed up what was an interesting story line with the usual degrading of women, strip clubs, some woman straddling a guy in her panties while topless, etc.  Usually they only throw that stuff in when the rest of the movie is crap, but it was backwards with this one...the rest of the movie was pretty good and they threw that in and knocked it down a notch in credibility. It deserved better than that because the story line was pretty interesting.  On top of that it went way over the top with glorifying gun violence.
But I didn't find it hard to follow at all and the ending made sense to me so I wasn't sure where all that was coming from with other people when watching it. It was however very slow at times and they easily could have shaved 20 minutes at least off of it.

5646381,1,B00BLOKNVK,"I'm a geek, true, but let me attempt to put myself on the continuum.  I think I can name 3-5 people from star trek, and couldn't name that many from Star Wars.  Honestly I don't give a big flip about either of them, but would gladly watch them again and again on basic cable despite their insane number of commercial breaks.  I enjoy a good sci-fi no matter how low budget, from Godzilla to Moon - to me it's all about a good story.

I regularly enjoy a good sci-fi movie and had high hopes for Looper.  Sadly it was just terrible.  There are more plot holes in this movie than swiss cheese.

Without giving away some spoilers, Looper suffers from a truckload of problems.  It attempts to be part thriller, part sci-fi, and succeeds only at being part piece of crap.  When they trot out the strippers you know the movie is grasping at straws.  With extremely few exceptions strippers are the halmark of the director knowing they're running low on ideas to keep butts in seats.  The movie attempts to throw so much at the viewer only to leave them all open as loose ends.  For instance he's heavily addicted to drugs, but his recovery is some sweating, a good puke, and then he's good to go.  No convulsions or montage of recovery here.

Story is just not important here.  And the rare instance it is, they screw it up.  Every twist is forecast, every side story left underdeveloped, and every character left shallow and unmemorable.

And then there's the coup de grace.  One of the main characters chops at a stump with an axe. All. Movie. Long.  They were clearly out of ideas at this point and just couldn't afford some extra CGI to wrap things up nicely.

I was surprised that the premise of the film made a certain amount of sense to me and easily followed after the first ten minutes.  It is science fiction and concerns time travel backward in time.  The show is built on hit men who have completed their contract and given 30 years to live until they are eliminated.  Bruce Willis really gives the movie substance with his flair for action films and the little boy in the film does a very credible job.  All actors did a good job.

5646385,5,B00BLOKNVK,"...are there so many negative reviews on such a stellar movie?  I've seen lesser films receive better treatment.  Also, what's with the insanely positive reviews and *only* 4 stars?  If you are that sold on a movie, then just give the thing a 5.  I guarantee you won't lose any sleep over it.  Trust me on this.

Anyhow, Prometheus this is not.  It's one of the rare sci-fi gems that stand out as being both coherent and something you can identify with; it runs the gamut of human emotion and nature while still presenting us with a collage of fictional events that, when all put together, seem believable.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt delivers an impeccable showing as a young Joe, realistically depicting the simultaneously gritty and prosaic life of a Mafia hitman in the future, and the consequences that such a profession entails, namely when he meets his future self (Bruce Willis).  Of particular note is Pierce Gagnon, who manages to deliver in a stirring and somewhat unnerving role as Cid, a child with extraordinary telekinetic power.  It is this performance that will cement Gagnon's place in a line of up-and-coming child actors.

Overall, a seemingly perfect blend of gunplay, thematic elements, and great acting comes together to make this feature a staple in any movie connoisseur's collection.",1357689600,,1303,4.986111111111111

5646389,2,B00BLOKNVK,"Sick & Stupid Score: 5/8*

This picture lost itself after about 30 minutes.  Perhaps there is no better confirmation of the confused nature of time travel movies than an admission by the screenwriters that the concept is simply too screwy to explain.  That is what we get at least twice during this movie: scenes between various characters trying to puzzle out how time travel works, especially when you are supposed to kill your future self.  Never mind, the scriptwriters tell us.  Don't try to diagram it out.  We were totally stoned when we wrote the story, anyway.

What is this story?  It is bits and pieces from science fiction and horror movie ideas of the last 30 years or more:  a little bit of Matrix and Dark City (mostly costumes), a little bit of Star Wars (jet-powered motorcycles), how about some Damien (The Omen) or a blood-soaked little boy version of Carrie?  Poltergeist anyone?  Futuristic psychedelic drugs?  Ugh.  Not to mention the 50 other time travel movies out there that make no sense.  Get an original idea, please.

So the present is the 2040s--or maybe it is the past.  And the future is the 2070s--or maybe it is the present.  People from the future (present?) are being sent back to the present (past?) for execution.  That works for about 30 minutes, if you are adjusting the surround sound by moving furniture around your living room and not paying any attention to the movie.  After that, with the totally cool idea of ""loopers"" totally exhausted, the movie wanders around hopelessly, desperately searching for a way to fill out another 60 minutes of reel time, no pun intended.

Note to Bruce Willis fans:  Even though he is given top billing, he is actually in a supporting role.

* The Sick & Stupid Score ranks movies from zero to ten in each category. For example, a Sick & Stupid Score of 5/5 indicates the movie is about average Sick and about average Stupid.

At some point there is talk about a closed loop. Without research I found it a little unclear as to the original cause of it all, it bugged me for a little.
There are a few scenes in the movie that seemed would be of great importance later, but were not. I'd rather have had more explanation of the time period, how things came to be, and more development on the secondary important characters.

5646399,3,B00BLOKNVK,"Well even from the ads you know there is a paradox.  Do you kill your future self or not?  The movie centers around a mostly wealthy or content society with an element of mafia style enforcement to prevent future people coming back and changing things.  The assassins that deal with them know when and where they will appear and when they arrive they are tied and head bagged to prevent identity before execution.  The flaw in the system is sometimes an assassin lets their future self go.  The precedent for that happening is to make the future self wish they were dead as fingers, and other things start to disappear on them.  Certainly worth a rental if you like SciFi or Action movies.

First of all, I must admit that I have been a fan of Bruce Willis for a long time.  We're about the same age; his use of firearms (e.g. ""Tears of the Sun"" others) are credible, and; most of his movies have a positive theme of good combating evil.

But I am surprised that he took a role and allowed the blatant child exploitation that is in the movie ""Looper.""

The movie had great action, great special effects, and great acting.  The greatest and most notable acting was actually done by the child that developed into a primary antagonist in the movie.

Killing a small child?  A small child depicted as Evil?  SUBSTANTIAL Blood splattering on the small child? If we as a nation continue to portray our children in evil roles, then evil is what they only will know, and evil is what they will become.

If it was not for the aforementioned on the abuse of children this movie would have obtained 5 Stars.

5646414,4,B00BLOKNVK,"The movie ""Looper"" is a unique and imaginative film at a time when Hollywood often seems content to churn out formulaic productions loaded with special effects, sophomoric characters, and predictable plots. This movie, to its credit, has a plot you haven't seen before; and one where you won't, in all likelihood, predict the story's final outcome. For that alone, it is worth watching.
Many may find the film a little slow, but the pace is the result of the moral and ethical ideas being presented: good and evil, the use and misuse of time travel, age and youth and their connection in time, how present events profoundly affect the future, nature vs. nurture, and the importance of a mother's love. The movie also paints a perhaps all too realistic view of the decadent future that may await us.
The acting is first-rate, and a lot of hard work went into the making of the film. For this, I want to say thank you to the director, cast, and crew.
I also want to note the superlative work Emily Blunt brought to her role. As in her other films, in ""Looper,"" Ms. Blunt gives us a class in what really fine acting is. Her performance has an honesty and depth which only comes from meticulous preparation and flawless execution. There isn't a moment in the film where you feel Ms. Blunt isn't completely the character she is portraying. Her skill and absolute commitment to her role make ""Looper"" a much better film than it would have been without her. She is, simply, one of our very best actors.
So, when you watch this film, enjoy the hard work and genuine effort the director, cast, and crew put into the production. I also hope you are entertained by the story.

The romance and bedroom scenes are well done; they leave you with just enough to use your imagination without offending anyone. Thats the mark of seasoned producer, and I really appreciate that. The cinematography is stunning. Acting, wardrobe, and props are very good. The CGI effects are to A-list standards, very good.

5646433,3,B00BLOKNVK,"I wish we could give half stars because this actually would have gotten 2.5 stars in my mind. I enjoyed the plot but this movie was better suited to a science fiction channel release, sans Willis. Bruce Willis was a supporting actor in this movie who did a mediocre job. The best acting came from the mother of the child on the farm, she consumed her role and made the latter part of the movie better in my eyes.
Ok, to the nitty gritty. I follow plot lines very well and of course we suspend belief in reality for a movie such as this. But, there are 2 failed plot issues in the story line. The first might be classified as a double flashback in the style of Momento. However the first flashback/time travel sequence in question is self annihilating and makes no logical sense as a viewer. We can make assumptions but in reality the sequence were the young looper meets Bruce Willis his old self takes a viewer on a time loop that actually has no closure. The first loop the younger Willis dies which would close all future possibility,  then they throw a couple flashback time travel loops that somehow replay this moment and redo the loop. Unfortunately this section allows no actual closure in the time loop.
The final climactic scene in the movie has the younger looper do something when all he had to do is resolve to himself in the present not to do it, simple as that. The writers of the movie try to explain this away through botched dialogue where Willis talks about possible realities and probabilities. This was failed because anything that happened to young loopers in the present automatically happened  to their older selves.
Neat concept, bad writing and execution for people who follow timelines and plots. Stop here if you haven't seen the movie, the main story isn't spoiled but a major gripe I have is shared.
One little spoiler that actually made me think really?... they tell us this whole time how looping and time travel works and then suspend it for the leading up to the climax. The whole presupposition of Bruce Willis coming back is that the girl who got him off drugs was killed, for this he wants to kill the main evil character as a child. His younger self is weened off drugs by another women. Regardless of how which way the plot line runs the writers really needed to make this work.

Aside from that the movie was ok but its more of a divorced guilt ridden father theme than a scifi. The movie bummed me out because it went all guilt trippy not far in. If you like movies that make you feel sad about the broken family then this movie is for you.

5646475,4,B00BLOKNVK,"I had little expectations walking into LOOPER - the ad campaign was pathetic - but by the time it finished, I was blown away.  This has been a great year for scifi & fantasy and LOOPER's a big reason why.  Mix in equal helpings of BLADE RUNNER, SCANNERS, and TIME COP (plus a little WITNESS for seasoning) and you get a styled, original film that never bores.  While we've seen everything featured in LOOPER before in other films, we've never quite seen it put together quite like this.

As written and directed by Rian Johnson, LOOPER never hesitates in it's far out plot - it's set in 2044 and the time travelers come from some 40 years later - so much so that the time travel gimmick becomes very believable (a very hard trick to pull off).  That's partly because there's plenty of other hardcore scifi gimmicks  - rayguns, flying cars, and psychic powers - also make appearances.  Despite all the chances for missteps, Johnson's direction is crisp and never chooses style before story, instead letting the action dictate the camera work.

The film's helped by a great cast - Bruce Willis is great of course, but so is Jeff Daniels as a mob boss, as is Joseph Gordon Levitt and Emily Blunt.  Very solid, very professional performances all the way around.  None of them get overwhelmed by a story that could have very easily turned into a farce.

Far out plot aside, this movie works quite well as a detective story.  It also plays on our expectations of what we want from our Hollywood stars.  The music, camera work, costumes are all top notch.  Makeup plays a big role, as Levitt wears a ""Bruce Willis"" nose that doesn't always work, but that about the worst thing I can say about this otherwise must see flick.

5646485,4,B00BLOKNVK,"I like the movie for its complicated plot and twists and time travel. I am also impressed with Emily Blunt's acting.

But I think the movie can do away with the scenario where Gordon does shoot covered Bruce dead and take the gold. This part doesn't make sense. Because if Gordon closes the loop in 2044, then the rainmaker's mom would not die from Bruce and the rainmaker would grow up not being the master criminal who terrorizes the planet, closes all the loops and kills Bruce's wife in 2074.  They would have to tell another scenario about how the Rainmaker had a bad past/path and became the Rainmaker. The story would work if someone else in 2074 also  tries to go back in time to kill the rainmaker and in turn hurts the mom.  This other killer contends with Bruce and Bruce eventually takes him out also and became in direct line to kill the mom instead and forces Gordon to eventually kill himself to save the mom.

Sometimes the violence was too much especially, it makes you crinch in light of recent real shootings. Some snippets showing gun availability, drug use, shooting an innocent kid and mass shooting with the rifle, all remind you the worst of  humanity today and possible future.  Too dark on that part.

Everything about it was awesome, the story (very different, I think), the acting (JGL - enough said!), just everything. I liked the interesting, yet complex nature of the whole time travel concept. I saw it in the theaters, and I told myself when it comes out on DVD, OWN IT! So I checked to find out the date it was to be released DVD, bought it, have watched 3 times so far.

So I was more than excited when I saw he was departing from his usual con-men and brooding characters and delving into the sci-fi realm, full of hitmen, telekinesis, and time travel. Johnson did not disappoint! This ties with ""Argo"" and ""Django Unchained"" for my favorite film of the year! Every actor -- and their performance -- is top-notch, but what takes precedence here (as it always should) is the story. Johnson writes and directs a story that is not just entertaining but full of meaning and moral quandaries. This film takes the theoretical question of ""If you traveled back in time to when Adolf Hitler was a little boy, and knowing what he would later do, would you kill him?"" Only, in this film, there's more sci-fi and twists that make the question not so black-and-white. One of the best sci-fi films I've seen in a LONG time ... with plenty of action, cool special effects, good writing, good acting and a great message.

It's a great yarn, and unlike many (most?) sci-fi movies, it leaves untouched the whole question of ""How?"" (we never learn how it works) focusing on ""Why?"" (why do people make the choices they do? what choices would we make in their situation?). The characters are quite credible and normal.

The dark setting of the criminal under world and the senseless killing makes one believe it is just another blood bath with a time travel twist. I found it to be a much more human story. It begs the question of how we confront ourselves in a world full of temptations. Some take the easy way out. Yet somehow a small boy teaches us in the end, what is most important in life!

5646531,1,B00BLOKNVK,"Just a few words about your humble reviewer, so you'll know my biases:  I'm an old guy (63), who thinks that among the greatest movies ever made are Richard Attenborough's 'Gandhi', Michael Mann's 'Last of the Mohicans', and Peter Jackson's 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy.  (You can see where this review is going.)

 Appearing in sixty some films, it's inevitable that Bruce Willis has had good and less-good roles.  His most memorable movies are 'Death Becomes Her', 'The Jackal', 'Mercury Rising', 'The Kid', 'The Sixth Sense', and 'RED'.

 'Looper' isn't memorable--at least in the positive sense.  I'm not going to give away the plot, if you're interested in watching the movie; but I do have thoughts about some of its characters.

 The movie's protagonist, Joe, is a sociopath.  He is a contract killer, who murders for money whoever is sent to him.  No second thoughts.  The highlights of his personal life--when not on the job--are drugs and a prostitute.  The most positive and popular review, above, calls that 'the good life'.

 All the characters that surround Joe are sociopaths.  He does a good turn for a fellow assassin, takes heat for it, and subsequently gives up his only friend to be murdered.

 The cartoonish gang, of which Joe is a part, comes after him, and the burden of the movie is comprised of the various gratuitous, bloody gun battles between them.

 Virtue is represented by the shot-gun toting Sara, a gorgeous, single-mother and Kansas farmer (!) whose young son has paranormal abilities.  As is every character but Joe, she's one dimensional, just sort of plopped out there among the people of the corn.

 Joe has two dimensions.  We know that he was noticed by the syndicate when he was younger and stole a watch from one of the front stores owned by a mob boss.  In a silent part of the movie, we learn that his older persona married an elegant Chinese woman who helped him clean up his drug habit. She was murdered.

 I watched the entire movie only because I paid $22 for the Blue Ray disk.  I came out of it wondering why, for two hours, I allowed myself vicariously to share Joe's dissolute, violent, and virtuously pointless life.",1357430400,11,2169,4.755376344086022
5646532,5,B00BLOKNVK,"I enjoyed the story, the acting, and all the guns. The time travel aspect was interesting too. I saw this in the theater and was impressed with it.

Aside from wizardry of facial features, this film has a great story, an interesting setting, and a nice blend of scifi with familiar modern setting elements.  Every year there are only a few films that must be seen; sometimes, there are a negative number of them.  2012 was good to the film industry, and this is one of those films that must be seen.

This movie is quite the opposite - there aren't any effects to speak of, but the acting is fantastic and the story is very engaging.  It won't make a ton of sense as you go, but at the end it all comes together in a very satisfying way.  I'd strongly recommend Looper.",1357430400,,403,4.0125

5646538,3,B00BLOKNVK,"The thing I enjoyed most about _Looper_ was watching Gordon-Levitt imitate a young Bruce Willis (whereas Willis just acted like himself). The idea behind the movie was interesting. In particular, the movie does a decent job investigating the generational gap within a single person -- how someone can change and suddenly be at odds with a prior (or future) version of himself. Beyond that, the audience is told not to worry too much about the time-travel details, but time travel is the scaffold on which the movie is built. The end of the movie is predictable, but it is also terribly flawed as it uses time travel to conveniently erase some aspects of a time line while leaving others strangely unchanged. Consequently, it looks like the writers just took the easy exit rather than coming up with something consistent or scrapping the whole project completely.

So the movie is at odds with itself. It is not a fast-paced popcorn-eating movie that keeps you at the edge of your seat. It tries to be more thought provoking, bringing up issues surrounding how people and their priorities change over time, and how life experiences shape people. Time travel is supposed to merely be a background context to be forgotten as these larger issues are asserted, but the flaws in this background are so noticeable that it is hard to forget them.

So I was disappointed by the slow, predictable, flawed movie, but I enjoyed the acting of Gordon-Levitt.",1357430400,,1444,4.865853658536586

It was a fun story that engaged my logical mind as I thought about whether I agreed with what they considered the consequences to be of changes to what happened in the time line.  The action keeps up enough to keep attention, and the two versions of the main character are unpleasant enough to make a viewer dislike them at first, and give them room to grow.  It was a nice character progression, and it's a fun movie worth a look.",1357430400,,455,4.267441860465116
5646543,3,B00BLOKNVK,"I wanted to enjoy this movie. The story, a man battling himself aged 30 years apart for the sake of the present versus that of the future, sounds compelling. However, it unfolds as if no one ever proofread the script. The gaps in both plot and logic are astounding. While I'm not one to look for cookie-cutter stories, the writers of Looper could've done well by watching any other movie about time travel. It would've helped avoid the pitfalls of confusing basic ""if/then logic"" with fantasy. Even Doctor Who does a better job at justifying why its explanations are at least marginally plausible. The weak back story about why looping is necessary and what bridges two characters at different times manages to contradict itself and lacks coherency in ways that are frustrating.

In addition to the nonsensical plot line, the pacing of the movie is unnecessarily slow. It gets boring. The action scenes are moderately well done, but are also often plagued by similar nonsensical occurrences, such as bodies and memories that change in the future character in real time as the past character makes different decisions. Issues such as these make the unfolding story seem silly, and distract from scenes that should be gripping, or at least exciting. While explosions, sex, or fights are often successfully used to detract from these problems in other movies, the caliber and number of action scenes in Looper are woefully insufficient to compensate for the content or pacing of the story. Overall, the movie isn't a complete failure, I would say it's not worth the money for renting. Leave it to a slow day on cable.",1357430400,3,1614,4.912087912087912

5646559,4,B00BLOKNVK,"I make it a point to avoid watching trailers for movies that I eventually will want to see.  This shifts my expectations from what I already ""know and have seen"" about the film, to the level of interest I have because of the talent behind the scenes.  Often, I discover movies simply by following the writer, director, actor, composer, etc. to see more of their work.  I came in expecting to see Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis in a science fiction/action/time travel film to kill a few hours.  I got SO much more than I was expecting!

It's not uncommon to see an actor portray different roles in a film, but it was very refreshing to see Levitt portray a young Bruce Willis - every eyebrow raise and smirk, all his mannerisms were there.  The concept of sending someone back in time to be erased is nothing new, but the idea of ""Loopers"" is that you can make a pretty good living off of it.  In fact, that very life is contracted - you agree to kill bad men and not ask questions, and in return you live your life as a wealthy man... until your loop is closed, and you are eventually sent back to terminate your own contract.  The knowledge that you'll be the one offing yourself at some point of time in the future, along with the daily ""business"", attracts a certain kind of person of questionable moral character.

And there it is - that's what surprised me.  The characters were well thought out, each realized with their own intentions and backstory equaling the other.  Outside of Willis and Levitt, I was surprised and entertained by the casting of the main ""villain"", and thoroughly enjoyed the roles that became more than players at the side of the stage.  I'll leave it at that, and ask that you ""go in blind"" as well.  It's a clever movie, with characters that are far more interesting than they should be.

5646566,5,B00BLOKNVK,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

There are so many words I can use to describe Looper: fantastic, compelling, exhilarating  exciting, phenomenal. It's hard to chose only one. When you get two of my favorite actors (Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt) in one movie I have every right to assume something will go wrong, but they pulled it off. It's been a while since we've seen such an original story in the action genre, but that's what makes Looper all the more special.

For the most part Looper is a pretty straightforward scifi action flick, if you pay attention. The writer's did a fantastic job at making sure everything was explained before, or after, something happened that way the audience didn't get confused. However, there was a small section towards the middle that made me kind of put the pieces together real quick, but it only took an instant to get up to speed.

I'm sure many have already explained the plot, but I'll give a brief summary. In short Joe Simmons of 2044 (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a Looper. In the future time travel was invented and made illegal, but that doesn't stop the major crime mobs from getting rid of people when they need to. That's where Joe comes in. For each assignment he has to be in the fields on the outskirts of the city by a specific time. Once someone pops up from the future he shoots them.

Now Joe isn't the only Looper, there's dozens of them. In the future the ""Rainmaker"" is trying to eliminate all ties to this organization ever existing and, eventually, every Looper will get sent their future self. Once they kill them they get some bonus money and then proceed to live their life for the next 30 years until they get sent back in time to get killed. If they let them get away? Well let's just say we don't want that happening. That's were Joe Simmons of 2074 (Bruce Willis) comes in. He's out for revenge and he wants to stop the Rainmaker before he has a chance to grow into the crime boss that he is in the future. The only problem is that in 2044 the Rainmaker is a kid and there's three children that were born on the same day in the same hospital as him.

Now, for me, one of the main themes in this film was testing one's morality. What would you do to get exactly what you want? Is there a limit to what you would do for happiness? Could you kill a kid just to get the perfect future? This is something the viewer constantly sees Old Joe struggle with throughout the movie and it's really quite moving. It makes you step back for a moment and think what would you do if you were in that situation?

If I haven't made it clear already I thought the story was fantastic. It was well paced and full of rich and enjoyable characters. There were a few minor characters  like Kid Blue that felt pretty unimportant to me, but overall these characters are fantastic. Then you have the fantastic writing that kept you on the edge of your seat the entire time. When I say that it isn't an exaggeration. I've seen a lot of movies that have suffered from scenes that seem to drag on, but Looper doesn't have that problem.

Lastly, the acting in this movie is phenomenal. We all know Bruce Willis can act his ass off when he gets the proper script and Joseph Gordon-Levitt is quickly putting himself in that same category. These two men are a joy to watch solo, but put them in a film together and they completely dominate. It was insane. Match that with the strong supporting cast of Emily Blunt, Jeff Daniels, Paul Dano, and Pierce Gagnon and you have an amazing, well rounded, cast.

Overall Score: 9.5/10 - How I wish I would've seen this when it was in the theaters. I loved it sitting on my living room couch, but it had to have been 1000x better in the cinema. Either way Looper is fantastic. When a movie is filled with an amazing story, a great cast, and great acting it's hard not to recommend. This is definitely a film you should check out.",1357344000,,3931,4.417127071823204

Much of the action happened so fast that there wasn't enough time to make the plot fit to the action. The first half of the film was interesting and neat the second half felt like the plot was abandoned to make room for action sequences and child murder.

*Spoiler Alert*
The end of the movie happens abruptly, and, stupidly. JGL kills himself to make sure his loop cannot kill the boy and complete the cycle. There is really no reason why he couldn't have waited and explained to Willis why he cannot kill the boy. The way the timeline works, if JGL killed himself at any point after Willis attempted to kill the child Willis' actions would have ceased to exist and the child would never have died.",1357344000,3,880,4.46583850931677

5646595,3,B00BLOKNVK,"The problem with time-travel movies is that no matter what happens, the plot holes are always there. They just don't work all that well. And because there is no actual proof that it can be done, this leaves alot of room for creative freedom. Looper takes place in the year 2044 where they don't quite have flying cars yet, but they're on the way. Joe (young Joe) is a Looper, kind of like a hired gun. Time travel has been invented(we never find out how) but it is illegal and apparently only the mob is capable of it. They hire these Loopers to ""take care of"" people that they send back from 30 years into the future. These Loopers make a lot of money (silver and gold) doing this gig but sometimes, they are forced to ""close the loop"". That pretty much entails killing off their future selves after they get sent back to the past. Yep, plot holes commence... So the drama here starts when Joe, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, has to kill his future Joe, played by Bruce Willis. He hesitates, action and chaos ensues. If the Looper can't close the loop, the mob gets pretty pissed off, and they have severe means of fixing this problem.

Without spoiling anything, I'd say that this ranks as one of the better time-travel films out there, but it's pretty predictable and makes your head hurt from thinking about all the scenarios that can play out from all the time travel issues. JGL plays young Joe very convincingly and mimicks Willis' mannerisms quite well. Freakishly well in some scenes. He prevents this film from being boring or tired. Bruce Willis is, well, Bruce Willis. He pretty much plays the same role in every movie he's in so no difference here. Emily Blunt does a fine job, sans British accent as a single mom raising an interesting boy, who certainly can create further holes in this movie.

The movie looks wonderful in Blu-ray and the soundtrack is enjoyable as well.
Looper is a decent film, but a frustrating one. Maybe I am thinking too much into it, but there are so many possibilities when it comes to time travel, so many theories out there, that I can't help but nitpick when something sounds or looks off. The ending just offered more questions, and nothing conclusive really happened. Still, it's worth a look.",1357257600,2,2240,4.5975

This review is not about the movie. It's about the ""product"" I was sold. After registering for my THIRD studio website account (in 3 movies), I was led to a page on Sony's site where I could, in theory, download the digital copy. Upon clicking, the download button, I got a pop up saying that I had to download the Download Manager (really?!) before I could download the movie. Just click the Install button...only there was no install button. I updated Silverlight as prompted, thinking that was the problem. Nope. Tried it on other browsers. Nope, still no Install button. Finally, I just download it from Flixster on my iPad, but apparently I won't ever be watching the movie on my PC.

How does looping work? It just does. Why are some people telekinetic? They just are. Joseph Gordon-Levitt turns in another good performance, but his attempts to mimic Bruce Willis (Gordon-Levitt plays the younger version of the Williz character) are comical at times. There are moments, however, when his mimicry is dead on, so the viewer can overlook the bad bits. The biggest problem with Gordon-Levitt's performance is mot related to his acting. Rather, his eyes are off putting, because they are so steely blue (a la Willis) and unnatural that they come across as creepy.

5646618,1,B00BLOKNVK,"This film is so awful one hardly knows where to start.

The central premise - that criminal gangs from the future send their gangland enemies 30 years back in time to be executed by time-traveling assassins - is just beyond stupid. Huh?  Well, apparently, in the future, it's impossible to dispose of murdered bodies, so it's easier to send your live victims back in time to be killed, after you tie them up, put hoods over their heads and wrap them in bars of silver in order to pay the time-traveling assassins.  Uh...yeah, that makes sense.

Then add to that a Terminator rip-off subplot where one of the assassins goes back in time to kill a child who has killed his wife 30 years in the future.

The screenplay is so bad and the directing so inept that the actors seem to just wander around in a stupor, asking, ""What am I supposed to be doing here?""

The cinematography is murky.  The pacing is lethargic.  The editing is beyond incompetent.  Every single character, including the little kids, are so one-dimensional and irritating that I couldn't wait for them to kill each other, but they couldn't even manage to do that.

It's lousy science fiction.  It's lousy action.  It's lousy film noir.

5646620,5,B00BLOKNVK,"Looper is a Science Fiction gem. Writer/Director Rian Jonson's personal passion project possesses one of the rarest traits in today's film industry, originality (apologies for all the p's). I really liked Looper a lot when I first saw it in the theater, and I loved it the second time at home. I loved it because it drew me in. Not only the story itself, or the plethora of rich characters, but also the dark dystopian future world that Johnson created. I totally bought into everything I saw, and it made the story feel more personal to me.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt is one of my favorite young actors working. He brings a charisma, and a maturity to the screen every time. He's uniquely great here because of the Bruce Willis impression he is trying to pull off, meanwhile still adding a personal touch to his younger version of the character that he and Bruce share. Not only are they great, but also the supporting cast which consists of Jeff Daniels, Paul Dano, Emily Blunt, Noah Segan and great kid named Pierce Gagnon who does one of the most intense creepy looks. He's truly a good find for the role he plays.

I will avoid any sort of plot description, because one of the greatest parts of the film is discovering everything as the plot unfolds. What I will say that the film is complex without being complicated. It's nice to be able to think and analyze while watching a modern Sci-Fi flick. That's not as common as it used to be. As for the Blu-ray treatment, it's top notch.

The disc is practically reference material. The picture quality is sublime. Detail is sharp, and colors are rich. The audio definitely is, it's sonic. The sound design is sure to rumble some home theaters. As for the extras, they are pretty good as well. I am a sucker for commentaries, especially on personal projects like this. Johnson delivers a fascinating commentary during both the film and the deleted/extended scenes.

The featurettes are fairly short, which is the biggest drawback, but there should be enough here to satisfy most who even bother to venture into the special features section of the disc. I do not have much else to say about this film, because my gushing over how great the film is would probably grow tiresome, but I can't recommend it enough. Quite simply, Looper is an original time-travel thriller with heart. Must Own.",1357171200,,2334,4.685365853658537
5646621,5,B00BLOKNVK,"This movie similar to Matrix and 13th floor.  If you like those, you'll enjoy this one as well... in addition to Bruce in action.  Plenty of action and great story.",1357171200,,164,4.433333333333334
5646622,2,B00BLOKNVK,"I thought this movie was going to suck when I saw the trailer but I gave it a chance and it proved me right. Let me start off by asking what the hell happened to Joseph Gordon-Levitt? The make-up looks awful, was this really necessary? Is he just too young looking for the role, you had do that to him? Anyway, JGL's make-up is the least of this film's problems. First off the whole plot is just ridiculous. Time travel has been invented...but it's been outlawed. Naturally, organized-crime gets their hands on it and since disposing of dead bodies is much more difficult in 2077 then it is in 2044 they must use the time machine to dispose of bodies in the past. What? So they can't get rid of bodies but getting a time machine is a piece of cake? What's worse is the time machine itself, some rusting piece of crap in a dilapidated warehouse? That's the time machine? How did they get it? The movie doesn't even try to explain how it works, Bruce Willis just talks about making diagrams with straws instead. You can tell the writer Rian Anderson didn't even think it through whatsoever. The best part are the cars in the movie, in particular Joe's car. It's 2044 and we're supposed to believe that Joe's line of work pays well yet he's driving a 1994 Mazda Miata? Really? I've never seen lazier film making, they make a little effort to create futuristic vehicles sure but those are even worse. Just about everything you see is straight out of the nineties. They do such a poor job of convincing us that we are in the future, it's just so laughable. So let's get to the story itself. Why do the guys from the future have to die? I would think sending them to the past would be good enough, we never see any FBI or law enforcement being sent to the past in their own machines. Who cares? Who are they hiding them from? Why do they have to kill themselves? It's just stupid, we never see this ""Rain Maker"" as an adult in the future and as a kid he's able to move things that aren't even metal when others can only move small metal objects. What? The whole TK thing seems just tacked on for no reason. It's completely meaningless since we never see Sid as an adult anyway. So the older Joe comes back to try to kill Sid so he isn't sent back and his wife isn't shot. Well wouldn't he be sent back to the past regardless of Sid coming to power? Weren't they closing loops before he showed up? The action is terrible, the acting is lame and the plot is just so half-baked that this movie just doesn't work. If you have seen ""In Time"" with Justin Timberlake then this will seem familiar as a corny take on a futuristic thriller. Joseph, Bruce and Emily you are all above this crap.",1357171200,3,2677,4.324055666003976
5646623,1,B00BLOKNVK,"This is the worst time travel movie ever. And there have been a lot of bad time travel movies. From about 5 minutes in until the very last scene this movie is loaded with irreconcilable paradoxes that the writers/director selectively do or don't recognize based on how it moves the characters closer to the predetermined ""cool"" or ""freaky"" outcome that they had in mind. I wish I could go back in time and warn my past self not to see it.",1357171200,3,438,4.419753086419753
5646624,4,B00BLOKNVK,JGL is great as a young Willis. Plot has some really good twists/turns. Don't skip ahead or you'll regret it.,1357171200,,109,4.5
5646625,5,B00BLOKNVK,"Joseph Gordon-Levitt and writer/director Rian Johnson proved to be the perfect pair with 2005's BRICK.  They're back together again in LOOPER, the story of a hitman who kills people sent back in time from the future.  Joe's got a good life: drugs, babes, money.  Of course, this lifestyle comes with a catch: one day, the person you're supposed to kill turns out to be your future self.  This means you get to live out your remaining years (roughly 30) doing whatever you so desire.  Of course, in Joe's case, things don't go according to plan; his future self escapes, on a mission to prevent the death of his wife, and now both Joes find themselves being pursued by ruthless killers.

LOOPER is stunning.  Visually, it's a treat; the effects are impressive, the cinematography astounding.  The action is slick and the dialogue is quick and intelligent, just what we'd expect from a Rian Johnson script.  Perhaps the biggest surprise here (well, for non-Johnson fans, at least) is the caliber of acting.  The supporting cast is impressive: Emily Blunt, Noah Segan, Garrett Dillahunt, and child actor Pierce Gagnon all shine, while Jeff Daniels and Paul Dano are especially memorable.  Bruce Willis brings gravitas to the role of future Joe; he doesn't say much, but as with his best performances, he's able to convey quite a lot with his piercing gaze.  Older Joe is a complex character, and Willis is able to play his single-minded obsession to commit atrocious deeds for sympathetic reasons.

But this is Gordon-Levitt's film.  Sure, he has prosthetics to make him resemble Willis; but more to the point, much as Josh Brolin did a la Tommy Lee Jones for MEN IN BLACK 3, Gordon-Levitt has studied Willis's mannerisms and voice, coming off as a truly convincing younger version of the actor.  And yet, the role isn't mere imitation; Gordon-Levitt proves why he's considered one of the best rising actors out there right now, bringing a haunting sense of pathos (not to mention cojones) to his role.  Thanks to his performance, and Rian Johnson's script, LOOPER comes off as one of the most unique, memorable science fiction/action films in years.  It'll go down as a cult classic, and maybe one day, simply a classic example of the genre.",1357171200,42,2239,4.880952380952381

Happy to say that while it's not Blade Runner, we both felt it really lived up to its reputation. A lot of fun, a pretty well-structured story (for being so complicated), and an emotional dimension that we both found compelling.

Not just disappointing. I mean ... why did this get to production stupid? How many Hollywood big-shots does it take to be really really stupid stupid. It's not a ""smart but confusing"" sci-fi film as the promoters describe it. It's confusing because it's wrong ... illogically wrong. The ending does not actually make any logical sense at all.

5646633,4,B00BLOKNVK,"Time travel and telekinesis make an intriguing blend in Rian Anderson's sci-fi thriller LOOPER.  An innovative and complex plot unfolds in a violent and almost surreal landscape.  Without repeating the details of the plot, suffice to say you need to play strict attention to absorb the twists and turns.
Joseph-Gordon Levitt is barely recognizable with his prosthetics designed to make him into a younger Bruce Willis.  Levitt is very good in assimilating Willis' mannerisms and persona.  Willis, the senior citizen's resident action hero, acquits himself well, although there's no real surprises with his performance.  Emily Blunt displays her versatility once again in a scene-stealing performance.  Jeff Daniels, Paul Dano and Garrett Dillahunt round out the talented cast.
LOOPER is an innovative and engrossing film, a nice change of pace from zombie and post-apocalyptic disasters.",1357171200,,887,5.582089552238806
5646634,5,B00BLOKNVK,"Bruce Willis, Joseph-Gordon Levitt, Jeff Daniels, and Emily Blunt (great performances by all) plus the concept of this movie is what drew me into it...and I absolutely had to get to the theater to see this after it came out.  I called up my dad, as I suspected this would be a movie he would enjoy as well (we both are big fans of action & sci-fi, and long time Bruce Willis fans), and we arranged to go out one afternoon and check this one out.

Going into the movie, all we both really knew was that it was sci-fi and there was time travel involved...and the trailer we saw had looked good.  What we got though was more than we'd expected, and what we both agreed on was probably one of the most original films in sci-fi lately!  We both very much enjoyed this film, and of course the day it came out I purchased it, because I knew I wanted to add this gem to my collection.

I'm not going to go into a lot of detail about the plot and spoil anything for anyone, but the one thing I will say is that, from the best I can describe it, the movie is a combination of Time Cop, Butterfly Effect, and Firestarter/Carrie...with a little bit of Die Hard thrown in.  It is not in itself either one of those movies though, but those films definitely came to mind during the course of the movie, though albeit it's own entity, and by the end of it my mind was blown...it was one of those Neo type thing with me by the end.

I don't want that to take away from the movie but I couldn't help but notice.  There was plenty of action and even a bit of romance.

We are not dumb. But most other movies explain things we don't need to know. (Resident Evil Retribution is one of the worst movies I've seen because the narrator spend half a day explaining what the movie was about. Besides the fact that R.E.R. was ridiculous.)

5646666,3,B00BLOKNVK,"This is an OK movie with an OK plot. The acting is really good and Cid (Pierce Gagnon), the little kid, saves the movie. Bruce Willis is well, ...Bruce Willis nothing exceptional, nothing earth shuttering. Just your usually Bruce from Die Hard.

The year is 2040 (...or around there) and people live a peaceful life in a futuristic society with a lots of poverty and cars that look that were made in 2000 (!). Time travel was not invented yet. But, it was invented in the future (30 years later) and immediately was outlawed and only available on the black market. In addition, the mafia (in the future) cannot kill people freely because everybody has an ID and it is difficult to make someone disappear. And as always the mafia found a solution. They send the victims in the past to be killed by the ""loopers"". The loopers are just killing machines. They kill people and make them dissapear. Essentially the victims never existed. However, now and then a looper must be terminated too (closing the loop). So the mafia sends the looper back from the future (older) with a lot of gold. Basically the looper kills his older self. He has 30 years remaining in his life which he can enjoy by spending the gold on drugs, hookers, air bikes etc.

And life goes on with everybody partying, doing drugs, sleeping with hookers, until things are getting complicated because Joe (the young version played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) fails to kill the old Joe (Bruce Willis). However, Bruce Willis is mad (as always) because the mafia killed his wife (in the future) while apprehending him. So he sends himself in the past to find the guy who changed society drastically (the rainmaker) and kill him while he is a 10-year old kid. Like this his wife will not be killed (in the future). Here, now you have the plot! Deal with it...

There are a lot of things wrong with this movie but the cars are the most important inaccuracy that jumps at you. All cars look like today's cars. Even the cars around 2070 look like todays cars. The pickup truck that Emily Blunt drives (Cid's mother/babysitter) is like the one that was made yesterday. So while we have invented time travelling we just didn't make anything better than an SUV or a pickup truck? Hum...Another problem: Emily shoots young Joe in the right shoulder, old Joe (Bruce) feels it and touches his right shoulder were he has the scars, and two scenes later Emily is taking care of young Joe's left shoulder. Come on people, check the scenes, don't be so arrogant, and make an effort. Why are you (the Hollywood crowd) assuming that some people are not going to notice? Not everybody who watches movies is an idiot, a low information voter. This attitude makes total sense with your political convictions and the fact that you really believe that you are part of some kind of ""elite"" (or the ""Hollywood nomenclatura"") and the little people (us) don't know much. Wake up! You depend on us.

This is an average movie with an average scenario/plot and of course an ending that MUST be politically correct. That is the problem with the Hollywood movies. They must be PC. While the ending was somehow unexpected, it didn't make any sense. If the ending stands, then the movie and the plot should not exist (...probably for the better).

5646672,3,B00BLOKNVK,"LOOPER did fairly well in the box office in October 2012 and now that it is available on Instant Video and in DVD the popularity grows. Written and directed by Rian Johnson it is another take on the concept of time travel (a topic that never seems to miss with audiences) and while the film is entertaining, it is very bloody and gory and the only salvation is the fact that the cast contains some of filmdom's more popular actors.

The story is best summarized by the lead character in the film, Joe played with skill (despite phony makeup trying to make him resemble Bruce Willis - his looper self) by Joseph Gordon-Levitt: `I work as a specialized assassin, in an outfit called the Loopers. When my organization from the future wants someone to die, they zap them back to me and I eliminate the target from the future. The only rule is: never let your target escape... even if your target is you.'

Or, stated another way, in 2074, when the mob wants to get rid of someone, the target is sent 30 years into the past, where a hired gun awaits. Someone like Joe, who one day learns the mob wants to 'close the loop' by transporting back Joe's future self (Bruce Willis). So the film opens in the year 2044, and Joe is a looper, friends with Seth (Paul Dano in a very brief appearance) and lovers with Suzie (Piper Perabo) and working for head looper Abe (Jeff Daniels). Joe discovers his next assignment is himself (Bruce Willis, Joe from the future).  He also encounters Sara (Emily Blunt) who knows the strange coincidences that are about to happen (!) and mothers a child Cid (Pierce Gagnon) who has particularly useful end-of-the -world powers etc etc.

It is a clever idea and if time travel and assassinations fascinate you, then this is a well-made move in that genre. Grady Harp, January 13",1357084800,2,1799,4.54320987654321
5646673,1,B00BLOKNVK,"This film is a variation of Terminator 2. Man goes back in time to, essentially, kill Hitler. Big production costs melt down quickly to small town woman and little boy dealing with a rouge cop from the future. And Bruce Willis is a tertiary character. Any actor could have played his part.

The film was a big disappointment.",1357084800,3,325,4.603448275862069
5646674,4,B00BLOKNVK,"This is a futuristic action film that has a time-travel concept, which is one of my favorite concepts. The film plays out a sort of a ""battle"" between the future version and the present version whereas the ""Future Joe"" will do anything to preserve his life, even to save his wife, but the ""younger Joe"" doesn't care about that since Future Joe's memory is now only a ""possibility,"" not a definite, as he only see ""the now."" Future Joe is driven by his own need for survival, and ironically, so is the young Joe. That is the powerful conflict, which is interesting.

The other concept that is interesting is an ability to move objects with one's hand/mind, known as ""TK."" At first, I was wondering why would you have two different yet paranormal abilities into the same story, then I realized that a child whose TK will become so powerful in the future that became the man that Future Joe very much wanted to kill. So, the idea that if you travel back in time to kill Hitler, he would be a child when you see him...then the question is: would you do it? Future Joe plays that out by desiring to kill a younger version of an evil tyrant that he perceived.

But, here's the rub. Future Joe came from a ""probable"" future, and by coming back, he has changed it but still ended up doing what he feared: he'd create the version of the man that he very much wants to take out. There was no possibility of the child turning out to be ""good"" in his mind and that the child needs to be taken out. There is the child's mother who believes the good in the child, there is a futuristic man who believes the child to be evil no matter what, but there is the young Joe who have a choice between letting the child to grow up or be killed. In the end, that choice was made to which Future Joe haven't at least expected.

Personally, this is very good movie with such an originality. It's a good story that will get a viewer thinking about the concept of time travel and the idea of a ""loop.""",1357084800,,1973,4.2841823056300266

Perhaps I'm a bit jaded, having been spoiled by some of the better Time Traveler movies of the past two decades with films like Primer, Time Crimes, and Twelve Monkeys. By comparison, Looper seems to feature a lazy attempt at world building with numerous plot holes. Performance wise, however, this film features some fine acting from all the leads, two of whom happen to play the same person. Emily Blunt is particularly believable in her role, which seemed to veer significantly from her usual fare.

5646683,5,B00BLOKNVK,"Looper is a SciFi film based on time travel. In 2074, time travel will be invented and immediately outlawed, used only by the most powerful criminal organizations to send people back to be executed without a trace. In 2044, Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a looper, an assassin that executes the targets sent from the future. Eventually, Joe's loop is set to be closed as he encounters an older version of himself sent to be killed. Looper is a mind-bending SciFi film, packed with action and thrills.

Looper has a great story. The entire ""Looper"" concept is actually intriguing and innovative; assassins with targets from the future, with the fear of one day having your ""loop closed"". The first half of the film starts off with a fast pace and plenty of action sequences, while the second half slows down and focuses more on dialogue and story. There are plenty of memorable moments in this film, like Joe and Old Joe's first confrontation, and their confrontation in the diner, along with Old Joe's amazing shootout/escape sequence. Another concept/scene I enjoyed was the ""what happens to the 2044 you, scars the 2074 you""; for example, if a character loses a couple of fingers, the futuristic character also loses them in real time. There are more scenes I really enjoyed, but I rather not spoil the film. The ending of the film was also amazing, and unexpected; again, I won't comment any further to avoid spoilers. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis did an amazing job in this film, they were really able to match their personalities for this film. The music was also great. One of the minor flaws, in my opinion, was the lack of emphasis on the futuristic world; although it does briefly introduce the world, it doesn't create a fully-immersive experience, where you're eyes would often wander to view every detail of the environing. I would've enjoyed a bit more emphasis on the setting, but I understand the budget constraints. Another issue that I should bring up is Joseph Gordon-Levitt' appearance in this film: his appearance is different, most likely to match Bruce Willis (since they play the same character), but did not distract me at all. If you're worried about this, watch a clip or view a screencap (even the cover shows it) before paying.

Overall, Looper is an amazing SciFi film, with a intriguing concept and stylish execution. I highly recommend a purchase for SciFi fans, and action fans.

The story goes places that are disturbing, intriguing and emotional.  The performances are all strong, (Jeff Daniels is great as a tired mobster) and there is some of the best directing of a child actor I've seen in recent memory.  The film is quite violent, but it never feels exploitative.  They pick their moments here, which makes the screen violence meaningful and at times, terrifying.

5646731,5,B00BLOKNVK,"I will start off with what I liked most about this film. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance as the younger Bruce Willis is nothing short of spectacular. In fact, his performance really sold the film and made it believable. Yeah, the makeup really helped, too, but JGL's sharp talent for transforming into another role (rather than mimicking it) completely changed the tone of the film. Looper easily could have been JGL chasing down Bruce Willis, but that was not the case. This was a young Bruce Willis chasing down an older Bruce Willis. Rather than the traditional man vs. man theme, this film effectively and creatively utilized the man vs. self theme, which I enjoyed.

I also liked the visuals of this film. The futuristic world in this film is very feasible. I look at this world and think that it could actually exist someday. Rian Johnson clearly put a lot of thought into the setting. From a technical standpoint, the cinematography and editing was beautiful. This film distinguishes itself with its unique text, narration, and, most of all, fantastic camerawork. I wish I could describe the visual style of this film, but it is so unique and unlike anything I have ever seen before.

As far as the acting goes, I really have no complaints. As I said before, JGL was brilliant. I'd say this is Bruce Willis' best film in years. I was skeptical about Emily Blunt's character, but I came to like her and was sold on the idea of her being a country girl. Even her kid was great. Usually, I hate little kids in movies. They are almost always obnoxious and are usually used for low-grade humor. This wasn't the case in Looper. I can't say much without giving away key plot points, but the boy's performance and role in the film is amazing.

I really have no complaints about this film, other than how slow it can be. The trailer makes you think this will be a fast-paced action film, but much of the action in the trailer plays out as quick montages in the film, which was a little disappointing. I think I would have liked just a little more action, and with this film being just under two hours, it could have spared a few more minutes of that.

Looper is a groundbreaking film on so many levels. It is well-written and thought-out, visually striking, and expertly acted. This film lived up to my high expectations, which is a rarity. Looper will definitely be added to my Blu-Ray collection. Highly recommended for Sci-Fi and Action fanatics, and anyone who wants to experience a mind-bending thriller.",1356912000,,2510,4.684807256235827
5646732,1,B00BLOKNVK,"This movie was not even good. Probably going to use this disc to scrape snow off the car tomorrow.

5646733,3,B00BLOKNVK,"In Rian Johnson's latest film, Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays a ""looper,"" a hitman named Joe in 2044 Kansas City where time travel has been invented - and outlawed - and nearly 10% of the world's population has developed a telekenetic mutation. That hasn't stopped crime bosses from sending their targets back from the future, where Gordon-Levitt and other loopers dispose of their bodies so they can't be tracked. The loopers themselves become their own targets after their contract runs out 30 years after the fact - something that becomes a problem when Gordon-Levitt's future self (Bruce Willis) manages to escape from his assassination, and tries to convince his younger incarnation that the world is going to be destroyed if a crime boss dubbed ""The Rainmaker"" is able to have his way.

Johnson's picture is most effective during its first half. Working with a modest budget, ""Looper"" mixes the familiar with the futuristic in a dirty, dank environment, and the movie's use of time travel eschews standard genre devices - at one point, Willis' character even tells Gordon-Levitt to stop thinking about past/present ""space-time continuum"" rifts, as if to urge the audience not to get hung up on technical details (in this movie, unlike ""Back to the Future,"" changing the past doesn't erase one's future existence, but rather clouds over one's memories). The story, though, shifts gears completely in its second hour, with Gordon-Levitt's younger protagonist venturing onto a farm, encountering a young mother (Emily Blunt) and her son while Willis' older half searches for the child that will eventually become ""The Rainmaker.""

It's during the movie's later section when ""Looper"" loses its momentum and asks the audience to shift gears into something resembling a remake of ""Firestarter"" - something that comes off as unexpected and not entirely satisfying. The movie never regains the forward narrative thrust of its first half, and is also hampered by characters who are almost completely unlikeable - Gordon-Levitt's distracting make-up also doesn't seem to have been entirely necessary, as the actor would've been capable enough to mimic Willis' persona with less prosthetic involved. Willis himself is fine, and Emily Blunt does believable work as the child's mother, but none of them are particularly engaging or sympathetic. Johnson's script also, frustratingly, dangles questions in front of viewers without making a strong enough connection to whether or not they make sense dramatically (as it's impossible to go into these aspects without spoiling the plot, I won't comment any further, but they partially involve the picture's ending). It's one thing to be ambiguous, but it's another when the dots are so weakly connected that the suggestion of certain concepts seems to come out of thin air due to a lack of development.

""Looper,"" then, is a cold and unusual film - less a ""groundbreaking"" genre picture than it is an interesting B-movie with intriguing elements but something fundamentally lacking in its center.

""Looper""'s Blu-Ray includes over 20 deleted scenes (17 of which are exclusive to the format), featurettes (including a profile of the scoring by Nathan Johnson), commentary from Rian Johnson, Gordon-Levitt and Blunt, plus a BD exclusive ""Sci",1356825600,28,3273,5.288461538461538

5646735,4,B00BLOKNVK,This movie sucessfully engages you with a seemingly cliche time travel dialogue with top notch performances by both Levitt and Willis. Then Emma Stone enters the movie. Brilliant screenwriting and untouchable special effects. BRAVO!,1356739200,,232,5.852941176470588
5646736,5,B00BLOKNVK,"It's rare these days to find a truly exciting and thought-provoking science fiction film. When one does come along, it should be cherished and talked about among genre fans so the joy of viewing it is spread throughout the community. ""Looper"" is one of those prized treasures that deserve to be talked about and doted on.

Time travel is invented and declared illegal in the near future. The mob uses it in a very inventive way. Disposing of a body after eliminating a target has become very difficult thanks to science and forensic advances. They use it to transport a target into the past where a hired assassin called a ""looper"" kills them and then burns the bodies. Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is one of these highly-paid gunmen who are living the high life. That is until he's contracted to kill his future self (Bruce Willis) and things get complicated.

Writer / director Rian Johnson (""Breaking Bad,"" ""The Brothers Bloom"") has created an intelligent and complex story that keeps viewers glued to the screen. It's been a long time since I've seen a film that so wonderfully blends together science fiction, action, and such a high level of emotional depth.

I couldn't stop thinking about the premise of the movie throughout its two hour running time. There's never been a better visual illustration of the tragic aphorism, ""Eat, drink, and be merry; for tomorrow we die."" ""Looper"" also drums up some paranoia and makes you re-examine the statements ""Every action has a reaction"" and ""Everything we do matters.""

The audio and video quality for ""Looper"" is beautiful and sounds great in a home theater setting. The picture is striking thanks to a great high-definition transfer. Colors all blend well together and are vibrant in their own distinct ways. The 5.1 surround brings to life every startling gunshot and sound effect used from the time-traveling pod noise to the rustling of crops on a farm.

There's a good amount of special features included in the Blu-ray version of ""Looper."" Director / writer Rian Johnson and actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Emily Blunt provide audio commentary. Over 20 deleted scenes are found with optional commentary by Johnson and actor Noah Segan. It also contains three featurettes entitled ""The Future from the Beginning,"" ""The Science of Time Travel,"" and ""Scoring 'Looper.'"" An animated trailer for the movie is included as well.

""Looper"" is everything a science fiction movie should be. It uses entertaining storytelling to deliver a message or social commentary in a non-threatening and exciting way. I would use ""12 Monkeys"" and ""Source Code"" as comparisons to ""Looper"" if someone wanted an idea of what to expect from the movie. Great performances by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bruce Willis, Emily Blunt, and Jeff Daniels only add to the quality of this soon-to-be classic film.",1356739200,,2826,5.027777777777778

5646739,2,B00BLOKNVK,"Well, the timing could not have been worse.  ***SPOILER WARNING - ok, so here is this guy that in order to save his wife, he goes around killing children and shoots one that is simply standing right outside his own house.  The kill John Connor back time travel crap is real BS in that is it any surprise that we have these country wide mass shootings?  At one point when the little kid is splattering a guy in the living room, some guy in the theater behind me exclaims, ""cool"".  Really? Not horrific or really sad that a kid is doing this?  The old Bruce Willis as is stated, is willing to kill for his wife - yes, he is willing to kill ANYTHING and anyone for his wife.  For his own selfish purposes - not for anything else - not even really for his wife, for himself.  In one scene it is even pointed out that there is a simple way to protect and save his wife but of course no, he wouldn't have any of that - because it was all about what he wanted for himself and HIS loss of her.  Going back to the child killing scenes.  So he knows that ONE of these 3 children is going to do something bad, which means that he is more than willing to kill 2 innocent children to get at this ""bad"" one.  When he killed the first kid at least I can tell you that the theater was DEAD quiet.  A lot of these reviews I see happened before the Newtown shootings - so of course the scene was seen in a different light - or I would hope it would have been.

I went to the movie because it did look interesting, yet I was not prepared for the total lack of empathy or regard for life at all. It was also interesting to see an NRA scenario played out though, one where almost everyone is armed. A guy steals something and another takes out his shotgun and guns him down in the street.  To some that is all well and good.  Of course discharging a firearm in a crowded street and the possibility of him missing and hitting your innocent wife, sister, brother, etc - is that also well and good?  Clearly society has already run down but guns are not necessarily the way to get culture problems back right again.  Even in the wild west, one of the first things to go when it came back to restoring law and order was to remove all of those guns that people freely carried.  Well, that is a thought for another venue, but movies do bring up ideas and philosophical points of view to ponder, at last they do for me.  Don't assume incorrectly that I'm a left leaning liberal because I'm not.  I own guns but this gun and culture problem we have is more complicated than each of its parts - which is the way we tend to deal with issues - in their parts and not as a whole.

I'm not saying that it was impossible to understand the character's position or to care for the different characters that were presented.  That is the only reason why I'm not giving it 1 star.

5646745,5,B00BLOKNVK,"LOOPER is one of the most intriguing and entertaining science-fiction movies that I've seen in some time.  My wife describes it as ""THE TERMINATOR Meets THE OMEN,"" but that simple depiction really doesn't do justice to this multi-layered, well thought out action thriller, written and directed by Rian Johnson.

The story is set in the not too distant future when time travel has been invented, but is forbidden and is only available on the black market.  When the Mob wants to get rid of somebody, they send their victim thirty years into the past where a hit man (or ""looper"") is waiting to kill him.

Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a looper, getting rich off his kills and looking forward to retiring in France.  Then, one day, the Mob decides to ""close the loop,"" sending back Joe's future self (Bruce Willis) for assassination.  The older Joe, however, has other plans.

Johnson's film is totally original in its concept; filled with colorful characters and many unexpected story twists.  I don't want to be a Spoiler, thus I am not going to reveal further plot details.  Bottom line: If you enjoy films that deal with time travel, or just good storytelling then I cannot recommend LOOPER too highly.

Willis and Gordon-Levitt are excellent, as are the rest of the cast, which includes Emily Blunt, Paul Dano, Piper Perabo and Jeff Daniels.

The DVD from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment contains many extras: Feature commentary by Johnson, Gordon-Levitt and Blunt, two ""Behind the Scenes"" featurettes, deleted scenes and more.

The quality of the creative ideas, action and cinematograhy are high, yet the quantity may not be enough to satisfy some heavy action movie fans who got the wrong expection from the trailer and of Bruce Willis.

5646748,1,B00BLOKNVK,"This is a sloppy-thinker's time travel movie. It is not for the more sophisticated sci-fi fan. Contradictions and silliness abound. Characters are both dead and alive at the same time. They have arms and don't have arms at the same time. We learn later in the film, for example, that the lead character kills himself as a young man but he also makes it into old age (and performs acts such as saving an even younger version of himself from certain death). Characters fear their imminent death yet also know they survive into old age. There are so many other silly contradictions and lazy, hackneyed plot devices that I couldn't enjoy any of the action scenes or other aspects of the film (which now I think about also were rather substandard). It's written by someone who clearly don't have any clear, original ideas (actually it faces many of the contradictory time travel plot scenarios as the Back To the Future movies).

Those who can hold a complex, logical thought or two in their heads will likely be disappointed by this movie and maybe even feel a little insulted by the laziness of the screenwriter. For good time travel flicks with consistent, interesting plots, I suggests 12 Monkeys (involving a consistent causal loop) and Source Code (a consistent forking scenario).",1356307200,15,1281,4.8493150684931505

  It's 2044, and while time travel has yet to be invented, those in the future use it to their advantage by sending individuals who threaten their business interests back to that time where they can be eliminated by men awaiting their arrival. The men who execute these unfortunate individuals are known as loopers. Joe Simmons (played by Joseph Gordon-Leavitt) is one such man. Simmons (Gordon-Leavitt) is in the employ of a mafia boss in Kansas City who he calls Abe (played by Jeff Daniels). Abe (Daniels) was sent back in time to manage the organization's hired guns as well as their other illicit operations as only someone from the future is uniquely equipped to do. When loopers have outlived their usefulness, they are sent back to be executed their younger self who receive payment in the form of gold rather than the customary silver. This is referred to as ""closing your loop"". In his spare time, Joe abuses drugs, maintains an intimate relationship with a showgirl named Suzie (played by Piper Perabo), frequents a club owned by his employer and is studying French to prepare for his eventual retirement in France. Things start going awry when Seth (Joe's friend and a fellow looper played by Paul Dano) is confronted with the task of closing his loop and fails. His superiors are more than a little displeased by this and so Seth goes to Joe, hoping his friend will hide him. Eventually, Seth is found, maimed, and his now disfigured older self is executed. This is after Seth and Joe both learn that a crime boss known only as The Rainmaker is behind the recent rash of closing loops. As Joe resumes his usual routine, he too is given the task of closing his loop when his older self (portrayed by Bruce Willis) appears before him. Joe's younger self cuts a message into his arm so that he can discuss the situation with his older self. Old Joe (Willis) confirms that The Rainmaker exists and is closing loops, in addition to killing the woman Joe would eventually marry. Both Joes are attacked by men working for their employer and flee, neither intending to do anything other than the task they set out to. Old Joe's being to kill The Rainmaker's younger self, young Joe's being to close his loop.

  Obviously, this is a very complicated story. It's made even more so by characters I haven't mentioned yet. One of them played by the always talented Emily Blunt, the other by child actor and relative newcomer Pierce Gagnon. That said, I found it surprisingly good and highly entertaining. The complicated and paradoxical nature of sending someone back in time to be executed by their younger self as well as other questions about time travel are complicated and that is dealt with by a rather humorous line and then never brought up again. Thankfully. The story is gripping, the performances top-notch, and the conclusion leaves the audience wanting more and wondering what's next. This is a great film.",1355875200,3,3161,4.801470588235294

I think they should have shed a little more light on the psychic abilities because that turns out to be a big role in the film later and when that part surfaces it kinda leaves you confused. By the time that part surfaced I completely forgot about the abilities some of the people have. Must say I did not expect that ending at all.

I think this is one of those movies that are good, you watch a few times but will probably loose its value once you know what happens. More of a rent movie than one I'd buy.",1355875200,,609,4.117647058823529

5646755,5,B00BLOKNVK,"Time travel. It's an idea that's so incredibly simple to start, but so amazingly hard to complete in a logical sense. For years, sci-fi film/TV geeks like myself have debated ad nauseam how certain films break the basic rules of time travel when one goes back in time, because no matter what, your actions are going to have consequences on the future. These possibilities of varying futures were discussed to some end in the film THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT, but sadly, because it's not a very good film, it's made to feel trite. But here in writer/director Rian Johnson's LOOPER, those ideas are put to the test, and it's a test that it passes with flying colors in every aspect of the story it's telling.

It begins in the year 2044. Time travel has been invented, but it's illegal. We have Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a specialized assassin called a ""looper"" who works for an organized crime syndicate whose boss (Jeff Daniels) is from the future. The deal is, when the mob wants someone disposed of, they send them back to the loopers (who know the exact time, date, and arrival point of the target) packed with bricks of silver as payment, the loopers kill them, incinerate the bodies and that's that. Although, the life expectancy of a looper (who are usually in their twenties) is only about their late 40's, and every so often, a looper is forced to kill their future self, which is termed ""closing the loop"" and then, the looper's contract is terminated, they get a big payday, and then go off and live the rest of their lives until they're sent back to die. But one day, Joe meets his adult self (Bruce Willis) as one of his contracts, and he escapes. This is not something the syndicate allows (as evidenced in one absolutely horrific scene), and the syndicate is sent after both the young and older Joe, despite the younger one's promise that he will find and kill his older self. This wild cat-and-mouse game sees the young Joe make his way to the rural outskirts of the giant city and to the farmhouse of Sara (Emily Blunt) and her son Cid (Pierce Gagnon), while the older Joe is stalking the city for reasons of his own.

Now if this was just another simple time-travel sci-fi action film that didn't give much thought to character, dialogue, or plot, it would be somewhat interesting but like THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT, it would have fallen flat. But since this is Rian Johnson, a writer/director who is rapidly reaching a strange hybrid of journeyman AND auteur status with his two previous (and quite brilliant) films, the high-school neo-noir BRICK (also starring Gordon-Levitt) and the con man comedy-drama THE BROTHERS BLOOM (with Adrien Brody, Mark Ruffalo and Rachel Weisz), you're not getting the standard summer fare. Johnson very smartly spends less time dazzling us with millions of dollars of eye-popping set design of futurescapes and also concentrating solely on the action of the film, and gives us an ultimately fascinating character study of two men who are the same man, but products of two very different purposes and motives. We see the life that the younger Joe leads as well, which is a life of semi-luxury, endless clubbing, tough-guy posturing and drug addiction. We also get glimpses into the life that is eventually led by Joe after he ""initially"" closes his loop without incident, and we get a real sense of a man who will justify anything, including some pretty horrible things to prevent the future he knows is coming for him.

Now this is not to say that Johnson skimps on the action or the set design. The future is a pretty dystopian place, littered with junker cars and super-sleek hovercycles, and no one is safe, unless you're one of the privleged. The action scenes have a breath-taking bravura that is intense, disorienting and highly stylized to fit Johnson's aesthetic. Even the weapons used have a strangely old-world feel to them, with huge old-west style pistols and the looper's blunderbuss which is a combo of future and past.

The performances are excellent. This is absolutely Willis' best work in some time as he gives his aging killer real gravity and world-weariness as he ends up traveling to the past in order to fight his tragic future. Gordon-Levitt continues his streak of fascinating and layered performances and continues to show that he is one of the great actors of his generation (the prosthetic work done to make him look like a young Willis is pretty nice too). Emily Blunt is the major standout here, though, as the fierce-tempered Sara, who's only goal is to protect her son, despite what her son is and what he might become. Jeff Daniels and Piper Perabo don't have large roles, but what they do with them are substantial. The real discovery here is young Pierce Gagnon, who plays Cid with a number of different layers, which is surprising for an actor of his very young age. He never seems out of place in this film, and his performance is pretty amazing. Paul Dano and the (surprisingly) ever-menacing Garrett Dillahunt also do a great deal with small roles. Another fun character here is that of Kid Blue, a wannabe shootist (Noah Segan, another Johnson regular), who is both menacing and comical at the same time.

The effects work here in this film is seamless as well, as some characters also display telekinetic ability (one much more so than the other), but is left largely alone in the film so that when it does happen, it happens with maximum effect. There is also a particularly disturbing sequence when one character fails to close his own loop and the syndicate gets their hands on the younger looper's self, and we see in real time what happens to the older self as the younger self is... well, you'll see.

What makes this film so different from other time travel films is that you see actions and consequences not just in the physical world, but from a character perspective as well. There's an absolutely brilliant scene with the two Joes at a diner where they discuss the ideas of time travel, and as it's played by Willis and Gordon-Levitt, it not only helps put the whole idea of time travel in a unique perspective, but it also frames the events of the film in a way that no other time travel film has tried to do, or has done nearly as successfully.

While those who are looking for a popcorn-munching action film are likely going to be disappointed by LOOPER, people who are looking for extremely intelligent, well-written, well-acted, well-directed sci-fi action fare will find themselves EXTREMELY pleased. LOOPER is indeed one of the best films of the year, and will likely find a better and more discerning audience at home than it could find in the theatres.",1355616000,2,6654,4.740932642487047
5646756,5,B00BLOKNVK,"I won't bother with summarizing the plot, which I'd spend ""all day doing, making diagrams with straws.""

I can only say that this is the best SF film I've seen in ages, though I'll be the first to admit that time travel is my favorite ""sub-genre"" in the field.  ""Looper"" is a no-B.S., hard-hitting flick that goes right to the heart of the questions of free will versus destiny that time travel stories have always excelled at, with numerous hommages and in-jokes towards earlier films thrown in to keep movie geeks happy.  Though perhaps it's just me, this is the first film that ever made me ask whether the life I'm living now would be the one I'd want to look back on fondly 30 years down the road, which is a big theme of the movie:  Just how good is hindsight?  Foresight?

""Looper"" gives you no simple answers; there are no good guys, no bad guys; as Young Joe says, it's all about men figuring how what they'd do to keep what's theirs, ""what they got"".  This is a theme that pops up again and again, disturbing and insistent, and the ending gives you no guarantees that the solution was in fact the right one.  In fact, one of the sad--and profound--aspects of the film is that, for all that the two versions of Joe differ, they have more in common than either is willing to admit, and it's this unspoken tension that drives the plot, from the opening scene to the very end if you think about it.

I could go on about this ad infinitum, but the bottom line is that ""Looper"" is an astounding, disturbing, and unforgettable movie that is worth no less than two viewings.  I plan to be front and center on New Year's Eve when it comes out in hard-copy.",1355529600,,1657,4.368078175895765

"".. I saw a mom who would die for her son, a man who would kill for his wife, a boy, angry and alone, laid out in front of him the bad path. I saw it and the path was a circle, round and round...""

I wanted to see ""Looper"" (2012) written/directed by Rian Johnson as soon as I read the first reviews about it. It intrigued me for several reasons. The critics and viewers praised it. The first two Johnson's films were interesting and original and I wanted to see his new work. I am a fan of the time travel genre. Where else does the hero sit at a table in a roadside diner facing himself, either thirty years older, or thirty years younger - depending on which side he is sitting? Or where else rather clichd phrase ""he was in a deadly conflict with himself"" means just that? And more. What does a man feel at gun point, with himself holding the gun, either thirty years older, or thirty years younger?

Another reason for me was Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the main character Joe, the looper. He is a convincing versatile young actor, one of the most interesting of his generation. For Rian Johnson, Gordon-Levitt is kind of mascot. Johnson made all three movies with him, and Joseph was a leading man in two. An interesting feature of Gordon-Levitt's role (Joe ""closes the loops of time"" working as an assassin for the Mafia) is how he based Joe on young Bruce Willis. He plays young Willis' on- screen tough guy persona that we so get used to identify with and root for, and he does it very good. Bruce Willis also plays an important role of aged Joe. If you guessed that Willis would be saving the world that got into a serious trouble you may be right. This is what Willis does in the movie well: saves lost children, city, country, planet, and the universe. In ""Looper"" Willis plays retired hit man, whom his crime bosses sent with a bag on his head from the future, 2074 to the past 2044, to get rid of him with no trace. What happens to him when he arrives to the past, who meets him, how will he try to change the past to save the future - it's all in the loop, tied by Rian Johnson.

By Johnson's words, despite the fact that ""Looper"" was a time travel film, he was more interested in creating the human characters, in choices they make in a situation that was caused by travel from future to past. This film is about making difficult choice, the possibility of one person to change the course of history, and how far he'd go for it. Dedicated to the paradox of time, ""Looper"" mixes futuristic science fiction and dark noir known for biting dialogue and off-screen sharp voice in Humphrey Bogart's movies style. Johnson adds the stories of love, not the least the love between a child and his mother. As befits a film about the possibility of time travel, the focus centers on whether it is possible, knowing exactly how the future will turn, to change something fundamentally important in the past, to correct it, and how this change will affect the lives of everyone involved. It would seem that nothing new, original and exciting can come out of the time travel genre after Terminator 1 and 2, 12 Monkeys, The Butterfly Effect, and their granddaddy, Le Jetee that started them all? But Johnson did it and even without a big budget, not trying to make a future in his film looking like a futuristic super modern giant metropolis. On the contrary, not so far removed future of 2044 looks more like the abandoned and gloomy suburbs of big city, shaken to its foundations by deep economic crisis, where the power is already in the hands of large criminal groups that control the time travel and use it to effectively get rid of the enemies sent from the future.

Using the elements of the time travel genre, Looper goes beyond the borders. It asked interesting questions, and gave different answers. Rian Johnson, writer/ director, does not mind to break the rules of genres in his films. His films are more of stylizations, pastiches of genres he likes and interested in. The elements of genres are the building blocks, the bricks for him which he makes his films from. No wonder, his first film was called ""Brick"" (2005).

To create a smart, interesting, original stylization, a game of mind - is not an easy task, and Johnson has the gift for it. His first two films, ""Brick"" and ""The Brothers Bloom"", were both intelligent, curious, but, rather, cerebral variations of films and books that Johnson likes. ""Looper"", his third, is also clever and gripping but what makes it the best of three, it's got heart in the right place. ""Looper"" affected me on a deep emotional level. ""Looper"", in my opinion is one of the best independent American movies of 2012. Being an independent filmmaker, Johnson is able to assert his creative ideas, but without super-budget. But I am glad that ""Looper"" did not look flashy and glamorous. It is more than just an eye-candy. It has a plot, intrigue, and the loop that it will close in a truly original, searing manner. While closing this loop, the film will answer the most important question - can you destroy the source of evil, which will bring tragedy and death to the future, if you look at it right now, this minute and ""you see it. You see a mom who would die for her son, a man who would kill for his wife, a boy, angry & alone, laid out in front of him the bad path. You see it and the path is a circle, round and round...""

5646760,5,B00BLOKNVK,"A mediocre execution of the movie's premise still would have resulted in a pretty cool movie.  A man hunt against the future version of the main character's self?  Awesome.  But the strength of the movie is not that it's about a guy trying to outsmart himself, the two characters are actually very different, though definitely and recognizably the same man.  Basically, both the young and old version are clearly Joe, but you can see the development and changes that have taken place in old Joe, and they make sense.  So it's more than a man hunt against themselves, it's about them trying to figure each other out.

  The movie also had a lot more ""slow"" parts than I expected, and that's what really made the movie.  There was a lot of depth that I didn't expect, and it actually left me asking myself ethical questions.

  Pierce Gagnon is the best 5 year old actor you will ever see.  Most kids can pull off the cute, funny kid, but he pulled off an actual important character.  He displayed so much as a child actor.  Unreal.  His performance alone makes the movie worth watching.

Totally original in the sense that I did not know where this movie was going but once it found it's mark I flat out loved it.
Time travel alway brings up the possibility or impossibility of paradox realities, an issue that the movie tried to address as best they could and were rather successful at it.
Thing is knowing it's about tima travel (call me nuts but I don't think it's possible) you already are more than willing to suspend current beliefs and let yourself get swallowed by this movie.
Terminator would never have been as good if the time travel aspect was not well handled or remotely believable and so ditto for Looper.
But fortunately for us they did a more than decent job of it.

5646767,4,B00BLOKNVK,"A bright, complex challenge to some of time travel's longest-running traps, backed by a seriously curvy, dazzling plot. Although some holes can't be avoided, (that goes with the territory) Looper is able to lean on its high-concept premise for support during such moments and effectively gloss them over. Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, no strangers to sci-fi action sagas, seem perfectly at-home in this oddly familiar future setting, and though they're hounded by a violent gang of darkly-clad killers, the film's darkest role alternates repeatedly between its two leading players. There's a  lot to celebrate in the details here, from the oil crusted, not-so-distant future (which, admirably, looks an awful lot like the present) to the strict rules and regulations of the core concept, and for a short while the film seems content to toy with the spoils of its own ingenuity. Of course, there's also a time for leaving such trivialities behind, and Looper doesn't back away from it. When push comes to shove, it smartly explores the depth and dimensionality of its cast before ultimately pursuing an unexpected, yet appropriate, final destination. Smart, savvy and convincing, my one qualm is that it's occasionally too passive in pressing the accelerator. Worthy of (and rewarding to) multiple viewings.",1353024000,,1315,5.322115384615385

This is probably the best time travel movies since the Back to the Future series and puts a whole new spin to the time travel dangers and obstacles with an old school mob spin on it. Looper is set in 2045 and the main character Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is part of the mob and hired to do the dirty work of the mob in the future and take care of the dirty work of the mob in the future. In the future it is almost impossible to kill someone without the government noticing due to tracking devices, so they send them into the past to be disposed of.  The people that do this for the mob are called Loopers. These loopers don't always work for the mob and one day they have to stop. They stop working when they close their loop, this happens when your future self is sent back in time to be killed by you in the past. This closes the loop and the person live out the next thirty years of your life with a lot of money. When Joe's loop is going to be closed it doesn't go according to the plan and his loop gets away. That is when present day Joe has to take the situation into his own hands. I was amazed at how well they made Joseph Gordon-Levitt look extremely similar to how Bruce Willis looked when he was younger completing the illusion that time travel exists.

Outstanding 21st Century Noir. Haven't seen a really good one since '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Harvest/dp/B0002VYOW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Harvest</a>' or '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Angel-Heart/dp/B0001US62I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Angel Heart</a>'. (although, to be fair, there's a great deal of debate regarding what does and does not constitute neo-noir)

First thing I noticed - 'La Belle Aurore"". Not sure how many of my fellow cinephiles caught it. Rick's first club in Paris. And Joseph Gordon Levitt's character Joe is learning French. Nice touch.

Love that JGL has that early George Raft/later Humphrey Bogart air about him: World-weary, sharp edged, smart. Just like the script. And like the original black-n-white productions, the setting is dystopian, which is not unlike the seedy backdrops of those films from the 40s and 50s. It's basically the same recognizable hordes of sad lost souls, dressed up a bit here and there with anti-grav motorbikes.

Tells the tale of organized crime hit men who don't have to hunt their targets - they're sent back from the future directly to an established fixed position. Even the exact time of their victim's ""delivery"" is known. Clock strikes the chime. Pull the trigger. Bang. Dump the body. Get paid. Repeat. Simple as that.

Except, there's a catch to their seemingly straight deal.

If, for whatever reason, their mob employers decide that their future retired looper selves are a problem - they're grabbed and sent back to their younger versions to be taken care of - a so called ""closed loop"".

But what happens if the loop isn't closed? Suppose a future older looper, facing his own assassination, intentionally chooses to go back to fix what went wrong?

Blending the very best of the now with the best of the past, this film cleverly meshes '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Third-Man/dp/B003ULW74S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Third Man</a>' with '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Terminator/dp/B000F9RB9Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Terminator</a>' and adding just the lightest touches of '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Omen/dp/B00004TS0G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Omen</a>'. Hard to believe, but it works. Works really well. And young Pierce Gagnon was creepily convincing. Not sure he has a future in the business, no pun intended, given how many can't-miss acting phenoms are littered across the entertainment landscape, forgotten and often struggling to live a normal life. Still, in this very powerful performance - wow.

Sharp celluloid that I would recommend for fans of the old school dark musty corners and the epitome of pointed controlled violence. Superior noir qualities walking about in an unfashionable white shirt and black tie.

Movie Recommendation: If you enjoyed this type of film, I encourage you to screen the French production ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cortex/dp/B001OJMMTI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cortex</a>"".",1352419200,,3199,6.5058823529411764

Plus Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance was amazing. He took aspects of his character from mannerisms to gestures to another level. It was not an imitation of Willis but something mopre profound. You could believe that Levitt's character would grow up to be Bruce Willis's character that he was the same character. Even his smile left me with wide eyes because that was spot on Willis.
I loved how this story tackled being at odds with yourself, being your own worst enemy and so forth. It's a film that has action and leaves you thinking. I totally recommend and will definitely have it in my film collection for years to come.",1352332800,,827,4.830985915492958
5646771,4,B00BLOKNVK,"Films involving the barest mention of time travel are usually problematic. Inevitably, a bunch of arm-chair critics will begin to debate all of the ways the time-travel doesn't and can't work, no doubt worrying about their congealing breakfast burrito in the process.

""Looper"", the new film starring Joseph Gordon - Levitt as Joe, a 'Looper' who kills the mob's enemies, seems to embrace all of the possible problems and work with them making them more real in the process.

It's 2074 and time travel has now been banned. But the mob still uses this outlawed technology to send their enemies back from the future to 2074, into the hands of the Loopers who are waiting to execute them. Joe has one standing order; as soon as the victim appears, he is to shoot them and then collect his payment, silver bars attached to the hit's back. In this way, the mob essentially erases all traces of their future enemies. And Joe is well-aware that he will one day be expected to kill himself. When this happens, he can take the gold bars attached to his older self, and try to live a few years as well as possible. But he isn't looking forward to this day.

When Old Joe (Bruce Willis) arrives, he catches his younger self by surprise and escapes. During the intervening years, Old Joe has learned a lot about Cid, the head of the mob. Now that he has been sent back to 2074, he wants to find the younger Cid and correct a lot of bad things before they happen by killing the future mob boss. But young Cid is an orphan, living with and cared for by Sara (Emily Blunt), who will do anything to protect him. Younger Joe is unaware of all of this. He just knows he has to find his older self and avoid the hit men sent by his boss, Abe (Jeff Daniels), the local mob boss.

Written and directed by Rian Johnson (""Brick"", ""The Brothers' Bloom""), ""Looper"" is a well-made action/ sci-fi hybrid. Both of Johnson's earlier films were good, but flawed. With ""Looper"", he proves the adage 'third times the charm.'

The sci-fi elements work because they are almost downplayed. Kansas City in 2074 doesn't look a lot different from what it probably looks like now. The cars are a little different, the streets are dirtier and filled with more homeless, the guns are a little different, but with the exception of the whole 'time travel' thing, not much seems to have changed. Because Johnson downplays the elements of the 'future', the future seems more real. Because everything seems more real, our inquisitive minds spend less time thinking about the science and looking for loopholes and we just sit back and enjoy the ride.

Johnson uses an interesting, fairly uncommon narrative technique to get us involved in the story. We spend a significant amount of time with Joe (Gordon - Levitt), getting to know everything about the routines of his life. Then, when Old Joe (Willis) shows up, we spend some time flashing back to his life and what he has learned. After we catch up, the story continues and we start to follow them both. Most films would follow both leads, alternating back and forth, dividing our time and attention. It's a nice way for us to get familiar and comfortable with each before launching into a new phase with both.

Gordon - Levitt is very good as Joe. You get the sense he doesn't really enjoy his job, but given the state of the World, his job allows him a comfort most people don't have. So he does his job willingly and well and turns to Suzie (Piper Perabo), a stripper, for solace and companionship. And he seems to sleepwalk through his life, going from one point to another without much joy or sense of accomplishment. But his survival depends on playing a game and doing whatever possible to keep his bosses happy. And he also knows he will eventually be faced with killing himself. This leads him to face everything with a mild case of skepticism. It is a nice way to add maturity to his character and give him depth.

And the alternative is even worse, so he does what he is good at.

Willis' Old Joe doesn't have a lot of dialogue and spends most of the film in action. This allows us to fill in some of the blanks as we watch the flashback illustrating his later life. It also allows us to learn with his character. Yes, he has already witnessed a lot, but when he returns to 2074, he learns new information and has to contend with himself as a younger, stronger, less mature man. He has to assimilate the new information before he makes a mistake. In these moments, we watch how he reacts, we watch as he learns and we learn with him.

The flashback illustrating Joe's life from 2074 forward is particularly interesting and adds a lot to the overall story.

Emily Blunt plays Suzie, a woman who cares for and tries to tame a young boy named Cid. She plays the role with such earnestness, you almost forget about the sci-fi universe she inhabits, even when 'sci-fi' things are happening. She has adopted this child, she is his mother, and she won't let anything happen to him.

Jeff Daniels plays Abe, the local crime boss sent back from the future to keep an eye on things. It is a nice a-typical performance for the actor. He appears to be the same affable guy, but beneath all of the good-nature lives a very deep level of menace and danger. Every moment he appears on screen you feel he could snap at any point. When this pattern is established, we simply wait for the moment. This anticipation creates a high level of suspense.

Paul Dano is also good as Seth, Joe's friend and a fellow Looper. His story provides a nice illustration of what happens to 'Loopers' when their time has come and helps us realize just how desperate Joe is to avoid the same fate.

""Looper"" is surprisingly good and very entertaining.",1352073600,,5731,4.529980657640232
5646772,3,B00BLOKNVK,"Bruce Willis (Die Hard, Pulp Fiction) always seems to choose his films with high action and adventure and a lot of gun fire too, `Looper' does have all that, but it is woven into a story that involves a character, stopping himself from doing something in the past by himself. Confused? Looping time travel is what makes this film a little confusing.

Director Rian Johnson (Breaking Bad, Brick) took his own original script but made it more philosophical and less about the characters. It was a little slow in getting its legs until of course you figured out who was the bad guy and what his objective was. Past meets future and future meets past. Yes, confusing at some points and a little more than weird in others.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Inception, 500 Days of Summer) does an impressive job of not believing himself from the future but ultimately makes a choice that changes his own history.  It's like back To The Future II, rewriting the present to change the future and suffering the consequences, but BTTF was so much better! Oh and Joseph and Bruce are the same person. I'll say no more.

Emily Blunt (The Adjustment Bureau, The Muppets) played an very troubled and intense mother of a boy who is more than what he seems. In fact, he is the key to the film and then in turn, the key to everyone in the films future. Pierce Gagnon (One Tree Hill) plays the son with enormous intensity and he has a great `evil' look that really sells the concept of what is going on. Pierce is very creepy too!

Now a twist for a really great actor was Jeff Daniels (Dumb & Dumber, Speed) performance as a man with an ulterior motive and playing a baddie with some seriously weak henchmen! He is fun to watch and intense in the madness of his mission! Another notable performance is that of Paul Dano (There Will be Blood, Little Miss Sunshine) who really does fear and panic well. Paul also gives great motivation for the time travelling of Joseph and Bruce's character.

I am being vague because it's hard not to say too much without giving things away. The film has a great empathic score by Nathan Johnson (Blue State, The Day I Saw Your Heart) and some basics time travel effects that keep the story first.

Overall I was not impressed with the pace of the film. It took a long time to get going, but once it did it really did become interesting. Not a family film, but definitely film with a twisted family story. I would wait for the DVD/Blu-Ray for this one!",1352073600,,2457,4.495515695067264
5646773,4,B00BLOKNVK,"""Looper"" (2012 release; 118 min.) brings the (initially rather complicated) story of Joe Simmons (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a contract killer in Kansas, Year 2044, who is paid to knock off guys sent back in time from 2074, when time travel was invented and immediately outlawed, and used illegally by ""the bad guys"". Then one day, the guy sent back from 2044 is none other than the older Joe himself (now played by Bruce Willis). Young Joe can't pull the trigger (literally) and so old Joe runs away. It's not possible that two of the same person are running around, so something must be done about it. There are a number of subplots, too long to explain.

When I say that this ""threw me for a loop"", I'm being facetious of course, although it did take me a while before I truly understood what all was going on. That said, once that Bruce Willis comes into the picture after about half an hour or so, the story really picks up and kept my attention all the way through. Much had been made about the make-up of Gordon-Levitt to make him look like a younger Bruce Willis, but it never struck me that he looks ""just"" like a younger Bruce Willis. Not that it matters one way or another. Also I didn't realized until the credits rolled that the role of Sarah is played by Emily Blunt, even though I saw her earlier this year in The Five year Engagement, as well as in Your Sister's Sister.

As others have noted, this movie brings a much appreciated fresh perspective on the sci-fi genre, but I will say more, namely that this is a great movie that will be appreciated by anyone, not just sci-fi fans. ""Looper"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1351728000,,1636,4.4865771812080535

5646775,2,B00BLOKNVK,"Okay, I'm going to agree with most reviewers that say Loopers isn't that good and some reviewers that say it's pretty good. So, it's just okay for me. It is an action/shoot em' up movie, mix in with Sci-Fi elements.

The story gets more interesting as people keep on watching and learning more and more about why the protagonist should try to kill his future self from completing his tasks. The problem is that you have to keep on watching the movie and not get bored with it after some time because I found myself feeling it is dragging and didn't keep my full attention.

Once you learn more about the storyline, which the future self wants to kill these little babies because one of these babies will turn out to be a very bad man in the future and will kill many people.

This movie is a bag of mysteries - there's no real bad guy or good guy because they're all bad guys! So, you don't really have a straight forward person to root for. Instead you are face to decide who is really doing the right thing. Is it right or wrong to kill someone from the future for future events crimes? Is or wrong for a future self person wanting for his future accomplishments to happen without interference? Or is it right for his past self to try to stop his future self from doing his future accomplishments by changing his present day actions and events? Who is really right here? The future self already lived out his life and has the right to have his life like that, but the present self has the right to make his own choice without any interfering from his future self.

This is not a must see movie, but if you like Sci-Fi and like questioning about possible future events happening or not, then this is what you looking for.",1351036800,8,1722,4.355140186915888

5646777,5,B00BLOKNVK,"Science Fiction: The greatest, most influential genre of the 20th Century. When done wrong it can be disastrous, but when done RIGHT, a masterpiece is born.
And Looper gets everything right.

Looper is influenced by Time-Travel classics such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/12-Monkeys/dp/B000ICXQF6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">12 Monkeys</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Terminator/dp/B00005N5S5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Terminator</a>, yet is extremely original.

Blending stylish, visceral action, with sharp, thought-provoking storytelling, stunning scope and cinematography, memorable characters, stellar acting, pulse-pounding twists, moments of unexpected humour, and a truly moving finale, Looper asks big questions, engages our hearts and our heads, and pulls no punches.

Rising star Joseph Gordon-Levitt leads the film, exuding an intense charisma, definitely holding his own against the older Willis. Bruce Willis, whose 57 years have not diminished his ability to kick ass, is more than awesome as the morally tortured old version of Levitt's character. Emily Blunt rounds out the main cast, with Paul Dano, Jeff Daniels, and Noah Segan absolutely stealing the scenes in their respective roles.

The look of the film is impressive. Johnson and cinematographer Steve Yedlin have crafted the most gritty-realistic and believable future world since Children of Men. Johnson has found the perfect mix of believable physics, and entertaining sci-fi (hover bikes, blunderbusses, and telekinesis). And Nathan Johnson's (Rian's cousin) score suits the film beautifully.

The story is totally original, equalling if not surpassing that of films such as Inception and Source Code. The plot is on the surface simple, but as one digs deeper, they find that Looper is a multi-layered, deep, thought-provoking film. Rian Johnson poses a lot of hard questions to the audience, and as the film progresses, it really makes you think. It's truly one of the best written films of the last 10 years.

But don't  worry, there's  plenty of  action all the  way  through  to keep  you  absolutely riveted  to your seat. Utterly spectacular, brutal, electrifying, roaring, crashing, wicked, thrilling action!

So, in recap:  Looper has a stellar cast, sensational cinematography, a thought-provoking script to die for, and pulse-pounding action. It's both the best sci-fi and the action film of the year. Ranking with Moon, Minority Report, Children of Men, and Inception, Looper is one of the greatest science fiction films of the 21st Century.

A 5 star triumph!",1350604800,7,2658,6.080428954423592
5646778,5,B00BLOKNVK,"First off I have to say the studio press blurbs don't even hint
at the complexity of the story. I'll be thinking about this movie
in the next few days.

Second, the makeup to turn Joe Gordon into a young Bruce Willis
is astonishing. This is Oscar-caliber work. Joe's mom was right,
they turned her son into a different man.

Third, I think Looper is a morality play (a good thing) in the
same sense as Planet of the Apes (going back to the novel).
Looper's characters are driven so hard by their own damaged,
selfish individuality, the question becomes ""Can any single one
of them, just once, step outside themselves?""

One of the classic purposes of science fiction, going back to
H.G. Wells or earlier, is for the writer(s) to warn us about
something we may not yet have imagined. Looper is a very grim
warning of what may happen with the continued advance of
technology. Organized crime has existed for centuries or millenia,
and like all social organizations, it has its own interests in
the future and in technology.

The larger vision of American and World society is wrapped up
in all this, and it is very bleak. These characters are outside
any stereotype of ""good"" or ""bad"", and ""the good guys"" are no
where to be found. With these characters all we can hope for is
that one of them will stop themself.

Having said that, the broad critical opinion on Looper is correct,
this is a very good movie. But way, way not a feel-good movie, and
very definitely not for kids. If Hunger Games was maybe 80% dark,
and District 9 was 95% dark, Looper is more like 99% dark.

Or perhaps I should say 99% drama.",1350432000,,1607,4.486301369863014
5646779,4,B00BLOKNVK,"In the future(2074)time travel has been discovered, but it is illegal and used only by the most powerful criminals on the black market as a form of body disposal .There gangsters use time travel illegally as a technique to commit assassination without leaving evidence,using `loopers' in the past(2044) to do the killing of potential victims. Those who fun afoul of the syndicates are hog-tied and sent back in time to 2044, where they are met by a ""looper"" with a shotgun. He finishes the job, takes his reward (bars of silver strapped to the victim),and waits for his next assignment. Young Joe(Joseph Gordon-Levitt) drives round the city in a flash car,takes designer drugs,has a prostitute girlfriend.

Young Joe arrives in a rural field outside of the poverty-stricken city every day and waits for his victims to appear, executing them with a quick shot from his enormous gun (referred to here as his ""blunderbuss"") and tossing them into an incinerator. The only catch is that, at some point, every looper must ""close the loop"" and kill their future self to close their contracts, a stipulation that Joe has trouble with when his older self (Bruce Willis) arrives and escapes his certain fate. Young Joe is at the mercy of his gang lord boss Abe(Jeff Daniels),a slovenly hood. Old Joe's escape is to ensure the demise of a mysterious crime lord from the future,the Rainmaker,the future's criminal mastermind,who when preparing to send old Joe back killed his wife,and now plans to erase all loopers. Old Joe enlists the help of young Joe in his attempt to prevent this possible future. He hunts for 2 people who might be the future Rainmaker.,while young Joe finds himself protecting a 3rd candidate, Cid,and his mother Sara(Emily Blunt).This sub-plot is more compelling emotionally,the isolated woman with a special child,and played with fanatastic panache by Blunt and Gagnon.

If something happens in the current timeline it retrospectively effects the future. If you put fun over logic then this film works. Time travel does work in a way that allows the events of Looper to occur. Set in Kansas 2044,the crime-ridden dystopia is decked out with all sorts of futuristic gadgetry:computer screens as thin as glass, telekinesis, hyper-stylized drugs and weaponry,hover-cycles,floating crop dusters. The film has beautiful story-telling,superb characters,surprising and disconcerting,an animated drive,a front-loaded narration,an entertaining romp mixing sci-fi and western genres with great themes. Rian Johnson has proved why he's an interesting director/ writer,with allusions to 12 Monkeys,Terminator,Source Code,Omen and Children of the Corn.

5646780,4,B00BLOKNVK,"The movie takes on some unique aspects. Perhaps the best way to describe the film is that it reminded me of ""Terminator"" without cyborgs. This is a film that deals with time travel. It addresses some of the paradoxes of time travel, but ignores others. In the near future, time travel is possible and outlawed. As the old saying goes, ""If time travel is outlawed, then only outlaws will time travel."" Weirdly the outlaws use time travel to dispose of bodies. People are transported to the past where they are shot/killed/ and disposed of by people called Loopers who are well paid in silver.

Something happens to the system as Loopers are rounded up and sent back to be killed by their younger selves. To add to the weird, there suddenly appears mutant humans who have mild amounts of ""TK"" or telekinesis powers.

5646782,4,B00BLOKNVK,"OK, the time-travel premise is pretty thin. The script invites you to stop thinking about it and get on with the plot. Which itself is pretty thin: Gordon-Levitt's character Joe, without knowing it, is assigned to kill his future self (Willis as Old Joe). Willis thinks this is a bad idea. He's already gotten rid of the team sending him back to be killed, and isn't about to put up with any fuss from a puppy half his age - not even himself.

From there, the chase is on. Joe is in deep poo with the criminal organization for failing to complete the assignment. The criminal organization is in deep poo with Old Joe for messing up his future life. Needless to say, the criminal organization fares badly against a massively peeved Willis.

It's an enjoyable action flick with a few surprises, including the final one. A good script and great performances save it from the basic inanity of its premises. Still, it's commodity entertainment and utterly forgettable.

5646783,5,B00BLOKNVK,"Wow. It's rare for a film to live up to or surpass the hype given to it. The big examples are Avatar and The Avengers. The films didn't live up to or deserve the endless praise given to them, while on the other end The Hunger Games and The Dark Knight Rises lived up to and surpassed the praise given to them. I hadn't heard much about Looper except for that Bruce Willis was in it along with Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and it involved time travel. For months and in recent days just like The Master has been seemingly getting endless praise from critics, and some time I do question the professional critics out there. They many times seem to heap heavy praise on films that absolutely don't deserve it and ignore films that do. Maybe they think to highly of themselves I don't know, but I never trust critics entirely. That's why I went into the film not setting the bar to high. Of course I was going to see the film it had Bruce Willis in it. I can't think of the last film he stared in that I hadn't seen. No the Expendables 2 doesn't count. It wasn't his film and he has basically a cameo in it. Bruce Willis is the man and I'll see virtually anything he stars in.

Does the film live up to the hype and praise give to it? Yes it does, but does it surpass it that's what I'll get to in my review. First off Looper isn't original it isn't the first to do time travel. It has been done many times from Star Trek, the Terminator films, Frequency, Returner and all the way back to the 1960 classic The Time Machine, so don't expect something truly original. What you do get is something unique well thought out and nearly perfectly executed. The story follows Joe (Levitt/Willis) who is a killer for the mob in Kansas run by Abe (Jeff Daniels) in 2044. The catch is he's a special kind of killer called a Looper. These killers are assigned one task to kill men sent from the future year of 2074 where time travel has been invented and outlawed by the government, and only criminal organizations use it to get rid of people they want dead, because it is virtually impossible to completely get rid of the body in the future. These Loopers lead a good life earning large sums of silver with each kill. There is only one catch to the job and that is in the contract they sign. The catch is they will at one point have to kill their future selves. It quiet the self-cleaning process the mob has devised. The use these killers in the past to get rid of certain elements in the future and to keep the Loopers from talking in the future they send them back to be killed. You can see how a Looper might hesitate to kill his future self and it happens on occasion and the mob has a pretty easy system to deal with that in torturing and killing the present man. That leads us to past Joe meeting his future self-played by the one and only Bruce Willis. Things get out of hand when past Joe hesitates and his future self knocks him out. I can see how that might be confusing to read so I'll stick to their names. Bruce leaves Joseph a note to run and heads to the city. Things get complicated when Joseph doesn't run and heads back to the city to clean up the mess. Only Abe is having none of it deciding to wipe them both out. I won't go into too much more detail about the plot except that Bruce has a plan to change the future to save himself and his wife. That leads Joseph to a farm and Sara (Emily Blunt). The plot is pretty unique. The closest time travel film I could compare it to is Jean-Claude Van Damme's 1994 Time Cop. The decent Time Travel film has kind of the same premise except in reverse. The film just doesn't go as far as it could deciding to just be an action film and nothing more. Looper goes beyond the simple theme and asks questions about Time Travel and what would you do. Like would you kill children if it meant fixing your future and saving your loved ones? How far would you go to change things and can you actually change anything or are you living an endless loop. Looper is a Noir Sci-fi Thriller that blends elements from great films like Blade Runner, China Town, Witness and Bruce Willis's other great Time Travel film Twelve Monkeys. The only flaws in plot were small ones like how did Sara know Joseph was a Looper. Does everyone know about Loopers? The second thing was the parts of the second have faltered a little when they delved into telekinesis. This is me essentially nit picking so people reading this can't complain that I'm saying the film is perfect.

The chemistry by Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt was brilliant. These two worked great together mimicking each other well. Bruce is primarily known for being an action star, but the man can act. He's shown it in Twelve Monkeys, Sin City, Unbreakable and other films and Joseph is really becoming one of the best actors of this age. He's proved that in the films I've seen him in which include The Lookout, Inception and the Dark Knight Rises. I haven't seen Jeff Daniels in a lot of films recently, but he worked with Joseph in The Lookout and he was in the fun spider film Arachnophobia and the good civil war film Gettysburg. He is a capable actor and shows it here in Abe mob boss from the future who isn't truly a bad guy. There really isn't a bad guy in the film, but if there were Abe would be the closest thing to it. Then there is Emily Blunt as Sara. She has a limited role in the film only being it from about the half-way point, but what she does with it is heart breaking. I've only seen her in two films but she is brilliant. I loved her in The Adjustment Bureau and she again does a great job. All the characters are flawed looking for redemption and a better life. From saving wife's life to trying to get to Paris, France, or save their child these characters are striving to make a live for themselves even if it is futile.

Does Joseph Gordon-Levitt look like Bruce Willis? Yes, but not perfectly. The makeup people did a brilliant job trying to make Joseph look like a younger Bruce and they partially get there. I'd say they are around 75 percent of the way there. If with the slight flaws the actors acting covers it up easily. The effects weren't anything special, because like Dredd 3D this film had a tiny budget. I believe it has a budget between 30 to 40 million which again tiny compared to modern Hollywood. Still the effects people did a good keeping the future possible. What I mean not going overboard with flying cars, teleporters and the such. The effects and writers kept things in the reals of possible. To be honest though I enjoy special effects and CGI I think when you go overboard with them you take away from the story and characters. The writers and directors know when and when not to use them in the film and it works. I don't think anyone will have any complaints about them. The action is also well done with again nothing truly over the top and Bruce Willis is perhaps the action king. Though I'm sure others would argue that point. To be perfectly honest I've never heard of the director Rian Johnson before. Looking him up I see he's directed Brick and The Brothers Bloom, and again to be honest I haven't seen or heard of these films, but from his job as director of Looper I can tell he has a chance of a very bright future.

Did this for me surpass the praise given to it? Yes without question it did. This film beautifully blends genre's including thriller, noir, action and sci-fi, and inspired by great films like Blade Runner, Chinatown and Twelve Monkey's. Though nothing truly original or ground breaking the film as unique and wonderfully written story along with excellent acting by the great cast. The effects were good, but nothing out of this world along with great action. This is a thinking man's well executed Sci-fi film and I beyond highly recommend seeing this film, and even more than once. I will be seeing it again this weekend.

5646784,2,B00BLOKNVK,"I have to say that science fiction movies are outside my normal viewing so this was an unusual choice.  My impression was that it was more of a thirller but that was incorrect - notwithstanding the numerous dead bodies that pile up.

Is the premise creative?  Yes, but somewhat confusing.  Is the view of the future interesting?  It's what can fairly be called dystopian - dark, poor, depressing.....but it also shows only that part of the city in the future, with no reference to the shiny tall buildings except to see them in the distance.  The oddest thing were the heavy eyebrows of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, which made him resemble even less his future self, Bruce Willis.  Couldn't the director have tried harder to find someone who could have been more credible as a young Willis?  That was  jarring in scene after scene.  Best part of the movie:  Emily Blunt's mother on an isolated farm with a son who has more than a passing resemblance to Damien in THE OMEN.

If the above seems choppy, then it is an accurate reflection of the movie.  Continuity wasn't its strong point but it is discussable and original.  It may also be helpful to note that it is rather slow-moving so if you are someone who gets itchy, this movie will increase your impatience.  There are several parts where nothing happens for quite a while.....and a while more....and so forth.  Then, sudden action.

The plot a lesser version of the grandeur and scale of the Terminator series.  And for any serious sci-fi or fantasy reader who's been spoiled by the rich varied tapestry of Isaac Asimov or George Martin novels ""Looper"" feels lame and sophomoric, bloated and bombastic.

I also seriously question the casting of Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the main role.  He just doesn't have the charisma to be a leading man, and his make-up just makes him look ridiculous.  And how could anyone watch him and think he's a younger version of Bruce Willis?  Bruce who's taller and sturdier and bigger than his younger version seems more like a transplant from ""Die Hard"" than from the future.

Looper is not a very good film. It threatens to be a good film. Halfway to three/quarters of the way through it does become a good film, and quite interesting. Then you realize it's just copying the contrivances of a good mystery and suspense film without being one itself. There's almost a formula. Subject us to 45 minutes of nonsense. Make it interesting, so I suppose we feel smart for having sat through it. Then have a righteous conclusion. Looper is 'well made' and has good acting, I give it 3 stars, but it does not get the 'thumbs up' of approval.

I suspect Willis is supposed to be the star of the film, and the hero. He's the one who kicks the most ass. That's how you can tell, I think. It turns out his younger self is the hero. Couldn't they have made his younger self, couldn't they have made the two actors look more alike? I'm not usually a big fan of Bruce Willis movies for whatever reason. I did like the film Twelve Monkeys. The Fifth Element is OK too - a guilty pleasure (had forgot about that one). Bruce Willis is the highlight of Looper; he gives a good performance. It doesn't hurt that he's the first character in the film who makes sense. He calls his younger, drug using, criminal self an 'idiot who doesn't know what he's doing'. This is more a dark Western than anything else. Using the word 'Looper' in place of Hit-Man does not make it a science fiction movie. Using the phrase closing the loop does not make it a profound one.

It wasn't until thinking about it later, well after the movie was over, that I wondered, what was Bruce Willis doing? Bruce Willis was killing so he could be with his wife, as I remember it. Not to prevent her from being killed. He was killing so he could be with her. How was he going to get back to the future to do this? We see no way for character's in 2040 to return to 2070 (and why are all the characters dressed and equipped as if it's the old west)? If he meets up with his wife he'll be 60 years old and she'll be 20.

Other than the humor and the insight of the Willis character I didn't really like any of the characters. They are all 'anti-heroes', I think. Each is selfish, at best - until the final sacrifice at the end. What is it they say? I think I was kinda hoping the giant crocodile would eat all of them, including the sullen little kid. Perhaps they would all appear before a Looper gun, one at a time and 'pow' it would be over. Frankly the only promising character is the older 'Rainmaker'. At least he is 'closing the loops' which would mean there would no longer be these assassinations taking place, wouldn't it?

What does this film do other than desensitizing us to the murdering of people you've only seen for 2 seconds, and to homelessness, and tell us the way to a better world is to kill yourself? Is it a bit disturbing a young man who lives for today, uses drugs and is a professional hit man appears as a normal every day person, someone the movie goer is expected to identify with easily?",1349395200,7,3012,4.286467486818981
5646790,4,B00BLOKNVK,"""Looper"" is an action/science fiction genre film.

The narrative set in 2044 presents a grim future where organised crime rules, and the majority of society live poorly. In this time of abject poverty time travel is established, but is an illegal enterprise which is used to carry out contract murders, at a time where disposing of victims is easier.

The story unfolds to expose self-interest and lawlessness as decaying hope, but attempts to try to alter the future are the greatest inhibitor for better times.

It is the realisation that a brighter future for the world can only be achieved by not interfering with the passage of time, which culminates in protagonist looper Joe Simmons (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) taking decisive unilateral action against the cascading impact of looping.

5646791,5,B00BLOKNVK,"Rian Johnson is one of the best young directors working today. His first two movies, ""Brick"" amd ""The Brothers Bloom,"" took themes and tropes from older movies, then recombined them in fascinating, energizing ways. His latest film, ""Looper,"" is his finest yet, indeed one of the best films of the year. The plot of ""Looper"" isn't new; we saw bits and pieces of it in ""12 Monkeys"" (one of Bruce Willis' previous movies), ""Inception"" (one of Joseph Gordon-Levitt's previous movies), ""The Terminator,"" ""Blade Runner,"" and ""Children of Men,"" among others. What is new is the depth of characterization and emotion Johnson achieves here, and the moral and intellectual issues he raises about the issue of time travel.

Johnson's initial concept--that the mob of the future has seized control of time travel and uses it to carry out untraceable hits--is brilliance bordering on genius. So is the concept of ""loopers""--i.e. hit men who carry out the time-travel hits, finishing their contracts by blowing away the thirty-years-later versions of themselves. Those concepts give Johnson the framework to create his own, very convincing, near-future dystopia. It also gives two very fine actors, Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, the chance to create a repellent but sympathetic character at two different times of his life, and to have him face what he was and what he's become. Both actors give thrilling performances, but I have to make special mention of how Gordon-Levitt--wearing facial prostheses to make him look like Willis--so perfectly captures Willis' movements, speech patterns and, most remarkably, his facial expressions, which the best prosthetics in the world can't fake.

Many reviewers have recounted the story of ""Looper"" here; I will not, because the less you know going in, the better. I will remark on the general excellence of the cast: Emily Blunt as a young woman with whom Gordon-Levitt has a fateful encounter; little Pierce Gagnon as Blunt's son, who combines the adorable and the creepy to an astonishing degree; Paul Dano and Noah Segan as two of Gordon-Levitt's fellow loopers; and Jeff Daniels as the mob boss, an intriguing cross between Michael Corleone and Dude Lebowski. The technical credits are also remarkable, including Johnson's usual cameraman (Steve Yedlin) and composer (Nathan Johnson, his cousin). Considered one by one, the details of Johnson's futuristic vision probably wouldn't hang together completely. But they hang together well enough to make an exciting, persuasive and moving film.",1349136000,4,2532,5.311720698254364
5646792,5,B00BLOKNVK,"Just like Ryan Gosling in 2011, it seems like Joseph Gordon-Levit is in every movie of 2012, most recently ""Premium Rush"" and ""The Dark Knight Rises."" In a 2006 film called ""Brick"" he hooked up with writer/director Rian Johnson for the first time.  A small film, it showed what Gordon-Levit could do as an actor.

In this big budget collaboration, Gordon-Levit is Joe, a hit man of sorts called a looper from 2044 or thereabouts.  His job is to terminate men like him who are sent back from 30 years in the future. Time travel has become possible in the 2070's era but has been outlawed.  But the outlaws have managed to control it for their own use.

All time travel films have their complications and while this is no exception, Johnson does a remarkable job keeping it simple.  He even goes so far as to set up a scene where old Joe (Bruce Willis) confronts young Joe in a caf&eacute; about how he not only managed to escape, but what life would be like in the next 30 years.  Old Joe essentially tells him not to over-think the time travel aspect.  The same for the viewer.

As hinted above, old Joe comes back but avoids the ""termination"" by his younger self by not being bound with a bag over his head.  This surprises young Joe enough for old Joe to get the advantage.  After old Joe escapes, young Joe must follow and kill him or his own existence will be jeopardized.  This chase along with that of a goon squad summonsed by Abe (Jeff Daniels), the man in charge, becomes more complicated because old Joe is also on a mission to kill a young boy.

This boy (remarkable Pierce Gagnon) will grow up to have a major influence as the head of the criminal empire of the future and the man who decides to kill all of the older loopers (called closing the loop).  As both young and old Joes center in on the boy, yet another wrinkle develops.  The boy's mother (great performance by Emily Blunt) becomes entangled with young Joe.  All of this leads to a conclusion, unexpected but satisfying.

Yes, this is a thinking person's sci fi and yes, you need to pay attention, but it isn't beyond comprehension.  Terrific performances enhance the film which is soaked with adrenaline and tense action sequences. Even the requisite shoot out seems authentic.  Johnson's two future worlds are not filled with spiffy flying cars and laser guns, nor is it a bleak, smog filled world.  It pretty much looks a lot like now with enough evolution to seem real.  This is certainly one of the best films of the year.",1349049600,4,2501,4.501108647450111
5646793,5,B00BLOKNVK,"This is NOT one of those sleek sci-fi movies like ""The Adjustment Bureau"" or ""Surrogates.""

'Looper' is sci-fi noir, and is more akin to 'Blade Runner' in depicting a future where things are like our world, but not quite as nice.  Drug use is rampant among those who can afford it. Poverty is in abundant supply.  Power belongs to the criminals.  One group of criminals are called ""Loopers"" and their job is to kill people who are sent back from the future.  Occasionally the looper has to kill himself; at which point they are given a golden handshake and are sent off to retire with a huge supply of money.

This story kicks into high gear when one person sent back from the future (Willis) knocks out his younger self (Leavit) and seeks to rewrite history by killing the criminal mastermind from the future before he gets into power. At this point the story starts asking time travel philosophy questions, morality questions, and there are absolutely no holds barred as violence and mayhem ensue amidst the theoretical analysis being done.

All the actors are terrific, and the movie's pacing is taut from the moment Willis appears on-screen.",1348963200,3,1145,4.781725888324873
5646794,5,B00BLOKNVK,"Looper is one of the best films I've seen this year. Maybe just right behind The Dark Knight Rises.

Loopers are basically for hire thugs who kill people sent back 30 years by mobsters, since in the future bodies are tagged and can't be desposed of without detection. Then Loopers start getting sent back future version of themselves when they are no longer needed. Let's just say one future Looper remembered what he did 30 years ago to himself and escapes his execution.

Joseph Gorden-Levitt turns in a truly memorable lead performance as a young version of the character played by Bruce Willis, who is back in fine form here. Emily Blunt is great too and the child actor who plays her son knocks it out of the park. He goes from funny to scary and back again.

It has some minor flaws and time travel is always confusing to totally figure out, but the acting, writing and story are fantastic.

Also check out Timecrimes. It came out in 2007 and you have to read subtitles (the dubbing is terrible) but it is a very smart movie that takes many views to put it all together. Or you can be lazy like me and just read all the online theories afterwards.",1348963200,4,1153,4.450236966824645
5646795,4,B00BLOKNVK,"This was a very interesting movie--very futuristic and certainly very creative. I give it 3.5 stars, rounded to 4.  It also was very violent and bloody.  If you are super-sensitive to violence, you probably do NOT want to see it.  If you are still with me. . .

The story begins in Kansas, USA, in the past year of 2044 and is tied to the future year of 2074.  Time travel is illegal, but a criminal organization uses it, along with specialized assassins, to eliminate folks.  If you send someone from 2074 back to 2044 and shoot them, then they never existed (at least most of the time).  (Granted, there are a few flaws with that line of thinking.)

So, our hero (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is in 2044.  In 2074, people are grabbed, tied, bag over their head, transported to 2044 with payment on their back, and shot by our hero.  The folks who are sent back to be killed are called ""loops"".  Our hero is one of several assassins. 2044 is futuristic (and doesn't exactly make you want to still be alive) with lots of people levitating quarters in the air to try to prove they are telekinetic, or have ""TK"".  Lots of drugs around.  You squirt them in your eyes and spin off into lala land.  The friend of our hero lets a loop run loose, and is now on the run and terrified of the new crime boss in 2074 ""Rainman"" (as in reign of terror).  The rumor is that Rainman wants all the loops closed and the loopers killed. (Bruce Willis plays our hero from 2074.)

Interesting movie--different--but lots of killing, lots of blood and violence.  I will not watch it again, but those with stronger stomachs will probably enjoy it.",1348963200,,1617,4.445578231292517
5646796,5,B00BLOKNVK,"By the movie trailer, I thought I knew what to expect from Looper. I thought it would be a semi-mindless sci-fi action movie with little character development and a weak plot. Boy was I wrong.

Looper does have action, it is a futuristic sci-fi movie, yet it is also deep. There is a lot of character development and you really thirst for knowledge about the characters past, or future. It is more violent and there is a bit more swearing that I originally would have thought, however the it is the simple ideas and plot developments which are so well depicted and directed throughout the film which amazed me.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt was great and considering the role, of being the young Bruce Willis, he did great. Levitt is the main character, though his older future self, Bruce Willis also holds quite a large role too.

You may have noticed in the trailer that Joseph Gordon-Levitt does not look quite like himself. This is true because they digitally altered his face, eyes and nose to look like Bruce Willis's rugged mug. They really did a great job of doing this and I was honestly quite surprised.

As far as the story goes, I was caught off guard about a lot of things. There are a few twists in the plot, however they are more like surprises that I did not see coming which further advance the story and what you think you may know about the characters.

Over-all Looper was a great sci-fi action movie and it is one of the better movies I have seen all year. I do plan on purchasing this on Blu-ray the day it is available.

Bruce Willis adds some star power to the mix as well, which helps to bolster up this film which is little more than a derivative of ""La Jetee."" The story has virtually no development, being more or less a germ of a concept or idea for a story. It also suffers heavily from the clear butcher-marks of studio executives, with many scenes, sidelines, characters, and effects added simply for sensationalistic effect, no doubt in an effort to make the movie more accessible to a wider audience. The voice-over, inserted at crucial times to ensure the audience understands the importance of what is occurring and does not need to exert the effort to think, is at times painful. Flashy CGI effects for floating motorcycles and Joseph Gordon-Levitt's creepily rubbery ""Bruce WIllis"" make-up do not help the cause. This all detracts from the story, which would be more of a tragedy if the story was better. As it is, one is left with a vague sense of dissatisfaction of jumbled editing overlying a purposefully affected recursive plot line.  The movie achieves it's goal of making back the investment for the studio at the expense of destroying what could have been a far-leaner cult classic.  A flawed gem.",1348963200,,1404,4.970212765957447

5646799,2,B00BLOKNVK,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

The near universal critical acclaim for 'Looper' is something I'm having a hard time fathoming. I suppose we haven't seen a great sci-fi thriller in such a long time, that as soon as a mediocre to average flick such as this one comes along, everyone is jumping on the bandwagon, practically calling it a masterpiece!

My first problem with 'Looper' is the overall concept. A crime syndicate in the future (2074 )wants to dispose of its victims by sending them 30 years back into the past and have them disposed of by hit men, who they pay with bars of silver. Once these hit men (the loopers) live their lives for thirty years, the syndicate decides to dispose of them by sending them back to 2044, where they'll be disposed of, sometimes even by their younger selves.

It's explained that in the future bodies are 'tagged' so by sending them back in time, they cannot be traced. But why can't the syndicate send their victims in the present immediately back to 65 million B.C. where they would probably be immediately eaten by a dinosaur or other prehistoric animal, thus preventing the time-line from being tampered with? And by cutting out the middlemen (i.e. the loopers) in this way, the syndicate can keep all the profits for themselves.

Once we're introduced to the novelty of the how the looper scheme operates, the novelty soon wears off. We see Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) traveling to the cornfield and then performing executions one too many times. Finally, there's a plot twist: fellow looper Seth appears at Joe's apartment, explaining that his 30 year old self from the future appears in the cornfield and he's unable to finish the job. Abe, the enforcer from the future, forces Joe to betray Seth, who's tortured and his alter ego from the future is hunted down. You might ask what this has to do with time travel or science-fiction. Actually nothing--it's simply all action-thriller at this point in time in the script.

Soon, Joe finds himself in the same position as Seth. His 30 year old future self (Bruce Willis) appears but manages to prevent younger Joe from doing him in. In a rather derivative idea borrowed from the 'Terminator' series, Willis must dispose of a child who will one day grow up to be the 'Rainmaker', the sinister figure in the future who is now bent on eliminating all the loopers.

It might have been interesting had we seen what this Rainmaker character looked and acted like in the future, but that never occurs. We're asked to be content with meeting little Cid, our future Rainmaker, who has telekinetic powers coupled with a severe anger management problem. One is immediately reminded of Billy Mumy in the Season 3 Twilight Zone episode, ""It's a Good Life"", who plays a mutant who terrifies adults by 'wishing them away to the cornfield'. So the second half of 'Looper' feels much more like fantasy-horror vs. Sci-fi action thriller.

The meeting between the younger and older Joes in the diner is perhaps the most interesting scene in the film as it underscores the contrast between the more impulsive younger self with the more seasoned, experienced older one. Unfortunately, there is hardly any additional interaction between the two altar egos, with older Joe stalking off to blow away Abe and his crew of malevolent meanies. In true Bruce Willis fashion, the aging 'Die Hard' legend, is up to his old tricks, by machine-gunning most of the bad guys, sans Kid Blue, who appears out of nowhere on his flying motorcycle and immediately gets himself killed, instead of Joe, who is his intended target.

If the Looper second half feels a bit slower than the first, that's because director Rian Johnson spends a little too much time out on the farm, with Joe courting Sara (Emily Blunt). Although there's a feeling that we've seen this before, the ending proves to be passable as we finally have something to feel good about. Younger Joe sacrifices himself, preventing older Joe from killing Sara. He does this after he's able to foresee that Cid, growing up as the Rainmaker, will hold a perpetual grudge due to the murder of his mother and will take it out on all of humanity (including all the loopers) in the future.

Unfortunately, Joe's sacrifice, is not enough to make either young Joe or older Joe, likable. Younger Joe, before he takes his own life, is a criminal and a drug addict and older Joe, is responsible for murdering the second child on his list of three potential Rainmakers. In terms of a sympathetic protagonists, there's little to like here at all.

'Looper' is also unable to score points with its look at the dystopian future. One feels that one is simply viewing a second hand set from 'Robocop'--in that film, 'Old Detroit' looks remarkably similar to Looper's Kansas City of 2044 including the grimy 'futuristic' cars and emphasis on vagrancy as a national blight.

The performances in Looper are all acceptable, with an honorable mention going to little Pierce Gagnon as Cid, who manages to handle a number of complicated lines and take direction in a fashion way above his chronological age.

In the end, Looper proves only mildly interesting. While some of the action sequences are entertaining, the sci-fi premise is not developed into something clever enough to deserve all the the accolades that have been heaped upon it to date.",1348876800,10,5353,4.819172113289761
5646800,5,B00BLOKNVK,"Should we anthropomorphize the film INCEPTION the first thing it might well say is: ""LOOPER is the most intelligent and ba11sy sci-fi picture since, well, me."" And maybe it'll even observe: ""Doesn't Leonardo diCaprio hava a humongous head disproportionate to his body?"" (But that's probably me projecting.) I love time travel stories almost more than I love my dog. And if these same stories should come with the clever and the inventiveness and the sheer pizazz, then I love them more than my nana (who hates my dog). LOOPER thrills and provokes thought and, with its dizzying twists, compels you to stay alert. But perhaps the most remarkable bit is that while director/writer Rian Johnson demonstrates great flair in establishing the dystopian, near futuristic backdrop and, with it, the concept of time travel, he switches things up and grips you with character work. I wasn't expecting to be so drawn into the characters. LOOPER presents a cast in its finest form.

The year is 2044, and near-future Kansas has assumed a BLADERUNNERy urban aesthetic, if not exactly in visuals then at least in slick-grungy bleakness. It's a world in which 10% of the population has mutated into low-level telekinetics, able only to float a quarter, maybe make it spin around in the air if they're extra-gifted. The TKs are regarded as jokes, as walking social gaffes, but never mind. The head-boggling stuff launches with this premise: Thirty years from 2044, time travel will be invented but then promptly declared illegal. Except when did crooks ever toe the line? In the future's future, crime syndicates apply time travel to dispose of their dirty laundry, of their unfinished business. Victims targeted for execution are sent back to the past, cuffed and bagged over their head, bar of silver affixed upon their person. Back in 2044 contracted trigger men called ""loopers"" arrive at an assigned place and time. When the victim manifests from thin air, the looper mows him down with a primitive blunderbuss. The silver is payment for services rendered. And Joe Simmons (Gordon-Levitt), ice water and apathy and strange pharmaceuticals running in his veins, has amassed quite a pile of silver.

When the crime syndicate wants to terminate a looper's contract, it sends the older version of that looper thirty years back in time, gold bars strapped to him, to be killed by his younger self, and this is called ""closing the loop."" The gold is the younger self's retirement fee. So imagine the existential angst that comes with knowing that you've murdered yourself and that your time on earth has a known expiration date. Every looper dreads the coming day when he'll have to eliminate himself. And when Joe Simmons at last meets his older self, he hesitates just long enough for Old Joe to escape. The fit's now hit the shan.

From the moment Old Joe (Willis) appears, we're treated to his perspective as well. And it's mostly thru Old Joe's eyes that we learn of the Rainmaker, a shadowy crime lord in 2074 who's bent on eradicating all existing loopers, on closing all the loops. Rian Johnson layers in another plot thread that features a surprisingly tough Emily Blunt playing a weathered (yet very sexy) farm woman named Sara. Joe Simmons, the younger version, is now on the run from the mob because of his bungle. And even though Joe means to hunt down his older self and snuff him and so get back into the mob's good graces, he wanders into Sara's neck of the woods. Interesting stuff happens at the farm.

This is the best I've seen Bruce Willis in a while. Shows you how good he can be when he commits fully to a role. He refrains from exhibiting his patented swagger, his showy mannerisms. Going in, I had anticipated siding with Willis' character but I was startled to realize that I was rooting more for Gordon-Levitt's more stoic Joe. Old Joe remains sympathetic as he finds himself faced with having to make a terrible decision. Gordon-Levitt turns in another terrific performance. Grafted with a prosthetic nose and having screwed contacts in, he still only vaguely resembles Willis. But there's enough there in terms of familiar cadence and facial expressions that you don't mind going along with the intent. I can't not mention how very good Jeff Daniels is here. He plays a mobster sent from the future to preside over the syndicate's interests in 2044. Daniels steals more than his share of scenes, his facade of scruffy benevolence masking a sadistic, vindictive streak. Meanwhile, child actor Pierce Gagnon fleshes out Sara's troubled (and, frankly, kinda creepy) 10-year-old son Cid. Gagnon possesses a knack for putting on these terrifying scowls, and there were moments onscreen in which I half-expected Cid to whisk someone to the cornfield, if you get the Bill Mumy reference.

LOOPER is no sci-fi for dummies. It's a haunting high concept sci-fi thriller. It's got big brains and an audaciousness and unexpected emotional heft. It offers memorable scenes like the old looper's meeting his very grotesque end and the one in which Sara's ten-year-old exercises an apocalyptic tantrum. But my favorite scene is probably the diner conversation between Young and Old Joe, two distinct people divided by the measure of a dining table and thirty years of added living. LOOPER promotes debate. It dusts off old questions such as ""If you go back in time and come in contact with your younger self, will both of you implode?"" (no, you don't) or ""If you could, would you go back in time and kill H!tler when he was a baby?"" (...)",1348876800,2,5535,4.8965884861407245
