4081058,5,B0037BBKOY,"There is no better way to reveal absurdity than to subject it to the light of day and that is what this film does to the Jewish persecution complex and the industry of fear that supports it. And who better to do it than an Israeli Jew with a great sense of humor.

The freshness and honesty of this film made me laugh. The music, the pacing, the tone, the editing and the filmmaker's voice over all work together to perfection. It's done in a totally honest, mischievous, charming style that cuts through all the PC nonsense and shows you the truth:  the Israelis training their children to hate and fear anyone who is not Jewish, how the ADL rakes in 75M a year peddling Jewish fear and how the media fans the flames of fear to make a buck.

So far this film has been largely ignored. When that fails, those who fear truth will try defaming it, calling it names and attacking the filmmaker. I pray they fail. This rare film deserves to be seen and judged on its merits.",1275350400,13,970,4.318681318681318
4081059,5,B0037BBKOY,"A fascinating and thought provoking film which will certainly provoke discussions among Jews

As 40 year-old Israeli filmmaker Yoav Shamir says at the beginning of this 90-minute film (made in 2009), he is curious as to whether anti-Semitism  is on an upswing , or as he says, is even relevant in the 21st century in Israel, the US and other parts of the world. He sets out to find the answer getting incredible access to the leader and primary supporters of the Anti-Defamation League of the B'nei Brith, headquartered in New York. He is also given full access to follow a class of Israel high school kids who make one of the school's annual class trips to Poland to see first-hand the concentration camps from the Holocaust. Shamir tries to look at the issue from both sides and interviews the ADL's fiercest critics. In the end Shamir feels that too often the ADL and its supporters use the Holocaust to incite fear in the young Israeli students and through articles in papers in many countries in the world. But he never pontificates. He lets his camera tell the story.

Shamir visits a neighborhood in Brooklyn where African Americans live in the same blocks as Lubavitcher Jews (the more religious Orthodox branch). He asks questions that are rarely raised and gets honest replies from his interviewees. Many of these responses will surprise you. They did me.

This is a film that will probably be watched more by Jews than non-Jews and yet each will draw a different conclusion by watching it. Things are right or wrong or black and white. I know that a few scenes sparked some discussions I had with my fellow Jewish friends. They were healthy discussions.

The film is provocative but also well paced. And the subtitles (when they appear in the Israeli sequences) are easy to read.

First Run Features which is distributing this film is becoming known for releasing interesting - and often - controversial documentaries. This one fills both shoes and will give every viewer something to think about.

4081060,5,B0037BBKOY,"With humor, a klezmer-like soundtrack and a fast pace, this brutally honest documentary does a service to anyone concerned about thought police who ""monitor"" heretical speech and activism, as well as Judaic youth heavily burdened by their elders with a ""Gentile World Hates You"" paranoia (as demonstrated by the morbid and melodramatic scenes in Poland).

""Defamation"" derives its title from the access gained inside the New York headquarters of the ""Anti-Defamation League"" (ADL), a tyrannical Israeli-affiliated spy agency that is one of the major forces behind censorship and repression in the U.S. The  ADL has partnered with the US government and local American police departments in maintaining files on people they wish to silence and defame, such as Noam Chomsky, and this writer. In the past, those files were turned over to Israeli intelligence.

""Defamation"" represents an historic breakthrough in exposing Zionist and Talmudic supremacy, as it is maintained under a human rights facade of ""tracking hate"" --profiting from exaggeration while failing to investigate Orthodox rabbinic and Israeli bigotry. ""Defamation,"" produced and  narrated by Yoav Shamir, an Israeli, is a benefit to all Judaics of good will who earnestly desire peace, enlightenment and coexistence with non-Judaics. Shamir's intrepid journalism is an inspiration and helps to remind us that not all Israelis are committed to oppression and colonization.

The highlight of the movie, after the airing of the hubris of ADL director Abe Foxman, is the defiant scene with the eminent scholar Norman Finkelstein, although there are many sui generis characters in ""Defamation,"" including Mr. Shamir's own mother.",1271721600,29,1687,5.54863813229572
4081061,5,B0037BBKOY,"Yoav Shamir's interviews with Jews from different occupations present a range of opinions as to the nature and extent of anti-Semitism. Obviously, there is no monolithic definition of this term.

The viewer should realize that the question about criticism of Israel is multi-dimensional, even if one is going as far as anti-Zionism. There is no single motive for anti-Zionism. There are Jews, notably religious ones, who are anti-Zionists. On the other hand, there is no doubt that anti-Zionism is also a new home for anti-Semites.

Yoav Shamir interviews Norman Finkelstein as well as Abraham Foxman. The latter two exchange very sharp words. There are even comparisons to Hitler and Nazis. In fact, Jews in the past had attacked other Jews with such epithets.

Instead of emphasizing the ADL (Anti-Defamation League), and Israeli policies, as many other reviewers have done, I now mainly focus on other issues:

In Brooklyn, the opinions of Jews and African-Americans, about each other, are poles apart. Jews commonly believe that African-American assailants see Jews as defenseless, and so prefer to attack them instead of other African Americans. In contrast, African-Americans think that the police and court system favor Jews. Thus, it would be mistake to rob a Jew. Some African-Americans verbalize the opinion that the Jews control American institutions, and some even believe in the PROTOCOLS OF THE ELDERS OF ZION.

It is obvious that Israeli students visiting Poland had been inculcated with an unmistakable hostility to Poland. They had been taught, ""Everybody hates the Jews"". Poles sitting on a bench ask some girl students where are from, perhaps even China. The girls think they are being insulted, and a security guard escorts them away without explaining what the Poles had actually been asking. The Israeli teens are reluctant to go out in the evening because they believe that ""we might be attacked by neo-Nazis"".  They even imagine Nazi-like behavior among the Polish guards at the airport. In addition, the Israeli teens are very rowdy and undisciplined in the hotel, and a hotel worker has to remind them that there are other guests at the hotel, and that they should proceed to their rooms. [Is this behavior a form of teenage exuberance, or is it itself an expression of hostility towards Poland?] For more on the attitudes and conduct of Israeli teens visiting Poland as part of Holocaust education, please click on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Above-the-Death-Pits-Beneath-the-Flag-Youth-Voyages-to-Poland-and-the-Performance-of-Israeli-National-Identity/dp/184545569X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Above the Death Pits, Beneath the Flag: Youth Voyages to Poland and the Performance of Israeli National Identity</a>, and read the detailed Peczkis review.

Abraham Foxman, while in the Ukraine, urges Ukrainians to ""take responsibility for the past"". Yoav Shamir could have taken this further. Should the same standard not apply to the Jews relative to Ukrainians, Poles, etc.?

Foxman also entreats Ukrainians not to treat the Holodomor as ""You have your genocide. We have ours"". Is this supposed to imply that the Holocaust is somehow above the genocides of other peoples?",1386806400,5,3243,5.604081632653061
4081062,5,B0037BBKOY,"FIVE STARS! 'Defamation: Anti-Semitism the Movie' by fearlessly honest and down-to-earth Israeli film directory Yoav Shamir (2009), is truly one heck of an eye opening 21st century documentary! Not just Israel, but Pax Judaica is indoctrinating its children with shame, loathing and multigenerational vendetta (I went on this exact same tour as well under the same pretext), creating future generations of cooing extremists, anti-Gentile racists, tribal bigots and dirty rotten haters (as you can clearly see during the labor camp indoctrination tours).

After watching this documentary, I realized that all the rumors I heard over the decades about the Jewish Racial Supremacist ADL, are indeed true. The Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith was born October 20th, 1913 -- created by B'nai B'rith in the immediate aftermath of Atlanta B'nai B'rith president (1912-1914) Leo Frank (1884-1915), getting convicted (August 25, 1913) for sadistically raping & strangling a 13-year old Christian girl named Mary Phagan (April 26, 1913) -- appearing in fact to be nothing more than a slimy pressure group of sophisticated ethnocentric Jewish racists, paranoiac Zionist zealots, and deeply prejudiced anti-Gentile bigots pretending to be left-wing civil rights advocates in the West and actually right-wing shills for the pariah state.

For nearly one hundred years and counting, ADL thrives on spreading Jewish racial agitation amongst Jews, fear-mongering, and promoting egalitarian cultural anarchy for Western Civilization by exaggerating Anti-Semitism as a racist canard against non-Jews, all the whilst lavishly lining its coffers and watching its assets slowly climb in value toward billions of dollars. The ADL can be described as fostering a world view with one set of morality for the Gentiles as ""the other"" (the evil outgroup) and another for Jews (the noble ingroup). ""Everyone like us is ""we"" and everyone not like us is ""they"", that should be the slogan of the ADL.

Is the New Anti-Semitism One Big Ugly Global Luxury Business?

The Anti-Semitism Lobby has found itself a profoundly lucrative racket bullying non-Jews and fostering mental illness in Jews by perpetuating an eternal sense of pathological cultural victimhood. The fifty million dollar annual budget of the ADL partly funded by tax payers and a closer look at how this money is specifically spent speaks volumes.  Working within the upper echelon of the ADL hierarchy it must be nice to see all those extravagant $300K+ and other six figure salaries payed out to its fatcat executives who thrive on fabricating a litany of conspiratorial crises. Even the paper shuffling staffers get to fly all over the world like natty mack daddies, while wining and dining for free at the ""Non Profits"" expense on ever growing 100M$ bank accounts. How lovely it must be to enjoy the lavish hospitality of host countries that ingratiate themselves (like the Ukraine and many untold others) and enjoying the privilege of directly tell various national leaders and prominent government groups that they should not compare their own genocides and tragedies with ours, because our Holocaust was more unique than your Holocaust! Our Holocaust is bigger than your Holocaust, nanny-nanny-poo-poo. What other disgusting organization pretending to be a civil rights group would try pressuring the U.S. Congress not to recognize the Armenian genocide?

So when all the mountebank ethno-religious ugliness is distilled down, the strategy of Anti-Semitism Lobby pressure groups like ADL, SPLC, AJC, AJF, AIPAC and all the rest of the initialed organizations that are really nothing more than hypocrite liars promoting leftwing extremism for the West and rightwing extremism for Israel are their circus sideshows on world tour, coming to a country near you, travelling around the globe in epicurean style. ""Mums the word"" and covering up the bullying, bigotry, racism, extremism, Apartheid, crimes against humanity, war crimes and xenophobia of Israel, perpetuated for more than 60 years, is done with almost perfect silence and lying by omission. Huzzahs for the long time ADL director Abraham Foxman (more than 50 years of service) and Anti-Defamation League celebrating 100 years of perfidious excellence, for betraying its own stated purpose and through spreading fear, suppressing the genuine criticism of Jews and Israel. By relentlessly perpetuating a climate of financial ruin against anyone making criticism of Jews and smearing such people as anti-Semites (or self-hating Jews) the ADL achieves its highest standard of moral hypocrisy and un-American values.

Many Candid Interviews:

I very much enjoyed the uncensored interviews during the course of this film, especially the one with the morbidly obese gentleman with the British accent, discussing issues about how biased and extreme these Jewish conferences are in reality, which are essentially: expensively catered hawkish events organized by the umbrella Anti-Semitism and Jewish Lobby, that has so many different names, AJC, AIPAC, ADL, SPLC, JDL and the rest of the alphabet soup that's in cahoots. It's truly sad how these groups have enabled an army of spineless cowards who troll the Internet and public landscape smearing people as anti-Semites or self-hating Jews who wish for their to be real dialogue, not self-serving monologue about Jewish issues.

I give this film two big fat thumbs up and rate it a FIVE STAR BUY! This documentary should be shown every year in June to every highschool senior in the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe, to prepare them for what's in store when they matriculate into the propaganda machine known as college. University students should buy this DVD and organize screenings (with permission of the film producer) at their local institutions of higher learning, so they can understand why all their professors are poisoning their minds with tribal egomaniac propaganda, pathological lies, agitprop, regression and why history is constantly being re-written by effete narcissistic myopic cockalorum social justice warriors.

I encourage you to hit the buy button NOW and get this poignant documentary sent to you right away, I promise you won't be disappointed at how hard hitting and brutally honest this film is...... purchase your copy today.",1367452800,5,6311,5.4240570846075435
4081063,5,B0037BBKOY,"An irreverent look at a sacred cow, that cow being the seemingly righteous campaign against anti-Semitism, which Yoav Shamir convincingly shows to be based on a great deal of self-serving hype. Much enhanced by the movie-maker's sense of humor. If you think anti-Semites lurk behind every door and only the $50-million-a-year Anti-Defamation League is keeping them at bay, avoid this film. Otherwise, enjoy.",1365465600,3,407,5.476190476190476
4081064,5,B0037BBKOY,"In the paranoid and politically manipulative world of Jewish-Goy relations, this movie opens the shutters to the fresh air of clearer perceptions and unclouded thinking.  As other reviewers, and the film itself, points out claims of antisemitism are greatly exaggerated, often it seems, cynically so.

There appear to be two phenomena happening that are falsely attributed to this perceived ""hatred of Jews"".  First appears to be confirmation bias, in which those who have no ulterior motive perceive neutral, even positive, events as being threatening to Jews, because the perceivers have been conditioned to expect antisemitism. This is disturbingly illustrated by the pilgrimage of some Israeli high school students to a former Nazi concentration camp, cum Holocaust Museum.  In preparation for the final tour of the death chambers, the chaperon / tour guide pounds the half-truths of the Holocaust into the minds of these naive students.  By the time they finish the tour of the death camp, they are legitimately moved to tears, wondering how anyone could have so coldly murdered people simply because of their Jewish identity.

What is not shown, or discussed in the film, and very likely not by the tour guide either, is the role played by leading Zionists of the Nazi era, in collaborating with the Third Reich, and in condemning their co-religionists to certain death and dehumanization.  But this omission is understandable, since very few people are aware of this Zionist betrayal of European Jewry, (but is well documented online and in books).

While it doesn't take Jewish blood or identity to feel grief and horror at the atrocities of the Holocaust or true antisemitism, the fact that these students are now conditioned to filter future events in their lives through this distorting lens of conditioned fear and suspicion.  This is the other form of false antisemitism - the cynical misuse of history, psychological conditioning, misattribution and outright propaganda.  This is the tact taken by political organs and operatives such as ADL and the state of Israel.  Thankfully, the film interviews people such as Professor Norman Finkelstein, and even the director's mother to unmask the deception perpetrated on those who are prone to knee-jerk political correctness and thoughtless susceptibility to dishonorable manipulation.

In the end, I feel a greater degree of sorrow and sympathy for all of the Jews and Gentiles who conflate principled criticism of Zionists, Israel, or individuals (who happen to be Jewish); with thoughtless, unenlightened antisemitism.  In other works, Finkelstein warns that illegitimate denigration of the former will inevitably result in a dilution and delegitimization of the other.  At the same time, I feel a greater resentment and antipathy to any who would carelessly or abusively smear others as ""anti-Semites"" or ""self-hating Jews"" simply because they have the integrity and the audacity to think for themselves, irrespective of political correctness or convention.",1341792000,3,3020,5.397872340425532
4081065,4,B0037BBKOY,"An ISRAELI journalist confronts the idea that criticism of Israel equals anti-Semitism.  He is emotionally involved, of course, yet he can still present two sides of a story.  As I personally appreciate books and films in which people cross lines drawn by culture, politics, religion, and viewpoint, I think this was good.

There is a very controversial issue here, besides the question as to how much anti-Semitism really exists today, especially in the United States.  How far should Israelis and Jews go with their knowledge of the Holocaust?  I was first alerted to this problem while reading Tom Segev's ""The Seventh Million"".  Israeli military officers fly out to visit Auschwitz, and Israeli schoolchildren also visit the site.  Should Jews and Israelis (notice that not all Jews are Israelis, and by the way, not all Israelis are Jews) keep bringing up the Holocaust?  I felt at the end, when the high school kids were crying, that perhaps they had been forced into some sort of catharsis needed by older people, by Holocaust survivors.  Should these children have had this experience forced upon them?  Yes, we need to remember.  But can Israelis think clearly when the Holocaust is their explanation or excuse for what some consider poor treatment of Palestinian Arabs?  It's worth thinking about, and this movie gives us material to help us do so.

I did not give it five stars as it did not really seek a balanced view of several sides to a multi-faceted issue, but concentrated on two sides, especially as given by two men other than the journalist.  Had it not presented more than one side of an issue, I would have given it three.

There really is much more anti-Semitism than this movie claims. But Jewish people even differ in their opinions here, and this DVD is quite informative.",1309651200,2,1799,4.871710526315789

4081068,4,B0037BBKOY,"As a Jew born and raised in Israel, filmmaker Yoav Shamir claims never to have experienced anti-Semitism firsthand.  So off he goes to find some.  And what he does find often surprises him - and us.  Indeed, his remarkably provocative and nuanced film ""Defamation"" becomes more of an examination of the internecine warfare occurring amongst Jews themselves than of gentiles' attitudes towards Jews.

For instance, Shamir accompanies a group of Israeli youth on a trip to Poland, the goal of which is to help open the eyes of the youngsters to the realities of the Holocaust.  Yet, the kids have been so primed by their leaders to fear the worst from the local citizenry that they wind up seeing anti-Semitic attitudes where none may actually exist. And it is a testament to Shamir's commitment to the truth and his integrity as a documentarian that he allows such potentially controversial and meme-undermining scenes to remain in his film.  In a similar fashion, when he interviews a rabbi in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn - a neighborhood notorious for its long-running tension between Jews and African-Americans - the religious leader, much to Shamir's amazement, actually accuses the heads of the Anti-Defamation League of having professional motives for ascribing anti-Semitism to incidents and crimes where that may not in fact be a primary factor - or a factor at all.

If nothing else, Shamir provides a balanced view on his subject - though if anything he tends to give a somewhat more sympathetic hearing to the people in the Jewish community who take on organizations like the ADL for their more conservative views on anti-Semitism and the State of Israel.  For instance, Shamir interviews Norman Finklestein, a highly controversial Jewish professor at the DePaul University in Chicago, who argues that a certain part of the Jewish establishment makes ""cynical use of the Holocaust,"" and that whenever any policy or action performed by Israel is legitimately criticized, the underlying cause somehow always gets attributed to anti-Semitism - a condition he refers to as ""pathological narcissism.""  For giving voice to this viewpoint, Finklestein has been labeled a ""self-hating Jew,"" a ""Holocaust-denier"" (even though he lost his parents in concentration camps), and a ""madman.""  He eventually lost his position at the university - due to pressure from the Jewish lobby he claims - and was denied entrance into Israel on the grounds of being a potential ""security hazard.'

Abraham Foxman, the National Director of the ADL who gets interviewed extensively for the film, responds by saying that actual anti-Semites use criticism of Israel as an excuse to legitimately articulate their hatred of Jews - to give that hatred a patina of social respectability as it were.

Shamir lays out the conflict between the Jewish left and the Jewish right in the United States - the former calling for peace between Israel and the Palestinians and accusing the right of favoring Israel's interests over those of the United States, and the latter working to keep Israeli issues front and center in the national dialogue

And back and forth it goes.

Of course, this is not to in any way suggest that anti-Semitism doesn't exist in the world today or that Shamir never finds any evidence of it in his searching.  For instance, he investigates a case of rocks being thrown at a Brooklyn school bus filled with Jewish children and another instance of a knife-wielding man stabbing people in a Moscow synagogue.  Yet, interestingly, even many of the Jewish people involved with that latter incident pooh-pooh the idea that anti-Semitism was the cause and even go so far as to castigate Jews in general for using anti-Semitism as a convenient scapegoat for their own failures or misfortunes in life.

Although he doesn't seem to have started out with that intention, Shamir has produced an amazingly provocative and controversial work, one that is guaranteed to get tempers flaring and people talking on both sides of the issue.  And it's a much-needed eye-opener for anyone regardless of viewpoint.",1290988800,22,4098,5.091044776119403

Sometimes it is masked as religion, but it is still real and it is still anti-Semitism.

This film is definitely worth viewing. If nothing else, it shows you that the ADL should take a seriously long hard look at themselves.  I think they mean well, but they need to clean up their act.",1279152000,4,524,4.7555555555555555
4081070,4,B0037BBKOY,"An Israeli film that posits that people of the Hebrew pursuasion are exaggerating their fears of persecution -- either because of ignorance, irrational anxiety or for financial gain.

At one point, Finkelstein exclaims something along the lines of, ""Look around you, do you really think there's any danger of another holocaust?"" Of course, one can envision his late parents expressing similar incredulity while living in pre-World War II Europe.

While this film does support the producer's viewpoint, it isn't really that convincing given the total absence of interviews with right-wing groups and militias in the US and Europe. And, again, the producer didn't dare to go to Iran, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan or Somalia. I don't blame him.
