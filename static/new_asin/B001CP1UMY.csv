3515378,1,B001CP1UMY,"In a movie that ostensibly shows two brothers pushing themselves ""to the limit,"" you get to see a lot of failure, bickering, and no make-up sex! Nothing in this movie gets explained, not the route, not the technique, not who ANYBODY actually is! I'm a very enthusiastic rock climber, but the confusion and lackluster climbing scenes made this film incredibly boring.  I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, except maybe folks who get off on watching egocentric germans get pissy with each other.

P.S. They don't succeed at any goal they set for themselves!",1229472000,6,560,4.946808510638298

3515382,4,B001CP1UMY,"Thomas and Alexander Huber are top notch climbers - amazing abilities both of them. This ""movie/documentary"" is involving and well made. It is in German with English subtitles. That is not too annoying however takes it down a notch since I have to work at keeping up with the dialogue. My German is too rusty to follow fast jargon filled German any more. Been a long time since I was there for a while. At any rate these guys are funny and awesome - practicing a deadly sport well.

3515385,4,B001CP1UMY,"Four ENGAGING Stars. This award-winning documentary, ""To The Limit"", is ostensibly about the speed climbing attempt on the El Capitan ""The Nose"" route in Yosemite by the great climbing brothers, Thomas and Alexander Huber. But it is as much about the Huber brothers' personalities and motivations as about the climb, showing their close relationship, competitive nature, training, travels, and philosophy. An artful film, it is also full of beautiful vistas of El Capitan at various times of the day and from different distances.

The Huber brothers extensive preparation regimen, discussion of the philosophy, and  'pseudo' route climbing is shown. There is a training mishap where death is escaped ""by a hair's breadth"" that sets the attempt back as they go home to Germany, with even a trip to attempt a traverse of the Cerro Torre group in Patagonia. And finally, in the last 20 minutes, the grand attempt as the Huber brothers start the race for the speed record up El Cap's Nose route. This film is an incisive and interesting look at the climbing Huber brothers. Starring Thomas Huber, Alexander Huber, Dean S. Potter, and Chongo. A Pepe Marquant film. Very Definitely Recommended for climbing fans. Four ABSORBING Stars. (Lotus Films. Hager Moss Films. Quinte Films. Color. Spoken In German with English Closed Captioning.

3515401,4,B001CP1UMY,"El Capitan looks like a monster to climb. Climbing it solely with the intent of setting a new speed record seems almost heretical. The German Huber brothers are interesting, but the subtitling makes it a little hard to really understand their personalities and the twists in their relationship...They  appear to be speed-driven, highly motivated hippies. A little hard to fathom. The climbing scenes are breathtakingly beautiful but the push for speed seems overly dramatic, almost a distraction from the significance of climbing such a magnificent rock face.",1458000000,,559,5.425287356321839

3515404,5,B001CP1UMY,"I loved this movie because of the Huber bro's and the crazy homeless Sage on a tightrope. My best friend is Dutch and man, what endurance she has! The Huber brothers are so relate-able because they are laid back but at the same time, supreme athlete's with the normal brother rivalries. You can tell the extreme love that each has for the other. For me, the long haired tattooed type has been the norm, all of my life, and my son is planning a Mt. climb in Oregon. (over my dead body)... I liked the way, after Alexander had his fall and hurt his feet, they are rolling along, counting their blessings and Alexander says ""it's a good thing I'm so physically fit, or it could have been much worse (while he's smoking a cigarette). lol. The crazy sage guy on the tightrope looked so uber stoned in the beginning of the movie but he had a some very wise things to say. This movie was so enjoyable and the scenery breath taking. I think that rock face climbers are a community of crazies unto themselves. Supreme movie and the guys are major babes.",1456012800,,1044,4.38659793814433

3515407,4,B001CP1UMY,"I liked it. The scenery was spectacular and the camera work was first-rate. The person doing the filming deserves a star of his/her own.
Now: Somebody explain this competitive climbing to me. They worked as a pair, and one did the actual scary climbing without a rope, just him clinging to the rock. The other brother ran up the rope with a lever whosit, and he was all roped in, so he was actually pretty safe. He wouldn't fall far as he had most of the protection. Wouldn't the first brother who was just climbing the bare rock and putting in the anchors holding the other get the credit for the fast climb?
I'm clearly not a mountain climber. All the climbing I want to do is into bed after a long day, so temper your criticism please!
Thanks all.",1436227200,,750,4.364285714285714

3515409,4,B001CP1UMY,"I wish I knew more about rock climbing so I understood better what they were doing at each point in their attempt, BUT, like others have said, it was not about the actual climbing as much as it was about their determination.  I also enjoyed the fact that their outdoor interests are multi faceted and that we got to see some of that in the movie.",1422835200,,346,4.242424242424242

3515413,5,B001CP1UMY,"I had read the book to top of the world .  Iam afraid to say this I went to the same high school as he did . kids did not now how to approach him but the other hand they he was a great athlete . I especially wanted to say thanks  you to Erik. ,to prove the the school system wrong. My mother was a substitute teacher and head of substituting . She knew most if not all the kids it was a small high school everybody knew somebody . Anyway I was going to join the wresting team and the head of speacial Ed , did not think I was going to be any good . I use to see Eric at the wresting matches he was a inspiration to me but everyone else they wer just afraid to say it . Any way my mother knew he was big into mountain climbing when he was in the middle school if I got that right ,  when I saw the movie I was really touch to see his father with him and I know his mother was up there with him . It was nice to see him doing what he set out to do . To  show the special ed department that we can achieve,our goals if we put our heads to gether. I miss seeing his Black and Tan Shepard and his golden retriever by his. Side. I put a personal touch in there because he wasn't  just another climber he was a long time student that that tought  all of us there is no obicals,  just the ones you put them there your self . Rock on Eric !

Please see this movie anybody can do the unthinkable . This movie will move anybody especially people  with disablities.",1395273600,,1453,3.768976897689769

3515417,5,B001CP1UMY,"This is indeed not a film about climbing techniques. And there is no happy ending, at least not at the time when the scenes were shot. But the film tells a great story about nature, challenges in life, friendship and of course climbing. I have watched it now several times just because it brings one of the most impressive landscapes I have ever seen in my living room. The two Huber brothers also are both top of their class in high speed climbing and very charismatic. I can recommend the DVD to everyone, not only mountain addicts!",1329523200,,534,4.515463917525773
3515418,5,B001CP1UMY,"This is an excellent story about the determination to succeed at any and all cost.  This was never intended to be an instructional video about rock climbing which would have been extremely boring.  Instead this is a story about not giving up no matter the odds against you or how many times you fail.  As the film maker stated, he had no interest in making a film simply about climbing.  This is a film about rock climbing as a metaphor for life.  This movie is not meant for quitters.

P.S.  The brothers did not give up and eventually set the speed climbing record.",1239494400,11,567,4.446601941747573

8288531,5,B001CP1UMY,"This was a great documentary; as a climber I thoroughly enjoyed it. The footage was incredible, much of it makes you wonder how it was shot (how can they have a photographer there who is able to keep pace with some of the fastest speed climbers in the world?) My only minor complaint was that at times it was difficult to keep pace with the subtitles and at the same time watch the amazing climbing and take in the incredible vistas. Perhaps there could have been an English audio option?",1482019200,,488,4.433333333333334
