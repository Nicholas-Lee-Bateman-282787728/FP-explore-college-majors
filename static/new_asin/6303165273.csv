7840698,2,6303165273,I wanted to see Torvill & Dean perform but they did very little dancing in this vhs tape. Disappointed! Donated it to charity.,1274313600,,126,4.521739130434782
7840699,5,6303165273,"This video is a wonderful spectacle of skating, no doubt. Jayne and Chris along with the Russian All stars is just a perfect combination! Yeah, we ALWAYS want to see more of T&D,but the Russians were brilliant too. The tape has a great variety, including drama (Polovotsian dances), comedy, and just some great skating. T&D are wonderfulll as always!
If you are looking for high quality skating entertainment, with some superstars, this is your tape!",1039651200,14,450,5.013333333333334
7840700,5,6303165273,"Granted  that there is not enough of Jane and Chris on this video, the quality of the skating and the imagination (looks like Christopher's style of coreography) behind the routines is first rate, as is the Russian  skating and music. It is such a relief to find a video without any adds or  peppy, innane commentary by intrusive announcers. If you find a better  all-round skating tape, let me know! Why oh why do the British seemingly  refuse to let us have a full collection of Torvill and Dean's competitive  performances starting back in 1984? Only Babalonia and Gardner (are you  listening, ABC?) in pairs matched them in their last world-championship  performance (inexplicably submerged by an olympic disaster a month later).",944870400,15,733,5.0
