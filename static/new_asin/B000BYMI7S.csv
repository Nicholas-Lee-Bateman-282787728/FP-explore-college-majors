It's not just the fact that Pamela Anderson is one of the sexiest women I have ever seen, but also the fact that THIS is what a Celebrity Roast was and is meant to be: PURE RAUNCH! Some of the ""dirtiest"" humor you will ever hear outside of premium cable(HBO, Cinemax, etc.) can be found on this Comedy Central(basic cable) CLASSIC! Gorgeous girls, 80's metal LEGEND from Motley Crue Tommy Lee, and many more stars that will do and day things on stage that I can't print here due to obscenity(that's an understatement!).

2447113,4,B000BYMI7S,"Wow, they really tore her a new one. Inarguably, you can bag on Pamela Anderson for a lot of things. But never let it be said that she can't take a joke, and that she didn't react with grace in her own roast. Some of the crudest, most cringe-inducing (and funniest!) slams were directed at her on this night from them usual suspects on the dais. Jeffrey Ross, Greg Giraldo, Nick DiPaolo, and Lisa Lampanelli are some of the obnoxious insult comics featured, and to say that their sets are tasteless is like saying that Lisa Lampanelli advocates desegregation. ""It played the cave in Batman Begins,"" one of them comments, and one guess as to what that was in reference to.

Jimmy Kimmel plays Roastmaster and does that wry thing he does. His being there also means that his girlfriend, Sarah Silverman, is along for the ride, and also his other girlfriend, Adam Corolla. Hugh Hefner makes a taped appearance and old playah gets to brag about Pamela's having exhibited her assets in his magazine for a record eleven times. Tommy Lee performs live, and before you get all concerned, what I mean is that he sings a song (Turns out, ""Good Times"" is actually a pretty cool song). Tommy Lee's big willy gets almost as much abuse as Pamela Anderson's glorious bits.

Pamela's demented pal, Courtney Love, is just all over the place, and if she wasn't on something that night, then I was on something that night. Courtney Love makes Andy Dikc seem low key. But I laughed real hard at that one Kurt Cobain joke. Bea Arthur is also there, representing the era of Prohibition, serving as a counterpoint to Courtney Love. Bea Arthur is really old. Like Jeffrey Ross's jokes.",1292544000,,1661,4.64625850340136
2447114,5,B000BYMI7S,"Jimmy Kimmel serves as Roast Master, starting off with some obvious but hilarious comments about Pam's sweater puppies and cavernous women bits while taking quick shots at Tommy Lee's.

Greg Giraldo starts off by destroying Adam Carrolla, calling him Pete Sampras with Down Syndrome, saying his last name means ""one eyebrow"" in Italian.  Considering I nearly died when I saw him in person, he takes it pretty easy and turns in a pretty tame effort.

Following Giraldo is a recorded spot from Hugh Hefner.  Surrounded by the three women who would eventually join him on his own show - the beautiful Holly Madison, the fun Brigette Marquart, and the braindead Kendra Wilkinson - there is a pretty weak attempt at humor, but not much more can be expected from someone as drained and cadaverous as Hefner.

Nick Dipaolo only gets one really good shot off on the dais, following comments Jeffery Ross made previously insinuating that Bea Arthur might have a penis.  When he gets to Pam, however, he kills it.  Commenting on her body, life, and career, there is non-stop laughter.  My favorite joke was when he said he'd ""released"" so many times on pictures of her face that he thought he'd only recognize her if she had just eaten a glazed doughnut.  Brilliant.

Bea Arthur deadpans straight from a book unbelievably written by Pamela Anderson.  It's a bit dry, and very slow, but eventually the ridiculousness of it, and the atrocious writing, makes it pretty funny.  Arthur doesn't break her tone or delivery once, and it accentuates the preposterousness of it all (especially when she discusses the portion of the book regarding backdoor).

Of course, Jeffery Ross comes on in a full length fur coat and absolutely kills.  He is the Roast Master king right now.  I won't go into much of his act, but he makes a good joke regarding PETA and Pam's consistent beaver torture.  Saving the best for last, he absolute butchers Courtney Love, who looks more and more stoned as the night goes on.

Rounding out the headliners is Lisa Lampanelli.  She may well be the yin to Jeffery Ross' yang.  Nicknamed ""The Queen of Mean,"" the roast format is perfect for her brand of comedy.

Aside from Sarah Silverman, who is funny but not awesome, the rest of the cast is fairly snooze-worthy:
1) Andy Dick slowed down the action so much he caused a few comas.
2) Tommy Lee gave a ""musical"" performance that Courtney Love probably even scoffed at, and his ""comedy"" made Andy Dick look like a headliner.
3) Courtney Love was given the microphone - big mistake - and proved that she was far from clean OR sober.

This is my favorite roast of all time.  Tons of laughs inside.",1269734400,,2653,4.709327548806941
2447115,4,B000BYMI7S,"I enjoy these Comedy Central Roast, even though I could careless about half the people they roast. The Pamela Anderson Roast is uncensored but one joke was censored and it's not even that bad. It says extended but it's not the entire Roast for some reason. I would rather see Comedy Central release the entire Roast rather then bits and pieces of stuff you didn't see on tv.

And finally Pam takes the podium and acknowledges that her top may just be a little racy.

2447124,5,B000BYMI7S,"This is a really raunchy roast.  Now, let's be honest, should that surprise anyone?  Pam must be pretty tough skinned to take all the abuse, some of the ""jokes"" will make you squirm in your seat... did they just say that? But once you see Pam's face, you know it is okay to laugh.  Among my favs were Lisa Lampinelli, Courtney Love, and Sarah Silverman (I think that is her name).  Mean? yes, but for a ""good cause"" if you are into that kind of thing, right?

I think part of the fun is that alot of the roasters not only go after Pam but they go after everyone else as well... and who could pass up the opportunity to hear Bea Arthur read soft porn written by Pam?  She is so cool!

If you are looking for a roast full of harmless giggles, look elsewhere.  This is not politically correct by any means, but sometimes it is good to just laugh at all the things you have to concentrate on not laughing at even when you want to!

Not for the faint hearted.",1152835200,3,954,4.141304347826087
2447125,5,B000BYMI7S,"The humor may not be for everyone, but we thought it was absolutely hilarious!  It really isn't a Pamela Anderson roast - the comedians are relentless in bagging on each other with no shortage of jokes about Andy Dick.  And with Tommy Lee in company, there's plenty of talk about the infamous videotape.  Don't miss out on Lisa Lampanelli's bit - she'll have you in tears in no time!

This Pamela Roast is a heap of disgusting comments, words and images DEFINATELY going somewhere - to your funnybone - because it is applied with wit! I don't want to spoil your fun by quoting jokes from the show, but let me just give you an example. Referring to the sextape of Pamela and Tommy, one of the roasters said :"" I have not seen a p***y take such a pounding since Clay Aitken lost to Ruben Stuttard"". I thought this was a hilarious ROAST, and I regularly show it to friends who then fall about laughing. I also thought Pamela handled it with grace and style, and I admire her immensely for that!

Uncensored, my wife and I stumbled across this on the night it first aired on Comedy Central and were shocked at the terrible things they were saying on regular TV.  Awesome.  Definitely not for the squeamish or the prude.  This is No Holds Barred brutality in the form of a Celebrity Roast on Pam Anderson.  Nothing his sacred from her breasts to her sleazy ways to her ex-husband's (Tommy Lee) endowments.  Andy Dick gropes her.  Courtney Love flounders around like the cheap, drug-riddled slut that she is.  Jimmy Kimmel, Adam Carolla, Sarah Silverman and a host of other including Tommy Lee himself throw comedic stones at Pam Anderson (and Courtney Love & Bea Arthur as well) all in the name of good clean fun.  The results are hilarious.  Uncensored, as I said, and brutal.  This is great stuff.  You want to watch someone sit there and take every cheap shot in the world and still have the balls to laugh it up and make fun of herself in the end, this is it.  Pamela Anderson handles herself like a pro.  Like I said, you don't have to like Pam Anderson, hell, it would be even better if you couldn't stand her, you will love this.

2447129,3,B000BYMI7S,"Comedy's ""finest"" take a crack at America's hottest mom during the outrageous ""Comedy Central Roast of Pamela Anderson."" I put ""finest"" in quotation marks because I don't actually consider people like Courtney Love (who just keeps getting worse as the show progresses), Tommy Lee, and Andy Dick to be Comedy's finest. There are some talented comedians here, like Sarah Silverman, Eddie Griffin, and Greg Giraldo, but the rest do not really need to be here. Most of them just think of the most disgusting and ridiculous things to say in order to get a laugh. Most of the comedy is not really that structured (half of the comedians make fun of Courtney Love. I thought it was a roast of her instead of Anderson). Don't get me wrong, there are some really funny moments, but they come from the talented comedians rather than the others.  Where are great comedians like Lewis Black, or Richard Jeni?  I would certainly think that they would have something funny, a bit more structured, and still distasteful to say about Pam Anderson.  Why include such morons like Andy Dick and Courtney Love, who are only there because they can't get on any other televison shows?  This could have been much funnier than it, in all actuality, really was.  The roast of Pam Anderson is not the best roast (watch some of the Friar's Club roasts or the Comedy Central Roast of Jeff Foxworthy), but it does have its moments. Some of the more talented comedians have really good jokes, whereas others like Andy Dick just make idiots of themselves.",1143158400,2,1523,4.753787878787879
2447130,4,B000BYMI7S,The funniest night Comedy Central has put out in a while.  I highly recommend it!,1142899200,5,81,4.4
2447131,5,B000BYMI7S,"Believe the hype. The Comedy Central Roast of Pamela Anderson (Uncensored!) is the filthiest, funniest roast I've seen in a long, long time. Think in terms of those classic Dean Martin roasts of the 1970's - only MUCH, MUCH dirtier. Comedian Greg Giraldo says something about comedienne (and host Jimmy Kimmel's girlfriend) Sarah Silverman that has to rank as the most vile, the most shocking , the most disgusting thing I have ever heard one human being say about another in my entire life and no I can't write it down here because if amazon printed it they'd go out of business. No, you've never heard of Greg Giraldo before. Neither have I. That's basically what this roast is: a bunch of B-list comedians stepping up to the podium and taking shots one after another at Pam and at each other. But don't get the wrong idea: these B-listers exceeded themselves. Indeed, I have a feeling that once this DVD becomes more widely known some of them will move up to the A-list. The guest list includes host Jimmy Kimmel, Kimmel's girlfriend, comedienne Sarah Silverman, Kimmel's former ""Man Show"" co-host Adam Carolla (who gets in a good shot at Silverman: ""Gee Sarah, it must be difficult faking the orgasms AND the laughter in the same relationship.""), Andy Dick, Eddie Griffin, Pammie's former husband and sex tape co-star, rocker Tommy Lee, David Spade, Bea Arthur and Courtney Love-Cobain among others. The whole thing is wild: Andy Dick gropes Pam's breasts, Courtney Love is a human train wreck, Bea Arthur reads aloud dirty passages from Pam's howlingly awful book ""Starstruck"" - and with a straight face. I counted maybe 50 jokes about Pam's vagina when two or three would have sufficed (""It played the cave in the last Batman movie"", ""Is it true that they give donkey rides to the bottom?"") Pam takes it all in stride. Bottom line: this thing is funny, at times screamingly funny, from beginning to end. The Comedy Central Roast of Pamela Anderson (Uncensored!) is a classic - a filthy, disgusting classic, but a classic nevertheless.",1141344000,5,2040,4.848137535816619
2447132,5,B000BYMI7S,"The latest roasts on comedy central have been funny, but not memorable enough for a second viewing. Well Comedy Central has found a way to change that with the roast of Pamela Anderson. Oh Pamela you gorgeous Baywatch babe, she takes hits like I've never seen before on live television. And now with the release of this dvd you get to see the whole thing uncensored! Oh comedy central, you shouldn't have.

If you think you've seen a roast before .. you haven't seen anything yet. The Roast of Pamela Anderson had me rolling in the aisles the first time I saw it on Comedy Central a couple months ago. And as many times as they re-ran it, I tell you I couldn't get enough. Let me just mention some of the goodies found here: First and foremost Pamela, in a classy see through getup, handles herself oddly enough with class, dignity, and a smile. She is one heck of a lady. But its the guests that are the highlight. Lets first start with Courtney Love, a personal hero of mine! Courtney was detained shortly after this performance and sent into rehab, so its quite a laugh to hear her boast here of how she has been clean and sober for a year! Clean and sober she is not, funny as hell she is. She is the scene stealer here, and the other comedians take more joy out of poking fun at her than even Pamela at some points. All of which are hillarious, and watching Courtney react and flail and fall about, is certainly something that needs to be re-watched over and over again. We get Bea Arthur reading excerpts from Pamela's book. Can you say brilliant? Who woulda known Bea Arthur would come out of hiding to roast our lady of the hour? She delivers the double-whammy when she reads aloud one of the ""sexiest"" scenesof the book. We have the always hillarious Sarah Silverman doing what she does best. She has had one hell of a year what with her movie ""Jesus is Magic"" her cameo in ""Rent"" her part in ""The Aristocrats"" and showing up at many roasts. Here she does herself proud poking fun at Pam, Courtney, and her boyfriend Jimmy Kimmel to name a few. Andy Dick takes a feel of Pammy's assets, and confuses an audience again with his sexuality. Tommy Lee is on hand. Which is great because he and Pam are like the couple never meant to be together, but somehow you just root for them. Although they aren't together as of the taping, it is cute to watch them take jabs at each other. The self proclaimed ""Queen of Mean"" Lisa Lampanelli delivers perhaps the funniest bits near the end before Pam herself gets her revenge.

Pam sat through the hell of a roast all for charity, PETA of course, which she is known to support avidly. (even protesting at KFC's .. she is quite devoted, and I think she should be commended for it). So with the cast of Jimmy Kimmel, Tommy Lee, Adam Carolla, Eddie Griffin, Sarah Silverman, Jeffrey Ross, Nick Dipaolo, Andy Dick, Greg Giraldo, Bea Arthur, Elon Gold, Lisa Lampanelli, Lady Bunny, Courtney Love, even Anna Nicole Smith (in the audience) and of course Pamela herself, it is a star studded hillarious event.

And now you can own it and rewatch it over and over. Who wouldnt want to see Courtney Love take a pratfall right at the moment when Pam gets up to deliver her speech? And the dvd features a ton of bonus features which are equally as exciting. Theres footage from the rehearsal, theres outtakes from the show, theres stuff from the red carpet (hillarious), and more. So overall Im giving this 4 stars. It is the funniest thing you will find on dvd this month. So if you're in need of a laugh, or a fan of any of the comedians or musicians on the dvd, this is a must have. Check it out, you won't regret it.",1140134400,19,3653,4.400887573964497

If that didn't make you laugh, don't expect to be floored by this DVD. It's a bunch of mostly un-funny comedians making the same joke over and over about the washed up, artificial, corporate product named Pamela Anderson, only to in the end masturbate her inflated self-perception. Repetition can have marginal comedic value, but not in this case.

And if you need further convincing, some of the money this ""roast"" made went to PETA. Comedy Central, keepin' fascism alive.

8094296,2,B000BYMI7S,"I was really hoping this would be funnier than it actually turned out to be. A lot of the roasters kept joking about the same things over and over again. The infamous sex tape, PETA, Pam's acting, Pam's body, Tommy Lee's member, etc. Things got really old after a while.
Also, I didn't even know who most of the roasters were! I expected more star-power, and more laughs, since it was world famous Pam Anderson being roasted. But it seemed a bunch of nobodies were invited instead.

There were some jokes that made me laugh out loud, but not enough where I would ever need to watch this again.

Also, Courtney Love is on stage, flailing around, the entire time. It is so annoying and trashy.

I say skip it.

Hopefully the David Hasselhoff roast is much better.

UPDATE: The David Hasselhoff roast blew this one out of the water! Skip the Pam Anderson one and get the Hoff's instead!",1422316800,,883,4.49375
