8639146,5,B00I47RJNM,"Good documentary on a very controversial topic. I loved it. It kind of reminds me of the underground christian community, lol.. If there is one.. I guess this would be it. Raising the dead. Just some really incredible men of God going out there and doing what Jesus commissioned every christian to do.. Raise the dead, heal the sick, cleanse the lepers. The church is finally getting an understanding healing and actually applying it, so just think how cool it would be once everyone starts to grasp the concept of raising the dead. I have much respect for these guys. Awesome movie, I really enjoyed it. I'd love to see more on this topic.",1524441600,,640,4.62280701754386

8639151,2,B00I47RJNM,"Title of movie sets up the tone for supernatural encounter of miracles happening in our day.  The intentions I suppose were good.  As ""supernaturally active"" as claimed to be, there were times when I had to forward the ten seconds in hopes to get something more edifying.  Reason being, Christianity is a lifestyle of serving others --I heard a lot of ""I this"" and ""I that"".  This was a huge turnoff for me.  If I want to hear about these kind of voices.... I can call up a few who don't mind shining the spotlight on themselves and sneaking up a few bits and pieces about Jesus.  Don't get me wrong, I think the heart of the project was in the right place, just maybe in the wrong direction.  I get that they are attempting to get that part of the scriptures active in our society nowadays.",1458864000,,791,4.340136054421769
8639152,4,B00I47RJNM,The Good intentions are there. The audible testimonies are there. Yet because it is a movie I would of liked viewable testimonies. Other wise this is perfect in MP3 or audio format.,1419379200,,181,4.6875

8639154,1,B00I47RJNM,"If you are looking for a movie to build your faith about seeing modern day miracles and raising the dead, this is not the film for you. The trailer for this film sets you up to see something amazing but does not deliver. This film is very disjointed and confusing on what message it is trying to portray. Spoiler alert:  It does have a handful of great testimonies of God working through people to raise someone from the dead, but the majority of the film follows a team of ministry leaders (some of whom have seen the dead raised) wander aimlessly around numerous towns where they pray for people and see nothing of note happen. There are a lot of completely pointless scenes where the guys are just shooting the breeze about nothing at all. There is a long scene where some of the men go into a house and pray for a dead man for quite a long time; then the scene ends. They throw a random party and preach to an empty street and then pray for a couple people. It makes it look like God doesn't want to move.  Throw in a handful of deeply sorrowful stories about people not being healed or raised from the dead and you will leave wondering what the director is trying to say about God. Very disappointed.",1408838400,10,1205,4.327433628318584
