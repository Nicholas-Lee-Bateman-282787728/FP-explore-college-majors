I was surprised that it was still available for sale and was even more surprised at how quickly it arrived, only 5 days from the date of my order. Thank you for the excellent service!",1254268800,2,337,4.265625

8297495,5,B001EBMI0O,"First a note.  This item is a Region 2 DVD which will work with European DVD players or a non-regional DVD player ONLY.  It will not work with ""regular"" Region 1 (USA) DVD players.  So be sure that you have the correct DVD player.  This movie has not been released to USA DVD formats as of yet.

The movie is, in my opinion, the best Jerry Lewis movie due to several reasons.  It has a very cute and adorable storyline with Jerry taking care of triplet babies.  The movie does not tend to place the focus completely on Jerry alone since the babies are an important part of the movie.  Jerry does not copy many of his more familiar ""personalities"" that you tend to see in his other films (like the Nutty Professor persona).  The supporting cast played their parts excellently and there is much humor in the plot.  Connie Stevens got her big break in this movie and plays the love interest to Jerry.  Not to give too much away of the plot, Jerry is given the triplets to care for by a close friend of his.  He has to learn how to care of the babies while also trying to retain custody when other people question whether he is a suitable parent.  The movie's ending is very sweet and fits the theme perfectly.  The movie is in color which made it one of Jerry's first of that kind.  Despite the few allusions to out of wedlock pregnancy, it is still a good movie for the whole family.",1247529600,,1381,4.277992277992278
8297496,5,B001EBMI0O,"...right up there with ""The Disorderly Orderly"" and ""The Big Mouth""!  Very charming, crazy, funny, corny but loveable, and a fascinating period piece:  Was most likely considered controversial & daring in Hollywood  for it's time, concerning unwed mothers & wild drinking binges.",1247529600,,279,5.595238095238095
8297497,1,B001EBMI0O,"If you live in the USA, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM!  I made the mistake of not reading close enough, and found out after spending $20 something for a movie I cannot watch, and cannot return.  I love this movie, and had it in VHS format, but it was borrowed and never returned, so I wanted to replace it with DVD format.  Too bad for me...........the seller will not even respond to my e-mails.",1247097600,,392,4.27027027027027
