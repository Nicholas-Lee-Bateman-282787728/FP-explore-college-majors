It did not really cover any of his inventions and life, but instead spent most of the time on the discovery of THE METHOD or what could be his final treatise.  Was it a fraud? Who paid what for it? Blah blah, boring.

If you homeschool or are just interested in him, I strongly urge you to try this:  http://www.amazon.com/Archimedes-Science-Living-History-Library/dp/1883937124/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1302351699&sr=8-1 as we all really enjoyed it. Now this book, they should make into a move.",1302307200,,593,5.287234042553192
