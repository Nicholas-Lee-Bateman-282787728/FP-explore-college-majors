2460801,3,B000CEXF88,"I am a Roseanne fan since forever, through thick and thin, and really wanted to love this.  Though sometimes cute, it was just too cheesy in many respects.  The singing was often subpar (even for a kid vid) and the Roseanne close-ups too frequent and too close.  The Roseanne dressed as a little girl made me uncomfortable -- guess you just can't pull that off after a certain age.  ""Popcorn Poppin"" was a cute song and story, but the animation was not only cheesy, it was downright scary.  Also scary was the brown face makeup on the kids dressed as teddy bears in ""Teddy Bears' Picnic.""  And she REALLY should have left ""Three Little Birds"" alone.  On the positive side, I think my toddler liked it (seemed to hold his attention).  ""I'm Gonna Tell on You"" was pretty funny and clever - two puppet sisters arguing.  The Andrews Sisters-type number was also pretty good -- ""Let the Kids Boogie,"" and Roseanne and the girls look great in their 40's outfits/hair.  The animated ""Peanut Butter and Jelly Fish"" was clever and cute, too.  My favorite was ""Down on the Doughnut Farm"" -- just because of the concept and because it was quintessential Roseanne.  Also, those doughnuts looked seriously good!  (Suggestion: put your shoes on while watching it -- you'll be compelled to run out for doughnuts as soon as its over.)  I do hope the kiddies (and their grownups) like it more than I did.  I really did want this to be good.  I loved the motivation and intention behind it (quirky and for the kids), but for me, it simply missed the mark.  Sorry, Rosie.  :o(  Do consult with me on the next one though!  ;o)",1142640000,6,1606,4.548951048951049
2460802,5,B000CEXF88,Bought this DVD for my 4 year old niece's birthday. They played it during the entire birthday party! All the kids were dancing to Let the Kids Boogie - and it was so nice that the music was actually fun for the adults to listen to as well! Highly recommend this DVD for Kids!,1139788800,5,275,4.111111111111111
2460803,5,B000CEXF88,"I bought this DVD as a gift for an eight-year-old and decided to ""preview"" it first. I was very impressed.  The songs (most are original) are cute and catchy and deliver positive messages for children.  The visuals - some using animation, some using puppets and others using live action - are very colorful and creative.  Roseanne has a voice that is well-suited to this kind of project.  The sets and costumes in the live-action numbers are well-done and the variety of music styles (including an Andrews Sisters dance number using very talented kids and grownups) makes for fun viewing. I especially liked ""Let the Kids Boogie,"" ""Calling All Kids,"" ""I'm Gonna Tell On You"" and ""Don't Do It."" Having the choice of watching the DVD with or without singalong lyrics, for those old enough to read, is a good learning tool.  I am sure that youngsters will ""get the message"" while they are being thoroughly amused and entertained by Rockin' With Roseanne.",1139356800,11,951,4.845679012345679
8098418,5,B000CEXF88,"Bought this from a bin at Fleet Farm years ago. I had no idea Roseanne had made this kids DVD. This is awesome! I have no idea why she has not promoted it. Very fun, very clean, very silly, very goofy! My child, at the time, was potty training and doing a great job. I brought this video home which is lots of short creative videos in one. My child laughed so hard and loved it so much that she skipped the toilet and used the couch!!! She didn't want to get up because it was so funny!!! The couch has made it to the curbside of the road. I had to put this video away until her potty training was complete, because, yes, it happened more than one time!!! This is a very cute and fun video. Roseanne is entertaining in lots of ways! Of course this gets five stars!!!!! Toddlers can watch it, but also all ages of kids up to 12. However, adults, or any Roseanne fan, will get a kick out of it, too. If you never liked Roseanne, that won't matter, because you will like her now, or at least your kids will. Again, this should have five stars!!!! Creative fun for kids.",1484697600,,1066,4.1298076923076925

8098420,5,B000CEXF88,"So, I admit that when I checked this DVD out from the library for my 5 year old daughter, it was because I am a Roseanne fan & wanted to see it.  However, knowing Roseanne's style of humor, I also was a bit hesitant as I wasn't sure what type of humor she'd use for a children's video.  I happily found that I had no reason to be concerned!  And my granddaughter LOVED it!!!  It is a sing along video that can be watched with or without the lyrics, and includes both classics such as ""Three Little Birds"" and original songs.  As these catchy tunes are performed in a variety of styles including rock, county, blues, reggae, boogie-woogie, and jazz, it introduces children to a wide spectrum of music style in a very fun way.  My granddaughter enjoyed it so much that I've just purchased a copy from Amazon for her personal collection.  I highly recommend it to all families with young children!",1373760000,3,894,4.447852760736196

8098422,5,B000CEXF88,My daycare children love this dvd  they can't help but dance and sing along the favorite songs are The donut farm Let the kids boogie and of course no monsters aloud a side of Rosanne Barr I didn't expect this is my second copy,1317168000,2,227,4.159090909090909
8098423,4,B000CEXF88,"I think it is clever and catchy, kinda cheesy and Roseanne can looks ridiculisly funny. But my kids love it, my 18 month old just sits right down and watches it all the way through and my 5 year old just tells me about what she likes about the skit. Its for the kids man.",1295136000,,271,3.9454545454545453
8098424,5,B000CEXF88,i have a autistic grandchild and he loves this dvd. it has alot of bright colors and people moving around that really catches his eye. also when you have it to show the words to the songs at the bottom of the screen he likes to look at the words.,1256688000,2,246,3.94
8098425,1,B000CEXF88,"My husband bought this for $3 and I question if he overpaid.  The production  is pretty bad, the sound does not sync up with her or the puppets mouths.  It pains me to say, my 2 and 4 yr old actually do not mind it and have asked to watch it.  I had a sacrilegious moment at the end when she ""sings"" Marley's Three Little Birds.  It almost made me violent.  This is a good one to leave at Grandma's.",1197849600,,399,3.925
8098426,1,B000CEXF88,"My father-in-law bought this for my two girls (3 and 6) last Christmas and it is terrible.

Terrible songs, terrible singing, terrible everything.

Don't waste your money.",1166313600,,171,5.296296296296297
