8619583,4,B001570H64,"I ran into Lawrence (Larry) Jordans work in collections of avant-garde films and was delighted to discover that a whole collection of it was available. Most of the films in this collection, ranging in length from a few minutes to a little over an hour, are in the animation style that seems to be Jordans trademark: old line art/engravings, usually tinted, floating across or blending into one another against static background scenes (also engravings). They recall the collages of surrealist Max Ernst, who used similar engravings (not tinted), and the more recent animation work of Terry Gilliam for Monty Pythons Flying Circus (remember the giant foot?) and the artists of the animated Beatles film Yellow Submarine. Im not sure whether the latter two watched Jordan or vice versa, but there must have been some kind of close connection.

Most of the films are just whimsical, surrealist what will he think of next fun, often with an air of mythology (Greek statues, Renaissance figures, and Jordans pet lady with the flashing spherical head) crossed with Steampunk (moving mechanical contraptions, hot air balloons, figures with umbrellas and goggles, etc.). Some, however, are more thought-provoking, such as one in which Jordan uses animation to explain the various figures in Tibetan Buddhist art. My favorite film, which straddles both worlds, is Once Upon a Time, in which interiors of a French palace are haunted by a variety of fantastic creatures as well as phrases from Buddhist writings, spoken by a man and a woman in spooky-toned voice-over.

I was less impressed with Jordans live-action films, which occupy discs 2 and 4. Disc 2 features a long trilogy based on the poems of H.D. (Hilda Doolittle), an early-20th-century poet whose work I like, but I found the films (or rather the 10 minutes or so of the first film that I managed to watch), which seemed to consist of a nice-looking middle-aged woman wandering around Italy, very boring. The shorter films on disc 4 were more enjoyable, mostly of a scenic nature (my favorite was In a Summer Garden, which featured flowers, lots of very happy bees, and a lively black cat), but I still didn't find them as interesting as the animation.

I recommend this collection of Jordans work to anyone interested in avant-garde film, unusual animation styles, or Surrealism. Jordan has made a unique contribution to all these areas.",1473033600,,2391,5.032828282828283

8619585,2,B001570H64,"OK, I admit, I haven't watched all four discs. I just couldn't make myself, so I review #1 and 4, the ones I've watched.

#1: Boring. Think about those Monty Python animations that would come on for a few seconds between scenes, some inexplicable 19th century engraving pushed, pummeled, and prodded into some kind of stop animation. Now, reduce the action to one thingy moving, eliminate connection to real-world logic, and make it go on for ten or twenty minutes. As collage, I found each scene assembled with fine workmanship - not that I'm a fan of collage. Use of color, when present at all, I found crude, blatant, saturated, pure primary or secondary in all the ways that tire you of anything that speaks only in extremes and exaggerations.

#4: Full of color, full of natural, not cutout, images. Still, not enough for another mind to cling to. Largely beyond rational thought, and seemingly trying hard to be that way.

#4: Wow. so much to not like. The Bhuddism piece,
