1987155,5,B0001CM17W,"This is a great, great movie.  Tom Conti is superb.  Kelly McGillis is perfectly cast too.  A gem of a story.  I don't understand why this classic is not available on DVD.",1171152000,6,171,4.25
1987156,5,B0001CM17W,"I've been beating my chest about this seldom seen gem for years and nobody knows what I'm talking about! Tom Conti is outstanding in this and perfectly cast, Roberts Blossom, Lois Smith and of course, 1st seen, fresh & luminous Kelly McGillis is a treat! How I wish this charming yet odd piece would come out in DVD. My VHS copy is getting worn out!",1086393600,7,349,4.384615384615385
8010008,5,B0001CM17W,"I have been looking for this movie on DVD, I was in this movie and pregnant with my son,who now has his own child. I am making a memory book for her and wanted to add it to my book. I wish I could find one.",1383782400,,206,3.5

8010010,5,B0001CM17W,"I'm adding my say to this so that this little known gem of a movie gets more attention and hopefully gets a very very long overdue DVD release. This is the last movie on my ""must own on DVD"" list. The other one was ""No Surrender"", a British movie written by Alan Bleasdale with Bernard Hill and Ray McAnnally. Thankfully, it got a DVD release in 2011, so all I'm waiting for now is ""Rueben, Rueben"" and then my life is complete!

I don't want to repeat what everyone else has said on here - I agree with it all - but this movie really is a lost treasure. Tom Conti is astonishing as a drunk poet who has lost his way. Conti rightly won a Bafta for his performance and was nominated for an Oscar. It was a tough year to win that Oscar. He was up against Michael Caine for ""Educating Rita"" for one, who played....er....a drunk teacher who had lost his way. Another incredible performance and a beautiful movie.

As others have said, looking at the plethora of second-rate pap that is released on DVD these days, why is this forgotten? I can only imagine it's a distribution and/or copyright issue.

So, come on!!!! Someone pick up the rights and get this stunning piece of art released to a begging and grateful audience (all us on here for a start) and a wider audience who have yet to experience it.",1364947200,2,1299,4.337448559670782
8010011,5,B0001CM17W,"I don't know how I discovered this movie but I'm glad I did.

 I just came back from seeing The Dark Knight Rises  where Tom Conti played a small but memorable part, and started me remembering this movie.

Reuben Reuben became a part of my being for a very long time..",1342828800,,268,4.196078431372549
8010012,4,B0001CM17W,"I'm in agreement with everybody, why oh why isn't this film on DVD, the VHS copy I have is no good now, it is so odd that so many other stupid junk films are put to DVD yet good stories with intelligent acting are not...why is this so????

8010013,5,B0001CM17W,"This is a truly remarkable - nay, perhaps even a great - movie, yet for years and years I have been looking for it on DVD in vain! Why hasn't it been released as a DVD? It may be had as a VHS, used, but I'd prefer to have a DVD of it. Okay, enough of this complaint - I hope the reason for it shall be removed in time - not too long a time at that.

The movie itself always struck me (I first saw it many years ago on a premium channel) as being loosely based on Dylan Thomas's tour in America. A Scottish poet known for his drinking and way with the ladies, the hero of ""Reuben, Reuben"" follows in Thomas's footsteps. The movie is actually based on a Peter De Vries novel of the same name. The movie version is quite different in many ways, but its story is actually preferable to that of the novel's. It is well acted and funny in places, but also profound in parts and even tragic in the end - though not without a deep sense of irony.

I hope that all the complaints about its unavailability in DVD format are not falling on deaf ears, and soon we will be able to purchase copies of our own. I am certain I am not alone in this wish.",1302134400,,1137,3.960698689956332

8010015,5,B0001CM17W,I've been waiting for years for this film to be released on DVD - or even available as a download.  What is the holdup?,1262736000,,119,3.9583333333333335
8010016,5,B0001CM17W,"I am suprised that this movie has not made it's way to dvd. I used to own a vhs tape of this film (and a vhs player)with which I would watch this movie very much.

This is a great story of a poet and the life that he leads. Great Film!",1258502400,,235,3.607843137254902
8010017,5,B0001CM17W,"It really saddens me that with all the JUNK on the film market these days (including most of the so called ""comedies  which rely chiefly on sex nudity and cheap jokes) this film has never made it to dvd. In fact, it's  difficult to even track down a VHS copy. The acting, writing and everything else in this film shines (What ever happened to Tom Conti??)  If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and find a copy. It's definitely a treat worth seeing.",1235520000,3,455,4.329411764705882
