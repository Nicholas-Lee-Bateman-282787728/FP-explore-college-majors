7282223,3,B00ZGPZR9I,I like the actors and PG Wodehouse but was slightly disappointed in this movie. There just wasn't enough drama to hold my interest. It intrigued me enough to read about this period in the author's life.,1455667200,6,202,4.638888888888889
7282224,5,B00ZGPZR9I,This is a heartbreaking story about what happened to a writer who shared his wonderful sense of humor with the world.  I think he wrote the all time funniest dialog in the whackiest stories ever written.  He was a genius with words.,1455580800,4,232,4.5
7282225,5,B00ZGPZR9I,Very droll.,1454112000,,11,5.0
7282226,4,B00ZGPZR9I,"This movie was all about the UNFAIR treatment Wodehouse received, many years ago and the truth never came out while he was still alive.  How unfair was that.  The movie is good, the acting very good and one for everyones DVD collection",1453852800,9,235,4.571428571428571
7282227,4,B00ZGPZR9I,"This is a very surprising role for Tim Piggott-Smith to take on. He's a rather steely actor usually cast as a hard-case soldier, policeman, or the like, but he does a fine job here playing against type. Zoe Wanamaker as his loving but frequently exasperated wife is wonderful, too. It's hard to believe anyone interned in a German prison camp during World War II could be as much of an innocent as Wodehouse appears to have been, but he certainly paid the price for his naivete. This is far from the fizzy, airheaded ""Code of the Woosters""-type material one associates with Wodehouse, but nevertheless well worth viewing.",1452384000,4,621,4.813084112149533
7282228,5,B00ZGPZR9I,Excellent. If you enjoy P.G. Wodehouse's novels you will appreciate learning about the author. This movie reveals the truth about what happened to him during the war. I read a biography on Wodehouse and was pleased that this movie stayed true to the facts.,1448755200,19,256,4.840909090909091
7282229,5,B00ZGPZR9I,"Excellent little drama, well acted and produced.  Sad that such a nice man was so naive and suffered so much for it.",1447027200,2,116,4.2727272727272725
7282230,5,B00ZGPZR9I,Excellent video--great acting as can be expected from Tim Piggott-Smith. Sad story of man too innocent for his own good.,1445212800,4,120,5.05
7282231,4,B00ZGPZR9I,"Amazed after Wodehouse was interned by the Nazis that the British Govt turned around and accused him of being in sympathy with his former captors,all because he and some others were released due to their age! Since he's been dead since ~1975,I think the Brits owe his family an official apology. His daughter had died during routine surgery,he seemingly was put in the same category as Lord Haw Haw. Appalling!",1440979200,32,410,4.871428571428571
8720236,5,B00ZGPZR9I,Very good movie and well acted. Love Tim Pigott-Smith. Wodehouse was taken into custody by the Nazis and treated very well because he was a celebrity. He was used unwittingly to broadcast stories of the activities the prisoners were permitted to partake of in the camp.  After the war the English public castigated him to such an extent that he was never able to forgive them. Interesting for all Wodehouse fans.,1533340800,,412,4.802816901408451
8720237,3,B00ZGPZR9I,"This is a true story. II first read an article about his WWII troubles around the time of his death in the mid-late 70s. Then a scholarly book came out shortly after that, detailing the whole sordid mess. This movie was basically aligned with the facts.

This movie, while ""true,"" somehow just felt dead; dull and dim and limp. Wodehouse himself was also the same in person (I've seen filmed interviews, and he is NOT a public speaker!). Brilliant writer! Genius story-teller and social commentator! Crap conversationalist! That's just how it was.

So, maybe this movie is the best anyone could have done? And its shortcomings (his dullness and meandering, confused actions) are merely accurate reflections of the real man? In any event, this movie is wishy-washy, dull, and not particularly entertaining, which was tremendously disappointing considering the decades of sheer pleasure I (and millions of others) have derived from his literary work.",1518393600,,948,5.189542483660131
8720238,4,B00ZGPZR9I,A part of Wodehouse' life of which I was only vaguely aware. Worth the watch but pretty dry historical film.,1508889600,,108,4.45
8720239,4,B00ZGPZR9I,ACCEPTABLE,1504137600,,10,10.0
8720240,4,B00ZGPZR9I,"A condensed version of the days PG Wodehouse spent in two very different types of exile. The acting was splendid, even if the story was a little light.",1493769600,,151,4.428571428571429
8720241,5,B00ZGPZR9I,"Who doesn't like Wodehouse? Troglodytes, that's who. Got this as a gift for a friend, ended up reading it myself.",1480118400,,113,4.7
8720242,5,B00ZGPZR9I,Movie is very interesting and I enjoyed it. After having read his books I can somewhat see his inability to understand the reality of the situation he was in. Wonderful acting. Enjoyed it a great deal! It arrived quickly!!,1478304000,,222,4.717948717948718
8720243,5,B00ZGPZR9I,"Tim Piggot-Smith is wonderful as P.G. Wodehouse, interned during the war by the Nazis who used him for propaganda purposes.",1470096000,,123,5.2
8720244,3,B00ZGPZR9I,"Wodehouse, the famous writer of the Jeeves books, was accused of being a traitor because the Germans released him from a prison camp then  asked him to broadcast his experience. He wrote those broadcasts in the same lighthearted style of his novels. A huge mistake considering they were played to American audiences before America joined the war and the British were losing badly. The problem with this film is that it is as lighthearted as the broadcasts. There is no real depth to any of the characters or situation. He comes off as a simpleton and I don't believe that he was. He made a grave error in judgement but I don't buy that the writer of all those novels was that stupid.",1463788800,9,683,4.5528455284552845
8720245,4,B00ZGPZR9I,It was an interesting history period piece.,1456617600,,43,5.285714285714286
