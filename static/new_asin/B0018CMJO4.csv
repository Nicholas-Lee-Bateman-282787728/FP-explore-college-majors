All the reviews I've read on it ask WHY ISN'T IT ON DVD? So, mystery person make a lot of people happy this Christmas and release it. Gerald McRaney is one of the best actors in the business and his work needs to be recognized.

8269418,5,B0018CMJO4,"My family and I were huge fans of this show back in the day. The episode that sticks out in my mind, was I believe called ""the possible dream"", and involved the youngest daughter.
There was supposed to be a variety show and General Craig was going to do a silly stand  up act. Because of something that happened, he didn't and ended up singing""The Impossible dream"" to the little girl. I still get goose bumps thinking about it. Since I am an avid fan of musicals, I knew that Jon Cypher could sing but no one else in my family did. I happended to be in bed with the flu that night and had the  TV on low. When he started singing I could hear the family buzz, so I staggered out of bed, went downstairs and announced ""Yes he really can sing, cried a little and went back to bed. BRAVO!

8269419,5,B0018CMJO4,"We used to watch Major Dad when it first came out at the time my husband was in the Marine Corps.
He loved this show, McRaney is totally Marine, he walks and talks like one and I was amazed
to find out he never was in the service but he certainly has supported our troops in various
campaigns over the years.  His supporting cast was perfect too, only 4 seasons and it was gone :(
He is really great in Jericho too, we found the first season in a bargain
rack at the old Blockbusters and my husband thinks McRaney might not be an actual Marine but the man
would have been one in another life because he is just perfect in the roles he plays(even if its spotting
the fact that a group that walks into the town are not Marines).
Enjoy Major Dad with your family it has to be in DVD somewhere out there!!",1302393600,11,801,4.101910828025478
8269420,5,B0018CMJO4,Thank God I've been able to watch Major Dad on Hulu over the past two years.  But why can't I buy this on DVD by now!!! It's a Classic!!!,1282262400,18,137,3.7241379310344827
8269421,5,B0018CMJO4,"Major Dad (for those of you not around when it was being aired) is about a single Marine Major whose love for the Corps was equaled by nothing...until he met Polly (Shanna Reed) a widowed, shapely mother of 3 girls.  After just a few dates, the Major (Gerald McRaney) pops the question - which catches Polly unawares.  He's conservative and she's more liberal - which makes this ""match"" seem ludicrous.  The girls resent his stiff, rigid, disciplined demeanor and the Major is forced into giving the girls some ""say-so"" into the possibility of a marriage with a barrage of written questions he must answer.  After the inquisition, the couple decide to marry with-or-without the girls approval and they give-in (hesitantly).  Great family-fare with a great compliment of Marines characters supporting the show mostly from the General's Office (of which the Major is the General's Staff Secretary).  The General (John Cypher) is ""spot-on"" as a self-aggrandizing officer and a stickler for unimportant details, the Leutenant (Matt Mulhern) is a charming down-home Iowa boy from the farm, Sgt. James (Marlon Archey) is the kind and thoughtful supply genius, Gunnery Sgt. ""Gunny"" Bricker (Beverly Archer - you may remember her from Momma's Family) is a Marine's Marine.

My wife and I love it and if you have a distaste for the current bilge on TV, this one's for you.

They don't really make shows like this anymore because they've become rather raunchy and unnecessarily crude and vulgar.  Not so with Major Dad.  Why it hasn't come out on DVD yet is a mystery to me (hopefully soon).  It's thousands of times better that the lion's share of the bilge that's being pumped-out from most production companies.

The wedding episode has the Mills Brothers' famous and touching song, ""Nevertheless I'm in Love with you"", making it one of our favorites.  Major Smiley, a short-lived character in this episode, is very funny during the ""Terrorist attack Drill"" which occurs during the wedding in which he shouts, ""Come and get us, you wild-eyed pagan devils!""

The girls are also written into various plots and have some great lines and personalities: Elizabeth, 16 (Marisa Ryan), Robin, 11 (Nicole Dubuc), and Casey, 7 (Chelsea Hertford).

Love it, love it, love it!  We have some of these episodes on VHS which we've just about worn-out.  My dad doesn't like it because he was in the military for 26 years and thinks this show is a farce, so...if you've been in the military you may not like it.",1236297600,25,2487,4.911483253588517
