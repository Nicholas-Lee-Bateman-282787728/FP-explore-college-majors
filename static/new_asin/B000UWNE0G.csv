8215433,3,B000UWNE0G,This DVD is very interesting but unfortunatly it contains only the first 60 minutes of the 90 minutes debate. So don't expect to hear it live at it was broadcasted in 1984 with the final conclusions of both candidates. President Reagan is cut short in the middle of a sentence and that's the end of it. It is sad because otherwise it would have been perfect.,1287446400,,358,4.4393939393939394
8215434,4,B000UWNE0G,"Ronald Reagan won a landslide re-election victory in 1984 - 48 states - a record, second only to Richard Nixon's 49 state record re-election victory in 1972, after Nixon promised to end the Vietnam war.
Reagan did not win the 1984 election campaign by making any rash or bold promises, however - he won it by sheer popularity. One of the factors of this popularity, and there were many, was this debate; the second of two with Walter Mondale, the nominated Democratic opponent in the 1984 presidential election.
Reagan was easily the oldest president ever elected to office at the age of 69, in 1980. In 1984, when Reagan ran for re-election, he was 73, and the subject of his age came up regularly among the pundits and as an oft-discussed topic during the election campaign. Mondale was using this issue to the fullest possible extent, until this debate, at which point Reagan flatley ended the subject with a famous response to a reporter's query as to whether his age would interfere with important impromptu judgements.
Reagan's response: ""Not at all, Mr. Trewhitt and I want you to know that also I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent's youth and inexperience"".
The resulting resounding laughter in the audience from this remark is a memorable and cherished example of how Reagan could win a crowd. Even Mondale was caught completely off-guard and turned and laughed at Reagan, who remained totally deadpan.
This 60 minute debate will have you captivated from start to finish, and is a glimpse of the politics of the time that are so vividly remembered by so many that were there.",1207440000,,1656,4.7735191637630665
