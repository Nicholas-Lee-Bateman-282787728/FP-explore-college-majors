8721774,5,B010CACPPU,"I'm a huge Bowie Fan
At this point a fan still crying over the loss of the most  important, life changing influence, beautiful, creative minds of the world.  Best singer and songwriter and actor. I enjoyed every second",1461456000,,218,4.7105263157894735
8721775,5,B010CACPPU,"Being that I was at this concert, naturally I wanted to be able to replay it anytime I want to...And I want to",1458777600,,110,3.8260869565217392
8721776,3,B010CACPPU,Grainy fuzzy picture quality. A copy of a video...hope the seller didn't violate copyright law.,1457740800,,95,5.4
8721777,5,B010CACPPU,This video quality is not very good but the audio is pretty good. If you enjoyed him in the 90's like I did you will love this. I listen to it all the time in the background. This is his industrial period full swing with a couple nice old one thrown in.,1455494400,,253,3.8846153846153846
8721778,5,B010CACPPU,"A must have for a true fan, I was blown away by the whole production ",1454716800,,69,3.6
8721779,5,B010CACPPU,"Despite the quality of the video recording, this 2 hour plus (the package says it is only 60 minutes) is just great. The outstanding on stage performance comes when the legendary Lou Reed joins David to rock out 4 of Reed's best songs including ""I'm Waiting For The Man"", which both of them experienced as drug users. Awesome.",1454198400,,326,4.637931034482759
8721780,3,B010CACPPU,"The video quality is awful. It was recorded in 1997, so its super grainy.",1453939200,,73,4.285714285714286
8721781,5,B010CACPPU,"I have this concert on another format so my review here only pertains to the content of the show and not to the quality of this particular DVD.
This is one truly amazing show that totally gets me rocking every time that I see it. Bowie's performance is outstanding as he goes thru a selection of his latest music as well as a session of his timeless classics. There are numerous outstanding moments in this show, the best in my opinion is the duets with the King of Cool, Lou Reed. Bowie and Reed perform the classic ""Queen Bitch"" to total perfection and then they bring down the house with the Velvet Underground classic, ""White Light/ White Heat"". Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins and Bowie deliver a hard rock dose of euphoria on ""Jean Genie"" and the Thin White Duke brings his long time fans to tears with a heart rending version of ""Moon age Day Dream"".
All the numbers in this show are fantastic and Bowie has never sounded better.
if you're a fan of this true genius that impacted music in a way that changed it forever then do yourself a favor and purchase this so that you can see the great man at his best. Rock on Ziggy. There is no way of telling you how much you will be missed.",1453939200,,1196,4.32
8721782,1,B010CACPPU,"This is a poor quality bootleg, apparently transferred from VHS to DVD.  Save your money and watch it on youtube where the quality is (surprisingly) better than this copy.",1453852800,,171,4.896551724137931
8721783,5,B010CACPPU,"I was so sad when hearing of David Bowie passing away this month, January 2016, Immediately I went to Amazon, to find something unusual by him and I found it! As David himself says in this amazing music celebration of his 50th birthday, stick around, he promises not to bore. With Billy Corgan, Robert Smith et all, plus a group of amazing musicians, the intimate atmosphere, with costume changes onstage, amazing blown up images of faces, lying on their side at the edge of the stage & with past performances, light shows & stage furniture, complete with a white birthday cake appearing homemade, at the final end of all of the performance, I was turned on until the wee hours of the morning.",1453420800,4,693,4.642276422764228
