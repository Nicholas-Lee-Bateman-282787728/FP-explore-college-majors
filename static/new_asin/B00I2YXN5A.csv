6247900,3,B00I2YXN5A,"Another nostalgia buy -

First, l now see that as an adult, if Dennis were your neighbor, no court would convict you of any action you may have against him, provided you have this disc as evidence.

Second, you won't need more than one volume of this.  This disc literally contains 99 adventures of Dennis The Menace (33 episodes x 3 adventures per episode).  How could you possibly need more?

Third, there are some complaints here on the quality of the video on the episodes.  I distinctly remember the quality of the video as a kid being absolutely horrible when it originally aired in the 80's.  This was an extremely cheap, daily syndicated kids cartoon.  It wasn't until it became a Saturday morning cartoon on CBS that the animation quality improved.",1395532800,,757,4.7251908396946565
6247901,5,B00I2YXN5A,"Dennis the Menace, a classic cartoon series inspired directly from the classic Comic, is finally available on video thanks to Mill Creek Entertainment and DHX Media, with 33 1/2 hour episodes for a runtime of 8 hours and 7 minutes.

The Video Quality is good, but you can tell it's transferred directly from a Video Tape, as the colors, though varied and colorful, tend to bleed into each other slightly, as video is known to do, compared to a remastered and newly cleaned update as with other cartoon series. Even so, it's better to have this series as it was broadcast back in the 80's, than nothing at all.

The 33 episodes are split up into 3 discs, spindled neatly onto a patented new DVD disc design that locks in tight, one disc on top of the other (be careful and remove them one by one, pressing in on the center to avoid scratching or damage to the discs). About 11 episodes each disc and they look good considering that fact. Likely double layered DVDs. Also included are 3 bonus Umigo Music Videos, unrelated to this show.

If you're familiar with the comic or the live action black & white TV show from the 50's or so, you'll know the set up of each episode: Dennis visits his ""Greatest Friend in the whole wide world, Mr. Wilson!"" Much to the regret of Mr. Wilson, who usually ends up in the hospital after Dennis the Menace gets through with him, innocently unaware at the havoc and punishment he gives to poor Mr. Wilson. Thankfully, there is plenty of adventure and antics that take place all around the neighborhood, and not just in one location.

One of the Funniest episodes is when Dennis leaves his skateboard on the porch and Mr. Wilson steps outside, right onto it. Barrels of slapstick comedy reminiscent of The Three Stooges at times, ensues and is made even more hilarious thanks to the oblivious nature of Dennis, who has no idea he's causing Mr. Wilson such grief.

A great cartoon show finally returns to video. If you're a fan of Heathcliff the Cat, Dennis the Menace (from this 1986 series) includes plenty of slapstick comedy the likes of which is hard to find these days. Buy it!",1394841600,5,2113,4.55
6247902,5,B00I2YXN5A,This has been a long time coming I'm still in awe that this is even out I haven't been this excited since The Real Ghostsbusters cartoon release. This cartoon was really funny and the Dennis character kinda reminded me of myself when I was a kid (always had good intentions but things just get out of hand and that's when the fun begins) . I'm glad this is out on dvd and I hope it sells well because I want to get the second vol. which contains the rest of the series. I can't wait 5 stars all the way.,1394755200,6,503,4.04
6247903,5,B00I2YXN5A,"I wanted to wait until I actually received the product and viewed it before making a review.  If you know anything about Mill Creek Entertainment then you will not be surprised with this product.  This is the usual Mill Creek offering.  Instead of the paper sleeves you get all three discs on top of each other.  All I do is buy a 3 prong DVD case and change the cover.  Nothing is remastered or enhanced at all.  If I had to describe the quality of this I would say that this is exactly what you get when they played it on the Boomerang channel.  No HD but it is very clear and it looks really good on my HDTVs.  Be happy with this.  It's clear, cheap and you get 33 episodes on 3 discs.  Don't get all bent out of shape if you think there are too many episodes on one disc.  I never do.  If it's not remastered and cleaned up why would you really care?  A DVD can fit more than eleven 20 minute episodes and still have good quality.  I make my own all the time and I put no less than twelve episodes a disc.  It really only depends on the source material as far a quality is concerned.  As long as it's clear and I can watch it then I'm good.  I hope they finish this series.  It's Dennis the Menace folks.  A cartoon from 80's and it is fun for all ages.  Good old fashion family fun for boys and girls.",1394582400,5,1306,4.007782101167315
6247904,5,B00I2YXN5A,"Remember watching this when I was young before school every day. A fun, fast paced series. Great to see it's on DVD finally as I've been checking for it over the years. I hope my daughter will enjoy them when she's of age. It's awesome that these companies take the time to release these shows for us nostalgia junkies.",1393200000,3,319,4.423728813559322
6247905,3,B00I2YXN5A,"Great show and I have been waiting for this series for years!!

11 Episodes on a single disc is too many though. The video quality is more than likely going to be horrible.

Cramming 4 hours of content into each disc is compressing and lowering video quality. If these are 20-25 minute episodes and there is 11 of them, I can already tell I will be disappointed video quality wise.

It will be great to have the series to watch though and that makes it kind of worth it.",1391990400,7,470,4.258426966292135

6247914,3,B00I2YXN5A,"This was one of my favorite cartoons as a kid and have very fond memories that I cherish. The ONE thing I cannot get over is how the screwed up this set with the 1992 cartoon intro instead of the original 1986. The 86 opening was so delightful and charming, the 92 version was very plain and generic. I hope we get an entire collection set with the correct opening and a few extra's wouldn't hurt either :)",1424476800,,406,4.217948717948718

6247919,5,B00I2YXN5A,"Is the world ending or something?  The 2 series I've waited an eternity for are FINALLY put out on DVD - Dennis the Menace (80s cartoon) and Dobie Gillis!  All of Dobie, a start for Dennis the Menace.  I don't have them yet, but soon.  Why did it take them this long??  I'm 40 now!!  Anyway, there was nothing like coming home after school to watch and be inspired by Dennis.  This boy was like me.  Light-hearted, imaginative, and using the neighborhood as my creative palate.  One day I was a detective.  Next, a ghostbuster.  Next, racing bikes with my friends, etc.  And with the same gang, just like Dennis.  I am SO glad they finally put this out!  Don't stop there, guys.  Give us the whole trip down memory lane.",1419638400,,720,4.3893129770992365

Good quality images not remastered but not necessary. Only complaint if any Is they use the intro from the 90s version. If u want the 80s intro it's available on other dvds like ""trouble trouble everywhere "" or the uk release by jetix. This collection is the most complete so far and I look forward to volume 2.

6247934,4,B00I2YXN5A,"I remember watching this from my childhood days. It's actually quite funny. Especially when Dennis annoys Mr. Wilson, and Dennis and Margaret got at it. As for the DVD itself, the sound is average while the picture was re-mastered to the best it could and there are extras. Be warned episode 19 has poor picture quality. It looks like the tape got damaged, so the episodes look blurry and episodes have no title. Rated 10 and up for the use of guns, tobacco and some mild violence.",1397260800,3,481,4.540229885057471

6247936,5,B00I2YXN5A,"I'm loving when Cookie Jar, and now DHX Media, took over the DiC library amongst others. The result is they've been steadily releasing those libraries on DVD, some for the first time. I love it.

Despite it being a bare bones release, this DVD is a great trip down memory lane. The familiar theme song, the characters, right down to the classic voice talents of the late Phil Hartman. The episodes are not in high definition, with there being so many crammed onto each disc, but you know what? They don't need to be. When this show first aired there was no such thing as HD, and the quality is no more diminished than if you were watching the show freshly in 1986. I feel that only adds to the nostalgic quality of the presentation.

If you loved the show, you can't go wrong with picking this up. It will bring back memories.",1395619200,8,826,4.392156862745098
