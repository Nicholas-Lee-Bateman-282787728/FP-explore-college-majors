In the compilation DVD ""Over the Rainbow"" there is a short entitled ""Tracks"" and personally I think that film alone is worth buying the DVD.  The story is about two young girls who meet and fall in love but due to circumstances beyond their control they are forced apart, it is based on a true story.  For those of us who have watched short film after short film I don't have to tell you that most of them are; well how can I put this...bad.  They feel long and labored, they have the worst production value, and the acting is atrocious.  ""Tracks"" is a little over twenty minutes but it feels shorter than that, usually a twenty minute film feels like a two hour feature and when I say that I don't mean it as a good thing.  ""Tracks"" though feels short and left me wanting more, in that short span of time it told a complete story with beginning, middle, and ending, turning points and all, I felt like I got a plot line worthy of a feature in just twenty minutes.  The production value of the film is some of the best I've seen in any short from the art direction to the cinematography, to the sound, not to mention an original soundtrack that just gives the film that extra something that sets it apart from other shorts.  The acting is on point and the direction is next to none, Deana Williams helms a talented cast and crew into making what is in the opinion of this critic one of the best short films I've seen in a very long time.

More importantly then even the story or the production value of this film is the message.  We've all heard the comments from aging Hollywood actresses on how there are no good roles for them out there, we all know that for every film that centers on a female character there are ten about men.  For the few movies showcasing female leads maybe one or two are about black women and none of them gay.  ""Tracks"" serves as something more than just fine film making, it also stands as a statement about the current status of African-American lesbians and their representation or lack of in the entertainment business.  ""Tracks"" is a source of pride for any African-American female but in particular gay women, it tells every young black girl who is trying to make sense of her sexual orientation that she need not feel alone in this world.  It tells gay women of color that their voice is being heard and their stories are being told.  It conveys to every woman regardless of color that their lives are no less meaningful than those of their male counterparts (there isn't one man in the entire film).  The true power of this film lies in what it represents for the audience it was made for.  You don't have to be a lesbian or African-American to enjoy it because the story is universal (for anyone who has struggled with their identity) but if you are an African-American female who also happens to be gay then this is your film because it's your story and you have no reason to ever feel alone again.",1304035200,2,2962,4.395604395604396
