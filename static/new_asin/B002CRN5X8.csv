3907029,5,B002CRN5X8,"This does exactly what it is supposed to - adds two-factor authentication to AWS. Although I am slightly disheartened that it can only be used for AWS, and not any of the other Amazon products, it works as advertised. I feel more at ease that my proprietary information on AWS is secure and glad that I don't have to deal with constant password changes that would normally be required for even a shadow of what this style of authentication provides. If you use AWS in any professional capacity, I suggest using this device (as it's the only two-factor token solution available at this time).",1262736000,,591,4.6923076923076925
3907030,5,B002CRN5X8,"The Gemalto Ezio token is quite similar to the RSA SecureID token which I think is more prevalent in the market. It does exactly one thing: Display a pseudo-random number that changes according to time. After the device is activated, it becomes impossible to login to AWS web interface without entering the number shown on the token.

Activating the token with AWS is dead-simple, and its integration with the AWS authentication process is first-rate.

The primary benefit of this device is that it provides a second-factor for authentication other than one's password. In other words, even if someone steals your AWS username and password, they still will not be able to access AWS web management functions without physical possession of the token. Since it's been proven time and again that SSL on its own does not a secure system make, this kind of extra protection is not a luxury but rather a necessity, and it's nice that Amazon finally provided such a solution.

There are a few areas where the use of the token could be improved.

* Only a single token can be linked to a single AWS account. This obviates a few usage scenarios for the device, which is a shame.
* It would be nice if the use of the token would be extended to other parts of the Amazon network. Amazon Payments and the seller areas are obvious areas where this would be beneficial. I guess someone at Amazon decided this is not a consumer-oriented solution, which is odd because many banks and even PayPal use tokens such as this for authentication.
* The token can only be used with Amazon. You can't sync it to any other AAA server. If you already have a Gemalto token that you carry around, you would not be able to consolidate it with the AWS token.

If your business depends on AWS hosted infrastructure, the Ezio is something that you really must have. Think of it this way: How much money will you stand to lose if a malicious individual somehow manages to steals your login credentials? Probably more than the price of token plus shipping, right? Despite its current shortcomings (which will possibly be addressed by Amazon in the future), the Ezio token is an excellent solution that solves a real problem. If you manage any AWS service through the web, you'll definitely want to have one.",1260835200,3,2272,4.684210526315789

Since I use these tokens quite often, I can confirm that the clock drifts very frequently and token requires re-sync which is very inconvenient for users. Moreover, there are times where it is not possible to perform re-sync of the token by user -- the only possibility then is to login to account with different privileged user, remove token from user and re-add it again. Obviously this can cause many different problems especially when these tokens are used by privileged users.

My advice to anyone who is going to try to buy this is to consider using google authentication app (you can get it on all Androind, iOS, Windows Mobile OS) instead. That one is reliable and I never had to re-sync the token, you can manage multiple accounts with one app ... .

3907094,4,B002CRN5X8,"I just got the electronic token generator from Gemalto. As their notes specify, this is a specialized device for Amazon Web Services (e.g., you can't use it with your GMail account). It seems like a good product. The only reason I didn't give it a five star review is the Amazon definition for five starts is ""I love it"". How in love can you be with an electronic token generator? But I certainly like it.

Anyone who is developing a significant web application should be thinking about security from the start . Amazon Web Services also gives you tools for locking down your application (although it can be time consuming wading through their sometimes obscure documentation). One area of weakness is your AWS root account (e.g., the account you use to login to the AWS consoles). This account has absolute power over your application. Obviously this account has the power to delete your databases and remove all of your EC2 instances, crippling or destroying your application.  If your application gets notice and starts collecting a user base, people will attempt to hack it.

Two factor authentication makes your AWS root account unhackable. Only someone with your email address, your password and the token generator can log in to your account. Short of kidnapping, this is unlikely to happen. Two factor authentication removes a major security vulnerability. All for the cost of $13.

Sure you could use the free Google App on your phone. Right now, phones are one of the items most targeted by thieves. Perhaps this will change as stolen phones are set up to be disabled. But if your phone is stolen, you will not be able to get into your AWS account until you can get support to reset it.

Back to update my review, after another week of trying. These things really are useless. Luckily I never put one on the root account so I was not totally locked out, but if you risk using these, plan on resyncing as root user (not IAM user) regularly. Why Amazon nags me to put it on the root account as well, I have no idea - that is reckless advice in my experience, which luckily I ignored. My roll out to other users put on hold.

Back to update my review again. Gemalto were very helpful, and offered to replace these items; however I was told (no source unfortunately) that AWS had been having problems with the sync process, and that the problem was now resolved. I was highly dubious, except that this was entirely consistent with my own subsequent experience: I re-registered the one test token (since the roll-out was on hold - see above) and since then (approx 3 weeks ago, have had not one single auth problem. So I have to believe the problems we experienced first off were caused by AWS sync problems, and not by the Gemalto tokens.

Use of the device should be combined with a strong password-- I wouldn't trust any pseudo-random device as my sole security factor. Use it to make a strong password stronger and you will be set.

Surprisingly I was able to register the second device so I continued trying to register the remaining ones. As a result, I was able to register just 2 out of 5 devices so that I started searching the Amazon AWS pages for help. Amazon offers a link for exactly this problem which leads to a web form I filled out and, a couple of hours later, I received a phone call but we couldn't manage to get the devices registered by now. I'm still confident to get this fixed with the help of the Amazon support as they promised to get back to me, but I think it's a standard technology which simply has to work and not rocket science. Or perhaps it's just back luck that 3 out of 5 of my devices don't work at the beginning.",1309305600,,915,4.146067415730337
3907175,5,B002CRN5X8,I need more security to my AWS account.  This Token is the solution.  Now I'm sure that access to my account is very secured.,1308096000,,125,4.166666666666667
3907176,5,B002CRN5X8,"Small, light, cheap; there is no reason not to buy one of these if you have an AWS account.  Google has similar security technologies, using things such as SMS messages, but this physical device is great as well.  I had it shipped to Canada and taxes/duty/brokerage fees were all included in the small initial shipping fee -- great stuff!

Setup with Amazon was quick, easy, and I feel SOOoo much better knowing that my account has an extra layer of security now.  With trojans and keyloggers lurking in every corner these days, a temporal security system is just what I needed.

It did not come with a lanyard though, so losing it could be easy if you don't take care.  I bought a big neon lanyard for mine so I would never misplace it.

The LCD screen is also kinda small and dim; I assume the battery life will last years because of this, but if you have bad vision or dim lighting, it might be a bit challenging to read the code off when needed.

I got no idea what to do if I lose mine, as that scenario doesn't seem to be mentioned in plain sight, but I'll worry about that another day.  Right now, I feel relieved.

5/5, since it's cheap and it works as expected.  Too bad I can't use it for more of my other IT services though, as I can't find anyone else supporting it other than AWS. meh",1304640000,,1297,4.253061224489796
3907177,5,B002CRN5X8,"Want to make your AWS account more secure? The Ezio Time Token is an easy and effective security enhancement.

Each time you log into your AWS acount, you do not only use your userid and password (which could be sniffed by a keylogger), but also a 6 digit code created by this little device. A lot more difficult to crack than userid and password alone (unless there is a hidden backdoor, who knows?) with only a little bit of additional typing.",1299110400,,445,4.493827160493828

After communicating back and forth with support a few times, it was determined that I received a token from a bad batch.  Support promptly sent me out a new token for no additional charge.  The new token registered fine and works perfectly.  The device is simple looking, but works without a problem.  Product is a great value for the price.",1295222400,,491,4.651162790697675

They aren't getting abuse or being used very frequently and are filling the need very well.  I haven't had issues with them falling out of sync or experiencing poor batter life.  The oldest of them is 10 months old.  Again - they aren't used very often though.  Not sure how they would hold up if you were carrying on a keychain and using everyday.
