8320221,5,B001M0FHP0,"I'm just quoting what ""Variety"" said about the film when it was released since some people do not seem not realize it's a parody : ""A debut feature, it draws it's inspiration from the so called ""trivial novel"" found in droves on paperback stands of large European cities. The love story melodramas are usually set in plush settings and deal with idle rich finding and losing and finding each other under circumstances that are suppose to stimulate the readers emotions and tear ducts. Film begins in San Remo on the Riviera, where a Dsseldorf fashion king runs over a fair countess while driving his sports car too fast on curving lanes. She ends up in a hospital and needs plastic surgery to repair the scar on her face, but it's still love at first sight. Meanwhile back at the shop, a fashion show is rescued from a flop at the last minute by replacing the ankle-injured mannequin with a cinderella-lovely who goes on not only to steal the show but the heart of young manager and clothing designer.
The fashion czar and the countess from Florence wish to marry, but a quirk of fate reveals that they are related by blood - in fact, Rdiger is rescued in the nick of time from marrying his half-sister. Naturally everything gets unraveled in the end to reveal more oddities in the family tree.
Everything is done tongue-in-cheek and in grand parody style: Corny lines and silly costumes. The Hamburg designer Wolfgang Joop plays the couturier Rdiger to the hilt, while the Italian countess is in real-life an Yves-Saint-Laurent mannequin from Paris, Violetta Sanchez. All the other roles, too, fit their personalities like a kid gloves. The other plus is Jaquqes Steyn's talent for lightening and decoration.""",1488326400,,1710,4.819727891156463

The story is preposterous, the make-up is awful, the background ""music"" overpowers the dialogue.

Just leave it alone. It's not worth anyone's time.",1344988800,,187,5.413793103448276
