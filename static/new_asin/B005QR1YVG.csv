8483610,1,B005QR1YVG,"This is a totally depressing movie that wasted the talents of its main stars, Ronald Colman, Walter Huston, and Ida Lupino.  The only saving feature of this film is the adorable Scottish terrier that was devoted to the Ronald Colman character and friendly to everyone else, except Ida Lupino.  Every time the dog saw her he'd start to growl and she would growl back.  Beyond that the story synopsis claims that the Ronald Colman character falls for the Ida Lupino character which is wrong.  She fell for the Walter Huston character and, at first, he returned her feelings.  But then he was talked out of any sort of liaison because of her checkered past.  The story synopsis does say that Ronald Colman's character is going blind as the plot unfolds but doesn't say anything about the earlier love interest of his childhood sweetheart. She rejects marrying him because she wants to become a great artist like he is, but when he goes blind she tries for a reunion that he rejects.  That just didn't make sense unless he was supposed to be a masochist, AKA, someone who enjoys pain.  This was never exhibited elsewhere in the story which makes the storyline fall apart.  Finally, the Walter Huston character declared he'd have a thousand surgeons examine and help his blinded friend but this never even got started. In summary, the movie was a big disappointment and I can't recommend anyone taking the time to watch it, except Scottie fans or masochists.",1500249600,,1453,4.78
8483611,5,B005QR1YVG,"This is a surprisingly fine and thoughtful film.  Colman is in top form and has an outstanding ensemble with him.
Kipling sure had a way with war related stories and this one is a wonderful one.",1500249600,,194,4.388888888888889
8483612,5,B005QR1YVG,"Ronald Colman and Walter Huston give wonderful performances, but Ida Lupino steals the show as the cockney streetwalker who becomes Mr. Colman's muse. The scene where she wreaks revenge on him made her a star after years of playing undemanding ingenues. The next two years saw her at Warner Bros. delivering the goods in ""They Drive by Night' and ""High Sierra""",1427500800,4,360,4.918032786885246
8483613,5,B005QR1YVG,"There is little that I can add to the excellent review by Mr. Morrella except that I too highly recommend it.  This is Coleman at his finest.
Very different from  his light hearted comedy roles. I agree that Ms. Lupino's  performance is superb.
Coleman's words in a memorable scene, following a dramatic twist in the plot, in which he speaks in an understated sotto voce filled with self realization, anguish and despair is unforgettable.",1421107200,3,438,4.891891891891892
8483614,5,B005QR1YVG,"Ronald Colman, great actor and wonderful voice. This film is based on the Rudyard Kipling novel of a war correspondent covering the British/Sudan War. It starts off showing the character during his youth and love for a girl. His life separates them. His specialty is art, providing sketches for the articles. During a battle he sustains a wound on his head. On returning to England he decides to devote himself to art.

This leads him to meeting a beautiful young girl played superbly by Ida Lupino. She is very low class. The relationship is truly unusual, but degrades as she sees he is not drawn to her. From this point the drama really picks up as his long lost love enters his life and then he learns he is losing his sight.

This is an extremely well done visualization of a classic tale. I highly suggest you see this.",1406764800,6,825,4.530201342281879
