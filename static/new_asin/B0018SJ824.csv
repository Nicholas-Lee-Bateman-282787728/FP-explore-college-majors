8270917,3,B0018SJ824,I might like it if only I could see it. Why did all these chinese medicine videos get removed?,1486684800,,94,4.0
8270918,3,B0018SJ824,I'll give it a 3 bc it does tell you about the cups and explains a little about using them but don't expect to learn a single thing you couldn't find for free on the Internet.  You could learn how to use the cups better by watch YouTube.,1469318400,,237,3.9375
8270919,5,B0018SJ824,"I'm currently looking into incorporating cupping in my practice and this video was very helpful. It walks you through the different types of cups and techniques used with them. They explain the difference between ""stationary cupping"", ""movable cupping"" and ""bloodletting cupping"" amongst other and it is very informative. The english subtitles weren't perfect but it gets the message across. Highly recommended!",1457481600,,411,5.754098360655738
8270920,5,B0018SJ824,I suffered from post surgical shoulder pain for over a year and cupping really helped reduce the pain and get me moving again.,1377820800,,126,4.521739130434782
