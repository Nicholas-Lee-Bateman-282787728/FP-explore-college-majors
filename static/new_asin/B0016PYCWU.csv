8263992,4,B0016PYCWU,"This is definitely a 'Snoop' film!  You can tell right away.  It's not really a movie, there is a lot of music with cartoon videos.  There is a few funny moments with Kat Williams, but not a lot of 'real' video - mostly animated.",1346976000,,229,4.159090909090909
8263993,3,B0016PYCWU,This was a cool music video with animation.  Not exactly what I thought it would be - but surprisingly good.,1233792000,,108,4.4
8263994,5,B0016PYCWU,"Presents new music from Snoop in a animated music video form. Snoop's new music is great and the vids are funny as hell. This isn't a movie, rather it is a bunch of music videos pieced together with a couple animted shorts. If your a snoop fan than this is an absolute don't miss. The animation isn't the greatest but it works. Snoop's beats go hard and there are cameos from some of your favorite West Coast artists: The Game, Dogg Pound, E-40 (my fav), MC Eiht, Goldie Loc also Kat Money Mike Williams, and Mike Epps.

My favorite song on there called domestic dispute that will leave you rollin on the floor.

Not for kids to watch because there are sex scenes and animated booty all over the place.
Hot music.",1214524800,7,713,4.393939393939394
8263995,5,B0016PYCWU,"Snoop's cartoon epic is awesomely entertaining from start to finish. From the sexy cartoon chicks to the hilarious social-commentary and well-drawn cartoon-characters, this flick is tops!! I could watch this every day of the week and still enjoy it from Snoop's raps to the female mishaps, this flick is worth buying!",1214438400,5,317,5.235294117647059
