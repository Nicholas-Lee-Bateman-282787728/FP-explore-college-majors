7987909,5,B00008YJCE,"The presentation is rich in overlapping plots. Most of the actors are form other popular presentations. The story was adapted from a book by Caroline Graham but adapted to fit in the Midsomer Murder series.

A portrait is vandalized and an expert Sandra MacKillop (Cheryl Campbell) is brought in to restore it. D.C.I. Tom Barnaby (John Nettles) is being shadowed by Nico Bentley (Ed Waters) Cully's actor boyfriend; Nico for a character to be in a play, is studying Troy's (Daniel Casey) methods.
Inanimate Items start to move on their own. Slowly but surly we come to realize there is a ghost or someone is nutters. This is a story of beyond the grave circumstances.

Whet makes this presentation interesting is watching the interaction of our favorite characters for the ""Midsomer"" series. They have a lot of great on liners and Sergeant Gavin grimaces as he has to eventually interview the local nutters.",1510790400,,907,4.921568627450981

7987912,5,B00008YJCE,"Love all of the Midsomer Murders DVD's.  Watch them over and over.  Wish I could live in one of the small quirky villages.  The mysteries are well written, the scenery is breathtaking and the characters are entertaining to say the least.  As Barnaby would say everyone seems to be ""doing"" everyone else despite the appearance of being prim and proper.  But there is humor mixed in so it is not offensive.  Watching these DVD's is a good way to escape to another place on a rainy day in need of a good adventure.  Hope you enjoy them as much as me!",1406505600,,547,4.356435643564357
