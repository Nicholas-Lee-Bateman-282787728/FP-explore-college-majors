8185651,5,B000OMD1MI,This is a masterpiece like everything else Ghibli cooks up. Perfect in every way!!!,1413072000,2,83,5.0
8185652,5,B000OMD1MI,I dislike how people are giving this 1 star because it is not a complete collection of all Ghibli work. Iblard Time is a music video showcasing Naohisa Inoue's paintings of the Iblard world with a touch of animation that brings the paintings to life. It is a very calming showcase of a artists work that I would have likely never seen if this music video was not released. Naohisa Inoue's paintings of the Iblard world was the main inspiration behind the famous Ghibli film Whisper of the Heart. It is a must see for any Ghibli fan.,1324339200,45,532,4.438775510204081
8185653,1,B000OMD1MI,Look at the title! It says DVD collection when the picture is a Blu-Ray! This is only a single film and not the whole hayao miyazaki collection! Everyone is going to have to wait and buy the soon to be released Disney Studio Ghibli collection on Blu-ray. Since this is an import i doubt it will work on our blu-ray players to begin with because of region coding.,1293580800,34,362,4.338235294117647
