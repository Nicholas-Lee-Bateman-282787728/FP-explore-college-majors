8476640,4,B005K8RJMY,I am not a fan of this.. but my hubby..? Oh my! He loves it! Great gift for the ultimate fan of 'cheese'!!,1491350400,,106,3.652173913043478
8476641,3,B005K8RJMY,"So,  I wanted to see all the films in this collection so I wasn't completely bumbed out when I discovered that at least 2 of the 5 films appear to be very low quality VHS dubs! A lot of the effects in Samurai Reincarnation get lost in the low-fi image. It was only 5 buck so Im not too upset.",1466035200,,292,3.8666666666666667
8476642,5,B005K8RJMY,Second Thought it is great stuff for an intro into Sonny Chiba Universe. Of course not for those who are used to digital re-mastering and sub titles. But you get the full experience into how it all was introduced into the states. Worth Five bucks.,1451433600,,247,4.511111111111111

8476644,1,B005K8RJMY,"This is my first & (sadly) negative review.  This product is definitely not for film nerds.  The transfer is lousy, full-frame, & grainy.  The only audio is a cheesy English dub.  And I'm pretty sure half the films are missing from their claim on the cover.  I counted only two films in the ""collection.""  Avoid.",1427673600,3,312,4.581818181818182
8476645,5,B005K8RJMY,"Have to have all Sonny Chiba films, not all are great and remember it is mostly in 70's so some times a bit cheesy. You cant bet it for the price.",1395100800,,146,3.7419354838709675
8476646,5,B005K8RJMY,"I remember these movies when they first came out. i now can enjoy them again. Great quality ,  Thanks .",1391385600,,103,4.15
8476647,1,B005K8RJMY,"...i like sonny flix... but the production qualities on this edition of this set is criminal... digitally remastered?... blatant lie... literally looks like someone has pointed a handicam at a tv screen and hit the 'record' button... those responsible should be pilloried... or worse... if you want to insult and offend an enemy, give them this for Christmass...",1367625600,,362,5.258620689655173
8476648,3,B005K8RJMY,"It is not really a samurai movie collection. GI Samurai is for exaample a ""science"" fiction. I was disappointed a little bit.",1360108800,,125,4.7272727272727275
