7624096,5,B01BA5224K,"It's a journey that encompasses decades. It's a journey condensed beautifully in a movie that helps redefine the meaning of love. A journey of two very brave, strong, perfectly flawed people who took that step into the abyss that became their destiny. The love between Grace and Grace will take you on a ride teetering between tears and laughter as they struggle to redefine their relationship in a world still hostile to the unconventional. Each has a different persespective as different as their own personas but ultimately the differences comes down to the same equation: They love each other. It's not perfect and that is what makes the strongest impact it's like all love, whether between man woman, woman woman, man man all relationships are essentially fraught with the same pitfalls, all of us, benefit and sometimes flail and fail from our all too mortal sensibilities. The love part is inclusive in that it very much is also the story of Kate and Jesse the daughter and son of these amazing women who are toddlers when they begin their relationship and now are very much adults, Kate fighting against all odds against a devastating illness Jesse a very gifted artist/musician. It's Peter Parsons story too the devoted and ever loving husband of Grace Moceri and Jesse's Dad. It incorporates Jesse's difficult decision to have a biological daughter with a lesbian couple who are friends of he and his male partner. Oh, and of course Hobo, sweet, dear Hobo who becomes Grace S's ""husband"" after Grace M's unexpectec, untimely passing. It will grip you and stay with you for a long time and would make a perfect Valentines gift for anyone at any time of the year or anytime in their life.",1455062400,8,1696,4.831615120274914
7624097,5,B01BA5224K,"This film moved me deeply.
I was fortunate enough to catch a screening a couple years ago and the film has drifted in and out of my thoughts periodically ever since, which is rare for me. Sometimes I find myself wondering, how has the film left such an indelible mark on me? Yes, its funny. Yes, its haunting. Yes, its evocative. But none of these things explain why its stayed with me so long. I intend to buy the DVD and try to get to the bottom of these questions. If there is one.",1454544000,5,484,4.159574468085107
7624098,5,B01BA5224K,"An uplifting example of our fellow human companions having the courage to landscape their private experience. I am glad they had the humble grace to share it with others.  If you like to laugh and feel deep in your bones, spend time with the two graces. It is well worth the trip.  You will gain many happy points.",1454284800,4,314,4.396551724137931

7624107,5,B01BA5224K,This is a story of human relations and what it takes for people to make a life together regardless of gender.  The honesty with which the two women speak about the joy and struggle of their lives making a clear analysis of their relationship is beautiful.  In the long run all life story turns into fiction and this fiction made into a documentary was well directed and produced.  Congratulations to Lya Guerra for a work of art!,1471478400,2,429,4.545454545454546

7624112,1,B01BA5224K,"Not really my cup of tea since I do not believe that lesbians should get married to men (ever) or have kids (ever).  Why put the kids through this?

Love is selfless - not selfish.

Putting a sex life ahead of your own kid is selfish - not selfless.

Kids need their mother and father on so many biological/psychological levels.",1466035200,,328,4.416666666666667

7624114,5,B01BA5224K,"I was so thrilled to see that this documentary is now available on Amazon!  i was fortunate to see two screenings of it and kept telling all my friends about it; however, it is a documentary that needs to be seen and not talked about in order to really be touched.
The Graces, their families and friends are truly special. The director does such an incredible job of bringing their story out without trying to prove something or direct the storyshe lets this story unfold and captures it beautifully in all of its wit, pain, love and humanness.  I have a lot of East Coast family and I know how private and tight lipped they can be.  Lya Guerra, through her reverent curating, has brought to light an authentic love story.  I am thankful everyone involved for opening up what is typically a tender part of the human psyche because I love LOVE and feel healed in my own heartaches and breaks by watching this unique documentary.
It is a love story, yes, between lovers, but also family and friends.  It is for the everyone. If you want a ROMCOM, google Meg Ryanif you want to experience love, watch this!!!",1458604800,3,1105,4.505

7624117,5,B01BA5224K,"Best film that I have ever seen at an LGBTQ film festival.  So happy to see it out on DVD.  Lya Guerra's understated direction and painterly eye make exquisite documentary art out of the simple / not-so-simple story of two women making family over the course of decades.  It's a beautifully filmed narrative of the lives of two women, Grace Moceri and Grace Schrafft, with walk-on parts for their children, for the adults their children become, for the friends and exes who are woven through their lives on two coasts and through many incarnations of what is, at its heart, a powerful story of love making, family making, and journey taking.  Don't miss it.",1456617600,4,657,4.7368421052631575
7624118,5,B01BA5224K,"How I love this film.  I was lucky enough to see it at the MFA in Boston a few years ago; it is a witness to young women becoming the selves they never know they were, happiness, humor, love in all its messiness in our modern times.  It's so corny to say, but I must use the phrase ""deeply touching""  and I wish this were on PBS for all to see.  Beautiful filming and editing of past and present footage; I've been wanting to have my own copy - now I have it - I just watched it again after a couple of years since that first viewing, I am as moved as the first time.",1455408000,4,567,3.8620689655172415

8749728,5,B01BA5224K,"When all is said and done, this is a love story . . . simply a story of love. Love is messy, difficult, painful, joyful and glorious. I fell in love with Grace and Grace. I laughed and cried and felt so much empathy for what people go through when they are in relationships that are untraditional by American standards. I so admired that these women followed their hearts in a time (close to when I grew up) when being anything other than hetro was heavily criticized.",1498348800,4,468,4.390804597701149

8749733,5,B01BA5224K,"This is the story of two women who lived conventionally-expected lives (married with children) until they discovered they were in love with each other. We go on in their story to hear them describe how they didn't even know how to express this love. The majority of what we see, though, is how two individuals, through love and with lots of affection, learn to live with the others' often annoying or frustrating behavior.  The beauty in this is how they manage to maintain their own and embrace the individuality of the other.
I loved it!",1479168000,,539,4.673684210526316
