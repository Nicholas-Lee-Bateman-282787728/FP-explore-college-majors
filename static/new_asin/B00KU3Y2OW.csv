8661647,4,B00KU3Y2OW,"Good mid-60's Mexican-made, Spanish-language (no dubbing or sub-titles) horror film.  A clutch of devil-worshipping women vow vengeance on the descendants of some guy that dis-respected or desecrated their religion a looong time back.  One of the bad girls is played by Yolanda Montes (Tongolele), an exotic dancer who dances OK but has the all the acting talent of a block of wood.  The evil femmes start offing the targeted family and some good girl wrestlers battle the bad girls in and out of the ring.  Has some fun moments.  The VCI Entertainment DVD release is fine quality.  Highly recommended for fans of this genre.",1422921600,3,625,4.961538461538462
8661648,5,B00KU3Y2OW,Very cool and fun entry in the Las Luchadoras series.  Two Amazonian wrestler babes (as seen in DOCTOR OF DOOM and WRESTLING WOMEN VS. THE AZTEC MUMMY) investigate a strange panther cult that gathers in a secret crypt and abducts victims for sacrifice!  No English subtitles but you don't have to speak Spanish to thoroughly enjoy this south of the border thriller.  DVD quality is pretty good for this budget priced gem!,1413244800,2,421,4.819444444444445
