8162313,5,B000LMWF1E,I've seen C&K in concert before and of course loved them. This DVD is like being at their concert all over again (and again)...what more could a girl ask for? :-),1395014400,,162,4.258064516129032
8162314,5,B000LMWF1E,"If you enjoy Cecilio & Kapono in concert, you will love this dvd. They play 11 of their hits plus Danny's song, which is always a crowd pleaser. This concert features a full complement of 4 back up musicians on drums, keyboard, and bass, so the sound is more true to the original recordings than other concerts that feature just C&K (although those are wonderful as well). This is a well produced dvd with many additional features including lyrics, hanging out with C&K, some concertgoers attempts at singing C&K songs, as well as a paragraph printed on the screen prior to each song with interesting information about C&K or the song itself, which is optional to watch with or without. I highly recommend this dvd for any C&K fan.",1319414400,,731,4.674418604651163
