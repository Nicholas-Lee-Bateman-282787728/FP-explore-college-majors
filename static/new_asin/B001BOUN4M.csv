8283969,5,B001BOUN4M,"Ernie LaPointe, great-grandson of Sitting Bull, gives insights into the oral history that was passed down to him by his mother and she in turn learned these from her mother Mary Standing Holy, daughter of Sitting Bull and Seen By Her Nation.  Besides seeing the beautiful wildlife footage shot by Bill Matson, you will learn about some of the Lakota creation stories and of course about Sitting Bull and his childhood, growing into adolescence and then into manhood.  You will also learn and understand what a remarkable man Sitting Bull truly was and how much respect his great-grandchildren, Ernie and his sisters, still have for him today.  Sitting Bull or rather Tatanka Iyotake and his people lived through difficult times from when they never met a white person to being overrun by disease, the railroad, the gold rush and of course the military; where it once was common practice to count coup on the enemy in order to receive great honor to actually having to kill the enemy in order to preserve a way of life.  In these difficult times, Tatanka Iyotake was bestowed with the great honor but even greater responsibility of being elected as the leader of the entire Lakota Nation.",1252800000,2,1187,4.832512315270936
