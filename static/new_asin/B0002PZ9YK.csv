8030489,3,B0002PZ9YK,"It's so weird to see Jon Finch in this. The man worked with Hitchcock and yet here he is slumming in a b-movie with a guy who wishes he was Miles O'Keefe. Let that sink in. He wishes he was Miles O'Keefe. It's like wishing to be the bassist in the band. Sure, every now and then your bassist is Gene Simmons or Keanu Reeves but in reality you're just there like Miles O'Keefe. Unfortunately for this guy too, he's not as humorous or as good looking as Miles O'Keefe. So, you're just getting hit from all sides.

The movie does has it's bright spots like Jeffrey Combs totally over the top and hilarious as always. The man can't help but entertain. He plays a doctor who seems to be constantly drinking. Oh and trying to blow up a church built over a bunch of ghouls/zombies. It's never really all that clear.

Yeah, the movie is basically from Dusk Til Dawn but with zombies and vague HP Lovecraft references. It's not a terrible idea for a movie. It just never gels. Thankfully this is a Mystery Science Theater 3000 level production. Even by Charles Band standards, we're looking at the bottom here. Like the best of these kinds of movies, you get some awesome Jeffrey Combs, Jon Finch, and actress performances that make things hilarious. The actresses here have been in other stuff and they seem unaware that they are really in hot garbage. They're trying hard. It's endearing. Even the Miles O'Keefe wannabe is too.

I enjoyed this in a goofy half ironic way. It's not for everyone. It's poorly made, makes no sense, and is insulting in it's lack of not just good taste but also bad taste. It's all pretty funny at least.",1525132800,,1626,4.486486486486487

8030493,3,B0002PZ9YK,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

If a project has Lovecraft attached to it, you can bet Ill be chomping at the bit to check it out.  Unfortunately, just having the word associated with something doesnt make it Lovecraftian in nature.  Several film adaptations of Lovecrafts work have taken lengthy liberties with the source material, and the resulting products come out as something vastly different than the authors intentions.

Such is the case with LURKING FEAR, a 1994 Full Moon film that is releasing on Blu-ray tomorrow.  And while the film is fun for the most part, I don't think it should be listed in Lovecrafts filmography.  But if you take it for what it is (a nonsensical creature-feature), you might just enjoy yourself.

I will confess I am disappointed with how far away from the original story the film goes.  Lovecrafts short is a vivid and imaginative jaunt into terror.  This film version, however, comes across more like something Sam Raimi might have made back in the 80s.

LURKING FEAR looks great onscreen, thanks to a nice HD transfer.  The picture is crisp for the most part (some of the darker scenes look a bit grainy), and the surround sound projects nicely through the speakers.

The acting in LURKING FEAR is pretty good, although a couple of performances stand out.  I loved Ashley Laurence as Cathryn.  She will always be Kirsty from the HELLRAISER series to me, but seeing her in this role gave me a newfound sense of her talent.  Also, Jeffrey Combs once again shines, this time as an alcoholic, nicotine-fueled doctor.  Combs has a knack for making his characters larger-than-life, and this role is no different.

The special effects look pretty good overall, but some could have been better.  The creature effects are slick and scary, and I have to tip my hat to the creature designer(s); the bulging eyes on the beasts face make a striking focal point.  Theres not much gore, but what we do get looks nice and fresh.

On the downside for LURKING FEAR, the storyline is choppy, and several explanations are missing.  I will not mention specifics, as I don't want to give anything away, but I will say there are gaping holes in certain aspects of the plot.

If you can look past that, then you're in for a pretty fun time.  LURKING FEAR is not an excellent film, but its still entertaining and offers plenty of reasons to own it.  The Blu-ray hits store shelves tomorrow, so make a note.",1465862400,6,2462,4.685314685314685
8030494,2,B0002PZ9YK,"Lurking Fear was a quick, cheap movie dumped out by Full Moon in the 90's. It's not a cult film, it's not a lost classic. The movie was bad and don't let the combination of Full Moon, Jeffrey Combs, and HP Lovecraft trick you into thinking this is something special you missed. I'm just posting to try and save some people some money because it really isn't worth it. I got it on one of those $5 multipack DVDs and barely made it to the end. Not scary, not funny, not terribly faithful to the Lovecraft original, and not even that entertaining. The nicest thing I can say for it is that it's a good role for Hellraiser star Ashley Laurence, who actually has more screen time than Jeffrey Combs. Probably just skip this one and watch Castle Freak again.",1465516800,7,752,4.378571428571429
8030495,3,B0002PZ9YK,"Demonic type creatures live underground at Leffert's Corners. They like to come out on Christmas eve as our human hunters prepare a surprise from them at the church cemetery. Meanwhile some bad guy grave robbers are looking for buried money. The two clash, in what becomes a three way fight.

You don't get to see the Creepshow looking creatures until near the end. Until then it was just arms reaching out. The scare factor was hit and miss. Short film with little to no character build up.

3 stars because it didn't completely suck and was based on an H.P. Lovecraft short story. Part of a 30 Horror Film Collection.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1415318400,2,662,4.641025641025641
