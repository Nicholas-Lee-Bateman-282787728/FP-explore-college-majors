2632410,3,B000HA4WSY,"Do not expect a depiction of the ""truth"". However, the accounts of
these veterans of the Iraqi & Afghanistan wars demand thoughtful
consideration.

The major strength of the film is that it vividly portrays the words
and war wounds of these vets and their post-war struggles to
reconstruct some degree of normalcy and functionality to their lives.

My major criticism of the film is twofold: it is one-sided and it
advocates anti-war activism but nothing more to correct the serious
shortcomings of the military's and Veterans Affairs' programs for
helping those who've suffered and still suffer the traumas of war.
These are NOT fatal flaws of the film.

As a veteran myself, I know that the horrible aftermath of war is real,
and these young men and women articulate it very well. These vets
vividly describe the physical and mental pain and torment that most
veterans experience and that ordinary people need to understand because
the horrors of ALL wars are so traumatic and disturbing.",1159315200,14,990,4.987878787878788

2632436,4,B000HA4WSY,"What makes this film work is that it allows the stories to be told entirely by the soldiers themselves, without fancy graphics, jump cuts, or voice over. It's a tribute to the work of director Foulkrod and editor Hall that this complicated story plays out so smoothly. The soldiers interviewed are cut from ordinary Joe cloth and are the kind of people that grew up on your block, that you went to school with, and that you've worked with. Stories told like this just don't get any more compelling.
  Many negative reviews of this fine film concentrate on the notion that it is ""slanted"" or ""one sided"". What many of these reviewers fail to recognize is that the imperatives of documentary film making have little to do with ""fairness"" and ""balance"". Documentary film's closest cousin is the personal, expository essay. It is underwritten 100% by point-of-view and opinion; without that underwriting it would be worthless as a record of personal experience. To ask a documentary to be ""fair and balanced"" is, in effect, asking it to be jejune and  toothless. Put another way, if a documentary doesn't have a point of view, it isn't doing its job, sort of like the ham-fisted student who opines, in a desultory essay conclusion, ""It's not for me to say..."" Well, if you're not willing to say, then what good are you? The filmmaker, like the student, is invited to take a stand--if she doesn't, then she's doing no one any good.
  The turning point of this film, and of much public debate about the Iraq war, is that many American veterans have been publicly let down by the support systems that were supposed to be there for them. The stories told here are by those who were let down. Doing a ""compare and contrast"" piece of ten vets who were cared for and ten who weren't would be pretty pointless indeed.
  Finally, I would caution those who are quick to confuse ""slanted"" with ""telling me things I don't agree with"" or ""telling me things I'd rather not hear"".  This willful and too-common confusion, by those who sit all along the political spectrum,  is sad evidence of the infantilization of our society as a whole.",1201996800,2,2119,4.690026954177897
2632437,4,B000HA4WSY,"The veterans who participated in this finely crafted doco are unquestionably brave and patriotic.  The unvarnished retelling of their experiences is what gives it its power.  The soldiers frankly explain why they enlisted before reflecting upon the difficulties adjusting to the consequences of actions they were not psychologically prepared for during their tours of duty. And like the famous ""Winter Soldiers"", who dramatically blew the whistle on the excesses of the Vietnam intervention a generation ago, are likely to be rejected as unpatriotic by many who view the film.  But what do they know?  These are real soldiers, not John Wayne or Mel Gibson togged out in jungle greens, pretending to save the free world from some dark, hideous specter.  Only those who serve can really appreciate the full horror of war - these are their stories.  This documentary forces the viewer to reflect upon the seriousness of committing young men and women to the occupation of killing people they are, through their training, conditioned to hate.",1192665600,2,1038,5.18562874251497

2632440,5,B000HA4WSY,"In this video only several people were interviewed.
If many more veterans were interviewed as well, we would produce a series of hundreds of episodes, which would be more beneficial for the society than ""sex and the city"", ""seinfield"", ""O.C"", and the rest of the junk put together.
Somehow, people are more inclined not to listen to the fact, but rather safely close their ears and eyes, and live in imaginary world of Hollywood.
Another interesting thing I found, is that general public is happy to know that the death toll of US soldiers is not that great (compared to other wars in the past, etc), while ignoring HUGE number of people who are disabled. As if being disabled is ok...

Mostly very good (there is a little part when one man talks about ""our species"" assuming evolutionary assumption. This is pretty much what I didn't like)
Very interesting video.
Very educational.
Nobody can express how bad war is except those who have been there.

2632442,5,B000HA4WSY,"Though it is very painful to see this video, it is greatly worth it.  Even if one is very well informed about Iraq and some of the abuses of American soldiers such as repeated services, the true stories of individual soldiers on how they became disillusioned is wrenching.  The deepest insight I got was that killing innocents in the war tortures returning soldiers and is integral to the post traumatic stress syndrome so many of the soldiers are suffering. The film makes you question this kind of war--especially in Iraq. This is because a soldier can't ever know for sure who is the enemy, that is who is shooting at them so they kill a whole lot of people in the direction from which the soldier was shot at.  When they kill a lot of innocent people they create e.g. 500 new fervid enemies (the famiies of those shot) What's the point!  This is emotionally created in the viewer.",1185753600,,884,4.540880503144654
2632443,3,B000HA4WSY,"The Ground Truth tells the story of a few veterans who came away from the Iraq War very discontented, mentally disturbed or psychologically damaged in some major way. The stories reflected in the movie are real, but the packaging is designed to bias people into thinking that everything about the war is bad, which is simply not true. Many people are killed, maimed and injured - that is the case in every war (I am one of the veterans in question.) Many bad decisions are made and many lives are ruined when wars are fought, invasions launched and weapons brought to bear. But not every veteran walks away from war as disturbed in the head as the people portrayed here.

The Ground Truth is sobering, realistic and flawed, because it only shows one third of the picture. That is OK, as long as the viewer understands going in that the movie is slanted towards convincing people of how awful and wrong the entire thing is by showing all the bad and none of the good. We should all know that war does bad things to the people who participate in it, and that sometimes the living suffer more than the dead, or at least longer. We should also know that in wars, human beings commit some of the greatest acts of selflessness that have ever been displayed. Those stories are not told here.",1181779200,2,1284,4.510729613733906
2632444,5,B000HA4WSY,"I came across this show on the Sundance channel and I couldn't stop watching it. I think everyone in the US should watch this video. It was so amazing to hear the stories from troops that have actually been in combat and come home. They ALL have injuries, whether they have lost their limbs, or are mentally scarred due to what they have seen and have had to do. Many of them are in a state of turmoil and angst because of what they have seen and done to protect their country. They are making the biggest sacrifice and we owe it to them to become politically aware and involved. To know what they endure in Iraq would make everyone think twice about this war. To understand what they face when they come home would make everyone think twice about their government.

2632450,5,B000HA4WSY,"Although I can understand why some veterans might view this film as one-sided, it does not pretend to be a comprehensive survey; rather, it reveals the dark side of U.S. operations in Iraq, the OFFICIAL POLICY of knowingly killing innocent Iraqi civilians, including children, when it is expedient to do so.  The film also explores the shabby and hypocritical manner in which veterans with emotional injuries (often related to the guilt of such morally abhorrent actions) are treated in comparison to those with more obvious physical injuries.  These powerful truths are not being given their due by the mainstream media.  Even though the war is now unpopular, this film will raise consciences to a new level.

Some are motivated by opposition to the war, but not all, and the documentary focuses almost completely on the soldiers' experiences, not on politics.

Of course, there are many vets who support the war, but over 1,000 active-duty members of the US military have signed an Appeal for Redress of Grievances that calls for ""the prompt withdrawal of all American military forces and bases from Iraq"".

2632454,3,B000HA4WSY,"The Ground Truth is worth watching.  It provides much footage and commentary rarely encountered in other media.  Rarely broadcast--for whatever reason.  Certainly, the film's discussion touches both the mind and heart.  And, it could be hardly more important.  Many Americans have been awaiting the missing piece of the truth that this film provides.

  I have one negative criticism of The Ground Truth.  Responsibly, one must provide this ""Spoiler.""  Most veterans interviewed are with Veterans Against the War; however, the film-makers provide this ethical information only in the denouement. Furthermore, one interviewed veteran pursues a Hollywood career.  Perhaps, this document-ary contains biased hidden truths--perhaps not.

  Perhaps appropriately, one could compare this documentary's legitimacy to that of Fahrenheit 9/11.  The text provides a goldmine of hidden realities/truths, but it functions also as essayistic propaganda.  Purchase this DVD if you navigate its mixed composition willingly.  Otherwise, Gunner Palace provides a less-biased commentary.

2632455,5,B000HA4WSY,"I bought this DVD a month ago and it sat on my shelf till Christmas eve. I finally had some time by myself waiting for Christmas morning and decided to watch it. I am writing this review on Christmas eve immediately after watching it. I felt compelled to run to my computer and write this review down and hopefully be lucky enough to catch your eye, and tell you to buy this DVD and to show it to as many people as possible.

This film exposes what the military does to young people with hopes and dreams, and shows how any person who gets sucked into serving into Iraq, no matter how good of a person they were before their duty in IRaq, it shows that we all capable of turning into killing machines. GUnning down women, children and innocent men is all part of the game. These soldiers cannot turn off the way they have been trained to become killing machines when they come home to their loved ones.

This movie shows that the amount of guilt and aggression that these soldiers are filled with has caused them to kill themselves, pull guns on others, attack loved ones and become disconnected from reality. The military has thrown away these soldiers. They are nothing but a liability and their voices, mental and physical health are nothing but an inconvienience.

After watching this film, I was overwhelmed with a feeling that I had to go out and show this film to anyone who I could get to sit in front of a screen. I have decided that everyone I know must see this film it is their patriot duty to know what we put these soldiers through and to know the true meaning of ""supporting the troops"" I hope that my review can convince others to buy this film, watch it and show it to others.

This, of course, undermines the intelligence of the average viewer, but then again, that target demographic (impressionable youth and/or less than intelligent) is whom this film is aimed at anyway...If you are a ""Bush-Basher"", you will enjoy the ""more of the same"" tired arguments against the war.

2632458,5,B000HA4WSY,"With well-funded pentagon PR firms like the Rendon Group, militarist radio hosts like Hugh Hewitt and Sean Hannity, and an array of movies, tv dramas, and video games that glorify war - ""The Ground Truth"" is a welcomed dose of hard reality.  Featuring the words of veterans from Iraq and Vietnam, and military psychologists like Lt. Col. Dave Grossman, this important documentary reveals the hidden truth of the slaughter taking place in Iraq.

I just shared a copy of it with a friend of mine at work whose daughter signed up for the ROTC.  The military is an institution that gives many people a career and a sense of identity, but after viewing this documentary, the daughter decided the military is not the path she wants to take.  Hopefully, more adults will start to advocate for the sort of spending this society really needs; that is, spending on renewable energy, convenient mass transit, lowering college tuition rates, hiring librarians/art teachers/elder care specialists, fair wages for labor, and other investments that will give young people other opportunities than going off to war to raise the stock values and revenues of Halliburton, Exxon, and Lockheed Martin.

There's plenty of work to be done in our country and in the rest of the world that doesn't involve dropping depleted uranium and cluster bombs, the destruction of foreign cultures, and brain-washing the youth of America into thinking they are ""serving"" our country by joining our imperial forces.  Our troops are serving corporate elites and the cause of neoliberal economics, we need to be honest about that.

For a deeper understanding of how ""war is a racket"" (to quote General Smedley Butler), see other excellent DVDs like ""Why We Fight"" and ""Iraq for Sale.""

""The ability and inclination to use physical strength is no indication of bravery or tenacity to life.  The greatest cowards are often the greatest bullies.  Nothing is cheaper and more common than physical bravery.  Common experience shows how much rarer is moral courage than physical bravery.

2632459,2,B000HA4WSY,"To me, this documentary is nothing more than fodder for anti-war activists. Whether you're for or against the Iraq war it's hard to see it any other way.

First of all, there's been hundeds of thousands of U.S. soldiers deployed to Iraq since the war began. This documentary takes the experiences of about 10 guys. Very small sample. It's hard to believe this is how most soldiers feel about the war or about what they're doing over there. It seems like they just went out and found soldiers to fit their already-formulated point of view.

Second, this film tries to give the illusion that these soldiers had no choice. Frequently it draws comparisons to Vietnam or WW2, but there's one MAJOR difference that is never mentioned. Those wars sent over young men via a draft. They really did not have a choice. Today's U.S. military comprises a volunteer force. While I definitely feel for these soldiers who are returning from Iraq with lost limbs or post-traumatic stress, they joined the military. Many joined knowing full well they were signing up to be sent into combat in the Middle East.

Third, the film portrays the U.S. military as an evil entity with no compassion for Iraqi civilians. While I do not deny an inordinate amount of Iraqi civilians have been killed in this war, the film tries to paint this as U.S. military strategy and policy. Nowhere does it mention the fact that there are several trials ongoing and sentences that have been handed down against U.S. soldiers for abusing or killing Iraqi civilians. If the makers of this film had even been trying a little bit to be objective, this would have been mentioned somewhere.

If you're already against the Iraq War this documentary is for you. If you're for the war or on the fence, keep in mind you're watching a very biased account. A documentary from the other side could easily be made and give you a completely different sense of the war and the soldiers fighting it.",1161475200,4,1942,4.702941176470588
2632460,5,B000HA4WSY,"In the opening scenes of Patricia Foulkrod's powerful documentary about our questionable military venture in Iraq and its effect on the psyches of the soldiers who fight in it, we're introduced to a number of young soldiers who speak candidly and powerfully about the motivations that led them to join the military. As their stories unfold, we hear their surprised reactions to boot camp and combat training as they were taught to dehumanize their enemy, to ""kill hadjis and ragheads."" Each soldier describes in tight, careful detail their transformation from idealistic civilian to highly-trained killing machine. One soldier states quite bluntly and without sentiment how he watched his own resistance to killing grow weaker and finally fade away as the indoctrination took place. Even more chilling is his later description of looking forward to taking his first human life. ""I'd been trained for it,"" he said, ""and I wanted to do it.""

For most of the soldiers in this movie, their turning points and epiphanies arrive in the shocking moments when their worldview is shattered, when the solid black line between right and wrong suddenly turns to muddy, indistinct gray. In nearly every story, we hear of their complicity in the deaths of innocent men, women and children, people who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. One soldier describes having an old woman in the sights of his rifle and being forced to make a split-second decision as she approached an armored US military vehicle. After firing two rounds himself, he watched in horror as the occupants of the armored vehicle opened fire as well, tearing her to pieces. As she fell to the ground, the soldier saw the white flag in her hand. He tells us that he threw his gun to the ground with tears in his eyes. As another soldier notes, ""It's one thing to replace your worldview with a new one, but another thing entirely to have your worldview shattered and have nothing to replace it with.""

What I found so amazing about this movie was the lack of obvious editorializing. It's a spare, lean movie without obtrusive direction. The soldiers simply tell their powerful stories to the camera. There are virtually no distractions or breaks save for a few brief ""intermissions"" that feature photo montages overlaid with music, and then it's right back to the soldiers. I've read other reviews that complain about the one-sidedness of the film, but what documentary isn't? That's what documentaries do... they present a biased (yet hopefully intelligent) point of view. They're made with bias and the hope that viewers come to embrace, or at least take into account, the point of view presented by the film.

Any good war documentary is made with a clear agenda, and this film's purpose is to show the madness of a war that lacks a clear objective, a notion that seems to have filtered down to the soldiers as well. One soldiers states that most of the soldiers he speaks with have no clear idea of the war's stated mission. ""Something to do with 9/11"" is a common response. Without a clear stated goal, the soldiers adopt the only one that makes any sense to them... kill or be killed. Kill so that you can eventually go home to the ones you love. Kill because if you don't, you're not a good soldier. It's little wonder that they return home with little or no idea how to readjust to civilian life. The Bush administration pitches the conflict in Iraq as part of the larger war on terror, yet the soldiers interviewed tend to see themselves as participants in an escalating body of terror rather than defenders of freedom.

And yet one of the most powerful things about this film is personal passion of the soldiers themselves. Even before we hear each soldier's entire story, we realize that they aren't a bunch of whiners. They are people we feel we can trust. Each was a patriotic young person who stepped forward to do his or her duty. Most went to boot camp with a sense of purpose and pride, and returned home disillusioned with what they learned. In the end, each made a very personal decision how to deal with what they discovered, a decision to either suck it up and put a cap on it, hoping it wouldn't blow, or confront it and be willing to speak the truth, no matter the consequences. The Ground Truth is the story of soldiers coming to terms with the reality of a misguided war, and dealing with their discovery with grace and courage.",1160265600,19,4428,4.724450194049159

As an Iraq and Afghanistan war vet, this movie sickens me.....All the vets in this film are a disgrace to the uniform and those that died on the battlefield.  You should have never enlisted you whiney ass bitches...thats war, deal with it!! Half these turds did one tour, like that fat cry baby Paul Reikhoff....always bitching about the lame ass Reserve unit he was in.  Sad thing is, this movie was made and shown while good, real, strong men were still fighting.  Dont contribute to the BS and whiney crocodile tears this piece of trash presents.",1373587200,2,613,4.5963302752293576

This movies gives real insights into the origins of those problems and allows those of us who care to find ways to help.,1358380800,,246,4.613636363636363
8137816,5,B000HA4WSY,"As a retired mental health professional, and the daughter of a life-long military man,  I have been concerned about the difficulties our troops are having readjusting to civilian life today, I watched this video on Netflix and my eyes were opened even more. The fact that the stories were told by the soldiers themselves had a  real impact and furthered my understanding of the difficulties and their source.  I then purchased several of the DVDs and distributed them among church members.  As we have a dozen or so of our young people serving at the present time, we want to be prepared to understand and help them resolve their difficulties.  I highly recommend this documentary for anyone who wants to get the real facts about what our young people face when returning home.",1355961600,,777,4.81203007518797
8137817,5,B000HA4WSY,"This was one of the last movies I watched with my dad (he died from agent orange caused cancer) it was really intense and I don't really know if it upset him or something. But for me, I heard these stories and was crying within 15 minutes. For a few days after I watched it their voices, and their eyes kept going around and around in my head. These men and women are amazing to me, these people who have everything they thought they knew about their country, the world shattered. But they try build a new way. And the courage it took to get up in front of a camera and tell these stories, that are really personal, and some people never get to the point where they can really talk about the war (my dad spoke very vaguely of his time) and I am just in awe of these people.",1342396800,,773,4.092105263157895
8137818,5,B000HA4WSY,"I KNOW how brutal and wrong the American War in Iraq wa(i)s, intellectually, but this film brings it home. This is a good refresher in the HORROR of American adventurism. For this war was not nobly mounted or intended. ""W"" Bush gave a whole LITANY of implausible excuses for his invasion of a country that never did anything to us, and which didn't present ANY threat, which just prove that he never had any reason to invade at all.

George the 43rd's first excuse was to protect the Iraqi People from that ruthless dictator, Saddam Hussein. But then we caught Hussein and executed him, and the War didn't miss a beat. Then it was WMD, Weapons of Mass Destruction, which were never found. Then it was Al Quaeda, which BTW represents such a loose coalition of like-minded but independent and often undefined groups, tribes, etc., that it could barely be identified, much less defeated.

And when you see what we DID! PROTECT the Iraqi People? HAH! WE, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, AND OUR SOLDIERS, RATHER BECAME THE EPITOME OF EVIL! When you see NUMEROUS incidents of Americans shooting and SLAUGHTERING innocent Iraqi CHILDREN, and civilians everywhere, for no reason at all, and for sport, we know that it was NOT Saddam who was so evil, at least not compared with US.

Then when you see the damage that war has done to American soldiers, many of whom, if not killed outright, might as well have been: grievously injured, their lives destroyed (what are the reproductive prospects of a man with no nose?), and when you understand that at least HUNDREDS of THOUSANDS of perfectly innocent Iraqis suffered the same fates, the cost seems incalculable. And indeed it is. America OWES those people their lives back.

For the United States to put Americans and Iraqis through THAT, for absolutely nothing as far as anyone can tell (doubtless, in reality, in a ham-handed attempt to seize Iraq's oil fields), is obscene to the nth degree. I'd have to say that far from Russia or China or Cuba having ever been the focus of evil in the world, the REAL focus has to be US.

To help to understand the real meaning of the Iraq War, THAT is what this film did for me.",1313107200,,2158,4.638743455497382
8137819,5,B000HA4WSY,"This should be required viewing for ANYONE who is thinking of joining the military! This film shows soilders going in to the service, what they experienced, and what life was like after they came home from the middle east. This is one of the most important films ever made. It goes far beyond what military recruiters and brochures tell you about the military, and it will help anyone who is thinking about joining the military to make a more informed choice about what they are signing up for. It's a big decision that is not to be taken lightly, and this film gives people the information they need about what the military is really all about from all angles and the information is all first hand from soilders themselves.",1254096000,,724,4.62015503875969
