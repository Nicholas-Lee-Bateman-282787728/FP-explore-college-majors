4656288,5,B005D0RDMA,"This was a Christmas present for my Mom, she loves to watch Christmas movies. I haven't watched any of the movies that I've bought off Amazon yet, but she hasn't complained about the quality of them yet so all is good in the world!",1326585600,,231,4.2727272727272725
4656289,5,B005D0RDMA,This was one of my favorite movies. It has a very special meaning in my life Because Id gone through the same things. It has helped me so much. If you don't own this movie check it out.,1324252800,2,185,3.8947368421052633
4656290,1,B005D0RDMA,"The other reviews of this movie were very misleading....it is terrible.  The acting was dreadful, the ridiculous ghost of her husband, and child, though cute, could not act.  Save your money!!",1322956800,4,192,5.161290322580645
4656291,2,B005D0RDMA,"I was expecting a great movie, but the acting was just amateurish at best, often the roles were unbelievable. The story line was OK, although its beginning to be overdone.(a loved one dies, and comes back to help the other get married again)  I guess every director thanks he can do better than its been done before. This director failed.... I guess what I was disappointed in the most was there just wasn't any magic..... not between the Mom and her son, nor any of her boyfriends. This isn't a Great movie as I was expecting, but its not bad either. Just so-so.",1321920000,14,563,4.466019417475728
4656292,1,B005D0RDMA,"A husband dies in a car accident; he stays around as a spirit until his wife releases his death and then it looks like he becomes a star. The ending left one unsure. The whole movie wrestles with life after death. As a person who believes in life after death because Jesus Christ is my personal Savior, I found the theology in this movie to be awful. If you're going to say someone goes to heaven, you need to go to the One who created heaven and who decides who does go. God says if a person believes in His son, Jesus, as Savior, one goes to heaven, not if a person is good or ""believes"" without specifying what one believes in. God says it is the blood of Jesus that washes away sin. If a person doesn't believe this, God allows that, but heaven can only be claimed on God's terms. If theology doesn't matter to you, you might enjoy this movie. The acting isn't too bad. If theology does matter to you, you probably won't enjoy this movie.",1320364800,36,942,4.238888888888889

4656304,4,B005D0RDMA,Wasn't sure what I thought of this on the first watch.  For sure grew on me.  Good movie and a keeper.,1460592000,,102,3.8095238095238093
4656305,4,B005D0RDMA,"This film is better than some and certainly better acted than some.  The product description of the plot seems very off to me.  It was especially bad in its description of the heroine, who's actually a normal woman with strengths and weaknesses, struggling to deal with her feelings over her husband's death.  She's not overly involved in helping others, though she doesn't come off as selfish or completely self-absorbed either.  I like the fact that she makes a strong positive decision at the end and doesn't have to be ""rescued"" by learning that she doesn't have all the facts.",1451692800,,581,4.838383838383838
4656306,5,B005D0RDMA,I saw this on Lifetime on TV and I thought this was a good movie to have.  I like the actors that play in this movie and how it ends.  A great family movie to watch.  A very pretty and Happy movie.,1449878400,,197,3.642857142857143

4656317,5,B005D0RDMA,"This is a very nice, serious movie set at Christmas time.  Tom Chandler and his wife live a very good, happy life; they're devoted to each other and their son, who loves his dad.  The problems begin when Tom is killed in a traffic accident and the two of them are left to fend for themselves.  She has some anger at Tom for leaving them, while her son still talks to dad:  he's still visiting him, though his wife can't see him.  A year later the two of them are still trying to deal with it.

It's not a light-hearted movie, but it is very good, interesting and even compelling most of the way.  I must say that I thought the ending was a little weak, but certainly not enough to cause me to stop watching it.",1423267200,,710,4.138686131386861

4656322,4,B005D0RDMA,"Pretty good movie.  Susan Bell (Jamie Ray Newman) has devoted her life to helping others while rarely thinking about helping herself.  This year the tables will turn when's local radio station takes over her love life after an innocent call from her eight year old son.  Whether she likes it or not, Susan is under the mistletoe.

4656334,3,B005D0RDMA,"A entertaining feel good movie.  We've seen this storyline before, one parent dies and returns to help the other find love again so they can move on, but it is always entertaining to watch.  A little holiday magic, a special love and friendly Christmas angel always play well.  This one holds well.  The Dad is a great guy, the son just wants his Mom to be happy again and between the two (only the son can see his Dad's ghost) they come up with a plan to do so.  The boy gets his Mom's friend at a radio station to get his Mom on a radio version of The Bachelorette to find a match.  Little does she know that special someone has been right in front of her all along.  Worth a watch.",1417564800,,684,4.097744360902255

  It held my attention threw out the movie.  I watched it originally on the Hallmark Channel and enjoyed it so I bought it.

4656362,5,B005D0RDMA,"A favorite holiday movie. I loved the way the son worried about his mom and only wanted her to be happy. Great romantic twist; proves anything can happen, especially when the two main characters met the way they do in the movie. Great acting; I came to totally dislike the 'contest' applicant.  Jamie and Michael Shanks acted well together. I would highly recommend this movie; it has it all, romance, family values, hope for the future and learning to let go. You get a good feeling in the end of the movie.",1384732800,7,508,4.521739130434782

4656376,4,B005D0RDMA,"Nice piece of fantasy, especially when the widow-mom listens to a piano playing while the keys seem to be moving by themselves. When I was in college, I was at a concert grand piano one night in a completely dark music hall playing Rachmaninov's ""Concerto 3,"" when my roommate heard the music but couldn't even see the stage, let alone me and the piano.  He heard an instrument which seemed to be playing all by itself.  I guess that was my favorite fantasy in the video.",1373760000,,471,4.465116279069767

4656380,5,B005D0RDMA,Great movie. Personally I like this movie very much. It is suitable for family or if you like love story.,1367712000,2,105,4.3
4656381,3,B005D0RDMA,The film has a good cast and well done. The story is not portraying the truth of life after death. There is none until the resurrection of the dead at the coming of God for nominal or devout christians.,1362096000,,202,4.205128205128205

4656396,4,B005D0RDMA,"Nice, sweet, enjoyable Christmas movie. Nice to watch as a family. Enjoyed Michale Shanks, he had good chemistry with the child actor. I would recommend this movie to see together with your family, puts you in the holiday mood.",1357430400,,227,4.846153846153846

4656400,3,B005D0RDMA,I am a big fan of Christmas movies that's a fact and this one has a little magic thrown in.  Not to mention the fact that Michael Shanks is one of the stars how could I possibly turn down an opportunity to see that smile.  The story is whimsical and fun and I was very happy to add it to my collection.,1351555200,,302,3.8548387096774195
4656401,2,B005D0RDMA,"This movie is not one I will be keeping.  Ghostly appearances of Dad to a young boy who others think is crazy because he says he talks to his deceased father all the time.  It gets him in trouble at school, etc.  Finally Mom is able to contact her husbands spirit as well.  There is a nice ending to all of this as mom has her son seeing a school counselor who also lost his wife.  The two of them end up together making the boy happy.  To me it was very weird for the deceased father to be around his son all the time.  I guess it depends on what you like in a movie.",1350604800,3,568,3.8448275862068964
4656402,4,B005D0RDMA,"I enjoyed watching this sweet and cute romantic movie. It is similar to Sleepless in Seatle, only with the wife being the widow. Her son enters her in a contest to meet someone, without her consent. I enjoyed this movie very much. The beginning starts out sad, but the movie  does not remain sad. It ends on a happy note. I thought the acting was good. I am not sure why a few reviewers have bashed this one. I recommend giving this a try. I think you will be pleasantly surprised.",1330041600,,481,4.285714285714286
