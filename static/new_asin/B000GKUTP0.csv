8133310,5,B000GKUTP0,Makes you think! Not sure what my believes are however enjoyed this disk.  It's one persons life that seems above the average in that he truly believe in something after! I really don't know??,1363392000,,192,4.647058823529412
8133311,5,B000GKUTP0,Very interesting and accurate.  Good protrayal of a wonderful man who helped so many.  I would recommend to anyone who is interested in psychic abilities and channeling.,1362009600,,169,5.222222222222222
8133312,5,B000GKUTP0,"The interviewees in the program are very knowledgeable of what they are talking about. They have been connected with the late Sleeping Prophet indirectly but closely. They are authors on Edgar Cayce (1877-1945). The Southern accent of the family members is very interesting. An old interview from Cayce's secretary Ms Gladys is also included. Many photos of Cayce seen in this program are a definite plus for the audience. For those who have read much of Cayce, and visited Hopkinsville museum or Virginia Beach A.R.E (Association for Research and Enlightenment), this program may not have anything new to offer, but for others, it offers a wealth of information.

Why this prophet is not nearly as famous as he should be, is an important question. Religious organizations were threatened, especially with Cayce's readings on karma and rebirth. At present, many people in Virginia Beach do not know who Edgar Cayce was. A.R.E is certainly a spiritual place to visit.",1361491200,3,966,5.113924050632911
8133313,1,B000GKUTP0,"Easily one of the worst films I've ever seen. I don't understand how Cayce's story could be turned into such an uninteresting, overly religious pile of trash.",1357603200,,158,4.888888888888889
8133314,5,B000GKUTP0,"Could watch it over and over. Just wish it were longer with more of this amazing mans life story. If you want to know more of this beautiful soul...just read his biography; 'Story of Edgar Cayce: There Is a River, by Thomas Sugrue'. You'll be thankful you did.",1289001600,6,260,4.4375
8133315,5,B000GKUTP0,"I have no words to describe this man other than ""modern day saint.""

It is amazing how common knowledge about him only seems to surround his prophecies and not what he had committed himself to do, which was for the well-being of mankind and ultimately he sacrificed himself to in the end.

Was it an attempt by religious organizations to downplay that which they disagreed?

Watch this, and prepare to be enlightened.

Topics:

* Souls/Spirits
* Use of Hypnosis
* Reincarnation (past lives), Karma (central to the meeting of self), and Grace
* Clairvoyance
* Psychic Powers of Mind Tapping
* Prophecies
* History of Earth
* Misuse of Gifted Powers
* Holistic Healing

Two books that are must reads:

* ""There is a River"" is the authoritative book on his life.
* ""The Edgar Cayce Companion"" is a collection of his reading by topic.  This is more of a reference of key excerpts from all his readings but complete enough to stand on its own.

8133316,5,B000GKUTP0,"This film is a surprisingly well done biopic on Edgar Cayce lovingly produced and with professional level research.  For anyone seeking a very good visualization of Cayce (even after reading more than one of the biographies)
the film takes the viewer into his life and into his extraordinary humanitarian work in the field of the paranormal.",1182816000,16,341,5.089285714285714
