1705261,5,B00006472N,"I'm so glad that Disney finally came to their senses and decided to release this treasure on DVD.  In my opinion, this is one of Disney's best.  Starring Peter Ustinov, Dean Jones, and Suzanne Pleshette, this movie has comedy, action, and no worry of bad language or sex.  Dean Jones plays a track coach who arrives in a new town, one with many tales and mysteries. Jones arrives at a hotel owned by families of pirates who roamed the area hundreds of years ago. The families are giving an auction to save their beloved, historical home from money-grubbing gamblers who tend to turn the hotel into a casino.  When Jones suddenly finds himself bidding on an auction in competition with the football coach, he unwillingly wins a bed-warmer with a story, suposedly coming from Blackbeard the pirate. He soon discovers that he got much more than he bargained for!  This wholesome comedy will keep a smile on your face all the way through, Disney fan or not!",1019779200,21,953,4.682634730538922

1705309,4,B00006472N,"It's a contrast in acting choices that somehow works for this movie. 1968's Blackbeard's Ghost pits everyman Dean Jones against the theatrical Peter Ustinov. Based on the popular 1965 children's novel by Ben Stahl, this one's a boisterous tale of cursed spirits, a pirate's legacy, an unscrupulous casino boss, and an unassuming track coach. Dean Jones's part is the last one. The movie opens with Steve Walker, new track coach to Godolphine college, driving up to Blackbeard's Inn, a small hotel on an isle off the Carolina coast. It's a ramshackle structure, slapped on together with odds and ends.

The Daughters of the Buccaneers operate the inn, this gaggle of pleasant old ladies claiming to be descendants of Blackbeard's bloody crew. The movie is quick to point out the spot of trouble these senior citizens had fallen into. They're desperately trying to pay off the mortgage, this marker having been bought off from the bank by the local gambling kingpin, Silky Seymour (Joby Baker). Steve Walker strolls into the inn only to find a bazaar and an auction what's assembled to raise funds for the Daughters of the Buccaneers.

How did Steve Walker get in the thick of things? Could it be the smashing professor of child psychology, Miss Jo Anne Baker (Suzanne Pleshette), whom Steve was trying hard to impress at the auction? Could it be that Steve was given the room that once belonged to Edward Teach a.k.a. the dread pirate Blackbeard himself? No, what did it was that antique, copper bedwarmer he'd won at the auction.

It's a relic that once belonged to Blackbeard's tenth wife, Aldetha, she who was accused of witchery. As she was being burned at the stake, Aldetha, rumor insists, cursed her husband to languish in limbo ""until such time as there be found in you, most wicked of all villains, some spark of human goodness."" Yeah, she was probably a witch.

Steve Walker scoffs at the old wives' tale. For fun, he even recites an incantation he worms out of that old bedwarmer. ""Kree kruh vergo gebba kalto kree!"" he says with tongue-in-cheek flourish. And, so, Peter Ustinov makes his grand entrance. Heck, it wouldn't have taken much for Ustinov to make a grand entrance. He would've responded to ""Klaatu barada nikto!""

An acclaimed actor of impressive range, Ustinov lends the Disney movie instant prestige. But he's not the only good egg in this bunch. Frankly, I usually gravitate more towards Dean Jones, Disney's perennial leading man. He's just more relatable. He plays the straight man to Ustinov's broad behavior. Ustinov turns in a, er, spirited performance and is darn entertaining with his one-man pantomime and the colorful jibber-jabber he gets to spout. He gets to zing Jones' character, referring to him as a ""shingly little bean rake with the shakes and the whispers"" while the best Jones can muster up is to call him a rummy. Of course, Jones is the only one who can see the bellicose phantom. Of course, everyone else thinks he's bonkers.

It's 106 minutes of raucous family fun. Blackbeard's shade is a far cry from the grotesque freebooters shown in The Pirates of the Carribean. Ustinov fails utterly to cut a menacing figure, not that that was ever his or the film's intention. Jones and Pleshette are fine romantic leads and how they go about their balmy courtship is effortlessly appealing. But it's Ustinov's show all the way. There's much in Blackbeard's Ghost that parallel 1944's The Canterville Ghost, in plot and humor and in the apparition's exaggerated comportment. I would've loved for Ustinov and Charles Laughton to act in the same scene. It would've been an embarassment of over-acting and accusations of scene-stealing furiously flying. Anyway, it's obvious that Ustinov is having a fine old time.

As Godolphin's new track coach, Steve Walker has got his work cut out for him. His track team has sucked so mightily there's been thought to doing away with the sport, except Godolphin has competed in the Broxton Relays for the past 63 years. The alumni is willing to give track & field one last try. Luckily for Steve, Edward Teach is on it. Some of the most overt gags in the movie involve Blackbeard's, uh, influencing the track team to victory.

When it came out in 1968, the visual gags and special effects were considered clever and eye-popping. Today, they are dated stuff. But Ustinov is an irresistible force that'll drag you grinning in his wake. See the well-meaning revenant disrupt lives and cheat and spook his way out of an eighteenth century curse. The showdown at the casino had me in stitches. Two words: finger guns! This is a seriously goofy movie.",1505433600,,4620,4.876433121019108

1705367,4,B00006472N,"Disney may have the most impressive animated film record, but their live action film reputation is kind of spotty. They have some enduring classics with the likes of Mary Poppins, Pollyanna, The Parent Trap and Treasure Island to name a few, some moderate classics like The Absent Minded Professor, Son of Flubber, The Love Bug, The Shaggy Dog, Computer Who Tennis Shoes and many other cornball family comedies from a simpler time, but they also have some really horrible films as well. Even some of these semi-classics have lost some of their charm over the years.

Blackbeard's Ghost falls into the semi-classic category, it isn't a true classic, but it's certainly a moderate one that many, including myself, have fond memories of. The set up is a bit different on this one, but the results are very similar to what you'll find in many other Disney comedies from the time. Outlandish fantasy plot, then wackiness ensues.

Blackbeard's Ghost like most of Disney's live action films has gotten the shaft when it came to home video releases. Washed out, battered prints with little to no care extended to them for home video, no bonus features and just all around shabby efforts from a studio known for excellence. The original DVD release of this film was terrible like so many others from the company.

The good news is that Blackbeard's Ghost has made its Blu Ray debut and Disney has done a pretty decent job with it. The film looks great in high definition, with a clarity that I doubt it has ever had. 99% of the film looks as good or better than I expected (or hoped). The intro however looks very grainy, but it isn't Disney's laziness, it looks to be inherent to the footage of the film stock.the title and credit text look clear, but the ship on the night sea is quite blurry and grainy. Fortunately as soon as the opening credits end so does the appalling looking video concerns.

The film itself looks really good and I could not detect a speck of dirt in the film. There are one or two close ups of the jolly captain that look grainy, but they only last a few seconds and once again it is inherent to the film not the lack of care from Disney. This is one of Disney's grey area family films, there is a boozing captain driving a motorcycle, not typical Disney cornball stuff, but thank goodness they didn't see reason to delete such innocent nonsense for the overly sensitive.

Unfortunately that is where the care ends, the film is all we get on this semi-classic. No trailer, no nuthin'! This seems to be a growing trend with Disney and many other companies for that matter. Bonus material is being trimmed to a minimum and I am not happy bout that. I still own many of my earlier DVD releases because the bonus material quite frankly puts their Blu Ray counter parts to shame. DVD's with hours upon hours of worthy and interesting extras. If someone at Disney is reading this, WE CARE and if you want home video to thrive then we must be given something for our hard earned money, if not, everyone will just stream movies and for go cluttering up their houses with subpar releases that seem to shrink in quality with every release.

My rant aside, this is by far the best release of Blackbeard's Ghost on home video and I doubt we will ever see a better one, if you're looking to own this film, this is the way to go.",1491868800,,3333,4.528239202657807

1705389,5,B00006472N,"Another winner from Disney. Blackbeard's Ghost is both spooky (this is Disney spooky we're talking about here- no blood no guts just good clean spooky) and funny. The film takes place in North Carolina where the daughters of the buccaneers own and run a hotel. The hotel is not just any hotel, but it is Blackbeard's ship. The film begins when the new Godolphin College track coach Steve Walker (Dean Jones) arrives into town to get a room at the inn. On this night that he arrives, there is a charity auction and bazzar to raise money for the women who run and own the place, because their lease is about to be taken from under them if they don't get $38,000 within the next week or so. When Steve accidentally bids on an item, he returns it to his room and finds an ancient inscription inside, said to be from one of Blackbeard's wives, who was a witch. Steve repeats the incantation and suddenly the ghost of Blackbeard appears (Peter Ustinov) with a curse upon him that cannot be lifted until he does a good deed, he's stuck with Steve..except Steve's the only one who can see him. With the track team needing a serious boost, the daughters of the buccaneers needing big money and Blackbeard wanting to be free, can everything work out?

The descendants of the pirate Blackbeard all elderly ladies own his old place and a vicious gangster bought the mortgage and wants to foreclose for his own nefarious reasons. Along comes Dean Jones who recites a spell and conjures up Blackbeards ghost which has been cursed to limbo until he does a good deed.

The setting is New England in a small town.  Blackbeard is a Ghost because his wife was a Witch and put a curse on him.  He wanders in a limbo until he performs a good deed.  Dean Jones is the new track coach at a college and meets Suzanne Pleshette who is a professor on the faculty.

That being said, it is still a movie that can be enjoyed by kids as well. It is a movie that is part of my Halloween family film rotation along with 'Hocus Pocus', 'Monster House', 'Nightmare Before Christmas' and 'Casper' among others.

The story is simple - a new college track coach (played by 60's/70's Disney favorite Dean Jones) arrives in the town of Goldolphin, a sleepy Atlantic coastal village famous (in the film) for being settled by Blackbeard the pirate shortly before he was killed off the coast in sea battle. In short order and by an odd set of circumstances, the Coach becomes haunted by the ghost of Blackbeard (played marvelously by Peter Ustinov), who was cursed in life by his fifth wife Aldetha who was a witch, and is doomed to languish in limbo until such a time that he exhibits an act of true and unsolicited ""goodness"" which would free him from his curse and reunite him with his ghostly crew in the afterlife. What ensues is standard Disney comedy fare from that era. Where the movie really excels however is how the love/hate relationship between the two main stars. It is the Odd Couple with a ghost. A great film with a solid story and great ambiance and atmosphere.

Now, the DVD transfer is probably the worst I've ever seen (I'm not kidding, it's downright awful). I once owned this on VHS and I swear it looked better on tape than it does on this DVD. Disney gets a huge fail on this release. Definitely a slap to the face of everyone involved in this film. Now I'm not expecting a full AFI-level restoration here, but that being said, clean up the source material a little bit. It almost seems as if they transferred it from an old, gritty master tape and burned it to a DVD-R. Not what I was expecting from Disney who are usually pretty good about this sort of thing.",1471910400,7,1958,4.481792717086835

You cans see two border lines that cut off alot of the outside borders of the film making some of the actors halfway out of frame. I'm hoping for a widescreen version of this film, but I may not bother because the only good part of the film is the trackmeet anyway.",1471305600,,372,4.253521126760563

1705558,4,B00006472N,"Peter Ustinov (Blackbeard) and Dean Jones (a track coach) provide fun in this classic live action Disney affair.

(SPOILERS) Imagine this...a new track coach comes to town to start work at the local community college, which has always lived under the shadow of overpowering, huge ""State University.""  He has little to work with, and gets even less respect.  Since he's new to town he stays at the only place he can find, an inn run by a group informally known as the Daughters of Blackbeard.  He accidentally buys an ancient bedwarmer at an auction and discovers an old document in the hollow handle.  It has strange wording inscribed on it and when he repeats the words Blackbeard's Ghost appears.  Blackbeard, it turns out, is unable to find peace or rest until he does a good deed.

It's really fun watching Ustinov strut around in his pirate garb, and watching to see how he helps out his new, um, friend?!  Anyway, most of the movie is pure Disney live action formula...there is the conflict between the large university and the small college, there are two suiters vying for the attention of a beautiful woman (Suzanne Pleshette, in this case), and scheming gangsters who are trying to get their mitts on the old ladies' home so they can turn it into a casino.

Will the good guy get the girl?  Will the small college finally beat State?  Will the gangsters be thwarted?  Will Blackbeard eventually find peace?

One last thing...the special effects are of course highly dated, but still fun. There is plenty of slap-stick as well.

Come on, it's Disney.

Good clean fun = 5 stars
Formulaic plot = 3 stars
Fun actors = 4-5 stars
Dated effects = 3 stars

4 stars overall.  Even so, I'm glad this is in our collection.",1452038400,,1721,4.645695364238411

1705702,4,B00006472N,"Supposedly a ruthless villain, Blackbeard, as played by Peter Ustinov, is more a petulant child than the bloodthirsty legend most people would associate with the name.  He pouts, drinks himself into a stupor, meddles, and finally has to be coerced into doing a good deed to break the spell the holds him in limbo.  It should be noted that the ""good"" deed amounts to cheating and unsportsmanlike conduct during a track meet, more cheating later with a rigged roulette table (requiring all parties cheat to their own ends).  No one's conscience is grieved in the process.  The track meet shenanigans reminded me of another Disney film, The World's Greatest Athlete.

The plot involves a track coach (Dean Jones as Steve Walker) who isn't welcomed into the community with open arms.  The Dean of Godolphin (Richard Deacon) doesn't want him, the football coach thinks he's a waste of time, another professor (Suzanne Pleshette as Jo Anne Baker) wants to `study' him and his peculiar behavior once he's caught chatting with a ghost only he can see.  At the same time, a thug (Joby Baker as Silky Seymour) wants to throw a bunch of old ladies out of Blackbeard's Inn, which he wants for a gambling establishment.  Everyone is working at cross purposes once the track coach discovers a book of spells hidden in the handle of a bed warmer reputed to have belonged to Aldetha, one of Blackbeard's less fortunate wives (she was burned for witchcraft), thus releasing the old reprobate.

Elsa Lanchester makes the most of her supporting role as one of the Daughters of the Buccaneers (and part-time palm reader).

It's a lightweight comedy that hasn't been lovingly preserved on DVD by Disney.",1421712000,,1682,4.890845070422535

Both of them support the activities that 'Blackbeard' involves himself in, trying to do a good deed and return to the supernatural side to 'rest in peace'.  The co-ordinative interactions with the supporting actors and Disney's technical crew, keep the movie going.  Peter was the perfect choice at the period of time the movie was made, with his moderate, happy personality showing up while he's playing Blackbeard.

1705976,5,B00006472N,"I love the Disney family movies of the 50s-70s.  This one is one of the very best, and my favorite along with Snowball Express.  (Both star Dean Jones.)  Dean Jones plays a track coach named Steve Walker who arrives in (fictional) Godolphin, North Carolina, for his new job.  On his first night in the town, he stays at Blackbeard's hotel by the coast where Blackbeard died, run by old ladies descended from Blackbeard's crew.  He unintentionally summons Blackbeard from ""limbo"", Blackbeard having been unable to have eternal rest until there be found in him some goodness.  The misadventures of Steve Walker and Blackbeard create some of the most delightful moments I have ever experienced on the screen.  Peter Ustinov electrifies the screen with his portrayal of Blackbeard, which I think is Academy Award-worthy.  The shenanigans he pulls create many problems but also many solutions, and he ultimately must prove his worth by saving ""the little old ladies"" from being thrown out for not being able to pay the mortgage.  A crook named Silky Seymour wants to take their land for a casino, and Blackbeard must help Coach Walker stop Mr. Seymour.

The casting is Disney's usual fine standard.  Besides Ustinov and Dean Jones, the romantic pairing of Dean Jones with Suzanne Pleshette is perfect, their 2nd of 3 Disney pairings.  (The other two were The Ugly Dachsund and The Shaggy D.A.)  The other casting, down to every bit part, is also very good.  The little parts make the movie just as much as Blackbeard does, because how funny would Blackbeard be able to be if the world was filled with flat characters?  Many of the comic moments come from the fact that only Coach Walker can see Blackbeard, so everyone else sees Walker acting delusional and talking to someone who's not there, or looking the wrong way when talking, though they also see Blackbeard's crazy actions and are puzzled by things moving in the air.  There are many clever lines of dialogue in the movie, too.  It is an excellent script.  I only wish the Disney company had done a better transfer to DVD.  But it's alright; nothing can hurt the enjoyment of one of my very favorite movies!!!",1386028800,3,2162,4.8102981029810294

Seems that Blackbeard's decedents including Emily Stowecroft (Elsa Lanchester) are about to lose their heritage to an unscrupulous gangster. Steve would like to help them also, again in an honorable fashion. Steve whom is full of high morals accidently conjures Blackbeard's Ghost (Peter Ustinov). The ghost has a different take on life. Yet he needs to change his wicked ways if he is ever to get out of limbo.

The fun part of the movie is watching the interaction between Steve and Captain Blackbeard. What is funnier is that only Steve can see Blackbird so what could be a love interest between Steve and School psychiatrist Jo Anne Baker (Suzanne Pleshette) may be in jeopardy.

This looks like a direct transferee form a video. It is in 1.33:1 Full Screen format and fuzzy around the edges. However, the film is so much fun you will not care.

The big surprise though was how much my six year old daughter enjoyed it, laughing out loud like a banshee several times.  I think that's the first time she's done that when we've watched a film together, and believe me we've been through a whole library. Perhaps it was because of the somewhat sinister opening, which may have frightened her a bit and built up the expectation of some nasties to follow, when in fact the comedy comes on stream instead. So perhaps she was laughing out of relief.  Or perhaps it was just the excellent performance of Mr. Ustinov, a fine comic actor with wonderful delivery and timing.  I wouldn't personally describe it as a hilarious film, but it does have some great set pieces such as the field sports scenes where the ghost helps hopeless Godolphin on to victory.

Unistov as Blackbeard, it seems that people don't know how to have fun
anymore nowadays. I think that's the reason why I never saw many
excellent comedies like that anymore. I love to see a great piece in the
big screen, one of those who give us some reflection of life, some
outstanding lines, epic portrayals of great men of our history and
everything. But I also LOVE to strike a great laugh as well! And this
movie delivers!! You just blow your head off of laughing, from the very
beginning 'till the very end! The jokes are some of the best of all
times!! Every single frame of this movie is a turbulence of nonstop
laughing!! I just can't find words to say something bad about this
movie, I mean it.

How can one not give a single good laugh after seeing Blackbeard (Peter
Unistov) put Steve Walker (Dean Jones) into trouble with a police
officer? Or even, in the olympics where Blackbeard helps poor Godolphin
team to win, specially when he messes up with the final competition,
where he confuses every other runner simply using a hot-dog, a flag and
a bottle of rum! THIS FOLKS, IS HOW EVERY COMEDY MOVIE SHOULD BE MADE!!
I mean it! This is first class comedy! I first saw this movie when I
had 8 years. I'm 26 now. And I continue to love this as much as I loved
when I was a boy.

This is, without a doubt a 5 star movie! And even giving this 5 stars is
not enough, because it deserves much more! Perhaps, shouting the magic
words (kree kru vergo gebba kalto kree) out loud can make some other
picture like that appears around. While this isn't happen, get this one

Walker finds an old parchment and reads the words on it.  The words release Blackbeard's ghost from the limbo he was trapped in, but his ghost is visible only to Jones.

The hilarity of this movie plays on the more humorous parts of movies about invisible people.  Blackbeard can move objects but no one can harm him.  Blackbeard decides to try and do a good dead in order to move on to the next life, and the victim of his attempts at good deeds is Steve Walker.  Blackbeard's mayhem follows Steve wherever he goes, much to the amusement of the audience.  Virtually every scene that Peter Ustinov appears in is funny.  Indeed, Ustinov probably could have made the movie without his co-stars, but having Dean Jones as a victim of Blackbeard's good deeds likely made the script easier to write.

Blackbeard is a caricature of a carousing pirate, which means that he drinks and speaks of moderately uncouth things.  I wondered whether parents should exclude small children from watching this film.  I think that the cartoonish nature of Blackbeard and the fun he has are more charming than threatening and parents can always explain that ghostly pirates can do the things Blackbeard does, but not real people.  Thus, I think even small children will find some humor in Blackbeard.

This movie is less than perfect, but I keep watching it.  Jones has appeared in many Disney movies, but this one is one of his better appearances.  Jones and Pleshette have also appeared together in several Disney films, and the chemistry between the two was at its best in this film.  I am unable to say enough positive things about Peter Ustinov.  Ustinov is a brilliant and natural actor who hams it up in a way that makes Blackbeard's ghost his own.  Fans of pirate movies, Peter Ustinov, Suzanne Pleshette, Disney Movies, Dean Jones, and Elsa Lanchester should have this movie in their collection.

The movie has got it all; swashbuckling pirates, ancient curses, goofy antics and schemes, awkward guy trying to get the self assured girl, and lots of old time Disney movie comfort factor-you know, the kind of movie you just feel really good after watching.

1706180,4,B00006472N,"As usual for a Disney release, there are no extras and the print quality leaves something to be desired.  Also, the plot, about the ghost of the famous pirate being brought back from purgatory to perform a good deed, is a bit coy and silly.  But Peter Ustinov, full of side-wise wit and under-handed sexiness, plays Bluebeard, and that makes it worth the ride.  And truth be told, he has a very good foil in the under-rated Dean Jones, whose exasperation at the supernatural intrusion into his already-hectic life is almost as funny as Ustinov's, er, intruding.  Alas, Suzanne Pleshette, she of the sexy growl and the sultry eyes, is given little to do in the movie, even as Jones' love interest (it would have been a lot more fun to see her paired up with Ustinov--kiss your ""G"" rating goodbye).

There's also the usual covey of accomplished character actors on display, particularly Elsa Lanchester as Jones' landlady, who's trying to defend her property from gangsters trying to turn it into an off-coast casino, and the script and direction, by several of the folks involved with MARY POPPINS, ensure that the pace is brisk and the amusing banter is plentiful.

1706183,4,B00006472N,"First off let me say that this review is on the VHS version of the movie.  I was hoping to purchase the DVD that would correct the problems evident in the VHS.  It appears that the problems have remained..grateful to all those reviewers who saved me from buying just another format of the same problems.  It seems that Disney just copied the the film exactly like the VHS nothing more. By the way, that is one of the great benefits of Amazon reviewing...it hopefully prevents us from wasting money.  The problem now is how to rate it..a 5 star movie on a 2 star format.  Perhaps it was a money issue with Disney...they felt that the effort wasn't worth the return.  Whatever the reason it is really a corporate shame to treat this movie so poorly.

The movie is one of those old Disney family fares that conveys the magic of the Disneyland when Walt was running the show.  It stars the great Peter Ustinov who carries the movie and lights up the screen with his humor and presence.  He has so many great lines of pirate seafaring dialogue that is a treat to hear(no swearing). He plays off of Dean Jones, who by the way does a great job himself as the College coach who unwittingly releases Blackbeard from limbo..between heaven and hell.  Blackbeard now has to do a  good deed to be set free to his just reward...'Help an old lady across the street? That's silly!"".  The movie is typical Disney's formulaic as they try to help Blackbeard's descendants save the old boarding house.  Suzanne Pleshette stars as the romantic interest and several of the standard Disney stock players fill in the rest.  My favorite scene is when Ustinov and Jones lock arms and head off to take on Silky and the Boys singing a revised version of ""Heart of Oak"" to be joined by Pleshette..""I'm not letting you go in there alone"".  No CGI's here but lots of physical comedy and a great performance by Ustinov.

Here's hoping Disney can get their act together and tranfers this movie in widescreen..getting the aspect ratio right..as it deserves.  Even if for nothing more than letting the younger generation enjoy the work of the great Peter Ustinov.",1154563200,7,2128,4.6021220159151195

Yet another example of Disney's continued money-grubbing tactics at the expense of the consumer -->The recent ""Dumbo BigTop Edition"" is another example of consumer exploitation.

The technical quality of the ""BlackBeard"" release is dismal. The print that the DVD transfer was struck from is worn and tired. The video transfer appears to be a relatively unsupervised analog dump: even if this one print was the only surviving element, more care and an investment of a little cash, would have provided the consumer with much better product. Also to be considered, is the respect due to our film heritage. This film is not among AFI's top 100, nor does it deserve that ranking. What it does deserve is at least a nod in the direction of nostaligia and fun!  Many of us grew up with a certain mouse, in a wonderful world.

1706185,4,B00006472N,"Disney comedy staple Dean Jones stars as Steve Walker, the well-grounded and highly principled new track coach for little Godolphin college, located all too unfortunately near the resting place of Edward Teach, AKA Blackbeard the Pirate! Coach Walker arrives in the quaint harbor town, coincidentally enough, on the same night as a charity auction for the ""Daughters of the Buccaneers"" is being held to save their historic home from being turned into an upscale casino by local shady businessman Silky Seymour. In an attempt to capture the favor of fellow faculty member Jo Anne Baker (Suzanne Pleshette) and defy the threat-making Silky, Coach Walker soon finds himself the owner of an antique bed warmer, formerly the property of one of Blackbeard's wives, a vengeful witch who cast a spell over the old cutthroat to suspend his ghost in limbo until some shred of human decency could be found in his soul. When Steve discovers the witch's spell book and invokes the spirit of Edward Teach, he quickly learns that finding decency in the rascally pirate will be no easy task, but the pair concoct a scheme to use the college's struggling track team and the local gambling establishment to save the ""little old ladies"" and their mortgage, and in turn, save the soul of ""Blackbeard's Ghost!""

""Blackbeard's Ghost"" is one of those fantastic family laugh-fests from the heyday of Disney comedies. Dean Jones is in top form, as usual, and his chemistry with Suzanne Pleshette is so strong that there's no wonder why Disney paired the two so often, always with fantastic results! Of course, the real star of this film is the legendary Peter Ustinov, whose mischievous, teddy bear take on the bloodthirsty Captain Blackbeard makes this a comedy that can be watched over and over again! Though the high ideals of Jones' character seem to get left in the lurch in a film that saves the day through gambling, and cheating at that, it's all in good fun and only the bad guys get taken for a ride! Joby Baker, Elsa Lanchester, and Richard Deacon round out the cast with terrific character performances. For fans of old-school Disney comedy, this is a five star affair. This DVD edition, on the other hand, leaves much to be desired, bringing the over all score down at least one notch. There are no extras to be found, and the film is presented in a disappointing full-screen with plenty of picture flaws. Nevertheless, the image is as watchable as it ever was on the Disney Channel, and the movie itself is a necessity for any Disney fanatic's film library.

Not even Some outakes, gallery stuff, theatrical trailers, behind the scenes, or interviews.

FILM REVIEW - 5 stars
A new college track coach arives in the seaside fisshing village of Godolphin and accidentaly summons the ghost of infamous pirate Captain Blackbeard Teach. The pirate turns out to be full of mischief and trouble. In order to earn some eternal rest he helps the coach win the big meet, outfox some gangsters, and win the heart of his girl. This film has comedy, romance, action, drama, and some supernatural hijinks.

BEHIND THE SCENES: This project had been approved to go into production by Walt after reading the book by Ben Stahl. Released in theatres on February 8, 1968 it had been in production while Walt was alive (he passed away in 1967). Directed by Robert Stevenson, one of Disney's most favorite and prolific directors, who had directed some of their best movies of all time including ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"", ""That Darn Cat!"", ""Herbie the Love Bug"", ""Swiss Family Robinson"", ""Old Yeller"", ""Kidnapped"", ""Mary Poppins"", ""The Absent-Minded Professor"", and many more.

Dean Jones as the guy that brings back the ghost, Suzanne Pleshete co-stars as the girl he falls for. Their chemistry is really good together and they also teamed up to make ""The Ugly Dachsund"" for Disney, another great movie. Blackbeard is played perfectly and to rave reviews by Peter Ustinov. It is a bit longer than most Disney comedies at 107 minutes. The film did very well at the box office and was re-released in theatres in 1976. It aired on the ""Wonderful World of Disney"" television show in 1982. It was released on video for the first time in 1982, and again in 1990.

Trivia: If you ride the ""Pirates of the Carribbean"" attraction at Disneyland, there is a painting of Blackbeards Ghost (Peter Ustinov) at the place near the end of the ride where the pirates died trying to take out their loot uphill. It was an idea of imagineer Tony Baxter during a recent rehab of the ride.",1043712000,7,2567,4.5816993464052285

Only half or even as little as one third of the actors face is visible.  Very annoying to watch.  Another glitch is the audio.  For some reason the audio is terribly low on this DVD.  Usually DVD sound is crystal clear and sometimes in surround sound, however, while watching the movie I had to raise the audio on my television to a very high setting just to hear it.

I had been looking forward to it's release on DVD as the print I had on VHS was so terrible, I felt surely that the DVD would offer a better print (and based on the quality of the prints on the recently-released Vault Disney titles I had purchased, I felt even more assured that it would).  I was sooooo disappointed today when I received my copy of Blackbeard's Ghost.  Of all of the DVDs I have purchased from a name studio, this has to be the worst I have ever seen.  The print used seems to be the same as the one used for the old VHS I have.  The picture contrast is terrible. The print itself is full of scratches and blemishes and the picture is very grainy.  Worst of all it is presented in full screen (I seem to remember reading it would be widescreen when it was first announced), which leaves parts of the picture lopped off.  An example of this is when Dean Jones' character is talking to a student while driving and the right half of Jones' face is missing while the left half of the student's is gone.  The biggest example of the low quality of the print used is the opening titles.  Since the film was not presented in widescreen (although it wouldn't have been too wide, I'm sure), the opening credits are ""squished"" up, with the picture being presented slightly off-center, leaving about a 1 1/2 inch black space up the left side of my screen.

Disney had the first special effects that truly looked magical.  You must remember this is before cgi and therefore quite impressive!",1522972800,,422,4.901408450704225

No special features, unfortunately, but if you are a big fan of this movie, like I am, it is a totally worthy buy!",1517788800,,255,4.795454545454546
