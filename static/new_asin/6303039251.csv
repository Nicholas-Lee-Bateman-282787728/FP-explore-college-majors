540835,4,6303039251,"I was ask by Amazon.com to give my review for this video. This video is an Mr Robeson's excellent form of acting.  It is so exciting to see beautiful Afro-American women dancing and singing in one of his movie. Mr Robeson,was before his time. Coming from a talented family,you can see were he getts his talent from.

Robeson was born in Princeton, New Jersey. His father, William Drew Robeson I, ran away from a North Carolina plantation where he had been born a slave; he later graduated from Lincoln University (Pennsylvania) and became a church minister. His mother, Maria Louisa Bustill, came from an abolitionist Quaker family . Paul's four siblings included: William Drew Robeson, a physician who practiced in Washington, D.C.; Benjamin Robeson, a minister; Reeve Robeson (called Reed); and Marian Robeson, who lived in Philadelphia. In 1915, Paul graduated with honors from Somerville High School in Somerville, New Jersey, where he excelled academically and participated in singing, acting, and athletics.

When you view his acting in this video you will see his inheritance of intelligence. I watched this video 4 times in a row.  This is the best !

Here is a set that is more historically important than aesthetically interesting or artistically elegant (with the exception of Borderline).  It is nice to see Criterion put out a set (like the Monsters and Madmen collection) that is not director focused.  Paul Robeson is such a captivating character that he (usually) rises above the flawed material he is in.  It is interesting how music made way into most of his films even when it seemed out of context of the movie.  His philosophy of getting early roles for Black work fell way to good roles for African American or nothing at all which is why he stopped acting in the early 40s.

The Emperor Jones (1933): A strong characterization from Robeson (reprising his stage role from Eugene O'Neill's play) as a power hungry and conniving Pullman porter who eventually becomes emperor of a Caribbean island.  Dated and a lot of racist language that has been cut out for past edits of the film, but the movie is still interesting to watch.  The first two-thirds of the film are so strongly presented by Robeson that his eventual collapse seems unconvincing.  Jones is a good early example of an anti-hero.  One scene with a lover of Jones refuses the money he gives her after breaking up, but she eventually picks it up reminds me of the similar scene in Spike Lee's ""Do The Right Thing"".  Excellent commentary by Jeffrey C. Stewart, Professor of History and Art History at George Mason University and author of Paul Robeson: Artist and Citizen, who discusses the context, mise en scenes, actors and comparisons to the stage play.  He does not discuss too many biographical details of Robeson though.

Body and Soul (1925): so far the only film I've seen by Oscar Micheaux in one of four extant silent films from this director.  Robeson is decent in this silent-film (Robeson's first film) playing two different characters of Isaiah T. Jenkins and his better brother (though he is stiff in his performance).  This movie is a strong commentary on the hypocritical aspects of religious leadership.  This movie does make you wonder if the mother could have been ignorant enough to ignore the daughter and her cries against the pastor.  I wonder if the ending was considered clich then because it is certainly now though it could have been the fault of the many edits that were forced upon Micheaux to get this film played.  This is discussed in the good commentary by Micheaux author/historian Pearl Bowser.  She also discusses a variety of topics including the ""Race"" movies of the time, Micheaux during this time and the actors that are in the film.

Borderline (1930): Beautiful use of editing and montage (Criterion labels this as Eisensteinian) in this film about an interracial love affair (including Robeson's wife Eslanda) and its consequences.  There is not much use of intertitles so it forces you to concentrate on the performances and the particular meanings of each countenance.  Paul Robeson is not the focal point of the film.  Too bad Kenneth Macpherson did not make another film.

Sanders of the River (1935): this film is embarrassing especially for Robeson who still puts in a strong performance.  It is a very pro-British imperialistic film.  Some beautiful footage of Africa though (mentioned in the extras that several hours were taken).

Jericho (1937):  Robeson's had more artistic control (especially how he worked the end and his characters became more utopian and less realistic) but I the film is a bit too simplistic and ends up a little dated -- though still entertaining.  Roberson plays Cpl. Jericho Jackson a top notch military man who saves several men but kills a superior.  This forces him to go AWOL where he eventually becomes an important leader to Bedouin in northern Africa.  It does a nice job to juxtapose the stereotypical black/white duo with comic relief played by Henry Wilcoxon.

The Proud Valley (1940): slow moving idealistic tale of Welsh coal mineworkers (wayward American played by Robeson does make the coal choir club though) during WWII.  Proud Valley deals with the dangers of coalminers but more with the Welsh spirit of continuing life even after a calamity (the mine collapsed and the miners had to fight the government to get it back running again).  Heartwarming, but ultimately its ending is too naive.  An early Ealing production.

Native Land (1942): very biased pro-union film (the union appears almost as a perfect solution) that reminds me of Michael Moore's work.  The characters are so one-dimensional and so extremely polarized that the film seems an exercise in finding the logical fallacies.  Paul Robeson does the voice-over well though with his booming, brilliant baritone/bass voice in this quasi-documentary.

The extras are good especially the Academy award winning short ""Paul Robeson: Tribute To An Artist"" (1979), but are far from complete; not much is made on his pro-Stalin comments (especially the written eulogy for Stalin published in the New World Review, April, 1953).  It would have been nice if Criterion put out Robeson's last film ""Tales of Manhattan"" with this set.  I am interested in reading his son's (Paul Robeson Jr.) main book on his father, The Undiscovered Paul Robeson, An Artist's Journey, 1898-1939, where he does talk about Paul's career, his political troubles and his long-term affair with an actress.  Paul Robeson Jr. was instrumental in getting this set together.  This set is long overdue because other than his rendition of ""Ol Man River"" for ""Show Boat"" much of Paul Robeson's legacy has been forgotten because of age and political persecution in the 50s.",1187308800,28,5652,4.993589743589744
540837,4,6303039251,"Robeson, the title character, is set magnificently amongst and against a cast of often excellent and no less than competent colleagues. He runs through the range of emotions, showing sensitivity, rage, disillusion, tenderness, savagery, gloating - such a great actor, and fine singer of the few songs made available to him here.

Highly recommended - viewers may need to make due allowance for the age of the film, with some slight blasting in the soundtrack, and an occasional flicker in the otherwise very clean and clear transfer.

This is a very powerful viewing experience indeed.",1128556800,,585,5.147368421052631
540838,1,6303039251,"This movie is absurd and unrealistic in its presentation of African American human beings.

540839,4,6303039251,"The film creaks with age.  It's a low-budget project that probably had a small audience in its day, but here is a treasure.  Letting the sound track and the fuzzy images get in your way will only rob the viewer of a great theatrical experience. And, to witness Paul Robson sing and perform at the height of his career only enriches the experience.  Too bad a serious restoration of this film has not been undertaken.",1053734400,11,416,4.52
540840,3,6303039251,"Playwright Eugene O'Neill's early work often combined memorable characters and stories with social commentary and innovative theatrical concepts--and among his first great successes was THE EMPEROR JONES, which starred perhaps the single finest black actor of the 1920s and 1930s, the legendary Paul Robeson.  When United Artists purchased the screen rights, Robeson went with the package, and this 1933 film was the result.
The story concerns a black man of the depression era who lacks the moral stamina to resist the various temptations set before him, and who ultimately finds himself on a remote island where he uses his superior intellect and physically intimidating presence to set himself up as ""Emperor.""  But his own past troubles have hardened him.  Instead of ruling in justice, he uses his position to bleed the population--and they revolt against him.
But regretfully, this film isn't half as good as it could have been or a quarter as good as it should have been.  On the stage, THE EMPEROR JONES had tremendous irony, for in so crushing his subjects Brutus Jones has essentially recreated the white American society that crushed him.  Moreover, the staging was uniquely powerful, with the vast majority of the story played out as Jones runs through the jungle in an effort to escape his revolting subjects, all the while recalling the various events of his life that led him to the present moment.  But the film version pretty much throws all of this out the window, preferring to downplay O'Neill's social commentary and reducing Jone's race through the jungle to a few scenes at the film's conclusion.
Robeson is a memorable actor, but he was still very new to the screen when this film was made, and although he is powerful his performance here is rather stagey in comparison with his later screen work.  And while the film is occasionally interesting in a visual way, it simply doesn't have the courage to go all the way with O'Neil's origial vision.  Fans of Robeson, O'Neil, and early 1930s film will find it an interesting failure, but most others should give it a miss.

540841,4,6303039251,"Unfortunately, we are left with a relative paucity of Robeson's powerful talent. This early film will give you some indication of the majesty he must have conveyed live. No other figure in the first half of the 20th century conveyed the collective black consciousness as did Robeson. We have a few markers left us, amongst them the recordings and these few celluloid records. If you want to see one of the giants of the 20th century on film, buy this edition. It also represents a cinemataographic record of one of O'Neill's most famous, but least successful plays. True, the plot has its tensions and the play had its merits, but, in comparison to his monumental ""Morning Becomes Electra"" and ""Desire Under the Elms,"" this play is decidedly secondary, in league with ""The Hairy Ape.""",1026864000,11,784,4.858208955223881

540843,5,6303039251,"This movie is dark, eerie and fascinating, as it outlines the fall of an innocent Southern rural man, Brutus Jones, played brilliantly by Paul Robeson. Jones accidentally kills a man during a craps game and ends up fleeing brutal imprisonment to end up as a desperate castaway on a Carribean island. Through daring and cunning, he ends up as the cruel emperor of the island.  The final scenes of this movie are still enough to send chills up the spine of a modern viewer.  In addition to Paul Robeson and Fredi Washington, you get to see (or, more accurately, hear) Coot Grant and Kid Wesley Wilson performing ""Toot It, Brother Armstrong"" during the murder scene. Coot and Kid were a husband and wife vaudeville team during the early part of the 20th century. We also get a glimpse of an uncredited actor who is probably none other than Frankie ""Halfpint"" Jaxon, another vaudeville performer from this era. He is the little guy who plays the role of the treasurer on the island.

540967,3,6303039251,"ugene O'Neill's play, The Emperor Jones, is one of those works that is very easy to misconstrue as simply racist or simple-minded Freudianism. It's neither, but the 1933 film adaptation of said play, starring Paul Robeson in the role of Brutus Jones, suffers from many of the same misconceptions, as well as a few of its own, due to the breaks the film makes from its source material- both pro and con. And these breaks owe all of their power to the screenplay by DuBose Heyward, and the interpretation of it by film director Dudley Murphy, one of the earliest `lost' avant-garde filmmakers, who films it all in a very quick, modern style, as opposed to the then dominant style of extended master shots.

  The film's narrative does not already start on the unnamed tropical Caribbean Island that the play does; rather the film takes a chronological approach, and fleshes out more of Jones' background. In this, though, the 76 minute film suffers, for the play is a direct examination of a man's mind (however stereotyped one may argue it was rendered). The film neuters this innovative approach, but to Heyward's and Murphy's credit, the film compensates by expanding the tale of Jones with incidents not in the play. Plus, Murphy allows Robeson to physically change the tenor of scenes with a smile or a wink, or a knowing bow. To those who claim that Robeson was not a great actor, this is true only insofar as his acting style was not naturally cinematic- he was clearly theater and stage trained, but he does make a rather dated play still come alive, as a film, in the 21st Century. And, of course, the film has a number of musical interludes that the play lacks because, well, when one has Robeson, one of the 3 or 4 greatest male voices ever recorded, you show off the wares.",1340236800,,1783,4.636075949367089
540968,3,6303039251,"Eugene O'Neill's eight-scene drama, THE EMPEROR JONES had four brief theatrical runs between Nov. '20 and Jan. '27. A first revival (the only one Paul Robeson starred in), was performed 28 times between 2/11 and mid-March of 1925. It was coupled with a one-act play called THE DREAMY KID.

The motion picture version has long been in the public domain. Most home video dubs are from unrestored 16mm TV broadcast films, thus condition is rarely better than average and often sub-par.

540969,5,6303039251,"Modern day `political' celebrities can't hold a candle to Robeson, who always flaunted his politics even when it was most dangerous to do so. Sadly, his memory seems only to serve as a reminder of how little room there remains in modern society for either dissent or meaningful social engagement.

In that light, Robeson is also a reminder of a time when it actually seemed possible to engage with the idea of a political alternative (whether you find the idea pleasing or not). His evasive refusal to denounce Stalin in his House of Un-American Activities Committee hearings is certainly a difficult piece of history for white people to accept; but it's also not difficult to understand why Robeson would not be particularly eager to deliver these criticisms to the disgraceful HUAC to serve as handy propaganda for a country that had essentially marginalised his ability to speak and segregated him from the global community (Robeson's massive and FBI files can be found online). Instead, Robeson simply stated that ""whatever has happened to Stalin, gentlemen, is a question for the Soviet Union .. I will discuss Stalin when I may be among the Russian people some day, singing for them, I will discuss it there"". (Testimony of Paul Robeson before the House Committee on Un-American Activities, 12 June 1956.)

Real figures of political dissent now seem a long way off; it's worth remembering that most American Communists were NOT blindly supporting Stalin, but were demanding local rights like basic workers' conditions and racial and sexual equality that we now take for granted (even when we fail to live up to the ideals). If there's no HUAC now, it's not because Robeson would no longer be targeted, but because we seem to be endlessly effective at making sure that Robesons rarely emerge. Adopting the seemingly-neutral tone of modern liberal tolerance seems to be the new method for diverting any real social or political action that may carry any disruptive element. Who needs HUAC when we can police ourselves and target even moderately progressive ideas as `dangerously radical'?

It would be hard to exaggerate how amazing this collection is and how vital it is that Robeson's history be preserved and passed down. Each film is a priceless time capsule of a creativity and path finding on film with Native Land being particularly poignant. Check out Robeson's recently voluminous wikipedia pages to get an idea of the magnitude of his unparalleled life. Robeson's example of principled courageous agency, his mistakes and his courage, stands for all to learn from.",1299974400,6,2578,5.061176470588236
540970,4,6303039251,"Paul Robeson's name can be found in many places in this space for his extraordinary (untutored) vocal talents singing songs of freedom, of the struggle for human dignity and for artistic effect (Emperor Jones, etc.). The most famous, or from a leftist perspective, infamous use of that instrument was the Peekskill (New York) concert of 1949 where he, his fellow progressives, including Communist Party members and sympathizers, literally had to fight off the fascistic locals in the throes of the post-World War II Cold War ""red scare"" that dominated my childhood and many others from my generation of '68.

But that skill hardly ends the list of talents that Paul Robeson used in his life: scholar, All-American football player (at one point denied that honor because of his politics), folklorist, actor, and, most importantly, political activist round out the main features. This Criterion Collection series of four discs concentrates on his film career (and other short biographic and memory pieces) especially the early work where he had to play groveling, simple-minded blacks and did so against type (his ever present black and proud type). I will give a short summary below to show the range of his work, although his real role as Shakespeare's Othello, done on the stage, is by all accounts, his definitive work, as is, to my mind Emperor Jones for his film work.

That said, Paul Robeson, and I were political opponents on the left. Whether he was a member or just a sympathizer of the Stalinized Communist Party (or to use a quaint work form the old Cold War days, fellow-traveler) he nevertheless, if one looks closely at his speeches and comments stayed very close to the American Communist Party ""party line"" of the times (whatever that was, or rather whatever Moscow called for), including the ritualistic denunciation of Trotskyites as counter-revolutionaries, etc. He, however, was an eloquent spokesman for blacks here in America and internationally, a speaker against the Cold War madness, and a fighter for national liberation and anti-colonial struggles a kindred spirit. Moreover, unlike others, including poet Langston Hughes and novelist Richard Wright no ""turncoat"" and held his ground despite its effect on his career, his ability to earn a living, and his ability to leave America. Thus, he, along with the anarchist Emma Goldman, is one of those contradictory political characters from the past that I have a ""soft"" spot for. Paul Robeson's voice and presence, in any case, with this comprehensive retrospective (and others) will always be there. I wish, wish like hell, he could have been with us when the deal went down and communists had to choose between Stalinism and Trotskyism.
********
Emperor Jones, a classic Robeson performance is the main feature of the first disc. It is almost painful to watch this brilliant Eugene O'Neill play brought to the screen in 1933 for its language (the `n' word), it depiction of blacks, in the cities and the jungle as servile or loony, and merely the white man's fodder and for its primitive cinematic effects. But Paul Robeson IS Emperor Jones. No amount of fool talk, bad dialogue, didactic scripting can take away the power of his performance, foolishly tempting the fates, and the white man, or not. This is a powerful black man, period. His singing, especially of Water Boy, of course, needs no comment from me.

The other part of this disc is a sequence short piece on his life and times, as well as the effect hat he had on then up-and-coming young black actors and singers like James Earl Jones and Ruby Dee. This is a good short biographic sketch, although I find it hard to believe that throughout the various comments the fact of his association with the American Communist Party is no mentioned by anyone or I did not hear it mentioned by the narrator once. Robeson is characterized as merely a black social activist. This is a disservice to his memory, and a form of historical distortion that I have found elsewhere (notably in a Howard Zinn tribute documentary done by Matt Damon).The American Communist Party, our left-wing political enemy or not, was part of the working class movement in this country, at some points an important part, and to deny that is to deny our left-wing history.

7835498,2,6303039251,"The Emperor Jones, 1933 film

It begins with natives drumming and singing in their language. The dress suggests South Africa. The scene shifts to modern times, a religious meeting. Brutus Jones has a job that requires travel on the railroad as a Pullman Porter. The job involves polishing shoes, a good job gets bigger tip. In the big city he joins a party. He has another girlfriend. He overhears conversations in the Pullman coach about an investment. They show the acts in a night club. Two women fight. The next scene is a pool hall, men roll dice on the table. The stakes are raised. The dice are crooked! There is a fight with a knife; one man falls to the floor. Next we see convicts breaking rocks. They sing as they work. There is harsh punishment!

Jones hides in a truck to runaway. He finds a home to help him leave the country on a steamer. Then he jumps ship to swim to an island. Armed men bring him before the ruler. A white trader buys him for five silver dollars and offers him a job. A dice game distributes goods. Jones promotes himself to a partnership. Smithers offers his bill to the ruler; is there a little error? Three is a palace coup, Jones is ruler by brains (and a little magic). Taxes are raised to pay off the National Debt. The Emperor buys new clothes, and his palace is redecorated. The people resent this. A little stealing puts you in jail, big stealing makes you an Emperor. [Do clothes make the man?]

The Court assembles. Prisoners are whipped for beating a tax collector. A village will be burned to the ground in reprisal. Smithers tells Jones what happened today. Is the game up? People have fled to the hills, when will they attack? Jones hears the drums and leaves the palace. The tempo increases. Is he lost in the woods? He talks to himself as he wanders. He sees a ghost and fires his pistol. He discards his fancy jacket. Then he imagines himself back on the chain gang. Is he going in circles? He prays for forgiveness. Then he meets his fate. And so it ends.

This drama is a lesson in politics, a warning against unlimited power. Does this story seem realistic? I assume its portrayal of life in the 1930s is accurate. Drinking and gambling often lead to a killing (as in the pictures of the Wild West by Frederic Remington). It seems unrealistic in having a stranger take over a small country. Usually there is a group that supports a ruler, like an aristocracy of the wealthy (or an officer corps). Even in small gangs, one man rules with the help of others. Think of Chicago in the 1920s or Cleveland in the 1930s. This is based on the play by Eugene ONeill. [Emperor Jones was the name of a Cleveland Ohio gangster in the 1930s.]",1408233600,,2685,4.440162271805274

Even though It was mainly a drama, I suppose I was disappointed that Robeson did not sing more.  I have seen hundreds of dramas that I would rate above it.  Robeson acted well but the plot was depressing, and After it had finished I felt that I had gained nothing from it.
