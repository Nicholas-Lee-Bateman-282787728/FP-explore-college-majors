8087981,5,B000BKLB70,"Have Mercy!  I thought Sarah was trying to kill me the first few times I tried this.  I would collapse on the couch and I'm in fairly good shape!  For some, the 30 seconds breaks my not be needed but I needed it to recover some.  I will say that if you stick with it you will see results.  I use a 17 pound kettle bell, 3x weekly.",1468800000,,330,3.7941176470588234
8087982,5,B000BKLB70,"Volume Two of Kettlebells: the Iron Core Way builds on the foundation provided in Volume One, so you may want to pick that one up before you get this one, or else buy them at the same time. Note: I have not done any other kettlebell DVDs, so I can't compare these in that regard. I can only evaluate them in view of other exercise DVDs I've done.

If you are the sort of person who likes to mix your workouts up a bit, kettlebells would be great to add in to the rotation. Kettlebell exercises really are full-body strength exercises, and they also get your heart rate up (more on this later). I feel like the instructor for this DVD, Sarah Lurie, is personable and friendly. Probably the only complaint I have is that she sometimes loses count when you do 9 or 10 exercises on a side. However, just keep count yourself and do the recommended number.

Camera work is refreshingly simple in these DVDs. No artsy effects, no jarring switches of camera angle, etc. Just head on or slightly angled views of Sarah and her two demonstrators. Music is quiet and light and actually, barely noticeable. The set appears to be Sarah's fitness studio; with some camera angles in the intro, you can see past a partition to the reception desk and the front door. The two demonstrators seem fit and perform the moves with skill and without mistakes. They also look like real people who might do this sort of exercise on a regular basis, which is nice.

The DVD is divided into a couple of segments. First, there is a ""Foundation"" segment that provides a brief introduction and teaches a few new moves. (Other moves were taught in Volume One.) These are ""snatches,"" ""suitcase deadlift,"" ""tactical lunge,"" and ""deck squats."" For these four moves, there is a good deal of instruction. While Sarah repeatedly performs the move on one half of the screen, you get a lot of written cues and tips (on the screen). There's also a considerable amount of voiceover instruction during the ""Foundation"" segment.

Following the Foundation segment is the ""Circuit"" segment. This consists of a short warm-up, a couple of exercise sets, and a short abs segment. There is not a cool-down or stretch segment; you're on your own for that. I do wish one had been included.

The warm-up consists of a ""swing-catch-squat"" exercise followed by ""Turkish getups."" Then you move into three circuits that may include the following exercises: ""one-arm swing,"" ""snatches,"" ""clean and press,"" ""tactical lunges,"" ""two-arm swing,"" ""suitcase deadlifts,"" ""deck squats,"" and ""alternating swing."" The exact order of exercises is not the same in each of these circuits; Sarah does mix it up a bit. You end this section with two abs exercises: ""getup situps"" (which are Turkish getups where you don't stand all the way up) and crunches (standard, with the kettlebell unmoving on the floor between your feet).

As far as the instruction goes, I feel this DVD has more instruction on form and technique than just about any other exercise DVD I've ever done. It's emphasized over and over again. Although the Foundation segment only teaches four exercises, you can easily figure out the others by watching the entire DVD once before doing the exercise routine. The only thing that is not covered, that I wish would be covered, is how to choose a kettlebell (or kettlebells) that will give you the most benefit without risking injury. When I first did this DVD, I tried with a 15-lb. kettlebell, and that was fine for some exercises, but it was a little too heavy for others. (I've since purchased a smaller one to use for more difficult exercises.)

One thing that some people find irritating (I certainly did) was the long rests between exercises. On the one hand, I do like getting the chance to get a drink of water, and some exercise DVDs don't build in proper time for that. On the other hand, there's at least a 30 second break after each exercise, and between circuits, there are even longer breaks (1 or 2 minutes). This is enough time that it would be easy for your heart rate to drop and for you to get less benefit out of the exercise. What I usually do is jump rope for 15-20 seconds of the break to get a little extra cardio in. (Jumping jacks or some other plyometric move would also be effective.) Sarah says in the foundation segment that you only need to spend 2-3 hours a week working out if you do kettlebells. I'm not sure I buy that, personally, though, in fairness, I am not a personal trainer or exercise scientist.  This DVD will certainly work leg muscles (and you'll feel it the next day)!

I happen to like these exercises enough to recommend the program. I think the people who will get the most benefit out of it will be people who are interested in changing up their exercise routines a little bit by adding something new a couple of days a week. I would suggest that an intermediate-to-advanced exerciser will get the most benefit. Some of the moves are a bit difficult (I simply CANNOT do deck squats as fast as the people in the DVD, for example, no matter how hard I try). This DVD is probably not the best for absolute beginners or for people who wish to become kettlebell experts. But for everyone in between, I think this DVD (and its companion, Volume One) are a great introduction to kettlebells.

Note: a website and e-mail address are given at the end of the Circuit segment. The website address is no longer active, for what it's worth.",1384732800,2,5421,4.6375
8087983,5,B000BKLB70,"Loved Volume 1, and and this one doesn't disappoint.  It's a bit more challenging and faster paced, which is exactly what I was looking for!",1329177600,,140,4.6
8087984,5,B000BKLB70,"I'm so glad this was one of the kettlebell workout DVDs I purchased first. After falling into the false advertisement joke of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10-Minute-Solution-Kettle-Bell-Fat-Burner-DVD/dp/B004IQHYOM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10 Minute Solution - Kettle Bell Fat Burner [DVD</a>], I decided to stick with DVDs with certified Kettlebell instructors. I love Lurie's pacing and the instruction, and I especially appreciate the subtitles that prepare you for the next exercise and remind you of proper form and breathing. The best thing about it is after several viewings I can put it on mute, throw on some jams (cut to The Black Keys) and still get a workout in good form thanks to the subtitles and countdown clock. I can't get bored! :)",1328227200,,798,5.947826086956522
8087985,4,B000BKLB70,"I'm a high intermediate exerciser who works out daily, but I'm new to kettlebells (been using them for just a few months now). I practiced some basic kettlebell moves with a dumbbell for awhile, but this was one of the first workouts that I used with my 8 kg (18 lb) kettlebell that I purchased on Amazon (similar to this one but the 8kg version:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/16kg-35-lb-Kettlebell-with-DVD/dp/B004ANA7PG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">16kg (35 lb) Kettlebell with DVD</a>).

This DVD features RKC kettlebell instructor Sarah Lurie. It includes a short (1.5 minutes) introduction by Sarah, a 4.5 minute instructional segment (Foundation 2) in which Sarah breaks down some, but not all, of the kettlebell moves found in the workout, and then a 45 minute workout (Circuit 2). For those who have tried&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kettlebells-The-Iron-Core-Way-Volume-1-Complete-Guide-to-Kettlebell-Training-with-Follow-Along-Workout/dp/B000BKLB6Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kettlebells The Iron Core Way Volume 1 (Complete Guide to Kettlebell Training with Follow Along Workout)</a>, several new and more challenging moves are added here, included snatches, clean & press, and Turkish getups.

For the actual workout, Sarah is instructing live with two background exercisers, Robert and Sammy. The warm-up consists of swings, catches, squats, and three Turkish getups per side. (Note: Sarah does not break down the Turkish getup, a fairly tricky move.)

The Circuit is conducted in three rounds of individual exercises, with a 30 second break between exercises and a 1-2 minute break between rounds. Prior to each exercise, graphics appear on screen breaking down the move in detail and offering form tips; a countdown clock also keeps track of the breaks.

The exercises in each round are basically the same, with some slight variations as noted below:

Round 1:
*1-arm swings (10)
*snatches (8)
*clean & press (8)
*tactical lunges (10) + 2-arm swings (10)
*suitcase deadlift (5) + snatches (5)
*deck squats (10)
*alternating swings (10)

Round 2:
*1-arm swings (10)
*snatches (8)
*clean & press (8)
*tactical lunges (10) + 2-arm swings (10)
*suitcase deadlift (5) + snatches (5)
*deck squats (10)

Round 3:
*1-arm swings (10) + snatches (10)
*clean & press (8)
*tactical lunges (10)
*suitcase deadlift (5)
*snatches (5)
*deck squats (10)

Abs:
*get-up situps (4 per side)
*twisting crunches, kettlebell between feet (10)

I didn't find this DVD significantly more intense than Volume 1. However, as someone who is still quite new to kettlebells, I found several of the moves more difficult to execute, particularly the snatches and clean & press, both of which are used frequently here. Furthermore, I didn't think that Sarah's breakdowns of the moves provided quite enough information. Another issue was that during the workout itself, Sarah's pace is a bit too quick for a beginner; although I'm an experienced exerciser, I struggled to keep up with her at times. I like the round format, and sometimes I will do only 1-2 rounds rather than all three, although the DVD would have been much more user-friendly had the rounds been separately chaptered.  Still, I do think that this is a very good DVD, although those new to kettlebells will probably want to have at least some practice under their belts prior to using it.",1324339200,2,3426,5.609284332688588
8087986,4,B000BKLB70,"I am only giving this review a 4 star, because I haven't seen any other bell workout DVD's. However, I enjoy/hate this DVD alot.

I presently have a 14kg bell at home that was shipped to me. Over $100 by the time shipping was added. I needed a smaller bell for some of the exercises, but didn't want to pay for shipping. I was ecstatic when walking down the fitness aisle in Target and saw some bells - with a DVD. So, I now have two bells (14kg and 15lb) and the Volume 2 of the Iron Core Way DVD. This is an excellent workout! I still can only do two circuits, partly because then I get on the treadmill for 20-30 minutes for cardio workout. It keeps you going and makes you sweat! This is what I need - I may not lose any weight, but I will keep my strength for all my other fun activities of horseback riding, x-ctry skiing, and etc.

Also, I really like Laurie, some people who use bells get very military basic training mentallity (I am a veteran, so I have been there, done that - don't want to exercise to that). Laurie is very positive and motivational, gaggy music, and no shouting at the top of her voice your you to ""step it up son"". I just want to workout and get it done.

I do recommend two different bells (one heavy for swings and such, one lighter for your Russian get-up), so that you can switch. There is nothing like a Bell workout to let you know which muscles you haven't been working out in a while. It gets the entire body, and you feel it. Enjoy!",1207872000,6,1472,4.13986013986014
8087987,4,B000BKLB70,"The video was very challenging and I found it to be an excellent work out.  However, the structure of the video seems to have quite a bit of time wasted.  She structured it so that you complete one set in its entirety, then the second and then the third.  Additionally, there is a 2 minute break between the first and the second sets and then a full minute between the 2nd and the 3rd sets.  Plus, there is a 30 second break after each routine.  If the video was structured so you completed all three sets, one after the other, and with a shorter break after each routine, the video would probably be 30 minutes instead of 40.  That's my only complaint about it, but otherwise, an excellent work out.",1202428800,4,700,4.346153846153846
8087988,5,B000BKLB70,"I purchased Volume One and Two.  I had never used Kettle bells before and didn't even know what they were.  I found them on the internet and decided to give them a try.  I am an absolute convert and have fallen in love with this wonder exercise.  As a beginner I highly recommend both Volume One and Two.  In Volume Two she adds a few more moves and suggestions and picks up the pace a little bit.  However, it is still all on a beginners level so after using Volume One for a month I believe that a person would be ready for Volume Two.  Make sure that you watch the instruction part of the video on how each exercise should be performed.  I would suggest you do this in the beginning and then re-review again every week for a month.  You pick up a little something new each time.  Go for it KETTLEBELL is great!",1194739200,16,813,4.153846153846154
8087989,5,B000BKLB70,"Purchased this for my girlfriend who was new to exercise much less kettlebells. She loves it and best of all you can do it in the privacy of your own home or on the road. No Gym needed.

I also purchased the first one. This one is tougher but still easy enough for someone to get the exercises down and be effective.",1162857600,14,316,4.096774193548387
