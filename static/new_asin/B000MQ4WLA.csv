8170679,3,B000MQ4WLA,"Being from Houston, we wanted to see Carl Lewis in a movie. He gave a great performance, although I must admit the movie is taylored for a more ""urban"" audience. Go ahead and get anyway - there's a great story. And of course, Debbie Allen is a proven talent in the movie world.",1348444800,,277,4.245283018867925
8170680,4,B000MQ4WLA,I thought that the movie was very good. It starts off a little slow but picks up rapidly. I thought all the young ladies did a very good job of acting. In a two week period I have watched it four times. Good Luck ladies and I hope to see some of you in future films.,1181347200,2,266,3.767857142857143
