7022478,3,B00TSLTR6U,"It was OK for a British made Z-flick, perhaps 3.5 stars.  I thought it interesting the way the Brits went samurai with swords and clubs.  An apocalyptic event in America would necessitate we pop the lid on the ammo can.  It escaped me as to why the military was shooting everything - living or zombie.  Lots of CH-47 Chinook film footage.",1506124800,2,338,4.491803278688525

7022481,3,B00TSLTR6U,"If there was a two-and-one-half star rating it would be more accurate for me: it's sort-of OK. This film is almost universally loathed and hated around the internet with many people calling it the worst movie they've ever seen. I guess they haven't seen that many zombie(infected) films because compared to some of the total trash I've sat through and some I've turned off mid way, it's fairly good. This doesn't mean it doesn't have many flaws. You'll notice right away that the box is cluttered and seems full of action and big scenes. Forget that. They seem to have taken every action moment in the film and crowded it all onto the cover to make it look exciting. This movie features about seven young characters hiding out in a house in Bristol.

This is an indie film shot on a small budget of a thousand pounds (it's an English film); that's around 1200 dollars or so. The director is also the writer and the star, so at least it's not some cheap corporate ripoff but rather a homemade film by someone who loves the genre. I give a little extra slack for that. His name is Dan Rikard and he was a storyboard artist for The Martian, and did special effects on The Dead and the Dead 2 - India. He's also about the only person in the film who can actually act. Technically the movie looks okay. For a film shot for under $2,000 it looks great. If only the camera person didn't lose focus so often. Also, there's a certain reliance on shaky-cam whenever the ""infected"" show up but that's probably because they didn't have much of a makeup budget and probably the same people play the zombies in every scene. (End credits list about 15 ""featured zombies"" and 100 others, all of whom are used in the final scenes).

The biggest problems are in the script. Of course it's a lot like other zombie films, and especially 28 Days Later. That's okay with me because there's not much you can do with the basic setup and when people try to, it's usually worse. but there's no character development and everyone sort of sits around. They do really stupid things. They spend most of their time getting drunk and even play loud techno music - just the thing to do, right? Later on, pursued by the army in a zombie infested forest they light a fire and everyone goes to sleep! Sort-of nerdy college student type dan can beat up and kill trained and equipped soldiers so fast you think maybe this movie has some kind of Bourne angle going on, but it doesn't. There's lots more, but you get the idea. It's not bad if you've seen just about every zombie movie, even the free ones but nothing to tell your friends to see.",1503619200,,2605,4.447698744769874

7022483,4,B00TSLTR6U,"Having read up on the production of this film, i must say i'm VERY impressed with what the filmmakers have achieved on such a tiny budget.

Helicopters, zombies, destroyed cities, soldiers all look like they are part of a Hollywood film. Whilst the acting and the plot aren't 100% (although i read that the whole film was improvised by the cast and shot at weekends over several years so that can be forgiven) it's a very enjoyable zombie action film.

The film is very similar in style to 28 Days Later, and had some funny moments, a few jump scares and plenty of zombie carnage. Well worth a watch.",1497484800,2,600,4.495412844036697
7022484,2,B00TSLTR6U,"A neurological virus infects humans and causes them to go into a berserk killer mode, on steroids. They are stronger and faster. Dan (Dan Rickard) wakes up on a beach, not knowing what is happening. He meets up with some people scavenging for food and joins up with the group that operates more like a frat house, than survivalists. Some welcome Dan, others are leery about him. About the only thing worse than the super charged zombies is the military with guns.

Seemed odd the first group he encountered didn't carry any sort of weapon while they were out. I couldn't imagine going anywhere without at least a bat. The frat house scenes were long and boring. In fact much of the film was tedious.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1435449600,2,733,4.587786259541985
7022485,1,B00TSLTR6U,"With all due respect. It looks like lack of creativity extends across the ""pond"", too, when it come to making new flicks. Just another college undergraduate film project. Maybe, if I watched this on my cell phone, I might get something worthwhile of an entertainment value. But, that would deprive me of being able to watch something else. Better luck, next time.",1508025600,2,363,4.870967741935484
7022486,5,B00TSLTR6U,"What an amazing job these people did!  The special effects are simply amazing.  It's hard enough to make a film when you have money and crew, but to make a good movie with so little.  Well done and very interesting.  I see this as the only modern movie adaptation of the book ""I Am Legend"" (The Last Man on Earth is a bit dated now).  You have the pure humans, the zombies and the infected immune all in a struggle for survival.

Personally, I loved it.  I wish there were many more indy flicks this good.",1507593600,2,505,4.197916666666667

7022488,2,B00TSLTR6U,"A fairly original take on the traditional zombie movie with a few interesting moments. But...there was no coherent story line - not even for a zombie movie. A blurry shaky-cam was used every time there was any action so you can't tell what is going on. It was just original enough so I was hoping for a decent ending, but it just kind of stops. Ultra low-budget so the flaws are not unexpected, but the end result is still a film that makes you go ""Ugh""",1507248000,2,453,4.27906976744186

7022493,5,B00TSLTR6U,"VERY ENTERTAINING! WHAT 28 MONTHS LATER COULD BE IF THEY EVER MAKE IT!  A very nice British twist on the zombie genre Clearly low budget but entertaining and compelling nonetheless. A ""rage virus like disease"" unleashes zombie like individuals in Britain. (Note I said zombie like - so we are talking infected not Romero living dead.) A mysterious stranger washes up on a beach and takes refuge with a group of survivors but he has a dark secret even he is unaware of. Its a good watch. Kept me interested. I got it free on Prime so I MORE than got my money's worth - to rent or buy thats your call. I say ""almost as good as 28 Days Later and BETTER THAN 26 weeks later. A must see for the british zombie fan.",1506297600,2,709,4.2518518518518515
7022494,4,B00TSLTR6U,"This is a refreshing take on the zombie genre.  The zombies aren't undead in this flick.  They are infected with a disease that makes them intensely hyper-violent homicidal maniacs with a taste for flesh.  Think of a meth-head with rabies and sharp teeth on PCP.  You'll have to watch it to get more about the immune, the vaccine, and the military's involvement without me giving away real spoilers.  This movie had surprises around every corner.  I really enjoyed the many fresh ideas that this move brought to a rather stale genre.  But, don't worry.  There are plenty of guts and gore to go around, too.",1506124800,3,606,4.704761904761905

I give it 3 1/2 of i could because the filmaker and cast understood what a good zombie movie needs and did the best with what they had. Yeah, the camera work is a bit shaky at times, but the post-apoc scenery and long shots are worth it. There is worse crap out there to watch.

However, if you decide a whether movie is good or not based on how many millions of dollars were spent on CGI, you will be disappointed. This is not a big budget Hollywood movie. The plot is good but it has a lot of 28 Days Later feeling to it. The acting is average, I have seen bad acting and these actors do not fall into that category.",1510617600,2,396,3.9625
