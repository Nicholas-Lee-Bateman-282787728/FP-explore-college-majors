8369593,4,B002FY7WSW,"Jungle Patrol echoes the Dawn Patrol movies, and is based on a play by William Bowers.  Six plane unit with P-40E's fly out of Port Moresby.  Most of the film takes place in the base tents.  Flying footage is from domestic, jungle and desert(!) airfields.  Aerial combat is secondhand through the com channel.  A real P-40E sits in the studio for close-ups.  Models of Sally's and B-25 footage are used during the bomber raid on the base.

Silent Raider starts with an internal dialogue by the lieutenant leader of the motley 7 man commando unit, but he oddly dies early in the film and the sergeant takes over without any narration.

Combat Bulletin segments are twice as many ETO than PTO.  List and notes: Ops In N. France (Churchill Crocodile flame thrower, aerial gun camera footage, treadway bridge); Ops In France-Capture Of Brest (8"" gun); 20,000 Germans Surrender (vehicle convoy and impound); Flying Bomb Launch Sites (wrecked V-1); Allies Move On Germany (misc vehicles/armor, Stirling supply drop); Airborne Ops (C-47 drop/glider tug); 5th Army Pierces Gothic Line (misc vehicles/armor; German Installations (Belgian coast wall and disguised Luftwaffe airfield); Allies Capture More French Ports (Churchill tanks, misc vehicles); Allied Armies Move On Germany (misc armor, Panzers, C-47 crash); Activities In ETO-Bitumen Surface For Airstrip Runways; Battle Of Aachen (misc armor); Japanese-Americans On 7th Army Front (troop trucks); Brazilian Troops Reach Italian Front (debarkation); B-29's In Ops CBI (apron, aerials, take-offs, landings); Prep For Phillippine Invasion (CV-6 Enterprise ops w/F6F, TBF, SB2C, beach landings w/various LC and wading Sherman); Invasion Of Morotai Island (asbestos grease and snorkels applied to tanks and trucks, Amtracs assist other vehicles); Cleanup On Pelelieu and Angaur (Doberman dogs, misc armor/construction equipment).",1374278400,2,1874,5.570422535211268
8369594,4,B002FY7WSW,"As you can realize this DVD Disc contains a double feature and a never seen compiled documentary.  'Jungle Patrol' is rather a love story in the jungles of the Pacific with no visual action, but a lot of noices of exploding bombs with the occasion of Air Bombers taking off.  It is sweet but I was expecting a lot of action.  I love war stories. ***

'The Silent Raiders' is the opposite with of a story about an advance Patrol which landed on the shores of Normandy before D-Day. It acted like a scout as also to break a couple of comunication facilities which could be of a hassard to the landing allies.  It a well shot story with quite a lot of action, mind the mistakes some soldiers been involved in, which naturally took their lives.****

The most important part featured on this DVD is the Actualy shot action ducumentary which was shot during the advanment of the allied troops in Europe taking one town after another until Germany fell and the war ended.  There are also some episode from the take over of the Pacific but they were not so detailed.  It is historic material which was never yet shown.*****",1259884800,7,1115,4.485148514851486
8369595,5,B002FY7WSW,"JUNGLE PATROL is a strange little movie, in the respect that most of the action is taken form the communication centers radio.  The acting is good, but I didn't really buy this double feature for JUNGLE PATROL.

THE SILENT RAIDERS was Richard Bartlett's and Earle Lyon's first attempt at a feature film.  If you cannot put up with cheesy sets, and a cast of unknowns and non-existent production values, then you wouldn't be interested in this movie.  The reason I give it such a high rating is the mere fact that it was made for around $27,000!  Now this was during the period when Ed Wood was cranking out real klunkers at twice that price.  Had they a few more bucks, they may have been able to flesh out the characters, given the movie a little more texture, and quality.  But it is what it is...and that is a great first effort from a team that would go on and crank out THE LONESOME TRAIL, THE SILVER STAR, and the very surreal TWO GUN LADY.  Lyon sings the picture's neat little title song.  A nice addition to any real movie afficianado's collection.",1250985600,7,1057,4.463541666666667
