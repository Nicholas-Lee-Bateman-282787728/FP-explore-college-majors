8098014,5,B000CDSS68,I will keep this short and sweet. PBS puts out many great documentaries and this is one of them. It is a very well-done and thoroughly researched documentary containing interviews with many key participants. I was glued to my television for the entire 3 hours. My attention span usually doesn't last past 20 minutes. GET THIS DVD!!!!!!!,1231286400,5,336,4.912280701754386

8098017,5,B000CDSS68,This DVD provides an exceptional look into the most recent peace process in the Middle East - it also gives insight into the main players and how they go about negotiating such a difficult process. The footage of the players that don't always make the mass media coverage is very in-depth and makes you feel like your there in the midst of the negotiations.  Very detailed and fast moving at the same time - one cannot come away feeling more educated and informed about the trials and tribulations of this never ending story.,1187740800,4,525,4.645161290322581
