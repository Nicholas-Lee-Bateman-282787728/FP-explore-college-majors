5070268,4,B0079R1M40,"Warner Archives has just released the elusive DVD transfer of 1932's ""13 Women"". Ursula Georgi is an East-Indian half-caste, scarred by her taunting white sorority sisters, who all lived together at a private school north of San Francisco. The years have passed, and Georgi has teamed with bogus Swami Yogadachi(her lover, who she soon murders). Georgi sends round-robin letters; astrology forecasts warning all 13 of her class-mates that sudden death is next on their agenda. Georgi threatens them, and their families, and then uses poison, bombs, hypnotism, and auto-suggestion to carry out her plans. A spell-binding performance, Myrna Loy is icy and chilling as Georgi, a dark vamp who uses sex to trap her lovers into completing her strategies. Irene Dunne plays Laura Stanhope, a sorority girl, now married with a young son. Warm family sequences with mother and son are played against Loy's arcane devil-plotting in her secret lair. The cast also has Ricardo Cortez, C, Henry Gordon, and Leon Ames(his scenes were deleted). A former silent-film director, George Archainbaud builds eerie suspense with long, shadowy scenes, some with no sound at all. A brief, forceful soundtrack is by the great Max Steiner. RKO Pictures and producer David O. Selznick were jarred by the movie's middle slow pace, cutting 15 minutes of footage we will never see(The film lasts only 59 minutes). ""13 Women"" was considered a failure at the time. Peg Entwistle, who played Hazel Cousins, committed suicide the day the movie was released. She climbed to the top of the Hollywood sign, then spelled ""Hollywoodland"", and jumped off the top of the ""H"". The same year, 1932, Selznick produced the now classic ""Most Dangerous Game"" at RKO. We will never know, but once again editors chopped up the final edit, including early scenes with a sailor; among the earliest film acting stints by Lon Chaney Jr..""13 Women"" is a must-see for Myrna Loy fans; a spooky, unsettling drama. And by the way, there are only 11 women in the movie, not 13.",1334620800,13,2019,5.029850746268656
5070269,4,B0079R1M40,I enjoyed this movie. The picture quality was more than fair. The sound was very good. The acting was great. I give it a heads up.,1334620800,7,130,4.038461538461538

5070271,3,B0079R1M40,"Interesting because of the actress Peg Erstwhistle (one of the featured players in the film) who committed suicide by jumping from the top of the ""H"" in the Hollywood sign shortly after the film was released.  A very talented young actress from Broadway.  A young Bette Davis (before she was a star) said that she hoped that she would be as great an actress as Peg Erstwhistle was.",1415491200,3,381,4.588235294117647
5070272,4,B0079R1M40,"Fascinating to see Myna Loy in one of her early roles. Would have liked to see the original version, which included all thirteen women. But the final version dropped two of them in order to give more exposure to one of the other actresses in the movie.  Myrna is fun to watch.",1412121600,,276,4.3076923076923075
5070273,4,B0079R1M40,"This is indeed a different type movie from the ""Thin Man Series"" with William Powell.  Miss Loy, who has been charming in that series is a totally different person on a revenge trip.  The story is of interest and the end is well deserved.  I found this unusual for Miss Loy but it shows her acting ability is excellent and leading her down the road to stardom.  I recommend this movie for Myrna Loy enthusiasts as well as people who like drama.",1400544000,,444,4.378048780487805
5070274,5,B0079R1M40,"We just couldn't believe Mryna Loy could be so cunning and sly.  Interesting how the power of suggestion can work with some people. Very entertaining movie, The sound and picture were both good.",1394236800,2,194,4.878787878787879
5070275,4,B0079R1M40,"Thirteen Women is at it's very core a tragedy. The villain of the story, Ursula Georgi (Myrna Loy), is only so ""cruel and inhuman"" because of how she was treated by society, forced to pass for white to get anywhere in life and be accepted and treated as a human being. Ironically, the fact that she passed for white is what led to her inhumanity, scorned by the other young women in her sorority as a ""half-caste Hindu"" she swore revenge on these twelve other women and years later, along with a certain swami, who doubles as her lover, sends them all horoscopes foretelling death in their future, and slowly but surely death and tragedy of various kinds does seem to befall the women, some of who believe in the horoscopes and others who do not. Ursula, who possesses the power to hypnotize and control others minds to do her bidding, even goes so far as to threaten the life of the child of one of the women. A tense film, it was known as the first psychological thriller. The ending is very tragic, but perhaps fitting and mirroring living in such a tragic society in those days. Minus one star for the short length of the film and the inability of it to go too in-depth into the reasoning behind Ursula's murders and her story.",1379980800,5,1231,4.451327433628318
5070276,4,B0079R1M40,"If you love the Thin Man, you need to see Ms Loy as something less than noble and nice.  You will love hating her",1359763200,4,113,3.7083333333333335
5070277,5,B0079R1M40,"I truly enjoyed this old fashioned movie with a diabolical cast!
And of course, I love Myrna Loy. I highly recommend it.",1356220800,6,120,4.5
5070278,5,B0079R1M40,A truly great 1930's classic... they just don't make movies like this anymore....  I would recomend this to any classic movie fan...,1347926400,3,132,5.0
5070279,4,B0079R1M40,Myrna Loy play's a woman of mixed blood who goes to college with women who treat her really bad so she desided to get even. She has special powers & can look someone in the eye & make them do what she tells them to do. She goes after these women & one after the other they die. One of the last women she goes after is Irene Dunne & she targets her little boy. It really gets you going near the end. It's another wonderful old movie with two great stars in it.,1345593600,5,459,3.893617021276596
8512988,5,B0079R1M40,"A favorite weirdo film from the pre-code days where Myrna Loy is the villainess, a once-bullied schoolgirl who is now onboard a train with her former tormentors, ready for payback.  NOT A GOOD FILM, by the way, but it's a favorite for so many other reasons - it's just FUN to see these actresses in some of their earliest talkies.",1526083200,,330,4.5
8512989,5,B0079R1M40,"My five-star rating is not for the movie but for the product itself. It arrived on time and in good condition. As to the movie, well, years ago, my mother taped this off AMC or TMC, but something happened in the recording, and she failed to get more than the first fifteen to thirty minutes of it. Over the years, forgetting it wasn't complete, I'd pop in the tape to watch it (always with the feeling that ""it must be long enough since the last time I watched this because I don't remember how it ends"") and, of course, learn the ""why"" behind my not remembering how it ends--because it wasn't complete!

So, one night I got in the mood to see this movie, but, of course, the local library doesn't have it. I hopped online and found it here. I bought it right away. Finally! I had the whole movie. And...ah, not so much. As it turned out, my supposition of how it would end was correct. When I finally got to the ending, I found it anticlimactic. It starts with such promise, but it ends with a crashing thud!

I don't want to give away the ending to anyone who's never seen it, but it's a murder mystery surrounding sorority sisters, each one of whom has graduated and gone off into the world to forge her own life. But one of them (played by Myrna Loy) has hate in her heart and a deep-seated desire to see each one pay for her ""crime"" in college. One by one, each is picked off by what seems to be suicide...with a twist. You see, Myrna Loy is into the occult and has met a swami she can control, who sends out warning letters to Myrna's sorority sisters telling them that he's done their horoscope charts and sees death in their futures. Into each head is planted the idea of how each is to die, and, through a serious case of the power of suggestion, each girl makes his prediction come to pass, unable to control herself from either taking her life or the life of another in the sorority. Until, finally, only a couple girls are left, one of the finalists being Irene Dunne.

Sounds kind of compelling, right? Well, it's good until it ends. As I said, it ends with a dud. I'm not certain what I wanted the ending to be, but I didn't like this ending. Maybe if Myrna's character didn't get off with such an ""easy"" finale--seeing as how she tormented so many others to bring about their ends. But I didn't care for it, so I guess I'll give this one to my mother for her video library. Now she'll finally have the movie in its entirety!",1508716800,,2439,4.274891774891775
8512990,4,B0079R1M40,"This 1932 proto-thriller is the only movie featuring Peg Entwistle, whom youve likely never heard of. Shes best known, if at all, for being the woman who committed suicide by jumping off the Hollywood sign. It's likely available because it stars Myrna Loy, playing an exotic woman whos determined to murder a group of white sorority sisters who were mean to her at school because of her half-breed background.

Loys character Ursula manipulates an astrologer, using hypnotism, into sending her victims prophecies of madness and death, which then come true thanks to the power of suggestion. And the occasional bomb package. Although there were supposed to be 13 women involved (as in the source novel), there are only 11 in the hour-long movie, and I only counted 8 as having any real role. Pegs original sequence was heavily truncated, because the plot had hints of lesbianism with a friend, driving her to stab her husband and go mad.

These film cuts may have been one of the factors that made Peg think her career wasn't going anywhere, although she had previously been successful on Broadway and the stage. Shes the reason Bette Davis became an actress, reportedly, as a young Davis saw Entwistle perform and was inspired. Peg died two days after the films release. I enjoyed watching Thirteen Women as a brief diversion, full of suspense, where its hard not to root for the villain.",1489276800,,1388,4.877118644067797
8512991,5,B0079R1M40,"I love this movie! It is so out of character for Myrna Loy! I am so used to seeing her in comedies, so I was skeptical about her ability to handle a part in a thriller!",1486512000,,168,3.6944444444444446

8512993,3,B0079R1M40,2.5 stars would be most appropriate.  Interesting for buffs to see Myrna Loy in her exotic period.  The premise of the film is promising but it all peters out midway.  Should have been better than it was and certainly overpriced.,1471132800,,229,4.675
8512994,5,B0079R1M40,"Myrna Loy as Ursula Georgie who preys on others has the lion's share of the story.  Irene Dunne and her young son are victims, but survive.",1444348800,,139,4.346153846153846
8512995,3,B0079R1M40,"I have tried to see all Myrna Loy movies.  This one is OK.  The film is short, even for the day.  Myrna plays as Asian, which she has done before.  The plot is OK.  Typical story of getting revenge.
