3526087,1,B001D5DQFC,"Even though the storyline is cute, I cannot recommend this title. Funimation advertises Kodocha (properly, Kodomo no Omocha, which translates as Child's Toy) as being uncut. However, the original opening animation and music has been completely removed and replaced with the animation and music from the second season. In addition, about 25 seconds of Japanese dialogue is silenced in the first episode. I mean exactly that. There is no audio, and several words in the subtitles are replaced with Xs. Funimation stipulates contract necessities, but has never elaborated further, and refuses to do so.

Regarding the dub version, there is at least one word that has been purposely mistranslated. When Sana is talking with her hairdresser, she refers to Rei, her manager, in Japanese, as her boyfriend and her pimp. In the dub, Rei becomes her boyfriend and a very taken man. Earlier in the episode, Sana refers to Rei as her pimp, in Japanese, and ""agent"" is substituted for the word ""pimp"" in the English. When I brought up this discrepancy on the Funimation boards, a representative of Funimation protested that the studio translated everything accurately, in the subtitles and the dub. Naturally, concerning the evidence, this assertion is an impossibility.

Watching the dub with the subtitles activated was illuminating and served as convincing evidence why subtitles, in general, are preferable to dubbing. Not only was the English dialogue far different (especially when you consider the dropping of Sana's pimp reference, a classic bit of the show's humor) than the subtitles, English dialogue was introduced even when nothing was being said in the Japanese, and sometimes when something in Japanese was spoken, it was not represented in the English language dialogue at all. This has the effect of drastically altering the tone of several scenes.  Another pimp reference in the English dialogue is simply omitted, and a string of ""I love you"" is substituted in its place, thus effectively neutering Sana's idiosyncratic introduction of Rei to the audience. These are only a few examples. I can only conclude that the original script was treated as a mere list of suggestions and not even a guide, because the English dialogue sometimes in no way represented what was communicated in Japanese (and what was communicated in Japanese was, in nearly all circumstances, more artfully rendered than the bastardized English language dub interpretation).

I'd avoid this title. Had I known all that had been altered, I never would have picked it up.",1230681600,9,2548,5.2073170731707314
3526088,5,B001D5DQFC,"Sana Kurata is a 11 year-old TV star with a very strong personality. But even stars have problems, and Sana's is a boy named Akito, who is the ringleader of the boys in her class. Sana has made it her goal to defeat Akito and return peace to her disrupted classroom.

This series is weird. In a good way. Sana is an extremely high energy zany character that is lots of fun to watch. Viewers of this show need to be able to suspend disbelief. Because really, where on earth does she keep that hammer?
I watch this series in English because the cast is awesome. Sana's voice actress (Laura Bailey, Fruits Basket) obviously isn't eleven, but she still pulls the role off wonderfully. The rest of the cast was also well chosen and do excellent jobs (Jerry Jewell as Akito and John Burgmeier as Rei are both notable). I tried watching this in Japanese at one point, but had to switch back after a few minutes because the Japanese Sana is horribly annoying to listen to. The English script is also more entertaining to an English speaking audience, as it has some jokes adapted to Western culture.

This is one of my favorite series, but it isn't for everyone. Like I've said, it is an incredible crazy series about eleven-year-olds and Sana sings rap when upset (which I actually found quite entertaining). I think that this show is also more suited to female audiences. I've shown this show to two guys. One was ok with watching more, but he was only so-so on liking it. The other one loathes this show with a passion. So far, all girls I've shown this to have enjoyed it.

The only problem with this show is the fact that it isn't all available in the US. Only the first half of the series was released before they stopped and it seems unlikely that they will continue. If you think that you can just buy a bootlegged set for the second half, think again. For some reason it is rather hard to find any Kodocha bootlegs. But this show isn't about the destination, it is about the journey! I think it is still worth watching and if you really want the rest of the story the manga is only 10 volumes and all of it available in English (though out of print).",1283385600,8,2151,4.399497487437186

3526092,5,B001D5DQFC,I recently picked up the entire series of Kodocha and I have to say that it is just an amazing anime. Episodes can get serious without taking themselves too serious.

3526094,5,B001D5DQFC,"I've heard of certain Funimation flops that do well in Japan and are well-recieved critically, but... are financially a flop because not enough people in the U.S. are aware, appreciative, or just flat-out care about this type of show.

Kodocha (anagramical summaration for Kodomo-no-Omocha/a.k.a. A Child's Toy) is a story about a SUPER-hyperactive girl and her everyday life through life at it's highest and lowest moments.

Sana is, by far, one of the most energetic anime heroines EVERRR! So energetic that the word: ""energetic"" probably can't even describe it!
She is an aspiring child actor who is egoless as much as she is energetic, making her one of the VERY FEW hyper anime characters that's not annoying, but rather endearing.

She has a quarrel with one of the bad apples, Akito, and tries to best him, and ends up helping him in a way that forever affects him... She treats it like it's no big deal, but for him... he can't express how grateful and happy he is to her.

Sana thinks of Akito in a dual manner: One side of her thinks of him as a mortal enemy (and I say this in the most humorous of intentions), and the other side of her thinks of him as an eternal best friend.

With this as the initial premise of the story, we go through life in the eyes of kids. Rarely sappy, always fun(ny), sometimes confusing, and emotionally affecting.

(For spoiler reasons I've subtracted, to the best of my abilities, all of the details leading the events I've specified.)

As for the product itself: It contains the first 6 DVDs of the original releases, spanning from eps 1-24, handling the first 2 story arcs, and adding a fun recap episode, and some great slice-of-lifers.

The audio options are English 5.1, Stereo, and Japanese Stereo. You might think that a 5.1 seems unnecessary for this type of show, but believe me! IT IS A HUGE BONUS!
Dubbing is handled by Funimation. Funimation is widely known for their adaptable reversioning on Dragon Ball Z, their legendary voice work for Fullmetal Alchemist, and for their super accurate adapation of the life affecting Mushi-Shi.
Here we see more of an interpretation than an accurate dub effort. That doesn't mean, by a long shot, that it's on of their inferior works!

Laura Bailey shows some of the best talents an English VA can do. Her fast paced speech is PERFECTION for Sana's character. COMPLETE PERFECTION!!! Need further proof? Watch the 1st episode!
Jerry Jewell initially disturbed viewers with his low-pitched tone, that some thought was too deep to pass as a kid. If you continue though, you'll find that his voice connects quite... pleasingly... It's an (extremely fast) acquired taste, so no worries with that issue.

Extra's include textless opener, interviews with the director, and commentaries with Collen Clinkenbeard, and Laura Bailey. The commentaries were especially interesting, since you see how much fun they had with the series, in both dubbing and in actually watching it!

Kodocha is an overlooked anime that NEEDS much more attention than it already has.
Buying this is a no-brainer, and, while it may seem like a Saturday morning cartoon, it has some of the best insights of child life that NO cartoon, American or Japan, has!",1256601600,6,3215,4.848540145985401
3526095,5,B001D5DQFC,"I enjoyed this Anime collection very much. You can find other reviews that will tell you all you could want to know about the story and content. So in summation it was amusing, some thought provoking content and enjoyable.",1253577600,3,222,4.717948717948718
3526096,5,B001D5DQFC,"Kodocha is likely one of the best anime I've seen. Everything is very inspired, and you'll always look forward to what's going to happen next. Contrary to what the beginning of the first episode may lead you to believe, there are some genuine serious moments, but they're very well-done. Of course, funny moments break things up for the better.

Kodocha succeeds with over-the-top humor, likeable characters and a heart of gold. Give it a look.",1237420800,3,444,4.92
3526097,5,B001D5DQFC,"To be fair to this wonderful early 90's anime series, I will give it 5 stars to counter the other harsh 1 star review. (I would have honestly given it 4 stars, otherwise.) The series itself should be given 5 stars, but this review is also for the Funimation DVD translation and contents, therefore, 4 stars.

I'll start with the series itself:

I am a huge fan of Kodocha and it's possibly one of my favorite anime series of all time. That's no easy task as I have seen many, many anime series and am quite selective about quality; not popularity. Kodocha is one of few anime capable to make me cry so hard. It can also effectively make me laugh as hard. Sometimes, both, simultaneously! I can say with confidence that not many anime can (and will) match Kodocha when it comes to the department of wackiness and variety. It covers various topics ranging anywhere from love, pregnancy, friendship, child abuse, homelessness to relationship with parents. I would like to go on and on about how wonderful and brilliant this series is but I also don't want to write an essay.

Now on with the Funimation DVD contents:

Regarding the gripe about the missing first season opening, Funimation apparently couldn't get the rights to use Tokio (performer of the opening song). Also, in the first episode, the reason some dialog was bleeped out is because one of the members of Tokio was mentioned. No big deal.

The dub and translation is where this release struggles the most. I'll be honest and say I'm no dub fan. Regardless, I understand the purpose of dub and can appreciate a good dub when I hear it. Laura Bailey is probably one of the most talented female voice actress out there for anime. She does a wonderful job filling the role of the main character, Sana Kurata. It's unfortunate to say that other characters are simply tragic. I'll just leave it at that. And the translation itself have some flaws mentioned by the other reviewer.

Regardless of some of the flaws, giving this wonderful series ""1-star"" is unwarranted since these flaws are easily avoided if watched in it's original language. This Funimation release isn't perfect by any means, but the quality of the series itself is definitely worth the price of this box set. Twenty-seven hyperactive, engaging, humorous, wacky, emotional roller coaster episodes for $40-something? Honestly, what are you waiting for?",1232928000,10,2375,4.8088235294117645

8291803,5,B001D5DQFC,"There is pretty much nothing I don't love about this anime. Sana-chan is just about the cutest thing in the whole universe, Hayama is adorably shy and quirky, and Sana-chan's mother is a HOOT!!! Oh man, every scene she's in, I'm always looking for her squirrel! This show is so goofy and random and overall, just great family fun! And the best part is, it doesn't have to just be for kids! There's plenty of things in here that an adult can very much appreciate and enjoy, especially the big reveal about Sana-chan and her mother. So for all you Japanese anime connoisseurs who are looking for something funny and new, BUY THIS NOW. And don't even think about watching it in English. The Japanese is SO MUCH MORE HILARIOUS! Especially Sana-chan. I actually read somewhere that the people who translated it for subtitles gave up trying to acurately translate some of her lines at some point because she was just so random! But what they did translate is still hilarious because it is so random! (And I'm mainly talking about when she's singing, not her actual serious dialogue or anything). So yeah. Buy this, love it, rate it with five stars. Because it's amazing, and watching it was one of my very fond childhood memories.",1394668800,,1224,4.671296296296297
8291804,4,B001D5DQFC,"It's an incredibly amusing story. Even people like me who generally avoid romance can enjoy this. Or perhaps there's just something generally less nauseating about preY2K romance comedies. This is the oldest example I know of trying to hook up a batshit crazy genki girl with a stone cold kuudere. The dub is excelent, but because of the switch from high-energy comedy to pure melodrama, Funimation dumped the series & you'll have to watch episodes 52-102 fansubbed.

Sana is a well-meaning, high spirited girl, yet unwittingly dark & brutal....She absolutely loves doing good deeds & helping others, & even declares herself to be a pacifist when it comes to physical fighting, but indulges in stalking, bullying, blackmail, extortion, & seems to be unaware of just how sadistic she is. She's crazy-strong & is the 2ed scariest person in school. She has a short temper, has manic depressive mood swings, scares her friends & classmates, causes scenes in public at least once daily, & indulges in the occasional punch, kick, & weapon assault; but it's cartoon violence played off for laughs. She's also a hypocrite; she goes out of her way to end Akito's bullying of school students & teacher, & stops his own family from bullying him, but she does it BY bullying him. & even after he's fallen for her, she continues to trash talk him, tease him, & use him as her personal punching bag.

There are of course lots of problems.....There are some random *BLAM episodes that contribute nothing to the stories, lengthy musical filler played ad nauseum in season 2, & recap episodes...That's a lot of filler, not to mention the fact that season 2 has a completely different genre & mood from season 1. There is a cultural goof in the New York arc of season 2, in which there is a female character named Secil. Not only was her name misspelled in english during character intro; it should actually spelled Cecil, which is a boy's name, & a very uncommon one in the United States at that; more common in Europe. The female equivalent is Cecilia. When Naozomi finds out she's his sister, he acts brokenhearted, despite him never showing any kind of romantic affection towards her, so the animators did a poor job of conveying romantic chemistry between them on his side.

There are a couple of story arcs involving another adult Sana gets a crush on that is never brought up again after it happens, including Gojo not even begin brought up when Sana's infatuation with older men is discussed. Also the subplot of the Kurata family hotsprings is only brought up again once & left unresolved. Akito seems to be a minor character in the anime, as of half way through season 1, with Naozumi arguably having way more screen time. There's a metric ton of misunderstandings, unspoken feelings, & putting other people's happiness before their own that westerners like me frown upon as weakness & contrived. Sana & Akito are also a prime example of The Precarious Couple Effect & no matter how much they keep telling themselves that they like eachother, I'm just not seeing the chemistry between them.

The effort they put into showing how compatible Sana & Akito are with other people was just more convincing while their desire to return to their first loves, like a hoarder unable to throw away garbage because it holds nostalgic sentiment. The coincidentally timed breakups with their new sweethearts is horribly contrived & everyone seems more interested in the happiness of the protagonists than with themselves, in fact their thoughts seem to revolve around either Akito or Sana like they had no lives of their own, not to mention that none of these characters act their age but think more like people in their late teens.

Speaking of awkward chemistry, we also have Rei & Asako. I'd like to point out that Asako has minimal character development & not much personality. Despite being a nice guy with good intentions, Rei's an indecisive two-timer. After breaking up with Sana to date his ex girlfriend, & Sana started treating him like Zenjiro 2.0 because of it, Rei immediately turned around & became Sana's dedicated buttmonkey fanboy. His dreams & goals involve having both women in his life forever, unwilling to chose one over the other. When Asako dumps him for always putting Sana before her & forgetting his promise to move to London with her, he manages to sweet talk her into waiting for him & keeping a long distance relationship. Despite this, he drools over the girl who works at Grandma Kurata's sauna & Misako's ex husband's fiance.

After the storyline stopped focusing on akward breakups based on stupid misunderstandings between Fuka & her crush, or Naozumi's sleezy & obnoxious new manager sabotaging the chemistry (& he disappears from the show entirely after this), Akito goes back to being absent from the show in a good deal of episodes, failing to show the audience exactly why he & Sana have any real chemistry with eachother. When he does show up after the breakup, their relationship is merely friendly, or he will find himself dragged into situations against his will or will be tagging along & not really contributing to the plot of the episode in any way.

The relationship between Sana & Akito does not progress from this point. The anime series ends with a teacher trying to get Akito expelled (think Yu Yu Hakusho) & Akito & Sana almost dying trying to prevent a new friend from committing suicide. Before closing, Akito steals a kiss & Sana punches him. They tell eachother that they'll tell eachother their feelings ""next time."" Aside from the fact that they've told eachother their feelings many times only to act no different the next day, there is no next time. The Deep Clear one-shot manga was not adapted into animation & the anime diverts heavily from the manga, so the anime has an unresolved ending.",1392336000,,5833,4.827
8291805,5,B001D5DQFC,"the first season of kodocha was funny as hell

8291806,5,B001D5DQFC,"Kodocha is a very enjoyable, family-friendly anime about a young girl's life balancing school with her work as a child actress.  The show manages to blend a tone of light-heartedness and often frenetic comedy with moments of true gentleness and emotion, and it is this contrast that makes it so unique.  The main character, Sana, is possibly one of the most endearing characters I've ever seen in anime.  She is headstrong and confident, but with her own apprehensions that are easy to sympathize with.  She is kind to others, but also willing to be confrontational when necessary.  She provides a great deal of the silliness of the show, but there is a sense of thoughtfulness and maturity that underlies her actions.  Most of the series success is a direct result of the wonderful flavour that she brings to the table.

Although it may not be immediately obvious from the outset, a lot of serious topics are also brought up in the show, ranging from abuse, teenage pregnancy, and child abandonment.  But the show never descends into angst as tends to happen with anime of this type.  Instead, the show simply pauses the comedy, gives the subject room to breathe, then allows the characters to move on.  It is this approach that I found made the show compelling for both kids and adults.  Whereas some anime over-inflate the problems of children and teenagers, Kodocha treats its emotional points in a down-to-earth manner, always looking forward and using them as opportunities for the characters to grow.

A great show for all ages.",1381536000,,1535,4.861538461538461
8291807,5,B001D5DQFC,"Sana is an 11-year-old TV star. Her show, Child's Toy, is very popular. You would think that a girl that's a TV star would have a wonderful life. That's true, until she gets to school. Akito Hayama, aka ""the Money Boss"", is causing all sorts of trouble at school. Learning is impossible with all the boys raising hell. Sana hatches a plan to rectify the problem. After her school is a healthy environment, Sana learns more about Akito and his sad living situation. She then decides to turn his life into a happy one.

This anime is so off the wall. I haven't seen one quite like this before. It has good animation (for 1996), great voice acting, and a fun soundtrack. I think that my favorite part of this series is Laura Bailey's voice acting job. She does an excellent job. I think it may be one of the better voice acting jobs I've ever heard.

There are plenty of cool characters in Kodocha. There is also a good mix of comedy and drama. Although this anime is ridiculous most of the time, it does have some serious situations, and some dramatic moments. It's totally fun. It's a shame that it's so expensive. Most of the time, you can get out of paying a high price for anime if you shop around. Unfortunately, I don't think you can avoid it in this case. I still recommend it, and I think it's a show that every anime fan can enjoy.",1358899200,,1338,4.348

In ways the show is very emmotional when you see how the characters are reacting to tradegy, or a love moment between one character and another. I truly give this series five stars up and I reccomend this series to any new anime fan and many other shows as well from the 1990s to now like Pokemon, and Digimon etc. I garuntee that new anime fans will love this romantic comedy story.",1344988800,,574,4.275229357798165

8291810,4,B001D5DQFC,"There's plenty of reasons to steer clear from Kodocha in the U.S. Some of the Japanese voices were cut out of this version. The first opening credit sequence couldn't make it overseas. Even the dubs don't sound the same in English.

However, you'll miss out on all the crazy jokes and funky antics of a child television star as she learns about friendship and love.

The story of this girl's anime follows a simple plot that has been used hundreds of times in romantic comedies with children. A group of boys are causing trouble in Sana's elementary school class. The leader of the boys, Akito Hayama, is also threatening to blackmail the teacher with an embarassing photograph.

Sana takes matters into her own hands, by blackmailing Akito with an equally embarassing photograph of him literally with his trousers down. When Sana learns about how Akito's family hates him, though, she has a change of heart. Sana decides to use her talent as a television actress to teach the family a lesson about love.

Although the anime follows a tried-and-true formula, it's more well known for Sana's hyper attitude. Sana runs around in a frantic pace, pulling off random jokes here and there with her loyal bodyguard, Katagiri. Whenever she comes home, she always remembers to pull off a funky rap about her nonsensical life. Her mother is a best-selling author with a birdhouse on her head. If that wasn't enough, there's a white Babbit creature with the ears of a rabbit and the wings of a bat, that keeps appearing to narrate the story.

As weird and random as this story is told, though, it really tells a heartwarming story. Funimation had trouble importing the series, though. For whatever reason, they couldn't retrieve the very first opening sequence and had to replace it with the second opening. They also couldn't bring the last 50 episodes of the series over. On top of this, they couldn't get the voices of some of the famous Japanese stars who appeared in the anime.

What's important is that at least half of the story survived, so that Funimation could produce decent subtitles and a pretty reasonable English dub. Some of Sana's raps don't sound nearly as funny because of the fast rhythms and the awkward translation from Japanese to English. However, it still sounds pretty good, considering how hard the voice actors had to work just to get everything to hold together.

So this series is definitely worth a purchase. As long as you're not expecting the whole enchilada, this is one of the better shoujo anime shows at a remarkably low price. Just think: if the Japanese companies provided even more content, this could have been one of the hottest DVD boxes in the 2000s.",1297036800,,2683,4.794372294372295
