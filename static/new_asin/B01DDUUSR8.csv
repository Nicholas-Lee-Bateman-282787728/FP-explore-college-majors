7711706,5,B01DDUUSR8,"I bought this much cheaper from amazon.uk, since I have a region-free player. If you like British mysteries, you can buy a region-free player and get access to them much cheaper even with postage, if you are willing to wait a few weeks longer. When my husband told me that Rowan Atkinson was playing Maigret, I thought he was mistaken. Mr. Bean? Johnny English? I had read Simenon back in the 60's, had watched the French versions and own the Michael Gambon series. Wow! Was I wrong! Rowan Atkinson is every inch the quiet, insightful, observant detective of Simenon's novels. Janvier and LaPointe are also well-cast. The scenery is all you could hope for and the plots are well written. I hope Atkinson will do many more of Maigret episodes. It is a part he was born to play.",1486425600,9,776,4.589928057553957
7711707,5,B01DDUUSR8,"Here is a new adaptation of Georges Simenon's Inspector Maigret, the French police inspector who solves murders with a dogged determination reminiscent of Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot.  Several actors have played Maigret over the years, Charles Laughton being the first, with Michael Gambon's performances being very popular.  Rowan Atkinson is Maigret. A surprising choice because he is better known as Mr. Bean, and while his talents at comedy are well known, this is the first serious role he has tackled.  Critics were not all that enthused about his performances, perhaps unable to enjoy his playing a serious role, but I thought that he is just excellent.  His dry, expressionless performances reminds me of Michael Kitchen who was so fabulous in ""Foyles War.""  Two episodes have been filmed so far, with two more due in 2017.  With 76 Simenon novels and 28 short stories, producers have plenty of material. The villain in ""Maigret's Dead Man"" is John Light, the equally villainous Hercule Flambeau in the ""Father Brown"" Series. Note:  the DVD I purchased is a Region 2 DVD, not playable on US DVD players (unless you have purchased a unit that plays all regions).  One assumes it will be released as a Region 1 DVD eventually.",1485561600,11,1237,5.0
8755610,2,B01DDUUSR8,"A real shame that this production fell flat.  After one has seen the production of Maigret featuring Michael Gambon, all others perhaps will fail the test.  Atkinson although a versatile brilliant artist did not convince nor engage.  I can only think the script was sadly lacking.  We watched only the first two episodes, twice and arrived at the same conclusions.  The music overwhelms and is rather unnecessarily over the top (a fugitive racing along stairs, with overly dramatic drum beats - really?  Old).  Atkinson's character is monotone, colorless, unconvincing.  The entire production lacked the quiet, therefore tenser and more engaging dialogue of Gambon's Maigret.  The writers/producers ""tried"" a different tack, but it didn't work.  The supporting cast also lacked the strength of Gambon's Maigret including Atkinson's wife.  There were too many examples of mellow dramatics and ""filler"".  Pass.",1531526400,,908,5.5

8755612,5,B01DDUUSR8,"It is only recently I happened upon the excellent series on PBS  ""Maigret"" starring Rowan Atkinson.

I have long been an admirer of Mr. Atkinson in his comedic rolls, especially the first series I was introduced to him, ""Black Adder"",

I supposed ""Maigret"" would be a  French detective along the same lines of Peter Sellers in his role as Inspector Clouseau.

Inspector Maigret is a very sensitive, empathetic and intelligent man. He is involved with the victims and their families in seeking to bring

a dignified and kindly closure to each case which comes within his scope.

Mr. Atkinson, I applaud the depth and many-layered performance you bring to this new role as Inspector Jules Maigret.

I am enjoying this new series",1523664000,,726,4.89344262295082
8755613,5,B01DDUUSR8,"I love detective and mystery/murder series. I had heard of George Simenon's Maigret, but had not seen any movie adaptations. Do yourself a favour and get this series if you are a murder/mystery fan. The setting is Paris, but don't think the actors use fake French accents. They use local British accents and it works perfectly. The acting is superb with a stellar cast headed up by Rowan Atkinson. He delivers a perfect Maigret, as David Suchet delivers the perfect Hercule Poirot. I loved the cinematography, the setting, the attention to detail, the script. Atkinson is best remembered, sadly, more for his funny man parts like Mr Bean and Blackadder. But he is a fine actor and I have enjoyed his 'normal' roles immensely (watch Keeping Mum for unbelievable dark comedy!). I hope he gets more of this kind of role in future. A brilliant series. A must-see (if that a word).",1521504000,,876,4.769736842105263
8755614,4,B01DDUUSR8,"Don't be put off by seeing Mr. Bean as Maigret. Many comedians have played serious roles and done quite well; such as Jackie Gleason, Eddie Murphy & John Candy. Robin Williams won an Oscar for Good Will Hunting and Murphy has been nominated for Best Actor in many films.
I also had to fight the feeling of wanting to see Michael Gambon, whose 1992-93 version of Maigret is quite good. But that wouldn't have been fair to Atkinson or the entire Production.
In the two movie episodes from 2016, Atkinson plays the part as serious & thoughtful as one would expect. He seems to downplay Maigret with only a couple amusing lines throughout. I appreciated those few chuckles & realized that it was Maigret I was laughing with, not any of those other characters he has played.
Production values appear to be very good. France circa 1955, the sets appear convincing and the music quite well done. These two aspects reminded me of the later Poirot episodes starring David Suchet.
Many foreign locales with English production & acting suffer a bit when trying to use English with an accent of that particular locale. Fortunately these episodes do not bother us with this unnecessary step. Here, if I recall correctly, only the names of people or places are spoken in fluent French. You may not need subtitles but they are available.
I will not reveal any of the plot lines but they are good; from the French writer & creator of Maigret, Georges Simenon.

I'm already looking forward to the two episodes from 2017.
Here's hoping there will be more!",1518393600,2,1537,4.713754646840148
8755615,5,B01DDUUSR8,"Atkinson is one of my favorite actors, so I might be biased. However, my non-Atkinson-fan husband agreed that this is an excellent Maigret series! Atkinson's performance is on par with Gambon's! Waiting for the next episode! Note that this DVD is in a PAL (European) format and will not play on ordinary player.",1509235200,2,311,4.886792452830188
8755616,5,B01DDUUSR8,have seen on the internet. Rowan is an excellent Maigret and thank goodness it's in english. Hopefully BBC will fund the complete Maigret series - there were episodes left unmade with Bruno Cremer. It would be great to have all episodes. The supporting cast is one of the strengths.,1504051200,2,282,4.775510204081633

8755619,5,B01DDUUSR8,"Rowan Atkinson did an excellent job in his portrayal of Maigret.

The 2 episodes were well written and well acted by all the characters.

Although I have seen the majority of episodes of Bruno Cremer playing Maigret; whom I think does the best Maigret.

Nevertheless Rowan Atkinson did a remarkable job.

At no time did I think about Mr Bean or Blackadder or Inspector Fowler while watching the show.",1487376000,8,400,4.753623188405797
