The main problem is that our station here in San Diego was so lame that they put a football game on instead of Part 2.

1568249,5,B00005JPHZ,"This docudrams for the first time depicts accurately the war on terrorism. It illustrates the ineptness of the Clinton administration. It illustrates the the fact that the Clinton administrastion response to numerous attacks was to treat them as a law enforcement issue rather than the realization that these attacks were an act of war by a very determined enemy, the terrorists i.e. Osama bin Laden.

This docudrama should be viewed by all Americans.",1158883200,33,451,5.178082191780822

It shows that decisions as leaders are extremely important and will change the course of history for better of for worse.  It also shows how inter connected the world is.  At first it was hard to follow the way the camera man filmed it but it is the new way and it is rally need the way it is done.  The drama is great.",1315699200,,497,3.9696969696969697
1568311,5,B00005JPHZ,"The Path to 9/11 captivates from the opening minutes until the emotional conclusion.

Check out the documentary ""Blocking the Path to 9/11"" for the full story of the smear campaign against the Emmy-award winning miniseries.",1314489600,2,337,5.035714285714286
1568312,5,B00005JPHZ,I spent the afternoon watxching this on You Tube...no wonder the Clintons don't want it out there doesn't do Former President Bush much good either. I cannot help but wonder how many of the faults leading up to 9/11 have been corrected betting not many,1313625600,,252,4.622222222222222
1568313,5,B00005JPHZ,Fortunately I recorded this historic epic on my DVD recorder and watch it on every anniversary.  But I'd like a clean high-quality blu ray especially to watch on 9/11/11.,1309219200,2,170,4.862068965517241
1568314,5,B00005JPHZ,"There are perhaps a few important points. First, this movie is a docudrama--that is, it is not intended to be a pure documentary. As such, viewers should be aware that scenes and themes are similar to what actually happened. The scenes mean to represent, but not portray with total accuracy, real events. This aspect of the film caused some controversy as some found flaw with portrayals. My position would be that the portrayals were fine and the docudrama aspect of the film was openly acknowledged. Further, the scenes in question reflected the sense of what was reported in the bipartisan effort of the 9/11 Commission Report. Page 140, is one example of this point.

Second, the film seems to be, for many, a powerful reminder of the events which lead to the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington DC. We hear many people say ""never forget."" This film may help that time not to be forgotten. While the 9/11 Commission Report is very good (if at least a little flawed), it is inaccessible to many due to its length. This film solves that problem. It brings the power of the series of events to those who would see them again or those not wanting to read hundreds of pages. It could also potentially bring the story to those not old enough to remember.

Lastly, acting was excellent. The actor who portrayed Massoud was wonderful. Many have also noted great performances from Harvey Keitel and Mark Wahlberg's brother, Donnie. It does seem unfair to single these individuals out though. All acting was without weakness.

I'd prefer that this was shown again or released on disc. The tenth anniversary of September 11 rapidly approaches. However, I suspect that political forces will stop this from happening. To me, that's unfortunate.",1304467200,4,1747,4.8361204013377925
1568315,5,B00005JPHZ,"Like many other people, I was outraged when this docu-drama was consigned to the ash-heaps of history, in flagrant violation of the First Amendment.

Yes, I've had chats with ""liberal"" friends who say, ""It wasn't just the Clintons, a lot of people were very upset by this.""  Well, an awful lot of people don't like the Marquis de Sade, either, but he's in print and for sale.  Somehow, ""The Path to 9/11"" just got flushed.

However, 5-6 years later, it has ""escaped"" to DVD.  I managed to get a copy from Canada, and watching it only increased my outrage.  It's an excellent film!  I even learned something from it: Khalid Sheikh Mohamad (KSM) was Ramzi Yousef's uncle.  What a wonderful family they were: Ramzi was the one who planted the truck-bomb under the World Trade Center, and whose fiendish heart was broken when the bombed tower failed to collapse into the other tower.  KSM was of course the mastermind behind 9/11.

This film should be freely available in the US, if only to shut up the Truthers with the actual truth.  But who has the backbone to do it??

That's a sad question, isn't it?

If you want to understand how American censorship works, I suggest&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blocking-The-Path-To-9-11/dp/B001GLLNNA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blocking The Path To 9/11</a>.",1298592000,2,1342,5.244131455399061

1568317,5,B00005JPHZ,You gotta love the free market.  Not only can this movie be had but you can get the unedited version.  Tell ABC to go to hell with their sensorship.  All you have to do is do a google search and you can buy it from an overseas supplier for about $20.  I would give you the website but I don't think the Amazon people would like that.  ABC is screwing over their shareholders by not releasing this.  The shareholders spent 40 million dollars making this movie and it was aired without commercials and they still won't release it due to political pressure.,1283644800,3,554,4.382352941176471
1568318,5,B00005JPHZ,"I watched this docu-drama about the Path to 9/11 and I loved it.  It hit a real nerve with me.  It played for 2 nights on ABC and I stayed up late to watch as much as I could.  I really, really, REALLY wish that the liberal powers-that-be would stop their fascistic censorship of this film and let the ""masses"" watch it again!

I really liked the characters played by Harvey Keitel (John O'Neil, FBI man who died in 9/11) and Mark Wahlberg (CIA field guy).  That's because I appreciate courageous men whose characters aren't critically weakened & compromised by political correctness, and can still say the TRUTH.  I.e., they were ""no-BS"" men.  They dealt with the reality and the horror of anti-US Islamic terrorism, up close and personal.  Then, when they ran into complacent, PC, arrogant, pompous political clowns like Madeline Albright (Dept of State) and Barbara Bodine (Ambassador to Yemen), the story exposes the latter's extreme patheticness and lack of real-life experience.  Actually, Condoleeza Rice also gets skewered in the film for likewise being clueless.  Maybe that's another reason why the Clintons and the RULING LIBERAL ELITE killed the production of this excellent, outstanding and hard-hitting docu-drama:  it wasn't very nice to clueless Governmental women bureaucrats!  (Did you ever run across one?  The liberal complacent, pompous, effete jerk on a power trip because they're in the government? Not a nice bunch, and admittedly as many men are in this role as women!)

Another thing I loved about the movie was its tracking of the 9/11 story from 1993, when the World Trade Center was bombed the first time.  And yes, it DID go into the fecklessness and incompetant ineptness of the Clinton's tree-hugger administration.  (But Bush did not get a pass either!!) It's not like we didn't have warning about the 9/11 attacks.

I know that our puppet-masters want us to ""forget about it,"" but I remember the controversy over the docu-drama right before it aired.  The Democrats had a cow and immediately rushed to sue, to denounce, to threaten etc. even BEFORE the film was shown.  Then, the gutless ABC put out disclaimers before every episode on TV, something like ""Don't believe a word in this thing, we know it stinks, we're sorry we made it, it's just a fantasy, we love the Clintons, Go Democrats"" etc etc The docu-drama was really good despite the ridiculous disclaimer.

If enough people push for the production of it, then maybe millions more Americans will see The Path to 9/11 someday. It's definitely worth it!",1281052800,,2544,4.9411764705882355
1568319,5,B00005JPHZ,I saw parts of this miniseries on ABC when it aired. It is very well done and has multiple source materials including the 9/11 commission report.

1568379,5,B00005JPHZ,"I saw this movie about 1 1/2 years ago. Why did the government did not take action capturing this bastard osama? ABC crew interviwed him we knew where he was and still this guy is on the loose. What went wrong with our intel? I hope this guy is caught soon so we can cricify his ass for all the people who died in New york. i worked on those towers for 7 years and I saw them come down and what it did was to get my angrier because it could have been prevented. I love my city New york and I am a 100% new Yorker. I am sorry all those people died. This DVD needs to come out soon so that people undertand what really happened. God bless United States!!!!!

1568380,5,B00005JPHZ,"To me this documentary changed my mindset from liberal to conservative.  Like the above writer, I wondered about the accuracy of the content.  The fact that Bill Clinton had 13 chances to take out bin Laden before his delay leading up to 9/11.  In the aruments I had with liberals, I developed the following response: 'Okay, let's say that 13 chances is an exaggeration.  No one ever denied the documentary.  Let's say your right.  Let's just say that there were 10 chances; maybe 9; no, maybe 8; maybe 7; maybe 6; maybe 5; maybe 4; wait, let's just say he had only 1 chance to take out the man who financed 9/11.  If, in fact, it is true, then, in my eyes the blood od 9/11 is on Clinton's hands'.  And during Hilary's run for president, Disney was about to release the documentary to DVD.  But, using their deep pockets, it was put away for awhile.  Now that the dust is settled, there is talk that Disney might just release it.

One additional thought, if it were fiction, why did Bill blow up about it on TV news?  And, when did they start putting good docudrams back in the vault?",1256342400,3,1085,4.37
1568381,1,B00005JPHZ,"As somebody who actually saw this miniseries (unlike the authors of the many 5-star ""reviews"" I've read here), I can tell you a lot of money was invested in this teleplay. Fine actors giving fine performances. And excellent production values to boot.

But it was very much biased against the Clinton Administration and quite lenient on the Bush Administration. This should come as no surprise when it's discovered the screenwriter was known to be a neo-con.

And this point of view would be fine...if it had been accurate.

I've read enough books and articles to understand that neither administration handled Al Qaeda perfectly, but the Clinton Administration was very much focused on fighting them and thwarted many efforts to attack the United States. It is also a known fact that the Clinton Administration warned the incoming Bush Administration of the terrorist threat. And that warning was ignored. Then it was too late.

One need only read Richard Clarke's book AGAINST ALL ENEMIES to get an understanding of this. And before you dare suggest Clarke is somehow discredited, even this very miniseries finds itself depicting Clarke for what he is and always was: a patriot and hero against terrorism.

It's the one thing PATH TO 9-11 got right.",1255219200,3,1250,5.019323671497585

1568383,5,B00005JPHZ,"When did it get ""fashionable"" to prevent the distribution of ANY film? Isn't our culture one of Anti-censureship, in any form? I saw this when it came out on TV and decided that this was one of those films that one should have in their library along with ""13 Days"", ""JFK"", ""Battle of Britain"", ""John Adams"", ""The Great Raid"", as well as other films of historical contributing value. But alas, there are those who deem it inappropriate to our fragile senses. Who died and made them our ""Gods""? Whether you believe in it's premise or not, this film depicts a view during an important time in history. As such, it should be made available to all, because we were ALL effected by the events of 9/11 and this is just one side of the coin and there are those of us who feel that we should not be prevented of purchasing this film just because it offends some!

I enlarged the picture of Dvd that they make believe it's from Canada. I thought this website looked reliable so I placed the order. But when I got this Dvd everything is completely opposite to the advertising. They sent me ""A BOOTLEG"" because the art work on case is from copy machine and the art work on disks is from screen printing. The video & audio is also so bad. I think they recorded from TV and transferred to Dvd. I emailed to the website why they sent me a bootleg they answered briefly ""It's not a bootleg"".

It is sad and rather scary to know as well, that so very many people in the US probably think that Moore's moronic documentary is actually history - while ""Path to 9/11"" is just political propaganda.  Hats off to Olbermann and Friends of Bill - you are providing a true public service by keeping us intellectually limited people safe from knowing more than is good for us.

In the second part appears all the investigations that lead to osama bin laden as the principal chief of Al Qaeda and the failed efforts to capture him. It's curious why this docudrama can not be sold to the audiencie, it looks like that there's someone is blocking that this can be public. The fact here is that all the leaders in the world can make mistakes sometimes, at the end, they are men of flesh and bone.

It inspired me to spend countless hours Googling bios on key people like FBI special agent John O'Neill, and Gen. Massoud, the anti-Taliban leader of Afghanistan's Northern Alliance.  Fascinating to say the least!

I have been waiting with bated breath to own this movie and share it with my family, and I'm shaking my head in disbelief at it's release being suppressed.  Again I ask, what country are we living in?  More to the point, if you are as alarmed as I am by the things that are happening, what are you doing about it?  I encourage everyone to stay PRO-active on the issues......apathy will destroy us.",1191888000,15,1120,4.673469387755102
1568501,5,B00005JPHZ,"I was recording this when it first aired because I work nights. The first night went off with out a hitch, but the second night all I got were the opening and ending credits. So I missed the second half, and I have been waiting for it to come out on dvd. However, I do believe the Hilary angle. I found the LA Times article on the web. ABC is not allowing it to be sold during this campaign season. I would like to be proved wrong, but ABC only responds to e-mails and letters only in a standard form letter.

I first wrote a statement on this in 2007, it is now 2013. ABC has yet to release the DVD. I have two bad copies, one of the actual broadcast and the second is the unedited version. The picture quality is not great so I would like to buy an authorized version. ABC is still bowing to political pressure and will not release it. Why? Why else, the Democrats seemed to want that tired old lady in 2016 and yet another Bush is making noises about running for the GOP. Until the Clinton's and the Bush's leave presidential politics behind, this may never be released.

The sad part is the film, "" The Path to 9/11,"" showed both Clinton and Bush in a bad light. Most of all nothing has seemed to have changed as the events in Boston show. People are still getting into the country, who mean us harm. They meant harm then and they mean us harm now, that was the true lesson of this film.",1190505600,7,1391,4.148148148148148

It points the finger of blame, not so much at any person or administration, but at the *mentality* that got us to 9/11.

1568663,5,B00005JPHZ,"It would seem that because one of the candidates running for President, (God forbid)we are NEVER going to see the sale of this remarkable DVD. It is a sad truth that in this nation, a nation that is supposed to be about free speech and liberty, we have to see a DVD so blatantly be suppressed simply because the Clinton administration is heavily responsible in allowing the most horrific attack on US soil. It speaks volumes of what kind of regime we WILL HAVE should she, HIllary that is, be elected. (heaven help us) She is a manipulator and still has the Master Manipulator in Bill Clinton, around to squash any damaging evidence that will impede her road onto the White House. The Clintons, in my opinion, are totally responsible for not having the DVD of "" A Path to 9/11 "" to be seen by many that didn't get a chance to see this great and glaring movie. It is a movie that really should be recognized as a documentary. Unlike the science fiction movies that Michael Moore makes, A path to 9/11 is full of truth and vividly explains why Osama Bin laden was allowed to grow in power, create the hostile environment of terrorism in the middle east, and then plan the most deadliest attack in US history. You will see how little the Clinton administration did to prevent him or even kill him, simply because they ""didn't have no legal authority"" to do so. It is this type of incompetance and ignorance that will be repeated again should Hillary, and let's not leave out Barack Hussein Obama either because he would be just as horrible if not worse, than Hillary, should he be our new president. (Good lord don't let this happen)This movie is an outline if not a full desription, of what another clinton presidency would mean. We would be summarily attacked again and again, over and over until this nation is defeated or has to capitulate to the terrorists demands! Look at what's happening in Israel today. It is a common thing for them to see suicide bombers or rockets explode and kill more of their people. The only reason they haven't been wiped off the face of this earth is not only because the US backs them. It's because of the fact that they fight back the terrorists in their own way! They hunt them down, even though it is against this country's policy, and systematically kill them. Is this what you want to have in this country? Do we REALLY want to ""live"" with suicide bombers exploding themselves in malls all across this nation, or in our very busy tunnels and bridges. Do we need to see more buildings come down with thousands more people killed or injured again? WE MUST STOP TAKING OUR VOTES FOR PRESIDENT OF THIS COUNTRY AS A JOKE! WE MUST UNITE AGAINST ANY AND ALL WHO DO NOT FIT THE ROLE AS PRESIDENT, DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN, AND SOUNDLY BEAT THEM, AS REAGAN DID TO MONDALE & BUSH SR. DID TO DUKAKIS, SO THAT THEY NEVER RUN AGAIN!!

1568666,5,B00005JPHZ,"Absolutely brilliant.

It pulls no punches. It leaves no stone unturned. And it was not about heaping the blame entirely on the Clinton administration. The very end text of the movie discusses the poor grades given by the 9/11 commission, as to how its recommendations have (not) been implemented. Can't blame that one on Clinton. And Condoleeza Rice hardly comes off great from the movie, being one of the individuals in government ""changing the role"" of Harvey Keitel's character, the late CIA director John O' Neil. The detractors of this movie from Clinton's administration were completely missing the point. This is a wake up call to ALL of us. And whether they like it or not, they made mistakes as well.

The facts are accurate from the 9/11 Commission report. It is beautifully shot, using close up and confined camera angles to really make you feel like you are there, like the action is all up close. And the ultimate tragedy of it is that it is true. John O Neil died at the WTC, after working so hard for so many years to arrest the people who murdered him and 3,000 Americans.

But the reaction to this movie demonstrated brilliantly where we are at in this country with regards to terrorism. We put partisan politics and bickering ahead of what is best for our nation. This movie should have rightly been heralded as the wake up call we needed, five years after the tragedy. But instead, it was ""Don't blame me, blame the other guy."" Bureaucrats, yes on the right as well as the left, refuse to take responsibility for their actions.

I fear that it will take another tragedy, on a far worse scale than 9/11, to wake us up. And that, is the final pity of it all.",1168473600,40,1676,4.558139534883721

I am sure that liberties were taken with dialogue and compacting events, but nonetheless the viewer got a real sense of how the FBI, CIA and executive branch reacted to the growing terrorist threats against America. And, despite living in NYC during most of the time period covered by the film and following international news reasonably closely, the film really brought home to me as an individual how the Al Qaeda threat escalated while America essentially ignored it. It also brought home that America was very lucky several times as plots failed or were foiled. The film is particularly powerful when considered against the current scene of Iran's provocations in the last year (nuclear development, anti-Israel and anti-American rhetoric and threats, support of Hezbollah) and the Iraq Study Group's utterly naive view that Iran and Syria, long-time provocateurs and supporters of anti-Western terrorism, can in any way be partners.

Why?

Because President Bill Clinton and his rabid dogs made sure it would never see the light of day.

Why?

Because Clinton thought it portrayed him in a bad light insofar as the events that led to 9/11 along with all the missed opportunities that occurred during his administration when we could have easily nailed bin Laden.  Remember Bill's wife was gearing up for her presidential run in 2008 and they thought this movie would directly impact her chances to win the Democratic nomination.

Did it portray Clinton that badly?

Not to any greater degree then it portrayed George Bush the exact same way.  In other words, the film's point was to show the critical failures of both administrations that led to 9/11.  It certainly wasn't an attempt by the Republicans to bash Clinton as many (nutcases) have claimed.

What makes you think you know that, smart guy?

Watch Cyrus Nowrasteh's film called ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blocking-The-Path-To-9-11/dp/B001GLLNNA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blocking The Path To 9/11</a>"".  Cyrus made both films and shows *exactly* what happened and why this film was buried.  This film you CAN buy here on Amazon.  I highly recommend it even if you haven't seen Path.  The only downside to seeing ""Blocking the Path to 9/11""  is that it will only want to make you see Path that much more if you haven't already seen it.

Is it likely that The Path to 9/11 will ever be released?

Hopefully.  Write to Disney (they own the rights) and tell them you want it released.

Is there any place to find ""Path to 9/11"" online?

Possibly.  There is a rumor going around that some people want to make sure that other people can see this film and have made some efforts to make sure it's available until Disney releases it for sale. You will have to use your imagination as it's not like I get a torrent of information on this sort of thing.  Seek and ye shall find.",1356307200,4,2157,4.798913043478261

I'm calling out Disney and ABC for refusing to release this film. They are a bunch of cowards, period. Now all of those who feel the same way should email the corporate idiots at both Disney and ABC and tell them how you feel. I just sent my email today to Disney. If there is anyone out there who wants to form a petition then reply to my post. The more the people show that they want this film to be put out on DVD/Blu Ray then maybe enough of us can convince those morons to do the right thing. Thank you.",1347321600,4,621,4.098360655737705
7941819,5,B00005JPHZ,The Movie that finally tells the truth about 911.  Not allowing to be sold it on DVD is a form of censorship.  The Clintons and their cronies want to block the distribution of this film.  Where is the free speech?  Where is the 1st Amendment?,1329955200,3,242,4.311111111111111

I am sick of you whiners saying that President Clinton's administration was so unfairly depicted and President Bush was so unscathed.

First of all, the docudrama shows the confusion of dealing with a terrorist network in a ""United Nations"" world.

Secondly, Clinton WAS President for EIGHT YEARS while nothing was done.  Wouldn't that seem to be enough time to figure out that we really should kill UBL rather than just waffle around about it?  President Bush was president for 9 months before 9/11.....

YOU DO THE MATH

RELEASE THE DVD!!!",1316908800,6,624,4.669724770642202
7941821,5,B00005JPHZ,"This movie is worth release, however I fear it will never see the light of day again. I myself burned three copies of it when it was on, so I can watch it pretty much whenever I want, but I know others can't and for that I feel to keep this movie shelved is wrong. What is so scary about this movie being made available? What are certain people afraid of? That we'll know the truth? I know I would buy it in a heartbeat. Everyone is pretty much against any form of censorship. So why is the sale and airing of this movie prohibited? Make this movie available to the public. It tells a true story of what failures and incompetences occured that allowed that tragic day to happen.",1315785600,3,678,4.223076923076923
