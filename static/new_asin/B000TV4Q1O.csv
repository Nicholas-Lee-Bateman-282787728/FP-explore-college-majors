2910454,5,B000TV4Q1O,"Hard to add much to the previous review.  The songs are incredible, the performances phenomenal.  Moreover, the production of this DVD is probably the best I've ever seen for a concert DVD: multiple, clear angles and great sound.  Brendan Canty is an amazing addition to Bob's band.  Plenty of songs, both old and new, making for a great setlist.  Best $20 I've spent in a while.",1193011200,6,379,4.681818181818182
2910455,5,B000TV4Q1O,"I saw this concert and it was easily my favorite show of 2005. There is a great chemistry between Bob and his band: Brendan Canty (drums), Jason Narducy (bass, backing vocals) and Rich Morel (keyboards, backing vocals). It's a great representation of new and older material, with a nice focus on the stellar ""Copper Blue"" LP by Sugar. I saw a few shows on this tour, and this was by far my favorite. The DVD nicely captures the performance, my only complaint is that it doesn't quite show the energy of the audience. But it's a minor complaint. Any Bob Mould/Husker Du/Sugar fan will love this DVD. Great performance.",1192147200,11,617,4.669724770642202
2910456,5,B000TV4Q1O,"The show as recorded exceeded all my expectations.  From a performance in 2005,  Bob Mould is in top form and his backing band is tremendous.  Spanning all areas of his career (Husker Du, Sugar, solo), it is a credit to his talents that the songs flow as a seamless canon, the high standard he set for himself early on being met over and over again.  It's difficult to point to highlights as the music is intense yet lovingly delivered throughout,  but particular songs that stood out for me on first listen were ""I am Vision, I am Sound"", ""Underneath Days"" and ""If I Can't Change Your Mind"".  Great songs of his that I would have also liked to have heard are not included- ""JC Auto"", for one- but it certainly doesn't take away from the songs that are and, again, despite his now long career he looks to be in his prime here and this is as solid an example of his brilliance and skill as you could ever find.",1402617600,,909,4.317647058823529
2910457,5,B000TV4Q1O,Bob Mould Rocks and this is a great concert that displays how awesome Bob Mould is.  Recommended for Husker Du and Sugar Fans.  One of the founders of Alternative Music.,1366934400,,169,4.6
2910458,5,B000TV4Q1O,"All I can say is that if you are a Husker Du fan or Bob Mould fan this dvd is for you.
The musicians Bob plays with on this live performance are top notch. Bob's guitar
playing is unbelievable. The entire dvd is great. He covers his own material but does
quite a few Husker Du songs some dated back to early albums. If you like Bob or
Husker Du you have to get this dvd.  Like I said the guys he has picked to play with
on this tour are all top notch musicians and they do all the music proud. And if you
know Husker Du or Bob Mould his guitar work here is over the top and just a joy
to see. Get this dvd.......",1355702400,,612,3.78125
2910459,2,B000TV4Q1O,"Ahhhh, well something is missing.
I love all of Bob's work and seen him in concert,
but there is a lack of energy and I did not feel it.
I saw Bob acoustic and that was great, but this DVD,
well did not do it for me.

Still a big big fan.",1231200000,,238,3.576923076923077
2910460,4,B000TV4Q1O,"This DVD of Bob Mould's show delivers as promised.  He performs a wide-range of his material during the performance and the sound is good.  My only reserve is that the excitement level is a bit low, so it is hard to tell how much of a crowd impact was taking place.  But this is not a reason to not buy the DVD if you're a fan of his work spanning the length of his career.",1228262400,,373,3.9466666666666668
2910461,5,B000TV4Q1O,"So, late last year Bob Mould released a DVD entitled Circle of Friends - Live at the 9:30 Club. I've stopped buying music dvds for the simple fact that, even if I absolutely love the artist who put out the disc, I'll watch it once or twice and then it gets shelved. But I really wanted to see this concert. Thank god for Netflix. I queued that motherf*cker up and a day later...BAM! Bob Mould in concert. So how is it? Well,...after finishing the disc, I immediately went online to check out Mould live dates and a day later I watched it again. It is a must for any Bob Mould fan.

The songs: All the eras are covered in the show. That's correct. ALL eras. Hsker D material has more than just a foothold in the set list. It is an amazing set list punched up by a great backing band. My favorite Bob Mould record is Sugar's Copper Blue...come to think of it...it is one of my favorite records period. The first time I heard it I was completely floored by the album's cohesiveness -thematically and musically- and its ferocity. It just doesn't let up. The one acoustic track, If I Can't Change Your Mind, is just as fierce. So you can imagine my delight when he opened the set with three tracks from the record. All in all, seven of the ten songs from Copper Blue are in the show. His 2005 record, Body of Song gets the same treatment and holds up well with Mould's older and arguably more popular stuff. If I could have written the set list, it would have been very similar to what they played.

Track listing:
""The Act We Act"" (Sugar, Copper Blue)
""A Good Idea"" (Sugar, Copper Blue)
""Changes"" (Sugar, Copper Blue)
""Circles"" (Bob Mould, Body of Song)
""Paralyzed"" (Bob Mould, Body of Song)
""I Am Vision, I Am Sound"" (Bob Mould, Body of Song)
""Underneath Days"" (Bob Mould, Body of Song)
""Hoover Dam"" (Sugar, Copper Blue)
""See A Little Light"" (Bob Mould, Workbook)
""High Fidelity"" (Bob Mould, Body of Song)
""Hardly Getting Over It"" (Hsker D, Candy Apple Grey)
""Could You Be The One?"" (Hsker D, Warehouse: Songs and Stories)
""I Apologize"" (Hsker D, New Day Rising)
""Chartered Trips"" (Hsker D, Zen Arcade)
""The Receipt"" (Bob Mould, Modulate)
""Best Thing"" (Bob Mould, Body of Song)
""Celebrated Summer"" (Hsker D, New Day Rising)
""Beating Heart The Prize"" (Bob Mould, Body of Song)
""Egoverride"" (Bob Mould, Bob Mould)
""If I Can't Change Your Mind"" (Sugar, Copper Blue)
""Helpless"" (Sugar, Copper Blue)
""Makes No Sense At All"" (Hsker D, Flip Your Wig)
""Man On The Moon"" (Sugar, Copper Blue)

The band: They are so good, I officially never want to see Bob Mould play acoustic/solo shows again. This is the way his material should be presented- loud and full of energy. I know Mould has aspirations beyond the genre, namely through Blowoff, LoudBomb and his Modulate record. But I can't comment on it becuase I'm not a fan of the genre and don't know squat about it. I don't care for it. That stuff is like a mistress I know only through word-of-mouth but I hope won't take him away from the indie rock Bob I love other than a few nights a month. I'll turn a blind eye. He can have his cake and eat it too as far as I'm concerned. But I digress. Um...Brendan Canty on drums. Brendan Canty. Fugazi. Ok,...moving on... Jason Narducy (bass, backing vocals) has been kicking around the midwest showing up with Robert Pollard now and again. That's pretty much all I knew about him before seeing this show. His harmonies with Mould are a major reason the show is such a success. Usually singing the high end, Narducy sings with a comfort like he's been playing with Mould for twenty years. Rich Morel (keyboards, backing vocals), Bob's collaborator in the mistress genre, is great at the rock thing too. Much of the Sugar stuff had keys throughout and Morel does a great job with the material.

The Bob: It is nice to see Bob look excited to crank it up. I'm serious. This show has ruined me. I never want to see Mould solo/acoustic again. His voice took a few songs to warm up, but by Hoover Dam all is right and Mould is playing with the melody and pushing his voice further and further. Bob sounds revitalized. Renewed. Reinvigorated. Inspired. I'm not worried the show was recorded two years ago. His latest LP, District Line, is teeming with the same passion.",1206316800,17,4245,4.5234375
2910462,5,B000TV4Q1O,"cool! i saw this incredible show in Atlanta!  been a husker du fan since I saw them on New Day Rising tour! I am so glad Bob Mould is embracing his legendary legacy and playing some of his songs from husker du on this tour. I cant wait to throw this DVD in and sing ""I apologize"" loudly to my kids!!",1202428800,2,299,3.901639344262295
2910463,4,B000TV4Q1O,"Highly recommended for any Bob Mould fan.  Among the better concert DVD's I've seen in a while, very clean & crisp audio and video production.  Concernt footage provides topical overview of Sugar, Husker Du, and solo work with emphasis on most recent album release.  Extra's include interviews with Bob and bandmates.",1200182400,3,317,5.176470588235294
2910464,5,B000TV4Q1O,"Saw this tour live in Chicago and was eagerly anticipating the DVD.  Such a great blend of old and new music.  I've seen Bob and Sugar on many occasions and have to say this was my favorite show since Hsker D in 1987.  This DVD release absolutely does the live show justice.

The video editing and sound quality are top notch.  I was concerned that the sound quality might not hit the mark since the last, newly produced punk concert DVD purchase was ""Bad Religion - Live at the Paladium"", and even though it is an excellent DVD, their are issues with the audio balance that detract from the overall experience.  Not the case here - the audio on ""Circle of Friends"" is pristine.

The only reason I gave this 5 stars is because I couldn't give it 6.  ""Circle of Friends"" is a MUST HAVE for any Bob/Sugar/Hsker D fan.",1197936000,4,815,4.3509933774834435
2910465,5,B000TV4Q1O,"I've seen Bob Mould live around a dozen times.  I missed this tour as I had newborn twins in 2005, so I am glad to see this DVD release.  Anyone who's seen Bob Mould live knows that his performances are usually very serious.  Even during acoustic shows, when he would be prone to between-song discussions with the audience, once the song started, it was a furious onslaught.

This show has those types of moments, but he also SMILES!  LOTS!  You can see he's happy to be playing Husker Du songs w/ a band again.  This is definitely a must-own for all Bob Mould fans.",1193788800,3,566,4.384615384615385
