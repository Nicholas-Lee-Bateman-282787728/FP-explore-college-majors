8539652,4,B0010AYA50,"It was a great game in Albion history and the first time I saw it since the live broadcast. There were no commercials, but there was also no pre-game, half-time, or post-game. I also found it weird that they put the first and second half on separate discs, with no extras. Highlights from the other playoff games would have been great, but I'm not sure if they were broadcast. When the broadcaster said ""and now a word from the participation schools...,"" I thought they would show the classic ""come to our school"" videos we used to see all the time.",1438905600,,549,4.5
