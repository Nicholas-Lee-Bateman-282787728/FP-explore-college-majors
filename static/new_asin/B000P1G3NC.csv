8188142,4,B000P1G3NC,Waldo Kitty is wonderful for it combined live action with real animals and then combined it with cartoons. There was a little issue with the tape itself and the seller did more than make things right. I would definately recommend the seller to everyone and I hope they sell a lot of items.,1365033600,,289,4.471698113207547
8188143,5,B000P1G3NC,"In truth, the realistic shots at the beginning were better than the cartoon segments. This was one we wanted to like back then that fell short. Intro song was brilliant as well.",1356307200,,177,4.5625
8188144,5,B000P1G3NC,"What an unsung GEM of Saturday Morning cartoon folklore. A MUST SEE!  There is a reason why this show retains a small global cult following-it is insanely creative, intelligent and there is nothing mean or violent in it. Nothing cruel, no guns or torture like Bugs Bunny or Popeye (both of whom I love but it is far too adult and violent for my tiny child to watch. Waldo Kitty is a ""fraidy cat"" that dreams of being a hero. He has many adventures in real life action sequences which wrap around the cartoons. Such as getting shut in the garage when he gets in trouble for something the dog, Tyrone did. Then he'd imagine he could fight back and he was a starship captain ala Star Trek (Trekkies will love it!) or Catzan or Catman! Felicia, a pretty white Persian cat is his girlfriend and a great theme song too: ""He's Waldo Kitty, a meek and mild kind of cat, but I'm a daring hero, and I like being that.""",1288396800,5,908,4.309941520467836
