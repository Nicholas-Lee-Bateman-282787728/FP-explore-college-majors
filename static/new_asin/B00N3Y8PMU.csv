8676097,5,B00N3Y8PMU,Walker and Trivette go up against a drug dealer who uses a teenager as a courier to deliver drugs and collect the money.  The rangers try to help the boy but he refuses to tell the truth because he is afraid for both his mother's and his life.  Also Alex gets involved in a rape case when a student is mugged on the campus where Alex is teaching a law class.  She calls on Walker to help with the crime finding out that others have happened which could mean that there is a bigger crime involved. The rapist is found and Walker and Trivette stop the drug dealers from dealing any more drugs with the help from the teenage courier.,1464739200,2,630,4.233333333333333

8676099,5,B00N3Y8PMU,This is just what I was looking for The Full Episode on one disk and in 1 part not 2. I got tired of having to switch disks just so I could watch the whole Episode part 1 was on one disk and part 2 was on the next disk. There are several others that are in 2 parts just wish they would release those also so that they are 1 part.,1432080000,3,329,3.5833333333333335
8676100,2,B00N3Y8PMU,"Being huge Walker, Texas Ranger fans, my husband & I were so excited to find a movie featuring those in the show. We didn't purchase on Amazon, but we were highly disappointed. It's not a movie. They have taken an episode from the series and included a few things that we cut out to fit the time frame. We felt it was a waste of money. We can watch the episode with the season it is in.",1411084800,10,386,4.025974025974026
