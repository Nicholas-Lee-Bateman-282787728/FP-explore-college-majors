8296288,4,B0011TM1UQ,"I really enjoyed this DVD. The views were good, with a good variety of landscapes to enjoy. There might have been shots of Knoetsie Castle and Belvedere Church, but I shall not hold this against the producers of this very enjoyable disc. There are interesting legends attached to these two buildings. Maybe they are more than legend.

Altogether a very enjoyable disc to watch and reminisce over.",1267660800,,396,4.91044776119403
