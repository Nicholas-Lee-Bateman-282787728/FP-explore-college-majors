2220151,4,B0007MVXRK,"I was reluctant to purchase this for my husband. He has COPD, and I didn't know if he would like it or even participate.  Well, he laughted at SUNSHINE, but he was able to do the exercises sitting down and did not become overtaxed.  It's much too slow for anyone who is able to walk around the block but for those not able to move well, its perfect and entertaining except the last part when she does meditation.  Makes you wanna scream.  Just turn it off after the stretching.",1162771200,18,477,4.325842696629214
2220152,5,B0007MVXRK,It is alot of what my Mom learned at physical therapy but she can now do it at home . It has definitly made improved physical and mental health for her. It moves at a pace that fits seniors and a perfect combination of exercises . I don't want to return it because Mom enjoys it but it has 2 quick interruptions in the DVD from the 1st time we viewed it. Nothing we couldn't live with.,1156550400,26,385,4.012987012987013
2220153,4,B0007MVXRK,"When I first played this DVD, I found the fixed smile on ""Sunshine"" and the overly loud background music annoying. I also thought the five or ten minute filler at the end to be a bit much.

Those are the only minuses, though, in this otherwise wonderful exercise video for seniors.  I'd tried others and they tended to move too quickly for my arthritic 86 year old mother:  by the time she'd have mastered one movement, the presenter would have moved on to another and getting ready for a third.  This DVD is well-paced and more importantly, does a good job of gently exercising a lot of muscle groups, expecially legs and upper body.  I have recommended this title to others and will continue to do so.",1149379200,41,703,4.503937007874016
2220154,5,B0007MVXRK,"I bought this Easy Exercises-Isometrics, Pilates, & Stretching with Sunshine DVD and it's Great! It's the first Exercise Video that I've found that I can follow along with. If I try to keep up with the faster paced videos, I can only do half of an exercise or miss some of the exercises and you can injure yourself.

I'm not a senior, but I have back problems now and then and I can't bend myself like a pretzel. I've been using your video for 2 months now and I'm able to do every exercise.

 I like the positive comments and affirmations and always look forward to using this DVD which makes my workout a positive experience!",1144368000,65,627,4.387931034482759
2220155,5,B0007MVXRK,Nice program. My mom has alzheimers and so she gets confused real easy. This program is not so fast that it overwhelms her. She may not do each exercise correctly but she trys AND she enjoys it. I aslo use the program with her and it is a pretty good workout.,1125360000,85,259,4.098039215686274
2220156,5,B0007MVXRK,"This is a simple, easy, exercise DVD for seniors. The  DVD has simple easy sitting exercises that are easy to do, and the 2nd part has lower body exercises that are done standing while holding a chair.

After using this DVD for just a few weeks I have gained more strength, flexibility and joint mobility. Filmed on the Beach, Sunshine is always smiling, showing proper form and the exercises are easy for me to follow. The pace is slow & relaxed.

If you want a simple easy exercise DVD that will keep you fit --this is it! I can honestly say that this is the best exercise DVD for seniors & the elderly. It has a warm up, a cool down stretching segment and a relaxation segment with breathing exercises. After I finish this simple easy seniors exercise workout, I am energized and feel that my Health has improved a lot.

This is the Best Exercise DVD for anyone that wants to do simple easy weightless Pilate's and Isometric exercises. I highly recommend this Exercise DVD to all Seniors & Elderly.",1113350400,131,1001,4.513812154696133

2220158,4,B0007MVXRK,"I ordered this video for my senior clients, they loved the video.  Exercises are great and easily followed. They also spent alot of time discussing if ""Sunshine"" is a man or woman...",1396483200,,182,4.6875
2220159,4,B0007MVXRK,"had back surgery few months ago, so heavy weights and jumping around is not an option. good program for those just starting to exercise, or lack  balance or range of motion.",1392681600,,173,4.580645161290323
2220160,1,B0007MVXRK,"The exercises on this DVD lasted no longer than 10 minutes, the rest was film of fish and flowers, the exercises were for chair bound, just stretching the arms.
We have the 'More than Stretch' by Charlotte Michos DVD and thought this one would be of a similar standard.
I would say this was more for the senile not seniors.",1388188800,,323,4.4
2220161,5,B0007MVXRK,Bought this for Mom and she and my Sis love it. Both have physical conditions and this gives them an option that is do-able.,1384992000,3,124,4.208333333333333
2220162,2,B0007MVXRK,"This tape is useful and beneficial to many I'm sure, but I found it too difficult to watch. Why?  Because Ms Sunshine's, plastic, phony expression never changes! I don't mind the voice-over at all, but when it comes times to inhale and exhale, you'd expect some movement in the face and mouth!  It's as though she were wearing an unchangeable mask with a silly frozen smile that
tries to hide the fact that she is totally bored with the whole thing!  She is no doubt a sweet lady and highly qualified, but why
does she want to act like a robotic mannequin?
These exercises might be good for this 71 year-old bod, but, sorry, that facial expression is just too distracting for me!",1370995200,,679,4.504065040650406
2220163,1,B0007MVXRK,Bought this for my elderly mother who had finally worn out the VHS tape she had been using to guide her exercise. This DVD is obviously a copy of a VHS tape as the audio and video is terrible quality. The disc will not even load and play each time it is in a player. Not sure why that happens. Don't waste your money on this.,1365811200,2,325,3.9393939393939394
2220164,3,B0007MVXRK,I bought this for my mom who is an able bodied 78 year old.  She was looking to do more exercise but felt this was more for people who were in wheelchairs or in rehab.,1364169600,,167,3.7714285714285714
2220165,5,B0007MVXRK,I enjoyed this dvd very much. I have a bad back and the exercises were very gentle. Need more dvd's like this.,1362096000,5,110,4.045454545454546
2220166,2,B0007MVXRK,This video could use a lot more variety.  More variety in the music background and the setting for the different exercises.,1361750400,,123,4.857142857142857
2220167,4,B0007MVXRK,"This dvd is excellent if you are an out of shape senior.  I only gave it 4 stars because it doesn't really warn you that there are exercises at the end that you must do standing.  It is not a ""seated only"" dvd which I needed because of hip pain.  And also the squats are way too deep for seniors to do.  But, on the whole, I recommend it to anyone who is older or out of shape.",1360540800,6,377,3.7948717948717947
2220168,4,B0007MVXRK,The exercises are easy to do.  Sunshine gives one plenty of time to learn the moves.  Keeping up is not a problem.  It's a good way to get in shape for something more challenging.,1357948800,2,179,4.205882352941177
2220169,4,B0007MVXRK,"Easy exercises for Seniors.  It does not take too long to do the exercises.
Some of them I can't do, but I do what I can. Enjoyable and set in a nice
beach atmosphere instead of in a studio.  The only thing that I did not like was that Sunshine was
doing a voice over instead of directly speaking to her audience.",1350691200,3,313,4.032258064516129
2220170,5,B0007MVXRK,"This is a great DVD for people who have their movement restricted, but still want to exercise.  I found it easy to follow, and the nature scenery that they include as a meditiation is quite relaxing and nice.  The lady on this DVD, Sunshine, is great!  Her manner motivates me to do the exercises, and she clearly shows how the exercises should be done.

I would also recommend this DVD for people who are struggling to move due to their body weight, as it is a nice form of exercise to try, even if you have limited mobility due to weight.  It can be a starter DVD, and then when your weight starts to decrease, you can move on to other activities.  I still use this DVD, even while doing other activites, as it is so easy and nice to do.  This DVD is not boring and does not feel like you are doing a chore.  It is a great way to do some stretching which is a necessary component of any exercise routine.",1327795200,,906,4.166666666666667
2220171,5,B0007MVXRK,"Excellent! Very professional. Clear directions, easy to follow.  With her unchanging facial expression, the directions being spoken by an unseen person, and the careful camera work, one can truly follow each movement and concentrate on accurate form.  So far I have three of her DVDs, and they, along with Catherine MacRae's ""Gentle Fitness"" are the best I've found for my needs.",1322524800,,379,5.19672131147541
2220172,5,B0007MVXRK,I got a few exercise DVDs for my 75 year old elderly aunt. This is a very good easy exercises DVd she likes it a lot. The exercises are very well explained and easy to do. The teacher explains every exercise clearly and shows first how to do them. The exercises are shown from many different angeles always reminding to breathe. The timing is nice and slow enough for aunty and she follows along and does them easily. Great for Seniors and Elderly.,1305849600,,448,4.409638554216867
2220173,5,B0007MVXRK,I haven't done all the exercises yet but I think it is an excellent DVD and well worth the money I had to spend on it.,1305072000,5,118,3.576923076923077

2220175,5,B0007MVXRK,"I got a few exercise DVDs for my parents. Excellent exercises that improve the range of motion and not so hard they can't do it. This is certainly 0ne of the better ones in the market.

 The exercises are very simple yet effective.  The 2nd part of the lower body exercises are done standing and they can hold a chair for added balance. The routine is not very long about 30 minutes.  The teacher clearly shows and explains the exercises and does them at a nice slow pace and my parents follow along easily. She reminds them to breathe all the time.

Nice beach background and music . There is a nice soothing relaxation at the end of routine which has positive affirmations and is very good.

Recommended to anyone who wants an easy sitting exercises routine that works.",1289952000,4,771,4.510791366906475
2220176,5,B0007MVXRK,I got this DVD and the easy sitting exercises dvd for Grandma. She enjoys doing the exercises which are very easy and simple. This DVD is full of a variety of exercises for the whole body and is excellent for seniors. Very clearly explained and is done on a beautiful sunny beach. Recomended.,1289433600,5,292,4.528301886792453
2220177,5,B0007MVXRK,"Excellent Exercises for Strength and Balance. I am very glad to have got this DVD. The exercises are very well explained by the teacher and are slow enough for me to do. The DVD is about 35 minutes long which is great.
The sunny beach background is beautiful to exercise to. The teacher reminds to breathe all the time which I catch myself holding.
Excellent for seniors and elderly and those who want to do easy simple exercises.",1279756800,5,430,4.5256410256410255
2220178,5,B0007MVXRK,"I second the entire review by beanbug (""Low production values but good exercises""). I would have said it was cheesy, but my 91-yr-old grandmother with dementia and balance problems seems to like it. More importantly, it keeps her attention for the entire half hour because she can follow it and do the exercises. It moves at a good pace for her--not too fast, not too slow. My grandfather, who is in much better shape, has gotten engaged by it, too. They both even like the >5 min relaxation/breathing sequence at the end which has clips of nature scenes. I thought they might prefer an instructor who was more like them, but the young, fit, ALWAYS-smiling Sunshine worked just fine.

The video I received has two stretching exercises that are on the floor. Since that would be too difficult, I got my grandmother to do those sitting down and moving her upper body instead. That wasn't something she could have figured out on her own, and I wish this alternative would have been mentioned. On the other hand, giving alternatives would have added complexity to the instructions, which are deliberately (and thankfully) very short and simple. Also, there is no transition time given to go from the sitting to standing exercises either, so she always misses the first standing exercise (deep knee bends, which are too hard for her anyway).

The bottom line is that I wanted something to get my grandmother moving. I chose this video based on the other reviews here at Amazon and am quite pleased with my selection.",1263772800,7,1511,4.78544061302682
2220179,3,B0007MVXRK,Helpful information presented by an exercise model who has an unchanging plastic (frozen) smile on her face.,1254700800,3,108,5.411764705882353
2220180,5,B0007MVXRK,"Purchased for an elderly gentleman, he enjoys following along and doing the exercises. His balance is off, so being able to hold a chair in the lower body exercises and exercise is just right.

It's a great DVD for seniors. Very easy to do and she does them slow enough for everyone to keep up with. I would recommend this to anyone.",1227830400,3,333,4.370967741935484
2220181,1,B0007MVXRK,"The exercises were ""just ok"" but the main problem with the video was the fact that ""Sunshine"" looked just like a mannequin or possibly someone with a face super imposed over the actual face.  I found myself so caught up in watching for some type of facial expression while doing just routine exercise While working with Seniors and sometimes nursing home patients the video gave nothing other than routine.  The background scenery was great however.  I would not recommend this particular video.",1227571200,10,495,5.012195121951219
2220182,4,B0007MVXRK,The excercises were mostly very doable for me.  The core muscles are hard to maintain since I'm wheelchair bound any more.  It was a nice change from my range of movement program  Sunshine was very wooden faced and not inspiring to watch  beveltorc,1224892800,4,248,4.6976744186046515
2220183,4,B0007MVXRK,This was also a great DVD for the elderly. The people I work with can't stand but i use it at home and love it.,1201392000,7,111,3.48
2220184,3,B0007MVXRK,"The exercises were excellent for this ancient senior and gave me a good workout.  Miss Sunshine moves too fast from one exercise to another; by the time I was on the floor for the back exercises, they were finished.  I find her fixed smile off-putting, so avoid looking at her.  The mispronunciation of ""pectorals"" and the instruction to ""lay"" on my back both set my teeth on edge.  However, I am benefiting from the excercises and recommend them as an excellent way to begin reconditioning an out of shape body.",1187827200,27,512,4.655555555555556
2220185,5,B0007MVXRK,"I bought this for my grandmother, who is in stage 2 of Alzheimer's Disease. She is able to follow along with all of the segments and really enjoys the hostess.",1178409600,11,159,4.333333333333333

8049009,5,B0007MVXRK,I purchased this video for my father is in his 70's to date he has not did the exercises.  But we did watch the complete video together and I performed some of the exercises which is perfect for someone like my father.  But I have to say it's true Sunshine smiled the whole way through the video.  I think it would be a much better video if they let sunshine give the verbal directions.  It seemed a little sterile.  But besides that I think the exercises are perfect for seniors.,1457568000,3,480,4.288888888888889
8049010,5,B0007MVXRK,"Some time ago my dear friend lost his balls and will to enjoy life. It was gradual...at first..but then the symptoms really seemed to set in; loss of energy, excessive jerking off, periods of no contact shut away in the dark binge-watching Netflix series, constantly planning trips with the girlfriend on every non federal holiday, using ""folding laundry while watching cops"" as an excuse for I'm busy tonight, and sounding like a depressed version of Alan Rickman calling AAA in the rain because he blew a flat and realized he took the spare out last week to move a new end table into his house. Point is, this video worked magic. It inspired him and gave him the motivation to overcome his age, social status, and overall low self esteem that attributed to his lack of confidence and ability to stay hard. This simple step exercise video for seniors/balless friends is full of obvious and ancient old techniques you could honestly just think of. If it doesn't work I suggest taking the tape and slapping your friend across the face with it, I found that useful.",1451520000,3,1063,4.720430107526882
