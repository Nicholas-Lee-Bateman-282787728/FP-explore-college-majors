8106308,5,B000E60H1C,"In dominating fashion, Ohio State wins its third FIESTA BOWL in four years. And in doing so, had begun the road to next season's national championship game and a Heisman.
This is ABC's complete telecast of the 2006 FIESTA BOWL commercial free. No pregame nor halftime is offered while the postgame is a part of the BONUS FEATURES. Also, occasional edited huddles throughtout the game are a part of the production. This is not a Blu-ray so don't go into it expecting something HD only to come away disappointed. However, the picture quality is excellent.
Entertaining game. Nice quality. Certainly worth owning.",1488412800,,610,4.990196078431373

8106310,5,B000E60H1C,I enjoyed watching  2006 Ohio state and Notre Dame game. It was one of the greatest games to watch that year.,1421712000,,109,4.190476190476191

8106312,5,B000E60H1C,"This much anticipated battle between legendary college programs is captured in its full program for dvd. This makes a great addition to any Buckeye fans collection. Musberger and Danielson call the action of this clash of top 10 teams in the Tostitos Fiesta bowl, Ohio State's 3rd appearnace(and win)in 4 seasons. Watch Jim Tressel and CHarlie Weis match wits in an exciting game from start to finish. Troy Smith and Ted Ginn Jr light up the Irish defense on several long connections. Costly turnovers and 2 blocked field goals kept Notre Dame in the game as Brady Quinn tried to solve AJ Hawk and a fast Buckeye defense. Darius Walker of Notre Dame made the Irish's 3 touchdown tallies. The difference in the game was Ginn, Santonio Holmes, Troy Smith's arm and legs, a game ending tochdown romp by Antonio Pittman and a tough OSU defence. As a subplot to the matchup Brady Quinn's sister dates AJ Hawk in real life and is shown about 3,000 times during the game. By the way Hawk sacks Quinn 2 times- including a 4th and goal stop early in the game for the future top 5 NFL draft pick.",1144195200,8,1086,4.545918367346939
