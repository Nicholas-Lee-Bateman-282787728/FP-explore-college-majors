8423507,1,B004CRT896,It was way to scary for preschoolers. I did not like where the story line was going. I threw it in the trash.  Was very very disappointed!,1459123200,,138,4.111111111111111
8423508,4,B004CRT896,"Just a fun movie, with some educational tips for young kids. A little too scary, with Dr. Decay for children under 8. My neighbor had a party for 12 year olds and they showed This movie and the kids really enjoyed. The special effects are well done and I loved the dance scene at the end.",1339027200,,288,4.160714285714286
8423509,4,B004CRT896,"This video helps teach good dental hygiene habits while entertaining kids with a wacky, and funny (at times) story complete with a superhero, heroine, and villain. Better than a typical boring dental educational video. The villain Dr. Decay looks like he could actually be from a horror movie and is probably a bit scary for younger kids, but the 10 year olds I talked to really liked that character and enjoyed watching this. Could be better but pretty good video overall.",1338940800,,473,4.851851851851852

We will start with the fact that we where under the impression it was going to be a animated movie well it wasn't. The movie was just tacky very, very tacky. When  the lady started talking about brushing there's this creepy guy popping in and out brushing his hair with a tooth brush. The villain of the whole thing was just scary where showing this to 1st and 2nd graders. I won't even start on the music video at the end. This video was very bad and the Assistants in the office who dared show it to their kids didn't get the best feedback on it either .I Forgot to mention that it took us almost 3 weeks to get it when we asked for it within a week. In closing if you're looking for a movie to scare or just hear kids complain this is the movie for you.",1335312000,,878,4.045977011494253
