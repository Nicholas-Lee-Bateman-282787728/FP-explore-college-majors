4693481,5,B005GP7ENU,I bought this for my grandparents who are die hard Rover fans and they really enjoyed the interviews and performances. They liked hearing the interviews and got a kick out of seeing the different locations around Ireland.,1367452800,,221,5.0

4693483,5,B005GP7ENU,"Someone I knew from facebook purchased this at an Irish Rovers concert for me.  She wanted me to get it early.  As a consequence I have an autographed copy.  But to the reivew.  This is a great DVD.  It features the Irish Rovers themselves, singing their biggest hits, The Unicorn, and Wasn't that a Party in addition to several others.  Northern Ireland, specifically County Atrim where original member, George Millar, and his cousin, Ian are from as well as Belfast, home town for John Reynolds and Fred Graham, are prominently featured.",1353715200,3,539,4.868131868131868
4693484,5,B005GP7ENU,"I'm a sucker for Irish music... I have to say that at the start! Just the pure emotion of it... from rollicking fun to heart tugging ballads... makes it special.

I grew up listening to the Irish Rovers and was excited to see this coming available. In concert and on location, this is delightful from beginning to end.

A highlight for me was Foster & Allen guesting with their hit song ""Maggie."" What a powerful and moving experience!

It's all here... the rollicking tunes we've come to expect from the Rovers... and the tear-jerking ballads. Now if we could just get a few seasons of the CBC shows of old...",1321401600,10,610,4.527272727272727

Whether it be outdoors near the water, near a castle or in a pub setting, the Irish Rover never fail to bring wonder and laughter and pure joy to the listener.

4693493,5,B005GP7ENU,"I first saw the original The Irish Rovers live in person decades ago when they were appearing at the old Harrington's Bar in San Francisco...on St. Patrick's Day! They were great then and even though these aren't all the original members of the band they are still great! If you're a Rovers fan or just love spirited Irish music you will love this DVD. This DVD is a combination of live footage from a concert in Belfast and some outdoor & pub location shots of other songs. Some beautiful Irish scenery also accompanies several of the songs.

This program appeared recently on PBS as part of a pledge drive but that was a shortened version and of course regularly interrupted for necessary pledge drives. What you get here is an hour and thirty five minutes of continuous music followed by 14 minutes of interviews for a total of 149 minutes, not the 90 minute running time listed by Amazon. It's also in anamorphic wide screen (1.85:1 ratio), not the old 1.33:1 aspect ratio on the Amazon listing. This is a first class production, mastered in high definition and even though it's not a Blu-ray disc it will look great on your wide screen HDTV.

My only quibble with the DVD  is that there should be a Scene Selection (really a Song Selection) option on the main menu to make it easier to find and replay your favorite songs. There are only ""Play All"" and ""Interviews"" options although each song & interview section does have a chapter stop so combined with the song list (in very small print!) on the inside of the DVD case you can find your favorites without too much trouble. You definitely get your money's worth here though and I highly recommend this program and this DVD to anyone who enjoys Irish music!",1375920000,3,1713,4.591503267973856
4693494,5,B005GP7ENU,This is a great concert. The Irish Rovers sing very lively songs with the politics of ireland kept out of their songs for the most part.  I loved the scenes where they are singing in the countryside and by the castles.  Having the Irish dancers with the cute little girl ehanced the concert.,1367712000,,291,4.471698113207547
