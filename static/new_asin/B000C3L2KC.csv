#1, They didn't use the best looking prints, nor did they bother to remaster what they got their hands on.

#2, These films are most likely PUBLIC DOMAIN and therefore Mill Creek didn't pay squat for them. And they have the audacity to slap their company logo ON THE MOVIES WHILE YOU'RE WATCHING THEM.
This is a tactic that bootleggers do when they find some rare gem because other bootleggers will copy them.
But when you're a legitimate company with a factory released item, you DO NOT HAVE TO PUT YOUR LOGO ON THE SCREEN DURING THE MOVIE!

Screw you, Mill Creek! Thankfully, there is another release of ""100 Cries of Terror"" and ""Orlak"" with no company logos popping up.

NEVER BUY SHRILL CREEK RELEASES! Treat them like they have the Black Plague!",1492992000,2,856,4.545454545454546

Even though most of the Mexican horror films available on dvd are in spanish only and I do not speak Spanish, I really enjoy them.  They are highly atmospheric creature featurs.  If you love classic monster movies do not let the lack of english prevent you from discovering Mexican horror films.

This collection, I think, is the only way you can get La Herencia de la Llorona(the heritage of the crying woman) made in 1947.  Good stuff.  Orlak en el Paris de Frankenstein is pretty cool too.",1300147200,8,639,4.504347826086956
