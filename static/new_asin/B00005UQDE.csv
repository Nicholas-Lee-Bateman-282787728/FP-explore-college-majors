7955409,5,B00005UQDE,This video was fabulous the entire way through.  The tough part for me will be what selections to show when I teach my preschoolers about the seasons and the weather.,1390435200,,166,4.533333333333333
7955410,5,B00005UQDE,"Very educational. Introduces all the seasons the best way possible. It covers all the holidays involved in each season, as well as activites. Very well thought out and organized. Would recommend it to everyone who have toddlers.",1364774400,,228,5.1891891891891895
7955411,1,B00005UQDE,"This video was ok but if you don't celebrate holidays (and a lot of people don't) then you won't want it.  They show the 4th of July, Easter, Thanksgiving, Hanukkah and they go on and on and on with scenes of Christmas.  Read my other reviews.",1116374400,,243,4.260869565217392
7955412,4,B00005UQDE,"This video is pretty well done, but I have some reservations about recommending it. It could use more information, the music is not very original, and, for non-Christians, there's a lot about Easter and Christmas. However, my 2 year old loves it and has watched it several times.",1036886400,,279,4.833333333333333
