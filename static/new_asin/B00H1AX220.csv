If your looking to do barre at home, this is a great video and for the short duration, it's a wonderful workout that rivals some other 40 minute videos they offer.",1516060800,,266,3.9444444444444446

8629088,5,B00H1AX220,"Im on a barre kick these days and I was very happy to be introduced to the Barre 3 workouts.  Ballet Boot Camp is a 30 minute barre routine, with a 10 minute bonus ballet core.

The workout is divided into 4 10 minute sections so you can pick sections according to your schedule.  Candace Ofcacek teaches this workout.  Her teaching style is very similar to that of Sadie Lincoln, the Barre 3 Founder.  There are two modifiers working out with Candace, one is doing an easier version and the other is doing an advanced version.

What youll need for this workout:  chair, small playground ball, light dumbbells and an exercise mat.

The breakdown:

Warm-up and Arms  8 minutes
You work both your arms and your legs during this section.  The triceps and shoulders are mostly worked, with a little bit of bicep work.

Legs  10 minutes
You use do lunges, or carousel horse, as Candace calls it.  You also use the chair and the ball for those dreaded mini-squeezes.

Glutes and Core  9:40 minutes
Now the focus is on the glutes. The core work has twists, but they aren't horribly hard, since you are using the ball behind your back for support.  I still really felt it in my obliques and could maintain good form, which I find hard to do while doing twists without the ball support.

Bonus Ballet Core10:50 minutes.
I felt so graceful doing this core work.  You are doing plies while lying on your back

Why I love this workout:

* Candace is a wonderful instructor.  I love her form pointers.  I find it is very easy to get out of alignment doing barre workouts, so its great to be reminded about form.  Its as though Candace was right in the room with you.  I especially love the reminders to stand tall and to pull in your core.

* The slow pace really works you!

* It works!  During the workout, my muscles aren't necessarily burning, but I sure feel them the next day.

* The background exercisers.  One of them, Marguerite, participated in the 25 day challenge doing this workout and she got some great results.  It is nice to see a normal size person in a barre workout, instead of the little ballerina types that are usually in these workouts.

If you are looking for a barre workout that will challenge you without killing you, this workout may just be for you!",1400976000,28,2266,4.4645476772616135
