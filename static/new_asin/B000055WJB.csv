1393545,5,B000055WJB,I tihnk this is the best yet! I don't really like the dub because it cuts most of the important stuff. And it also uses too much slang but qtherwise it's the best. If your a Sailor Moon fan then you should own this tape and all the others.!!!!!!!,987897600,,246,4.040816326530612
1393546,5,B000055WJB,"The second VHS in the S series, The Love War has three exciting episodes.  First up is Pure na kokoro wo mamore! Teki mikata mitsu tomoe lansen.  Everyone is worried when Unazaki's pure heart is taken by Ou-Souji.  Rei uses an anti-evil chant to calm her down after she tries to kiss Makoto.  The second episode Koi no otasuke ha Moon ni omakase is about Umino and Naru's love problems, which turn out alright at the end in a love contest.  The final episode on this tape Reikokuna Uranus? Makoto no pinch is about Kaorinite taking Makoto's pure heart and not giving it back.  Makoto transforms into Jupiter and says Uranus is no different than the enemies.  This tape is also available edited dubbed and uncut dubbed.",987465600,2,718,4.606299212598425
1393547,4,B000055WJB,"Sailor Moon S is great. I dunno about this DBZ junk, or Card capter junk so Sailor Moon, Card captors (just the animation), is anime. this shows more episodes of the exciting series with more Death busters(heart snaching). TRhese episodes are 5,6,7 in the Sailor Moon S Series. Umm....., when is volume 3?",984096000,,305,4.773584905660377
1393548,5,B000055WJB,"Ah... Sailormoon S. Uncut, untouched, in Japanese... This is what I live for! Three full episodes of pure, unadulterated Moonie pleasure. I'm so glad that Pioneer is releasing a subbed version of my favorite show, unlike a certain company with the rights to the fisrt two seasons. **cough**ADV**cough** Cloverway & Optimum did a horrible thing to Sailormoon S (and SuperS) when they dubbed them. I was glad to see that the original music was there, and I adored Rini's new voice but, otherwise, the dub really stank.  Ja ne, K_CC",982800000,3,529,4.877777777777778
1393549,1,B000055WJB,"It's just as good as Pokemon: The animation is terrible, the ""stories"" are bad and the voice acting makes my ears bleed while making me nauseous at the same time.

1393550,5,B000055WJB,"S is the third and best season, right next to Sailor Stars, but we're not there yet. If you didn't think the first two seasons of SM were good(i.e. SM, SMR)then you're going to think this is good. The outer soldiers come forward, and it's Ruka, Michiru, Hotaru, and Setsuna! Sailor Moon has a wonderful combination of comedy, action, and romance and it just gets better in S.",979948800,,375,4.529411764705882
1393551,5,B000055WJB,"Sailor Moon is a great series, and I'd reccomend it to anyone.  But, if I was going to buy it, I'd personally get the sub, because the dub's story is changed a bit (ex: Uranus and Neptune were turned into cousins int the dub).  But, if you aren't very good at reading, then you'll still enjoy the dubbed version.  There's not enough of a change for it to impact the entire plot, so either way, I recomend this show to anyone!",978048000,4,425,4.222222222222222
7930959,1,B000055WJB,Movie does not play right. Makes weird static noises through out the hole movie..,1424304000,,81,4.857142857142857
7930960,5,B000055WJB,"Me and my brother rented this tape from Bradley Video because we wanted to watch a show from our childhood that we haven't seen in years. We got this mostly for Uranus' and Neptune's appearances and thought this tape will remind us of our childhood like the DiC episodes. However, when we popped in the tape, we were like ""what happened?!"" The opening had japanese titles, the music was strange, Serena sounded like a nagging grandma, there was distrubing content and it just didn't remind us of the old Sailor Moon we knew at all! I was confused with the DiC and Cloverway dubs mostly because of the music, the voice acting not so much. My brother couldn't stand the transformations. Whenever the girls were like ""Moon Cosmic Power! Venus Star Power!"" an obnoxious ""SAILOR MOOOON! DuDuDuDuDuDuDuDOO-DOO-DOO (orchestra repeating it), and dududududu...saila venaaasss! (stars explode) saila venaassss! (final pose). We were quite not satisfied with the original transformation and attack music (refering to ""Moon Spiral Heart Attack""). We found the ending theme, ""Tuxedo Mirage"" a nice touch and was the first japanese song I learned since ""romaji"" is included in subtitled versions of the VHS (even the uncut dub, NOT the TV dub).

Anyways, eight years later, this anime has stood by me as my favorite ever since, along with Ai Yori Aoshi, and the KEY/VisualArts animes like ""Kanon, Air and Clannad (highly reccommended!)."" Now, I enjoy both DiC, Cloverway dubs and uncut versions of the anime, especially the unaired ""Stars"" season. These VHS's are a few cents online, so if you love anime, I reccommend the ""edited"" videos of this timeless classic anime for your children or younger siblings, boys or girls. Dramatic, comedic and funny action. Sailor Moon, please be relicensed by Funimation and come back to us!

This video contains 3 uncut episodes:

1) Protect the Pure Heart! The Three way battle

Uranus and Neptune's coldness is revealed in this episode, not wanting to be part of the Sailor team whatsoever. There's also a small ""yuri"" scene in this episode that I was quite shocked at the TV edit that didn't cut the scene out.

2) Leave it to the Moon for the love aid

A fun episode involving the annoying characters, Molly and Melvin entering a contest. There's a group transformation in this episode and the daimohn is funny ""Die HEART!!!"" By the way, more yuri, with Amara (Haruka) and Michelle (Michiru meaning ""triumph"" in jap) being ""lovers.""

3) Cold-Hearted Uranus? Makoto in trouble

This episode is more suspenseful than the comedic appeals of the last two, involving Lita's (Makoto's) danger and wondering how she'll survive when she's stranded with her pure heart stolen. Even more, intense ""yuri"" moments where Lita looks like she's falling for Amara, Raye keeping a magazine with a cross-dressing woman on the cover as a ""special interest"" (by the way, the Cloverway dub nailed that entire scene perfectly to make it seem like a ""love quiz magazine"" instead, great job Cloverway) and a disturbing scene where the daimohn ""flashes"" her left breast at Lita to extract her pure heart. The TV edit only ""barely"" cut that scene out, but it's still known in BOTH versions that the daimohn used her breast, judging by the scenes used.",1288051200,2,3253,4.955963302752294
7930961,3,B000055WJB,"omg finally the featured item is a item i own!!

Anyway, this tape focues on uranus,neptune, lita, and melvin and molly's relationship.

it isn't one of my personal favorites...

But honestly, this tape is lighthearted and funny, sailor moon fans will surely enjoy it.",1172275200,,268,5.045454545454546
7930962,4,B000055WJB,"This is the edited version of season 3's 2nd volume.

Episode 87: Swept off her Feet - Andrew's sister dreams of her first kiss, making her a target for the heart snatchers. When the scouts rush after the monster to retrieve the pure heart, Uranus & Neptune snatch it first.

Episode 88: Blinded by Love's Light - Molly and Melvin are nervous about their relationship and enter a contest for couples to prove their love. Amara and Michelle enter as a joke while looking out for heart snatchers. When a new monster does strike and snatches Melvin's pure heart, the scouts leap into action.

Episode 89: Lita Borrows Trouble - After an accident, Lita begins admiring Amara and goes off with her and Michelle for an afternoon of fun. The other scouts worry about her and rightly so.

7930963,4,B000055WJB,"This video is very good on it you get 3 episodes of sailor moon. There aren't any parts cut out so you get to see all of the story and the ending songs which are in japanese with both english and japanese sub-titals, it's very good if your daughter wants to learn the song. The episodes are:
Protect the Pure Heart! A Three-Way Battle
Leave it to the Moon for Love Aid
Cold-Hearted Uranus? Makoto in Trouble
Each one of these episode are very good. The tape is 70 minutes long. I reallu love the cover of the video as well it looks great when you put it on display.",1018569600,,565,4.1454545454545455
7930964,4,B000055WJB,"I got this video for my birthday and when I saw it I was so excited I was screaming!  For you people that only watch the dub, try this out.  I guarentee you won't be dissapointed.  And with the original version, you don't have to deal with Cloverway's excessive use of slang, Serena's yodeling (Usagi's voice is sooooooo cute!), Amy's REALLY bad voice, and all the silly add ons and edits that are in the dub.  Please buy the japanese tapes so we can get all the series put in unedited, Japanese format! Arigatou! (Thanks! in Japanese.)",993859200,,536,4.494845360824742
7930965,3,B000055WJB,"This series introduces us to the outer scouts. my least favorites are Huraka and Michiru. I like their japanese names just dislike their japanese relationship. my favorite of the outer scouts/senshi are Sailor Saturn and Sailor Pluto. Of course you'll have to either watch it on TV,rent it or buy the videos according to your tastes. My favorite part is when Jupiter brawls with Uranus. Go Jupiter!",991353600,3,398,4.955223880597015
