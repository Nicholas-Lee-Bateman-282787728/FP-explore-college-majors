8211237,3,B000TXG3VS,"I ordered this because the Kaiser Chiefs are my favorite band of all time period!!! They are the greatest live band in the world and their music just brings me such joy. This item was a big disappointment as none of the songs on here are actually played by the KC themselves. Instead, we are listening to a band called ""The Chiefs"" doing their music which made my husband and I giggle a lot...THE CHIEFS!! LOL....The majority of this video are people talking about the Kaiser Chiefs and the few interviews shown of the actual Kaiser Chiefs are interviews fromt the past that the narrator lifted from somewhere else. None of the biographical information is new and is anything you can find on their website or on the Internet anywhere. That being said, I find MANY members of the band attractive so the purchase was worth it for the ""eye candy"" alone. However, if you are looking for something informative, pass on this. If you are looking for Kaiser Chiefs music, pass on this. The Chiefs do a poor job of emulating the REAL Chiefs music!! The narrator is so annoying talking about them without actually talking TO THEM. I could have done this video too because he and I know the same information about them!",1334188800,,1208,4.597222222222222
