4856510,1,B005P7XDVG,"This has got to be the worst movie I've ever seen. It is so bad, I had to stop in the middle of the movie to write this review. Worse acting and writing, I've ever seen. It is so bad even the dog barking in the background sounded fake. Why, why would someone film a movie this bad!!! I've had to fast forward through most of the movie just to get to the end hoping for some sort of redemption. Do yourself a favor, just walk away!!!!",1351900800,,433,3.9885057471264367
4856511,4,B005P7XDVG,"Great spirit.  Wonderful, wonderful singing.  Not perfect (what is?).  But for heaven's sake, give it a chance.  Better, I think, than the poor reviews  would have you think.",1346803200,,174,5.071428571428571
4856512,1,B005P7XDVG,"I paid $3 for this stink bomb at the Family Dollar Store. Amazon's price of $25.48 is outrageous. The acting is beyond bad. The musical selections are terrible. Every few minutes one group or another breaks into a grinnin' and shuckin', bug-eyed Amos and Andy song and dance routine. If a movie had intended to poke fun of black people it couldn't have done a better job. I was embarrassed for black people just by watching this over-dramatized, insulting mess.

Surely, somewhere down the line, this mockery of the black church had to be KKK-inspired. Why black people agreed to produce, promote and act in this monstrosity is a mystery to me.",1346371200,,644,4.75
4856513,1,B005P7XDVG,"This movie was AWFUL.  Terrible acting, very poor sound/film quality, VERY cheaply made.  I was dying to see this, but what a big disappointment it was.  I cannot express enough how awful this movie was.  Don't waste your time.",1335830400,6,227,4.743589743589744
4856514,1,B005P7XDVG,"CHURCH: the movie

Squalling, HOLLERING and SCREAMING to the top of their voices, IN TALKING AND SINGING. LOUD, LYING, people dress crazy making a fool out of Black people. They could not decide whether they wanted to make a Church movie with gospel singing or a club with jazz singing or a musical sing-a-long.

ACTING AWFUL- jumping from one scene to another with no connection.

Women dressed, looking horrible, wild and they need to stop making our Black people looking and acting like fools....by our own Black people.  We need to stop following the negative and dicriminatory pattern that Whites set for us years ago.

We need to take back our dignity in everything and especialy in movies and plays.

A 2 hr. movie, only the last 15 minutes when the man came in with the million dollar check did they sing right, act right, and church swas good church.

I had to fast forward a lot in this movie.  It just got on my nerve...but wanted to see it thru to see just how such a mess of a movie was going to end.

The ending script could have been a good movie had it been written property and intelligently by a professional with writing and script skills.

I certainly could have written this 100% better than it was.  I'll get my day for sure.  Movies like these are great teaching lessons of WHAT NOT  TO DO.",1330905600,,1313,4.466386554621849
4856515,2,B005P7XDVG,"My mother got this movie from BestBuy, I looked at her like she was crazy because I never heard of it but she got it anyway. This movie sucked. The acting was horrible. The only reason I'm giving this movie 2stars is for the songs and the singing. That was the only good thing about this movie. Buy at your own risk...",1328745600,6,318,4.145161290322581

4856517,3,B005P7XDVG,"The movie was entertaining, yet predictable. Some of the musical selections didn't resonate with me. On top of that, the character vocal movement and song lyrics didn't match which made the movie difficult to watch.",1479254400,,215,5.171428571428572

4856564,3,B005P7XDVG,"I like the plot; the actors put their heart and soul into the roles.  The screenwriter/producer kept you wondering what the ulterior motive was for the ""villain""...in the end ""All things work together for the good..."" It was refreshing to see and hear the late Darryl Coley, God rest his soul, in this production.  Many of the songs were ""outstanding"";  yet at times the songs went on and on and on...prompting a fast forward to the next scene (in other words...I understood the message in the song...let's move on).  The overall mixing of the soundtracks into the film was rough...as the soloist/singers songs were played...it was almost like a commercial break...instantly the volume is louder and your scrambling for the remote to adjust the volume..

Many movies have exceptional sound and clear pictures, but the plot in many other movies consists of activity against morale.
