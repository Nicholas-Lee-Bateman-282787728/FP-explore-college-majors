777109,2,6304074646,"Until ""Alien Abduction"" there was a considerable unbridged distance between your basic high-end ""soft core"" movie and your basic poorly written/generally unwatchable feature (insert ""Zoolander"" here). ""Alien Abduction"" successfully links the two categories. Whether that is a good thing is up to the viewer.

How I ended up watching this thing is more interesting than anything in the movie. Since the movie failed to attract much of an audience when released, its title was changed. The original title of ""Alien Abduction: Intimate Secrets"" was prefixed with ""Forbidden Zone"" which causes it to be confused with Susan Tyrell's cult classic ""Forbidden Zone"". Even the IMDb is confused and when you click the Amazon VHS link for ""Forbidden Zone"" you end up with ""Alien Abduction"". So trusting souls like myself end up owning a copy of something unlikely to ever be considered a cult classic.

Not that it is a total loss, the missing link thing is kind of interesting and it is also interesting that this was pretty much an acting career killer for the five very attractive women featured in this film. Not that they exhibited much acting talent. Former Playboy centerfold Pia Reyes is probably the best to the lot. Meredyth Holmes gets the most screen time and has one of those strange faces that looks gorgeous when framed by a hat and rather ordinary otherwise (maybe her horrible haircut and dye job). Darcy Demoss has a lot more mileage on her than the other four and you wonder what she is doing in this thing. This was the last movie appearance for several of them and the remaining ones were out of the business a couple years later.

The story is totally uninteresting which is unfortunate because the women are attractive and non-plastic. They spend most of their time in a sauna (shot in Romania) engaged in girl banter with towels wrapped around them. They describe passionate fantasies to each other that somehow fail to be passionate when cut in as flashbacks. It would have been nice if something sexy or erotic took place in these sequences but it doesn't. There is some amusement value in the fact that these sequences are staged on sets that were obviously created for other movies (the budget must have all gone for salaries). There is an alien subplot but no one should care much about it because even the characters treat it listlessly.

At least Pia Reyes' fans will enjoy watching her.",1116288000,5,2407,4.849148418491485
777110,1,6304074646,"This cheap film shamelessly rips off the title ""Forbidden Zone"" in order to confuse it with Richard Elfman's cult masterpiece of the same title.",1091404800,9,144,5.041666666666667
777111,2,6304074646,"This shot in Romania cheapie from Charles Band's Full Moon company (this was made before his Surrender Cinema producing arm began pumping them out fast and furious) is about three women who discover their most memorable erotic dreams actually occured on the night the trio's car broke down (or did it???) on a trip they were taking. Three dreamlike ""erotic stories"" follow. None of them make any real sense until the end, and even then it really isn't worth the effort of sitting through the movie to find out. Seeing the sets for Oblivion (a ""major"" Full Moon Production) recycled yet again (they were also used for another soft core epic called Petticoat Planet) produces a chuckle and a nod of admiration for Band's Cormanlike desire to save as much money as possible.  Not enough bang for the buck.",982108800,4,802,4.76978417266187
777112,1,6304074646,GAG!  This movie wanted to be something.  I don't know what but something.  It turned out to be a very very mild soft core...not limp core porn movie about an alien diddling bad actresses...stay away!,956275200,4,200,4.6571428571428575
7861064,1,6304074646,"Pretty girls (that could be the whole review).  Lighting good.  Sound good.  Overall production good.  Actresses pretty!  What more could you ask, you say?  Well, a story and a script would help.  Sets and locations a plus.  You will see dull plastic sheeting used to block out backgrounds and even in scenes shot in a car the windows behind the actors were blocked out with the same plastic sheets.  My film got tossed immediately!",1520380800,,432,4.72972972972973

7861071,4,6304074646,"First of all you have to take this movie for what it is, soft core, low budget tom-foolery.  Several girls get together at some non discript and rather creepy spa for a week end together.  they immediately get naked as they all tell tales of an encounter with this really ""sexy"" fantasy guy.  As the story unfolds Mr. Perfect turns out to be the same guy each time, because he is an alien who has abducted them and then played out their fantasies in their mind as he probed them or something on his ship, (that part is not made clear) Any way it turns out that he really only cares for the one girl that doesn't actually sleep with him in any of the fantasies but does at the beginning of the movie (she is the first to arrive) and he leaves here pregnant.  If you are looking for stellar Grammy award performances don't waste your time or money but if you are into the obscure and outrageous, this movie is right up your alley.  And for those out there, you know who you are, who are just looking for a large amount of T & A this movie is for you.  I think every person in this movie is nude at some time or the other and for the stupidest reasons.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forbidden-Zone/dp/B00013T8B8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forbidden Zone</a>",1306627200,14,1293,4.674008810572687
7861072,3,6304074646,"A guilty pleasure, I confess my relatively high rating for this sexy flick (calling it soft-core maybe a bit too much, since there is not that much nudity in it) cannot be explained or defended in a rational way. Five beautiful babes in a sauna, as they describe their somewhat similar fantasies, slowly realize they have been abducted by a not too handsome alien in the past. Shot in Romania, the cast includes centerfold Pia Reyes but the one who gets more screen time is the unknown blonde Meredyth Holmes, who is really very beautiful. The unknown redhead (probably a Romanian) is really beautiful, too.",1180396800,4,607,4.79047619047619
7861073,1,6304074646,"As I watched this (actually half watched, half fast forwarded), I couldn't help but think it had to be written by a woman. Five attractive females, in various stages of undress, sitting in a (Romanian) sauna discussing sexual fantasies. Sounds like a winner but never got off the ground.

Women discussing there experiences being ravaged by aliens could have been extremely hot, but its all too ""chicky"". Too much time spent talking about their ""feelings"", and so-called ""erotic"" scenes that play too soft - a lot of cutting away on the good parts, nothing explicit, no pink, not even much ""boobage"" (disappointing, as the actresses are well-endowed and not the standard plastic b-movie chicks), not enough skin, not enough heat (save one half-a** solo scene, they never get it on in the sauna!), too much talking and nothing went anywhere. Imagine scenes with them being examined, nude, on stainless steel tables, or forced to breed, or being fondled and probed. Alas, we got none of that, just some cheesy Harlequine romance-type female blathering.

The movie could/should have been half as long. Any coincidence most of these actresses, despite looking good, never made another movie? Check it out only if you get it dirt cheap.",1143763200,2,1231,5.029411764705882
