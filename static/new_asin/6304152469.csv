793474,5,6304152469,"One of the best legal dramas, in my opinion, and still a powerful and haunting film after 40 years. Memorable performances from Kirk Douglas as the defense attorney, Christine Kaufman as the teenage rape victim, and Robert Blake and Frank Sutton among the defendants. It's unfortunate that the only extra is the original theatrical trailer.",1016841600,19,340,5.2
793475,5,6304152469,"In order to understand this movie, you have to have some familiarity with German stage-classics, notably Wedekind's ""Spring Awakening"". Although it is listed as an American movie, it resembles nothing in American cinema, and is basically a German production. The director credits us with enough intelligence to listen to both languages; the Americans speak English, the Germans speak German, and a bit of voice-over narration explains things when absolutely necessary.
Once you understand the style of this movie, you can easily see it as the greatest of all the teen-angst movies that flourished around then; it makes ""Rebel without a Cause"" look like a Sunday picnic. The theme song became a smash hit in 1961; I often marvelled at the complexity of its music, then I found out that it was written by a real composer - Dimitri Tiomkin. Tiomkin actually wrote a lot of sentimental c**p, but I forgive him if he could turn out something this beautiful.
As to the story, I don't want to spoil things for viewers, and they can find it out from other reviews if they must. I just want to comment on the subtlety and craftsmanship that have gone into it, similar to the 1963 The Haunting. The black-and-white photography works beautifully; colour would look out of place. The heroine's final fate is not shown directly, only mentioned in a snatch of dialogue; it's much more devastating that way.
I challenge anyone to nname a courtrooom drama as effective as this one.",1006992000,6,1465,4.887550200803213
793476,4,6304152469,"I have been in law practice for almost 20 years and am almost always disappointed, if not disgusted, with lawyer movies. They are typically almost cartoonish with their portrayals and overlook the crucial realities on how things are done. One of the very few exceptions is Anatomy of a Murder and this is another. Overall, I'm not a huge Kirk Douglas enthusiast, but he does a very fine job here in showing the subjective reactions that counsel often have toward doing a dirty job and in being totally professional about it. He is far better in that role here than he was in Paths of Glory, a far better known and better received film. I thoroughly recommend this as one of the great hidden treasures of legal cinema.",961372800,7,717,4.609375

I was only a young girl in 1961, not even old enough to watch such a controversial movie, but it left me blindsided by the viciousness of the servicemen & the town who seemed to have no pity for this young girl's virtue. All they wanted to do was put the 4 soldiers to death. Kirk Douglass performance was justifiably remarkable. Even though he knew they were wrong he had to prove they should not be put to death. He demolished the girl on the witness stand, the men were spared but tragedy follows, It was sad about the outcome...but those were the times we lived in (especially Berlin).

794063,4,6304152469,"Some of the lesser reviews here seems to be concentrating only on ""Inherit the Wind"" ignoring the other feature ""Town Without Pity""  That is a shame because ""Town Without Pity"" is the superior film with strong performances by everyone involved in this powerful film of a Military tribune where 4 soldiers are accused of Rape and are facing the Death Penalty.  It is up to their defense attorney (Kirk Douglas) to do everything he can to prevent the death penalty from being imposed on men he knows to be guilty of the crime..  A very powerful film and it is the main reason I give this disc 4 stars.
As for ""Inherit the Wind"" this made for T.V, adaptation is a bad production.  With a poorly written script that adds scenes, takes away more, minimizes important characters and is very poorly edited and directed.  However, Darren McGavin, Kirk Douglas and Jason Robards give excellent performances that rise above the poor script.",1460419200,,930,4.751552795031056

The acting is excellent with Douglas, Robards and Jean Simmons leading a fine cast.  It's interesting to see how, almost 100 years after the events portrayed, we still have some of the same conflicts between religion and science.

794398,4,6304152469,"My mother wouldn't let me see this movie in 1961 when it was in theaters because I was gang raped myself in 1960.  Finally, after all these years, I know why.  Well, actually, I know a lot of reasons why, but some of them would constitute spoilers.

For one thing, I know I would have been upset that this girl's rape was treated as a very serious matter, and in fact the four soldiers who raped her faced the death penalty.  She was 16; I was 13, and my rapists were charged with statutory rape: that is, the grand jury concluded that I had not fought.  In those days, stat rape was a ""boys will be boys"" minor offense.  None of them even got jail time, only probation.

But this really isn't about me, it's about a young German girl raped by four American soldiers.  (Or maybe three, with one somewhat questionable.)  She was the town's banker's daughter, and had been swimming in a brief 2-piece bathing suit (not really a bikini, as it was described in court) with her boyfriend.  They quarreled, and she swam across the river to where she had left her clothes while he pouted on the other shore.  Unfortunately, as she was changing her clothes, the half-drunk soldiers were spying on her, and came out of the bushes to rape her.

The basic facts were there from the start, although of course the soldiers claimed she wanted it.  There was a rule that the death penalty could not be imposed unless she held up throughout the trial, including all cross-examination, and so all the defense attorney even tried to do was to rattle her so badly that she withdrew from the trial.  He had offered to settle the case for sentences at hard labor before the trial began, but the prosecution was not willing to deal.  So nobody believed there was really a question of guilt, except perhaps of the degree of guilt.

It's a pretty good movie overall, although the rather insipid theme song is played way too much, including coming from the juke box at the Florida Bar even before the rape took place.  Some of the secondary actors are a bit over-played, but both Kirk Douglas and E.G. Marshall are their professional best, and very believable.",1388361600,7,2135,4.518229166666667
794399,4,6304152469,"When four young American soldiers are accused of raping a girl from a German village near their camp, Major Steve Garrett is assigned the distasteful task of defending them.

Garrett is faced with the dilemma of destroying the girl on the witness stand in order to save the lives of his clients. . .

Jason Robards Jr., his role as the Army Commanding General in ""Tora, Tora, Tora, kind of amused me, not because of all the mistakes that were made by the Flag Officers there and the Army and Navy brass, and politicians in Washington but, that Robards, was an enlisted Radioman, aboard the U.S.S.

794483,4,6304152469,"This is the third remake (specifically for TV in 1988) of this fictional drama which is based on what has come to be known as the Scopes Monkey Trial in which the defendant was the now legendary Clarence Darrow and the prosecutor was the now legendary William Jennings Bryan.  The trial took place in 1925 and the accused was a substitute teacher who violated a law in Tennessee against teaching evolution.  That is, the law was against teaching science that would undermine belief in the Judeo-Christian God of the Bible.  The characters in this drama are evidently imaginary creations and are not meant to literally recreate the actual people involved in the Scopes case or their actual lives.  The characters' names and the situations in this drama are creative fiction based on events that actually happened.  I don't know if any of the dialogue is taken from the actual Scopes trial.

This is the only version of ""Inherit the Wind"" that I've seen.  The most famous version starred Spencer Tracy as the defendant.  Most of the action takes place in the courtroom, demonstrating the contest between a fundamentalist who supports absolute faith in an absolutely literal interpretation of the Bible and a seeming aetheist [perhaps so--the viewer is kept wondering about his convictions] who says he is defending ""the right to think"" and that an ""idea"" is more important than a cathedral.  Throughout the drama, this defender of the right to teach ""science"" and the accused, a young, very innocent-looking and very likable-seeming young man named Burt, both appear to believe in the teaching of ""science as the Truth.""  Especially Burt is portrayed saying only things that sound like he has abandoned belief in or respect for God's Truth.  It SEEMS that he and his lawyer both believe that science alone is truth and that God and the Bible are at most an unreliable source of any kind of explicit truth.  (The defendant, at one point, does bring out the ""fact,"" [thus seeming to posit the truth of the Bible record], that when the Bible in Genesis first speaks of the existence of a ""day,"" it cannot have meant a literal ""24-hour"" day since the sun that distinguished ""time"" on the earth wasn't even created yet on that first ""day.""  My point is that this is one remark that gives the viewer the idea that this defendant may have some kind of respect for the Bible and may think that there is some kind of Truth in it.  Most of the time he makes remarks that seem to place him solely on the side of scientific truth/fact/science.)

There are several private scenes between the fundamentalist and his wife in which they are demonstrated to be sincere Christians, and not terribly reprehensible ones.  But the viewer is also given to understand that this man has political ambitions in which his Christianity figures.  He hopes to be elected as a President who will represent the ordinary people, the Christian fundamentalists of the nation.  In one scene he is shown having a confidential talk with the accused's girlfriend; and then later he cites remarks in the courtroom that this girl has told him in strict confidence about the accused.  So, this character is presented in such a way that viewers will have an ambivalent response to him, while they are constantly trying to take sides in this case, trying to decide whether or not to consider the fundamentalist accuser a villain or a good guy.

I found the drama difficult to watch.  I felt a strong, uncomfortable tension throughout, and I know that was what the movie makers intended.

The movie makers were obviously creating a chiefly ""good guys"" versus ""bad guys,"" ""good"" versus ""evil,"" and ""black"" versus ""white"" tension throughout the greatest part of the movie (but relief comes briefly, at the end), and, despite the occasional generous concession to the fundamentalist's sincerity and integrity of character, the movie presents a strongly prejudicial statement against the Fundamentalists, conveying a simplistic impression of them as Villains to be rejected by enlightened people (which the viewers would presume themselves to be and thus would reject these rabid, ranting, narrow-minded religionists--perhaps rightly so, to a certain extent). Nevertheless, it is from a sermon/speech by the Fundamentalist (who is actually under an implicit indictment by the movie maker and then by the viewer) that the movie takes it title.  He quotes a Scripture that prophesies, ""He who troubles his own house shall inherit the wind.""

Throughout the movie and the tension caused by the courtroom exchanges, I kept wondering anxiously why the defendant never clearly enunciated a balanced stance stating that Bible Truth and Scientific Truth (seeming factual proof) could rightly co-exist and both could be considered right and true.  An outright MESSAGE to the viewer in favor of this balanced, accommodative approach does finally occur when the trial is over, not having been deemed appropriate during the trial.  It is the singularly important ""afterthought"" expressed by the character who has been made to seem more attractive to viewers, the patient and easy-going and yet ardent defendant, as he smiles and happily accepts to weigh in the balance of justice two books: the Origin of the Species on the one hand and the Bible on the other hand.

The movie is a good example, I feel, of the way in which media can create (""manipulate"") public opinion.  Even the movie makers of this film are aware of this and demonstrate a caricature of the process in the movie.  During the scene of the Fundamentalist's speech/sermon, the audience is depicted as a group-herd eager to be led into extreme attitudes and acts that demonstrate a simple Evil versus Good response.  When the Fundamentalist rants against the ungodliness of the scientists who want to bring down God and the Bible, the audience appears to be aroused as one angry body.  The preacher asks the crowd if murder would be the rightful way to deal with the miscreants, and the crowd shows its eagerness to Kill these despicable, ungodly, demonic offenders against God's Truth!  One woman near the camera, if you look at the scene quickly enough before it passes, can be seen actually seeming to move her mouth as if maybe salivating within.  Then the Fundamentalist turns the audience's accusatory sentiment.  He answers the audience-group-herd ""NO!""  He instructs them they must act with Love, according to the Lord's instructions.  Their anger wilts in response, but grudgingly.  It seems that what they really wanted was Blood!,Punishment!,Vengeance of God!

It is to this powerful fundamentalist's credit that he tries to turn the people to loving actions based on obedience to God's will as discoverable in the Bible that is on trial, and there is also a scene in which the Defendant lawyer, who turns out to be a moderate in favor of a balance between Science and Blind Faith in the Bible, makes a forceful statement in favor of the good ""Giant"" that was once part of the Fundamentalist's character.

Despite the items that were in support of the Fundamentalist's character and the fact that the movie ultimately presented an implicit message recommending a balanced acceptance honoring both sides of the contention, I think that most viewers would come away from the movie feeling strong prejudicial reaction against and hostility toward the character of the Fundamentalist (and his wan wife who always looked terribly pale, unhappy, and deathly ill, seemingly because she was troubled by something [but what exactly?] regarding her husband).

I think that the movie makers deliberately create[d] this hostile, rejective attitude toward the Fundamentalist (and other Hollywood movies have tended to have the same agenda).  It seems to be part of a long campaign in movies and the media that presumes a superior intellectualism should look down upon Fundamentalist ""types"" (usually shown as Southerners and pentecostals) who are  depicted as being incapable of intelligent thought and faith-healing deceivers with ulterior motives of greed, and other unattractive traits.

Because of the uncomfortable tension created by the contentious theme throughout, I didn't enjoy watching the movie.  And I don't think I'll watch the more famous Spencer Tracy version for comparison.

As to the controversy itself, I appreciate the fact that many intelligent fundamentalist Christians are keenly interested in and able to support with convincing scientific evidence some very interesting arguments and evidences in favor of Creationism.  Many non-believer scientists have begun to support the evidence for creation by Design, although they may not specify the Judeo-Christian God as the designer.

I thought all the actors in this movie were very excellent in their roles, and the drama was powerful.  While it's a carefully-crafted, intense drama, I reacted (obviously, as stated above) against the manipulation back and forth of the prejudicial aspects of the issue on trial, feeling the effect would be ultimately to create prejudice against so-called fundamentalist Christians and probably, by association, against Christian believers in general as well.  But, again: The implicit message at the end was clearly conciliatory, was balanced, accepting, and non-prejudicial.

the guilty conscience of the defense attorney distinguishes this courtroom drama from the rest - a conscience at times personified by a angry female reporter - played by German actress Barbara Rtting - whose English is so good i thought she might be American

which leads to one of my favorite elements - the use of real German locales - real German actors - and bursts of German language - often without translation

released in 1961 - the viewer will have to keep in mind that this plot depicts 1950s moral sensibilities - but i think the characters' reactions are conveyed well enuf for today's generation to grasp

Disappointing but the story is heartbreaking.",1252540800,,593,4.4
794672,3,6304152469,"In TOWN WITHOUT PITY (1961), director Gottfried Reinhardt uses some innovative techniques. For one, when the four prisoners charged with rape of a 16-year-old are interviewed, we see only portions of these, with one segueing into the next via quick crossfades. Also, since this picture is set in a German town near an American military base, much of the early scenes are in German. Instead of subtitles, one of the movie's characters, a young woman reporter, translates the on-screen dialogue (""She said: 'You're just a mama's boy!' ""). Although preferable to bad dubbing or the actors delivering their lines in German-accented English, it does seem rather peculiar.

Dimitri Tiomkin, who's turned out so many memorable film scores, cheesed by on this one. The underlying music throughout is the title tune, introduced in the first reel via Gene Pitney's single playing on a tavern jukebox. There's even a ""Town Without Pity"" Twist. Feh!

The injured girl in this story has enemies in her community: a voyeur that lives next door, an old woman who may be jealous of a remarkable beauty, her boyfriend's mother and perhaps her own father.

Kirk Douglas as the soldiers' lawyer is a sort of sympathetic villain. He clearly doesn't like his clients, yet has a job to do-- a vigorous defense. Although he tries but fails to convince the young victim's father to not allow her to testify, Douglas ultimately destroys her credibility in court when she does take the stand. This event leads to a logically inevitable conclusion.

As to the defendants:
Frank Sutton (Sgt. Carter on TV's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/GOMER-PYLE-USMC/dp/B000VDDE1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">GOMER PYLE, USMC</a>) is properly repulsive as leader of the debauchers.
Robert Blake (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BARETTA/dp/B00006J6XH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BARETTA</a>) plays a remorseful man. He's branded an impotent nutcase by a defense shrink and reacts angrily to the charge.
Richard Jaeckel seems to use his shielding of Blake from Sutton's cruel barbs as an excuse to feed some inner violent tendencies.
Mal Sondock's character is a meat-headed cypher and of little consequence.

The story itself is pure tragedy. After a river swim the girl is assaulted, and then undergoes a second attack in court. The four soldiers have justice served to them. The defense lawyer wins a partial victory but maybe loses his soul in the process. There's simply no winners here.

Rating: 3 stars out of 5, only because calling such an exercise in several forms of inhumanity ""good"" just doesn't seem right somehow.",1242864000,3,2665,5.535626535626536

794675,5,6304152469,"Town Without Pity could have been the ultimate exploitation film, if it didn't go beyond the sensationalism of the trailers.  Instead it is an excellent character study of a conflicted military lawyer with an impossible job, a victim whose suffering doesn't stop, and a father whose position is endangered by the prejudices or envy of the townspeople. Their attitudes toward poor Karin are poorly explained; we have only Major Garrett's speculation on why they turn against this innocent girl.  They tell outrageous lies, repeat rumors, and do whatever they can to sully her reputation.  Their motives, however, are less important than how this film indicts a legal system that allows an accused rapist's counsel to blame the victim.

Kirk Douglas gives a stellar performance as the officer who does the dirty job he is assigned and later feels a remorse he isn't permitted to show.  Frank Sutton and the other actors playing the defendants paint a picture of pure evil.  The best performances are by Christine Kaufmann as the tragic Karin, Hans Nielsen as Karin's deceived father, and Gerhart Lippert as her justifiably outraged boyfriend.  Tieing it all together is Barbara Rutting as the German journalist who may be the only person to see through what is going on, but who is straitjacketed by the journalistic responsibility to remain neutral, if only in print.

Douglas always seemed to play one of two character types. As the villain, he was ruthless, ambitious, arrogant, and willing to do whatever and sacrifice whomever to achieve his goal. As the hero, he seemed to specialize in playing men who are decent, honorable, noble people who are trying to do the right thing despite overwheliming obstacles like bureaucracy, intolerance, and cruelty.

794677,5,6304152469,"This is an excellent film and a story well told.  The time is 1960, the place, West Germany, in a town in which a large US Army contingent is based.  The story deals with a tragic rape of a young German girl by four GIs.

Of course, the entire town is howling for the death penalty to be meted out to the four soldiers, three of whom are clearly guilty.  The American command is equally horrified and determines that the crime of the four soldiers is an outrage and will be tried and treated as one, with an open trial in the center of town.  Much of the town attends.

The film brilliantly develops the theme of the story--the town is riven by hatreds and divisions of wealth and class.  Its outrage over the crimes of the soldiers becomes overshadowed by the rivalries and resentments involving the young victim's family.  Soon the trial becomes a forum for ridiculing the girl and her family, and ruining what should have been a spotless reputation.

Kirk Douglas turns in a fine performance as the defense counsel, who is both sympathetic to the victim, and ruthless in his tactics aimed at sparing his four clients the death penalty.  The courtroom drama here is superb and for once, generally true to life.  This is a fascinating film, but unfortunately not a happy or uplifting one.

This film has a special attraction to me, as it was set in postwar Germany, where I served as an Army officer in the 1970s.  This film very accurately captures the attitudes and interactions of American soldiers and officers, and German citizens, during the postwar period.  The on-location filming adds tremendously to the authenticity of the piece.

794678,3,6304152469,"Sometimes a movie's trailer - love those trailers - can give us a different impression of a movie that what you'd imagine the filmmaker intended.  The trailer for TOWN WITHOUT PITY practically screams steamy sleaze. It's today, 1960, and the place is a US Army base in Germany. Four drunk US soldiers, in civilian dress, stumble out of a bar.  The soldiers are either troubled or tough, and include a young Robert Blake, the reliably perverse Richard Jaeckel, and square-jawed Frank Sutton, who's probably best remembered as the oft-angered Sgt. Carter on `Gomer Pyle, USMC.'  Here he's just tough and mean.  Still got the buzz cut going, though. Cut to a loving shot of pretty Christine Kaufmann in bikini.  Think there's a guy in the shot with her.  Cut to a below-the-knee shot of Christine, minus boyfriend, minusing herself of her bikini. Cut to a shot of a j'accusing Kirk Douglas, prowling the courtroom floor, asking a quailing Christine if she enjoys parading her body in front of men! On the basis of what the trailer shows, this one looks like a cross between Perry Mason, The Dirty Dozen, and Peyton Place.

 TOWN WITHOUT PITY is quite a bit less salacious than the trailer suggests.  Douglas waxes histrionic as the defense attorney with an impossible task - the pitiless town wants the maximum penalty meted out to the accused soldiers, and the only way that can happen is if the young Christine is called to testify.  Douglas, befitting his star status, is a slick lawyer who anticipates cross-examining the young girl with a great deal of dread.  In a bold stroke of typecasting E.G. Marshall plays the prosecuting attorney.  Marshall usually brought a stoic, stolid and understated determination to the characters he played.  That quality serves him well here, and allows him to maintain a rather dull dignity in the face of a legal barracuda like Douglas.

 One of the better courtroom dramas around, TOWN WITHOUT PITY offers an honest and at times harrowing portrayal of the effects a trial has on the victim of rape. Less compelling is the tabloid newspaper writer, a female muckraker and the movie's overhead narrator.  The movie introduces her, I guess, to give someone for Douglas to grumble at while he investigates the crime.  Her purpose in a movie like this - exploiting a terrible crime for a gossip-hungry public - is underdeveloped.  Perhaps most mystifying is the attitude of German citizens toward a foreign military presence in their midst.  We never learn whether the soldiers are loved, hated, resented, or what have you.  In fact, we never know whether the pity is being withheld from the men or from the girl.  If you like courtroom dramas this one will satisfy, but don't expect much from the rest of the story.",1134950400,9,2749,4.8436830835117775
794679,4,6304152469,"""Town Without Pity"", a U.S.-German collaboration is a tragic tale of the rape of a young teenaged girl by four U.S. soldiers stationed in post-war Germany.  The crime is quickly uncovered and the soldiers are put on trial for court martial.

Kirk Douglas, playing defense attorney Major Steve Garrett has been commissioned to defend the soldiers.  A crime of this magnitude could warrant the death penalty.  Prosecuting attorney E.G. Marshall, in a familiar role is pushing for exactly that outcome.  Poignantly, Douglas while compelled to defend his clients, feels remorse when confronted by the realization that he will have to humiliate the victim, played by 16 year old and future Mrs. Tony Curtis, Christine Kauffman during cross examination to save their lives.  He begs the girl's father a proud and stubborn man to spare his daughter from this fate but is rebuffed.

The film takes us through the unfortunate trial and the lack of compassion for the victim as show by the townsfolk.  This movie proves that there can be no happy ending in a story of this nature.

The movie is one of my all time favorite lawyer movies.  But the Amazon stream of this particular movie is so inferior that I can't watch it here.  Don't get me wrong--most Amazon streams are state-of-the-art.  This one is not.",1517875200,2,387,4.333333333333333
7862949,3,6304152469,"Well, I wouldn't say I ""loved"" it. The acting was great. Viewing the film should be a lesson on history to the younger generation concerning the way rape trials were conducted during that period of time when the female victim was treated as a sex object; whose mere corrupt presence could drive those chest thumping men into a sexual frenzy resulting in rape. The film was faulty in the view that a rapist could not be impotent in normal life and commit rape. Untrue, rape is a violent act and that is usually what turns a rapist on. If there is not enough arousal through violence rapists have been known to use foreign objects. It's not an act of lovemaking. In closing, I would just like to say: Thank heavens it is 2017 and in the United States things have evolved to the point where ""rape"" is considered rape and men are given more credit for their sensitivity and thinking ability instead of just chest pounding.",1511740800,,918,4.536144578313253

I am sure it was a budget movie at the time. But my wife (who had never seen it before) and myself thoroughly enjoyed watching it. My wife said she thought it was a very good movie. Of course Kirk Douglas ""makes"" the movie in quite a few ways. But the other main characters were all quite good. It is a troubling story of a young German girl who gets raped by drunken American soldiers. Most of the movie involves the trial and the effect it has on the small German town.",1505865600,,607,4.024793388429752
7862951,5,6304152469,"Great film that I have not seen in years. I watched it today with Amazon Prime. It is still as powerful as when I first saw it. This is a must see film. Kirk Douglas gives a very interesting, sensitive and powerful performance. His sensitivity is quite restrained as you will see if you view this film. Also interesting was Dimitri Tiomkin's score. It is a jazz score and it is not easily recognizable typical Tiomkin. This score only strengthens unique story of four servicemen being court-martialed for rape of a West Germany young woman. The film was released in 1961 and it was quite a controversial subject given the nature of how the courtroom drama unfolds. TOWN WITHOUT PITY is as powerful as ever.",1501459200,,706,4.656

The song, Town Without  Pity, Gene Pitney's first hit, won the very first Golden Globe award for best original song, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Song. This led to Pitney becoming the first pop singer to perform at the Oscars in 1962. Ironically, this song also capped Gene Pitney's career and life - it was the final song he performed at his final show at Cardiff's St. David's Hall in April of 2006, before his death from heart disease.",1486684800,2,556,4.56
