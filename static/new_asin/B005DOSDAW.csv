Taggart was an awesome movie & definitely a Western I'd tell any fans of Westerns to go & see. It had a great storyline & the action & drama never stopped. Dan Duryea was perfect as the sleazy slimy evil gunslinger hired to hunt down & kill Taggart. You'll probably be rooting for him to get his in the end just like I was",1432080000,2,463,4.458823529411765
8467301,4,B005DOSDAW,"Great western and sincerely liked the actors and actresses; however, as usual I disliked the portrayal of Native Americans and is my reason for a rating of 4 instead of 5.

Remember U.S. and Canadian players will not play this western.",1331769600,,235,4.7317073170731705
