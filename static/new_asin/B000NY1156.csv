8285311,5,B000NY1156,"My family and I watched this video together and loved it, and it was one of the few ""Families of the World"" videos we hadn't seen before. As with most of the other films in this great series, *Families of Australia* profiles two kids who live in different parts of the country: Phoebe, who lives on a farm, and Josh, who lives in Sydney. Our kids particularly enjoyed watching Phoebe help her family with their sheep herd, and learning about how her family saves water in that dry land. They also want to raise chickens now, as both Phoebe and Josh's families do. But they thought that bean-and-egg sandwiches might be something for Josh and his little sister's more exotic tastes!

I highly recommend this video about Australian daily life for kids, adult ESL learners, teachers, and librarians. Check out the trailers on YouTube. Search on ""Families of Australia (Families of the World) Rural Trailer"" and ""Urban Trailer."" The Teacher's Guide includes the script, glossary of terms, a guide to making your own climbing koala toy, and even lyrics to the Australian national anthem! A useful, fun, and engaging way to learn about this cool country.",1290470400,,1148,4.857142857142857
