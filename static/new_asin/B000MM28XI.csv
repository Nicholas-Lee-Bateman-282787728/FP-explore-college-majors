The one thing it does seem to be cut out for is drinking games, but just make sure one of things is not when ""Cruisin' Down the Road"" plays or you will will furniture-breaking drunk.

I purchased this film for a friend as they liked the VHS cover art, so I don't actually know if they still have a video player, it might be best if they don't see it and just use the VHS cassette to keep a door open or something.",1282867200,2,617,3.928
