8538173,1,B0099VWOZK,This DVD was edited so the movie became PG-13. I prefer the uncut version.,1447804800,,74,4.357142857142857
8538174,5,B0099VWOZK,"I heard about and bought Jism 2 because of being a fan of Sunny Leone, then I was surprised I liked watching the overall movie too. It was confusing that it began with and sometimes had some English sentences, so I went back to the Menu and turned on English subtitles. It wasn't as intense dramatic as other foreign films such as, ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" series, but while all the acting was good there were a few scenes that got overly dramatic as in a soap opera and the viewer may wonder if it's a flashback scene or a sentimental music video but it does balance out by the ending. It is not even softcore, as there is only about four brief scenes (often shown in trailer video clips and basically no more intimacy is shown than that) that are implied (usually in more of a romantic way) but there is no nudity at all. Personally I would have liked an unrated version, but I still liked the movie so that's saying it was interesting enough in other ways. Much of the vibe of the movie is very sensual because of Sunny Leone, but the theme is more of a visual romance novel and thriller, and overall they did it quite well. The plastic the DVD was on had too much glue holding the plastic but still fell off (that's ok as I put it in another case anyway) and as with some plastic holders it required being very careful getting the DVD out of the plastic without breaking the DVD (this is why I put it in a different case), but the DVD played and I liked watching Jism 2. There are a few seconds of instances during it of ads for ringtones maybe for India to be ignored. I am going to look up purchasing a song from a U.S. site if I can find it. I wanted to buy Jism 2 as an Amazon Instant Video, but it's not available yet. The acting of Sunny Leone and all the actors was overall very good. Sunny Leone as always is incredible, beautiful, amazing, and I would like to see more movies with Sunny Leone. There are very few movies that I intentionally watch more than once, such as ""Shall We Dance (Japanese version), ""Pulp Fiction,"" and I will watch Jism 2 again. I am glad I bought it. I personally enjoyed watching Jism 2.",1390867200,,2136,4.224938875305623
8538175,5,B0099VWOZK,So nice to see that India has loosened up from the sexually repressed culture that it is and is actually trying to think outside of the box with new material other than the sob love stories one was forced to endure over the 70's and 80's.  Sunny Leone is a fresh beautiful face and her pairing with Randeep gives the audience a chemistry like none other.  I actually saw the movie for free on YouTube but loved it so much that I purchased a copy for my DVD collection.  Hats off to Pooja Bhatt.,1364428800,2,494,4.23404255319149
8538176,1,B0099VWOZK,Terible movie I had to fast forward all the way through.  I think Sunny should stick to porn.  Her acting is atrocious and the only good thing about the movie was the set in Sri Lanka.  I am embarrassed I let my curiousity get the better of me...,1351036800,,246,4.083333333333333
