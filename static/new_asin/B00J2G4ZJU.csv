6316228,5,B00J2G4ZJU,"I chose 'excellent' as my rating because I actually received my DVD before expected. I would like to be able to purchase the complete series, but apparently the complete series is not ready for purchase. Is it possible for you to notify me via email when each episode is ready for purchase. I would now like to purchase #4-Secret and Lies. I would and will recommend to all of my other friends and associates and I have a lot of them.
Thanks for wonderful service.

It is really put together very well, however, the first of the series has very different characters.  But the blending of the 3 main characters in the remaining series is just magical.

It's not filled with foul language and sexual inuendo like so much of the media world is today.  When there's so much filth and ugliness in just about everything there is to view, no wonder there's a decline in good morals.

6316246,5,B00J2G4ZJU,"LADY IN DISTRESS RESCUED!! ;-) Just at the time when good-hearted Constable Jack Thornton and caring teacher Elizabeth Thatcher are starting to become friends, Jack is requested by the local minister to reopen the investigation of the fire that burned down the church. Circumstantial evidence points strongly toward a local widow, one that everyone,  including Jack, has great respect for. Elizabeth is furious at Jack for even thinking that Cat Montgomery may have set fire to the church,  and Jack tries to explain that he personally doesn't think that Cat is guilty,  but that, as a lawman, he can't allow his feelings to interfere with his work. Against his will, he is forced to arrest Cat while he goes out of town to verify her story. One of Elizabeth's students finds a necklace that Elizabeth finds out was presented to Cat by one of the coal company's hired men, who had tried to marry her, but she had refused. When Elizabeth returns the necklace to the man, she finds at his cabin evidence that he had framed Cat for the fire. The man catches her looking at the evidence,  and pulls a gun on her. Just as he is about to pull the trigger, Elizabeth's knight in the red coat (Jack) arrives, knocking the man to the ground and holding Elizabeth as she hysterically throws her arms around him. He had verified Cat's story, and is pleased to be able to return her to her children. Elizabeth invites Jack for a picnic,  and he discovers that she does not like spiders at the same time that they begin to realize their attraction....... Adorable series!!! Would definitely rate it higher if it were possible!!!! :-) This dvd contains the 3rd and 4th episodes from the Hallmark tv series.",1410048000,3,1692,4.683501683501683

Not since 'Little House On The Prairie' has a series been more heartwarming! Based on Janette Oke's book When Calls The Heart, each episode is directed/produced by Michael Landon Jr. Not surprising, this Hallmark presentation 'A Telling Silence' is sure to delight viewers once again!

Amongst them are Rosaleen who has not uttered a word since she lost her Dad in the accident and a school boy whose crush on his new teacher is as sweet as can be!
I'll mention quickly Rip the basset hound, a new addition to the jail house for he is sure to win hearts.

Costume designer Sandra Burns earns a mention on this blog due once again to her fantastic costumes and as always, a heartfelt thank you to Michael Landon Jr. for keeping tradition in the family: this is the sort of movie you do not have to fear showing to the whole family!

6316259,5,B00J2G4ZJU,"When Calls the Heart: A Telling Silence is a feature length film made from episodes of the television series, When Calls the Heart. The series is the story of Elizabeth Thatcher (Erin Krakow), a teacher who was raised in a wealthy family but whose first assignment is a small coal mining town that recently suffered a tragedy that resulted in the deaths of many of the miners. Another newcomer, Canadian Mountie, Jack Thornton (Daniel Lissing), and Elizabeth have sparks flying with a few clashes but also a budding romance and friendship developing.

In this episode, young Rosaleen (Mamie Laverock) has not spoken since the mining accident which took the life of her father. Elizabeth reaches out to help her young student, and is highly suspicious of a man who seems to strike fear into the child each time she sees him. She brings her concerns to Jack and it looks like her fears may have been realized when Rosaleen suddenly disappears.

Jack is also busy investigating the suspicious fire that destroyed the town church. The pastor (Adrian Hough) is getting a lot of pressure from the head of the mining company about the drop in attendance, especially since the townspeople are flocking to hear Cat Montgomery (Chelah Horsdal) speak each Sunday. Cat lost her husband during the mining accident, and was one of the few who did not attend the memorial service. Evidence is building against her and even her son, Gabe (Mitchell Kummen) has doubts of his mom's innocence.

My Review: I love this series! The characters are people you get to know and love ( or loathe) as their stories unfold. There is enough drama, comedy, mystery, and romance to keep my attention, and leaving me wanting to see more of the story. This particular episode revealed new layers to one of my favorites, Cat Montgomery. (The actor who plays her son always stand out to me; I expect to see a lot more of Mitchell Kummen in the future.) There was much to be learned from the this storyline, but it was achieved through the art of telling a story and telling it well. Ken LaZebnik wrote this episode and it was directed by Michael Landon Jr.

6316260,4,B00J2G4ZJU,"I can't say more than the other viewers have already said.  This is a good wholesome show!  It's clear that Michael Landon Jr. continues in his father's legacy of providing great entertainment by creating characters we can care about and without peppering it with unnecessary language.  The only reason I am giving this 4 instead of 5 stars is because I don't understand why they would not release the entire 1st season in one DVD set.  $18.99 for 2 episodes is a bit ridiculous, especially when you can get the entire series for $20 when purchasing on iTunes' Season Pass or through Amazon's Prime program.",1401840000,,607,4.752380952380952

6316263,5,B00J2G4ZJU,"This whole series is amazing. It is definitely going to because an American family classic, as in the tradition of ""Little House on the Prairie "" and ""The Walton's"". Can wait for the next CD in the series to come out!",1401753600,,217,4.317073170731708
6316264,5,B00J2G4ZJU,"It's amazing how seamlessly two television episodes fit together to form one full-length feature! The writers of When Calls The Heart seem to write shows this way, as two independent pieces of a larger whole. In this DVD, we have two mysteries involving silence or secrets. And as one mystery is solved in the first part, another comes to light to be examined in part two.

The first case is that of little Rosaleen Sullivan, the girl who chooses not to speak. Elizabeth Thatcher (Erin Krakow) continues to earn the trust and respect of her students. She is settling into her role and becoming more effective. Not only do we see her compassionately reaching out to Rosaleen, but we are treated to some lighthearted moments involving a school boy crush directed at her.

In these episodes, we see Constable Jack Thornton (Daniel Lissing) continue his sleuthing work, this time investigating the church fire. Just as Elizabeth is taking ownership of her role as school teacher, the constable is making his presence (and his justice) felt in Coal Valley. While he is completely professional when it comes to his work, we're afforded little glimpses into his lighter side. We are introduced to Rip, the hound who takes up residence in the jail with Jack, and we are witness to more friendly repartee between Jack and Elizabeth, including an intimate lunch on the water.

We learn more about the people of Coal Valley. In addition to Rosaleen and her mother, we become more closely acquainted with Cat Montgomery and her family. And through her story, we discover a lot about her strength and resilience, her love for and bond with her children, and her devotion to her late husband. Elizabeth shows, once again, that she isn't shy when it comes to helping a friend or working to uncover the truth. But have no fear, for when that rapscallion Mr. Gowen and his minions further display their villainous ways, Constable Jack will be neither intimidated, hurried, nor deceived.

We are reminded that when times get tough in this town, the community of Coal Valley unites in common purpose. And we continue to see the ripples of hurt, despair, and frustration left behind in the wake of the mine disaster. We discover that, whether it's the town drunk or town preacher, no one is untouched or immune to pain or jealousy. We watch these two dissimilar men -- similar in their outcast/outsider role -- work through their personal issues and find forgiveness, acceptance, and a second chance.

As Elizabeth records her experiences in her journal, we are gifted with this nugget of wisdom: ""The light of love restores every lost voice.""

Verdict:
5 of 5 stars. When Calls The Heart again produces quality, family-oriented television. These episodes not only entertain but inspire, uplift, and bring hope.

If you are a fan of Little House on the Prairie or the Anne of Green Gables films and Avonlea TV series, you'll love When Calls The Heart!

6316266,5,B00J2G4ZJU,"We enjoyed a rare mid-week movie night tonight. It was the third dvd in the When Calls the Heart movie series, A Telling Silence. The only thing missing was the popcorn. Should have thought ahead on that one. ~smile~

Elizabeth Thatcher is a young teacher working to make a difference in the company coal mining town of Coal Valley on the western Canadian frontier. Jack Thornton is a Canadian Mountie assigned to the town to keep the law. Sparks fly when a young girl disappears and the town must find her. Elizabeth's friend is accused of burning down the town church, and Jack must investigate. This puts everyone in an uproar. The local pastor is accusing, the local drunk is frightening, the local coal boss is intimidating, and Jack and Elizabeth must make sense of it all. He comes across as the knight in red wool in this family friendly movie. Throw in a little puppy love and a whole lot of family love, and it makes for an entertaining and safe for all ages movie. Of course, this is a Janette Oke inspired movie, so there are a few other sparks, too.

This one's worth watching.
I received this movie in exchange for an honest review from Edify Media.",1401148800,,1163,4.533333333333333
6316267,5,B00J2G4ZJU,"Sometimes it's the things we don't say that have the most powerful impact in the lives of those we love. Such is the case in the latest DVD addition to the When Calls The Heart series that has been showcased on the Hallmark Channel from best selling author Janette Oke. In A Telling Silence, Jack Thornton (Daniel Lissing) is called upon to investigate the destruction of the town's church that was destroyed by a fire. The church's pastor believes that it wasn't an accident and asks Jack to look into a possible cause by Cat Montgomery, one of the women in town that has taken it upon herself to continue church services among the trees until a new church is built. But did Cat really have anything to do with burning down the church? What evidence will Jack uncover that will point to one of the only people in town to have purchased whale oil, the cause of the fire?

While Jack continues to look for other sources of who purchased the whale oil, Elizabeth Thatcher (Erin Krakow), Coal Valley's school teacher notices that Rosaleen Sullivan fails to speak due to what her mother believes was caused by losing her father in the coal mine explosion. Yet as intelligent as Rosaleen appears, Elizabeth believes there is more to her story than anyone realizes. Especially when she seems more than terrified of a strange man that appears in town. Elizabeth believes that there is more to the story than anyone knows and convinces Jack to investigate the circumstances surrounding the child's fear. But will Elizabeth believe what Jack discovers or will she take matters into her own hands?

Fan's of Little House on the Prairie will love this timeless series that Janette Oke breathed life into and with the direction of Michael Landon Jr have brought it to reality through Hallmark Channel. Now available on DVD through Word Films, A Telling Silence is the third DVD to bring this series back into your home. The romantic tension between constable Jack Thornton and Elizabeth Thatcher is pure romantic chemistry and show cases the lives of the residents of Coal Valley, a town created by the Northwest Mining company. When an explosion claimed the lives of many of the town's men, the women remained to raise their children and took it upon themselves to hire Miss Thatcher as a school teacher. Believing there is more to life than coal mining, she reaches out to her students in extraordinary ways.

I received When Calls the Heart: A Telling Silence compliments of Word Films and Edify Media Group for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation for a favorable review and the opinions expressed here are strictly my own. Having grown up with Little House on the Prairie, I have been a faithful follower of this series on Hallmark and couldn't wait to review this on DVD and add it to my personal family DVD collection. This is perfect family entertainment for all ages and those of you looking for that wholesome family value in your movies, than this is simply perfect for you. Christian Historical and Western Romance fans will absolutely LOVE this series based on the novels from best selling author Janette Oke. I easily give this one a 5 out of 5 stars and look forward to even more in the future. Finally something my whole family can enjoy!",1401062400,,3267,4.728070175438597
