8060301,1,B0009GV99G,"i have been in radio most of my life, and i love talk radio...this video would like to proclaim itself as 'the history of talk radio', but it is nothing more than a republican, conservative white-wash of the truth...
they try to make out like rush limbaugh is the savior of the talk radio format, along with fellow gop flunkies oliver north and g.gordon liddy, but they pass over don imus and howard stern with the blink of an eye...

now, i'm no fan of stern at all, (quite the contrary), but, ya' gotta admit, he did stir things up a bit, and set a tone for the MAJORITY of what talk radio is now...

but imus is an institution...you cannot talk about 'talk radio' without his MAJOR contribution...(even amazon put his name first in the 'featuring' section...)

yet...the people actually featured on this tape to any length, are all hacks that very few people listen to, or care about, like rush, and most have only stayed in their format because the station owners like 'em...

(and in regards to new york being 'too much' in the video, frankly, you can't have too much when it comes to new york and radio...it's the mecca that all radio personalities strive for...)

sadly though, there's just too much unwarranted republican nonsense on this tape to even make it worth the time of day, no less all of 'history'...",1188518400,5,1318,4.567796610169491
8060302,2,B0009GV99G,"Too much New York bias (and I'm an ex-New Yorker who listened to the profiled personalities in my youth) hurt this effort. Tom Leykis and the late great Jean Shepherd were conspiciously missing. The Chicago School (Studs Terkel) wasn't on this video tape at all. In short, this film was a flawed effort, a disappointment.",1127174400,7,321,4.8545454545454545
