4922830,1,B0060Q3IU2,"I love this show and bought each season individually.  I thought I would like to have the show in one boxed set instead so I purchased this item.  What a mistake I made.  There is a reason this packaging is half the size of the individually boxed seasons.  Upon opening the set I had a hard time getting the center to slide out of the shell.  Turns out the inside is very flimsy and cheap!  It opens out to the two cheapest plastic [don't even know if I should use that word to describe the material] containers.  Each container holds half of the discs on a flimsy spindle.  There is nothing to protect the discs from one another, they are just stacked on top of each other.  The worst part of this packaging is how they chose to keep the discs in place.  They chose to insert round brown cardboard pieces stuffed into the containers.  They might as well have used duct tape instead.  This is by far the worst packaging I have ever seen in my life.  I can't believe they chose such inferior products to house such an awesome show!!!  Even bad TV deserves better packaging then this atrocity!  I don't usually write reviews, but I'm just so stunned that this was done!  Hey Sony I have a better idea so you can save more money, why don't you just sell the set in the spindle containers that they use to sell blank disc media!  All you would need to do, would be to put a sticker label on the outside!!",1348704000,91,1400,4.262357414448669
4922831,5,B0060Q3IU2,This show was a one of a kind type of show that was funny and very hard hitting! I always wished it was on HBO so they could forget about the censors however they still got away with murder on this show! I really miss this show but they decided to end it while it was still high in the ratings!!,1348704000,,295,3.8524590163934427
4922832,5,B0060Q3IU2,"I will miss any possible new episodes of Rescue Me.  As many of you know Denis Leary and co-creator Peter Tolan decided to end this series when it was still on top. From the very beginning episode to finale you will enjoy this story.  To put it aside.  The fire fighting scenes are completely realistic, well filmed and gives you some idea of what real Firefighters deal with everyday.  The story line is great, of coarse featuring Denis Leary as Tommy Gavin.  Tommy is a raging alcholic dealing with demons from 9/11 and the overall stress and fears related to his job as a NY firefighter.  It that's not enough his personal life is a mess.  With a demanding wife, needy kids, mistresses and one-night stands.  Which half of the time just creates even more reasons for him to drink.  His entire family is as about dysfunctional, chemical dependent as he his.  There are only a few things Tommy lives for.  Fighting fires, drinking and sex.  He tries to change his life several times, just to be beaten down by some tradgedy or just about anything that makes it for a good excuse to drink. His firefighter co-workers knows he is a drunk.  They want to work with the guy because he's like teflon when it comes to fighting fires.  Some of my favorite scenes are of the guys in his crew busting each others ba--s! Funny timely stuff. I own all 7 seasons already and plan on buying this complete set and giving the single seasons to my parents who just love this show and miss it.  I would give this a 10++ in entertainment value and it has made me a big fan of Denis Leary and firefighters in general.  You can catch some of this on NetFlix first.  If you want to give it a taste.  But if you enjoy it.  Please do yourself the favor and buy it. Oh by the way the delted and gag scenes are funny too!",1346716800,7,1796,4.323353293413174
4922833,3,B0060Q3IU2,Hi - If you are still checking this I think that this set is expensive because it has extras. If it doesn't please let me know because I'll buy the individual seasons. Thanks,1337731200,,174,4.303030303030303

4922905,5,B0060Q3IU2,Bought this after Netflix took it offline. Such a great show. Set came with every episode and was in perfect condition. Don't be surprised if the disk sleeve falls out eventually. It is just lightly glued in.,1518307200,,208,4.648648648648648

I assume everything else was okay as the packaging mentioned 26 disks and I only had 25, but who knows. I guess I'll need to buy some of the disks again.",1517097600,,285,4.296296296296297

4922938,5,B0060Q3IU2,"One of the best shows you will ever watch. Great characters, deep interactions, and believable dialog delivered well. The writing is truly off the charts, you'll roll on the floor laughing once scene and the next it will feel like an elephant sitting on your chest. I don't say that many shows NEED to be watched, as actually need to be watched some point in your life, but this is one of them. The casting was remarkable, everybody nails their role, they suck you into the day to day and you can't help but get invested

There is one scene late in the first season where the fire crew stands looking at the skyline where the Twin Towers stood. I'm not going to say any details, but that scene was a home run and once you watch that scene you will be hooked. It oozes the raw power of this show. I can't praise it enough.",1502582400,,821,4.262820512820513

4922941,5,B0060Q3IU2,"I watched every episode of this show when it was on TV and I loved it, so I was thrilled to finally be able to buy the box set of the entire series.  I have a question though about the box set. I have been ripping the disks to .mp4 files to put on an external USB drive which I have hooked to my TV. I do this to all my DVDs so I can rip them once then store them away. I rip them then name the episodes just like they're listed in the guide that came with the box set. However, when I got to ""Season 6 and the Final season"", which according to that guide, there's supposed to be 19 episodes, 10 in season 6 and 9 in season 7. But when I finally got through ripping them, the last five disks contained 39 episodes. Can someone tell me why? What are all these extra episodes? I don't even know where to start naming them as there are 20 more episodes than from what I can tell there's supposed to be. Thanks for any help.",1496793600,,920,3.893617021276596

It may not be rated but only moron would not be able to see what category it belongs. Personally I would not even give it a 1 star rating it is more like a -10 rating.

4922959,5,B0060Q3IU2,"Five stars because this is one of the best television shows in existence. I received it for Christmas this year and have throughly enjoyed getting to rewatch it, since it's been taken off Netflix. However, the packaging is total crap. The two flimsy plastic containers that hold the DVDs were completely unglued when I received it. I had to hot glue them back onto the packaging, as well as glue back on the episode list that is attached to the back of the box. The DVDs are all stacked and held together by cardboard. It's crap. BUT. If you take care of your DVDs and you're easy with removing them, it'll be fine. For the money that you're paying, and the one of a kind tv show that you're getting... it's absolutely worth it. It's about the brilliance of the show, not the packaging. Just be prepared.",1486771200,,804,4.476190476190476

4922980,5,B0060Q3IU2,I'm a big fan of Denis Leary's comedy. He's not a half bad actor. This was a great series. Especially with the timing of 9/11 and all. Made for some intense shows. Good mix of drama and humor in this. Good show to watch with your better half.,1480896000,2,242,4.0625

- Language: English
- Subtitles: English
- Subtitles for the Hearing Impaired: English

This is wrong. There are no subtitles whatsoever. I need english subtitles to be able to follow a series without concentrating too hard to enjoy it, so all in all this box set turned out to be useless to me, hence the lowest rating and a quick explanation to inform other people about this problem.

Note: the DVDs have closed captions (CC) but those can't be seen when using a HDMI connection, which is pretty much the standard these days. Besides, that still means the product details are wrong because subtitles and CC are a whole different thing.",1468195200,,808,4.56551724137931

Instead of having each season's episodes DVDs divided separately, and organized, the creators of it, for whatever reason, decided to just put all of the discs on top of each other, with the potential for scratching them. There's no protection.

4923071,1,B0060Q3IU2,"I didn't much like it.  It's one of those anti-hero shows, like Mad Men or Breaking Bad.  The point seems to be that being a 9-11 hero fireman makes  all kinds of immoral, self-destructive, violent behavior understandable.  The characters at times appear to start wising up, or turning their lives around, only to spiral down again.  It's to the point of being not believable in some instances, i.e. there is no way Tommy gets back with his wife at the end of the series, after all the lying, kidnapping, and abuse.  Also, more people get injured in fist fights and gun shots than in fires.  I know this type of gritty flawed-humanity show is very popular right now, but it's just too much nastiness to be enjoyable for me.

What I've taken away from this show is:
1. Never live in New York City (it is a cesspool death trap)
2. Never get involved with a fireman (they are either dumb as a box, or sex-crazed players, or violently obsessive. Plus throw in a couple of addictions)
3. Stay away from anyone who is Irish and/or Catholic (way to re-establish that horrible stereotype, script writers).",1444003200,2,1097,4.589743589743589

4923090,5,B0060Q3IU2,"Totally hooked on this series! We often watched three episodes in a row. I had, until seeing this, thought that Denis Leary was strictly a comedy actor, but he proves to be an immensely capable drama actor as well. He is completely believable as the valiant but troubled Tommy Gavin, and even when he behaves badly, you root for him anyway. ALL of the acting is superb here. The supporting characters are all terrific, there are engaging subplots involving most of them, and I particularly like his lieutenant ""Loo"" Ken Shea and Chief Jerry Reilly. Charles Durning is perfectly cast as Tommy's father, and crazy Uncle Teddy provides comic relief.. There is a supernatural element to this story, and you wouldn't think it would work in a straightforward drama, but it's actually done quite well, and it's believable in this context. The only things I'd change, and they are very minor points: they are rather heavy-handed with the Alcoholics Anonymous stuff. We know Tommy is an alcoholic, but it takes up quite a lot of screen time and is a bit repetitive; much of it could have been surmised. Also much is made of the fact that the Gavin family is of Irish descent. Kiss my Irish ass, it's my Irish temper, my Irish disposition, we Irish do it this way, etc etc. A bit too much of that.

Highly recommend this series, and you don't have to be at all interested in firefighting to appreciate it.",1439164800,4,1395,4.647773279352227
4923091,5,B0060Q3IU2,"Just finished this series on Netflix - WOW! This is one of the finest shows I have ever watched, and it kept my husband and me totally riveted right to the end. This is a series that appeals to both men and women - it's a chickflick with tons of macho for the guys. Beautiful, stylish and sexy women, muscled up men, and a real sense of comaraderie and brotherhood. Yes, they are dysfunctional with a capital ""D"", but there is love everywhere - both in the firehouse and within their own families - but that's what makes a story, no?

My next stop is a one-click purchase.

4923135,4,B0060Q3IU2,"I'm a big fan of this series so when TW Cable started showing this for free (shows on demand) a little at a time b/c they'd post a new episode every 2-3 weeks, I got extremely addicted to the show again and decided to buy the box set.  I looked at other places besides amazon for buying the set and all other retailers sell the set the same way for the same price $40, it's not sold with different packaging anywhere else.  The set was delivered very quickly too.  I started watching it and getting to know how the discs are put together.  First, I want to thank all the reviewers for the heads up on what to expect.  For the price you're paying for the whole set, it seems like they put it together this way to keep the cost of the set down.

Yes, all discs are put together with no protective sleeves, 1/2 of the DVDs on one side, 1/2 on the other side of the box with good pics from the show.  The first 4 discs from season 1 are clearly marked on each DVD how many episodes are on each DVD, but from season 2 and onward, they don't mark how many episodes are on the DVD, you have to put it in your player to find out.  There's only a 1-page insert that lists all episodes from all seasons.  But it's basically 3-4 episodes per DVD.

The one thing I love about each DVD is there are also special features like gag reels (bloopers), deleted scenes, trailers from an upcoming season, and on the first DVD from season 1 there's a long featurette which interviews the geniuses... Peter Tolan & Denis Leary (my hero), the cast, how they put the show together, behind the scenes, etc., which is really well done and interesting.  I will buy separate DVD sleeves to house each DVD in order to protect them but otherwise this is a real gem to own and was a great show.",1427068800,,1763,4.186390532544379

Yeah, my ex is a firefighter, and this excellent series really offers a true to life look at the psychological turmoil many firefighters went through after 9-11, but perhaps even more so portrays how self-centered, arrogant, misogynistic, racist and duplicitous many of the men who work in this job can be. Alcoholism, gambling, infidelity, sex addiction, power tripping, aggression, it's all there and then some. One message seems to be that men drawn to this occupation are often psychologically damaged, and/or prone to narcissistic behavior. The hero worship that kicked in post-9/11 didn't help. But the show also delves into the extreme grief, often unexpressed, and the serious PTSD that affected many firefighters who lost co-workers at Ground Zero. Interestingly the show does not shy away from showing the ways that surviving firefighters often exploited the event, mainly to pursue sexual conquests (this is mentioned in the first five minutes of the pilot episode in fact). Of course, some firefighters are genuinely brave and compassionate, good family men, kind to others, treat women with respect, etc. And we all know they risk their lives working for relatively low pay. But kudos to RESCUE ME for exploring the chinks in the armor of the men who do this important work. Anyway, I was happy to get this entire boxed set for about the same price we had paid for just ONE season on DVD, so I guess I lucked out in the end. I do agree with some of the other reviews that say the packaging is a somewhat flimsy for a boxed set; some way to separate the discs would be nice.",1400803200,,1868,4.715596330275229
4923231,5,B0060Q3IU2,Dr. Dennis Leary'S masterpiece what can i say other than i wish he was still doing the show and i cant wait for him to get another role where he is so kick ....,1400457600,,160,3.735294117647059
4923232,5,B0060Q3IU2,"Shipping of this box set was exceptionally fast (along with the paper sleeves I ordered & Free Shipping) and have just begun to watch the first disk.
""Rescue Me"" was a wonderful series that I had missed except for reruns during late night.  I liked the series so much, decided to purchase it so I could see the beginning of the series to the end.  It's smart, funny, poignant, and what's not to like about Denis Leary?
The packaging is not as bad as the reviews indicate.  There are pictures posted that can give one better insight.  I did purchase paper sleeves for each disk.  Once I am assured that all disks are viewable, then will cut away the part of the two interior plastic enclosing of the box containers, insert the paper sleeved disks, and the box will be able to contain all the disks (I measured).  The outside presentation looks good.
This price is exceptional.  It's not Blue Ray, of course, but if it were, we would be talking about 3 digit numbers rather than just a tad under $40.  One has only to check the price of each season individually and make a comparison.
Did not take the time to review the menu of the first disk, but for right now, the series jumps from one episode to another, rather than having a break from one episode to another.  That could be a good thing, or an annoyance.  Time will tell.  It's really hard to find the time to sit thru an entire disk at one time.
You get what you pay for.  If the disks are all workable, then buying the paper sleeves should prevent any scratching.
There are always ways to work around issues provided the disks are all viewable.  So far, am very happy with my purchase.
Just made a note posting but don't see it.

They are not even in sleeves of any kind like I seen with another total season package I recently purchased. It is sad because I just know that with having these DVD's placed on top of each other like this that they are going to become scratched. I have heard others say that they were going to find additional packaging for theirs but then how do you fit them in the nice box they all came in? Either way, it is an extremely bad packaging design and either you can have the entire series sit nicely on your shelf or have to go out and purchase additional cases so the DVD's don't get scratched and have nowhere to store them.

-
Let me be very clear here - yes, the package that holds the set is sub-par...BUT, for the price you're paying for this complete set (my pre-Christmas 2012 price was under $32), people really should stop with their antics.

This set: You get all 26 DVD discs that would come if one purchased all of the individual season sets.  The shows on these DVD's are anamorphic widescreen - they will show as widescreen on DVD players that are capable of handling this format (which should include even the cheapest models) on any widescreen TV.  I do own an older DVD player which does not handle the anamorphic format, and on that the show displays in letterbox format.  They have english closed-captioning which is switchable through your DVD player's settings (not on the discs themselves.)  The discs have all of the content that you would expect on the individual season sets - featurettes, gag reels, etc.

There's nothing fancy here.  The only insert is a single page overlay that numbers the individual episode names for each season.  The box butterflies to expose the two spindles of DVD's.  The twin spindles hold the DVD's securely, with cardboard packaging inserts to hold each stack down.  That's it!

In my opinion, any price under $75 would make this a worthwhile purchase.  As others have complained about, you might hope for better packaging - but I look at it as I'm getting everything that matters for a small percentage of the price of purchasing the individual season sets.  For all that money that I've just saved, I'll purchase aftermarket cases for my DVD's and still get to enjoy everything I loved about this great series...all of the extra content is just the cherry on top!

If you loved the series, you'll love this set.  Buy it and ENJOY!  (I have uploaded pictures for those who want more detail on the packaging)

Cheers!!",1357171200,53,2024,5.140672782874618

The problem with this is the packaging. It is so horrible that the entire thing is just unprotected.
Would you just throw your discs together somewhere, leaving them unprotected? That's exactly what the individuals behind this product expect you to do. Two separate 'halves' of the box, each have a spindle to put your disc in, collecting them in a group. Talk about a huge, huge mess, and massive problems when it comes to keeping discs protected.

Sohl, another reviewer, said about the packaging, it has a nice outer shell, but the discs stacked on top of one another, & what they're contained it...extremely cheap.  At least I got it on sale, so thanks Amazon.  Also, there are no Setup options for sound, language, or subtitles that I found.  Thankfully closed captioning is, but I still see the lack of the Setup options as a downer.

Anyway, I adore the first three seasons, so fun, dramatic, raw...& continued watching even when I felt there was no progress to the life of Tommy Gavin, or felt the humor became slapstickish.  I'm hoping to enjoy the entire series more without having to deal with any commercials, or waits between seasons!

All in all, 3 to 3.5 stars is what I give!",1348790400,4,767,4.521739130434782
