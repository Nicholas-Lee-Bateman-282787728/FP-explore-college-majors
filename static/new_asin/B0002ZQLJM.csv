2153654,5,B0002ZQLJM,"The Anabaptists believed that God's people were baptized by water and by fire.  Most Christians are baptized by water, but few by the fire.  This film will teach you how those freedoms were gained by the fires of persecution.  Go back to a time when being baptized as an adult; reading the Bible; sharing Scripture; and holding divergent views from the ""official"" church were crimes punishable by the most cruel methods possible.  I promise that if you are a conscientious Christian, the conviction of how much your faith means to you, will keep you from sitting passively through this film!  It is an excellent film in both content and performance.",1042070400,5,649,4.863636363636363

2153656,5,B0002ZQLJM,An excellent video showing the desperate struggle individuals in the Middle Ages encountered when they chose to follow Biblical Christianity.

2153667,1,B0002ZQLJM,A one sided account of the Protestant Reformation and the rise of the Anabaptist Movement. The religious wars of the 16th and 17th century Europe were one of the saddest in European history for everybody. This is Sunday School for people who chose to have their children see it otherwise. Don't expect to see the reality of religious civil war. This is on the intellectual level of a period Anabaptist pamphlet. Every religion has martyrs. Let the dead rest with the dead. They all went up to the same God anyway.,1403222400,,513,4.648351648351649
2153668,4,B0002ZQLJM,"Another great film showing just what our forefathers went through just to get the truth of the bible out to us, well worth watching, based on a true event, don't miss out on the Radicals, well worth the price..",1398643200,2,210,4.410256410256411

2153670,4,B0002ZQLJM,"I always like it when I learn something new about the past history of my predecessors in the faith I hold - Christianity. It is important to remember those who suffered at the hand of not only Romanism but also the Protestant establishment in Zurich, Switzerland. It is sad to see that the Protestants made the same mistake in embracing a political agenda at the expense of the truth of the Gospel. Baptism of infants was at the heart of the rebellion of the Anabaptists. They correctly interpreted the Bible which never ever showed the baptism of an infant. Accepting the Gospel has always been done by adults who could make an informed decision to follow the precepts of God and Christ. This movie shows the progression of discovering the truth of the Gospel by the one who would become the leader of the Anabaptist. He eventually gave his life for his convictions. His burning at the stake was a political act of blinded people by power. As always, absolute power corrupts absolutely even the Protestant who should have known better. Good acting for a subject that is no action-pack.",1388966400,2,1086,4.721052631578948

2153674,5,B0002ZQLJM,"This film is hard to watch, sad, disturbing, and very sobering, but I'm so glad I saw it.  I came away from it so sobered in my relationship with the Lord.  I found myself thinking about my love for Him, what I would be willing to risk and to suffer for Him, and I also felt moved to consider what I'm doing to serve Him now, in this day and age.  This movie had the impact on me that any movie labeled ""Christian"" ought to have.  It's worth your time, if you're a true Christian.  If you're a typical American Christian who really liked ""New Hope"" and ""Abel's Field,"" than this movie won't be of interest to you, because it actually contains the gospel.",1365724800,7,654,4.241935483870968
2153675,5,B0002ZQLJM,"The detail towards accuracy, the use of REAL clothing from the period as loaned by Swiss Museum authorities, the travel and filming on location whenever possible at original sites is simply a rare and phenomenal effort to record history rather than create drama.

2153677,4,B0002ZQLJM,"I am a campus minister. When our student leadership team for our collegiate ministry wanted to tackle the topic of ""What does it mean to be Baptist,"" I suggested we show this to set up our discussion. The profundity is unmistakable. Would you be willing to die for your faith? Recognizing how the church being separate from the state in the U.S. has shaped our understanding of the church becomes clear as you see those who risked all to merely express believers' baptism. Of course, the other radical theological departures that have shaped the evangelical church are clear too. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because the acting could be a little better, and the costuming seems questionable. As the movie unfolds, however, the story engages you powerfully and compensates for any drawbacks.",1318809600,3,792,4.874074074074074
2153678,4,B0002ZQLJM,"The ""documentary"", as opposed to the feature, sufficed for my purposes, as it in actuality is a condensation of the latter
and contains the crucial scenes, including the drafting of  the Schleitheim Confession, although only articles 1, 6, & 7 are mentioned, and the trial, in which Sattler's memorable comments are taken verbatim from the records. A worthwhile purchase, one that provides students with illuminating insight into the beliefs and suffering of the Reformation era's most numerous victims of intolerance, at the hands of Protestants and Catholics alike.",1303689600,3,567,5.443181818181818
2153679,5,B0002ZQLJM,"I first developed an interest in this film because of my interest in the career of Norbert Weisser, the lead actor who plays Michael Sattler, and I wanted material for the Official Fansite I do for him. I came away with a deep appreciation for the story, the characters of Michael and Margaretha Sattler, and the people that brought this film to reality.

The love story is probably the most well acted and believable I have ever seen. The on-screen chemistry between Norbert Weisser and the beautiful and gracious Leigh Lombardi is a tangible thing. The story of their faith, their beliefs and the inner courage they had is even more powerful.

The supporting cast is fabulous --from Mark Lenard as Eberhard Hoffmann, to Christopher Neame as Ulrich Zwingli, Daniel Perrett as Wilhelm Reublin and Jerry Nelson as George Blaurock -- everyone turns in terrific performances. However, I must say that I am partial to Norbert Weisser as Michael Sattler -- he brought forth such a wonderful sensitivity to the character of Michael Sattler. Norbert often plays a villain on the screen, but his quiet and calm manner as Michael was exceptionally well acted.

Even though I had limited knowledge of the Reformation and the Anabaptist movement, and had never heard of Michael and Margaretha Sattler, I got so caught up in this film that I developed a 20th Anniversary commemorative tribute for the film. I also designed and developed an entire website based on the film, the historical characters and the location -- the film was that well done, watchable and memorable. The entire cast and crew really pulled off an under-rated masterpiece with this film that is enjoyable on many levels and one you will want to watch over and over.

Yes, this is a faith-based film, but it is also a well written and produced - and accurate historical film, a love story that rivals the best of them,  and a testimonial of having the inner courage of standing true to your beliefs no matter what the price.  You will love this movie!",1274745600,7,2010,4.794797687861272
2153680,2,B0002ZQLJM,"This was a great story and it would have been one of my better DVD's in our Christian collection if it were not for the cussing. I really do not understand these film makers.

2153682,5,B0002ZQLJM,"The Radicals is an historical fiction movie based on real history of the Anabaptists during the 16th century.  It shows the struggles that believers went through opposing Catholic theology and government, only to be further challenged by other reformers and Protestant governmental authority.  It accurately shows the sacrifices many went through, including martyrdom, during the Reformation era.

2153685,5,B0002ZQLJM,"Here is the journey of a man and a woman that actively put their faith in the Lord Jesus Christ during the Reformation Era.

They were used by God to lead others into the practice of adult baptism. That was contrasted to infant baptism. They were called Anabaptist.

This practice was violently opposed by the leaders of the church and the state.

They continued amidst persecution, suffering and ending in death as martyrs for their faith.

This movie makes personal and real a critical season of church history.",1187481600,12,513,4.795454545454546
2153686,5,B0002ZQLJM,"THE RADICALS is a top-notch dramatization of the true story of Michael and Marghareta Sattler, a married couple who were separately executed for their faith in 1527.  For young children the included special feature children's story is recommended instead of the feature film, as it avoids some of the torture scenes, even though the feature movie itself avoids anything too graphic, for example, reciting rather than visually showing the extent of the judgment imposed upon Sattler.  Through the centuries Christians facing potential harm for their faith have been strengthened by Sattler, who purposely planned a signal to publicly show whether God would give grace to endure martyrdom.  The feature film doesn't show this part, though its explained in the special features and history, that Michael before his execution predetermined to raise his finger heavenward  to indicate whether martyrdom was bearable and for how long.  Michael's hands were bound, and also his tongue was cut out (so his words couldn't affect crowd), but when the fire burned thru the rope, Michael raised his finger and kept it up.  Days later his wife Marghareta was drowned after refusing to recant, saying ""I do not follow my beliefs because of my husband, I follow my husband because of my beliefs.""

The movie's story, which is told thru the character of Willhem de Rijcker (an Anabaptist Radical who influenced Michael but later recanted and so saved his physical life), starts with then unmarried Michael and Marghareta working in proximity to each other, Michael as a monk who became a friar, and Marghareta was in an order that took care of the poor and sick.  Because of plague, famine, and war in Eastern Europe, the peasants were suffering, yet as friar it was Michael's job to collect taxes from them.  The Protestant Reformation had started, as had printing of scriptures for common man by the new printing press, and Michael began to question the tax-collecting and other practices and teachings of the Church.  He asked Marghareta to leave with him to search for truth and a new, though risky, life.  In Zurich they heard the ""Radicals"" (as they were called) teach a message of freedom of personal belief rather than belief imposed by a state church, and of not so much ""reforming"" but ""restoring"" the Church, going back to the teachings of Jesus and his original disciples by finding out and obeying what was taught by the scriptures, not an insitution.  This did not go over well with Ulrich Zvingli, head of the Zurich Church, who clung to many Catholic practices despite being a Protestant reformer.  For ex, the unbiblical 1000-year Church tradition of infant baptism was continued, mandatory, and had become a mark of citizenship.  The Anabaptists' refusal to baptize babies was just one manifestation of their bigger issue: belief in separation of church and state and freedom of worship.

At a certain point the Anabaptists gathered from several countries in Schleitheim to tweak their beliefs and settle increasing disagreements about particulars. After drafting a statement of faith, ""The Schleitheim Articles"" (whose 7 points are included inside the DVD case), the Sattlers were arrested, tried, and executed as heretics, two of several thousand Anabaptists ultimately killed by fellow Protestants.  Their spritual descendents include some Mennonites, Brethren, Baptists, Quakers, and others.  The movie is historically accurate when compared to books written on this topic (such as Martyr's Mirror).  That plus its inspiration/integrity motivating value, its unique subject matter, its many special features, and its quality acting and production, make it worth its price.",1163376000,64,3678,5.226190476190476
8035359,5,B0002ZQLJM,"Awesome movie about the Anabaptists. Though based on a historical novel that was written by a leader in the Mennonite church, it is a pretty accurate depiction of the issues and concerns that gave rise to the Radical Reformation in the 16th century.

8035360,5,B0002ZQLJM,"I am an historian that specializes in the Reformation period and must say that this is an excellent film. It does a great job of telling the heartfelt story of the Sattlers, while seeking to remain faithful to the history. Of course, no 2 hour film can do justice to all the complexities of history, but overall, this film does as good a job as can be expected.

Storyline is true to history although there are those of other religious persuasions that would take me to task on that, but history is history. The story is right on and although it's feel is historical drama, most of the plot is carried by long dialog style in more of a documentary feel. No matter, the point gets across.

4 not 5 stars...what a low budget film. Acting is stiff, filmography low budget, a sort of B movie. You know what though, that's not the point of The Radicals. It's a lesson in the abuse of power and the story of the beginning of a movement that has flourished to today, albeit shamelessly broken into many sects.

8035366,2,B0002ZQLJM,"We didn't finish watching it, so we can't vouch for all of it, but we stopped watching around the time the Anabaptists gathered for the Schleitheim Confession. There was a lot of language for a movie like this (mostly from the Catholic/Protestant side, of course ;)), and the dramatization of Michael and Margaretha's love story was a bit much for me. When he asked her to leave with him, it wasn't like, ""Maybe the Anabaptists are right,"" or ""What our church has been doing to the poor is horrible."" It was, ""You know you love me. Let's run off together,"" and then they start making out. Also, it almost seemed like they had Conrad Grabel pseudo-threaten and lie to the peddler/spy who was trying to go through their territory. They essentially hollywoodized the story with a B rated film. If you want to learn about the history for more than just entertainment purposes, it would probably be better just to Google it. Gameo has a decent synopsis.  We cannot recommend this movie to anyone that holds the teachings of Jesus due to multiple uses of profanity, sexualization, and the lack of historical accuracy.
