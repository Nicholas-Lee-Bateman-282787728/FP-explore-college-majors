8210583,5,B000TSJ004,"My 3yr old grandson is into construction EVERYTHING. He likes this dvd because it tells and demonstrates about 3 different jobs and shows the workers doing construction, building and lumberjack work and they are using all the necessary equipment.",1414195200,,246,5.333333333333333
8210584,5,B000TSJ004,Bought it for my nephew and he loves it. Good video for kids that love anything to do with construction vehicles and building things.,1384992000,,133,4.583333333333333
8210585,5,B000TSJ004,"Our children 2 year old boy and 6 year old girl truly enjoy this one.  Our boy is not into cartoons and has always enjoyed documentaries, he has been into chainsaws from a real young age.  And the lumberjack one was just what he needed and people can't believe how much he was able to learn from this movie (we come from a real lumberjack family).  Our daughter on the other hand really enjoys watching them build a house. The construction one is a little longer and is the least requested, I think they will enjoy that one when a little older. It does have a lot of different machines on there and shows how they work. Yes there is a ""genie"" but I just talk to our children about that being make believe and how they should never walk away with people they don't know. Our children watch very little tv and we try to have it as educational as possible when we do. We own many of the all about movies.",1314921600,2,901,4.196531791907514
8210586,1,B000TSJ004,This item looked like a dvd box with a dvd in it but unfortunately it was only a disc and a little truck in a box making it hard to store with other dvds because it doesnt have a case.  Had I have looked more carefully and saw the truck I would have never ordered it.,1311724800,,267,3.767857142857143
8210587,4,B000TSJ004,"I bought this DVD for my 20 month old son who has taken a great interest in construction ""machines"", as he puts it.  The DVD has 60 minutes of construction vehicles in action and 30 minutes each of building construction and lumberjacks in action.  The construction vehicle portion starts out as as ""story"" of two kids releasing a ""construction site genie"" from a thermos who takes them to various sites to watch the machines in action.  The acting is really amateur and the voice-overs are not that great; however, there is a lot of construction machine/vehicle footage to hold a child's interest.  The ""genie"" does explain in detail the machines names and what their jobs are....I actually learned a thing or two.",1198886400,3,714,4.827868852459017
8210588,1,B000TSJ004,"An effeminate man in a hardhat (a ""genie,"" calling himself Hardhat Harry) lures two young boys away from their neighborhood, promising construction site adventures. Say what????

If that's not enough, the dialogue and voice-over are painfully bad.

But... my son loves watching the diggers. So I just turn down the volume on the TV and turn up the volume on the CD player instead.",1196208000,,380,4.921875
