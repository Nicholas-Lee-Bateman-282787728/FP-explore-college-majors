2014060,5,B0001LYFKO,"I saw this documentary a few months ago and at the time I didn't know much about the Weathermen except that they were a leftist activist group. But after watching this film I got a lot of insight into this 60's radical group. The thing I liked most about this film was the fact that the weathermen weren't portrayed in a negative light, instead the filmmaker tried to show them in a positive light. Most films would have tried to portray them as ""commie scum"" or ""terrorists"" but they weren't either of those things. They were in fact antiracist and antiwar. I haven't purchased the DVD yet so I don't know what kind of extras there are but the film itself is excellent and I think everyone should see it.

2014065,5,B0001LYFKO,"This is a very insightful documentary with the distinct advantage of getting live interviews with some who were in this group that virtually became a cult. From those interviews we can get a slight glimpse into how a relatively small bunch of educated young adults can devolve into anarchy.

I was around during that time and was a protester of sorts but what happen here is when the organization 'Students for a Democratic Society' (SDS) was taken over by this group we all felt it was too radical then and still today. In fact they were one contributing reason for the demise of the altruistic movement to improve our society/culture in positive and peaceful ways which was the sentiment of most back then. And I think it's important for young people today watching this to realize these anarchists were not anywhere close to nor representative of the vast majority who were protesting peacefully.

The documentary shows a lot of film filler from that era of street and town views, mostly depressing but nostalgic to me, to fit the overall aura or mood of the film. In a few spots it gets a little over the top but for the most part it's a well balanced fascinating look at the attitudes and perspectives, both then and now, of this group and it was done at the right time to get all the major players on board and involved. A bonus is being able to watch the documentary with commentary by Bernadine Dohrn and Bill Ayers.

I did not find the documentary slanted as some have stated and it's seems it wasn't intended to make up your mind for you. You decide.

Last, this group was more anarchist than terrorist. They focused on damaging federal buildings and stuff, not human casualties. Unfortunately they failed to realize using violence in any way only scares people, not bring them over to your side and for me this was the bottom line and lesson to be learned.",1465689600,,1867,4.614457831325301

2014078,4,B0001LYFKO,"""The Weather Underground"" is a surprisingly non-sensationalist and non-judgemental documentary about the Weathermen or Weather Underground, a radical leftist group in the United States that carried out a string of bombings during the 1970's. The Vietnam War and the state repression of the Black Panthers were some of the issues against which the Weathermen protested in this ultimately unproductive manner. (The Timothy Leary incident is apparently exaggerated.) Most of the members eventually turned themselves in, and received relatively light sentences, due to the scandals surrounding FBI's COINTELPRO operations. A few made the mistake of joining other illegal armed groups, eventually ending up in prison.

The program is a good overview, regardless of how you might feel about the people involved and their political tactics. Ex-Weathermen leaders Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn were wrongly associated with Barack Obama (sic) in a Republican smear campaign during the 2008 presidential elections, and hence became famous once again, after a fashion. This isn't mentioned in ""The Weather Underground"", however, which was produced several years in advance.",1382400000,3,1164,5.767441860465116
2014079,5,B0001LYFKO,"Very surprised no one had ever done documentary on this group until now. The film does not at all glorify them, the directors simply told a story of why these American college students simply wanted to stop the senseless armed conflict in Vietnam and their stance against oppression and racism in America. While I don't agree with their politics i.e., communism, and their unrealistic premise of the majority of Americans would violently revolt against the American government, their commitment ( by death if necessary) to the cause for social change, as told by the director, is very engaging!! I absolutely can't get enough of Weatherman Niomi Jaffee's quote early in the film: "" if you sit in your little white house and go to your little  white job and allow the country you live in to murder people, and you sit there and don't do anything about it that's violence""...if one is not part of the solution they're part of the problem. In the director's commentary, the director said when he interviewed the group said that they didn't want to be ""good Germans"" (in relation to Jaffe's quote)---wow!!

I was only five years old when the group went underground, officially,in 1970 after the townhouse explosion (I had my own problems with racism) but I had heard of the name around 1975 and in 1980 when most of charges (the many bombings the group committed)were dropped because of arrogant, stupid, and corrupt tactics of the FBI.

Too bad these directors, although nominated, didn't win the academy award for best documentary film---and these directors were not born during that time!! Any unearthed story from the turbulent 1960s that would educate today's young adults in order to further civilize and clean up bad behavior is alright by me.

2014080,3,B0001LYFKO,"This is a funny film to review. To begin with, the protagonists are all 60s terrorists who are presented as sensitive seekers of truth, justice, and the American way. The politically ill-educated may consider them ineffective relics of a bygone era, but Ayers and Dohrn launched Obama's political career in their Chicago living room after years of serving on the board of the Annenberg Foundation. I knew Jeff Jones peripherally in the late 1960s as a fellow Antioch student and friend of my SDS cousin.  A good-looking, charismatic young guy back then, he's become another fat, well-connected ""environmentalist"" consultant for New York State and the Obama administration through the Apollo Alliance--despite his violent past as a domestic terrorist and decade-long federal fugitive. (Not bad work if you can get it. ""Environmentalism"" is the new false flag of the movement to destroy private property.) Mark Rudd is another overweight ex-revolutionary whom I briefly met back in the day. He appears marginally self-aware in the film. Brian Flanagan seemed to be the most conscious member of the group, able to question his ideology and understand its shortcomings.

2014083,4,B0001LYFKO,"I thought this film was rather insightful, regardless of your political opinion about the Left in America or the Weather Underground. It covered their failings such as plotting to blow up a military dance during the Vietnam war (which prompted some people to leave as this was clearly an unfair act of terrorism directed against ignorant young men who were about to be sent off to die fighting for what they were brainwashed into thinking was ""freedom and democracy"". Overall, the interviews and documentation of events that led to the Weather Underground's activities and formation are rather interesting. It grew out of the SDS or Students for a Democratic Society, a pluralistic antiwar, pro democratic radical student organization, the founder of SDS is interviewed, and he denounces them for destroying and hijacking the movement he started to create peaceful democratic change. The former revolutionaries interviewed in the film are rather unrepentant even though their actions were ultimately ineffective in creating any positive social change, instead it just pleased some more violent revolutionaries to know that government buildings were being bombed too and not just the people of Vietnam. As for their bombings, they always warned the State and typically set them off when the building was closed. What they were able to bomb was impressive such as the Pentagon but still is ultimately meaningless violence. The greatest achievement of the Weather Underground, in my opinion, is the stealing of FBI documents that detailed COINTELPRO, a horrible KGB style program that the US government used to discredit, assassinate, conduct illegal surveillance, and ultimately divide the left. There is still illegal surveillance going on to this day and COINTELPRO was a perfect exemplification of just how far the US government would go in ignoring the Bill of Rights in order to maintain power and a uniformity of public opinion. As for what is happening today, the SDS has been reformed by different people and is a prominent student on organization on several US campuses in New York and perhaps elsewhere.",1342915200,,2111,5.2485207100591715
2014084,5,B0001LYFKO,"During the 2008 election, the name Bill Ayers was thrown around by Sarah Palin and others as if he were the devil incarnate.  I met the dude face to face and I need to expose something.

BILL AYERS IS JUST AS NICE AS HE CAN BE!  When I was unemployed in 2002, my father arranged a meeting and Professor Ayers gave me advice about how to get a job as a progressive.  Later he introduced me to his brother, another progressive, who gave me advice.  Later I went to a talk at a feminist bookstore where his wife was talking about ways that free folk can help women in prison.

The movie generally attempts to present the causes, actions and consequences of the Weather Underground, a subversive anti-government movement formed in the late 1960's and active during the 1970's.  Their original cause was to protest the Vietnam War.

The movie repeatedly stated that the 25 government offices bombed were done with care so that no-one was exposed to injury.  But, it does not state that the bombings were damaging government property which is against the law.  They compared the bombings to the actions of the Boston Tea Party against the British.  They robbed banks in order to acquire funds for their existence and actions.  This documentary idolizes the fact that the protestors got away with breaking the law for their social causes.

Three of their own members blew themselves up while attempting to assemble bombs intended for anarchy against the government.  The row house on 11th Street in Manhattan was blown up in 1971; a young Dustin Hoffman was living in the house right next door to the house that blew up.  The movie showed how bombs were assembled with a timing device like an alarm clock and wiring and dynamite in many scenes.  Apparently, the individuals responsible for this movie want to encourage violent protesting.

The Weather Underground assisted in the prison escape of Timothy Leary who then fled to Algeria to escape US government law.

They supported other protest groups such as the Black Panthers in Chicago and sympathized with their beliefs.  Fred Hampton, a leader of the Black Panthers was killed when Chicago Police broke into his house.  This angered the Weather Underground and gave them more reasons to protest against the establishment.  Then the movie compared the eloquent way Fred Hampton spoke with the way George Bush spoke.  Again, this is just trying to mock the establishment.  He should have compared to the way Obama speaks without a teleprompter.  But, Obama was an unknown in 2003.

The Chicago Police were not the FBI.  The Chicago Police are known for taking things into their own hands to accomplish their goals.

The documentary showed both Billy Graham & Richard Nixon singing ""God Bless America"" in a sports stadium filled with fans as if it was mocking the establishment.  It also commented that Ocean Beach was deserted.  This is just an absurd comment.

When the Vietnam War ended in 1975, the protest causes then changed and shifted to other social and government issues.  Later their protests morphed into other causes such as protesting for labor unions in Chile.  Even when the interviews of the original Weather Underground members were being documented for this movie in 2003, the members were still highly biased and charged against the government with their original rhetoric of 30 years ago.

This response just proves that once an idealist protester, their ideals will remain strong in their minds and convictions throughout their life.

This movie would be a good model for the FBI to study for their education on how subversive groups are formed and function over time.

The members of the Weather Underground are idealist anarchists that believe in violent protesting to prove their point.  They are well educated and intelligent, but are not educated in the way to protest without damaging property, breaking the law, robbing banks and harming individuals with explosives.  It's a felony crime to use explosives without the proper credentials and licenses.  They ignore the law to prove a point while relying on the Constitution's First Amendment, Freedom of Speech to protest.",1319760000,,4294,5.051136363636363
2014086,2,B0001LYFKO,"I don't have a problem with doing a documentary about the Weather Underground.  I don't have a problem with such a documentary featuring many interviews with former members of the group.  What I do mind is that the documentary pretty much consists of these individuals making statements that the documentary makers don't bother to challenge.  Also, the documentary makers don't give any biographical information about these former ""urban guerrillas"" lives which might give some context and understanding about why they embraced violence.

I also didn't see any dialogue between the documentary makers and their subjects where they got asked hard questions.  I would have liked to have seen them put on the spot about all the murderous communist regimes they idolized (like Mao's China ... then in the grip of the Cultural Revolution or the North Vietnamese, or the Soviets).

I guess I just question the overall way this project took place.  Like I said above, the Weather Underground was certainly a worthwhile subject for a documentary.  But I can't help but think that the film that resulted from this effort reveals a bit of bias to the violent left that some of our nation's elites have.  After all, it's not like this is a companion piece to a similar project about the Ku Klux Klan (which would feature members talking with nostalgia about the days where they ""fought for the South"").",1310774400,11,1391,4.961206896551724

2014089,5,B0001LYFKO,"This is the best documentary on the group collectivly known as the ""Weather Underground"".Shows the turbulent times perfectly. Many political currents were surging together,yet no one knew where the riptides would collide. You had good people wanting change,and bad people wanting to cause trouble. There is an interesting irony here. When Saigon finally fell to the VietCong,the Western radikals began to fall apart as well. Why if Third World communism was advancing,did European Old World Labour and American New World socialism regress?It was interesting to watch the former leftist activists sadly describe their youthful political conflicts and the commerades they lost along the way. Some of the radikals ,who were of the Jewish faith,were left like fish out of water. They rejected their Jewish ritual observances,embraced wandering Bohemian values,and later had to deal with evangelical mores around them. I wonder if Ira Einhorn had any contact with the Weathermen? Tony Alamo never went back to jewish,and went on to become an evangelical minister. I always thought the 'Weathermen' and the 'Weather Underground' got their name from Uncle Joe Stalin. During Stalin's early days,he worked with a group of scientific meteorologists,at a weather observatory. And they surely talked about political beliefs and their disdane of the oppressive Tsar. This documentary ended on a sour note for communists and leftists alike. I wonder if communism is realy dead. China now has the largest economy in the world. South America is moving forward with refined socialism. Once the right-wing dictators were moved along,their Latin American economies began to improve,under left-wing socialist policies. North Korea and Cuba ,controlled by internal blood kinship,has remained stagnet and fruitless. It appears the red radikals of the '60s went on to become 'Christian Socialists'.Many Jewish yippies appear to have suffered by leaving their rabbinical family values. Abbie Hoffmann overdosed and Jerry Rubin sold out to commerce. Ira Einhorn did not become a 'Soldier of Christ' and was later charged in the senseless death of his girl-friend ,Holly Maddox. Holly was a young Southern girl,from a conservative family. She was like a lost sheep,in search of a meaningful bell-wether. The zeitgeist of the times,mislead her towards the hippie pied-piper,Ira Einhorn. As Leftism began to ebb out,and the ethos began to change,the couple differed and splittered. This documentary shows that not all the sixties marriages ended in complete failure. Bill Ayers is still married to Bernadine Dohrn. The photos ,throughout the documentary,are amazing. The graffic photos of Jay Sebring and Sharon Tate are shocking. Several interesting footage shots of the various demostrations and police-battles,yesterday and today. A segment of film has even the defrocked academic and the High Pope of Dope,Timothy Leary. Which shows that there were so many varied causes and very different people ,working together,to promote change.

2014092,3,B0001LYFKO,"Having been born in the late seventies, I missed two whole decades of influential history. This history is too recent to have been covered in my history classes and too far back for me to have had any personal experience. To fill the hole, I've been watching films.

I had not heard of 'The Weathermen' before I came across this film. (I had heard of Bill Ayers, of course, but knew very little about him). I knew that groups like this existed into the seventies from references made to them in other movies ie, the SLA (being the most often referenced and parodied).

For me this film was quite informative. Being a Chicago native, I learned about a number of big things that happened right here in my own back yard. However, I couldn't shake the sense that something was missing. The film presented this group as sort of soft core. A lot a harsh talk, but only ""non-violent"" action (non-violent in that they only hurt property, never people). ::I don't think that is what Dr. King had in mind.:: Anyway, for a group that never hurt anyone, they sure had a lot of enemies. The original SDS founder seems super-fumed & hyper-concerned about their association with his group. There is video of a member of the Black Panthers saying effectively - 'These stupid, priveliged, kids are WAY out of control. We don't want anything to do with them.' - Wow!

In the movie they do come off as a group of idealistic, over-priveliged white-kids, playing with bombs, but it is repeated ad-nauseum that they didn't hurt people. It sounded untrue based on the things others in the film had to say about them and I have since found some pretty disturbing information about this group, most especially the Bernadette Dohrn comments about the Manson murders.

This movie gains three stars for pointing me off into a direction of interesting research, but loses two for obvious bias.",1252454400,3,1864,4.691131498470948
2014093,4,B0001LYFKO,"This is an interesting and well-made documentary that tracks the evolution of ""The Weather Underground"", a  late 60s and early 70s USA radical movement that used violent means in order to fight against a government its members didn t believe in.

According to some, their struggle was ""like a children's crusade gone mad"". I completely agree, but I think that the strongest point of this documentary is the way in which it highlights the reasons why an student living in that period might have felt attracted to the kind of distorted political activism that ""The Weather Underground"" proposed.

In that sense, this film includes not only footage from that epoch, providing a good historical context, but also more recent  interviews with former members of this movement, that give their retrospective opinions on what happened. A few would do exactly the same thing again, while others regret their deeds, saying that their intentions were good but their means weren t. One of them sums things up in what I think should be the tagline of this documentary: ""When you feel you have right on your side, you can do some horrific things"".

Highly recommended....

2014094,4,B0001LYFKO,"The documentary Weather Underground is a fascinating look at the 1960s group that attempted to ""bring the [Vietnam] War home"" by committing bombings and other violent acts in the U.S. It is difficult to fathom why the WU genuinely believed it could overthrow the U.S. Government and replace it with a communist utopia. The film is thought provoking, but the filmmakers, unfortunately, chose not to discuss some of the worst behaviors of the WU's members.

The best part of WU, for me, was not the film's account of the WU's history; I've read several books on the group, so the history was already familiar.

What I found fascinating were the contemporary views of the former WU members. The former members have widely-differing views on whether the WU actions were justified. Some members defend the group's idealism, others concede that the WU violence was wrong. I think that it is fair to say that each former WU member still has some degree of angst about the group; none of the interviewees seems to be completely ""at peace"" with his or her participation in the group.

My main criticism of the film is that, while encouraging the viewer to think about SDS' actions, it does not mention many of the WU's most-shameful moments. For instance, the filmmakers fail to mention that:
a) Bernardine Dohrn lavishly praised Charles Manson and his followers for murdering ""pigs"" such as Sharon Tate. (Specifically, she said ""Dig it. First they killed those pigs, then they ate dinner in the same room with them, they even shoved a fork into a victim's stomach! Wild!"").
b) Richard Elrod, an aide to Chicago's Mayor Richard J. Daley, was paralyzed by the injuries the WU's members inflicted on him during the WU's Days of Rage in Chicago in 1969. After Elrod's injury, the WU publication New Left Notes stated ""Elrod is now paralyzed--hopefully for life. He won't be so quick to play pig next time.""
c) Several WU ""alumni"" committed two murders during a 1981 armored-car robbery in New York. It is particularly bizarre that the filmmakers do not mention the case because they interviewed ex- WU member David Gilbert in prison for their film; the film tells the viewer that Gilbert is in prison, but never says why.
To be fair, the film does include several comments from Todd Gitlin (a former President of SDS, the group that spawned the WU) on the arrogance and ignorance of many WU members.

I still think that this film is well worth watching, providing viewers keep in mind that (as always) they are hearing and seeing only certain facets of the story. My wife and I watched the film together and we both found that the film caused us to think about the issues it raised long after we finished watching it.

2014095,5,B0001LYFKO,"A fine documentary about an extraordinary group of people.

The Weather Underground grew out of SDS, and in its early days reflected the inchoate yearning for authenticity, combined with sex and drugs, characteristic of its generation.

Then the group became more radical. BRING THE WAR HOME was their slogan. They planned to blow up a military dress ball, killing as many people as possible.

But when three of their members were killed in an accidental detonation in New York, they called a time out and reviewed their whole philosophy. They decided that they would never hurt anyone in any of their bombings. And in this they were successful.

They bombed public buildings, corporate headquarters, even the Capitol Building in Washington, without hurting anyone. They protested our coup in Chile, the Vietnam War, the murder of George Jackson -- things that were more than deserving of protest.

After the Vietnam War ended they splintered, discouraged by their lack of purpose and by inner disunity. In middle age they express regret over their conviction that they had ""the moral high ground,"" they compare themselves to fanatics like Timothy McVeigh and the perpetrators of 9/11. But this regret should concern only their youthful impulse, not their acts. They hurt no one, and they destroyed property in a good cause, the cause of justice.

I think the Weather Underground, like the New York Philharmonic, the U.S. Senate, the Supreme Court, should have been an ongoing organization whose members changed over time. By bombing public buildings associated with official cruelty and barbarism, they could have been a constant reminder to our government that its crimes do not go unpunished, and a reminder to Americans that there is still resistance and will always be resistance. We certainly could have used them during George Bush's presidency, when the only sign that Americans saw anything at all wrong with the war in Iraq was Bush's lowered approval rating.

In her commentary with husband Bill Ayers, Bernardine Dohrn laments that the U.S. government is still systematically murdering Black resistance leaders, and says in a somewhat throwaway tone, ""We did topple two Presidents."" This is a stark reminder that activism can accomplish great things.

One of the group's members, Naomi Jaffe, says eloquently, ""If your government is murdering people and you stay at home and do nothing about it, your very inaction is a kind of violence.""

That kind of insight is rare and valuable.",1234137600,2,2494,5.1382716049382715

Though similarities to today's climate are argued in the commentary track, the idea of overthrowing the government seems as unlikely now as it did 40 years ago. Kids today don't get this earnest, and crazy. The human waste of David Gilbert, in prison for 75 years, is one of the film's most powerful images.

2014100,4,B0001LYFKO,"I've had a lifelong fascination with radical groups. Religious heretics of the 11th century or the Jacobins in revolutionary France or the Symbionese Army, they all fascinate me. What drives them, what makes them fight against incredible odds, what makes them give up, it all fascinates me. Only recently has there been a serious body of work on the radicals of the 1960s that attempts to address these questions.

Green and Siegel's contribution to this is the documentary The Weather Underground, the story of how the ultra-militant Weatherman organization grew out of the non-violent SDS. Packed with interviews of many of the main characters - including Mark Rudd (of the Columbia U takeover fame), Bernardine Dohrn, Bill Ayers, Brian Flanagan and David Gilbert - and interspersed with period news footage the film provides a sense of the rage that fueled the Weathermen and the regret with which they now regard the past.

Which is not to say that the film is a mea culpa. Most of the interviewees are at pains to explain what they did and why it seemed the only thing to do at the time; not to ask for forgiveness. The interviewees seem so calm and reasonable you could forget what they're talking about which is essentially acts of terrorism and revolution.

There are moments of dark, unintentional humor along the way. Like the footage of the blonde, gum-chewing preppie who tells the reporter they're going to take on the police with ""more physical confrontation, whatever's necessary"", all the while snapping her Juicy Fruit. Or when Bernardine Dohrn's sister proclaims her actions ""Right on and she's far out."" I found myself sympathizing with the Black Panther spokesman who dismisses the Weathermen as ""muddle-headed."" For all their fierce beliefs, they seem to be playing at revolution, casting themselves in the role of revolutionaries based on what they've read rather than what they've experienced. Their efforts to turn themselves into a communist cadre never seem to rise much above leaving in communes, group sex and eating ""oatmeal with nothing on it"" and ""psychological tricks"" that one describes as ""so cultish.""

Yet their beliefs are not simply whims. Rudd and Jaffe speak convincingly of their conviction that doing nothing was a form of participating in the oppression they perceived. Each member made sacrifices to ""go underground"", a phenomenon one describes as a ""state of information control."" They saw themselves at war with an oppressive, murderous state and told themselves they were willing to do whatever it took to overthrow it.

And therein lies the rub. As ex-Weatherman Brian Flanagan puts it: ""If you think you have the moral high-ground ... you can do some really terrible things."" Those terrible things including bombings. It's quite something to see Ayers' and Dohrn's contortions to pat themselves on the back for making a big effort to make sure no one ever got hurt as a result of their bombings. There are several problems with that. First and foremost, once you set a bomb, all bets are off. No matter how many warnings you send out or precautions you take, one mistake or unanticipated action is likely to end in the death or dismemberment of another. All their efforts could have been undone by one act of bad luck. Second, this requires them to go to further contortions to distance themselves from the Greenwich Village townhouse explosion. Describing it as ""an autonomous group in New York City"" starts off the fun, as if the ""group"" in NYC had little connection to the rest of the Weatherman. The film includes quotes of regret from most of the interviewees but no exploration for the greater toll the bomb may have taken had it not exploded prematurely.

Green does a good job of trying to present both sides of the story, however, with Todd Gitlin presenting a dissenting New Left view of the Weathermen. The former radicals, in interviews and quotes from letters and memoirs, convey the sheer boredom of life underground. No jobs, no prospects: in a weird way they finally did live the lives of the oppressed they claimed to fight for.

Whether you watch this for entertainment or for enlightenment or both, The Weather Underground delivers. Green and Siegel have begun the effort to ""Tease out what was right from what was wrong.""",1225238400,8,4290,4.9582753824756605
2014101,3,B0001LYFKO,"The film itself is a mish-mash. Not a bad film, it is not good, either. It gives little context to why these people would give up the privileges most poor people, black or white, strive for. Could it be, like many bad artists, they believe nobility is to be found in struggle? Ask anyone who's really struggled and they'll consider that view nave, at best, and pornographic, at worst. The Weather Underground started out in 1969 as a splinter group from the Students for  Democratic Society (SDS) called the Weathermen (taken from the lyrics of a Bob Dylan song: `you don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows'. They started bombing buildings as `acts of protest', yet were ridiculed by the Black Panthers as a bunch of spoiled white kids who made things tougher for them because they were unskilled. The Weathermen were also reviled by mainstream liberal and anti-war groups as making their points of view seem unpalatable to the moderates in the nation. Ironically, they were seen basically as useful idiots by President Nixon and the Right Wing.
  Unlike, say ex-Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, in The Fog Of War, only a few of the group seem to have gained any wisdom. Rudd states, `I cherished my hate as a badge of moral superiority', and Flanagan seems to rightly see how close he came to being bin Laden, when he states, `If you think that you have the moral high ground, that's a very dangerous position and you can do some really dreadful things.' A still bitter ex-SDS leader named Todd Gitlin also perfectly nails the ethical morass of the Weathermen, and much of the most radicalized Left, when he states, `They were ready to be mass murderers, the same as Hitler, Stalin, and Mao, and their grand projects for the reform of all humanity. In the face of that, ordinary life was dispensable.'
  As a film, there are several clever sequences of recreations, that Green recounts well in the DVD commentary, and the lack of funding for the film worked in its favor in at least one aspect. Failing to have the money for classic 1960s rock songs, the film used eerie avant-garde music, which adds to the delusion of the ideas many of the talking heads provide. Overall, the film is a so-so concoction, and the comments add little. A half hour interview with murderer David Gilbert adds little insight, save that the man still has not gotten his act together, and an art film on the terrorists adds even less insight. Overall, the bonus features are rather meager. This film breaks no new ground on the times, nor artistically, and just underscores that the folks involved in any terror movement are not good people, despite their protestations to the contrary. If only Mystery Science Theater 3000 were still around to lampoon this film there might be a good commentary available. Alack, the lack!",1221955200,2,2822,4.751020408163265

Alright.  This is a very focused film on the 60's/70's group The Weather Underground.  It has contemporary interviews w/its members, a few people from The Black Panthers, a former FBI agent, loads of archival footage and some helpful narratives that guide you through events of the period.  It doesn't stray too far from the members of the organization and I don't think it paints an overly sympathetic view of the members. It let's you make your own judgment on whether their actions during the period make them heroes or villains (which you should not post in a review of the film) or at the very minimum, it educates you about a period in American history (I was a toddler at the time & my parents didn't let me read/watch the news nor talk to strangers).

2014103,2,B0001LYFKO,"After seeing this film, I had to wonder what these people were thinking when they got started. Did they really think that they were going to be the cadre of a nationwide movement to destroy the capitalist system in the United States? It seems so.

One of the biggest flaws, besides their near-total reliance upon violence and the destruction of property, is the simple fact that their whole reason for existing was the Vietnam War. As soon as that war was over, they had no reason to continue.

From the beginning, they lacked any real support from outside their group and that should have made them stop and think. The ""Days of Rage"" was just an incident where windows got smashed and little more than that. They weren't revolutionaries. They were vandals. For all the time spent in hiding and for all the sacrifices they made, what did they accomplish?

Aside from this documentary and a few other works, there is no lasting legacy of the Weather Underground. One of their members is serving a life sentence, others had served time in prison and been released and some of their members even died in the early years of the group. For what? The United States didn't withdraw from Vietnam because of them specifically, so they couldn't claim the victory that they had suffered for and deprived themselves of creature comforts in its pursuit.

I am glad that most of them have gone on with their lives and have even coninued in progressive causes. However, I see nothing that justifies what they did and I feel sad for their lost and wasted youth.

This is a good film to see for part of the history of the domestic U.S. opposition to the war in Southeast Asia. However, it is also a good film to see for how not to run an anti-war group.",1194825600,11,1736,4.551282051282051
2014104,5,B0001LYFKO,"The Weather Underground is a well done documentary about the movement of the same name.  It produces a somewhat sympathetic portrait of some really screwed up people who thought that terrorism was the way to justice.  Probably a little too sympathetic; some other posters have noted the absence of several quotes by members of the group praising the Manson murders, for example.

What is really disturbing about this film is how completely unrepentant many of them are.  Bernardine Dohrn in particular strikes me as someone who should to this day be considered very dangerous.  For some of these folks, it is clear that the only 'regrets' that they had was that they didn't kill more people.

Despite that, the movie is worth watching.  I loved some of the music, it gets very moody, and does a good job of documenting the implosion of the Student Left.  You may come away from it thinking that they were very brave revolutionaries, or you may decide, like I did, that they are a truly pathetic bunch of malcontents who don't deserve any sympathy.  But it's an eye-opening movie and highly recommended.",1183420800,5,1102,4.819148936170213
2014105,5,B0001LYFKO,"In a time when I, among others, are questioning where the extra-parliamentary opposition to the Iraq War is going and why it has not made more of an impact on American society it was rather refreshing to view this documentary about the seemingly forgotten Weather Underground that as things got grimmer dramatically epitomized one aspect of opposition to the Vietnam War. If opposition to the Iraq war is the political fight of my old age Vietnam was the fight of my youth and in this film brought back very strong memories of why I fought tooth and nail against it. And the people portrayed in this film, the core of the Weather Underground, while not politically kindred spirits then or now, were certainly on the same page as I was- a no holds- barred fight against the American Empire. We lost that round, and there were reasons for that, but that kind of attitude is what it takes to bring down the monster. But a revolutionary strategy is needed. That is where we parted company.

One of the political highlights of the film is centered on the 1969 Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) Convention that was a watershed in the student anti-war protest movement. That was the genesis of the Weathermen but it was also the genesis of the Progressive Labor Party-led faction that wanted to bring the anti-war message to the working class by linking up the student movement with the fight against capitalism. In short, to get to those who were, or were to be, the rank and file soldiers in Vietnam or who worked in the factories. In either case the point that was missed , as the Old Left had argued all along and which we had previously dismissed out of hand,  was that it was the masses of working people who were central to `bringing the war home'  and the fight against capitalism. That task still confronts us today.

One of the paradoxical things about this film is that the Weather Underground survivors interviewed had only a vague notion about what went wrong. This was clearly detailed in the remarks of Mark Rudd, a central leader, when he stated that the Weathermen were trying to create a communist cadre. He also stated, however, that after going underground he realized that he was out of the loop as far as being politically effective. And that is the point. There is no virtue in underground activity if it is not necessary, romantic as that may be. To the extent that any of us read history in those days it was certainly not about the origins of the Russian revolutionary movement in the 19th century. If we had we would have found that the above-mentioned fight in 1969 was also fought out by that movement. Mass action vs. individual acts, heroic or otherwise, of terror. The Weather strategy of acting as the American component of the world-wide revolutionary movement to bring the Empire to its knees certainly had (and still does) have a very appealing quality. However, a moral gesture did not (and will not) bring this beast down. While the Weather Underground was made up a small group of very appealing subjective revolutionaries its political/moral strategy led to a dead end.

That said, their history is a worthy topic, though it is more than a little unnerving to see them reminesce about the past without realizing the severity of their actions. The true voice of reason is this film, is Todd Gitlin who although still a strong liberal activist continues to condemn the Weather Underground for what they did. I can't say this film supports what they did but it tends to cast them in a more favorable light than they deserve and to see that some of them are now college professors didn't exactly thrill me. However, as a primer in how the campaign for social justice and equality in the 60's fell apart and divided into factions, this is an excellent film. There is archival footage, the most fascinating of which is a clip from Emile D'Antonio's ""Underground"" which captured the Weather Underground while they were still ""active"" and in hiding in the early 70's and brought the unwelcome attention of the FBI.

2014110,5,B0001LYFKO,"Many documentary film-makers don't play fair.  They ignore any fact or argument that doesn't support their position, and edit their footage in a way that forces you to accept their views.  Their goal is not to inform, but to persuade.

Consider Michael Moore.  I like his documentaries -- and I'm inclined to agree with him on the issues he's addressed (e.g., gun control, the war in Iraq, the arrogance and duplicity of the Bush administration) -- but they're far from unbiased.  That's fine, of course, because he doesn't pretend to be neutral.  He's an advocate who presents ideas and perspectives largely ignored by the mainstream press.  His work is valuable (and often entertaining), but ultimately unsatisfying.  I always leave a Micheal Moore film wondering what an informed person on the other side would have to say.

""The Weather Underground"" is different.  Though I'm sure the directors have strong feelings about their subject, they don't express them in the film.  Instead, they present a balanced history of the Weathermen and let you form your own opinions regarding this controversial organization that endorsed the use of violence to protest the Vietnam War.

Because the directors resist every temptation to reveal (let alone impose) their personal views, people who watch the film often have wildly different reactions to it.  I first saw the movie in a packed theater in Chicago.  One of the interview subjects was Todd Gitlin, a former president of the SDS who was active in the anti-war movement but critical of the Weathermen.  He seemed smart, sensible and thoughtful, and I found myself agreeing with most everything he said.  But others in attendance actually hissed whenever he appeared on screen.  I'm sure it would have been easy for the directors to make Mr. Gitlin appear either reasonable or misguided, but instead they let each viewer make his own assessment.

Most of them have gone from being clueless kids to clueless adults; still waiting for a world revolution that is never coming.  In the end the lesson, as stated in the film, is that radical movements cannot succeed because at some point the radicals always turn on each other.

2014115,4,B0001LYFKO,"Something of a `Where are they now?' documentary profiling members of the radical group the Weather Underground three decades on.  A splinter group of the SDS (Students for a Democratic Society,) the Weatherman, as one interviewee notes, `stole' the student left from SDS at an acrimonious convention held in the late 1960s. Affirming an affinity with liberation movements across the globe - revolution was `in' back then, - identifying strongly with the Black Panthers, and in violent opposition to the Vietnam War, the Weathermen preached active resistance against America's `white imperialist' actions at home and abroad.

Although director Bill Siegel must have sympathized with the subject, the graying radicals, neither the film nor his commentary track betrays an overbearing bias.  The film moves, sometimes confusingly, from the SDS convention to the Days of Rage in Chicago in 1969, the Weathermen's first public protest that degenerated into a bat-wielding riot.  Then it's on to a townhouse bombing where three Weathermen were killed when a bomb they were building to use at a military dance exploded prematurely.  More bombing followed the townhouse bombing, although the ex-members, who went underground at that point, stress often that the bombings were symbolic actions only.  No one was killed, they claim, and targets were carefully chosen.  Police stations when a Black Panther was killed, State Department buildings in response to atrocities in Vietnam. Siegel strings together archive film, old newscasts, and the like to tell the story.  Interspersed are talking-head interviews with surviving Weather Underground members.  Visually it's all a little static.  I've watched this film three times in the last week or so.  There are two commentary tracks, one with director Siegel, the other with original Weather Underground members Bernardine Dohrn and Bill Ayers. I don't think it could have been cut much better, but with so many talking heads and footage shot from the inside of a moving car at an anonymous landscape, well, the eye starts to starve a bit.

 THE WEATHER UNDERGROUND confronts us with an issue that is still with us and probably always will be.  What are your responsibilities when confronted with what you believe is injustice? Is, as one ex-member asks at one point in the movie, doing nothing in the face of violence an act of violence itself? The brilliant thing about this movie is that it is open to many valid responses - you can view the Weathermen as committed idealists willing to risk their lives for social justice, or young, white children of privilege intoxicated with their own sense of moral righteousness and willing to bomb themselves, along with the whole anti-war movement, to the margins with their outrageous behavior. Some documentaries invite you to stroll down Memory Lane.  THE WEATHER UNDERGROUND marches you through a nightmare battleground.  The questions it raises about social action and responsibility are as valid now as they were thirty plus years ago.",1141776000,8,3026,5.246887966804979
2014116,5,B0001LYFKO,"I gave this 5 stars not because I agree with them but thought at the time, and this documentary confirms my belief, that these people, like all terrorists, are sick. They engaged in what Prof. Lee Harris calls ""fantasy ideology"".

"" . . . It is a common human weakness to wish to make more of our contribution to the world than the world is prepared to acknowledge, and it is our fantasy world that allows us to fill this gap. But normally, for most of us at least, this fantasy world stays relatively hidden. Indeed, a common criterion of our mental health is the extent to which we are able to keep our fantasies firmly under our watchful control . . . Yet clearly there are individuals for whom this control is, at best, intermittent, resulting in behavior that ranges from the merely obnoxious to the clinically psychotic. The man who insists on being taken more seriously than his advantages warrant falls into the former category; the maniac who murders an utter stranger because God - or his neighbor's dog - commanded him to do so belongs to the latter.""

I followed Martin Luther King in his efforts and vowed to be non-violent. But it was a learning experience to see more about those who went on to some violence,although described as against property and buildings, not people

But what about today? My first thought was whether under the Patriot Act, some federal officials would be monitoring my rental of this DVD. Wow!

I would like to learn who the insurgents in Iraq are, and more about their motives. Also others described as insurgents around the world. Which ones are terrorists, and which ones perhaps patriots fighting occupation by a foreign power, or globalization?

And what can we do, what should we do in the present? What can we learn from the experience of the Weather Underground? I agree with other reviewers that the movie is rather sympathetic to the Weathermen and Weatherwomen. But it excells in having them tell a lot of their own story.

2014120,5,B0001LYFKO,"This film changed my view about a the weathermen and women, and it moved me deeply. You come to understand why they did what they did, and if you are my age of 50, you remember your own urgent and desperate feelings of being responsible to make a difference with the war in Vietnam and the horrible pain it caused for millions of innocent people. The Weathermen were part of a huge movement all over the world, and they chose the way of militant action, which was a dead end lane in many countries, especially here in Europe. Their way was special though, they had the courage to stop their plans to kill right in the beginning - after a shocking blast that killed three of themselves -  and expressed their protest against the murdering war by destroying buildings, but without hurting anybody.

I was impressed and touched by the honesty and self-awareness of the 5 people of the former Weather Underground, who shared their thoughts and fears and insecurities about that decade and their actions.  Dealing with your own history and impact with care and respect for the person you were, accepting different views today without discrediting your past as foolish or stupid; taking another stand in the world today without getting rid of your ideals of a better world with freedom and dignity for every living being - that's what I took with me from this film.

2014121,4,B0001LYFKO,"This documentary traces the history, activities and current lives of the Weathermen Underground, from about 1969, when they broke off from SDS, to today.  Most of the old familiar faces are represented: Bernardine Dohrn, Mark Rudd, Bill Ayers, David Gilbert, Laura Whitehorn, Naomi Jaffe, Kathleen Cleaver, etc.  They started as a holier-than-thou faction dedicated to ""direct action,"" beginning with the ""Days of Rage"" in Chicago in which their ""revolutionary acts"" consisted of breaking windows of upscale stores.  They then graduated to setting off bombs in public buildings.  They also formed communes in which anything smacking of civilized behavior was regarded as ""bourgeois,"" and all conventions were to be abandoned, including monogamous and heterosexual sex.

The level of sanctimony, arrogance and sheer, unadulterated stupidity overwhelmed me, as they issued manifestos in which they loftily decreed that anyone enjoying a Thanksgiving or Xmas dinner in the face of the Vietnam genocide, oppression of blacks, etc., was an enemy and was complicit, yadda-yadda.  After the famous Village townhouse blast, they went underground, and as the Vietnam war ground down and other movements rose (feminism, gay rights, etc.), they eventually gave themselves up.

Their ""movement"" was a study in futility, never accomplished anything, died of inanition.  It was also dangerous.  They seemed to be motivated by nothing more than delayed adolescent rebellion, guilt over their (mostly) overprivileged backgrounds, desperation to ""prove themselves"" to the Black Panthers, who alternately scorned them, ripped them off and (correctly, IMO) saw them as a threat--mindless Weathermen violence brought big heat down on the Panthers, who were shot and killed by police while the all-white Weathermen walked.

The modern interviews are interesting.  Most of them look befuddled and sound regretful.  In fact, only a few of the white-skins served any time in jail, despite their admitted violence, because the legal system that they hated ruled that the FBI had violated their rights via break-ins and other illegal ""Cointelpro"" tactics used against them.  The FBI Director was indicted, not most of the Weathermen.  Some of them try to justify their violence by claiming that the war in Vietnam made them ""crazy,"" and hasten to point out that they timed their bombings to avoid hurting people.  But David Gilbert is serving a 75-year sentence in Attica for his part in the famous 1980 Brinks robbery that left three cops (including a black man) dead.",1114646400,15,2543,5.435114503816794

2014125,5,B0001LYFKO,"Ah, remember when bombers called in and told people to clear out of the building before they bombed it? Them's were the days...what a quaint idea!

Watching this documentary brought back the memories (too surreal to classify as good or bad) of that time, when I felt I had to defend these guys since they were fighting the Amerikan war machine, yet had great trouble rationalizing their methods. It was good to see how intelligent these folks are, how reflective and (somewhat)remorseful. One imagines them as arrogant and strident...which they were...but like all of us from that time, they've aged and mellowed and become, well, smarter and more humane...Without justifying what they did, the film captures the zeitgeist which drove the members of the Weather Underground to the extremes of political protest. The extra material on the DVD is great, too. After viewing it, one has to conclude that this kind of secret cell revolutionary activity is useless in fomenting revolution and destructive of the humanity of it practicioners. And what they did probably at least helped bring on the present reactionary era in American history. Yet, given that millions of people marching around for peace had done nothing to stop the Vietnam War or change anything about the political culture, one can't completely fault these people for what they did. At least they left us a lesson from which we should be able to learn and perhaps create more effective means of protest and social change. Watch it and learn!",1108512000,3,1504,4.99203187250996
2014126,4,B0001LYFKO,"In the 1960s the Vietnam War began for the Americans to which Daniel Ellsworth once quote in the documentary Hearts and Minds (1974), ""We weren't on the wrong side -- we were the wrong side.""  Simultaneously with the Vietnam War civil injustice was common in the United States where people were struggling for equal rights for African-Americans in the United States.  This in the backdrop nuclear war threat instigated by a government that was dealing with real threats such as the Cuba Crisis.  The assassinations of Martin Luther King, the Kennedy's, Malcom X, Fred Hampton, and others seemed to have left a deep psychological scar in many young Americans as they decided to stand up and voice their opinion against the violence and exploitation in the world.  One of these organizations were Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), which organized rallies against the war in Vietnam and social injustice in the society, as they promoted peace and democracy.

SDS was run by college students that wanted to make a change in the society for the better, and within the the organization a number of members had more radical ideas of how this would be accomplished.  These members where a part of the internal group, Weather Underground, a name they acquired  from Bob Dylan's song Subterranean Homesick Blues where on line goes as this -- ""You don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows.""  The Weather Underground seized the power of the SDS in 1969 at the national convention in Chicago.  The founder of SDS, Todd Gitlin, described it as, ""Institutional piracy.""

The radical notions that were brought to the table by the Weather Underground was based on the little progress they have observed.  Thus, the Weather Underground decided to take actions into their own hands as they began to organize for a revolution, which they believed was needed to bring about a change.  Much of the Weather Underground's activities were considered terrorism, as they promoted active violence against the government.  However, after an incident where an innocent person was killed the group sat down and discussed the philosophy of the Weather Underground.  The conclusion was that no more lives was to be taken, and that extra precautions was to be taken in order the death of people.

Throughout the 1970s the Weather Underground committed several bombings in regards to acts they considered criminal and unjust.  They had to cut their ties with their families in order to avoid arrest by the FBI.  The FBI did everything possible in order to seek and destroy this organization, but without any luck.  When the Vietnam War ended in 1975 the Weather Underground fell into the shadows of history, and as the members grew older and began to build families a life on the run became difficult.  This led to most of the members turning themselves into the authorities, and what is interesting is that most members of the Weather Underground were released as the FBI had broken several laws in their attempts to arrest them.

Through the many interviews in the film the audience can learn that the former members of the Weather Underground are still passionate about their political views.  They believed what they did was for a just cause in a time of great difficulty and they do not regret their accomplishments.  However, in retrospect they wish they could have made some things a differently as wisdom have caught up with them.",1107388800,,3427,4.923478260869565
2014127,4,B0001LYFKO,"I had some vague information about the Weather Underground, but didn't really know the origins and such.  This documentary is another example of missing American history that they don't teach you in schools.

For example, did you know that the Weather Underground did several bombings of major U.S. landmarks?  Did you know that they broke Timothy Leary out of prison?  Also were you aware that the US intelligence community waged an illegal war against dissident groups in our own back yard?  (This I knew)

Well this is a must watch, especially since the late 60s and early 70s mirror our current situation.  I though this was a great documentary that chronologically told the story of the radicals.  More the most part, the narrative is entirely from former members themselves.  I feel overall it was objective but I'm sure some changes were made for whatever reasons.  Still this film is very good and I highly recommend.

They interview many members including David Gilbert, who is currently incarcerated for activities after the Weather days.  There is a great short film the filmmakers made 5 years earlier that consists of a short interview with Gilbert from prison.  That is definitely worth your time.

2014128,4,B0001LYFKO,"Little wonder that this otherwise fascinating study of that long-ago radical group called the Weather Underground completely ignores the most notorious member of this white, rich clique: Kathy Boudin. During the filming of this project, Boudin was awaiting a parole hearing for her part in the murders of two beloved cops. The sympathetic film makers didn't want to jeopardize this psychopathic killer's chances of having her parole rejected. It wasn't. She served 22 years and owes her release to a claque of wealthy, white leftist attorneys and old activists. These were the same idiots who protected, sheltered and funded our fun-loving gang of bombers and psychos for more than decade. Other than that, you're treated to the underground as they were back in the 60s/70s and the way they are today. Nothing can hide the bald fact that this small group were composed of white, rich kids who took play acting to an extreme. They were greatly inspired by the youth riots in Europe at the time. The Vietnam War and the black activist movements also fed into the goals of such charismatic young college students as Mark Rudd, Bernardine Dorhn, Bill Ayers, Kathy Boudin and a few others. Bernardine looks good today although she hasn't changed her views very much. What's chilling is that several of these old radicals said they would do the same thing today if they had a chance and the events were propitious. Bill Ayers and Bernardine married and he's now a Distinguished Professor of English at a university. Yet, he suggests he hasn't changed all that much either from his glory days as a bomb thrower. He's shown now with a baseball bat, meandering along those streets where riots once reigned. In his memoirs, ""Fugitive Days,"" he comes across as basically an unsufferable airhead who misses the spotlight and whines about the sad plight of America and the poor blacks. The eeriest part of this movie is the long interview with one of the radicals who was arrested along with Kathy Boudin in the double-murder of the cops. David (?) is in prison for life for his part in this Black Panther planned robbery of a Brinks van. David acts as if he can barely suppress hysterical giggles. HIs mouth struggles to stay serious but occaionally, a looney grin takes over and he remembers intensely all the reasons why he became a ""revolutionary."" That's his name for all the misery he and his fellow terrorists called themselves for a short period in time. My college roommate back in the 60s had an apt name for the Weather Underground: The Marx Brothers of Terrorism. No one knew what they wanted, what their agenda was or why they were blowing up buildings and ""symbols"" across America. Bill Ayers proudly states today that ""no one was injured"" during these bombings. He forgets to add that several of the Weathermen  were blown up while making a bomb in a Greenwich Village townhouse that was to be exploded in a crowded area. And no one in this documentary mentions the actions of their own deadly Joan of Arc--Kathy Boudin--who just couldn't stay away from all that wonderful violence and mayhem.",1099353600,8,3095,4.828625235404896
2014129,5,B0001LYFKO,"At the end of the 1960's, the various student youth movements took a sharp turn toward the far left. Frustrated by their failures to halt America's involvement in the Vietnam War, a growing minority of student activist leaders whole-heartedly embraced Marxist dogma and began agitating for the overthrow of the United States government. There were a few niggling problems to attend to first, such as taking over the leadership of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), which they accomplished at the 1968 SDS national convention. An interesting thing to remember about extremists regardless of their political leanings is worth mentioning at this point: radicals can't get along with one another. Views and positions take on the rigidity of absolute, immutable truth, and anyone who opposes those views is the enemy--even if they're on your side to begin with. Thus SDS almost immediately disintegrated into squabbling factions of increasing irrelevancy. The most notable group to arise from the ashes of SDS were the Weathermen, an extreme far left organization devoted to bringing about a Marxist revolution in the United States. The name of the group, as you probably know if you're reading this, came from a Bob Dylan song.

The Weathermen, later known as the Weather Underground after the members went into hiding, utterly failed to achieve any of their objectives. Their first big action occurred in Chicago when the group launched their own version of Kristalnacht, called ""The Days of Rage."" The Weathermen and their associates roamed through the streets of Chicago, breaking windows, fighting with cops, and generally making a huge nuisance of themselves. Surprisingly, this little action failed to rouse the citizenry from their capitalist coma, a realization that seemed to shock this merry bunch of pranksters. Angered by this failure, the Weathermen decided to take up bomb making as a hobby. What followed were years of targeted bombings against such diverse targets as corporations, government institutions, universities, and other structures serving the ""enemies of the people."" The Weather Underground suffered setbacks, too, like the accidental detonation of a bomb that killed radicals Ted Gold, Diana Oughton, and Terry Robbins in a New York City townhouse on March 6, 1970. Still, the revolution must go on, so over the next several years the bombs continued to explode across the country as the Weather Underground continued to release written or tape recorded ""communiqus"" justifying their violent actions. By the early 1980s most of the members turned themselves into the authorities, exhausted from their years of living in hiding.

Why two paragraphs of tedious summary about an irrelevant political group long gone from the American landscape? Because this fascinating documentary, ""The Weather Underground,"" covers most of this material in minute detail through a collection of vintage news reports, documents, film footage, recreations, and interviews. Made a couple of years ago and aired widely on PBS, which is where I saw part of it and wanted more, the documentary revisits many of the principal players more than two decades after the group dissolved. We get to see and hear Billy Ayers, Bernadine Dohrn, Mark Rudd, Naomi Jaffe, David Gilbert, Brian Flanagan, and Laura Whitehorn reminisce about their days as revolutionary fighters battling for the soul of America. Moreover, interviews with former SDS leader Todd Gitlin, former Black Panther Kathleen Cleaver, and FBI agent Don Strickland provide a different point of view on the activities of the Weather Underground. By listening to these people recount their experiences, we learn more about how angry radicals became over the murder of Black Panther leader Fred Hampton, about how the group helped Timothy Leary escape from prison, and learn to marvel in awe at the massive comb over Mark Rudd sported as a young communist revolutionary.

It's not too difficult to see where the filmmakers' loyalties lie regarding the activities of the Weather Underground. Although careful not to make them look too cool, it's fairly obvious the presentation aims to present these characters as admirable figures. They placed a baseball bat in Billy Ayers's hands as he strolled down memory lane remembering the ""Days of Rage"" fiasco. While we could write off this stunt as sensationalism, it's more problematic to examine the questions put to the various members. Why did Kathy Boudin's name never come up in the film? Probably because Boudin, unlike many members we see here, did kill people in the name of a revolutionary cause. In the early 1980s, she joined the Black Liberation Army and took part in an armored car robbery that resulted in the deaths of two police officers and a security guard. The ghost of Boudin is apparently a problem the filmmakers wished to avoid, although I should credit them for interviewing David Gilbert, a man currently serving a life sentence for his involvement in the same crime. It just seems most of the questions don't dig too deeply into the questionable practices of the Weather revolution. Then again, maybe they don't need to; several of the former members appear as though they're having problems coming to terms with their past behavior. That's a hopeful sign.

Although I've had rough words in the past about these people and their despicable actions, I had a tough time disliking them in the film. A few of them, primarily Mark Rudd and Brian Flanagan, seem like people you could sit down with for a few hours and have an interesting conversation about any topic. The commentary track with Ayers and Dohrn is well worth a listen primarily for the realization that even stolid commies have a self-deprecating sense of humor. But you also discover that several of these people aren't quite ready to repudiate their former positions. I think it was Laura Whitehorn who said she would do it all over again if given the chance, a view that is hardly encouraging. Give this one a watch, though. It's mesmerizing.",1098489600,56,6035,5.161389172625127
2014130,4,B0001LYFKO,"This was a great film that allows the 70's protestor terrorists to reflect upon their actions in the full context of history.  This is a timely film considering the resurgence of the protestors who will claim to have the ""moral high ground"" while rationalizing everything to fit their own emotions and their emotions are anything but rational. Many of the members of the weather underground held the premise that the US is the source of all evil in the world and that a communist revolution was the key to more humane society, this ideology is still present in the so-called peace movements, this should be a history lesson to anyone who thinks that this idea is the answer to the ills of society. You would think that after they woke up from their bad trip they would have learned something but several members wished they could do it all over again, its obvious these people are in a time warp who base their ideals on emotion, infatuation with a revolution and hatred of the US more than on social justice and equality which is their so-called struggle.

Bill Siegel and Sam Green do a good job of piecing together the story and recreating the political climate which the Weathermen fed off.  The documentary is told in retrospect, with former Weathermen looking back at their radical student years, when they felt it was necessary to ""bring the war home,"" which became the anthem of the student movements.  Siegel and Green also show the reaction to the Weathermen at the time.  How they hijacked the SDS and were largely responsible for its demise before taking the movement underground.  They attempted to ally themselves with other radical political groups like the Black Panthers, but the Panthers wanted nothing to do with the Weathermen who they regarded as misguided fools.  But, the Weathermen were anything but foolish.  Their tactics were indeed misguided, but as Mark Rudd later notes the war can do crazy things to you.  It can f*ck with your mind.

2014132,5,B0001LYFKO,"I knew nothing about the Weather Underground before seeing this film.  I found this documentary to be very educational, from a historical point of view.  These people acted with violence, feeling as if it was their last resort to stop the evil that the US was perpetrating in South East Asia. Its easy to condemn them as radicals but the truth is uglier than even they knew, If you watch Fog of War and the movie about Henry Kissinger's war crimes, you can clearly see that our government actively lied and committed murder in our name, with our hard earned tax dollars.  The movie shows all the other avenues of pressure brought to our government: peaceful protests, angry protests, Nothing got through to our heads of state.  So bombs went off within our own country.  Its eerily similar to our current day lies about the war on Iraq and the huge marches for peace around our country today.  Again, politicians back the money, the corporations, the PACs.  As we ask our servicemen and women to re-up for more time in life-threatening war zones, we also tell them that we're not going to provide them with health insurance coverage when they are wounded.  The Weathermen were young, idealistic and saw things in black and white, no compromise.  See 'Monumental' and see the difference that can be made when one doesn't compromise - David Brower single-handedly preserved millions of acres of nature with Lady Bird Johnson's support, fighting against the money and power of huge corporations who were out for corporate profits.  The Weather Underground was one voice of that time and I think it is important to know their motives instead of simply dismissing them as radicals.  The US was built by radicals.  Is it radical to want to act with integrity, to speak out against racism, to stand up against our government when we are killing other humans?  I appreciated the sentiment of this movie and think it explains more fully the complexity of life back in the 60's.  We're seeing it happen again...  this time around, can we as a country provide options so that protests don't escalate to violence?  Or are we again going to reject any informed dissent, leaving the door open for alternate forms of communication like the violent bombs of the Weather Underground?",1096761600,5,2266,4.801546391752577
2014133,3,B0001LYFKO,"I'd like to begin by stating that this is technically an excellent documentary.  It is skillfully made and tough to take your eyes off of.  It's not a pretty story, however.  This group had a comical, no, make that infantile, understanding of United States history.  Furthermore, they were racist to the core.  Their racism was mostly evident through their aversion to all things Caucasian but it was also discernible through their treatment of black Americans who were regarded as pawns that these poseurs believed could be manipulated.  The Weatherman interviewed in the film disguise their own youthful and narcissistic fantasies for power and attention with a supposedly altruistic desire to stop the Vietnam Conflict.  What's wrong with our nation today?  It all begins with self-obsessed me generation types like these.  It's ironic that they did so little time and received so little punishment for their heinous acts.  What is a better indicator of how tolerant and compassionate our society is than that so many of them are able to walk our streets and cities today?  The Weathermen were best referred in the movie as attempting a children's crusade gone mad.  That's an excellent summation of their ideology.

The film is well done. I feel the Todd Gitlin, Mark Rudd and Brian Flannagan were the more realistic people on this DVD. Clearly they had come to see that the Weather Underground's methods were not ultimately the most effective and said so. They also saw the orgies as self indulgent and stupid.
In the end, all would truly admire a man of peaceful protest like the late David Dellinger for his methods as his were better than their methods.
This film should be seen as a great period piece. It should also be seen to affirm that violence wasn't the answer then and it isn't in Iraq now.

2014137,2,B0001LYFKO,"In the film there is only one voice that speaks for the legitimate left--Todd Gitlin, who articulates well just how counter-revolutionary (in terms of effect) these brats were. What they didn't seem to understand was that the real revolution had already taken place, and it was lead peacefully by people like Martin Luther King and Ralph Abernathy and by their heroes in the Black Panthers.
The main thing that sticks in my craw about this documentary is that it leaves out some of the more disturbing statements and deeds by weather underground members--e.g., Bernardine Dohrn's commentary on the Manson killings.
At a 1969 ""War Council"" to launch the WU, Dohrn gave a three fingered ""fork salute"" to Charles Manson, whom she apparently regarded as some sort of revolutionary inspiration. She then  made jokes about Manson's victims and dubbed them the ""Tate Eight"" after Sharon Tate, the pregnant actress whom members of the Manson tribe stabbed in the womb with a fork. ""Dig it,"" said Dohrn at the time. ""First they killed those pigs, then they ate dinner in the same room with them, they even shoved a fork into a victim's stomach! Wild!""
That the producers would omit such a revealing (and yet horrifying) statement by one of the main subjects of the film does lead one to question their motives, especially when the producers do spend some time on the Manson killings and even include gruesome footage of Manson's victims. Perhaps Dohrn refused to appear on film if the producers brought it up. I don't know. Imagine what a post-revolutionary world led by this broad might have looked like. Well in 1969 I'm guessing none of them had the time to read Robert Conquest's just-published ""The Great Terror"".
At any rate, Dohrn is now comfortably ensconsed at Northwestern University School of Law, one of the most privileged places in this society she despises, where I am sure she inspires her young students with all her good works.

Much more interesting to me was Brian Flanagan who seems to be the only one (with the possible exception of Rudd) who truly appreciates the folly of his past and has become an actual grown-up. Maybe it has something to do with running a business (Flanagan now owns a bar).

2014138,4,B0001LYFKO,"In some ways, the group known as the Weather Underground (originally the Weathermen, an offshoot of Students for a Democratic Society) were more a symbol of 1960s radical idealism than a real revolutionary movement. Although they planted many bombs during a decade-long period, they never did anything that seriously threatened the government or power structure. Their goal, of course, was to spark a mass movement and inspire others to follow their example, but they remained essentially marginalized. The film, The Weather Underground does a good job at letting members of this group explain their motives and, in some cases, misgivings about their foray into revolution. Directors Bill Siegel and Sam Green seem to be sympathetic with the movement, and most of the material is told from the point of view of members. Leaders of the group Bernardine Dohrn and Bill Ayers have retained their radical views and are anything but apologetic about their past actions.
Most members of the group, despite the bombings, were committed to not harming people. This brings up a rather blatant omission in the film -Kathy Boudin, perhaps the group's most notorious member (for her participation in a robbery where a man was killed) is not mentioned at all. This was an unfortunate decision, apparently done to portray the Weathermen as essentially nonviolent. To leave out such a well known chapter in the group's history leaves a gaping hole. Still, the parts that are included are fascinating and give a glimpse into the idealism and naivete of these leftist radicals.
In retrospect, it is (at least from one perspective) a little sad to see how little long term effect the 1960s counterculture had on society. It seems that they were no match for the propaganda machine of the government and mass media. This film, of course, employs propaganda methods of its own, as when brutal footage from the Vietnam war is shown. Propaganda it may be, but it does serve to almost trivialize the violence committed by the Weathermen compared with that perpetrated by the government it was opposing. The other side to this argument is that the fact that these radicals are still alive and that a film like this has been allowed to be made is proof that America is not as oppressive as some would have us believe. Yet, this is only true to some extent; as the film explains, the FBI made a concerted (and mainly illegal) effort to destroy radical movements. There is also evidence that the government murdered members of the Black Panthers.
How you react to The Weather Underground depends on your political and cultural perspective. Regardless of this, this film is a compelling study of a radical group and gives us a glimpse into their world.",1087084800,52,2724,4.949781659388647
2014139,5,B0001LYFKO,"Shocking, engrossing, enlightening and ultimately heartbreaking, ""The Weather* Underground"" is a new documentary that should probably be seen by just about anybody who doesn't know its story and is at all interested in America and its past, present and future.
The movie is a brief history of the Weathermen, a radical group of anti-war, anti-racism protesters who, in the 1960s, splintered off from the Students for a Democratic Society and, as the Vietnam War grew and grew, became more and more aggressive in its tactics.
I knew a little about the group beforehand but had no idea that, for example, its members once bombed the U.S. Capitol. They also set off explosives at a New York City police headquarters, the Presidio in San Francisco, a Queens courthouse, a National Guard headquarters and at an office of the New York Department of Corrections, among other targets.
These actions are shocking and wrong in and of themselves, but in a post-9/11 environment, they take on an even larger sense of menace. But it's to the movie's credit that it's able to present these situations in a historical context without supporting or completely condemning the young people involved. Sam Green, with co-director Bill Siegel, strongly object to the methods of the Weathermen but are obviously and understandably sympathetic to the opinions and despair that motivated them.
""Every second, from 1965 to 1975, I was always aware that our country was attacking Vietnam,"" says former Weatherman Mark Rudd. ""Our country was killing millions of people in Vietnam . . . This revelation was more than we could handle. We didn't know what to do about it.""
Later, he adds, ""I helped found an organization whose goal was the violent overthrow of the government of the United States.""

Says Brian Flanagan, another ex-Weatherman (who, incidentally, once won $23,000 on ""Jeopardy!""), ""When you feel you have right on your side, you can do some horrific things.""
Somehow, Green and Siegel managed to find and interview many of the other key participants, and the stark contrast between the Weathermen today and their old mug shots is striking -- some have rethought their actions while some seem just as committed now as then. But the tragic figures of the movie aren't just a group of young people whose enthusiasm and outrage led them astray, nor are they those that the group lashed out against, but everybody involved. ""The Weather Underground"" is a sad snapshot of a time that still resonates today.
The commentary by director Green is an extremely well-done track. Green is very adept at opening up the movie and explaining things that the film itself doesn't have time to go into detail about.",1086912000,9,2682,5.0
2014140,5,B0001LYFKO,"""Every generation needs a new revolution.""  --Thomas Jefferson
As a twentysomething, this film made me really wish I had lived during the 60s, a time of change when anything seemed possible.  After decades of protest, the student left came to realize that their words were less than meaningless: the Nixon-led government did whatever it wished, from the My Lai massacre to Kent State to Watergate, and the people were powerless.  Faced with this dilemma, the left had a choice: continue the useless verbiage, or ""bring the war home?""
The answer to this question is not an easy one.  This film doesn't take sides, and shows the conflicting feelings of the Weathermen today.  Of course, most people are fully indoctrinated into the U.S. ideological state apparatus and would be outraged by the suggestion that the people should exercise violent power.  They would justify the outrageous tactics of Cointelpro in the name of Order, much like the fat, repulsive FBI narc does in this film.
Undoubtedly, when your government commits atrocities across the globe, the safest course of action is to be a timid, bleating sheep.  The Weathermen sought to awaken the sheep, but underestimated the apathy and docility of the American public.  At any rate, acts of terrorism only drive the sheep away in a stampede, not towards you.  The Weathermen probably helped the troglodytic Nixon, much like al-Qaeda has greatly helped Dubya.
I, for one, wish I lived in a generation that had its own revolution.

2014141,4,B0001LYFKO,"A good reason to buy this DVD is that the two commentaries - the director's and that of two of the principals - taken together with the film itself makes a far more provocative body of work than is offered by the film alone. The latter is the work of a Gen-Xer who exhibits the best and the worst of his cohorts. His curiousity is there - I am grateful that he had the patience and perserverence to get these people in front of the camera - and his heart is there, too - there is some kind of great fondness for his subject. But instead of committing that heart to the subject, he backs off and decides that he only loves ""the images,"" the sights and sounds, the graininess of the old footage or the lilt of the narrator's voice. In the end I felt that he did not give the (former?) members of the Weather Underground their full say or due.
Perhaps it is simply not possible to do so in these times or via that medium. Perhaps the central thesis of these activists - that to do nothing is worse than to do something, almost anything, when faced with multilayered deceit and brutality - is somehow no longer meaningful to the citizens of this country. I used to hear such arguments regularly through the 80s (remember ""silence = death"" and ""no compromise in defense of mother earth""?) - what happened? (I too am a Gen-Xer - and appreciated the director's inclusion of an image of Reagan and all that that implied about the future of the Weathermens' battle!)
A few striking points:
This particular movement was simply incredibly successful. I wonder why they would even be considered controversial, particularly. They limited themselves to property destruction. They communicated clearly. They didn't get caught. There is actually a long and widespread tradition of this. Perhaps that tradition has gone into such abeyance at this point, in this country, that people could watch this film (and the director could direct this film) with the idea that these actions are controversial. Of course they are illegal. But at an ethical level, controversial?  While we blithely accept the casualties of so many state-sponsored actions as uncontroversial - as ""neccessary""? At the same time, it was  important to hear the activists reflect on their work with a good sense of self-criticism.
Back to the director:(...) there was a lot of footage that was just all about the director enjoying his own aesthetic. This could have been a slightly more serious documentary. And as for winning awards, that could only be because of the content; there was nothing really outstanding or original in his formal choices. I do hope he continues in this vein, however.
Last, a question. I was left wondering how much of the Weather Underground's activity was motivated particularly by the Vietnam War and by Black activism, as the film strongly contextualizes the movement, and how much by a devotion to something even larger - I have in mind Communist longings and theory - which I caught whiffs of throughout the film but which was never really fleshed out.

I was very pleased to see a full-length, in-depth interview with David Gilbert from Attica Prison, as well as a very frank discussion about the accidental explosion of a homemade bomb in the NYC Brownstone apartment of several members of the SDS and the Weather Underground, which killed 3 members who lived and/or worked inside. The most interesting discussions in this film, to me, were those of all of the major players of the Weather Underground regarding their revelations as they look back on what they did, why they did it, and whether they would do it all over again; the resounding answer from all of them being ""Yes, we'd do it again"", almost in unison. There is a visible irony that makes itself apparent right from the beginning of this documentary, from the very first interview, and that lays apparent throughout until the credits role, as with the exception of Gilbert, who has been serving a life-sentence in state prison since 1985 for his later participation in the actions of the Black Liberation Army after the disbandment of the Weather Underground, the rest of the former leaders and major players of the Weather Underground have since, for the most part all settled down, gotten married and had children, gotten graduate degrees, law degrees, and doctorates, and though many of them still participate in local ""activist"" groups of one nature or another, they've all pretty much become exactly what they were striving to eliminate: the white middle to upper-middle class Americans, living very comfortably and conforming to society as a whole.",1522540800,,1985,4.928358208955224
