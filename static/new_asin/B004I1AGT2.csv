Action is lame and just looks bad
Acting is lame and just looks bad
quality is lame and just looks bad
Blood looks fake and not dramatic or appealing
Nudity is lame in this one

just don't watch it, not a single good thing about it.",1348185600,,307,4.1
4381536,4,B004I1AGT2,"Can't add much to the positive reviews previously stated.
This stylish Japanese (Vampire) Noir held up rather well, considering that
they didn't have a huge budget to work with.  What struck me the most was the character of
Brigette - considering her position/character in the movie - she had the most soul of all (look at her eyes -
you'll see what I mean)!

Finally, the time just flew by (this movie was 'short' - in my view).  But I liked it all the same!
See it (and decide) for yourself!

I rate 'Blood'...4 stars!",1309737600,,520,4.442105263157894
4381537,4,B004I1AGT2,"Not a bad movie it is still nice to watch either read the words or learn Japaneses.
the swordplay is great, and there are no but's. a good more the draw out parts are still good.",1305504000,,178,3.9722222222222223
4381538,4,B004I1AGT2,"Most people are familiar with the Anne Rice version of what a vampire is, or more recently, ""Underworld.""  This is not that kind of vampire movie.  While it does rely heavily on very seductive qualities, the story itself keeps you into the movie for the duration.  That being said, this is a very adult movie...at times, seeming like a Japanese Vampire Softcore.  The lead actress, Aya Sugimoto, is (pardon the phrase) drop-dead gorgeous! And she plays her role extremely convincingly. The male leads are shared by two equally handsome men that look as if they could have been plucked straight from an anime series.

The story and pace of ""Blood"" is very even throughout. But there were times when I was hoping for some more history and details that link the Edo period to present day, and regarding where Miyako (Sugimoto) came from, or how she came to be the vampire/temptress that consumes her existence (as far as the film is concerned, she just ""is"").  Treating this as a comparison to any other vampire film would be a mistake.  This movie takes on a fairly emotional love story more than horror or thriller.  I say that kind of tongue-in-cheek the way that ""House of Flying Daggers"" is a love story.  You do FEEL for all the characters, but when the action scenes take place, the emotions feel slightly jarred and put on pause.  All things considered though, it is an exceptional love triangle that one can assume will only end in despair.  I would have given this movie 4.5 stars but the blood used in the movie looked more like water with red food coloring in it.  Half-star deduction on a technicality :-/.

Overall, this is a good movie that puts a different spin on an old folklore.  There are plenty of tales regarding the supernatural side of Japanese culture, but few make it to film.  The sheer beauty and passion alone would make it a love story worth watching.  But the action and vampire element make it that much more appealing.",1304899200,8,1948,4.652046783625731
4381539,4,B004I1AGT2,"A police detective finds himself running with creatures of the night while investigating a gruesome murder. Detective Hoshino questions the former employer of a slain maid's unsolved murder, an ethereal seductress named Miyako Rozmberk (Aya Sugimoto), in hopes of landing a solid lead before the statute of limitations runs out. Miyako takes an interest in the detective, this due to a unique quality present in his blood which only a few possess, so she feeds him clues as to who the murderer is. When Miyako's tip leads Detective Hoshino to Ukyo Kuronuma, a ruthless yakuza overlord, the fact that Ukyo is found attempting to feast on a terrified, bound, naked young girl would indicate that he was indeed the killer. But shortly after learning that Ukyo is in fact the famed shogunate-era swordsman Okita, who has been transformed into a vampire by the powerful and ageless Miyako, Detective Hoshino, too becomes born-again (and not in a Christian sense) as a deathless bloodsucker, again thanks to Miyako. As history would have it, she and Ukyo are former lovers,but his propensity for violence and cruelty were too much for her refined elegance. Later, when Miyako's loyal female servant wages a vicious fight to remain her one and only companion, Detective Hoshino realizes that even in death, the struggle for survival never ceases. And sometimes, depending on the individual, isn't even worth the effort...

A cross between 'Versus', 'Shinobi' and 'Countess Dracula', this little flick has much going for it - action, blood, vamps, yakuzas, swordplay, nudity, a seductive yet visceral style, and the gorgeous Aya Sugimoto ('Flower and Snake', 'Flower and Snake 2') who gets more beautiful as she ages, much like her character here. Though nothing complex, it's an enjoyable ride and worth investigating if you're into any of the items mentioned above. Hell, its head and shoulders better than any of that 'Twilight' tripe, I assure you. It's in Japanese with English subtitles, which will avert a segment of potential viewers like a crucifix would a vampire, but it's not too wordy so those challenged by a basic requisite like reading shouldn't be put off, it's worth the effort. (I'm not railing against anybody here when I say this, but all too often, people ask me if a movie's dubbed or not, and won't consider watching if it's subtitled. You tend to cut yourself off from things you'd otherwise enjoy by doing this, IMHO.). Sink your teeth into this one and you just might draw some 'Blood'.",1301356800,13,2505,5.0071942446043165
8429810,4,B004I1AGT2,"Interesting take on vampire movies. But it is more of a movie about a broken romance than about vampires, something which is discovered at the end of the movie, but implied earlier. There are a few martial arts scenes, some nudity and some sexuality. There are some references that you might miss if you are not familiar with Japanese culture. Perhaps not as good as my rating suggests, I was so inspired by the way they portrayed vampires that I actually purchased the movie.",1451001600,,476,4.678571428571429
8429811,3,B004I1AGT2,"Blood, not to be confused with the other Asian vampire film titled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blood/dp/B002KX9COU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blood</a>, was released as ""Buraddo"" before English subtitles were added for rerelease. Not surprisingly, Blood has several instances of ""WTF?"" if you are not accustomed to Japanese film; really, that's the saving grace for Blood, since it doesn't have much to offer otherwise.

Although not rare, it's uncommon for the oldest vampire in a film to be female. That's the case here, and the matriarch not only sires both the protagonist and the antagonist, she also goes steady with them afterwards (creating a doomed love triangle). And who plays this matriarch? Aya Sugimoto, now 46, who was a Japanese pop icon and sex symbol. The acting in Blood is passable; the fella who plays the bad guy here has been in a ton of Japanese TV shows. The plot is reasonable, but plods along in places; I found the sex scenes boring, but if vampire erotica is your thing, then Blood might hit the spot for you.

As for what sets Blood apart from most other vampire films: well, many of these qualities are subtle and difficult to put into words. One that's easy to describe: a female Neo suddenly materializes into a scene -- complete with Matrix trench coat -- for a bit of kung fu/wire fu action (this was one of the WTF moments). She, my favorite character in Blood, wasn't even a vampire.

 Final Verdict  A vampire detective: where have I seen this before? While not exceedingly original, it is at least creative in some areas. Be prepared for a couple Aya Sugimoto sex scenes and some weirdness.",1432252800,2,1676,5.08
8429812,3,B004I1AGT2,"Mostly bought this for Aya Sugimoto. She is still great looking, but not enough of her. The movie is good but not memorable.",1412121600,,124,4.434782608695652

8429814,4,B004I1AGT2,"One thing that can be said about the Japanese is they know how to do Vampires. Even though the Vampire genre has been done to death this film was quite entertaining. What makes it good is the character's story makes it easy to relate to them. Though admittedly the plot dives into things a bit quickly and is some what cliche still if you want blood, honor, and romance this movie is thee movie for you.",1402272000,,403,4.315789473684211

8429816,4,B004I1AGT2,"Blood manages to blend a detective story with a vampire story. Hoshino is following up on a cold case before the statutes run out. He meets Miyako, a wealthy recluse (and vampire) who puts him on the trail of a killer- Uyko, a centuries old samurai vampire that was turned by Miyako. Aya Sugimoto plays Miyako and she plays her as a someone that does what she wants as well as needs. She turns Hoshino not because she has to but because he has the special blood type to survive the change. Why? For companionship and his devotion to duty. Saionji (Ukyo's real name) may kill for his survival but is still a samurai at heart. Hoshino realizes that his new existence now lies beyond mortal moral perspectives. His final choice will surprise viewers and leaves some questions at the end.",1384387200,,784,4.567375886524823

'Blood' doesn't make the 'Great' category, or even the 'Good' category,  however it's not to bad to sneak downstairs and purloin the disc and pop it in to watch in darkness of the den/family room/wherever . . . what is that?
