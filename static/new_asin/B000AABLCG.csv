I just wish that all the original episodes were put onto the DVD but some are missing. It isn't just the DVD's on Amazon that are missing them though - no website (that I could find) has all episodes.",1168560000,4,345,4.3076923076923075

If you imagine what new immigrants who do not speak English go through to learn the language, and the 'confusion that goes on in their heads', you will find the Mind Your Language Series educative and wholesomely entertaining",1173312000,2,256,4.976744186046512
