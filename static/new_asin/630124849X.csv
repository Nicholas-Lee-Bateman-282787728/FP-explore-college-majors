321381,5,630124849X,"While the movie is not A-level, the Cajun environment is interesting/different (the swamp setting, language, music), the story entertaining (though not always pleasant); but the most special aspect of this movie for me is beautiful actress Jan MacKenzie!",1171152000,13,254,5.7105263157894735

It's a really boring movie that makes you laugh at how stupid it is for the first five minutes, but then just makes you either bored or uncomfortable.  The multiple rapings were extremely disturbing and gross.  The end is kinda funny but it doesn't make up for how horrid the rest of it is.  Despite the fact that Jan Mackenzie is a total hottie, its an awful, awful film.",1020643200,4,522,4.128712871287129

321636,2,630124849X,"This is a review of the DVD version of Gator Bait 2: Cajun Justice. To make a long story short, this is a 3-star movie with a 1-star transfer to DVD.  The movie is okay, with a fairly straightforward rape and revenge storyline with an attractive female lead, but the DVD transfer is just horrible with artifacts everwhere.  If you liked the movie on VHS, you will be mad at spending money to get this DVD which looks horrible.

Gator Bait 2: Cajun Justice is not really much of a sequel to the original Gator Bait.  Jan MacKenzie plays a city girl who marries a Cajun guy so they can go live in the Bayou.  A bunch of inbred-types kidnap her after she takes a bath, torment and eventually gang rape her.  She escapes and then takes revenge on them.  End of story.  Like I said, a fairly straightforward storyline, made more watchable by the charms of Jan MacKenzie who plays sexy and vulnerable very well in this story.

So, you'd expect the DVD to be much, much better than the VHS version in which the movie was originally released.  It's not.  Not only are there no extras but the transfer itself is just poor.  I can't help but feel that if I simply did my own transfer from LaserDisc (I own the LaserDisc version) to digital that it would be a lot better than this DVD.  About the only reason to buy the DVD version is so you can put the VHS machine away.  Just don't expect it to look any better (and indeed it often looks worse) than watching it on VHS.",1422748800,6,1460,4.281021897810219

7810448,1,630124849X,"Stay away. I bought this after watching the first one which I enjoyed. This was a long, drawn out, horrible movie. The entire first part of the film I felt was just filler with horrible back ground music. My main problem with this movie is that it portrays itself as a strong action revenge movie which I do not feel is the case. This movie runs about 1:39 & there was no type of revenge action unitl about 1:11 into the film. With all the ""dramatic"" build up during the last portion of the film, there was very little action within the last 28 minutes in the film.

I suggest sticking with Part 1 only then finding something else. If you are really into seeing Jan MacKenzie use the internet & save some money.",1476057600,,711,4.3059701492537314

I know some disliked this couple for the same reasons I enjoyed them so who is to say.  Know that when you watch this type of movie you have to appreciate revenge, genre, camp and cheese films to fully appreciate this.
