8281441,5,B001B1Q394,"This disc features 4 episodes from the 2001/2004 animated series Timothy Goes to School, based on the book series by Rosemary Wells (this means it lasts about an hour ). Episode titles are The Friend Ship, Team Project, Paint by Numbers, and Many Happy Returns. As a bonus, the disc will play automatically so your little one doesn't have to operate the DVD player. This release plays in English or French since this show was big in Canada. The title episode, in which a new member of the kindergarten class is introduced and learns to make new friends, seems especially useful to quiet children.",1487462400,,596,4.740384615384615
