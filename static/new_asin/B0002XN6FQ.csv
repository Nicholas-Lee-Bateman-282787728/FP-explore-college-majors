8034215,3,B0002XN6FQ,This DVD is ok...it is really outdated and the information is hard to follow. I would highly recommend investing in Dena Kirkpatrick's DVD series instead. They have the same idea but Dena does a better job of explaining what she is doing and why she is doing it.,1303084800,,262,4.479166666666667
8034216,5,B0002XN6FQ,"Although I am a natural trainer, I didn't buy this DVD but for the patterns they use to keep the horse interested and not get burned out.  Very impressed with the mother and daughter team and how these patterns keep their horses focused! Highly recommend.",1256515200,,255,4.666666666666667
8034217,5,B0002XN6FQ,This might not be as in depth as some people want but I did learn quit a bit from this video. I'm glad I bought it. We have already made some changes on our horses that they suggested and wow. Thanks for some great tips.,1255305600,,220,3.911111111111111
