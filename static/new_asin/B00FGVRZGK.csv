8615685,3,B00FGVRZGK,"Not in Japanese language as is listed on web site, we are trying to get these in Japanese for learning the language in a fun way. It would be better to buy the season 2 box set if you want this season in English. Good if you want to buy single episodes and do not care for the whole series. We like the whole series. We wanted this season 2  series in Japanese, not finding it here. We like Digimon.",1460592000,,399,3.9875
8615686,5,B00FGVRZGK,Always been a big fan of Digimon.  Purchased the set for my children and have watched them countless of times!,1449273600,,110,4.5
8615687,5,B00FGVRZGK,"Has episodes 22 to 37 all in great quality, my only complaint, is that there is no SDH or closed captions available. Still a great set for a great show",1445904000,,151,4.066666666666666

8615689,2,B00FGVRZGK,"So I didn't buy this here, but my copy of this Season 2 Volume 5 dvd has a defect on the screen around the part where Davis is running away from Veemon in the first episode on disc 1. I am really upset about this because it is in one of my favorite parts in the series, and also because I paid all that money and expect it to remain the way it was originally broadcast. Anyway the rest seem to be okay as for the discs themselves they almost look warped! Be careful when you buy these, am I going to try getting it from Amazon probably! I'm just warning you of what to look out for should you buy this! If an animation defect does not bother you then go ahead and buy it! Anyway I bought season 1 Volume 3 here and it had no problem so maybe it's where I got it from! If anyone else encounters this problem please let me know! The 2 stars are more about the dvds and defect then the show itself!",1390089600,,895,3.9502762430939224
