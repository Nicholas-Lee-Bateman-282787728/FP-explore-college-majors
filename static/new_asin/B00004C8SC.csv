7920341,5,B00004C8SC,"An absolute must have for any aviation or Boeing 777 enthusiast! This documentary tells the entire story of the development of the plane now known the world over as the Boeing 777! The viewer will learn the aspects of the commercial aviation industry and the fierce clashes between Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and Airbus for their shares in the commercial plane market in the 1980's and 1990's. The series also explains the stakes that are placed when developing a new plane for the worlds airlines and the plight of the worlds airlines and many other factors that drove Boeing to develop the Boeing 777 and the decision to have Boeing bet it's future on this one plane. I can promise that the viewer will learn a lot and overall enjoy the documentary! Again, a must have!",1485302400,,770,4.711111111111111
7920342,5,B00004C8SC,"I bought this as a replacement for my worn-out VHS copy, and it's complete and reduced in size from five cassettes to three discs; the case is a little awkward to manage.",1453507200,,170,4.34375
7920343,5,B00004C8SC,"This is a three disc set with five episodes, same as the VHS set.  It was a KCTS Seattle direct issue through the Channel 9 Store. It may have been available at Boeing gift shops also. The case is twice the thickness needed, as each disc has it's own folder tray.",1421020800,,263,4.1568627450980395
7920344,4,B00004C8SC,"This story follows the design and building, right through to delivery, of the new 777 plane from Boeing.  Just the thought of the logistics of what it takes to achieve this feat is monumental.  the documentary goes one step further; you become ""familiar"" with some of the key personnel involved.

The shear scale of the parts, factories, number of people, travel, etc make for many points tto pondeer.  I originally saw most of this on PBS and wish they had included the later 6th part with a different tione and commentary but the 5 parts do nicely.",1142035200,5,550,4.639175257731959
7920345,5,B00004C8SC,"Though the Boeing 777 has been in serivce for several years, the lessons from its development that focus on organizational effectiveness are highly applicable to today's team based situations. This story is another example of the timelessness of sound experiences. This series of episodes is well worth investing the time to experience.",1138406400,5,336,5.480769230769231

Sitting through the full length of this documentary only heightened my appreciation for these dignified beasts of burden. The series covers the full scope of all that goes into making a commercial airline jet a successful reality. The exchange of ideas concerning what would be built and how, the first sketches and how they evolve, the number of teams, people and their respective roles within Boeing as well as independent contracting firms from all around the globe and their employees.

I found every minute of this documentary fascinating. It's so interesting to hear the discussions that take place among the decision-makers, the technical people, i.e. engineers,  scientists & pilots as well as seasoned skilled laborers. You will find it incredible to see how massive parts of a jet are designed and built half way around the world to within fractions of a centimeter! If the size or shape of the part is off by just that much it has to be done all over costing enormous sums of money and time from the schedule allowed to complete construction.

If you enjoy the science behind commercial aircrafts and wonder how these marvelous planes weighing hundreds of thousands of pounds get up in the air and stay there for hours on end while all of its separate components and systems work simultaneously without a hitch, you will most definitely enjoy this series. It is very thorough and easy to follow. The narrator explains conversations that seem too technical or otherwise complicated for some of us. That sure helped me to get the most out of it. For young folks considering aviation as a career, this is a priceless form of background education.",1123977600,13,1814,4.84516129032258
7920347,5,B00004C8SC,"This series of tapes chronicles with great detail the development, construction, marketing, first flight, and delivery of a grand technological achievement: The Boeing 777 widebodied jet airliner.
The ""Triple-Seven"" is the largest twin-engined aircraft ever produced, with an overall length of 209.1 feet and a wingspan measuring 199.9 feet (for the initial model built, the B777-200).  The tail rises more than six stories into the sky (60.4 feet). The enormous engines, one tucked under each of the massive wings, are incredibly efficient and reliable, with very close to a Zero Per Cent failure rate to this day (and that's a TON of flight hours!).  These tremendous power plants are as wide as the ENTIRE fuselage section of a Boeing 737 jetliner!
Many tidbits of interesting information (similar to what I relayed above) can be heard and seen on this set of VHS videos, along with a ""live"" look at the 777's maiden flight on Sunday, June 12, 1994.  The aircraft's first flight shared headlines that day with another major U.S. story. The other big story that day was not nearly as celebratory as the Triple-Seven's maiden trip in Seattle.  Two states south, in California, came the news, also on June 12th, that O.J. Simpson's ex-wife and friend had been murdered late that night.
United Airlines became the ""launch"" customer for Boeing's greatest twin-jet, first flying the big craft in revenue service in 1995.  United's fleet of 777s would soon grow to more than fifty of the aircraft.
Just about anything you could want to know about this airplane is contained within this 5-part program, with interviews with several of the key developers and 777 Program management personnel. Impressive footage of the aircraft in flight (and on the ground during many tests) is also included on the videos.
For those interested, the Boeing 777 family has grown since 1994's first flight to include the B777-200ER (Extended Range), the B777-200LR (Long Range), the ""stretched"" B777-300 (242 feet in length!), and the newest variant in the family -- the Boeing 777-300ER.
The 777-300ER, according to Boeing's website, has a per-plane cost (as of 2002) of up to 231.5 million (U.S.) dollars, Boeing's most expensive aircraft!  So, if you're thinking of picking up a couple as gifts some day, you'd better start saving a few greenbacks now.  :)
The ""Triple-Seven"" is an incredible flying machine. And there's no better way to get up close and personal with her than to pop in this set of video tapes.",1068249600,4,2491,5.016949152542373
7920348,5,B00004C8SC,"21st Century Jet is an exciting look at the complexities of modern product development.  It is highly illustrative of the very latest concepts of systems engineering, integrated product and process teaming, logistical considerations, and customer satisfaction.  The documentary is applicable to virtually any category of complex systems -- from freeway overpasses, to automotive advances, to children's toys.  A must-view for today's managers of engineering design efforts.",978134400,5,473,6.136363636363637
