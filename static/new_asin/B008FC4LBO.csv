8527272,4,B008FC4LBO,"This workout starts with a short cardio warm-up doing marching, side steps etc. After that, it is all toning after that.  This workout is divided into two sections: a series of 10 moves using the band and then a section with the same 10 moves (sort of) combining the band with weights. I say it's ""sort of"" the same moves because during the second set with weights, she gives intensity and balance options she doesn't give in the first section.  So, they are not EXACTLY the same.

There are two background exercisers behind Ellen.  One gives easier modifications does the same move as Ellen.  They are both miked, which is okay except that one of them didn't seem to understand mirror cueing and after awhile, they're comments sound really scripted.  Ellen is her usual natural self and the talk is all about form pointers and health and encouragement.

This workout is a keeper for me because:

1.  I love, love, love band workouts and like the feeling of using both the band and weights at the same time.

2.  I enjoy more athletic Ellen workouts and this one is no excpetion.

3.  With it being as repetitive as it is, it's a great workout for a brain dead morning (I work out before work.)

If you wouldn't have any of those reasons for liking it, then it might not be for you.",1429488000,2,1282,4.469827586206897

8527275,5,B008FC4LBO,Seemed like a very low intensity workout. Then she added weight in the 2nd section and I found myself getting tired. Good combination of bands and weights.,1361145600,6,155,4.777777777777778
