2443346,5,B000BVM1SW,"One of the funnies UK sitcoms of recent years finally hits the US. Absolutely brilliant. Anyone who's a fan of other quirky British comedies like Alan Partridge, or The Office should find this right up there street.",1138838400,11,215,4.837837837837838
2443347,5,B000BVM1SW,"Run, RUN I tell you, don't walk to find a copy of this series! This is one of the most unbelievably funny shows I've ever seen.

All three actors are hysterical, and Dylan Moran is adorable in a way that only a belligerent, drunken Irishman who owns a bookstore can be.

I cannot wait for the rest of the series to be released here.",1138579200,2,332,4.171875
2443348,5,B000BVM1SW,"Bernard Black is the Basil Fawlty of the book-selling world, but with an Irish accent, and a non-stop affair with the grape and tobacco.  With Manny Bianco filling in for Manuel and Polly, and Fran as a neurotic Sybil, the only thing missing is a similar group of stock customers/boarders.  But who needs them when there's a continuing line of normal, but exceedingly out-of-place, book buyers who continue to visit the shop with the impossible dream of buying the book they were foolish enough to think they wanted to.

The best thing about the shows is that even when the plots take a seemingly predictible path, there's always a troll under the bridges along the way; from Missonaries learning about the Bible from a work-avoiding Bernard; to a Fran auditioning her new dress, and 'turn with a laugh', on Bernard; to a Manny who's just stayed up all night with his birthday presents, an espresso machine and a detective novel series.

It'll be a shame if the whole (as of now) three series don't appear in the US because most of us would just have to make do with grainy digitized vcr recordings which do no justice to Bernard in a skirt, returning from a three week vacation (after spending all but 4 hours on connecting flights), Fran doing yoga while still polluting her chakras with chocolate and peas, and Manny suffering from Dave's Syndrome, with the thermometer approaching the upper 80's.",1131408000,7,1400,4.7727272727272725
2443349,5,B000BVM1SW,"Series 1 finally comes to region 1!-

This show is smart, funny, and as you are watching the chemistry with all 3 characters are perfect. What is really great about it, is that it keeps you guessing to the very end and just when you think of how each episode will end- it fools you to what you did  not expect.

2443351,5,B000BVM1SW,"This series showed briefly on BBC America earlier this year. I caught only a few episodes before it disappeared. This thing is hilarious, and Dylan Moran, who plays the main character, is brilliant. He is a very funny man.

This show is about the bookshop I hope to run someday, once I hit the lotto and no longer have to worry about money - maybe there are customers, maybe there aren't. Maybe you're nice to them - most likely you can't be bothered. Inventory? The books you yourself like to read. And accounting? Chah, add it to the pile, get to it after I drink this lovely merlot.

Sounds perfect.

Dylan plays a chain-smoking, heavy drinking bookshop owner who doesn't like people and hates customers worst of all. He's harsh and funny - and a bit of a train wreck.

The stories, at time, border on the surreal.

Very well worth watching. I hope they release seasons 1-3 (what, all of 18 episodes) over here - they're already available in the UK, but wrong format!",1123804800,7,970,4.52

2443392,5,B000BVM1SW,"Somewhere in London, there is a tiny indie bookstore run by the rudest and most misanthropic Irishman since Father Jack Hackett.

Nobody in their right mind would actually shop at Black Books. But watching it? That's a whole other story -- ""Black Books - The Complete First Series"" is one of the funniest and most underrated Britcoms in history, mixing gloriously wacky dialogue (""I ate all your bees!"") with characters so dysfunctional that it is amazing they can even stay alive. This is one of those rare shows that is practically perfect in every way.

Bernard Black (Dylan Moran) runs Black Books in the heart of London... except he seems to have started his business without the awareness that PEOPLE come to bookstores. As a result, he does whatever he can to avoid selling or buying books because that would be work he doesn't want to do. His only friend is Fran (Tamsin Greig) who owns a pretentious junk store two doors down.

But when his accountant runs from the police, Bernard has to do his own taxes -- and after failing miserably, he tries to find a way around it. Self-mutilation and hanging out with door-to-door missionaries are some of his options. His saving grace might be Manny (Bill Bailey), an overstressed accountant who accidentally swallowed and absorbed ""The Little Book of Calm,"" turning him into a holy avatar of relaxation advice.

Bernard drunkenly asks Manny to work at his store, and with some violent intervention by Fran, Manny settles into the filthy little apartment behind the bookstore. Of course, there's immediately lots of comedic mayhem -- they must recreate a bottle of unique wine for the pope, Manny becomes a 70s cop and a beard-prostitute, Bernard ends up wandering the streets all night, and Bernard and Fran swap stories about how he broke his arm (drunken dinner party) and she broke her neck (relationship drama).

""Black Books"" was co-created by Graham Linehan, who also made ""Father Ted"" and ""The IT Crowd. It's honestly a shame that it hasn't gotten the widespread love that those shows have -- this is one of those comedies where everything is just RIGHT. The cast, the characters, the writing, the mundane situations blossoming into sheer absurdity -- this is comic gold in every vein.

This is one of those shows that takes something mundane -- house-sitting, taxes, dinner parties, getting locked out -- and explodes it into absurdity. For instance, Bernard's attempt to do his taxes leads to him shrieking ""What? What?"" and gibbering about his mother. To avoid doing them, he ends up entertaining door-to-door evangelists, tries to get a customer to kneecap him, and eventually starts provoking skinheads in the street. And this isn't even the weirdest thing he and Manny get up to -- they practically act out the whole Frankenstein scenario while trying to create a wine out of household items.

It doesn't hurt that the dialogue is gutsplittingly funny (""Right now I'm eating scrambled eggs, with a comb, from a shoe!""). Every scene and subplot is packed with this sort of interplay, like Bernard hanging out in a porn shop asking for the most obscure kind he can think of (""Senior Administrative Nurses""), just so he won't have to pennilessly wander the cold wet streets for a few more minutes.

But the real crowning gem is the cast. All three of them have superb chemistry with each other, and they fill their roles out nicely -- the hardcore misanthrope, the nice guy, and the sensible person who deals with them both. Series co-creator/star Moran is absolutely hysterical, with his mad-scientist hair and his constant efforts to keep people out of his store, but there's something weirdly endearing about Bernard's grumpy-cat face and constant complaints. Maybe he just voices some of the less-tolerable thoughts we all have (""You know what you are? You're a beard with an idiot hanging off it"").

But don't downplay how much Greig and Bailey bring to it -- Bailey plays a sweet innocent guy who balances out Bernard's sourness while sometimes living in his own little world, while Greig plays a hilarious woman who has a disastrous love life and a shop full of useless gadgets she can't even identify. And if you squint, you can find early appearances by pre-fame Martin Freeman and Nick Frost.

""Black Books - The Complete First Series"" is one of those rarest of sitcoms: the ones that are actually good and funny almost all the time.  No one can truly  call themselves a Britcom fan unless they've seen this one.",1402358400,,4484,4.8700787401574805

Dylan Moran and Bill Bailey continue to be two of our favorite performers, also.

We have yet to get to the third season but am confident that it will surely please.,1382918400,,357,4.071428571428571
2443405,3,B000BVM1SW,"I've been enjoying this mostly. My husband had seen it and thought I'd enjoy it because I really like Bill Bailey AND I loved ""The IT Crowd,"" (also produced by Graham Linehan) but it took some ""settling in"" with it before I began to really appreciate Dylan Moran's particular brand of humor in this character. Some of the jokes are a little contrived and I have to suspend my disbelief a bit too high and a bit too often; it's not the sparkling, brilliant writing you'd find in a ""House MD"" episode, but its type of silly humor is played really big with the actors almost-but-not-quite winking at the audience, ""Yeah, we know this is silly, but just go along with it for a laugh."" And I do.

I'm afraid the ""Fran"" character is beginning to wear thin. Either the character is badly written or Greig's acting isn't very good, or she's not funny, or maybe she's just not the best actress suited to play ""Fran."" At first I thought maybe she was meant to be the ""straight woman"" to Bernard's and Manny's goofiness, but I'm at the end of the 2nd series and it seems as if she's meant to be as goofy as the guys are... except that in her case it just doesn't work. She doesn't enhance the humor of the scenes she's in WITH the guys, and the little plot-lines in which she's featured WITHOUT them are tedious and tiresome. I don't know why Fran is there. The show really doesn't need her and at this point her inclusion seems forced and she's just getting in the way. It doesn't help that Tamsin Greig wears a very unfortunate and unflattering hairstyle that becomes more distracting with each episode.

That said, the show is still quite funny; Dylan Moran and Bill Bailey are more than funny enough to overcome any of the minor weaknesses in it and the show is at its best when they're drunk or hungover together, probably add-libbing a lot of their scenes. I'm in the US and have seen Bill Bailey in other shows both as an actor and as himself (on panel shows, mostly) but Dylan really hasn't been in many other things that I would have ready access to (it's been too long since I've seen ""Shaun of the Dead,"" and I have zero interest in ever watching ""Notting Hill."" I have no problem with watching ""Shaun of the Dead"" again.) I don't know why he hasn't done more visible, mainstream work. Maybe he just prefers live stand-up and screen acting over appearing on panel shows. Anyway, I'm glad to have found him here. He's certainly the funniest ""drunk"" I've seen on TV. ;-)

UPDATE: Well the first four episodes of the 3rd season are about the best of the entire series, but fall off terribly in the last 2 episodes. The Fran character gets even more obnoxious, but the show around her gets much better. My husband suggested that we aren't supposed to like ANY of the characters much; they're all supposed to be objectionable. If that's the case, they succeeded masterfully in her case but failed terribly with Manny and Bernard.

I maintain that the best and FUNNIEST of this series is not in the show proper, but rather in the bloopers and outtakes. Go to Youtube and watch them from all 3 seasons. The guys are even funnier and Tamsin Greig is really delightful; she is much funnier and more enjoyable than her ""Fran"" character. Dylan's multiple takes of the scene with the little boy ""Jim"" in the ""Blackout"" episode (S1E4) is an absolute treasure.",1382400000,,3346,4.507413509060956

2443407,4,B000BVM1SW,"I stumbled across this Britcom and went ""what huh?""  Unlike most Britcoms, this is beyond quirky and goes right into surreal.  Half the time I'm not sure if I like the characters or want to stangle them...but then I'm sure they feel the same way about each other.  The dialogue is snarky, sharp, downright nasty on occasion, but always funny.  Only in England, could a show like this actually get on the air.

Black Books is named after the owner of a small bookstore called Bernard Black.  His hair always seems to be uncombed, his clothing is rumpled, and his manner is rude to say the least.  Does he own a bookstore to actually satisfy customers and buy and sell used books...are you kidding?  All he really wants to do is sit around and drink and be left alone and never do one lick of work.  He is one seriously messed-up guy.

Black ends up hiring (sort of) Manny, an equally messed-up individual who desperately wants to get out of the corporate world.  The two of them sort of devolve into a friendship (sort of) that involves equal parts snarking at each other and secretly needing each other.  While, the third member of their trio is Fran, an also messed-up (you get the picture) neurotic-even shopkeep from next door who also enjoys drinking away the world as she bemoans her sex life or lack thereof.

Together, they stumble through bizarre scenarios and try and figure out where their lives went seriously off-track.  I think the fact that they all need each other so much and care about each other, despite their best efforts, is what holds together this show.  Otherwise, some of the jokes and the general feel of the show might be just too dark and depressing.

Still, if you are looking for a chipper, warm, or delightful Britcom--Black Books isn't it.  I'd try instead The Good Life (Good Neighbors) or As Time Goes By for that.  But if you like lots of sarcasm, characters who are dithering losers, and darkly funny comedy, then you might want to give this show a go.",1372377600,2,1988,4.567796610169491

This is brilliant comedy, hard core physical comedy with great lines, comedic acts, and refreshing situations.  The situations are absurd and crazy at the same time.  Both males characters display equal talents in the line of physical comedy, complete with the facial features, and excellent delivery.

Although the setting is the bookstore, much is done away from the bookstore, bringing in some delightful and creative skits; with an array of peculiar characters.  There is always something going on, including few different character stories, and flashbacks.

I never had an opportunity to watch this in its prime, but sadly, there are only six episodes for the first season, and a gag of outtakes.  Enjoyable, fresh comedy!  Rizzo",1331424000,,1003,5.251572327044025

The pair are so great together on screen, that when they drink the precious wines and try to make their own concoction up again, it really is a laugh a minute. I would recommend this series to anyone, and if you are not sure at the start, then give it a chance, because it will grow on you, and you'll be laughing so loud you'll soon be getting complaints from the neighbours too.",1288483200,,828,4.4183006535947715

I love most english comedy (some people say British comedy, but english and british are two completely different things !) and while I don't know if I'd put BB up there with Monty Python or Fawlty Towers (my favourite english comedy show) it's definately a very, VERY, close second. This dvd has some of the best commentaries that I've ever heard on a tv show. I would have liked to have some behind the scenes documentaries and longer bloopers (it has a blooper segment, but it's rather short) but this is still a definate pickup for anyone who enjoys english comedy or dry-witted, smart, hilarious Irish drunk guys !",1191628800,,639,4.614035087719298
2443418,5,B000BVM1SW,"This is another example of how it's almost never the format that's at fault -- in this case, that old, dead horse: the sitcom -- but simply the imagination of those making it. And it would be hard to find fault with the imagination of the people who made Black Books.

The plots are in a similar vein to Seinfeld: A somewhat inexplicable group of friends (if they could be called that) run into well-chosen guest stars in unlikely roles, or set bizarre challenges for themselves (like turning the book shop into a Michelin-star restaurant that serves ""Luxury Pie: the Food of Kings"", not on plates, but on books with pictures of plates on the cover), or just basically knock back copious amounts of wine and cigarettes while generally pissing about in the bookshop. (NB: watching Black Books will make you want a glass of wine and/or a cigarette.)

Dialogue is alternately roguishly whip-smart and bafflingly inane, thanks to its rather eloquent stars. Bill Bailey and Dylan Moran are two of the best stand-up comedians in Britain today, and both are known for their ability to roll long-winded, super-intelligent pseudo-nonsense off their tongues in a rather non-chalant manner, a talent used to great effect in Black Books (not to mention Bill Bailey's incredible piano skills, used in one episode to fool a blind piano teacher). And Tamsin Greig (you may or may not know her as Debbie Aldridge from The Archers) rounds out the trio with her neurotic, cynical shopkeeper next door.

In short, this is one of the best British sitcoms ever produced, and therefore high in the running for one of the best sitcoms ever produced. And along with shows like I'm Alan Partridge, Spaced, Peep Show, The Office, and a number of others, it shows that British comedy has refused to rest on its laurels for the last decade or so, with new future classics being minted every year.

In shorter: Buy this.

2443419,5,B000BVM1SW,"This is a great series (as are all 3 Black Books series).

Highlight for me of series 1, is Manny chasing the mugger down the road and then bottling it when the guy turns round to face him. This is the result of Manny overdosing on The Sweeney and Expresso Coffee and then not sleeping. Bill Bailey is very funny in this show and if you've only caught his stand-up show you should watch Black Books without delay.

Bernard is clearly an Irish relative of Basil Fawlty. He hates all customers and has no interest in helping them. Dylan Moran who wrote or co-wrote most of the material plays Bernard and deserves a large amount of credit for creating 3 amazing characters.

Tasmin Greig is fabulous as Fran, a gentle kind hearted woman who is also prone to excessive drinking and on occasions very odd behaviour.

The voice over commentary from the cast on the DVD is nearly as entertaining as the show itself and well worth listening to.

Whilst not quite as laugh out loud as a few of the greatest sit-coms, the occasionally surreal writing and character mix put it very close to the top of the tree.",1173484800,,1100,4.48
2443420,4,B000BVM1SW,"Going into the bookselling world, I didn't know what to expect.  I haphazardly searched for a guide that would best instruct me on the ways of customer service, marketing, and security.  Whilst several video's failed, I knew that I could rely on the help of the BBC to fill the void.  Thankfully, those islanders came through with a short series (only three seasons) entitled Black Books in which we are taken out of the office environment (aka the original Office) and into the small-box world of bookselling.  The job is simple, sell the books, make the consumers happy, and leave a happy man at the end of the night.  That would seem simple enough unless your names are Bernard Black or Manny Bianco, the ill-fated employees of this independent bookstore.  Their hobbies include getting smashed off wine, smoking till their blue in the face, and avoiding actual conversations with those that patron their store.  They are the direct opposite of what you would expect in your typical American bookstore.  They are crass, they are cruel, they are drunk - but, most importantly, they are genuinely funny.  While this wasn't as phenomenal as The Office, it did provide some great laughs, some Python-esque moments (we can all recite the words to ""Bookshop"" can't we?), and a great reason to enjoy the world of customer service.

This first season introduces us to the beginnings of a relationship like those we can only see in the movies, like Pitt and Jolie or Cruise and Holms, there will always be a Bernard and Manny.  In the first episode, we learn how they meet and how the two decide to be working companions, and well, even more in further episodes.  We see our duo become a set of triplets with the introduction to the ""girl next door"" Fran Katzenjammer (played by Tamsin Greig) who seems to carry the same philosophy with her that the two shopkeepers do as well.  She understands their need for booze, insults, and disgruntled nature, and in fact, she feeds it further.  Through the course of the first season, we go from a struggling bookshop, to a friendship, to a need for security, to a snub, all the way to helping a friend by house sitting overnight and sampling his wine.  The opportunities seem to mimic the humor in this program - it is endless.  The chemistry between the characters is superb as well as the ideas generated by creator Dylan Morgan.  The timing is fantastic, providing the viewer with a combination punch of both slapstick and verbal routines.

This was a great show to view, but alas, it is only once that I could find myself sitting through it.  I don't mean to change the tables on this review, because I did love what this program offered in the form of obscenely funny retail sales moments, but what started out strongly eventually lost the speed it began with.  The first four episodes came out of the gate rather strongly, instituting laughs and originality with character driven scenes and relatable humor, but then with the latter part of episode five and especially episode six (where it seemed to fall into the Chef scenario of getting too much money per episode), we seemed to change gears suddenly.  It is extremely noticeable with the final episode entitled, ""He's Leaving Home"".  It was up until this moment that I thought this would have been worth purchasing, but this singular episode soured the entire experience for me.  It also lead me into a hesitant viewing of the second season.  I would like to restate that I loved so much about this series, but the dramatic change in appearance with the final episodes leaves me with just a regular taste in my mouth.

Overall, Black Books, the first season, is definitely worth a viewing.  There is so much to appreciate and enjoy with the characters, stories, and environment that I am surprised it didn't pick up as much ""cult"" rave as say, The Office did in the states.  Bernard Black is hysterical with his drunken raves and slanderish remarks - he will truly inspire anyone that spends time in the retail sector of our great nation.  Manny is the perfect patsy with phenomenal facial expressions and an ability to control the physical humor.  Manny and Bernard was a great pairing, while Fran seemed to be the anchor between the two.  Again, I cannot state that I loved the characters in this series, it just seemed to take a dramatically different course by the end of the first season - a direction I didn't think was one that fit the already standard mold.  I would suggest this first season to those that enjoyed Little Britain or The Office, but don't think it deserves any more than a singular viewing.

2443422,5,B000BVM1SW,"Black Books is a charming, absurdist situation comedy series set in a bookshop. ""Charming,"" you ask? ""The main character is a nasty, morose, chain-smoking drunk with a neurotic for a best friend and a bearded simpleton for an employee."" Ah, but what's what makes it such a gem of writing and acting.

Dylan Moran and Bill Bailey met during the Edinburgh Fringe and were the top two contenders for the Perrier Prize. Moran came out on top, but remembered Bailey a few years later when he was offered his own show. Moran's character of an ill-tempered grouch is matched perfectly by Bailey's good-hearted goof, and their chemistry as Bernard and Manny is what makes Black Books such enjoyable viewing. Tamsin Grieg is a good comic actress, but I found Fran Katzenjammer to be a little grating at times. Her character does develop more in subsequent seasons, so don't discount her performance.

Fans of Father Ted, Spaced, BlackAdder, and Little Britain should adore this show, and if I have to explain that any further then you should go back to watching ""According To Jim"".

It's rare to find comedies that are as intelligent as funny, and Black Books is a prime example of such shows. Of course it'd never take off in America, but I thought the same thing about The Office. Please, please, please do not remake this as an American sit-com.

For reasons unknown, Comedy Central used to run this early Sunday mornings back in 2001 before dropping it from the roster. I had only caught two episodes before and was distraught at its departure. Cue to last year and its Region 1 release and my frabjous rapture.
