7127045,4,B00WAGO8H8,"Beautiful And Twisted is an original Lifetime TV movie based on the true story about the Novack Murders and their investigation. It touches on themes about love,greed,excess and weirdness.

If there is one reason to see this movie,it is Paz Vega. I love her portrayal as Nancy as the femme fatale. While it may not be an Emmy- Award winning performance,I must say that it was definitely entertaining for it is filled with a lot of sexiness and humor. Also,she made Narcy an interesting character. As for compelling characters,it was also nice to see Rob Lowe provide an entertaining performance as well as Ben Novack,the battered and constantly outsmarted husband. It has qualities of campiness and silliness that the viewer will definitely find it fun and entertaining.",1435190400,4,770,5.062992125984252
7127046,4,B00WAGO8H8,"So many true crime TV programs such as ""48 Hours"" have dealt with the gruesome murders in the Novack family, the Miami royalty who founded the Fontainebleau Hotel - that I was reluctant to get this video. I thought there could be little more to add to the already numerous accounts.

But this movie does have a freshness about it, despite how well the ground has already been covered. The life leading up to these murders is recounted in a wry narrative style. This narration is done by the already dead Ben Novack, Jr., heir to the family's fortune. This puts the proceedings in a strange, out-of-body perspective from the start. It also allows Novack to be more of an appealing character than the straightforward TV documentaries made of him. Despite his addiction to porn, drugs, and Batman memorabilia, his postmortem account makes him seem almost angelic, a personage who hovers over the scene - enthusing in the excesses he enjoyed in life, and accepting with a sort of resigned twinkle the fate that these excesses ultimately dealt him.

Overall, this ""based in fact"" movie reminded me of the purely fictional movie ""Sexy Beast."" Both movies are unusual in that they feature characters who enjoy their wealth to the hilt. They are not depressed by their over-the-top lifestyles. They revel in all the excesses that their wealth affords them. So this is a departure from the usual code that even most modern movies adhere to - the code that dictates that the rich must be demonstrably miserable and undeserving at all times.

But then, this movie also swings along with the sort of syncopated beat that made ""Sexy Beast"" dance. In ""Sexy Beast,"" Ray Winstone's character revels in his good fortune by pronouncing it fabulicious, or literally, ""fan-dabby-dozy-tastic."" In this movie, Rob Lowe never quite utters any such catchy scat phrases. But the spirit of riffing through the music of our existence that way permeates this movie, right through the brutal killings.

It tends to give the viewer a new way of looking at life - and death. Isn't it all, in the end - Wow! Isn't it all fan-dabby-dozy-tastic?",1434585600,8,2111,4.855555555555555
