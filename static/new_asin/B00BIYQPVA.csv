5624813,5,B00BIYQPVA,"Journey of the Universe tells us of a voyage, a unique 14 billion year ongoing expedition where we, as humans, now stand at the crossroads playing the integral role of potentially controlling how the ensuing chapters shall progress. Journey of the Universe is a story of science. It is the story of history, of memory and of future. It is equally the unfolding story of the humanities.

Journey of the Universe is an epic tale told through hundreds of thousands, and millions of millions of little tiny stories that are being told all at the same time. It is a self-energizing tale of process, and an accounting of self-awareness; not just of the self-awareness of humankind, but the self-awareness that each living cell of each plant of each life form has inherent within it. It is animal to land, land and water to atmosphere, plants to air, earth to sun, solar system to universe and so on. It is the tale of the weaver, and of the knitting of each element to the other that then becomes the story itself unfolding.

Journey of the Universe is the evolution of childhood, of shared, self-amplifying and symbolic consciousness. It is the story of becoming human. And while Journey of the Universe is an epic film, it also asks a titanic question, for it peeks at the control we exert on our surroundings and asks you to consider if we, as a race, properly govern and correctly steer toward our collective future or are we fatally injuring the very thing we need and cherish most?

Journey of the Universe asks us to transform everything we thought we knew into something fresh and exciting. It tells that us we can. It inspires us to do so. It explains in a language all can understand that we are the stars, the nourishment, the passion and the creativity, and we are living the dream as we dream it.

Journey of the Universe is the story of knowledge unfolding, and Brian Swimme is the storyteller who captured me from the opening line.

5624866,5,B00BIYQPVA,"Besides the exquisite beauty and poetry of Journey of the Universe, the most impressive feature of this documentary for me is its message that human beings, through their powers of creativity, i.e., symbolic consciousness enabled by the capacity to make forms (art, language and technology in general), are now shaping the face of the Earth, which in turn is shaping our environment and our consciousness.

The film goes beyond mere recounting the story of the universe (aka evolution) by making the statement that our deepest yearning is for a whole-hearted participation in the flourishing of this process. If this is the case, it explains why so many people are depressed, addicted and preoccupied, while others are waking up and throwing themselves headlong into repairing our beautiful and ailing planet.

A sense of purpose is essential for the health of the individual. How much more so for the health of our species? These are cosmological questions of meaning that have not been posed so effectively in the modern context because of the aversion to questions of meaning in the scientific materialist paradigm.

Journey of the Universe is an antidote for this vacuum of meaning and the malaise of our time. What's more, it just could jolt us out of our inaction and embolden everyone who views it to participate in the Great Work of our time: forging a benign and cooperative relationship with the Earth and the other forces of nature.

In so doing, it just might spare our own species from extinction, which in one estimation, is expected to reach 400,000 species by 2100. I suspect this would be a wonderful way to spark conversation with late high school students and young adults, who have had the introduction to the disciplines Journey of the Universe covers: physics, biology, genetics, evolution, sexuality, and the other sciences, and stimulate an consider the query: What is your unique role to play in the unfolding of Creation?",1395187200,,1947,5.018575851393189

5624906,5,B00BIYQPVA,"'Journey of the Universe' was shown to the staff of a center for environmental research and education -- and we all enjoyed it and were inspired by it.

We were struck by the sense of wonder that was sustained the entire time we watched 'Journey'. In fact, the sense of wonder moved some of us to tears. The film is that beautiful.

As individuals working in the field of environment, the information we come across and process is often discouraging as well as difficult to comprehend without an environmental background. 'Journey' is completely the opposite in both respects. It teachers the importance of caring for our environment by inspiring and awakening awe and hope in the viewer and it transcends one's background (and political views) about environmental matters. This film sends the message that each one of us is an active, significant participant in the health and well-being of our environment locally and globally.",1373328000,,929,5.025974025974026

5624908,5,B00BIYQPVA,"The Journey of the Universe is just that, a journey. It takes you on a voyage of discovery into a new story about the universe and our place within it. Its biggest strong suit is, perhaps, how approachable it is. Rather than narrowing the story into one specific philosophy, scientific worldview, or religion, Journey of the Universe masterfully expresses a number of issues together in one brilliant film. People of all religions, all philosophies, all backgrounds can not only enjoy the beauty of the film but can bring to it their own points of view.

But really what this film does is simply tell the story of us. How we are all connected together no matter where we live, no matter what we believe. It is a story of how all humans are connected with all of nature, all of the universe. Journey is the story of us. It is OUR Journey, and so it's no wonder we can all easily approach this film.

It is easy to see why this film has won a regional Emmy. It is brilliantly shot, delightfully told, and entrancingly beautiful. I highly recommend this film to people of all ages and walks of life. DO SHARE! It's a must see! You won't be disappointed.",1370131200,3,1150,4.4714285714285715
5624909,5,B00BIYQPVA,"This film and the series that goes with it, ""Conversations,"" provide an astounding  foundation for a new way of thinking about our origin and identity inside a self organizing, creative, emergent universe.  Brian Swimme, Mary Evelyn Tucker and John Grim are the foremost successors in the philosophical lineage of Thomas Berry, taking his thinking to yet another level.  In this view, the universe is not dead with the human as the one accidental bright spot, full of life . . . full of soul. In this view the whole thing is creative with it's own interiority, or subjectivity spread throughout.  The implications of this perspective are further explored in the follow up series.  This view changes everything, Brian Swimme says in the movie.  Education, medicine, the environment, government . . . indeed all fields of human endeavor need to be re-examined inside of a larger stunning context, a hero's journey that whole universe is on.

5624914,5,B00BIYQPVA,"Five stars are not enough to express my appreciation for this resource.

Since 1977, I have sought to image, describe and conceptualize in easily understandable ways the evolutionary story of how the world came to be. I tried to do this first for myself, a non-scientist, and for other seekers who also longed to understand. The scientific discoveries of the evolution of the Universe are all encompassing, leaving no dimension of human experience unaffected. The writings of Thomas Berry became totally engaging, but there were so few resources for communicating their power. For decades at Genesis Farm, we literally ""cut and pasted"" drawings, charts, timelines, rituals, snippets of films, lectures and images in a constant attempt to grasp, understand and share the enormity of what this ""new cosmology"" was revealing.

At long last, this masterful resource provides the mind and heart with an understandable history of how everything came into being.  Through profound and accessible imagery and narration, it also illuminates the exceptional capacities of Brian Swimme, Mary Evelyn Tucker, John Grim and all their associates to grasp such enormous concepts of time and space as well as the intimacy of our very human selves, bound together in the marvel of existence.  Never do they lose sight of the mystery and meaning so necessary for our human community to take our part in the ongoing journey of life.  The Journey of the Universe film, book, and series of conversations are the vital tools we have needed for laying the foundations of a future worthy of our children.

In a remarkably lean 55 minutes, this film is able to cover such sprawling topics as the birth of the universe, the evolution of life on Earth, the development of humans' (symbolic) consciousness, and the religious resonance of our wonder at it all. Narrated by the cosmologist Brian Swimme, Journey of the Universe is deeply informed on scientific cosmology, and was developed by leading scholars in the history of religions. Yet while the information presented here may be heavy, it is presented in such a way as to not be inaccessible. The narrative is quite entertaining -- I learned quite a lot from it!

And yet, on the other hand, the fact that our daily lives are part and parcel to this immense unfolding universe speaks to the sacredness of our daily lives as well.

5624942,5,B00BIYQPVA,"The film ""Journey of the Universe"" is a miracle.

How can anyone imagine telling the story of where we come from and presenting a synthesis of the best of contemporary science related to our evolutionary cosmological journey from the creation of the Universe to the modern human challenges as a planet-wrecking species in a 55 minute film? It can't be done! But, indeed, this is EXACTLY what the Producers and Writers of this epic film have done.

From the initial moments of the film you realize that this is not your typical dumbed-down science piece for the Discovery Channel. You are engaged from the first minute until the end and as you watch your mind is challenged to absorb and ponder just what all this means to each and every one of the seven billion of us alive at this moment and in whose hands the future of this creative gift, known as planet Earth, resides.

The film traces the story of us from the beginning of the Universe, the creation of stars and galaxies, the supernova explosions from whose remnants planets like Earth are formed, through the emergence of Life and its subsequent evolution and complexification, through to us with our imagination and symbolic consciousness. At no point is the information ""heavy"" and the narrative flows at a brisk and comfortable pace augmented by really good computer graphics, photos, video clips and music. The narrator/host Brian Thomas Swimme does an excellent job of gently guiding you through this incredible ""Journey"".

For me, personally, I was deeply touched as I considered how the modern industrial society we have created is so blindly bulldozing over the beauty and creativity from which we have sprung here on Earth. It's taken the Universe 14 billion years and planet Earth over 4 billion years to produce this amazing garden planet we live on and in only a few short centuries we humans have nearly wrecked the place! If you aren't moved to the brink of tears in the second half of the film I'll be surprised.

This film should be viewed by everyone and high school kids in particular. It provides a perspective on what we humans are about which is lacking in so many educational and technical fields of study. I often wonder why we are in such a hurry to over-populate and over-consume when the most profound and fulfilling needs we have are answered in simple life and existence.

Highly Recommended - Six Stars out of Five (Amazon only let me give 5 - sorry!)

It opens up a vast space narrating a story about who humans are. It integrates astonishing, recent scientific understandings with age-old wisdom. It stimulates conversations that include how religion and science not only may not be at odds, but are complementary. It challenges people to expand their worldviews, perhaps even helping bring about transformation in the ways viewers understand themselves and their relationships within the universe and our Earth communities. Indeed, I have seen this story help others discover a fresh sense of belonging to each other and to the whole world. And this leads to further deepening conversations about how to respond to urgent and vital matters, including human-caused mass extinction, soil erosion, human hunger, and climate change. I can not recommend it strongly enough as a big, big story that helps us orient ourselves today authentically and with the hope of, if not holding back suffering, finding deep meaning for living life amidst it.

8569203,5,B00BIYQPVA,love Swimme's presentations on our history - who we are and where we came from....very well written and produced documentary....,1496448000,,128,5.45
8569204,2,B00BIYQPVA,"This was interesting enough, but essentially there was nothing new.  A far cry from Sagan's Cosmos, and I have no idea how other reviewers compared this to Joseph Campbell's Power of Myth.  There was very little ""spiritual"" thought, and even that was clothed in a scientific explanation.",1478908800,,287,5.085106382978723
8569205,5,B00BIYQPVA,"Great movie, coming from a renowned Yale-scholar who has tried to merge science and religious beliefs for many years!",1475366400,,117,5.2105263157894735
8569206,5,B00BIYQPVA,"I bought ten immediately to give away. Brilliant, eloquently laid out so that anyone with the slightest interest in their origin story will come away with a deeper understanding of the cosmos and their rightful place in it. This is the new mythology that puts the burden of saving our environment at our doorstep.
The Journey of the Universe does a beautiful dance between everything we have ever learned and have known instinctively all along. Thank you Brian Swimme for this inspiring work. I'm sure Joseph Campbell and Alan Watts would be impressed.",1471824000,,552,4.946236559139785
8569207,4,B00BIYQPVA,This is an good overview of the cosmic story. It isn't 'cosmos' but then it only goes for an hour so there are limitations. Some good analogies and metaphorical comparisons. The presentation is lively and it is a thought provoking ride. Good solid information but with an urge to consider the meaning behind the facts.,1467244800,,318,4.8
8569208,5,B00BIYQPVA,"Inspiring, thought provoking view of the universe and of the role we humans play in it.  All parts of the universe seem to have a self organizing--and sometimes self awareness--aspect to them.",1464652800,,192,5.0
8569209,5,B00BIYQPVA,Loved it! Beautiful documentary.,1441584000,,32,7.25
