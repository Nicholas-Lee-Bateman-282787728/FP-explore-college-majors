There's a lot more to this holiday and it's history than what's in this, but the episodes are only an hour long, so they kind of have to give an abreviated history.  If you're into holidays (especially Halloween), I definitely recommend this.  It's got some great ideas for Halloween fun in it too.",1400630400,3,464,4.488095238095238
8371870,5,B002KBC884,"I saw this program on the History Channel back in 2008 and had to watch it again and again.  This program goes in-depth on the technology and gadgetry of today's modern Halloween environment.  You'll see what goes into making Halloween props, costumes, makeup, advanced pumpkin carving, plus a whole lot more.  Several haunted attractions across the country are featured.  You'll see what goes into getting a haunted attraction up and running.

I highly recommend this program.",1382054400,4,477,5.223684210526316
