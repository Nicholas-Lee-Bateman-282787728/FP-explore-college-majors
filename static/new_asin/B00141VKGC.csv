8254035,3,B00141VKGC,"RAGING SHARKS

RELEASED TO VIDEO IN 2005 and directed by Danny Lerner, Raging Sharks concerns an extraterrestrial object that crash-lands in the Bermuda Triangle, which releases an alien substance that causes sharks to go crazy and attack an oceanic observatory station, beach goers and anyone else nearby. Corin Nemec plays the leader of the station and Vanessa Angel his wife, who runs the station in his absence. Corbin Bernsen appears as a wise sub commander and Todd Jensen a dubious government agent.

This aint your typical Jaws-copy shark flick; the plots way more ambitious. In fact, theres well over two hours of material here crammed into an hour and a half. The production quality is akin to the usual Syfy fare but with a lot of cussing, which shows that it was released to video rather than TV.

The creators mustve been targeting 12-14 year-old boys because theres zero character development or suspense build-up. Something exciting happens every couple minutes, whether a shark attack, an explosion, a compartment flooded, someone getting knifed, shot, drowned, etc. Despite the continuous thrilling events to appease those with ADHD the first hour is relatively boring with zero artistic tact. Imagine if Conan the Barbarian knew how to play guitar and crudely tried to play the moving classic Stairway to Heaven. Thats a good description of this movie as it freely borrows from several sci-fi and shark films to barbarically fashion its own adolescent action flick.

Thankfully, the last act finally delivers some genuine excitement and suspense, which is the main reason my grade is as high as it is. Plus Elise Muller as Vera is showcased effectively in a couple of scenes, but they couldve done a lot better considering the female resources at their disposal. So, this is a bad movie, but the final act is impressively kinetic and entertaining, as far as action-oriented sci-fi goes. Too bad its such a challenge to make it that far.

THE MOVIE RUNS 93 minutes and was shot in Sofia, Bulgaria. WRITER: Les Weldon.

====================

KRAKEN: TENTACLES OF THE DEEP

Released to TV in 2006, ""Kraken: Tentacles of the Deep"" chronicles the adventures of an expedition led by archaeologist Nicole (Victoria Pratt) to find a legendary Greek Opal, which turns out to be guarded by the very beast that murdered one of the team member's parents (Charlie O'Connell), a giant squid. As they come face to face with the creature they are forced to tangle with a ruthless treasure-hunting mobster (Jack Scalia), who will stop at nothing to steal the treasure.

While the BC locations are great and the squid looks pretty good for low-budget CGI, the acting of the protagonists is too flat and the villain is overly cartoony. Fitness model Pratt comes off as a more buff Kate Hudson, but doesn't do much for me. Michal Yannai as Sally is equally blas. The stunning Nicole McKay is on hand as the heavy's babe for all of 20 seconds. I realize a lot of work went into making this movie and it's worthwhile if you favor Pratt, O'Connell or sea monster flicks, but it's just overall too prosaic.

The movie runs almost 90 minutes and was shot in Britannia Beach, Squamish & Vancouver, British Columbia.
