https://www.amazon.com/review/R32MDQBP5YD8PZ/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006SKP9B6

This contents of this energy healing DVD (PLUS the above one that I reviewed!) are both INCLUDED in Sura's 3rd and cheaper DVD (the only one in stock at the time of this writing anyway):&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sura-Flow-Yoga-Complete-Beginners-Program-Energy-Healing-Yoga-Meditation/dp/B006QMOMZ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sura Flow Yoga: Complete Beginners Program ''Energy Healing, Yoga & Meditation''</a>.
