But thanks to an enraptured and inspired photography of the great Vittorio Storaro, we can enjoy of this movie which in told at two levels: the human and the operatic and how this last one is visibly influenced by the first one.

A memorable cast, a wonderful camera handle plus a fluid script shake hands to convey us to a memorable film, overloked by critics and great audiences.

A must for opera lovers as well for outcomers. A wonderful visual feast with unforgettable sequences.",1301702400,2,617,4.694444444444445
8392793,2,B003A37S2C,"This movie was recommended to me by friends at the time it was showing in local theatres. Because of lack of time, etc., I missed it. So I ordered the DVD. But I was quite disappointed in what I saw. This was a superficial treatment of the creation of one of Mozart's great operas. It was difficult to know how much of it was actual fact and how much of it was fiction. Relatively few scenes from the opera were actually shown in performance. In fact Mozart's glorious music was only given a minor part and was overwhelmed by the sumptuosity of the decors and costumes.",1295222400,2,569,4.377358490566038
