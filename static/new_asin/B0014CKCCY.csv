3129474,5,B0014CKCCY,"As noted in a previous review, this SPAGHETTI WESTERNS 20 MOVIE PACK contains several films (10) not found in other compilations. I had not seen any of these movies before, but purchased the set for the variety of stellar international actors who appear here (which includes Piero Lulli, Rosalba Neri, Gilbert Roland, Chen Lee, Erika Blanc, and Klaus Kinski, in addition to many great American western actors...for $10 new, postage included, this was a ""no-brainer""!). I've not yet watched all twenty movies, but about 3/4 of them, and I can attest already that I've got my money's worth and more! I have especially enjoyed THE FIGHTING FISTS OF SHANGHAI JOE (SEE this, if you haven't yet!), MINNESTOA CLAY, FISTFUL OF LEAD, JOHNNY YUMA, SUNDANCE AND THE KID, DEATH RIDES A HORSE, and even WHITE APACHE (a must-see for fans of Wm. Shatner!).

Having other Mill Creek packs of various film genres in my possession, I didn't have high expectations for picture/sound clarity...however, all but a few of these are quite good in that regard. I'm pleased overall with the transfer quality: 4 or 5 of the films are in gorgeous WidescreeN, and another PLUS is that the seemingly ubiquitous ""Mill Creek"" watermark found on other releases is nowhere to be seen here!!! Mill Creek has also upgraded their packaging, with paper sleeves holding the 'picture disks' (4 films on each single-sided dvd) which feature a graphic of Lee Van Cleef next to CLEARLY MARKED TITLES; these  are snugly packed inside a sturdy molded plastic case. Definitely worth more than the $10 pittance I shelled out!",1263772800,71,1579,4.9547169811320755
3129475,5,B0014CKCCY,"As a great fan of westerns, i can certainly say that this one is a rare collection... prints are not that classy but it aint matter for me if the movie is an old western! it gives the feel of watching it in the real setting :)",1260489600,5,226,3.8297872340425534
3129476,5,B0014CKCCY,"$12.99 for 20 movies? And some of them very rare?How can you go wrong?I have enjoyed this collection so much. This is a must for every Spaghetti Western fan. Just a little plug for Amazon here: I have made many orders, Amazon has the best selection (of course)and the shipping is extremely reasonable and fast. You can look all over town if you want (or all over the net), but you will save time and money by just getting it with Amazon.",1253232000,8,437,4.341463414634147

3129478,4,B0014CKCCY,"When I see a box set of 20 movies for this price I am always skeptical but optimistic. Hopefully some of the titles will at least be watchable, from a picture quality standpoint. I was amazed to find that half the movies in this collection are very good widescreen transfers. Some of these are Beyond the Law, Find a Place to Die, Grand Duel, Johnny Yuma, and Minnesota Clay. The only truly unwatchable transfer is Gunfight at Red Sands. A few of these films are not actually Spaghetti Westerns but at the price of this set I shouldn't be complaining at all.
I was especially impressed with the quality of Johnny Yuma. Well worth the money.",1247097600,49,640,4.525862068965517
3129479,4,B0014CKCCY,I've only seen a couple of the movies but I've never see this stuff on cable TV so its worth getting. Reasonable price and the discs are labeled so its easy to find your selection. I'm looking forward to checking most of these movies out over time and that's a great compliment for a public domain movie set! 4 of 5 stars.,1235779200,12,322,4.209677419354839

3129491,5,B0014CKCCY,"In the 1960s ""spaghetti westerns"" took the world by storm. Coming at a time when Hollywood westerns were growing increasingly stale, they were dismissed as trash by most critics, but their music, editing, and photography were beyond anything Hollywood was doing at the time. (Eventually, Sam Peckinpah would beat the Italians at their own game, making such classics as ""The Wild Bunch"" and ""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid."") This bargain collection from Mill Creek contains 20 lesser known offerings of the genre, ranging from the sublime (Death Rides a Horse) to the ridiculous (White Comanche, a rare western starring William Shatner). Though not great art, most of the films in this collection are at least entertaining, with great music, epic scenery, well-choreographed shootouts and actors ranging from familiar Hollywood names (the ubiquitous Lee Van Cleef, Jack Palance, Cameron Mitchell) to home-grown Italian performers like Giuliano Gemma and Fabio Testi. My personal favorites are Johnny Yuma, a gripping tale of greed and revenge with Mark Damon and Rosalba Neri;; Find a Place To Die, a haunting survival drama with Jeffrey Hunter; The Fighting Fists of Shanghai Joe, a bizarre combination of chop-socky and shoot-'em-up, and ""Between God, the Devil, and a Winchester,"" a rollicking adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's ""Treasure Island"" starring Hollywood veteran Gilbert Roland. Ironically, the two worse movies in the collection are the only ones featuring Native American characters (Apache Blood and the aforementioned White Comanche). The quality of the transfer varies from film to film; a few have letterbox; most don't. Inexplicably, the dialogue in ""Beyond the Law"" briefly switches to Italian (with subtitles) before returning to English.",1464048000,,1764,5.488970588235294

Due to this there are four movies on each DVD, making it impossible to provide a good picture quality!. The actual selection of movies met my high expectations. This DVD Box contained the same movies as promised, some of them real spaghetti western classics. The reason for my rather low review, with only two out of five stars, is due to the very poor picture quality. This was for me a huge disappointment that spoiled my high expectations, and pretty much the joy of watching Movies like this. If you only want to watch each movie once I recon this box is OK.

This is certainly 20 not very good western movies.

I've seen 4 so far, here are my thoughts:

Beyond the Law - I liked the movie, its not good, but I liked it.  The problem was the movie was filmed for a widescreen, then converted to fit a square tv screen by use of the ""letterbox"" by blacking out a stripe on top and bottom.  This was fine, but then I watched it on a widescreen tv which blacked out the sides as well.  So I watched this movie using the about the middle 1/3 of the screen.  Its other problem was the blurriness.  The blurriness wasn't too bad but it was there; the smaller credits text was nearly unreadable.

Apache Blood - I saw Monster A-Go-Go thanks to Mystery Science Theater 3000, and I will admit that that movie is maybe worse than Apache Blood, but not by much.  Those two are almost certainly the worst movies that I have ever seen.  It is truly an awful movie, and not in a good way.

This Man Can't Die - The movie was fine, by no means a good movie, but it was fine.

Gunfight at Red Sands - The movie is bad, but its biggest problem is that if there were any fewer pixels used it would be completely unwatchable.  I'd guess that the very first movie (about 12 minutes long, black and white, & silent) used a camera with twice as many pixels in it.  I suggest converting it to radio if you wanted to be entertained by the [mediocre, at best] story.

So the movies aren't good but they can still be enjoyable to watch.  I would recommend finding better versions of the few better ones (hint: they star Lee Van Cleef, and probably Warren Oates) and skipping this movie collection.",1356480000,,1694,4.2933753943217665

Every aspect of these movies are completely unprofessional, including the music, A complete ripoff at any price! Other reviews with higher ratings because the price was so cheap have not done any favors to other buyers.  You get what you pay for and I would not watch this mess again if Amazon paid ME!! Because of the low price that I paid it is too costly for me to return it to Amazon so I have to cut my loses and toss it in the trash.  I'm very disappointed with Amazon that they would sell junk this bad to anyone and even promote it by discribing it as ""exciting!"" Shame on you Amazon.  Mill Creek Entertainment created this 5 DVD mess with the talent and know how of a kindergardener and I will NEVER by a product made by them again and maybe not even Amazon.  This is nothing more than false advertising and lies to get customers to buy into ""20 movies - 32 hours"" at a very cheap price featuring Lee Van Cleef (in only 4 movies) and Jack Palance (in only one movie).  No one associated with making this ""Movie Pack"" should have made money including Amazon in selling this crap to their good and loyal customers.  Shame on you again Amazon.

1. When selected from the menu, four of the titles refuse to  play.
2. Image quality of the transfers is uneven but generally not good. Fuzzy focus for a start, but more irritating are the wrong or wandering aspect ratios/image cropping.  Sometimes the aspect ratio varies from shot to shot in the same sequence. So, not much use for visual or stylistic analysis. Still, at the price...",1290643200,9,545,5.033333333333333

In any case. we found this pack of 20 western movies for under ten dollars and couldn't resist the bargain. We've now watched about half of them. None of them have been particularly good, but a couple of Lee Van Cleef movies were passable. It was good to see Jack Palance as he makes for such a good heavy. One of the movies features William Shattner, of all people, and we enjoyed it for the novelty. Many of the movies we've watched were formatted for the old small screen TV. Picture quality ranged from OK to miserable. Same with sound. Well, what can you say? The good news: 20 movies for only $ 0.50 each. The bad news they aren't particularly good movies.

3129568,5,B0014CKCCY,"My main reason in purchasing this collection was another online review that indicated one or two of the movies were widescreen prints in great condition. Indeed, this is the case - most importantly Sergio Corbucci's excellent MINNESOTA CLAY; which exists elsewhere in terrible condition on other DVD collections and as a single DVD (Unfortunately, the original Italian ending for this movie - according to Alex Cox's book on Italian westerns - isn't present here - but this is still an excellent print). Also - ARIZONA COLT - here with it's international title of THE MAN FROM NOWHERE is in great shape, with a couple of irritating 'jumps' towards the end, but with what appears to be additional footage spliced in from a German print (made obvious by a sudden drop in picture quality). FIND A PLACE TO DIE is also a great widescreen print, with its haunting Gianni Ferrio theme song and atmospheric locations. Some colour fading at times and an ending that looks a little truncated. JOHNNY YUMA - again, in fabulous condition. From my point of view, these movies alone in this kind of condition made the purchase worthwhile (although I bought mine second hand via Amazon as opposed to the full price).

Other stand-outs include THE FIGHTING FIST OF SHANGHAI JOE - which reveals itself to be actually MY NAME IS SHANGHAI JOE (Il Mio Nome e Shanghai Joe) with one of Bruno Nicolai's best music scores. A shame that it's in 4:3 rather than in widescreen, but the over-the-top nasty violence (including arm splintering and eye gouging) seems intact - with a great OTT performance by Klaus Kinski.  BEYOND THE LAW - not one of my favourite spaghetti westerns (but with a great music theme by Riz Ortolani) is also in great shape in this collection, with good colour - compared to the various other releases in muddy colour and terrible framing.

DEATH RIDES A HORSE - one of my favourite spaghetti westerns - is in 'serviceable' condition here, but is in no way comparable to the official single DVD release, which is not only in pristine widescreen, but contains material that appears to have been cut from this version.

Some bummers here, as you might expect. WHITE COMMANCHE exists on other collections - and whereas the novelty value of William Shatner in a spaghetti western might draw your attention - the utterly lousy music score will put you off in the first two minutes. GUNFIGHT AT RED SANDS - with one of Ennio Morricone's first scores - is in an appalling state, looking like a video to DVD transfer ten generations removed from its original source. If this is your main attraction to this collection, look elsewhere - because it can be found in a much better state on other releases.

I haven't reviewed the other titles yet (most of which I have individually or on other collections) although I'm hopeful that the prints will be as good as the first titles I've mentioned. On that basis, I'd recommend this collection - but not at the full price requested.",1278115200,13,2968,4.766536964980545

3129570,3,B0014CKCCY,"The face on the cover is most recognizable to those familiar with the Spaghetti western genre, Lee Van Cleef is featured on four of these twenty films from Mill Creek dvd co... The steely-eyed actor stars in ""Beyond The Law"", ""Death Rides A Horse"", ""God's Gun"", including an uncut version of ""Grand Duel"", the uncut version makes this film a much better movie, the plot is more in sink. These Van Cleef films are also better transfers than seen before, including widescreen versions of Grand Duel and Beyond The Law. There are a few almost unwatchable films on here, ""China 9,Liberty 37"", still remains edited and the audio is muffled on the dialogue, too bad, it's a Monte Hellman classic. ""Apache Blood"" an American film, is known as the worst film or western ever made, watch for yourself, if you can make it through it. ""Gunfight At Red Sands"", one of the first spaghetti's ever made, the transfer is butchered, like watching an old silent film, in some scenes the motion is fast, everything and everyone moves in double time. The Lee Van Cleef westerns are worth the price of admission alone, along with a few other gems, ""Johnny Yuma"", ""Minnesota Clay"", ""White Comanche"", ""The Fighting Fist Of Shanghai Joe"", a combined martial arts/western tale, look for a deranged Klaus Kinski in his usual psychotic role.

I had not seen any of these movies before, but purchased the set for the variety of stellar international actors who appear here (which includes Piero Lulli, Rosalba Neri, Gilbert Roland, Chen Lee, Erika Blanc, and Klaus Kinski, in addition to many great American western actors...for $10 new, postage included, this was a ""no-brainer""!). I've not yet watched all twenty movies, but about 3/4 of them, and I can attest already that I've got my money's worth and more! I have especially enjoyed THE FIGHTING FISTS OF SHANGHAI JOE (SEE this, if you haven't yet!), MINNESTOA CLAY, FISTFUL OF LEAD, JOHNNY YUMA, SUNDANCE AND THE KID, DEATH RIDES A HORSE, and even WHITE APACHE (a must-see for fans of Wm. Shatner!).

Having other Mill Creek packs of various film genres in my possession, I didn't have high expectations for picture/sound clarity...however, all but a few of these are quite good in that regard. I'm pleased overall with the transfer quality: 4 or 5 of the films are in gorgeous WidescreeN, and another PLUS is that the seemingly ubiquitous ""Mill Creek"" watermark found on other releases is nowhere to be seen here!!! Mill Creek has also upgraded their packaging, with paper sleeves holding the 'picture disks' (4 films on each single-sided dvd) which feature a graphic of Lee Van Cleef next to CLEARLY MARKED TITLES; these  are snugly packed inside a sturdy molded plastic case.

3363988,5,B0014CKCCY,"In the 1960s ""spaghetti westerns"" took the world by storm. Coming at a time when Hollywood westerns were growing increasingly stale, they were dismissed as trash by most critics, but their music, editing, and photography were beyond anything Hollywood was doing at the time. (Eventually, Sam Peckinpah would beat the Italians at their own game, making such classics as ""The Wild Bunch"" and ""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid."") This bargain collection from Mill Creek contains 20 lesser known offerings of the genre, ranging from the sublime (Death Rides a Horse) to the ridiculous (White Comanche, a rare western starring William Shatner). Though not great art, most of the films in this collection are at least entertaining, with great music, epic scenery, well-choreographed shootouts and actors ranging from familiar Hollywood names (the ubiquitous Lee Van Cleef, Jack Palance, Cameron Mitchell) to home-grown Italian performers like Giuliano Gemma and Fabio Testi. My personal favorites are Johnny Yuma, a gripping tale of greed and revenge with Mark Damon and Rosalba Neri;; Find a Place To Die, a haunting survival drama with Jeffrey Hunter; The Fighting Fists of Shanghai Joe, a bizarre combination of chop-socky and shoot-'em-up, and ""Between God, the Devil, and a Winchester,"" a rollicking adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's ""Treasure Island"" starring Hollywood veteran Gilbert Roland. Ironically, the two worse movies in the collection are the only ones featuring Native American characters (Apache Blood and the aforementioned White Comanche). The quality of the transfer varies from film to film; a few have letterbox; most don't. Inexplicably, the dialogue in ""Beyond the Law"" briefly switches to Italian (with subtitles) before returning to English.",1464048000,,1764,5.488970588235294

3364049,3,B0014CKCCY,"I wasn't expecting movie masterpieces, but even my low expectations were not met.

This is certainly 20 not very good western movies.

I've seen 4 so far, here are my thoughts:

Beyond the Law - I liked the movie, its not good, but I liked it.  The problem was the movie was filmed for a widescreen, then converted to fit a square tv screen by use of the ""letterbox"" by blacking out a stripe on top and bottom.  This was fine, but then I watched it on a widescreen tv which blacked out the sides as well.  So I watched this movie using the about the middle 1/3 of the screen.  Its other problem was the blurriness.  The blurriness wasn't too bad but it was there; the smaller credits text was nearly unreadable.

Apache Blood - I saw Monster A-Go-Go thanks to Mystery Science Theater 3000, and I will admit that that movie is maybe worse than Apache Blood, but not by much.  Those two are almost certainly the worst movies that I have ever seen.  It is truly an awful movie, and not in a good way.

This Man Can't Die - The movie was fine, by no means a good movie, but it was fine.

Gunfight at Red Sands - The movie is bad, but its biggest problem is that if there were any fewer pixels used it would be completely unwatchable.  I'd guess that the very first movie (about 12 minutes long, black and white, & silent) used a camera with twice as many pixels in it.  I suggest converting it to radio if you wanted to be entertained by the [mediocre, at best] story.

So the movies aren't good but they can still be enjoyable to watch.  I would recommend finding better versions of the few better ones (hint: they star Lee Van Cleef, and probably Warren Oates) and skipping this movie collection.",1356480000,,1694,4.2933753943217665
3364050,5,B0014CKCCY,"If you are looking for great picture and audio, then maybe you shouldn't buy a bunch DVDs labeled ""Spaghetti Westerns"". Excellent collection for anyone that is really into these old Italian Westerns. I think a lot of the storylines are excellent for an Italian Western. These type of movies aren't meant to be taken very seriously anyway. A lot of what makes these movies entertaining is the poor quality. If you're looking for something visually stunning with a brilliant storyline, the spaghetti western genre is really not for you.",1356480000,,534,5.01123595505618

I'm very disappointed with Amazon that they would sell junk this bad to anyone and even promote it by discribing it as ""exciting!"" Shame on you Amazon.  Mill Creek Entertainment created this 5 DVD mess with the talent and know how of a kindergardener and I will NEVER by a product made by them again and maybe not even Amazon.  This is nothing more than false advertising and lies to get customers to buy into ""20 movies - 32 hours"" at a very cheap price featuring Lee Van Cleef (in only 4 movies) and Jack Palance (in only one movie).

1. When selected from the menu, four of the titles refuse to  play.
2. Image quality of the transfers is uneven but generally not good. Fuzzy focus for a start, but more irritating are the wrong or wandering aspect ratios/image cropping.  Sometimes the aspect ratio varies from shot to shot in the same sequence. So, not much use for visual or stylistic analysis. Still, at the price...",1290643200,9,545,5.033333333333333

In any case. we found this pack of 20 western movies for under ten dollars and couldn't resist the bargain. We've now watched about half of them. None of them have been particularly good, but a couple of Lee Van Cleef movies were passable. It was good to see Jack Palance as he makes for such a good heavy. One of the movies features William Shattner, of all people, and we enjoyed it for the novelty. Many of the movies we've watched were formatted for the old small screen TV. Picture quality ranged from OK to miserable. Same with sound. Well, what can you say? The good news: 20 movies for only $ 0.50 each. The bad news they aren't particularly good movies.

3364065,5,B0014CKCCY,"My main reason in purchasing this collection was another online review that indicated one or two of the movies were widescreen prints in great condition. Indeed, this is the case - most importantly Sergio Corbucci's excellent MINNESOTA CLAY; which exists elsewhere in terrible condition on other DVD collections and as a single DVD (Unfortunately, the original Italian ending for this movie - according to Alex Cox's book on Italian westerns - isn't present here - but this is still an excellent print). Also - ARIZONA COLT - here with it's international title of THE MAN FROM NOWHERE is in great shape, with a couple of irritating 'jumps' towards the end, but with what appears to be additional footage spliced in from a German print (made obvious by a sudden drop in picture quality). FIND A PLACE TO DIE is also a great widescreen print, with its haunting Gianni Ferrio theme song and atmospheric locations. Some colour fading at times and an ending that looks a little truncated. JOHNNY YUMA - again, in fabulous condition. From my point of view, these movies alone in this kind of condition made the purchase worthwhile (although I bought mine second hand via Amazon as opposed to the full price).

Other stand-outs include THE FIGHTING FIST OF SHANGHAI JOE - which reveals itself to be actually MY NAME IS SHANGHAI JOE (Il Mio Nome e Shanghai Joe) with one of Bruno Nicolai's best music scores. A shame that it's in 4:3 rather than in widescreen, but the over-the-top nasty violence (including arm splintering and eye gouging) seems intact - with a great OTT performance by Klaus Kinski.  BEYOND THE LAW - not one of my favourite spaghetti westerns (but with a great music theme by Riz Ortolani) is also in great shape in this collection, with good colour - compared to the various other releases in muddy colour and terrible framing.

DEATH RIDES A HORSE - one of my favourite spaghetti westerns - is in 'serviceable' condition here, but is in no way comparable to the official single DVD release, which is not only in pristine widescreen, but contains material that appears to have been cut from this version.

Some bummers here, as you might expect. WHITE COMMANCHE exists on other collections - and whereas the novelty value of William Shatner in a spaghetti western might draw your attention - the utterly lousy music score will put you off in the first two minutes. GUNFIGHT AT RED SANDS - with one of Ennio Morricone's first scores - is in an appalling state, looking like a video to DVD transfer ten generations removed from its original source. If this is your main attraction to this collection, look elsewhere - because it can be found in a much better state on other releases.

I haven't reviewed the other titles yet (most of which I have individually or on other collections) although I'm hopeful that the prints will be as good as the first titles I've mentioned. On that basis, I'd recommend this collection - but not at the full price requested.",1278115200,13,2968,4.766536964980545

The steely-eyed actor stars in ""Beyond The Law"", ""Death Rides A Horse"", ""God's Gun"", including an uncut version of ""Grand Duel"", the uncut version makes this film a much better movie, the plot is more in sink. These Van Cleef films are also better transfers than seen before, including widescreen versions of Grand Duel and Beyond The Law. There are a few almost unwatchable films on here, ""China 9,Liberty 37"", still remains edited and the audio is muffled on the dialogue, too bad, it's a Monte Hellman classic. ""Apache Blood"" an American film, is known as the worst film or western ever made, watch for yourself, if you can make it through it. ""Gunfight At Red Sands"", one of the first spaghetti's ever made, the transfer is butchered, like watching an old silent film, in some scenes the motion is fast, everything and everyone moves in double time. The Lee Van Cleef westerns are worth the price of admission alone, along with a few other gems, ""Johnny Yuma"", ""Minnesota Clay"", ""White Comanche"", ""The Fighting Fist Of Shanghai Joe"", a combined martial arts/western tale, look for a deranged Klaus Kinski in his usual psychotic role.

8255146,1,B0014CKCCY,"Without a doubt the worst quality DVD ever - insufferably poor quality audio & video.  Even $5 is $5 too much -- unless of course you want to experience 60's movies the way they were presented at the time on a period Zenith TV set -- including vertical lines, shaky images, blanched colors, snowing.  Seems all movies have been transferred into a 4:3 screen regardless of original aspect ratio, no pan-and-scan but simply cutting off the left and right so you end up with the lowest common denominator aspect ratio and black bars on top, bottom and both sides. Just plain awful.",1501891200,,578,4.6568627450980395
