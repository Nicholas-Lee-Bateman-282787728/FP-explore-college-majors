3506135,1,B001C4ZQFC,The viridian collection of this is not really worth getting because I tried to get this one but it always got sent back. But I don't want to discourage anyone from buying this or any other dvd in this series.,1386460800,,208,4.225

3506137,5,B001C4ZQFC,"I am a case closed fan and I could never find the seasons in stores. For a new season and for $17 (plus shipping), that's not bad as compared to the $50 I used to pay in retail stores for seasons I previously purchased..my package came in mint condition and earlier than the due date!!! I recommend, indeed! :D",1374624000,,310,4.271186440677966

3506139,4,B001C4ZQFC,"My biggest issue with the subbed version of this series by funimation is that the title song is a few seconds off from the original. It's fine in the dubbed version, which is really weird. Also I really hate the dub. It sounds phoned in with no real emotion to it. However, I really love this series. It's fun and engaging, and the story stays interesting.",1370908800,,356,4.409090909090909

3506144,5,B001C4ZQFC,"This is a excellent anime series for those who like mystery and detective series.  With the main character (Conan) being an up and coming great detective, yet forced to live in a young boy's body after he was forced to take some terrible new and experimental pill, the series becomes quite intriguing as the boy must now gather the clues and solve the crime in different ways since no one would likely believe a little kid.  Each episode is just so fun to watch as Conan somehow manages to gather all the clues, solve the crime, and bring the criminals to justice using several different methods.  It is also aways fun to try and figure out who committed the crime before Conan does.  Season 2 is just as great as the previous.  It is not too violent, and it still has all of the wonderful pieces to a great mystery/detective series.",1363046400,,833,4.490066225165563

3506161,5,B001C4ZQFC,"This was absolutely a best buy. Case Closed is one of the best shows you've never heard of and what makes it so interesting is that its a show that doesn't hold back graphic wise and provides you with complicated puzzles that make you open your mind to things you might not have thought possible. This isn't a show for you people out there that like t.v. that feeds stupidity, but if you like to be challenged then this is the show for you. Check it out, you won't be disappointed.",1316736000,,481,4.2967032967032965
3506162,5,B001C4ZQFC,"The show was awesome (especially the episodes with Harley Hartwell)  but the case was broken before I even took it out of the wrap :(  The snaps that keep it closed had completely snapped off.  Maybe they need to start printing ""Fragile"" on DVD packages......  Luckily, the discs weren't damaged, so still a good product.",1307318400,,321,4.781818181818182
3506163,5,B001C4ZQFC,This is a great anime for both children and adults.  It really makes you think and is fun while doing it.,1273536000,,105,4.0
3506164,5,B001C4ZQFC,"This was a great series, and I really enjoyed watching it.  This season seemed to have a lot dealing with Richard's past and had some humorous parts (of course, it is Case Closed).  Jimmy makes another appearance, though briefly.  There is a rival detective which adds to this show, especially since the new detective is as smart, or at least close to as smart as Jimmy",1272758400,,369,4.5606060606060606
3506175,4,B001C4ZQFC,"The dvds came in excellent condition and did not skip. However, the dvd case for discs 3 & 4 was damaged. Because of this fact, i rate this item 4 stars. No returns or exchanges will be required because i already checked out discs 3 & 4 and they work perfectly and do not skip.",1268870400,,277,4.054545454545455

8286076,5,B001C4ZQFC,the show is really great but it sucks cause they remove the tv show from american and its still running in japan,1398816000,,112,4.136363636363637
8286077,4,B001C4ZQFC,"I ordered this because I had season 1 of the Viridian Collection edition already. Unfortunately, this one does not look like it's picture. Just a matter of ascetics on my shelf, but annoying at any rate. It doesn't even say Viridian Collection on it, or have the Viridian logo.

That being said, It is still Case Closed Season 2, and at a reasonable price. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this set to the point that I watched it in two settings. Had time permitted, I would have watched it in one sitting.

I am an adult, and I am not sure how well suited this series is for your children. Read the next paragraph, and decide for yourself on that. I don't think my child is mature enough to even understand this show, but each child is different.

This is a mystery series where 3/4 or more of the episodes have to deal with murders, often showing blood and gore. Flowing blood is often shown via flowing light, but if you don't want your child to see dead bodies, then this is not for your child. The series takes a heavy nod from Sherlock Holmes, even the name the lead character chooses points at it. The clues made available to you, granted some are not in English as I recall seeing them in the season 1 Viridian Collection edition. At any rate, the crimes are quite solvable, which makes it fun to watch. That way you can try your luck at the case and see if you were right at the end of each episode. If you like murder mysteries and Anime, I can think of no better series than Case Closed.",1394582400,,1495,4.313167259786477
8286078,5,B001C4ZQFC,"AWESOME! I KNEW IT! I KNEW IT! I FREAKIN KNEW IT!!! I KNEW THIS SERIES WAS GONNA BE AWESOME AND LOOK I WAS RIGHT! I KNOW GOLD WHEN I SEE IT! I PLAN ON BUYING EVERY CASE CLOSED DVD FROM NOW ON! AND EVERYONE ELSE SHOULD, TOO! TRUST ME IT'S WORTH IT!!!",1386979200,,249,3.8076923076923075
