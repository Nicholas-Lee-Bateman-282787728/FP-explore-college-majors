7976182,4,B00007G1UN,"Brentwood's five-disc set TV TIME collection is perhaps a definitive way to watch some of TV's greatest shows on 5 DVD's and has 6 great shows:THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES,ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW,THE DICK VAN DYKE SHOW,HERE'S LUCY,PETTICOAT JUNCTION,and THE ADVENTURES OF OZZIE AND HARRIET!!!! There's a total of 42 episodes in this set,most of which are public domain episodes since none of the original distributors had renewed these shows,but a great collection of enjoyable fun,laughter,and humor with these shows!! Picture quality on most of the shows are excellent and the sound is also a perfect plus,but however,some of the shows don't contain their original theme music such as the cases for THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES,ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW,and PETTICOAT JUNCTION which are mostly replaced with generic,stock music which sounds very good compared to many cruddy VHS releases of these shows. It's an absolute must-have for any classic TV fan and that you won't be able to find some of these shows on TV Land anymore so buy it and enjoy a great collection of family-friendly shows with the TV TIME Collection!! Thank you Brentwood for putting out six great shows in one great set!!",1076716800,7,1172,5.173684210526316
