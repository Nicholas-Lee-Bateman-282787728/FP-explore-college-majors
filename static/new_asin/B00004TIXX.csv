7922510,4,B00004TIXX,"Barry is a down-to-earth guy who takes a job at the shipping department of Technoworks, a high-tech yuppie company. He gets invited to the house of his boss, Quinn, for a weekend afternoon barbecue with some of his boss's friends.

When the party gets weird, Barry plays a demented version of charades while standing on the picnic table, and the next door neighbor starts screaming racial slurs over the fence. When Jude, the widow of the ex-owner of Technoworks arrives, the plot thickens.

Clues to past crimes are revealed, and the real reason for the party is discovered, not before Barry beats the hell out of a tow-truck driver, screws the boss's wife and wreaks havok with the neighbor & as the title suggests, before the day is over, we will discover who is the felon, or perhaps the people at party are all, one way or another.",1397606400,,836,4.641891891891892
