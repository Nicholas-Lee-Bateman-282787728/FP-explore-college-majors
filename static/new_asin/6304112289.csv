781451,3,6304112289,"Elvis appeared in this lighthearted musical based on the folk song, ""Frankie and Johnny"". In the original song, the title characters are lovers whose romance goes awry when red-headed Nellie Bly steals Johnny away from Frankie. Frankie gets revenge by shooting Johnny dead. The movie lightens the tone of the tale by adding a few details and changing the downbeat ending. In the film, the song has been especially written for riverboat performers Frankie and Johnny, played by Donna Douglas (The Beverly Hillbillies) and Elvis Presley. Johnny is a gambler whose bad luck changes when dancer Nellie Bly, played by Nancy Kovak, joins the troupe aboard the riverboat. Each night, the three perform the number ""Frankie and Johnny"" onstage. As Johnny's interest in Nellie increases, so does Frankie's jealousy. One night, someone loads real bullets into Frankie's prop gun, and Johnny is shot during the performance. As luck would have it, Johnny is saved by a charm that he wears around his neck.
The film did benefit from the juicy secondary roles played by a seasoned cast of character actors which keep the film from being any less interesting. Harry Morgan, who later gained recognition on the TV series M*A*S*H played Cully the piano player. Robert Strauss, the burly villain in many crime dramas, played Blackie, the boss's stooge and Sue Ane Langdon portrayed Mitzi, the girl who is always edged out in the romance department.

781452,5,6304112289,"Like other Elvis Presley movies, he gets into fights. But he seems to have lost his luck in most of the 60's then he had starting in the mid to late 50's. As the movie opens, Johnny (Elvis Presley) is a riverboat singer and gambler nad his sining partner named Frankie (Douglas) won't marry him until he gives up gambling. So Johnny decides to end his losing gambling ways by getting help from a fortune teller. She tells him to get a lucky red head. And Johnny does find one in a redhead (Nancy Kovack).",999907200,3,504,4.315789473684211
781453,2,6304112289,"FRANKIE AND JOHNNY is better than the previous two films (TICKLE ME and HARUM SCARUM), but that doesn't mean that it succeeds on all levels.
Elvis looks quite comfortable in the costumes he wears in this  picture, but the lousy dialogue and dumb plotline are anything but  brilliant.
The songs are okay, but nothing outstanding. Only ""Please  Don't Stop Loving Me"" could succeed on it's own.
It's not as bad as  some of the other Elvis pictures of the era, but it's not an essential  addition to anyone's collection.",960768000,7,516,4.752808988764045

Elvis is a riverboat gambler and Donna Douglas (Elly Mae-Beverly  Hillbillies)is his lady love. As the headlined act (Franky & Johnny) on  the paddle-wheeled steamer they should be happy cruising the Mississippi  but Lady Luck (gambling)keeps luring Johnny (Elvis) to the roulette tables  where he loses all his money.

781665,1,6304112289,"Elvis often lamented the fact that Hollywood failed to take him seriously.  And after seeing this movie, I fully understand why.  This is one of the worst films I've ever seen.  While in some of the earlier black and white films that I've seen him star in his acting is quite convincing, in this one nobody's acting came across as skilled. Rather they all just came across as actors trying to act.  The music in it doesn't highlight Elvis' voice, either.  The plot is a little bit contrived.  And while Donna Douglas (Ellie May from the Beverly Hillbillies) is quite the beauty, the contsant stream of scantily clad showgirls flashing their legs got to be a bit overdone.  In short, there is nothing redeeming that I can say about this movie.  It is nothing but a waste of time.",1424044800,4,778,4.546762589928058

The result of them making Elvis Presley in to a contract worker who
stars every year or so with a new different starlet was that he got really
pretty bored. It shows a lot in his performances here:
the zest is gone and what is left is just work in
front of a camera. He must of felt like a piece of meat
sold to the highest bidder.

7861876,3,6304112289,"Frankie and Johnny,"" made in 1966, stars Elvis Presley (in his 20th feature film) as Johnny and Donna Douglas as Frankie, entertainers on a Mississippi riverboat. According to Frankie, Johnnys life has become one great big roulette wheel. Hes so obsessed with gambling that when a gypsy fortune teller predicts that a redhead will be his good luck charm, he sets out to find one. The problem is, Frankie is a blonde. When she sees Johnny with redhead Nellie Bly (Nancy Kovack), she decides to break off her relationship with Johnny.

Like many of Elvis Hollywood films, Frankie and Johnny looks like what it was intended to be  a slight story with enough songs to make up a best-selling soundtrack album. Elvis coasts through the movie, coming alive only when he sings one of the films eleven new songs, most undistinguished.

This was a transitional time in Elvis career. The Beatles had come onto the scene a few years earlier and were now dominating the pop charts. Though known as The King, Elvis no longer dominated rock n roll. Films like Frankie and Johnny didn't do much to shore up his diminishing influence on pop music, since the movie soundtracks failed to feature many songs that became certifiable hits.

Frankie and Johnny marked the first starring role for Donna Douglas, who was starring as Elly Mae Clampett on the hit CBS sit-com The Beverly Hillbillies at the time she made this film. Also in the cast are Harry Morgan  (M*A*S*H), Sue Ann Langdon, Robert Strauss (Stalag 17), and Jerome Cowan (The Maltese Falcon). This was the last feature film directed by Frederick De Cordova, who would go on to produce over 1,400 episodes of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.

Elvis plays a performer in a riverboat musical entertainment show, with a blond girlfriend who acts with him. Trouble is, he is a compulsive gambler in debt to a number of people on the riverboat, including his thuggish boss. Being a superstitious sort, he consults with a gypsy stationed offshore, who tells him he needs a redhead woman companion to start winning at gambling. He finds one...namely the girlfriend of his boss, and the inevitable complications come from that.

This is basically like any other such musical, meant to be amusing without pretense of deep meaning. And in that, the movie works.",1498521600,,873,4.774834437086093
