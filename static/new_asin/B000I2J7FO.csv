2651153,4,B000I2J7FO,"We've all seen the clips of Elvis on the Sullivan Shows; now we have the complete performances, in context (although the first appearance is not the full Sullivan show). There are three songs from the final show which to my knowledge have never been reshown, so that is probably enough reason for many fans/historians to purchase this set.

There's something mildly disconcerting, however, in watching the change in Elvis over that 3-4 month period. In September, 1956, he seems intent on sustaining musical integrity - the renditions are every bit as good as the records. In late October, with his hair dyed, he seems slightly detached, as if he realizes or senses that with the amazing career rise, the music is now secondary. By January, the image is everything. One of the Jordanaires hands him his guitar, he straps it on...it's just a photo opportunity - harbinger of what was to come later in the movies.

It should be noted, though, that the January show has the lesser known When My Blue Moon Turns To Gold Again; also, a version of Too Much with some different lyrics (musicologists, can you hear some of Hank Ballard & the Midnighters' Annie's Aunt Fannie on this number?); and, of course, the gospel number Peace In The Valley. It's interesting that about one month earlier he sang this song with his Sun Records friends. Maybe this rendition brought him back to a more peaceful setting.

For the record, there are brief appearances by Jackie Robinson, Sugar Ray Robinson; an energetic Carol Burnett.

Quality is very good, even on the original commercials.",1168041600,7,1569,4.865168539325842
2651154,5,B000I2J7FO,"To all those who wonder why Elvis is called the undisputed King of Rock N Roll, the proof is on these DVD's.  Just look at the mundane acts of the day and then there's Elvis bursting onto your TV screen.  The world had never seen or heard anyone quite like him before.  So he didn't write his songs or play guitar like Hendrix, no one had that voice , that look, or that uniqueness about them  - ever!  My goodness, just look at the other 1950's performers on these DVD's.  Get it?  Now get it!",1166745600,24,494,4.136842105263158

Forget the extra acts, just give us 100% Elvis.... compile all his appearances on Stage Show (Dorsey Brothers), Milton Berle, Steve Allen, and yes, Toast Of The Town with Ed Sullivan.  Now THAT would be a great collection. Much more material, and it could probably fit in the same size packaging as this set.",1166054400,8,467,4.535714285714286
2651156,5,B000I2J7FO,"For those of who weren't born when Elvis struck America, here's the undiluted wonder. You get all three complete Ed Sullivan shows from his early days. You even get the ads for Mercury cars. Besides Elvis, you get to see the rest of Ed's cast of characters. Even that Senor guy who speaks to his hand. What's amazing is that there are so few ad breaks.

The only bummer is that this is each disc only has 1 show. This could have been a 2 DVD set.

A perfect gift for the Elvis lover. Or just someone who wants to watch Ed Sullivan in a non-highlights format.",1164326400,39,558,4.205607476635514

2651201,5,B000I2J7FO,"The documentary made me cry since he was such a gifted giant and his life was cut short. I heard him on the radio in 1956 as a little kid and I recall dancing to his music. I danced the lindy again to his songs when I heard him sing on the dvd on the ed sullivan show. We didn't own a tv set since we were poor. I enjoyed watching the thrill on Mr. Sullivans face as he really admired this young boy and made him feel welcome in New York. Today people have to understand that most parents disaproved of his music. Teenagers saw and heard differently just as they were at the paramount theatre in the 1940s when frank sinatra was playing there. Teenagers found their voice. The sullivan producer made a dig at opera as if to segway to the new generation of music.  Elvis made it look simple, orchestrating his jordanaire quartet, playing the guitar, singing his heart out and revealing his emotions and he could really do a cool New Orleans stomp (and a one leg half twist)not just shake. He was a product of the mississipi delta and memphis and worked very hard to get to where he was. The Sun records founder says he was not surprised Elvis hit it bigtime and he was his most enduring star in a tribute. Elvis was humble, kind and generous but towards the end of his life his mind and talent were waisted by presription abuse. He had lost his roots. Elvis was so tolerant that his Memphis tailor, his first girlfriend and his landlord were all jewish. He was a shabbos goy. He was so special and loved as a kid winning a high school talent contest in that he convinced his taunting classmates to root for him to win the contest. I saw he looked to Ed Sullivan for approval. He  took the screams of the teens in the audience in stride and poked fun at silly young love in his facial expressions as he sang the words about love. He was a great communicator through his unique artistry.",1325116800,,1884,4.28932584269663
2651202,5,B000I2J7FO,"This DVD collection proves why Elvis was and still is The King of Rock n' Roll! The way he performed was unbelievable, nothing compared to any other musical act of his time. He revolutionized the music and performing arts world! I bought this DVD to watch Elvis, however I love the fact that the collection includes the complete shows in which he appeared AND also those cool vintage tv commercials from the time! It made me feel like I was no longer in 2011 but the 1950's. Elvis' performances were the best out of all! I also want to add, that the quality of this set is superb. Definitely a must have for any music lover.",1317600000,,624,4.387931034482759
2651203,4,B000I2J7FO,"As a fan of the early Elvis and also an amateur student of pop culture history I really enjoyed watching these DVDs. It's funny, though, that I enjoyed seeing the other entertainers more than I did Elvis. I'm 53 now and I can imagine that if I was that age when the shows were first broadcast, I would probably have dismissed Presley as some hammy goof. He performs practically every number as if it was a silly joke. The only time he actually seems to be truly involved with what he is doing is when he sings ""Peace In The Valley"" on the final show. The other acts like Ballantine the Magician and Carol Burnette seem much more respectful and sincere in trying to entertain their audience. With Elvis and his band, even the sound plays rather thin. And The Jordanaires, sheesh, they look so incongruous standing behind Presley.
For a better image of Presley and the power of his early performances, I would direct one to his appearances on The Milton Berle Show or Stage Show. But for those just wanting to know what entertainment was like in the ""old days"", I heartily recommend this set. Frankly, I wish someone would bring back the ""vaudeville"" idea to television.",1239408000,,1168,4.5933014354066986
2651204,5,B000I2J7FO,"Elvis Presley's 1956-57 appearances on ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" remain legendary in the annals of television and cultural history. After wading through home-video excerpts, we finally have a DVD set with all three Elvis programs shown in their proper context. This includes Ed's vaudevillian potpourri (ranging from impressionist Will Jordan to a young Carol Burnett) and vintage Lincoln Mercury commercials. Nevertheless, it is Elvis who rocks the house whenever he takes the stage. By the final show, Presley assumes full command in his ""waist up"" performances of ""Don't Be Cruel,"" ""Too Much"" and a stirring ""Peace in the Valley."" However, pay close attention to the September 1956 broadcast, with Charles Laughton substituting for the injured Sullivan. The British actor proved a better host than ""Old Stone Face"" and treated Elvis with more respect: ""It has been many a year since any young performer has captured such a wide and, as we heard tonight, devoted audience.""",1221264000,2,972,5.27741935483871
2651205,5,B000I2J7FO,"Elvis Presley made no less than nine network television appearances before performing on ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" the evening of September 9, 1956, but most of America first saw him then. Despite a stiff demeanor and tendency to pronounce show as ""shoe,"" Sullivan was the ringmaster of American entertainment. His Sunday night variety program was an institution in the days when television was still a three channel proposition. Appearing on his show was an important break for any entertainer. It was tantamount to receiving the show business seal of approval.

But Sullivan originally did not approve of Presley and vowed he wouldn't touch the singer with a ten foot pole. Despite selling more records faster than any recording artist in history, Presley was more than hot. He was scorching. The swivel hips that earned him the nickname ""Elvis the Pelvis"" (which he despised, calling it ""childish"") and his expressive singing style made him a lightning rod of controversy. One journalist compared his stage act to that of a stripper. However, when Presley appeared on ""The Steve Allen Show"" which was scheduled opposite Sullivan on Sunday nights, the ratings went through the roof. Sullivan reversed himself and offered Presley a then record $50,000 to make three appearances on his show.

Just how shocking Presley was in 1956 was never apparent in the frequently recycled clips of his performances. Now, thanks to Image Entertainment's 3 disc DVD set, ""Elvis: The Ed Sullivan Show,"" his performances can be seen in their proper context.

Ironically, a car accident prevented Sullivan from being present that first night. Charles Laughton, the brilliant British stage and screen actor (and husband of Elsa Lanchester, ""The Bride of Frankenstein""), was the guest host that night, kicking off the proceedings by reading some poetry followed by limericks. The Brothers Amin, an acrobatic act, came next, then Dorothy Sarnoff performed a song from Broadway's ""The King and I."" After a commercial, Laughton, standing before a wall of Presley's gold records, introduced the man whom a record 55 million viewers tuned in to see.

Wearing a plaid jacket and a guitar slung over his chest like a machine gun, Presley blasts his way into ""Don't Be Cruel"" and it's a little like Moses parting the Red Sea. Prior to Elvis, entertainment didn't have to be rated with letters signifying what age group should be permitted to watch. Families watched TV and listened to music the same way they went to the movies: together. Now Elvis came to drive them apart.

Teenagers love him, of course, especially the girls, and what was there not to like? Handsome, but in a way men had not been before; threatening, yet still somehow tame, as if his mask of menace was only meant to conceal a wounded heart. He is, after all, very well-mannered, saying ""Yes, sir"" and thanking ""Mr."" Laughton. What was one to make of this guy with the unusual name, the pompadour, and the long sideburns?

""He just does this,"" Ed Sullivan would say while shaking his body on the October 28 show, ""and everybody yells."" Presley looked a little more sinister this time in his dark suit, and he offers reprises of ""Don't Be Cruel,"" ""Love Me Tender,"" and ""Hound Dog"" while also introducing one of his sultriest numbers, ""Love Me.""

What did Dorothy Sarnoff think? And Senor Wences, who was on the bill the same night Presley appeared a second time?

Clearly, show business had been rocked into a new dimension.

His third and final appearance for Sullivan came on January 6, 1957 on a show that also featured Carol Burnett, one of the few stars whose wattage would increase in future years. By now, the country was clearly divided into two camps: those who championed the King of Rock and Roll, and those who condemned him. Sullivan was now in the former, surprising audiences and Elvis himself by proclaiming him a ""good,decent boy.""

But there was no turning back. Soon, people would be talking about the ""generation gap"" and, later, ""youth culture."" The gap would widen in the `60s with even Presley taking his place among the old guard, but the gap started here. With the release of Elvis-The Ed Sullivan Show on DVD, it's now possible to properly assess the earth shaking impact Presley had in the more innocent era of the 1950's.

2651250,5,B000I2J7FO,"The point of these DVD's is the ground-breaking appearances by ELVIS on the Sullivan Show.  To understand these performances in the context of what popular entertainment was like in 1956-57 you need only watch the entire programs.  Elvis was so different than what TV viewers were used to seeing on the Sullivan Show that it created a major controversy that manifested itself in the final appearance by only shooting Elvis from the waist up.

Besides the Elvis appearances it's interesting to see how slowly these programs moved and how few commercials there were.  Those commercials were usually done live and look almost prehistoric.
