8016214,2,B0001SYKZC,"I have to say I feel misled. When I received the DVD, the all important clue words - that are hidden online - are, ""Intermediate Level For Boomers."" Please keep in mind that the best Pilates instructor I've ever had was over 50 and I've had a rebounder since before it was even called an ""urban rebounder."" To me, this is a good workout for someone 55+ starting out a fitness regime. But for those of us who are looking for a more comprehensive workout (one that coordinates arm-toning with footwork) it falls short. And, the preview to the actual workout is way too long...even fast-forward doesn't get through it fast enough. The production is like a cheesy home movie, not living up to the cost. But Blanche did cause me to break a sweat!",1253577600,9,741,4.496296296296296
8016215,2,B0001SYKZC,The exercise routines are ok. The reason I am giving only 2 stars is because the CD itself is not a good quality. I even returned the other one unopened.,1237766400,8,153,4.133333333333334
8016216,5,B0001SYKZC,For me this is a great way to lose weight. I am 71 and can exercise at my speed. It is great.,1233014400,8,93,3.272727272727273
8016217,5,B0001SYKZC,"I love this work out - it's just the right length for me and she is very inspiring to watch.  If you don't like these workouts that have manic people making you work beyond your limit  - Blanche is the answer.
It's also nice to see her workout outside and the music is not overpowering - but a good beat to workout by.
Rebounding has such good health effects that you just might lose those extra pounds too.",1212969600,25,407,4.205128205128205
