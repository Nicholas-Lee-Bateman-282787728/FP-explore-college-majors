8611792,5,B00F2SRR8I,"The reason I gave this a five star rating was because of the excellent customer service.  Anyone who has bought foreign TV shows can tell you getting anyone to respond or help is next to impossible.  This was the exact opposite.  They responded immediately and helped me try to fix the problem
Okay now for the product review.  The English subtitles are extremely large which isn't a bad thing for me because it helps my parents see them better.  The translation is a bit bumpy.  They sometimes don't exactly translate word for word which can cause some of the jokes to fall flat.  However if you don't understand Korean at all you wouldn't be able to tell.  The story gets told just as it's supposed to be.  I've bought DVD sets that seem like a dislexic caveman translated it.  This is not the case with these DVDs.  Another drawback is that advertisements occasionally scroll across the screen.  Similar to what they do on American TV.  So i suggest you question the seller if this is on the DVDs your about to buy. Like i said though.  I would definitely buy from this seller again.  They gave me other options and refunded a small amount of my money.  This is an excellent TV series.  Has you balling one moment and giggling the next.  Story, characters, sets are all remarkable.  Buy it.  You won't regret it.  This seller has this DVD set available without the advertisements and clearer pictures.",1428451200,,1404,4.603238866396761

8611796,3,B00F2SRR8I,"Sohwa is sold to a courtesan house after her father was framed as a traitor by her father's acquaintance, Jo Kwangung. Her brother and her close servant are sold into slavery. They plan an escape and Sohwa only survives because she's rescued by a 1,000 year old nine-tailed fox named, Wolyong.

Wolyong falls in love with her and decides he wants to be human. The Gu Family Book is the key for the line of nine-tailed foxes to become human. However, there are a few difficult and strict rules to follow. If Wolyong fails, he becomes a demon for 1,000 years. Eleven days before he becomes human, he shows his true form in order to save his love. But Sohwa is horrified and thinks of him as a monster. She betrays him and Jo Kwangung sends his men to kill him.

After his death, Sohwa finds out she is pregnant. She gives birth to her baby boy and leaves him with a monk, who will find a home for him where he can grow up as a human. Feeling guilt, anger, and regret for what she did, she tries to kill Jo Kwangung, only to be struck down by one of his men.

About 20 years later, the next story begins with their son, Kangchi. He has a good life surrounded by loved ones, until Jo Kwangung shows up and destroys their lives. Shortly after, he finds out from a monk that he is half demon. Kangchi is at a loss at what to do, until the tomboyish, Youl, helps him find his way. He ends up falling in love with her and wants to become human. But is history doomed to repeat itself?

This drama was okay in the beginning, but it got better as the show progressed. The story is interesting and is filled with action, romance, and magic. There are even surprises and twists in the story.

There are some things that I didn't care for though. Some of the special effects are not that great and look a bit outdated. Though there are really good actors in the show, some of their acting in certain scenes was a little bad. The extras and very minor characters acting was completely horrendous. The crying, yelling, shocked looks, ect... from them was so fake, it brought down the show a bit. I know they're not professionals, and are a very minor part of the story, (They are shown more frequently in this drama though.) but I've never seen such terrible acting. It was distracting. But if you can look past these things, then the show can be pretty entertaining. (Especially with k-pop stars in it.)

I had mixed feelings on the ending. There were things I hated about it and things I liked. But there was some sad, some unexpected, and some funny things in the end. I recommend giving this show a try. (24 episodes)",1389139200,,2606,4.3408624229979464
