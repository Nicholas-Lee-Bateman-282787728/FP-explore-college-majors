7972302,2,B00006LPBD,"I don't understand why Amazon even bothers to list this item if it isn't going to tell you what movies it includes.

I was curious so I looked on another site selling the same product.  According to that site, the movies (on 5 double-sided DVDs) include:  ""SLIPSTREAM (PG-13), ABRAXAS (R), CREATURE (R), LASER MISSION (R), ALIEN SPECIES (Not Rated), EYES BEHIND THE STARS (Not Rated), COSMOS: WAR OF THE PLANETS (Not Rated), VOYAGE TO A PREHISTORIC PLANET (Not Rated), THEY CAME FROM BEYOND SPACE (Not Rated), and WAR OF THE ROBOTS (Not Rated).""

I'm not familiar with any of these films and I don't know their release dates.  Also, according to the box cover, the movies collectively feature Brandon Lee, Ben Kingsley, F. Murray Abraham, Mark Hamill, Jesse Ventura and Ernest Borgnine, amonst others.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of this information.",1096848000,12,865,4.972222222222222
