2386195,5,B000ADWD16,This was a replacement video for my son. The variety of shows on the video are great. He really enjoys the video. I would recommend this video to anyone who has small children. The price and turn around time to get the video was great.,1261958400,,235,4.2444444444444445
2386196,5,B000ADWD16,My grandkids loves this assortment of Nick Jr. favorites....so much that I'm getting sick of it.,1217548800,3,96,5.0625
2386197,5,B000ADWD16,"My kiddos (2 and 4) LOVE Little Bill, Blue's Clues and Dora.  It's great to get them all on one DVD.  Particularly, Little Bill.  They are crazy about Little Bill and relate well to his ""problems"" and the solutions he finds.  I also find that there is never anything objectionable in Little Bill or Blues Clues episodes(unlike, say, Dora sometimes).

It is a shame that this gentle, parent-friendly, tv show is off the air and also not available on DVD. We love Little Bill in this house and we've bought all the sampler DVDs just to get him!",1155081600,11,542,4.489795918367347
2386198,4,B000ADWD16,"This is the second Nick Jr. Favorites release, featuring according to the cover, ""six super adventures""

The stuff on here is mostly good. Lazytown features ""Sleepless in LazyTown,"" a great story in which Robbie Rotten tries to deprive Sportacus of sleep. A fun, high-energy show that really accomplishes its goal.

Blue's Clues has ""Pajama Party"" in which a special pajama party is held at the Blue's Clue's house. A classic Steve episode.

Little Bill, a show don't get to watch nearly as often as I'd like has ""Little Bill's Great Space Adventure."" Little Bill is tired of always being told he's too small, so he makes up a story in which his being small saves the day. Featuring the cute little green alien Max and Little Bill's hero Captain Brainstorm.

The Backyardigans episode is ""The Quest for the Flying Rock."" Uniqua, Tasha, Pablo and Tyrone all compete to reach a mystical flying rock. Great music and songs and concept as well.

The other two shows on here are Dora the Explorer (""Super Map"") and Max and Ruby (""Ruby's Lemonade Stand / Ruby's Rummage Sale / Ruby's Magic Act."") I don't really think much of either show, but I know they're kinda popular, particularly Dora.

There are no special features on this DVD, unfortunately. However, everything is close-captioned and the sound and picture quality are great.",1138492800,46,1328,4.88
