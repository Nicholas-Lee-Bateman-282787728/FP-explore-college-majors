3172994,4,B0017IVHHO,"I disagree with the previous reviews about this re-make being so terribly bad. The first half did promise more than was delivered, and there was indeed quite a lot of 'fluff' added - some of which could (should?) have been left out to say, develop the main characters. This was obviously a very ambitious undertaking and made an honest effort to address a *few* issues facing science and society today - which few films really do anymore, at least in the vein of the original film.

 I enjoyed and appreciated the environmental overtones of the re-make, and this ultimately seems to be the main message of this version. I was a kid when I saw the original version, and it stired my imagination and great interest in science - I am guessing while fans of the original film (and the book) may be critical of this version, it WILL have the same effect on a new generation of younger viewers.",1211932800,5,888,4.54375
3172995,1,B0017IVHHO,"I had hi hopes for this film and was really let down. The first half was actually rather good and stuck to the book and the first, and MUCH better movie, quite well with a bit added into it that turned out in the second half to be VERY irrelevant.
The second half of this was the exact opposite of the first half. It was at best sophomoric. I honestly believe that a child could have written it with all the silly and unnecessary plot takes and so called twists and the outright silliness that it all turned into.
It was a total waste of time as it takes a great story and turns it into a joke.",1211932800,6,594,4.0423728813559325
3172996,1,B0017IVHHO,"First, the good: on DVD, you wouldn't need to sit through the hour's worth of commercials that A&E peppered the broadcast with. And the first half of the miniseries actually hung together fairly well, if you ignore a few details, like the junkie reporter who seemed to be able to just stroll into a military operation with his crew, and the Evil Government chess pieces who do all but cackle madly into the camera.

Now, the bad: trust me, the other reviewers are spot-on when they say that the second half of this miniseries fell apart. We get the reporter chased across the desert for a bit of meaningless drama that contributes nothing to the plot. We get a dollop of subterranean romance, and you just *know* when the cliches get rolling that The Kiss is going to be interrupted by A Disaster. When some characters die, it becomes apparent how poorly they were developed; you'll shrug and say ""who cares?"" The Andromeda strain is a nasty bug, all right, but how about that Evil Government (where's Austin Powers when you need him)? And a TIME TRAVEL PARADOX?! Why, for the love of Crichton, WHY?!!

This is the sort of film that just embarrasses science fiction fans. Read the book, or watch the original movie, but give this stinker a miss.",1211932800,12,1245,4.6289592760181
3172997,2,B0017IVHHO,"I have to give this adaption some credit for creating a new plot that explains the origin of the Andromeda strain. I thought the time travel idea was explained reasonably well enough, but the whole thing got just a bit too silly for my own taste. By the end of the movie, it is left as a time travel paradox. The original movie had some logical lapses, but it was so enthralling. This adaption doesn't have the chilling self-destruct sequence of the original: instead, it delivers something pretty silly. The real climax of the adapation is not the self-destruct sequence, but more conspiracies and coverups.

One viewing on TV is enough for me. If I decide to buy a DVD, I'll get the one for the original movie, maybe along with 'OUTBREAK', which is a pretty good effort in the 'germ disaster' genre.",1211932800,2,801,4.601398601398602
3172998,3,B0017IVHHO,"I am a huge fan of the 1971 version of ""The Andromeda Strain.""  It was in it's day a technological marvel, a very egdy sci-fi movie that still keeps me on the edge of my seat.  I really looked forward to watching this A&E remake and stayed up to watch it both nights.  The first 2 hour installment was promising and had a great take on the scientific side of the story.  The computers used in the movie were fascinating.  I was also intrigued by their interpretation of how the virus affects humans.  The Utah angle was the same from the original (even though it wasn't filmed in Utah!) and I liked the updated storyline that involved Homeland Security and the Utah National Guard.  Okay, day two.  The second evening of the mini-series went down hill fast.  I had a hard time keeping up with the plot twists, and the explanations for those twists were rather weak.  Considering all the extra time spent developing the story in this mini-series, it was disappointing to see them rush through to the end.  The final scenes make little sense in conjunction with the rest of the movie.  And the very last parting blow was the paradox (that I won't discuss in case you haven't seen it.)  Let me say that it was just plain dumb.  It is worth renting, and I will probably buy it just to compare it to the original because I'm a sucker, but the 1971 version is a must-see.  This one is only a it-might-be-nice-see.",1211846400,5,1407,4.44140625
3172999,1,B0017IVHHO,"This was a remake trajedy.  As an Andromeda Strain fan, I had to watch this miniseries.  It is painfully obvious that the writer of this version knows very little science and wasn't interested in research.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone.",1211846400,11,250,4.767441860465116
3173000,1,B0017IVHHO,While I did quite enjoy the first half of the Andromeda strain. I felt like the whole series just gets lost in the last hour or so. There is the addition of en entire temporal paradox that is left completely unexplained and only alluded to in the end. Their are some piss poor decision made by the decision makers like Doctor Barton risking the fate of the entire planet because her family is threatened. The whole self destruct sequence is far to cliche and the deaths and meaningless and pointless. In short that was a very enjoyable miniseries loses it's way in it's closing moments and becomes something not worth watching.,1211846400,6,627,4.657657657657658
3173001,1,B0017IVHHO,"How deadly is the Andromeda Strain?  Deadly enough to kill almost everything on the planet just by watching it.

Let me first admit that I've not read the original book, nor seen the original movie.  That puts me at a disadvantage to someone who's already been exposed to this tale twice already.  However, it also means I'm approaching this miniseries with a blank slate.

And frankly, it also leaves me wondering just how dated (or just plain bad) the original book would have to be to inspire a miniseries as horrendous as this.

Take every previous ""outbreak"" style movie ever made and mash them together.  Put the action inside a ""secure"" underground facility on top of a nuclear bomb (oooh, ahhhh) with an automatic lockdown-and-self-destruct trigger.  Give them computers and technology that exceed the best of Star Trek.  Throw in a humourless Fox Mulder as your totally spurious investigative reporter.  Come up with a magic solution to this insanely overpowered threat, engineer a pointless ""disarm the bomb with seconds to spare"" sequence, make some nebulous moral statements about preserving natural resources, and wrap it all up with a pointless implied time loop.

That's the Andromeda Strain in a nutshell.

How secure is this amazing wonder-facility?  So secure that you can break between levels (supposedly impossible) with a screwdriver and a fire extinguisher.

How effective is the safeguard to ensure nobody but the designated man can turn off the self-destruct in the case of a real emergency?  So effective that they can take his badge and his thumb to do it without him -- but not before the less-liked scientist can nobly (and pointlessly) sacrifice himself by jumping in the radioactive water to cut it off.

These kinds of hackneyed plot elements are chained one after another, creating what could almost be a parody of the entire genre, if only they didn't take themselves so seriously.  The Andromeda Strain gleams with a shiny 2008 visual polish, but inside this apple is a core so old and rotten that it's not worth watching even just to laugh at it.

Then there's the show's annoying habit of showing us various things while the characters speculate about them.  They talk about bacteria found at the bottom of the sea, and we're whisked away from the conversation to go look at some vague footage of deep-sea rocks.  They talk about speculation as to what happened to their satellite, and now we're watching low-grade CGI of said satellite flying along, then shuddering and falling to earth.  ""Remember that fire?"" they say, and we're back in the outbreak town, looking at a burning car.  None of these scenes actually reveal anything, and so they end up being awkward and almost insulting, as if the producers thought their audience would have no imagination and would need to see everything to understand or remember it.

All in all, I'm thinking this is going to be the ""Must-Not-Have"" miniseries of 2008.  There's just too much wrong, and almost nothing right.

(Oh, and by the way, Australia got this series over a month ago, and Britain saw it a few weeks ago as well.  Check release dates before you say that someone can't possibly have watched the entire show yet.)",1211760000,20,3206,4.901669758812616

If you read the book, I would highly recommend watching the 1870 movie starring James Olson and Arthur Hill, among other classic character actors (David Wayne, Kate Reid, etc).  I do not want to even bother saying another word of this TV mini-series remake, it was a complete wasted effort.

3173009,1,B0017IVHHO,"One should always beware of remakes, but in this case, one should run away at warp speeds. The original 1971 classic (Dir: Robert Wise) was extremely advanced for its time, and even after more than 40 years, it still holds up as a tight, beautifully-filmed, intelligent sci-fi thriller. To call this mini-series ""schlock"" is to insult even the worst films ever made.

Taking Michael Crichton's original book and vivisecting nearly everything that made it worth reading, this waste of nearly four hours of your life gives little to nothing in return. The creators of this Frankensteinian monster inserted numerous irrelevant ""plot points,"" wasted precious time on extraneous new story ideas (a down-and-out reporter who sniffs a story, irrelevant interpersonal melodrama, equally irrelevant political maneuvering, and a completely incorrect assumption that a dog survives the disease long enough to escape town and potentially spread the disease), and perhaps worst of all insults the viewer's intelligence with ridiculously overdone high-tech toys, inane dialog, and an attempt to make ""action sequences"" and blood-and-gore effects an integral part of the story telling. Michael Bay couldn't have done a worse job, and that's saying something.

The film bodes ill from the beginning, as the composer for the soundtrack resorted to stealing the ""Dies Irea"" from the fifth movement of Berlioz's ""Symphony Fantastique"" -- a staple used so often in 50s horror films that it warns you in advance that this whole production is going to be poor. We then waste precious viewing time establishing a series of ridiculous relationships, eliminating the names of all primary characters save for Jeremy Stone, thus underlining that the producers want to make something ""different,"" and presenting us with irrelevant background for the various conspiracy sub-plots that have no purpose, add nothing, and in fact detract severely from the primary focus of the story.

Our scientific team is glib, lifeless, highly-technical without really coming across as intelligent, and worst of all, they seem incurious. Any real scientist facing this kind of situation, would be bright, shining, his eyes dancing with wonder and curiosity, despite the horrific consequences of the organism that he's studying. These people behave as if nothing unusual is going on, that they are mere fact-takers; there is no seeming flash of genius to make the quantum leaps of possibility that lead to real discovery. It's lackluster and boring; the lab equipment has greater emotional depth than these characters.

Minus-points are given particularly for a short sequence where we're forced to watch a still-breathing animal (rabbit?) being slowly swallowed head-first by a large snake. Pardon the pun, but that's just plain tasteless and singularly unnecessary.

This remake is truly horrifying, in terms of the cost of money, man-hours of production, and waste of the viewer's time. Crichton died late in 2008, the year this tripe was produced; one may only assume that he needed the money, but it's a shame that his name has to be sullied by association. Go see the original -- shorter by about half, it has a hundred times the brilliance and power of this travesty of a great novel.",1441152000,4,3245,5.2810077519379846

2)  Benjamin Bratt?  Scientist?  Really?  Talk about miscasting.

3)  Bangs, booms, and gunfire?  Interesting, the original was a scientific thriller...not an action movie.

4)  Dirt Nazi hyperbole and thinly veiled propagandizing made this film about as painful to watch as the ""remake"" of The Day the Earth Stood Still.""

5)  Just...bad.  Very bad.

This remake is so much more visually interesting than what I remember of the 1971 film, all I remember of that was endless, boring orange corridors-not a fun pic. I can understand some reservations about dialogue and scientific credibility but this is science fiction...meant to be entertaining.
I enjoyed the updated technology and the added textures of conflicting agendas with the environmentalists and mining the thermal vents and the government efforts to control all. Very true to life. Seems like maybe it was edited for time which resulted in a compression in some character arcs; Nash's and the love interest which should have been dropped altogether or add an extra hour to develop and give us some meat on these bones.

This is just another science based movie where all the scientists are in their late 20's and early thirties yet are the leading experts in their field.

The film was in serious need of an upgrade, and while the new technology really enhanced the film, making it all the more believable, the updates to the story along with the new characters that were introduced, really did the original story a disservice. The basic story was not changed, just modernized, and for that we are very thankful. The story was always a terrific tale of Science Fiction and an early message about the damage we are doing to our planet. I like how the story was updated and I loved the technological advancements. What I didn't like was how much they changed the cast. They wanted to make them more diverse and I don't have a problem with that, but this is not a story that focuses on individuals, it's more about the virus, the technology, and the human impact on our planet. In that sense, I felt it hurt the series, but the technology enhanced it, evening things out. The original novel and movie were 4 stars, and so is the remake.

However, I particularly dislike the time wasted with the boring army conspiracy. And as for the environmental message, it feels a bit forced into the plot, probably should have been introduced more smoothly early in the story, but in the end, this new plot fully reflects Chricton's everlasting concerns with modern society inability to deal adequately with the environment and the unintended consequences of new technologies.

The original 1971 movie was more of a thriller albeit with the science fiction-ish story. However, the newer 2008 version is still an okay relatively good TV movie. Well, good for TV and cable TV in particular since this 2008 version was made for the A&E Channel on cable. But not as good as the original 1971 theatrical movie. There seems to be more of a political conspiracy going on with the new version. The president in the new version is like a younger better version of George W. Bush. Was the virus bug thingie really from outer space? Well, yeah it came down in that crashed satellite. Was it alien? Well, you could say no in part but you can say yes because you don't know where it really came from and how humans first got it. You got some time travel talk in this and I don't remember that in the original movie. But then again, it's been a while since I've seen the original movie. And then there's the constant phone calling to outside to family, reporters, etc. WTF? I thought they could only talk to whoever is in charge and maybe family via monitored calls? But it's like the head scientist dude has the guard on the surface put his cell phone up to the computer so he can call a reporter. What a breach of security. People actually do get fired for things like that. Oh well, I guess that means it can happen in real life and therefore in a TV movie also. And I thought that they said something to the effect that civilians in the outside world couldn't call into the underground lab - but later, a spouse of one of the main characters calls in. Well if that wasn't possible then a certain (minor) plot point wouldn't occur. Well, this is television. Good mindless television entertainment and that isn't all that bad.

3173062,1,B0017IVHHO,"The second attempt at bringing Michael Crichton's novel, ""The Andromeda Strain"", to the screen is an interesting conundrum to ponder - not in terms of the film itself, which is very bad - but in terms of the differences in tone between it and it's predecessor.

1971's original big-screen outing (directed by Robert Wise) was a weirdly compulsive tale of a group of predominantly white, predominately middle-aged and elderly research virologists doing battle with a mysterious extra-terrestrial virus inadvertently unleashed on a small Californian town by a downed Satellite. Set predominantly in a sealed underground research bunker which could be cauterized by a Nuclear blast should the threat of contamination become too great, the film boast a cast of virtual unknowns, a weirdly atonal electronic score by Gil Mell, an uncomfortably claustrophobic, tense atmosphere and some splendid use of abstract shot-framing and split-screen. There was very little in the way of action, big explosions and histrionics and it remains a faithful adaptation of Crichton's book (which, if you've never read it, is one of his best and one of the most splendidly ominous and worryingly authentic first-contact novels ever written.)

This made for TV remake was apparently co-produced by Tony and Ridley Scott, but given it's tone and timbre, it might just as well have been produced by Michael Bay.

And I don't mean that as a compliment.

From the outset, the audience is beaten over the head with CGI and bombast; the research virologists are now all forty and under, impossibly good-looking and fit and of a racial mix hardly seen outside of Benetton commercials; Humvees seem to cram the frame every two minutes; gunfire and explosions break out with sporadic abandon and we are treated to more impassioned histrionics that one would generally expect to see in an episode of ""The Bold And The Beautiful"" - seriously, I kept waiting for Ridge to stagger through the bunker (which seems to be perpetually lit like the chill-out room of a nightclub) and demand to see Stephanie and Taylor.

Oh yeah, then there's the virus itself. It's no longer just an extra-terrestrial virus - now its also sentient, telepathic and has come through a wormhole from the future. Nanotechnology, which is fast acquiring the irritancy and, one assumes, will acquire the obsolescence factor that Virtual Reality helmets did in the nineties, also crops up *yawn*

There's also, wouldn't you know it, a big army conspiracy behind the whole thing which is hunting your obligatory drug-addled, wise-guy journalist (played by Eric McCormack from ""Will And Grace"" - who looks so out of place that I kept wishing that Jack McFarland would turn up and comfort him at his 'mannary'), a character that is completely extraneous in terms of the story.

There's also the worrying hint at the end that the producers may be contemplating a sequel.

In every way bigger, louder and brasher than it's predecessor, this film is also vastly dumber and more irritating. One day, maybe producers will realize that in the case of source material which is this good, you don't need extraneous trappings; just good actors, a decent script and a director who knows where to point a camera.",1254009600,8,3234,5.065789473684211

In this case the interesting element is the method used to take over, and clean up the planet of the human race that is kind of in the way. They use the curiosity of this human race and infiltrate a satellite that is devised to capture living and unknown extraterrestrial organisms or substances. It does crop one substance hat is living but with no DNA. That substance will cause the satellite to crash back on the earth, without being in any way damaged, which is quite hard to believe today. This satellite will be recuperated by some people in a close-by city, opened and the substance will spread and kill everyone except an alcoholic who uses methylated spirit to satisfy his thirst and a new-born baby. The objective is to cause an overreaction among the human collective body called society and for them humans to try to destroy this invading substance with a nuclear missile. And that's the trick. This substance is fed by nuclear radiations or feeds on nuclear radiations. This fact is discovered by the scientists who are trying to understand the phenomenon, the counter order is given to the pilot delivering the missile and she turns back, but it is too late: the substance had already invaded the plane and it took control of it and the missile will eventually reach its target and humanity will be destroyed entirely. All that because of the human vain belief that one single invention, destructive substance or mechanism can be supreme and destroy everything, which is false, and we know it, since cockroaches for one are not at all disturbed in their very busy life by nuclear radiations. What is surprising is that this film, done for TV, should be so poor on the characters as if television did not have the means to hire good authors, directors and actors any more. Too bad, indeed.

About an hour in, the screenwriter, director and producers decide to pile in some of the usual Hollywood cheese: military conspiracies, government double-dealing and conspiracy, and an almost omnipotent hit man.

Carried off with style, this might still work (Ex: ""Three Days of the Condor,"" ""The Pelican Brief"" and ""The China Syndrome"" -- liberal causes all, but still fun). There is no style here.

It gets more preposterous the longer it runs.

When ""The Andromeda Strain"" sticks to Crichton, it's riveting and believable, with an ending that made sense, because Crichton did his homework. But the writers of this version didn't do their homework. Result: When it goes out on its own, which it mostly does, it's just absurd.

As we know, a killer virus escapes into our world devastating a town sans one old drunk and one healthy newborn.  With conspiracy afoot, a topnotch group of scientists dwell into it's secrets hoping to stop the spread of a potential doomsday machine.

Toss the book out: this 3 hour film takes the basic premise and runs wild with it.

There was not necessarily room for improvement, but additional layers could have been added to the growing menace of a team of isolated scientists attempting to identify a deadly alien virus that has landed on earth.

I was genuinely looking forward to this 2008 TV miniseries remake, especially with Ridley and Tony Scott serving as executive producers. Sadly, as the film played out, I realized with intense frustration the filmmakers had no confidence in the source material. I was aghast and mortified at the dramatic license taken. Multiple subplots were added above ground (the scientists are isolated in an underground government lab), including a TV reporter attempting to uncover the plot, a governmental conspiracy stretching to the Pentagon and an accidental nuclear explosion. In addition, the virus now causes victims to become homicidal maniacs. This film is a perfect example of modern-day filmmakers having complete disrespect for today's audiences.

It's ironic that the only good moments in this film are those below ground where the team of scientists attempt to understand the virus (the only scenes faithful to the original). The additional fluff is derivative and uninspired. There is not a moment of believability in the new subplots and after the first two hours, most viewers familiar with the source material will be profoundly insulted. Filmmakers, including director Mikael Salomon and writer Robert Schenkkan, made a conscious choice to add violence, explosions and second-rate soap opera in an attempt to appeal to what they believe is a dumb audience interested in such crap. They have purposefully moved the action out of the laboratory and away from the scientific process in order to create tired action movie dramatics.

There's some good actors in this cast, Benjamin Bratt, Rick Schroder and Andre Braugher, but their roles are so weak they eventually disappear in the mindless subplots lifted from other, better films. Sadly, the original ""The Andromeda Strain"" has been cheapened by this shockingly bad miniseries, which steers for clumsy thrills rather than suspense. This is one of the worst films I have ever seen, an unspeakable waste of three hours of my life.

I've decided to re-watch the original film to wash away the depressing stench of this atrocious remake. On every level, this is an insulting, terrible production.",1230163200,10,3277,6.373873873873874

Beyond the accuracy to the original, this movie stands out, and I thought was highly memorable and exceptional sci-fi.  I thought it was incredibly well cast, acted, written and put together.  This is probably the best thing I've seen Benjamin Bratt in.  Rick Shroeder and Andre Braugher also gave memorable performances, as did the entire cast.  There were a few leaps in logic in the story, such as the civilian reporter escaping from an armed guard in a helicopter with just a fire extinguisher, and bringing it down, and then having the helo explode for no apparent reason.

The story made no sense. No sense. I understood where they were TRYING to take it, but they wove so many conflicting (and irrelevant) plotlines into it that I just couldn't bring myself to care. It was like Mystery Science Theatre 3000 in my house watching this thing- we were laughing every time they tried to do something dramatic.

They steal tired plot twists and basic subplots from every cliche source possible and then bash them together until the thing is utterly predictable and kind of just sad. Broken family, pointlessly evil military types, news reporter guy who you keep thinking will serve a purpose in the plot but NEVER DOES, barely fleshed out conspiracy theory that just gets left hanging, blackmail of agent via her family, people committing suicide to ""save"" their comrades when there was no feasible reason except that the director wanted some suicide in there, and a guy that falls in some water and just dies for some reason.

3173092,2,B0017IVHHO,"Man, you hate to say it, but watching this modern Andromeda Strain remake is a bit like watching Wayne Newton in concert-- not much raw talent, but he's trying so gosh darn HARD to entertain you. If enthusiasm was ability, this remake would be 5 stars. Unfortunately, it's not, and it's not.

Instead of being the taught, direct, minimalist thriller the original was, this one takes a 'kitchen sink' approach. We've got space wormholes (yes, you read that right), terrorism and 9/11 references, inter-military intrigue, a crack investigative reporter with a drug problem (of course), gratuitous assassinations, radical environmentalism, common-sense environmentalism, divorce, parenting issues, nationalistic tensions within the scientific team, romantic tensions within the scientific team, rampant politics, and *gasp* the President's wife in peril!!!

It's kind of like going camping with absolutely everything you own... seemed like a good idea on paper, but seldomly works out that way in practice. Especially when everything is as Hollywooded-up as it is here.

Sadly, the one thing this Andromeda Strain does NOT have is a legitimate sense of tension. The focus is just too diluted, too many things are going on, many of them not too consequential. As a result, even with the long running time, many of the goings on have to communicated purely verbally, in tossed-off one-liners, said with little or no emotion backing them. The characters don't seem to much care, so neither do we.

There's also a big fat strain of the ridiculous and random in some of the sideplots... such as when an eagle uber-conveniently drops an Andromeda-diseased mouse at the feet of some National Guard troops. Or how about the ridiculousness of the whole 'space wormhole from the future' explanation for Andromeda? Sometimes it's better when things go UN-explained, especially when you want the audience to suspend disbelief, but I guess that particular note never made it to the powers-that-be on this one.

It also doesn't help that the cast seems mostly just as Hollywooded-up as the proceedings. Sure, a few of the actors in the cast, notably Ricky Schroeder, McCormack, Andre Braugher, and the unknown-but-quite-good Viola Davis, attempt to inject some sense of humanity (or at least style, in Braugher's case) and urgency into their characters and the goings-on, but they're largely defeated by the stilted and occasionally just plain weird dialogue. For example, just LISTEN to Benjamin Bratt's estranged wife speak early on... you will say over and over again to yourself, ""No one talks like this... NO ONE...""

Oh, and speaking of Ben Bratt as the focal character, he's fairly inert, in the way that many hunky heroes tend to be inert in any kind of complex drama. The fact that he's ethnic doesn't really make it any more interesting.

Also, a big shudder goes out to the normally cute and interesting Christa Miller (of 'Drew Carey' and 'Scrubs' fame). In this miniseries, she appears to be either savagely over-botoxed, or the victim of an unfortunate plastic surgery accident... her face looks distractingly odd, a bit frozen and sandblasted... something's just off. A shame, as she's got real talent, and was quite the beauty on Drew Carey. Perhaps aging gracefully isn't such a bad thing after all?

But, this remake has far bigger problems than that, obviously. It's just an exercise in ""throw everything against the wall and see what sticks"" filmmaking, and it strings you along for a very long time on its noise and energy, until you finally figure out that it really ISN'T going to get any better, and that all of the (few) good moments are the ones where it most closely hewed to the original.

So, in other words, there was no point to this remake, unless one thinks unchecked melodrama is an improvement.

I'm not anti-remake in general... 'Battlestar Galactica', for example, is an example of a fine remake that surpasses the original. And I suppose in the environment of our current fears of terrorism and biological weapons, it was only a matter of time before someone took a crack at re-doing the original, grand-daddy-of-'em-all bioterror story. But, god, couldn't they have done a better job? The filmmakers here out-clever themselves out of giving us a taught, gripping story, and the slick 'Hollywooded up' production values/look actually make the events less authentic and scary, not more.

But they DON'T get that, as you'll see when you watch the DVD extras... a great deal of self-congratulation on how much better the special effects are these days, how it's great that they doubled the length and added so much junk to the proceedings, etc. etc.  Like I said, the Wayne Newton effect. This story deserved better.

Scariest of all? The ending sets us up for a sequel or even a series. Try going to sleep knowing THAT.",1214352000,15,4838,5.0476190476190474
3173093,1,B0017IVHHO,"Having already read the book when I was in high school and then having seen the original film (expertly directed by Robert Wise in the 1970s), I have to say that film was surprisingly prescient and still holds up well.... which begs the question, WHY???

Sometimes a good idea is the victim of bad execution. bad direction, poor acting, lousy writing or just bad timing. Typically, technological advances and bigger budgets can be a good justification to reinterpret an older film. Conversely, this movie seems to have different reason for being made:

P R O P A G A N D A.

This movie tosses in every current topical gimmick you could imagine, but my question is how the heck was it in conformity with the original narrative? Between inundating us with displays of homeland security, domestic troop deployments and extra-judicial law enforcement, this film gets off to a pretty bad start. For good measure we toss in setting off a nuke and then top it all off as some cautionary tale to make us succumb to a brave new world under the NWO. There is not one stone left unturned insofar as giving us blantant social conditioning. Even shows like 24 are remotely entertaining when compared with this production.

It was as if someone in the government had a list of predictive programming agendas and used the film as a host virus to infect anyone foolish enough to take it seriously.

Predictive programming only works when it is covert.

A U.S. government satellite crash lands near Piedmont, Utah, and two teenagers find it and bring it back to town. The town's inhabitants open it and release a deadly microorganism, which is later codenamed Andromeda by the United States Army. A team is sent from the Army's bio-defense department to retrieve the satellite, only to die from the disease themselves. General George Mancheck (Andre Braugher), the head of the bio-defense department, who activates ""Wildfire,"" a team of five scientists who are called upon when high-level bioterror threats occur in the United States. The team, headed by its creator Dr. Jeremy Stone (Bratt), investigate Piedmont. They retrieve the satellite and rescue a hysterical 60-year old man and a colicky baby who have survived the Andromeda outbreak. Cable news reporter Jack Nash (Eric McCormick)becomes aware of some of the events related to the fallen satellite and Andromeda. As he investigates further, Chuck Beeter, the Director of the NSA, uses General Mancheck's aide, Colonel Ferrus, to perform assassinations to prevent knowledge of Andromeda from reaching the civilian population. Nash travels to one of the Army bases performing the quarantine, and sees the effects of Andromeda - now using multiple vectors of travel - spreading. He also becomes a target of assassination, but manages to escape Ferrus and his subordinates.

This production is DULL and over technical. It takes Star Trek's Science Fiction bable one step beyond and it overbores its audience with its over sounding intelligence.

What I didn't like as much was the CGI effects I thought they lacked weight and pressence.
When done right CGI can be terrific as in Jurassic Park where the mix of sound and CGI helped give the CGI weight or in The Perfect Storm with the huge wave effects the sound played a big part in making you feel like these things were possible.

3173100,1,B0017IVHHO,Recently A&E broadcast the Andromeda Strain.  I waited for this event for a very long time.  I felt that with today's special effects and cinematography it would be better or as just as good as the orginal.  I was greatly disappointed with this remake or I should say retelling the masterpiece novel and the original that was a high energy  sitting on your edge thriller (science fiction).  My biggest complaints about the remake is why bother?  As many other reviewers agree why bother?  Acording to what I read in Starlog Magazine.  The screenwriter seen the original once and recently reread the book.  Acording to the article he was somewhat disenchanted with it.  Anyone who is interested in waisting four hours of their life can watch this.  I recommend the 1970's movie over this.  If anyone has bought his and listened to his commentary at the very end of the audio commentary of the movie he hints at a weekly show or another sequel to the Andrdomeda Strain?  Why?  There was a tv show very similar to the Andromeda Strain with a Biological Crisis team called the Burning Zone.  Maybe he is taking ideas from '90's tv shows because he has no original ones.  Acroding the producer there was nothing like this seen on tv before.  My idea is I will not see this again on TV.  I truthfully also heard that A&E may be involved with remaking the Thing close to the book.  I heard the same thing about the Andromeda Strain.  Let's hope they don't ruin that one.  Should you by the DVD?  If you want a good joke wait until it comes down.  Maybe you can pick it up in a flea market.  The only thing I liked about it was the cover art and the poster on the A&E website.,1213228800,6,1668,4.429042904290429
3173101,2,B0017IVHHO,"If you're looking for a taut, tense story about the outbreak of an alien plague and the desperate efforts of a band of scientists to isolate and defeat it ... then I suggest reading the original The Andromeda Strain novel, by Michael Crichton. Or, if you're video-centric, check out the 1971 movie adaptation. In either case, skip this A&E two-night miniseries.

I'll start with the caveat that I am quite fond of both the book and the 1971 movie (one of the first movies I remember going to -- we were not a big movie-going family). I was looking forward to this miniseries to refresh and expand on Crichton's story, updating it for a new generation. Instead, the core novel has been turned into soap opera mush, and the added time available (180 minutes, minus commercials) is wasted on a parallel conspiracy theory story that not only adds nothing, but never really gets resolved.

This is a ""hard"" SF novel, focused on the science involved in diagnosing and dealing with Andromeda.  Secondarily, it's about the pressure upon the four scientists (expanded to five in the miniseries, and all but the main one renamed), faced with multiple ticking clocks and a pathogenic horror that could, if unchecked, kill the world as efficiently as it's killed the town of Piedmont (Arizona in the book, New Mexico in the 1971 movie, Utah in 2008).

The miniseries turns the science into random and unfocused gobbledigook, including a talking computer that, evidently, does pretty much all the work for the research team. That leaves everyone time to chit-chat, mull over romances past and present, and hint at past events that are never explained (or that really aren't all that germane to the story). Meanwhile ...

The original novel and movie did include a bit of ""conspiracy"" about them. While Wildfire was originally set up by Congress at Dr Stone's recommendation, it was to decontaminate space probes and astronauts and deal with any infections they might bring back. The government looked upon it, and Project Scoop, as a way to gather and develop potential bioweapons; this comes out over the course of the original tale, but is really a sidelight to it, an addition to the caution that we Need To Be Careful Out There.

That's the part, though, that gets all the padding in the new miniseries. We get multiple government factions -- the DoD bioweapons head, his army gunsel, Homeland Security, a hapless president, a general whose motivations are mysterious -- and, of course, a doughty (and drug-addicted) journalist who's trying to track down this story and stay one step ahead of both the virus and the assassins sent to do him in.

(Yawn.)

It's layering cheap icing on the cake. It never really adds much -- except to distract from both the core story (which is bad) and the melodrama back at Wildfire (which, I guess, is good). You could excise the entire mess from the miniseries, and it wouldn't make a bit of difference to its resolution, but it would ratchet up the tension at Wildfire, rather than deflating it every time we cut to another scene.

There's so much more to criticize -- scientists too young (and pretty) for the long and distinguished careers they're supposed to have; the world's most incompetent governmental conspiracy; the laugh-out-loud climactic race against the Wildfire auto-destruct; the baby and old man who vanish after the first half; a telepathic, self-aware, highly-adaptive uber-virus that came from the future through a wormhole; egregious firing-squad breaches of security at a highly classified installation ... the list goes on.

When I saw ads in the movie theater for the miniseries, my thought was, ""Wow, it looks like The Andromeda Strain, only with car crashes."" I was at least partly correct: there were car crashes. But despite being able to be summed up with the same short paragraph in TV guide, I don't see much of the book, or original movie in here -- and that's a shame. In short, where this miniseries parallels the original, it does so in a muddled, mediocre fashion. Where it doesn't, it's even weaker. It adds nothing new to the original's vision, and the new stuff it does add feels more like it's one of those awful SciFi original movies than something from A&E.",1213228800,51,4227,4.858333333333333

Wow.  Fantastic and powerful.  Then they do what the contemporary film industry does -- remake a great film by watering down the action and suspense, tossing in a lot of smarmy politics, stressing an ecological message, and presenting a politically-correct cast.  Add some ridiculous and sketchy sci-fi details making it obvious that those writing the script weren't all that knowledgeable about science fiction or true science.  Wormholes?  Time travel?  Coincidences?  The movie is so busy focusing on current political and social issues that the real story gets lost.  Add to that, the personal lives of the cast are explored, when that isn't at all important to the story.  It should just focus on the virus and the effort to understand, thus cure, it.  More, political correctness actually was tossed aside as it looked like several helpless animals were killed in some of the scenes.  Disgusting.  To make the film even worse, they threw in a crusading journalist played by that guy from Will & Grace, who was pretty much arrogant and conceited throughout, as if he was doing us all a favor by being there -- even though his story line was nonsensical and extraneous, could have been edited out entirely.  Was it worse or better that the main character, played by Benjamin Bratt, even ended up romancing a fellow scientist on the team?  A lot of triviality just really destroyed the concept of this story, and I honestly fell asleep the first time I watched it, missing the last hour.  Because A&E reran the film several times, I was able to catch what I'd missed, but alas, it was just as bad as the other three hours.

3173113,2,B0017IVHHO,"The first thing that pops into one's head after watching _The Andromeda Strain_ is Why? Why did they even bother making this?
Advertised as a television summer blockbuster event, it is a showpiece of wretched dialogue and bad science.
Like the killer inorganic life form which undergoes random mutations, the schlocky script makes random leaps, careens into illogical blind alleys and disregards the basic structure, style and principles of plotting with abandon. The makers would have had better luck having the sophisticated A.I. of the Wildfire center write the script.
Excusing it as a simply fun made for television entertainment would be ignoring its background. One might as well watch _Everybody Loves Raymond_ instead. We shouldn't have to endure passable television. Crichton's novel was packed with references to scientific literature and he fleshed it out as a real event. He wasn't asking What if?, he was pondering Why not? Since the novel's publication in the 70's, Richard Preston's _The Hot Zone_, David Gerrold's _The War Against The Chtorr_ series and numerous books have updated and re-envisioned biological/ecological attacks. A fine but maybe dated movie has already been made from Crichton's novel. Ridley Scott, the craftsman behind _Alien_ and _Blade Runner_ was the producer of the remake.
How could they have gone so wrong?
What should have been a taut story about scientists trapped in an Erlenmeyer flask of tension trying to solve a unique and deadly scientific puzzle turns out to be an over baked X-Files episode with various bits and pieces of other shows thrown in for good measure. Charred human remains, a chainsaw decapitation and a severed thumb do not make a well told story. They betray its SciFi channel origins. The truth is real biological attack scenarios aren't really sexy (of course the Andromeda strain is highly exotic). Cue the clichd government and military conspiracies, the clichd good looking ""scientists"", the clichd jargon, the clichd journalist hunting for the truth. All to supposedly amp up the tension. It's all just too hokey.

So when I learned about the remake of the story, a four-hour miniseries, no less, I was very excited to see what would be done with this new incarnation of the Crichton thriller. Unfortunately the answer is ""not much.""

Probably the prototype for the classic ""plague-sweeping-the-world"" thriller, The Andromeda Strain in its original form is an exciting roller coaster ride of a thrillfest that kept you on the edge of your seat. The Andromeda Strain Miniseries, while not the worst film I've ever seen, or close to it, was a big disappointment compared to the expectations I had. Much of the plot and some of the characters were far too contrived, more like extraneous elements thrown in for effect than being integral parts of the tale. Although I enjoy a good government conspiracy story like the next guy or gal, the one woven into this piddling plot left me expecting to see the bad guys don black hats, grow long, thin mustaches, and cackle evilly as they grin into the camera for effect. Eric McCormack's character, the obligatory ""whistle-blower, drug addict"" that the government goes to the utmost ridiculous efforts to eliminate seemed so unnecessary that I began wanting to kill him myself.

Another flaw of this film is that it's practically got the words ""deux ex machina"" branded visibly onto every twist and turn, and some of those twists were as confounding as a dog trying to catch his own tail. If anyone sees this movie and thinks it even remotely reflects the writing skills of the original author, Michael Crichton, they will be grossly mistaken. In fact I feel that the author should the makers of this film for defamation of character, libel, character assassination, and any other trumped up charge humanly possible. In fact, the more I write about this movie, the more I realize just how much I dislike it.

In reality, the movie's no worse than a high budget ""B"" movie, somewhat like those that have become the staple of the Sci Fi Channel. The problem is that this film had much more promise, expectation, and a far higher foundation to build upon than most of those films, and somehow wound up being worse than those films. Those films knowingly don't take themselves seriously, but this film I feel wasn't taken nearly seriously enough. I hope the actors in this movie got paid well, because they certainly won't be getting any big time starring roles based on their work here. They all did their best with what they had, but unfortunately something from nothing is still nothing.

This is a first for me, but if I have to rate this film on a scale from 1 to 5, then I'd give it a 1. And except for those who are fans of completely mindless fun (and I'm not even sure this film qualifies as such), then the movie should be rated a negative 2. And since I rarely watch a film I find so many faults with, I think this film's failure is really sad.

The writing and direction convey not an ounce of urgency.  No one on the Wildfire A-team rounded up by the government seems even remotely shocked or disturbed by the 99% mortality rate of a mysterious new disease!  When a top surgeon is first told about this microbial juggernaut she smirks and says, ""Gee, you always have such good news for me.""  Then the two go on to chit chat about petty family problems.

The cynicism of these characters is truly stupefying.  If you have ever watched a few science documentaries, particularly those dealing with public health, you will know that real scientists are often driven by deep emotions and passions.  Dullards like those found in ""The Andromeda Strain (2008)"" exist only in the lazy minds of subliterate hack writers.

Please note that the recent SARS outbreak six years ago had a mortality rate of about 10%!  Our CDC and health agencies all over the world went into high gear to understand the disease and to check its progress.  In this crummy flick - which so earnestly throws around scientific lingo to establish credibility - the field of epidemiology is reduced to a cheap soap opera.

Good science fiction must be grounded in reality.  The only way to put science-based heroism up on the screen is to first understand the heroism of real scientists.  The disease warriors who literally risk their lives every day are a thousand times more interesting than the autistic bores found here.

3173127,1,B0017IVHHO,"Short Review:

It's bad.

Long Review:

I don't blame the actors, I believe they did what they could with the script they had.

I think the special effects were adequate, some of the tech stuff was a bit overdone and detracted from the story. For example, a lab technician running the tests would have been more realistic to me than a computer that can run any imaginable test immediately by voice command.

The subplots were waaaaaay out of control. By having so many side stories, the main story was diluted and couldn't build a sense of urgency.

The preachy environmentalist message changed what might have been an enjoyable sci-fi drama into yet another in a long line of 'save the Earth' movies. Don't get me wrong. I like the Earth. I really do. It's one of my favorite planets. I just don't need to be clubbed over the head with yet another environmentalist lecture. I think the movie as a whole would have been much better off without it.

If those were all the failings, I probably would have given this 3 or 4 stars. I could have suspended disbelief and enjoyed the show. But...

The wormhole/time travel element was so incredibly bad that it killed the movie for me. The story would have been so much better if they had just left the origin of Andromeda as an unknown. Simply say 'It came from somewhere in space.' and be done with it. But, if you're determined to use time travel as a story element, at least don't cause a paradox.

Minor Things that Irritated Me:

It appears that to be an effective doctor or scientist, one must be young and attractive. I suppose that anyone who is old, fat or just plain ugly could not possibly be of any help finding a cure to an infectious disease.

The 'cure' confused me. The progress of Andromeda was shown by the water and vegitation turning brown as Andromeda killed it. When the benevolent virus was released and consumed Andromeda, everything turned green again... did all the plants suddenly come back to life? Will the animals? Will the people?

I have a little problem with the idea that the sterno drinker who takes a bottle of aspirin a day and vomits huge amounts of blood was casually invited over to the fire station for a poker game. In my experience, the destitute and chronically ill are either a) hospitalized or b) shunned. I don't know, maybe it's a Utah thing.

In Conclusion:

This movie had a lot of things going for it. Unfortunately, it could not overcome a horribly ill-conceived script.",1212019200,134,2466,4.587699316628702

What a fool I was.
It's grotesquely bad.  Aside from the moonbat content slathered on with a trowel, the original was a SCIENTIFIC thriller.  That's what made it unusual and extraordinary..and a multimillion-selling book that remains in print after nearly four decades.  So the Hollywood bozos, not understanding the concept, sort of hand-wave the science with a bunch of incorrectly-used buzzwords, and then drag out the PC/liberal playbook for making a generic Hollywood action flick.  Men stupid and bad (liberal men are...tolerable).  Woman wise and good.  Military stupid and evil.  Media wise and noble.  Bush lied!  Save the planet! Etcetera ad nauseum. (Seriously, the amount of PC/enviro/liberal/moonbat crap akwardly jammed into the film is amazing.)  The dialog sounds like a bowl of lumpy oatmeal.  One of the reasons the original book and movie were so scary is that they tried to convince you it was all real and plausible.  So in this lame version, when the chief scientist starts making open-line cell phone calls to the highly irritating reporter/meth-head from a ""sooper-dooper top secret locked-down hush-hush underground military bio-science lab,"" all you can do is laugh.  The final straw in part one is the scientists standing in a meeting room and watching a live feed (!!) from the HUD of an F-16 firing a ""nuclear-tipped missile""...which then ""accidently"" goes off.
Then I watched the last part, and it's worse, much worse.  First, I'll admit to skipping through chunks on 4x speed, but I'll bet I didn't miss anything worth seeing.  Basically, Andromeda is supposedly a warning sent from the future to stop us from ""raping the planet."" The film then disintegrates into hysterically awful SF gibberish about wormholes and most of the ending violates every law of physics and common sense I can think of. Example: the water coolant pool over the core of the nuclear reactor at the bottom of Wildfire is OPEN TO THE AIR (water reactors have to be sealed because they operate at about 70 atmospheres of pressure and 785 degrees F).  There's even worse, trust me.  I could go on and on and on....
All in all, it was the worst SF movie I've ever seen that wasn't made in the 50s (or direct to video), and Michael Crichton has every right to track down the screenwriter and club him to a pulp with a copy of the bloated script.
Not only am I annoyed they've ruined this hoped-for update, I'm even more annoyed that because they've pi55ed in the pool and now there probably won't be a good remake of the original for another decade or more.

 I enjoyed and appreciated the environmental overtones of the re-make, and this ultimately seems to be the main message of this version.

Now, the bad: trust me, the other reviewers are spot-on when they say that the second half of this miniseries fell apart. We get the reporter chased across the desert for a bit of meaningless drama that contributes nothing to the plot. We get a dollop of subterranean romance, and you just *know* when the cliches get rolling that The Kiss is going to be interrupted by A Disaster. When some characters die, it becomes apparent how poorly they were developed; you'll shrug and say ""who cares?"" The Andromeda strain is a nasty bug, all right, but how about that Evil Government (where's Austin Powers when you need him)? And a TIME TRAVEL PARADOX?! Why, for the love of Crichton, WHY?!!

It was in it's day a technological marvel, a very egdy sci-fi movie that still keeps me on the edge of my seat.  I really looked forward to watching this A&E remake and stayed up to watch it both nights.  The first 2 hour installment was promising and had a great take on the scientific side of the story.  The computers used in the movie were fascinating.  I was also intrigued by their interpretation of how the virus affects humans.  The Utah angle was the same from the original (even though it wasn't filmed in Utah!) and I liked the updated storyline that involved Homeland Security and the Utah National Guard.  Okay, day two.  The second evening of the mini-series went down hill fast.  I had a hard time keeping up with the plot twists, and the explanations for those twists were rather weak.  Considering all the extra time spent developing the story in this mini-series, it was disappointing to see them rush through to the end.  The final scenes make little sense in conjunction with the rest of the movie.  And the very last parting blow was the paradox (that I won't discuss in case you haven't seen it.)  Let me say that it was just plain dumb.  It is worth renting, and I will probably buy it just to compare it to the original because I'm a sucker, but the 1971 version is a must-see.

3407497,1,B0017IVHHO,While I did quite enjoy the first half of the Andromeda strain. I felt like the whole series just gets lost in the last hour or so. There is the addition of en entire temporal paradox that is left completely unexplained and only alluded to in the end. Their are some piss poor decision made by the decision makers like Doctor Barton risking the fate of the entire planet because her family is threatened. The whole self destruct sequence is far to cliche and the deaths and meaningless and pointless.

3407498,1,B0017IVHHO,"How deadly is the Andromeda Strain?  Deadly enough to kill almost everything on the planet just by watching it.

Let me first admit that I've not read the original book, nor seen the original movie.  That puts me at a disadvantage to someone who's already been exposed to this tale twice already.  However, it also means I'm approaching this miniseries with a blank slate.

And frankly, it also leaves me wondering just how dated (or just plain bad) the original book would have to be to inspire a miniseries as horrendous as this.

Take every previous ""outbreak"" style movie ever made and mash them together.  Put the action inside a ""secure"" underground facility on top of a nuclear bomb (oooh, ahhhh) with an automatic lockdown-and-self-destruct trigger.  Give them computers and technology that exceed the best of Star Trek.  Throw in a humourless Fox Mulder as your totally spurious investigative reporter.  Come up with a magic solution to this insanely overpowered threat, engineer a pointless ""disarm the bomb with seconds to spare"" sequence, make some nebulous moral statements about preserving natural resources, and wrap it all up with a pointless implied time loop.

That's the Andromeda Strain in a nutshell.

How secure is this amazing wonder-facility?  So secure that you can break between levels (supposedly impossible) with a screwdriver and a fire extinguisher.

How effective is the safeguard to ensure nobody but the designated man can turn off the self-destruct in the case of a real emergency?  So effective that they can take his badge and his thumb to do it without him -- but not before the less-liked scientist can nobly (and pointlessly) sacrifice himself by jumping in the radioactive water to cut it off.

These kinds of hackneyed plot elements are chained one after another, creating what could almost be a parody of the entire genre, if only they didn't take themselves so seriously.  The Andromeda Strain gleams with a shiny 2008 visual polish, but inside this apple is a core so old and rotten that it's not worth watching even just to laugh at it.

Then there's the show's annoying habit of showing us various things while the characters speculate about them.  They talk about bacteria found at the bottom of the sea, and we're whisked away from the conversation to go look at some vague footage of deep-sea rocks.  They talk about speculation as to what happened to their satellite, and now we're watching low-grade CGI of said satellite flying along, then shuddering and falling to earth.  ""Remember that fire?"" they say, and we're back in the outbreak town, looking at a burning car.  None of these scenes actually reveal anything, and so they end up being awkward and almost insulting, as if the producers thought their audience would have no imagination and would need to see everything to understand or remember it.

All in all, I'm thinking this is going to be the ""Must-Not-Have"" miniseries of 2008.  There's just too much wrong, and almost nothing right.

(Oh, and by the way, Australia got this series over a month ago, and Britain saw it a few weeks ago as well.  Check release dates before you say that someone can't possibly have watched the entire show yet.)",1211760000,20,3206,4.901669758812616

3407506,1,B0017IVHHO,"One should always beware of remakes, but in this case, one should run away at warp speeds. The original 1971 classic (Dir: Robert Wise) was extremely advanced for its time, and even after more than 40 years, it still holds up as a tight, beautifully-filmed, intelligent sci-fi thriller. To call this mini-series ""schlock"" is to insult even the worst films ever made.

Taking Michael Crichton's original book and vivisecting nearly everything that made it worth reading, this waste of nearly four hours of your life gives little to nothing in return. The creators of this Frankensteinian monster inserted numerous irrelevant ""plot points,"" wasted precious time on extraneous new story ideas (a down-and-out reporter who sniffs a story, irrelevant interpersonal melodrama, equally irrelevant political maneuvering, and a completely incorrect assumption that a dog survives the disease long enough to escape town and potentially spread the disease), and perhaps worst of all insults the viewer's intelligence with ridiculously overdone high-tech toys, inane dialog, and an attempt to make ""action sequences"" and blood-and-gore effects an integral part of the story telling. Michael Bay couldn't have done a worse job, and that's saying something.

The film bodes ill from the beginning, as the composer for the soundtrack resorted to stealing the ""Dies Irea"" from the fifth movement of Berlioz's ""Symphony Fantastique"" -- a staple used so often in 50s horror films that it warns you in advance that this whole production is going to be poor. We then waste precious viewing time establishing a series of ridiculous relationships, eliminating the names of all primary characters save for Jeremy Stone, thus underlining that the producers want to make something ""different,"" and presenting us with irrelevant background for the various conspiracy sub-plots that have no purpose, add nothing, and in fact detract severely from the primary focus of the story.

Our scientific team is glib, lifeless, highly-technical without really coming across as intelligent, and worst of all, they seem incurious. Any real scientist facing this kind of situation, would be bright, shining, his eyes dancing with wonder and curiosity, despite the horrific consequences of the organism that he's studying. These people behave as if nothing unusual is going on, that they are mere fact-takers; there is no seeming flash of genius to make the quantum leaps of possibility that lead to real discovery. It's lackluster and boring; the lab equipment has greater emotional depth than these characters.

Minus-points are given particularly for a short sequence where we're forced to watch a still-breathing animal (rabbit?) being slowly swallowed head-first by a large snake. Pardon the pun, but that's just plain tasteless and singularly unnecessary.

This remake is truly horrifying, in terms of the cost of money, man-hours of production, and waste of the viewer's time. Crichton died late in 2008, the year this tripe was produced; one may only assume that he needed the money, but it's a shame that his name has to be sullied by association. Go see the original -- shorter by about half, it has a hundred times the brilliance and power of this travesty of a great novel.",1441152000,4,3245,5.2810077519379846

I enjoyed the updated technology and the added textures of conflicting agendas with the environmentalists and mining the thermal vents and the government efforts to control all. Very true to life.

This is just another science based movie where all the scientists are in their late 20's and early thirties yet are the leading experts in their field.

The film was in serious need of an upgrade, and while the new technology really enhanced the film, making it all the more believable, the updates to the story along with the new characters that were introduced, really did the original story a disservice. The basic story was not changed, just modernized, and for that we are very thankful. The story was always a terrific tale of Science Fiction and an early message about the damage we are doing to our planet. I like how the story was updated and I loved the technological advancements. What I didn't like was how much they changed the cast. They wanted to make them more diverse and I don't have a problem with that, but this is not a story that focuses on individuals, it's more about the virus, the technology, and the human impact on our planet.

The less said about this film the better actually since there is so little to recommend it. It fails on as many levels as the original succeeds.

The miniseries also deepens into the ""conspiracy"" by the government to conceal the Scoop Project with the obligatory journalist running behind to uncover the army wrong doings.

A comparison with the 1971&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Andromeda-Strain/dp/B00008438U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Andromeda Strain</a>&nbsp;film is difficult. The main strength of the original film is that it followed faithfully the novel's original plot, but this adherence to detail make the movie's pace too slow; often leaving the impression that  you are watching a documentary. In contrast, the pace in the 2008 version is faster, and it takes full advantage of the additional time (almost an hour longer) to go into interesting details and new subplots, always exploiting today's more advance technologies, and thus, making the movie look more like an upgrade rather than a simple update. However, I particularly dislike the time wasted with the boring army conspiracy. And as for the environmental message, it feels a bit forced into the plot, probably should have been introduced more smoothly early in the story, but in the end, this new plot fully reflects Chricton's everlasting concerns with modern society inability to deal adequately with the environment and the unintended consequences of new technologies.

Not a great remake, but neurotic characters and conspiracies apart, it is quite an upgrade of the original story and it managed to keep the Crichton feel and touch. Recommended for die-hard sci-fi fans. If I had the choice, I would have rated it 3 1/2 stars.",1271030400,,2308,6.051987767584098

The original 1971 movie was more of a thriller albeit with the science fiction-ish story. However, the newer 2008 version is still an okay relatively good TV movie. Well, good for TV and cable TV in particular since this 2008 version was made for the A&E Channel on cable. But not as good as the original 1971 theatrical movie. There seems to be more of a political conspiracy going on with the new version. The president in the new version is like a younger better version of George W. Bush. Was the virus bug thingie really from outer space? Well, yeah it came down in that crashed satellite. Was it alien? Well, you could say no in part but you can say yes because you don't know where it really came from and how humans first got it. You got some time travel talk in this and I don't remember that in the original movie. But then again, it's been a while since I've seen the original movie. And then there's the constant phone calling to outside to family, reporters, etc. WTF? I thought they could only talk to whoever is in charge and maybe family via monitored calls? But it's like the head scientist dude has the guard on the surface put his cell phone up to the computer so he can call a reporter. What a breach of security. People actually do get fired for things like that. Oh well, I guess that means it can happen in real life and therefore in a TV movie also. And I thought that they said something to the effect that civilians in the outside world couldn't call into the underground lab - but later, a spouse of one of the main characters calls in. Well if that wasn't possible then a certain (minor) plot point wouldn't occur. Well, this is television. Good mindless television entertainment and that isn't all that bad.

3407559,1,B0017IVHHO,"The second attempt at bringing Michael Crichton's novel, ""The Andromeda Strain"", to the screen is an interesting conundrum to ponder - not in terms of the film itself, which is very bad - but in terms of the differences in tone between it and it's predecessor.

1971's original big-screen outing (directed by Robert Wise) was a weirdly compulsive tale of a group of predominantly white, predominately middle-aged and elderly research virologists doing battle with a mysterious extra-terrestrial virus inadvertently unleashed on a small Californian town by a downed Satellite. Set predominantly in a sealed underground research bunker which could be cauterized by a Nuclear blast should the threat of contamination become too great, the film boast a cast of virtual unknowns, a weirdly atonal electronic score by Gil Mell, an uncomfortably claustrophobic, tense atmosphere and some splendid use of abstract shot-framing and split-screen. There was very little in the way of action, big explosions and histrionics and it remains a faithful adaptation of Crichton's book (which, if you've never read it, is one of his best and one of the most splendidly ominous and worryingly authentic first-contact novels ever written.)

This made for TV remake was apparently co-produced by Tony and Ridley Scott, but given it's tone and timbre, it might just as well have been produced by Michael Bay.

And I don't mean that as a compliment.

From the outset, the audience is beaten over the head with CGI and bombast; the research virologists are now all forty and under, impossibly good-looking and fit and of a racial mix hardly seen outside of Benetton commercials; Humvees seem to cram the frame every two minutes; gunfire and explosions break out with sporadic abandon and we are treated to more impassioned histrionics that one would generally expect to see in an episode of ""The Bold And The Beautiful"" - seriously, I kept waiting for Ridge to stagger through the bunker (which seems to be perpetually lit like the chill-out room of a nightclub) and demand to see Stephanie and Taylor.

Oh yeah, then there's the virus itself. It's no longer just an extra-terrestrial virus - now its also sentient, telepathic and has come through a wormhole from the future. Nanotechnology, which is fast acquiring the irritancy and, one assumes, will acquire the obsolescence factor that Virtual Reality helmets did in the nineties, also crops up *yawn*

There's also, wouldn't you know it, a big army conspiracy behind the whole thing which is hunting your obligatory drug-addled, wise-guy journalist (played by Eric McCormack from ""Will And Grace"" - who looks so out of place that I kept wishing that Jack McFarland would turn up and comfort him at his 'mannary'), a character that is completely extraneous in terms of the story.

There's also the worrying hint at the end that the producers may be contemplating a sequel.

In every way bigger, louder and brasher than it's predecessor, this film is also vastly dumber and more irritating. One day, maybe producers will realize that in the case of source material which is this good, you don't need extraneous trappings; just good actors, a decent script and a director who knows where to point a camera.",1254009600,8,3234,5.065789473684211

In this case the interesting element is the method used to take over, and clean up the planet of the human race that is kind of in the way. They use the curiosity of this human race and infiltrate a satellite that is devised to capture living and unknown extraterrestrial organisms or substances. It does crop one substance hat is living but with no DNA. That substance will cause the satellite to crash back on the earth, without being in any way damaged, which is quite hard to believe today. This satellite will be recuperated by some people in a close-by city, opened and the substance will spread and kill everyone except an alcoholic who uses methylated spirit to satisfy his thirst and a new-born baby. The objective is to cause an overreaction among the human collective body called society and for them humans to try to destroy this invading substance with a nuclear missile. And that's the trick. This substance is fed by nuclear radiations or feeds on nuclear radiations. This fact is discovered by the scientists who are trying to understand the phenomenon, the counter order is given to the pilot delivering the missile and she turns back, but it is too late: the substance had already invaded the plane and it took control of it and the missile will eventually reach its target and humanity will be destroyed entirely. All that because of the human vain belief that one single invention, destructive substance or mechanism can be supreme and destroy everything, which is false, and we know it, since cockroaches for one are not at all disturbed in their very busy life by nuclear radiations. What is surprising is that this film, done for TV, should be so poor on the characters as if television did not have the means to hire good authors, directors and actors any more. Too bad, indeed.

The people become pawns set up to make the ends meet, and occasionally its so hastily pushed forward that it seems more like a practice run through than finished production.

3407567,1,B0017IVHHO,"This picture starts out promisingly. It's tense and forboding, and builds from there. This is when the picture is close to what Michael Crichton wrote. About an hour in, the screenwriter, director and producers decide to pile in some of the usual Hollywood cheese: military conspiracies, government double-dealing and conspiracy, and an almost omnipotent hit man.

Carried off with style, this might still work (Ex: ""Three Days of the Condor,"" ""The Pelican Brief"" and ""The China Syndrome"" -- liberal causes all, but still fun). There is no style here. We get a poorly-made hash: Throw in a wormhole, add a bowl of save the planet, a dash of low-budget special effects, and the cop-out ""it was all for nothing because they didn't destroy andromeda after all"" ending -- itself a cliche from too many 50s monster and conspiracy flicks -- and the result is this mini-series. It gets more preposterous the longer it runs.

When ""The Andromeda Strain"" sticks to Crichton, it's riveting and believable, with an ending that made sense, because Crichton did his homework. But the writers of this version didn't do their homework. Result: When it goes out on its own, which it mostly does, it's just absurd.

As we know, a killer virus escapes into our world devastating a town sans one old drunk and one healthy newborn.  With conspiracy afoot, a topnotch group of scientists dwell into it's secrets hoping to stop the spread of a potential doomsday machine.

Toss the book out: this 3 hour film takes the basic premise and runs wild with it.

There was not necessarily room for improvement, but additional layers could have been added to the growing menace of a team of isolated scientists attempting to identify a deadly alien virus that has landed on earth.

I was genuinely looking forward to this 2008 TV miniseries remake, especially with Ridley and Tony Scott serving as executive producers. Sadly, as the film played out, I realized with intense frustration the filmmakers had no confidence in the source material. I was aghast and mortified at the dramatic license taken. Multiple subplots were added above ground (the scientists are isolated in an underground government lab), including a TV reporter attempting to uncover the plot, a governmental conspiracy stretching to the Pentagon and an accidental nuclear explosion. In addition, the virus now causes victims to become homicidal maniacs. This film is a perfect example of modern-day filmmakers having complete disrespect for today's audiences.

It's ironic that the only good moments in this film are those below ground where the team of scientists attempt to understand the virus (the only scenes faithful to the original). The additional fluff is derivative and uninspired. There is not a moment of believability in the new subplots and after the first two hours, most viewers familiar with the source material will be profoundly insulted. Filmmakers, including director Mikael Salomon and writer Robert Schenkkan, made a conscious choice to add violence, explosions and second-rate soap opera in an attempt to appeal to what they believe is a dumb audience interested in such crap. They have purposefully moved the action out of the laboratory and away from the scientific process in order to create tired action movie dramatics.

There's some good actors in this cast, Benjamin Bratt, Rick Schroder and Andre Braugher, but their roles are so weak they eventually disappear in the mindless subplots lifted from other, better films. Sadly, the original ""The Andromeda Strain"" has been cheapened by this shockingly bad miniseries, which steers for clumsy thrills rather than suspense. This is one of the worst films I have ever seen, an unspeakable waste of three hours of my life.

Beyond the accuracy to the original, this movie stands out, and I thought was highly memorable and exceptional sci-fi.  I thought it was incredibly well cast, acted, written and put together.  This is probably the best thing I've seen Benjamin Bratt in.  Rick Shroeder and Andre Braugher also gave memorable performances, as did the entire cast.

3407589,2,B0017IVHHO,"Man, you hate to say it, but watching this modern Andromeda Strain remake is a bit like watching Wayne Newton in concert-- not much raw talent, but he's trying so gosh darn HARD to entertain you. If enthusiasm was ability, this remake would be 5 stars. Unfortunately, it's not, and it's not.

Instead of being the taught, direct, minimalist thriller the original was, this one takes a 'kitchen sink' approach. We've got space wormholes (yes, you read that right), terrorism and 9/11 references, inter-military intrigue, a crack investigative reporter with a drug problem (of course), gratuitous assassinations, radical environmentalism, common-sense environmentalism, divorce, parenting issues, nationalistic tensions within the scientific team, romantic tensions within the scientific team, rampant politics, and *gasp* the President's wife in peril!!!

It's kind of like going camping with absolutely everything you own... seemed like a good idea on paper, but seldomly works out that way in practice. Especially when everything is as Hollywooded-up as it is here.

Sadly, the one thing this Andromeda Strain does NOT have is a legitimate sense of tension. The focus is just too diluted, too many things are going on, many of them not too consequential. As a result, even with the long running time, many of the goings on have to communicated purely verbally, in tossed-off one-liners, said with little or no emotion backing them. The characters don't seem to much care, so neither do we.

There's also a big fat strain of the ridiculous and random in some of the sideplots... such as when an eagle uber-conveniently drops an Andromeda-diseased mouse at the feet of some National Guard troops. Or how about the ridiculousness of the whole 'space wormhole from the future' explanation for Andromeda? Sometimes it's better when things go UN-explained, especially when you want the audience to suspend disbelief, but I guess that particular note never made it to the powers-that-be on this one.

It also doesn't help that the cast seems mostly just as Hollywooded-up as the proceedings. Sure, a few of the actors in the cast, notably Ricky Schroeder, McCormack, Andre Braugher, and the unknown-but-quite-good Viola Davis, attempt to inject some sense of humanity (or at least style, in Braugher's case) and urgency into their characters and the goings-on, but they're largely defeated by the stilted and occasionally just plain weird dialogue. For example, just LISTEN to Benjamin Bratt's estranged wife speak early on... you will say over and over again to yourself, ""No one talks like this... NO ONE...""

Oh, and speaking of Ben Bratt as the focal character, he's fairly inert, in the way that many hunky heroes tend to be inert in any kind of complex drama. The fact that he's ethnic doesn't really make it any more interesting.

Also, a big shudder goes out to the normally cute and interesting Christa Miller (of 'Drew Carey' and 'Scrubs' fame). In this miniseries, she appears to be either savagely over-botoxed, or the victim of an unfortunate plastic surgery accident... her face looks distractingly odd, a bit frozen and sandblasted... something's just off. A shame, as she's got real talent, and was quite the beauty on Drew Carey. Perhaps aging gracefully isn't such a bad thing after all?

But, this remake has far bigger problems than that, obviously. It's just an exercise in ""throw everything against the wall and see what sticks"" filmmaking, and it strings you along for a very long time on its noise and energy, until you finally figure out that it really ISN'T going to get any better, and that all of the (few) good moments are the ones where it most closely hewed to the original.

So, in other words, there was no point to this remake, unless one thinks unchecked melodrama is an improvement.

I'm not anti-remake in general... 'Battlestar Galactica', for example, is an example of a fine remake that surpasses the original. And I suppose in the environment of our current fears of terrorism and biological weapons, it was only a matter of time before someone took a crack at re-doing the original, grand-daddy-of-'em-all bioterror story. But, god, couldn't they have done a better job? The filmmakers here out-clever themselves out of giving us a taught, gripping story, and the slick 'Hollywooded up' production values/look actually make the events less authentic and scary, not more.

But they DON'T get that, as you'll see when you watch the DVD extras... a great deal of self-congratulation on how much better the special effects are these days, how it's great that they doubled the length and added so much junk to the proceedings, etc. etc.  Like I said, the Wayne Newton effect. This story deserved better.

Scariest of all? The ending sets us up for a sequel or even a series. Try going to sleep knowing THAT.",1214352000,15,4838,5.0476190476190474
3407590,1,B0017IVHHO,"Having already read the book when I was in high school and then having seen the original film (expertly directed by Robert Wise in the 1970s), I have to say that film was surprisingly prescient and still holds up well.... which begs the question, WHY???

Sometimes a good idea is the victim of bad execution. bad direction, poor acting, lousy writing or just bad timing. Typically, technological advances and bigger budgets can be a good justification to reinterpret an older film. Conversely, this movie seems to have different reason for being made:

P R O P A G A N D A.

This movie tosses in every current topical gimmick you could imagine, but my question is how the heck was it in conformity with the original narrative? Between inundating us with displays of homeland security, domestic troop deployments and extra-judicial law enforcement, this film gets off to a pretty bad start. For good measure we toss in setting off a nuke and then top it all off as some cautionary tale to make us succumb to a brave new world under the NWO. There is not one stone left unturned insofar as giving us blantant social conditioning. Even shows like 24 are remotely entertaining when compared with this production.

It was as if someone in the government had a list of predictive programming agendas and used the film as a host virus to infect anyone foolish enough to take it seriously.

A U.S. government satellite crash lands near Piedmont, Utah, and two teenagers find it and bring it back to town. The town's inhabitants open it and release a deadly microorganism, which is later codenamed Andromeda by the United States Army. A team is sent from the Army's bio-defense department to retrieve the satellite, only to die from the disease themselves. General George Mancheck (Andre Braugher), the head of the bio-defense department, who activates ""Wildfire,"" a team of five scientists who are called upon when high-level bioterror threats occur in the United States. The team, headed by its creator Dr. Jeremy Stone (Bratt), investigate Piedmont. They retrieve the satellite and rescue a hysterical 60-year old man and a colicky baby who have survived the Andromeda outbreak. Cable news reporter Jack Nash (Eric McCormick)becomes aware of some of the events related to the fallen satellite and Andromeda. As he investigates further, Chuck Beeter, the Director of the NSA, uses General Mancheck's aide, Colonel Ferrus, to perform assassinations to prevent knowledge of Andromeda from reaching the civilian population. Nash travels to one of the Army bases performing the quarantine, and sees the effects of Andromeda - now using multiple vectors of travel - spreading. He also becomes a target of assassination, but manages to escape Ferrus and his subordinates.

This production is DULL and over technical. It takes Star Trek's Science Fiction bable one step beyond and it overbores its audience with its over sounding intelligence.

What I didn't like as much was the CGI effects I thought they lacked weight and pressence.

3407597,1,B0017IVHHO,Recently A&E broadcast the Andromeda Strain.  I waited for this event for a very long time.  I felt that with today's special effects and cinematography it would be better or as just as good as the orginal.  I was greatly disappointed with this remake or I should say retelling the masterpiece novel and the original that was a high energy  sitting on your edge thriller (science fiction).  My biggest complaints about the remake is why bother?  As many other reviewers agree why bother?  Acording to what I read in Starlog Magazine.  The screenwriter seen the original once and recently reread the book.  Acording to the article he was somewhat disenchanted with it.  Anyone who is interested in waisting four hours of their life can watch this.  I recommend the 1970's movie over this.  If anyone has bought his and listened to his commentary at the very end of the audio commentary of the movie he hints at a weekly show or another sequel to the Andrdomeda Strain?  Why?  There was a tv show very similar to the Andromeda Strain with a Biological Crisis team called the Burning Zone.  Maybe he is taking ideas from '90's tv shows because he has no original ones.  Acroding the producer there was nothing like this seen on tv before.  My idea is I will not see this again on TV.  I truthfully also heard that A&E may be involved with remaking the Thing close to the book.  I heard the same thing about the Andromeda Strain.  Let's hope they don't ruin that one.  Should you by the DVD?  If you want a good joke wait until it comes down.  Maybe you can pick it up in a flea market.  The only thing I liked about it was the cover art and the poster on the A&E website.,1213228800,6,1668,4.429042904290429
3407598,2,B0017IVHHO,"If you're looking for a taut, tense story about the outbreak of an alien plague and the desperate efforts of a band of scientists to isolate and defeat it ... then I suggest reading the original The Andromeda Strain novel, by Michael Crichton. Or, if you're video-centric, check out the 1971 movie adaptation. In either case, skip this A&E two-night miniseries.

I'll start with the caveat that I am quite fond of both the book and the 1971 movie (one of the first movies I remember going to -- we were not a big movie-going family). I was looking forward to this miniseries to refresh and expand on Crichton's story, updating it for a new generation. Instead, the core novel has been turned into soap opera mush, and the added time available (180 minutes, minus commercials) is wasted on a parallel conspiracy theory story that not only adds nothing, but never really gets resolved.

This is a ""hard"" SF novel, focused on the science involved in diagnosing and dealing with Andromeda.  Secondarily, it's about the pressure upon the four scientists (expanded to five in the miniseries, and all but the main one renamed), faced with multiple ticking clocks and a pathogenic horror that could, if unchecked, kill the world as efficiently as it's killed the town of Piedmont (Arizona in the book, New Mexico in the 1971 movie, Utah in 2008).

The miniseries turns the science into random and unfocused gobbledigook, including a talking computer that, evidently, does pretty much all the work for the research team. That leaves everyone time to chit-chat, mull over romances past and present, and hint at past events that are never explained (or that really aren't all that germane to the story). Meanwhile ...

The original novel and movie did include a bit of ""conspiracy"" about them. While Wildfire was originally set up by Congress at Dr Stone's recommendation, it was to decontaminate space probes and astronauts and deal with any infections they might bring back. The government looked upon it, and Project Scoop, as a way to gather and develop potential bioweapons; this comes out over the course of the original tale, but is really a sidelight to it, an addition to the caution that we Need To Be Careful Out There.

That's the part, though, that gets all the padding in the new miniseries. We get multiple government factions -- the DoD bioweapons head, his army gunsel, Homeland Security, a hapless president, a general whose motivations are mysterious -- and, of course, a doughty (and drug-addicted) journalist who's trying to track down this story and stay one step ahead of both the virus and the assassins sent to do him in.

(Yawn.)

It's layering cheap icing on the cake. It never really adds much -- except to distract from both the core story (which is bad) and the melodrama back at Wildfire (which, I guess, is good). You could excise the entire mess from the miniseries, and it wouldn't make a bit of difference to its resolution, but it would ratchet up the tension at Wildfire, rather than deflating it every time we cut to another scene.

There's so much more to criticize -- scientists too young (and pretty) for the long and distinguished careers they're supposed to have; the world's most incompetent governmental conspiracy; the laugh-out-loud climactic race against the Wildfire auto-destruct; the baby and old man who vanish after the first half; a telepathic, self-aware, highly-adaptive uber-virus that came from the future through a wormhole; egregious firing-squad breaches of security at a highly classified installation ... the list goes on.

When I saw ads in the movie theater for the miniseries, my thought was, ""Wow, it looks like The Andromeda Strain, only with car crashes."" I was at least partly correct: there were car crashes. But despite being able to be summed up with the same short paragraph in TV guide, I don't see much of the book, or original movie in here -- and that's a shame. In short, where this miniseries parallels the original, it does so in a muddled, mediocre fashion. Where it doesn't, it's even weaker. It adds nothing new to the original's vision, and the new stuff it does add feels more like it's one of those awful SciFi original movies than something from A&E.",1213228800,51,4227,4.858333333333333

Wow.  Fantastic and powerful.  Then they do what the contemporary film industry does -- remake a great film by watering down the action and suspense, tossing in a lot of smarmy politics, stressing an ecological message, and presenting a politically-correct cast.  Add some ridiculous and sketchy sci-fi details making it obvious that those writing the script weren't all that knowledgeable about science fiction or true science.  Wormholes?  Time travel?  Coincidences?  The movie is so busy focusing on current political and social issues that the real story gets lost.  Add to that, the personal lives of the cast are explored, when that isn't at all important to the story.  It should just focus on the virus and the effort to understand, thus cure, it.  More, political correctness actually was tossed aside as it looked like several helpless animals were killed in some of the scenes.  Disgusting.  To make the film even worse, they threw in a crusading journalist played by that guy from Will & Grace, who was pretty much arrogant and conceited throughout, as if he was doing us all a favor by being there -- even though his story line was nonsensical and extraneous, could have been edited out entirely.  Was it worse or better that the main character, played by Benjamin Bratt, even ended up romancing a fellow scientist on the team?  A lot of triviality just really destroyed the concept of this story, and I honestly fell asleep the first time I watched it, missing the last hour.  Because A&E reran the film several times, I was able to catch what I'd missed, but alas, it was just as bad as the other three hours.

Advertised as a television summer blockbuster event, it is a showpiece of wretched dialogue and bad science.
Like the killer inorganic life form which undergoes random mutations, the schlocky script makes random leaps, careens into illogical blind alleys and disregards the basic structure, style and principles of plotting with abandon. The makers would have had better luck having the sophisticated A.I. of the Wildfire center write the script.
Excusing it as a simply fun made for television entertainment would be ignoring its background. One might as well watch _Everybody Loves Raymond_ instead. We shouldn't have to endure passable television. Crichton's novel was packed with references to scientific literature and he fleshed it out as a real event. He wasn't asking What if?, he was pondering Why not? Since the novel's publication in the 70's, Richard Preston's _The Hot Zone_, David Gerrold's _The War Against The Chtorr_ series and numerous books have updated and re-envisioned biological/ecological attacks. A fine but maybe dated movie has already been made from Crichton's novel. Ridley Scott, the craftsman behind _Alien_ and _Blade Runner_ was the producer of the remake.
How could they have gone so wrong?
What should have been a taut story about scientists trapped in an Erlenmeyer flask of tension trying to solve a unique and deadly scientific puzzle turns out to be an over baked X-Files episode with various bits and pieces of other shows thrown in for good measure. Charred human remains, a chainsaw decapitation and a severed thumb do not make a well told story. They betray its SciFi channel origins.

3407613,1,B0017IVHHO,"Although my memory of them are vague, I have fond memories of both the original Michael Crichton&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/novel/dp/0060541814/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">novel</a>&nbsp;and the 1971&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/film/dp/B00008438U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">film</a>&nbsp;adaptation. So when I learned about the remake of the story, a four-hour miniseries, no less, I was very excited to see what would be done with this new incarnation of the Crichton thriller. Unfortunately the answer is ""not much.""

Probably the prototype for the classic ""plague-sweeping-the-world"" thriller, The Andromeda Strain in its original form is an exciting roller coaster ride of a thrillfest that kept you on the edge of your seat. The Andromeda Strain Miniseries, while not the worst film I've ever seen, or close to it, was a big disappointment compared to the expectations I had. Much of the plot and some of the characters were far too contrived, more like extraneous elements thrown in for effect than being integral parts of the tale. Although I enjoy a good government conspiracy story like the next guy or gal, the one woven into this piddling plot left me expecting to see the bad guys don black hats, grow long, thin mustaches, and cackle evilly as they grin into the camera for effect. Eric McCormack's character, the obligatory ""whistle-blower, drug addict"" that the government goes to the utmost ridiculous efforts to eliminate seemed so unnecessary that I began wanting to kill him myself.

Another flaw of this film is that it's practically got the words ""deux ex machina"" branded visibly onto every twist and turn, and some of those twists were as confounding as a dog trying to catch his own tail. If anyone sees this movie and thinks it even remotely reflects the writing skills of the original author, Michael Crichton, they will be grossly mistaken. In fact I feel that the author should the makers of this film for defamation of character, libel, character assassination, and any other trumped up charge humanly possible. In fact, the more I write about this movie, the more I realize just how much I dislike it.

In reality, the movie's no worse than a high budget ""B"" movie, somewhat like those that have become the staple of the Sci Fi Channel. The problem is that this film had much more promise, expectation, and a far higher foundation to build upon than most of those films, and somehow wound up being worse than those films. Those films knowingly don't take themselves seriously, but this film I feel wasn't taken nearly seriously enough. I hope the actors in this movie got paid well, because they certainly won't be getting any big time starring roles based on their work here. They all did their best with what they had, but unfortunately something from nothing is still nothing.

This is a first for me, but if I have to rate this film on a scale from 1 to 5, then I'd give it a 1. And except for those who are fans of completely mindless fun (and I'm not even sure this film qualifies as such), then the movie should be rated a negative 2. And since I rarely watch a film I find so many faults with, I think this film's failure is really sad.

3407614,1,B0017IVHHO,"Only a few minutes into this mess I was disgusted to find that it was just one more awful portrayal of emotionally stunted scientists.  The writing and direction convey not an ounce of urgency.  No one on the Wildfire A-team rounded up by the government seems even remotely shocked or disturbed by the 99% mortality rate of a mysterious new disease!  When a top surgeon is first told about this microbial juggernaut she smirks and says, ""Gee, you always have such good news for me.""  Then the two go on to chit chat about petty family problems.

The cynicism of these characters is truly stupefying.  If you have ever watched a few science documentaries, particularly those dealing with public health, you will know that real scientists are often driven by deep emotions and passions.  Dullards like those found in ""The Andromeda Strain (2008)"" exist only in the lazy minds of subliterate hack writers.

Please note that the recent SARS outbreak six years ago had a mortality rate of about 10%!  Our CDC and health agencies all over the world went into high gear to understand the disease and to check its progress.  In this crummy flick - which so earnestly throws around scientific lingo to establish credibility - the field of epidemiology is reduced to a cheap soap opera.

Good science fiction must be grounded in reality.  The only way to put science-based heroism up on the screen is to first understand the heroism of real scientists.  The disease warriors who literally risk their lives every day are a thousand times more interesting than the autistic bores found here.

3407624,1,B0017IVHHO,"Short Review:

It's bad.

Long Review:

I don't blame the actors, I believe they did what they could with the script they had.

I think the special effects were adequate, some of the tech stuff was a bit overdone and detracted from the story. For example, a lab technician running the tests would have been more realistic to me than a computer that can run any imaginable test immediately by voice command.

The subplots were waaaaaay out of control. By having so many side stories, the main story was diluted and couldn't build a sense of urgency.

The preachy environmentalist message changed what might have been an enjoyable sci-fi drama into yet another in a long line of 'save the Earth' movies. Don't get me wrong. I like the Earth. I really do. It's one of my favorite planets. I just don't need to be clubbed over the head with yet another environmentalist lecture. I think the movie as a whole would have been much better off without it.

If those were all the failings, I probably would have given this 3 or 4 stars. I could have suspended disbelief and enjoyed the show. But...

The wormhole/time travel element was so incredibly bad that it killed the movie for me. The story would have been so much better if they had just left the origin of Andromeda as an unknown. Simply say 'It came from somewhere in space.' and be done with it. But, if you're determined to use time travel as a story element, at least don't cause a paradox.

Minor Things that Irritated Me:

It appears that to be an effective doctor or scientist, one must be young and attractive. I suppose that anyone who is old, fat or just plain ugly could not possibly be of any help finding a cure to an infectious disease.

The 'cure' confused me. The progress of Andromeda was shown by the water and vegitation turning brown as Andromeda killed it. When the benevolent virus was released and consumed Andromeda, everything turned green again... did all the plants suddenly come back to life? Will the animals? Will the people?

I have a little problem with the idea that the sterno drinker who takes a bottle of aspirin a day and vomits huge amounts of blood was casually invited over to the fire station for a poker game. In my experience, the destitute and chronically ill are either a) hospitalized or b) shunned. I don't know, maybe it's a Utah thing.

In Conclusion:

This movie had a lot of things going for it. Unfortunately, it could not overcome a horribly ill-conceived script.",1212019200,134,2466,4.587699316628702
3407625,1,B0017IVHHO,"I was really looking forward to this event on A&E and I have to say if they had just stuck to the original storyline, this might have worked, but all the junk they added on top made it a terrible watch.

3407626,1,B0017IVHHO,"I was cautiously looking forward to the A&E Andromeda Strain series.  I loved the book and the Wise movie, but the SFX needed updating, and making it a miniseries would let more of the story be told.
What a fool I was.
It's grotesquely bad.  Aside from the moonbat content slathered on with a trowel, the original was a SCIENTIFIC thriller.  That's what made it unusual and extraordinary..and a multimillion-selling book that remains in print after nearly four decades.  So the Hollywood bozos, not understanding the concept, sort of hand-wave the science with a bunch of incorrectly-used buzzwords, and then drag out the PC/liberal playbook for making a generic Hollywood action flick.  Men stupid and bad (liberal men are...tolerable).  Woman wise and good.  Military stupid and evil.  Media wise and noble.  Bush lied!  Save the planet! Etcetera ad nauseum. (Seriously, the amount of PC/enviro/liberal/moonbat crap akwardly jammed into the film is amazing.)  The dialog sounds like a bowl of lumpy oatmeal.  One of the reasons the original book and movie were so scary is that they tried to convince you it was all real and plausible.  So in this lame version, when the chief scientist starts making open-line cell phone calls to the highly irritating reporter/meth-head from a ""sooper-dooper top secret locked-down hush-hush underground military bio-science lab,"" all you can do is laugh.  The final straw in part one is the scientists standing in a meeting room and watching a live feed (!!) from the HUD of an F-16 firing a ""nuclear-tipped missile""...which then ""accidently"" goes off.
Then I watched the last part, and it's worse, much worse.  First, I'll admit to skipping through chunks on 4x speed, but I'll bet I didn't miss anything worth seeing.  Basically, Andromeda is supposedly a warning sent from the future to stop us from ""raping the planet."" The film then disintegrates into hysterically awful SF gibberish about wormholes and most of the ending violates every law of physics and common sense I can think of. Example: the water coolant pool over the core of the nuclear reactor at the bottom of Wildfire is OPEN TO THE AIR (water reactors have to be sealed because they operate at about 70 atmospheres of pressure and 785 degrees F).  There's even worse, trust me.  I could go on and on and on....
All in all, it was the worst SF movie I've ever seen that wasn't made in the 50s (or direct to video), and Michael Crichton has every right to track down the screenwriter and club him to a pulp with a copy of the bloated script.
Not only am I annoyed they've ruined this hoped-for update, I'm even more annoyed that because they've pi55ed in the pool and now there probably won't be a good remake of the original for another decade or more.
