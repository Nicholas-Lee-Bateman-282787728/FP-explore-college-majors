Holly Hamilton (Marie Avgeropoulos) is a precocious Philadelphia high school senior who hacks into computers and commits insurance fraud and various other crimes--but only for the noblest of purposes. When she is framed for the murder of her best friend at a rave--which Holly, of course, only went to because her friend insisted--she must go on the run and prove her innocence to the local cops led by tough but compassionate detective and mom Cameron Langford (Christina Cox).

This made-for-TV production is the latest of MTI/Lifetime's ""at 17"" series, a little (but not much) rougher and grittier than its predecessors, ""Stalked at 17"" and ""Betrayed at 17."" Fans of this series should definitely enjoy it. It's professionally filmed with decent acting. Plot-wise, it pretty much follows the old formula, with a few tiny surprises and a classic ""Scooby Doo"" ending. This script is staid and unimaginative: I like to use memorable lines of dialogue as the titles of my reviews, but the best thing I could find here was the above closed captioned stage direction.

Simply entertaining but quite contrived: Although Holly has had her share of bad luck, she also has some rather amazing strokes of fortune. While Avgeropoulos does the best job possible of portraying her, this character is an unbelievable paragon of brilliance and off-center virtue, a veritable Robin Hood who, despite many of fate's turns working against her, has apparently never done one truly wrong or foolish thing in her entire life.

Subject matter notwithstanding, FUGITIVE AT 17 is TVland clean: An unexplicit rape attempt, some mild violence, lots of chase scenes, no real gore or nudity, a few ""damns"" and b-bombs but no f-bombs, etc.

Oh, well. I realize that films of this sort have their share of fans, and I hope those people won't take too much exception to my little wise-ass observations here.",1402272000,14,1891,5.048076923076923

I had some minor quibbles:  high school kids that can hack into any computer network in seconds, cops that always seem to be one step behind the 17-year olds, and the idea that crime isn't really crime if you are just ripping off a large, monolithic corporation.  In any case, it's a decent story that holds your attention and doesn't get TOO implausible at any point.

So they go to a party, they seperate, one guy tries to slip the friend a drug which given how already intoxicated she is she convulses leaving the teenager to find her practically dead.  She then is questioned and the police suspect her and take her into custody, then her inmate during transports breaks them free and the teen tries to prove her innocent.  Its a good movie...the teen is technically advanced as many are...and navigates through an adult world pretty well.  She then tries to prove her innocence to a female cop.

6286305,3,B00IQ8TT0K,Predictable plot. Computer genious teenager with some antisocial traits towards adults uses her abilities to scam the system fiercely loyal to her rich friend and even takes a rap for her. Friend gets murdered she's prime suspect. Can't trust cops so she decides to solve crime herself. Predictable ending.,1469232000,,306,5.26530612244898

6286310,3,B00IQ8TT0K,This was ok. But watching 26 year olds pretending to be 17 doesn't work. Can they not hire 17 year old actresses? Plus a lot of things that didn't work right.  Like searching the house in the daylight with the lights on but using a flashlight. Hacking big in to any pc with a close kc of a button...  I know it shouldn't matter but can't people make movies and at least try for some realism? Anyways after saying all that I watched all the way through and was entertained enough to give it a 3/5,1469232000,,495,4.145833333333333

Hire SME's (subject matter experts).

6286827,2,B00IQ8TT0K,"Wow. I guess if you like B movies, you might like this. I have no other explanation for the high reviews.

In the beginning of the movie, the main character has dark brown hair with a few pink strips. When she is running from the cops, she dyes her hair to change her appearance. What color does she choose? Brown. That's right.

The acting of the 2 main characters was OK, but at least a couple other actors must have been related to major contributors to the movie or those who directed/produced it.",1466726400,2,501,4.376344086021505

So this defies the stereotypes-- the superhero, beauty queen, genius girl hacker is a very nice person that loves her grandmother and her friends, even if she does not have the best judgement at times, which is how she got herself in this mess, that she has to extricate herself from, in the first place.

I received my copy on May 17, 2016 and as of today June 8, 2016 I have watched this movie 8 times. This movie is that good. I could go on and on and on, but I won't.
