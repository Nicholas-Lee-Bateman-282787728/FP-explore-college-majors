I would not reccommend this movie as when Shabana does an English speaking movie she performs as if she is frantic; unlike the subtleties she implements when she is doing a movie in her language. In English she rushes, in her language she moves fluidly.

8262413,5,B0016GONAK,"REVIEWED AT FLORENCE INDIAN FILM FESTIVAL, 2005, by ALEX DELEON (alexfarba@hotmail.com)

 The title of Aparna Sen's latest film, ""15 PARK AVENUE"", is an oblique reference to that most exclusive
 of New York streets where many of the wealthiest people in America used to have their private residences.
 Meethi, (Konkana Sen) an attractive young woman who can be very charming and appealing in her lucid moments,
 suffers from extreme delusions and has been diagnosed as incurably schizophrenic, although for a time she was
 engaged to a sincere young man whom she called ""Jojo"". Jojo (Rahul Bose) was aware of her condition but deeply in love,
 however, when her spells became too traumatic, the wedding was called off and he married another woman. Meethi has
 always been under the care of her much older, intellectual, and domineering sister Anjali (SHABANA AZMI). Anjali, herself
 a very attractive divorced woman of a certain age, supports the family, consisting of herself, her sister and their aged mother
 (Waheda Rehman),  by lecturing on Nuclear Physics and Quantum Mechanics (!!) at the local university -- (a nice touch
 attesting to India's highly advanced state in the theoretical sciences, of which there is precious little awareness in the
 Western world).
 A middle-aged academic colleague of hers keeps throwing himself at her feet, but Anjali has become much more interested
 in the white-haired psychiatrist, Kuman, who has been called in as a consultant on Meethi's difficult case and is more of an
 intellectual challenge to her. This is also a tricky relationship because Kuman is still committed to his own marriage, though
 obviously interested in the still very attractive quantum professorial Anjali. To complicate matters even more, Jojo who has
 been out of the picture for years with wife and young children, suddenly reappears to share in Meethi's delusionary world
 which has long been centered on the fixation of being happily married to him and living at number ""Fifteen Park Avenue""
 in Bombay -- an address which doesn't exist except in her feverish mind -- During this chance meeting at a Himalayan
 mountain resort Meethi fails to recognize him as her long-lost Jojo, but accepts his complicity in her dream world as she feels
 that everyone else is against her. In the strangely mystical ending Meethi steps out of this world into the perfect world at the
 non-existent address 15 Park Avenue, where she is joined by her loving husband and a gaggle of joyful kids -- but
 bear in mind that the Monopoly board location, which is mistakenly mentioned as ""Park Avenue"" at several points in the film,
 is actually Park Place!

There is much more to this picture than the cursory plot summary above might indicate, for the insights it provides into the lives  of the contemporary Indian intelligentsia as well as for the  depiction of the constant battle between cold rationalism and subjective emotionalism which is a leit motif throughout the film. The dialogue, especially in the first half of the picture, may sound excessively stiff and unreal to Western ears, but, apparently, this is the way westernized Indian intellectuals talk. Moreover, the Freudian analyses  which take up much of the second half of the film, sound like a throwback to  Hollywood movies of the forties when Freud was all the thing --  and makes it seem like the Indians of today are just now catching up on long over-baked Western psychology ... However -- and it is a big ""however"" -- whatever the trivialities of the plot from a jaded western point of view, it is the personalities of the players, the excellence of the acting, and the  humanitarian warmth throughout  which makes all else secondary. There are really two, if not three central figures: (1) Meethi, the disturbed young lady as portrayed  by Konkona Sen Sharma, a talented  actress who happens to be the daughter of director Aparna Sen, (2) the charismatic Shabana Azmi, who portrays the older protective sister and is one of India's leading older movie stars -- to see her is to understand why,  and (3) ""Jojo"" -- the long-lost lover with an overweaning sense of responsibility, played by now 40 year old actor Rahul Bose, a favorite leading man of the director's and an unforgettable presence of every film he's in. Whether a striking piece of work like this will  ever be seen outside of film festivals is an open question, however it seems to me that an enterprising American distributor could do very well with this pic because it has universal appeal and universally appealing performers.",1286928000,4,4572,4.992073976221929
