8464709,5,B0002BBUKQ,Lava Flows and Lava Tubes (DVD) provides the viewer with the opportunity to watch actual Hawaiian volcanic eruptions.  The resulting features and terminology are all explained in a simple yet informative manner.  A very nice comparison is made between the recent Hawaiian flows and prehistoric flows from the western continental United States.  The producers obviously have a great love for their work and it shines through in the many beautiful images of eruptions and lava flows.  Included on the DVD is another feature on the past eruptions of Kilauea with images that are breath-taking.  This production presents an excellent overview of Hawaiian-style eruptions (excellent teaching resource!) and the fruits of many years of studying and filming the eruptions on the Big Island of Hawaii.  I highly recommend this DVD.,1063584000,11,823,5.341085271317829
