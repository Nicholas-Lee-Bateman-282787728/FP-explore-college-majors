8111036,1,B000ELJ3EY,"I bought this DVD set as new and factory sealed. When I got it, it was NOT factory sealed. One of the DVD's had six big deep scratches in it. I had to pay the shipping to send it back. It's NOT my fault the seller sent me a used, scratched DVD.",1390608000,,244,3.7115384615384617
8111037,1,B000ELJ3EY,"I seriously discourage you from purchasing this subliminal program CD. It promises to help free you from fear and stress, but focuses on nothing but stress and fear! How can saying things like ""I let go of my fear and stress..."", among other suggestions with the words 'fear and stress' in them, possibly help get your mind away from thinking about fear and stress? To be helpful, a subliminal or indeed any program claiming to give relief from fear and stress needs to focus solely on things like safety, relaxation, peace of mind, calmness, and so forth--the positive aspects you want to cultivate, not constantly bring up the negative ones you want to avoid. It is for this reason I will be throwing my copy in the trash rather than donating it to charity, since I wouldn't want it falling into the hands of someone who may not know better. It's an extremely good idea to look into the specific wording of the suggestions that will be piped directly into your subconscious mind before using any subliminal CD, and preferably before buying it if possible, since your conscious mind will not be able to edit those suggestions for you beforehand. Make sure they are things that you actually want to be a part of your mind in the first place.",1380067200,,1241,4.6454545454545455
8111038,3,B000ELJ3EY,The music used is not obnoxious. The CD last for about a half hour. I've used it a couple of times. I'm not sure subliminal programs work. But I'm going to check it out.,1217808000,,169,4.0
8111039,5,B000ELJ3EY,"I am very pleased with the results I received by watching the dvd and listening to the cd.  I used to get sick to my stomach from fear & stress.  Since I have been doing the program, I find that I don't get as fearful.  I used to get anxiety & panic attacks, but I haven't had any since using this subliminal program.  I did the program for 30 days with great results.  I am still doing it as I got my husband into it and we watch it together.  He is also seeing an improvement in himself. I am continuing to improve the more I watch the dvd and listen to the cd.  I watch the dvd every night, and listen to the cd first thing in the morning and again before I go to work in the afternoon.  I find the program to be very calming and it allows me to go about my day with very little anxiety, which is a major accomplishment for me!  This program, for me, was money very well spent!!!",1165622400,8,882,3.937853107344633
8111040,5,B000ELJ3EY,"Recently while searching for some music, I came across Steve Murray's DVD programs for attunement. First impression was that, this must be fake. As it was in total contradiction to the learning's I learnt during my Reiki 2nd degree in India. I went on to read the reviews and none of the reviews were negative. All people including some Reiki masters were in praises for Steve's program. I took the chance and ordered his first book, 1st cd and DVD attunement for 2nd degree. I wanted to take this again for reinforcement and to give my wife 2nd degree who was a 1st degree. (My intention was to try his claim first before I venture into a master attunement of Reiki through DVD)

 Last week I received the dvd and the first thing was to play the dvd to see myself, if it works. It did work. It was a very powerful attunement & I received it all through a DVD, isn't it amazing.. Immediately after that my wife took the attunement and she also felt extreme heat and tingling sensation. Now she is a 2nd degree and her Reiki is flowing beautifully. The first line of his book, which says ""I believe at this very moment as you read this, our vibrations and energies are connected in the now"". As soon as I read this I felt I am connected to Steve. When I played his attunement cd part 1, I felt a gentle shower of Reiki all over me. Its playing right now and I can feel Reiki all around me. Since then I have taken both 1st & 2nd degree attunements a couple of times and every time I feel an increase in my energy levels. I feel my hearing ability has increased; now I can pick up sounds quite far from me. My smelling ability has increased, my concentration and consciousness has increased too.

 Giving attunements like this proves that Reiki works in past present and future all layered together. This even supports the string theory proposed by Einstein and the 11 dimensions we live in. probably Reiki works in all those 11 dimensions just by our intent. Steve has done a great think to mankind by his video programs. He is in fact a time traveler who travels forward and backwards in time by his Reiki and gives the attunement to us whenever we watch his videos and listen to his cds. His attunements on Dvd cost just 30 whereas taking a master attunement cost $1,000 in India and up to $10,000 in US. He has made Reiki available to the masses virtually at no cost. This way more and more people can use this power and be healed and heal others. Reiki is a free gift from the supreme power and should be available for masses. I honor his Reiki mission which is to spread Reiki to everybody for their betterment.

I also ordered his subliminal programs; currently I am using Quit Smoking and Stress relief. Only 3 days have passed doing these programs. I already feel that my stress levels are going down. The second day I lit the cigarette but I couldn't pull, I felt as if the smoke is killing me. Immediate reaction was to throw the cigarette and now I don't feel like smoking anymore, touchwood. Next weekend I will be taking my master level attunement and I feel so happy about it.

I recommend the entire set of dvd's and books by Steve to everyone who is on a spiritual or just healing journey. Once you use these products with a open mind, your life will never be the same again

I urge everybody to experience Reiki. It can change your life for good in so many ways. It will heal you on all levels and make your surroundings more pleasant. After some time of continuous use, you will feel that things have started falling back in place on their own. You can go and take a Reiki session from a Reiki healer or try ""Reiki 1st Level Attunement - Become a Reiki Healer (2004)"" by Steve Murray. Any of the options will not cost you more then 30 - 40 bucks and you can experience the divine power of Reiki. It's such a nice experience to feel life sustaining force flowing through your body at your wish and you can direct it anywhere you like, even heal a living being. From there it will depend on your fate and your karma. But at least let your body experience it once. I can bet that this might be the best investment you can ever make in your entire life.",1160524800,3,4166,4.333333333333333
8111041,4,B000ELJ3EY,"This DVD is only 20 min long with a on screen written & narrated 6 min intro about what subliminal is, how it & the unconscious mind works & how to use this program everyday for 30 days. They also remind you that subliminal messages are everywhere in advertising used to get us to buy their products.

I was apprehensive at first, worrying they too can add a nefarious message as well. As I watched a series of waterfalls with babbling water & light music, it helps me to sleep at night as well. There are only 5 statements said once about 4x throughout the waterfall scenes of displayed words & Steve Murray's voice.

I haven't been using it religiously, but the times I have used it more diligently, friends have said I seem much more calm & relaxed. The other day I almost got into a car accident because it was a small, very congested, narrow town road & a mini van came out quick from the left side of the street parking lot in front of me & other many cars. Though barely missed him by a few feet by slamming on my brakes, my heart barely skipped a beat, I felt still in control & I didn't curse or freak out. Who knows, maybe it works?

Steve Murray who is a Reiki Master & also has a series of Reiki DVDs at healingreiki also makes this.",1155513600,3,1245,4.200836820083682
