2529593,5,B000EQ47PY,Red Skelton was one of the best comedians ever.  He wasn't vulgar and he always had a heartfelt goodnight for his viewers at the end of each show.  This was his last season on tv and NBC tried to make it a bit more hip with some dancers to introduce the segments but Red was his usual self and you can see he and the guest stars are having a good time.,1385856000,,352,3.875
2529594,1,B000EQ47PY,Looks like a release of episodes that have been released before. Had hoped that Shout! would do a better job. Release episode that have not been released. Full seasons. I would be glad to help.,1356048000,,193,4.542857142857143
2529595,3,B000EQ47PY,"The order came as expected. I ordered it as a gift for my dad's 80th birthday. I didn't realize that there were musical selections after each episode. We could have done without that. I wished that there were only the comedy episodes and not the singing. I also wished that the episodes were continous and not have to select the next feature.  I had hoped that it would just flow from one episode to the next. My dad is having a hard time using the remote to make the selections. Because of this fact, I don't think he is enjoying it as much as I would have hoped.",1311120000,12,564,4.222222222222222
2529596,5,B000EQ47PY,"A gift for my dad, this is the ultimate collection of red skelton. It was very funny and well worth the price.",1297900800,10,110,4.045454545454546
2529597,5,B000EQ47PY,"Red Skelton is great no matter if his work was done in black and white or color. He was on radio, tv and in movies.  Any collection of his is a great treasure to own. I wish they would do like was done with the Marx Brothers movies and put then as a complete collection. The same with his tv shows and the specals he did.",1260662400,16,321,3.8636363636363638
2529598,3,B000EQ47PY,"Frankly, I was disapointed that it was all his older stuff and was all black and white.  I don't really care for his earlier routines and like his later acts much more.  I think that the color routines would sell much better.",1254700800,15,225,4.333333333333333
2529599,5,B000EQ47PY,"The selections were many and good, the performances great, but for a good keepsake, the films should have been restored. Some were early tv quality at best.",1227916800,,156,4.814814814814815
2529600,5,B000EQ47PY,I've always been a Red Skelton fan and this reminds me why. Lots of fun to watch.,1176163200,,81,3.823529411764706
2529601,2,B000EQ47PY,Missing quite a few episodes-no Heathcliff and Gertrude.,1422835200,,56,6.125
2529602,5,B000EQ47PY,"I got this set as a Christmas present for my dad (in his 60s) and he absolutely loves it! Said it's great to see the ""greatest comedian who ever lived"" again. He's watched the first disc, I think, and was pleased with the content and quality.",1420588800,,242,4.282608695652174
2529603,4,B000EQ47PY,I am happy to have this to remember Red.  Good for family viewing.,1418515200,,66,4.076923076923077
2529604,3,B000EQ47PY,"This has been replaced by the 8-disc ""Ultimate Collection"" adding two more discs of shows,",1414627200,2,90,5.066666666666666
2529605,5,B000EQ47PY,"For some strange reason, these discs are not numbered.  They just have catalogue numbers.
The discs also do not call themselves ""The Ultimate Collection"", but rather 'America's Clown Prince"". This is probably because it replaces the 6-disc ""America's Clown Prince Collection"" by adding 2 new discs.
The shows are complete but without original commercials.

2529606,5,B000EQ47PY,I REALLY LIKE RED SKELTON. I DID NOT GET TO WATCH HIS SHOWS ON TV BECAUSE I DID NOT HAVE A TV UNTIL I WAS IN MY LATE TEENS. CAN NOT WAIT TO WATCH THIS.,1393459200,,151,3.342857142857143
2529607,5,B000EQ47PY,"For those that remember Red, you know what this is.  For those that are too young, I recommend it for some good, clean comedy.  He really was a funny guy.",1393286400,,154,4.1
2529608,1,B000EQ47PY,I was very disappointed to find that so much of his humor was based on drunkeness and sexual innuendo. I tend to forget that TV wasn't really all that great even back then.,1389744000,,172,4.242424242424242
2529609,5,B000EQ47PY,I gave it to my husband for Christmas and he loved it.  It was something he had been wanting for a while.  It was a hit with him.,1389312000,,129,3.5714285714285716
2529610,5,B000EQ47PY,It brings back the old TV shows he likes best.  Not so much shoot-n-kill TV that he hates to watch.,1389139200,,99,3.95
8113240,4,B000EQ47PY,"I love Red Skelton, no matter what.  When I ordered these DVD's I thought I was getting some of his later comedy acts.  Maybe I should have read the description a bit more carefully.  My fault, no one else's.  The DVD's themselves are fine a few minor flaws, but nothing major. My family and I are big Red fans, and we love his shows regardless of how new or old they are.",1503273600,,372,4.125
