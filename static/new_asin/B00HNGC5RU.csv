Greatest Superstars Of The 21st Century:
The 21st Century (so far) has seen a bunch of changes in the ""WWE Universe"" from the name ""World Wrestling Federation/WWF"" not longer existing to WWE not having direct competition from WCW/NWA for the first time in decades but one of the biggest thing is the arrival of new superstars along with the elevations of others which WWE put together what they see as the top superstars in the past decade here. Now this release is no different than their previous DVD sets in this format (Top 50 Superstars, Greatest Stars Of The 80's & 90's) where WWE has a list for the subject at hand with various talents from the past & present commenting on the superstar's careers while showing video packages of their career but this DVD set doesn't have a host & is only narrated by a voice over while showing a list of what their top 3 highlights of the previous decade were before their chapter. It should also be noted that all the interviews & comments on here were taken for this set with none being reused from previous projects as we hear from various people such as Josh Matthews, Santino Marella, Billy Kidman, The Miz, John Cena, Daniel Bryan, Kofi Kingson, Arn Anderson, Matt Striker, Melina, Alex Riley, Alicia Fox, The Bella Twins, Kaityln, Natayla.

Allied Powers - The World's Greatest Tag Teams:
Tag team wrestling has become a lost art in the WWE for the past couple of years but at least WWE hasn't completely forgotten about the past history of tag team wrestling with this release completely revolved around tag team wrestling. This set is hosted by the best WWE tag team (at that time) in John Morrison & The Miz...and if anyone has seen their webshow ""The Dirt Sheet"", you know they can be entertaining & did a good job hosting this set. I'll give credit to WWE in that although they couldn't possibly put a match showcasing every single major tag team for over the past couple of decades, they did at least have various highlight reels mentioning various tag teams broken down into different subjects like aerial teams (Steamboat & Youngblood, High Flyers), brothers (Ole & Arn Anderson, Taker & Kane, Vallants, Strongbows, Smokin' Gunns), and other honorable mentions (MNM, Billy & Chuck, Austin & Pillman, A.P.A.).
Various matches include British Bulldogs vs. Hart Foundation (""MSG"" Sep. 85), Steiners vs. Hase & Sasaki (WCW/New Japan Supershow 91), Killer Bees vs. Demolition in a 2 Out Of 3 Falls match (Oct. 87), Hardy Boyz vs. Edge & Christian (King Of The Ring 99), Fabulous Freebirds vs. Kerry & Kevin Von Erich in a Country Whipping Match (""WCCW"" Oct 83), Funks vs. Briscos (CWF), Harlem Heat vs. Steiners (WCW Hog Wild 96), Midnight Express vs. Fantastics (NWA Great American Bash 88), Nasty Boys vs. Public Enemy in a Falls Count Anywhere Street Fight Match (WCW SuperBrawl VI), and Rockers vs. Brain Busters (""MSG"" Mar. 89).

Top 50 Superstars of All Time:
Without a doubt, one of the most controversial DVD sets of the year here as WWE comprised a list showcasing what they see as the Top 50 Superstars Of All Time. Now let me get this out of the way before anything else in that the selections for this set are really no different than their previous sets ranking superstars (Greatest Wrestling Stars Of 80's & 90's) in that it's always going to be controversial no matter who or how they rank the superstars because WWE will never come out with a list that pleases everyone because everyone has a different criteria & view along with the obvious case in that WWE will show a heavy bias towards talents that they created or are in their ""good graces"" against those who aren't for obvious reasons (such as the on-again/off-again relationship with Hulk Hogan who's currently TNA). Speaking of Hogan, he even said it himself that the list is nothing more than a ""work"" which at the end of the day, it is & you just can't take too seriously or think about too much because it is what it is with the fact being that the rankings on this list don't hold any relevance outside of this DVD set.
Now the documentary itself is hosted by Todd Grisham & has a short two min. profile for every 51 superstars (watch or read the list to see how they got that number) with various talents from the past & present giving comments on the wrestler with some of the comments being from old interviews & a few new ones. Throughout the presentation, you'll hear from: Paul ""The Butcher"" Vachon, Ronnie Garvin, John Cena, Gerald Brisco, William Regal, Jerry Lawler, Triple H, J.J. Dillion, Josh Matthews, Matt Striker, Dolph Ziggler, Kofi Kingston, Santino Marella, The Miz, Arnold Skalland, Antonio Anoki, Dory Funk Jr., Ted Dibiase Sr., Terry Funk, Shannon Moore, Gregory Helms, Chris Jericho, Edge, Jim Ross, Honky Tonk Man, Pat Patterson, Jim Brunzel, Christian, Michael Hayes, Gene Okerland, MLB star Wade Boggs, Ric Flair, Billy Kidman, H.D. Smith, Vince McMahon, Bobby Heenan, Ken Patera, Hulk Hogan, Ron Simmons, Jim Cornette, Fabulous Moolah, Joey Styles, Billy Graham, Ernie Ladd, Sgt. Slaughters, Stephanie McMahon, Mae Young, Sensational Sherri, M.V.P., Steve Williams, John Morrison, Steve Austin, Arn Anderson, Harley Race, The Destroyer, ex-NWA president Bob Geigel, Rey Mysterio, Michael Cole, George Steel, ex-NWA referee Tommy Young, Greg Valentine, Roddy Piper, Bruce Prichard, Blackjack Lanza, Rocky Johnson, and Vince McMahon Sr.

The only feedback I have on the Superstars Of The 21st Century documentary is that the ""divas"" chapter shouldn't have been limited to just those four girls because you can't deny that females like Victoria & Mickie James & Melina & Beth Phoenix had made their presence felt in the ""21st Century"" as far as the divas go but past that, it was what you would expect for this type of project & well put together.  The huge positive here is that was probably the best use of WWE's video vault in a very long time as we got a bunch of rare footage from different federations to the point where some of them were never even released to VHS which gave us some lost classics & historic encounters with the minor faults I found with this DVD set was that it could have been better organized as the matches & profiles seemed to be all over the place instead of some order making this was an enjoyable DVD set but it wasn't as good as it could have been.  I already gave my feelings on the ""rankings"" of the Top 50 Superstars list but I was just happy to see profiles & comments on certain wrestlers that you don't really hear about much anymore (Killer Kowalski, Georgous George, Lou Thesz, Bruno Sammartino, Freddie Blassie) along with some of my past favorites (Ted Dibiase Sr., Rick Rude, Jake Roberts, Terry Funk) & liked the presentation they gave us if you can get past the entire ""rankings"" then this is something I would recommend for a viewing.  In the end, this is one of those sets I would get strictly a fan of the documentary presentations.",1403568000,,10131,4.879790940766551
8633783,1,B00HNGC5RU,"This seems like a really good deal but it's not. The reason: all three of these features are originally 3-disc sets, condensed into a total of 3 discs. This cuts out too much of the good stuff. A total waste of money. Instead, purchase the actual 3-disc set of any of these that you are interested in, but this condensed version really sucks.",1402790400,,342,4.444444444444445
