7874963,1,6304611609,I note already that opinions run greatly against this set and I agree with them. The ratio of the size of the tape set to the quantity of interesting content approaches infinity. Everything is terrible. Total scam of the people's money in selling this set. Probably the Mafia made it.,1409616000,,284,4.7
7874964,1,6304611609,I'm somewhat upset that it doesn't allow me to use zero stars.  I paid $15 for the set and feel extremely ripped off!!  This was awful to watch!  It could actaully be a decent comedy if you get over the fact that it's supposed to be informative.  The storyline is not even linear.  I feel duped because I spend money on this trash.,1171238400,,331,4.190476190476191
7874965,2,6304611609,"Being a mafia buff, I was pleased to see a 10 TAPE series on the Italian mob.  I was fairly disappointed when I got it home.  The quality was quite poor (sound, picture, cinematography), plus I was hoping for some sort of narration to go along with it, but it was all comprised of low budget interviews.
The tapes were very scattered and sporadic in their content and barely covered the topics they were supposed to and constantly went off topic.  For example, the tape on Gotti barely scratched the surface concerning Gotti, and the next thing you know they are briefly talking about  Japanese organized crime, like it was thrown in as an afterthought.
Though there were a few interesting bits of information, there was nothing that my few mafia books didn't cover in more detail.  Overall, a very disappointing series which could and should have been so much better.",978480000,,868,4.7218543046357615
7874966,1,6304611609,This set is  extremly dissapointing. can you believe that tape number ten is just clips from the previous 9 tapes. It was like i had to watch the other 9 pieces of trash all over again. Do yourself a favor and buy the A and E 4 tape set of Las Vegas. It is well worth the price two-fold. I just put this tape set in the sanitation garbage truck.,969494400,2,345,3.9285714285714284
7874967,1,6304611609,...but then gets repetitive and boring. These DVDs feel as though they were made by amateurs. The commentary gets old quickly and there isn't much of anything new to be learnt. I never got to the end of the last DVD so I  can't tell if it gets better as you near the end.,962236800,9,271,4.018518518518518
7874968,1,6304611609,"Brutal.  And I thought Blair Witch Project was the ultimate in nauseum through poor production. There is some decent content in a few of these programs but the production and sound quality are so incredibly bad you'll  grow disinterested quickly. During the piece on the Kennedy's involvement  with the Mafia, they show the famous clip of the assassination and just as  Kennedy is about to get shot, they block out his face (like they do on real  life cop shows to protect the identity of the people involved) and insert a  re-created scene and then back to more block out footage. Throw in the  garbled Jimi Hendrixx music and it just doesn't get any worse. If your used  to the slick production of A&E produced Mafia programs, you'll be  extremely dissapointed.  Don't waste your time.  Throw in your worn copy of  Goodfellas or the Godfather trilogy and enjoy!",955670400,6,863,4.756756756756757
7874969,2,6304611609,"This is a pretty good expose on the history of the Mafia.  I am nowhere near an expert in such things, but this set interested me as I have read the occasional Mafia novel, and this set was just so dang cheap.
The  first few DVD's were pretty entertaining and informative, going through the  history of how the Mafia came into existance.  From Bonnie and Clyde to  John Gotti it was pretty good.
After a few DVD's though it started  repeating itself.  The same Bonnie and Clyde clips, same Gotti stuff too.  One of the DVD's as a matter of fact seems to be just a summary of what the  other four DVD's went through.
I probably won't watch these again, but I  learned a little anyways.
The quality is pretty poor, but I didn't expect  much.  I knew it was just some type of program copied from an A & E  special or something.  Plus what do you expect from old news clips anyways.",935107200,10,878,4.242424242424242
