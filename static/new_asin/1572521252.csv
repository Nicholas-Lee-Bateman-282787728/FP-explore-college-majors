188461,5,1572521252,"""My Life to Live (""Vivre Sa Vie),"" released in 1962, was director Jean-Luc Godard's fourth feature film and one of the finest, most exhilarating examples of the French New Wave. The great cultural critic Susan Sontag considered the film to be ""one of the most extraordinary, beautiful, and original works of art that I know of."" The film is now forty years old, and since its original release it has, unfortunately, been somewhat forgotten, not nearly referred to as much as Godard's ""Breathless"" and ""Weekend."" In many ways, however, ""My Life to Live"" is Godard's most accomplished work. It encapsulates all of the main cinematic innovations of the New Wave movement; in its visual style, it is refreshingly innovative (even decades later) and often awfully beautiful; and it redefines cinematic history at the same time that it pays homage to that history.
""My Life to Live"" is part crime drama, part B-movie, but, most of all, the story of a young Parisian woman's descent into prostitution and existential trauma. It offers little or no overt explanation for events or for the choices and actions made by its characters. It proceeds largely through dialogue. And it features the kinds of jump cuts and self-referential awareness common to this style of cinema (not to mention the references to other sources of culture, including a shot of a movie theater playing Francois Truffaut's ""Jules and Jim,"" another exponent of the French New Wave). Viewers raised on Hollywood movies who have not had much exposure to this style of filmmaking will find ""My Life to Live"" difficult and, to an extent, somewhat unsatisfying, only because it does not conform to American narrative or cinematic conventions. It is both formally groundbreaking in its visual style and unique in its narrative structure.
That narrative structure is based upon twelve tableaux, each with its own chapter reference. If Godard had admitted that this was to make the film more understandable, it was also to give it a pseudo-documentary feel. In that sense, ""My Life to Live"" blends reality and fiction, film drama and documentary, into a cohesive experience. The camera embodies Godard's approach. Its movement means several things at one time: a visual language that defied the standards of traditional film photography (watch how Godard films conversatins in ""My Life to Live""); a sense of documentary, as if Godard was portraying a non-fictional account of a woman's descent into prostitution in post-war Paris; and a technique in which it seems that the camera is always aware of what it is doing.
And what is the camera doing? Most of all, it is obsessed with its protagonist, Nana, played by the chic, mesmerizing Anna Karina, who was Godard's wife at the time. ""My Life to Live"" is as much a study of her as it is of its fictional subject. Godard's camera lingers on her face, producing some of the most staggeringly beautiful moments in cinematic history and also allowing Karina's outward image to tell exactly what she is experiencing internally. In one of the film's most celebrated passages, Karina's face, eyes wide open and full of tears, fills up the entire screen as she watches Carl Dreyer's equally groundbreaking silent film ""The Passion of Joan of Arc."" Karina's close-up replaces Maria Falconetti's and becomes just as enigmatic.
""My Life to Live"" is a film of multiple artistic merits, one of Godard's finest achievements, and an emblem of the French New Wave. Serious film buffs should not be without it.
Now, a few words about the DVD. Fox Lorber is notorious for producing poor digitial transfers of their films, and ""My Life to Live"" is no exception. The transfer is actually better than most of their products and is quite passable, with some noticeable image spoilation here and there and with a relatively mediocre audio track. Having said that, most viewers should not have too much of an issue with this disc's quality. The aspect ratio is 1.33:1, the same as a standard television screen, so this looks like a pan and scan version. I do not know if this is the same aspect ratio of the original theatrical print, but if you are expecting widescreen, you won't get it here (although this should not preclude viewers from purchasing this fantastic film).
(And, last but not least, a somewhat related jibe: if you are coming to Godard because you are a Quentin Tarantino fan, you will find that many of the ideas and techniques Tarantino employed in ""Pulp Fiction"" were lifted right out of this film, in addition to others by Godard. Seeing both, you will realize that Tarantino really isn't that original after all and that Godard was far superior.)",1032134400,23,4651,4.94125159642401
188462,3,1572521252,"To be perfectly honest, I don't really consider myself a Godard fan so much. I did and still do enjoy ""Breathless"", but he's films never seemed to grab me. They never ""move me"" or seem to carry any sort of ""heart"". Now, don't get me wrong, I do have respect for him as a filmmaker, as I'm a wannabe be one myself. But it took this film to make me realize, Godard could ""move me"". Some may find the content of this movie reminiscent to that of ""Belle De Jour"" and\or ""Nights Of Cabiria"". Wonderful acting by Anna Karina (and as stated by other reviewers, she was Godard's wife). The character is one many may or may not feel sorry for. The more you sympathize with the character the more you'll be able to enjoy the movie. I know Godard is know for his ""disjointed"" style of filmmaking, but this film is quite well put together. The begining scene with Anna and her husband did get to me alittle bit. I don't understand why it was shot the way it was. None the less, a very good movie all filmbuffs should watch. Wonderful acting, directing, screenplay, and photography (for the most part)! A Godard classic!",977011200,3,1107,4.404878048780488
188463,5,1572521252,"this movie i think will surprise most fans of godard accustomed to his formalism or his quotations of culture and art that some people regard as  childish. which it does not mean that the movie is not interesting formally  but i rarely cared about form since it seems it might be the movie in which  godard cared the most about its content and characters; which cannot of  course be said about the more famous and more representative of godard's  style ""breathless"" which not surprisingly influenced some rather  shallow, self indulgent filmakers such as martin scorsese or quentin  tarantino. the movie moved me so much it made cry. the story of a young  woman who leaves her unhappy relationship with her husband to seek an  opportunity in the movies but instead must become a prostitute to support  herself, is presented in a almost documentary-like style which lets the  events speak for themselves and which lets the viewer see inside the girl's  soul. theres no cheap manipulative music or exagerated acting. the camera  style resembles more the simplicity and stillness of a movie by bresson or  dreyer. this style was also used to great effect in  ""Masculin/Femenin"" but here it leaves from the attention of the  viewer which will most likely be caught by the great touching performance  of anna karina. i cannot do anything right now but recommend this movie  which just shows the awesome potential of cinema as an artform.",965865600,9,1432,4.895833333333333
188464,5,1572521252,"(Lend yourself to others and give yourself to yourself---Montaigne): ominous advice for the heroine of one of Godard's most easily digestable and congenial films. A seamless and cohesive twelve chapter documentary,  _My Life to Live_, starring Godard's then wife Anna Karina, succeeds at  striking the perfect balance between the filmmaker's more esoteric artistic  tendencies and the ability to relate to a more mainstream audience.  Loosely, the plot involves Nana, a 22-year old woman who leaves her husband  and takes up casual prostitution. No doubt it is also an allusion to Emile  Zola's novel about a female courtesan of the same name. Brilliant camera  work is especially evident in the opening scene where we are introduced to  Nana and her husband not by their faces, but by an affronting view of the  backs of their heads. This visual device is used throughout and is  contrasted with some mesmerizing shots of Joan-of-Arc-coiffed Karina,  staring directly at the camera. If you thought Godard too intellectual or  abrupt, give this film a try.",960940800,8,1056,5.183431952662722
188465,4,1572521252,"Swiss director Jean-Luc Godard is one of the directors who has changed the way we look at movies nowadays. Along with D.W. Griffith, Orson Welles and a few others, he's part of Movie History. With a dozen movies in the  sixties, he has dynamited the classic cinematographical grammar. He's a  Master. Period.
There's still a little problem. Actually, nobody, except  perhaps one or two Woody Allen clones in New-York, has the opportunity to  watch his work. And there is a terrible rumor about him : he's an  intellectual and his movies are 1) boring 2) hard to understand and 3) in  french with english subtitles. You can't fight with that and I  won't.
Just let me say that at least one scene of MY LIFE TO LIVE is a  cinematographical pearl, one of these moments during which you feel that  cinema is really the seventh art. Anna Karina's juvenile dance around the  pools, shot alternatively with a subjective and an objective point of view  is a scene to be watched again and again. And there are a lot of arty ideas  or effects in MY LIFE TO LIVE that will be stolen from Godard by the new  generation of filmmakers.
But discover this movie by yourself in this  above-average DVD transfer. And don't worry if you don't understand all the  subtleties of MY LIFE TO LIVE. I doubt Jean-Luc did.
A DVD for the  curious ones.",956275200,9,1325,4.5508474576271185
188466,5,1572521252,"I keep coming back to Godard. What can I do, he's one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, and everything he made in the 60's with Anna Karina (his then wife) is absolutely amazing. I'm not using the word amazing  loosely here either...this film in particular fills one with awe. It's  style borrows something from Dreyer's ""The Passion of Joan of  Arc"" (which Nana watches in this film) although not in a direct way.  It is completely unique, original, and highly inventive filmmaking, using a  number of cinematic tricks and devices that Godard was so enthusiastic  about playing with. Here, they all work. I cannot recommend this movie  highly enough. It is beautiful.",954720000,6,674,4.859649122807017
188467,5,1572521252,"My life to live is movie which breaks all of the rules of movies... From the opening shots the darkened profile of anna karina, to the opening scene in which the backs of the two characters in conversation are filmed.. this is Godard a man who loves to confront his audience and to challenge his audience.. But My Life to Live is more than just experimentation in celluloid, it is also a tale of a woman who falls into a life of prostitution.. and it delves into such topics as philosophy, religon, and poetry.. This is a perfectly paced film - each chapter illustrating something the director wants to tell us of the characters..

It is one of the rare gems of the new wave.",1171238400,,675,4.4
188468,5,1572521252,"I've enjoyed Godard before, especially ""Breathless,"" but this film is Godard's most powerful.  Anna Karina is an out of work Dutch actress in poverty.  She slips from shop girl to streetwalker.  The world of suave French pimps and sex workers of 1962 in black and white fascinates.  Sex, sex for francs always fascinates.  Nana is herself, and she is a prostitute.  She has chosen this role because it is all the work she has been offered.  It is the entertainment business after all.  At first, the stranger that wants to kiss her disgusts, but before long she is making money and has a philosophical young pimp to show her the ropes.  Nana entertains her John's every whim, as do all the streetwalkers of Paris. The result is a moralistic tragedy, but the telling of the tale in weird, faceless shots with a cold, winter Paris are the antitheses of films like the golden summers of ""Gigi.""  I remember those streets from my travels in the mid-century. There is Goddard style and there is the seamy side of prostitution even if the whore is as young and beautiful as Anna Karina.  The prettier, the more successful, in the sex trade.

I must tell the review reader that much of European prostitution, perhaps in America too is slavery - forced sex work.  The victims are young East European girls from the old Iron Curtain, and don't kid yourself; they are slaves and many, if not all, have been beaten, gang raped, and disfigured.  Many have venereal disease.  Am I being over dramatic? I know -- they smile at a John, but don't be naive.  Remember there is a man behind the curtain holding a gun.  Remember I told you.",1103414400,5,1621,4.592334494773519
188469,5,1572521252,"Wow. That's all I have to say, is wow. What an amazing film this is. Clearly, along with Breathless, Pierrot le Fou, and Weekend, this is one of Godard's best movies. To sit and watch this movie, is to realize that movies (especially the ilk Hollywood produces year after year) doesn't stimulate your mind anymore, just entertain you.

Anna Karina, as always, gives a stella performance, and like Lauren Bacall, and French actress, Stephane Audran, Catherine Deneuve, etc., she's totally impassive but has enormous inner excitement. And this is great, cause like a Bresson or Melville film, it forces you to question yourself: what in the hell is they thinking?

Why don't Hollywood raise up and stop thinking we Americans are stupid, and the only thing we're interested in is bland character development and special effects? Why doesn't an immature filmmaker like Quentin Tarantino (who is detached as Godard, but isn't poetically exuberant nor socially/politically educated as Godard) grow up and stop thinking we all want these shallow movies, that carry a comic book sensibility, but no depth? Its as though the rest of the world has grown up, and Hollywood is still limping behind, trying to catch up with the mature European cinema.

Thank God for Wong Kar-Wai (the closet thing we have to Jean-Luc Godard) who, in each film, grabs you, forces you to seat in your seat, and work the answers out, instead of spoon feeding them to you. One will hope that our MTV generation of filmmakers (Paul Thomas Anderson, Quentin Tarantino, Guy Ritchie, etc.) will soon grow up and produce films that will intellectualize your mind, instead of just entertaining you, like pornography.

And yes, this is another film that helped Tarantino create this so-called, blatantly false (hope you're reading this Roger Ebert) Tarantino-esque style that Godard created way before anyone heard of Pulp Fiction.",1099267200,7,1891,5.090322580645161
188470,5,1572521252,This movie is about as hip as a movie can get. The editing and godard's handling of the montage sequencee in which the pimp goes over the legal minutiae of being a french whore with the heroine is worth the viewing of this film alone.,1097193600,3,234,4.222222222222222
188471,5,1572521252,"Although the basic DVD extras (a commentary track, for starters) are missing, the print quality is very good and the movie is absolutely great - first-quality Godard and Karina.",1075852800,4,177,5.137931034482759
188472,5,1572521252,"I believe someone complained about this film being full screen, but I'm pretty sure that's the original aspect ratio. I have to give a hand to Fox Lorber. Although Criterion does the best with older films, at least they have made these great films available on DVD at LOW prices! Where I live there are no decent video stores, so if I want to see something like this I have to buy it.
 Now about the film.......the cinematography is beautiful.........and it doesn't hurt that it's main subject is Anna Karina.....i love it when she does 'itsy bitsy spider' to find out her height, and the editing in the cafe when the gun shots are fired & just about everytime she smiles......this was the first time I laid eyes on her *heart beats* ..now i want to see A Woman is a Woman badly.......the word is Criterion will release it this year.....yippee!!",1075593600,2,845,4.596026490066225
188473,5,1572521252,"This is Godard's most austere film. Its also one of his best.  Anna Karina is in every shot and you never get tired of looking into those sad, beautiful, hopeful eyes. The most heartwrenching part of the story is that no matter how far she descends into the grim world of prostitution she remains somehow innocent and to be truthful the world of prostitution actually doesn't look all that grim(her clients are polite, they always pay, there are no drugs, or beatings). She survives not by becoming detached but by remaining inquisitive and continuing to find things that interest her. She loves the film Passion of Joan of Arc, and she loves the Poe story her boyfriend reads, and she enjoys the company of anyone with fresh ideas or a different perspective.  She might be a prostitute but she never stops being a human being first and she never stops seeing men as individuals and so she never stops liking them, even when they might see her and treat her merely as a type.  Though she can sense the tragedy in someone elses life like Joan of Arcs she does not view herself as being tragic.  She might be a prostitute but she does not seem ashamed of this, but rather just sees it as a job. You could almost say she is amused by her own situation. Its her intense awareness of life and her own freedom to live as she chooses and think and feel what she wants to that make her such a fascinating creature. In fact its the moment after she has her first client that she seems to really become fully aware of herself as a truly free creature. Karina's sense of freedom contrasts in an interesting way with her occupation and the films structure which sets a decidedly deterministic, even fatalistic, tone and pace.  I do agree that the ending seems too easy and abrupt -- many of Godards films end with a kind of suddeness that makes them feel somehow incomplete.  The French title of Breathless is Out of Breath and this seems to be Godards ruling principle -- film until you run out of ideas(out of breath) and then kill off your protaganist(this happens in Breathless, My Life To Live, and Pierrot le Fou). But whether you like the ending or not the rest of the film is so perfect that the film and especialy Karina's face, her attitudes and expressions, linger in your thoughts long after the film is over.  Usually Jean-Luc Godard's style is the star of a Jean-Luc Godard but this is Anna Karina's movie. Cinematographer Coutard as usual does a tremendous job.  I think my favorite Anna Karina film is Jacque Rivette's The Nun (La Religieuse)but this a close second. She is way more interesting than any of the other beauties of the era, and one suspects that she is as creative and original as Godard himself.",1072051200,19,2714,4.5357873210633946
188474,4,1572521252,"This one of my favorite Godard films. The photography is superb and is one of the best character studies I've ever seen put to the big screen. Anna Karina is adorable here - this is may favorite role of her's. No fan of Jean Luc Godard or art films in general should miss this one.
This DVD is a nice product. It has been remastered nicely and the sound is fine. It is represented in fullscreen format (1.33:1) but that may be how the original was shot. Who can say? Not every post-1955 movie was filmed on top-of-the-line 70mm stock, and will thus yield a pristine 2.85:1 ratio.
There aren't an overwhelming assortment of extras on the DVD (okay, there really aren't any at all), but there is optional English subtitling at least. A voice-over commentary track by any number of film historians would have been a nice addition however. The low cost of this DVD will more than compensate. In fact, do not let the lower cost deter you, potential buyer: this DVD yields a pretty clean, beautiful picture (if a tad grainy)!",1064880000,6,1019,4.543478260869565

188476,4,1572521252,"I give this DVD FOUR stars only because the transfer could have been better. With older films, especially foreign ones, the time and cost of providing a great transfer is too much unfortunately.
This an amazing and powerful film that should be owned if you are a fan of Godard or of the French New Wave. For those who have not seen it and are looking for advice, I say: be cautious. This film is not for everyone, especially if you gravitate toward mainstream films. Don't expect Julia Roberts and Richard Gere.
 The French New Wave era brought out a new kind of filmmaking.  The films abandoned and sometimes appropriated traditional methods of narrative and formal esthetics, and used this technique as a critique of sorts.  Vivre sa vie is no exception.  Jean-Luc Godard made a film that requires something more from the viewer than just their attention span.  The fairly simple plot of Vivre sa vie is expanded and turned around by various formal aspects of filmmaking made famous by French New Wave directors.  Jump cuts, long takes, deep focus and slow pans are cornerstones of The French New Wave, but my interest lays with Vivre sa vie functions as a text, rather than a traditional narrative.  By text, I mean that the film has a greater social theme and works more as an essay rather than a filmXsomething needed to be read.
Simply put, Vivre sa vie tells a story of a woman that leaves her husband and son, wants to get into the movies, ends up becoming a prostitute, falls in love, then wants to get out of the business.  But there is so much more to the film and what is needed is your participation.  Participation here, involves much more than a warm body and open eyes.  Godard is using the narrative and formal techniques to tell something more about the social predicament of prostitutes and perhaps women in general.  He accomplishes this by using very untraditional film techniques that enhances this film to a textual level.
When speaking of text, the notion of reading is implied.  The viewer needs to read the scene, rather than just watch.  Reading requires the viewer to make connections and draw conclusions from the juxtaposition of the words and images, and not just be told or shown what is really meaningful.
Watch the 12th chapter (The young man againXthe oval portraitXRaoul sells Nana) when the young man reads the Poe story to Nana.  I think that really captures the essence of the film.
Again, just because people think that this film is great, powerful and groundbreaking, doesn't mean that you will enjoy it.  Be realistic.",1042416000,16,2560,4.721348314606741

7797433,5,1572521252,"This is the film about Nana(Karina),a young girl from the provinces who has been living in Paris for some time. Godard's film is in 12 episodes showing a young woman drifting towards prostitution,showing her most important experiences. The film is free of any sort of moralising,allowing the audience to find its own meaning in what it sees. The film's epigraph by Montaigne,says you have to give yourself to others and not only to yourself. Each episode is given a title.e.g.'A caf. Nana wants to leave Paul. A Pin Table','Afternoons. Money. Washbasins. Pleasure Hotels.'etc.

There are scenes that are shot unconventionally. In the opening scene inside a coffee house,Paul and Nana are talking while seated at the counter,but they are shot from behind so we only see the backs of their heads. They are everyman and woman. Paul is an unsuccessful journalist. Though Nana still loves Paul,she feels a need for change. Nana is shown working in a record shop. She tries to borrow a few thousand francs to pay her rent arrears,but is unsuccessful. Her landlady refuses her entry unless she first pays back the rent. She spends her last few francs going to see Dreyer's Joan of Arc at a movie house. This scene is incredibly moving.

This sets up the Brechtian alienation device:since what the viewer sees is also what the character sees,the viewer identifies itself with this character,because this character guides our look. The character we see in this film has come herself to watch another film. We know there is a difference between illusion and reality. Tears are streaming down Karina's face. The lowly prostitute like the Saint will be sacrificed. Both have been given images by their patriarchal societies and condemned because of it. The viewer has a role in the system of film,prostitution is due to a social system. Godard does not treat film as escapism,he draws on parallels between high art,low culture.

Later a scene plays out at a table in a caf between Nana and her pimp. The camera moves around them catching them in an odd profile two shot,her face is eclipsed by her pimp's head a few times,their faces jutting in from opposite sides of the frame just as he asks her to smile,she says she can't but the shot is held until she breaks and smiles,submitting her innocence to his will. There are scenes where Nana,seen practising as a prostitute, changes from amateur to professional. A montage-sequence in Tableau 8,the voice-over explains the result of a 1959 social expose of prostitution, comments on Nana's situation. But its Nana's gestures and expressions,not body, that are shown. Her boyfriend quotes Poe,she talks to a philosopher,safeguarding her soul while selling her body.

Nana sits in another caf and discusses life,thought,language and existence with an elderly philosopher(Brice Parain playing himself).She complains how hard she finds it to express herself,the meaninglessness of words. He says it's not possible to live without talking. Words should express just what one wants to say. We must think and for thought one needs words. One must speak in a way that obeys being in good faith. This philosopher influenced Camus,greatly. Godard said this film was `existentialist'in outlook,not in opposition to 'essence'.Is our language false at the very moment when we think we are telling the truth?

Freshness,vivacity,piquancy,emotion,dynamism are all qualities of the film. Nana is self-aware and wishes to escape the banality of things,having wanted to get into acting. Karina is an incredible actress,with a Louise Brooks-like face,her eyes like jewels,Godard's muse and wife at the time. Godard improvised wildly,rehearsing a lot before doing one or two takes,his film has the freshness of jazz. His street scenes capture the fizz and energy of 60s Paris,vivid street scenes, trapping emotions of the age through Nana's experiences, filtered through the brilliance of Coutard's cinematography. Unforgettable is the image of the pool table dance of Karina. Pure joy.",1279843200,,4003,5.180834621329212
7797434,5,1572521252,"My Life to Live is a highly stylized and extraordinarily unformulaic adaptation of a simple premise: a young woman, seeking the freedom and excitement of, what Federico Fellini calls La Dolce Vita, leaves her family to pursue an acting career, only to turn to a life of prostitution. From the opening sequence showing a detached, seemingly clinical exhibition of Anna Karina's face and profile, followed by an uneasy dialogue between Nana (Karina) and Paul (Andre-S. Labarthe) filmed at an angle showing the backs of their heads, we are introduced to the singular, iconoclastic vision that is Jean-Luc Godard. Stripped of expression and sentimentality, Godard, nevertheless, succeeds in creating a film that is visually stunning and full of pathos. We are drawn to Anna, not because of her seductive persona or compassionate actions, but because she is humanity, lost and desperate, incapable of comprehending her misery nor articulating her pain (Note the parallel character of Antonio Ricci in Vittorio de Sica's The Bicycle Thief.

Godard's revolutionary camerawork transcends nouvelle vague novelty: it serves as a cinematic extension of Nana's soul. The awkward angles and long panning shots during Nana and Paul's conversations reveals the underlying tension and emotional distance between them. Deeply affected (understandably) by Maria Falconetti's performance in Carl Theodor Dreyer's The Passion of Joan of Arc, Nana's conversation proceeds in silent film intertitles - reflecting her own suffering and innate desire to achieve greatness and escape the banality of her sordid life. The seamless camerawork following Nana as she dances uninhibitedly around the billiard room feels intoxicating, almost mesmerizing - a fleeting glimpse of the few brief moments of pure joy she has ever known. My Life to Live is a truly remarkable film: a synthesis of artistic vision and moral tale, suffused with haunting melody, the ballad of a contemporary tragedy.",1262736000,2,1960,5.468646864686469
7797435,4,1572521252,"Jean-Luc Godard's  Vivre Sa Vie (My Life to Live) is perhaps one of the greatest films ever made. It is surely the epitome of the French New Wave Movement that launched a totally new view of filmmaking to the world.

The film stars Anna Karina as Nana a young and beautiful woman of Paris. She is dissatisfied with her life as a young mother. She leaves her husband/boyfriend(?) Paul to take up the life of an actress. Having no money she resorts to prostitution, first on her own and then with a pimp named Raoul(Sady Rebbot).

The film is presented in twelve parts (Film en douze tableaux)each showing a segment of Nana's life each with its own title card. Each segment beginning or ending on a closeup of Karina's face.

This is truly unique cinema. Godard's framing and film grammar are the stuff of film school classes. The music by Michel Legrand helps set the tone to perfection and the black and white photography by Raoul Coutard is stunning. The camara is not so much a device but a character we are the camara as it is constantly moving and watching. It expresses the way one person views another. The film shows us the outside of characters without ever getting into motivation. Things, like life, just happen.

The disc by Fox Lorber is pretty bare bones but this is one film that needs to be seen by any serious student of film. Seek this one out. It has been said that it may be out of print soon as ideas of what make good film vary from year to year. This is a must have for any collection.",1203120000,2,1507,4.406474820143885
