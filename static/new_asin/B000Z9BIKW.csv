Some of the poses are best done after really warming up the body, which the slow pace doesn't allow to happen. Doing these poses (like the shoulder stand), without being totally warm and loose, could lead to injury. I prefer a more brisk, athletic style of yoga, whereas what is shown here is more focused on slow, deep breathing and very advanced poses (at least for me!).",1270857600,,551,4.465346534653466
8235124,5,B000Z9BIKW,"These Dvds are really complete. They are perfect for yoga beginners because everything is well explained. What I liked a lot about these Dvds is that they are long, not only half an hour like some exercise dvds. They last from 1h30 to 2 hours so you really get to know yoga well. Geri made me discover yoga and I love it!

I recommend these dvds to everyone who wants to do yoga!",1204156800,,379,4.191780821917808
8235125,4,B000Z9BIKW,"I think the dvds are brilliant, and very effective. The second one (GeriBody Yoga) is slitly better then the first one. It's not Geri though, who leads the session, but the yogi (Katy Appleton) is really good. Geri's comments absolutly make the whole exercise so much cooler and funnier, you really can have a feeling of attending a yoga class with Geri itself. The structures of the slides are amazingly welldone, and at the end you really feel recharged, and relaxed. It's a must have dvd if you are into yoga, and a must have dvd if you aren't into yoga...my husband got into it...so it does work on anybody. Namaste!",1202428800,,620,4.594594594594595
