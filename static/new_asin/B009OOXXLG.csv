5360173,5,B009OOXXLG,"1981: Faye Dunaway would portray Joan Crawford in Mommie Dearest""; Ronald Reagan was sworn in as President; Joan Collins became Alexis Carrington on ""Dynasty""; Luke and Laura continued to attract more and more viewers (an estimated 13,000,000 per episode) on ""General Hospital"" (the #1 rated daytime drama) and in January viewers were entranced with ""Guiding Light"" and following the powerful and mesmerizing Jennifer Richard's murder trial. This was somewhat of an amazing feat as ""Guiding Light"" sometimes finished second as the highest rated serial as it was ""General Hospital's"" main competition on CBS, so obviously not everyone was watching the adventures of Luke and Laura. I was Luke and Laura's biggest fan during this time in TV history, but there were days when ""General Hospital"" didn't do it for me in late 1980 so sometimes I'd watch ""Guiding Light"" because I loved Douglas Marland's superb and ingenious writing. He was the one who created the Luke and Laura phenomenon.

 By January, 1981 I, like millions of people, were glued to my TV set and watched the Jennifer Richard's trial for the killing of Lucille Wexler, who was a combination of Joan Crawford/Bette Davis. Jennifer had worked for the wealthy Lucille and when Lucille found out who Jennifer really was decided to kill her. What happened was during the struggle Lucille (surprisingly) got killed. Jennifer would plead guilty and be sentenced to years in prison. However, her attorney, Mike Bauer, knew Jennifer was innocent and was hiding something, so a new trial began.

 This amazing 2 DVD 10 continuous episode set contains the story of that second trial. Hair-raising (most critics agree that this is the second most harrowing murder trial in the history of U.S. soap opera coming in second only to the powerful Karen Wolek testimony from Viki's trial on ""One Life to Live"" in 1979), extremely well-written (Doug Marland, Harding Lemay and others won the Emmy that year for Outsanding Writing in a Daytime Drama) and features some of the best acting to ever grace a daytime serial (Gearldine Court, who played Jennifer, was nominated as Best Actress but lost to Judith Light who garnered her second Emmy as Karen on ""One Life"").

 Soap Claasics has done an amazing job cleaning the episodes and producing the shows uncut for people to enjoy for posterity. What many remember too is that half way through the original CBS telecast of these episodes the network pre-empted ""Guiding Light"" for news coverage of the Iranian Hostage Crisis. CBS' switchboard lit up like a Christmas tree as viewers demanded to see their story and watch how the trial played out. So now for the first time we will see the whole trial in its entirety and I for one am ecstatic!",1350000000,9,2735,4.960698689956332
8543415,5,B009OOXXLG,I loved it so I gave it 5 stars. Amazon however rates 1 star because of their horrible treatment of their employees.,1440028800,,116,4.318181818181818
8543416,5,B009OOXXLG,"If you are a long time Guiding Light fan like me, you will love this dvd set.  This was a good story line having to do with the true identity of Jennifer Richards and who her grown daughter is and who is the daughter's father!  Now do you remember?  She was on trial for Lucille Wexler's murder and her own lawyer Mike Bauer (with whom she had been romantically involved) finally made her tell the truth!  But what was that truth?  At the most dramatic moment of the trial, CBS pre-empted the show with a news report.  So what happened?  Buy the set and re-live the whole trial!  Great memories.  I am so glad some of these episodes are available.  I hope there will be more released in the future.",1413244800,,698,4.3
8543417,5,B009OOXXLG,I started watching Guiding Light with my Grandmother in 1967.  I watched it through thee good and the bad years.  It is good to see some of these great episodes being released.  I was so sad to here that Soapclassics will no longer release any GL or ATWT. Come on CBS!  You canceled a great soap to put on a dreadful has-been game show--Let's Make A deal!  The least you could do is to let some company come in and release old episodes!  I enjoyed seeing this DVD--and to see Kevin Bacon as a teen was a hoot!  Come on CBS----LET US HAVE OUR GL!!!!,1367280000,2,548,4.161904761904762
8543418,5,B009OOXXLG,"Keep making these! I love them!

I would like to see more Guiding Light collections. I heard that there was a Christmas Collection out there that Soap Classics had not released due to some legal reasons. SO SAD! I want this collection also! :)

Give us more GL!!!",1358294400,2,263,4.458333333333333

8543420,5,B009OOXXLG,I was a big Guiding Light fan in the early 80's.  watching these episodes brought back memories. some of the actors have passed away since.,1356652800,,139,4.56
8543421,5,B009OOXXLG,I received my order this weekend. I have finished watching all 10 episodes. It brought back such memories. I have been waiting over 31 yrs to watch the complete preempted episode! These eps were part of GL's heyday! What brilliant writing and so many storylines going on at one time. Memorable and beloved characters!,1353801600,3,317,4.888888888888889
8543422,5,B009OOXXLG,"This is a wonderful set of dvd's featuring a two week run of episodes of Jennifer Richards' trial for murder. Done very well,this is what soap opera is all about. Love affairs gone wrong,blackmail,illegitimate babies,small towns where everybody knows everybody else. Stories featuring doctors,nurses,good people,bad people,this is the way it is done. Still holds up well and this was 1981. Writing was the key,Douglas Marland and Harding LeMay were tops ! This is what makes me enjoy Guiding Light.",1351641600,2,498,5.3164556962025316
8543423,5,B009OOXXLG,"I started watching Guiding Light in 1975. I loved the realistic storylines.  Thanks to Douglas Marland who was lured away from the top rates General Hospital / Guiding Light continued to be must see TV!

The introduction of Jennifer Richards was ingenious!  The family was traveling through Springfield and collided with Mike Bauer!

Jennifer had a dark history involving the Spauldings and Lucille Wexler was determined that Jane Marie Stafford would never live to tell it!

Lucille confronted Jennifer about her true identity and lunged at Jennifer with a letter opener.  Lucille was killed in the struggle and Jennifer's world would collapse around her!

Geraldine Court who portrayed Jennifer Richards was riveting.  She so deserved not only an Emmy for that performance, but every award ever created for an Outstanding Performance!

Guiding Light was unstoppable and was a ratings powerhouse. Great writing, great acting and amazing stories. This brilliant DVD showcases what fantastic drama is all about!

Enjoy!",1350864000,2,1018,5.386075949367089
8543424,4,B009OOXXLG,"Before I praise and then rant, I want to be clear - I LOVE SOAPS, they are my favorite genre of tv show, and I would watch them endlessly if they were available on dvd in a way that makes them a soap opera.  I might have been the most excited person on the planet when SOAP CLASSICS came about (though other soap fans would probably disagree because we are all passionate)and anything is slightly better than nothing at all....well, somedays, but not lately.  I also give SOAP CLASSICS a big thank you for their willingness to try Soaps on dvd-even though my rants do not sound thankful- but I am frustrated more often than not because I want them to be successful more than they want to be successful, and my frustration is my fear that they will not be successful because of the way they are releasing our favorite shows, from the greatest ever TV GENRE created. They are NOT TV SHOWS, THEY ARE SOAP OPERAS-or STORIES as Grandma used to call them. I will save the rest for the rant after the praise...

PROS:
Consecutive episodes  - excellent!
Consecutive episodes about a specific storyline, not just random - excellent
A time period that most fans have not seen - or certainly not in decades - excellent!
HOPEFULNESS - bringing fans back on board - EXCELLENT!

This release gives fans hope that SC may listen to feedback afterall, or care about the soap genre, or unerstand the soap genre, or have respect for why fans love soaps - not just A SOAP OPERA,  but soaps in general. This one release gives that much hope and will gain SC so much good will and respect from SOAP fans because you have released soaps in a way similar to how they were meant to be watched, and the way fans want to watch them and the way FANS ARE WILLING TO SPEND HARD EARNED MONEY in order to get the releases on dvd.  Hope means checking for new releases, getting great joy from seeing the next one on a list, and then BUYING THEM - rather than having every release feel like another balloon was deflated, causing fans not to seek news about future releases any longer.

4 star WELL DONE to SC!!!!

CONS:
10 episodes  - a lesson they still have not learned I guess.  Popular tv shows which don't usually have ""continuing stories"" that are so connected that you need them all - have 20 episodes in a season.  Only a new tv show is limited to 10-13 episodes, because nobody has seen it, it has no fans, and nobody knows if anyone willl like it or if a network will air more than the first 3 episodes anyway. So we're going to equate long running, popular soap operas with million of fans, old and young, some of us who want to watch more soaps but there aren't enough left on tv, don't need to be fans of THE SHOW, just THE GENRE in order to buy them - these are comparable? This logic screams that the person/company who purchased the right to the soaps at SOAP CLASSICS has put people in charge of releases that don't understand the genre at all. It is heartbreaking because all the hope I have seeing a ""storyline"" released is slightly minimized by the ""UGH here we go again"", I think they ""get it"" now but 10 episodes makes me a little leary of getting my hopes up for future releases of STORIES. 20 may not cover the whole sotrylione and the side stories but at least I wouldn't feel like they chose a formula of 10 episodes and they are not willing to modify in any way no matter what - they will release the stories that can be crammed into 10 episodes whether they are good ones or not  - or they will convince themselves that they can do without episodes, just to be able to get to the magic number 10.  We'll have to wait and see if there are anymore story releases or if this was just a one time thing and we'll get another weddings set or babies set or 30 years of so-and-so wrapped up into 10 episodes where he/she has 14 scenes. I guess time will also tell if they will release based on good, content rich, character driven stories, even if it dares to require 12 or more episodes to make it barely complete. From past releases I wouldn't make a bet -

but then again, THEY ARE RELEASING A STORYLINE SET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HOORAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

For most storylines to be complete in 10 episodes or 15, You would probably have to have a 2 hour segment saying ""previously on GL"" to cover the bases on what story you are about to tell.  At the end, there will be all the other stories and characters that were present in the 10 episodes but not part of the trial story whose stories will now float around in our heads causing us to constantly think ""I wonder if..."" ""who is she related to?"" ""how did they get together"" plus 500 more questions that will never be answered at this rate. That would be a bummer - but it is worth the risk because ITS A STORYLINE RELEASE FOR GOODNESS SAKES,  One small step for Soap Classics, One Giant LEap for Soap Fans!!!!!!

Pricing - I don't mind paying $20 for a storyline-its 10,000 times better than what we've had so far -but being in a bad economy with less money than we used to have and massive inflation causing food and energy bills and gas and everything else costing more while most people make less money, I can't justify one disappointing release after another. I admit, being a hardcore soap fan, the nostalgia sets were a great boost of cheer at first until I realized that's all we would get, over and over again and they seemed thin on content and had so few episodes for characters on a show for 20-30 years, I stopped buying the releases for me-bought a few for my mom but it was too expensive to be so disappointed at the end, because they were so incomplete. I never thought there would be soaps on dvd that I would not purchase immediately, eveytime a set was announced, no matter the show - but so few episodes should have been a nostalgia set for characters on a show for 5 years or less. Not to mention, when combining them all, they were very heavy on more recent years-not very nostalgic, episodes I've seen before and new enough that I remembered them clearly.

When so many soap fans get excited like all their dreams will finally come true - SOAPS ON DVD - and then what I hoped was putting toes into the water with nostalgia sets would turn into sets for SOAP FANS, not SETS TO MAKE MONEY FAST WITHOUT TAKING THE STEP OF RESPECTING THAT SOAPS ARE STORIES TOLD OVER TIME WITH CHARACTERS WHO TURN INTO FAMILY MEMBERS - and it turns out to be.....nostalgia sets, endlessly, without enough content to give you that feeling of ""OH I MISS THEM"" or ""OH I LOVE THEM!"" or ""I CAN'T WAIT UNTI..."" it becomes more of a let down that I thought it could be. At least before, I just knew there was no hope of soaps on dvd so I didn't get a big HOPE high and a letdown and then another release and a letdown...I couldn't spend the money anymore.

BUT - if a set was chock full of episodes and storylines from years gone by, 80's and earlier,maybe some 90's if I didn't watch that soap before,  consecutive episodes covering a long period of time with a ""clips"" episode at the beginning that sums up how we got where we are, and a ""spoiler alert"" clips episode at the end with 3-4 scenes about every storyline covered, summing up where they eventually go with it-you could choose to watch it or wait and hope for more releases, I would easily spend a good chunk of cash in order to have a show to watch every night for a month or 2.  EVEN MORE IMPORTANT - I would be saving every penny so I could buy the next one the moment it was released, instead, I stopped een checking for releases, and wouldn't spend 20 bucks-big difference in my humble opinion.  I'll spend more money for the quality and content but won't spend a little money for something that doesn't give me the big soap opera joy of stories and characters and family and all the things a long story arch brings.

Another clue that makes me nervous about the magic number 10 and the ability to tell a complete story in 10 episodes...wWen the intro press info on TVSHOWSONDVD.com has more information about the events leading up to the trial and why there is a trial and who is involved etc, than it has about the actual episodes on the set, its obvious to me that there will be much much more we don't get to enjoy than we what DO get to enjoy.

One last note about the nostalgia sets - I am not apposed to those releases - in addition to actual storylines, real soap opera releases, they would be a great addition to a soap collection.  The tough part is when they are the ONLY releases, because we don't get 90% of the joys of soap operas from them.  Pictures of your family vacation are fabulous to have and remember and look at year after year but if you never went on the vacation itself, its like photo shopping yourself into a photo of all the kids at Disney World for the first time-if you weren't there when their eyes got big like saucers when HUGE Mickey Mouse walked up or when they walked into the Castle or when they grabbed your hand on pirates of the caribbean or when they sang ""its a small world"" for 3 hours straight after the ride, its just not the same when you look at the scrapbook every year - they are just pictures that are cute but make you wish you had been there to see it all and experience it all and know first hand if they loved it more than anything so far in their lives or if it was just another trip with smiling photos but they didn't ""flip"" over Disney after all.

The one major exception to this is Christmas sets.  Christmas and New Years Eve were major events on soaps in the past and the few soaps I have saved on VHS and DVD from the last 15-20 years, I have marked the Christmas episodes and in most cases have transferred them all to dvd's that are entirely Christmas episode from any soap I have been able to get with a Christmas episode or group of episodes.  It puts me in the Christmas spirit every year, without fail, no matter how many times I have seen them - I watch them every year right along with Rudolph and Frosty, as do my mom and sister and other people I know.  There is no end to the number of Christmas/New Years sets I would buy as long as the episodes don't repeat. Any Soap Opera, Any Number of Episodes, it never gets old even if I have no clue about the storylines going on at the time.

SO.... SOAP CLASSICS - THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR THE FIRST STORYLINE RELEASE, YOU HAVE WON ME BACK, I CANNOT WAIT TO WATCH IT ALL, EVERY SINGLE MOMENT! PLEASE PLEASE MAKE MORE OF THEM PRONTO....PLEASE USE AS MANY EPISODES AS NECESSARY TO TELL A QUALITY STORY-NO MAGIC NUMBER....PLEASE MAKE BIGGER SETS, EVEN IF ITS ONE BIGGER SET A YEaR AND THE REST ARE IN THE 10 EPISODE RANGE....PLEASE HUNT IN THE VAULTS AND FIND MORE HOLIDAY EPISODES AND GIVE US FANS A CHRISTMAS GIFT, THE GREAT SOAP EPISODES WHERE EVERYONE COMES TOGETHER DURING THE MOST WONERFUL TIME OF THE YEAR....IF AT ALL POSSIBLE, BRANCH OUT TO OTHER SOAPS OPERAS IT WOULD BE REALLY FREAKING AMAZING IF WE HAD LOTS OF SOAPS TO BUY, ESPECIALLY THE REALLY OLD ONES WE HAVEN'T SEEN, EVEN IF THAT MEANS YOU HAVE TO START WITH NOSTALGIA SETS FOR SHOWS LIKE SEARCH FOR TOMORROW OR EDGE OF NIGHT ( I've seen very little of the older ones, almost none and would love to get hooked on them-from what i've seen, they are as awesome as the soaps that were cancelled more recently.",1350345600,4,11300,4.325141776937619
