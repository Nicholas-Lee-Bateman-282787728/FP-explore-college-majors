7307081,5,B010CG2EJ6,"The story that Mark Netter brings to life in this virtual point of view nightmare is clever, elevated, and thrilling. Honestly the tech theories and philosophical theoretical surrounding this degree of artificial intelligence is so over my head that natural a story such as ""Nightmare Code"" is going to both fascinate and terrify me. I can't honestly praise or debunk the actual material used in the film concerning the code writing, or programmers because that is tech geek stuff, and I still call anime ""cartoons"". See what I am saying. But I can say that the creative, and brilliant way that Netter tells this story, one does not have to be a tech geek to really get into the movie. It pulls you in, you wanna watch, you feel the horror coming, and you wanna see it happen.

""Nightmare Code"" isn't all sterile, emotionless A.I gimmick stuff either, the characters are as developed, and personable as any third person psycho-thriller, or traditional tech horror-""Brainscan"" and ""Lawnmower"" man come to mind.  Anyway, everything about this film is captivating, intense, and thrilling. Things you don't always get from found footage concepts- all though it isn't really fair to just call this found footage. It is something more. And it all really does come from the POV of A.I , all that data and application stuff that lives inside our devices staring back at us, and in this case-learning and adapting and coming to get us!

The special effects in ""Nightmare Code"" may be the first time I was thrilled, chilled, and entertained by CGI effects. The scenes are blunt, visceral, and affecting. You feel like you watched these deaths really happen, and the blood splatter was awesome. Not a lot of gore, but then I don't think-well I hope-that A.I will never get that into the gory side of killing and death to wanna really revel in it! Fingers crossed and the gods appeased! Overall ""Nightmare Code"" is a definite watch horror film for all, even the ones who normally flee from found footage concepts should check ""Nightmare Code"" out. The ending does fall a bit short with the thrilling, horror nature that from the beginning of the film is a steady, haunting build up to the nightmarish climax. It ins't really that much but it is the one noticeable flaw in an excellent flick. And that last sequence before credits is kind of cliche and hokey but unless you end the film a scene earlier it is really the only closing that ties up the plot.",1442534400,4,2442,4.741176470588235
7307082,5,B010CG2EJ6,If you appreciate great horror movies this is an absolutely exciting new entry. TERRIFIC!!!!,1442016000,2,92,5.642857142857143
7307083,5,B010CG2EJ6,"There were several elements about Nightmare Code that took me by surprise.  To be honest, I was never a big fan of scary movies, or films of this genre, but my opinion has changed!  Nightmare Code's ""found footage"" effect (the split screen, the feeling of being a voyeur to the unfolding story) was totally riveting.  To say that I was on the edge of my seat is no understatement.  The film moves at a strong pace, it has twists, turns and suspense.  There were light and funny moments, as well.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  I'd watch it again.  Highly recommend!",1441843200,2,569,4.564356435643564
7307084,5,B010CG2EJ6,"I saw Nightmare Code when it was at the Philip K Dick Film Festival in NYC.  It's fantastic.  Very clever, thought-provoking, and the acting was great.  The lead actor was Gareth in The Walking Dead, one of my faves.  You should check it out.",1441843200,,242,4.431818181818182
7307085,5,B010CG2EJ6,"NIGHTMARE CODE is a terrific example of low-budget film making at its best.  Its a thriller that really thrills, with tension from the first moments to the last.  Very fine performances, writing, and camera work.",1441843200,4,212,5.0285714285714285
7307086,1,B010CG2EJ6,Ridiculous movie!,1482019200,,17,8.0
7307087,5,B010CG2EJ6,I thoroughly enjoyed this entertaining storyline. The subject matter and the technical aspect was unique. The thought of being able analyse peoples hidden emotions within their mind and to be able to display it on a screen is quite terrifying even though it is inevitable in the near future. Nora at the ending getting stalked was irritating. I've not been chased around threatened with death but I sure hope I would not sneak around stupidly and breath so loud that the killer can hear several rooms away.,1479859200,,506,4.827586206896552
7307088,5,B010CG2EJ6,"Very much like Ex Machina without the sexy cyborg. This is a slow moving film that is ultimately quite taut. Another film that this brings to mind is Gattaca.  I can't think of anything more to say,since the other 5 star reviewers have it nailed. As to those who have trouble with 4 screen POV in the film technique ,this has been a literary device for over a century. The narrative is a variant of ""third person omniscient"" .  That is the scary part of the story...the combination of surveillance state cameras, AI, with a deep nod to HAL and Frankenstein's ""monster"".  Nice references to WikiLeaks too.",1477612800,2,604,4.626168224299065

7307091,2,B010CG2EJ6,"Many elements that could have made for an interesting film are present in this one.  Feels like someone, a writer or whoever, just ran out of imagination.  This is the first negative review I've ever written and so this is one of the negative side-effects afflicting me from having watched this film.  Bottom  line : I do not recommend this film to anyone.  Not even to me.",1473033600,2,373,4.507462686567164

7307095,4,B010CG2EJ6,"Well executed sci-fi film. I thought the sets and acting were fantastic, the story held my attention and I loved the split screen filming technique. Kept the tension up. The visual effects were good too. A spooky story line that we hope isn't in the very near future!",1470873600,,267,4.583333333333333
7307106,4,B010CG2EJ6,"I just saw this at the GenCon Filmfest. I really liked it. For a low budget movie it is well written, acted and has really good production values. If you're a fan of indie scifi don't pass this one up.",1470614400,,201,4.05
7307107,4,B010CG2EJ6,Great indie sci-fi computer take over film. It's a cross between found footage and not.  Actual in your face acting!,1470528000,,116,4.8

7307109,4,B010CG2EJ6,Liked the concept of a psychological Sci-Fi and the ending was cool!!,1470182400,,69,4.833333333333333
7307110,3,B010CG2EJ6,Nightmare Code was surprisingly innovative for an independent film. They tried some really interesting things and the sci-fi genre is always an interesting one. The ensemble cast was nice. Definitely worth a watch.,1470096000,,214,5.515151515151516
7307111,1,B010CG2EJ6,"If there was an original idea in NIGHTMARE CODE I'd like somebody to point it out to me. Cliches, on the other hand... Why don't we go down the list. Found footage style. Check. Sentient computer code. Check. 5 people trapped in a small space being menaced. Check. Split screens. Check. Slow pacing. Check. Minutes and minutes of talking heads and dialogue that do nothing to advance the story. Check. Subplots that come from nowhere and go nowhere. Check. Bad, Bad acting. Check.

This movie has a plot that you can describe in less time than it took me to type that. It looks like the 5 actors pooled the change they had in their pockets and said ""Hey! Let's make a movie!"" The director (yes, I was surprised there was a director too) hangs with his ""found footage"" style ignoring that it drains any possible suspense right out of the film. Unless wondering if something is going to finally happen qualifies as suspense. Neither he nor the actors realize that when you Skype you LOOK AT THE SCREEN, not down at the screen- straight at the screen! At one point the lights come back on and an actress FALLS DOWN! I've had the lights off a few times. Never got knocked down when they came back on. It would have been funny if it wasn't so boring.

Really, a mistake all the way around. AI and the singularity can make for some fascinating movies. Or you can take the security footage of a bunch of people running from room to room, tack on some bad LAWNMOWER MAN graphics and ideas and viola!

Seriously. More thought went into the end titles than the whole movie. And that was the most amazing thing about the whole film. Can you believe it too so many people to make this? I've made better films with my kids.",1470009600,,1710,4.439490445859873

7307113,1,B010CG2EJ6,Very difficult to watch a movie with 4 different views/squares on the screen.,1469232000,,77,5.0
7307114,4,B010CG2EJ6,"I found this movie difficult to watch, at first because of the cinematic technique of dividing the screen into quarters, doing shots of the same moment from different perspectives, and also moments out of sequence, and static or pixellation.  Before long I got the hang of watching that, though is was always unsettling.  It definitely fit the story content, in a fresh and uncompromising way.  The characters were interesting and decently developed, which is to say I cared what happened.  The exposition of the story was admirably well-done and professional.  There were a lot of very salient social and technological topics incorporated: the development of facial recognition into sophisticated analysis of emotions, the evolution of a universal surveillance state, the ethics and price of whistleblowing, the Kurzweilian notion of immortality by upload, the question of what true AI gone bad could do to humanity- lots of substantial ideas.  At the same time, the film required some serious suspension of disbelief.  Also, to me it was a pity the platform for those ideas was something of a slasher movie.  All in all, though, it was great to watch a captivating movie that was full of ideas and executed with boldness, far from the bogs of Hollywood.",1468281600,2,1255,5.087804878048781

7307118,4,B010CG2EJ6,"Wow, I am totally NOT a fan of sci-fi with a horror twist. So much so I have absolutely REFUSED to watch 'the walking dead' or anything of THAT genre. So after 20 minutes I switched this film off, wondered why it got a ""Philip K. Dick"" award and mentally prepared my review which would have read (in it's entirety) THE CLOSED CAPTIONS ARE OUT OF SYNC WITH THE AUDIO <(just like that). Anyways out of curiosity or 'whatever' I went back to it and i'm glad I did. It was good, Could even see this as a 'cult' kind of flick.
I DO now see that it is worthy of that award and after watching I wonder if the 'audio out of sync' is a 'bug'...or maybe a 'feature'??????",1466380800,,661,4.092307692307692

7307125,1,B010CG2EJ6,"I definitely do not recommend this movie.  The story-line felt unfinished and rushed. The acting was pretty unbelievable (as in bad) and I'm not sure if it was the actors themselves or moreso just poor scripting.  While I can enjoy a good found-footage style movie, the constant swapping of camera angles throughout didn't seem to add anything to my experience.  I watch a lot of movies and even movies that some might typically say are 'bad' are usually movies I can still get some level of entertainment value.

7307129,2,B010CG2EJ6,"It's pretty hard to believe that people are rating this movie more than three stars.  I mean, movies that have won Oscars might deserve a 5 star rating.  This amateurish, voyeuristic look at software gone wrong was at best two stars.

7307143,1,B010CG2EJ6,"Not good.  Quite a bit of the movie shows four screens at the same time (like security cameras) which after a time is no longer an interesting way of telling the story but an annoying one.  The need to ""get the code done"" at all costs is a plot contrivance that just doesn't work.

I just thought this was an excellent film. As a low budget indie you couldn't ask for anything more. If there was a few million behind it, and some stars in the main roles, this film could be a blockbuster.

I loved the use of the different camera angles.

The whole cast were superb. Specially Andy and Mei.

It definitely kept you gripped to the screen!

The special features on the DVD were a great addition; well worth the additional wait on the release.

The audio commentary was both funny and very informative. I like finding out how the behind the scenes stuff works!

7307161,5,B010CG2EJ6,This is really a great story a movie that really makes you think about this whole interesting and wild idea about AI and has good twists and turns first off I love Andrew J West he is a great actor of our time and does an amazing job with anything he takes on. I also really loved the filming perspective of the movie how it showed several perspectives like a camera or the AI saw everything. Truly a great film I highly recommend watching it the cast was fantastic and again just love the performance of Andrew J West he's phenomenal. Watch Nightmare code I think true fan's of Sci-fi and how it does relate to what really does go on and how it compares to real life are going to love this film!,1449705600,3,696,4.201492537313433
7307162,3,B010CG2EJ6,"I give all the credit in the world to Nightmare Code for the creative side it takes. The movie is basically all surveillance and computer screen shots, which weve seen done as of late, but here it at least fits more of a purpose and goes along well with the story. Im not sure I saw a character that I really wanted to get behind (the biggest thing going against this one), but I at least wanted to see just what would happen next and where this thing was going. One minute you have people wrestling around and the next you have someone running through the office shooting people at point-blank range.  That is when the movie is at its most tense. Toss in some nudity and you have a bit of a random mix for Nightmare Code, but at least boring is one thing you cant call this one and that is always a great thing in my book.

Now I don't know if something like this will be for everyone (then again what is?). It takes a bit to really get going, but I think once this one finds the groove it at least never takes a step back, but that groove does take a little bit of time. So, setting the table here for the plot could be a bit tiresome. I do think the script is a smart one and brains in an indie horror film is something we just never see enough of these days. The actors are more than solid, they are good actors, but as I said above, I think the biggest issue with this one is that you still just never find it in you to care about these people, even when bad things are going down on-screen to them. Still, Id say it is worth a watch and if you are always looking new and different indie films to check out, you could a whole heck of a lot worse than this one. It at least brings a little bit of creativity to the table and that makes it watch worthy in my book.",1449705600,2,1767,4.002832861189802
7307163,5,B010CG2EJ6,"From my IMDB Review:

The first complete work by director Mark Netter and co-writer and
co-executive producer M J Rotondi is a ""Drop the Keyboard, I'm out""
success. Normally one would expect a smaller budget film to skimp on
detail, and substitute blood spatter for material, however this
absolutely was not the case with Nightmare_Code. The stunning attention
to even the smallest detail made this film as good as anything you'd
see out of big Hollywood, and the best part (wait for it!): It's a
terrific, multifaceted story! Let me begin by writing I would not
classify this as horror. It is much more of a thriller / suspense
movie. It has a few horror elements to it, but it certainly is not
blood and gore by any stretch of the imagination or anything akin to a
""slasher"" type movie. If you love thrillers and suspense this movie is
for you. If you are looking for Jason XXXIV: Jason kills the Matrix
you're probably off base.

A prima facie look at the movie will tell you that it centers around
ROPER, a computer AI that runs amok. What is one of the many wonders of
this movie is that the story really is the human one, and not the story
of ROPER. ROPER more acts as a gravitational point which the other
characters revolve around.

For much of the movie, we are viewing the world through the eyes of the
artificial intelligence, ROPER, and the screen is split into 4 distinct
quadrants, like looking at surveillance cam footage. The sound team
deftly moves the sound appropriately to each area of the screen by
moving the sound through the 5.1 or Stereo fields so you aren't left
fighting to figure out which ""screen"" to watch. Just relax and let the
sound guide you and you'll follow along just fine.

Foster Cotton, played by Steve Wozniak type Googy Gress, and his team
are working on an artificial intelligence surveillance system that
reads emotions and state of mind by tracking facial movements, body
positions etc and then tries (with gaining accuracy) to predict the
target subject's next behavior. Unfortunately, Googy for reasons later
revealed comes unhinged and massacres his fellow co-workers. The
sequence/footage of the killings, when revealed, is downright
disturbing due to the artful way the entire movie is put together. You
feel like you are witnessing a workplace shooting first hand and there
is nothing you can do but watch.

When the carnage is over, it is left to the reboot team to finish the
project. Enter Brett Desmond played by Andrew J West of Walking Dead
infamy, and Nora Hunstman played by Mei Melanon and the rest of the
crew. The underpants gnomes are off to work! (South Park reference).
Working tirelessly, with Desmond both working and sleeping on site, the
group tries to close out bugs and finish the project but for some
reason, they can't seem to just get it over the hump and ready to ship.

Working in the technology world myself, I was stunned how close to
reality this was in many ways. Of course film makers take liberties,
however the idea of working all the time, facing drop dead dates, and
doing the impossible as an everyday course of life nearly sent me into
post traumatic stress from my days sitting and working with a team much
like the group Netter and Rotondi have put together.

The little details, like the Unix shells on the screens, the obsolete
books on the table, and the constant jumpiness of the characters
themselves can be found in any tech company still today.

Stress points and boil overs, with a constantly menacing AI stirring
the pot lead the characters down some pretty dark holes. When the
characters do make mistakes, even ones they shouldn't, you feel sorry
for them. You ""understand"" why they do the things they do, even if you
know they are wrong. This is the very human piece of the story. You are
meant to have little sympathy when the AI goes wrong. Humanity, is a
purely human trait, and left for humans.

I will close out by writing: Nightmare_Code is a must see if you
enjoyed movies like 2001: A Space Odyssey. ROPER is not as overwhelming
as HAL but quite frankly, that makes it more nefarious. The question
was posed to me, is the writer in the code or is the code in the
writer, and I think this movie sort of answers that question in it's
own interpretation. I personally thought this was a great movie and
have already seen it twice. I will certainly see it a third time.",1449619200,9,4374,4.619047619047619
7307164,4,B010CG2EJ6,"""Nightmare Code"" wants to be a Kubrickian found footage film. Telling the tale of an increasingly sentient computer system via security footage and Skype calls, the audience soon fears ROTOR. But, do we need to feel the computer system ROTOR or the developer? I can see folks in the tech development industry really getting into the matter. However, it handles the material in such a droll and direct matter.

While that adds to the overall aesthetic of the film, it might make it hard for casual viewers to stick with the film. The DVD comes with no special features. The A/V Quality is pretty standard for a non HD presentation. The Dolby track is supportive, but it doesn't really overpower the mix. In the end, I'd recommend a purchase.",1447632000,3,740,4.736434108527132
7307165,5,B010CG2EJ6,"I came in to watching Nightmare Code with a chip on my shoulder: I'm not normally a fan of horror-style films. However, but the clever found footage approach and swiftly moving narrative grabbed me from the opening scene.  Clearly the actors and producers had a ball making this film and, with a slight wink, the audience is asked to join in the fun.  It's never about the horror for horror's sake. The fact that a recent article in the New York described how actual emotion-gauging software is the real source of discomfort.  That's all, my computer is telling me I have to go.",1443312000,6,578,4.592233009708738

8721854,4,B010CG2EJ6,"The movie takes a very interesting idea, and then squanders it.  The problem is it goes way too far into a ""Lawnmower Man"" - ""Ghost killing through internet"" sort of direction, when the basic setup before that is far more terrifying/fascinating:

At this rate, we will eventually create a program that can analyze people's speech, gestures, and facial movements so well, that it can simply tell you what everyone is thinking.  What happens, when humans lose the ability to lie?  When everyone knows EXACTLY how you feel about them, at all times?  What sort of damage will that have on the human psyche, and civilization itself?  Now, that's an interesting concept.  A ghost inhabiting computer code, is not.",1496448000,2,707,4.940677966101695
8721855,4,B010CG2EJ6,"The emotional facial recognition drew me into the film. This could be a problem if it were to become real. Job interviews would be biased. Even a relationship would be phony via a digital device with facial recognition. I gave the movie 4 stars for that. I didn't have a problem with the split screen and shots to the body parts looked real.
