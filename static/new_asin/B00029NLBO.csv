2072159,5,B00029NLBO,"My two year old son loves to watch this video. He enjoys all of the songs and watches the entire thing.  I have other Barney videos that he loses interest in.  For as many times as I have watched this video it does not feel like it is dragged out, even though they start at 1 and end at 10. I highly recommend this video.",1100908800,13,321,3.923076923076923
2072160,1,B00029NLBO,"We ran out to get this DVD the day it came out!  When we got home and put this in for my son, we were horrified to learn that we paid money for a TV episode that we have taped many times over on PBS Kids.  It is a nice episode but you can get it for free on TV.  There should be a warning on the box that this is from TV show and SEEN BEFORE!",1090972800,6,342,3.4155844155844157
2072161,5,B00029NLBO,This book was okay to read and entertaining if you have an imagination and vision what is happening. highly recommend.,1359504000,,118,4.95
2072162,5,B00029NLBO,"My son liked the dancing, the translation is good. So my son will learn the first 9
He could be watching this for 1 hour.",1322179200,,121,3.88
2072163,4,B00029NLBO,This is perfect for children learning to count and recognize numbers. My two year old son immediately learned to count to twenty after watching this dvd. Movie utilizes fun songs and games to count,1318464000,,197,4.823529411764706
2072164,5,B00029NLBO,"Both my 20 month old daughter and I have memorized this entire video in English.  She loves it.  Now that we are on our Umpteenth viewing, it makes my skin crawl and overall nervous system shudder similar to when fingernails are scraped across a chalkboard. Thank goodness it has a Spanish dubbed version.  It is just not as bad when its in Spanish. At least I feel like I'm learning something too, and can help repeat the words.  I had basic Spanish 101 in college but probably couldn't speak it to save my life, but at least I can pick out words from their grammatical endings and the context and repeat them for her at other times.  She really does love it. She can count to 10 in English already, so I am hoping we will get there in Spanish. We only watch it on the DVD player in the car (no TV in the house).",1309996800,,813,4.185897435897436
2072165,4,B00029NLBO,"After watching this with my 19-month old daughter for the first time I noticed that this DVD seemed much shorter than some of the other Barney DVD's we have, and there didn't seem to be as many fun songs in it as there are in others.  This can be considered a good thing when the whole point of watching the DVD is to keep the focus of a small child with a very short attention span.  My daughter seemed to enjoy it, even though she doesn't grasp the concept of numbers yet she still enjoys listening to/watching the songs.

The only reason I say it's 'not our favorite' is because she seems to prefer some of the other DVD's that have more songs that she is familiar with like 'ABC's' and Old McDonald Had A Farm, ect.",1253577600,,719,4.233576642335766
2072166,1,B00029NLBO,"You have to know to change this DVD to play in Spanish.  This occurs at the beginning of the DVD so you may miss it, like I did, if you are not paying attention.",1247875200,,161,3.735294117647059
2072167,3,B00029NLBO,"I was under the impression there were native Spanish speakers here, but the kids speak English and it's dubbed Spanish you hear (native Spanish, yes), but the mouths don't match. That's how nearly all DVD's are, but I thought I read this one was just in Spanish, with mouths that match the words. It isn't.
Still, it's a cute tape that helps teach numbers, and it's all in Spanish.
It's not too long, which is nice because I don't want my kids to watch too much TV.",1246320000,,465,4.35632183908046
2072168,5,B00029NLBO,This is a great dvd for little ones just starting out to learn....Barney gets their attention and they quickly pick up on the concept of music and numbers together.,1238630400,,164,4.689655172413793
2072169,5,B00029NLBO,My son is a big fan of barney. We have a lot of Barney's DVDs. But this is the one that I think the best. He would follow the whole movie from start to end.,1225584000,,156,3.4857142857142858

2072174,1,B00029NLBO,"The Dvd that amazon sent me only worked one time and then it broke. I left the country the day after I receieved it and did not have time to send it back. I called and tried to get through to a customer service rep once, but I was put on hold for 10 minutes. I eventually hung up and I am now stuck with a broken dvd. What a waste of money.",1168300800,,340,3.671232876712329
2072175,5,B00029NLBO,Excellent Barney DVD. My daughter shocked me one day when she already knew how to count all the way to 10!! She's not even 2 yet. I was teaching her 1-5 and she already knew 1-10.,1163030400,2,179,4.0

2072180,5,B00029NLBO,"Great Barney Video all focused on numbers 1 to 10.  What most people don't know and Amazon does not show on ""Product Details"" is that most of Barney's videos have a Spanish soundtrack.  So on the menu for Languages you can change it to Spanish!  I kept looking for Spanish videos as I want my child to be bilingual, and when I bought this video is was a nice surprise, when you change the language you see the SAME video dubbed in Spanish.  Yes, weird the words do not match the lips, but the songs have the same rhythm! and kids already know and love the video and can easily get the connection and learn it in Spanish!",1131062400,15,620,4.228813559322034

8024654,4,B00029NLBO,"Although it is dubbed, my son doesn't know it so it's ok, plus it's correct Spanish and flows well.  He used to ask for his Elmo Potty Time but since we got this it's always ""Barney""!  I don't know why he loves it but I like that the kids are sweet, polite, and helpful, and I feel it's good modeling for my son to imitate around other children his age.  For the record, my son plays very rough (throws things, pushes, runs around crashing into things, etc.) and he still loves this video and will sit still or imitate the dance and hand movements.",1417046400,,548,4.25
