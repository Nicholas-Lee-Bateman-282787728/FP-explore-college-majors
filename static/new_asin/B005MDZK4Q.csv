This 75th Anniversary release has four DVDs for its programming material. GWTW was the most successful movie in Hollywood's history. Its message of surviving an economic catastrophe must have resonated with people suffering from the Great Depression. Discs 1 and 2 contain the movie. The novel told about the very rich and their personal problems. It shows how the war affected people's lives and what happened to the survivors.

Disc 1 begins in 1861, people await ""The War for Southern Independence"" which will quickly be over. We see the society of the plantation owners (like feudal aristocracy) and their personalities. The main interest is Scarlett O'Hara and her whims and passions. Ashley rejects her, so she marries Charles who goes off to the war and dies. The South loses the Battle of Gettyburg and later Sherman's Army invades Georgia to split the Confederate states. Scarlett returns to find Tara devastated. She vows to live through this and never be hungry again.

Disc 2 begins with occupied Georgia and a new political rule. Scarlett marries a wealthy businessman to get the money needed to save Tara from the tax collector. Convicts provide cheap labor. Charles is killed in a raid on a shanty town. Scarlett is free to marry Rhett (who knows how to act for his self-interest). Scarlett faces down society while Melanie greets her. Later she asks Scarlett to look after her son and Ashley (she is going away on a long trip). But Ashley will always love Melanie. Rhett tells Scarlett he is leaving her. Saying ""I'm sorry"" can't make up for the past. ""Tomorrow is another day"" says Scarlett.

Disc 3 has ""Bonus Features About the Movie"".
