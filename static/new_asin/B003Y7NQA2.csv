5159611,1,B003Y7NQA2,Don't waste your time; seriously. It's not that funny. It's corny and boring at the same time. Why is there only one review? Because the producer reviewed it!,1365897600,,158,4.678571428571429
5159612,5,B003Y7NQA2,"The Mother of Invention is an absolute scream! I went into it with little or no expectations but was pleasantly surprised by its quirky, dark humor. Low-budget? Yes. High return for your investment? Yes! Bizarre doesn't begin to explain the ending - but you've got to pay attention!",1348185600,,282,4.895833333333333
5159613,5,B003Y7NQA2,"Excellent indie for people who've known a guy like this....and we all have. Great to see Mark Boone Jr and Kevin Corrigan, Craig Anton, Jimmi Simpson. All the cast is excellent and the writing is really great for a young  filmmaker. LOW budgets can still be made without compromise.",1320624000,,282,4.755102040816326

8527617,5,B003Y7NQA2,One of my favorite indy style films. Just love Vincent and want him to succeed so much. It's like a roller coaster of empathy and apathy! I even bought the DVD to support a film I like. Highly recommend this. Also try The Station Agent.,1450828800,,236,4.266666666666667
8527618,5,B003Y7NQA2,Fantastic independent movie. I'm never interested in indie movies but this one caught my attention and all the characters were perfectly acted out. Best movie I've seen this year.,1442448000,,179,5.206896551724138
8527619,4,B003Y7NQA2,"Funny movie that can be painful to watch at times, definitely utilizes a lot of awkward humor. Lots of quote worthy moments and you really feel for the character. Overall worth watching 4/5 Stars.",1440720000,,196,4.794117647058823
8527620,4,B003Y7NQA2,It's a low budget mocumentary that really is enjoyable and human in a very silly and odd way. Much better than I thought it would be going in. It's nothing revolutionary but it's worth a watch on a slow Sunday.,1440288000,,210,4.275
8527621,2,B003Y7NQA2,"I didn't laugh during the movie, but sharing some quotes with friends make it a memorable watch that gets better the more you watch it.",1431043200,,135,4.44
8527622,5,B003Y7NQA2,"I love this movie with all of my body. All of it. It's one part documentary, one part mocku DAMMIT.",1402531200,2,99,4.0
8527623,5,B003Y7NQA2,"This is a mockumentary of young Vincent (Andy Bowser) a would-be-inventor who seems to be shy one cup and saucer from the set. All his life he's been out invented by people that give away jellybeans and pizza. This time he is not about to be out invented. This is his last year and he's going to show people what he can do.

This is not a mockumentary about inventions but the integrity of the inventors their dreams and those of the people they choose to help them. Can we relate to Vincent's quest and will he finally succeed?

This film is low budget and it shows. They're experimenting with dialogue and it shows. Their timing is extremely excruciatingly and infuriatingly slow. I mean really slow. However I thank them for their effort; yet I don't think this presentation is gonna be on the top of any list.",1386028800,,813,4.486486486486487
8527624,3,B003Y7NQA2,A great mocumentary that is emotionally trying to watch. Jimmi Simpson is great and the film could a done with more of him.,1377820800,,123,4.391304347826087
