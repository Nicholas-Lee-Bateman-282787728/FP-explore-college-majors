8053421,5,B0007XHL3Y,"La Chauve-souris, a ballet after Johann Strauss' Die Fledermaus, with choreography by Roland Petit and danced by La Scala, is an unforgettable ballet - a modern gem. Petit's characteristic quirkiness, sexiness, inventiveness, and genius shine through and through in this production. The story is slightly clichd, but that allows Petit to further the emotional range - we cry, first of laughter, and then of love. It can't be overstated how genius and fitting his choreography is here - set to Strauss' beautiful music, each note is spot on with Petit's choreography, as if the music was made for the ballet, note for note! Alessandra Ferri (as Bella) is a stunning lead in her dual-persona role, possessing the ideal dancer's body with expressive talents; riddled with sultriness. Massimo Murru (as Johann) is also a great, expressive lead, completing the picture of an unloving couple. Luigi Bonino is the tricky and mischievous Ulrich, a hilarious character with the quirkiest facial expressions, as well as a terrific dancer. His jokes and style range from the Chaplinesque to those that only dancers could understand. Of course, the corps de ballet of La Scala looks stunning here. However, there would be no such effect if it weren't for Petit's genius choreography, coupled with Strauss' lively music.
The sets and costumes, designed by Jean-Michel Wilmotte (adapted by Jean-Michel Dsir) and Luisa Spinatelli, are all very pretty - especially Ferri's multiple costumes, ranging from housewife to showgirl-esque, as well as Murru's bat-like adornment. The ballet is filmed wonderfully in a good quality, I have no complaints about the angles utilized for film.
I STRONGLY recommend this ballet to everyone: this is an under-known gem. For some reason, Petit's Le jeune homme et la mort, Carmen, and L'Arlesienne have become widely-known ballets, but this hasn't reached international renown. This is a stunning, unforgettable ballet, paired with breathtaking music! Rest in peace, Roland Petit, you are sorely missed, for there has never been and will never be another like you!",1345939200,5,2083,5.2960725075528705
8053422,5,B0007XHL3Y,"This gem of a production is indeed a tribute to the brilliance of Ronald Petit more than anything else. Oh yes. Ferri has done a fantastic job, however, it is Luigi Bonino who really glitters. The production itself is brilliant, with the minimal amounts of props and sets yet looking lavish.
The adaptations of themes from the Strauss works is simply superb and I have ripped just the music into my iPod. It is the production as a whole that wins out here.
Absolutely SUPERB.",1268179200,3,475,4.6
8053423,3,B0007XHL3Y,"This was well done, but if you can get your hands on the version with Denys Ganio and Zizi Jean Marie, you will be in for a real treat.  Of course,  Zizi  was fabulous, as usual, but  Denys Ganio was amazing! He was an incredible dancer and artist!",1262908800,,248,4.104166666666667
8053424,5,B0007XHL3Y,"of the many reasons why one would purchase this dvd mine was to see alessandra ferri. some ballerinas are technically gifted. some have great acting skills. some have great stage charisma. alessandra ferri has it all and combines the three to give an added 4th dimension to her performances. i am absolutely charmed by her performance here as bella, ignored and neglected wife of johann. her entire performance was beguiling but the act two pas de deux where she clips johann's wings was just incredible. the emotions that were implied here could not be told thru dance alone but by a seamless intergration of body language and facial expression. just the type of thing alessandra does so well. it is true artistry that can reach inside a viewer and stir deep emotions. i can honestly say of all the ballerinas i have seen perform live and all the video performances i have watched, alessandra ferri is by far the best i have ever seen. im sure there are many who share the same infatuation that i have for ms ferri and (hard to believe)there are some of you who do not. but i admit freely to this obsession even as i now search for a new ballerina to worship from my seat (next to my wife) in the audience. all of that being said, the actual ballet was pretty good too. this is the third ballet i have seen choreographed by roland petit the other two being notre dame de paris and clavigo.(both superb) all three are starkly different from each other this being more comedic and boisterous, and i would say slightly less radical or modern then the other two i mentioned. one thing they all share in common is a stage gimmick or prop. notre dame had its giant swinging bell and a maze of staircases. clavigo descended to the stage like a giant spider. here, johann flys around with his ""bat wings"". if you enjoy roland petit's choreography this will not disappoint. i find it to be elegant, sophisticated, expressive and modern, although keeping a foot planted firmly in the traditional. massimo murru,s performance here as the disinterested husband johann is excellent. he reminds me a bit of another of ferri,s long time partners, julio bocca. the rest of the cast turn in fine performances as well. on the technical side of things, the picture is clear, the color is reproduced accurately and the lighting is very good. the editing is actually pretty good here. the camera angles that were chosen were very good and they tend to linger for a while which is a good thing. mostly all the angles include the whole dancers body. there are some closeups but nothing too distracting. the sound is excellent. and of course strauss music is the perfect accompaniment to the story. in conclusion; for ferri admirers, lovers of inventive choreography, la scala fans and those who want something a little different than classical ballet. magnificent!",1249257600,7,2842,4.720321931589537
8053425,5,B0007XHL3Y,"This dvd is my absolute favorite! Alessandra Ferri is superb as always and the music wonderful. Ferri is simply the best interpretive dancer ever. Her every glance lets you know just how she is feeling. The dinner sequence is charming and when she transforms into Belle...well, you just have to see the dvd! The storyline is simple; unappreciated housewife transformed into an irristable coquette tricks her bored husband into seeing her in a totally new light. Loved the dancing, music and staging.",1190419200,11,499,5.097560975609756
8053426,3,B0007XHL3Y,"This ballet based on Johann Strauss's 'Die Fledermaus' was created in 1979 by Roland Petit for his then-wife, Zizi Jeanmaire, who came out of retirement to dance the part of Bella (Rosalinde, in the opera). Creating the role of Ulrich (Falke in the opera) was the extraordinarily talented character dancer Luigi Bonino. Here, in a restaging 24 years later, Bonino recreates the part and also co-directs the production. And, to tell the truth, he is the only thing here that makes the performance worthwhile. Both the leading lady -- Alessandra Ferri -- and her husband (here called Johann) -- Massimo Murru -- are virtually ciphers, competent but uninteresting. There are many comic moments with much pantomime, some of it so frenetic that it is hard to watch, but one must add that the 'corpo di balletto' of La Scala, who contribute some of those moments, are excellent. The orchestra, led in Douglas Gamley's arrangement of music from the opera (with some additions from other Strauss music) by conductor Kevin Rhodes, are also fine. Sets by Jean-Michel Wilmotte (and updated by Jean-Michel D'&eacute;sir&eacute;'e) are in bright cartoon colors, adding to the farcical approach to the ballet. Costumes by Luisa Spinatelli and lighting by Jean-Michel D'&eacute;sir&eacute;'e are mostly unobtrusive and effective.

Still, except for the moments when Bonino shines -- and he does, especially with his Chaplinesque movements -- the ballet is flat as yesterday's champagne.
