Add to this mountain of proof the testimony of Clinton Curtis in Ohio 2004.  In his testimony the panel asks him ""are there programs that can be secretly used to fix elections?"" answer, ""Yes"", ""How do you know this to be the case?"", answer ""Because in October of 2000 I wrote a prototype for Congressman Tom Finney at the company I worked for in Florida that did just that.""  ""And when you say did just that, it could rig an election?"" answer, ""It would flip the vote 51-49"".

2736282,5,B000MKXF28,"Hacking Democracy is a documentary about vote fraud in the United States, featuring the democracy activist Bev Harris. She and her associates criss-crosses the country in search of evidence for malfeasance.

In Florida's notorious Volusia County, Harris almost ends up fighting two warehouse workers who have orders to trash incriminating evidence before the activists can get hold of it! In another dumpster, Harris finds a document proving that a common kind of computerized voting machine was never tested for security glitches. It turns out that many voting machines are easily hacked or are prone to malfunctions. The documentary actually shows a successful hack of the memory card of a voting machine, which then registers a fraudulent result. In the same trash bin, the activists also uncover evidence that Diebold (the company selling the voting machines) accept donations from the Republican Party...

A former associate of John Kerry reveals that the Democratic presidential candidate knew very well that the Bush camp organized massive vote fraud. Kerry conceded defeat anyway. This, of course, is the most disturbing facet of the situation: both major parties are in on it, which explains why none of them want to clean up the mess. (Another documentary about vote fraud, ""Invisible Ballots"", point out that Diebold is owned by Chuck Hagel, a Republican Congressman who has served in the Obama administration!)

It's almost symbolic that Bev and the other pro-democracy people are forced to dig through trash to find evidence for vote fraud. US democracy (such as it is) is being thrown in the bin. Since the 2016 elections are already the most hotly contested since the Civil War, things might get really ugly really fast if the electorate don't trust the system.

2736286,5,B000MKXF28,"This little HBO documentary, nominated for an Emmy in 2007, follows the investigations of Seattle grandmother Bev Harris into the irregularities and outright fraud perpetrated by Diebold Election Systems Inc., who with Election Systems & Software (ES&S, who bought DESI in 2009) control over 80% of the electronic polling places in America.  Harris's research proved that Diebold machines could be altered -- with no audit trail -- to produce incorrect vote totals.  With the aid of several computer security experts, Harris demonstrates at least four different methods of election tampering; all totally untraceable.  She catches Diebold executives on camera telling falsehoods about the reliability and security of their systems.  She films them perjuring themselves before Congress.

Diebold of course denies all charges.

Yet there were counties in the 2004 US Presidential election which delivered NEGATIVE vote totals (less than zero votes) for John Kerry.  Several critical jurisdictions reported extreme swaps in vote lead as counting progressed from 70% complete to 98% complete (and curiously always toward the Republican candidate).  Exit polls in both 2000 and 2004 differed markedly from the official election results in most states across the country.  Curious at best.

Sinister at worst.  Diebold officials were huge fundraisers for Bush and stated publicly in 2003 that they were ""committed to helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes to the president next year.""  Granted, CEO Walden O'Dell later backpedaled and stated he only meant to advance Bush's re-election through advocacy, but any public partisan stance by the manufacturer of untraceable vote counters should raise concern among voters and election officials.

Of course this is all history now.  The massive 2000 and 2004 election irregularities have been well-documented in many places.  It's good to remind ourselves however, going into 2012, that many of these problems appear to be still awaiting a fix.",1316822400,5,1986,5.5514950166112955

2736290,5,B000MKXF28,"Many of the revelations brought forth in Hacking Democracy probably would have seemed crazy if I hadn't been living in Florida when it all happened. During the 2002 election the computer voting machines forced me to write in a third party candidate that was supposed to be a choice. If I got one letter wrong in his name, the vote would not have counted. In 2004 I personally witnessed machines that would not accept a Presidential vote for John Kerry, each time the vote registered for Bush. In addition were the endless stories of problems in heavily democratic districts, most of which never made it onto the news. The media appeared to be ovewhelmed by the stories and had to pick the ones that seemed most credible.

Ultimately I was able to confirm much about how the Florida elections were manipulated. Bev Harris was a public figure showing what so many others were discovering on their own. In the end I wrote a novel called Purple State full of stories about what I witnessed. It was made more credible by the work that Bev has done with her organization Black Box Voting. Her efforts and this movie are invaluable to the integrity of our democracy.",1229904000,7,1159,4.6536585365853655
2736291,5,B000MKXF28,"This is a tremendous documentary.  Our democracy rises or falls on the integrity of our voting processes; that we've handed the tabulation of our votes over to unaccountable, highly secretive and in some cases party affiliated, private corporations is unconscionable.  What I can't stand is that the categorical denials of the Diebold executives (insert any CEO's unsubstantiated plea of innocence) regularly and inexplicably satisfy those presumably in a position to regulate, fine or jail the white collar thieves even in the face of prima facie evidence of corporate malfeasance.  Greg Palast broke the story of Florida voter disenfranchisement during the 2000 election.  Prior to running the story his editor contacted Governor Jeb Bush, who predictably denied any wrongdoing and on the Governor's word alone, sans any investigation or any corroborating witnesses, the story never ran.  Diebold was fined a nominal 2.6 million dollars for technical glitches and inaccuracies occurring in the state of Ohio, a pittance of their annual revenues but what is even more infuriating is that Ohio continues to spend millions of taxpayer dollars on Diebold equipment.  This entire thing is one big charade.  In America there is no higher authority than the multi-national corporations, at least not in general, practical terms.  And we no longer have a democratically governed, constitutionally based republic; what we have is ""corporatism"" or state capitalism, i.e. FASCISM.  Read the End of America and The Creature of from Jekyll Island and then, I don't know, start a riot--a peaceable, civilly disobedient demonstration, or something.",1225584000,4,1635,5.48207171314741

This video should be a ""Must Read"" by anyone who is seeking a political office through a public election process. It will open your eyes (and make you angry)with how the votes are tallied and so easily manipulated. I was so impressed with the video that I wrote (e-mailed) the author, Bev harris, for information.

2736302,5,B000MKXF28,"What stands out most from this dvd is not that there are issues with our voting system, but that very few people want to do anything to investigate or fix them. Practically every person that is approached for information or asked to investigate becomes defensive and obstructive. Even when it is obvious something is clearly wrong, the information is quickly hidden.

The recount in the Ohio county was shown that the election officials had already selected the 3% to count and had already pre counted them.

One senator states that to investigate would be to allow people to doubt the process. So, his answer is to ignore it.

This is a must see dvd..  really, it truly will make you mad that this is allowed to happen in the US.

One item that did stand out was the 2004 election and how John Kerry had a team of lawyers ready to challange the electronic voting results. He KNEW that fraud had been committed but instead conceded the election and stopped any challange.

What the DVD lacks is conclusions in regards to the issues in Florida. They are allowed by law to gain certain information and it was not provided. There is no followup to gain this information. They they find the official receipts in the trash, which is against the law, and nothing is followed up on this.  Then they discover differences between what they were given, and the results they found in the official results in the trash.. Basically, there appears to be no Legal bite to their approach.",1194393600,2,1472,4.638461538461539

This is a balanced review of some findings resuting from asking questions about how votes are counted. There are no fingers pointed, no one is directing blame and the film offers very few answers. This film gets your brain working, rather than shutting it down.

It's a well executed show that doesn't stray very far off it's mark. Do people in the U.S. know their vote is counted?",1193184000,3,561,4.666666666666667
2736304,5,B000MKXF28,"I first heard Bev Harris ( the chief Star, by ""acclamation,"" of this film, and called by Time Magazine the ""Godmother"" of voting reform ) on AM radio, a national broadcast, at the start of 2004. And that revelatory and long interview (4 hours) she gave on the overwhelming evidence of electronic fraud in our elections persuaded me to devote much of my time during the last three years to election fraud investigation and commentaries (such as this review of a GREAT film).  That also launched my own involvement as journalist and radio guest in this fight to restore our democracy, including invitations to discuss this at length on broadcasts on the East Coast, and many postings at the think tanks that have sprung up to address this incredibly dangerous threat to the very basis of our public life and government.

It has since been proven, as if there were ever really any question, that electronic voting is impossible to protect from hackers, especially those who have the most access to the machines: voting officials and voting machine vendors and their employees.  Add to this the eerie and vast presence of the CIA, NSA, FBI and many other covert agencies behind the scenes in the counting of our vote, which can be easily documented beyond a ""shadow"" of a doubt, and you have a full blown catastrophe.  Such is what many of us believe has happened.  We currently have no way of knowing what has occured in the casting and counting of electronic votes.  I made my views public several years ago that I also believed optical scan machines, which have been counting our votes since the early 1980s, are just as impossible to secure, and as easy to rig.  Unbelievably easy.  In fact, they seemed designed to rig.  The clear conclusion of all this is that we really have no way of knowing what the results of our elections have been for over a quarter of a century at least.  The greatest payoff in this truly outstanding and crucially important film ( as in ""must see for every American,"" if not all other world citizens as well ) was what they saved for last, the best: that Harri Hursti performed a hack of an optical scan machine at the film's end under Florida Voting Supervisor Ion Sancho's supervision ( previously interviewed by Bill Moyers on PBS ""NOW"" at the beginning of August 2004 ) and complete rig of a vote, he reversed the results of winner and loser in the most easy and quite shocking way, in just a few moments ~~ before, as Bev Harris has since written, ""Bip, bip, bip, we could even get our camera equipment set up.""  It was done that easily.

People and my fellow American viewers: watch this film, and then help us return to a procedure of voting that is dependent upon the people of this country, its citizens, and not ""experts.""  Return to hand counting paper ballots, and then posting the results in plain view of the public at the precinct level, on the doors or walls of the polls themselves. And don't close the polls until the results are counted, re-counted to match, and posted on the premises, the same night.  If poll workers are not available, they can be easily drafted, randomly, and paid for the day's work.  The most important day's work, the most important job, in the country.  Obviously a job that is currently more ""important,"" certainly more relevant, than the presidency itself....

Computers have many benefits to offer us: counting our votes clandestinely is NOT one of them.

Over 75% of the world's democracies cast and count votes on hard copy, paper.  And they make sure the counts match.  WE, on the other hand, while lecturing all the world on the supremacy of our democracy, only ""audit"" TWO PER CENT of our votes, if that.  Ever.  What does that smell like, to you.  This movie investigates all of these shocking gaps in security, and leaves you to decide whether or not we're getting our votes heisted electronically (and/or otherwise) by parties known or unknown..... And it leaves a simple conclusion: vote on hard copy, paper, and count in public, with full disclosure. Most importantly, at the precinct itself, posting them for public view, so that the chain of custody of the votes can NOT be hacked, somewhere higher up the chain.  Only posting vote totals for all to see in the local neighborhood, polls, will establish what really has taken place, before any opportunities to alter vote totals, elsewhere.  This is the key priority of them all, and something that cannot be achieved on machines: totally de-centralizing and disclosing vote results and totals at their point of origin, not elsewhere with opportunities for theft and fraud, but ONLY in the locale of each poll.  Anyplace else is an open door for fraud......

If anyone tells you this is somehow outlandish, beware of a vested interest.  Hand counting paper ballots is how Canada does it. Germany does it.  In fact, MOST countries do it.  Dan Rather even has reported that we are now outsourcing our voting ""technology"" to the Philippines with no thought of security or quality control, a staggering fiasco.  And guess what, since 1999: THEY now do it: on paper.

Is this what has happened to our democracy?  The Filipinos themselves were targets of such electronic fraud, and their case in one election went to their Supreme Court.  Result?  They now hand count paper ballots.

When our very gravely, greatly rigged 2000 election, with memory cards stolen in Florida (one was substituted that gave Gore a MINUS 16,000 votes, in Volusia County, documented, and just enough to put his ""well-known"" rival over the top) went to OUR Supreme Court (Bush vs. Gore), the Supremes, unlike their better behaved counterparts in the Philippines, awarded an unverified and wholly illegally processed election to our current illegal ""pResident.""

Whatever party you belong to, or don't, we must ALL understand that it is unacceptable to select presidents in such an obscure manner. What's sauce for the goose, the gander too, and next time it may be not be the other guy's candidate, but yours....

WE the PEOPLE are constitutionally empowered to decide that, not criminals and illegally ensconced Supreme Court judges ( if the ""presidents"" that appointed them were illegally sworn in, then so were these court appointees, am I right? ).

It is nothing less than shadow anarchy, where these decisions are made by people whose faces we will never see and identify.  It is an occult process, voting by machine, without citizen oversight, and MUST be stopped.

Watch this movie, and then tell me if you can come up with any other, or better, solution than to hand count, and recount, paper ballots marked with indelible ink, and posted in plain view of a watchful public.

I'm all ears while waiting for any and all answers.  If you come to the conclusion I have, then just perhaps your children, and their children's children's kids, just for starters, will thank you......

Meanwhile, your House of Representatives in DC is contemplating a bill known as HR 811 that will put machines in to stay, and wipe out what remains, truly, of our voting rights.  That's because powerful lobbies such as Microsoft and Diebold and ES&S, and other such criminal interests, are banging on their doors and rewriting it, and trying to write computerized voting and utterly secret counting into permanent law.  Watch the film, and let your representatives know your outrage and what a Zogby Poll discovered last August, 2006: that over 92% of Americans polled said they wanted a system of voting where citizens could see and verify themselves the results of OUR elections...... One of the highest results ever recorded in a major American poll.

The clock is ticking on our freedoms and their very survival.  Find out what's happening, really happening, by watching this priceless documentary, and then please, for all our sakes, shout it out.

It is heartbreaking to see how trusting and gullible we have been about

our democracy is eroding away due to lack of morals and ethics on the

Congratulations to Bev Davis for leading her group to question, step-by-step, the reliability of our voting machines and those who administer the voting process -- one of the most basic tenants of citizenship in our country. The viewer's jaw will drop at the outrageous claims of the voting machine makers and election officials who are brought into the daylight for examination by these determined citizens - and now by us.",1183852800,7,765,5.079365079365079
2736307,4,B000MKXF28,"I am an extreme left-leaning Democract. Frankly, I'm more Socialist than anything else, at least on many issues. Like many in the party, I was entirely inked that the Bush Bunch managed to steal the Florida elections. I kept referring to him as ""The Pretender-in-Chief"" for most of his first term.

When the 2004 elections happened, they were messy and foul, but I assumed that at least, sucky though the results were from my point of view, Bush had won legitimately.

Then I saw this film.

Wow.

You know, if even a small amount of what's presented in this movie is true, we have a major problem on our hands. I suspect a lot more than a small amount is true, which makes it even worse.

Ultimately in our democracy we have to trust our elections, even if we can't trust anything else. Given how easy it appeared to be for the Finnish hacker to get into the system, and the comments from the Diebold executive about making sure Ohio would go for Bush, and a number of other things in the movie, I've come to the conclusion that we cannot trust our elections.

One of my friends is a Republican. A gay, neo-conservative, ditto-head, knee-jerk Republican. Imagine Anne Coulter as a not-very-attractive man, and you're on the right track. I've tried to get him to watch this movie and he simply carps about how the Democrats only care about election fraud now that it's the Republicans doing it.

I think he misses the point rather a bit.

The movie is a little overpriced, but well worth the purchase by people of any party. Like I said, we need to trust our elections, or what do we have?",1183766400,9,1589,4.493055555555555
2736308,4,B000MKXF28,"Was George W. Bush ever legitimately elected president? The answer, according to many, is no. Whether they are correct, the fact that there is so much distrust in elections is a serious problem, even if the elections were completely legitimate. That legitimacy and the perception of illegitimacy are at the heart of ""Hacking Democracy"" and represent the consuming passion of Bev Harris, the center of the film and author of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Box-Voting-Ballot-Tampering-in-the-21st-Century/dp/1890916900/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Box Voting: Ballot Tampering in the 21st Century</a>. Harris, as the film shows, is obsessed with voting rights, especially when it comes to computer voting.

This issue should be non-partisan. Americans should be concerned about the accuracy of the vote regardless of their party affiliation. Unfortunately, the film, perhaps for reasons of recent history, seems to portray Democrats as the victims of Republicans' machinations. In particular, the film suggests strongly that President George W. Bush's two elections were the result of voter[...], not of actual votes, first in Florida and then in New Mexico and Ohio. I suspect that today's highly polarized zeitgeist might lead those who lean right to dismiss the film while those who lean left to endorse it uncritically. If I'm right, then it's a shame since the issue really is vital to the country.

Bev Harris, from the film's depiction, is a concerned citizen who stumbled across a mistake when she was doing an Internet search. Concerned about Diebold, which makes, programs, and sells electronic voting machines, she happened to find an ftp site that the company had neglected to remove from the Web. She downloaded over dozens of hours all sorts of files, including code to earlier versions of the voting programs. She allowed experts to look at the code, and they found serious flaws.

However, Harris did more than just download codes. She went through the trash of various organizations, including a local government in Florida, finding all sorts of things, including (the film would have us believe) evidence of illegality in Florida. She also oversaw the hacking of a Diebold data card in what the film claims is proof that machines can be hacked. (The scene, it must be admitted, is impressive. Eight people vote in a pseudo-election, and the machine reports the results incorrectly. A 6-2 vote turns into a 7-1 vote the other way.)

""Hacking Democracy"" is a gripping film, one that seems to strive for neutrality. There is one scene with a Republican candidate who noticed and videotaped an electronic malfunction. There is also a passing reference Republican objections to the voting machines in some states. Nonetheless, the focus on the two elections of 2000 and 2004 leaves the film with an apparent, if not actual, partisan bias. Even so, the film is more than compelling. It is frightening. Whether President Bush was duly elected once, twice, or never is beyond the point of the film, at least for me. The fact is that many parts of the country have entrusted elections to machines that are not sufficiently trustworthy, and more and more, the mechanisms of vote counting are hidden from nearly everyone. All we know is that people vote, the votes go into the proverbial black box, and then a result comes out.

This is not to say that the machines are inaccurate. The film stops short of actually saying that any particular election was ""stolen,"" but the point that an election COULD be stolen is made abundantly clear. Therein lies a serious problem.

""Hacking Democracy"" is at its weakest when it goes off on tangents that question the problems in Ohio and Florida. This is not to say that there were no problems; of course there were. Any human enterprise on the scale of a national election is going to have problems. However, ""Hacking Democracy"" seems to fail to appreciate this point. Thus, a mention of intolerably long lines at some Ohio precincts is present apparently to add information to the evidence against the Ohio election. But this parenthetical mention is not entirely fair; it is, as presented, more innuendo than substantive fact.

""Hacking Democracy"" is, by contrast, at its strongest when it focuses on Harris, her fellow crusaders, and their struggles against a huge corporation. At the heart of the movie is a David versus Goliath story about a few individuals who take on a large, apparently corrupt corporation and, amazingly, come out ahead quite a few times. This human element seems to be missing from the film, which seems instead to want to rely on Harris's grandmotherly qualities to engender the viewer's sympathy.

Still, ""Hacking Democracy"" is a vitally important film. Its message, however imperfect the delivery, is one that should be heard. Even if the charges in the film are incorrect (and I understand that Diebold vigorously denies most of them), it is vital that the country protect faith in the system, and the film offers a convincing argument that transparency is the most important step.",1181260800,16,5111,5.194174757281553

The Russians hacked our elections and the current method of voting puts us in danger of the private corporations that DO NOT allow even the government to review the programming of these machines. Technology has bitten us in many cases, we should NOT risk that which is at the heart of our democracy by allowing these private corporations to have total control over our votes. We should vote by methods that allow our votes to be counted as cast which also has the ability to do recounts, not the case with many of the voting machines used today. Contact your Sec of State office to fight to change how we vote. Do it now! The Russian certainly do have the ability to hack these machines, in spite of what government officials say, including your sec of state.
