And at some point, they also debuted the colorized version of this classic. I can still recall the furor that colorization created, with many of Hollywood's legends being against it, since it was basically changing the way films of that era were originally intended to be seen ( in black and white). Film critic Gene Siskel even went so far as to compare the process to a form of vandalism. But I still wish someone would re-release the colorized version.

By the turn of the century, Alaska (not yet a state) was quickly becoming the new 'Wild West' and that atmosphere was well presented in 'Spawn of the North'. Centered on lifelong friends Tyler (George Raft) and Jim (Henry Fonda). They make their living fishing for Alaskan salmon. Tyler is impatient for greater success, and thinks he sees an opportunity by partnering with the greasy, sleazy Russian, Red Skain (played very well by Akim Tamiroff). Red and his men make their money by illegally raiding the fish traps of others. This tests Tyler's friendship with the law-abiding Jim, and an ultimate showdown between himself, Red and Tyler begins to take shape. Dorothy Lamour's heart belongs to Tyler, but quickly sees the dangerous path he's on. Fonda's love interest was played by Louise Platt, an accomplished actress who strangely did only a handful of films and gravitated back to stage performances after the early 1940's.

Just a rousing good film with a stellar cast. It seems odd now, but Raft got top billing because he was the bigger star at the time. Some of Fonda's biggest films were still a few years off (his first Oscar nomination was for 'Grapes of Wrath', 1940). As for Dorothy Lamour, she was fresh from her last film, the highly acclaimed disaster epic, 'The Hurricane'. Her sex appeal was still very much intact, as part of her scenes here involved a clingy top, which keeps everything well covered, but it was clearly worn with no bra underneath. The aforementioned showdown, with Jim in one fishing boat, and Red and Tyler in another, is truly a cinema classic and not to be missed!",1431475200,2,2202,4.746736292428198

7790285,5,0783224478,"SPAWN OF THE NORTH is one of the most underrated films from the late 1930's although at the time it was a big hit and won Academy Awards for it's excellent special effects (so impressive they were lifted in put in later films).  The movie stars Henry Fonda, Dorothy Lamour, George Raft, and John Barrymore and is set in Alaska. Dorothy Lamour has one of the best dramatic roles of her career as the cannery girl torn between Raft and Fonda and Barrymore is excellent in one of his best ""character"" parts as a drunken newspaperman but the emphasis is on action.  The fairly recent movie THE PERFECT STORM seems to have been a little inspired by this classic.  This movie is a must for those who love big-budget ""big"" movies with top production values.",1102032000,9,750,4.54074074074074
7790286,4,0783224478,"In the thirties, all-star action melodramas didn't come much better than SPAWN OF THE NORTH, an eventful yarn of the war between Russian and American salmon-fishing fleets along the Alaskan coast.  It was a winner for Paramount, which made several such big-scale mass entertainments in a period when other companies were scooping up all the Oscars and critics' awards.  Even some of the reviewers enthused about the rugged vigour of Henry Hathaway's direction of this Barrett Willoughby story, scripted by Jules Furthman and Talbot Jennings.  Performances pleased, too:  Henry Fonda as the stalwart skipper, Dorothy Lamour as the gal who stands by him, defying the world, the flesh and the devil; George Raft as Fonda's pal (who goes over to the bad guys but thinks better of it).  The great John Barrymore is great fun as a grizzled, guzzling newspaperman and Akim Tamiroff is good as the Russian heavy.  Charles Lang's photography (the exteriors shot mostly in Alaska) was magnificent.",1005868800,14,987,5.1375
