8116090,3,B000F0UV1I,Wonderfully based on Psalm 37 which I now appreciate.  I know movies collapse time but this one might lead one to believe that God answers prayer immediately.,1427155200,,158,4.851851851851852
8116091,4,B000F0UV1I,Simple but prettty enjoyable flick.  Good light entertainment.,1413676800,,62,6.75
8116092,4,B000F0UV1I,"not the best production, but one of the best lessons in trusting Christ and his promises, and trusting Him is the only way today, tomorrow and beyond! I loved it!",1396915200,,162,4.433333333333334
8116093,1,B000F0UV1I,I was not able to watch this video until the end because it stopped half way. I don't know if the problem with the video or my internet connection but I was able to watch some other streaming video without any problem.,1388620800,,218,4.214285714285714
8116094,3,B000F0UV1I,"It is a nice show and entertaining. It's not a high quality show, but is okay and is worth watching on a rainy day",1381795200,,114,3.7916666666666665
8116095,1,B000F0UV1I,Zero! Couldn't get past 15 minutes. The words didn't match the mouth & the film skipped. Shut it down. t,1380499200,,104,4.25
8116096,5,B000F0UV1I,I highly recommend all of the videos made by this company! Great to use in VBS for your church or in other Children's Bible programs! The stories are memorable and teach lessons that children will remember their entire life. There is a great need for decent Christian viewing options that teach character and good morals. This is a story about the change that comes from salvation! Great buy and addition to any Christian family library!,1255651200,2,437,4.84
