8327503,4,B001NOIJ82,"As if you see the director's profile, you will find out that he had made a lot of documentaries before. You will find out that this film is like one of the documentary as well althouh it is a fiction story that he created.
If you see the poster or the artwork of the dvd, you will feel that this might be some kind of pornographic film but it is far from it. The director is wise enough to make the audiences' attention, to draw more people's attention to come and see his movie. That is the reason why he made more explicit nude shots. It is not all about nudity and explicit exposure of women's body shots and there is a reason why he made this film.
There are two main charactors in this film. One is a man who is an ex-nurse who is from Ukrania that came to Austria after being fired, and another man who is a night security guard who is from Austria to Ukrania looking for a job. Both are suffering for having no job. But they are quite different.

Now that's the point of this movie I guess.
The woman did all kinds of things to survive. She did sex chatting with the internet camera. It was really pain because the man inside the internet always asked all kinds of dirty things to her by shouting and screaming to her and it was really not comfortable for her. Such as spreading her legs, showing her thing more closer and all. The thing is she is not a professional prostitute and all that things that men are asking is really pain thing to do.
She decides to go to Austria a dream country for her. But it is not easy for her there too. The job she found was cleaning the hospital where a bunch of old people are hospitalized. Some of them are dying in their sleep and there is this one grandfather who are nice to her who is also from Ukrania. She was so sad him dead.
But the life goes on. She had to live.  But she keep on living. She work and work.

On the other hand, the night guard, he just keep asking for money from his dad who is a jerk seeking for sex from a bunch of women, really young women- I say about 18 tops. We see explicit nude shots of women who are being asked to do things from this father. The father even asks his son to enjoy together have twosome.
The guy doesn't work or seeking hard to find a job. He is a eay goig kind of a guy who can be comparable to the woman who works so hard, warm hearted who can feel sorry for the old man who dies on the bed in the hospital.

Both of the people are having the same situation. The man is having a hard time because 1. he has no job, 2. he is running away from a bunch of people he own money from.
The woman is also having a hard time not having a decent job but she is keep working hard.
We can see who is right and who is wrong right away.
Life is hard. No one is a winner here. We just have to do our best sometimes. And sometimes we just have to keep going even though some things are against our will, Some things are not what we want to do but we do because we have to earn money out of it.

It is not easy to love the woman or the man in this movie easily becuase the director is not trying hard to make them concentrate to be lovable. It's more like documentary style. There is no such thing as cry or hate or love or anger or anything. We just watch the movie and at the end we decide what the movie is about.

But one thing for sure is the movie was worth watching. It made us feel something after all.",1461628800,,3390,3.970631424375918

8327505,4,B001NOIJ82,"The title says it all : people as commodities in the new European landscape of invisible borders. It could have been called East, West as the flow of labour in the film is both from the Ukraine to Vienna and from Vienna to the Ukraine. Seidl's style of directing is bleak semi-documentary. He uses a mix of amateur actors and real people in real locations, some shooting of which may have been ethically dubious: showing a site of real internet porn and the actors performing in a way that is intrusive; secondly, shooting most of the last part of the film in a real geriatric ward in Vienna. A real housing estate in Slovakia is shown.

There are two parallel stories: Olga (Rak) who leaves behind her mother and young child in the Ukraine to seek out a better life in Vienna;and a headstrong young security guard Pauli (Hoffman) who is unemployed and on the run from loan sharks, leaves Vienna to accompany his step-father on a trip delivering gumball machines in Eastern Europe. However his lascivious step-father has other things like the humiliation of young Ukrainian prostitutes( again real) on his mind much to his step-son's disgust. His escape from this relationship is a sign of hope and independence though he is still unemployed. Olga too has to demean herself- abused by internet porn customers,also a young boy at the home in Vienna where she is an au pair; and has to take the inferior job of a cleaner on a geriatric ward when she is a qualified nurse.

Although the scenes on the ward are gruesomely voyeuristic, breach confidentiality, there is dignity and warmth and redemption in her dance with the dying man. Into the real environment of post-Soviet Europe Seidl inserts fictional beings and with the spontaneity of dialogue in his method of shooting the scenes there is a randomness which makes the viewer want to carry on watching. This is uncomfortable viewing done in beautiful tableau-like framed scenes which draw you in. The two leads are non actors whose lives were not far from the roles they played. There is a very real fight between Olga and the nurse which is totally spectacular, which illustrates her fighting spirit. In the last frame in the geriatric Alzheimer's ward there are words uttered by the dying patients like' stink' and `death' (repeatedly) which are worthy of Beckett",1408838400,4,2318,4.807017543859649

8327507,5,B001NOIJ82,"Ulrich Seidl has done it again! Not since Italian neorealism from the likes of De Sica and Pasolini, or the German newwave of the 70's: Schl&ouml;ndorff, Herzog, Fassbinder, etc., have we been treated to such a realistic and actual representation of the human condition in its present state. In ""Import Export"" from 2007 and written and directed by Ulrich Seidl (co-written by Veronika Franz), we have such a film. Some of the reviewers here have complained about the bleakness of the story and characters. Oh really!! I'd like to know where they've been for the last twenty-odd years! Are they aware, that as a matter of fact, life is just like this, for many people around the world, including right here in the U.S. (just stick around for the coming financial meltdown, and see how bad things are going to get). I for one, will not fault the filmmaker, for having the courage to show reality and not meaningless 'escapist-entertainment'. The message of the story is really one of hope and redemption, examine it carefully. 'Olga' (wonderfully portrayed by newcomer Ekateryna Rak) makes a new life for herself in Vienna, and struggles to overcome displacement and prejudice. Even with her own uncertain future, she is able to show so much compassion and kindness towards the nursing home residents (where she ends-up working), who respond in kind. Her resolve, is demonstrated when she is physically attacked by the spiteful and envious nurse 'Maria'. 'Pauli' (Paul Hofmann) on the flip-side, represents a citizen of Vienna, that has not tasted the fruits of western-style success, and is on opposite poles to the aspirations and wishes of so many emigrants to the West. That's why he has nothing to lose, by venturing to the East and seeing the other side of life for himself. Ultimately, what Ulrich Seidl has given us here, is a glimpse of a social-structure that is in place just about everywhere (these characters could be from anywhere), and is far removed from the ideal world and life that humankind is really striving for (subconsciously anyway)! Once again, I salute this amazing Auteur, for giving us a bold and daring work, that is questioning the human condition that's all around us. The DVD picture and sound quality by Palisades Tartan is excellent. NTSC, German (English subtitles), extras, NR 135 mins. (BTW: This film is for mature audiences, there are scenes of a sexual and explicit nature.)

Love and Peace,
Carlos Romero",1353369600,2,2445,4.963414634146342
8327508,3,B001NOIJ82,"One of the most depressing, unsettling and bleakest movies I have seen in a long time, 135 minutes long Import/Export 2007, written/directed by Ulrich Seidl is gloomy, dark, and disturbing film. It feels like a documentary, and the winter landscapes in both parts of Europe, Eastern (Ukraine) and Western (Vienna, Austria) look and feel equally un- inviting and mean. Who would think that beautiful out of the fairy tale Vienna could be shot so un-appealing but I guess the nursing places for the ill and old patients are not the most cheerful places anywhere in the world, and they only add to the overall feeling of pessimism, degradation, lack of hope or anything uplifting in the existence of two main characters who never met because their lives moved in the parallel directions, and every character they come across.

Ulrich Seidl excels in giving Import/Export feel of a documentary and in showing how advanced the humans are in corrupting and humiliating one another. I think this film takes a prize for the amount of the un- sexy, most unpleasant and longest X-rated scenes ever filmed. I guess if sex is not accompanied with love, desire or at least, lust, it is very boring and uncomfortable to watch and makes a viewer guilty for the degradation they are forced to watch and makes them want to stop or fast-forward these scenes as fast as possible. If that what Ulrich Seidle intentions were - he succeeded fully. Let me put it this way - Import/Export is a well-made move. It made me think of the serious matters - for instance, how high is the price of freedom to look for and to find a better life, to support yourself and your family, to be able to go to any country you chose and to succeed there. I did not see a single false note in any performance given mostly by the non- professionals. Import/Export achieves what it was set to do but I would never watch it again. I got the point(s) and I don't think that it is for multiple viewings.
