3527715,4,6303549012,"I'm not going to lie to you, the acting is pretty bad.  The 'scene' accuracy is also very very low.  For a subculture that had a unique style of dress, Christina Applegate looks as though she just came from a Pearl Jam concert.  The music in the film that isn't from any real/legitimate artist of the day sounds the same as the car chase scene music in an old episode of Hunter.

Why should you see this movie?  Its so bad that its good.  Infact its a personal favourite and thats why I have it 4 stars.  Its definately worth checking out to see appearances by classic rave/techno acts FIERCE RULING DIVA and U96.

Sadly, the US edition of the film does not include the performance by the UTAH SAINTS.  It was cut from the original VHS release and I expected it to show up on the DVD.  I don't know why..probably licensing? ...or maybe the Saint's saw the final cut of the film and didn't want anything to do with it!  Here's a tip though, the hong kong region-free release of this dvd includes this cut scene!!

This movie was written and directed by Michael Paseornek who is now the President of Lion's Gate Films.  It stars Christina Applegate and James Marshall.  Apparently this guy Scott Cohen who plays one of the sidekicks has a following and is often mentioned in relation to this movie.  One other actress playing a side part in this is Faye Grant.  She is most remembered from the classic 80's sci-fi mini series ""V"".",1153785600,4,1428,4.434615384615385
3527716,5,6303549012,ok first off great acting but the music was banging i  would love to get a hold of the soundtrack if its possible the song when he comes out as cyberstorm for the fist time i love that song anyone knows how holla at me,1083542400,2,218,3.8444444444444446
3527717,3,6303549012,"I give this movie 3 out of 5.  One for the Utah Saints, one for being accidentally humorous during the more crucial plot points, and one for the exquisitely lovely and multi-talented Scott Cohen (best known at the time of this review from his recent breakout role as Wolf in the NBC miniseries ""The Tenth Kingdom"" and as hyper-verbal bad penny Detective Harry Denby on ABC's ""NYPD Blue"").  Although it's obvious that nobody in the movie is particularly comfortable with the techno genre, Mr. Cohen's ""young and strong and perverted... and everything that makes a young man a star"" performance as the artiste-ic Simeon makes the whole movie worth watching... or at least the parts with him in it.  The remainder of the cast, with the exception of Faye Grant (Zena, the landlady) and, to a lesser exception, David Burke (Geek, Simeon's best bud and resident techie) give performances worthy of a ""The Producers"" style extraplot.  It does appear very much as if someone wanted to see Christina Applegate make out with a freak of nature and wrote a movie about her doing just that.
The only reason to even bother with this movie is if you are 1) really *really* into Christina Applegate (although even so, I don't recommend it, because this movie heavily reinforced my desire to see her struck repeatedly in the mouth with a large, solid object).  She attempts to play off as an ethereal earth child and ends up spewing every stereotype imaginable about hippies and flower children. (""Utopia is just around the corner."" - Puh leeze.),
or 2) you're really *really* into Scott Cohen.  This is a seminal work and for that alone, it's interesting.  Comparing Simeon (first big thing) to Wolf (latest big thing), it's amazing to see the versatility *within* stability that this man is able to project.  There's no ""rough around the edges"" or ""wet behind the ears"" to this person.  It's absolutely breathtaking to see someone who knew he was a star from the moment his feet hit the ground.  In a Hollywood world of stuttering egos, one hit wonders, and faltering pedagoguery, Mr. Cohen truly stands out as an Actor, an Artist, and a Talent (capitalization very much *intended*).
That is, if you can force yourself to sit through the rest of the movie.",977270400,,2241,4.797402597402598
3527718,3,6303549012,"Okay- to sum it up, the movie wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. The music was good even though I'm not into techno, and the acting could have been worse. I agree wiht Suz's review for the most part (I know her from her site and an e-group) and I think she basiclly said everything I wanted to. Anamika is almost ignorant in the ways of karma, exploration, self-exspression and anything else that has to do with that. I myself am into metapsychics, and think that they should have backed off when it got there. Thankfully though, they didn't focus on it. James Marshall was interestingly good as T.J. BUT the hands he used were obviously fake and you could tell during the rather stupid rave scene it was either not him or he just put metal plates on his hands. Simeon's character was funny;he had the best lines and the most rave-ish attitude, but Scott looked somehow out of place in this movie. (For those of you who don't know, Scott is Scott Cohen, my fave actor who was in 'Gia' '10th Kingdom' and playes Dec. Denby on 'NYPD Blue.' -It's a guest role.-) If anything, Scott is the most likeable character, and is in the best scenes. If you see this movie, do it for Scott or to laugh during the whole thing because even at 2 am, this movie sucked worst then a high school drama club, 2 week rehersal play.",974678400,,1315,4.327935222672065
3527719,3,6303549012,"This film can best be summed up with a simple two-word phrase:
Nice try.
Allow me to explain.
SPOILERS AHEAD! IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW,  DON'T READ!
TJ (James Marshall) is on his way to becoming a  well-established and well-known musician, his specialties being the  keyboard and the guitar. He and his band have begun to get the recognition  they have worked so hard for, and the future looks bright.
Viewers note:  when the future starts to look bright or in the smallest bit rosy, you can  guarantee something bad is about to happen.
Something bad happens.
Bet  you didn't see that coming.
Late for a performance after canoodling with  his girlfriend (Paige Turco, later to turn up on `American Gothic' and  `NYPD Blue'), he unfortunately gets involved in an incident with a gang of  thugs that ends up with TJ losing both his hands.
Needless to say, TJ is  incredibly upset, not knowing how to go on without being able to express  his `talents'. After his girlfriend freezes up when he touches her with his  new artificial hands, he leaves home.
Finding himself in the city he  lives on the streets, spending most of his time drunk and trying to clean  car windows.
One afternoon he crawls into a building and snoozes, until  loud music wakes him. It seems that at night the building turns into the  setting for a rave, and TJ has found himself smack bang in the middle of  one.
Enter Anamika (Christina Applegate). Her real name is Marie or  something, but I guess Anamika is easier to say...
Seeing TJ is clearly not  sure of what's going on, she leads him outside to get some air...eventually,  through a whole pile of incidents I'm not going to get into (yes, it was  boring and tedious and this review will end up the same way), he moves in  with her so he can dry out and no longer be dependant on alcohol.
It's  here where we meet the people who live in the same building as  Anamika:
Zina (Faye Grant): The landlady, who despite - or because of -  her defensiveness, seems to have a thing for Simeon. Also has a thing for  metal and performance art.
Geek/Leonard (some guy): A geek - computer  whiz, technological whiz, glasses, always wears a white shirt. A computing  clich.
Simeon (Scott Cohen, who incidentally also turns up on NYPD Blue  before this film as one character, and after it as another, but is best  known as Wolf from `The 10th Kingdom'): The ladies man with a heart of  gold. A new girl every day but that's why they love him (""He's a tramp, but  they love him...""), and he protects and sticks up for his friends.
I  describe this at the top as `worth the effort for one thing'; Scott Cohen  is the one thing.
For all the films good intentions - the fact that life  is worth living after disability, true love can happen anywhere - there's  an itty, bitty, little problem.
It sucks.
If James Marshall gets any  less expressive, he'll fall into a coma. His hairdo is straight out of the  80's (even after he has it cut). The metal hands made for him are so  OBVIOUSLY too big and clumsy for him to play the keyboard with the required  accuracy.
Christina Applegate's character believes in karma, in  spirituality - that's fine. But I know people who also believe in those  things and not a single one of them speaks the way she does - as if her  head were stuck up something unpleasant because she's so full of  herself.
But it's not all bad news.
The actor who plays Geek is  actually quite good, as is TJ's girlfriend, effectively showing her  unintentional reaction to his hands. Faye Grant is great as Zina, and then,  of course, we come to Mr Scott Cohen.
Ah, thank heavens. I make no secret  of my admiration for Mr Cohen's work, and I'll continue to make it no  secret right now.
Simeon is...probably best described as an intelligent  Joey from `Friends'. Or, a ruder version of Wolf from `The 10th  Kingdom'.
In fact, Simeon is startlingly close in characterisation to  Wolf. Energetic, enthusiastic, acting on his impulses as often as he can,  but also fiercely protective of those he loves.
The big difference? Wolf  is saving himself for the right woman. Simeon finds the right woman - or  more - every day.
Personally, I think the right woman for Simeon would be  Zina. The chemistry and dialogue between them is terrific, and that goodbye  kiss was very revealing.
Not that I spend that much time thinking about  it.
Really.
Or it could just be that I'm an obsessive compulsive with a  Scott Cohen fixation.
Either way, he's the reason the film gets three  stars. I do want to give it five, but the bulk of it just drags the score  right down.
Piece of advice: just watch Simeon's scenes. Cute, charming,  funny, best lines, nice guy. If you do decide to watch the whole thing,  watch it with a group of friends and make fun of it. Believe me, it's VERY  entertaining.
Rounding up...let's return to the beginning...nice try, but as  they say, no cigar.
And I'm convinced that absolutely no one involved  with the movie has EVER been to a rave. But what do I know?",966124800,7,5006,4.507246376811594
3527720,5,6303549012,I seen this movie on Showtime and it blew me away.  Christina Applegate is really underrated as an actress.  She gives a phenomenol performance.  The story line is fantastic and it's a movie that makes you think about life  and your place in it.  I highly recommend it and I hope it comes out on VHS  again or DVD to buy.,964742400,4,321,4.180327868852459
8292318,2,6303549012,I watched this movie because of Christina Applegate.  Who plays sort of a new age grung hippie.  The movie is about a keyboard player who is about to make it big.  But in a act of extreme violence loses both of his hands.  And they fit him with these rubber hands that Woody Harrelson in King Pin would have been proud of.  So he goes around feeling sorry for himself and not wanting any help from anybody.  The movie goes on and he gets fitted with some hi-tech hands that look like they would be good for playing video games with.  And he is able to program them so that he can start playing keyboards again  The same guys that caused him to lose his hands show up again later and get arrested and that is pretty much it.  Christina Applegate is just naturally hot no matter what kind of charector she plays.  Have you ever seen Nowhere.  Makes the movie worth watching.  If there was a way to just piece together her scenes and not watch the rest of the movie.  It would be four stars.,1527292800,,988,4.219251336898396

8292321,1,6303549012,"This movie is amazingly hilarious. It used to be on Netflix, but I can't find it to download anywhere. I ordered this DVD because it was the best thing currently available. Unfortunately the disc seems to be faulty. Xbox won't recognize it as being a playable disc, and same goes for Windows 10. It almost seems like the disc wasn't properly finalized or something. On top of that, I noticed that the DVD case says it is fullscreen and not widescreen, so even if it was working that would be a strike against this copy of the movie.

8292327,5,6303549012,"I bought this movie off Amazon for 1 penny and it was the best penny I've ever spent.  If you love any portrayal of the rave scene, even cheesy ones, or you have the ability to find humor in things that aren't meant to be funny...then this movie is for you!

The rest of this review is for people who have seen the movie or do not mind spoilers.

First of all this movie was made in 1996 but many of the outfits suggest a time more like 1986.  Young TJ (James Marshall) who is on his road to stardom as a hot key board player has both his hands severed off in a senseless crime...truly the whole thing made no sense.  Now TJ is left with two nubs and in pent up frustration asks his girlfriend if she's interested in the ride of her life...and as hot as nub sex sounds...she declines.  He is also fitted with ridiculously cheap looking latex hands and is having trouble coping.  Upset, TJ chooses to flee home and become a soot-faced drunk bum with a mullet and he cleans car windows for booze money.  I think James Marshall, while incredibly cheesy, is an okay actor in this movie, but my gosh he plays a HORRIBLE drunk.

Anyways, now it gets interesting...
TJ, in a drunken stupor, breaks into a building, falls asleep in a cardboard box, and wakes up...IN THE MIDDLE OF A RAVE!!!

I truly do love the premise of this movie.

So Alyssa (Christina Applegate) who has chosen to now be called ""Anamika"" finds TJ takes him home and slowly but surely after a few mishaps gets him sobered up and cleaned up.  TJ's hair throughout the movie is it's own comic relief.  Even after he gets it cut it still looks ridiculous.

Anamika introduces TJ to all her 1 dimensional friends.  We have the ""ladies man"" Simeon who I think is a huge goober...and we also have the group ""geek""...who is also only called ""geek"" throughout the movie...how original.  Well, TJ gets a moment of inspiration when he sees a piano that plays itself and teams up with said geek to create some robot hands. They're huge and bulky and look like they're about to fall apart at any minute.  Not to mention someone else has to play the keyboard and then the hands are programmed to recreate it...so it's pretty much like lip-syncing but it's on a keyboard...so even though he has these robot hands...he still can not actually play the keyboard.  Just needed to get that hole in the story off my chest.  So anyways, Simeon does him a solid and helps him get a spot on ""The Rave"" as they incessantly call it....and he becomes.... CYBERSTORM!... with now a suit to match the hands. Imagine a knockoff Robocop with spirit fingers and a keyboard and you've got Cyberstorm.

So TJ and Anamika get closer and he decides it's time to profess his love. He gets her a nice love ""vibe"" going by playing the keyboard and turning on a mini laser light.  She says she has feeling for him too, so they do it.  It's the weirdest, laziest, cheesiest, love scene ever.  Wind blowing in their hair...TJ has those ridiculous robot hands on....their mouths barely moving with their tongues hanging out and touching.
Ugh. Ick.

Anywho, TJ starts to get famous and they take ""The Rave"" on the road...in a kidnapper van that has been spray painted silver and some top piece added to look like a short bus...which is fitting for them to be riding in.  He gets a gig in his home town and he creates a ruckus at his hotel room so his cop Dad answers the call.  He tells him he's sorry for leaving and all about how he's a robot now. Dads intrigued and with a chuckle and head shake says he'll be at this civic center Rave because this he ""gotta see.""

Well what do you know...TJ gets to the club and all of the bouncers standing on the front steps are the EXACT same hoodlums that severed his hands.  Huh...What a coincidence!  Well, TJ decides it's time for revenge...and he's going to beat them with....TECHNOLOGY!  He hooks up some cables and a speaker to their dressing room...orders food and beer to lure them in and then locks the door.  During his set he hits the button and a high pitched sound debilitates the bullies.  He lets it play for a while and then the kindness he sees in Anamika's face makes him pull the plug.  The door finally kicks down and they come busting out wanting revenge on TJ.  Well TJ's cop Dad is getting his Rave on out in the crowd so TJ vaguely shakes his robot hands at him and points at the guys and he...JUST KNOWS!  Father son thing I guess.  Cop Dad takes them outside for questioning. I guess he needs a little more than a hand shake to convict.  TJ and Anamika kiss and the movie ends.

Best movie ever.

As much as I make fun of this movie...I actually really really love it and it really is a great movie, just not for the conventional reasons.  I love the plot line, I love the funny clothes and hair, some of the music sucks (all the scenes with Simeon and the guy with the coolots and skinny tie) but some I really love (Fierce Ruling Diva, U96, Moses on Acid). I love that it's weird, that it's cheesy.  Everything about it is hilarious and awesome at the same time.  If you haven't seen it watch it.  If you're a fellow fan like me, then go like the Vibrations movie page on facebook ;)",1350864000,6,5173,4.355949895615867
