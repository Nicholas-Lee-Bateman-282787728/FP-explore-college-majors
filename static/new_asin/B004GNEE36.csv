8428896,5,B004GNEE36,A funny and real life take on what it takes to make a pipe band. I enjoyed the film. It's a good one.,1396828800,,101,3.4347826086956523
8428897,4,B004GNEE36,"Anyone who has ever been in a pipeband (especially a lower grade one) will appreciate this.  Plenty of instances in which to relate to.  You would have thought that the process of bringing the band together would have been more organized (which it wasn't) -- only adds to the entertainment.  Very cool the international makeup of the group with members coming in from continental Europe.  The extras are good, too, especially the clip on the prinicipal of the College of Piping.",1312761600,,478,4.864197530864198
8428898,4,B004GNEE36,"A great story of the Underdog's at the 'Worlds.'  They knew they were going in as Underdog's but held their head high.  This is very simular to 'On the Day' is some ways, and totally different in others.  It's not about a bunch of great bagpipers, but those who enjoy the music and learning the instrument themselfs.",1312588800,,316,4.508771929824562
8428899,5,B004GNEE36,"This short film documents the coming together of a student pipe band as they get the chance to compete at the World Pipe Band Championships in Glasgow, Scotland.  Pipe Major Barry Donaldson has the idea of letting these piping and drumming students get a taste of competition at the highest levels, and the road is not without its bumps.  Personality clashes and differing expectations lead to some tense times on the field, but ultimately the band members pull together at crunch time.  As a member of a Grade 5 US-based pipe band, I can identify with a lot of the situations, especially with a lack of drummers, so I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it!",1309996800,2,687,4.756302521008403
8428900,4,B004GNEE36,"""This is Spinal Tap,"" the amazing mockumentary about a rock band, came to mind as I watched this entertaining film.  Except this is a true documentary, in a mostly cinema verite style, that is about a bagpipe band.  I say 'bagpipe band' (which also includes drummers) a bit reluctantly because the musicians here are actually students attending a workshop at Glasgow's College of Piping.  Someone decided they should enter the World Pipe Band Championships which happened to be going on at the same time.  What ensues is a hysterical scramble to play together as a unit as one thing after another keeps getting in the way.  But these players are serious in what they are doing, and almost deicide to call it quits rather than go out and make fools of themselves.  However, they persevere and rise to the occasion.  You'll have to watch the film to see how they did in the Worlds.  (this reviewer is the director of ""On The Day;  The Story of the Spirit of Scotland Pipe Band,"" a feature-length documentary)",1295740800,4,1006,4.702857142857143
