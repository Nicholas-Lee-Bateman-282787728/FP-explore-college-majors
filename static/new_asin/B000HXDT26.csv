8142097,5,B000HXDT26,Fernandel is my favourite French movie actor and 'l'ennemi public numero un' is my favourite French MOVIE.,1481068800,,106,5.294117647058823
8142098,4,B000HXDT26,"This is one of the few Fernandel movies that I remember seeing many years ago. This DVD transfer is clean in both audio and video. Unfortunately, it has no subtitles, not even French ones (audio is original French, of course) - I took a star because of this. The movie is fun, but to people seeing it for the first time today, it may seem too slow. So, if you know and like the movie and are not bothered by the lack of subtitles, this is a worthy purchase. Otherwise, I would recommend L'homme a l'impermeable as a better first purchase for those that want to get acquainted with Fernandel.",1362182400,,591,4.381818181818182
