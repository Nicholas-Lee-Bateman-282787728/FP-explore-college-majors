8003876,5,B0000VV3YG,"I was pleasantly surprised by this film. Young woman starts a job teaching in a village. Although there are social realist elements, in fact, these are rich character portraits of people here. Good scenery and acting overall. It calls attention to the education problem in China; many families have to pay for books and lessons.

For another horrifying take on the problems facing children and education, see the film Blind Shaft. (detailing a young factory employed to work at the mine factory  so he can pay for his school books).

Country Teachers is more innocent and family-oriented.",1186531200,5,588,5.041237113402062
