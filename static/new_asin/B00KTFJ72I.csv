6446057,1,B00KTFJ72I,"So, the film, or should I say, low budget pretend documentary is actually set in a place that does have a history of old ghost stories surrounding it. However, this film, again, fake documentary set this thing up like it's going to be a group of guys and girls who stay at the location of an old church for a few nights to see if they can find any proof that the place is actually haunted.

What doesn't mix well is the fact that about 90% of this film is like you are watching it as a strict documentary. Then the last 10 mins throws in whatever it can to desperately lay out clearly for the audience ""Thanks for your money and time you wasted investing in our stupid fake documentary""

For one, why should anyone have to wait through an hour and whatever minutes of a movie before anything happens? If it was a real documentary, ya know, they'd pack up and have found nothing, but it's like this one, they where going that way, and thought, well how about we insult the viewers intelligence and just make the end of the film pure garbage by throwing in some fictional things here and there and some really cheap effect over there.

Basically, I'm not sure why they thought making this movie with the balance they have given between documentary and fiction would work? Either pick up the pace and bring the action in, or try to make some claims a few sounds you made on your computer where actual creepy noises you recorded out there, and then try to sucker those who beleive everything released that says ""Actual found footage"" or ""Based on a true story"" is true.

Honestly, I've seen movies like this before that got the balance right, even if they weren't great films, they did a much better job than this one. Heck, even Blair Witch did a better job than this one. Really, if you have seen ""The Last Broadcast"" you're just wasting your time watching this one that focus' more on trying to convince you the documentary is real until it slaps you in the face in the end as say's it's got two words for ya. Honestly, it's so boring. I bet every review here after mine is going to say ""Had they only made the rest of the movie like the last 10mins of the movie"" or ""Wait, so this was not a documentary, omg?"" and then a few more clearly defying that the whole thing was just a waste of time to watch.",1403395200,,2301,4.319444444444445

6446065,1,B00KTFJ72I,"Oh my goodness. Although I usually love paranormal documentaries, I must say that this was absolutely excruciating to watch, and I bailed about halfway through.  Though the investigation may have been interesting to those involved at the time, there is absolutely nothing here in their results worth publishing.  Up to and including irresponsible for the producer to actually release this, on many counts - including its cadence being slower than molasses, no measurable or notable content, and an absolute waste of the viewers time.

6446066,1,B00KTFJ72I,very slow and boring this type of movie should have been over long ago.  this is way too long and uneventful like a long episode of ghost hunters I really wanted to like this it started out ok but just kept going on and on and nothing happened.

6446068,1,B00KTFJ72I,"Starts off decent, with a premise that has potential to go somewhere. But from there it stagnates. Most of it feels like a particularly bad, stretched-out episode of Ghost Hunters. The movie suffers from three main things: a director that doesn't know how to build tension or terror, a weak story with a lot of untapped potential, and uninteresting characters that don't emote. As bad as characters in horror movies are that do nothing but scream at anything that frightens their delicate constitution, playing all your characters in the opposite direction isn't an improvement. [Minor spoiler: the film's ending is just painful to watch. It's one of the characters narrating over all of the ""action"" and feels as if the filmmakers knew they were hitting the 90 minute mark and had to rush the ending. Up until the last five minutes, I was planning on giving this movie 2/5 stars to be nice. Obviously, I changed my mind.]",1419120000,2,922,4.841772151898734

6446078,4,B00KTFJ72I,"Im not a fan of found footage movies at all. First, they give me motion sickness to the point of projectile vomiting. Secondly, it seems like a gimmick filmmakers use as a way to make a cheap movie they can market to millions and profit off. Every once in a while, one comes along and makes me second-guess my attitude towards the horror sub-genre. However, its always at home on a much smaller screen than the one found at your local multiplex.

When I received The Paranormal Diaries: Clophill in the mail, I immediately dismissed it as another Paranormal Activities wannabe. After being harassed by the movies publicist (shes great at her job) for my review, I finally gave in while expecting nothing good to come of the experience. I was very wrong in my presumption.

The Paranormal Diaries: Clophill sets just the right mood to pull people into its hysteria. What could be more frightening than an old desecrated church in the middle of nowhere rumored to be used as a location for satanic worship? Add to that a disturbing history of death and tragedy and you have a perfect foundation for ghostly sightings and supernatural disturbances. Did I mention the church is surrounded by a graveyard?

The entire movie is made up of faux interviews with researchers and eyewitnesses mixed with video footage of the investigation. Old photos documenting the history of the church and its clergy add more of a realistic flavor to it. Every actor in the film is intent on proving to the audience what they are seeing is genuine.

Only available physically on DVD, The Paranormal Diaries: Clophill provides consumers with a few special features. Cast and director commentary is included. A featurette entitled Tales from the Graveyard gives us more insight into the movie. Deleted scenes are found as well.

The Paranormal Diaries: Clophill is unrated, but would earn an R if assessed by the MPAA. Frightening images, profanity, and nudity would garner the decision. Honesty, the full frontal nudity was unnecessary and couldve been avoided. The scene pops up towards the end of the film and lasts about one minute.

Another subject I would like to address is the religious factors alluded to in The Paranormal Diaries: Clophill. Some of the concepts explored in the movie point in the right direction if you're a Christian. One guy prays for protection and another man warns against the dangers of using Ouija boards to contact the dead. He also states the difference between ghosts and demons, which many people confuse when it comes to the supernatural.

The investigators in The Paranormal Diaries: Clophill still use a Ouija board and other similar tools to contact the dead. They just hope that any doorways they open while doing so will be closed afterwards. How often does that happen? It doesnt happen very often as youll witness here.

Does The Paranormal Diaries: Clophill pull every clich&eacute; punch possible when it comes to the found footage technique of filmmaking? You bet it does and it does it darn well. Every camera angle and every sound amplified leaves the viewer in a constant state of panicked anticipation, just waiting for something to jump out at you. Its the perfect example of the cinematography technique being utilized correctly.",1413936000,3,3259,4.934306569343065
6446079,3,B00KTFJ72I,I liked the back story etc but could have done more with it.,1413676800,,60,3.6923076923076925
6446080,2,B00KTFJ72I,"Like the other reviews ""Really??? Another documentary film that has only just now released the footage?  Come on.  We have seen so many of these documentaries say that very same thing and it is all the same.  The best thing for this ""Movie"" is the previews.  I have watched a lot of good or even decent movies with this same storyline much better than this one.",1412985600,2,361,4.424242424242424
6446081,1,B00KTFJ72I,"I picked up this movie based on the cover and the blurb on the back, calling it ""bone-chilling"".  I settled in for a night of seeing a spooky, creepy film.
 Here's a rundown of the movie:  some people interview locals about a haunted abandoned church.
 Night One: nothing happens.
 Night two: nothing happens.
 In fact, aside from a few noises in the woods and a couple of garbled EVPs, nothing happens!  The blurb promised me that the paranormal team would ""unleash an ancient evil"".  The only thing that was unleashed was an hour and a half of BOREDOM!
I don't need constant action to like a movie, nor do I need blood and gore.  But what I do need is for SOMETHING to happen!
It won't.  Don't bother with this movie, unless you need a cure for insomnia.",1412726400,,756,4.413043478260869
6446082,4,B00KTFJ72I,"Finally - a decent ""ghost documentary""!!  This film, unlike it's American brethren, doesn't rely on heavy-handed, cliched CGI (like the ubiquitous and ridiculous ""droopy-scream-jaw"" that is in every horror movie today, it seems) or the ""I cant get a signal"" cell phone shtick. It relies on great backstory, convincing acting, and those scares and ghost-related instances don't have to hit you over the head, they are done convincingly and realistically. I have been so tired of writing poor reviews that this one was a pleasure to view and write about. Unlike the moronic slew of b-movies out there, like Grave Encounters, etc., or the painfully phony Ghost Hunters ""reality"" TV shows, this one is a cut above the rest.",1412640000,10,719,5.042016806722689
6446083,5,B00KTFJ72I,"This is being described as a documentary style movie, but don't let that keep you away for fear that it is boring.  Most of the movie is what I would consider more first-person film making where the action is unfolding on camera in real time and the filmmakers are involved as characters.  It is very atmospheric as it takes place around a very creepy old abandoned church and overgrown graveyard, mostly at night.  Because of the nature of the style of this movie the scares are realistic and much more creepy than a normal hollywood horror film.  Very clever buildup throughout the movie, and it gives the viewer the same emotional experience as if you were sneaking around the woods at night hearing things and wondering what's moving behind the gravestones.  Definitely worth picking up.  Made from the same dudes behind Zombie Diaries if you are familiar with that one.",1412553600,5,874,4.793333333333333
6446084,1,B00KTFJ72I,"Do not waste your money on this. It is a fake documentary that is reminiscing of the Blair Witch Project.

6446086,4,B00KTFJ72I,One of the better documentary style scare flicks.,1412294400,3,49,5.25
6446087,3,B00KTFJ72I,"Ive mentioned before how much I enjoy found-footage style horror movies, IF they are done well.  There are many of these out there, yet only a small percentage are worth watching.  A new trend is on the rise, however, a similar subgenre that is catching fire in filmmaking circles:  documentary-style horror.  This subgenre has been around for a while, but is experiencing a new surge in activity.  It is very close to found-footage, in that its shot with handheld cameras and in an on-the-fly methodhowever, the footage is not presented as discovered. THE PARANORMAL DIARIES: CLOPHILL is a recent addition to this category, and while it is not perfect, it is still a fun film that can be entertaining.

Ive seen a couple of documentary-style horror films over the years that I really enjoyed, including TROLLHUNTER.  When done right, these movies can be very engaging and even frightening.

THE PARANORMAL DIARIES: CLOPHILL has some pretty decent cinematography, especially when you consider the type of film it is.  I am particularly impressed with the lighting.  Many handheld films lack in the lighting department, and therefore the action is difficult to make out.  Not so here.  I never had a problem seeing anything onscreen.

The acting is pretty good, too.  Most of the cast portray themselves, so they are technically just pretending in a paranormal scenario.  There are no real standout performances to speak of, but they do a good job as a whole.

Unfortunately, the scares in THE PARANORMAL DIARIES: CLOPHILL never really materialize.  There are some intense scenes here and there, and the production team does a great job of building suspense, but for the most part I was left wanting more.  The concept of the Black Mass and occultists is cool (dont worryno spoilers here), however I think they should have been fleshed out more.

Still, you can certainly see the heart that was put into this film.  It is not a boring movie at all, and it plays out like an actual documentary would.  If you're looking for hard-edged horror, you will probably want to give this one a pass.  But if you're a fan of GHOST HUNTERS or shows of that nature, I would definitely give this one a look.  It is available today in a variety of formats.",1412035200,9,2240,4.806282722513089
8661356,1,B00KTFJ72I,"I bought this at a Dollar store in a generic cardboard sleeve for $2. Had I seen the actual keep case proudly proclaiming the film to be from the makers of THE ZOMBIE DIARIES I would have put it back pretty quickly. This is one of those countless ghost investigation documentaries where the viewer mainly gets to watch the investigators faces through green night vision filters and little else. How can we see any spooks if we are locked into watching the investigators?
  The film started somewhat promisingly with some moody shots of the ruins at St. Mary's church at Clophill. Also there is some background info on the church, including stories of devil worship and such. This covers about the first 20-30 minutes of the running time. Unfortunately, after that the movie shifts into paint-drying mode.
  There were two alleged manifestations in DIARIES. The first one is somewhat believable, as a faint figure seems to walk from center frame toward the right, and the filmmakers back the film up and show us again with a bold arrow pointing to the figure. Much later in the film there is a white spectral head that looks like low grade CGI, emerging from bushes in the background. It looks like a rather bland statue with a couple black shadows obscuring parts of the face. It was all I could do to restrain myself from calling out ""Buuwaa-ha-haaa!"" Then the film's speedometer drops back to zero again.
  THE  PARANORMAL DIARIES: CLOPHILL is a prime example of why I prefer the paranormal documentary format that alternates eyewitness interviews with reenactments. They are more emotionally engaging. If the reenactments have good FX, they are creepy. If the FX weren't up to standard, at least nobody is trying to convince you that something shoddy looking is real.
  If you are curious about paranormal occurrences at Clophill, your time would be better spent checking out some of the ghost oriented websites or checking the Clophill videos on YouTube.",1486339200,,1958,4.891238670694864
8661357,5,B00KTFJ72I,Really enjoyed it! Done like a documentary it relies more on atmosphere and location to provide a sense of subtle uneasiness.
