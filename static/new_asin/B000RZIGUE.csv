2876891,4,B000RZIGUE,"I'm not normally a big fan of collections or boxed sets ... preferring to buy each feature individually. Many times a collection has one or two good titles and the rest is filler.

So why am I going against the grain here and giving this a favorable rating? Especially since I haven't seen ""The Golden Years"" yet?

Because two of the included features are worth the price of the set. ""The Stand"" is arguably the best SK novel and probably one of the closest (to the novel) transfers to the TV screen. The plot hinges on a biological warfare mishap in which most of the human race is wiped out by ""Captain Trips"", a.k.a. the superflu. In the aftermath, two groups form, one following Mother Abigail as the disciples of the faithful; and one group following the ""Walking Dude"" as a representative of the darker powers (hell is never mentioned although the parallel is plain enough). Character development is well done, although not as complete as in the novel (go figure) and is primarily restricted to Mother Abigail's group. It is, however, more than we usually get in a novel to movie transfer. The story, while four hours long, needs every minute to guide us on what makes each person tick ... and it does this extremely well. Horror scenes, Stephan King style, are abundantly present and are well done cinematically. King has a gift of taking ordinary circumstances and twisting them into outlandish, dreadful nightmares.

The second film, ""The Langoliers"", is cast in more of a sci-fi vein; albeit with the usual SK treatment of uncovering the darker side of human nature. The story revolves around a typical airline flight from Los Angels to Boston which literally flies `out of time' and `loses' everyone who was not asleep at the time of the event. Good thing there was a pilot napping as a passenger, eh?

What happens to the light in a room when you turn off the switch? This movie explores that question. What DOES happen to the past? According to one of the character's father (Craig Toomey), it is eaten by the langoliers .... Beings which devour the inactive and useless in the world. These creatures look like large copies of Pacman with razor sharp teeth.  As the plane flies along and eventually lands, we see that the pace of the past winds down and eventually stops. The past is unpopulated by people, leading us to beleive that people march with time and have no presence in the past. Matches don't light or will only fizzle, fuel does not burn and beer is flat straight out of the bottle. The past sorta coasts along by momentum until it finally comes to a complete stop ... at which point the langoliers come in to erase it. Craig was always threatened by his ""go getter"" of a father that lazy, useless boys are eaten by the langoliers. Now the threat comes to life for the passengers from the plane as the munching sound gets closer and closer. Again, this is a very entertaining film well worth watching.

Going by the reviews of others, ""The Golden Years"" falls flat. Haven't seen this one for myself, so I'll have to pass on judgement. Read the other reviews and make your own determination.

Bottom line is that for a reasonable price, there are at least two SK winners - and possibly a third (reviews are, after all, just opinions). I would say that this is a worthwhile purchase and will provide hours of entertainment.

As word to the wise - ""The Langoliers"" is probably not a movie for younger kids (under the age of 10) unless you want to stay up with them for several sleepless nights. Younger ones probably won't understand ""The Stand"", but some of the scenes will shock and scare them. You might want to view these films yourself first before letting your kids sit in on a family room viewing.

Cheerfully Recommended.

2876892,1,B000RZIGUE,"I order the Stephen King Gift Set for Christmas event, It is a brand new DVD package but when starting to play the DVDs, I discovered that:
The ""Langolier"" suppose to have 1 DVD : OK
The ""Stand"" suppose to have 2 DVDs: I have an extra DVD Stand part 2!!
The ""Golden Years"" suppose to have 2 DVD: I have only Part 1 !!
It is a very disappointed Christmas Gift but it is not Stephen King fault.
Is it a defect of this particular package?

Can Amazon fix this problem fast enough for Xmas? I hope they will send me the missing DVD as fast as they can.",1198368000,,548,3.981818181818182
2876893,5,B000RZIGUE,"With over 105 Stephen King adaptations - and sequels - currently avaiable or in production, there are going to be more than just a few that are of a poor standard --- it's just the law of averages.  But value-for-money when it comes to the approximate running length of a King movie is always gauranteed [and taking into account the average novel or novella written by King, these still are not long enough to encompass the entire work].

This box set is no exception to the rule of King.

On offer here are three mini-series in one box set, the running time comprising of roughly 40 hours [broken down: The Stand(6 hrs), The Golden Years (5 Hours) and The Langoliers (3 hrs). Enough entertainment to keep the average horror fan entertained for days. Or is there?

I think there is here.

Let's begin with the strongest movie first, 'The Stand'. Based on King's best-selling apocalyptic epic novel, this movie stays as close the novel as possible. Directed by Mick Garris [Riding the Bullet], the movie has a talented and well-chosen cast, including Rob Lowe [Salem's Lot TV], Molly Ringwald, Ed Harris [Needful Things; The Creepshow] and Gary Sinise. A man-made virus has wiped out the population of America, except for two surviving groups: those who follow Mother Abigail, a servant of God and those who follow Randall Flagg, suggested here as being the Devil. The movie tracks each character in detail right through to the climactic finale. 'The Stand' successfully portrays a world on the brink of ruin, conveying each individual surviving character's battle with their newfound circumstances; their inner fight between the forces of good and evil. Apart for 'Stand By Me' and 'Shawshank Redemption' this is probably the finest adaptation of a King novel.

'The Langoliers' tells of an airliner that has flown through the Aurora Borealis [the Northern Lights] --- those left on the plane are the passengers who, at the time, were asleep. But now the population of America has apparently vanished --- there is no air traffic and the airports are deserted. As with all King stories, there are strong and believable characters who struggle to understand - and survive in - a complex and horrific situation, character development being a particular strong point of this author. Creepy and tense throughout, this film never fails to entertain those who enjoy the mysterious in life.

Probably the weakest of the three is 'The Langoliers'. This is the tale of retired ex-guard, Harlan Williams, who once worked at a secluded scientific research center. Returning one day, he is caught up in an explosion and is contaminated. His ageing process is subsequently reversed. Understandably curious, the government workers begin a man hunt in order to discover the secret to eternal youth. The film is a well-made sci-fi-horror with a strong cast headed by Ed Lauter [Cujo].

The Stephen King Gift Set is excellent value for money, considering these movies retail at high prices individually.",1195171200,2,2985,5.004032258064516
2876894,4,B000RZIGUE,"Just getting The Stand at this price was a bargain compared to the other prices.  I had worn out my VHS tape long ago and The Stand has always been my favorite book by King.  The Langoliers is a pretty good movie, too, so that was enjoyable.  The Golden Years, however, has got to be the worst movie I have seen in a long time!  The acting and lines were terrible. The only parts I liked were when the janitor was in them.  The movie was so bad that it became a mission just to get through the entire four (~!!!) hours of it.  I have never read the book so if it is as half as bad as the movie, I'll pass.  But even so, it is still an excellent bargain.",1194739200,16,653,3.9015151515151514

I got this DVD set because people were greedy and the single movie DVD set was way too much for it, this was close to their price new and had three movies. Damn, a better deal because I get the joy of having not one cheesy Stephen King adapted TV movies but two (I had never seen the Golden Years and still have yet to see it).

These are probably not the best movies base on books by King, but they are good for laughs. Most of these people have entered the ""where are they now?"" bin of our minds, but the movies are worth the price.",1193702400,2,683,3.8785714285714286

2876930,5,B000RZIGUE,"The Langoliers was good, but I am still wondering why the Langoliers (which were only Pac-men with teeth) still devoured everything in sight and only in Maine.  The Stand was difficult to connect the dots as some of the dots seemed to be missing. I didn't see this on T.V. (of which I am happy, as it would have been boring with the commercials), so I don't know if they dropped some scenes or this was just lousy directing.  The sound track in the first section was horrible and the piano 'player' on the third section should have been shot to ease his pain.  This movie is about Good and evil, except that in our real world,  God""s way to end evil will be a whole lot worse for mankind if we don't repent, starting with that dicator in the White House.  Golden Years (about a man that is getting younger) was very enjoyable, but sadly, parts of it could be too true with all of the radical people that have fire-arms and power and the government that is now in control.  None of these movies are for the young and with Stephen King, you will never know who he will eliminate.  Buyers beware:  you need a DVD PLAYER to watch these as they might not play on a recordable unit or computers.  +JMJ+",1379548800,2,1196,4.303571428571429

2876944,5,B000RZIGUE,"If you love all things Stephen King including his miniseries you'll love this set. At roughly $10.00 and some change per miniseries you get:

The Stand - the made-for-TV miniseries about one of King's most famous novels. This one is a classic Good versus Evil or should I say God versus Devil crossed with the whole end of the world thanks to our military and government trying to play their own version of God. It remained fairly true to the book and most of the actors played their parts perfectly with the exception, at least for me, of Molly Ringwald being Frannie. I had a bit of a hard time wrapping my wits around that one, because Frannie in the book is your more classically beautiful, kickbutt redhead and Molly Ringwald was just a little too young and fragile to really make me believe she was indeed Frannie, a woman who in the book I really admired. And what was with the black bob hairstyle? But other than that everyone else was pretty much looked and sounded the way I'd always imagined them from the book. The actor who played Randall Flagg especially, he absolutely nailed the gleeful insanity of a man who isn't, well really a man at all.

The Langoliers - I saw this one TV years ago and fell in love with it. It's stands out to me as one of the few times I've ever seen a written story nearly perfectly duplicated on film. The original novella is from King's book of stories ""Four Past Midnight."" In this story a small group of ten people wake up during a night-time flight to Boston to discover they seem to be the only ones left on the plane, now being flown only on autopilot. Even weirder are the objects they find left behind by the other passengers--anything non-organic to be specific including jewelry, coins, pacemakers, dental bridges and yes even a wig. The mystery of where they are and what happened to everyone else is one of King's more riveting and well-done mysteries with a sci-fi twist to it.

Golden Years - I'd never seen this miniseries and King actually wrote it specifically for TV as a miniseries, meaning it
and I'd never heard Golden Years, but love it in spite of itself. It has a few minor plot holes and the acting is honestly not the greatest, but keep in mind that a) this is a miniseries from 1991, so everything looks very dated because honestly it is and b) the acting feels way overdone, because it is somewhat in the style of TV shows during that period. If you watch other TV shows in that time period you'll see what I mean. The story itself, as with all things King, involves an unlikely group of people drawn together in the fight between right and wrong. This time an elderly janitor and his wife find themselves the target of a ruthless government agency after an accident at work exposes the old man to a substance that may just be a genuine fountain of youth. There's plenty of fun with a classic mad scientist, several military types who take themselves way too seriously, a rather interesting young woman who once worked for The Shop aka CIA and a ruthless government assassin who really does look like the kind of guy you'd roll your windows up and lock your doors if he walked over to your vehicle. Throw in a sci-fi twist and it's all good fun, SK style.

Each miniseries comes to about $10.00 and some change, the DVDs played perfectly and take up very little space as they all come in one slim case. And they all have subtitles, which my sometimes hard-of-hearing hubby really appreciates. This set now has a permanent residence next to my Kingdom Hospital and The Shining miniseries and all I can do is pray there will be more miniseries in the future. Like The Dark Tower series and definitely Eye Of The Dragon--hint, hint.",1358380800,4,3699,4.5

Golden Years was a little surprise.  It reminds me of a 50's science fiction movie, including synthesized music at the right places near the beginning.

2876967,5,B000RZIGUE,"SUCH VALUE!

I went and tried to find The Stand but could not because it is currently out of print. Then I found this set and saw what it ran here and thought this is great. I saw it in another place and the retail on it is a lot more, making me think this is a steal. I really couldn't be happier.

(talking about all but the Golden Years)
In the three movies, you have some of the same types of thread. In the Langoliers, you meet a plane filled with people who are on their way to - whereever. They fall asleep, and when they awaken they are on a plane by themselves. They think it is odd at first, and then find it odder that there are pieces of jewelry and pieces of artifical implants that people seem to have lost. This leads to some even more bizarre disclosures as they find an abandoned airport and notice the sound, the chewing sound, closing in on the horizon.

In The Stand, we begin with a man trying to get his family out of the middle of a government facility. He gets out, and he helps a passenger get out as well that goes by Captain Tripps. The captain spreads quickly, and people seem to be on the brink of doom. Then comes Flagg, something not human, and his calling that brings people to Vegas. Others here someone different, and they go to Colorado. As they rebuild, they find themselves confronted with not only life and death, but with the thing that will decide what happens to us all. A call to Stand, as it were, and fight for everything.

The Golden Years is another one of the end of the world scenarios, and it is good. I liked it and I liked the casting, not to mention the production value. The editorial does it justice, and it is the second longest piece in the set. Consdiering we are talking about ten hours plus for this set, we are talking a good value. Plus you get The Stand, one of the best made-for-TV movies I have ever seen (and one of the most expensive).

If you have yet to get these, you should. They goout of print quickly, and are well worth watching. As a whole I rate this a 5 star, and opinions differ on what it rates as shows. Regardless, you get a lot for your money and the casting and execution of the shows is not at all bad.",1295049600,,2185,4.156028368794326

2876971,2,B000RZIGUE,"For people who really enjoy sound, the film series The Stand had some of the finest music of any mini-series and was better than most feature films. I love listening to this musical work of art by WG Snuffy Warren. Unfortunately in this boxed set, not only is the presentation NOT in Widescreen (no big deal for me), but more importantly the fine score and dialogue is NOT in stereo. There are two identical channels of audio that are only slightly widened (about 5 degrees). Each of the tracks contains the identical content so in effect it is a ""slightly spread"" mono soundtrack, which loses all the grandeur and impact of the original stereo soundtrack. A big disappointment. Both channels have been checked in my recording studio and they are identical. Even the SciFi channel's presentation of this mini-series had the authentic stereo tracks. In this mono version the dialogue steps on the music severely, as it loses its ""place"" in the presentation causing a significant loss of impact the original score provided. My VHS versions of this fine program are in true stereo and I can think of no reason this mono version was ever produced. The audio in the Langoliers is shifted left with barely any right channel at all. So much so it is difficult to tell if that one is stereo as well. And the Golden Years was destined to become a frisbee from the beginning. The video quality is great but the audio is an unnecessarily losing proposition. I'm sending it back.

The ""Langoliers"" is also good.
I also enjoyed the ""Golden Years"" when it originally aired on tv.

2876991,4,B000RZIGUE,"The reason I purchased this set was purely for ""The Stand,"" a classic tale of good versus evil with some very good acting by a few well-known names. Admittedly, there is some very poor acting as well (most notably by the author himself); but the story is so good, that one can easily overlook the minor glitches as he enjoys the substance of the story. There are great characters, with whom you will fall in love or perhaps you will love to hate. It's just a fantastic story, in my humble opinion.

As an aside, I was very disappointed by the quality of Disc 1, which plays like a cartoon for some reason, and it became quite distracting. Thankfully, Disc 2 had no such problems.

""The Langoliers"" was an enjoyable read, and I liked the movie as well. Truth be told, I haven't yet taken the time to watch ""Golden Years,"" so I cannot comment on the movie itself.

2877005,4,B000RZIGUE,"If you haven't seen The Stand, the King miniseries that was originally televised in 1994, then this DVD set is worth your price of admission.  Unfortunately, The Stand is no longer being sold on its own (it is actually out of print for some ridiculous reason), so when my husband came to Amazon to buy me the DVD to replace the VHS that I had originally taped directly off of the television, he was forced to purchase this set.  I have broken down each of the offerings in this gift set below.

1) The Stand.  This 4-part series was amazingly well-done for a TV miniseries, perhaps because the teleplay was written by Stephen King himself.  It is supremely well-cast, starring Gary Sinise (just before he hit it big in Forrest Gump), a comeback role for Rob Lowe, and excellent supporting performances by Bill Faberbakke (of Coach fame), Miguel Ferrer, and Jamey Sheridan as the Dark Man himself.  (Notice that I didn't mention Molly Ringwald; for me, having her play Frannie was the movie's one misfire.)  The movie stays fairly close to King's beloved novel, from the initial devastation to the stunning conclusion.  Grade: A

2) The Langoliers.  This TV movie, which aired in 1995, was based on a novella by the same name that was originally published in King's book Four Past Midnight.  The story itself is interesting and involves time--basically, what happens to yesterday once we move on?  Unfortunately, the concept is simply not well-executed here.  The presence of various name actors--Patricia Wettig of Thirty Something, Dean Stockwell of Quantum Leap, Bronson Pinchot of Perfect Strangers, and David Morse, who went on to star in King's The Green Mile--are not enough to overcome the cheesy dialogue and overly contrived scenes.  Plus, there are small things that are simply done poorly:  at one point, a character is mortally wounded, and not only does the blood remain on that person's lips for hours (i.e, no one has the decency to simply wipe it off?) but also it remains a wet, bright red color rather than drying naturally.  This movie is watchable, although just barely.  Grade: C

3) Golden Years.  This series was written by King (and others) originally for television, and it was first broadcast during the summer of 1991.  It is about four hours long on two discs, although it originally aired as seven individual ""episodes.""  The basic premise here is that an explosion in a top-secret laboratory exposes an old janitor to some unknown, experimental chemicals.  In addition to the old man, the characters include his confused wife (it seems that her every other line is ""I don't understand""), a mad scientist, and a psychopathic killer from ""the shop"" (a.k.a. the CIA).  Neither Oscar-nominated actress Felicity Huffmann, playing the head of security at the plant, or excellent character actor Stephen Root (from Office Space) can save this dull mess.  The story is overly drawn-out, and the majority of the plot is predictable--that is, with the exception of the ending, which just sort of occurs without ever explaining anything that happened.  Grade: D

Despite the fact that The Stand is the only decent offering in this set, I am still tempted to give it 5-stars, as I think The Stand alone is worthy of that rating.  However, I would have much preferred to buy The Stand as a stand-alone (no pun intended!) DVD, so I just can't give this set 5 stars, as the price is rather high to pay for The Stand alone.  Furthermore, NONE of the features on this set offer any DVD extras, which was a bit of a disappointment.  Still, I am glad to be able to finally own The Stand on DVD and would definitely recommend this set for that reason alone.",1263427200,8,3667,4.803827751196172

Las Vegas takes the true title of Sin City in this book and goes up against Boulder as the representation of all the good people. Usually King's books do not translate well into movies, but this one does.

The Stand is awesome story telling, beginning with the initial breakout of a deadly virus (with Blue Oyster Cult's ""The Reaper"" playing in the background) all the way through to the climatic final, some six hours later. There is a religious undertone that ties the storyline together sort of as a motif, but The Stand is so worth watching that one can easily ignore the otherwise arrogant subtleness.

My wife, on the other hand, lives and breathes this stuff!  She's always been that way since a little girl getting into Star Trek, Star Wars, and since it came to cable television--EVERYTHING on the Sci-Fi Channel!  AAAAACK!  She's a bona fide NUT for these kinds of things and Stephen King movies are at the top of her wish list of DVDs she wants.

So we've been slowly getting 'em all one-by-one here and there while I secretly wish he'd stop making movies out of his books.  :P  I was browsing around Amazon one day and came across this trifecta of King classics.  I had heard of ""The Langoliers"" and ""The Stand,"" but I'd never heard of ""Golden Years.""  What a surprise this would be for my sweetie!

It was so funny when the next day my wife came screaming into my home office and said, ""Honey, you're never gonna believe this, I just found three more Stephen King movies!""  Playing dumb, I replied, ""Oh yeah, which ones?""  Then she named all the movies in this set.  I sheepishly replied, ""Did you get 'em all together in one package for a pretty good price?""  The look back was memorable because she realized I had already ordered it for her.  No doghouse for me that night!  :D

If you're a Stephen King/sci-fi/horror fan, then GET THIS SET!  ""Golden Years"" is more obscure than the others, but my wife LOVED it, too!  It's very affordable when they get sets like these together for one price.  Maybe one day somebody will get real ambitious and put together the quintessential Stephen King collection with ALL of his movies in one package.  Oh, wait a minute, we almost have that NOW!  HA!  ENJOY!",1211587200,2,1869,4.474777448071217

2877039,4,B000RZIGUE,"I loved THE STAND.  It's one of my all time favorite movies anyway.  I had recently read the book THE LANGOLIERS.  Of course, while no movie can be as descriptive as one of King's books, I thought the movie was enjoyable.  My daughter liked the Golden Years, but it was a bit too slow for me.  I was yawning within the first 10 minutes of the movie and found it difficult to attend to it.  But, the service by Amazon was good.  The movie set came a few days earlier than expected.  Overall, we were pleased with the purchase.",1203033600,,525,4.232323232323233

2877042,5,B000RZIGUE,"As the owner of every book ever written by Stephen King, to include his non-fiction, the videos are a logical next step. The Stand is good video adaptation of one of his best novels. The other two are snoozers, make popcorn and watch them when the weather sucks.",1199664000,,262,4.479166666666667
2877043,4,B000RZIGUE,"I have not yet bought this. I had The Stand DVD, but it got borrowed and not returned. I have seen all of these movies/mini-series and love The Stand. Can't 'Stand' ;) The Langoliers; boy is it cheesy with all those little critters eating existence. But I, also, really enjoyed The Golden Years when it played on TV. I especially liked the song. I look forward to seeing The Golden Years again.

It's a shame it can't be remastered to widescreen, though. And the picture clarity isn't as good as normal DVD. But it's still good to have two of these three series on DVD.",1198627200,,569,4.419047619047619

8203232,5,B000RZIGUE,"The Stand is great to watch and read. In addition to the DVD Ive got the hardcover version, which Ive read in between viewings of The Stand. Five star book and a five star TV miniseries.

The TV versions of The Langoliers and Golden Years aren't as good, 4 and 3 stars, respectively, and don't rate repeat viewings. Theres a lot better sci-fi and fantasy TV out there to see. Ive got two Under the Dome books on my shelf, which I haven't read. After I read them Ill binge watch the show, which I haven't seen yet.

I haven't seen any of the movies or TV series from the following book series, but I did read the first books, Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone, Twilight, Outlander, Fifty Shades of Grey, The Long Earth, Divergent, etc. I sample a lot of first books, but I don't read many complete series. (Who has that much time?) The Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins, and The Song of Ice and Fire (Game of Thrones) series by George Martin are a couple of exceptions.

Ive read both of those series more than once. Both are five star. The first three books in The Song of Ice and Fire series are the best. The Game of Thrones TV series is also five star. The first two Hunger Games movies are five star, but then they got greedy and tried to make two movies out of the Mockingjay book when there was barely enough source material there for one movie. The first two books in The Hunger Games trilogy are better than third book, Mockingjay, and the first two movies, The Hunger Games and Catching Fire, are better than the two Mockingjay movies.

Starship Troopers (1959) (not like the movie) by Robert A. Heinlein is the book that got me started in sci-fi adventures, and has remained one of my top five favorite military science fiction adventure stories for decades. The Forever War (1974) by Joe Haldeman, Armor (1984) by John Steakley, Enders Game (1985) by Orson Scott Card and Old Mans War (2005) by John Scalzi, round out my top five military sci-fi adventure stories.

If you like any of the above you might also like Jack Campbells The Lost Fleet series, Taylor Andersons Destroyermen series, Andre Nortons Star Soldiers, Andy Weirs The Martian, or Frank Herberts Dune. Other sci-fi and fantasy authors I like include Douglas Adams, Isaac Asimov, Paolo Bacigalupi, Arthur C. Clarke, Earnest Cline, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Terry Goodkind, Hugh Howey, Robert Jordan, George Martin, Larry Niven, Patrick Rothfuss, Brandon Sanderson and J.R.R. Tolkien.",1490918400,,2474,4.67816091954023
