8482960,5,B000FVQLTI,"Not to ruffle Mr. Veblen's feathers, but isn't ridin', jumpin', shootin', fightin' and fussin' what its all about? These were kid westerns with everything it took to keep a kid on the edge of his seat for a half hour. Jock Mahony was not a great actor, but he sure could hold his own with the other tv western stars of that day and age.
These episodes are wholesome, exciting and deserve to be watched.",1240963200,3,402,4.373333333333333
8482961,2,B000FVQLTI,Not bad series for kids.  Jock Mahoney is athletic but riding and jumping carry an actor only so far.  Every episode seems to be a variation on a single plot.,1178928000,,158,4.233333333333333
