1371068,4,B00004Y573,"i found this is a store and just HAD to buy it. it was worth it too. this is a great movie for anyone out there who's seen the 1st series. just when you think everything is resolved and miaka and tamahome are gonna live happily ever after, something new happens. the only reason that i gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because of two scenes. the first might not be good for little kids (but then again, there were scenes in the original FY series that might not have been good for little kids...) and also because of a scene where... well, i REALLY don't want to give anything away but some bad stuff happens to my favorite character (well, let's see here, who could that be?). let me just say that this is a great movie and well worth any amount of money.",981158400,3,757,4.156462585034014
1371069,4,B00004Y573,"I had heard so much about the OAVs and was so dissapointed by only being able to read about them online... Then I found this video!  The rumors about it being confusing were quite true, but this is due to the fact that there are 2 OAVs. Because the manga (~comic book) and the viedeos ended differently, when they made the video of the 2nd part of FY manga (the 2nd OAV) it didn't really make sense so they added this OAV in as a filler. So although it is confusing, it soon makes sense and sets the scene with our favorite characters and the age old question of if Miaka and Tamahome can be together.  What i love about this video is that however shocking or sad an episode might be, after contidued a very funny side story! All in all, if you are a FY fan (especially you jade) you have to get this and the even better parts that follow!",978739200,,839,4.141104294478527
1371070,2,B00004Y573,"It was great to see more FY!  And everyone was very true to form.  As always, the question of Tamahome and Miaka being allowed to stay together is on everyone's minds.  (I thought that was already answered!) The omake theater at the end of each episode is a lot of fun.  But it seemed like there was a very long story arc squished into just a few episodes.  Unless you're desparate, be patient for the manga to be translated!  It is coming--slowly but surely.",976060800,,459,4.404761904761905
1371071,5,B00004Y573,"This is the first of I think two OVA's. Anyway, it is based around the first miko(pristess) vanishing and a fith miko is to replace her. I won't  give away any spoiler though (^.~). As, for the movie it is basic FY tape;  Mystery, Romance, Comedy and my favorite character Chichiri. The reason for  the title is they have little none chibified second parts. They themselve  are good to get this tape. It is a must for any FY fan.( Gee, I just wrote  a very over used statment.) But, hey you don't have to take my word for it.",968457600,8,525,4.21
1371072,5,B00004Y573,"The first episode on this tape is extremely sad. You see a side of  Tamahome that you knew existed, but never seen before. This was one of the  best episodes I've ever seen. I didn't care for the Digest that came after  the first episode, so I fast-forwarded through most of it. I suppose the  digest would be good for someone who is new to the series or did not start  from the beginning. I really liked the character descriptions, but it would  have been nice if it was in English. For those of you who don't like  Nuriko, I guarantee you will change your opinion of him after watching this  tape.",964569600,4,599,4.285714285714286
1371083,3,B00004Y573,"Fushigi Yuugi is a great series whether you're into ""shoujo"" anime or not. It has a little bit of everything: martial arts, true love, humor, drama, magic and mayhem; the list goes on and on. This particular version of the complete box set isn't as ""pretty"" (it lacks the metallic gold dragon and phoenix motifs of its more expensive counterpart, and the pictures on the DVD covers are a tiny bit dark and fuzzy-looking), but if all you really want is a set of working DVDs with all the episodes plus the OVAs, then this will suit your needs just fine.

A word to the wise, this set is older as far as DVD technology goes, so it might not look as great on a big, HD screen as newer DVDs do, but the subtitles are clear and readable, and the picture quality is decent. I would suggest watching these DVDs on a smaller screen, possibly on a lower brightness level (if you're watching on your computer).

All in all, this set is what I like to call ""the poor-man's box set,"" because it's relatively cheaper than other sets, and it's great if you aren't fussy about the way the box/covers look. Worth it? That's up to you, but don't overlook it just because it's not as beautiful.",1313193600,7,1176,4.389908256880734
1371084,4,B00004Y573,It came new. Only problem was that the discs were not properly in the case when opened and some ended up scratched on the back. So far the ones I've watched that were scratched are still working properly.,1304726400,,204,4.394736842105263
1371085,5,B00004Y573,the product i got came in a timely manner and everything is good. i like this series and saw some of it a long time ago. it is a little older but it is good. Kind of hard to find so i was glad to get it.,1303084800,,203,3.3404255319148937
1371086,5,B00004Y573,"I love this product, the series of Fushigi Yugi is wonderful!! I have been looking for the compleate series for along time and this was the first time in a year i found it for a price i was willing to pay.  Not only was it a wonderful series and a great price but, it was sent to me very promptly.  Even with all the snow i recieved it in a such a short amount of time.  I am very pleased with my purchase.",1300838400,,406,3.8095238095238093
1371087,1,B00004Y573,"First off, this review will not be about the story itself.  I wasn't sure what I was going to get at the time of purchase, so I will give some details of what I think would of helped me.  I would give it a 5/5 star rating based on the story of the TV series.  The main important thing I notice was the set is not from Geneon [Pioneer], but the distributor is labeled as ""fx"".  The title also differ slightly.  You will notice that the Geneon release the title as ""Fushigi Ygi"" and this title is ""Fushigi Yuugi.""  With that said, don't expect any of the extra DVD stuff such as the art book or DVD specials.  The set is the complete series and comes with the following:

- Cardboard Art Case to hold the set
- Fushigi Yuugi: Suzaku DVD Set 1 (ep. 01-26)
- Fushigi Yuugi: Seiryu DVD Set 2 (ep. 27-52)
- Fushigi Yuugi Oni (OVA?)(9 eps) + Eikoden (4 eps)

The 3 part set comes in 3 standard size 14mm DVD case for each set and the disc are stack on top of each other.  The first 2 DVD set (Suzaku + Seiryu) comes with 3 disc each and the last set (OVA + Eikoden) comes in a 2 disc set.  The quality of the DVD insert is not so great, but the artwork on the DVD itself is fairly nice.  The picture quality of the show is pretty good, but I can't say it is great compared to today quality DVD standards.  If I were to compared it to other Anime DVD titles I seen from the late 90s to early 2000, I personally can't tell much of a difference in quality.  I have not seen the Geneon release of the Fushigi Yugi DVD, just the VHS, so I can't make a direct comparison.  It comes with English and Japanese dialogue with English subtitle.

Update: This is a bootleg product.  Media Blaster looks like they have the official license for this show now and seems like it will be released in April 2012.",1300147200,33,1787,4.074498567335244
1371088,5,B00004Y573,"To purchase one season, it would only be a little more than this for all of them. The anime is worth it, at least to me, but to have an option available like this is excellent.",1272153600,5,176,3.9166666666666665
1371089,5,B00004Y573,"If you are a anime collector and love female protagonist this anime is for you. It has sad times and funny times. Its about two girls that get sucked into a ancient book. In the country there are four main kingdoms all gaurded by a dieties. The ancient scrolls from each kingdom tells how the miko of the diety will come and take in the diety (she has to be a virgin) its like sex but alot different the diety which are males go into the miko's body and gives her three wishes to grant for herself or for the kingdom. The main character and her friend are both mikos for two different kingdoms and its a race to get all their diciples together to summon their individual diety. It has alot of love, jealousy, and trickery. If by chance the miko loses her virginity she can't summon the diety and they will get warped out. If your not a fan of sappy love stories then don't get it. Haven't watched the OVAs yet but I can pretty much realize what they are going to be about. They are just extended life the what happens after.",1234828800,3,1024,4.229591836734694
1371090,4,B00004Y573,"Plot: (tiny spolier warning if you haven't seen the whole FY TV series) Miaka, now in High School, and Taka (Tamahome) have been living peacefully in Tokyo when one day Taka disappears, drawn back into ""The Universe of the Four Gods"", where he is tricked into believing he's Nakago. Things progress from there and Miaka has to go back into the book, gather the Suzaku seven, and defeat some more villains. All the while Taka has to come to grips with who he really is, Taka or Tamahome? Character or real person?
My thoughts: Some aspects are good, some not so good. The issues that Taka has to deal with is probably accurate for what he would have been through. It's darker than the TV show, more of a drama than a comedy, but it's not bad. There are these really funny ""Bus Trip"" extras stuff, and some outtakes.
A must see for Fushigi Yugi fans. I wouldn't recommend watching it until you've seen the whole FY TV series.",1037577600,,923,4.4674556213017755
1371091,5,B00004Y573,"I don't know why they don't sell the subtitled version here,but oh well. I watched the sub version and loved it. I admit that the story was a bit intense and kind of depressing, with only a few comic moments, but it was interesting, and the break cartoons inbetween each episode,(Journey to the Forbidden Women's Hot Spring), staring the FY characters, was hillarious and a great breather from the somber mood that the episodes often had. It's recommendation is for sixteen and up, and I agree with that since there is some mild nudity in the second episode. But I would definately buy it if you are a FY fan!",998179200,,609,4.545454545454546
1371092,4,B00004Y573,"This is the first volume including the 3 episodes of OAV 1.  The next 2 volumes include 6 episodes from the OAV 2.  These OAVs continue from the ending of the TV series so obviously don't watch these until you have seen the TV series first because it will spoil parts of the story.
I must say that the OAVs did not impress me as much as the TV series did.  Well, with only a total of 9 episodes, how much can be said?
This OAV talks of the new life of Miaka and Yui.  With circumstances not under their control they must return into the Universe of the Four Gods once again.
The animation quality is more mature than the TV series.  Throughout the 9 episodes, they actually show some nudity so this may not be appropriate for younger viewers of the series.  If you are a fan of the TV series, definately get this.  I don't think anything I say will affect you not checking it out for yourself :)
Finally at the end of each episode they include these special mini-featurettes.  In the first OAV they have this trip to the hotsprings where it's just pure comedy and laughter!  Second OAV includes outtakes from the scenes that are sometimes funny but some I didn't understand too well.
Final note:  Great TV series, okay OAV.  Seemed too rushed in the OAV trying to tell bigger stories in too little time is a problem of magnitude.  Another example of this: Escaflowne the Movie - A Girl in Gaea.",983404800,6,1394,4.33976833976834

7926625,4,B00004Y573,Fantastic show loved it. It skipped a little bit in a couple of places. Packaging super crappy. Showed up on time. Skipping didn't miss any of the show though so worked for me. Maybe someone else has a better set to sell than i got though,1390780800,,238,4.195652173913044
