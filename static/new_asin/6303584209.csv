7852758,5,6303584209,"As a middle school history teacher, I found the information in this DVD interesting enough to hold my students attention and that in itself made the purchase of this disk worthwhile.  In addition, I liked the fact that the disk was divided into two 50 minute segments which made it easy to fit into a class period.  Last but not least, I felt the ending comments where very appropriated and left a very positive impression of my students.",1367625600,3,438,4.602564102564102

7852760,5,6303584209,"I have always been a history buff. This period (Civil War Era) in particular. Thus, I read and/or watch EVERYTHING I can get my hands on pertaining to the subject. This 2-video documenary is by FAR the most informative program I've watched in relation to the murder of our 16th President.

The first tape pretty much sets the stage, Introducing the ""cast of characters"". Explaining the emotions of the time. It shows John Wilkes Booth was not simply ""some crazy actor"", as he is generally portrayed. He was not insane. Passionate, and VERY dramatic (he was a well-known actor,after all!) Hot-tempered and irrational. All the above. But not insane.

Anyway, the first tape details his original plan to capture Lincoln in order to bargain for the release of Confedarate prisoners. Well the war ended, And Lincoln announced he would free the slaves. This infuriates Booth. (""By God, I'll put him through!"")The tape ends in Ford's Theater with Booth pulling the trigger....

Now, the second tape is where the ""meat"" is. It details the carnage in the theater as Booth makes his exit, breaking his ankle,(Is this possibly the origin for the phrase ""break a leg""?) The death of Lincoln, the nation's mourning (in North and South) and the fates of those involved in the conspiracy.

In all the program is VERY detailed, complete with excerpts of letters, photographs of many ""key"" figures(including one of Lincoln in his casket) some actual artifacts(such as the actual knife conspiritor Lewis Paine used to attack Secretary of State Seward that night.), little known facts, and decendants of Booth and Dr. Mudd The ""supposed"" conspirator who unknowingly set Booth's broken leg.(his actual involvement is still debated today.)

In conclusion, this program goes DEEP into the assasination.

So get this!!  The worst that could happen is you learn something!!!",1105228800,29,1850,5.085808580858086
