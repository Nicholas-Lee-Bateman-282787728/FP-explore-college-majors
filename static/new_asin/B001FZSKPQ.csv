3592628,2,B001FZSKPQ,"<strong>The Gay Bed and Breakfast of Terror</strong> (Jaymes Thompson, 2007)

I've actually had a number of people, in the months since I watched this, ask me what in the world I was thinking. I don't get it, because to me, the answer is obvious. It's called <em>The Gay Bed and Breakfast of Terror</em>. I mean, come on, how can you NOT want to watch a movie called <em>The Gay Bed and Breakfast of Terror</em>? This is a movie title that promises laughs, or at least uncomfortable giggles. Acres of stupid satire rivalling only the acres of fabulous fashion. Oh, and there will probably be a serial killer running around. Score! Sadly, the reality was far from the promise, but it wasn't entirely unwatchable.

Plot: Helen (Mari Marks) and her daughter Luella (Georgia Jean) run a small bed and breakfast in the middle of nowhere that experiences a sudden surge in popularity when all the hotels in the city fill up for a weekend get-together (it's never explicitly stated, but the chance everyone in this movie is <em>not</em> referring to LA PRIDE is essentially nil) before everyone who's planning on attending gets a room. And thus, five couples (and one [censored for Amazon consumption] sister) check into Helen and Luella's Sahara Salvation Inn, home of the country's best mincemeat muffins. And, oh, yeah, a homophobic serial killer (bet you didn't read about that in the brochure...).

To be fair, <em>The Gay Bed and Breakfast of Terror</em> does deliver some hefty doses of satire, and Jaymes Thompson's script is loads better than his direction (he left the director's chair to producer Sean Abley when Abley took much of this cast to helm <em>Socket</em> later that year). And the movie does offer a few broad laughs based on that satire, though most of them are uncomfortably close to prejudice (ooh, let's make fun of the lipstick lesbians!). Still, it does manage to hit the mark a time or two (its slaps at the ""plotting"" in modern porn films are hysterical, and there's a promising subplot with two characters who discover they may actually be hetero... though it gets dropped when things start getting complex). Or it would if anyone involved in this movie were actually an actor. There are a few folks who have some nascent chops that could be made into something good (Georgia Jean seems especially promising), but much of this cast were obviously in it for the love of the thing. It is unfortunate indeed that enthusiasm will only take you so far. **",1341532800,,2474,4.830188679245283
3592629,1,B001FZSKPQ,"I love the cheesy horror film genre, but this didn't even produce on that count.
It wasn't silly fun it was just painful to watch.  It was like some friends got together for the weekend and decided to make it into a film, but they don't even come across as the type of people you'd want to hang out with.  The thing just dragged, the story, such as it was, just started and stopped. There was gratuitous sex, which ended up coming across as gross and unecessary. There was absolutely nothing memorable or enjoyable about the flick.",1341187200,4,531,4.463917525773196
3592630,5,B001FZSKPQ,"This is a movie that is so lame, but that's what makes the movie.  It is very funny and one to watch with a group of people, just for laughs.  It was great!  Felt like a kick back from the 80's type movies...",1291852800,,208,3.7906976744186047
3592631,1,B001FZSKPQ,"The Gay bed and breakfast of Horror is the worst film ever! Attack of the killer tomatoes which has been voted the world worst movie is an A grade blockbuster compared to this film. Think of the worst film you have ever seen then multiply how bad it is by 100 and you might get close to how bad this film is. The plot of this film was weak and the acting even weaker. The script of this film should have been used to beat the writer about the head and shoulders as a fitting punishment for what he has inflicted on the world. Apart from a few of the characters looking good semi naked this film offers nothing to anyone who loves not just a good horror film but any film, ever! I'm sorry to those who are trying to sell this DVD but, I can highly recommend that you DON'T waist you money on the film as you will be disappointed.",1251417600,,828,4.085889570552148
3592632,1,B001FZSKPQ,"That's it-the one star is for the title. A group of friends, presumably gay decided to make a slasher flick with a cast of characters living alternate life-styles. Nothing wrong with that, the only problem is, they forgot to make a movie. Just a string of scenes about 5 gay and/or lesbian couples staying as a last resort at a rundown bed and breakfast run by a haggard ""drag"" of a mother and her beyond retarded daughter.  Also crawling around the place is a legless mutant with razor blade teeth-this is the mothers son who is the product of mom being raped by every delegate at the 1980 republican convention.  Naturally everyone gets picked off until all that's left is a drag queen and a lesbian folk-singer. They become the new proprietors of the b&b and are as loony as the mother-daughter duo.  And of course Manfred, the legless mutant is still around as the new owners welcome a couple of hairy gay guys in town for the ""bear"" convention.

Believe me, my description sounds better than the movie plays and I hope the film-makers had a good time making the movie because the viewer won't.

P.S.  There is a gay slasher movie out there called ""Hell Bent"" which has a better story, better actors, realistic death scenes and fun.

If they intended ""Bed and Breakfast.etc"" to be camp, I'd rather go to Camp Crystal Lake and face Jason than ever see this movie again.",1242432000,,1372,4.575510204081633
3592633,5,B001FZSKPQ,One of the most funny and campy movies I have seen in a very long time! My friends and I laughed so much during the movie--it was just so much fun. The acting is actually pretty good and the storyline was great! I loved it and totally want to be in The Gay Bed and Breakfast of Terror Part 2! Loved it!,1230163200,5,302,3.8870967741935485
3592634,4,B001FZSKPQ,"Five gay or lesbian couples (with one tag-along f*g hag) waited too long to book nearby accommodations to the big ""Blue Party"" in the desert, so they reserve the only place on the web with available rooms ... the Sahara Salvation Inn, a bed&breakfast listed as gay friendly.  When they finally get to the secluded, rundown inn, they meet the rather strange religious owners, Helen and her daughter Luella, who offer them homemade mincemeat muffins (Trust me, you DON'T want to know!) The guests are a laughable collection of stereotypes, including the current ""Mr. Leather"" (played by writer/director Jaymes Thompson), a lesbian folk singer, a 20-something ""personal trainer"" there with his sugar-daddy, a lesbian couple who makes their own line of edible body paints, a gay male couple hardly speaking to each other, and a drag queen with attitude to spare. One by one, many of the guests turn up missing or dead, most of them the work of the dagger-wielding right-wing homophobic lunatic Helen, who prays in front of a candlelit altar covered with photos of Republican party leaders.  Then there's her ... err ... son, Manfred.  Bad, uh, boy (sort of.)

This is obviously a horror film played strictly for laughs, with lots of blood and gore (strawberry preserves, according to the extras), overacting and trite dialogue, and a ""camp"" quotient totally off the scale. What can you say about a film whose theme song is ""Watch Out for the Straights""?  The actors obviously had fun putting it together, which makes it also fun to watch.  Not the thing to show Mom and Pop when they visit (especially if they are Republicans, since the GOP is the focus of many of the jokes), and even some uptight gay and lesbian viewers may be offended.  It's not great or even good filmmaking, if you go by the usual criteria, but stands by itself as a grossly hysterical diversion which I recommend completely. As several other reviewers have said, ""It's so bad, it's great!""  DVD extras are plentiful, including a short film about going to ""the folks' house"" for Christmas, director commentary, outtakes, music video of the theme, making-of short and trailers.  Four stars out of five.",1226966400,5,2170,4.891008174386921

3592717,5,B001FZSKPQ,"I love cheesy horror/comedy movies. I don't know if it was intentional, but the over-acting in this just kills me. It's the type of movie you can put on in the background at a party and every now and again someone is like WTF, did they just say that? Yes you can't just sit down and watch it straight through. It's something you need looping in the background for random entertainment. If you don't like B movies don't watch it....but when I watched it, I tried to think, ""What would Elvira say?"" And that my friends made the movie worth it.",1420070400,,541,4.366336633663367
