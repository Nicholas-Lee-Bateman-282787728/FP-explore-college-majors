1302238,4,B00003CXWJ,"You already know the plot, the parents are spies, they get captured, the kids save them, blah blah blah. But you probably don't know about the thumb-thumbs. Who couldn't love a creature with a thumb for a head, thumbs for arms, and thumbs for legs? How cute! Where would the movie go without them?",988156800,2,297,4.518518518518518
1302239,5,B00003CXWJ,this is a james bond film with kids in it. its got the wit villains and acting needed to pull it off. see this for antonio banderas.,987724800,4,132,3.925925925925926
1302240,4,B00003CXWJ,"When I initially saw the previews for this movie, the only word that came to mind was 'yikes.'  But after the film garnered good reviews, I opted to see it, and am extremely glad I did.  The film is chock full of good special effects, imaginative sets and vibrant colors, not to mention well-developed characters and witty dialogue.  The story opens with a bedtime story of two opposing spies who fall in love, and then marry and settle down to raise a family.  The two spies, of course, are the two parents of the young protagonists in the story, Carmen and Juni.  After their parents are kidnapped, the kids are forced to save their parents, and consequently the world from the evil Floop.  Instead of making the parents dumb pawns in the plot, they are smart and can actually think for themselves.  The kids are also independent and face their fears head on, making them perfect role models.  Rarely, a movie like this comes along and is entertaining to the parents as well as the kids (The abysmal See Spot Run, for example is entertaining for no one).  The film has action, a plausible plot and a ton of heart.  This is a great family film.",986688000,46,1145,4.514563106796117
1302241,4,B00003CXWJ,"Recently, there has been a trend in family films:  they're getting better.  The atrocity of ""See Spot Run"" aside, the last few years have seen more good PG-or-under-rated fare than just the standard Disney animation.  See, for instance, the flawless ""Chicken Run,"" ""Titan AE,"" and ""The Prince of Egypt"" and you will be able to tell what I am talking about.  Now you can add ""Spy Kids"" to that list.
This film is a head-spinning whirl of invention and brilliance, marred only occasionally by predictability or a poop joke.  It must have been a sheer joy to make, because all on-screen appear to be having loads of fun.  It's wonderful to see even the normally stone-faced Robert Patrick (the T-1000 in ""Terminator 2,"" Agent Doggit in ""The X-Files) having to hold back a grin as a corporate villain.  Fortunately for us, this all passes along to the audience.  Everyone, and not just the teeny-boppers.  With bright, intelligent production design (was that really a yellow submarine I saw?), a light sense of humor, and wonderful pacing, this evokes a grin from even the most concerned parent.
Not that this is all fluff.  There is a rare degree of intelligence here, especially for a kid's movie.  At one point, a young Hispanic child shouts something, and instead of going the easy route and doing it in English, writer/director Robert Rodriguez uses Spanish, with a subtitle telling us what was said.  Not only there, but nearly all the major characters are written with sharp observation.  The parents are intelligent, willful, and when they go back into the biz' after retirement, it's because *they* want to, not because the plot does.  Even Floop, the villain bent on world-domination, is given sufficient motivation:  he's lonely and insecure, and wants to feel appreciated.  (Most of this becomes apparent through the brilliant perfomance of Alan Cummings.)  And the children...
The two kids are, without a doubt, the center of this movie, and well to do so.  As written, they are real siblings, hating and loving each other at the same time.  They know each other's weaknesses, they know how to push each other's buttons, but at the same time, they obviously care about each other.  This is one tight-knit family.  Hollywood needs more like them.
This is also not to say the movie is perfect.  It does stray into poop jokes, though only twice, and there is also a predictable plot element involving an estranged brother.  However by the time it reaches this point, it has more than enough credit going for us to forgive it.
Before the movie began, there were trailers for nearly all the upcoming family and children's films this summer.  Some looked good, some looked mediocre.  However, if more are like this, it will be a good year.  Kids, do your parents a favor:  take them to see ""Spy Kids""",986083200,7,2803,4.821802935010482

Honestly, my kids enjoyed all the action and the banter between the siblings but very few reviews mentioned the disturbing undertones of the plot.  My 9 year old son ran out of the room crying and wouldn't come back in when one of the characters was morphed into a creepy multi-headed version of himself.  It didn't bother my 11 & 7 year-olds but for some reason it really scared him. I would not watch this movie again nor recommend it.",1445644800,,572,4.533980582524272

1305878,4,B00003CXWJ,"As a big fan of Rodriguez' ""Desperado"", it was a lot of fun watching him turn that film's down-and-dirty and very violent sensibilities on their ear for this one. (His use of Danny Trejo is a particular hoot!) The kids (Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara) come off as kids rather than miniature adults, which is always a plus in projects like this, and there's even some nice romantic chemistry between the parents (Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino). Alan Cumming and Tony Shaloub comprise the main villainous faction and carry it with their usual skill and offbeat charm. Teri Hatcher and Robert Patrick, however, clutter things up in rather unnecessary roles, and that plus some clunky direction compels me to render a four-star rather than a five-star verdict.",1431648000,,757,4.968503937007874

1306277,5,B00003CXWJ,"Spy Kids is a family film that tells the story of 12-year-old Carmen Cortez and her younger 9-year-old brother Juni Cortez. They are two greatest child secret agents in the world that are known for abilities such as masters of disguise,ability to invent various things and the ability to prevent wars. Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara stars together with Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino.

This definitely provides a lot of joy and entertainment for the film's intended audience as we get to see young lead stars fulfill many of the children's dream of working as spies in lieu with the terrorism and terrorist attacks in the United States during its year of release. While the visual effects maybe considered far from standard as of today,it would still be proper to say that it definitely helped the young audience to enjoy it back then. Finally,this will definitely provides lots of fun as a family film and expecting something not silly will surely disappoint many who aren't expecting any.",1428192000,,990,4.92814371257485

This, however, was just rubbish.
I was surprised to see how many well-known celebs were in this movie (George Clooney??), but that didn't stop the awful acting, terrible plot, and really lame special effects.",1420329600,,507,4.644444444444445

I'm almost 21 in a month and two weeks and these films were my childhood- other young adults my age who've seen these know what I'm talking about. These films for us were a complete and utter craving. We all wanted to be spys and be a part of the OSS and have cool gadgets and have Mom and Dad sit us down and confess that they're not really a doctor and a Salesmen like they appear to be but undercover OSS Secret Agents.

I remember when each trailer was released, kids in my neighborhood would all get together and play Spies and make the streets of our neighborhood the OSS. It was our youth.

These films sure as heck aren't going to earn a Golden Globe but they will remain in my chapter of childhood in the book in my heart.

1308137,4,B00003CXWJ,"Has it really been 10 years since this film series began? And I've missed it all that time as well? Thank goodness Lionsgate, as part of their releasing Miramax films to blu-ray, has decided to include the three films in the series. Yes, there is a fourth just out in theaters, but that won't be out for a while. Just be glad these three are.

The first of the three is a treat. The story revolves around Carman (Alexa Vega) and Juni (Daryl Sabara) Cortez, two seemingly normal kids who live with their parents Gregorio and Ingrid (Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino) in some far off land. The thing is they have no idea that their parents are the two best spies in the entire world who've retired with the occasional gig should the world face imminent danger.

One such event occurs and both parents are captured by the evil Fegan Floop (Alan Cumming), a creative genius and children's TV show host who is developing a group of robotic children to replace those of government officials for bad guy Mr. Lisp (Robert Patrick). With henchman Alexander Minion (Tony Shaloub) assisting him, the plan seems destined to work. Only Gregorio has the solution to one final problem.

To coerce the two into working for them, Floop sends his henchmen to capture the kids. Their ""uncle"" Felix (Cheech Marin) helps them escape and reveals to them the fact that they are the offspring of the best spies that exist. How cool is that? Tossed into the world they weren't quite aware of, the duo takes naturally to the gadgets and danger associated with being spies. With the help of the OSS, the organization that employs their folks, the kids set out to take down Floop.

So what makes this movie so good? Well to begin with it not only entertains kids but adults as well. The kids get the joy of seeing someone their age being able to use what we as kids loved most about Bond flicks, the gadgets. The parents get to see an entertaining movie with a great cast that all work well together. The combination succeeds on all levels.

Director Robert Rodriguez has made some of the most entertaining films in recent years, in various genres. So to think that he couldn't do right by kids movies would have been a losing bet. He brings off the wonder that kids find in all things bright and colorful, a kid's view of the world, innocence, while at the same time giving them adult responsibilities. Don't get me wrong though, this is not the ""real"" world here. The film takes place in a world that seems brighter than most filled with all sorts of off beat locations and sets.

The acting is well done and never overplayed by the cast. Most of it is played for laughs by the adults but they come off as normal in this world. The kids, Vega and Sabara, work well together sparring back and forth like siblings do but caring about each other deep down. Neither seems to be performing and that makes their performances seem real, a step up from many actors their age.

What makes this film work is, well, everything. It's acted and directed well. It looks visually stunning. And most importantly it's fun, not just for kids watching the movie but for adults as well. It's rare these days to find a film that will entertain both groups, but this one does so in spades. Sure, there are the occasional gross out jokes, but kids will laugh at them and adults will roll their eyes, all the while snickering so the kids don't see.

I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. Then again I don't think Rodriguez has made a movie yet that I didn't enjoy. The blu-ray transfer makes the colors pop off the screen and the clarity of picture makes it a joy to watch. This movie, and the two sequels, are not movies to rent but to add to your collection.",1332806400,,3723,4.488921713441655

1308252,1,B00003CXWJ,"I hated this movie with a passion.  It's a love letter that Robert Rodriguez has written to himself in celebration of how clever and talented he thinks he is.

The movie is chock full of stuff.  It's loud, obnoxious and undeniably fast-paced.  Yet it somehow manages to be a big bore.  There's next to no character development at all; all these characters are one-dimensional and unappealing.

Rodriguez's screenplay is a mess.  It's uneven and underdeveloped.  It's obvious he was more interested in getting to the next big action scene or special effects sequence than he was in telling a coherent story or giving his characters any kind of plausible motivation for their behavior.

There are a handful of amusing sequences, but they're drowned in excess and stupidity.  And as much as I don't want to criticize a child actor, Daryl Sabara's performance is uncomfortably bad.  The kid shows virtually no emotion, even in scenes that are supposed to be emotional or suspenseful.

Rodriguez has suffered from this ailment in his movie-making for years now: spectacle, wink-wink self-consciousness and a pathological need to be ""hip and cool,"" all at the expense of telling interesting stories.  He had a potentially interesting story here and he blew it.",1265846400,5,1254,5.058536585365854

1308256,5,B00003CXWJ,"Robert Rodriguez is not the first person you'd suggest to make a children's film. As entertaining as 'Desperado', 'The Faculty' and 'From Dusk Till dawn' are, you wouldn't line them up alongside 'Toy Story 2' and 'The Jungle Book' for good, old-fashioned family entertainment. Yet, as this energetic, light-hearted Bondesque spoof proves, Rodriguez has the talent to turn his hand to just about anything, and inject it with the suspense and adrenalin that are his trademark.  From the gloriously OTT opening scene (which tells the story of how two agents sent to kill each other fall in love and settle down) to the last second, 'Spy Kids' doesn't miss a trick. The obligatory gizmos, mad villains and dastardly plot to take over the world are all there, along with a star cast all playing their roles with tongues firmly in cheek. The action/humour mix is extremely well-balanced too, with some hilarious visual gags sitting within a sharp script and Banderas, in particular, revels taking a sly swipe at his normal 'strong yet silent Latino' image. Yet, refreshingly for a children's film, it's never patronising, never obvious, and genuinely original in places (soldiers made of thumbs, secret agents transformed into tellytubby-type TV characters - imagine Goldeneye-meets-Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory-meets-Any Tim Burton film and you'll be close). In truth, some of the surreal moments and the more graphic effects may get a little too much for younger kids at times, but these moments are few and far between.  Ok, it's a 'U' certificate and you may well have to sit through the trailer for 'See Spot Run', but don't let that put you off. This is one of the better films you'll see this year, and the best out over Easter by quite a way. Go and have some fun.",1253836800,,1775,4.913333333333333

This also looks very good on DVD. I suspect it would look tremendous with a sharp Blu-Ray transfer. Included in the color and characters are ""the thumb people"" who were especially fun to watch.

The only problem I found with it is the last 30 minutes in which it got too silly and emphasized (typical Hollywood) how the kids can do the job better than the adults, which a ludicrous film clich. However, overall ""family unity"" gets a big boost in this here, even in the end, and that good message is probably a big reason this movie was such a success.",1240704000,,823,4.443708609271523

1308500,5,B00003CXWJ,"Who ever thought that the man who brought us El Mariachi and From Dusk until Dawn could create a kids movie.  Well I was surprised as well and very pleased with the results.
Spy Kids is about a two kids who live a fairly ordinary life.  They go to a private school, hang out with friends, fight with each other.  Than one day their parents dissapear after going on vacation.  At that point they discover that their parents are international spys and that their lives are in danger.  As it turns out their parents are kidnapped by a man called Floop who has also mutated seecret agents and used them on his TV show.  He is also designing an army of robots to conquer the world.  It is then up to Carmen and Juni to stop him.
This movie is entertaing for multiple reasons.  First off it''s funny and that is rare in a kids movie.  However it is also intelligently done.  So where as something like Kangaroo Jack has jokes that are blatently vulgar that would confuse small kids, this one is intelligent enough that there are two meanings behind each.  Also the action is relentless but there are no guns.  As a spy thriller of sorts none of the bad guys have guns.  Instead the fights are coreoraphed like something out of a Hong Kong action film or Charlies Angels.  FInally it teaches a lesson as well about family and passions in life.  I would recomend this to anyone.",1058486400,,1370,4.402390438247012

1308502,5,B00003CXWJ,"To be honest, my first glimpse at a preveiw of Spy Kids had me thinking ""Stupid. Cheesy acting, pointless plot!""  And when I first saw it in 2001, my thoughts weren't changed.
Now I'm 14, and I decided to rent it again because I'm a movie fanatic, and Spy Kids deserved another chance. This movie had me laughing like no other and anxiously waiting to see what was going to happen next. Now that I'm older I can see the movie in a more in-depth perspective and I can appreciate the lessons it has for audiences.
Antonio Banderas had me wondering at one point why he would go from great movies such as Evita to a kid flick like Spy Kids, but he plays his role perfectly. Alexa Vega and the other kid (I forget his name?) portray siblings excellently, and the lessons learned between them both are very realistic. And for humor, two thumbs up for Alan Cumming as Floop. He's a phenomenal actor, and seeing X-Men 2 one day (where he plays the blue, german-accented, teleporting Nightcrawler), and then Spy Kids the next (where he plays a comical, depressed villain) had me wondering just how he handles his accents so well.
This movie deserves 5 stars! If you're a serious person, don't bother seeing it; you have to be a fun-loving, easily humoured person to truly appreciate it (think of it this way - just the plain fact that Floop's Fooglies are so ugly and stupid has me laughing hysterically. I can laugh at anything!). Great kids movie as well as family movie.",1057104000,,1464,4.524528301886792

1308507,4,B00003CXWJ,"It's rare today for a children's movie to be entertaining to both kids and adults. But Robert Rodriquez's ""Spy Kids"" does just that.
At its heart, it's still a kids flick, but one that is put together well with style, good dialogue, good laughs and lots of fun. It avoids the general kid movie pitfalls of a clich&eacute;d plot, flat characters and predictable dialogue. Sure kids don't mind those faults, but they cause films to be quickly forgotten years down the road. But films like ""Spy Kids"" are ones parents don't mind watching with their kids, and adults can even watch alone to entertain that inner child in them without killing brain cells like most children's fare does.
Nope, Rodriquez's film is fun and fast, telling a kid's version of James Bond, but with heart. The movie's opening is especially wonderful as the mother of the two future spy kids tells the ""fabled"" story of the two spies who met and fell in love. It sets a wonderful tone of the importance of family and the action quality of the film.
Of course, Rodriquez's usual cast of regulars come back, such as Cheech Marin, Danny Trejo and Antonio Banderas, but the real stars of the film are the two pint-sized spies, who hold the film well enough on their own. Their sibling banter is fun, realistic and wholly enjoyable.
Also, Danny Elfman's score is wonderful, heavy in Mexican-influenced themes. He wrote some wonderfully demented children's songs incorporated in the film that reminded me of his work on the songs for ""The Nightmare Before Christmas.""

This guy has some imagination and he shows that with this movie. ...He really knows what it takes to entertain a young audience. At the same time Spy Kids entertains grown-ups like myself with it's wild imagination and cool action. Rodriguez is also one of the most creative director's out there, After watching this film and the second one I have no doubt of his talent what so ever.
 Spy Kids is a dream come true for a child's imagination. There's big robots shaped like thumbs, cool gadgets, dream like atmospheres and clever dialogue and humor. The kids aren't the best actors like Richard Roeper said, for instance when they punch a rock hard robot or a brick wall they just say ""ouch"" and it's not believeable that they just got hurt at all. I think Roeper was too hard on them in the second one though as they showed great improvement. Their performances are actually a lot of fun in part 2 which makes that one surprisingly better.
 More about this film though, Alan Cummings is great as the Pee Wee Herman like villain Floop who's not really evil, just will do anything for a better show. He only had a cameo in the second film unfortunetly but here he's a lot of fun. Some critic said he does nothing for him as an actor unless he's painted green like he was in Flinstones Viva Las Vegas. I think that isn't right at all, Cummings is an actor with a lot of energy and ability and he shows it here. He steals the show here ..., no he doesn't have to be painted green to be enterrtaining.

I saw the one kid interviewed and he is like ""um...we-ll...um..."" He can barely talk! Great casting guys! This movie also wastes great acting talent...Antonio Banderas and Alan Cumming! What are they doing in a movie called spy kids? This movie is absolutely terrible and should never have even been released! AVOID AT ALL COSTS.

Plenty of action that is just a little violent, but clean language and generally good-guy-bad-guy is easy to spot. The creations of Floop are great and Floop's transition to a good guy is really great for developing minds. Have your kids watch it ... and you watch it, too!",1042243200,3,340,4.412698412698413

Unfortunately, the DVD disappoints.  The alternate shark scene that precipitated the rerelease?  Nowhere to be found.  Neither are any other cool extras that I love to play around with and are the real reason I got a DVD player in the first place.  If you've switched to DVDs, get it for the movie.

1308622,4,B00003CXWJ,"This is an excellent family film, with plenty of action, comedy, and solid pro-family messages for both kids and parents, messages which don't beat you over the head or drip with saccharine.  A great mix of fantasy, adventure,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/James-Bondian/dp/B000V3JGI8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">James Bondian</a>&nbsp;gadgets, and kid-accessible characters and themes.

Director Robert Rodriguez, best known for his ultra-violent films such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/El-Mariachi/dp/B0000A2ZTY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">El Mariachi</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Desperado/dp/B0000A2ZU1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Desperado</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/From-Dusk-Till-Dawn/dp/B00004RJ74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">From Dusk Till Dawn</a>, crafts an well-paced, well-told, and highly enjoyable story.  I easily sat through this film in the theater, pleased with its impressive production values, acting, story, special effects, and its sheer imagination.  I was engaged and interested from the very beginning, as were my kids (4 and 6).  I remain impressed by the clearly adult themes (and visuals) of the opening boy spy-meets-girl spy bedtime story, as we slowly realize that the story being told was that of the now boring, predictable, and thoroughly domesticated mom and dad.  We've watched this film dozens of times since, and it's still easy to sit through, great fun for both me and the kids.

The morals of the story are clear enough to any adult viewer:  the importance of family and family support, the importance of believing in yourself, and the importance of being open and honest.  My 4-year-old son picked up clearly on all three messages, without any pointers from me.  By the end of the film, everyone has matured in one way or another, every character has gained insight, and the family is closer than it ever was before.

There are great supporting appearances by Cheech Marin and Robert Patrick (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terminator-2/dp/B000EWBKKI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Terminator 2</a>), although we sadly don't see enough of either.  Alan Cumming as the fanciful and ultimately influential Floop is very enjoyable.  Tony Shalhoub is great fun, as he is in every role he touches (check him out in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barton-Fink/dp/B00008RH3J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barton Fink</a>), as the diabolical master manipulator, initially in the background who eventually becomes the ultimate bad guy, Alexander Minion.  His best line, as he takes over:  ""I can assure you, it's MISTER Minion now.""  He gets his in the end, naturally, but it is not unpleasant or gory.  It's actually quite comical, and he appears even to accept the final result/punishment he has brought upon himself.

There are a number of other celebrity cameos here, including Teri Hatcher,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beavis-and-Butt-Head/dp/B000H7JCF0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beavis and Butt-Head</a>&nbsp;creator Mike Judge as Donnagon, George Clooney right at the end as Devlin, and a very stealthy Dick Clark as one of Floop's financiers.

The story of the kids discovering that their parents are spies, having to strike out on their own with neither knowledge nor support, and then using their smarts and talents to take action to regain control of the situation and find their parents is plausible throughout, even when they're flying over the ocean and desert in personal jetpacks and mini-jet planes.  We trace the kids from their home into the bad guy's lair, and the journey is easily believable and logical.

The gadgets are a treat, from mini-jet planes to personal flying Buddy Pacs to homing devices, electrostatic gum, pinpoint video cameras, submarine minivans, instant McDonald microwave meals, and a totally cool Super Guppy submarine.  The best part is that the kids get almost all of the gadgets, and they put them to instant good use defeating the bad guys.

There are plenty of good comic bits to liven up the film as well, both jokes and sight gags.  The kids act and talk like kids throughout, which adds to their plausibility of the film.  The humor is both juvenile and adult, and presented in such a way as to keep the two separate, as they should be.  There is no swearing, no blood or gore, no violence (some minor fisticuffs), no gunplay or weapons, no nudity, and no drugs.

Spy Kids is original, creative family fare, great for a video/DVD purchase and repeated viewings at home.  The messages in the movie are strong and highly positive, yet subtle enough not to overshadow enjoyment of the story, its characters, and their adventures.",1034208000,6,4925,6.171303074670571

ACTING: Wow, Alex Vega and Daryl Sabara knocked me over with their pro performences. The bounce off each other perfectly, and really seem like siblings. The rest of the supporting(adult) cast is great too- 100% flawless.
PLOT: Original and gripping, this is the entertaining story of two children whos parents are captured- while on a spy mission, which the kids have no idea about. Now the kids(Carmen and Juni) have to save their parents and the world from a creative madman.
HUMOR: Wonderful, I laughed hundreds of times during this film and have done so all 10+ times I have seen the movie since.
SPECIAL EFFECTS: This movie has a brand of special effects all it's own, completely original and convincing. A breath of fresh after the doses of metallic Star Wars CGI.
MUSIC: The score, by the director, is beautiful and original. Completely perfect, something that I will never forget. Worth buying the soundtrack.
SPECIAL FEATURES:  This is one of the most bare-bones DVDs I've ever seen, terrible for such a great movie! Unless of course all you want is (dun dun dun dun) a trailer!
CONCLUSION: A wonderul family/comedy/thriller, great for anyone and memorable. Spy Kids is definitely worth buying on DVD, if only for the lasting sound quality and picture clarity.

It is definitely a ""kids only"" movie.  Rather immature in many aspects.

1308726,1,B00003CXWJ,"When I first saw 'Spy Kids', I was thirteen and not aloud to see The Jennifer Love Hewitt comedy 'Heartbreakers'. Since these were the only two movies playing at the tiny, small-town movie theater I where I was planning to spend the afternoon, me and a friend suffered through what seemed like an eternity of boring jokes, annoying characters and anti-climactic scenes. We both concluded that Spy Kids is a plot-less kiddy acid-trip.
  Spy Kids stars Antonio Banderas, Carla Gugino, Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara as the dysfunctional Cortez family. The parents of which (unbeknownst to their bratty children) are spies. Well, on an assignment to the mind-bending abode of a creepy children's show host they disappear, and their children, snobby Carmen and insecure Juni, step in to save them and ultimately do. But not before nearly killing the audience with their disagreeable personalities and incessant bickering.
  Spy Kids is so over-the-top with creepy situations and delusional, fantasy-like scenarios that it's hard to imagine children liking or even understanding this movie. And between Alan Cumming's eerie character and the machine that turns people into disfigured monsters it certainly isn't for children who scare easily.
  In fact the whole movie has a very sinister feel to it, with a differant plot and characters this movie could qualify as a horror movie or atleast a thriller. Fegan Floops' (Alan Cummings) bizarre Muppet-inspired monsters reminded me of Willy Wonka's Oompa-Loompas, except less attractive and more bizarre. In fact these two movies are a little bit similar, except that 'Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory' is good and 'Spy Kids' is anything but.
  In short, Spy Kids is a complete waste of money. It's a [poor] excuse for a movie and as I've said, a complete waste of time.",1029024000,3,1812,5.11864406779661

1308729,5,B00003CXWJ,"I've been a fan of Robert Rodriguez from the first moment I saw ""El Mariachi,"" and each successive film has just given me more reason to be a fan. With ""Spy Kids,"" Rodriguez changes gears, giving us his first film for kids, and the first film where he finally gives free rein to the sense of whimsy and fantasy hinted at in previous films.
While the film is nominally a kid's film -- a surreal children's television show that makes the Teletubbies look mundane features prominently in the story -- the humor and action is genuinely good for all ages. At one point, pre-teen heroine Carmen Cortez says that no one knows what her uncle does for a living, and he moves around a lot, and is generally mysterious. To which her uncle replies ""doesn't everyone have an uncle like that?"" Well, yes, we do. :)
Beyond Antonio Banderas' star power -- and he does a very knowing self-parody of his own traditional parts in the movie -- other strong performances by ""name"" actors pepper the film, including Teri Hatcher, Tony Shaloub, Robert Patrick, Cheech Marin and -- one of those actors viewers know by sight, if not by name -- Danny Trejo.
Overall, the action is kinetic, the message sweet, the kids believable and not in the least cloying (a true rarity in film), and overall, the film is a great treat for Rodriguez fans who have been watching his evolution towards more and more fantastic material (something that seemed obviously in his blood ever since the climax of ""Desperado"").

This Movie is Wonderful - It appeals to all ages. The ""Kid's Rule"" Message, as well as The various gadgets and the spy underworld Theme appeal to Children, whereas the Delightfully Campy Villans And The Older, James Bond-esque parents appeal to The older Audiences.
While The two Child Actors Did Beautifully, And Banderas turned in his usual Solid Performance along with His Co-star Carla Guinido, I Must say that the delicious Alan Cumming truly Stole the show with his Outrageous And Loveable Floop, the Host of a Bizzare Children's show. He is truly a brilliant actor who turned in a stellar performance, switching from the extremes of Evil to Good in a single performance. I also Must say that his accent work was amazing - for those who don't know, he is scottish, and has one of the thickest accents around.
The sets and Costumes were Beautiful, and really should win some sort of award. The Music, also, was a treat, from the flamenco Guitair of the Beginning, to Danny Elfman's 'Floop's Song'. the Tim-Burtonish aspect of the Movie was also Highly appreciated, as I'm a huge Fan of his work.

1308841,4,B00003CXWJ,"I recently said that Hollywood may have forgotten how to make family movies. It seemed like an art lost in a sea of social changes. It is often said that children aren't as innocence as they used to be. If so, this is equally true of adults. Stories that entertained our grandparents are ones that many of us today find tame, trite and tedious. So, Spy Kids is a welcome surprise. It's fast, funny and innovative. By design, it's greatest appeal is to children, but most parents should enjoy it, too. It is like a Tim Burton movie [The Nightmare Before Christmas, Batman, Sleepy Hollow] with all the dark overtones happily banished. It doesn't make any sense, but, like all great tall tales, it exists in its own space and time.
It took an odd pairing to create this movie. Its star, Antonio Banderas, gained fame as a very hot lover in movies in his native Spain. Director Robert Rodriguez started out in Mexico making movies that were stylish and creative but extremely violent. Until Spy Kids, his American movies were the same. I don't know what drew them to this project, but I'm glad they chose to do it.
Carmen and Juni [Alexa Varga and Daryl Sabara] are kids who live in a cool house overlooking the ocean. Their parents, Gregorio and Ingrid [Banderas and Carla Gugino] are loving but decidedly uncool as far as Carmen and Juni are concerned. Mom is overly protective, and Dad seems to be a wimp. They run a consulting business out of the house. What the kids don't know is that Mom and Dad used to be international spies. Currently, Gregorio and Ingrid are looking into the disappearance of some former coworkers. Juni is obsessed with a wacky children's show starring the bizarre Fegan Floop [Alan Cummin]. The boy, as well as the rest of the family, is about to learn that Floop and the disappearing spies are very much connected. When Gregorio and Ingrid also vanish, the kids set out to find them. It will prove to be the adventure of a lifetime.
The sets are colorful and imaginative. There are lots of cool gadgets - crayons that are actually lasers, neat cars that are also boats and submarines and so forth. Floop has a treasure trove of creatures he has created, including the robot children he plans to use to take over the world. My favorite characters are his bodyguards - pudgy, waddling things that are literally all thumbs.
Banderas is fun as Gregorio, playing a kind of a parody of himself. Varga and Sabara make the children likable. These aren't the cloyingly cute kids you see in most family films. They have personalities with flair and great senses of humor. Cummin plays Floop as a Pee Wee Herman gone completely mad. He's a great villain.
Spy Kids may be about kidnapping and espionage on one level, but it's also about the importance of family, not in the sense of so-called family values, but in the sense of love and loyalty. There will be a sequel in 2002, and, for once, I'm glad to hear it.",1016064000,3,2928,4.5790476190476195

It turns out that the host of a popular children's show is actually kidnapping spies for information to finish an army of robot children (the Spy Kids) he has sold to an evil businessman who wants to rule the world. Far-out plot, huh? But, surprisingly, it works and works rather well. There are a lot of spy gadgets that the kids use that are really interesting. Also, much of the scenery is quite breathtaking, but in a warped way, reminding me of a Salvador Dali painting.
This movie is a family-oriented film. However, it is not your typical family movie. There is a little bit of foul language that cleverly slips by. What is unusual about the film is it's humor, setting, and characters. Sure there are a few bathroom jokes of the junior high variety. However, most people don't find humor in a robot called Thumb-thumbs that's nothing but five thumbs put together, or in puzzle floors that sometimes fall apart, or in body mutation machines that change people into cartoon-like characters. Heck, most people don't even get the wit of kids driving under the sea in a yellow submarine that looks like a guppy. Nevertheless, this is what happens when you put such a talented (yet, wild and somewhat warped) director as Robert Rodriguez at the helm of a children's movie. However, even if Pee Wee Herman-esque humor isn't your cup of tea, the movie does have a strong message about the strength of family, another message about honesty, another one about how kids can make a difference, and the movie has one of the best Latin American casts of all time. There isn't another family film like it.",1012348800,3,1902,4.646884272997033

1308958,4,B00003CXWJ,"I don't remember Spy Kids being in theaters very long, which is too bad. I would have seen the movie if someone  just told me ""Robert Rodriguez, Antonio Banderas, Danny Trejo"", so I rushed to rent it on DVD.
It's bizarre seeing a Rodriguez movie that's rated PG, but he knows how to film action (comes from the Sam Raimi school), so it's just as fun. Banderas and Carla Gugino play two suave expert international spies who fall in love and marry (in a very cool, James Bond -esque opening) but realize they are too much of a target together, so they (supposedly) give up espionage to settle down and raise a family. They agree not to tell their kids what they did before, but the kids find out when the parents are kidnapped by an evil toy making genius, and set out, with a ton of really cool-a$s gadgets, to rescue them.
If you're a fan of Rodriguez, definitely check this out. I read an interview where he said he got the idea from his section of 4 Rooms, The Misbehavers (and hey, for most of the movie Banderas looks like he did in 4 Rooms, fine with me, whoo-hooooo!)and saw the little kids dressed in tuxes. To be honest, I'm personally  never very thrilled to see movies that feature kids in prominent roles, but the movie was so entertaining I didn't mind; the kids are also great. Some of the humor is aimed at grade-schoolers, so it's not the funniest RR movie I've ever seen, but that's OK.
There's a ton of cool gadgets and weapons, most of them pretty original; the sets are also incredible, the art direction has a Terry Gilliam-type feel to it...with a little early Tim Burton mixed in.
I don't have kids, but it seems like a fine family movie to me; No-one gets killed, there's a positive message, there's Antonio Banderas to look at. RR regulars Cheech Marin and Danny Trejo (as a good guy!) show up; so does one of the stars of from Dusk Till Dawn in a cameo (hint: he is not a hard guy to look at). Maybe some RR fans will find parts a little sugary, but I didn't (then again, I'm a sap).
Very entertaining, and I don't think that a family spy movie has ever been done before. Not much in the way of extras on the DVD, just trailers, and if there are easter eggs, I couldn't find them, but the movie is strong enough to speak for itself.",1011312000,8,2257,4.308235294117647
1308959,1,B00003CXWJ,"I started off watching this is a hopeful feeling, but was very disapointed with this movie.
The basic story is as follows: Two kids have parents that are super spies, and who are determined not to let their children know. But when other agents vanish, they go off on the chase only to be captured themselves.
Their children go off to look for them, using technology that is so unreal that it is unbelieveable.
They find their parents in the production studio/island of the boy's favorite TV show, AND that the missing super agents have been mutated into the ugly characters of the TV show.
The bad guys are after a miniture brain that will allow their kid robots to function normally. These robots are going to be used as spies, replasing the children of government officials.
All in all, this movie was bad. The plot was bad, the characters were bad and the scenes were bad. Too unrealistic and too James Bond-like combined with a kids movie.

1309122,4,B00003CXWJ,"As lightweight as cotton candy and as exciting a rollercoaster ride, Spy Kids delivers an action packed James Bondesque adventure for both the young and young at heart. Carmen and Juni Cortez have no idea that the bedtime story 'The Spies Who Fell in Love' is actually the true story of how their parents met and gave up the derring do of International Intrigue for marriage and parenthood, an entirely different kind of adventure. However when a dastardly super villan plots to take over the world, forcing the adult Cortez couple out of semi-retirement, the kids find out just who their parents really are and that saving them (and the world) has fallen on their shoulders.
Spy Kids is hectic, never really pausing to catch its breath, and feels like a child's game always on the verge of spinning wildly out of control. Writer/Producer/Director Robert Rodriguez does keep it under control though, and delivers a winner of ride, though a little more attention to the people in the story would have helped make it a classic instead of just a great piece of fluff.",1009152000,,1064,4.788043478260869

1309126,3,B00003CXWJ,"I bought this for my nieces, and they seemed to like it.  I think the appeal to kids is that they do get to see people of their own age be proactive in a community--in this case a spy community.  SK therefore fits in the same genre as Matilda and all of the Parent Trap movies, so if you like those movies, you'll probably like Spy Kids.  (I could also see this movie turning into a series of movies, perhaps with Superhero kids or business-savvy kids who are the offspring of corporate moguls).
The breakdown of the heirarchal structure in the nuclear family may be a sticking point for many.  The parents are by no means inferior spies, but they are basically saved by the kids, and that displaces the parents' agency (no pun intended) and puts the kids in the role of redeemers.  Adults, I wouldn't worry too much, though. After all, the kids in the movie are pretty extraordinary, and so is the situation.

The tv show was neat even though the stars were mutated humans, and the spy - weapons were really neat and interesting and makes you want some of them yourself.

The movie is about the Cortez family.  Mr. and Mrs. Cortez are retired international spies, but when an assignment comes up that makes them rethink retirement, they decide to take it leaving their kids with an uncle.  When things go wrong and they find themselves in danger, their kids take on the job of saving them, taking the movie on a wild ride.
The movie is great for a family to watch together because it teaches about how important family can be.  So while being entertaining and pure fun with excellent gadgets and gizmos along with special effects, it will teach you a thing or two.

1309232,2,B00003CXWJ,"** 1/2 I can certainly understand why ""Spy Kids"" has been such an enormous hit with children.  What is childhood fantasy, after all, but an attempt by essentially powerless youngsters to bring a little order to their world, to show themselves and the adults around them that they too are good for something - even if it's only saving the world from the forces of evil before it's time to come in to face chores, homework and bedtime.  Of course, children merely mimic the fantasies adults themselves indulge in - utilizing the same set of conventions that serve as the template for virtually all action/adventure films that have featured heroes on the order of James Bond, Rambo, and Arnold Schwarzenegger in his various fictional guises.  In many ways, the films featuring those characters demonstrate that many of us have still not outgrown the simplistic view of the world that fuels our earliest fantasies.  By making the heroes of this film specifically children, ""Spy Kids"" fulfills that need children have to feel that they too can be an active part of a power-conferring fantasy rather than just the passive observers they usually end up being in a real world controlled by adult concepts and adult rules.
Fair enough.  What I don't understand, though, is why adults seem to be so enamored of ""Spy Kids,"" which, for all its hullabaloo and hubbub, is really little more than a juvenile version of the same spy spoof nonsense that has been a staple of filmmaking since the 1960's (nicely resurrected by the ""Austin Powers"" films a few years back).  Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino star as Gregorio and Ingrid Cortez, two dashing former spies who have traded in the exciting world of field espionage for less glamorous ""desk jobs"" in the spy organization so that they can raise their two children, Carmen and Juni, in a more normal, less hectic and less dangerous environment.  Carmen and Juni, unaware of their parents' past, look upon them as two hopelessly nerdy representatives of an ""uncool"" older generation.  When Gregorio and Ingrid decide, after nine years out of commission, to get back into the secret agent business, they discover that some of their espionage skills have become a little rusty and they are instantly caught and imprisoned by a mad children's show producer bent on creating a race of indestructible children robots.  When Carmen and Juni discover the truth of their parents' identities and predicament, the two youngsters set off on a mission to singlehandedly rescue them from a fate worse than death.
One of the problems with ""Spy Kids"" is that it seems to mistake frenetic activity for humor and wit.  Through long stretches of the film, we are being hurtled through space in one imaginary vehicle after another as the children search desperately for their kidnapped parents.  There is, moreover, an awful lot of frantic running around by the various characters, but the result is, oddly, not excitement but rather tedium.  Because writer/director Robert Rodriguez has failed to provide any truly clever dialogue, he has been forced to rely far too heavily on the special effects to carry the day.  The result is that we are never particularly captivated by the antics either of the children or of the parents, who, I hasten to note, actually spend most of their time off screen.  When they are on screen, they often come across as arch, self conscious and cutesy, rather than smooth, suave and witty.  Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara, as the two children, are unremarkable but relatively likable screen presences.  At least they are not as cloying as their parents.
The art director, set decorator and production designer deserve mention for their superb work in creating a never-never land world caught somewhere between reality and fantasy, perfectly suitable for a film built on childhood imaginings.  It's too bad that the screenplay fails to consistently match that level of creativity.  Stand by for the inevitable sequel!",1005955200,5,3963,4.9787878787878785

(Until the big squishy ending)  Floop is a cross between Jack the Pumpkin King and Willy Wonka, and his theme song -- well, it's by Danny Elfman, so it sounds like every other song Danny Elfman ever wrote.  Most of the acting is good.  The exception would have to be the kid who plays Juni, who is possibly the worst child actor I have ever seen outside of a soap opera.  His delivery is poor, he does not emote well, and he isn't even one of those cute kids who can get by on looks.  The quality of the DVD is fine, but it's really lacking on extras.

And the two child stars are really unorthodox looking and quite a bit of fun...not at all typical, which is refreshing. The movie has cute gadgets, fun effects and is seldom too suspenseful, which is good for the youngest viewers.  It really is sort of like a James Bond movie for the pre-teen set.

In that way it is similar to Willy Wonka, but then it is so different.  Robert Rodriguez, best known for his hyper-violent films such as Desperado and From Dusk till Dawn, shows he is adept at handling light hearted and whimsical fare.  Spy Kids is a sort of modern fairy-tale beginning with ""Once upon a Time"", and finishing with a happy ending.  It is escapism for kids, and I was sucked in.  What kid didn't want to have cool gadgets and be the hero.  I know I did, and it reminded me of my childhood.  It is refreshing to see a pure family film that takes risks with its viewers, Rodriguez isn't satisfied to keep the film within conventional techniques, he makes it a visual feast while not disorienting the viewer in anyway.  On top of that, I found the bickering between the brother and sister to be really very funny; They definitely seemed like brother and sister, which was key of course.  The supporting performances were uniformly excellent.  Antonio Banderas and Alan Cumming both gave wonderfully eccentric performances.

1309663,4,B00003CXWJ,"This was one of my favorite movies of the year. It was an extremely well crafted kid's movie. It seemed to be made completely with kids in mind. Some jokes may not be funny to adults, but adults should still be able to respect the movie's craft for putting them in for the kids. I've heard many children say this was their favorite movie of the year. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because the DVD is not the Special Edition. The special edition was released in theaters August 8th I beleive. It only added one scene, in fact they only reprinted the last reel of the movie. Theaters got old copies of the movie except for the last reel. I loved the special edition though, it was worth seeing for the new scene, which was always inteded to be in the movie, but couldn't be completed due to lack of budget for the effects, until the movie was a hit and they could afford it. I'm not buying the DVD until a special edition is released, hopefully with commentary by Rodriguez. The new scene definately added another clever bit to the movie. They are in a cave full of sleeping sharks, and Juni has to pee badly, but Carmen warns him that sharks can only sleep where chemical levels are right in the water, and if he pees, it will wake them up. I want to own this movie on dvd badly, but it will just bug me to not see that scene every time i watch it, because it belongs there. Kids will still love the movie, I did before the special edition, but now it seems like that is the real edition, and the original is missing something.",998956800,7,1539,4.220338983050848
1309664,5,B00003CXWJ,"OK, if you are adult who either has or knows small kids, you have trudged off countless times to movie theaters to see a seemingly endless number of mediocre or bad children's films, usually not daring to hope for a genuinely good movie, usually at most praying for a bearable one.  I went to see SPY KIDS with a three-year-old boy and his mother, and I am delighted to report that I think I enjoyed the film every bit as much as he did.
The film was directed and scripted by Robert Rodriguez, whose first film, EL MARIACHI was one of the most promising independent film debuts of all time.  The movie displays enormous creativity, invention, humor, and imagination.  It is also a visual delight, easily one of the most visually arresting films I have ever seen, and competes with BABE and WHAT DREAMS MAY COME for the most pleasantly colorful film I have ever seen.  The Art Direction was just splendid, and I will be very much surprised if, when they announce the nominations for the Oscars next year, SPY KIDS isn't nominated in that category.
Several of the actors did a fine job in this one, but my favorite might have been Alan Cumming.  I am intrigued by actors who can play either sinister and scheming characters or sympathetic and likable ones.  In his career, Cumming has been the former far more often than the latter (see CIRCLE OF FRIENDS and GOLDENEYE for the former, and ROMY AND MICHELE'S HIGH SCHOOL REUNION for the latter).  In this film he gets to be both.
So, for those of you with small kids who need a movie to see, you won't do better than SPY KIDS.  And if you don't have any kids to go see flicks with, see it anyway!",997315200,4,1643,4.4352159468438535

It was sort of a James Bond meets Star Trek and Blues Clues, all wrapped into one.  And it was entirely appropriate viewing for children--provided they are old enough to distinguish make-believe from reality.  If your child cannot make that distinction, yet, then they may become frightened by some of the make-believe characters and/or situations such as being kidnapped and taken to a cartoonish-type place.
The plot is a noble one--two children risk all to rescue their parents.  Unbeknownst to them until now, their parents were spies.  And now they've been kidnapped.  These children use their parents' spy equipment and their own ingenuity and bravery to rescue their parents.  But the best feature of this entire film is the underlying message that family is very important.

Once you get past the premise that ""it's a dumb kid's movie"" and watch it for what it is, you'll find yourself enjoying it.  The movie's got all the elements of a good movie: humor, action, a little romance, funny villains and of course heroes.  Oh, and since it's a ""family movie,"" there's even a little lesson in here about ""the value of a family.""  How can it go wrong?
The action sequences, while not Jackie Chan or even Bruce Willis, are acceptable -- it's a kids movie.  The villains are actually pretty decent (albeit laughable, or even lovable).  Keep in mind this is a kid's movie.  They're tons of ""mutated"" villains that they fight.  The spy gadgets are even better, almost in the James Bond vain, but of course, in a kids sorta way.

This is a movie that parents should take their kids to see and then the kids should take their parents.  There is a great message of the importance of family, and where everyone fits in.  The performances are very good and the script is well written.  I give big thumbs up to Rodriquez who does everything for his films.

And I was most impressed by the two kids. (the actors' names escape me right now)  They really behave and seem to be siblings.  Great performances, guys.
