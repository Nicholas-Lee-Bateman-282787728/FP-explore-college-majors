7932708,3,B000056VYS,"Video quality is OK, looks like it was converted to DVD from a commercial VHS tape. American commentators are AWFUL and make non-stop ""gay"" jokes. Thankfully, Japanese commentary is an option in the language menu. Matches were average, but fine as an introduction to FMW's lineup from 95-96. Wrestler entrances are not included, although introductory interviews are and stupid vignettes with the commentators between matches.",1237593600,,425,5.553846153846154
7932709,1,B000056VYS,"I was highly disappointed with this dvd. The comentators were the worst ive ever heard, and the matches were not great. The hardcore matches were clipped and had no point to really watch them. They brag about being ""hardcore"" but there wasn't too much ""hardcore"" action. A few good matches here, but very short. Hayabusa is an exciting wrestler, but not as good as RVD. Sorry ""julabard"". The main event piting him against Awesome, was disappointing. Its partly the reason why I bought the dvd. I did like Super Leather though. Id like to see more of him. Not a really ""hardcore"" dvd, will have to look elsewhere.",1172448000,3,612,4.675925925925926
7932710,4,B000056VYS,"I have seen FMW in ECW over the years, but not genuine Japanese FMW.  ECW fans will love seeing the familiar faces ; Mike Awsome (2 matches) ; Masato Tanaka (2 matches) ; Kanemura (2 matches)and Hayabusa (3 matches).  The Tanaka vs. Awsome is another classic, if not as bone crunching as the ECW Awsome vs. Tanaka fights.  Hayabusa is as entertaining as ever, providing FMW's equivalent of RVD.  There are 2 barb wire matches ; the first with barb wire ropes and flaming torches, the 2nd with barb wire boards in the corners.  Now - the badness.  The comentators are rubbish and come over as gays, which is not good.  The promos, with exception of Awsome's are in Japanese with subtitles.  Sum it up?  A good example of FMW, but a little boring in places, and not up to the class of ECW.",994204800,,787,4.409722222222222
7932711,3,B000056VYS,"FMW has demonstrated a dismaying fondness for clipping huge chunks out of their matches, disrupting the flow and probably depriving the viewer of some great spots. This volume trims a 12-minute barbed wire board and bat match to a little over 4 minutes. The fire death match (the ring ropes are replaced with barbed wire and rows of torches) is also trimmed to less than half its original length. The tape does feature 3 in-their-entirety matches of Japanese superstar Hayabusa, so I'll give it 3 stars. But FMW and Tokyopop should give us fewer matches and deliver them whole. Particularly the gimmick matches, which is FMW's main selling point.",989193600,,646,4.935779816513762
7932712,4,B000056VYS,"FMW is the true Fontier of Japanese Wrestling. Ledgends such as Hayabusa, Mike Awesome and Masato Tanka tear the scene apart in this video. I recommend this video for those who like Hardcore Wrestling and also enjoy learning to speak Japanese. This video is Hardcore and can be replayed over and over again to quench your Hardcore thirst.",982022400,,338,4.844827586206897
7932713,3,B000056VYS,"I wish this could be a glowing review of the two new FMW  dvd's.  I had been anticipating the release and wondering  what matches would be included.  I got them both on  Wednesday and the verdict is ho-hum.  Both highlight the  tournament in 1995-96 for the FMW World Title, culminating with Mike ""Gladiator"" Awesome vs. The Falcon.  Both DVD's  feature a main event of the two in different matches, but their match on Legend Dawns is so much better.  Overall, these two DVD;s are worth the price but not the best effort from TokyoPop.",981936000,,535,4.595744680851064
