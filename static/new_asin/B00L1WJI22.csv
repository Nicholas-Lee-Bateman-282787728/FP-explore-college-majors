Cardcaptor Sakura The Movie 1 Blu-Ray - Official U.S. release!

The video quality is the same as its Japanese counterpart - Even though the Japanese Blu-Rays always have a much higher bitrate than U.S. BDs, I didn't notice any differences. The Japanese version is 26GB and the US version is 20GB. I think the only differences is how large the Japanese audio tracks tend to be (like 3GB for DTS HD Master Audio). I need to check into that but comparing the videos alone, it all looks the same throughout.

There are 4 audio tracks:
2 Japanese: DTS HD Master Audio 5.1 surround and Linear PCM 2.0 Stereo

2 English: Dolby Digital 448kbps 5.1 and 192kbps 2.0 Stereo - Too bad the dub didn't get a lossless track.

The translation of the subtitles is very accurate and the sentences just flow smoothly - I did some digging of my old Pioneer DVD and it seems that Discotek has recycled Pioneer's translation word by word.

And you get the same extras that came in the Japanese version(with optional subtitles as well), plus the English Dub trailers!

Overall, I give this a 9.5/10 because the dub wasn't lossless, but this is a steal for 18 dollars. The Japanese Blu-Ray for this movie is 75 bucks.

Discotek Media, you deserve a pat on the back! Good job!",1415145600,8,1374,4.48995983935743
6461041,5,B00L1WJI22,This is an awesome movie from probably the greatest anime ever made. the subbing is well done. the only downside is that the english dub is the nelvana dub...so if you're a dub fan...then its fine,1413244800,2,196,4.472222222222222
6461042,5,B00L1WJI22,"The bluray version is on Rightstuf if you are looking for that. I have the original version, so I already know the movie is excellent. Unlike the series bluray I have no idea if any art booklet or anything like that comes with this, we may have to wait till October to find out.",1409097600,,278,4.166666666666667

6461087,5,B00L1WJI22,This item was a gift for my daughter. I guess she really liked it the only thing I can advise you of this product is to make sure your DVD Blu-ray drive is up to date I did not know also that you had to be connected somewhat to the internet in order to obtain all the movie options I guess it was some kind of security or authentication program to be able to view the movie and prove that it was not a pirated copy.,1440892800,2,415,3.8372093023255816
6461088,3,B00L1WJI22,"1) I was glad that it had the original ""CardCaptors"" voice cast in this 1st movie, but I still don't know why Shaoran Li's voice (Rhys Huber) was changed during some of the episodes during the TV adaptation? 2) I don't get why the original U.S. DVD release stated that the time length was 128 minutes where this one was reduced to 80 minutes. 3) It seems like this version was the cut version instead of the Un-cut one, and 4) Dialogue and characters names not changed back to the original anime story. If the cast members dialogue had stayed true to the original TV series dialogue, the original names, plus un-edited. The movie would've been much better. I don't have a lot more left to say. Out the two movies for this series, if I had to pick my favorite movie either #1 or #2. I say that number 2 is my top favorite because it deals with both Sakura and Shaoran's feeling for each other. Meaning Sakura's feelings for Shaoran. If the second movie could see an official U.S. re-release on Blu-Ray with the ""Kero-chan"" video short, for the first time, that would make me really happy.",1434931200,2,1087,4.467336683417085

6461091,5,B00L1WJI22,"i had seen this movie once before, but that was in standard def. when I say this on amazon for about $20, on Blu-ray no less, I could not pass it up, since it was a steel for some one like me who collects anime on Blu-ray. the video quality is just out of this world. if you enjoy anime in general, and are willing to pay a bit more for better quality, then I would suggest betting this, just not that tis only comes with the Blu-ray, unlike some other that are Blu-ray/dvd combos.",1422144000,4,481,4.073684210526316
6461092,5,B00L1WJI22,I love Cardcaptor Sakura so much so having the first movie on blu-ray is so wonderful.,1418774400,,86,4.4375
6461093,3,B00L1WJI22,"Great movie, but unfortunately for a brand new release, it still uses the names from the 14 year old English Dub that KidsWB used. The new TV Series Blu-rays use all the original names. Different voices are a little jarring but that's to be expected when different companies do the releases, but it would have been nice for a new dub with the original names in them.",1415577600,3,366,4.477611940298507
8663172,3,B00L1WJI22,can only view it 5 times. so disappointing,1531008000,,42,4.375
8663173,5,B00L1WJI22,"Beautiful HD transfer. For what it's worth, they could've upped the bitrate a little more just to clear out a little bit of the video compression, but for being an older animated film, the AVC encoding of this Blu-ray is pretty good. Audio quality is great too. From a narrative standpoint, as a fan of the Cardcaptor Sakura series myself, the story and some of the interactions felt a little forced, but this is a very enjoyable film nonetheless. The second movie arguably has a better plot and conflict-resolution. I definitely recommend this to all North American CCS fans out there.",1523750400,,586,4.811881188118812

8663175,5,B00L1WJI22,"If you grew up with the Americanized WB's Cardcaptors television series, you'll love this movie! The voice actors are the same. I recently fell in love with the dubbed Cardcaptor Sakura series and I had to have this movie. This movie is set to be in between episodes 35 (Sakura's Wonderful Christmas) and episode 36 (Sakura and the Snowy New School Term). I know there are some reviewers who are upset because of all the different voice changes but if you're new to the series it really doesn't matter. I think the whole plot is fantastic and so are the characters. A must watch movie and series!",1517184000,,596,4.579439252336448
8663176,5,B00L1WJI22,Fantastic condition. I loved that it had an English dub and English subs. Subs were a much better translation than the dub was.,1503964800,,127,4.565217391304348

8663178,5,B00L1WJI22,Love this movie. Used to have it on VHS a long time ago and I realized I had no way to watch it anymore. Got it on DVD instead. Good quality video!,1491091200,,147,3.625
8663179,5,B00L1WJI22,"A re-release of the old DVD edition of the CCS movie. Good quality and what you'd expect.

If you're not familiar with Cardcaptor Sakura, this movie won't do much for you. I believe the intention is to watch is after you've seen the series already and are comfortable with character knowledge and the details of the show. That being said, I love all that the world of Cardcaptor has to offer. The characters are endearing, and the story is always moving. This isn't the butchered stuff aired on saturday morning cartoons in the US, but the actual movie that was aired in Japan.

Enjoy!",1464480000,4,585,4.615384615384615
