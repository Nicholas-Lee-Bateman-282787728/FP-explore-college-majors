1359494,4,B00004W3HE,"One of the few pulpy movies that survived the 1950s Sputnik/Atomic glut of monster scares to become a true classic, The Blob comes to us on a packed, digitally pristine Criterion DVD.  With a compelling commentary and a supurb transfer, The Blob never looked better.  Really.
Starring B-Movie-Meister Steve McQueen as a 35-year-old high school student, The Blob details the adventures of a pile of Jell-O stranded on Earth after its spaceship, which looks like a pockmarked bowling ball, crash-lands outside of Smallville, USA.  The Blob exists to do nothing but eat people, which leads to a slight interplanetary misunderstanding after it begins devouring the denizens of the town.  McQueen and the girl he was trying to score with at the local ""parking"" place are the only two who know what's going on, and attempt to convince the town's adults, obviously influenced by propaganda films such as Reefer Madness, that a lump of cheesy monster effect is really eating everyone and growing larger.
From the campy music to the campy dialogue, The Blob practically oozes the essence of films like Plan 9 and Them!.  Criterion has seen fit to give us a worthy addition to their library and ours, offering two commentary tracks and a transfer that makes the movie look and sound like it just came out of Skywalker Ranch.  They also pack the case - literally - with an extremely thick (and entertaining) book, and a smallish, folded movie poster.  And, of course, the usual Criterion ""colored bars"" option.
As far as discs go, this one is highly recommended, for the content as well as the obvious care taken with bringing this film to the DVD format.  Sci-Fi fans and movie fans alike will want to add this release to their collection.",1003276800,17,1729,4.857142857142857
1359495,5,B00004W3HE,"I picked this up as a gift for my son, and am quite glad that I did. This movie is a true classic, and Criterion's crisp print and amusing extras made this disc worthwhile.",997228800,,172,4.088235294117647
1359496,5,B00004W3HE,"My brother purchased ""The Blob"" on DVD through Amazon.com as a Christmas gift for me.  What a present it turned out to be!  Criterion did a bang-up job on restoring this paradigm of Sci-Fi B movies.  In my opinion, THE BLOB is the best of that genre.  Finally, you can see the bright red menace of the Blob in all its terrorizing power.  The DVD version puts to shame all of those substandard VHS versions that are out there on the market.  You won't find any fuzziness or scratchy sound in the DVD version.  This DVD version is exactly the way I remembered ""The Blob"" as I saw it at the Town theater back in Baltimore, Maryland during 1958.",978739200,7,641,4.336134453781512
1359497,2,B00004W3HE,"Of course, Steve McQueen's blue car will never be so shiny on your screen thanks to the most praised Criterion treatment. Of course, the blob has never been so ugly red. I admit it, this DVD is gorgeous and I'm glad to have it in my library. But, believe me, I won't watch this movie again before long. Because, it's not a good movie. Even if I'm aware that it's a B movie and that I must only see the second degree of director Irvin S. Yeaworth's film.
Christian Nyby and Howard Hawks's THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD was also a B movie, shot 7 years earlier in black & white, but was way better than the 1958 BLOB. Unless you consider THE BLOB  as a comic movie with its dialogs so politically correct and stupid. In short, if you're a fan of american sci-fi movies of the 50's, I'm sure that you already have this Criterion presentation in your library. If you're looking for a good rental or if you're only curious, try it but if you think that the Criterion stamp is enough to assure the DVD eternity to any movies, you shall be disappointed.
A DVD zone blob fans only.",976492800,7,1072,4.280788177339901
1359498,4,B00004W3HE,"My rating may be a bit biased. The four stars were given to the film itself and not on the quality of its DVD, which is due to the fact that I'm writing this review on Oct. 18th and not after the mentioned street date of Oct. 31st. But all blunders aside, I can't wait for this disc to be released just so I can hear the commentary of Bruce Eder.  For those who dare to stand up and champion this current innovation in entertainment know that the name Bruce Eder is synonymous with quality. All sarcasm aside, Mr. Eder, who current occupation is listed as film historian, never fails as a fascinating listen. Just hearing his commentary on other Criterion films such as Brief Encounter and The Lady Vanishes, you are installed with a new appreciation for the film. Mr. Eder injects a myriad of information such as the background of the involved artists and the current social climate at the time the film was released. Anyone who has the slightest interest in films, beyond its current intention as an ice-breaker for young heterosexual couples out on a night of romance, will hopefully see this film not only as campy entertainment but as a possible learning tool as well.",971827200,3,1173,4.585714285714285
1359499,3,B00004W3HE,"So this is it, Steve McQueen is introduced to the DVD criterion collection. Why does it have to be the blob? Of course this movie is not so  bad but being a true mcqueen fan I must admit that I'm very disapointed by  Criterion. They're putting out the blob but they could have put great  mcqueens like The Sand Pebbles of An enemy of the people but no they put  out the thrash and they don't even include extra goodies with it.

1359512,5,B00004W3HE,"The Criterion Collection version of The Blob is worth the purchase as they took great effort to give you al the DVD goodies that enhance your viewing pleasure. Be aware that there are other DVD and VHS versions that are not up to par.

Steve McQueen as Steve Andrews and Anete Corsaut as Jane Martin (also Helen Crump in The Andy Griffith Show) are supposed to be teenagers; they are negotiating in a quiet parking place in a convertible, when a shooting star lands quite close. Naturally this is more interesting to them than what they were about to do; so they go to investigate. An old man gets to the site first and poking around with a stick gets blobulated. And maybe his little dog too. Things really get sticky from that point with no one to believe them as kids don't know nothing.

If you like this movie then the next one to see is a variation called ""Killer Klowns from Outer Space"" It takes the same theme to absurdity.",1502409600,,932,4.412790697674419

1359533,5,B00004W3HE,"PLOT: teenagers discover the killer alien.

Teenager Steven (STEVE MCQUEEN)  is ""necking"" with girl friend Jane at lover's lane. They go looking for a shooting star. They come across an old man who has a badly injured hand. The old man has his hand covered in a jelly like substance which appears to be ""growing"" and it is colored dark red. As the RED ""blob"" grows AND is consumes the old man then....  the doctor and his nurse. Steven views the demise of the doctor through a window but no one will believe him. Jane and Steve are soon out after curfew looking for the ""blob monster"" which they find in a Grocery store but avoid death by hiding in the cold meat locker. The blob next ends up at the local movie theater where it oozes it way to the town square and covers a diner. It is both growing and consuming. A power line is dropped on the diner to kill it..the resulting,  small fires are put out with CO2 the blob does not like it...and a way to KILL the monster is discovered. HOKEY? of course but one of the best thrills from the scream monster era. Steven McQueen is actually about 28 but is great as the ""teenager"" is not afraid of a monster from red glob BLOB from outer space. The Criterion copy is very good and clear. Worth the money to see it the way it needs to be seen. 5 STARS all the way. Look for the Marquee with Bela Lugosi movies as the midnight show. FUN.",1477785600,,1381,4.21969696969697
1359534,2,B00004W3HE,"The Blob, 1958 film

A young man and woman are sitting outside of town. They hear a whistling sound and see a bright object fall to earth. A dog barks, a man walks outside with a lantern. There is something in the rock, it gets on his hand. That old man asks to be taken to a doctor. Who is he? [There is no request for a co-payment for medical insurance.] Three young men are by Steves convertible, they want a race. Backwards! A police car arrives to question Steve. No more horseplay says Dave the policeman. The doctors find the swelling on the patients hand is spreading. Dr. Allen calls his nurse, he may have to amputate. The young people go to the North Road to investigate. The hear the dog and find the kerosene lantern outside. The patient disappeared! The Blob absorbed him! They throw acid on it. The doctor goes for his gun, nurse Kate screams! Steve and Jane return to the doctor, the place is dark.

They go and report to the police. Doctor Allen was killed! Steve says the mass keeps getting bigger. The police must go to check it out. The remaining policeman plays chess over the radio. The police arrive and find an empty house. Mrs. Porter arrives and talks to the police; she wants to clean up the mess. Elsewhere two auto mechanics talk about a hunting trip (where theyll be drinking). Then one screams! The fathers arrive at the police station for their children. The police will wait for morning and daylight. But Steve and Jane leave their homes in the night. Steve tells Jane he saw what happened to the doctor. Can people be warned? Can they find people to help them? Steve finds his three friends, they are at a horror movie (80 cents admission). Steve tells he saw that thing kill Doctor Allen. The police learn of a deserted business. They go around to warn people but are not believed. They visit a store and see the Blob! They flee.

Steve and Jane hide in the butchers freezer (we see sides of meat but no visible breath from them). Can they get away? Yes, they call the police. The sirens sound a warning around the town. Steve tells the people to drive home slowly. Do they have any guns? Get them. That market is empty. They hear screams from the people running away from the movie theater! The Blob moves around. The police will drop a power line on it so the electricity will kill it. It didn't work. The diner is on fire! They discover the Blob cant stand cold. CO2 fire extinguishers are gathered. The cars arrive with the fire extinguishers. There is a telephone call to Washington. They will send a big airplane to drop the Blob in the Arctic so it will never thaw. And so it ends.

There are two many dark scenes that distract from this low-budget movie. It is as best an average story and not too scary. The use of teenagers says it was to attract this audience. That horror movie in town featured Bela Lugosi who played in many horror movies in the 1930s and 1940s (he is best known for Dracula the classic vampire movie. The Eisenhower Recession of 1957 was followed by horror movies, so too the Ford Recession of 1974 (Jaws). That doctors office is in his home, the rule in those days. The nurse did not ask for a payment up front; things are different today. Did the 1968 movie The Night of the Living Dead echo this story?",1477267200,,3271,4.410596026490066

1359536,5,B00004W3HE,"I especially love the commentary from ""Shorty"" Yeaworth  & Jack Harris. Criterion did a nice job of putting this DVD together. Bought it partially because I've always been a very big fan of Steve McQueen. Hard to believe that a director who mainly made religious films back in 1958 could team with a relatively unknown McQueen and make such a cult classic.  While some may point to much more serious performances by McQueen in later movies I think The Blob is by far the most fun. Don't forget that catchy theme song !!",1476662400,4,519,4.56989247311828

1359614,3,B00004W3HE,"One of the sci-fi classics from the late 50s, The Blob is a guilty pleasure of mine.  It features an early screen appearance by the great Steve McQueen, playing a high school kid even though he was twenty-nine at the time.  The female lead is Aneta Corsaut, better known for her portrayal of Sheriff Andy Taylor's girl (and Opie's teacher) Helen Crump on The Andy Griffith Show. The film is quite a snapshot of Eisenhower era life, where the worst thing kids did was drag race their cars.  The Blob arrives in a meteorite and starts attacking people with an absorbing passion, eventually sopping up dozens of local folks; the Blob is one hungry gob of goo.  Of course, only the teens in the small Pennsylvania town seem to know what is going on, and have a hard time convincing the grown ups that something is up.  There is tension between the kids and the cops of course, particularly the ""hard nosed"" cop whose wife was killed in an accident involving teens racing their cars. From today's CG standpoint, the film's effects are a bit laughable, but the story is the star of this thriller, and it is a fine add to the sci-fi collector's video library.",1445472000,6,1152,4.545893719806763

 Notice how the character played by McQueen as alienated teenager becomes the hero. Somethings never change.
 Special effects are cheesy but actually pretty good for the time (1950s).

 Now, I have a personal request from Criterion. Why not restore another 1950s horror classic with a alienated teenager lead. Of course I'm referring to Michael Landon in "" I Was a Teenage Werewolf"". Which was his debut, also.

They find an old farmer with a jelly like substance on his hand and take him to a doctor.  From that point on things get worse. The teen agers have a hard time getting the adults to believe them.

1359775,5,B00004W3HE,"Steve McQueen was in his late 20s when he starred in The Blob but you can't help but think he looks much older. He had that old school Hollywood characteristic of looking much older than any 28 year-old man of today, but ultimately looking completely believable in any role he grabbed. Though it was his first starring role, and the picture might not be the best film ever made or anything, he definitely knew how to command the screen.

I grew up in a household where science-fiction pictures (especially B-esque pictures) were welcomed with open arms. I have many memories of watching War of the Worlds (1953), Forgotten Planet (1954), and of course, The Blob. I lived in the Tampa Bay area during my childhood, and during that time, a local television host (aptly named Dr. Paul Bearer) who used to show many of these types of pictures on Saturday afternoons. It was my film school, before film school.

But back to The Blob. The film centers on two teenagers (McQueen and Aneta Corsaut) witnessing a shooting star crashing down a few miles away from them. It lands close to a local hermit living in solitude in the woods, where he soon discovers the rock that crashed. Upon further investigation, the rock cracks open, unleashing a strange ooze that soon envelopes the old man's arm. He rushes to the aid of the teenagers, who bring him to a local doctor. Once there, the ooze continues to spread before fully covering the man. It then gets bigger and bigger, before continuing to devoir some of the town's citizens.

The film, though not understandable upon first viewing, is layered in paranoia. Steve (played by McQueen of course) is the only person who sees this red/pink menace, and only his girlfriend seems to believe him. None of the other townspeople seem to take his word for it (as the story of a blob consuming people is rather strange) even though everyone in this small town knows he isn't a kid known for lying or pulling pranks. Some have written about the subtle context to communism but I am just not sure that the filmmakers really had that in mind during the time of production.

I only saw this movie once during my childhood (probably around 6 or 7) but I remember definitely being creeped out by the giant mass of murdering ooze. Upon another viewing now in my adulthood however, my mind is pretty perplexed as to how that could have even been an issue.

Just like all of their other blu-ray releases, Criterion did a phenomenal job with the transfer. The images are crisp and the sound is flawless (as flawless as sound from that time period can be of course). Perhaps the best extra on the disc would be a collection of props and collectables from Blob fanatic Wes Shank. He seems to have it all, including the original blob itself.

The Blob is also just as short as it needs to be without over staying its welcome (unlike current disguised Hollywood B-pictures that never seem to end). And the ending perhaps deserves the most conversation. After the town learns the only to stop the blob is to freeze it, it is then sent somewhere to the Artic. Lt. Dave seems to think that they have it stopped by sending it there, but Steven knows better. He says, ""As long as the Artic stays cold,"" followed by a ""The End"" title which transforms into a question mark. Could this have been a message from the past about global warming?

This is one of those movies about teenagers where none of the lead characters are played by actors who look anything at all like teenagers. Steve McQueen looks 30ish to me (I think I read somewhere he was 27).

Man, I love that theme song.  So jaunty and fun for a horror movie.  Also just stupid catchy.  There's no way it leaves your head the rest of the day after you hear it even one time.

Anyways, to some ""The Blob"" might seem like an odd choice for Criterion (though not nearly as weird as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Armageddon/dp/6305311463/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Armageddon</a>, imho), but hear me out.  Yes, this is a cheapo drive in flick from the 50's, and at no point is that not apparent.  There are times when the effects really do show the low budget and on the surface its a story filled with cliches and stock characters...

BUT!!!!!!

As drive in flicks from the 50's go, this is absolutely one of the BEST you could ever hope to watch.  It has an original monster, surprisingly good acting (though the little kid in this thing is just awful, far worse than even the one in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robot-Monster/dp/B00004Y7GR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robot Monster</a>) and great writing, with some honestly surprising depth for its characters.

As someone whos seen literally dozens of cheapo sci-fi and horror movies from the 50's, let me assure you the above mentioned qualities are rare attributes in and of themselves (many movies have NONE of the above), to find all of them in one movie really is special and makes for a highly pleasurable viewing experience.

The acting and the monster speak for themselves.  Allow me to expand on the great writing.  The movie hits the ground running and just keeps moving from start to finish, so the pacing is excellent.  The attention to detail is great too (notice how the blob starts clear then turns a deeper and deeper red the more people it absorbs?  Pretty gross, eh?).  But the most impressive thing is the subtle character shades the script gives its cast.

Again, on the surface, its all stock characters and cliches.  There have been plenty of films with juvenile delinquents, teen-hating cops, goody-two-shoes heroes with a story no-one believes, etc.  But take a closer look at the characters in the Blob.  How many films feature hot-rodding JDs with a strong enough sense of civic responsibility where they actually leave the movie they're at to go warn the neighbors about the monster?  How many angry, teen-hating cops get a legitimate reason provided for their suspicions (the police sgt's wife was killed by a 17yr old driver) and yet tow the line and follow orders anyway, out of a sense of duty?  How many monster movie heroes, after having no one believe their story, start to DOUBT themselves and actually QUESTION if they really did see what they thought they had?

All these wrinkles (and more, there were many moments I didn't list) add surprising depth to a movie that honestly doesn't *need* to have it to work.  This is a film, afterall, about a living ball of ooze that kills people by absorbing them, plenty of drive-in flicks made money by promising and doing much less than ""The Blob"" ever did, but those flicks didn't get the Criterion treatment, did they?

""The Blob"" stands as one of the finest drive-in flicks of its kind.  If that doesn't sound like high praise, see if for yourself.  You'll have a good time, I assure you.

The Criterion DVD of ""The Blob"" has a really slick anamorphic widescreen transfer with great color and sound.  The extras are a tad slim, but one can't expect a ton of bonus features for a 50's drive-in horror movie.  My favorite DVD feature, though, is the fact that the movie's theme song plays on an endless loop over the DVD menu.  I can just let it play and play and play... No seriously, you'll understand why that's a good thing when you hear it.",1369872000,2,3837,4.956181533646323

As someone who loves this film, I have it on old VHS somewhere and on DVD, and I even own the poster. Great so far, but ...
When I saw it was coming out on blu-ray, knowing it was a Criterion property, I assumed they'd be charging top dollar. I also expected, based on Criterion's reputation, top quality.
Sorry, but if you own the DVD, do not bother doubling up for the blu-ray.
I don't know what the other reviewers are seeing or if many have closely compared the two versions, but on my large flat screen, there is little difference between the DVD and blu-ray versions.
When I pop in a blu-ray I expect a perfect picture. Yes, I'm willing to cut them slack when it comes to older movies like this, but regardless of the quality of the original print, if a company cannot produce a blu-ray offering a significantly superior picture to the DVD version, other than profit, what's the point?
If you don't own the DVD, then consider the blu-ray, especially because The Blob is not aired often. You might want to consider setting up a price alert or waiting for a sale rather than spending $30-$35, however.",1364688000,8,1375,4.417322834645669

1359839,4,B00004W3HE,"Ever since digital media entered our living rooms through the introduction of laser discs one distributor has stood out as a leader in quality. This extended beyond the technical specifications to the cinematic and cultural value of the film itself; the Criterion Collection. Many cinephiles associate films in this collection with cutting edge independent and foreign movies but in recent years has expanded the scope of their selection process to include films that are certifiably fan favorites. Criterion still retains their commitment to excellence in the audio and video standards move from laser discs through DVD and currently releasing Blu-ray titles. Concurrent with keeping up with the latest technical standards their broader view of classic films now includes movies that were part of our youth, the ones that instilled in many of us a lifelong dedication to enjoying movies. For those of us counted as constituents of the Baby Boomer generation much of our appreciation for movies began with Saturday afternoon matinees. Along with the cartoon, newsreel and action serial was a feature, usually science fiction of horror in many cases the two genres were blended most notably in a type of flick lovingly referred as a creature feature. Usually something would arrive from outer space or emerge from a radioactive test site or laboratory that would threaten life as we know it. One of my all-time favorites from my childhood was a little movie about a giant mass of gelatin that begins to devour a small town; `The Blob'. Now I'm referring to the classic 1958 original not the 1988 remake. When I received a notice that this childhood memory would be added to the ranks of the much lauded Criterion Collection I was overjoyed. Not that long ago a true American Horror standard `Rosemary's Baby' was included on the list. That movie has long been hailed as pivotal, helping to define the genre. Some might consider the Criterion Collect rather esoteric, targeted to the festival circuit crowd. The inclusion of `The Blob' demonstrates they have an eclectic view of movies; one that includes the cultural attachments firmed with the audience. This movie is notable for several reasons but at the top of the list has to be memories of good times in the neighborhood theater.
One thing my late wife and I always noticed about these movies is hoe the teenagers all seemed in their thirties. It was just something about how actors of the era looked and carried themselves but it always stood, particularly in this movie. `The Blob' starts in the darkness of the local lover's lane where a couple was parked. In typical fashion the guy, Steve Andrews (Steve McQueen) was less inclined to stop than his date, Jane Martin (Aneta Corsaut). At this time McQueen was already establishing himself in both TV and film and just before his breakout role in the iconic western, `The Magnificent Seven'. Fans of vintage television will recognize Ms Corsaut as Sheriff' Andy's girlfriend in `Mayberry'. This was her screen debut. While rebuking his advances the amorous interlude is disrupted by what looked to be a `shooting star'. Realizing it landed nearby Steve's hormonal drive is over whelmed by curiosity and the couple head out to investigate. Meanwhile, an old man (Olin Howland) stumbles across a spherical rock and proceeds to poke it with a stick. A good piece of life advice here is never poke a meteorite with a stick. The rational becomes evident when the rock breaks in half; a red goop speeding up the stick to cover his hand; it quickly spreads painfully up his arm.  The Steve and Jane find the old man and decide to take him to Doc Hallen (Stephen Chase). Leaving him in the care of the doctor and his nurse, Kate (Lee Payton) the kids return to the site of the crash to investigate what it might be. Once they leave the blob consumes the old man and unsated proceeds to go for the doctor and nurse. There is a tug on the heart strings of the audience through the introduction of a small dog into the mix that Jane promises to her younger brother, Danny (Keith Almoney).
Steve and his friends are well known to the local law for their pranks. Steve was just caught drag racing in reverse so when tries to convince the cops about a flesh eating goo from outer space they find it difficult to believe. Sgt. Jim Bert (John Benson) is especially feed up with these troublesome kids but his boss, Lt. Dave (Earl Rowe) is more understanding. Unable to get the police to respond Steve and the other teens take it upon themselves to rally the town against the rapidly growing amorphous creature. They have little success alerting the disinterested adults but when the Blob oozes through the projection booth of the local movie house during a midnight screening of a horror flick. The follow it to a supermarket owned by Jane's father avoiding certain death by taking cover in the meat locker. Little Danny tries to shoot the creature with a cap gun while dressed in footy PJs, a real blast from the fifties, and the Blob chases the boy into a diner. Jane and Steve go after them but by point the Blob is huge; enveloping the entire building. In the climactic scene Steve realizes cold stops the creature and has his friends break into the High School to gather as many CO2 fire extinguishers as possible. Finally the Air force scoops the frozen Blob up dumping it in the Artic.
This movie did have a lot of notable features in it. One was the campy theme song `Beware the Blob' which was written by soon to be famous composer, Burt Bacharach. The pacing of the film was typical of the fifties creature features targeted to teens watching movies like this in drive-ins and local theaters. It was before the grind house era and therefore not overtly gory although it did possess a solid narrative. Another popular trope is the kids save the day. The teens watching greatly enjoyed watching their own generation saving their parents. It was the ingenuity of Steve, though by most to be a trouble maker, to figure out how to save the town. Finally a plot device that was extremely common in the fifties the U.S. military there to defending against any menace whether from across the seas or beyond the stars. Now available as a pristine, remastered high definition release we can revisit this classic part of our youth better than it was ever seen before.",1363996800,2,6357,4.779090909090909

1359842,4,B00004W3HE,"While I hadn't seen this movie in years, I remember it fondly from my youth. This is one of those that I saw several times on Friday Night Fright TV. Unfortunately I've been stuck with a VHS copy until now with Criterion's Blu ray update.  The best that can be said about the film is that it represents the ""B"" movie genre of the day in good fashion. Bad acting prevails. I don't recognize any of the actors either by name or by face with the obvious exception of Steve McQueen.

McQueen got a lot of recognition for his role as ""Steve"" and became a breakout star on TV and in the movies. The special effects are nothing special. Essentially an object falls from space and lands in a rural part of Pennsylvania.  After some poking and prodding, an ooze is released and slithers its way into town.  As it grows it becomes even more menacing.  That's pretty much it other than Steve and the other teens lead the battle against The Blob.  The film has a certain cult status and is fun to watch. The Blob was remade thirty years later as an R rated horror film starring Kevin Dillon and Shawnee Smith.

The Blu ray is a dramatic upgrade over the tape of course and from what I remember on TV.  I've not seen the DVD version that I recall.  Criterion transfers the film with a 1080p resolution and uses a 1.67:1 aspect ratio.  The restoration looks great.  Rich colors prevail and the close ups look natural.  Clarity is excellent including the many scenes shot in low light.  I could detect no effects of aging (scratches, floating debris, etc.)  This is really well done.

The audio has only an uncompressed LPCM mono track available.  It has been nicely cleaned up and is clear with good range.  This film also features an early collaboration between Hal David and Burt Bacharach on the title song.  Extras are generous including 2 commentaries.  One features the producer and the other the director, Irvin S. Yeaworth Jr. There is also a trailer, an essay by film critic Kim Newman and a host of memorabilia called ""Blobabilia."" I really like this movie but can't rate it much more than 3 stars from a production perspective.

1359848,4,B00004W3HE,"WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS Up until now nostalgia would have been the main reason to revisit this minor horror classic, perhaps also to see a poignantly fresh-faced Steve McQueen in one of his first starring film roles, and to hear one of Burt Bacharach's earliest hit tunes under the opening credits (which he jokingly disowned when I saw him on stage a few years ago). McQueen and co-star Aneta Corsaut are quite convincing as teenagers, even though they were well into their twenties when ""The Blob"" was made in 1958. The film today is more amusing (and occasionally tedious) than terrifying, the low budget obvious in the limited glimpses of the monster, brought to earth in a meteorite and discovered by an unfortunate old recluse. McQueen, also named ""Steve"" in the movie, and girlfriend Corsaut discover him with the creature stuck to his hand and take him to the local doctor, with predictably dire results.

The wholly unexpected resonances that ""The Blob"" generates now are twofold and could not have been foreseen when it was made: 1) the climax, where a mob of terrified moviegoers rushes out of the theater that the monster has invaded, has just in the past week gained a sickening parallel in real life; 2) (SPOILER ALERT) the blob is finally dispatched by being frozen with CO2 fire extinguishers and airlifted to the icy wastelands of the Arctic, where it presumably will remain quiescent forever. In light of current concerns about climate change the giant question mark that flashes on the screen at the conclusion, once again, reflects a wholly unintended modern reality.",1343001600,,1590,4.977443609022556
1359849,4,B00004W3HE,"OK, probably one star is for nostalgia, and one for ""local color,"" but as old Sci Fi goes, this is a goodie. And it's relevant, too. In the last line, as Steve McQueen and the police chief are discussing the fact that the Air Force is sending a transport to carry the frozen blob to the arctic where ""it will never thaw out,"" McQueen remarks, ""Yeah, as long as the arctic stays cold."" Hmmmm . . . did they anticipate global warming?

This movie was made in Phoenxiville, PA, near where I grew up. We used to go to the Phoenix theater, one of the places where the Blob goes, and Jerry's Market. The phony part is that, inexplicably, they used the Downingtown Diner for the finale instead any of the Phoenixville diners. Anyway, the Downingtown Diner now has ""home of the Blob"" souvenirs for sale. I think I'll put that picture up if I can figure out how.

Two teenagers are out parking in Steve McQueen's car, Steve and his girlfriend. They see a meteor land somewhere nearby, and go to investigate. Meanwhile, an old man who lives near where the meteor landed goes to investigate, and finds a round rock, pitted much like the moon, steaming in the bottom of a crater about the size of a small swimming pool. He pokes it with a stick, and it cracks open. Inside is a gelatinous substance, clear white, and he pokes that, too. It clings to the stick, crawls up the stick and clings to his hand, and next thing you know, it's turning red. Steve and his girl find the old man screaming in pain and rush him to a doctor, where the blob has grown, and is now bright red. Isn't long before it's absorbed the old man entirely, then the nurse and the doctor.

Most of the rest of the film is the tension between the police and the kids' parents who do not believe them about the blob, and the kids who are trying to save Phoenixville -- dubious motives at best, knowing Phoenixville as I do. There's a good cop/bad cop dichotomy over the sour war veteran who assumes the kids are playing some kind of prank and the police chief who believes they are sincere. Finally, the discovery that the blob can't handle cold comes when a CO2 fire extinguisher forces it to retreat.

It's fun mostly because it's so old, so obviously low budget, and yet very entertaining.",1336867200,7,2251,4.403846153846154
1359850,5,B00004W3HE,"THE BLOB is a great horror movie, not merely because of the vividly horrific images of its nearly unstoppable, flesh-dissolving title character, but because it features a real societal message. It is, in many ways, a ""feel-good horror film."" The clever storyline is helped immeasurably by solid performances from the entire cast. The two romantic leads, Steve McQueen and Aneta Corsaut, bring surprising depth and sentimentality to the proceedings. They are misunderstood but very well-meaning young people, and it's very easy to root for them.

This is a pro-society movie, and its juvenile delinquent characters cause trouble mainly out of boredom, not out of some malevolent character flaw. Steve McQueen's drag-racing rival almost appears to be an enemy early on in the proceedings, but quickly joins in McQueen's campaign to save the town from the oozing invader once he sees McQueen's seriousness. A character situation that at first appears to be cartoonish suddenly develops depth and human realism.

The authorities' initial skepticism of the kids' wild claims is proved wrong--and once the threat is acknowledged by all, all conflict within the society disappears. This unification of purpose, and the validation of the ""troublemaking"" teens, becomes official when Aneta Corsaut's father breaks into the school to obtain the fire extinguishers needed to freeze the Blob. On any other day, breaking into the school would be considered an act of vandalism typical of a juvenile delinquent--on this particular day, it is a necessary action performed by an adult authority figure. At this turning point, it is clear that there are no lines of division between the young and the old.

This is an unusual film in that it acknowledges the perception of a ""generation gap"" but suggests that it is more imaginary than real, and that given a real crisis, people will naturally band together to restore order. ""The Blob"" is a perfect tonic for the kind of depression that generally comes with a viewing of ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1968).

Much has been made of the film's cheap but innovative visual effects. They are undeniably clever. A lot of the gravity-defying tricks we see the Blob perform were achieved with miniature sets designed to be rotated. The camera was typically attached to the sets in a very firmly ""locked down"" position (the lights had to be similarly attached so that the lighting remained steady as the room was turned this way and that). These scenes were often photographed one frame at a time as the room was slowly turned--the silicone blob oozed very slowly and its action needed to be sped up. In a way, this was similar to stop motion photography, but utilizing a blob of silicone rather than an articulated puppet. Even today, the effects are startling and bizarre.

A very good film with an exploitative-sounding title, THE BLOB is a must-see.",1335830400,,2877,5.061181434599156

I was one of those people who got badly burned with the Beta Format and the 8 track tapes so I am holding off on purchasing a DVD player and DVDs until I am sure they will catch on with the public...same is true with the Blue-Ray thingy...what ever that is.  My wife, family, friend's say I am silly for doing this, but hey, better safe than sorry!

But as to this film, `The Blob,"" staring one of my favorite actors Steve McQueen; a film I dig out of my rather large VHS collection and watch late at night with my dogs who are rather nonjudgmental as to my tastes in movies and electronics.  I first saw this thing the year it came out.  I was a rather youngish lad at the time and have to tell you that it scared not only me, but my friends.  I simply enjoyed it!  I still enjoy it, but then I admit to have quite a lot of little boy still in me despite the fact that I am getting quite long in the tooth...my wife continually asks me what I plan to be when I grow up.

The current viewer; the jaded young movie enthusiast of today, will note that the special effects displayed here are a far, far cry from what we have today.  It will also me noted that the dialog is, by today's standards, rather lacking and as a matter of fact, the entire movie can and is often described as rather cheesy and a bit hokey.  Well I don't care!  I still like this thing!

This of course was Steve McQueen's first leading role (You had a 30 something guy playing a teenager) and I have to tell you that when you consider the lines he was given and the material he had to work with, you can see why he eventually became a star...he had it, even then.  McQueen is McQueen...he was what he was.

The story is about a green bit of slim from outer space that is trying to take over just about everything...it is simply a story about a bunch of kids, with the help of some really, really stupid adults, trying to save the world from a hunk of green slime.  The drag racing and teen interaction was quite appealing to we young people at that time and the viewer, especially the younger viewer of today, needs to put this story into the proper context of the time.

This has become a SiFi classic the well represents the SiFi films which emerged during the 1950s.  It was actually one of the better ones to be released during that era and to be quite frank, a lot of the super glitzy and high tech films we are fortunate enough to have today (thanks to technology), can thank this film and other like it for showing the way.

First off, I was surprised at how closely the remake followed the original, but the sensibilities in the the remake seemed much more in tune with the way people might react in that situation. This was made in 1958 and even though we were a different society then, people's behavior and reactions to things still seemed out of tune. One scene, where the blob has trapped our hero and others in a diner, and the attempt to electrocute it has failed and set the diner on fire, has the police and fire chiefs behaving in a manner so calm as to be nearly somnambulistic. There was absolutely no sense of urgency. I was scratching my head over that one.

A meteor falls from the sky and crashes into the woods. A nearby hermit checks it out, pokes it with a stick, gets some major goo on his hand, gets found by a local kid (McQueen) and his girlfriend, gets taken to the doctor where things go way south and the goo goes on a killing spree. As has been done in many movies, something extraordinary has happened but the ""old folk"" don't believe the ""young folk"" who are trying to raise the alarm. And in true fashion the young folk rally and save the day. Thank God for those young folk.

This is an early Steve McQueen role and he hadn't quite found his mark yet, but he stands out here. You also get to see Aneta Corsaut in her pre-Helen Crump days. The rest of the cast is more than lukewarm. The directing is hack level and the budget on the special effects is very low. This was fun to watch but unless you're into historical curiosities, you might want to steer clear.",1282867200,,1833,4.353801169590644
1359900,4,B00004W3HE,"Ah, who can resist rather silly 1950's sci-fi flicks? This one features Steve McQueen as one of the oldest teenagers on record; he was 28 when this was filmed. (He doesn't win the prize, though---upping him is Stockard Channing in ""Grease,"" who was 34 years old but playing 17---seriously!) This is a fun picture, but perhaps a bit on the dull side at times. It quickly becomes apparent just how much more rapidly-paced today's films are, compared to the pictures of fifty years ago. I actually think the movies of today are too frenetic in tone, seemingly designed for people with three-second attention spans. But The Blob goes a bit too far in the opposite direction; for instance, ten minutes into the picture there's an amazingly dull drag race, followed by a scene of Steve talking with his friends, that absolutely stops the film dead in its tracks for five whole minutes.

Things don't really pick up until the final third of the film, where it is kind of fun to see the blob oozing through town as people run blindly about in panic.

This film has become so iconic in American pop culture (spawning a whole sub-genre) that I think every sci-fi film fan should view it at least once, just to see how it all started. But honestly, I remembered this as being a lot more exciting than it was.  While it's an admirable if flawed effort, it's not bad enough to fall into the ""so bad it's good"" category, and so perhaps not quite as fun to watch as films much worse than it is. For me, it served primarily as a slice of nostalgia, and in that capacity I'll recommend it for sci-fi fans.

This was filmed in eastern Pennsylvania, and every year there's a ""Blobfest"" in the town where it was shot. The old Colonial Theatre is still intact (which was featured in the film, in the scenes where the blob ate the projectionist and oozed into the auditorium), and the highlight of the festival is when the film gets to that point, everyone runs screaming out of the cinema, just as they do in the film itself. Sounds like fun!

There's apparently a 86-minute cut of the film out there, but all the prints available on video seem to clock in at 82 minutes. I don't know what all was trimmed, but if it happened to be some drag-racing or dull ""teen"" chat material I would say---why didn't they take out more?",1281052800,,2301,4.4952153110047846

1359904,4,B00004W3HE,"The Blob (Irvin S. Yeaworth Jr., 1958)

Of all the fifties creature features, the softest spot in my heart has always been for The Blob, Irvin Yeaworth's silly, cheesy allegory of the Red Menace that was probably as much of a response to High Noon as Howard Hawks' Rio Bravo a year later. I mean, think about it--here's a red creature (as Robert Osborne tells us, it was clear, but became red after it started ingesting blood--I had to interject ""American blood!"") that can get in through the smallest of cracks, is unkillable, and assimilates anything it touches. I mean, come, on, that's McCarthy-era thinking about Communism in a nutshell. Taking this approach (which I did for the first time upon this last rewatch, though I've seen the movie at least a dozen times since I was eight) makes it even cheesier and sillier, but it is a refreshing change from the OMGBOMB!!!!one! movies that make up the bulk of the fifties creature features.

In case you have somehow missed this movie in the half-century since its release, let me sum it up for you: a meteorite falls out of the sky, witnessed by a number of folks in beautiful downtown Phoenixville, PA, and its outskirts. (Phoenixville really is beautiful, but like all American cities, has changed radically since the fifties. More's the pity.) Among them are Steve Andrews (Steve McQueen in one of his first credited big-screen roles) and his lady love Jane Martin (Aneta Corsaut, best known for The Andy Griffith Show). They're headed out to take a look when they come upon an old man writhing in the road with what looks like a large blister on his hand. They bundle him up and take him to the local doctor (veteran western actor Alden Chase). When they get there, the thing's gotten bigger and turned a nasty red color. The doc sends the young couple back up to the area to see if they can find anyone who saw anything. Along the way, they enlist a few pals, but they turn up nothing save a dog. When they get back, Andrews sees the thing, which has now become The Blob, snacking on the doc before heading out to terrorize the town. Needless to say, the local constabulary, headed up by Steve's old friend Dave (TV actor Earl Rowe in his only big-screen appearance), don't believe Steve and Jane until it's far, far too late...

Yes, it's dumb. Most creature features are; I shouldn't have to tell you that. If you hadn't figured out you weren't going to be scared by this when you bought your ticket (or DVRed it), the Four Lads-style white-boy-bop theme song, more appropriate to a beach comedy, will tip you off. But for cheese, it's not a bad little movie at all (okay, except for some of the special effects in the climax, which look like bad sci-fi dime novel covers). The acting is sterling by almost everyone, the script actually manages moments of subtlety and a good amount of wit, and the whole ""Red Menace"" thing puts at least one great scene into a perspective I'd never thought of before (when Jane's dad, the school principal, has to get into the school by tossing a rock through the window because he left his keys at home. Genius!).

I may well be unique in that I not only enjoy the 1988 remake of this flick, but I am also deeply devoted--more so than I am to this--the horrid 1972 sequel directed by Larry Hagman. So take just about anything I say about The Blob with as many salt licks as necessary, but if you don't have an absolute ball watching this movie, I'll gladly refund the money you paid for this review.

If Lovecraft had written this movie, the earth would have been slurped up. Lovecraft also wasn't counting on Steve McQueen. Cosmic horror versus pure cool, Fonzie versus the Flying Saucers. If you haven't seen it, you've gotta. I give the movie five stars.
  While I am dead certain that I am not the first one to express this misgiving here, I will say that Criterion has deprived itself of the fifth star.

Steve (Steve McQueen) and his girlfriend tell the doc that they'll find out about the whereabouts of the old man's place or if they know anyone who knows him.  However, they get distracted by being challenged to a backwards drag race!

1359949,5,B00004W3HE,"The Blob is an independently made American horror/science-fiction film from 1958 depicting a giant amoeba-like alien that terrorizes the small community of Downingtown, Pennsylvania. It was not until star Steve McQueen became famous with the TV series Wanted: Dead or Alive that the film became a hit at the drive-in theatres. Today, the film is recognized as one of the quintessential 1950s American sci-fi/horror films.

The film was Steve McQueen's debut performance, and also starred Aneta Corsaut. The film's tongue-in-cheek theme song, ""Beware of the Blob"" (recorded by studio group The Five Blobs), was written by a pre-stardom Burt Bacharach and Hal David and was a nationwide hit in the U.S.

The Blob is an amorphous creature from outer space which lands on Earth encased in a meteor. Two teenagers, Steve Andrews (McQueen) and Jane Martin (Corsaut) take a car to try to find where the meteor has landed. Meanwhile, an elderly man (Olin Howland) has heard the meteor crash near his house. He goes outside and upon finding it pokes it with a stick. The rock breaks open, and he finds a small mass of jelly-like substance inside. This ""blob"", which is actually a living creature, crawls up the stick and attaches itself to his hand. The man runs hysterically onto the road, where he is almost hit by Steve's car. Steve attempts to help the man, but he begs to be taken to the doctor. They arrive just as Doctor Hallen is about to leave the office. He takes the old man in and anesthetizes him, but finds that the mass has grown larger. Finally, it dissolves the old man completely and rolls to the floor, where it also engulfs and eats the nurse and later, the doctor himself.

Steve and Jane return to the office, now apparently empty, but in time for Steve to see the Blob consuming the doctor. He and Jane go to the local police, kindly Lt. Dave and cynical Sgt. Burt, and they go to the office where they find no sign of the creature or the doctor. Dismissing Steve's story, the police return Steve and Jane to their homes and parents. Later, they sneak out and get Steve's friends out of the late-night ""Spook Show"" (Daughter of Horror) and try to convince them that the Blob is threatening the town. The Blob, in the meantime, has consumed a mechanic and later (off camera), the janitor in Mr. Andrew's grocery store. Steve and Jane find it here, and it chases them into the walk-in refrigerator, but for some reason it does not follow them in after starting to squeeze under the door. They then escape and set off the town's fire and air-raid alarms. The whole town gathers and demands to know what is going on. As the townspeople and police angrily confront Steve, the Blob enters the Colonial Theater, engulfs and eats the man in the projection room, and then attacks the audience. As the patrons run screaming out of the theater, the truth of Steve's story is finally confirmed to everyone.

The Blob then follows Steve, Jane, and her little brother into the local diner, which it engulfs. The kids, along with the owner and his wife, run into the cellar. The police try to kill the Blob by dropping a power line onto it. This fails, but sets the diner on fire instead. The people are trapped inside with no hope of escape, until Steve starts to quench the fire with a fire extinguisher. The Blob, which is trying to reach them in the cellar, recoils. Steve tells Lt. Dave that the Blob cannot stand cold (explaining why it did not consume them in the refrigerator), and so, taking the fire extinguishers from the local high school, they attack the monster with carbon dioxide. Soon, the Blob is frozen solid, unable to move or engulf anyone. The film closes with a scene of a military plane dropping the Blob into an Arctic landscape.

The film ends with the words ""The End"", which then morph into a question mark, suggesting that the Blob may return (which it does fourteen years later - this time, to a Los Angeles suburb - in the sequel, Beware! The BlobThe film was originally titled ""The Molten Meteor"" until producers overheard screenwriter Kay Linaker refer to the movie's monster as ""the blob.""[1] Other sources disagree, saying that the film went through a number of title changes before the makers settled on The Glob. Then, hearing that someone else had already used The Glob as a title and believing that they could no longer use it (though in actuality they could have) they changed it to The Blob. [2]

The Blob was directed by Irvin Yeaworth, who had directed more than 400 films for motivational, educational, and religious purposes.

The Blob was filmed in and around Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. The primary shooting took place at Valley Forge Studios, and several scenes were filmed in the towns of Chester Springs, Downingtown, Phoenixville and Royersford. Including the basement of a local restaurant named Chef's. (The setting is apparently Downingtown, Pennsylvania itself as the one policeman identifies his department's office as ""Downingtown HQ"" to ""East Cornwall HQ"" over the two-way radio during his chess game.) It was filmed in color and widescreen.

McQueen received only $3,000 for this film; he had turned down an offer for a smaller up-front sum with 10 percent of the profits because he did not think the movie would make any money and he needed the money immediately to pay for food and rent; it ended up grossing $4 million.

Though legend has it that the opening novelty song was composed by a young and unknown Burt Bacharach (along with Hal David, Burt's famous songwriting partner), Bacharach had already achieved some measure of success by the time the film was released, and the lyrics to the song were composed by David's brother Mack. The background score for The Blob was composed by Ralph Carmichael. Known as ""The Dean of Contemporary Christian Music,"" it was one of just a few film scores that Carmichael wrote. Carmichael is best known for his musical associations with Billy Graham and for arranging the popular Christmas album by Nat King Cole. Carmichael also composed the original theme for the film, entitled ""Violence"" on the soundtrack album, which started the film on a serious and frightening note. It was against the director's wishes that Bacharach's song replaced the original theme. However, because Bacharach's theme encourages audiences to view The Blob as campy fun, it has contributed to the film's enduring popularity. Both Carmichael's score and Bacharach/David's song were released in 2008 by the Monstrous Movie Music soundtrack label.

A comedy sequel was made in 1972, entitled Beware! The Blob, directed by Larry Hagman. In 1988, a remake was made, in which the Blob is rewritten as a secret government project gone wrong. In 2006, Paramount Pictures announced a second remake will be produced by Scott Rudin; Carey Hayes and Chad Hayes, who penned the remake of House of Wax, have been hired to write the screenplay.

Since 2000, the town of Phoenixville, Pennsylvania -- one of the filming locations -- has held an annual ""Blobfest"". Activities include a re-enactment of the scene in which moviegoers run screaming from the town's Colonial Theatre, which has recently been restored. Chef's Diner in Downingtown is also restored, and is open for business or photographs of the basement on weekday mornings only.

Some books and television series have made passing homage to the film, including R. L. Stine's The Blob That Ate Everyone, and ""Treehouse of Horror XVII"", an episode of The Simpsons in which Homer Simpson becomes a large mass that consumes everything.

Scenes from The Blob appear in the 1978 musical Grease (also a Paramount feature).

A blob named H. G. Blob (for Horrible Gelatinous Blob) is a recurrent character of the cartoon Futurama. A blob also appears in the episode ""Mon ami le blob"" (My friend the Blob) of the French cartoon ""Oggy et les cafards"" (Oggy and the roaches).

In the movie, Monsters vs. Aliens will feature the Indestructible Gelatinous Mass named ""B.O.B."" In this case, this creature is depicted as a protagonist fighting invading aliens.

""The Blob"" is an excellent sci-fi horror movie.  Admittedly, its special effects aren't in the league of today's horror movies.  But it doesn't matter.  This movie has a great story.  It's not so much about the monster as it is about a group of teenagers, led by Steve McQueen, trying to convince their hometown that a monster has invaded it.  Its deliberate pacing, by today's standards, nevertheless builds to nerve-tingling suspense.  Steve McQueen turns in an outstanding performance in his first starring role in a movie.  I saw ""The Blob"" as a kid but I didn't realize how good it is until I watched it the other day.

I love when the everyone is at the late night horror flick at the theater and the blob comes in and crashes the party. Another thing I love about it is that it takes place all in one night, just like Halloween II.

When Steve and Jane are making out, they see a meteor fall from space. Inside the meteor is the blob. Whenever the blob consumes a person, it grows bigger and bigger. They try to convince the people of the town about the blobby monster, but no one believes them until later. Can anything stop this blobby creature?

Billed as Steven McQueen, it would be the launching point for his career -- into WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE, then THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN and the real star maker, THE GREAT ESCAPE.  The girlfriend of his character ""Steve"" (that must have been difficult for McQueen to remember) was Aneta Corsaut, best remembered as Andy Taylor's love interest on THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW.

George A. Romero uses social commentary in his Dawn of the Dead as zombies are used as metaphors for American consumerism.  The Blob is used more literally.  Instead of zombies attacking, a ball of space goop falls from the sky and begins to devour people, getting bigger and redder with their blood as it does.  You can't kill it only freeze it.

The Blob's consuming could destroy the whole planet and the people in it and our consuming as we deplete our resources and battle our own blobs (obesity epidemic) could destroy it as well.  I found it even more ironic at the ending when they mention were safe as long as the arctic stays cold, guess were not safe.  No need to remake this one again for our generation (88 Blob remake is also highly recommended) like The Body Snatcher movies, just pop in this 1958 version the message is scarier now then 1958.  Oh No!  BEWARE!  THE BLOB COULD BE UNLEASHED 2008!!! DUH DUH DUH.

This classic movie would look incredible in HD! The film itself is one of the best 50's Sci-Fi features of all time. From the opening title song which makes you tap your toes and wanna take bosa nova lessons to the ""teenagers"" who are clearly in the late 20's! You think your in for a typical teen movie, but...It doesn't matter......because the movie just works! Even the obvious miniatures don't take away from this classic 50's gem. Olin Howlin a great character actor has the honor of being in two on the best 50's Sci-Fi movie ever made....'The Blob' and 'Them' you remember him  in 'Them' don't you??

I hadn't really planned to  watch more than than the first few minutes of this people devouring goo story but was somehow soon drawn in by the characters and plot.

I think the film is so ""absorbing"" (pardon the pun) because the filmmakers do such a great job of capturing 1950's small town life.  We quickly come to care about Steve, his girlfriend (played by the same actress who would later play Helen Crump on the Andy Griffith show) and all the other threatened folks. Steve McQueen may look more than a bit long in the tooth to be playing a teenager but you soon forget that as you root for him and his friends to defeat this ever growing mass of jelly.  And besides who could resist that catchy theme song?  I won't give the ending away to those who don't know what happens but I will say it is one more reason to worry about global warming.",1194566400,2,1022,4.347368421052631
1359973,4,B00004W3HE,"Isn't this just the best concept for a movie ever?  A shapeless hunk of brownish muck from outer space that eats everybody that gets in it's way and grows with each victim!  Of course it's the local teens who see this thing and have to convince the unbelieving adults that it exists and is a threat to the town.  Most folks kinda know the deal with this film whether they've seen it or not.  I've seen it many times since I was a kid and it still stands as one of the better invasion movies of the 50s.  Along with the giant ant flick, Them, it's one of the few B sci-fi/horror films of the time period that's actually considered a legitimately good film.  The Blob effects aren't all that bad considering the budget and time period.  Nifty theme song too!  This is one of the more odd choices for Criterion coz they usually don't tend to tackle this kind of movie.  As usual, they do a great job with the picture and sound of the film, but you kinda get the green weenie when it comes to the extras.  Considering you almost have to take out a loan to cover the price of this dvd, you'd think you'd get more than two commentaries and some production stills.  Unless you're a totally hardcore film collector or a flat out Blob fanatic, you'd be better off with the cheaper disc that came out a few years ago.

1359974,5,B00004W3HE,"Well, oozing out of my boyhood memory comes the rememberance of this old film.  Boy how it use to give me nightmares back in the early 1960's whenever I saw it. Compared to the 1988 remake, this is very toned down in terms of the horror element.  Suspense wise, this film carries well, if you've never seen it. Careful though, kids 8 or under might get the same nightmares I got as a boy having not forgotten my own childhood.

The film was made by a group of people who never made a motion picture film before and they did a pretty good job with the whole thing.  This was the first film to launch Steve McQueen's career as an actor and the opening song was the first commercial song written by the famed Burt Bacharach, whose career greatly took off after writing the opening theme song. The actors were hardly paid anything for this work. Word of mouth however and the opening theme song helped sell this picture at the box office into the horror classic it became.

Most camera shots were one time takes for the most part and yet the whole thing comes together quite well in the editing room.  The lighting, location and set work is very well done. The blob, being nothing more than colored red silicon, made in a bucket, that pulsates on a rubber balloon, is a very convincing performer as the star of the film. The color quality of this Criterion Collection is just crisp as all can be.  The whole thing looks like the day it was first released: Astounding quality.

Obviously, you can't take this premise of the Blob seriously. Jack Harris, in his audio commentary, looks back laughing; saying he can't believe they made this film.  However, the scene pacing has a unique ambiance of ""creepiness"" to it.  You just never know when the blob will appear and have a human being as a meal, if you've never seen the movie before. There is no real gore element in this film like there was in the 1988 remake.  Its the pacing of the film and suspense formula that makes it ""fun"" to watch, if you can call having a feeling of total sick uneasiness, as you watch this film ""fun""? I suppose you'd get the same feeling having a good round with the 72 hour flu bug in your life, but it all works.  It worked even more when I was a boy seeing it for the first time.

The idea that something, which can consume organic flesh; can't be burned up, is a bit contrived however. Flesh has the chemical structure of CHNO, the same structure as plastic.  Man learned to make plastic back in the 1940's by studying the chemical structure of organic flesh. Both burn when exposed to high fire or heat; regardless. So why the blob responds to cold, but not fire or electricity, which destroys flesh, makes no scientific sense in terms of God's Universe and its laws as we know it.  However this thing comes from outer space and anything is possible if it comes from outer space, right? How the blob converts organic flesh into a meaty, gooey, crawling intelligence is something I think only the film makers can explain, not a scientist. (chuckling)  In short, in terms of scientific law with what is known about life on this planet; you can't freeze something without also being able to burn it, but you learn they can't burn or electricute this thing, only adding to the suspense value toward the end, begging the questions; ""How will they destroy it?"". But that is what makes the thing so campy.

Also, how the blob can dissolve flesh, but has a heck of a time getting through a door or thin glass pane window is beyond me. It can go under a door however.  You'd think all that massive weight, made out of dissolved human bodies, would have no trouble getting through anything. What a line backer this thing would make on a football field! No one would mess with it! (lol) Can't imagine what it would look like in a football uniform, unless it was consumming opposing team members while wearing their uniforms along the way, but maybe that will be in the next remake, since its been 20 years since the 1988 remake was done.

Just think what can be done with computer graphics these days, if this premise was approached again?  Could be an even worse gross out than the 1988 remake. They no doubt could show us a whole young man dissolve on screen while watching the blob ooze through every orifice of the young man's body as it strips the body down like an onion one layer at a time right before our eyes!  We no doubt could even watch it moving through the man's GItract as the flesh is stripped away on screen. Ich! I think that is what many were hoping more for with the 1988 remake.

You can certainly see this potential with computer generated graphics viewing the movie ""Hollow Man"" starring Kevin Bacon; where the gorilla that appears and disappears off the operating table, as the ""invisibility serum"" takes hold, disappears one layered system at a time with its body.  Just add on the blob to that special effect and you've got the effect, while making the whole thing look way too real.

Also, since the blob can dissolve flesh, which has the chemical structure of CHNO, why can't it dissolve wood, which has a similar CHNO formulation at the molecular level, especially when it comes in contact with the old diner's structure at the end of the movie? This at least was addressed in the 1988 remake when the first young guy gets it. Oh God, I'm being too sensible aren't I?

Well, the fact is, when you are a little boy, being scared to death by this film, you don't think of such things and there in lies the charm of this old horror classic in my view. I say all of this so you don't take this film too seriously, but simply have fun with its suspense value, which is very well done and for that reason alone deserves 5 stars.

Suspense wise with the story, you also can't help but feel the helplessness of the young teenage kids trying to warn the town, while no one listens; as more and more people become blob fodder, not to mention the feeling of helplessness the authorities have toward the end, when the blob traps the stars in a small diner, ready to disolve them for dinner, with no one knowing how to stop it. Makes you wonder whose the dinner and whose the diner in the end? (lol)  It also makes you wonder if they had that gag in mind with the final sequence of the movie, which wasn't mentioned in the commentaries. Oh well.

Anyway, the two commentaries are only all too excellent that come with this collection.  One audio has Jack Harris & Bruce Eder on it. Both men are extremely articulate in their command of the English language and reveal much about the movie, as well as horror film genre in general back when the movie was made. Both have magnificent voices as you listen to them talk about all of this. The way they present their knowledge should be a standard used by everyone who does a DVD commentary in my opinion: Very informative and very enjoyable.  The second audio commentary done by Director Irvin S. Yeoworth Jr. and actor Robert Fields is equally well done and worth listening to, as you watch this old horror film from the 50's.

1360018,4,B00004W3HE,"In 1958, Paramount Pictures released THE BLOB, a modest sci-fi cinematic effort showcasing a struggling, up-and-coming actor named Steve McQueen in his first feature film starring role. THE BLOB - about a primal life form from outer space which comes to earth and begins to indiscriminately devour human flesh -  made a killing at the box office and generated a 1972 sequel and a 1988 remake, as well as a Halloween parody by THE SIMPSONS. This movie is also known for its tongue-in-cheek theme song (""Beware of the Blob""), co-written by a pre-famous Burt Bacharach, which went on to become a top 40 hit.

The plot: Teenagers Steve Andrews (McQueen) and Jane Martin (Aneta Corsaut) are out on a date when they glimpse a falling star and attempt to pinpoint its location. Meanwhile, an elderly man comes upon the fallen meteor and pokes at it with a stick (never a sound move in first alien contacting), only to have the meteor break open and the semi-sentient, jelly-like substance within climb up and cling to his hand. The frantic numbnut runs around and is almost struck by Steve's car. Steve and Jane take the man to the hospital, where the jelly blob on the infected victim begins to grow further, eventually consuming its host. It then begins to treat the medical staff like a buffet; the blob inevitably gets out and begins snacking on every human in its path, ever growing larger and larger.

The townspeople are blissfully unaware of the goings-on, despite Steve's desperate attempts to warn them, until a blob assault in a movie theater finally clues in everyone. The town, naturally, falls into a panicked state as the frenzied citizenry mill around and the police strive to ineffectively battle the monstrosity. Finally, it's up to Steve to figure out how to vanquish the blob monster. Unfortunately, he figures it out before the annoying kid actor is eaten.

Absolutely, THE BLOB had its own share of shlock, but, within the confines of its B movie status and irregardless of the cheeky theme song, the cast and crew strived to tell a gripping sci-fi/horror story. The cheesy special effects don't hold up at all to modern day standards (the blob was created initially using a weather balloon and later with tinted silicone gel), and the blob, in today's age, certainly isn't about to realistically intimidate anyone, but there's still an element of nostalgic fun in watching the blob go oozing about its business and scaring the bejesus out of the film characters. The actors made the tale as credible as possible by playing it straight and serious. Kudos go to 27 year old Steve McQueen for convincingly playing a 19 year old. Apparently, McQueen wasn't well liked on the set (he was a prima donna and was in constant argument with the director), but he ended up turning in a charismatic leading man performance. He, evidently, was good enough here that it got him the lead in the television series WANTED: DEAD OR ALIVE.

THE BLOB, with its display of 1950s sensibilities so different from today's mores and values, is a time capsule film in which the audience could hearken back to a more innocent time. Back then, as predominantly portrayed in cinematic films, even the delinquents end up being kinda square and wholesome. Put side by side with today's standards, it looks pretty unrealistic today. Anyway, THE BLOB is worth investing about 80 minutes of your time. It tells a decent monster attack story, the special effects are so hokey they're fun, the song is bubbly, and McQueen is very good. But that kid is still annoying.",1167609600,2,3547,4.827302631578948
1360019,5,B00004W3HE,"First of all, I want to say that 1958's The Blob is a landmark picture and a fantastically fun sci-fi/horror film. Steve McQueen is perfect in it, and it's quite possibly the best sci-fi cheese to come out of the 50s.

HOWEVER, I'm fed up with the Criterion Collection. What this company seems to intend to do is snatch up the rights to many, many great movies, ""class"" them up with minimal special features, and sell them at obscene prices. This edition of The Blob has ONE DISC, and the only special features are two commentaries. And we have to cough up $40 to have it.

There are no other options; If you want to own this masterpiece, you have to be able to fork up forty dollars to do so.

I have watch the film both with and without the commentaries.  The commentaries add quite a bit of behind the scenes information and allowed me to enjoy the film on a different level.

If you are a fan of Steve McQueen or of 1950's SF movies, then this is an essential movie.  It is one of McQueen's breakthrough roles and one of the better ""invasion"" SF movies.

1360022,1,B00004W3HE,"""The Blob"" was my first experience with a Criterion edition disc.
The transfer to disc and color restoration are excellent.

I have been a fan of this movie for many years, and have it on (non-Criterion) VHS. I was very disappointed to discover the CRITERION edition has been EDITED..!

On the (non-Criterion) VHS version, In the ""racing in reverse"" scene just outside of Doc Hallen's office, Steve says to the others, that the (traffic) light will change by the time they get there.
This segment has been DELETED from the CRITERION edition.

Granted, some viewers may have no opposition to this deletion, however, I am a nostalgist and a vintage movie collector. I personally find the deletion appauling. I played this section of the disc repeatedly thinking I may have just overlooked it. I hadn't.

For a company who is promoted as seeking and transferring to disc the ""best quality print"" of a movie, only to DELETE a segment of that movie, especially a cult classic.. I am disappointed to say the least. And thus, unfortunatly, I must give THIS EDITION a poor rating. However, I will say this; if it were not for the deleted segment, I would have given it a 5+",1139097600,35,1165,4.696078431372549
1360023,5,B00004W3HE,"The plot is as follows. A meteorite falls from space and lands near a remote town in Pennsylvania. The Blob hatches from the meteorite,and attaches itself to the arm of an old man. The old man is rescued and brought into town by Steve McQueen, and left at a doctor's office. From there, the Blob eats the doctor, eats a garage mechanic, roams around a grocery, and attacks a crowd in the theater. Finally . . . (you'll have to see the ending yourself).

The acting is convincing and professional. The word, ""camp"" cannot be used to describe the acting.  The name Steve McQueen speaks for itself. The other teenagers, actually adults in their late twenties, as well as the medical doctor, an elderly housekeeper, and an old man who lives in a forest, all do a convincing job at acting.  There is nothing second-rate about the acting.

The policemen are excellent. In particular, the skeptic policeman does an excellent job at being paranoid. If Steve McQueen is the protagonist, then the skeptic policeman (not the Blob) is the antagonist.

There are little touches of humor. For example, one of the policemen is shown speaking some sort of code into a microphone, where he is speaking to another policeman at a remote location. But then, the camera pans back, and discloses that he is actually playing a game of chess with the other policeman, and is identifying positions of the chess pieces. Another clever touch of humor comes near the end, where the principal of the high school actually smashes through the window of his own high school in order to obtain fire extinguishers.

DRAMATIC THEMES. The picture succeeds on several levels, for example, as possible commentary on the Red Menace during the cold war period, as a psychological thriller (Steve McQueen's mission versus the skeptical policeman's mission, and the old landlady's inadvertant mission, of derailing Steve McQueen's plan), and as a plain old suspenseful horror story. The movie is also about ""teenaged rebellion."" But here, the movie is actually about teenagers being mistaken for being rebellious, when they are actually inocuous. All of these themes dovetail nicely. What is the movie about? What the movie is all about is Steve McQueen's attempts to make the townspeople realize that they are in danger. The movie remains faithful to this theme throughout the story, using various clever and suspenseful techniques. The movie can be watched over and over.

CINEMATOGRAPHY, COLORS, & IMAGE QUALITY.  The cinematography is unique. The colors are bright and happy. For example, one notes the actress' brightly colored, fluffy dresses. One also recalls the colorful hot rods driven by the teenagers (actually actors in their late twenties). Of course, the Blob is also brightly colored. The entire movie takes place after dark, either outside or in buildings such as a police station, doctor's office, grocery store, or movie theater. The sequence of episodes, as they occur in the plot, is totally appropriate and well paced. None of the episodes is out of place. Touches of cleverness are abound. For example, in the theater episode, where frightened movie goers race out of the theater, we see some of the patrons falling down on the sidewalk, as the mad crowd dashes out. The quality of the picture image is superb. It picture image is crystal clear. The special effects are more than acceptable. For example, one particular special effect shows the Blob passing through an air vent. What is interesting is that the Blob allows itself to be sliced into a dozen sheets by the ridges in the air vent, as it passes through.

CRITIQUE.  If any criticism can be leveled against these characters is that they are non-threatening and lack menacing qualities. They have nice haircuts. They wear tidy clothes. The theme song, which initiates the film, is a happy, bouncy, innocuous tune, having no relevance to the horror to come, e.g., the horror in the meat freezer, the panic in the theater, or the cliff hanger in basement of the flaming restaurant. Another reviewer observed that the theme song is inappropriate. I agree. But perhaps, the happy, stupid theme song was meant to represent ""square one,"" that is, square one in a journey down the pathway leading to accumulating suspense and danger.

I don't see why people sometimes call this movie a ""cult film."" It is an excellent drama, accessable to everyone. FIVE STARS.

If you like THE BLOB, you will love another movie, ALIEN TRESPASS.  ALIEN TRESPASS, which is another ensemble piece, takes place in a little town in a desert in California.  A flying saucer lands, and a group of teenagers spend the first 30 minutes of the film trying to convince authorities that a flying saucer has landed, and that it brought aliens, called, ""ghotas.""  ALIEN TRESPASS provides humor in the form of backwater hicks.  Much of ALIEN TRESPASS concerns an astromer (who lives in the town), who's body was taken over by an intergalactic agent who was piloting the flying saucer, and who tries to warn the town about the Ghotas.  ALIEN TRESPASS also plays homage to THE BLOB, by reproducing the theater episode, where the Ghotas attack moviegoers in the theater, while the moviegoers are watching the movie, THE BLOB.",1136764800,,5225,4.939566704675029
1360024,5,B00004W3HE,"If you've never seen THE BLOB in a theatre, you're missing something ... the color and crisp photography were a great counterpoint to Steve McQueen's dedicated, earnest performance in a thankless role,... and remarkable effects.

For years, and I mean YEARS, no one knew how the effects were done. It added to the charm of the film ... the gelatinous mass creeps, rolls, wavers, and oozes its way through the effects scenes. Well, numerous production photos included in this Criterion Collection release finally explain the technical innovation which brought the Blob to life. The photos alone are worth half the retail price.

Okay, okay, enough technical geek celebration. The story unfolds pretty swiftly, from the landing of the meteorite, the hapless old guy who pokes a stick where it doesn't belong, to the doctor's office,.... Despite the campy subject, there are some very serious scares in this film, and the suspense and hysteria grow to a thrilling climax. Pop the popcorn, dim the lights, and get ready for the opening featuring a hilarious theme song, an early work of Burt Bacharach. What is THE BLOB from outer space? Who knows ... but b-l-o-b spells FUN. Enjoy.",1135987200,5,1178,5.005102040816326

1360026,4,B00004W3HE,"This is one picture I recall with great fondness because to me it was a film that didn't technically have alot going for it but it had a heck of ALOT of heart. And I'm glad to say on seeing the film again for the first time in many a year that my first impression is STILL right.

This film was indeed shot on a small budget using young,almost unknown actors and the use of special effects while limited were used brilliantly and to their best advantage whenever possible.

The plot simply involves a meteorite that lands near a farmers' house. The farmer investigates and finds himself up close and personal with its' contents. Some local kids coming to see the meteorite discover the farmer and take him to the local doc. The Blob in short order devours the farmer then proceeds on its',relatively at first,quiet and deadly rampage. The kids try unsuccessfully through a good portion of the flick to convince the local authorities of its' reality. By the time they start believing the Blob has become tremendous in size and threatens the whole town. In the end the threat is ""contained"" and the world is saved from this deadly denizen from outer space.

While the plot is simple and sometimes see through the well used special effects but especially the actors themselves really hold this picture together from beginning to end making it seem believable.

This Criterion disc is not loaded with alot of extras but enough to satisfy ones basic needs. To compensate however they have included a repro poster of the Blob! A VERY nice and classy touch by the Criterion folks.

And techncially speaking this is my favourite part of this film.

This is an A#1,top of the line remastered print. This thing is so clear and crisp you'd almost swear it was shot yesterday not some 50 years ago. It is gorgeous and quickly dispelled my trepidation of spending the money I did on getting this disc. The colour is steady and clean and it is presented in its' widescreen theatrical ratio. Nothing more a collector could ask for. Nothing.

This kind of wonderful work that the folks at Criterion do is obviously keeping some highly skilled and smart folks working for them. But it goes back to a theme that I often touch on in my reviews:Why aren't the domestic big guys(Paramount,Columbia,MGM,et al)releasing all their properties as does Criterion and some other independants do? With the incredible amount of money and technical facilities available to these companies why are they not doing it themsleves?Why aren't they taking(to me) the common sense approach and treating every release as it deserves to be treated:finished in the BEST possible format/condition it can be?? To me it's not only common sense but it's having dignity and PRIDE in ones' products.

Obviously in this case Paramount had no intentions of releasing this movie any time soon in any kind of condition so Criterion does what it does best and took the bull by the horns and did it for them and for that you have this movie collectors' greatest admiration.

Another must own movie,especially to those partial to the 1950s Sci-Fi/Horror genre. You will NOT be disappointed.",1127260800,5,3135,4.801484230055658

1360048,5,B00004W3HE,"THE BLOB is a 1958 low-budget Friday night drive-in classic starring Steven (yep!) McQueen in his first major role as the clean-cut leader of a sweet shop full of happy Eisenhower babies who discover the existence of the world-threatening Blob, a creature apparently just arrived from the home planet of homicidal gelatin desserts.

The Blob is a fun monster to watch as it rolls through a small Pennsylvania town absorbing everything it touches, like your sofa, your neighbor's sofa, your neighbor who was sitting on his sofa, your cousin's cat and Beaky's souped-up '57 Chevy Bel Air.

Realizing that their town is in terrible danger from the Blob, Steve and his prom queen girlfriend go to the police who accuse them of being out, ahem, necking and send them home for violating curfew. Unsatisfied (gosh darn it!), Steve and Janie SNEAK OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT (oh golly!) to hunt the Blob with the aid of the local sideburners.

After the Blob devours approximately 75% of downtown Downingtown (that IS the name of the town and it has an annual Blob Festival now) the Army is called in to handle the menace. Steve (of course) discovers the secret to stopping the Blob, and eventually everyone goes back to bed safe and secure in post-Sputnik America.

Like most of its genre, THE BLOB is made up of equal measures of postwar innocence and Cold War paranoia. THE BLOB has aged well and is still very entertaining and even slightly suspenseful.

It is a great deal of nostalgic fun to watch genteel Fifties virtues played out on film. THE BLOB even evinces a soda-pop disrespect for authority (the self-important, self-proclaimed ""war hero"" local cop is the butt of everybody's jokes, and the sideburners cheer when the Principal breaks a window at the high school to get inside while trying to fight the Blob).

THE BLOB is a fun movie that never goes stale.",1118793600,3,1868,4.767801857585139
1360049,5,B00004W3HE,"Taken as a straight horror film, 1958's THE BLOB would admittedly fail, as it is not creepy or frightening by any conventional cinematic standards.  But this campy classic is not meant to be taken seriously.  From the opening bars of the catchy pop-music theme song to the question mark that follows the words THE END, the film is a blatant send-up of 1950s American culture and its white-bread mores and sensibilities.  The film is replete with palpable caricatures of nearly every cultural icon of 1950s: Squeaky-clean teenagers, rock-n-roll music, hot-rods and drag racing, friendly neighborhood cops, cold-war anxiety...you name it.  Indeed, taken as a whole, the film itself is a spoof of both the invasion-from-space and the giant-monster-on-the-loose sci-fi flicks that were popular earlier in the decade.
THE BLOB was made and released in the wake of teen-angst films like REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE and beatnik publications like Kerouac's ON THE ROAD, and it was also a time when the counterculture icons of the 1960s--rock groups like The Beatles and The Rolling Stones; gurus of alternate lifestyles such as Dr. Timothy Leary and Abbie Hoffman--were formulating their radical ideals and ideologies.  In other words, THE BLOB was the product of a period when American youth were becoming restless and were itching for artistic and intellectual stimulation, and teens and young adults were therefore growing increasingly weary of bland 1950s conservatism.  Campy films like THE BLOB capitalized on that attitude by offering up exaggerated and surrealistic snapshots of the culture's insipid qualities, thereby giving the younger crowd an opportunity to openly laugh at the worldview of their elders.  Alas, the sardonic humor and satirical subtext of THIS classic film seems to be lost on the average contemporary audience.
The special FX in THE BLOB are typical of 1950s cinema, but that only adds to the humor and the fun.  The gelatinous titular character is especially a hoot to watch.  Even though the illusion of its movement is obviously the result of stop-motion animation, it is still quite compelling to see it ooze under doors, through duct vents, and down Main Street, USA.
Film buffs will definitely enjoy seeing the venerable Steve McQueen in one of his earliest film roles--the twinkle in his eye as he delivers his ah-gee-whiz lines should clue you in to the fact that this film is parody--and couch potatoes and fans of classic TV will recognize Aneta Corsaut, the girl playing Jane Martin, from her recurring role as Helen Crump on THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW.
The visual transfer on Criterion Collection's DVD version of THE BLOB is beautiful--probably the best digital version to date--and the disc also offers extras that include two interesting audio commentaries.  The one negative aspect of CC's disc, though, is some very noticeable scratchiness on the soundtrack during a few short portions of the film.  For the price that the CC charges for their discs, consumers are right to expect all noticeable flaws in picture and sound to be cleaned up.
Overall, THE BLOB is a great piece of classic camp, and the five-star rating is based on the film itself and does not, therefore, reflect the aspects of any particular DVD version.",1073952000,6,3251,5.115094339622641
1360050,4,B00004W3HE,"The Blob is a classic B-movie that has all the elements of a 50's horror movie while also being the movie that helped shoot Steve McQueen to stardom.  One night, two teenagers see a meteor crash to Earth.  Before they can find out what it is, an old man unleashes what it contains on himself, a gooey substance that quickly begins to take over his arm.  Soon enough, the gooey mass begins to grow, but nobody believes the two teenagers who saw the blob eat the town doctor.  The small town then must unite to defeat the evil substance that threatens their existence.  This is a very low budget movie, it is easy to see, but that is what makes it so fun to watch.  The Blob looks like strawberry jelly throughout which adds to the cheesiness factor.  Either way, this is a fun movie that is more enjoyable every time I watch it.
 The Blob was Steve McQueen's first starring role as Steve Andrews, a misunderstood teen who with the help of his girlfriend, Jane, tries to get the townspeople to realize what they are going up against.  Somehow, a 28 year old McQueen passes as a teenager while the other teenage characters are actually the age they play.  Anyhow, this may be different from every other movie McQueen ever made, but it is still a good one.  The Criterion Collection DVD is well worth the purchase.  It includes two commentaries, a collectible poster, theatrical trailer, widescreen presentation, and several other features.  The Blob is certainly not the highest quality of movie, but it is still very good and well worth a watch.",1062201600,2,1543,4.587591240875913

I have to compare it to the remake. I thought the remake was going to be something that really eclipsed the original. I have never been more disappointed! It did not come close. I suppose that proves that you just cannot improve on the best!
The extras on this DVD make it worth a mint. I think it is so wornderful to have the movie AND information about the movie. For me it was cool to finally learn about a movie that I grew up watching.

The transfer is really good, and the colors come through brilliantly.  Just seeing the blob oozing around, all bloated on the blood of it's victims is quite creepy.  I do wish I could have seen this at the drive in, as that seems to be it's perfered format of venue, but this is the next best thing.  I loved the part where the old man finds the small meteor and starts poking it with a stick.  You just know something bad is going to happen.  And then when he starts playing around with the blob on that stick, the ooze sliding down, getting closer to his hand....and the theme song...I had almost forgotten about that.  It's so unlike a horror movie theme, but very catchy.  Reminds me of that song 'Purple People Eater'.  Anyway, the movie is a great piece of 50's sci-fi with great effects that's a lot of fun.  Also included with this editon is a poster, and a few extras on the disc, but a lot less than I would have thought.  I was expecting a little more, but what are you going to do?  It seems odd that the Criterion Collection edition of Carnival of Souls should have as many extras it did and there not be more for The Blob.

as for the DVD, great transfer though there are some artifacts present but not distracting. the sound is monaural but basically good. concerning the fact that it's part of the ""criterion collection"" distribution, carries a high price tag.

1360055,4,B00004W3HE,"""The Blob"" on DVD by Criterion is a real treat.  The print is exquisite, much better than the prints I'd seen on the ""4:30 Movie"" in the 1970's.  I always loved the scene in which the Blob creeps up on the mechanic under the car. (""HEY YOU- WATCH OUT!!"")
Metaphorically and culturally, I believe ""The Blob"" is about the overall paranoia in the 1950's; aliens, communists and teenagers had to be stopped, or at least controlled!  ""The Blob"" itself is a mass of goop, indicating the ambiguous nature of our enemies.  By the end of the 1950's, we didn't know who we were afraid of, but we sure were afraid!!!
""The Blob"" can also be appreciated as the carnivorous nature of 1950's consumerism which was hitting its post-war peak in the film.  The DVD liner notes extrapolate on this theme in greater detail.
