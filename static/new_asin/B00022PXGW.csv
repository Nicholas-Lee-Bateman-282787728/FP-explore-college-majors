A lot of random incidents, I suffered through to the end, but ugh!  Glad it wasn't my first SRK experience, probably would never have watched another!",1525219200,,274,4.645833333333333
8020852,3,B00022PXGW,Good Shahrukh Khan movie To add to my collection even though a bit scratched. I need to clean it. Glad I bought it though.,1398902400,,122,4.125
8020853,1,B00022PXGW,"Love Shah Rukh Khan and I have a pretty extensive collection.  I had not heard of this movie and wish I hadn't seen it.  I ordered it; watched it and found it to be a poorly made movie.  Badly written, badly shot, badly directed.  After viewing the movie, I found an article online that the movie was released at a time when fans were buying anything SRK - and I was one of them.  This movie is now a part of my collection and I will never watch it again.",1341964800,,455,4.011111111111111
8020854,2,B00022PXGW,"I am a huge Shah Rukh Khan fan and love just about all his movies, but without a doubt do not like this one! Unfortunately, I bought it because 1)I love SRK, 2)couldn't find this movie to rent, and 3)figured it would be good because most of his are. I totally agree with the other reviewer about this movie--VERY CONFUSING, like she said--disjointed and didn't flow, and Shah Rukh was hardly in it! At the beginning of the movie it starts when the kids are young then tells you it's 10 years later and they're in college...and then jumps from????????? They don't fill in the huge gaps in between and then it just continues on like that. It was very weird. There was no smart dialogue, the acting wasn't that great and not even any catchy or memorable songs! If Shah Rukh had not been in this movie at all, I would've given it no or 1 star, but since he was in it--even barely--I give it 2 stars. If you're an SRK fan, SPARE YOURSELF time and money!",1338508800,,948,4.301675977653631
8020855,2,B00022PXGW,"I purchased this film because I am a Shah Rukh Khan fan. This film was released 10 years after it was made. I don't know, but I am guessing that Shah Rukh Khan didn't have any input in this one getting released. It seemed to be pieced together, didn't flow well, and left me and those who viewed it with me confused.",1334880000,,316,4.112903225806452
