8561794,5,B00B2TUQTI,Good experience looking at life which has value. Worthwhile in all ways possible. Funny too.,1494547200,,92,5.2
8561795,5,B00B2TUQTI,"Books don't get more beautiful than the ones being printed by Steidl Verlag.  This is an illuminating portrait of a man on a mission, and the production and output of his singular publishing house.",1487635200,,197,4.794117647058823
8561796,5,B00B2TUQTI,"Thinking it would interest me, wife borrowed a copy of this documentary from  our local public library. It  might be considered boring except to  publishers or book-binders like me and, although there isn't  much about the book-binding aspect of specialty publishing, Gerhard Steidl is such an engaging character and the film is so well done I feel it's well worth watching from start to finish by anyone and is why I wanted to own a copy

It's ,mostly in English, often sprinkled with German (sometimes with subtitling and sometimes without) which I didn't find an impediment to my enjoyment.",1444953600,,593,4.94949494949495
8561797,4,B00B2TUQTI,"I have seen this documentary three times and will no doubt watch it again.  It was very difficult for me even to choose the number of stars to give it.  One of the two previous reviews loved it and one said it was superficial.  In a way I agree with both.  Most of it has to do with Steidl going on various business trips to discuss current projects with photographers.  The problem is that you don't get to learn much in the process either about how to make a book with Steidl or about who the photographers are and why doing their books is important.  It's almost as if there are two unfinished documentaries going at once.  And yet, and yet...  Steidl's passion and integrity come through sufficiently, and are sufficiently compelling, that I keep going back to take the trip.  In these days when bottom-line ignoramuses, who probably don't even read books, turn out truly squalid editions of works that deserve the utmost respect, I could not agree more with Steidl's philosophy of the book, with the importance of its heft and smell and the feel of the pages and the quality of the images and the lettering.  In fact, I wish it were a scratch-and-sniff documentary so that I'd get to share all the ink smells he keeps mentioning.  So, yes, there are problems with the production--mostly that there isn't enough of it.  But if you love books, you will love it anyway, and you will certainly develop an affectionate respect for Mr. Steidl's magnificent obsession.",1389312000,4,1466,4.6395348837209305
8561798,3,B00B2TUQTI,It's not a very deep documentary. I thought I was going to get to know and discover who is Steidl and how he makes his books but you don't get that from this. It's quite superficial and the only project you follow throughout the process is not very interesting at all.,1383955200,2,268,4.2745098039215685
8561799,5,B00B2TUQTI,"This 2010 documentary about Gerhard Steidl's publishing company is an absolute treat worth more than 5 stars. From  Mr. Steidl himself, to the many luminaries he has published, to his absolute dedication  to product quality - the printing, the paper, the binding, the smell of the varnish - this is a tribute to the bookmaker's craft and illustrates  why the iPad will never replace the physical book - and why Taschen is not in the same league as Steidl. Mr. Steidl is also a character from his dedication to publishing  (check the Steidl catalog to see how prolific this publishing house is), his emphasis on printing on his own presses in Germany, his unique interactions/relationships with his clients - the recurring piece on iDubai is fascinating if at times irritating, the air conditioned trailer version of the tent in Qatar - as well as his array of iPods. A wonderful way to spend 88 minutes and to feel that there may still be hope for Western civilization.",1369699200,4,969,4.7844311377245505
