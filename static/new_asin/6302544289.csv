479249,5,6302544289,Good bloody fun from start to finish. It's a fairly short film that doesn't out-stay its welcome or take itself too seriously.

I like this one by Stephen King, but it is an older movie and one has to allow for that. It is a bit corny and things don't always make sense. It's not a horror movie by today's standards but it was like a nice stroll down memory lane of what we used to think was a bit scary.

479273,5,6302544289,"This movie is pure camp, Stephen King set out to create the perfect 'B' movie for laughs and succeeded wildly. Enjoy, this is not a true horror movie. At the end you'll be cheering Clovis the cat, our hero. Very funny.",1504483200,,218,4.341463414634147
479274,4,6302544289,"Stephen king says what is really scary is when you are just in the realm of reality and possibility. Then the spooky extraordinary seems scarier because this may be taking place next door.

This is a pretty good adoption from print to the screen. Of course the disadvantage is selecting what to show. The big advantage is not having to use the King potty mouth on every sentence. A few descriptive words are needed for the ambiance but King goes overboard in his writing.

Alice Krige the Borg queen and ghost is the perfect person to play Mary Brady as she can be so sweet and forceful at the same time.

If you look close you will see Stephen King as the Cemetery Caretaker. He is a much better token than Alfred Hitchcock

We all know that there is some truth to fantastic creatures reported through the ages. This is the story of a pair of the last of a bread of shape shifting creatures called Sleepwalkers. They are a very close nit mother and son. They must live on the life essence of good girls and at all costs must avoid cats as cats are the mortal enemy of Sleepwalkers. Watch as they barley escape with their lives and set-up house in a rural community.",1504483200,,1244,4.723502304147465

Sleepwalkers isn't a great movie but it is definitely great in story, in how bad the special effects are, and in how clich it is.

479327,4,6302544289,"It hasn't been a balanced ratio at all, that of stellar Stephen King movies versus the craptacular adaptations. For each Misery and Stand By Me and Shawshank Redemption, there are heaps more the likes of Maximum Overdrive or Dreamcatcher or Sometimes They Come Back or this one, Sleepwalkers. Stephen King penned the story and even has a cameo in it.

The plot mines ancient Egyptian mythology in presenting a monstrous, soul-sucking mother-and-son duo. Predatory were-cats Mary Brady (Alice Krige) and her teen son Charles (Brian Krause) have just moved into a sleepy Indiana town, on the prowl for new prey, specifically virgins whose innocent life force the Bradys require for sustenance. We soon eyeball Charles' gorgeous, fresh-faced schoolmate Tanya Robertson (Mdchen Amick) with whom Charles seems immediately besotted, to the extent tht our creepy boy is carving her first name initial into his arm. At this stage of the movie, we're not sure what the hell is going on, a wobbly state of affairs that becomes status quo for the remainder of the movie. Is Charles truly smitten with Tanya? Or is he setting her up?

1992's Sleepwalkers - excuse me, Stephen King's Sleepwalkers - is one bonkers movie, replete with oddball characters and utterly berserk situations. Its Random Cameo game is wicked strong, what with Mark Hamill and Ron Perlman as cops, and directors John Landis and Joe Dante as lab technicians, and horror meisters Clive Barker and Tobe Hooper as forensic technicians, and Stephen King himself as a cemetery caretaker, all dropping in for a fleeting mo. There are several boss deaths in this one, and violence that juggles the gory with the slapstick. I feel that the movie's secret sauce is Alice Krige whose mama were-cat is ridiculously sensual and so badass she fatally stabs someone with a corncob (yes, a corncob!) and then beats up Ron Perlman with his own dang elbow! Others may know Alice Krige as the Borg Queen. Me, I know her as the salacious and barmy mama were-cat.

You want zany? This movie brings the crazy, brings the ick factor. Slain, strung-up cats! A deputy sheriff who sings the weirdest profane songs to his cat Clovis. Shapeshifting cars! Invisibility! Dumb rednecks getting murdered all over the place! A creepy teacher who's also a sexual predator. And incest. So much incest. Even Jaime and Cersei Lannister are saying, ""Man, that's just wrong.""

Awful movies like this should be consigned to the dusty back bins of whatever video rental stores are still hanging on. Sometimes, though, awful movies redeem themselves, and that's what Sleepwalkers does. It's so bad and campy and daft that it unintentionally becomes watchable and hugely entertaining. This makes perfect fodder to get ripped by Mystery Science Theater 3000 or by you and your drunken homies. It's awesomely quotable, my two favorite quotes being when Charles plunges a pencil into a lawman's ear canal and yells, ""Cop-kabob!"" And then there's Charles' parting words to Tanya at the graveyard that reference her mother's passion for gravestone rubbings. I had to hijack the quote for the review title.

So what's the deal with all them cats hanging around? It's to do with the ancient Egyptian chestnut that purports cats to be guardians of the Underworld. If so, it makes sense that cats would identify the Bradys as supernatural threats... Anyway, 4 out of 5 stars for this one. It's incredibly entertaining.",1501459200,,3427,5.026408450704225
479328,5,6302544289,Dank movie,1500336000,,10,4.5
479329,5,6302544289,"This is a Great mid-budget Genre film. Top synthesis of 'southern gothic', macabre and kooky tongue in cheek taboo to black humor, with a tale of hidden identities and cat fangs that hunger for the life force of virginal young woman to survive.

The three leads are particularly cinematic (with well done secondary characters also) in the realisation of the film's tonal world, with the beautiful, nice/wholesum and fiesty college gir; eerie, tragic and psychotic luscious mother; charming, cold blooded and conflicted son who develops a crush on the girl. The film has a dark supernatural drama and unease social pathos, which is often just underneath it's also irreverent humor with  the film's horror and school coming of age type Genre tropes.

 The Sleepwalkers are evil yet sympathetic in their dying supernatural plight and magical allure. It is intimated in the film that they are ancient and have origins related to ancient Egypt, & also that there are others still in the world. I see them as not diretly related to humans but from some kind of stranded Alien happenings dating from ancient Egypt, hence their true form, and also this world's clash with Cats who sense their presence and are their natural enemy, as in a sense they are two forms of cats from two different dimensions clashing.

 The film has some good sounds also, particularly the Enya track Boadicea, which is very fitting to the creatively realised feel of the underlying drama to this top Genre film.",1499558400,,1481,4.927710843373494

479376,5,6302544289,"Pretty decent transfer on the bluray. A long time ago, I began collecting movies that were film adaptations of Stephen King books. I have all of them on DVD. A couple of years ago I began collecting them on Bluray as well. I think I have all of them now that have been released to this point. Sleepwalkers is one of the better ones. The young lady that plays Tanya is BEAUTIFUL. Most of his books are creepy and without a doubt, the incest in this movie is hella creepy. Only has 2 ch. audio, and does include subtitles. There are no special features. Picture is noticeably better than the DVD. I remember seeing this movie in the theater. I cannot believe it's 25 years old!!!",1493856000,3,677,4.380952380952381
479377,1,6302544289,"How in the world does this movie have a 4.3 average? Sleepwalkers is seriously one of the dumbest, cheesiest, most ridiculous movies I've ever seen. The movie can only be watched as a comedy. There's not much original, all of the clich&eacute;s can be seen in better movies than this. Stephen King is certainly one of the greatest fiction writers of all time, but all that talent is nowhere to be seen when it comes to his screenplays. If you like cheesy Stephen King movies, you'll love it, but how anyone can actually like this movie for real is beyond me.",1493510400,,558,4.534653465346534

has been given a new HD transfer by Image entertainment
this new Transfer is pretty Good better picture quality in 1: 85:1 ratio, better than the dvd version
the sound quality has not changed, on the back cover it says Audio mix is 5.1 master audio
well this is Dead wrong, the sound quality is just standard 2.0 stereo mix which is similar to the Audio sound on the dvd
of course no new special features,
a new retrospective featurette with stephen King, Mick Garris or actress Madchen Amick would've been Great
but Image entertainment did not bother making an effort-what a surprise
all you get is the same Theatrical trailer that was on the old dvd version
amazon.com are selling this for $10, what a ripoff, this blu-ray is only worth $5 or less
so if you have the old dvd version keep it, this new blu-ray is waste of money

479612,2,6302544289,"What is it with so many Stephen King adaptions?

 The themes are usually interesting as hell but rarely to they ever convert to anything remotely legible on screen. Scoop up Sleepwalkers - a simply little film (that could have been more) ond an odd mother-son relationship that should send any young virgin screaming for the heels.

 Kings novel delved into the intriguing mythological background of the sleepwalkers but here the plot doesn't even try. King guru Mick Garris is at it again and thus far he's almost always dissapointed me. The story that's left over is nothing impressive.

 As a basic explanation, sleepwalkers are monsters that feed on the virginity of virgin girls. Mother and son Mary and Charles Brady move to a small town and focus on a teenager, Tanya Robertson. Plans go awry and the girl escapes, causing further hell to break loose.

 King scripted the screenplay himself and I wish they would outlaw this. DON'T DO THAT!!

 But it was fun seeing Tobe Hooper, John Landis, Clive Barker, Stephen King and Joe Dante all do cameos.

 One thing the film does have is pretty brutal deaths, even if they are a bit cheesy. Death by corn?? Gore is plentiful enough but with a low budget.

 Humor is tasteless for the most part and all this together equals King brand name cheese that's been churned out from some of his other films.

 The only thing truly scary about this film is that Charles is banging his own mother. Their relationship is obviously made to look endearing and ""protective"" - but and may indeed by the only redeeming qualities this flick has going for it. This ""relationship"" that screams dysfunction to me wasn't enough to save whatever else the movie tried to attempt.

 Brian Kruse (Charles) is a good actor cursed with s***ty dialogue and behavior. Tanya, the ""innocent"", (Madchen Amick) reall did come across as sugar-pie sweet. Alice Kringe as ""mom"" is great and deserves better than this role.

 Everything happens pretty fast so the pace is not boring, but there's just nothing here to really hold my attention. Worth watching on TV if you've never seen it but not much else. Definitely not worthy of owning or paying more than a few bucks for, and not something that warrants much revisiting.",1379635200,,2238,4.778645833333333

A mother and son move to a new town (Castle Rock? I don't remember) and the son starts at his new school, where he promptly falls for the school's girl next door hottie.  Danger and action ensue as he stalks her at night and charms her during the day.

These aren't humans by the way.  They're some hybrid thereof, but the only way to really kill them is by cat.  A scratch or bite is their stake.

479665,4,6302544289,"This is a film that was on my ""hope comes to blu-ray list"" along with ""They Live"" which releases on 11/6. This is a classic horror film from the 90's era; though some may argue that ""Stephen King's Sleepwalkers"" is not a horror film or it simply has some horror elements. Nevertheless, it is a very fun film to watch higlighted by Enya's beautiful song ""Boadicea"". There are not really any stellar acting performances, but some very memorable ones. Dan Martin's performance as police officer Andy is classic. The songs he sings, his dialogue and his phrases are hilarious; especially his ""hold the phone line"". Dan Martin's acting have a sense of charm in his character role. Alice Krige does deliver a dark, sinister character very well. Even smart mouth and sarcastic Ron Perlman delivers. As far as horror, some of the creepiest scenes in the film are when the mirror reveals what the sleepwalkers really look like; quite creepy. But honestly, by the end of the film, you end up feeling sorry for the ""Sleepwalkers"". But on to the blu-ray. This blu-ray delivers exactly what I was expecting: a nice detailed 1080p transfer with no massive tampering. The daylight scenes look really good. Overall, I would recommend this catalog title to any horror fan, Stephen King fan or monster film fan. What I enjoyed is that the filmmakers didn't try to take the film too serious which enables the viewers to just have a good time watching the film. Many may call the film campy, yeah there is some camp to the film. But I think that Alice Krige and Dan Martin carry the film very well with their performances.",1347062400,3,1602,4.704626334519573

479674,3,6302544289,"Giant incestuous demon cats who suck the life force from virgins... sure, why not? That's the concept behind ""Sleepwalkers,"" a Stephen King horror movie that rarely actually manages to be scary -- but there is enough entertaining cheez here, as well as brilliant performances by Alice Krige and Sparks.

Charles Brady (Brian Krause) and his mother Mary (Krige) have just moved to a small town. And we soon discover that they are ""sleepwalkers"": giant incestuous cats who suck the life force from virgins, and are really freaked out by actual cats (who apparently sit outside their house waiting to kill them). Mary is literally starving to death, so Charles has to find a virgin quickly.

Charles soon homes in on the virginal Tanya Robertson (Madchick Amick), and sets about seducing her -- but when he tries to kill her, he ends up horribly wounded by a cop's cat. Now the sleepwalkers are even more desperate to get their hands on Tanya, and are willing to kill anyone who gets in the way of their food.

""Sleepwalkers"" has a really cool idea... but honestly it's not very scary most of the time. Director Mick Garris seems to wuss out on some of the potentially scary scenes (like the rapey graveyard scene), with goofy angles and one-liners. I mean, it's hard to be scared when Madchen Amick is popping her screaming fact right near the camera. Instead, it becomes a massive ball of cheesy, over-the-top gore and rubber cat suits.

Fortunately, a lot of the cheesiness is still very entertaining in a B-movie way, especially when the sleepwalkers stop pretending to be human and go all-out in their monstrousness. I will admit, though, some of the scenes late in the movie ARE very creepy, but that's mainly because Krige's character is absolutely insane. The scene where she forces Tanya to ""dance"" with her half-dead son is chilling.

One big downside: we never learn much about the sleepwalkers. We know the basics, but no backstory or explanations for why cats hate them or whatever.

Unsurprisingly, Krige gives the best human performance of this movie -- she's creepy, weird and inhuman, especially she goes all angry mama-bear/lover. Amick spends most of the movie crying and screaming, Krause is moderately sympathetic as a monstrous creature who wants to save his mother/lover, and Ron Perlman is criminally underused. Keep an eye out for Stephen King in the funniest authorial cameo I have ever seen.

But of course, there's the scene-stealer and a truly awesome actor: Sparks the cat. I am not kidding. This kitty is completely convincing (such as when Clovis views his dead owner), and he kicks... er, claws butt on not one but TWO occasions.

""Sleepwalkers"" isn't scary at all, but it is brainlessly, amusingly gory and cheesy -- and the performances by Krige and Sparks are excellent.",1286150400,3,2803,4.89873417721519

479718,4,6302544289,"Sleepwalkers! One of those fun early 90s horror flicks that just kinda came and went, not to really be thought about again, kinda like Popcorn or Brainscan.  Not saying those films are terrible, they certainly had entertainment value, just not impressive enough to remain in the forefront of your mind when recalling past horror films.  Many folks have seen this movie, as it was a minor hit at the time.  The big sell here is that it was Stephen King's first screenplay not based on one of his novels or short stories, and written especially for the screen.
It's pretty much always been looked at as a merely so-so or just plain lousy movie.  I like it, I think it's kinda fun.
As if you didn't already know or just need a refresher, Alice Krige and her son played by Brian Krause are ""sleepwalkers"", an ancient race of cat-people type creatures that shapeshift into human forms and can make themselves or other objects invisible(or change appearance altogether).  They have to stay on the run as they tend to get in trouble where ever they go.  They're deathly afraid of cats, and go so far as to set up bear traps around their house to kill the amassing army of cats on the property.  Mom and son are also lovers.  It's never really explained(very little of the ""sleepwalkers"" lore is) if this incest thing is typical of the species, or, as Mr. Rooney said in Ferris Bueller's Day Off, ""So, that's how it is in their family"".  They also feast on virgin souls for strength(I assume the blue light ray being sucked out of Madchen Amick's gorgeous mouth is a soul).
Alice Krige is weakening and needs to eat, so she sends her son to woo Madchen Amick so he can lure her back to mom.  Amick is smitten, but escapes Krause's attack and leaves him mortally wounded.  Pissed at what's become of her son, Krige goes on a rampage to get Amick.
Like I said, fun movie.  Not great, quite silly at times, and never what you would call scary, but fun.  It was directed by King nut and Masters of Horror creator Mick Garris.  Garris, being the horror fan he is, stuffed this film with cameos by horror icons such as Clive Barker, Joe Dante, Tobe Hooper, John Landis, and of course King himself.  So I don't think the film is supposed to be taken too seriously.  Though it may be kinda forgotten and not always looked upon too highly, Sleepwalkers is worth revisiting for a glimpse at back when horror films still had a sense of fantasy and weren't trying to be so damn serious and brutal.",1278028800,,2477,4.4832962138084635

479726,4,6302544289,"Sleepwalkers has all the elements of a horror movie, and yet it isn't one. The first scene is very effective, and sets the tone for a good horror movie. We see Mark Hamill (unrecognizable from his Luke Skywalker days) as a cop checking out some odd goings-on at a house. But I wonder - did the girl scream or was she already dead? Or was it a dead body that screamed? The music and imagery during the opening credits is great. There's a definition of a sleepwalker from an old occult encyclopedia. The ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics and art look really cool. The sketch of a sleepwalker breastfeeding an infant looks scary. The thought that the infant might actually be a human being makes the sketch even more unsettling. Anyway, that first scene and the opening credits create an atmosphere of dread that we would expect to last throughout the rest of the movie. But Stephen King (who wrote the script) and director Mick Garris wanted to make a movie that was campy AND scary at the same time. Unfortunately, they failed to deliver with regard to the scares, but they do provide us with some good laughs. Sleepwalkers is a good movie, it's just not as good as it was meant to be. It's almost impossible for a movie to be both campy and scary, but I regard House of 1000 Corpses as a rare exception.

I think of Sleepwalkers as more of a comedy than a horror movie, just because there are so few moments that anyone would find scary (even though this movie terrified me when I was a kid). There's a lot of moments when this movie tries to be scary, but falls short, because the suspense is undermined by jokes or humorous incidents. All the murders are amusing for one reason or another. How can a murder be amusing? Watch this movie and you'll see what I mean - a lot of the murders look really silly, like when a Sheriff is bodyslammed on a picket fence. I think this movie works best as a comedy anyway. If the guys that made Sleepwalkers cut out all the funny stuff and just tried to go for the chills, then I think I would have enjoyed this movie a lot less.

In a nutshell, a mother and son are demonic shapeshifters called sleepwalkers that feed off the life-force of virgin women. Normally they take the form of human beings, so that they can go about daily life unnoticed. The incestuous behaviour of Mary Brady (Alice Krige) and her son Charles (Brian Krause) is disturbing, but for some reason it doesn't have any shock effect at all once it becomes apparent they aren't human. I suppose it's because I expect non-humans to do things that humankind considers perverse. But I also liked the way this movie made a nice instrumental like Santo and Johnny's `Sleepwalk' sound evil and creepy. Enya's `Boadicea' makes for good background music in the opening scene, but not when it shows Charles leaving the theatre - it just doesn't seem to suit the light-hearted nature of that scene. But when it plays at the end of the movie it suits that scene perfectly, and it runs on through the end credits.

I also like how the heroine Tanya Robertson (Madchen Amick) is a klutz, socially awkward, a nerd, and can resort to extreme acts of violence to defend herself. And I like how the teachers use corporal punishment on the kids, like rapping their knuckles with plastic rulers, or dragging them by the ear to the principal's office. The entertaining teacher Mr. Fallows (Glenn Shadix) has a few hilarious exchanges with Charles. Even Mr. Fallows' fatal run-in with Charles is somewhat of a light-hearted moment, thanks to Charles' wit. And the high-speed chase with the stressed out patrolman Andy Simpson (the excellent Dan Martin) is hilarious. I've seen Dan Martin in all kinds of stuff, so why is he still not getting the recognition he deserves?

The scene where Andy gets out of his car and stands in the middle of the deserted highway was good, but it would have been more effective if the viewer didn't know that Charles' car was invisible until AFTER Andy drove away. And that scene would have been more effective if he didn't curse (and say some really goofy words) out loud. A rather chilling scene was when Mrs. Brady puts the rose in Tanya's hair and says ""There. It finishes you somehow."" The coolest scene of the movie is when it shows Mrs. Brady lying on the ground, completely engulfed in flames. The most disturbing scene is when Tanya's arm gets cut on the broken glass of a police car window. And it was pretty cool when Mrs. Brady blows up the police cars, even if there was no realistic way they could have blown up like that.

I like cats, but all the cats in this movie are annoying. The scene of the cats running down the street to the Brady house is completely preposterous. But if there were no cats in this movie then there would be a problem, because a cat's scratch is the only thing that can harm a sleepwalker. I'm not sure if sleepwalkers are an actual legend or if Mr. King dreamed them up himself. If he did, why would he make a cat's scratch the only thing that can kill a sleepwalker? Something a little less complicated would have been better.

The guys that made this movie deserve a round of applause - it's hard as hell to make a movie that's funny AND scary, but in the case of Sleepwalkers they weren't just trying to be funny - they were trying to be HILARIOUS. Can a movie that's hilarious be scary? Some (but certainly not all) movies work because they don't take themselves seriously, like Sleepaway Camp 2. But in the case of Sleepwalkers it tries so hard to be funny that it can't be scary.",1155168000,18,5543,4.504970178926441
479754,2,6302544289,"I love watching movie adaptations of Stephen King's work. When I came across ""Sleepwalkers"", I thought it would be interesting. However, I was a little skeptic because I hadn't ever heard of it, but then realized that King directly made this into a movie without making it a book first. After watching the entire movie, I can clearly say that unless you are a die-hard King fan, you can avoid this movie at all costs.

The story is about the Brady family consisting of Charles (acted by Brian Krause, who nowadays is famous for his role as 'Leo' in the hit TV show ""Charmed"") and his mother Mary (played by Alice Krige), who move to Travis, Indiana. However, we know from the beginning that they are not who they say they are; in fact, they aren't even human beings. They are the Sleepwalkers - shape shifting creatures who feast on female virgins to keep themselves alive. Their only flaw is that they are vulnerable to cats. Anyway, Charles has his eyes on his next victim, who happens to be a high school cheerleader called Tanya (played by Mdchen Amick) and enrolls in the same class as her to seduce her. Will the Sleepwalkers be stopped in time or is it the end for Tanya?

I really wanted to enjoy this movie, but there are SO many holes in the storyline, which makes me confused to enjoy it, such as:

1) In the first scene of the movie, we see a bunch of dead cats hanging around the house, which proves that the Sleepwalkers can fight it and kill it. If that's the case, why were Charles and his mother afraid to even go outside their house to fight the cats off, instead of putting lame traps around them? We know they are not like vampires, and can walk during daylight.

2) When Tanya comes over to see Charles in his home, Charles realizes that the mirror reflects their true appearance, and pushes them to another room. So he knows he should avoid mirrors and other things, but yet in the graveyard, he lets Tanya take pictures of him? What's that all about? Okay, once or twice is fine, but he doesn't even stop her!

3) Thirdly, as Michael R Gates mentioned in his review, what is the point of the incest scenes between Charles and his mother? It doesn't progress the story in any way at all. It's not like they are mating to reproduce another of their kind (which would have made more sense).

There are many more questions, but I don't want to bore you with the details. The point is this movie was too confusing and silly to even enjoy it. The plus point is, the cast acted well, and we get to see King himself make an appearance, along with other horror creators Clive Barker and Tobe Hooper. Unfortunately, even with the cast, the story doesn't get any better. In fact, I felt sorry for the Sleepwalkers, because they are alone and they just need to keep themselves alive.

All in all, you can watch this movie if you have a lot of free time on your hands, but don't rent it in hopes of getting scared, or seeing something interesting, unless you are a fan of one of the cast members.",1153612800,2,3006,4.39568345323741

Dont expect something too deep, save that for the later Garris films. This one is superficial fun. Gory, nicley paced- some truly wonderful camera movements

(absolute favourite- when Charles and Tanya roll across the ground and the camera rolls with them; at first its a parody of the romantic cliche, but the camera keeps on moving, and suddenly its dangerous- then the shot ends, and the entire scene is different; really well done).

479756,1,6302544289,"Arguably one of the worst flicks to which the name of horror master Stephen King is connected, 1992's SLEEPWALKERS was touted as the ""first King story written expressly for the screen.""  Unfortunately, King must have written the story when he himself was sleepwalking, 'cause the flick's a genuine snooze-fest.

The story is set in a small midwestern town, where Mrs. Brady (Alice Krige) and her son, Charles (Brian Krause), have settled.  But though they share the surname of that venerable family of classic TV, the resemblance ends there, as the members of THIS Brady family are long-lived shape-shifting monsters called Sleepwalkers--why they are known by this particular moniker is never really clear--sort of half-human, half-feline demons who feed off the life force of female virgins.

Although they have successfully assimilated themselves into the lifestyle of their small town, the Sleepwalker's cover is soon blown when Charles obsesses on having classmate Tanya (Madchen Amick) for his next victim.  But it's not the town Sheriff nor seasoned monster-hunters who save Tanya and the rest of the town from the seemingly all-powerful Sleepwalkers.  No, it's Tanya's cat, Klovis, and his feline friends who save the day.  Turns out that Sleepwalkers and domestic house cats have been mortal enemies for centuries, and our feline friends are the only thing that have any sort of power over the deadly demons.

For the most part, the plot of SLEEPWALKERS is nonsensical, and though the audience is given some flimsy clues here and there, having Klovis the cat turn out to be the Van Helsing of the Sleepwalker universe comes across as a Deus ex Machina of the corniest kind.  Even worse, the script's dialogue is mostly ludicrous, and the incestuous relationship between Mrs. Brady and son seems unnecessary and extraneous to the overall story (what little there is of a story).  Definitely not King's best effort.

Still, SLEEPWALKERS is not without a few minor virtues.  There are cameo appearances by King and his horror-maven friends John Landis, Joe Dante, Clive Barker, and Tobe Hooper.  Genre fans will also get a kick out of the inside-joke casting of actor Ron Perlman as police captain Soames. (For the uninitiated, Perlman rose to fame portraying the titular feline-like beast in the 1980s TV series BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.)  Also, the film's theme song, a creepy but catchy little ditty called ""Sleepwalk,"" is really cool and has become a staple on a myriad of Halloween- and horror-themed web sites. Alas, these virtues just aren't enough to raise the quality of the overall flick.

Though the DVD from Columbia-Tristar does feature the film in both anamorphic widescreen and pan-and-scan, the disc is a no-frills offering that has nothing to entice horror fans to add the film to their collections (an interview with King would've been nice).  No wonder SLEEPWALKERS often ends up in the bargain bins at discount stores.

In short, SLEEPWALKERS is a rather lame horror flick.  As Stephen King's first direct-to-screen offering, it might be of minor interest to fans of the horror maven, but most other viewers will want to steer clear of this clunker.",1143504000,6,3170,5.098646034816247
479757,3,6302544289,"An odd lycanthropic thriller dealing with an incestuous mother and son living in a country house which becomes surrounded by cats, which the two seem to fear. So much so, that they set up traps on the lawn, which does not seem to work on the feral felines. Turns out they are a couple of real ""cat people"" themselves, who hunger for the lifeforce of virginal girls, and it is up to the blonde, blue-eyed son to acquire these for his hungry mother. He drives an electric blue Trans-Am AND a cherry red Mustang {the two transform into one another}  - what better way to attract young impressionable females? And has aryan looks to boot. He finds a local girl who becomes enamoured with him, and it is not until they spend a romantic  afternoon at the cemetary to go grave-rubbing and photographing, that her lust invokes the beast within him, as he eventually begins to orally draw her ""soul"" forth. They struggle and she becomes horrified at his true appearence, which resembles the vampires from 'Buffy'.

Earlier on, he went on a speeding frenzy likened a Dukes of Hazard sequence, after being confronted by an obnoxiously nosey teacher who in My opinion, really derived what he deserved. An aleurophile cop persues, who has a cat as partner, and becomes disturbed by the sleepwalker's morphing face after it noticed the hissing cat in the car - he eventually literally disappears, car and all. The frustrated officer swears to catch him. Later, when he finally spots the car parked outside the cemetary, he goes to investigate, and is met by the screaming girl, and soon by the ""sleepwalker"", who receives a shot from the cop's gun, which does not seem to phase him, although being attacked by the cat renders him veritably mangled, and returns to mother.

The girl is kidnapped by mother sleepwalker and is forced to dance with the zombified corpse of the boy via telekinetic manipulation, until the Police arrive and the girl breaks free from her influence.

Highlights include Stephen King and Clive Barker cameo appearences as a cemetary caretaker and a forensic technician.",1121644800,2,2080,4.815126050420168

479761,3,6302544289,"Ever since Alice Krige burst onto the scene in the much better movie GHOST STORY, she's never really achieved the status she's deserved.  Blessed with an earthy, yet sensual, beauty, and a formidable acting range, Ms. Krige brings her usual glow to this Stephen King misstep.  SLEEPWALKERS has much potential that is never fully realized.  Alice plays the lovely shapeshifting mother to hunky young Brian Krause (more looks than talent).  For some reason, she can't feed on her own (they're like vampires or something), so she sends her boy out to do the hunting for her.  King spares little in the incestuous relationship they share, giving us several sexual scenes that cement their bizarre relationship.  Krause finds himself falling for the virginal Madchen Amick (TWIN PEAKS) and sets out to prepare her for Mom's dinner.  For some reason, even though these shapeshifters seem a little feline themselves, the scratch of an ordinary cat can kill them.  Thus, we have hundreds of cats on the prowl, including the plucky Clovis who proves to be a rather formidable opponent to the shapeshifters.  Director Mick Garris handles things efficiently, even giving us cameos from author King, Clive Baker, Joe Dante, and Tobe Hooper.  Ron Perlman shows up as a goofy state trooper; Jim Haynie is the reliable sheriff, and Cindy Pickett and Lyman Ward do well as Amick's parents.  The corn stabbing scene is pretty ludicrous if original, and the ending dissolves into unbelievable antics.  It's certainly not one of King's high points, but it entertains and has some clever transformations.  If it weren't for CARRIE, SALEMS LOT and DEAD ZONE, King would have very few successes on the silver screen.",1108080000,,1694,5.0503597122302155

I'd pretty much sit through anything with Alice Krige in it. The down side is that although the mother and son are interesting beings, the curiosity about them the movie arouses is not satisfied. What are they? A kind of feline lineage is hinted at as they can morph into variations of cat like creatures yet cats are their mortal enemies (a scratch can be fatal). Where are they from? Egypt is hinted at (the origin of the worship of Bast, perhaps). Why are they called Sleepwalkers (origins of the incubus/succubus/vampire mythologies)?  And what is it about virginity?!

479784,3,6302544289,"Stephen King's Sleepwalkers is a fairly-good B-movie. Most of it is enjoyably watchable, due mainly to the easy-on-the-eyes-ability of its lead cast members Brian Krause, Alice Krige, and Madchen Amick. Then there are the cringeworthy moments: the violent moments that are both poorly executed and overly gory, as well as the disturbing dance sequences (creepy incestuous slow dance/hottie teenybopping with a carpet-sweeper ) early in the film.
There are a number of nicely put together scenes in the movie: the Trans Am chase, Krause and Amick at her house, as well as Krige's first two scenes with Amick. The ""superpowers"" of the Sleepwalkers are nice and original, but much of their history is left to our imagination. We are given some backstory via an ""encyclopedia"" definition, a snippet of Krause's creative writing assignment, and a few comments dropped here and there by Krause and Krige, though more would have been helpful. Questions remain as to why Krige can't ""feed"" herself and whether or not the Sleepwalkers are actually made of Meow Mix (how else can you explain the scene where cats troop through downtown Travis, Indiana, in pursuit of Krige)?
Plot holes? Certainly. Cameos by directors who ought to stay behind the camera instead of in front of one? Definitely. While the movie isn't exactly played for laughs and never fully descends into the campy netherworld, it's hard to take it too seriously. DVD extras are severely limited - although if you want to learn to read in Thai or Portuguese you're in luck because those are two of the seven sets of subtitles included on the disc.
For an original screenplay, Stephen King has put together a decent story. Were it a novel, we'd likely get the missing backstory (frustratingly, the movie wasn't novelized), but as it stands the story is pretty good - okay, the corn killing is lame, but for the most part things make sense. It would have been nice if some of the effects were less fakey or there had been a few more extras on the DVD (Sleepwalkers movie trailer, Writer/Director commentaries, deleted scenes), but for a few bucks you still get your money's worth.

The mother is tall, thin and beautiful, with long, silky hair and a bone structure to die for. The kid is a blond non-entity. I always wanted more of that mother-son thing and less of everything else.
I don't care about the teen-aged girl and I never could stand the actress that plays her part - but here she is at her youngest and least obnoxious.

479787,3,6302544289,"Stephen King's Sleepwalkers is significant for a number of reasons (all of which added together fail to make this anything more than an average film).  For one thing, it is the first story King wrote expressly for a movie (his earlier movies all being based on previously published work).  Second, there is a wonderful cameo appearance by King himself, and this time he's not alone; both Tobe Hooper and the rarely seen Clive Barker join in the fun as forensics experts, while John Landis and Joe Dante also sneakily pass in front of the cameras.  A third, and by far the weirdest, special little aspect of this film is the really close (and I mean really, really close) relationship between the mother and her only son.  A fourth distinguishing characteristic of Sleepwalkers is its overuse of silly clich&eacute;s and ridiculous dialogue; this serves to negate any chance of the film actually being horrifying.  I hate to say it, but this movie is downright silly.
The genesis of this story sounds pretty good, actually.  Drawing upon ancient stories and the highly mysterious history of cats, the film brings to life two modern-day ""Sleepwalkers,"" a mother and son forced to constantly roam around the country as a direct result of their unusual feeding habits.  Some places just don't take too kindly to having their citizens slaughtered and fed off of.  The mother is now especially hungry, and she is depending on her beloved son Charles to supply her needs.  These needs are rather specific, requiring a ""nice"" girl, and Charles has found the perfect such paragon of virtue and virginity in Tanya Robertson.  His plans for bringing Tanya home to Mother inevitably go awry, and the last half hour of the movie is an anticlimactic torture test and overacting marathon in the form of a story that seemingly refuses to end.  Brian Krause and Alice Krige actually play their roles rather well (not counting all of the silly dialogue they are forced to utter), and Madchen Amick is a lovely young woman who played her role of sacrifice-to-be in the brilliantly cheesy kind of way this script seemed to call for.  Amick also has the distinction of being the only woman in the world I would pay money to watch sweep the floor.
The talent of one actor can sometimes save a movie from utter disaster, and the real hero of Sleepwalkers accomplishes just such a feat.  This unsung hero is named Sparks, and he is outstanding in the role of Clovis the Attack Cat.  Clovis is the hero of Sleepwalkers; don't let anyone tell you any differently.  One sometimes wonders if cats are not the real overseers of this world.  Everyone knows how mysterious they are, how they seem to live lives of leisure, and how even the best of them interact with the human world on their own terms.  Sleepwalkers walk in utter fear of cats, deeply vulnerable to the merest slash from a cat's claw.  By instinct alone, cats recognize Sleepwalkers, and throughout this film they are camped en masse outside the home of our local shapeshifters, patiently waiting for the perfect time to strike and thus, once again, help preserve the lives of human beings who will never realize their indebtedness to these seemingly playful, lazy creatures.  Their constant vigil around the house of the Sleepwalkers provides the only remotely creepy aspect of the entire movie.  Without the cats, this movie would not be worth watching at all.",1052179200,5,3398,4.825862068965518

Sleepwalkers is by no doubt the best movie I have seen, but I thought it has some merit as being a good movie.  Sleepwalkers introduces you to these mysterious creatures that cats don't like.  They appear human most of the time but can change either voluntarily and sometimes involuntarily into their cat like forms.  They feed off human virgins it seems they suck their souls right out of them per oral.  The plot is kind of thin and it could have been more developed, but it was still pretty good.  The movie leaves a lot of questions about what these things are.  If you are a movie watcher that likes to know all the facts this may not be the movie for you.  The special effects were not all that great and I think the monster's appearance could have taken a little more attention, but I have never rated special effects above the plot.  I think maybe Sleepwalkers would have turned out better as a book opposed to a movie, where there would be more time to develop the plot, but this didn't happen, so I guess I will settle for the movie.",1038441600,15,1166,4.287671232876712

Sharing a house in one of those beautiful and idyllic northern California towns we see in countless straight-to-video/cable movies, they lead a life free of all cares except two: an army of cats, amassing in their front-yard, that recognize Mary and Charles for the soul-sucking and cat-like monsters they are; and how to find a young virgin girl to satisfy their hungers.  Mary and Charles, we soon learn, are more than they seem.  Going from town to town, fixating on virgin women who provide their only sustenance, the two are the last of their kind - only sometimes looking human (we can catch hints of their true appearances whenever they are near a mirror) - they can change their appearance as well as alter the appearance of anything else nearby like a car or a house.  Only the cats have no fear of Charles and Mary - rather it's the monsters who shy from them, and the reason becomes apparent in a fur-flying climax guaranteed to send PETA members into a fury.  While the cat army grows in their front yard (why the cats don't immediately attack isn't quite clear) Charles hunts for the next victim, quickly settling on Tanya Robertson (Madchen Amick - whose mom is NOT palyed here by the real Tanya Roberts).  Though first romancing her, Charles doesn't take long to show her his true side (I guess because she must remain a virgin, and he's afraid to ""spoil"" his dinner).  When Tanya proves no pushover, it's up to Mary to save the day.
""Sleepwalkers"" runs on cheap thrills, CGI effects and the sexual charge exuded by Alice Krige as Mary.  For a film that promises a lot (Stephen King, Clive Barker, Tobe Hooper, Joe Dante and John Landis all have cameos) however, it comes up short.  While the script doesn't reveal all about Charles and Mary immediately, it doesn't take long before it reveals just about everything we we're going to find out, leaving the lovely and evil Alice Krige to carry the entire movie.  Krige who can alternate between sweetly friendly and coldly and calculatingly evil is the flick's best effect, but one put to better use as the Borg Queen or as the vengeful phantasm of ""Ghost Story"".",1027209600,2,2234,4.647208121827411
479790,3,6302544289,"""Sleepwalkers"" is one of the better Stephen King movies and has all you'd expect from a B-class horror / fantasy flick such as this. The plot, while not over intelligent, holds some nice suprises. And some of the death scenes are awesome!

The cast is extraordinary for a rather cheap production such as this. Alice Krige, who some might remember as the Borg Queen of Star Trek fame, is excellent in the role of the evil mother. Also a must-see seeing is young Mdchen Amick, whom we know from ""Twin Peaks"" - she is as sexy as it gets and pulls off some really cute dancing that really blew me away. As a special bonus you get short appearances of Mark Hamill (Star Wars), Clive Barker (Hellraiser) and Stephen King himself.

The visual F/X were cutting-edge when the movie came out it 1992 - it was one of the first to feature computer-generated morphing effects. Still looks good today although not spectacular.

All in all, this movie is certainly not groundbreaking but you'll enjoy it if you're into this genre, can forgive some cheesiness and like movies with the certain ""cult"" effect.",1022198400,5,1091,4.671875

479792,1,6302544289,"Stephen King adapatations can usually be put into two categories - outstanding or awful.  This effort falls into the latter one.  It's about an incestuous mother and son who are sleepwalkers.  By this it means that they feed off smalltown virgins and are terrified of cats not, as you might imagine, that they walk in their sleep or even that they can only come out at night.  When the couple arrive at a new town they find the perfect candidate for their next meal.  However, as anyone who has watched a horror movie before will know, teenage girls are always stronger than they first appear.
It's hard to pinpoint what was worst about 'Sleepwalkers'.  The mother and son relationship is presented in front of the audience but never explored, just exploited with every reply being 'oh mother'.  The acting, too, is hammy.  Plus, there are very few scares as house cats represented as fearless demon killers is quite frankly ludicrous.  Still, there's something reasonably interesting in seeing a house surrounded by cats in a way reminiscent of Hitchcock's 'The Birds'.
If there's anything redeemable about this movie at all it's the special effects and make-up, which are highly impressive, and the spotting of various cameos from Stephen King, Tobe Hooper and Mark Hamill.  This is one of those rare movies that seems to take itself a little bit too seriously in straining to achieve some kind of sympathy for the hideoues sleepwalkers of the title.  In doing so, it actually becomes very amusing and has all the makings of a small cult classic.  But it's still atrocious.",1011744000,4,1575,4.857677902621723
479833,4,6302544289,"I thought this movie was pretty good, but mostly because they kept playing Sleepwalk by Santo & Jonny.  Decent action, cameos by King, Clive Barker and Mark Hammil (the cop at the beginning).  Always fun to look at Madchen Amick.",1010102400,2,229,4.7

The only bright spot is Alice Krige- she turns in one of her usual, ..performances.  Why this woman is not the biggest star on the planet, I'll never know.  She made this character, Eva in ""Ghost Story"", and the Borg Queen in the Star Trek movie so incredibly ..compelling I can't think why she doesn't get bigger jobs.

479836,3,6302544289,"I think the downfall of most movies based on works by Stephen King is that people expect content that is several levels above other films in the horror genre.
Sleepwalkers isn't high art, but it does what horror movies are supposed to do.  It takes a creepy or disturbing concept (in this case incest and a malevolent race living amongst us), mixes in a few scares, and keeps you entertained for an hour and a half.
The standout actor of the film is Alice Krige.  I've met Ms. Krige and she seems like a very nice lady.  That makes her amazing performances in movies like Sleepwalkers and Ghost Story even more enjoyable.  She brings a beauty and danger to her characters that you rarely see, and it's an element that is especially necessary in a horror film.
There will be people who give this film 5 stars and people who will give it 1.  To see which one you are, rent it first.  You may return it early, or you may get back on (...) and buy a copy for your collection.  I am giving it 3 stars because I was entertained (I've seen it twice on video and twice on television), but it didn't rank up there with classics like Halloween, The Shining, or The Exorcist.",986342400,2,1164,4.336405529953917
479837,3,6302544289,"Sleepwalkers is not the best Stephen King based film out there.  It has more than its far share of scares and jumps, but is boged down by a very slow pase.  It does carry with it an interesting story line of two creatures (a mother and son) who are the last of their kind trying to find some way to survive.  The son looks to a fellow female class mate to fit the bill.  With some decent special effects and an erie story line makes for a fun night.  Some may be put off by the film so i would say rent before you buy, it is perfect for thoes that hate cats!.

479838,5,6302544289,"Mick Garris, with the help of Clive Barker for special forensic effects and of Stephen King for the screenplay and the light episode of the Cemetary Caretaker, produces here a real master piece of suspense and beast hunting. The story goes back to the Egyptians, like Anne Rice did with her Queen of the Damned, but does not really expand on these old roots of those sleepwalkers, some ancesters of the vampires, some other legend coming from the deepest layers of our human race. It can be seen as a remake of The Cat People of old and of fame, but it is far more than that. All the magic of the modern world is there and these two beings that are chased and trapped in a small town never to get out of it anymore, are able to transform a peaceful little city into a havoc-ridden hell. We find in this film some of Stephen King's favorite themes. Young people, especially a young girl who let herself be mesmerized by a nice-looking boy with the only objective of getting some fun. There is no real depth in the relationship. The girl is agressive in her approach. She is careless and un-prudent at core. She is representative of the younger generation in its most reckless and mindless approach to life : pleasure first and at once. She even takes some wine along for the the cemetary visit and lawn luncheon, in case the boy may need some artificial incentive to fall in her trap. And she does not know she is the prey. The cemetary is of course fundamental in this film again, as so often in many films or books by Stephen King. It is a deep conviction that life must have its most magic and terrific roots in the land of the dead. It is a metaphor that the living are nothing but living deads on probation before they are admitted to the realm of the dead. Then of course the two sleepwalkers are a mother and a son. The family structure is perverted and distorted by the absence of a man, of a father. This is so common in Stephen King's works that it does not need any development. Then of course THE car. He makes it blue at first but cannot resist to go back to Christine and its pungent red. A car is always magical but also deadly and poisonous. A car is a mouse-trap that catches as many mice as any delirium tremens patient could imagine in a second. Have the car and you'll have anything, anyone you want. The beast of prey that this sleepwalker is cannot function with young people without this mirror of all vanities. Finally, and slightly overdone, hence bloodless like all overdone meat, the cats are there. Not one cat, like in Cat's Eyes, but a real company, a real army, a real legion of cats, and of course they are the real protectors of humanity. Cops are ineffective, powerless, unefficacious, but cats are the best of all beast-killers you can imagine. There are two types of men or women : those who love cats and those who love dogs. King is on the cat-side. It reveals a deep torment in his vision and in his desire to pillage the world and to loot its riches in order to produce the most intricate and fascinating stories of fear, horror, fright and unconscious death instinct and death attraction. Right down to the last trumpet of the Apocalypse, to the last drop pf blood of the beast cast on the sidewalk. A masterpiece indeed, even if we may regret there is no escape, no door out of the trap for evil like in most other books and films by Stephen King. Thanks God the master is still alive.

479839,3,6302544289,Okay so it's corny and not one of the best King adaptations. But I still enjoyed this fantasy horror romp.(Although the sleepwalker creatures could have been better.) I also loved the way they used the haunting 'Boadecia' as it's theme tune by Enya. There are also some cameos by Stephen King himself as caretaker of a graveyard and Tobe ( Texas Chainsaw) Hooper as some sort of coroner.
