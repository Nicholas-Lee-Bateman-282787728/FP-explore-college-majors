2830254,5,B000Q66PWU,"I actually never saw the feature length film of Bravestarr when I was a kid so it kinda left some gaps in the story for me. How did everything start, how did Bravestarr meet Thirty/Thirty, etc. I know some of the issues were revelead in some of the episodes but I guess I must have missed those. Anyway this is an excellent movie to fill in some of the gaps especially when it comes to how did the legend begin.

If you loved the show you'll definitely going to love this movie! Also if you don't really remember the show but know you watched it as a kid this is a good place to start your walk on memory lane. You'll instantly get upto speed on everything and you woun't feel so lost when you start watching the episodes from Season One Vol. 1. As far as the best episodes I haven't even watched those since I bought the Season One Vol. 1. collection so I'm not going to go on about those. The other bonuses are definitely intersting and a nice extra!",1205712000,5,952,4.202185792349726
2830255,2,B000Q66PWU,"Filmation picked a good time to die. They're my all-time favourite tv production co, both live film serieses and cartoons. I collect any Filmation product on principle, but after forcing myself to sit through all 65 Ghostbusters cartoons, and trying a few of the Bravestarrs, I just couldn't keep watching. I'll still be buying Vol 2 to go with my Vol 1, but I don't think I'll actually watch them. It's just to keep my Filmation collection complete.
Filmation began adapting DC comics characters in the 1960s (providing great art, action packed stories and excellent music).
They continued to produce great shows of both their own and other people's characters throughout the 1970s and 1980s.
However, to my taste, the music just died around 1979.
As much as I like the He-man show (apart from every aspect of the lead character's half naked, tanned, long haired, hulking wide-nosed appearance), I got sick of that same tune all through the series. Ghostbusters, She-ra and what little I saw of Bravestarr left the same disappointment.
But that's just me.
The idea of a space futuristic super powered cowboy/indian was a novel one, and your kids (and you) will probably like it immensely.
Personally, I'm hanging out for a decision to release the rest of Filmation's Super 7. (We had Freedom Force in the Space Sentinels box set, but let's have Web Woman, Superstretch & Microwoman, Manta & Moray).
Not to mention ""The Secret Lives of Waldo Kitty.""
They were 1970s Filmation at its best

OK, so if you are a Bravestarr fan, here's what you'll want to know. Buy the Volume one series set, but you'll still need this Best of ... set for the feature film ""The Legend of Bravestarr"", which is not in the series set.",1204675200,2,1712,4.783783783783784
2830256,4,B000Q66PWU,"I remember watching Bravestarr back in the 80s and for the most part it still holds up today.  It was nice that they had the movie that I had heard about, but had never seen.  There were a lot of scenes in the movie that I remembered seeing in the series, but considering how long it takes to make a animated show, I wasn't surprised.

Overall, it was worth what I paid and how can you not want 30-30 to watch your back?",1189987200,6,420,4.036144578313253
2830257,5,B000Q66PWU,"Westerns in space. What a classic. This show is very much worth watching and owning. Although clearly 'preachy' its still entertaining.
The sci-fi element still holds up today.
The American Indian aspect is something I didn't notice as unusual as a child. Its done very well and is indeed the only serious Native American influence I can remember seeing.
Even though the entire saturday morning series is not on the DVDs, the ones shown are very good. I am especially pleased they chose 'The Price' as one of the shows as it happens to be one I remember specifically from my childhood. Its a strong episode and very cutting edge for its day.
All in all, I would say it is a must for true sci-fi animation fans.",1189814400,2,710,4.5546875
2830258,5,B000Q66PWU,"I just got the best of BraveStarr and I think it's great I do hope that all the shows will come out on DVD soon and I will get it for my neace too. And I hope that conan the Barbarin the Cartoon will come out soon too.

2830259,5,B000Q66PWU,"Wonderful DVD.  I was happy to see this finally rereleased.  Bravestarr:  The Legend(Movie) was worth the price alone but all the added bonus features made this twice as awesome.  My only complaint is why the bonus features seem better than the episodes.  Why wasn't the ""Tex But No Hex"" episode included on the dvd.  This episode brought back the basis for the storyline and also told why it was important for Tex Hex to be around. I'm sure there are other episodes that were better than those included in this set.  The Price was an episode with an important message about drugs and addiction but what happened to the episode abouty racism and the prairie people.  I would have liked to see more of Bravestarr and Shaman together since the whole native theme was one reason why this series is so significant.  Gotta give it up to the bartender(Handlebar), Bravestarr, his Irish Girlfriend(J.B.), and the whole ghost town old west theme thanks to (Tex Hex and New Texas).",1186963200,6,972,4.738095238095238
2830260,5,B000Q66PWU,"Ive been waiting for this show for a long long time. BRAVESTARR along with THUNDARR THE BARBARIAN are some of the best shows even today. I can,t wait for the whole series of both shows to come out on DVD.I hope Cartoon Network or someone bring them back, I,am waiting. :)",1186099200,2,271,4.333333333333333
2830261,4,B000Q66PWU,"For a long time after this show came out, I hated it because in so many ways it was similar to He-Man, almost to the point that this was just another attempt at the Masters of the Universe franchise.  Kind of a die hard MOTU fan, but after watching the episodes on this DVD, I've come to look at it as one of the final products from Filmation as it seemed to peak.  I can see little bits of their earlier work, from Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle, Blackstar, Flash Gordon and good ol' He-man himself rooted into this cartoon series, and it's amazing how far that company came and how much it evolved.

I'm eager to watch the movie that came with this set, Bravestarr:  The Legend.  I do remember a couple of the episodes on this set as well, and after watching them, they are among those that seemed to impact more on things.  My favorite is The Price, the episode about the drug known as Spin, with the ending that even had me drawing a quick breath.  This episode definitely hit the hardest, and it was a worthy candidate to be added to this set.",1184803200,8,1044,4.242424242424242
2830262,5,B000Q66PWU,"This show is one I used to watch as a child. I was prepared to be disappointed re watching this show today, expecting it to feel old and corny viewable only for pure nostalgia, but I was dead wrong. I must say that I love this show just as much as I did when I was little, if not more. I get almost the same feeling I get when I re watch Batman the animated series today. This show is VERY well written. Its made so that both kids and adults can enjoy the complexity of the plots (which deal with things such as fallen idols, betrayal, respect, and even (in one of the best episodes) murder). I highly recommend this to anyone who loves the idea of a western mixed with scifi stuff complete with unique looking creatures and characters. This is also possible the only cartoon ever made  that has a Native American as the main character!!! So do yourself a favor and pick this one up, if only to make sure that one day Filmation releases  an actual season boxset of this, because (and I know I may get shot for this) this show is WAY better than He-man (which I like too, but like this more).",1184716800,10,1091,4.190476190476191

8194223,4,B000Q66PWU,"Bravestarr was (I think) the last Filmation cartoon before the studio closed. As with most Filmation animation, Bravestarr brilliantly mixed action, comedy, and adventure with moral themes and lessons for its viewers. In particular, the episode highlighting the death of a child was perhaps the show's and Filmation's highlight.",1437523200,,328,5.714285714285714

8194225,4,B000Q66PWU,"Filmation had been in great stride by the time they brought about this gem.  I never saw the cartoon as a child, but I did have some of the toys.  He-Man was my first love and after having purchased all the episodes along with She-ra, Bravestarr was a natural choice to complete my collection.  WOW!  Such a good show, even seeing it first as an adult.  T.V. needs more great programming like this for today's children.  I did not give it 5 stars due to the fact that I felt obligated to buy this set after already haven gotten the complete series.  I bought this anyway in order to have the ""Legend Begins"" movie that was not included in the 'complete' set.  Not a big deal, since it is fairly priced and I have the other Best Of sets for the above shows as well.  It completes your collection and the Best Of dvds are a great way to expose others to the show.  Perhaps your own children.  Enjoy!",1380931200,,897,4.2485207100591715
8194226,5,B000Q66PWU,"I am happy with this special editon of Brave Star, Because it has a beutiful presentation, with its two disc, one with the movie about the beginning of brave star and the second disc with the 5 best chapters. Could be the better with more chapters but, what we can do? jajaja. By the way I recomended.",1359504000,,301,4.298245614035087
8194227,5,B000Q66PWU,"This DVD set is a must-have for any Bravestarr fan or anyone who just likes classic cartoons. Bravestarr was often overlooked in favor of other 80s cartoons such as He-Man or Thundercats, but it's still a great cartoon that shouldn't be missed. The quality of writing, animation and voice acting is among the best the 80s has to offer. You don't see cartoons like this anymore and would be great to share with the kids so they can see what cartoons were like back in the 80s.

This ""best of"" set itself is very nicely done. There's lots of good artwork on/in the packaging (which is nice to see if you're a fan of Bravestarr) and it comes with plenty of extras like an image gallery with rare art, commentary for the movie, and scripts for the episodes and movie. And the 5 episodes included are considered to be the best in the series. Personally I only felt that 4 out of the 5 are the best episodes. I think the episode ""Tex But No Hex"" should have been included instead of ""To Walk A Mile"". But it's still one of the best DVDs sets I've ever gotten in terms of quality and content.",1334361600,,1085,4.318627450980392
8194228,5,B000Q66PWU,"I remember being a Bravestarr fan when I was a kid. Now as much as I wanted to see it again, after twenty-plus years, I was prepared to enjoy it exclusively out of pure nostalgia. But as I sat there watching the movie something happened: I realized this was actually good. Not only that but it also managed to do three things He-Man, my childhood hero, never could:

1. First thing I noticed was the animation. It's incredibly more fluent than Masters of the Universe (Filmation's most famous show) while still preserving that Filmation style and look. Maybe it's because of this that the episodes are easier to watch now that I'm an adult. Try as I might, the only reason I sit through a He-Man episode is because of pure nostalgia only. There's only so many times you can see the same animation over and over.

2. Bravestarr actually hits the bad guys. We get to see ""real"" fight scenes between the characters. While He-Man only punches the screen and tosses the bad guys around, Bravestarr hits, kicks and shoots!!! the enemy. Yes, Bravestarr uses his gun on the bad guys, unlike He-Man who only uses his sword to transform.

3. Bravestarr gets the girl. The only time we ever see He-Man even a hug a girl was when he reunited with his long lost sister. And it only took him 120 episodes to do that. It takes Bravestarr only half way through the movie to KISS, not just hug, KISS the main love interest.

Now He-Man will always be my favorite, as it made more of an impact on me while I was groing up. But Bravestarr has got to be the best show on the Filmation library. Give it a chance. You won't be dissapointed.",1298419200,11,1618,4.419463087248322
8194229,5,B000Q66PWU,"I was really blown away at the packaging this set came in.  Reinforced with firm materials and the artwork is really nice.  You really feel you have a nice product.  The tv series itself was one of my favorites when I was young, and I am proud to get this.",1283558400,2,256,4.08
8194230,5,B000Q66PWU,"If you have never seen Bravestarr before and are interested in the show, this would be what you want, because it comes with the opening movie that was the start of the show, (if you read my review of the movie this is the exact same thing, you do not need to buy the movie twice) and several of the more dramatic and exceptionally deep episodes of the series.  Given the time that this show was created the animation quality is amazing and the story is fun, easy to walk into, and has a moral quality (a lesson) to each show.
If nothing else the special features give an in-depth look at the creation and evolution of the show up till it's end and are definatly worth watching.  Overall, I would recoment this show to anyone, then again I was a huge fan as a kid.",1217894400,,763,4.219178082191781
