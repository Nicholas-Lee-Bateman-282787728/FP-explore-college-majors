8200258,5,B000RF28QM,I have been waiting for this to make it to DVD. The added bonus footage was somewhat good fight seen alternates. I heard the story about how this film came together but never thought i would not want a copy. This was a movie I saw as a child living in a small town and a kid with a heart for Martial Arts. This played as a major influence my Black Belt career. Well worth your time and money if your a Jackie Chan Fan. No regrets on this pricey purchase.,1389312000,,454,4.0
