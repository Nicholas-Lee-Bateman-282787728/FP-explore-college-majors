8020346,5,B000228E04,"The story is pretty simple. It's the story of an aspiring rapper over the span of a single weekend. Showing his relationship with his parents, who are hiding a secrert from their son and his 10 year old brother, and his friends, who each have a story to go along with them. He is also having to decide whether or not to perform at a gay bar for $2500. My favorite character was Rami, played by Omar Scroggins. His character was hilarious, but his scenes with his mother stole thew show. Baby, played by Jaclyn DeSantis was a great character as well. The fact that she's hot helps, too. Overall, the music was alright, espacially ""The End of The Beginning"" during the credits. The story is great, and the chemistry between the actors is what brings it together. Lastly, there is a scene between GQ and Omar Scroggins when they left a party to smoke, and as Scroggin's character continuously clicked on the lighter, the scene transitions in a way that might have been used before, but i have never seen. I never get tired of watching this. 5 Star Movie.",1085616000,2,1051,4.507853403141361
