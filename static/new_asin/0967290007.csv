7793957,1,0967290007,"There are only 3 exercises in the whole dvd and it is not tai chi but basic static qi gong,even the movements are badly executed,no root,no grace,are they really teachers?
It is a real waste of money. Buy any other tai chi dvd but not this one...",1320624000,,246,4.25531914893617

7793959,5,0967290007,"Tantra Tai Chi leads to a heartfelt exchange of energy between partners and naturally channels sexual energy upward, via the heart, to the higher centers. One of its goals is to encourage the discipline that helps lovers circulate energy during lovemaking...rather than simply rushing toward climax. This tape is highly recommended for those using the system of lovemaking recommended in ""Peace Between the Sheets.""",1101686400,5,415,5.5
7793960,5,0967290007,"This video was great! It was probably the funniest video I have ever seen. Even though I have been studying Tai Chi for the last 25 years and know that these people in the video know NOTHING about Tai Chi, this video is a must have if you want a copy of the most corny,funny,stuff ever documented on vhs.",1019260800,15,304,4.169491525423729
7793961,4,0967290007,"We were looking for something to do that was not ""sex"" but somehow connected to sex. Tantra Tai Chi gave us a way to back off from the pressures of sex while still keeping the possibilities open. This video helped us. We've gotten back on track with each other.",996537600,4,261,4.346938775510204
7793962,5,0967290007,"When I tried Tai Chi in the past, it was a solitary, inner-oriented practice.  To do it with my wife changes that - but in a good way! There is still the inner, meditative orientation, and then we make a loving heart  connection with each other.  It brings us closer together, in a happy state  of mind (and body!)  The focus on sexual energy is the key thing.  If you  want to share a spiritual sense of yourself with your spouse, get this  video and start moving energy together!",958435200,8,481,4.325842696629214
7793963,5,0967290007,"Tantra tai chi is a perfect ritual for showing devotion to the living God in each one of us. It binds us together. It soothes the soul. It tends a bridge between seemingly opposite worlds. We attended a wonderful workshop  with the Daffners.  Maybe the biggest lesson of all was their encouragement  to constantly keep our eye contact. It is a reminder to stay here, in  present time, with your beloved. It's safe to stay. Tantra tai chi and the  workshop have changed the way we relate to each other. We have rediscovered  the sacred realm that once reigned in our bedroom. Pleasure and more  pleasure is the ongoing reward. When you are slowly guided by your feminine  self, there is no goal, but to be there, in joy.",955238400,6,719,4.51937984496124
