1741623,5,B00006CXH1,"'Spring Forward', currently making the rounds in selected art theaters across the country is for the most part a two- man play filmed over the course of one year, outdoors, in lovely Ridgefield, Connecticut. It stars the wonderful actor Ned Beatty and usually type-casted bad guy Liev Schreiber as city park workers. Beatty is near retirement and Schreiber is his eventual replacement. Over that one year period we watch these two guys begin to open up to each other and eventually become best friends. Schreiber gains the most from this friendship learning to take things in stride from the older and wiser Beatty. However, Beatty gains from the friendship also and gets a second chance to be the father figure he always wanted to be. If an action film is what you are looking for, 'Spring Forward' is not for you. But, if you'd like to see a well made character study film, rare in this day and age, I would strongly recommend this movie. It is the kind of film that will touch you and then won't allow you to let go.",1005609600,9,1019,4.573770491803279
1741624,4,B00006CXH1,"Spring Forward didn't get a very wide theatrical release, which is really a shame because it's a very nice film. Spring Forward is a sweet, simple film about two small-town Connecticut park employees, played by Ned Beatty and Liev Schreiber. Schreiber's character is young and brash, while Beatty is older and exhausted. Together, they help each other cope through the year of seasons.",1005004800,,385,5.126984126984127

1741637,5,B00006CXH1,"Slow film allowing a careful dissection of engaging characters. Dialogue is realistic and good, but lines are given in a stilted way as though it were a modern play or adapted from a play. A few might find this artificial or pretentious. But I say just shift into the right gear for the terrain, if you are an ""experienced driver"" so to speak. I think they pull it off for the right audience.

Mostly a glimpse into a couple of guys dealing with being men and manhood in their particular situations. Ranges from the younger guy trying to make it without much education and confused about social protocols but with good instincts in an underdog situation. The older guy has internalized a great deal of his feelings in order to cope with being an underdog and some family problems (including how to make sure a gay son understands that he really loves him even if he has trouble expressing his feelings, and also did not stand up strongly enough for his son at one point. So he lives with a lot of regrets but just tries to get on. In some ways he is an important mentor to the younger guy, but they understand each other in different ways -- which is one of the more interesting aspects of the film. And yet they understand each other at some important level and do bond nevertheless in some sort of manly way. This is not overplayed in my opinion, and yet somehow it has a punch if you are paying attention and manage to get on their wavelength(s).

There is a lot going on in the ""philosophy"" of manly coping and personal ""enlightenment"" with and in a world that is not easy for them. I sense layers and will watch it again sometime. Maybe not deep conceptually in academic terms, but useful in fleshing the characters out and in exploring the empathetic possibilities in the film.

I think the film works at several levels, and one can take it at the surface if one is in that mood. Or one can use it to meditate on life, manhood, coping psychology, male relationships, male mentoring, etc. if that clicks for the individual at the time.",1430352000,,2040,4.463806970509383

There is something small and quiet about it yet degree of intimacy you come to feel with these two characters is unmatched in American cinema.

1741663,5,B00006CXH1,"Love this film. Am buying it after seeing it twice. Both Liev Schreiber and Ned Beatty do a wonderful job of crafting everyday characters who are not in any way typical or routine. Like the film, The Village Barbershop, this film touches on how life is difficulty, but decency prevails. Well, writing that sounds stupid, but I swear it's true. Do yourself a favor and watch this film. You may miss violence, overt sexuality, anger and craziness that you usually see in a film, but when you settle down, you'll get some real-life truth here that doesn't sound like an Aesop's fable.",1340496000,2,581,4.705882352941177
1741664,5,B00006CXH1,"If you're looking for a philosphical, metaphysical movie, Spring Foward is THE movie for you. Though there's not much in the way of action - there is a tense scene towards the end - the flow of dialogue and acting keeps the movie going.

The movie is made up a series of conversation, broken up with two quick scenes of people going about their daily business and The Horse Whisperer-esque music each time. Yes, there is a plot of sorts: an ex-convict named Paul tries to get back on his feet and the entire movie focuses on how he does.

Though it's not for everyone, it's overall a sweet, interesting, different kind of movie. Very relaxing. Touching. Beautiful scenery. Masterful acting.",1245024000,,690,4.694214876033058
1741665,2,B00006CXH1,"Based on the description and reviews, I expected to like this movie a lot. My very favorite kind of movie is one in which not much happens except character development, and it sounded like that's exactly what Spring Forward was. In a way that's true, but the characters need to be believable, and these aren't.

What makes them unbelievable, and ultimately even annoying, is the way they talk. It's not just that they talk too much--people do that all the time. It's always tiring, in a movie or in real life, but endless talking isn't in itself unrealistic. The problem here is that every word Beatty and Schreiber say sounds mechanical, choreographed, uniform both in tone and in pace, like an elaborate mantra instead of spontaneous human speech, as if there's a metronome we can't hear setting the unvarying pace of everything they say, and an automatic volume control keeping them from ever raising or lowering their voices outside an artificially narrow range. It makes for an artificial, emotionally flat, and (for me) unpleasant experience. It's exactly what I'd expect of a movie made completely under hypnosis.

Normally I feel obligated to watch a movie all the way to the end before writing about it, afraid that I'll criticize it unfairly because I missed something at the end that transcends the beginning. That has almost happened a few times, and I still feel that obligation, but I think I'm going to ignore it this time. After all, movies are entertainment. If a movie doesn't make me want to keep watching it, the movie has failed, not me. I stuck with this one through Peri Gilpin's cameo, which indeed is very good, but she is just as much under the spell of the unseen hypnotist as the leads are, and that's what I can't stand. It makes the whole movie feel flat and unreal, even creepy.

I assume it's the director's responsibility to set the pace of a movie, which in this case is just too measured, too tight, too unrelentingly uniform. I know all these actors are very gifted performers because I've enjoyed and admired them for years. And WHAT they say isn't so bad, so it's not primarily a problem with the screenplay (although it IS somewhat pretentious, but no more than I am). So I attribute the surprising failure of Spring Forward to the director, who should have let these characters talk a little less and just BE a little more. Flashes of real anger, stupidity or selfishness would have been nice, a little wildness, something messy, an occasional lapse of self-control, even periods of awkward or comfortable silence. In other words, something human.

I'm sorry, but I have to join the tiny minority at the bottom of the ratings chart.",1243555200,4,2672,4.764578833693305
1741666,5,B00006CXH1,"This is a wonderful ""small"" movie of a genre that is getting increasingly more difficult to find.  No chase scenes, no special effects, no sex or violence;  just a lovely story told straightforwardly.  I agree with the praise given to both Ned Beatty and Liev Schreiber by other reviewers, but I also highly recommend the performance of Peri Gilpin, best known for her long-standing comedic role on the television series ""Frasier"".  On screen for no more than 5 minutes, her performance as a single woman looking for a romantic connection is so finely-tuned that it was a joy to watch.",1242432000,,585,4.82
1741677,5,B00006CXH1,"I bought this as the $2.99 rental thing on amazon and within 10 minutes of watching it on my computer, I knew I would be back to buy the dvd (which I'm doing right now).  Liev Schreiber has such magnetism... he gives his character a totally realistic and mix of vulnerability and machoism without being obvious about it.  I can't stop watching this movie -- I've played it 3 times already.  I see something new every time I watch a scene over again.  I kind of never knew I could enjoy an actor this much.  I don't mean to go on and on about Liev and not say anything about Ned... I thought Ned was really great, but Liev is nothing short of spellbinding.  I instantly want to see every damn thing he's ever done and it's killing me that I'm not in NYC and don't go to the theater and that Talk Radio isn't available on DVD.

Anyway... this movie is understated and subtle and perfect.  It's one of those stories where you wish it kept going on and on because you don't want to stop hanging out with the characters.  Where you're so happy to have seen it but it's bittersweet because the characters aren't people in your life you can just call up and hang out with.  You just grow to like them and care for them.  And if that's the mark of a really good movie, well, there you go.",1242086400,2,1280,4.204918032786885

Bless Liev Schreiber and Net Beatty.  Bless 'em.",1235433600,2,321,4.4655172413793105
1741679,5,B00006CXH1,"This movie is such a gem!

I love the relationship and interactions between the two main characters. Ned and Liev do such an outstanding job in their performances. There is no over- or under-acting here. The story is warm and intelligent without being preachy or sentimental. I want to hang out with these guys!

Between the 'chapters' of the movie which are presented seasonally, there are snippets of small-town scenes with music and no dialogue. This small detail helps immerse you into this rural world. These are your every-day people, just like you and me.

I realize a couple of reviewers here had an issue with the pace of the movie. If you have seen ""Heavy"" or ""Monster's Ball"" or ""Ulee's Gold"" - those movies all share a similar, even, methodical pace like ""Spring Forward"". The pace is 'real' and perfect for the story. It is the pace of an average American life in a small town.",1229904000,,890,4.656050955414012

Quite an achievement for a first time director.  It amazes me how the dialog, which is at times, so everyday, is so absorbing and captivating in the film. Beatty and Schreiber were perfectly cast, and an utter joy to watch.  A real worthwhile way to spend your time.  Many, many stars for this diamond in the rough.",1228694400,,454,4.5
1741681,5,B00006CXH1,"A simply told yet provocative story about the gift of friendship, ""Spring Forward"" is an exquisitely handled character piece fueled by a perceptive script and the considerable skill of the two leads. Shooting in sequence over the course of a year, director Gilroy follows the nuances and little epiphanies of this unlikely friendship through four seasons with nary a misstep, giving us the sense we're watching it all unfold in real time.

Reviewer: David S. Jobrack ""Seeker"" (New York City) - See all my reviews

(REAL NAME)

For those who enjoy films about close relationships between friends, this film is a real sleeper and a true find. The focus is on a job relatonship between a young man who is just begining and an older man who is almost ready to retire. The acting is outstanding, the dialogue real and moving, and the overall impact is both sweet and melancholy at the same time. Definitely not for the action or romance movie types, it is a perfect fit for those who look for something deeper in a film.",1168300800,,608,4.45945945945946
1741683,5,B00006CXH1,"If you've ever studied Zen Buddhism, the parallels in this film are STAGGERING.  Paul (played by Leiv Schreiber) is a very troubled figure in the start of the film. There is a moment early in the film, when Paul feels he has jeopardized his employment, his final chance at redemption in life; he runs into the woods in tears, hopelessly, furious at himself. This reminded me of the hopelessness that is experienced during the Great Doubt, the state a monk experiences when his concept of self and reality begin to unravel during the journey to enlightenment. In order to gain control of his life, Paul has turned to spiritual books, specifically that of the Dalai Lama (""the Pope of Buddhism""). Paul is the epitome of the novice Zen disciple; he has familiarity with many spiritual concepts but only at face value, lacking the understanding of their true meaning. He is dependent on scripture and is in need of an experienced master.  Murph (Ned Beatty), by contrast, is easygoing and friendly. He enjoys his work, much in the way that Zen monks engage in samu. He is a Hakuin-like character, appreciating the beauty in the simple things of life. Murph is the Zen master that Paul needs to make his necessary transition into a content life.

Seriously, check out this movie.  Then, read up on Zen Buddhism and watch it again.",1165622400,,1325,4.747826086956522
1741684,5,B00006CXH1,"I absolutely loved this film and applaud the mind who created it as well as the crew who brought it to life. It touched my heart on many levels making me laugh and cry repeatedly. It was personally important to me to be reminded of the value in male relationships and that men need the bonding of male friendships as much as women need their girlfriends. I found it to be stunning in its simplicity with a message that was clear and pure. Thank you for this experience.

1741685,5,B00006CXH1,"Spring Forward is a wonderful inquiry in the nature of life, where two Parks and Forests employees, and older experienced man and a younger man fresh out of jail, exchange their perspectives while going through a fall and a winter. This is a very thoughtful movie which will appeal to people who prefer great dialogue to action. I have to say that the time passed faster here than when watching many other movies, even though not much actually happens. Most scenes are full of sensibility and intelligence, although some are more hit-and-miss. But the basic theme of the movie - that sometimes we are consumed by looking for things that we already have - is really deployed to the fullest. We truly make our lives complicated when there is really no need for it. Five stars.",1121990400,9,774,4.698529411764706

No bells and whistles... sometimes you're almost confused because you expect this big dramatic scene... but it is just so cool.  The actors are great and relate to each other so well... you see their lives ""happen"" through the seasons... just normal everyday life, but somehow it's more.

1741699,5,B00006CXH1,"Can a movie with no plot or action to speak of be any good?  Well, the answer is yes and no and it all depends on who's asking.  Most of the people I know would have no patience to sit through Spring Forward probably because it's a slow moving character study and involves no action.  No guns, car chases, or explosions, just wonderfully written dialogue and strong fleshed-out characters.  These days those qualities seem to be in such short supply and that's one of the reasons I loved every minute of this film.

The movie follows two Parks Department workers around on their daily errands.  Harold(Ned Beatty)is the veteran who is on the verge of retirement and Paul(Liev Schreiber)is the new guy who just got out of jail for armed robbery.  I knew what to expect from Beatty but was greatly surprised by Schreiber's performance--he was brilliant throughout.  I never even heard of him before this movie.

The movie moves at its own pace, which is rather slow, but once I got into it the time went by rather quickly.  The only conflict in the movie stems from Paul and his inclination toward self-desctruction.  Paul's hit on some bad times and things haven't been looking up, but he seems like a decent guy who's trying to improve himself.  Harold sees that and trys to give him some guidance without being overbearing.  In return, Paul helps Harold deal with some guilt he feels towards his seriously ill son.  The relationship that develops between the two men is truly special and handled with any hint of sentimentality.

I saw Spring Forward on a recommendation from a friend at work and couldn't thank him enough after I had watched it.  I watch a lot of movies but there always seem to be some great ones that I haven't seen and love the feeling of discovering them for the first time.  This is definitely one of them.",1097884800,18,1830,4.61609907120743
1741700,5,B00006CXH1,"O.K. I've read the mixed reviews of this movie and have reached my own conclusion.  This is the kind of movie that you need to be in a particular mood and mindset to watch.  You will appreciate it a lot more if you find yourself in a relaxed, pensive, philosophical type of mood.  The acting is top-notch, even Oscar worthy, but the story which is told in short segments like chapters is rather slow which may bore some viewers who are used to fast-paced action movies.  I gave it 5 stars for the acting alone.  Give it a try...you may like it.",1085702400,8,544,4.294117647058823
1741701,5,B00006CXH1,"A low  budget movie, that has only two people talking throughout?
No special effects, no action scenes--just the lives of two ordinary, yet extraordinary men. At times the movie seems to be like the dialogues of Socrates without the pedantry Socrates had for constants; at other times, like rich character studies; and other times, like a rich portrait of Maine. But no matter how different the four parts (four seasons) of the movie are, the parts seem to add up to something beyond the whole. Plot lines, themes, topics are put down and then continued in ways that bring the movie together.
And the themes, and dramas of the characters--there is something wonderfully prosiac to all of them. By the end of the film, you don't just know the two characters, they become like friends. And you're generally sorry to have to see them go.

Frankly, it could've been a little longer.  I would like to have learned more about Murphy's drinking problem and Paul's earlier years.

Can't add anything to what others already said, so I'll go off on a slight tangent.  For an obviously low-budget movie, ""Spring Forward"" has gorgeous production values.  Great lighting, great camerawork, excellent editing, beautiful score.  But what struck me most, listening to the DVD late at night under headphones so as to not disturb my family, was the sound.
The outdoor scenes, of which there are many, are phenomenally recorded.  There is a 3-D depth and presence to the soundscapes that you rarely hear even in the majors.  Do yourself a favor and experience the movie on headphones.",1034208000,11,759,5.130081300813008
1741705,5,B00006CXH1,"SPRING FORWARD has been released on DVD and hopefully will be featured in displays that will garner the atttention this superb film deserves but lacked during its theatrical release.  This is a quietly powerful film, made all the more so because it is created in such a simple, straight forward, coverstational style. This is one of the finest scripts for a film in many years. And Director Tom Gilroy allows the concepts and messages it contains to speak clearly and in an unfettered fashion that drives the points of the story home in the most sincerely beautiful say imaginable.
Ned Beatty adds yet another crown to his acting career as the aging, Parks and Recreation worker who gives employment to a newly relased from prison lost youth (Liev Schreiber) and in doing so changes the misguided young man into to a solidly complete human being.  Beatty owns this role - the father of a gay son in a small town who has been the victim of homophobia and now is dying of AIDS, while the father mourns the fact he has never been able to  relate how deeply he loves this son.  These life lessons pour into Paul (Liev Schreiber) who is hungry for acceptance and a sense of future in a world he sees as shallow and offensive.  The manner in which these two men slowly develop a relationship that nurtures each other's needs is marked by encounters with small town people who are perceptively defined by superior cameo actors such as Peri Gilpin, Campbell Scott and others whos names fly by too quickly in the final screen credits.  The four seasons in this unidentified New England town have rarely been so beautifully captures both in scenery and in the adaptive lifestyles each season commands.  But some of the rarest moments are just the quiet, humor-laced, emotionally sensitive simple conversations tha grow between the two main character men.  For example, in a discussion about reading, Beatty asks Schreiber about poetry and Scbrieber alludes to the fact that Native Americans use the same word for ""breathing"" as they do for ""poetry"", that the importance of making poems is the importance of living each day.
Oh, this film is rich in simple philosophy, in the glow of real friendship, in the interplay of each of us as caring, involved-in-living individuals on this communal planet. This is a quietly brilliant achievement, a film you'll want to own.",1033430400,21,2355,4.7975308641975305
1741706,5,B00006CXH1,"This film took me completely by surprise when I saw it during its brief theatrical release a couple of years ago. Let's face it, how interesting could a movie be considering that it focuses almost entirely on the relationship between two park maintenance workers over the course of a full year, from Spring forward? Well, put your apprehension to rest and take advantage of this long-overdue dvd release, you will enjoy a rewarding and memorable movie experience.
Spring Forward features Ned Beatty as a weary but wise maintenance worker showing the ropes to brash, sullen youngster Liev Schreiber. Liev's character has been in trouble with the law and shows no signs of mending his ways during the initial season of their year together, but as the months drag on he is influenced by his co-worker's gentle demeanor and begins to evolve into a better person. I know, still doesn't sound all that interesting but somehow it really works to perfection.
The film follows a simple framework of checking in with the characters once each season and gives them the room and time to just interact with each other, unfolding at a leisurely but never boring pace. Their relationship and roles evolve throughout the year, from teacher/student to hesitant friends to father/son to brothers. The characters are so well-developed that I could have watched them together for many more hours, it's one of those rare movies that you just hate to see come to an end.",1031875200,9,1448,4.914285714285715
1741707,5,B00006CXH1,"In the past two years of, for the most part, mediocre and tiresome movies replaying the same storyline of explosions backed by power ballads sung by aging rock stars, it was a pleasure to see two great performers, the under-recognized genius Ned Beatty and the intensely compelling Liev Schriever, in a story that was fresh, funny and endearing.  The chemestry, the performances and the dialogue are unmatched in recent years.  Simply put, I loved this beautiful movie.  I remember sitting in my seat for a good five minutes or so after the credits finished rolling, heaving a sigh and wiping tears from my eyes knowing that, for most movie-lovers, there are a handful of movies that really reach the audience in a real, emotional, human way.  There are a hundred, two hundred, three hundred movies that the true faithful will go to in order to experience that feeling again.  This was the movie I was looking for.....BUT, where is it???  It was in theaters (far too few) over a year ago, and now, no rerelease, no DVD, no VHS, no rentals...What gives?  I would hate to see this movie lost to the the audience it could reach.  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE MAKE THIS MOVIE AVAILABLE.",1010707200,12,1174,4.720588235294118

7967088,5,B00006CXH1,"movies about second chances or redemption are dear to my heart, --live Schreiber and ned beatty are excellent in this nervously beginning streaming nature therapy. the music is amazing as the pastoral scenes set a tone for a time of rare moments in a busy world-a unique view within the relationship of a troubled ex felon and murphy, a recreation and parks maintenance man.  their conversations are wonderful and touch on common themes.  I will watch this film when I want to feel good and at least once a year until I am dead",1497312000,,527,4.595744680851064

7967090,5,B00006CXH1,"Saw this film in 2000 at the Cleveland International Film Festival. It is one of the best films I have ever seen. It sounds ridiculous, an older man and a young man, working in the street department of a small town. But the story is so much more than that. They talk about how to live a life of meaning and value.

Watch this one with your kids.",1465516800,,345,4.073529411764706

7967092,5,B00006CXH1,"I really enjoyed this movie.  It was all about relationships, so the subtle nuisances between characters was very important.  But I am a character person.  Wonder why I never heard about it before.  Both Ned Beatty and Liev Schreiber were fantastic. I am going to watch it again.  It's the kind of movie you can see different subtleties the more you watch it.

Not sure about the director's decision to cut at the end of sections.  Felt a little choppy.",1459209600,,453,4.5875

Although the script might have been a bit unsubtle sometimes, and the flashbacks could be a bit awkward sometimes, overall this was a very pleasant surprise.  It was a quiet pleasure.",1437955200,,335,4.741379310344827
