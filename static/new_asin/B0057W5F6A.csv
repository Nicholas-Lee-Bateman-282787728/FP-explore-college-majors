8461170,4,B0057W5F6A,"A young punk (Tony Curtis) from the Chicago slums gets a job as a busboy at a posh country club resort. But he's ambitious and he passes himself off as a guest at the country club and romances a well bred heiress (Martha Hyer) while gambling on the side to fund his deceit. This is an enjoyable, well made potboiler elevated by Blake Edwards' stylish direction and Russell Metty's elegant CinemaScope lensing with Lake Tahoe and Lake Arrowhead subbing for Illinois. There's nothing particularly out of the ordinary to make it stand out but curiously it's a favorite of Jean Luc Godard. The young Curtis effortlessly brings some cocky panache to the unlikable hero but it's William Reynolds (ALL THAT HEAVEN ALLOWS) as Hyer's weak, rich playboy fiance that steals the acting honors. The uncredited score is by Henry Mancini. With Charles Bickford, Kathryn Grant (adorable as Hyer's brash kid sister), Henry Daniell and Willis Bouchey.

The Track Media DVD from Spain is an anamorphic wide screen (2.35) transfer. It's an adequate transfer that's rather soft looking in places and could use a bit of remastering.",1317513600,,1110,4.967741935483871
