However, aside from focusing only in the final series, thumbs down for not being able to provide the soundtrack, meaning the tracks used and respective composers. The music, although easily identifiable as late 70's library themes gives an extra edge, tu put it this way, to the production.",1486598400,,355,5.245614035087719

7808825,1,6301006887,I bought this VHS for $19.99 back in the late 80's when it came out at Tower Video. I still own it but I'm about to let it go because the dvd version is in the Lakers Dynasty box that I bought last year. Why anyone would want to gouge this vhs price at $100 or above just shows me how stupid and greedy people are out there. The 1 rating goes out to these idiots. Buy the Dynasty box - NOT the vhs from some moron amazon gouger.,1213660800,,428,3.8202247191011236
