8284041,4,B000E41MU4,"I remember both of these pics from when they came out (in fact to this day I have a signed poster of The Loveless hanging in my living room; producer Monty Montgomery was a friend of a friend and he and Willem Dafoe signed it for me). The Loveless is cool more for the fact that it's got a young Willem Dafoe, Robert Gordon and motorcycles; it's got a laconic pace, I have to be in the mood to watch it. Smithereens is fun to watch, especially if you lived during that time/scene. It's so dang authentic and really holds up over time, as much as Penelope Speeris's ""Suburbia,"" which was filmed with real people, not actors. Richard Hell is a riot and it was nice to see him (and the lead actress) in a special feature that was shot in recent years.",1246924800,,748,4.2377622377622375
