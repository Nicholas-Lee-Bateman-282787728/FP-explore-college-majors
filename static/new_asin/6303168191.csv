589020,5,6303168191,"If you have seen the first movie, you must see this one! While the second movie doesn't have as many twists and turns as the first, it is quite enjoyable. Jaclyn Smith and Ken Howard's chemistry really comes out as they reunite as star-crossed lovers yet again. I think it was a clever way to right the continuing story, and while it may not be the caliber of the first movie story-wise, I almost enjoyed it a little more. If you are a Jaclyn Smith fan, you will love watching her reprise the role of Jennifer Parker!",1240272000,3,517,4.34020618556701
589021,3,6303168191,"I have a recollection of watching both miniseries ""Rage of Angels"" and its conclusion tale ""Rage of Angels: The Story Continues"" when they originally on NBC and really enjoying them. However, after recently buying both miniseries on Amazon & rewatching them, I was stuck by how flat the sequel is compared to the original miniseries. The movie once again has a strong cast & pretty well-developed characters, but the plotlines are choppy & somewhat lame and the main characters are not nearly as sympathetic this go around. ""Rage of Angels"" was really the peak. The continuing story is much more of a plateau.",1221004800,,609,4.922330097087379
589022,4,6303168191,"The speed of getting the movie to me was really fast.  The story was great, the picture itself was a little jumpy but it was all right, a new one would have been nice but one can't have everything in this world.  If it ever comes out again I would like it very much.  Thank You",1127260800,5,277,3.9107142857142856

7840181,3,6303168191,"I was very disappointed with the ending. I expected more, it did not seem realistic. Jaclyn Smith and Ken Howard continue to be great together. Angela Lansbury did a fine job. I liked the actress who played the senator's wife in Part 1 of rage; she was more subtle. I didn't like the Michael Nouri character, but he did a fine job portraying it.",1401148800,,345,4.40625

7840185,5,6303168191,"Rage of Angels was well acted and a good film. Of course, the cast was made up of veteran actors, so you can't go wrong there. The tape came in good condition even though it was used.",1310428800,2,183,3.972972972972973
