8267022,3,B0017RQBYO,"This 2005 release post dates the two RING motion pictures, however, it features a short film that is actually a prequel to the first RING picture. This short is called RINGS, and it is also found in THE RING TWO special features section of that DVD. This snappy 15 minute short portrays a group of youths in a High School setting who are experimenting with the cursed video tape. RINGS is loaded with lots of creepy RING atmosphere, and is an awesome stand alone short film. At 15 minutes long however, it would be of limited interest to many especially if you have not seen any of the full length feature RING films. RINGS features 4 special features of which the short film is one of them. Nice to have is feature 2 that shows the cursed videotapes. Two other special features detail the origins of Urban Myths and there are also interviews with the stars and filmmakers. Of primary interest here is the short-though its 5 Star thunder is stolen as it is old news to RING fans. You may want this mainly for feature 2, the cursed tapes. There is actually not a lot on this DVD & it rather reminds me of a weird promotional item that the big labels used to give away to the review community to pump their latest projects. Unessential viewing, though a nice addition to your RING DVD library if you are an avid collector. For readers of my reviews I highly recommend both RING films and even the Japanese box set for those who wish to delve further into this genuinely sinister cinema collection.",1298937600,2,1495,4.47985347985348
