7901170,4,8474008484,"""All Day Singin"" at the Dome"" was filmed at the spectacular Georgia Dome in Atlanta. The concert started strong with the Homecoming Friends singing robust arrangements of ""On Jordan's Stormy Banks"" and ""I Am Bound for the Promised Land"" to an appreciated, energetic, enthusiastic audience of thousands. This was followed by a solid rendition of ""I've Got That Old Time Religion in My Heart"" featuring Anthony Burger in a piano solo.

The concert featured favorite groups and artists who are or have been residents in Georgia or have been impacted by their music.  I always enjoy the Gaither Vocal Band numbers. In this concert they were featured singing: ""Satisfied"" and ""I Believe in a Hill Called Mount Calvary."" Other favorites of mine are: Ivan Park, Jake Hess, John Starnes, and a reading done by J. D. Sumner.

Worship, Inspiration, and Entertainment - All in all a wonderful concert.",1305763200,,890,5.0
7901171,5,8474008484,"The Gaithers and their Homecoming Friends gather in Atlanta for ""All Day Singin' at the Dome"" another in the Gaither Gospel Series. The Gaither Vocal Band,  The Homecoming friends, with Anthony Burger at the piano keep the momentum on ""fast forward"" as Ivan Parker, the Martins, the Happy Goodman's, and the entire cast lead in worship, entertain, and inspire through song, testimony, and comedy.

After a special tribute, detailing his fifty years in gospel music, Jake Hess sang a medley of songs that have come to be identified with him throughout his career: ""Faith Unlocks the Door,"" ""God Takes Good Care of Me,"" Climbing Higher And Higher,"" and ""Then I Met the Master.""

I enjoyed the arrangement of ""My God is Real"" sung by John Starnes and ""The Haven of Rest: featuring J. D. Sumner, and Guy Penrod.

A powerful rendition of ""I Believe in a Hill Called Mt. Calvary"" featuring the Gaither Vocal Band capped the program for me. Another awesome worship experience.",1297123200,,969,4.890243902439025
