The most interesting part of encountering an artist like this is that he displays not only the most outrageous, confrontational, in your face art, but he also is clearly very intelligent and enjoys challenging people. I'd suggest you allow yourself the opportunity to be challenged, welcome it, and then ponder whether what he is actually doing, saying, creating and how this can change you, me, the world.",1357516800,,466,4.8375
