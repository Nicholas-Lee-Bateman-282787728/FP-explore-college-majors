8268709,5,B00187MZIY,"I'm having such a hard time finding information about this film anywhere online - not even a trailer on YouTube. Maybe my search skills are poor or maybe this film is just an undiscovered gem. I'm not even sure how it ended up on my Netflix list.

I can't say enough about how this film impressed me. A previous commentator suggested it's like Beautiful Girls for the next generation, but I think it's so much more than that. In my eyes, it's more along the lines of American Graffiti. I didn't see this so much as a reunion film as much as a film making a statement about the post 9/11 U.S. Of course the main character returns home, but that's a vehicle to tell the tale of a divided country being run by a monkey and innocence lost. Poetic vignettes are so wonderfully stitched together to paint a picture that at times romanticizes the Midwest, but also condemns it. The film also portrays the everyday poetry of friends gathering together without becoming too sentimental. There's no real plot to speak of. Instead the film seems to cross that line between capturing everyday life documentary style as well as sending a message.

Despite what is obviously an independent low budget film, it has high production value, something I think allowed by the naturalistic use of setting and acting.

I want to get the word out because it's one of the best films I've seen in a long, long time.",1335657600,,1390,4.57429718875502
8268710,5,B00187MZIY,"I can't even remember how I ended up with this movie, but popped it in one rainy afternoon and loved it. This movie is like a more modern, edgy version of Beautiful Girls. A group of high school friends reunite after journeying to other places in their lives (one even a struggling musician-sound familiar?) and gather to rediscover themselves as adults.",1320796800,,354,4.819672131147541
8268711,5,B00187MZIY,"I love indy films, and this one is a great story of a young man finding himself by returning to his roots.  There is a lot of good humor and extra features in this movie.",1235088000,,170,3.857142857142857
8268712,5,B00187MZIY,"The town depicted is Tallula Illinois, population 650.  My sister, who has lived in Tallula 17 years, was shocked to see her town and neighboor ""Irish"" in the film.",1219363200,,164,4.655172413793103
8268713,5,B00187MZIY,"I highly recommend this movie for everyone.  It takes the viewers on a journey with the characters, drawing you in and leaving you wanting more.

8268715,5,B00187MZIY,"This film, by far, is one of the absolute BEST films I have ever seen- across any genre.

I had the opportunity to view the film at the Rt. 66 Film Festival in Springfield, Ill; and I must say I was totally blown away! The team at Downstate Productions fully delivers a quality, award winning film with an excellently crafted, constantly developing story line and pairs that with superb acting. The editing and the music accompany this piece so well, and it is so smooth and fluid- you sometimes forget you are watching an independent film.

I very highly recommend this film- to anyone. You will not be disappointed.",1209254400,,617,4.651376146788991
8268716,5,B00187MZIY,"Most indy films are still ""big budget"" and still consist of campy, hoaky, trite plots. Troubadours bypasses the nonsense and gets to the grit. It's not how you you think or may even want it to turn out, leaving he viewer in a place of their own, not being told how to feel or how to interpret the film. That's filmmaking.",1209168000,,321,4.278688524590164
8268717,5,B00187MZIY,This movie delivers a beautiful and simple song to the soul. Amazingly poignant performances with down home charm.,1209081600,,114,5.388888888888889
8268718,5,B00187MZIY,"A wild ride.  Both painfully claustrophobic and redemptively liberating.  Characters are both unique and like all of us.  Honesty at its finest.  The score only heightens the senses for this film, as if your ears are located somewhere in the gut.  It ends like a real movie should-- leaving you looking for better answers.",1209081600,,322,4.888888888888889
