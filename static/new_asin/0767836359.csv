The one movie where Pitt's acting ability  outweighs his good looks.  Tom Skerritt and Craig Sheffer shine as the  ensemble cast.

19223,3,0767836359,"A RIver Runs Through It is a story of one man's life and how his childhood affected the life he choose to lead. Norman grew up in a traditional household, with a father as the head of the household and breadwinner and family's moral compass, the mother as the homemaker, and their two sons. It is around this time period where childhood also leaves the notion of children being economic assets behind, and instead begins to focus on emotional childhoods based on social class and the resources the family had. Throughout the movie, you can see both Norman and Paul rebelling against their father as the head of the household and his spiritual leadership - Norman leaves Montana to go to college, while Paul turns to drinking and alcohol.",1512691200,,737,4.72093023255814

The romance is what seems normal in life, enjoyable and touching.  It's a beautiful movie in many ways.  I'm not a fly fisherman, but I loved learning and seeing the art of it.  For the time of 1915..., the pastoral father did not buy into scripture that says spank ""spare the rod spoil the child"" - seems unusual for that day.  He drew me closer to him over time; while stoic he comes through with love; this surprised me in a pleasant way.  I was touched by sibling love that is pure and enduring; this is the best part - saying less is more.  Good life messages are shared.

The story of two young brothers as they grow up under their stern pastor father, who is also there home school teacher, amazingly portrayed by Tom Skerritt. As close as the brothers are they are very different in many ways and you see this as the story progresses. Brad Pitt and Craig Sheffer give excellent performances as the two brothers.

You think this has some sense of reality to it let me know.  The Hollywood environment will never produce a Shakespeare, Dickens, Solzhenitsyn, Dostoyevsky, or Tolstoy.  Hollywood is to arrogant, egotistical, or vain to be of much value. They usually make movies from books by contemporary authors with a political or social agenda of contemporary times.  Makes you question motivation. You will find movies that were made years earlier at 2 to 3 times the value in price and contextual quality.

19308,2,0767836359,"Review of A River Runs Through It
Hot Toasty Rag, September 25, 2017

This famous movie from the 1990s follows brothers Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt as they grow up and react to their strict father, Tom Skerritt. Its a period piece, in the years after WWI, going through the Great Depression, and while the boys take their separate paths, they're always tied to each other because of family, home, and their mutual love of fly fishing.

Robert Redford directed this family drama, and as always, you can see his love for nature in every scene. Hes also the narrator in the movie, so if you think you recognize the voice in the beginning of the movie, you're right. Redford specializes in directing beautiful nature scenes and capturing emotional turmoil within a family. A River Runs Through It is very pretty to watch, but as much as I love Robert Redford, its not my favorite of his films. Dont throw anything at me, but Im not really a Brad Pitt fan, so I found myself rooting for Tom Skerrit more often than not.

Watch the preview to see if its your style. I like The Horse Whisperer better, but if you're one of the millions of people who drool over Brad Pitt, you're going to want to rent this one alongside Legend of the Falls.",1506297600,,1233,4.471111111111111

19339,4,0767836359,"There has been a substantial amount of talk around town of late about running the clock back to the so-called golden age of America when working stiffs had a chance to get ahead in the 1950s. Of course not all boats rose at that time, especially among blacks and white Appalachian hillbillies like my family who never even got close to the boat, but we will let that ride for now. If one really wanted to look at something like latter day Eden in the American experience then perhaps one needed to go West, go out to Big Sky country where they took their religion, their work ethic and their, uh, fly-fishing seriously in the early part of the twentieth century if the plot-line of this film under review Robert Redfords adaptation (and narration) of Norman Macleans memoir A River Runs Through It.

What this film looks at is a kinder, gentler time out among the big rocks and the fast running western rivers as seen through the eyes of Norman Maclean, played by Craig Sheffer, looking at his coming of age and growing up adventures along with his wilder younger brother Paul, played by younger wilder Brad Pitt, up against the stern Jehovah out of the wilderness father figure minister father, played by Tom Skerritt who took both his religion and his fly-fishing seriously. The early part of the film aside from serious breathe-taking looks at the Montana wilds involves the usual boys coming of age stuff including defying the cloying family home life  befit a ministers sons. Later after some time away from college in the East Norman came back for a time before setting out for a career as a professor. In Cain and Abel fashion (without the murderous impulse) Paul stayed home, stayed in bedrock Podunk Montana working as a newspaperman after college but more to the point living the high life as a gambler, fist-fighter, heavy drinker and woman chaser, including having a Native American girlfriend (and just to prove that those times were perhaps a little less edenic for Native Americans she faces as much Anglo hostility as blacks faced in the that golden age 1950s).

A lot of the latter part of the film dealt with the romance (and eventual marriage) of Norman and local belle, Jessie, played by Emily Lloyd, whose stand-off-ishness drove Norman crazy before he got his chance at a professors job at the University of Chicago and she agreed to marry the guy. It also dealt with the demise of Paul who seemed to have been stricken with the mark of Cain and was eventually murdered and left to die in some back ally for what could have been any number of reasons from serious gambling indebtedness to drinking to hanging around with Native American women. So maybe in the end the only thing idyllic back then were those beautiful rivers and the joy some took in fly-fishing against the hard realities of human existence. Excellent film though with a good ensemble cast and great cinematography. Robert Redford did good, did very good on this one.",1492300800,,2956,4.713733075435203

19394,5,0767836359,"This is an AMAZING movie.  I love Missoula,Montana (where it takes place and is mostly filmed) and the visual of the hill behind the school during several scenes, the hill that now houses the the 'M' in rocks with a trail (steep hike) up the mountain.  I lived there for a year.

Point being, it's beautiful now and was even more ruggedly, gourgeous when the movie was portrayed to be filmed there and the historical media used for the film.  They accentuate the 'Beaty of the Wild West' (at that period in time) and that is a major reason to love the movie.  It is very realistic, and harnesses light on the rustic and rough nature of the geographical region as well as society at that point in time..  It portrays what I know by growing up in the mountains and about the early European heritage settling in This great country during that time.

The acting and the play/screen writing is also high classily, historically accurate in my opinion having studied and living in that country for much of my life.

Of course this role was well played by Brad Pitt to say the least.  One of my fav Pitt carachters.  The other actors where very good as well.  The whole family that the plot circles around are very good actors.

Lastly the story is weaved in a very interesting and followable way.  It's an easy watch.  (In my opinion).  Very entertaining with followable but not boringly so plot.  It is a moving adventure of growing up in that time period and geographical region.  That is very 'romantic' or a 'utopian' society for me.  Not that it's was perfect, but it seems more simple and pure of truth and honesty to me.  (While this may not be true just my romanticize he the time period and region).  It at least makes me feel good to watch it for at least entettainments sake and to day dream of a time more simple and without the outrageous mess technology has made our workd.

I would have loved to grow up to be a 'proffesional fly fisherman' too. Also, not to dismiss the young men that play the families' boys at the beginning of the movie where also well picked for thier roles and were very moving. They personified growing up in the mountains and reminded me of growing up in the mountains.  Playing outside from dusk till dawn.  This is a great movie for the family; a little adult situational events and language.  But nothing they aren't already regularly subjected to (for the most part) in this day in age.  And also in my opinion.  Good date movie too, a good laugh here ad there, touching moments, and the tragic and beautiful intersecting circles of human nature of love, life, family and presented during a time frame as well as its geographical region.  It's one my top 5 fav films.  I'm very picky about movies and somewhat portals of semi accurate time periods as well as the real nature of sociological views and values, moral and material itwMs and entertainment vs work ethics of a time period.",1482364800,4,2920,4.51047619047619

Redford directs brilliantly, and he gets the performance of a lifetime from Tom Skerrit as the boys' minister father.

Its ultimate lesson--that we must strive to love completely those whom we understand only incompletely--is a profound one, but it flows from the story and the characters so naturally as to seem not a lesson at all.  This film is a quiet masterpiece.",1446249600,,664,4.698275862068965

I wasn't expecting it and rarely find a movie that moves me in such a way. Robert Redford is a very underrated director and even actor!

The portayels of the brothers were very realistic and you felt that you could relate even if you have friends who are very close to you. It has made me want to go out into the open air of the country.

The bonus features are severely lacking however (at least on the DVD version). The only real ""extras"" are a filmography of the main actors and a small glossy booklet (with multiple editing oversights that lead me to believe it was hastily put together) about the making of the movie, a note from Norman Maclean's daughter, and another filmography that renders the one on the DVD redundant.

19808,5,0767836359,"Robert Redford can make a poignant, visually stunning film, and one of his finest examples is A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT.  It's the story of two fly-fishing brothers coming of age in 1920s Montana, told in the form of a memoir by older brother Norman Maclean (Craig Sheffer).  Norman is a deep thinker, the complete opposite of his kid brother Paul (this was Brad Pitt's film career launching pad), who is rambunctious, rebellious, and ultimately self-destructive.  While both brothers rebel against their stern minister father (brilliantly played by Tom Skerritt), Norman manages to get a college degree from back east and contemplate leaving his home state, while Paul is in and out of trouble and constantly running up gambling debts.  Yet the brothers bond by fly fishing; it is a mutual commonality that defines their closeness and love.  These fishing sequences are some of the most compelling scenes in the film, and Redford delivers the vistas magnificently.

While watching the film, the viewer inherently knows there is a tragic component that will manifest itself, yet the beauty of Norman's memories offsets the tragedy and helps deliver the lump-in-your-throat ending.  Sheffer gives an admirable performance as the brooding older brother, and he's augmented by romantic interest Jessie (Emily Lloyd).  Yet Pitt's persona literally leaps from the screen; the actor is a bona fide scene stealer.  Poignant, emotional, touching, cerebral, and often funny, A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT is a gorgeous film enthusiastically recommended.

Now whenever the legislature convenes, Montanan's has to worry about what kind of mis-guided laws are going to be passed jepardizing more liberties and freedoms to be lost on the State level let alone by the Federal laws.

19867,5,0767836359,"Norman Maclean's memories are brought to life by the handsome Actor/Director and Academy Award winner Robert Redford, who captured the beauty of life in this poignant story, that is set in the backdrop of the breathtaking beautiful and scenic, State of Montana. The movie chronicles the lives of two son's whose father was a Christian Minister, but his boys were as diverse as can be, with the exception of one thing: FISHING! Not spiritual fishing as in the catching of souls for the Kingdom of God, but the physical fishing complete with hook, reel and rod and of course, the worm. The binding tie between father and son's and even between brother's, a family tradition that their father taught them, the intertwining of worms, fly catchers, fish and the art of fishing as it weaves through daily life. There's nothing like it. There's a certain art and style to fishing that one must practice always, in order to get the fish to voluntarily come, to your hook. Be it people or aquatic specimen. Then, you have to know how to hold the line, so that the fish will bite, even when it's not hungry. Norman (Craig Sheffer), the eldest son, writes his now acclaimed memoirs and the younger son as portrayed by Actor Brad Pitt, was a rambunctious risk-taker in his drinking and gambling as well as in his other pursuits (women & gambling), and preferred to live life..., on the edge. Except when it came to fishing. Then, he humbly followed in daddies and big brother's, fishing footstep's and even developed a style of his own. A memorable film with endearing family values and lessons in life, that are subtly gripping. It is yet another Robert Redford Film Classic which is to be treasured. You'll enjoy this one...

The cast in this movie is wonderful; main characters played by Brad Pitt, Craig Sheffer, Brenda Blethyn, Emily Lloyd, and Tom Skerrit.  The setting is in Montana of the early 20th century, about two young brothers growing up in the home of a Presbyterian minister superbly played by Tom Skerrit. The father is an erudite man who not only homeschools his boys in the scriptures, but classic literature and poetry. A far better education than received in schools. However, he is also a fly fisherman, and teaches them life lessons from this perspective as well. The story follows them as they grow into young men.

19891,4,0767836359,"SPOILER ALERT

""A River Runs Through It,"" a historical drama that begins around 1912 and carries through 1938, feels  more like a combination of poetry and painting than film-making in any usual sense. I've seen it twice, once when it came out and again recently. I appreciated it more in my 50s than I did when I'd just turned 30, but still can't totally love it.

This film is lovingly and painstakingly made, gorgeous to look at, delves into human depravity in the Presbyterian sense in a way you don't expect of mainstream Hollywood movies, hews closely to the highly literary source material, and you can't fault any individual performance, so I have to give it four stars, But I still have problems with it.

First, in terms of story, there's not much going on. A Presbyterian minister (Tom Skerritt), a stern but decent and loving man,  raises his two sons in Missoula, Montana, and bonds with them by teaching them the art of fly-fishing. The older son, Norman, is steady, serious-minded and, especially as played by Craig Sheffer as an older teen and young adult, rather dull. The younger son, Paul, is brilliant at fishing, full of life and wildness, an iconoclast, a gambler in every sense of the word, a bright shooting star destined to crash and burn. Norman plods towards his destiny, including a degree from Dartmouth, an uneventful courtship with a woman named Jessie (Emily Lloyd), and an offer of a teaching post at the University of Chicago while Paul races headlong into his. Because a key theme of the movie is that we so seldom can help the people we most care about (after all, these are Presbyterians, and Presbyterians believe in predestination), there's no dramatic tension. We know Paul's headed for trouble and nobody, least of all Norman, can do a thing about it.

Second, Brad Pitt, just coming off his star-making supporting turn in ""Thelma and Louise,"" exudes so much charm and charisma as Paul compared to everyone else that it's off-balance. It's not that Pitt overacts or shows off. He's simply a 100-watt bulb next to a bunch of 25-watts. His character needs to be set apart from the others, but he's too far apart. In fact, all the actors, while individually excellent, never seem to gel as an ensemble. Yes, I know, the movie says we often don't understand those we live closest to and love best, but most real families have intimacy even when they lack understanding. In this film, the chasms between the characters are too wide.

Third, the pacing is so terribly slow.  The movie runs just a little over two hours but feels much longer. About 95 minutes would have been sufficient. Some scenes involving Norman's courtship with Jessie (Norman meeting Jessie's family; Norman and Paul taking Jessie's brother Neal fishing) which, while humorous, could have been cut without taking anything away from the movie's core, which is the relationship among Paul, Norman and their father.

If you're in the mood for something beautiful, thoughtful but not very eventful, ""A River Runs Through It"" will suit you nicely.",1409616000,2,3049,4.836852207293666

soon all will lighten and carries off the the shadows cast upon the mind.

A shining light that loves to play upon the brightly surface of the waters,
and often as old friends they will switch-so the sky becomes a stream.

And the stream shines like the light, for one could not live without the other.

This is just a good old-fashioned movie about an American family, their struggles, love, bonds, friendship, and, of course, how a river in Montana runs through all of it. It's not mind-blowing film-making, but if you like heart-warming stories, this one may be for you.

20181,5,0767836359,"""A River Runs Through It"" is my favorite movie of all time. Growing up in the Big Horn Mountains in Wyoming, I can relate closely to the lifestyle and environment that the movie portrays successfully.

The film follows the life of two brothers, Paul and Norman, who grow up in Mizzoula, Montana during the early 1900s. They have a stern and religious father who is a pastor and avid fly fisherman. As the film progresses, we see the boys mature into men and how they live their lives in the wild western Montana.

If you like movies with fantastic scenery as well as adventure, this is the movie for you. It is not a movie with BS romantics and follows the true lives of two men trying to live their lives during a hard time in a wild place.

Great acting, beautiful scenery, a simple yet effective plot. That is all.

Pitt who stars with or in several Robert Redford movies reminds me of a younger Redford. I can see why Redford might reminisce about his earlier days by watching Pitt. The two brothers grew up in God's country, Montana. Fly fishing seems to be the main activity in the movie but it's the choices and directions that the brothers take from a common origin that is the movie's main focus.

The kind of movie that you don't laugh a lot or cry, but the kind that after it's over you say that it was good.

The movie does something that films very rarely reach and that is portrayal of real life without attempting to insert events that shake the world. The film is content to portray the moving events of the original story with the calm and compassion that actually occurred. That is a rare perspective and the acting ensemble does a masterful job at driving their characters. From the main protagonists to the fragile/strong portrayal of the American Indian girl on Brad Pitt's arm.

20559,5,0767836359,"The movie is well done and captures your attention, assuming you have the capacity to enjoy this type of movie. The movie is about a minister and his family, narrated by the older son. It portrays a more realistic view of the lives of a religious family in American. In contrast to how religious people are portrayed by the media, sorry I had to add that observation. I see some reviews that focus on the two rebellious sons. I was in a Pentecostal church for five years and I can say that this movie does a good job of showing how different the kids are from the parents, which are very religious. The movie does well in showing how committed the parents can be while their kids are not that committed. I saw this first hand. The parents never stop praying and focusing on their kids, they love them with all their hearts, I've seen this. Although the sons are not really rebellious but have such strong family support that they have the confidence to take their individual talents to the limits. This movie shows that strong family units make strong and talented and healthy individuals.

20617,5,0767836359,"This movie goes to show that you don't have to be rich and have all the fancy gear to be a real fly fisherman. You just have to have love for nature, patience and respect for God's beautiful creation of the earth to enjoy fly fishing. If you fly fish with a sense of peace, respect and for enjoying the beauty that surrounds you then you will have a lot better chance of catching a nice trout, its not about who can catch the biggest fish. Another thing that i really love about this movie is that they don't use nets. Most people probably think that doesn't matter but i disagree. I think its alright to use a net if you are fishing with the intention of keeping that particular fish but i think its stupid when people net a fish that they are going to release anyway. Is it really that hard to wait a few more minutes for the fish to calm down? And do you make sure to wet your hand before picking up the fish? Most of the time you don't even have to touch the fish or take it out of the water to release it. Just use barb-less hooks and get hold of the fly with your fingers and it usually comes right out. Some places are catch and release only but whats the point of being a fisherman if you don't eat the fish you catch? I'm not saying keep every fish you catch but be respectful and don't take more than you need and most importantly do not waste the fish if you do decide to keep it.",1375401600,,1391,4.043478260869565

20619,5,0767836359,"A River Runs Through It is a mythical picture.

The first several times I saw A River Runs Through It since it initially came out in 1992, I viewed it as the first of two Montana Brad Pitt pictures.

But now, I've come to the realization it is a moral story about how somebody who seems to need the most help can't be helped because, like the title says, a river runs through it.

It's an incredible film of superb performances by Craig Sheffer, Brad Pitt, Tom Skerritt, Emily Lloyd, and Brenda Blethyn. Of course, it's nice to see the three topics of religion, Montana, and fly fishing to interweave together as a tale to be told.

Although I like Ordinary People, A River Runs Through It is easily Robert Redford's best directed picture. The cinematography is a lovely touch, and of course, who couldn't in Montana?

20664,5,0767836359,"A River Runs Through It is a masterpiece of both film and storytelling.  It launched a group of movies where the action takes place in Montana.  It tells the true story of Norm Mclean, a Montana born author who is the man of letters from just after the final years of the frontier in America, and Montana in the 1920's was only a generation away from the frontier experience.

The intro to the movie is a master telling of beautiful words, it sets the tone for the entire film.  It almost...almost...has the same pace and meter of the first chapter of the Gospel of John.

""In my family, there was no clear line between religion and fly fishing. We lived at the junction of great trout rivers in Missoula, Montana where Indians still appeared out of the wilderness to walk the honky tonks and brothels of Front Street.""

The story centers around Norm Mclean, his brother Paul-a sort of Cain and Able pair.  Using rich detail the movie explores Norm's relationships with his family, future wife, and future in-laws in a manner all can identify with.  Through it, is fly fishing, the one activity that unites Norm with his father and brother in a way like no other.  It is different than the book in that the events in the book play out when the Mclean brothers are much older men-Norm is married with children and has a career in Illinois.  In the movie, Norm is just out of graduate school, only courting Jessie, and in a younger phase of life.  This altered detail gives the movie a much greater emotional impact than the book.

Ultimately, the film is a careful study of the people one loves-despite their flaws, and it seeks to assuage the grief of losing a loved one when such a loss has no clear answers-no greater meaning.  A great movie for a date or a quiet evening at home.",1366934400,2,1782,4.479876160990712

It is so beautifully filmed by Robert Redford that you can almost feel the sunlight, hear the flies buzzing around you and sense of the cold water of a mountain stream.  The casting was also excellent for this film, though Norman's wife, Jessie, is played a bit too inaccessible by Emily Lloyd.  The supporting cast was well-played, actor Tom Skeritt is wonderful, as usual, playing the preacher father and Brenda Blethyn is reliably strong as Mrs. Maclean.  Brad Pitt is luminous and exudes the beauty of the popular and youthful brother, Paul, whose end is tragic.  Craig Sheffer's character, Norman, is the center of the story and he tells it well.

But, Redford just missed the boat on directing it. It just doesn't hold the interest. The pace is so slow most of the time that you could doze off and there seem to be odd things thrown in for no particular reason. Brad Pitt was too young, with too little depth as an actor to put everything into the role that needed to be there.  He just comes across as a rather delinquent personality with no real depth.  Pretty much a tragedy looking for a place to happen from the time he was just a kid. I think the test of any movie is ""does it grab you and hold you from the first scene?"".

20760,5,0767836359,"When the book was new, my fly-fishing boss recommended I read it, but I didn't because I figured I'm no fly fisherman and it would bore me. Maybe I was wrong.

Craig Sheffer plays Norman, the older brother, and Brad Pitt plays Paul, the younger. They actually look like brothers, which helps a lot. They are the sons of Reverend Maclean, a rather stiff Presbyterian who loves fly fishing almost as much as he loves God, and who sees God in his Montana rivers and the entire fresh, wholesome region.

The bulk of the story takes place during prohibition, and there is an element of that, and of the lawlessness it promoted, in the story. But that's not really what it's about. Norman goes east to Dartmouth, and Paul goes to college in Montana, then takes a job at a local newspaper. But those differences are not really what it is about either. There are women in their lives, good luck and bad luck, but it's really not about that, either.

What is about is a lot harder to describe. It's philosophical, rather than religious, although there sits Reverend Maclean to make it sound like religion. He's a gentle, wise old soul, not one of those hellfire types. I can't really explain it any better than to give you the line from which the title comes:

""All things merge into one, and a river runs through it.""

20763,5,0767836359,"In itself, loving is tragic.  But most of us are not raised to live loveless and alone.  This film, as does the book out of which it came about, takes us through the agony of when love has passed . . . as loved ones pass away, and we are left alone to pay the long price of our short experience of love.  In our daily lives, the rule seems to be: Thou shalt not appreciate whilst thou hast!  It is in the not having-- or, more precisely, in the no longer having-- that we gain a fuller measure of realization of what we had.

No wonder we feel so compelled to imagine a God with a Paradise . . . actually, just a fantacized opportunity to do it all over again (and again, and again, for eternity, until we might hopefully get it right).  But we cannot appreciate what we have when we have it because to do so throughout the time we have the love we seek would rob us of the pleasure of first falling-- i.e., the initial falling in love.  So we soon lose interest in as we abandon what we have, and go off seeking it (what we already have) all over again.  It would seem that to us it is NOT so much the ""having"" as the ""falling"" for it that drives us.

Of course, the point is that the joy of falling lies in its illusion of timelessness.  Thus, once we land and our loving thereafter plateaus, proceeding without further falling, we are faced with the dreadful prospect that love (unlike falling into it) is transient.  It eventually ends (by betrayal, taking for granted, or death).  This is where this movie takes us so starkly-- the transitoriness of the rivers of time.  The flow even gives us the impression of concrete gifts in the fish it grants the skilled angler, but anyone who has kept fish too long before consuming it knows oh so well how transitory that gift of the waters is.  Fishing, therefore, draws us right into the middle of that transitoriness.  The film teaches us that however permanent our happiness might seem when we are falling, a river always runs through it . . . a river of time.

The first hint of Paul's gambling problems in the police sergeant's comments left me wondering why the story had suddenly become so obvious about where it is going so early.  But fishing hero Paul's tragic flaw is not his gambling, but his belief that by plucking the fish out of the river he will overcome the compelling force of the river's flow.  For a moment I thought he would drown as he caught that fish of fishes, but he surmounts.  That got me hopeful, and I forgot (as apparently Paul had) about the gambling . . . I took my eyes off of the fact that no matter how great the achievement, a river runs through it.  The river as mere water did not swallow him up; but the river as the flow of life, love, and temporality sure did!

In the end, I think of this movie as an emotional dum-dum bullet: it makes a very small entry hole, but a gigantic exit wound on the other side.  Like the title says . . . a river runs through it!",1330992000,,2949,4.228571428571429

When my yellow lab died at 13 1/2 years old I had inscribed on his memorial these prolific words from Mr. McClean,  ""Eventually all things merge into one; and a river runs through it.""  My dog and I shared many wonderful memories on the Chattooga River in Georgia and I will always associate the two.  Also my deceased Dad introduced me to Montana where he retired.  I have since visited the Galatin River which is where this movie is filmed.  I just recently learned in my bornagain life that Genesis begins with a river and Revelation ends with a river.  Everything, every emotion in life is captured so beautifully in this film.  I will always be thankful for what Robert Redford has captured.  It chills me like no other.

20846,4,0767836359,"I don't write a lot of reviews but thought this movie deserved it. I bought this movie on a lark. A few of my coworkers are dedicated anglers; and the start of the fishing season brings up the subject. For whatever reason these conversations made me reflective about how this activity is instilled into a lot of us in our youth. This movie came to mind. I've never watched it before until now.
Can't believe some of the parallels in this movie and my own life. I remember fishing with my cousin and my uncle as a kid. We would be clumsily wielding our spinning rods and bait, but there was my uncle, false-casting with his fly-rod standing waist deep in the water. And he was a Scot. At least Scottish ancestry. My childhood Sundays were all about the Presbyterian church. Just took me back to a simpler time. A time when there was still a lot to wonder about.
It seems Hollywood doesn't make these types of movies anymore. I think Robert Redford is holding a line in show business. Great credit to him.
Not many people go to the movies looking for a sublime experience. Accepted the fact that I am one of those people.
Standing in the water surrounded by timeless beauty, time can stop; and all your abilities and memories can meld into one for just a moment. The world can disappear and you are back there in your mind. The oneness and remembrance sustains you. That's what this movie echoed for me.",1305676800,3,1401,4.455252918287938
20847,5,0767836359,"How many brothers really look out for each other? How many brothers do the same activities growing up nowadays? Not many. Not many. And that is the sad truth. However, this film gives a more worthwhile family setting. Brothers who care for each other, who respect their parents...it's all included.

I don't mean to sound like a family fanatic, but it is so true how horrible family life is in America today. Robert Redford, I think, saw that and crafted a brilliant drama to show his vision of a family unlike any we commonly experience today.

Brad Pitt and Craig Sheffer are fantastic as the two Maclean brothers, who grow up learning valuable lifelong lessons from their minister father, who encourages them in noble pursuits of life. Paul (Brad Pitt) is the brother who is constantly causing or getting into trouble. His elder brother, (Craig Sheffer), known as ''the Professor'' by his friends, is the outgoing, studious and hardworking elder brother attempting to lead Paul to the correct path.

20848,5,0767836359,"I really didn't expect to like this movie much.  It looked incredibly boring.  I mean, how engrossing can a film about fly-fishing really be?  In the end though, I have to say that I was blown away by how beautifully paced and effortlessly endearing this film really was.

I guess that's obvious from the five-star rating I handed it.

The film (much more than a mere `fishing film') tells the true story of two brothers growing up (and growing apart) in Montana.  Norman and Paul are a peculiar pair, two boys cut from the same mold and yet very different, very distinct.  Norman (the films narrator) has dreams much larger than his Montana home, while Paul dwells in the comforts (and vices) that come from his laid back life, soaking up the fly-fishing of his youth and making it a central part of his present.  But, life lessons come hard for the pair as they buck society, especially Paul who is an apologetic rebel with a severe losing streak (and substantial gambling debts).

The film comes to life in the acting talents, especially that of Brad Pitt.  Pitt has so much charisma and charm, and it is a beautiful thing when a character comes along that allows him to embrace that part of himself while still adding depth to the role.  The 90's were a good decade for Pitt (between `Thelma and Louise', `A River Runs Through It', `Legends of the Fall', `Seven' and `Fight Club' the man had a ridiculous string of success), in fact he may be the biggest star of the 90's.  What he does here, in `A River Runs Through It', is beautiful.  Taking the rebellious streak of Paul and giving it the angst and painful remorse needed to make him relatable and human, Pitt creates a memorable character who outlives the film itself.

But for me the best thing about this film is Robert Redford (you won't hear me say that too often) and his deft hand at relaying, with tender restraint, the beauty of this budding `sibling' relationship.  You can feel the love and respect just flow from Redford's every pore as he delicately settles into telling this beautiful story.  The camera finds the right nooks to explore and the right scenes to embellish.  The film glows with subtle yet substantial depth, and a lot of that falls on the shoulders of the man who helmed it.

So, if you doubt a film about fly-fishing will touch your heart, think again.  This film extracts the right amount of humanity in every scene, making the art of casting a line as heart-tugging as humanly possible.",1298937600,2,2476,4.586363636363636
20849,4,0767836359,"EDIT: I just want to clarify that this review refers to the original 2009 Blu-Ray release which may have been a special edition.  I just noticed that a new lower priced version is available starting in 2011, and the one I purchased is no longer available on Amazon.  How quickly things change.  My original review follows:

As a trout fisherman I love this movie, but I'm not here to review the movie itself.  I just want to make a few comments about the blu-ray presentation, which I imagine is what many people are here for.  There is a great collection of in-depth ""making of"" features and some other odds and ends--even one that examines the one-time plight of the Big Blackfoot river itself and how it has since been restored.  Most or all of this is in HD.  There is also an informative color booklet about the movie incorporated into the well-designed digipak case.

Is the BD worth an upgrade from the latest DVD release? For the special features: If this is one of your favorite films, I would say yes. For the HD transfer of the film: Probably not, at least if you have a smaller screen.  I watch movies on a 26"" screen from some distance but can generally still see a striking difference between DVD and Blu-Ray.  In this case, there were some intermittent scenes where resolution was much improved, but most others were disappointing.  In particular the aerial shots and many of the wide shots incorporating woods and river scenes were unimpressive.  The original film stock may be at fault, as was suggested in an expert review somewhere else.  And I had very high hopes and expectations, so that might be another part of the problem.

If you are not too concerned about having amazing image quality none of this might matter, but I wanted to put my opinion out there.  The BD is still satisfactory compared to other films from this time period, and the disk is definitely worth a buy if you love this movie but don't own it yet or want the extra special features this release provides.",1297814400,4,1999,4.588732394366197
20850,1,0767836359,"Beautifully photographed, great music score, sucky movie. It's a 15 minute story dragged into, what? a movie that's over 2 hours or only SEEMS that long!

I found the pastor father reprehensible, stuffing HIS beliefs down his son's throats before they were old enough to decide about religion for themselves. He was just a small-town fish trying to be something bigger, basically on a power-trip. The oldest son was not strong enough or independently smart enough to fight him, but the younger son rebelled in that way preacher's kids always do: Major sinning! And boy, did this movie need some sin so you wouldnt fall asleep!

Redford's one of the best directors around, heavy and fantastic on his visuals, but he needs the right material. He even photographed Pitt in ways that remind you of a younger Redford. Hmmm.......

20872,5,0767836359,"This is a wonderful film about families, growing up, and self-destruction.  I saw this when it came out and was again wowed at the elegance of its sentiments and execution, with great psychological realism.  It centers around a gifted young man, who is finding himself and getting ready to leave his first home.  The landscape and the culture of its inhabitants are also important themes - we see the beauty, the customs of the people in all its grace and  macho ugliness.

The plot is also about the young man falling in love.  The girl - one of the last major roles of Emily Lloyd - is coping with a brother who is drinking himself to death, much as the young man's brother is beginning to do.  That is, they share their concern with a beloved family member who is destroying himself.  What a basis for a marriage!  Another unusual aspect of this film is how it deals with the aftermath of a meaningless death, which is extremely rare in film.

Oddly, because he almost never speaks, this is pretty much the only major role that I think Brad Pitt does extremely well.  Redford masterfully used what talent the actor had, without pushing him beyond it.

20874,5,0767836359,"There's only one film that I can think of where when watching it, I literally feel like I'm literally flipping the pages of a book as I'm watching it, and that film is A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT (1992). It is one of the most ""pure"" films that I've ever seen. Set in a small rural community in early 20th century Montana, the film is much more than your by-the-numbers, slice-of-life period piece that Hollywood trots out from time to time. It authentically evokes a real time and place and puts the viewer there, a rare feat. It is not a film of overt depth, yet it has a focused simplicity that effectively translates many basic truths about people that films that try to go deep often fail to do. It allows it's characters to develop at a leisurely pace and grow on the viewer. It doesn't beat the viewer over the head with character details and have scenes where they seem to be in a vacuum. Last but not least, it is one of the most beautifully shot films ever made.

Directed by Robert Redford, I'd say that A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT is his best accomplishment as a film director. Redford also narrates it from the point of view of the main character Norman MacLean (played with sublime confidence by Craig Sheffer). Redford's narration is perhaps the best narration that I've heard in any film...EVER! His narrative is a huge reason why this film works; it is perfectly timed, placed, and spaced, almost like another character in the film. It is ironic that Redford narrates from the POV of Sheffer's character Norman, when it is Brad Pitt, the actor that plays Norman's younger brother Paul, that was considered to be the second coming of Redford. Pitt, who is invigorating and engrossing performance as Paul, gives perhaps the most unpretentious performance of his career. While Norman is our guide and observer, Paul is the film's center, the conduit between the clean-cut, pristine world of the MacLean family (the typical American ideal) and the local brothels, bars, and gambling joints (the seedy underbelly of society).

Rounding out the main cast are Tom Skerritt and Brenda Blethyn as Reverend and Mrs. McLean, the parents of Norman and Paul, and Emily Lloyd, as Norman's future wife Jessie. Skerritt and Blethyn are pitch perfect in their roles, each representing the traditional parental stereotypes, the stern father and the worrisome mother. Lloyd is sweet and charming as Jessie and her courtship with Norman is refreshing as it is simply the story of 2 people who found each other at the right time and place that realize they are each other's soulmates. Additionally, there is a diverse cast of scene-stealing supporting characters providing welcome comic relief played by Stephen Shellen (Jessie's brother), Edie McClurg (Jessies' mom), and especially Susan Traylor (as the local wild girl).

Sheffer and Pitt don't resemble each other in reality, but they really seem like REAL brothers with a love-hate sibling rivalry that never boils over into anything absurd. The way they play off each other is great. The MacLean family scenes are so inviting and authentic that it's unreal! When watching them, I almost felt discomfort at times that I felt like I was spying on them. I would wager that many parents can relate to this family's situation...The Reverend MacLean worrying about his 2 sons' future and Mrs. MacLean just plain WORRYING! And Norman and Jesse's relationship is sweet and understated. The film also dares to subtly tackle issues such as racism (the Indian girl that Paul brings on a double-date with Norman and Jesse) as well and to realistically show the seamier, seedier side of Paul's life (gambling halls and brothels).

The main draw of A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT is the immaculate, pristine scenery of the Montana, the mountains, plains, sky and beautiful rivers. I was glad to find out that the cinematography for this film took home the Oscar because if any film deserves it, this one does! I just wish it had gotten a bit more recognition from the Academy. What Redford has crafted here is extraordinary. As much as the cinematography has been rightly praised, it is the attention to character detail and how it complements the scenery that impresses me the most about this masterwork of cinema.

Just as the Godfather is more about family than it is about gangsters, A River Runs Through It is more than about fly fishing. I was thinking it may be about Grace, as in having a state of grace about one's and one's own loved ones destinies. Why is it that the people who need our help the most, refuse to accept it"" asks Jessie. I couldn't think of an answer. In reading the reviews of the book and later the movie by critics from the Northeast, I found myself asking why they seemed to miss the whole point of the movie. One reason might be one of scale. The east is small and crowded and I think the people living there prefer to place people into easily definable boxes-""liberal"" ""right wing conservative"" ""jew"" ""black"" ""hick"" etc. Easterners think small. The West on the other hand is big. The land is open, the mountains, rivers and lakes are big and the people are open in their thinking and in how they choose to live their lives. Norman believes he can be a great fisherman, a boxer in college and a intellectual. He doesn't limit himself. Paul defines himself more narrowly but wanting to grow up to be a professional fly fisherman and when that doesn't pan out, does the next best thing by finding a job where most of his time is his own, leaving plenty of time to fish. Eastern critics can't, I believe"" imagine such a place.

But visuals do not make a story. Please...the book is a separate issue. I can imagine if you read it, this might make a great accompaniment to the story but on its own - uh uh.

Yes, it is begging to be some sort of metaphysical contemplative puff piece on the nature of family, love, existence, blah blah blabbity blah! What this film lacks are strong characters, heroes, thoughts, ideas, a plot, and anything else worthy of the concept of ""story"". Is it a visual poem? Maybe. But is it good poetry? Does it show why life is worth living? No. It does show why fly fishing is worth pursuing or why Montana may indeed be a nice place to visit or that all young men should grab a hot native chick off of a reservation and get thrown in jail with her.

Legends of the Fall is infinitely better in every single aspect than this little annoyance if you're into Pitt and the whole Bad Brother routine.

You know people who love to have coffee table books around, or Marxist dialectical imperative pamphlets lying around that they pretend to read? Or Jean Luc Godard films that they pretend to understand? Well this my friends is the American equivalent. Think Antonioni but without Monica Vitti and Alain Delon.

Of course it's not all fishing and scenery but a lot deeper than that.

Two brothers, very different in temperament and aspirations love to fly fish with their father, a Presbyterian minister.  The older brother, bookish Norman (Craig Sheffer), does all the usual and expected things of a minister's son.  He is the scholarly more rigid son.  The younger brother Paul (Brad Pitt) is bold and daring.  He likes to take chances and have emotions run wild.  He becomes a journalist for a local newspaper - enjoys each day and pushes the line, but loves his family too.

These two very different brothers are the focus of the story.  They love to fly fish, and enjoy this one sport with their strict but loving father.  Norman comes home from college and sees his brother's life become unraveled by the usual sins of gambling, wild women and drinking.

This is a very strong artful movie that shows not only the power of family, but life, love and nature tied together by fly-fishing.",1253836800,2,1186,4.816831683168317

They managed to put together a nice overall package for any fan of this movie and the Blu quality made for a convincing demo to those that had seen the other two DVD releases of this.

The picture quality came across with solid vibrancy, clarity and saturation. There are plenty of chances for there to be obvious artifact (with all of the sky shots and skin close-ups) but they did a competent removal throughout. If there is any significant doubt as to what the original product looked like - be sure to watch the deleted scenes for the before and after. The sound was better than I was setting the bar for as I am not a fan of TrueHD and how bad some of the vocals turn out. Not a benchmark test for 1990s surround films, but I was pleased.

The supplements are thorough for any fan, and include:

* The 30 minute making-of filled with plenty of background, interviews, excerpts and tidbits of information.
* The Blackout Challenge, Rescuing a River: A 15 minute mix of ecological, environmental and personal story info about the river and saving it for the future.
* Casting a Line: A 6 minute guide on how to start fly fishing, there were actually a few kids that watched this part and seemed interested.
* Deleted Scenes: 17 cut/modified scenes totaling 16 minutes. A few bland, a few interesting - but what it showcases the most is how the film stock looked years ago and how great it looks in this version.
* On The Blackfoot River 1080 Loops: Exclusive to the BD. They contain a looped 1080 view, that is selectable by the user between a ""Rushing River"", ""Rocky Mt"", ""Big Sky Country"" and ""Forest Bend"". All of them have background scores by the film's composer (able to turn that on/off). They all looked and sounded adequate, and the best thing out of them would be the 5.1 mix of water and insect sounds; maybe one of those screen saver moments to have on the display for background and such.

The book has 34 glossy pages of information about the film, the actors and fly fishing. I scanned a couple of them to give an idea of what to expect should you be sitting on the fence about spending the money for this version. As soon as I am allowed to post them here I will (no prebook pics are allowed).

20911,5,0767836359,"""Long ago, when I was a young man, my father said to me, ""Norman, you like to write stories."" And I said ""Yes, I do."" Then he said, ""Someday, when you're ready you might tell our family story. Only then will you understand what happened and why.""

These are the poignant, mysterious lines opening Robert Redford's A River Runs Through It (1992, PG).  I missed this movie when it first came out and just saw it recently on video.  It was a garage sale cast-off.  My neighbor couldn't sell it and gave it to me.  I watched it, didn't like it, and promptly consigned A River to dust bunny exile until another friend suggested I check out the soundtrack.  I did.  Something unexpected happened while listening to Mark Isham's Academy-Award nominated score over and over again: I began to understand the movie's unspoken undercurrents and emotion.  Intrigued by its hauntingly beautiful music, I decided to give A River another go.  I'm glad I did.

Set in the early 20th century in Missoula, Montana, this enigmatic story centers around brothers Norman (Craig Sheffer) and Paul (Brad Pitt) Maclean, two sons of a Scottish Presbyterian minister played with consummate skill by Tom Skerritt.  The quintessential big brother, Norman is reserved, scholarly and sensitive.  Younger sibling Paul(ie) is rebellious, loquacious, a hard drinker, gambler, and brawler.  Neither is an entirely agreeable character, neither is entirely disagreeable.  Like most real people, these brothers have unique strengths and weaknesses and try to help each other through life without fully understanding who the other person truly is.

I still don't ""like"" A River Runs Through It in the sense that it's an upbeat, easy-to-watch, ""feel good"" fluff piece - because it isn't.  Instead, the movie offers a rare blend of affection, distance, dimension, beauty, insight and heartbreak that's both mysterious and captivating.  At times the river seemingly embodies the Maclean family history: placid and serene on the surface, with occasional ripples and swells suggesting deep water or dangerous rapids ahead.

Based on a novella by author Norman Maclean, through whose eyes the story is told, the screenplay brings a literary quality to the screen that's beautiful and moving.  Combined with Academy-Award winning cinematography, solid performances all-around, and a story that's alternately evocative, taciturn, lively, and tragic, A River Runs Through It represents a formidable cinematic achievement of depth, perception, and substance.

In the opening sequences, both young boys and father are united in their love for nature, the Big Blackfoot River and fly-fishing.  Rev. Maclean teaches his boys the fine art of casting to a four-count rhythm cadenced by a metronome.  Along the river they share experiences, casting techniques, stunning scenery, stories and life.  Fishing scenes throughout the film create the sense that each man is at peace with himself and each other at the river while remaining distinctly separate and alone, as does the whole family in this elegant, elegiac story.

Much of the power of this story is gained from its subtlety, which is created and sustained by the narration and masterful direction of Robert Redford.  Rather than resorting to spectacular special effects, mind-numbing dialogue or the gratuitous sex and violence so commonly employed by lesser storytellers with thinner plots, A River expects audiences to pick up on various cues and clues peppered throughout the screenplay with just enough seasoning to maintain full flavor.  A refreshing change from the typical bash-you-over-the-head-with-its-point kind of movie, A River relies on nuance and subtlety to convey its message.

Some viewers - perhaps the less literary among us - have tagged this movie ""boring.""  So did I, until I gave it a second chance.  The story moves at a graceful pace while requiring viewers to engage their minds and hearts to follow a film that ultimately offers more questions than answers.

Underlying themes may include a covert sibling rivalry between Norman and Paul.  It breaks into the open just once - in a kitchen fist fight - but the undercurrents in tone, gesture, facial features and other non-verbals continue throughout the film.  The movie obliquely hints at a dichotomy between Paulie ""the tough guy"" whose ready grin and lackadaisical, lassie-faire attitude belie an inner insecurity and perhaps some envy toward his ""Rock of Gibraltar,"" respectable older brother.  Note Paulie's reaction to Norman's announcement regarding the offer of a professorship at a prestigious university in Chicago.  Paulie doesn't respond verbally, but his face and eyes speak volumes.  This is coupled with Paulie's subsequent decline of Norman's invitation to join him and his future bride, Jessie, in leaving Montana to write for a Chicago newspaper.

""Come with us"" Norman urges.  ""Oh, ""I'll never leave Montana, brother,"" Paulie replies, chewing his lip before plunging back into the river with his rod.  From the way the line is delivered and Norman's reaction, you're not sure if it's a rebuke, a prophecy, or an eulogy.  Whatever it is, the assertion underscores Paulie's continuing struggle to find his own way in life outside of his big brother's shadow.  He then determinedly skims down the rapids to land an ""unbelievable"" fish.  Narrates Redford, ""At that moment I knew, surely and clearly, that I was witnessing perfection.""

""You are a fine fisherman!"" proclaims Rev. Maclean as ""mother's pictures"" are snapped by Norman.

""My brother stood before us, not on a bank of the Bigfoot River, but suspended above the earth, free from all its laws, like a work of art.  And I knew, just as surely and clearly, that life is not a work of art, and that the moment could not last.""

*** SPOILER ALERT ***

Norman's premonition proves true in the movie's compelling closing scenes.  The Missoula police inform Norman that his brother has been found dead, ""beaten to death by the butt of a revolver.""  We're not told exactly how or why this happened, but gather that Paul's murder is connected to his gambling debts and profligate lifestyle.

The impact on the family is quietly immense.  Echoing themes throughout the movie, family members are both together and alone in their grief at the same time.  Visibly shaken, his mother wordlessly retires upstairs.  ""Is there anything else you can tell me?"" Rev. Maclean quietly asks.

""Nearly all of the bones in his hand were broken"" replies Norman grimly, his stoic monotone belying a face etched with pain, shock, and traces of guilt.

Pause.  His father, still in his bathrobe, stands and gently asks, ""Which hand?""

""His right hand.""

As has occurred before in this under-stated film, the obvious is left unsaid: Paul's right hand was his fly-fishing casting hand.  We get the impression that Norman spends the rest of his days struggling with his brother's untimely death as well as the bigger question: Who was this brother of mine?

""Maybe all I really knew about Paul is that he was a fine fisherman"" Redford narrates.  ""`You know more than that',"" my father said.  `He was beautiful.'  And that was the last time we ever spoke of my brother's death.""

Only at the end does it become clear that Paul is meant to be a beautiful mystery.  He's an enigma to viewers because Norman can't understand him any better than we can. Shortly before his own death, Rev. Maclean preaches a sermon that sums up the meaning of the film: ""It is those we love and should know who elude us. But we can still love them.  We can love completely, without complete understanding.""

A River isn't for everyone.  I found the profanity and alcoholic consumption excessive and some minor scenes objectionable but not unreasonable given the subject and its characters.  It's not an ""easy"" movie to watch in the sense that you can allow your mind to wander and still pick up on the visual and non-verbal clues concealed within its gentle subtext.  This movie takes some attentive digging.  But for those who appreciate a lavishly photographed, skillfully sequenced, superbly acted and subtlely nuanced study of family life and relationships, A River Runs Through It is one of the finest.

""I am haunted by waters"" is the final emotion-laden line of this remarkable movie.  An old man who's out-lived nearly everyone he loved, Norman once again stands solo in the river with his fly-fishing rod and his memories.  ""Alone in the half-light of the canyon with the sounds of the Big Blackfoot River and a four-count rhythm and the hope that a fish will rise.  ... Eventually, all things merge into one.  And a river runs through it.  I am haunted by waters.""  Bring Kleenex.",1221177600,4,8692,5.063335679099226
20922,5,0767836359,"Some years ago my brother had the promotion poster for this movie framed and hanging in a wall of his apartment, my first and only thought was that it was a pretty cool photo.

But years after that I realized that it was a lot more and better than just that, when I came accross the actual DVD here on Amazon and I decided to give it a try on top of the nice price it was for sale.

This is a film like those for instance, when it all starts at some point of the characters life and it takes you all the way through their lives until 20 or 30 years later, it is something like The Color Purple, Fried Green Tomatoes, The Green Mile, Driving Miss Daisy and I can keep going on and on . . .
There are actually a lot of movies in that same path and in my humble and personal opinion, I love them.

the story could take place during any generation though, as it is a universal story, about the impermanence of life, of love and heartbreak, of man's connection with the natural world, the intrinsic inner-battles of the unknown, and the discontent beneath the surface of the perpetually unsatisfied, however much they are adored... the cycles of coming of age, of brothers, of parents, of loves, of it all swirling through the heart and head in one moments time, as one pulls back the reel and brings up the shining fish from the sparkling cool waters...

The ending, for instance, shocked me.  I didn't really see it coming, especially since there was hardly any time for the main characters to reflect upon the action that had taken place, and left me without a sense of closure.

20956,5,0767836359,"A River Runs Through It is a difficult film to review or even fairly comment upon. It is beautifully-filmed and overflowing with the sort of natural scenery---thick dark forests, cold, free-flowing rivers, wide-open skies---that in most movies would steal the show. It also features a cast of actors, Tom Skerit,  Emily Lloyd, Craig Sheffer, Brad Pitt, giving what I will long remain convinced is the most outstanding performance of their careers. This classic 1991 motion picture (re-)tells the true story of writer Norman Maclean's youth and early adulthood nearly a century ago in the wilds of rural Montana. Norman is a deep, pensive person, in many ways the opposite of his younger brother Paul, a free-spirited daredevil whose adventurous nature is good-hearted but perilous, as everyone around him except Paul himself seems to see. Norman and Paul's father is an upstanding Presbyterian minister whose scholarly erudition and sternly eloquent sermons give way at frequent intervals to undertaking the great passion in his life: fly fishing. The Reverend Maclean loves nothing more than to take his sons to the river to fly fish for trout. On these trips the elder Maclean imparts life's lessons to the boys and passes on words of wisdom they will each go on to recall during the course of their lives.

Time passes in the film and we leave the boys as youths and rediscover them as young men. A visiting Norman has returned home in the 1920's, having completed college in the east. Paul is now a somewhat infamous regional newspaperman, who uses his articles to skewer corrupt local figures in business and politics. Where Norman is every bit as staid and responsible as his childhood hinted he would grow to be, Paul is a hard-drinking charmer whose fondness for high-stakes poker games in frontier saloons and nights out with the wilder of the local women stands at odds with his upbringing in the respected Maclean household. During the summer that follows Norman's homecoming after graduation, he and his brother and father once again return to the river and fly fish, Norman finds love with a beautiful girl from a neighboring town, and the entire Maclean family watches as Paul slowly destroys himself in a fast life he cannot seem to leave alone. The film tells the kind of engrossing, touching story that very few cinematic works do, and is one of the crowning jewels of modern motion picture achievement. A River Runs Through It is at times funny, at others profound, throughout it radiates its quality, and ultimately...

20960,5,0767836359,"I have heard it said that Norman Maclean's classic novella ""A River Runs Through It"" is the finest piece of American literature ever written. I don't understand how things like literature can be ranked in such simple terms. I will say, however, that it is one of my personal favorites. Spare, poetic and spellbinding. Perhaps one of the reasons that I love this novella so is because I grew up on a farm near the Rocky Mountains, and spent so much time when I was younger fishing and tracking through wood and field. Maclean's tale speaks to me of my youth in authentic and familiar terms.

I generally approach cinematic adaptations of literature, particularly of literature which I hold in such high esteem, with a certain amount of reluctance, even dread. Who could possibly capture the beautiful, simple craftmanship of Maclean's profound prose on celluloid? Evidently, Robert Redford. And he does it with grace and apparent ease. Many of Maclean's efficeintly magnificent words are provided through narration. While I generally find the device of voiceover narration distasteful (primarily because it is so often used to ""coach"" the viewer), in this case, the viewer is drawn into (and eased out of) Macleans world by Macleans own prose, and nothing could be more appropriate or satisfying. Also, the cinematography is nothing short of spectacular, capturing the magnificent, rugged expanse of Montana's ""big sky"" wilderness one moment, the golden intimacy of an afternoon on the river the next. I dare say that Redford has captured the essence of Maclean's abiding love for his childhood wilderness in this film, and we, the viewers, are richer for it.

A River Runs Through It is as close to perfection as I have seen in translating a beloved work of letters onto the cinematic screen. Does it have its flaws? I'm sure it does, and there are other reviews here that will point them out for you if you care. For my part, I wish only to say that this is a story about love, crafted by Maclean with love, and now adapted to the screen by Redford with a care that speaks of love - love of the subject matter and the written words. Macleans last words in the novella (and the movie) are ""I am haunted by waters.""

20982,5,0767836359,"I've heard naysayers badmouth this movie, but I've never understood it.  They use descriptors such as ""preachy"", ""overly dramatic"", ""self-important"", and so on.  Good grief!  What are you, bait fishers (not that there's anything wrong with that)?  This is the story of this man's family, and it is truly beautiful.

I guide trout fishing trips in Missouri, so, of course, I love this movie partly for the fishing.  This film explained my fly-fishing passion to my wife more effectively than my words and dragging her along on a few fishing trips ever could.  The scenes are filmed magnificantly and are done in such a way that you can follow the logic and instinct that each fisherman uses to catch each fish.  However, the story is so much more than this.

The story begins with Norman making note that there was never a clear line between religion and fly-fishing in his family, and that parallel continues throughout the story and his life.  Success as a fly-fisherman is based on knowledge, physical skill, intuition, and emotion, but balance is also required.  That balance only comes through spirituality, whether you are stiving to be a Godly person, or whether you simply commune with nature in a spiritual fashion.  Without balance, a tangled line can cause you to pull your hair out.  With balance, even the most unsuccessful fishing trip brings joy.  And so Norman stuggles with understanding his younger brother Paul, who has attained such miraculous balance on the river, but whose life away from the river is rapidly spinning out of control.  In the end, the observant viewer should recognize that it is Paul's pride that eventually leads to his downfall, and it is the family's failure at their attempts to rescue Paul that they continue to struggle with the remainder of their lives as well.

Norman spends his life trying to tap into God's balance through fly-fishing in the hopes that he will someday understand what happened to his family and why.  Perhaps finally writing his book helped him to answer a few of those questions.

20983,5,0767836359,"The narrative of Robert Redford is captivating, uplifting, and graceful.  'On the banks of the Big Blackfoot River....' a place I've been, and long to return.  Nothing, el zippo, tops the splendor and majesty of Montana, nothing even comes close!  It's timeless valleys, raging aqua-tinted torrents, and green alpine towns and villages dispersed all throughout its western landscapes define 'National Treasure.'  Missoula, Montana, home to the Maclean family, is a good old fashioned town of turmoil and unsetteldness squaring off against an unmistakable serenity with nature's works and ways.  'To the beat of a four count rhythm....' might not be the most instructive of flyfishing casting approaches (I've lost many a woolybugger in willow trees climbable only by the most inane of flytiers), but it makes for undulating cinema.  'Oh I could never leave Montana brother...' is a line beckoning truth; after visiting Montana on several occasions (first was an Amtrack train ride in '94... ok a person could easily get up and go from Havre, MT) getting to catch sights of Glacier to the north, the Bitterroot range in the south, and all that lies in between (e.g. Flathead Lake)....there are no fleeting instincts.  A geologist could be lost in paradise in, say, Yellowstone for ages, not even taking into consideration the abundance of mountain ranges lining Montana's western front - stretching north to south, from Great Falls to Anaconda.  Redford's directing brings along the viewer through every imaginable trace of landmark - riverbanks, pubs, train stations, backyard fields with forest and mountain top afar, and even a couple sunburned rawhides!  Not a favorite still shot.  Boats are stolen, category 'forget about it' white waters are paddled through, unpaid gambling wagers bring conflict wrought with misunderstanding, dinner table discussions of Calvin Coolidge's fishing secret '...what are they bitin on?....The end of my line!' and job satisfaction are brought up, shortcuts winding their way through train tunnels are taken, and in the end, reflection and memories are revealed in honest fashion.  Verdant pastures and picueresque backdrops steal the film's premise, offering more than just basic storyline.  But the moment of closure is why I adore Robert Redford's film set in Missoula....in addition to the melancholic violin intermezzos.

'On some of the rocks are timeless raindrops. Under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs. I am haunted by waters.'

Anyone ever visiting Montana will register in their sights and other senses this inescapable impression.  Don't forget, if you're going to fish these pristine waters (i.e. Yellowstone, Clearwater Creek, Madison, Bighorn, Big Hole, Gallatin, Beaverhead, Kootenai Rivers), catch-and-release is the only real keeper!

20986,5,0767836359,"I first saw this film when I was eleven. My father taped it, and when I was thirteen, I watched the tape again and again. Being that young, I could not understand the symbolism involved, I simply knew that the movie was ""beautiful."" Each time I watched ""A River Runs Through It"", it grew in me, as if I felt a deeper sense of spiritual awakening just from seeing the movie. Now I am 21 years old and an English major, so the symbolism is much clearer.

In the film, there are two brothers, Paul and Norman. The father, the Reverend MacLean teaches the two brothers how to cast a fishing rod. The two learned to cast with a four count rhythm, with a metronome playing. The narrator Norman says of his father: ""If he had had his way, no one who did not know how to catch a fish, would be allowed to disgrace a fish by catching it."" It becomes clear that this simple way to catch fish, using a four count rhythm, is graceful. If a fly-fisherman swings his rod too powerfully, it might become stuck in some trees. If he swings too weakly, it will never go into the stream where the fish are biting. But the four count rhythm method of casting, is ""just right.""

Paul is a rebellious, golden-haired youth. His rebellion starts early when he refuses to eat his porridge. He gets into a fight with his older brother Norman, but all is forgiven. The next day, Norman watches his little brother break free of his father's ""four count rhythm."" He has rebelled into something courageous and original. Though despite its own unique beauty, its gracefulness is different than Norman and his father. It has less control. He calls it ""shadow casting"" later in life. Like the ""shadow casting"" Paul's life has less structure than Norman's.

Norman has always had that spiritual grace that comes with swinging the rod just right. It's almost as if he has spiritual gifts as well as his academic ones. (Norman receives a masters degree and becomes a professor.)

Paul's spiritual gifts are no less important, but they are not sustainable, because they lack the discipline and the structure of Norman. Despite his sad outcome, Paul's fishing and his life are ""beautiful."" They are beautiful because you can love them ""completely, without complete understanding.""

I wish other films were made now like this one. It is extremely effective as a spiritual project because it not only conveys the message, but the viewer feels the message, the way I had when I was thirteen. It inspired me to stay in my best structure, like Norman had.",1136073600,9,2512,4.610738255033557

The original DVD really has no features, except for containing my favorite movie of all time. Does anyone know what this DVD contains?

20988,4,0767836359,"This is the story of two brothers (Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt), sons of a Presbyterian minister (Tom Skerritt), growing up in rural Montana in the early part of the 20th century.  All three are passionate about fly-fishing to the extent that it becomes a form of worship for them.  As the years go by, the family begins to grow apart as the older brother makes a life for himself in another part of the country and the younger brother, though remaining close to home, drifts away from his spiritual upbringing into a life of gambling and alcohol.  Yet they always have fly-fishing, a bond that allows them to periodically and temporarily reestablish the closeness that has been lost.  This film is very interesting and moving in the way it portrays the tension between the reality of children establishing their own lives away from their parents and the resulting sorrow and nostalgia over the weakening of familial bonds.  It also explores the mysterious way in which some people seem to be drawn onto self-destructive paths./",1126915200,7,1028,4.851428571428571
20989,5,0767836359,"Yes the movie is filmed in beautiful Montana - though I do not recall any winter scenes and those must be part of what formed young boys growing up there. Equally cold should be the religious view. This is somewhat reflected in the house. It can be especially seen in the contrast between the family of the future bride (why not see the wedding?) Methodists (""Baptists that can read"") and that of the groom - Presbyterians. This might have played out somewhat like the contrast between families in ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"". But this does not seem to be the main point. The main contrast is between brothers. Suppose the one has religion and the other has fishing. One becomes a professor: the news sends mom into a most embarrassing explosion of joy. The other wants to be a professional fly fisherman - but there is no such profession. This frustration leads to the conflict in Paul who clearly is not full of joy with anything else he does. Booze and a wonderfully though too briefly developed character of an Indian woman - (if only she could have played a bigger role in more ways than one!) are all that keep Paul from the deep end - even Presidents don't consider fishing with enough seriousness. ""What are you going to catch them with?"" ""The end of my line."" Fishing might hold all the answers - especially if you listen to the voices under the rocks - but society demands something more and Paul can not manage this. For any parent that worries about losing one - or several - how do you know they are saved? - this is a mortal dilemma. Yes, we can love them completely even without understanding, but is this a flaw in Presbyterianism? Is that a sufficiently emotional religious connection with the divine in man? Baptists lose some of their own too - and to the same things. ""Why do the ones who need help the most refuse to take the help they are offered?"" (I am sure I did not get that quote correctly but it is close...) Good question.

On a lighter note, my wife and I argued over whether or not this is a ""chick flick"" or not. I thought yes, she thought no. ""It's just about men fishing!""",1120176000,5,2105,4.425257731958763
20990,5,0767836359,"This is a beautiful film.  It made a lasting impression on me in a way that few films ever manage to do.  It is set in 1920s Montana, a land that still had some of the Old West left, and as the story says, ""a land with dew still on it...""  The real star of the story is Montana itself, and this film I think fully captures the flavor of that place in those times.  The cinamatography of this film is very good, and gives the viewer an appreciation of the natural beauty of the state.

The basic theme of the story is the maturation of two brothers, and their relationship with their stern, Presbyterian minister father.  One brother is level-headed, destined for a life of teaching and achievement.  The other brother, equally precocious, is seduced by his love of gambling and drinking to the point where his life becomes corrupt.  As his father says, sometimes those who need our help do not want it, and indeed do not wish to be helped.  The common bond between the brothers and their father is fly fishing in the great trout rivers of Montana, and this makes for a wonderful backdrop to a very interesting storyline.  The interaction between these protagonists is a fascinating interplay of personalities, and (although you may not know it from this review) the storyline of this film moves along briskly, and keeps the viewer's interest.

Although I usually don't like films that feature a narration, this one is an exception.  Robert Redford (who has no other role in the film) does a fine job narrating the film from the standpoint of Norman Mclain, one of the two brothers.

The DVD is crisp and clear, and constitutes a good value.  As far as I could tell, no scenes were cut.  The discerning viewer will return to this one many times.",1116979200,3,1744,4.544871794871795
21001,4,0767836359,"This movie is a favorite of mine.  The story is a simple, yet moving one and the scenery is breathtaking--a natural side-effect of its gorgeous setting, the Bitteroot Mountains in Montana.

The characters are tender and their lives are real and delicate.  The themes concern the nature of faith (both in God and in the people you love) and the helplessness of watching those you love self-destruct; they are conveyed with patience and generousity of spirit.  The director respects the individality and privacy of his subjects.

I usually refrain from commenting on other reviews here, but I would like to state that this film is, in no way, ""clueless..."" or vapid.  It acknowledges some sad truths about human beings and their frailties...frailties born of love.  There is no perfect faith and no perfect human being and it is often hardest for us to help the ones closest to us.  Sometimes no amount of pulling on the proverbial ""boot straps"" is going to change the outcome. Life would be nice if it were that simple...sometimes it isn't--It's even happened to conservatives on occasion.

The film is a visual joy; and a heart-string tugger.  You'll be glad you invested in it.",1110931200,5,1178,4.874371859296482
21002,5,0767836359,"When I first saw this film, shortly after it came out, I was disappointed that it did not stay closer to the book.  Now, watching it again, I realise just how much the filmmakers have achieved in capturing the spirit of Norman Maclean's novella describing his life growing up in rural Montana in the early years of the twentieth century.

The casting is excellent, with a career-defining role for Brad Pitt.  It's almost as if the director has taken the author's description of Paul, ""he was beautiful"" at face value.  Playing opposite him, Craig Sheffer makes a suitably stiff-necked contribution as his elder sibling.

I also liked Emily Lloyd's performance as Norman's future wife Jesse.  Strangely, she isn't refered to on the cover of the DVD, whereas Brenda Blethyn, who has far less screen time, takes joint billing.  I guess this just reflects the older actress's higher profile.

This film has so much to offer: flawless scenery and costumes, wonderful casting and fine acting.  You also get the added bonus of Clint Eastwood's narrating.  Yet I'm not sure that it will capture the imagination (or at times even make much sense) to people who haven't read the book.  However, it's still one of the best adaptations I've ever seen.",1107216000,,1239,4.880382775119617
21003,4,0767836359,"River Runs Through It is a pretty film that pays tribute to the joys of fly fishing and the beauty of Montanna. It is has a plot that is one of the slowest to unwind that I've ever seen but it's based on a short autobiography and it had to be stretched and padded for the movie.

You have a soft hearted minister who has two sons. One is sensible and tells the story, the other one is ""wild"". Brad Pitt plays the wild brother, Norman. Norman is beautiful and charming and his family loves him and indulges him too much. He has a big time gambling  problem and he hangs out with some bad people. You know how this is going to shake out. Norman might as well have Grim Reaper standing behind him in every scene and when he dies young and off screen you aren't surprised.

Other than that not much happens.",1104019200,4,803,4.167741935483871
21004,1,0767836359,"Since this movie seems to inspire nothing but praise in this forum, I thought I'd toss out an opinion against the current. I think people of faith ought to be warned against this movie. It is the kind of movie that religious people are naturally drawn to. It deals with the brokenness and failure in human relationships, and it has some religious themes, or I should say, the author clearly *thinks* that he is making an artistic commentary on spiritual themes. He portrays the father of the protagonists, who is a pastor, to be a 2-dimensional pharisee, full of reflex prejudices and social conformisms. There is nothing redeeming about the father. He is just a caricature that, no doubt, reflects author's resentment of the inadequacies of the faith of his own parents. In fact, the movie is really only ""spiritual"" in so far as it provides a nice portrait of how liberals view religious people, on the one hand, and depicts the spiritual impotence of faithless people on the other. The sentimentality in this movie is mind-numbing. Once again, this reflects the author's idea of the essence of the religious belief he has personally left behind. It reminds me of a movie Jane Fonda made some years ago called Golden Pond - a movie full of anti-family, anti-religious hatreds, with a veneer of sentimentality that is supposed to disarm religious people, because after all, isn't sentimentality what religion is all about? But this is by no means the most repugnant aspect of this film. This is a film full of despair, written by someone who is powerless to heal a hangnail, much less a serious spiritual disfunction, precisely because the power of living faith is completely alien to him. Obviously, tragedy and self-destructive behavior occur in families of faith, but art is like quantum measurement: it necessarily distorts what it measures, and the more explicit the ideological message, the bigger the distortion. Misery likes company, and this film is simply an invitation to the shared misery of a cynical, sorrowful, spiritually impotent liberal living in a post christian culture. There is absolutely nothing edifying or liberating in the entire film, unless you think bitter self-pity is liberating. Secularists of the sentimental sort might enjoy this opportunity to wallow in their own heartache, and outdoorsmen might enjoy the scenary. People of faith should just pass this one up. Pretty scenary does not give mystical meaning to stupid despair, nor does it vindicate it. If you are a person of faith, save your dollars for a movie created by someone who knows what faith really is. And Please don't give your money to these despairing clowns who are wise in their own eyes. They will only use it to make more vapid movies.",1102550400,30,2740,4.945770065075922
21005,3,0767836359,"This film about two brothers growing up at the turn of the century is full of great river and countryside scenes. Life is shown as it was before radio and T.V. The quiet in the house and how people worked and lived in those days was interesting. The movie touches on love and how families drift apart no matter how hard people try to keep them together. Tom Skerrit does a great job as their father who also is a minister who loves to fish. Going to college back then meant taking a train to a far away state and having to write letters back to your family for communication; very different from our lives. Families and communities did things together back them more than now,as choices for entertainment were limited. The film also shows the brother's and father's love for the river and for fishing. It also has some very sad parts which leave the viewer thinking about their own life and what's really important to them.

21006,5,0767836359,"Any director can fill a screen with pretty things and call it beautiful, just as any writer can fill a page with words and call it poetry.  Those who have not yet been deluded into believing in total relativism know, however, how difficult true beauty and true poetry are to create.  Greatness in film, like greatness in poetry, requires hard work, and that work comes to little unless it is inflamed with a divine light.

A River Runs Through it is a work of great beauty and true poetry.  It is a film that I believe is destined to become a significant part of our national heritage, and in the long run I also believe that it is the most significant work for which Robert Redford will be remembered (not to take anything away from his other excellent work.)  During his time here on earth, it would appear that he has been fortunate enough to attain something resembling wisdom, and all of it is communicated in the exquisitely simple, yet divinely inspired, way in which this film gives us these characters and this story.

Having also read Norman MacLean's books, I will mention that this film is an ""adaptation"" of his story of the same title.  It is, however, that rarest of adaptations in that it gives up nothing to the original, and does it full and complete justice in every way that matters.

With each viewing of this film over the years, its profound use of symbolism and metaphor becomes ever more apparent to me.  It is truly a family story in that it revolves around the universal themes of sibling rivalry, parental tribulation, the tenuous beginnings (and deep foundations) of love and the seemingly random but somehow inevitable movements of the hand of fate.  You don't need to be a fisherman or have any interest in fly fishing to be deeply moved by this film; you simply need to be a human being.

In closing, I would like to beg Mr. Redford for a digitally remastered and restored director's cut in widescreen on DVD with an interview with him as a special feature.  This film deserves the royal treatment, and it's about time it got it, don't you think?",1095033600,13,2078,4.571428571428571

At the very least, you'll remember its stunning landscapes for a long time, particularly the powerful and majestic ""Blackfoot River"" captured immaculately by the same cinematographer as Dangerous Liaisons. Montana must be a pretty state!
Robert Redford's voiceover narration in his silken voice is calm, allowing the poetry of Norman Maclean's written words to carry the emotion: ""Eventually, all things merge into one, and a river runs through it.""
What piqued my attention was its subtheme of the passion for a pursuit -- fly fishing in this case, which is an intrigue to me in itself. As the fishing lines flick and whisk over the whispering river, a low sun sheening the tree-lined horizon, the rhythm of image embraces imagination and meditation. We are close to understanding what Norman means when he says he is ""haunted by waters"".
By the time the film comes to its lyrically elegiac end, it has touched your heart and made you think. That is perhaps a good reason in and of itself to watch the movie.

21031,1,0767836359,"Here is Hollywood glamorati trying to make us believe in small town virtue so that we will applaude them for their touching heart rending acting. Its tripe and nothing more. There is nothing here that has anything to do with small towns; it is pure Hollywood.
  Not even the slightest attempt to portray a real small town. I mean ... an underground speak-easy club and a gambling club all in the same small rural Montana town.  Pleeeze give me a break. This isn't Chicago! There aren't enough people there to support that kind of sin infrastructure.
  The whole movie is so unrealistic, so contrived, so full of paltitudes - it is just leaves a bad taste in your mouth.
  Of course in our times it is lauded as a great tribute to rural America, but it is nothing of the sort. Brad baby never has a hair out of place. He is gorgeous in every shot, as is his brother and everyone in town. No dirt under their finger nails. The people who live in that type of town lack hair stylists and manicurists. They don't look like movie stars and don't act like brats from suburbia. The people in those towns are generally not good looking, they are slow, not to energetic and, well, strange. You'll see nothing resembling that in this glamorati vehicle.
  The whole moral is that even if you disgrace your family, even if you are a drunk, a blaggart, a loser, a gambler - you really are perfection if you can fly fish. Virtue reduced to fly fishing - so 90s, so now, so trendy of Hollywood's new love of high priced cabins in Montana and long retreats in the mountains. I may not be so virtuous, but I'm a helluva fly fisherman so that's what counts (substitute ""actor"" for ""fisherman"" and you have the formula for Hollywood virtue, i.e. I may be a miserable useless human being but they love me on the big screen).

21033,5,0767836359,"Once upon a time, Hollywood made ""films, "" and some of these films became the epitdome of art.  That talent has all but been forgotten in an era where imagination takes a back seat to the obvious.  There used to be a clamor for fine directors and actors who could convey the thoughts and feelings of an author or screenwriter without the use of nudity or foul language.  They used to make films without explosions and blood and gore.  And those films used to be AND still are better than most anything that Hollywood cranks out today.
Enter ""A River Runs Through It"" directed by Robert Redford.  This film is a quiet character study that has  brilliance in the acting and directing.  This is so apparent that you'll find your emotions welling up in you as you watch it.  It is such a delicately made film that you'll need to watch it multiple times to understand that the director and actors aren't going to spell out what you should be feeling.  They aren't going to speak every emotion they're having - you're going to have to surmise those for yourself.  This is so NOT like the films Hollywood makes today.  It's a subtle, beautiful film.
Brad Pitt may have made a mark in the public's collective memory when he appeared shirtless in ""Thelma and Louise"", but in ""A River Runs Through It"" he shows his chops and in doing so, let's us know he is an exceedingly talented actor not just a pretty boy.
Craig Sheffer (has the lead in this film and does a phenomenal job of giving us a young man living with the painful knowledge that he must forever live in the shadow of his younger brother, Paul (Pitt).  Though, Norman (Sheffer) is the reliable touchstone, Paul has a remarkable brightness of light that encompasses him.
Paul is the opposite of Norman emotionally, but they share a common familial bond and a love of fly fishing in the Missoula River.  They are able to work out their differences while they fish.  Theirs is a relationship that doesn't depend on words, but rather on understanding.
A River Runs Through It is not unlike the story of the prodigal child, nor is it too far removed to be able to be compared to Elia Kazan's ""East of Eden"".  It, too, was an intelligent film that didn't spell everything out for the viewer.
The story revolves around Norman and Paul as they grow up in Montana with their minister father and loving mother in the 1920's.  Montana, itself, is a character in this film, as Redford shows us its majesty and grandeur without making it feel like a travelogue.
At once, funny and poignant and heart rending, A River Runs Through It tells us the quiet story of the two brothers growing into manhood and getting on with their lives.  It doesn't have car crashes and there's no gratuitous nudity.  The script doesn't rely on the screenwriter having a hampered vocabulary, thus forcing him to use expletives instead of true dialogue.
No, A River Runs Through It depends on talent.  Talent from the book it was based on - talent from the screenwriter - talent from the director - and finally, talent from the fine cast of actors.
After watching this film, I doubt you'll be able to understand why it didn't take every award that Hollywood doles out.

When the credits start to roll I can almost feel the time warp, as I slowly begin to realize that I am back in my living room, having spent the last two hours in place the cinematographer has genuinely made come to life.  And the story is timeless just by itself.  It deals with family, roads we take in life, even love.  And it is so well told, with Robert Redford himself reading Norman MacLean's achingly beautiful prose throughout the film as narration, that you cannot help but identify with the characters and feel nostalgic about a simpler life in a simpler world.  If you have any doubts about this movie, rent it if you want.

21061,5,0767836359,"When this film was first released, some critics called it more a travel commercial for Montana than anything else, since it so lovingly handles the scenes of the family members involved in the sacrament of fly-fishing. For those of us who fell in love with the original novel celebrating the ways in which the fishing proclivities of these two brothers framed the outlines of a wonderful story about coming of age, and the tragedy of personal misdirection, this film adaptation by Robert Redford strikes a responsive chord. As he did in ""the Natural' and also in ""The Horse Whisperer"", Redford uses the staggering beauty of the natural environment to emphasize in boldface the ways in which each of us makes decisions as to how to conduct ourselves in ways that either foster our own development and growth, on the one hand, or to take a more sinister route, on the other.
Brad Pitt is perfectly cast here, in the first opportunity he had to show his amazing acting range as the brother hell-bent on doing things the hard and ultimately destructive way in stark contrast to his older brother, played well by Craig Sheffer, who seems more grounded, better oriented, and more likely to be able to carry out his dreams, which ultimately take him away from his beloved Montana. The story basically revolves around the ways in which the choices each makes based on their own needs, perceptions, and personality seals their fates. In this sense it is as much a morality play as a story about the ways in which love and involvement don't necessarily cure all ills.  Of course, it is also a story about the relationship each of the brothers has with their father, a minister who considers fishing more a religious activity than a sport. Yet Pitt's character, a natural fly-fisherman who casts like a dream, is unable to translate this particular form of genius into his own personal life to give him either peace or happiness.
It is a lovely film, a terrific period piece, and a lovingly directed bit of transformation of a superb novel to the silver screen. We see so many characteristic Redford touch that one really can watch the movie just for the fishing scenes and come away dazzled by the way he employs the camera in a way that catches the marvel of Montana so unforgettably. I love this film. Enjoy!",1033430400,9,2300,4.721393034825871
21062,4,0767836359,"Robert Redford's _A River Runs Through It_ is a movie based on the autobiographical novel by Norman MacLean.  The setting for this movie is the picteresque river country of Missoula, Montana.  The story is told through the eyes of Norman MacLean, who reflects on his life of love, schooling, hardship, and fishing.  Norm begins the story relaying the details of his father (Tom Skeritt), the minister and his quick-tempered younger brother Paul, played by Brad Pitt.  As the picture progresses Norm tells of how is life revolved around to things: God and fly fishing.  As Norm and Paul get older they split their ways.  Norm aims for a life of academics and teaching in the Northeast, and Paul becomes a newspaperman in Montana with a nasty habit for gambling, fighting, and drinking.  When Norm returns home after many years, he finds that things are no longer as he left them. It takes a reuniting with his father and brother and a new-found love to find out who he is and what he has lost.",1032825600,5,992,4.666666666666667

21067,5,0767836359,"I have seen all the films directed by Robert Redford and appreciated his love of the American people and the land.  In A River Runs Through It, Redford displays the lyric romanticism and visual splendor of the high Rocky Mountins of Montana as if he were a 19th century landscape painter of the ilk of Thomas Moran or Albert Bierstadt.  This film makes love to the visual and the word, with text by author Norman Maclean, and stunning camera work by Phillippe Rousselot (Serpent's Kiss, Reigne Margot).
Redford's cast is perfect.  Tom Skerritt is the Rev. MacLean, a man whose methods of education include fly fishing as well as the Bible, Brenda Blythen, the mother, and his sons, Craig Schaffer and Brad Pitt create a family whose interactions reflect the same problems all encounter with growing teenage sons, and later, complex young men.  Both Schaffer and Pitt are totally believable as the brothers whose love of fly fishing and each other will tie them together forever.  It is the relationships between men, father and sons, brothers, and their women to the outside world that grounds A River Runs Through It to a vein of storytelling that is missing in so many of Hollywood films produced in recent years.
What makes these relationships special however, is the attention Redford gives to the language as spoken in dialogue.  This is a literate script, beautiful to hear and unforgettable when coupled with the stunning Montana rivers and mountains.  The words and setting are equal to performances by a cast that rises to their material.  While the idea of fly fishing may seem an odd device to center a story, it is not so implausible in Redford's directorial hands.  Given the material, Redford's ode to a simpler time and life is worth revisiting again and again.  This treasure of a film should be included in every collection.",1004572800,17,1841,4.853035143769968

Oh, and there's some really pretty scenery and some fancy fishing.
To enjoy this movie, you have to be prepared to sit back, relax, and be receptive to a slow unfolding of the story's subleties. A little bit like the way people enjoy fishing, come to think of it.
The DVD version is great for maximizing the scenic aspect of the movie - this really requires the wide-screen format. Not too much in the way of bonus materials, though.",997401600,3,644,4.707964601769912

Redford's approach to Maclain's book is obviously adaptive to the screen, yet as you listen to the narration, the elements of prose and poetry merge with the scenes of the Montana landscape and early twentieth-century lifestyle, uncorrupted by contemporary technologies and their pollution.  the only reason i put this lower than five stars is that it is a DVD with little extras.  ...  nonetheless, i encourage all to watch, buy, and enjoy this masterpiece of storytelling.",983664000,5,814,4.897810218978102

Unlike so many books based on movies, they didn't change  the ending, the characters, the feel, or even many of the words. Instead,  the film makers only added to the story by setting it to the incredible  scenery MacLean was reduced to describing in words, and by a great job of  casting (no, Brad Pitt isn't just eye candy here).
Of course, staying  close to the original story wouldn't be any great bonus if the original  story weren't something special. MacLean managed to write prose redolent of  the mountains and streams of his past, creating something that's very much  a 'guy' story yet still curiously sensitive in its view of a thoughtful  young Norman and his wilder younger brother, in a family whose men bond  over their casting rods.
