3413937,5,B00189PSUY,"Funny and light-hearted, I love this series!!",1420329600,,45,5.571428571428571
3413938,5,B00189PSUY,"This, at least in the USA is a little known British comedy that I do not call seeing being rerun anywhere and it is really a very funny situational comedy!  Of course, Mollie Sudgeon is her incredible self and definitely makes the series, but the other actors do a great job of playing off of her!  Anyone enjoying other Brit comedies will enjoy this series as well!",1416355200,6,366,4.447761194029851
3413939,5,B00189PSUY,I watched this series when I lived in Canada and it first aired on BBC. Glad to finally see it available on DVD. Can't wait for it to get here.,1411084800,2,143,3.8

3413943,5,B00189PSUY,"As a Mollie Sugden fan, I was absolutely sure that I would like ""That's My Boy"". Boy did I! The world has lost a terrific actress in Mollie and I sincerely doubt that she can ever be replaced. She was, of course, just marvelous in ""Are You Being Served?"" and in ""Are You Being Served Again?"" The young couple who played her long-lost son and his wife I was not familiar with, but they were both very good too.
I have already recommended ""That's My Boy"" to my brother, who is also a fan of Mollie and I will also recommend it to my friends who like British comedies.",1397606400,14,565,4.192660550458716
3413944,4,B00189PSUY,"Ok, I will admit the first few episodes were a little weak.  We stuck in there and the episodes became much better.  By the time we got to seasons 4 and 5, I thought the episodes became quite good.  Throughout, there was no doubt that Molly Sudgen  was the star.  If you are a fan, you will appreciate her in this as well.",1397174400,15,322,4.0476190476190474
3413945,4,B00189PSUY,"Being a fan of Mollie Sugden thanks to her role as Mrs. Slocombe in Are You Being Served?, it was nice to be able to see another series she starred in and see her in a different setting than at work at Grace Brothers. And that's how I think of this series. I see Are You Being Served? as showing us her life while she's at work and That's My Boy as showing us her life while she's home, away from work. Use your imagination and you'll see it too. I really enjoy That's My Boy. Well done Mollie!",1510531200,2,494,4.0
3413946,3,B00189PSUY,This Britcom is okay....I keep comparing Mollie to Mrs. Slocombe in Are you being served....I like Mrs. Slocombe better.,1507939200,,120,5.368421052631579

3413953,5,B00189PSUY,Funny show.  I saw it while looking for something else and went ahead and purchased it.  The case was great and the story lines were well written.  I highly recommend this show.,1496188800,,177,4.46875

3413955,3,B00189PSUY,"I bought this because of Mollie but the writing is not as good as ""Are you being served"" it has some funny bites but kinda slow ...........
She is still a delight and I am glad I have it in my collection.",1480291200,,204,3.880952380952381

3413961,5,B00189PSUY,"Outrageous laughter on Mollie Sugden can provide.  I loved the collection, only wish it were longer, but will order ""Are You Being Served""  can never get enough of it, only wish John Inman's other collections were available in the states.",1461888000,,238,4.925
3413962,5,B00189PSUY,"I'm a die-hard Mollie Sugden fan, so it's hard to fault her. Christopher Blake, Deddie Davies, Clare Richards and Jennifer Lonsdale, too, are all products of the innocuous 70's-80's sit-com/Brit-com scripts. But, despite the two-dimensional, one-item story lines, (a product of the times) the actors pull off the dull scripts due to their talent, professionalism and experience. I saw them all on YouTube before buying the DVD's, but wanted the  clarity to watch them - and I have - over and over - in full resolution. As a British ex-pat, myself, you can't miss this slice of comedy history - especially without the gross verbiage and bodily function ""humour"" of almost all of today's new millennium sitcoms. I love them.",1461542400,4,722,5.016666666666667

3413966,5,B00189PSUY,"A light, refreshing and happy series with the lovable Molly Sugden as a mother who ""finds"" her son.  It's surprising that this series isn't more popular even today since Sugden was so talented and holds her own in all roles she played.  Delightful and reminiscent of ""older"" TV series.",1455408000,2,285,4.795918367346939
3413967,5,B00189PSUY,Great British humor!!!,1453939200,,22,6.666666666666667
3413968,5,B00189PSUY,"I love Mollie Sugden in ""Are you being Served."" Since I never had seen  this series I took a chance and was not disappointed. This is one of the funniest series I have seen and I have collected a lot of brit-com T.V. series. Mollie is fantastic in this series. that characters blend very well together, Mollie's character is great. She says the funniest things, and is very sarcastic to her son's other mother and the situations are interesting, funny and any of us could see ourselves in these situations and Mollie speaks her mind to all. I highly recommend this entire series and will watch it over and over. If you want a good laugh, and an ""Oh no she didn't"" yes she did you will love this ""That's My Boy."" a real must buy.  bob, Susanville, Ca.",1449705600,2,750,4.388489208633094

3413976,5,B00189PSUY,CD packaging was busted and they did not have new jewel cases to replace to keep the whole collection together like it came.  They did offer to send separate blank jewel cases but nothing that was like the original.  I was disappointed in that.  Otherwise the CD's worked as expected.  I was overall happy. Just not about the broken case.,1433376000,3,338,4.583333333333333
3413977,5,B00189PSUY,"A classic Mollie Sugden show! The first few episodes are rough, but once this series got it's groove, all five series are an awesome delight! It stands the test of time -- minus the hideous (but early 80's fashionable) outfits they made Jennifer Lonsdale wear. And who could resist show after show of dishy Christopher Blake in his skivvies. But it's Mollie who drives this show, along with top quality sidekicks. A must have for British sitcom lovers!",1431734400,9,452,4.8076923076923075

8268938,4,B00189PSUY,"Enjoyed watching the dynamics between a mother who gave her son up for adoption and her son & daughter-in-law after she gets a job as their housekeeper. Angie and Robert's marriage is also lovely to watch-- healthy and strong-- and it's so nice to see a quirky yet functional family on TV. A bit crude at times, but never in extremely poor taste. Found it to be a funny and loving show and would watch it all again in the future. Enjoyed each of the characters immensely and am super fond of the writing of their dynamics and how they grow together throughout the series.",1521936000,,571,4.447619047619048

8268940,4,B00189PSUY,"I think the first 2 seasons are fantastic, the third starts to lose some momentum and the last 2 are fairly okay but for the most part not really on par with the rest of the series. Mollie sugden is really the reason to watch though. In my opinion the 1st episode is on par with the funniest and most charming of the whole series so if you don't like that one, probably rethink sticking around for any more.",1521158400,,407,4.1645569620253164
