Its super slow, too much heavy music, and missing her humor.
Skip it, don't look back and don't worry that you might have missed something.",1396396800,,236,4.1521739130434785

She ventured out of her cloister after becoming an art expert,and has made a seies of videos. This one takes pace at Kings Chapel,cambridge,with REv. George Pattison as her guide,companion. The ancient stained glass tells the story of Christs Passion,with commentary from Rev Pattison and Sr. Wendy . This makes ideal lenten  viewing.
