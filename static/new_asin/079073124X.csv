88295,5,079073124X,"I just resent the other reviews that have one star.  The movie is not bad at all.  It is all action and suspense that makes it one of Arnold's best films.  That parachute jump from an airborne jet is a thrill of a ride.  But the struggle with an alligator is a fake scene but incredible visual  effects, though.  And Vanessa Williams?  I'm glad she did not sing in the  movie coz she can act.  The theme song which was sung by her at the end  credits is great.  Playing this movie in your DVD player is just the best  way to enjoy this movie because of the great sound quality.  5 stars for  the Eraser.",925862400,4,603,4.086206896551724
88316,2,079073124X,"Not one of the more quality Arnold movies.
Very Bad-Corny, at times.
(opposed to good-corny, of course)

I love the Arnold one-liners, but a lot of the action, inbetween major scenes, seems really phoned-in.
It was an entertaining movie about 2/3 of the way through, but the last 1/3 was just awful.

The Rail Gun technology was pretty cool, but they missed their shots the majority of the time, and they kept treating it like it was a firefight sort of weapon, which I think was a mistake.
This is one of those movies where, whenever anything happens, everything explodes.

An action movie is a lot more than just one explosion, and one-liner, after another.
The casting was kind of odd, by the way, and some of the bad guys seemed a little iffy.

The main guy they chose to play the bad-guy was kind of a dud, I think.
He just doesn't make much sense opposite Arnold.

He is definitely a cop-type actor, and he does the bad-guy-shtick okay, but I don't think he was a great choice for this role, and I think that detracted from the film in a pretty big way.
Anyways, if you haven't seen it, it might be worth a watch, but there are much better action movies of a similar vein, from Arnold, that would be more worth your time, such as ""True Lies"", for example.

P.S.
In reality, If one single Railgun existed, it would probably be the most powerful weapon on Earth, capable of assassinations with extreme precision, at great distance, and with great stealth.
One of many reasons it is dangerously approaching B-Movie status; and also kind of reminded me of ""Small Soldiers"", in a way. (haha)",1513728000,,1592,4.529616724738676

88625,4,079073124X,"Fast paced and intriguing Schwarzenegger vehicle that follows Arnold as a U. S. Marshall (in a role that thankfully wasn't offered to Tommy Lee Jones) who helps people ""disappear"" for the WITSEC and ends up getting involved with a senior executive (Williams) for a defense contractor who is not playing fair in the game of protecting the United States. Some unnecessary interjection of CGI effects almost spoils the taste of what is an otherwise very exciting action film, with one hair-raising sequence following another, with the prerequisite blood and violence thrown in for good measure. Schwarzenegger is very watchable here, and Vanessa Williams gives a rather underwritten role some credibility with her onscreen presence. So quickly paced and intense that one is willing (hopefully) to overlook the inconsistencies in its plot. James Caan is chilling, however, in the most villainous role he's played (in my opinion).
Stand under the light of ignorance too long and you will always be seen, but don't let anyone fool you: this is not a boring, glorified episode of ""Law and Order"", but like those who think of the original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" as a routine 'slasher film', those who see Arnold's name above the title might think it predictable, but in final analysis it is quite exciting and even surprising. No doubt the script doctoring of the multi-lingual, hyper-educated, and sensibly well read Walon Green helped strengthen the proceedings in this case. B-",1426636800,2,1475,5.175732217573222

88665,4,079073124X,"""Eraser"" is one of the last old school action movies that made it to the big screen, with a simple plot, visible violence, one-liners, and larger-than-life characters, but at the same time it was already using some of the modern tropes like CGI (the alligators are bad in a funny way, the railgun effect still look awesome and much better than in the Matrix)  and certain kind of clean-ness that defined the next decade of big action movies. Arnold needed a hit back then so they played it safe with some sort of rehash of the Terminator except that he plays a real human being (well, with skills like the Terminator but easier to hurt).

It doesn't have this special awesome-ness that made movies like Total Recall, Terminator, or even Commando, into classics of their genre but it is still a great send-off for One-Man-Army Arnold.",1420502400,,833,4.698630136986301

Pastorelli was always good. I miss that guy. And, in my opinion, Vanessa Williams is the most beautiful woman of all time.",1412121600,2,280,4.73469387755102
88700,5,079073124X,"While this is a typical Schwarzenegger, it is one of my favorite Arnold movies. The plot is believable, with only an occasional lifted eyebrow. Even though Arnold get shot, knifed, shot again, nothing slows him down. One scene gets him shot in the hand with a drill bit, next scene his hand is bandaged, the following scene everything is fine, the hand is healed and he has full use of it.  One of the lifted eyebrows moments.
Good cast surrounds him, which is always a plus. I don't want to go into too many details for fear of spoiling the movie for anyone who has not seen it. My recommendation is go get a copy and enjoy it. You will want to see it again",1408752000,2,658,4.264

88762,5,079073124X,"If you enjoy action/thriller movies with Arnold you will want to see this film. He plays an agent for witness protection assigned to protect a whistle blower. A nice tie in with the main story from a previous person he saved. Plenty of action keeps it moving at a good pace. Good story, directing, casting, acting, and music.  I like the fact it has a touch of humor as well. To bad that Arnold didn't do more with this character in sequels.  Would still love to see him team up with Tommy Lee Jones in something along lines of Witness Protection or Marshal service.  Morton Downy Jr. and/or Johnny Depp would be good additions.

The action is incredible, Arnold is awesome, the film is fast and funny, and it brings back good memories of a time when big blockbusters often took themselves less seriously and just had fun.  I miss those days but I'm glad I was raised on a good diet of the movies that came out then.  I'm glad Arnold's back but this one definitely was part of a golden era from when he seemed to be the number one movie star and each movie he did was eagerly awaited by all fans of adventure films.",1380067200,,569,4.154545454545454

It's a movie about Arnold Schwarzengger and that's all you need to know, so rent it and watch it just like I did! I used to own this movie on VHS but come on my VHS tapes are long gone now and I haven't really bought every single DVD movie to replace my precious Arnold Schwarzengger VHS tapes BUT one day there will be the ULTIMATE ARNOLD SCHWARZENGGER BIBLE COLLECTION! This will pretty much have every single movie that Arnold has appeared and it will sell for a low, low, low price of $9,999 dollars!

88862,4,079073124X,"Whatever else one may think about the Schwarzenegger Machine, it made pictures which had a lasting appeal to those who like action without gore or reality.  I just watched this film, 16 years after it was released, and it is as much fun to watch now as it must have been (going by the reviews) when it was young and fresh. It takes real skill to be able to wipe out platoons of men, blow up everything in sight, have the hero riven by steel spikes, battered, bruised and half-dead, and yet not give anyone nightmares, shudders,  or the remotest feeling of  unease; in fact, to give people only the satisfaction of Good Triumphing Over Evil, while all in the cause of a good time had by all. If you haven't yet seen this picture, just imagine a guy falling  out of a plane some minutes after his parachute did, the parachute is way below him, the plane above him, and then.................well, I can't say, but when it is Arnold involved, anything goes, anything is credible.
At any rate, you get the idea. The idea is to give the audience a bit of a thrill, a bit of suspense as to the outcome, and lots of fun; to my way of thinking the goal was accomplished in this movie",1375401600,2,1174,4.34703196347032

One reviewer suggested it as a movie that can be watched with kids. Well, someone puts a gun in his mouth and blows his head away. That is not something I would show kids. And there are plenty of other very violent events in the movie. Aside from that, even though it was made in 1996, its special effects are still inspiring and there are some surprises and comic moments. And Arnold is very Arnold.",1364860800,,653,4.637931034482759

Kruger works for the Federal Witness Protection Program (WitSec). His next assignment is to protect Lee Cullen (Vanessa L. Williams), a senior executive at a firm (Cyrex) that manufactures equipment for the military. Cullen discovers that her company is planning to sell sophisticated equipment to Russia, so copies her evidence onto computer discs to give to the FBI. The man giving Kruger his assignments is Chief Arthur Beller (James Coburn) but his immediate superior in the field is U.S. Marshal Robert DeGuerin (James Caan). Cullen's boss at Cyrex is William Donohoe (James Cromwell), who is happy to sell arms to the highest bidder, though his role in the film is short-lived. As might be expected, there's some sophisticated weaponry in use her on both sides. As a security measure, Cullen copies the disc and gets in touch with a reporter on the Washington Herald, Claire Isaacs (Roma Maffia). Leading the search for Cullen in order to eliminate her is the Under-Secretary for Defense, Daniel Harper (Andy Romano). An added complication is that there is a `mole' or two within WitSec who is eliminating the very witnesses they are supposed to be protecting.

Like most Arnold Schwarzenegger movies this one is a high action and suspense filled story.

But, one of the best parts of the film is the performance of the late Robert Pastorelli (The painter on the old Murphy Brown TV show). He plays a mobster that was rescued by Arnold's character and he helps him with the recovery of the super guns. An underrated actor-it's a shame. If you like action/adventure, this will fit the bill.

89009,4,079073124X,"The 2-year gap between True Lies and Eraser forced some action fans into thinking that Big Arn had retired. He had delivered at least one action movie per year since Terminator. Eraser had an awesome trailer, to the tune of Enigma's wonderful ""I Love You, I'll Kill You"", that rocked my world in the summer of 1996. I saw virtually every blockbuster that year, and the Eraser trailer was attached to every one of them. It came out out in the UK in the very last week of summer (and my first week back at school). I saw it at the now demolished UCI cinema in Edinburgh with a sold-out audience, mostly filled with guys out for a ""lad's night"". The movie was rated 18, and even though I was 3 years below that mark, I still got in, which was fortunate since the cinema version is the only uncut version of the film that has ever been released in the UK. For its VHS and DVD release the mad BBFC saw fit to cut 4 minutes from Eraser, turning it into an incomprehensible mess. It capped-off an awesome summer season (or so my 15-year-old self thought), and put to rest any fears that Big Arn was slowing down (although he has only made 5 action movies, to date, since then).

Arn is John Kruger (an amusing choice of name since director Chuck Russell also made the 3rd Nightmare on Elm Street Movie), a Witness Protection Program Agent who is tasked with 'erasing' and protecting a high-level informant who can prove that there are traitors within the US government who are selling weapons to Russian terrorists. Naturally the informant is the lovely, and wide-eyed, Vanessa Williams, who involves herself in a subdued romantic subplot with Kruger. James Caan and the always great James Coburn provide respectable support as Kruger's antagonist and mentor, but the best support is no doubt Robert Pastorelli (an actor who I really liked who died of a heroin overdose in 2004), who plays a previous witness who is eager to please Kruger in his latest, impossible quest.

Overall, it's hardly revolutionary, but what makes Eraser stand out from the crowd is the utterly breathtaking (literally) scene in which Kruger escapes a jet, mid-flight, without the comfort of a parachute on his shoulders. It's definitely one of the best action scenes in the last 20 years and, let me tell you, when that scene climaxed in the cinema, the packed audience of 'lads' totally sucked the air out of the auditorium. A massively exciting, and completely exhilarating, scene that never fails to get your heart racing.

Alan Silvestri's score is one of the film's more underrated features. Silvestri scored Big Arn's Predator, a famous score in its own right, and while Eraser is not as famous as Predator you should not rule out the integrity of the score. When separated from the movie it is still one of Silvestri's best efforts.

I guess the only complaint I could have about Eraser is that it's kinda anti-climatic. The best scene occurs at the end of the second act, leaving the final act pale in comparison. There's no iconic imagery to the film and it seems kinda forgettable when compared to other Arn characters who have endured the test of time. Nonetheless, it's at the top of the bottom of Arn's best movies, but make sure the version you watch has not been butchered by the BBFC.

The Blu Ray is in 2.40:1 1080p with Dolby TrueHD sound. Extras are non-existent.",1336348800,10,3352,4.655405405405405
89010,5,079073124X,"Maybe because it came near the end of his time as a legitimate superstar, this film never received the recognition it deserves.  It did decent business at the box office, but given its budget, I'm not sure whether it fully covered its production costs.  At any rate, I think it is Arnold's best film.  The plot is good, the action is terrific -- the scene on the plane with James Caan is worth the price by itself -- and Arnold delivers his usual high-energy performance.  The co-stars, Venessa Williams and James Caan, are also very good.  Is it a better movie than the Terminator films?  Well, to my mind the first Terminator film is the best, but Arnold is not really being Arnold in that one -- if you know what I mean; he is just stalking and killing.  I would rank this film above the later Terminator films, so in that sense I think it actually is Arnold's best film.

One other note:  Although the film is rated R, I think that must have been a close call even in 1996.  Today, I think it would certainly be rated PG-13.  So, if you haven't seen this one before, you are in for a treat especially given how cheap the DVD is.",1336262400,,1132,4.2924528301886795

89022,5,079073124X,"I saw Eraser with Dada at Mayfare Cinema. Since then it has closed down but remain alive in Lucknowites memory as the most nicest Cinema,really classy. When you stroll along its corridor you see beautiful Pictures of Hollywood and Indian stars including Elvis Presley. It had relatively smaller screen compared to adjacent Basant Cinema which too closed down soon after..Mayfare's sound system was really good. It had no Balcony but instead the back seats were boxed of labeling them as Balcony. Ticket checkers were quite no nonsense type hooligans were made to behave contrary to other halls which were not very strict about audience's unruly behaviour. The first movie I saw their was ""Hum se hai Muqabla"" dubbed version of Kadhalan (1994) *ind Nagma,Girish Karnad and Prabhu Deva. The last movie I saw their was Star Wars.

I remember when I saw Eraser I was completely blown away by it. It was so thrilling and such pulsating action absolutely fabulous.

Recently I again saw it one month after seeing Desperate Housewives 7 th Season which starred Vanessa Williams too. Now I had completely forgotten she was their in Eraser. Found her extremely beautiful their,quite elegant with beautiful mesmerizing eyes. Her role too was quite strong in fact the  whole movie revolved around her. Movie also starred Oscar winning veteran actor James Coburn.

Arnold Schwarzenegger was really mind blowing here. Love this movie don't remember any movie that comes close to it where the story is concerned or charismatic on screen presence or pure entertainment value,best action flick.",1327968000,,1578,5.128404669260701

Arnold Schwarzenegger, James Caan and Vanessa Williams give a power jolt to a terrific. The only scene I have a problem with is the gay bar scene. I personally don't think the scene was neccessary, and could/should have been changed to something less uncomfortable (the Third Book Of Moses, Called Leviticus 20:13 says that ""Whosoever lieth with a man as with womankind hath committed an abomination, they shall surely be put to death""). Let me make myself clear: I think that that life-style is absolutely abominable and immoral. Though I admit, I like the song ""It's Raining Men"" that played during the scene.

And a special appearance by a scaled-down battleships cannon which only Arnie can use properly, of course. There is a plot in there somewhere, but thats not why you get a Arnie movie is it?

89030,5,079073124X,"I thought this was a cool movie when I was in middle school. When I revisited the film as an adult, I realized how terrible and unintentionally funny it is - especially 15 years after the fact. I gave it five stars, because it is gloriously cheesy. It is, in my opinion, all of the over-the-top elements of Schwarzenegger's film career bundled up into one movie.

My friend and I were compelled to make a downloadable ""iriff"" for the film - a running commentary that offers jokes throughout the whole thing (you can find it at the Rifftrax website).

Eraser has plenty of the usual fare for a 90s action flick: crazy villains, an annoying female lead, a specialized government agency full of corrupt employees, a bad guy with a scar on his face, henchmen who either refuse to shoot or insist on missing, and a climax at (drumroll please) THE DOCKS!

Eraser also breaks new ground. Ah-nuld is forced to do battle with CGI alligators, drag queens, and gravity itself. (Okay, he doesn't actually fight the drag queens. But I think he should have.)

Along the way, Arnold teaches us some valuable lessons. Lesson 1: Don't put someone else's butt on the line just to make your own job a little easier. Lesson 2: Who you really are is on the inside, and no one can take that from you. Lesson 3: When things are at their absolute worst, you can always count on the mob.

Did I mention that the CGI alligators in this movie roar like lions? That alone would merit the five star rating, but thankfully it is just one of the many qualities that make this a timeless classic.",1292025600,,1564,4.492957746478873

89062,2,079073124X,"In brief and put simply swapping to the Blu-ray version of THE ERASER was a complete waste of money and it is only because had we not given away our DVD copy to a friend we would have put the BR version back on the market!!!.
Why:?
The Picture and The Sound.
Firstly the picture:
We watch any DVD or Blu-ray(BR)item on a budget priced DLP projector and we do not make any apologies for what we see as our brain comprehends what we are viewing and so the techo's could say rightly ""well you won't get a good Blu-ray picture on that thing""! Perhaps they are right but! hear us out.

When one does view a good BR disc (say any of James Bond BR's or SAHARA or VAN HELSING or THE THING or TERMINATOR SALVATION or I-ROBOT or ERAGON for example) the beads of sweat to hair follicles to facial lines do show up even on our projector. Even previous DVDs when compared to the BR version are noticeably clearer, sharper, more colour and better blacks.
In fact we have concluded using a budget price projector as we have is an ideal way of checking out a Blu-ray transfer as it is more evident to our brain if either poor master print was used or good transfer was carried out and as such any DNR or EE may be noticeable quicker to our brain. We don't know but whenever we see a good BR which has a good review on our projector we cannot but agree with the reviewers point of view not really understanding why as we are not techo'. Our brain does it for us we guess.

The Sound:
We state up front first we are not advocates of DD-TueHD sound but have never been disappointed with any DTS codec either on DVD or BR's (yet that is) and feel the movie companies put the soundtrack of many, many, many so-called BR sound transfers into some form of computer program which transfers the sound from DD to either a genuine DD-TrueHD or a fudged DD-TRUE HD to suit their purposes and for this picture (like a few we have heard)the conversion doesn't work for us. So stick with your DVD copy of this movie if you are looking to hear a BR experience.

Summary:
This picture is one of these anomalies as is COLLATERAL DAMAGE another. The original DVD's were in Dolby Digita (DD) 5.1 and like COLLATERAL DAMAGE sounds no different in BR. The assumption is anything in BR should be better and it is time many buyers realised this is not so. Many supposedly transferred sounds into DD-True HD are not succesfull and that is the truth.
That is what our ears (brain again)tells us any way and yet there are many good transfers from DD to DD-TRUE HD out there too! Such as the BLADERUNNER and 300 are good transfers to our ears.
However because of our AVR's sound codex switched to hear DTS-HD Master Audio we like what we hear from any BR disc which has been done in this format. Especially THE GOLDEN COMPASS which also takes sound to yet another level by being encoded in 7.1 channels as well as DTS-HD Master Audio too.

Conclusion
This is our first review ever for any organisation and please note our comments have nothing to do with the story line, the actor's ability or date of the actors likableness it has to with the two major reasons we buy BR's and that is BR is supposed to give us improved PICTURE and SOUND. We suggest and this is proven by a number of reviews out there to not be the truth meaning we are not getting this from the movie companies. Not yet but we should!!!!.

If this picture came out in DTS-HD Master Audio it would be a good beginning but the picture transfer needs to be worked on.
We feel all the movie companies know what is happening, they don't care and they only care for one thing and we all know what that is. THE $.!!!

Even in my country when USA and the UK were experiencing DTS on DVD's our stores were being stocked in mostly DD and rarely saw a DTS DVD and had to go overseas  to purchase and sought multi region players to compensate.
Indeed here we cannot readly purchase a multi zoned BT player yet and the main player SONY would not come to the party and multi zone my new SONY player even though they sold them overseas. Strange but is not SONY a MOVIE COMPANY!!!! It is simply not in their sales interest to offer multi zoned BR's it would cost them in BR sales wouldn't it!!

Even with BR in the US and UK you can buy for example TRANSPORTER 3 recorded with soundtrack DTS-HD Master Audio however we see it on our shelves here only recorded in DD-TRUE HD.
The movie companies look for widest diversity they can hence REGIONS and ZONES were introduced and when the US and others wake up to it we are all being deceived for one real reason and as a result there is no real freedom of choice - things need to heat up for the very hungry movie companies.

Having read the review of GLADIATOR SAPHIRE Edition and being guided by the reviewers NOT to buy this item we decided to play a part in forums and offer this review too.
Hope you all like our review

89063,4,079073124X,"This film has suspense and action played out by John alias Arnold. He is with the witness protection program and he works alone. He does his job well and comes across as a man without alot of words but one who seems to care about those who cross his path in his line of work. He takes on a witness for a corporation that deals with intricate weaponry. This character is played by Vanessa, she comes across as a strong woman who is trying to get information for the fbi. She isn't prepared for the type of assault that comes from the force of criminal activity. Luckily, John is there to help her, he takes her out of harms way after they try to kill her in her house. It doesn't show much in the way of emotions, sadness, love affair, but the story line is good. John's boss is involved in a double cross with the government and the company under surveillance. His boss and others are selling weapons not accounted for to terrorist groups heightening their accesibility to more powerful technology. I liked to watch how John worked in his field of government. Parachuting seems fun but pretty frightening, which was one of the action sequences in the film. The suspense in obtaining secret info seems like an adventurous job yet its not a game, a risk of life or death. The ability to protect someone against extreme danger would be a scary prospect. The film does and it doesn't take life as valuable. What I mean is that when her male friend dies she doesn't seem to grieve. Even the bad guys get plowed by a train. Yet it does take it seriously because it is a job which saves a person's life. An action film that has the strength of an interesting plot.

Vanessa Williams stumbles into harm's way and becomes Schwarzenegger's ward. The two form an uneasy partnership and manage to stay one jump ahead of the heavies for the remainder of the film. There are plenty of over-the-top action sequences, wild chases and bad guys that make it fun to root against them and explosive CGI effects for the more implausible scenes.

 The picture quality i think is quite good. The special effects hold up well,especially the guns, even Arnold's airplane exit looks good,the crocodiles look well too,except when Arnold shoots one in the head,but still a lot better than some effects today. There are probably a few places where there is some fuzz but not that you'd notice unless you went out of your way.
  The sound is good,great bass and even dialogue. No extra's just like my dvd copy!
The film itself is good,a couple of parts between Arnold and James Caan were a bit over done,dialogue wise. The actings fine,the late Robert Pastorelli is quite good in his role(he was great in Murphy Brown).

Arnold works for the witness protection program.  Part-time assassin and he's all heart.  If a witness screws up and get themselves in a jam, Arnie ""eliminates"" the troublemakers who were trying to put away his witnesses and ""erases"" the witness with a new identity and location.

The plot starts rolling when Arnie's boss tells him of a witness who is a whistleblower for the military defense company she works for.  She gets wired by the FBI and at this point you don't know who to trust.  Vanessa Williams plays the witness, Ms. Cullen, who gets herself involved in a government cover-up.  Unfortunately involved in the cover-up also includes the Undersecretary of Defense of the USA, and Arnold's boss, who is killing his own witnesses as a cover-up to get Arnold to reveal the whereabouts of Ms. Cullen.

Interesting if convoluted plot as you sit through two hours of intrigue, unintentional comedy, interspersed with murder, lies and traitors.

Arnold plays a tough, no-nonsense kinda guy, no one gets in his way, working through various life-threatening situations.  Vanessa's acting is a bit overdone; the former Miss America's try at stardom may be on the decline with this film.

Mindless, non-stop action, impossible physical feats, and despite being shot, stabbed and thrown out of an airplane, Arnold wins at the end.  Whew!

Rated R for the mature boys in your town.

89112,5,079073124X,"I have been a fan of Arnold's movies from his Conan days. Yes, as cheesy as they are I still like them. Eraser starts off fast paces and picks up from there. While Arnold is the star of the movie, Vanessa Williams is a star in her own right and made her character believable. I especially like her scene in the zoo. Cornered by a rogue agent who tells her he is working with John (Arnold) she asks him for the secret handshake. While the man is trying to figure out what she's talking about she shoots him in the thigh with the gun concealed in her purse.

This is one of the movies I can watch over and over.

This film is fine to pass the time, but there is no reason to buy it or savor it.  Recommended tepidly.  While it is too bad that I no longer enjoy this kind of mindless action film, I guess there are better things to do with my time.

89116,4,079073124X,"A dozen years ago, this Arnold Schwarzenegger action flick was fairly hot stuff but I wonder if it would have the impact today since special effects continue to be so much better and we've seen so many of these type of action stories in the past 12 years?

One of Arnold's keys to his successful career in films was simply that his movies were entertaining, and that's why people come to the theaters. High-brow national critics often forget that. ""Eraser"" is a prime example. Entertainment alone is how this particular movie survives since common logic doesn't exist here and violence and profanity are overdone. But, despite it's low-brow tastes and stupidity, it's still generally fun to watch if you can put your brain on hold for two hours. It's also fun to hear, too, if you have a nice surround system.

This movie has one of the most outrageous action scenes I've ever seen on film, even to this day: one in which Arnold hangs from the outside of a jet airplane, finally lets go, free-falls to catch his parachute that had been ripped off, and then has to worry about the jet plane which had circled around and was going to smash him!!

The audio came into play nicely each time the super rifle that was featured in the movie was shot. Vanessa Williams plays the female lead satisfactorily and James Caan is very effective as the villain. Robert Pastorelli and James Coburn also add to the fun. A few laughs along the way help this no-brainer to become even more entertaining.",1234224000,,1484,4.634980988593156

Audio track isn't as agressive as we can hear in newer productions but the action sounds vibrant enough to feel the movie.

The low point is obvious: there's no extra content. Well, most of us like to dig a little inside the production, so this issue it's disappointing but, overall, the more important thing is the movie and Warner did their homework right with that.

89136,3,079073124X,"There's just something about Arnie movies that always grabs me, and makes me want to watch them. I've seen a few that definitely haven't been my favourites, and Eraser is one of them. I feel the more that I see films of Arnie's that I haven't seen before, the more I love the ones I've seen loads of times - Terminator, Twins, True Lies etc.

The storyline is in no means OTT. It doesn't have the intriguing aspect of Total Recall for example. Arnie plays John Kruger, who specialises in 'erasing' people in the Witness Protection Programme. The film opens showing exactly how he does this, which is quite interesting.

But then Vannessa Williams (Lee Cullen) comes into it, and really, she just didn't work. There was no chemistry between her and Arnie whatsoever. I don't particularly want them to start ripping each other's clothes off, but there was nothing between them at all. And in my opinion, it's always off-putting when that happens.

The story then continues with John trying to keep Lee out of danger, and keep himself out of danger himself. There's one totally ridiculous scene, where John is hanging from a plane door, about to directly fall into the path of the plane engine, which just so happens to be on fire! His parachute then gets ripped off, and he has to free fall after it, and also has to worry about the plane preferably not crashing into him. It's a totally unbelievable scene, and definitely the highlight of the movie. But better done in Point Break I have to say. The alligator scenes also had me barely breathing, as they were amazing!

I just don't think Eraser holds up with some of Arnie's other movies. The last movie I saw was Total Recall, and while I didn't understand it, and it left me racking what little brains I have, I still remember most of it. Eraser just comes across as a throw away movie, which is forgettable, and not that special up against his other movies.",1220486400,,1910,4.592375366568915

The Eraser starring Arnold The Eraser  DVD

The Eraser starring Arnold Swarzzennegger and  James Caan is one of my favorite movies.  Arnold plays John  Kruger who is specializes in ""erasing"" people's identities, in this case Vanessa Williams plays  a FBI whistleblower that is going to testify against a very important person and Arnold must protect her from assassination.
The plot is relatively simple, in fact, you will be likely to pick up on the ""secret"" early on in the film. But the action is non-stop,).  There are a lot of explosions, especially of vehicles blowing sky-high but hey, we have to give the special effects guys something to do, and the secret weapon's effect is also pretty cool. Vanessa Williams underplays her role as FBI whistleblower, and James Caan is just superb as the heavy. The surprise fun came from the Wise Guys, who pay some debts in the plot. They were amusing and added a bit of fun to the action.
I found the suspense pleasantly gripping, and if it wasn't the smartest film on the block, it sure was plenty of entertainment.

Recommended for Arnold fans and fans of action movies.

Arnold Schwarzenegger, Vanessa Williams (who is simply GORGEOUS!!!), Robert Pastorelli (whose character comes close to stealing the show), James Caan, James Coburn, Joe Viterelli, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few thrills.
A bit more ""exposure"" from Vanessa Williams and the film would be a solid 5!

89155,4,079073124X,"I found ""Eraser"" in a local budget bin & remembered it fondly.  As John Kruger, Arnold Schwarzenegger is the type of hero we like to watch.  Always the good guy, he's not afraid of bashing a few heads, shooting the bad guys or jumping out of a plane without his parachute.  Vanessa Williams, who's now the nemesis on the ""Ugly Betty"" TV series, does a good job as computer analyst Lee Cullen trying to do the right thing.  James Caan who got panned for his performance as Agent Robert Deguerin seems like he could be a good guy for the first few scenes.  The late James Cockburn as the agency head Beller flies above in planes and seems to be on the side of the good guys.  Roma Mafia does a nice cameo as the reporter that Lee phones.  Then of course we hear how the reporter was killed.  If you look closely, you can see Camryn Manheim (formerly from TV's ""The Practice"" & now on ""Ghost Whisperer"") as a nurse.  Charles Russell who had directed Jim Carey in ""The Mask"" does a good job of keeping the pacing popping.  We're never far from the next explosion.  Arnold's wrestling match with a crocodile may be the highlight of the film.  This is a high-energy action film that puts your brain in neutral and pleasures you with thrills & spills.  It plays well 10 years after its initial release.  Enjoy!",1172707200,,1303,4.397489539748954

89157,5,079073124X,"What can I say? Arnold has done it again with his latest film, ""Eraser"".

He plays Witness Protection Program employee John Kruger, in charge of ""erasing"" people's identities in order to protect them. This time his charge is Lee Cullen (Williams), a woman who knows too much about the dirty dealings at a weapons corporation.

There's not really much more you can say about the plot. And I don't think anyone who goes to see Schwarzennegar films really cares. There was a director who once said to Roger Ebert that in order for a movie to be great, it has to have at least three good scenes and no bad scenes. And in Ebert's review, he said, ""This movie has four good scenes and no bad scenes."" And I would have to agree with him on that point.

Despite the probably many impossibilities in this film, such as the cannon-guns used by the bad guys, this movie kept my attention throughout. The one-liners (Arnold's trademark) were fast and funny, the action was the best of any Schwarzennegar film in history, and Pastorelli was great as the Mafioso- witness who was helped by Schwarzennegar in the beginning of the film, providing even more comic relief. If I wasn't cheering, I was laughing. And that's what an action movie should be.",1156550400,5,1235,4.63013698630137

89159,4,079073124X,"Eraser is Arnie's last wholly enjoyable actioner before the rot set in. Overshadowed at the time by The Rock, it's a much better proposition by far. Co-written by Wild Bunch scribe Walon Green and co-starring Peckinpah regular James Coburn, it's full of subtle and not so subtle Sam Peckinpah references in general and The Killer Elite in particular - not only does that film's star, James Caan, play the Robert Duvall role this time round, but after the film's dockyard bust-up he even ends the film walking with a cane again. Fortunately, unlike Peckinpah's laziest film, the action scenes here are handled with a gusto and energy by director Chuck Russell that both embraces and excuses their absurdity, whether it be Arnie playing chicken with a jet while hanging from a parachute or taking on a reptile house full of killers and escaped alligators (""You're luggage!""). And if you like Alan Silvestri's score, you can hear it again in Judge Dredd!

89180,4,079073124X,"You're probably thinking that this is your typical Schwarzennegar vehicle, but ""Eraser"" is actually more fun than that. It's not spectacular, but then it doesn't overload you and overwhelm its thin story with a lot of expensive pyrotechnics, and best of all, it doesn't make you feel like an utter idiot for buying into its rapid-fire nonsense.

The Plot: our hero is John Krueger (which is easier to spell), a lone-wolf commando who handles high-risk participants in the Justice Department's witness protection program. He creates phony identities and lives for people who risked their lives by testifying for the government. When necessary (which proves often), he also stages brutal but effectively believable deaths for the witnesses themselves - anything to throw off the trail of their hunters. (We learn this watching Kruger take out a pair of hitmen sent to rub out a mob-informer played by the late Bob Pastorelli, better known as Murphy Brown's house painter.) He's so good erasing the lives of witnesses and their hunters that he's even known as...okay, you've probably figured out that part by now. ""Eraser"" kicks off when Kruger's latest charge is Lee (Vanessa Williams), a beautiful and brilliant programmer who can implicate her boss in a complex though clearly illegal arms deal. Cyrez, the defense contractor she works for, took billions in tax-dollars to develop rail-gun technology it openly declared impossible. (Rail-guns use electromagnetism to fire projectiles at near-light speeds and capable of punching holes in battleships). Lee stumbles onto evidence that Cyrez not only worked the bugs out, creating a handier version of the impossible weapon, but is now on the verge of selling a shipload of their guns to a thoroughly vile Russian arms dealer. Unlike the wiseguys Kruger normally deals with, Cyrez has enough at stake to pay for powerful friends, even some who work for John.

""Eraser"" so faithfully follows the rules of action-thrillers, that it cheerfully surprises you with its lack of surprise. Will there be strings of lop-sided gun battles? Of course. Will our hero narrowly survive in various impossible to believe stunts (a free-fall from 10,000 feet, after being near-rammed by a 727)? Natch! Will the bad guys and other enemies suffer murderous one-liners? You bet! (""You're luggage"" Kruger tells a wanton alligator during a shoot-out improbably set at NYC's Central Park Zoo). ""Eraser"" also throws in some good supporting players - especially Pastorelli, but James Caan as his mentor, Williams who holds her own as the damsel in not-so-much distress, and also Pastorelli's shady associates of the Baltimore docks (""Don't make me hurt you, Mikey!""). ""Eraser"" is perfect when you need something to help you decompress. I caught this blast-fest after taking the '96 NYS Bar exam, and it (almost) erased the previous two tension-filled months.",1117065600,,2881,5.233766233766234

89192,3,079073124X,"Eraser features Arnold Schwarzenegger as a government operative who makes witnesses disappear or get ""Erased"" Unfortunately the only thing that needed to be ""Erased"" was the second half of the screenplay. Eraser devolves from an intriguing story about witness protection into a by the numbers action movie not worthy of Mr. Schwarzenegger's limited talents.  This film belongs in the category of ""Lesser Schwarzenegger, films those mediocre movies made after ""True Lies"" and before ""Last action Hero""

I can't fault Arnold here. He plays his part of Jack the ""Eraser"" very well. The action in the opening scenes is tight. But Eraser's problems all come from the dull, by the numbers screenplay. It's so by-the predictable you have the whole movie figured out by the opening credits. The guy's name is Jack like every other action hero. He's a government agent. He's got to protect the pretty female who knows something that the bad guys don't want told. One of the guys Jack works with is a Rogue agent. Jack will spend the film trying to figure out who he is even though we knew a half hour ago. There will be explosions, deaths, and the top bad guy will get his in the end in a memorable fashion after Ah-nold spouts a clich we're all supposed to remember.

There are some bright spots in this formulaic movie though. Vanessa Williams gives a solid performance as the witness Schwarzenegger is supposed to protect. She plays her part with intelligence and sophistication, making more out of her character than what was on the page. The former Miss America holds her own with Schwarzenegger, having great chemistry with him in all her scenes and keeps the film from falling apart. Robert Pastorelli from ""Murphy Brown"" is fun to watch as a mobster indebted to Jack. James Caan is well, James Caan. He's playing what he plays in most every movie he's in lately, the veteran government agent whose gone rogue. He's going to meet his in the end.

89195,5,079073124X,"Austrian accented ""Terminator"" actor Arnold Schwarzenegger hits another home run in his career in the 1996 action thriller entitled ""Eraser"" and let me tell you, this movie is truly unsettling and not to mention will make you angry as such acts could in fact happen in real life as we know it although the items are a bit far-fetched with today's technologies.
 A special agent U.S. Marshall named John Kruger works for the Witness Protection Agency, an organization that takes witnesses of major crimes away, wipe out their identities, in order to shelter them from potential criminals who aim to kill those who witness their crimes. His latest mission is to protect a worker named Lee Cullen (Vanessa Williams) who works for a corporation named Cyrez that produces top secret weapons but a massive scandal is brewing and Lee discovers what's really going on and aims to expose the scam to the FBI. However, high level government marshals who are crooks themselves aim to kill Lee and Kruger to attempt to stop the truth from coming out. The Cyrez corporation, under the leadership of a corrupt CEO, is involved in an illegal arms deal with a Russian Mafia hitman who has had a history of murder and terrorist acts against civilians. The arms deal involves trading extremely advanced weapons that don't use any conventional ammunition and instead use magnetic pulses to fire rounds of aluminum at nearly the speed of light and if the arms trade succeed it will bring forth a horrific new era of high-tech terrorism worldwide and John Kruger must stop the arms shipment before it's too late while also protecting lee from corrupt high-ranking officials participating the scam.
 If Lee Cullen and John Kruger are killed, then the FBI will lose any leads and/or evidence to bring the Cyrez officials to trial and to expose the scandal to the public.
 This movie sometimes makes me angry not because it is bad because it is a really great movie but it's the whole concept of high-ranking government officials actually being a part of the problem than as the people trying to fight the criminals committing these crimes. I sometimes wonder how one can be able to fight such acts of capitalist greed even if they're totally fictional events.
 The special effects while limited are really well done especially with the way the bullets create those smoke trails when speed through the air at speeds nearly that of light plus the action sequences are really awesome especially towards the climax.
 The high-tech weapons are really terrifying with not only the light-speed ammunition but also how they seemingly can scan through buildings and make out movements all around the immediate vicinity. One can't help but feel really paranoid when viewing the scenes where they scan the area when seeking their targets.
 Once again Arnold Schwarzenegger hits another home run right out of the ballpart playing the U.S. Marshall John Kruger. Arnold's action sequences are once again in top form as he fights against the crooks aiming to eliminate both Kruger and Lee. If you loves his ""I'll Be Back"" and/or ""You've just been terminated"" lines from the ""Terminator"" movies, then he comes up with another brilliant line which is ""You've just been erased"". God I love it. Vanessa Williams is also very good playing Lee Cullen as she tries to escape the assassins pursuit of her while trying to deliver the evidence of the crime to the FBI. In all honesty, Vanessa is far better when she's acting in movies and singing and releasing albums as opposed to wasting her time on these numerous bland commercials and infomercials!!
My favorite though of the main characters was Star Trek actor James Caan. Man, his portrayal of the traitorous agent Degeurin is absolutely terrifying and truly vivid and brings the horrifically callous nature of the corrupt agent to `life' on the movie. I just can't help but feel really sometimes ticked off at Deguerin because of his horrific acts against the country!
 Other favorites are the late Joe Pastorelli as Johnny C. along with his mob crime family and some of the characters are really funny especially Johnny C. It's really sad that Pastorelli departed us so soon. :-(
 This movie is really very well done and delivers incredible action sequences, not to mention an original plot idea. The DVD as of this writing offers little of anything in the way of bonus material but is a grand improvement on the VHS.",1088553600,,4427,4.885486018641811

The big governor will never win any Oscars, but he always gives us what we expect: high octane action and great supporting characters.  The scene in which Arnie jumps from the airplane is one heck of a suspenseful sequence.  Likewise, the chase in the zoo and the climax are just what you expect---action movies dont' get a whole lot better than this.
Along with Arnie, we get James Caan as the weasle traitor, doing a fine, fine job; the lovely Vanessa Williams a likeable heroine we all root for; James Coburn as Arnie's boss with a stiff upper lip and great silver hair; the always dependable Robert Pastorelli, who steals every scene he's in--the ER sequence with Camryn Manheim is hilarious; in their short screen time, both James Cromwell as Williams' traitorous boss and Tony Longo as Little Mike are superb.

Lots of chases, lots of gunfights, lots of action, and the bad guys get their just desserts - just what I signed up for. Vanessa Williams is actually a pretty decent actress, but so good-looking that I had trouble paying attention. A few other lesser characters do their jobs well, and even the corrupt union boss gets to be a good guy.
I'll grant a movie three impossible things to get going, but then it should play by its own rules. This one goes slightly over budget. The ""EM gun"", the mysterious plot device, launches a metal slug ""close to the speed of light"" (erk). The slug's impact on the human target picks him up bodily and throws him a dozen meters. For some reason, the slug doesn't just pass through the victim like a BB through butter. Also, its recoil doesn't throw the guy holding the launcher backwards, as I'd expect from an equal and opposite reaction. Well, I learned as much physics from Roadrunner as from Isacc Newton, so I'll let it go.

This nonstop action-thriller follows the misadventures of John Kruger (Schwarzenegger), an 'eraser' with a secret witness-protection program who gets rid of all traces of a witness's previous identity. He reports to James Caan and he's assigned to protect Vanessa Williams as she rats out a megacorporation doing a dirty arms deal.
That's all you need to know, and it's very nearly all there is. There's some high-tech gadgetry, some not-altogether-persuasive CGI stuff, some humor, and a whole lot of hairbreadth escapes; there's also Robert Pastorelli in a terrific supporting role, and a brief appearance by a surprisingly menacing James Cromwell. But the plot in this one _is_ the action.
Perhaps the single most unconvincing portion is Caan duking it out with Schwarzenegger; in real life, Arnold would most likely have Jimmy for lunch. But Caan is terrific all the same (and if you like him, be sure to see _Rollerball_).

That's why it grieves me  to pan this movie.  This flick asks you to suspend disbelief just a little  too much.  Well, A LOT too much, truth be told.
Arnold plays a U.S.  Marshall, who works alone.  His job description is more that of a special  operations soldier, who seems to leave very few laws unbroken.
At the  very beginning of the movie, for instance, Arnold whooshes into the house  of a mobster in the Witness Protection Program who is about to have his  tongue cut off by bad guys. Arnold is alone, dressed in black, and  well-armed.  He kills two bad guys in self-defense, and executes another on  the front lawn. Prior to arriving here, he has stopped by the morgue and  stolen two corpses.
What else does he do?  He hides the heroine, played  by Vanessa Williams, in New York City, and as he's leaving, casually hands  her pistol and says, ""All you have to do is pull the trigger.""  Yeah, right!  NO COP would EVER do this!  I don't know how many laws he  broke there, but it had to be at least a few.
Throughout the movie, he  shoots first and asks questions later, if he asks them at all.  He is  mistaken for ""mole,"" and has hordes of federal agents pursuing  him.  He never questions whether they are all genuinely corrupt, or if are  following orders, believing him to be a bona fide suspect; he happily blows  them all away.  And at the end of the movie...well, I'll let you see that  and judge the believability of it for yourself.
This movie does have some  funny lines, and the scene in the zoo with the marauding alligators is  great.  How much you enjoy this movie will depend largely on how easy it is  for you to overlook the fact that a federal agent commits felony after  felony after felony, apparently oblivious to the law.",966729600,,2017,4.446280991735537

89241,4,079073124X,"Previously I owned the laserdisc version of this film, and was impressed by the quality of the image and sound of that disc. The film itself is nice entertainment, with Arnold Schwarzenegger in good shape. Visually and  technically this film is very good, filled with all kind of technical  gadgets. There has been paid much attention to the quality of camerawork  and imaging. Also, there are some nice sfx, especially in the scene where  they have to cope with a few alligators broken loose from their cages.  Playing the DVD did please me much, for it's quality is a bit better than  the laserdisc I mentioned before. Image quality is very sharp en steady in  color reproduction, which cannot be stated for every DVD production, as I  know from experience. The DVD sound is impressive, with great clarity in  the whole sound image and a nice output in the lowest frequencies, when  needed. If you like Schwarzenegger action-movies you probably should own  this one, but since the disc is exemplatory in quality, you might want to  own it anyway and add it to your action genre collection. A great disc!",951955200,5,1105,4.757894736842105
89242,3,079073124X,"While the change from all-out ""let's kill everybody"" to an FBI-based spy action is intriguing, I found that decreasing the special effects in favor of accreting a cohesive storyline does not work marvels  for Arnold. The ""undercover man"" image just doesn't do him  justice. Come on, people, where last have you seen a seven-foot-tall spy?  The story doesn't have quite enough incidental laughs in it, but, for some  reason, I found myself chuckling at the zoo shoot-out scene. This really  isn't the best of what such a star as Arnold can do.",951523200,,542,4.8478260869565215

89244,5,079073124X,"This movie form Arnold and vanessa was action packed and one of the best for 99. The plot was good and it had some good twists in the movie. Some were obvious and others you couldn't see coming. Vanessa Willams took it to  another level with her acting in this one. She is one of the few  singers/actors that does everything good and dosen't look fake. This is  probably one of her best roles. Arnold took over with the action as  always......and there was a lot of action in this. This movie is even  better when u watch it in a home system with surround sound. the beginning  is action from the start and gets you into it from the beginning. If you  want a good action,adventure, detective picture..then get this. This lets  you see how eays it is to get into someones personal files and see where  they live, there family and even other stuff u think the government  wouldn't know.
Overall this movie si good. Don't pass this over.",945648000,,934,4.409356725146199
89245,2,079073124X,"As dull and dry as tumbleweed bouncing through an Arizona desert on the hottest day of the year.  Arnie coasts, Vanessa is ice, Caan is the same-old, same-old, Cromwell is slumming (from ""Babe"" to this! ),  and the action sequences are straight out of every Schwarzennegar action  flick from the past decade (look for the scene that is the exact duplicate  of the one with Jamie Lee Curtis in True Lies when she's holding onto  Arnold in mid-air).
In conclusion: rollin', rollin', rollin,' keep dese  doggies rollin'...",945475200,3,519,4.908045977011494
89246,5,079073124X,"Although some of the FX are rather low quality by todays standards (the alligators are just too unreal), the over-all feeling is intense.  James Cromwell's brief appearance is another notch in his belt, while Arnold has  some great scenes as well (""Where is this?"" ""Earth.  Welcome!"").  Vanessa Williams has definately shed the beauty queen  image with her smart acting style and she looks better than ever.  James  Caan is easy to hate in this movie as you'll find out early on.  And don't  forget Robert Pastorelli!  He can jump-start any movie.  James Coburn adds  class as the head of WitSec.  The DVD does lack features that many would  love to see, such as behind-the-scenes footage, commentary, etc.  I have  been a fan of Arnold since the first Conan movie and always look forward to  his next feature, but this one was beyond my expectations.  Definitely a  great deal!",940032000,13,878,4.8108108108108105
89247,4,079073124X,"Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Caan shine in this typical actioner from 1996.  Arnold plays John Krueger, known by the government callsign Eraser, the best soldier of WITSEC - the government's Witness Security Protection  program.  Caan is Robert DeGuerrin, callsigned Samaritan, Krueger's mentor,  who turns out to be a traitor.
Krueger is assigned to ""erase""  the identity of Lee Cullen (Vanessa Williams) so she will live long enough  to testify against the Cyrez Corporation, a defense contractor that is  selling the ultimate assault rifle - the EM-1, a scaled down velocity pulse  weapon, using electromagnetic pulse energy to fire solid metal bullets at  the speed of light, and thus smash through anything.  Trouble is, Cyrez is  selling these guns to the wrong people - the Russian mafia.  And to  Eraser's horror, Samaritan, an ex-CIA man, is the middleman in the deal.
The film involves several impressive action set-pieces.  The wildest is  a shootout onboard a government passenger jet, in which Eraser falls out  and must catch a midair parachute, then escape when Samaritan steers the  jet straight toward him.  Eraser then bails Lee from the NY City Zoo, in  the process blasting an alligator and declaring it now to be  luggage.
Later Eraser and Lee break a computer code and discover the true  depth of the plot, but are attacked by a squad of SWAT troopers; in the  ensuing melee Lee is grabbed by Samaritan.  The finale involves a  full-blown siege at Baltimore harbor, in which Eraser blasts away with EM  guns.
Schwarzenegger, Caan, Williams, and James Coburn give enjoyable  performances.  Far less impressive are the mob of mobsters who help out  Eraser in Baltimore.  And when will we see an action movie where the good  guys lose?  As it happens, in the epilogue it appears we see just that - a  van carrying Eraser and Lee explodes.  But it's a ruse.
Nevertheless, the  lead performances, SFX, sound mixing, Alan Silvestri's Judge Dredd-esque  score, and some excellent nighttime cinematogrophy make for an entertaining  actioner.",934329600,,2058,5.075075075075075
89248,4,079073124X,"I was tempted to give this three stars, but I think that the good pace and action sequences justify the four.
This is a standard action movie. The plot touches on the ludicrous at times, and there are some nice holes to  poke your finger into if you are in the mood, but the action is more than  enough to keep you interested and watching.
The biggest complaint you can  address to the film is probably Schwarzenegger's invulnerability. Okay, he  gets hurt. But he carries on as if it never happened, and the number of  times he avoided the guns (which were a brilliant weapon)...I had to  laugh.
This films definately worth a watch for the action. Don't expect  much more, however, and remember there are other actors who are more than  capable of pulling this off.",926553600,2,766,4.54014598540146
