8398197,3,B003JJR18I,I  had ordered the wrong Sutures  .Once I realize this was not movie I wanted I ordered the correct one,1386633600,,103,4.1
8398198,3,B003JJR18I,"The blackest of black market organ selling is evinced in this lurid shocker,  Although the plot has more holes than a colander, the sheer brutality overtakes you and you find yourself involved.  The performances and production values are routine but the very final twist unexpected if ludicrous.
Veteran character actor Andrew Prine looks pretty fit at 75 and HUSK's excellent CJ Thomason tries hard.
Not a classic but not a total waste.",1303516800,2,437,5.055555555555555
8398199,1,B003JJR18I,"I am convinced that the positive reviews are from people affiliated with the movie (or their friends).  I enjoy a good B horror flick, but there was absolutely nothing remotely entertaining or redeemable about this movie.  Felt like a high schooler's attempt at making a movie (and cafeteria friends who acted the role).  The reviewer who noted the audio issues was exactly right. This may go down as the worst movie I've seen in all time.  Would be PERFECT for Mystery Science Theater 3000, however, if it were still around! Under that circumstance a winner...

In fairness, I could only stand this for about a half hour before turning it off.  I should note I got it as a distraction while I needed to sip a disgusting prep for a colonoscopy the next day, and it still didn't fulfill its purpose!  The prep was less aversive.  Rent at your own risk!  Wasn't worth the buck I paid at Redbox... Read the limited reviews with caution...",1281916800,4,935,4.618181818181818
8398200,4,B003JJR18I,"For an independent production, this things rocks.  The story is amazing, the production values are great.  And an ending you just don't see coming.",1280966400,6,147,5.083333333333333
8398201,5,B003JJR18I,"Finally... an intelligent psychological thriller/horror that instantly grabs your attention and holds on to it with a well groomed storyline.  Great acting, good character development, and unexpected twists that lead up to a startling surprise ending makes 'Sutures' a must see.",1280275200,3,278,5.780487804878049
8398202,5,B003JJR18I,"Great cinematography supports this very tightly woven shocker, which becomes satisfyingly complex as the plot progresses. Ensemble cast was excellent.

8398203,1,B003JJR18I,"First off this film has a horrible audio track meaning you have to raise and lower the volume (raise to hear them speak, lower when they scream) and is below low budget. The story is the same as usual a group of Friends go to an isolated location...Acting was very poor as was the plot. Much better Horror out there so please save your money.",1279843200,6,342,4.276923076923077
