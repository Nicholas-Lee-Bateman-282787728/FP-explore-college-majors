4890481,3,B005TFVM0I,"We diligently bought each season of Columbo as they came out on DVd over the years. When we saw this, we were thrilled that a collection hadn't been released. We should have read more (I know, our fault) but these have ALL BEEN RELEASED ON HIS OTHER DVD SETS!",1326326400,5,259,4.3061224489795915
4890482,5,B005TFVM0I,"I have already pre ordered this DVD set of Columbo on Amazon and can't wait to have this on January 10, 2012 of next year. Columbo is a great character and Peter Falk was born to play Columbo.
Columbo rules!",1323993600,5,207,4.2

4890484,5,B005TFVM0I,. . . thank you!  This will complete my Columbo collection!  I have all boxed sets from the beginning and look forward to this ending.  One of my absolute favorites in set is Ashes to Ashes.  Rue McLanahan is a delight in this episode and as always Patrick McGoohan is his excellent acting self!,1320019200,52,295,4.407407407407407
4890485,5,B005TFVM0I,"Well Columbo fans, we waited patiently. As I write this I do not in fact have this collection on DVD which will be out in January, 2012.  My review however is valid since I have seen and collected each Columbo episode on VHS tape.
So my review is anticipatory.  Now my collection will be complete, having already purchased the earlier episodes, both from the 1968-74 years and the later years when Mr. Falk reprised his role as Lt. Columbo.  Having every episode enables me to watch a different one each evening with my grown kids who were not around or were too young to appreciate this great series.  One of the best TV shows of all time.",1319673600,42,640,4.444444444444445
4890486,5,B005TFVM0I,"What in the world has happened to season 8 and beyond...they released season 1 - 7 but have yet to release seaon 8...how long do we have to wait.

It has come to my attention that all season have been released, and with the release of this DVD all columbo episodes and movies are on DVD...I have also changed my star rating from 3 to 5...considering this is probaly the greatest show to ever air it goes without saying that it deserves no less then a perfect 5 star rating.",1319328000,9,473,4.2555555555555555
4890487,5,B005TFVM0I,"I have been a devoted fan of Columbo for many years. I now own all of his movies except this last Mystery Movie Collection.

4890488,5,B005TFVM0I,Works great.,1513209600,,12,5.5
4890489,3,B005TFVM0I,"IMHO a good, classical, Columbo episode is composed of: 1) Columbo's annoying, pestering behavior - the more the better; 2) a good plot, with an intrincate way of comitting the murder, or proving how it was done or both; 3) a great antagonist, who is not afraid of engaging Columbo in a duel of wits and actually may like it. Considering these criteria, I honestly can recommend only 2 of the seven  episodes included in this collection: Ashes to Ashes and Murder with too many notes. Not only the plots are way better than the other ones, but the ""villains""  (Patrick McGoohan and Billy Connolly) are so good you almost feel sorry they are caught in the end.",1505520000,,659,4.576271186440678

4890522,4,B005TFVM0I,"These films compare favorably to the old Columbo series, with Ashes to Ashes being the best and Undercover being the weakest (Undercover also strayed considerably from the original murder mystery format). It was great to watch Columbo working cases again!",1476144000,,255,5.4

4890569,5,B005TFVM0I,I am so glad that I purchased this DVD set. I am a huge Columbo fan and thoroughly enjoyed watching these episodes. Like someone else said it would have been nice to have some extras on the DVD set such as a commentary from his wife Shera Danese who appeared on a total of six Columbo episodes alongside Peter Falk. This would have been especially fitting since Peter Falk has passed away. I did love watching these episodes though and am sure I'll be watching them again and again like I have done with so many of the Columbo episodes.,1429833600,6,536,4.37

However, the movies that were done after the series essentially ended had many ""character ,"" flaws. These were things that went against the original character of Columbo. This series contains the worst Columbo ever made, UNDERCOVER. It has Columbo going undercover to solve a crime and rarely in his trademark trench coat. (The unique element of Columbo was that we already see the crime and we watch him solve it.) This one also has him giving out money for information, when did Columbo ever have plenty of cash to hand out! Some of the other episodes are okay but the William Shatner one shows off just how bad an actor he is. This is the only Columbo series I don't have or want in my collection.",1421539200,,788,4.510489510489511

4890625,5,B005TFVM0I,A clean program of the 70-80s.  The message was clear without excess violence and Peter Falk's creation of the character is just excellent.  The writing and music were a bit better in the earlier series.  Henry Mancini's music the best.,1400198400,,236,4.85
4890626,5,B005TFVM0I,"In my opinion the later era TV movies were better even than the 70's TV show. Of course I grew up watching the 90's movies, and they refect my era so I guess that is fair. I dig the old seventies ones too, but you have to notice that the writers had to keep stepping it up, to make the Clolumbo formula work again and again. They always did, and so, with this, the movie collection 1994-2003 you get all first rate Columbo mysteries, right up to COLUMBO LIKES THE NIGHTLIFE... Peter Falks swan song (I was completely stoked when this one aired..). The older he got, the more witty and aloof he got, which makes the character work better.  Columbo was wicked crazy looking and aloof and old when he busted that rave club jerk in 2003. Some techno punk thought he was all that with his E-pills and his rave girls and his gold fish inside of the floor tiles... He wasn't. RIP Peter Falk...",1399507200,,886,4.3053892215568865

There are some good ones, mind you, but for the most part, this doesn't reach out and ""grab"" you the way the originals did.  I've watched all of the originals many times over.

They have it all--good writing, a touch of humor, a bit of mystery (we know who did it, but we don't know what clues he or she has left behind), and a chance to see film or TV stars we haven't glimpsed in years. Everyone, it seemed, wanted a guest shot on Columbo. At the heart of it all, of course, is Peter Falk's iconic character, surely the most beloved lieutenant ever. He solves all crimes with his wits, and while he knows he's good (and we know he knows), he never shows off. He has a self-effacing personality that wins our hearts and our affection. No need for tiresome car chases, special effects, fist fights, or gun fights. Some of these films are old favorites, and some are new. Either way, I'm learning to appreciate Falk's acting skill. Though the plots certainly follow a formula, he manages to make each one seem new, and his delivery of lines is impeccable--just the right mix of ""I'm confused here"" and ""I know you did it."" He can say more with one raise of an eyebrow than most actors can convey in ten lines. Sheer fun.",1360281600,5,1084,4.452261306532663

""Murder With Too Many Notes"" could have been titled Murder With Too Many Minutes. I'm a Billy Connely fan (I would listen to him read the phone book) but it is a weak entry. Patrick McGoohan is back (does he ever leave ""Columbo""?) in ""Ashes To Ashes"", which is very entertaining indeed.  The ageless William Shatner is on hand to chew the scenery as well in ""Butterfly In Shades of Gray"". Peter Falk as always plays his role perfectly, but Father Time was closing in.

""Columbo"" is a murder mystery television series, starring Peter Falk (1927 to 2011) as Lieutenant Columbo, a homicide detective with the Los Angeles Police Department.

This series popularized the inverted detective story format or ""HowdHeCatchem"" format where in almost every episode began by showing the commission of a murder by a killer.  There is no ""WhoDunIt"" element.

The plot mainly revolves around the killer or killers, whose identity is already known to the audience, and how he, she, or they will be caught and exposed.

Columbo is a friendly, verbose, dishevelled-looking detective (his trademark attire is a rumpled raincoat over a suit and tie) of Italian decent who is consistently underestimated by his suspects.  He has increasingly irritating, pestering behaviour with those he thinks committed the crime.  Columbo has certain unforgettable catchphrases (one which titles this review).

The episodes were broadcast from (1968 to 1978) and from (1989 to 2003).  There were 69 episodes (45 + 24) in total.

This collection contains the seven episodes that were televised in the years (1994 to 2003).  They are presented in chronological sequence. The titles of these episodes and my brief impression of them are given below:

(1) Butterfly in shades of grey:  1 hr, 32 min;  Guest star: William Shatner;  Filmed in 1993; Excellent
(2) Undercover:  1 hr, 33 min;  Guest stars: Ed Begley, Jr., Tyne Daly;  Filmed in 1994;  Deviates from a standard episode but acceptable

(3) Strange bedfellows:  1 hr, 33 min;  Guest stars: George Wendt, Rod Steiger;  Filmed in 1995; Obvious in parts but very good
(4) A trace of murder:  1 hr, 32 min;  Filmed in 1997;  Very good

(5) Ashes to ashes:  1 hr, 30 min;  Filmed in 1998;  Guest stars: Patrick McGoohan, Rue McClanahan, Sally Kellerman; Excellent
(6) Murder with too many notes:  1 hr, 29 min;  Filmed in 1999;  Very good although I had trouble with the solution to the crime
(7) Columbo likes the nightlife:  1 hr, 28 min;  Filmed in 2003;  Very good although I had trouble with the solution to the crime;  This is the very last episode of the complete series.

In each episode, the screen goes black for a second or two between scenes.

Finally, this collection (which was released in 2012) has no extras.

In conclusion, this collection gives you a chance to see the legendary Peter Falk play the equally legendary trench coat-wearing Lieutenant Columbo.  Oh!  ""Just one more thing.""  (I'm kidding! This is another Columbo catchphrase.)

**** 1/2

(1994 to 2003 ;  10 hr, 35 min; 7 episodes;  3 discs;  2 episodes per disc with the final disc having 3 episodes;  wide screen)

But in the end, he always ""get's his man,""(or woman).  With calm persistence, he  pokes away at his suspects, until he has them cornered.  The killer usually feels that he/she has all the bases covered, but slowly Columbo breaks down these ""fortresses"". Then finally after numerous, annoying ""oh...just one more question,"" he confronts them with their guilt.  Watching him systematically builld his case, never ceases to amaze me.

4890716,3,B005TFVM0I,"I had to buy this DVD as it's the final piece to my Columbo collection, and for that reason primarily, I'm glad I bought it.  As the series went on, Columbo became a caricature of himself -- we all know he's going to say ""Oh, one more thing..."".  It's really not necessary for the writers to run that line into the ground.  And by the way, I couldn't help but notice that Shera Danese, Peter Falk's wife, co-starred in two episodes in this set and she's been in earlier installments of this series as well (I assume, as an executive producer of ""Columbo,"" Peter Falk was thinking ""happy wife = happy life"") because her acting leaves a LOT to be desired.  The writing of this show wasn't half as good as the earlier seasons and, in fact, the only episode worth a 5-star rating is the one with George Wendt as a horsebreeder who kills his degenerate-gambler brother.  The last episode, ""Columbo Likes the Nightlife,"" was disappointing in that I expected the finale to be outstanding with a better-known cast of guest stars.  The earlier seasons were definitely much, much better.  Every now and then I go back and start at the first season and re-watch each and every DVD set and appreciate how great this show and the character of Lt. Frank Columbo is (according to NBC, that was his first name). There are no extras included here -- no episodes of ""Mrs. Columbo"" (as there are on the earlier-released DVDs).

4890721,5,B005TFVM0I,"Like the previous Columbo movies produced when the series returned in the late 80's, this final set is a mixed bag of the best and worst of the show.

The best: great guest stars, intriguing murders, and, of course, Peter Falk in his Emmy-winning role.

The worst, and that can be summed up in one word: bloated.  As was the case in even the classic Columbo's, the better shows were the 90-minute ones, rather than the 2-hour movies.

The best of the seven installments in this compilation are ""Butterfly in Shades of Grey,"" featuring William Shatner making a second murderous turn; ""Strange Bedfellows,"" with ""Cheers"" George Wendt and Oscar-winner Rod Steiger; ""Ashes to Ashes,"" guest-starring Emmy winners Patrick McGoohan and Rue McClanahan; and ""Columbo Likes the Nightlife,"" the final installment, highly reflective of its contemporary setting.

While ""Undercover"" and ""A Trace of Murder"" have their moments, ""Murder with Too Many Notes"" is possibly the weakest Columbo ever produced. The episode really suffers from a mediocre script and an even more mediocre villain in the form of guest star Billy Connolly.

There are no extras in this set and it would have seemed fitting that Falk's widow, Shera Danese - featured in ""A Trace of Murder"" and three previous episodes - would have been asked to give some commentary on her husband and his long association as the detective.

Though he is no longer able to don the rumpled coat and finish smoking that cigar, we, his fans, can revel in the fact that every one of Falk's Columbo appearances can be viewed over and over again...and that, in itself, deserves a ""just one more thing...""",1328572800,117,1639,4.9381818181818184

Watching the series evolve over the years is similar to waiting for a bottle of fine wine to properly age. Peter Falk always stayed true to the character without ever becoming stale.  In the later years, at an age where many people would be retired, his portrayal  showed that becoming older does not mean becoming irrelevant; he always gave us such wonderful insight into the satisfaction of loving your work and always finding a new challenge.  This last set of movies, which included guest stars from earlier episodes, is an entertaining, and yes, bittersweet farewell to our beloved Peter Falk and Columbo.
