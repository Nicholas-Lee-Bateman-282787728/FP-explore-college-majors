Also, I suspect it doesn't like slot-loading DVD players making a whirring sound and then ejecting the disc. When playing on a computer it won't play half the chapters...?

This review is based on viewing a version of this video on Utube titled:
NWO, Secret Societies & Biblical Prophecy: Vol 1 (Revised).

This video presentation is an achievement, and a serious contribution to our understanding of the world we live in. It is a theory of history: a successful delineation of the big picture of what has been happening and why. Like any good theory, it tells you why things happened, and if it is correct and you apply it you ought to be able to understand what is going on now and predict what will happen in the future.

It is a mistake to pass by this video as just another conspiracy theory. Yes it will talk about all the buzz words of the conspiracy theory universe, you know, the Bilderbergs, the Rothschilds, the Masons, Zionism, etc., but it does so in a framework of thought that makes sense of them. Without focusing on any one of them in particular as the source of all evil, it tells you how they arose, and puts them in a proper framework and points out their place in the big scheme of things.

Let me say here that ""Conspiracy Theory""  is really another name for  ""People's theory"", or ""people's history"" because  it is a term that  refers to people's attempt to  understand events when the official versions feel fake and unsatisfying. People would not theorize about events unless what is being told to them does not satisfy their intellect.  In our world today in the early part of the 21st  Century, there are so many events of the past hundred years or so, let alone current events, that defy logic and rationality, because the official versions leave so much unexplained and some have been shown to have been patently false. Examples are many and go back a good while: World War I. Why was the world at war? The Nazis and WWII. What gave rise to that hatred and that all out war?. Who killed President Kennedy  and his brother and why? The 9/11 attack. Who did that?  Who is satisfied with the story that 19 young men, a few of whom barely had taken flight lessons, took control of four jetliners and flew them with precision into the towers and brought them down, and at least one near by building that wasn't even hit came down by itself in like manner? Who believes that, except someone who wants to go to sleep? This video presentation is not about 9/11, but it gives some fantastic insights into that, as well as the other issues mentioned above, and many other issues and events.

 The official stories (i.e., history) they tell us in school and now in the media leave so much unexplained that people have to take it upon themselves to figure out what really happened. There is a disconnect between the people and those who consider themselves in charge of the world or world owners, or as we say in Conspiracy Theory: The New World Order (NWO), which stopped being a theory and became fact ever since President Bush (Bush 1) announced the New World Order at the start of the first Gulf War. The methodical program of killing and destruction began anew at that time, and has not stopped yet. They have worked their way to Syria, and destroyed that country totally, and now they want to move to Iran next, and then to whoever else wants to stand up to it. This beast of a power that is just grinding things down into pieces and stumping on the residue, is a voracious and mindless beast on a rampage. You won't know why there is no peace in the world if you don't even know it exists. It does not tolerate independence or dissent. That was Iraq's crime. It was Libya's crime, Morsi's Egypt's crime,  Syria's, and also it is Iran's crime, really. They did not bow the knee. It is a `surrender and do as we say or else' kind of a deal.  The middle east is the focus of a lot of attention of NWO  because of the oil which is vital for running the world. Saudi Arabia and the Emirates are safe for now because they are complete and utter puppets. Russia and China are super powers and they cooperate and play along, and are `safe' for now. Every country can be evaluated on this scale. Look at South American countries and you can place them on this scale too.

This video presentation is a big picture story of the past two hundred years. It is obvious that a lot of effort went into it. It is not anti any people of any sort. It has a rather cool and even keel sort of style of presentation that really adds to its power and effectiveness. There are innumerable telling Quotes from the main movers of events of the past 200 years, that trace the events to the present and how things got here. Above all in this presentation connects the dots  in a way that makes a coherent big picture that makes sense of most of the big events. It is a great contribution.

The creator of this video presentation, Mr. Ulrich, should, after accepting the thanks and accolades that will come his way, and if he has not done so already, move to put this presentation in book form,  with the references and sources given so that we have a record of everything and others can verify and add to it or dispute parts of it with their facts. A book can allow thoughtful and systematic follow up work that he or others can do. In other words, a book can help organize other researcher's work so that they all add up to something much bigger than any work on its own and compete in the academic realm.
