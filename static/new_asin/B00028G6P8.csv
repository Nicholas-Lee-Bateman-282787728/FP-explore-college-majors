2067706,4,B00028G6P8,"Unforgiven was pretty much an above average ppv. Most of the matches were as expected and they did a good job to put on a good performance for the show.

1. Ric Flair & Batista vs. Chris Benoit & William Regal
This was a very good choice for an opener. I'd have to say this was way better than the tag team titles match that happened later on in the ppv. Batista was showing his unstoppable force he posesses. Flairs style & regal's meshed in pretty well with each other and so along did Benoit's. There were some hard knifehead chops delivered to Flair in this one. The ending was pulled off very nicely and it worked in well. A very solid opener. 4/5

2. Women's Title
Trish Stratus w/ Tomko vs. Victoria
These two have had way better matches in the past but this was a decent women's match for the title. Tomko interfered at certain points in the match for trish. The ending felt a little off and uncalled for to me. Decent match between the divas. 3.25/5

After the match, Tomko had a little miss up with a Mystery woman who turned out to be Stevie Richards. This little brawled shouldn't have lasted more than 5 minutes but this was totally a waste of time which lasted around 10 minutes or so. This could have been saved for Raw.

3. Ladder Match for the Vacant Intercontinental Title
Chris Jericho vs. Christian
Jericho & Christian out did themselves in this ladder match. They showed us some pure athleticism and poise to everyone. It started out pretty slow and the ladders didn't come into play right away. It got better as the match went on. Both men took some nasty falls off the ladder and shots into the ladder. This is one ladder match that you won't forget after you see it. Another thing, this ladder match reminded me of the one from Wrestlemania X between HBK & Razor. A darn good ladder match. 5/5

4. No Disqualification
Kane w/ Lita vs. Shawn Michaels
This was a pretty good return match for HBK. Kane and HBK blended in pretty well. Kane took advantage of the no dq rule from time to time. Using the steel steps to open up HBK and suplexing him through the announce table. Michaels pulled some good counters to Kane. The ending was good as well and pulled off very cleanly. A good match. 4.5/5

5. World Tag Team Titles
Rhyno & Tajiri vs. La Resistance
This match really didn't get my attention at all that much. I felt it could have been better and there wasn't much leading up to the match for the fans to care about it. A decent match at best with a few good spots. 3/5

6. World Heavyweight Title
Randy Orton vs. Triple H
This was a good match for Orton to lose his title in. But of course Randy was only put as champion to erase Brock Lesnar for being the youngest champion in history. I enjoyed Randy as champion at this time, him and HHH had a great feud going on.

The match was wrestled very strategically. HHH and Randy tryed to work on the leg of each other. Orton was more of the aggressor and not backing down from the game. I felt a lot of the interference took a great deal away from the match itself and many of it was uncalled for (such as the Coach coming out as the referee). It did had a couple of good spots like when HHH pedigreed orton into a steel chair. But the whole interference from Evolution really wasn't needed to be there. Still a solid, wrestled main event. 4.75/5

Unforgiven is one to pick up from 2004. Probably the ladder match and the main event are the biggest reasons to get this.",1223337600,,3443,4.317337461300309
2067707,2,B00028G6P8,"I tend to ramble, so if you want the short version, here goes:
There are only two good matches on this PPV: one's on the impressive LADDER MATCH DVD, and the other's on YouTube.

Amazon's gonna stop posting my reviews if I keep mentioning that free-sharing, copyright-infringing video website.  Anyway, UNFORGIVEN 2004 is probably the worst of the entire PPV series.

Now for the long version:

***************************************

1) Ric Flair & Batista v. Chris Benoit & William Regal
---Call me crazy, but to me, this contest sounds like a dream match.  In 2004, these guys were capable of anything.  To this opener's credit, these guys do a decent job of overcoming such random booking.  After all, this was some of RAW's biggest talent.  The only real problem is that it's too long, mainly when Regal's getting dominated for a lengthy period of time.  I think this whole affair lasted a good 20 minutes.  And when Benoit finally gets to shine, he doesn't really do much I haven't seen him do before.  These nitpicks might not bother some viewers, but it got repetitive after a while.
""6.0 / 10""

2) Women's Championship
Trish Stratus (champion) v. Victoria
---There is no reason why these two put on this crapfest.  Oh dear Lord, we've got botched moves, poor pacing, and a length so quick you'd think you were watching RAW.  Honestly, there's just not much to say about it without delving into madness.
""4.0 / 10""

3) Tyson Tomko v. Steven Richards
---Speaking of madness...welcome to this impromptu borefest.  The storyline is that Tomko was at ringside for the Women's Title Match, and some ""mystery woman"" who'd been causing trouble, answered Tomko's challenge to fight.  If you haven't skipped to the next match, please be aware: This is easily one of the worst matches I've ever watched!  I never press my SKIP button on the remote, 'cause I wanna give a fair review.  But if there was ever a time to use that button, this infuriating dreck is it.  A match so bad I am arrogant enough to say, ""I could do better.""
""1.0 / 10"" (They get 1 point for getting in the ring.
If I believed in Zero Scores, I'd use it.)

4) Ladder Match - Intercontinental Championship (vacant)
Chris Jericho v. Christian
---Now we go from one of wrestling's closet skeletons to one of its finest moments.  In a time when we think there are no more ways to use a Ladder, these two still came up with a variety of spots that no sane person should try.  The best Ladder Matches don't become ""spotfests"" like TLC Matches; instead, my favorites have a good balance of smart competition AND high spots.  Both men actually compete as if they're trying to win, but still give us those great ""HOLY SH_T"" moments.  I don't care how you get around to watching this modern classic; just watch it!
""9.0 / 10""

5) No Disqualifications
Kane v. Shawn Michaels
---This was HBK's PPV return after being ""injured"" by Kane (he probably just took a break after his grueling Hell-In-A-Cell against Triple H).  This is the 2nd of three marquee matches for the PPV, and it's one of the few HBK matches I don't really like.  It felt a lot like something from Michaels' 1996 title reign; he'd get beaten up for the majority of the match, but then he'd ""Hulk Up"" to win.  Plus, you'd think having no rules would've let these rivals go all out.  However, this fight is more of a straight-up match, only becoming an anything-goes affair at the very end.  Not a bad match, but just unremarkable, in my opinion.  Still, a mediocre match from HBK is better than most wrestlers' peaks.
""6.5 / 10""

6) World Tag Team Championships
La Resistance (champions) v. Tajiri & Rhyno
---I'm gonna give Kane/HBK a pass, because it might've not been my personal taste.  But make no mistake: these four guys put on a match that'll impress very few.  If you want the epitome of ""Who Cares?"" then look no further.  This presentation of RAW's Tag Team gold is painfully bland and unexciting.  Like the opener, it's just one-sided for such a long period of time that I stopped paying attention.  Plus, any finish involving a flag is crap!
""3.0 / 10""

7) World Heavyweight Championship
Triple H v. Randy Orton (champion)
---Back in 2004, we all knew this main event was coming at some point.  But WWE couldn't have done a better job building it up.  After having multiple above-average matches with Shawn Michaels and/or Chris Benoit, 2004 was a great year for Triple H.  And Orton couldn't have had a better match to become the youngest champion in history: the SUMMERSLAM 2004 classic where he dethroned Chris Benoit.  And the RAW hype (as you'll see in the video package) was excellent.  Expectations were high, and once the bell rang, both men delivered a strong main event.  The only real setback is that when Orton was babyface, he didn't have much offense.  However, even with that gripe --- along with most of us thinking the wrong guy won --- either man could've walked away champion.  This was an enjoyable match years ago, and it's still a nice trip down memory lane.
""7.5 / 10""

***************************************

OVERALL
---UNFORGIVEN 2004 is a poor event, plain and simple.  But there are two diamonds buried within the pile of garbage: the IC Title Ladder Match and the World Heavyweight Title Match.  So again, pick up the LADDER MATCH DVD, especially because that's an excellent compilation of matches.  And if you wanna see the HHH/Orton main event, then just go to YouTube.

Just don't spend any money on UNFORGIVEN 2004.  There's a reason Kane's laughing on the cover art: If You Buy The DVD, The Joke's On You.",1220572800,,5576,4.68692070030896
2067708,4,B00028G6P8,"I just wanted to let everyone know that my local Wal-Mart has just put out a huge display of old wwe wrestling dvds. Unforgiven 2004 was one of them. The price?? how about $3.88 brand new unopened!!! So, for old those sellers selling this for $7.00 to $8.00 used, you better come down, cause Wal-Mart has it for $3.88 NEW! oh, and there is no shipping charges at Wal-Mart..The used price for this should be around 1.00.",1169510400,,419,4.454545454545454
2067709,3,B00028G6P8,"1. Chris Benoit & William Regal vs. Batista & Ric Flair

A decent opener, though a bit slow throughout the match. Regal looks pretty sloppy and out of place, but Benoit does his best to make up for it. An entertaining opener, but nothing spectacular. Good way to start the show though, with the right team winning. 6/10

2. WWE Women's Championship Match: Trish Stratus (c) vs. Victoria

As usual, the standard women's match. Need I say more? Skip. 4/10

3. Tyson Tomko vs. Steven Richards

This match wasn't announced to be on the card, but it was a suprise. I've had better suprises in my crap. Don't even bother, you'll only waste your time. 2/10

4. Ladder Match for the Vacant Intercontinental Championship: Chris Jericho vs. Christian

Now, the PPV finally starts to get good. This is a great ladder match between these two. They both know how to work well together, and theres a couple great spots too. Great performance by Jericho, as usual, and Christian looks good too. They use the ladder in really innovative ways too, which is very cool. Come to think of it, this is probably responsible for the Money in the Bank ladder match in a way. Overall, a great match, make sure you watch this one. 9/10

5. No Disqualification Match: Shawn Michaels vs. Kane

This is a great match between the Showstopper and Kane. I'm glad they added the No DQ stipulation, because even though they don't use it that much, it gives them a lot more freedom. Kane and HBK both work well in this match, and put on noteworthy performances.  Just a good match in general, very entertaining. 8.5/10

6. World Tag Team Championship Match: La Resistance vs. Rhyno & Tajiri

A decent tag match here, everybody looks pretty solid. However, I think the wrong team wins this one. Overall, a middle of the road match that you can skip if you want to. 5.5/10

7. World Heavyweight Championship Match: Randy Orton (c) vs. Triple H

Orton's first title defense since he won the title from Benoit in an excellent match at Summerslam 2004, and he proved in this match that he deserved to be champion. Triple H looks good in this one as well, though I think he does a little too much work on Orton's leg. Other then that, good match with a lot of back and forth action. The wrong man wins this one too, but the ending is good, with one of the most violent chair shots I've ever seen, followed up by a pedigree on one. Good title match, though Orton's reign was too short. 8.5/10

Overall, Unforgiven 2004 is a pretty good PPV, with only a couple weak spots in the card. The opener is ok, but the mid/upper card is where this event starts to look good, starting with the Ladder match, and then with HBK/Kane and the WHC match.

Match of the Night: The Ladder Match: Jericho vs. Christian. Its a very entertaining match with great spots and good wrestling. Not too much to complain about here, both look good in the ring and give us a great ladder match. One of the better matches of 2004.",1151798400,10,2958,4.490671641791045

Match One-Chris Benoit & William Regal Vs Batista & Ric Flair-This was a nice opener. Benoit used his skills along with Regal, Flair used his wisdom and Batista anilated them with strength. Though this was a good opener it dragged on for way to long. My rating 6.75/10.

Match Two-Womens Championship-Trish Stratus(C)Vs Victoria-Man I hate Victoria as a face and her dancing gimmick is poor. The match itself was pretty annoying with Tyson Tomko interfering a lot. Ending was very boring and it didn't do anything as it was a mystery woman attacking Tomko leading. My rating 1/10.

Match Three-Tyson Tomko Vs Steven Richards-Yes this is the mystery woman Steven Richards. Poor Steven having to work with Tomko on a really poor storyline. This match sucks the house down. My rating 1.4/10.

Match Four-Ladder Match-Intercontinental Championship-Y2J Vs Christian-Edge got stripped of the title due to injury and Christian returned from injury and wanted the title so Y2J came out and suggested they fight in a cage but Christian didn't want to because thats how he got injured. So it was a ladder match instead. This match had no new spots as it was just the same as always. Match was good lenght but the finish wasn't great. My rating 7.5/10.

Match Five-No DQ Match-Shawn""HBK""Michaels Vs Kane-This was HBKs return and it wasn't a great match the stipulation added one or two spots and it wasn't that good. My rating 5.80/10.

Match Six-World Tag Team Titles-La Resistance(C)Vs Rhyno & Tajiri-Finally the ECW pair got their shot at the titles and they made the most of it in a good match except the ending was screwed up and made it seem like nothing again. My rating 5.10/10.

Match Seven-Main Event-World Heavyweight Championship-Randy Orton(C)Vs HHH-This was a dud of a match. I was expecting a lot better from these two and this just disapointed me on all ends. Please give us a better main event then this please. My rating 6.48/10.

Overall Unforgiven wasn't that great scoring a 34.03/70 which is not that good in a percentage is 48.61% which is equal to a C. This PPV was average with no real good matches that stood out. Maybe rent it or buy it for the ladder match but otherwise its a no no.",1119830400,,2818,4.853813559322034

CHRIS BENOIT & WILLIAM REGAL defeated REC FLAIR & BATISTA: I didn't think this was a great choice as the opener, as it was always going to be pretty methodically paced. That was especially going to be the case considering the match lasted 15 minutes. Although, Benoit & Flair got their usual pops. Some good tagging here, but nothing really exciting happened until Benoit got the hot tag. Too much of a chopfest for my liking & not enough of a reason to feud to get excited about anything that occurred (the Eugene angle was incidental). Nothing too bad though & I think I may like a Batista vs Benoit feud, if that's the way the WWE heads. Match Rating...6

TRISH STRATUS defeated VICTORIA to Retain the WWE Women's Title: For a split second there, I thought a women's match was going to get 10 minutes!!! I actually liked the intensity shown by both women in this bout (especially considering the feud hasn't been great) Unfortunately, they never really took it to the next level by quickening the pace or doing anything different. So the match just kept plodding along at the same sufficent pace. Trish wins after Victoria distracted herself by diving over the top rope onto Tomko. Match Rating...5

TYSON TOMKO defeated STEVEN RICHARDS: What the hell was this!?!?!? I'm not a great fan of impromptu matches, but I knew that something had to be added to this card. The worst kept secret for a while was let out when Stevie Richards was revealed as the mystery woman who has been helping Victoria. What followed was quite possibly the worst match (if you could call it that) that I have ever seen on a ppv. Tomko squashed Richards for 5 minutes without really showing or proving anything. Stevie then had about 30 seconds of testicle-grabbing offense until Tomko hit his finisher soon after. Totally pathetic & proves how important depth is to each roster. Whoever allowed this debacle to waste 7 minutes should be fired!!! Match Rating...1

CHRIS JERICHO defeated CHRISTIAN in a Ladder Match to Win the InterContinental Title: Started off very slowly & I quickly became very pleased that the WWE booked a ladder match for this showdown. Their history from earlier this year came through enough during the bout, and that was obviously more so when the ladders became involved. A little too predictable & spotty at times, during it's 22 minute length, I am glad that I haven't seen a ladder match for a while. But at the end of the day, I couldn't fault either performer much at all. Yes, there were a few faults, but they put on an entertaining & intense match for all the fans. That's pretty much all we can ask. Match of the night by an absolute mile. Match Rating...8

SHAWN MICHAELS defeated KANE in a No Disqualification Match: The No DQ stipulation pretty much added nothing to this bout. Started off well with good intensity, but too quickly turned into a plodding & unexciting match with no real sense of direction. I'll even say that 18 minutes may have been too long for these 2 at this stage, but maybe that was because of the lack of hype given to the feud. Don't get me wrong, there was nothing bad about this match at all. But it definitely won't last in my memory for long. I'd like to see the feud continue and, for that reason, think that it would have been better if Kane emerged victorious here. Match Rating...6

LA RESISTANCE defeated RHYNO & TAJIRI to Retain the World Tag-Team Titles: Sheer silence greeted the majority of this 10 minute bout, and it just proves that the WWE need to do something with the tag division on Raw..... and quickly. The match wasn't actually that bad, but there just wasn't much life to it either. Tajiri added the most entertainment, but even he botched a tornado DDT. The champs retain & the tag division continues to go nowhere. Match Rating...5

TRIPLE H defeated RANDY ORTON to Win the World HeavyWeight Title: I've said it before & I'll say it again: Over-working a body part can do nothing but harm to the quality of a match. That's what happened here. Let me do the play-by-play on the opening 15 minutes of this bout; Orton slaps H twice. Orton spits on H. H works on Orton's left knee..... & then continues to do so for the next 10 minutes!!! I kid you not!!! H then blades after a totally imappropriate & anti-climactic spot. Now at this stage, Orton's left leg should basically be snapped in half. But predictably, he makes the big comeback & is simply too inexperienced to sell the injury properly. At least, the entertainment value very much picked up at this point. However, it soon turned into an overbooked mess involving Flair, Batista & even The Coach!!! Very disappointing 25 minute match & I genuinely worry about seeing many more months of this feud. Match Rating...5

PPV RATING (36/70) = 51

Looking at the key, I have basically given 'Unforgiven' a 'D' grade & said that it was 'mediocre & disappointing'. I cannot think of 2 better words to describe the event. In fact, I look back & think ""how the hell did I pass it?"" It had the ability to be solid, and maybe even something special. But it basically gave us nothing even remotely memorable, except for a good ladder match. The WWE haven't been too bad on pay-per-view lately, but this mediocre event comes too soon after the failing 'Great Amercian Bash' for my liking. This card had many similar traits to that shocker: (1) Not enough matches booked in advance, (2) Most matches poorly hyped, (3) Lack of roster depth being obvious, (4) Matches too long in duration, and (5) Simply poor decision-making with regards to booking. It didn't help that Unforgiven contained possibly the worst match I've ever seen on ppv. Sorry Jericho... Sorry Christian... But this card will be taped over with the next ppv!!!",1114732800,2,6300,4.621645796064401
2067783,4,B00028G6P8,"Unforgiven 2004 was an okay event, while it did have one of the most horrible matches in WWE history it did have history making events all throughout the card. This is one of 2004 ""Okay"" ppvs.

Batista and Ric Flair vs. Chris Benoit and William Regal:

This was the last time Batista and Flair would team up on a ppv. Benoit and Regal made a unique tag team with both men using old school wrestling on the Animal and the Nature Boy. Regal took a pounding in the beginning, then Benoit and Flair fight at the end and Benoit forces Flair to tap out. 7.5/10 Decent opener.

Women's title Match

Trish Stratus [Champion] vs. Victoria:

This was near the end of the legit womens division. Now only Trish, Victoria, and Lita are the actually women wrestlers, and Lita has a bad knee. The match was short, less than ten minutes. Tyson Tomko distracts Victoria which allows Trish to get the win. 6/10 It was a Raw material match

Tyson Tomko vs. Steven Richards:

Worst match in the new millenium so far, and thats saying something. This was back when Richards was in his last ""Storyline"" as dressing up as a woman. The match was about five minutes but it might as well have been 20, it was so slow. 0/10

Intercontinental Championship

Ladder Match

Chris Jericho vs. Christian:

The return of Christian finds him in a ladder match against Chris Jericho for the vacant IC title. The match had lots of ladder spots in it. One painful moment was when Jericho fell off a ladder and landed right on top of it. Too many spots to name, but they include a bulldog off the ladder and both men being thrown into the ladder numerous times each. About 20 minutes of a good match. 8.5/10

Kane vs. Shawn Michales

No Disqualification:

The returning HBK had to deal with the Big Red Machine, with Lita at ringside. The No DQ stipulation saved the match as some cool spots were used. Michales got busted open but used a chair to stop Kane and win his first match back. The match was good but it was one of those rivalries that should have been given more time to settle the score. 8/10

World Tag Team Championship

La Resistance [Champions] vs. Tajiri and Rhyno:

I liked Tajiri and Rhyno as a tag team, I thought they would actually win the belts. However this match wasn't very good, it wasn't even good, less than 10 minutes and the French guys using the flags to win the match. 5/10

World Heavyweight Championship

Randy Orton [Champion] vs. Triple H:

This was back when the biggest rivalry on Raw was between Randy and Triple H. This year its Batista and HHH, look for Flair vs. Triple H in 2006. As for the match, it was a total screwjob thanks to Evolution and the Coach. The match wasn't as good as their Royal Rumble match, but Triple H gave Randy one of the wickest chairshots and a pedigree on the chair for the win. 7.5/10 Their second match is much better

Unforgiven 2004 was good for Kane/HBK and the ladder match. The only things that were bad were the World Tag Team Championship match, and the dreadful Tomko/Richards match. The ladder match saved the entire thing though.",1113609600,2,3073,4.481149012567325

Kane vs Shawn Michaels 8.5/10- Lita makes an appearance. pretty good for a Kane match. Michaels carries the big goof well. HBK is the modern day Dusty Rhodes. he gets beat up most of the match. he won't quit, but keeps coming back for more & he bleeds all the time.

World Tag Team Championship

La Resistance vs Rhyno & Tajiri 7.5/10- a better match than i thought it would be. R&T work well together. screwjob ending is the only negative.

World Heavyweight Championship

Randy Orton vs Triple HHH 9.5/10- awesome match. Hunter even looks good in this one. Orton(the new Rock) can't be stopped. these 2 put on one of their better matches. Flair, Batista & Jonathan Coachman make an appearance. screwjob ending is the only thing that keeps this from a 10.

Internet fanboys complain about wcw and its older stars but these 2 right here are horrible.  Flair did better then Regal but thats not saying much.  Batista proves why he is a main eventer and Benoit is just so good.

Trish vs. Victoria-After I looked at the womens bodies long enough, i skipped.

Tomko vs. Richards-squash, poor Richards good talent gone to waste.  Still a fun match though.

Y2J vs. Christian ladder match-  Match of the night.  THese 2 should be world title champs.  Not much to say about this match but WOW.  Christian needs a push so bad.

Kane vs. HBK-  This was a good match, but Kane carried HBK.  Wierd saying that but its true.  This match shows how good Kane is.

Rhyno/Tajiri vs. La Res.-Short but good.  La Res. still bore me but Rhyno/ Taj make it fun.  wwe ruined a possible MONSTER in Rhyno though.

Orton vs. HHH-  I liked this match.  This was when Orton was that ""got the best you"" kid and it was cool.  But now there playing him as a god and im not liking it.  Ortons hould go back heel.  Really good match with ""Screwjob finsish""  Lots of outside interference but I loved it.

Overall, a good ppv if you ask me.",1111104000,,1260,4.388646288209607

1.) Chirs Benoit & William Regal vs Ric Flair & Batista  terrible match first chris benoit had been sh*t on and goes from main eventer to being in a bad opening match. 2nd William regals excellent in ring ability should be put to better use. 3rd Ric Flair is a terrible wrestler, he has only ever been able to do outrageous over-acted promo's and bleed, because he's been wrestling for over 30 years only means he is an old fool who can't let it go, his matches in ring are the most boring thing you could imagine watching, what makes him look half decent is the opponents he's against, he copys the same routine EVERYTIME he steps into the ring and it is lowering the ratings of raw drastically by him and an evolution member main eventing every raw and finally batista has no wrestling skills what so ever, is boring, slow and could not put on an entertaining match if his life depended on it. As for the match you can pretty much guess it was utterly boring and a waste of time. 2/10 for getting to see chris benoit and regal.

2.) Womens Championship
Trish Stratus vs Victoria these are 2 incredibly [...] and are actually quite fine athletes how ever besides the T&A this match wasn't overly good compared to some of there other perfomances but none the less good. 6/10

Tyson Tomko vs Steven Richards - utter garbage, steven richards is a great wrestler but his legacy has been shat on from a great height by the WWE. anyway this match was terrible, tyson tomko(just read what i said about batista and you have my opinion on tomko) 0/10.

Intercontinental Championship Ladder Match
Chris Jericho vs Christian - decent match but if Y2J had a good working opponent to work with in the ring we would've had match of the year i'd say but christian makes far too many stuff-ups and really doesn't bring much to the table. 5/10 for jerichos effort to put on a good match.

No Disqualifictaion Match
Shawn Michaels vs Kane - i actually really enjoyed this especially at this point of time of wrestling, both men put on quite an entertaning match alhtough the end was a little weak. 8/10. i don't think we'll ever get to see poor kane doing anything good anymore after the direction his character has gone so cherrish this match as far as kane goes.

La Resistance vs Rhyno & Tajiri - Rhyno and tajiri are two brilliant entertainers but have been used terribly since coming to the WWE, la resistance are a terribly boring tag-team and are utterly painful to have to watch, this match you can skip through. 2/10 i think i remember rhyno and tajiri doing some decent moves.

World Heavyweight Championship
Triple H vs Randy Orton  - this match i thought would be quite good but it turned out really bad, first off neither wrestler pulled off any good moves 2nd because HHH wins back the world title yet again and 3rd because flair helped him win overall bad match bad ending. 2/10.  OVERALL this was a terrible PPV but sean michaels VS kane was the only thing that made me not wanna hang myself for paying 30 bucks on PPV for it.",1099699200,,3166,4.482638888888889
2067829,1,B00028G6P8,"I'm not getting into detail about this horrible PPV. I am only focusing two things...the first and last match! Let's begin with the main event, Randy Orton (c) vs. HHH for the World Heavyweight Championship: Orton never deserved to win the title in the first place. HHH could never beat Benoit if his life depended on it. Then Randy comes along and beats Benoit (GARBAGE)! And then HHH beats Randy for the belt (even more GARBAGE)! Now both Randy and Benoit got screwed and the biggest tool in the business is back on top. He has no charisma, he can't wrestle, and he uses his pull to get his way. HHH takes away from all the good talent, making RAW trash to watch! Now onto the opening match...

Chris Benoit & William Regal vs. Batista & Ric Flair: This match was just there because they were trying to get Eugene some Vengeance for being destroyed by Evolution. And because they couldn't think of anything better for Benoit now that they have screwed him out of his championship. Benoit was one of the greatest Champions of all time. He put on the best matches and carried the belt like a champion should. Now he is shot down to mid-card, worthless matches that mean nothing. They should send him back to Smackdown where they will appreciate his talent, even if they made him a heel. Atleast they won this match.

The rest of this PPV is too horrible to go into...DON'T BUY IT!",1099612800,,1380,4.49402390438247

  I liked this match.  It got me into the Pay-Per-View!  How can you call this stupid and boring.  Your stupiud and boring for saying that.  Benoit makes Flair tap to Crossface.

Trish v. Vitoria  Women's Title

  I actually didn't watch this match.  I took a shower.  Anyways I saw the end it was dumb.  Trish wins.

Tyson Tomko v. Steven Richards

  This was such a fill in it was not funny.  Why put this on a Pay-Per-View.  Tomko wins.  Finally.

Christian v. Chris Jericho  IC Title  Ladder

  This was the greatest ladder match ever!!!!  It had everything....Shots with the ladder.  It would have been nice if the used chairs.  Jericho wins his 7th IC Title.

Shawn Michaels v. Kane  NO DQ

  Can this Pay-Per-View get any better.  Everybody said HBK was gonna win.  Kane could have won.  Somebody could of interfered like HHH and screw HBK.  Or Lita could turn.  But Shawn wins.

La Reistance v. Rhyno & Tajiri  World Tag Titles

  HaHaHa!  The greatest PPV gets better.  I really thought Rhyno & Tajiri were going to win.  But that damn flag screwed them.  I hate La Reistance's gimmick.  Their some gay french dudes.

Randy Orton v. Triple H  World Title

  Here is the granddaddy of them all.  Match of the year.  Triple H needed to win we need heels as our champions so it gets more exciting when faces challenge.  Back to the match.  You know the drill Evolution comes to aid HHH in his time of need.  They distract him long enough to Pedigree Orton onto a chair and pin him.",1099267200,3,1536,4.426470588235294

He was a bore and the ratings went into the toilet. Triple H is champ again and the ratings are back up. It's like a really bad soap opera that is predictable and mundane.

2067832,2,B00028G6P8,"What an average pay per view. It seems clear that from the list

of average list of ppvs from the WWE after Wrestlemania have

been average at best. As one fan on IMDB pointed out, the problem

is that there is special treatment given to such wrestlers

such as TripleH who married Stephanie McMahon and thus

people hitting himself together with Vince McMahon his father in law, to do as he pleases. In this case it involves Holding the title, while giving us one pitiful performance after another using sledgehammers and a chair when

a great opponent like Chris Benoit or others threaten him.

The other problem also stated is that each ppvs seems to

be just one long RAW or Smackdown episode with nothing really being resolved, such as the JBL vs Undertaker affair.

World Heavyweight Championship

Triple H vs Randy Orton

Average fight don't let the other reviews fool you. I am

one of a few people who predicted Orton would lose the title

right after Summerslam. Randy Orton was made the youngest

champ to remove Brock Lesnar of the histiry books plain and simple. Triple H with help from Evolution regains the title

and stops Orton's streak.

Shawn Michaels vs Kane

So so match. Kane is a stupid story with Lita being pregnant

(which she isnt) and she names Michaels his opponent for

revenge. A decent match, but Michaels is getting to old

for these beatings and still coming out the winner.

Chris Benoit & William Regal vs Ric Flair & Batista

Again so so match, Benoit should be wrestling for the title

against Orton, but instead hes jobbed into wrestling Evolution,

World Tag Team Championship

La Resistance vs Rhyno & Tajiri

Again one law RAW rivalry that went nowhere. La Resistance

is giving a threat by Rhyno and Tajiri, but they easily

take care of business.

Womens Championship

Trish Stratus vs Victoria

Interesting match, both Victoria and Trish are bonified sex

symbols on RAW, and they both can wrestle. Decent.

Overall an average ppv, no wonder no one forks over fifty

or thirty dollars for these mediocre ppvs. Taboo Tuesday

havent learned how to write up a good pay per view.",1098316800,3,2177,4.681697612732095

And by the way, HBK beat Benoit because of a distraction from HHH, at Backlash Benoit made HBK tap clean.

Onto the pay per view.

Benoit & Regal vs. Batista & Flair ~ **1/4

I enjoyed this for what it was but a lot of it was just punching and kicking. I would have rather seen Batista vs. Benoit instead, but it seems like the WWE is reluctant to give Batista a big singles match on pay per view.

Trish Stratus vs. Victoria (WWE Women's Title) ~ *

It was nice to see the women get a little bit more time but there just wasn't enough here to fill the 8 or so minutes it was given.

Steven Richards vs. Tyson Tomko ~ 0

Whichever WWE writer came up with this bright idea should be forced to wrestle Tomko for a year as punishment. Richards is a pretty underrated talent, he definitely deserves better than this.

Chris Jericho vs. Christian (Ladder Match, WWE Intercontinental Title) ~ **1/2

The bumps here were pretty impressive but there was nothing to sustain my interest in-between them. The match felt slow and plodding at times and the 'rest, bump, rest, bump' flow near the end didn't really help matters.

Shawn Michaels vs. Kane ~ ***1/4

The beginning of the match seemed to drag a bit but it certainly picked up at the end. Nice return for Michaels.

Tajiri & Rhyno vs. La Resistance (WWE Tag Titles) ~ *1/2

The match seemed to serve it's purpose but it was still disappointing. I wish the WWE would do something better with Tajiri, he's seriously the most underrated guy on the roster.

Randy Orton vs. Triple H (World Heavyweight Title) ~ *

Typical Triple H main event, a whole lot of nothing happens then a ref bump, interference etc. I'm able to tolerate this type of match more when Trip has a better opponent (i.e. Benoit, Michaels) but Orton is the cure for insomnia wrestling wise. Oh well, at least I don't have to see him with the title until Wrestlemania 21.

Another lackluster pay per view, but I can't say I was too enthusiastic going into it.",1097539200,,2233,4.4338235294117645

Madison Square Garden was like Shawn Micheals hometown everyone had so much respect for him (unlike you) there.

I'm going to bring up an instance ""David"". The battle in the desert on Monday Night Raw in June 2004. The second time the two had met one-on-one. Shawn Micheals put Chris Benoit down with the ""sweet chin music"", had it not been for Triple H, Micheals would've been the champion.

The first time the two met David was sometime in February on Raw Micheals put Benoit down for 3 with the ""sweet chin music"".

How do you like that David?

Sorry, guys I had to tell that buffoon off.

Matches are out of 5 stars and may not be in order.

Chris Benoit, William Regal vs. Batista, Ric Flair

This was a pretty exciting match, with all men giving their best, Benoit and Regal didn't work great as a team, (but of course, Benoit never works in a tag team situation ie: Edge) but they still won. Flair taps to Benoit ***1/2

Chris Jericho vs. Christian-Ladder Match for the Intercontinental Championship

Very good match. These two always put on a great match. You can hardly tell that Christian's hurt throughout the match. Lots of sick bumps Jericho takes it ****1/2

La Resistance vs. Rhyno , Tajiri-World Tag Team Championship

Kinda dull and slow paced not saying it's bad, though. Kinda good. La Resistance cheats to win again. **1/2

Shawn Micheals vs. Kane-No Holds Barred match

Superb, a little slow but it picks up in the end. Micheals is the greatest wrestler ever and carries someone who many think are uncarriable to a good match ****

Randy Orton vs. Triple H-World Hevyweight Championship

1. Ric Flair & Batista vs. Chris Benoit

Not a bad opener, but this is a RAW quality match.  I would have much rather seen Flair/Regal and Benoit/Batista.  Oh well.  Good star power to kick off the show.  (7/10)

2. Trish Stratus vs. Victoria (Women's Title)

Not bad for a woman's match.  Relatively long match.  (6/10)

3. Tyson Tomko vs. Steven Richards

Finally they revealed who the mystery woman was, although we all knew it was Richards.  Horrible, horrible match.  It may have been one of the worst matches I have ever seen.  (1/10)

4. Chris Jericho vs. Christian (Intercontinental Title/Ladder Match)

This match was for the vacant IC title, which was held by Edge who had to vacant it after an injury.  It most likely would have been Edge and Y2J in a straight up match.  Good match.  Not the best ladder match, but still very good.  Jericho actually wussed out on a couple of chances to take some good bumps.  Christian takes some crazy bumps, like he always does.  He doesn't get enough credit for some of the spills he has taken over the year.  Good ending.  Slow match, but exciting.  (8.5/10)

5. Kane vs. Shawn Michaels (No DQ)

HBK's return match after 3 months.  The match started out really slow, but really picked up towards the end.  I actually think the end of this match made it match of the night.  Great performance by both men.  (8.5/10)

6. La Resistance vs. Tajiri & Rhyno (World Tag Titles)

Not as good as I thought this match could be.  You pretty much get what you expect in this match.  Kind of a surprising ending.  (7/10)

7. Randy Orton vs. Triple H (World Heavyweight Title)

I was expecting a lot from this match, but didn't get what I expected.  It was still good, just not what I thought it would be.  Of course, Batista and Flair make appearances in the match.  Triple H delivers an amazing chair shot to the face of Orton.  Decent match.  (7.5/10)

2067847,4,B00028G6P8,"If you hate Triple H, you will not like this soon to be released DVD.  His match with Randy Orton was good and had an exciting ending, something we haven't seen in a long time with the ""roll-up"" and submission ending fever we have been dealt with so much.  Yes, Triple H becomes the nine time champion, only behind Hogan(12) and Flair (16), but I think he is a good champion and it is better to have a heal as champ so the fan favorites can try to knock him off the top.  The opening Ric Flair/Batista vs Benoit and Regal was a good opener.  The team of Benoit and Regal won for all you Benoit junkies.  Trish and Victoria was good as usual.  Tomko vs Steven Richards was a tad bit boring and should have been a 20 second squash instead of an actual match.  Christian and Jericho put on a great ladder match with many giant bump spots.  These two never give a bad show when together.  Shawn Michaels vs Kane was awesome.  No one can say Kane is not a good preformer.  His match with HBK was outstanding and full of back and forth action.  This is one of the best matches.  Worth the money alone in my opinion.  La Resistance vs Rhino and Tajiri was pretty expected and not all that great.  Not a terrible match, just not that great.  Really no reason to care about this match.  La Resistance seems like the only ""true"" tag team on raw anymore, so who knows when they will finally drop the belts.  Overall, I liked this ppv.  I am not a Benoit fan, and I was glad to see a new champ crowned on the last two ppv's.  I think it was good to shake things up and get the fans into something different for the next interactive ppv, Taboo Tuesday, Oct 19, 2004.

Benoit/Regal vs. Batista/Flair-This was a pretty solid 15 minute opener but it didn't have anything special or bad, it was just a solid match. Chris Benoit added some class into this match and did a great job entertaining. The exchanges between Flair and Benoit were also fun to watch.",1095465600,,538,4.546391752577319
2067849,3,B00028G6P8,"First of all ""A Kid's Review"", Shawn Michales was NEVER supposed to win the title at Wrestlemania 20, this was BENOIT'S night, Vince was always going to put the belt on him at Wrestlemania, what the hell is the point of slapping the title on a guy who no longer NEEDED it like Michales?

March 14th was all about the culimination of Benoit's journey, to win it any other way would be almost akin to winning a silver medal as opposed to a gold one.

Benoit is, and always will be, superior to Michales, and deserved to win at Wrestlemania.

On to the matches

1. Chris Benoit and William Regal vs Ric Flair and Batista: ***, grat opening tag team match here, Flair did pretty well and took some good bumps from Benoit, who allowed him some credible offesne, Batista just sucked here, why the hell is Benoit opening the PPVs again, he WAS champion last month after all.

2. Trish Stratus vs Victoria: ***1/2, good women's match, an unnecersary ending however with Victoria attacking Tyson Tomko, who ended up costing her the match.

3. Tyson Tomko vs Steven Richards: DUD, What the HELL was this crap? Obviously the WWE are trying to make J.B.L's matches look better than they have any right to be because THIS match is worse than any match I've seen in the company for a damn long time, Steven didn't get ONE fraction of offense and Tomko strippnig the guy was sickeing.

4. Chris Jericho vs Christian: ***, not as good as previous Ladder matches, sadly the match has been done to death on RAW so many times now it doesn't give us anything different, Jericho's bumps were sick, whilst Christian's bad back prevented any real risks from him, Jericho's ""seventh"" Intercontinental Championship win was just SAD, the guy doesn't need the championship anymore.

5. Shawn Michales vs Kane: ***1/2, blah match, not as good as most Michales fans would make you THINK it was because Michales can apparently do no wrong (despite having his own share of boring matches, such as Wrestlemania 12 and his matches with Triple H at Armageddon 2002, Royal Rumble 2004, and Bad Blood 2004) Kane got some good offense and was made to look more stronger, Michales wins with a super-kick.

6. Tajiri and Rhyno vs La Resistance: **1/2, a nothing match that doesn't know WHEN to begin or how to continue to reach the match ending, La Resitance win after using one of their flags for a weapon.

7. Tripe H vs Randy Orton: ***1/2, the interference made it a RAW match and not something you would reserve for a PPV, Orton was great here, but his short title reign might have been because the next RAW PPV is Taboo Tuesday and will give fans the oppertunity to vote for the next challenger for the World Championship.

Unforgiven was good, not as great as Backlash or Bad Blood, but better than Vengeance",1095206400,3,2776,4.59919028340081
2067850,4,B00028G6P8,"Let me begin by returning an argument to Matthew Hullman, who claims that Eddie Guerrero and Chris Benoit do not deserve the World Titles, and didn't deserve them in the first place.
Chris Benoit and Eddie Guerrero are two of the best wrestlers today, and both are better wrestlers than Triple H, Undertaker, The Rock and many other WWE greats. You think that Benoit and Guerrero aren't good enough, so that's why they didn't ever win the titles in their prime? Reality check pal, in their prime they both wrestled in a company called World Championship Wrestling, I'm sure you've heard of it? Now, if you can recall, this was the same company that gave the World Title to David Arquette, you know, the actor? Or should I say, the C grade celebrity? How many matches did David have? How much training did David have?
And I suppose that Kane should get the title real soon, because Vince feels sorry for him because he's been wrestling in the WWE for over 9 years under the names of Isaac Yenkem (The evil dentist gimmick) and Kane?
Vince doesn't feel sorry for wrestlers, he's a businessman. Guys like Davey Boy Smith and Test had gotten their time in the spotlight, but were they good enough to remain in that position? Uh-uh.
If you would have seen Kurt and Benoit's match at the Royal Rumble in 2003, you would have changed your mind about him. Or did you hate that match, huh? Would you rather see the Triple X movie starring Vin Diesel than a classic technical match? Watch that match, or gte his DVD if you wanna see 'REAL' wrestling...
Eddie Guerrero? When he won the WWE Title for the first time, did the crowd boo him? No! And did they boo him at WrestleMania XX? Noooo.... hell, did they boo him at Judgment Day 2003, when he put on the match of the night? No-diddly-O!
Speaking of the crowd, you say that Vince tells the people to cheer for Benoit and Eddie, and that's the only reason that they're cheered? Well call me crazy, but I don't think Vince enters the ring and says, ""Hey North Carolina, cheer Benoit for me tonight and I'll slash 40% off ticket prices!""
Benoit and Eddie were booed when they first entered WWE? If I recall, they were heels when they first entered, and if you don't know what a heel is, I guess I could put it as, the 'bad guy' character, you feel me?
Also, Benoit and Eddie both won their World Titles after being in the company for 4 years. Now that seems fair doesn't it? Two great wrestlers, 4 years of entertainment... put two and two together, eh? I mean, Austin was in the company for 2 years until he won it, Triple H took about 4 years, The Rock took about 2 or 3, and so on.

And also, Mr. ""Kid's Review"", as David Griffin Blyth stated - Benoit was always meant to win the title at WrestleMania XX, not HBK or Triple H. There is no way a heel would walk out the champion in what was considered the company's most important event in history, which is probably why HBK was added to the mix- so that it is less probable that Benoit could take his title. So 'Kid's Review', if you want to say things that you don't have a clue about, you're just going to get corrected.

Anyway, Unforgiven:

Intercontinental Championship- Ladder Match: Christian vs. Chris Jericho
Both guys are great wrestlers, Jericho being the better of the two. Very great match, and I expected it to be so.
****1/2

Women's Championship: Trish vs. Victoria
A decent match from the current best wrestlers in the WWE. Nothing too exciting.
** for normal match, *** for a women's

Benoit & Regal vs. Ric Flair & Batista
Batista is not the wrestler Evolution made him out to be (yet) and Regal & Flair are slower paced wrestlers. Benoit, on the other hand, is on the top of his game and shows some of it in this match. It's a decent tag match, and better than the Tag Title match later on, but don't expect too much.
***

Shawn Michaels vs. Kane
With Lita in his corner, Kane attempted to bring his A game to the legendary HBK. And uh, didn't. HBK is a great wrestler, even today, but Kane is just too sloppy and boring to be a maineventer, despite when he gets good hardcore matches... which could even be better because he's usually carried to a great match. Anyway...
***1/2

World Tag Team Championship: La Resistance vs. Tajiri & Rhyno
The storylines for this were poor, even though this match is about 1 and a half months in the making. Tajiri and Rhyno are put together for lack of creative tag team combinations, and the match was fairly tedious and sloppy, too.
**1/2

World Heavyweight Championship: Triple H vs. Randy Orton
Not as good as I expected from these two, but it was okay. Maybe they're conserving their skills for a major PPV, such as the Survivor Series in November. I can't explain much about this in detail, but it may be a watch or two if you're looking for a recent PPV.
***1/2

Overall, you may want to try before you, buy, but it has lived up to its RAW-only expectations.

1. World Heavyweight Championship: After the History of this match, this one should be intense, Orton is awesome as champ and needs more time to prove himself which is why he will win. After the rumors of the Evolution split something is going to backfire on H maybe?!

2. World Tag Team Championship: Rhyno & Tajiri vs. La Resistance (Robert Conway & Sylvain Greiner)(c)
I think Rhyno & Tajiri have rightfully deserved this title shot and are the only REAL team on Raw because im sick of seing Hurricane & Rosey vs. La Resistance all the time, but the French duo might sneak away with this one and keep thier fabulous reign.

3. Kane vs. Shawn Michaels Street Fight
This storyline is going nowhere and should just end soon. But beside the storyline this match should be awesome. I think Kane is going to win on behalf of Lita, maybe even a Lita heel turn who knows?

4. William Regal & Chris Benoit & Batista & Ric Flair
I have no idea why this match was made. Regal & Flair fought on RAW and then it was made into a tag match go figure. I hope this is a solid match and hopefully it won't be 6 minutes long. These four men have talent. Its been a while since they had a main eventers in a tag match. Ric Flair loses all his matches, and Benoit went from winning the World Title at Wrestlemania to teaming with a guy who came back from a serious injury, who comes back and manages a retard and then turns on him, then all of a sudden becomes his best friend. Evolution has been dominating RAW and Benoit & Regal want to prove that ther better, i guess.

5. Women's Championship
Trish Stratus(c) vs. Victoria
Both these Divas have really good matches Hopefully that Mystery Woman (Steven Richards) won't ruin the match completely. I Think Trish has this one.

6. Ladder Match for the Vacant Intercontinental Title: Chris Jericho vs. Christian

I have never seen a ladder match with one nights build up, This match was made on the RAW before Unforgiven. Also now the people eligible for the IC title are getting very, very rare. RAW needs more competitors and more air time. They will probably add a pointless match on HEAT to make seven, yeah seven matches. I think Christian will somehow win this one.

Why does everyone on here predict these crazy TLC,Hell in a Cell etc. The previous guy said ""Ghost"" and ""Rhino"" Matches wow what a loser man. You know nothing about wrestling do you? Yeah its fake so what its entertaining i could say everything you like sucks and is retarded but then you would probably be offended right. How would you feel if i wrote for the 2005 World Series was ""Babe Ruth's team vs. Jackie Robinsons team in a return from the dead match with Rhinos in the outfield you'd probably get mad wouldnt you?",1093564800,2,2739,4.455089820359281

8023725,2,B00028G6P8,"I know, I know. Bad pun. Really though, it's not a good PPV. Sure, there's a couple stand out matches like Kane vs. Shawn Michaels, Jericho vs. Christian, and Triple H vs. Orton, but they are all disappointments that just don't save this PPV at all. If there's one match I would truly recommend from this show, it's Christian vs. Jericho - Ladder match, and but that didn't live up to expectations. It's still good, but just not as good as it should have been. Funny thing is, I remember when I was 12 years old, and WWE was a new thing for me at the time(I started watching around Royal Rumble of that year) and I was hooked beyond belief. I wanted to see every PPV, and every show. Now I realize that some of the PPVs I wanted to see as a kid weren't that good, but SummerSlam 2004(my first PPV) was a good event to me back then, and even now as I watch it to this day. Plus, seeing Orton win his first World Championship live on PPV is a moment I'll always remember for the rest of my life. Sadly, I wasn't a fan of the attitude era, but I knew all the guys from that time period before I started watching anyway thanks to my friends. I've gone off topic. I don't recommend Unforgiven 2004 at all, but if you want to check it out, and it interests you enough, I guess you should.",1307145600,,1282,4.132
8023726,3,B00028G6P8,"Chris Benoit and William Regal VS Batista and Ric Flair: Batista was very green and did poorly in this match. Regal, Flair, and Benoit are three veterans who can put on a match but this match just plain sucked and was very boring at times.

Trish VS Victoria: Skiparoo

Tomoko calls out a mystery woman, who is Steven Richards in drag. JR and The King seem to be really bored with this, don't have any idea what to say, and then it becomes a match. Tomoko wins with an awesome finishing move but it wasn't really much of a match just a beat down with Richards not getting any offense in.

Christian VS Chris Jericho in a Ladder Match: Slow paced match that had some very good spots. The ending, like most of the card, was well done.

Kane VS Shawn Michaels: Just like the rest of the card, started out very slow and boring but the ending was well done.

A promo airs for Mr. Benjamin returning.

Tajiri and Rhyno VS La Resitance: I could carless for this match and unlike the rest of the matches, the ending just plain sucked.

Randy Orton VS Triple H: I wasn't looking foward to this match considering it's been replayed over and over again in the past few years. The ending saw Batista and Flair try to interfere but fail and a few refs gets taken out. Then Triple H pedigrees Orton on a chair and wins back the world title. Very good match and loved the ending.

Overall, the event was a mixed bag. The Ladder match and Kane/Michaels were slow paced but had good endings. The main event was really good.",1265328000,,1506,4.334519572953736
