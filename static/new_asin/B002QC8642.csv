8377662,2,B002QC8642,"There is no physical warm up, only ""spiritual warm-ups"" that involve the mind. It was odd to just jump into the workout without a warm - up.  Also, the workout seemed repetitive to me, althpugh I didn't mind the moves. Music was dated.",1442016000,,235,4.465116279069767

8377664,5,B002QC8642,"I thought this was a fun and effective weight-training workout using lighter weights. There is a modifier who does the segments without a step and who shows easier options for various moves, so a range of exercisers can use this DVD. Personally, I would rate it as solid intermediate.

You can choose to do the entire program, including the warmup, two strength segments, abs, and stretch and get a good total body workout in just over 50 minues. Or, you can choose one of the options below from the menu:

Workout 1
Workout 2
Abs & Core: (5 minutes)
Stretch: (4.5 minutes)

You can also choose to view 3 spiritual warmups: Joy & Contentment, Perfection, and Getting Results. Each of the segments is a few minutes long and offers encouragement on the topic of the spiritual warmup. I don't know if people who do not have a Christian viewpoint would enjoy them, but I thought they were well done, pragmatic, and helpful.

Tonya follows a pattern with the moves throughout the various segments. She will cue the move. Then, she will add pulses. Then, she'll just you hold it. Then, she does some more singles. I liked the pattern. Some of the reviews I have seen seemed to reflect that this pattern made the workouts repetetive for some people.

Personally, I really liked this DVD. I thought the workout flowed and I knew what she wanted me to do and I like Tonya's demeanor. I thought the modifier was good and I appreciated having her there.  Now that I have had some physical and fitness issues over the past year, I followed her quite a bit of the time.

Instructor Comments:
She is calm and encouraging and descriptive about what she wants you to do.",1423440000,2,1654,4.5864406779661016

8377667,5,B002QC8642,"I was really surprised with this dvd, I really enjoyed it, it is a good workout without coplicated moves.  I workout 7 days a week 3 days with weights, 2 days mediam intensity and 1 day low intensity and 1 day of body stretches. I couls really feel the burn with this one but it was fun. Time flew by with this one, Tonya is a great instructor.",1380585600,,344,4.0588235294117645
8377668,5,B002QC8642,"This DVD has 2 workouts to choose from. Tonya Larson is a good and encouraging instructor.
You do need a set of dumbbells in a variety of weights. You can use whatever weights you are comfortable with.
These are great overall workouts. The only negative was that I found it slightly repetitive in the pattern of the repetitions. A little more variety would have been nice, but then again, some days you just want to zone out when you exercise and not think too much! So this may not be a negative at all for someone else.",1364860800,2,521,4.381443298969073
