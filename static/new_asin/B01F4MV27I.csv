7743285,4,B01F4MV27I,"I preordered this item and was slightly disappointed when I received it because I realized the DVD just contains episodes already aired. I thought I'd be receiving a new, just released movie. It's still a great show though.",1475625600,2,223,4.894736842105263
7743286,5,B01F4MV27I,"The Lion Guard is the latest addition to the legacy of my all-time favorite Disney movie The Lion King, and it really delivers with its high quality animation, endearing characters and nicely written stories making it Disney Jr.'s best show so far.  There's only 6 episodes on this DVD, but most of them are good ones save for two.  This review will discuss each episode's synopsis and my take on them.  These episodes are not in order as they aired, but that's no big deal.  Without further ado here are the episodes:

Fuli's New Family (episode 7): When Fuli confesses that she spends her time alone, the rest of the Guard try to engage her in their activities, not aware that she actually enjoys being alone.  At the same time Bunga lets his immunity go to his head doing all sorts of crazy things.  This is my second favorite episode as it shows Fuli's character and struggle with solitude and need for support.  (A-)

Bunga the Wise (episode 3): After a terrible flood, the Guard fix up the problems and Bunga helps in one moment and Rafiki mentions that honey badgers are the smartest of animals.  So of course that notion goes to Bunga's head and gives bad advice, until one idea earlier becomes catastrophic....This episode is alright, just rough around the edges including the song which I felt uninspired and the bad ideas Bunga gives yields some either mildly amusing moments to non amusing moments, but at least the climax and ending save it from being awful.  I do like the idea that it gives us a break from usual villain skirmishes. (C+)

Eye of the Beholder (episode 5): During a confrontation with Janja and his clan, Ono gets an eye injury putting him out of action.  This gives Janja a plan to trap the Guard while they dine on zebra.  Nice episode with a good song (""Outta the way"") ranking up there with ""Be Prepared"" and the end will have you smiling for sure.  (B+)

Follow that Hippo! (episode 9): A group of young animals play Lion Guard and one of them, an elephant follows Beshte as his idol.  A sweet episode that becomes my third favorite as Beshte becomes a role model figure and with a nicely sung song to accompany it.  (A-)

The Search for Utamu (episode 8): Fuli feels her speed lets her accomplish anything that it ultimately tires her out.  At the same time Bunga is on the search for the rare Utamu grubs since these delectable insects bring fond, sentimental memories for him...This is an okay episode, the Fuli subplot feels contrived compared to Fuli's New Family, but the Bunga section is sweet for the revealing moment I won't say.  Kids will be sure to ""eat"" the song right up.  (C)

Never Judge a Hyena by Its Spots (episode 1): Kion gets lost in the Outlands while chasing Janja and his clan and meets Jasiri (voice by The Fosters' Maia Mitchell) a friendly female hyena who guides him through the Outlands and even aids him in battle as well.  This is my personal favorite episode of the bunch as Jasiri is a great character alongside Kion and the song ""SiSi Ni Sawa"" never gets old, and the battle they have is amazing.  (A)  Note: This episode was nominated for the 2016 Humanitas award (lost to Sophia the First)",1474848000,8,3161,4.550442477876106

7743288,4,B01F4MV27I,"Lion Guard is the latest continuation of the Lion King story and honestly the best series Disney has put on their DisneyJr Block/Channel so far.  The animation is solid and the writing is usually pretty good.

  As for this DVD release, I am kind of dissapointed it is just abunch of episodes slapped together out of order, it feels rushed and lazy on Disney's part.  I mean the last episode on the disc is actually the first of the season.  But I realize this collection is more aimed at kids then older animation fans.  Overall I would say buy this to support the show, but hopefully Disney will put out a proper season set in the future.",1474588800,8,640,4.418803418803419

7743294,4,B01F4MV27I,"An Excellent Way to introduce anyone to the adventures of the Lion Guard. Despite being a show targeted at Preschoolers This series (set within the time frame of Lion King 2) does nothing to alienate The Adult fans of The Lion King. The only knock against this DVD is that the episodes are not in their chronological order. That won't be a problem to anyone in the age group of this show's target audince, as all episodes are self contained. As an adult fan of this show I find that fact annoying.",1489968000,4,497,4.413043478260869
