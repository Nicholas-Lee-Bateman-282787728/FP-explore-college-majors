7223129,1,B00YOJIDBQ,Season 1 was good and kept the viewer interested.  This season was so bad it makes md cringe.  From jumping from present day to 30 years into the futue (with about half the old cast in one time and half in another) to using bizarre music to try to be clever or eerie (or whatever they were trying to do).  Regardless the whole thing is stupid and a waste of time not to mention having paid for it.  Bravo Syfy for cancelling this dog...but I hope you remember how bad the writers and actors/dirdctors were and don't usd them again.,1438992000,2,531,4.28
7223130,2,B00YOJIDBQ,"I'm a huge lover of sci-fi.  I enjoyed season 1 of this program, although the ending was unsatisfying.  The second season is very bad,  The writers must be determined to leave the viewers depressed because in this series the bad guys mostly go unpunished and the real bad guys (the Alaria Corp.) seemingly win in the end.  I say seemingly because the end of season 2 is confusing and nonsensical.  Call me old fashioned, but I like the good guys (or justice, if you will), to win in the end.  For most of both seasons, especially 2, the viewer suffers as the good guys (or, again, justice) takes a constant beating and then, in the end, through the confusion, pretty much loses altogether.  Most excellent sci-fi programs like Fringe or the X-Files I will re-watch from time to time, but not this one. Never again!",1438819200,4,814,4.572413793103448
7223131,2,B00YOJIDBQ,Season one was great up until the last few episodes.  Season two is just plain dumb.  Bummer to have to be so harsh but we were bummed that we bought it and that doesn't happen often.  I'm not sure what happened but they definitely lost some good writers along the way.  Too bad as it could have been a great series.,1438300800,6,316,4.131147540983607
7223132,2,B00YOJIDBQ,"I watched this on Syfy (saw the 1st one there too) unlike season one it just never got good. With out giving away any spoilers, I felt confused for the most part for like the first 5 episodes (don't know if thats what they wanted) but it just never got good, yeah it had its moments here and there but overall the acting I felt was bad like they were all depressed and got no sleep then went to work and started filming this, the story was bad (did not even really tie in to the 1st season), and the tone of the show went from a cool Out Break style Syfy movie to a dark psychological horror film (like they did mid way through season 1). Oh and the ending you will be like ""What!!???"" it makes no sense. I kinda liked the 1st season but cant say the same for this one. Glad it won't get a third season.",1434499200,5,803,3.9937888198757765
7223133,5,B00YOJIDBQ,"Why Syfy didn't renew this phenomenal series is totally beyond me.  This show is so unique and different.  It kept me on the edge of my seat every single episode.  I especially enjoyed the unique music that seemed to always be 180 degrees off from the type of music you would normally hear for the graphic scenes the music was paired with.  As one reviewer called it, this show is ""Bat S*** Crazy!"".  That reviewer nailed it.  And the teaser for season 3 at the end of season 2 looked absolutely spectacular.  I do not understand why this show was axed when yet 12 Monkey's was renewed.  I think the powers that be at Syfy must have contracted one of the Narvic virus strains from this show!  Such a shame.  But at least season 2 is getting a Blu-ray release.  Every time I hear the word ""helix"" mentioned in any context, I immediately think of this show and feel very saddened by it's untimely demise.  I really wish there would be enough of a public backlash to make Syfy reconsider their extremely poor decision to cancel this ground breaking show.",1433635200,31,1051,4.473684210526316
7223134,3,B00YOJIDBQ,Not quite as dark and gripping as the first season.  The jumping back and forth between two distinct time periods (and two distinct stories) gets to be a confusing distraction.,1463702400,2,176,4.866666666666666
7223135,4,B00YOJIDBQ,loved season one.. was interested in where they were going in season 2.. despite the change of local they kept close to the isolated feeling of the previous season,1458172800,2,163,4.655172413793103
7223136,5,B00YOJIDBQ,"this is such a neat show, many twists, hoping for a season 3",1457395200,,60,3.6923076923076925

7223138,5,B00YOJIDBQ,please let me know if there will be a season 3  i do not want to miss it ..  Thanks  Dave Savage,1450915200,,96,3.272727272727273
7223139,5,B00YOJIDBQ,Honestly this show kept me hooked from the beginning. I actually loved the suspense and crazy ideas behind everything! I honestly watch everything on Netflix so I never looked into it until it was on Netflix. Then I realize not enough views? Come on give this show a chance to grow! Thais show was amazing and now I am having withdrawals that won't be fixed unless I am certain season 3 is on its way!,1450828800,,401,4.36
7223140,5,B00YOJIDBQ,I am so very excited to watch this season  I really liked the 1st season and I am very happy that there is another season to watch!!!!,1446768000,,134,3.962962962962963
7223141,5,B00YOJIDBQ,Unusual TV series from Syfy it touches all bases at first I thought it was related to zombies but it's a totally different series,1446508800,,129,4.416666666666667

7223151,3,B00YOJIDBQ,This was getting good....then some ass bite decided to cancel with no ending. Just for that I want my money back. Only after I received the 2nd season did I find this out. Should never have ordered it. Service for items is great.,1440720000,9,229,4.348837209302325

7223153,5,B00YOJIDBQ,"This was unabashed pandering to the conspiracies of global elitists, UN Agenda 21, population control and survivalists.  While I enjoyed the violent war to reduce world population by disease vs. sterilization (OMG), I kept wondering why, unless elitists were behind the story, they hadn't caused this series to disappear!  After all, if the greater population actually read AGENDA 21 published by the United Nations, they would be feeling very uneasy right now.  It certainly wouldn't do to let the cat out of the bag...too many high-profile billionaires want world population reduced below 1 billion, so there are only enough mindless servants to tend to their paradise.  Sniff around the internet, it isn't hard to find backfround.",1439164800,2,733,5.293103448275862

The theme music is abysmal.",1501459200,,70,4.384615384615385
8718600,3,B00YOJIDBQ,Not as good as season one. Confusing at times and takes a while to catch on. Gets better as the series evolves. Steven Weber is excellent.,1500768000,,138,4.346153846153846
8718601,3,B00YOJIDBQ,it has allot of potential wish they would have given it a season three,1483228800,,70,4.071428571428571
8718602,2,B00YOJIDBQ,"Just finished this tonight. Season one was by far much better than the muddled and confusing mess that season two was. I went in to season two (DVD's from Netflix) knowing that SyFy had cancelled the show and we'd never see a third year, and I was fine knowing there would not be an ending .... but if I could do it over again I would not have watched this second year with its 13 chapters of time-jumping shenanigans and ridiculously villainous villains (in this world, the good guys are not just rare, but a scant one or two at most). Most of this story in season two is bad people seeking revenge on each other, and that gets tedious quickly.

The gist here is that if you've seen season one and are highly curious about the rest of the plot, you could try season two ... just don't expect something as taut and engrossing as the first go-round at the arctic station, and do not by any means expect things to make much sense. You will be left with scads of questions and not much satisfaction.",1471564800,,996,4.32620320855615
8718603,5,B00YOJIDBQ,Everything was great!,1471305600,,21,6.333333333333333
8718604,2,B00YOJIDBQ,"Yet another sci-fi show that got far too clever for its own good. Season 1 was OK, it kept your interest and had pretty well defined good guys and bad guys. Add in some unique science, curiosity, suspense and the flavor of the day (zombies), plus a couple red herrings, now bring to a slow boil and you had Helix Part 1 - Not bad. For season 2 modify the recipe some, throw in a very non-linear plot line that skips around for 30yrs, add preposterous coincidences, some bizarre characters and unbelievably stupid mini-plots, now bring it all to a boil and, Oh No, it came out all wrong and made a mess. Sort of like its big ideas, Season 2 just dissolved into a putrid mess like the joyful Nazi faces in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Afterwards we felt sort of hoodwinked that we watched this mess hoping for a better payoff that unfortunately never really came. I felt ""Used"" in the end. I felt like strangling the writers/directors/producers for perpetrating this pseudo-science preposterous crap on us. Let's put them in jail and use a random number generator for them to shift in time and try to guess what day we will let them out. And make them watch Helix Season 2 (running it backwards and forwards) forever and a day!",1470873600,,1221,4.479820627802691
8718605,1,B00YOJIDBQ,"When I disregard all of the contrived excuses that the intellectually challenged die hard fan base of Helix made for the series; therefore, I have to be honest and admit, ""THIS SERIES TOTALLY SUCKED ASS!"" Thanks to a merciful God it was cancelled! Moreover, the principal writers, directors, and producers must have come from the Pleistocene Epoch. Specifically, the series use of ancient musical history elevator and pop/ disco music that my grandfather would have found appealing; since, he emerged from the Primordial Ooze of the sixties and seventies. Maybe the rationale was that most of the thematic music is so old that it wouldn't cost the producers residual payments to the Dinosaurs who originally wrote and performed this music; thereby, infesting the series soundtrack with public domain music that  is heard primarily in grocery stores and strip malls. Moreover, did Billy Campbell fall of the shallow edge of the gene pool? I've never seen someone age so rapidly or badly. Maybe he's a chronic alcoholic? Perhaps he should have taken some of the Helix formula earlier on; since, he looks and talks like Kharis the Mummy from an old Boris Karloff movie. Although, the hot chick female cast members provide compensatory ""eye candy"" fo reward the audience for sitting through one of Billy Campbell's inane and pedestrian performances that he calls acting. In summation, I've read better story lines and plot twists; than. Helix off the backs of comic books! Moreover, it looks like some of the writing staff had previously been employed writing ads and ingredients for the backs of soup cans! Too bad Gene Roddenberry is no longer with us. Furthermore,  even Roddenberry's lesser works, scripts, and compositions look like Shakespeare; when, one engages in comparison with the scripts for Helix. Unfortunately, Helix may continue to haunt the viewing public in reruns on HULU (i.e., the Dumping Ground for Abysmal, Defunct, and Failed TV series). One asks the rhetorical question, ""Why was this series made in the first place. Furthermore, who were the sixties burn out acid freaks that dreamed up this aberration in defiance of  all logical thought and plausibility?""",1470355200,,2179,5.149717514124294
