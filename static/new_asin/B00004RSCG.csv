1345510,4,B00004RSCG,"I enjoyed this movie.  Luftwaffe pilot Franz von Werra's escape attemps, while a bit over simplified, appear to be very accurate.  The movie ends when von Werra reaches the U.S., even though there was much more to the real story.  It's a shame the full details of his return to Germany could have not been included.

 Hardy Kruger is excellent in his role as von Werra.  The remainder of the cast, both British and Germans, are not remarkable.

Persons interested in WWII will enjoy the movie, and find that it's well worth the purchase price.",1214352000,,543,4.652631578947369
1345511,5,B00004RSCG,"Hardy Kruger gives an outstanding portrayal of a WWII German Aviator captured and determined to escape by any means.

The intensity of Kruger's effort to escape makes this one of the best movies of its kind. Right up there with ""The Great Escape""",1149465600,16,246,4.72093023255814

1345529,4,B00004RSCG,"This is a really excellent film, full of suspense and it's well worth watching despite its age. In fact, its age turns to be quite an advantage, since the characters, the surroundings, the behaviors, people's langauge and manners, the military hardware and the aircraft are very realistic, looking almost authentic. Modern films are impossible to replicate the World War II era in such a beautiful and credible way despite all the special effects and the big budgets of the current productions. Moreover, the film is based on a true story and this adds to it extra value and makes it a really terrific experience. It loses one star because sometimes the dialogues between British interrogators and von Werra become rather naive - like when the German pilot is asked about his unit and he refuses sternly to answer that, even though his unit's emblems were quite obvious for everyone to see them on his plane which crash-landed on British soil but suffered only minor damage.

Oberleutnant Franz von Werra of the Luftwaffe became a hero after his dramatic escape from Canada. Adolf Hitler granted him the coveted Knights Cross and he was tasked to improve German interrogation techniques for captured pilots based on his own experience with the British system. Von Werra reported to the German High Command on his treatment as a POW, and this improved the treatment of POWs in Germany. He wrote a book based on his experiences entitled ""Meine Flucht aus England"" (My Escape from England) although the manuscript remained unpublished. After his return to Germany, von Werra was initially deployed to the Russian front where he was able to raise his tally to 21 aerial victories during July 1941. In early August 1941 his unit withdrew to Germany to re-equip with the new Bf 109F-4 and moved to Katwijk in the Netherlands. On 25 October 1941 von Werra took off in a Bf 109F-4 on a practice flight. He suffered engine failure and crashed into the sea north of Vlissingen and was killed. His body was never found.",1409529600,,2008,4.854227405247814

1345541,5,B00004RSCG,"Technically speaking, the two faults I find are in the opening scene.  After Oberleutnant Franz von Werra crashes his Bf109E (Emil), the canopy opens up hinged on the port side, rather than starboard, which is correct.  He then pulls out a Walther HP/P.38 before surrendering.  The Walther 9mm Parabellum HP and P.38 were in very limited production before 1941, and would not be carried by the Jagdflieger.  Air crew, on bombers like Heinkel 111, had room on board for Lugers and the Stahlhelm, but not one who had to squeeze into the tight office (cockpit) of the 109.  A 7.65mm would have been more like it, if carried at all, during the Battle of Britain.  Now the Russian Front was another matter.  The movie is well done, as a rule, but Germans do not speak English amongst themselves, and when they do speak German in the film, subtitles for non-German speakers would have been useful.  Having read the book of the same title, I was pleased with the movie, and Hardy Krueger was his usual competent self.  I think it would have been a nice touch to show von Werra with a Pilot's Badge (Fliegerabzeichen)and the EK II (Iron Cross 2nd class), and mention the fact he was awarded the Knight's Cross upon his return to Germany.  The fact how he died was not explained, which was in the same manner as Hans-Joachim Marseille.  The engine caught fire in flight, smoke filled the cockpit, and von Werra and his new Bf109G (Gustav) took a plunge into the North Sea.",1372032000,,1463,4.61003861003861
1345542,3,B00004RSCG,"Swiss-born, Franz von Werra was the only German PoW to escape and make his way back to fight again.

The film is a true story, based on the book of the same name, and follows the historical account very closely. I read that book years ago.

The film is shot in 1950s style with few special effects. The opening scene shows a Messerschmitt model sliding along at about 20 mph. It doesn`t look much like a Bf-109E crash landing at 150 mph.

Don`t be put off, as the real suspense comes from this Luftwaffe fighter pilot`s harrowing escapes. After becoming a fighter ace all over again on the Russian front, with a total of 21 confirmed victories, von Werra disappeared on a routine flight. All of this took place before America was in the war.",1369094400,,741,4.474074074074074
1345543,5,B00004RSCG,"This is an excellent War movie starring Hardy Krger as a German Flight Officer who was shot down over England in 1940 and tried numerous times to escape which is based on a true story of Oberleutnant Franz von Werra. This movie is presented in Widescreen, B&W and runs for about 106mins (1hr 46mins). This movie also stars; Colin Gordon, Michael Goodliffe, Terence Alexander, Jack Gwillim, Alec McCowen, plus others!

1345545,5,B00004RSCG,"This is the amazing, true story of Franz Von Werra, the only German to escape from a British POW camp and return to fight again in Germany.  (Unfortunately, we learn this in the opening credits, so a lot of suspense is spoiled right off.)

As Werra, Hardy Kruger is handsome, charismatic, and a good actor.  His experiences make being a POW look like going to scout camp but with better food and less supervision. It seems odd that Britain would make a movie with a German hero and fairly incompetent Brit guards so soon after WWII, but he is quite endearing and I was rooting for him.

It is a thrilling and enjoyable story and inspired me to read about the real Von Werra. Recommended.",1365638400,,687,4.472
1345546,5,B00004RSCG,"This is a WWII story for adults. No one dies in this movie. In fact, I cannot recall a single bullet being fired in the whole movie. If you're looking for just an action movie, this isn't for you. The story itself is what is so great. This movie is the true story of the escape of Franz von Werra, the only German pilot prisoner of war to escape from captivity. Based on the internet research that I've been able to do, the movie is a very factual account of von Werra's efforts. You really do wind up rooting for the ""bad guy"" in this movie.  The movie is black and white.  Also, there is no musical soundtrack, but you don't miss it. The one strange part about the movie is that when you turn on the English subtitles so you can know what the German prisoners are saying to each other, the movie shows English subtitles for the British soldiers speaking English too.",1351123200,2,868,4.286585365853658
1345547,5,B00004RSCG,"THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY is an excellent and enthralling film recounting the story of the only German POW who successfully escaped British containment during World War II and returned to Germany. Starring a youngish Hardy Kruger, the film recounts the story of Luftwaffe ace, Franz von Werra, whose derring-do is excitingly portrayed by a stellar English cast. THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY is part of an ongoing series of fine and well-made English films that VCI Entertainment is releasing. Let me also call attention to THE MALTA STORY, with Sir Alec Guinness, and director Carol Reed's masterpiece, THE WAY AHEAD---a true treasue trove of fine films worth investigating. Highly recommended.",1342483200,2,683,5.162162162162162
1345548,4,B00004RSCG,"If you liked ""The Great Escape"" or ""The Colditz Story,"" here's another World War II escape film, made in the UK in 1957.  In this film, however, it's a Luftwaffe pilot who escapes from a POW camp in England.  Sent to Canada after he is recaptured, he escapes across the frozen St. Lawrence River to the United States.

It's a satisfying film.  Hardy Kruger well plays the role of Franz von Werra.  (You can find out more about von Werra from the Wikipedia article that traces his whole career.)  Some of the B&W photography of the English countryside is wonderfully composed.

1345549,5,B00004RSCG,"I did not find myself hoping he would succeed but I admire his tenacity.

What motivated the Brits to make a film celebrating the success of a German escapee?  It seems like German Intelligence would have been pretty uncomfortable with Franz von Werra story when he showed up in Germany.  Too incredible.  Britain loved their spies & turncoats.  Any chance the Germans thought he was too much of a risk and facilitated his demise?",1310428800,,430,4.756756756756757
1345550,5,B00004RSCG,"I liked when the POW crossed the St. Lawrence and landed in Ogdenburg, USA.
The border patrol agent  should have said, Ogdenburg, NY , because the POW crossed the US border at Ogdenburg,NY .
Hardy Krueger did a great job acting, nobody could play that part but him. From start to finish, this movie was great.
Ever been to Ogdenburg NY ? I went up there once, I went on a fishing trip near Ogdenburg . Its close to Fort Drum. Its right above the Adirondacks and the winters are brutal.

1345559,4,B00004RSCG,A very different film in as much as the hero is a shot down German pilot in World War 2 Britain. This pilot actually got away in real life from the prison camp and returned to Germany. A touch of British fair play here. Someone who tried against impossible odds and got away. Almost a shame in real life he was killed in action later in the war. An interesting and engaging film. Worth being in anybodies dvd collection.,1287100800,,420,4.329113924050633

1345562,5,B00004RSCG,"THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY is an exciting WWII film that is based on Kendal Burt's book detailing the real life exploits of Swiss born Franz von Werra, a German pilot who is captured by the British when his plane crashes. Von Werra is played with a muted but still smug swagger by Hardy Kruger,a favorite of mine since SUNDAYS AND CYBELE (LES DIMANCHES DE VILLES D'AVRAY) which won the Oscar for Best Foreign film in 1962. The pilot's sole goal is to be assigned to a POW camp so he can go about the business of escaping, the Brits however, are more concerned with trying to pry information out of him--even going so far as to suggest that his well-known heroics might be all so much fakery and they will expose his deceit to the other German prisoners. No go, he ain't buying it even though what they say may very well be true. He simply doesn't care.

 Finally they give up and he's sent to a camp from which he quickly attempts an escape but is just as quickly captured and shipped off to another camp. At the second camp the escape is more organized a la THE GREAT ESCAPE but with much the same results for von Werra. And so it goes until he is shipped off to Canada with other escape prone Germans, where he makes his final bid for freedom. The fact that this film was made so soon after the end of WWII is surprising and the fact that Kruger can still makes us feel so much empathy for his character and genuinely make us hope for him to succeed is a testament to both Kruger's abilities as an actor and to the writers and to director Roy Ward Baker. Don't forget to read the epilogue and find out what happened to von Werra after he left Canada! Its very ironic.",1241136000,5,1664,4.246056782334385
1345563,2,B00004RSCG,A typical world war II propoganda style film being made just prior to our entry into the war and in the same vein as that of the Purple Heart film made right after our surprise bombing of Tokyo.  The film is based on a true story of a escaped german wwII prisoner setting his sights on the then nuetral USA.  An OK film.,1239321600,,320,4.063492063492063
1345564,4,B00004RSCG,"In this film Kruger plays a Luftwaffe pilot (von Wirra) who is shot down over England. He is determined to make it back and fight again and his attempts to escape ultimately lead to his distinction as the only German pilot to return to combat after being held as a POW of the British. The suspense is not as dramatic as in other films but perhaps a bit more realistic. At one point he even makes it to the cockpit of a Hurricane! An interesting movie, filmed in black and white. WWII movies always seemed more real to me when they are in black and white.",1236038400,,554,4.235849056603773
1345565,5,B00004RSCG,"I have to say I first discovered Hardy Kruger in a main title role in The One That Got Away and after seeing him in this I have to say he is definitely the handsomest, most attractive man in the entire cosmos. He was unbelievably gorgeous in The One That Got Away. I felt so sorry for him though what he had to go through in that movie, trying his best to escape the British through all the stepping stones he encountered trying to get to a neutral nation. It made me want to just jump in the film and help him and even stay with him forever. I really would have loved to have joined him any day on such an escaping adventure. Everytime I watch this film I always imagine me aiding him in his escape and having him carry me in the rain and the freezing snow and assuring him that he'd really get away, that I loved him and that I would have stayed with him forever. Hardy is the most beautiful man to me and he forever will be.",1234742400,4,927,4.043478260869565
1345566,5,B00004RSCG,"THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY belongs to the rather small genre of films that show the Second World War from the German perspective.  Unlike films like DAS BOOT and THE DESERT FOX, which tended to present the war from the collective focus of a combat arm of the German Army, THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY is presented solely from the vantage of one man, Oberleutnant Franz Von Werra of the Luftwaffe, who, in 1940 was shot down over England and was taken prisoner.  The plot is rather straightforward.  Von Werra refuses to remain in a POW camp and spends the bulk of the film in attempting to escape.  Eventually he does as he returns to Germany and is hailed as a hero by Hitler, is promoted to Kapitan, and is awarded the Iron Cross.

What marks the film as remarkably entertaining is a combination of efforts ranging from the bravura performance of Hardy Kruger as Von Werra to the sure directing of Roy Ward Baker and finally to the gritty and clammy weather that figured so prominently in the plot that the snow, ice, and sleet virtually insinuated themselves as a subtext against which Von Werra battled incessantly.  First, with Kruger's interpretation of Von Werra--it was difficult not to sympathize with him, then later to root for him.  Kruger spoke excellect if accented English, was boyishly handsome, was possessed of an incredible sense of self that would not admit of failure, and ultimately had that ever so rare sense of timing that inevitably led to success.  Regardless of his situation, he could immediately size up who was present and using nothing more than bluster and instinct could manipulate both man and machine for his own ends.  Kruger fails in his first two attempts, and at each recapture, you can practically hear the ""twang"" in his head as he mentally reviews his failure and plots his next escape. He even can boast to his English jailer that he will bet cognac against cigarettes that he will succeed in less than six months.

It is not only Kruger as Von Werra that marks this film as extraordinary. The English who capture him and hold him prisoner are a thoroughly unimaginative lot, totally devoid of a sense of humor that makes Von Werra by contrast seem a shining presence.  His pursuers are a dogged group of soldiers who succeed in capturing him only because of some bad luck on Von Werra's part. Further, though Von Werra is a Luftwaffe ace, he is no Nazi.  In fact, his relation to the Nazi party is downplayed as is his relation to the general war effort.  The focus of the film is exclusively on one man versus the System.  The fact that the System is the British POW camp leadership is beside the point. Not many films would dare attempt to make a German the hero when to do so is to threaten to throw its balance off center.  That the audience can momentarily not be concerned with being off balance is a tribute to a film that is a true classic of the escape genre.",1234396800,,2901,4.551923076923077
1345567,5,B00004RSCG,"This is one of those movies that make you realize there was more than just one side in WWII.

Hardy Krueger plays an excellent role.  Remember him from ""The Flight of the Phoenix,"" with Jimmy Stewart?  Unlike his character in that movie, he plays a much more flamboyant figure in ""The One That Got Away.""

In an age where Hollywood glorifies Americans as being the only independent & courageous people on the planet, it is nice to see a little redress.  Except for ""Letters From Iwo Jima,"" I can't think of another movie that reminds us there are always men on the other side who fight & die for their country.

That brings us to the crux of the matter: Hollywood.  Neither ""The Boat,"" originally released as ""Das Boot,"" or ""The One That Got Away"" was produced in America.  If you want a fresh perspective on events - past and present - try looking at foreign made films.

Another reason to recommend this movie: There are no politics involved; simply the drama of one man's ordeal.  Considering it was made in 1957 that is something!

The B&W in which it is shot also adds a sense of life & death drama - which it is.  If you like movies that are true-to-life (as opposed to make-believe), or you enjoyed ""The Boat"" with Jurgen Prochnow, then this is one you will enjoy seeing.

I would love too see a remake - although not by Hollywood!",1215302400,19,1338,4.434426229508197

7921666,5,B00004RSCG,"I liked a lot this little known, courageous and atypical 1957 war movie. It will certainly delight all amateurs of good cinema. Below, more of my impressions, with some LIMITED SPOILERS.

This film follows quite faithfully the TRUE war time exploits of a real Luftwaffe pilot, Oberleutnant Franz von Werra. In the opening scene of the film his Messerschmitt Bf 109 is shot down in the middle of Battle of Britain and he is himself taken prisoner. As the title says it openly, he will attempt to escape from captivity - many times. This film describes his adventures, fortunes and misfortunes during those efforts.

In most of my reviews of films inspired by real events I put some description of the historical facts, but here I simply cannot do it, because it would give away almost all the plot of the film. I can only say, that this film is really well done, sticking very much to the real story and trying to recreate as closely as possible the very peculiar universe of allied camps for Axis POWs in the first years of war. As most POWs flicks, this is a war film withour any real fighting, but there is nevertheless a lot of suspense and drama. Nothing more will be said.

This is mostly a one-man show as German actor Hardy Kruger, who plays von Werra, monopolises most of the screen time. Kruger knew quite well the topic, as he was himself a former POW. Conscripted at age of 16 into Wehrmacht in 1944, he was in March 1945 transferred to 38 SS Division ""Nibelungen"" and participated in the last fights against US forces advancing into Germany. Taken prisoner by Americans at the end of war he tried to escape three times - the third time he succeeded and went back home. He was then barely 17 years old. It might be this experience that allowed him to portray a cocky, defiant POW with such intensity in this film.

I really, really liked this film as the scenario is strong, dialogs are good and the main ""hero"", albeit arrogant and serving an abominable regime, ultimately forces some respect by his courage, determination, endurance of hardships and dignity. A well done description of a quite unique human adventure and of an exceptionnal display of a soldier's honour. I will definitely keep my DVD for another viewing. ENJOY!",1439337600,,2241,4.63727959697733
