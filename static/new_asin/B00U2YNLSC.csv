8704181,3,B00U2YNLSC,"Bobby Blue Day (James Wilder) is a former Hollywood script writer with director Steven Worthy in his cell phone. He teaches script writing. John F. Kennedy Ariamehr (Zuher Khan) hands Bobby a script that is clearly not his. The story of the script appears to be reflected on the screen.

The film used unrealistic characters that were well portrayed by the actors. We never had a protagonist to cheer on. The main plot takes place in a small apartment as our two guys negotiate over the script. The action comes in flashbacks until the end when things continue on the path of improbability. Rebecca Mae Palmer supplies us with limited eye candy as the air headed girl friend.

The film starts out with a soundtrack that makes you think it is a thriller while it shows you a picture of a train, bridge and a guy twirling a sign. The action is light and the film moves slow like an indie drama. Not a bad film, but not one I would pay to watch.
