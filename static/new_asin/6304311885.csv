838125,1,6304311885,"Lame dumb jokes my grandma said when she was 7 years old. No good plot- line. And the cast is unbearable. Having rosie-odonnel and her lame jokes is cheesy enough to give this movie 2 stars. If there was zero stars as an  option, I defanitly would pick that. P.S. I fell asleep 15 minutes into the  movie, don't waste your time and money on this film that looks like a  monkey put together. I reccommend good burger if your looking for good nick  movies. But don't pay attention to this crap",946771200,4,491,4.304347826086956
838262,2,6304311885,"Spoiler Alert....

This movie is one of those movies that should have remained a distant memory. I remember liking it when I watched it many years ago, but now that I'm all grown up, I am way less impressed. I'm usually not one for taking things so seriously, but I can see why parents would definitely have a problem with the message that this movie sends.

For one thing, this movie is boring as hell, I noticed that absolutely NOTHING happened until over an hour in. Secondly, Harriet was just not a very likable little girl. She's stalking people on the streets and writing untrue things about them. She wrote nasty things about her teacher. She wrote nasty things about all of her classmates and her ""friends"" which causes her to be ostracized, and rightfully so.

I really felt bad for Sport, because had she been a ""real"" friend she never would have wrote anything like that about him, or his father, just because she loaned him a dollar. Then when she got caught, instead of apologizing, she has the nerve to turn around and try to get revenge on them for her ostracism. Are you kidding me? Don't get me wrong, I didn't like Marion Hawthorne either, but Harriet wasn't much better. She put up embarrassing pictures of Sport all over the school. She cut off Laura's entire ponytail, which was abysmal. She drew all over Beth Ellen's pictures. She ruined Janie and Pinkey's projects. She put Carrie's bra up on the school's flagpole. She put Marion's estranged relationship with her father on blast in front of everyone. All while crossing their names off her desk like a hit-list. And all indicative behavior of a true MEAN GIRL.

If that wasn't enough, she never offers any real apologies. Apologizing to people through a door does not equal a heartfelt apology. And in the end, everybody forgives her way too soon and turns around and elects her to be over the school newspaper. Again, are you kidding me? Not realistic at all. True enough, she wrote about the notebook incident in her first article, but by then it was too late and I just didn't care anymore. I would have appreciated it more if I thought she learned anything substantial from her behavior, or if she displayed some type of redeeming qualities like going to her friends and classmates and giving them the apologies they deserved. Although, I don't see exactly how you can make up for chopping more than half of someone's hair off. Then again, why would she do the right thing when Golly told her to lie? In other words, what I said was true, but I'll lie in order to make you feel better. What kind of advice was that?

On top of all that, Harriet was disrespectful and defiant. The way she spoke to her parents would have earned an @ss-whooping where I grew up, especially when she proceeds to talk back incessantly, stomp off while her parents are still talking to her, and even throws a notebook at her parents. When they take her notebook, she has the audacity to tell them she'll just get another one. None of this is good. They got no apologies either for her spoiled, bratty behavior.

Parents... KEEP YOUR CHILDREN FAR AWAY FROM THIS ONE!!

Note** Rosie O'Donnell's performance was the least of the problems with this movie.",1481500800,,3209,4.6192982456140355

This is one of my top childhood movies of all time. I was obsessed with this movie back when I was in the 6th grade. its just such a good story and its interesting how Harriet continues to go through her passion of been a writer but at the same times looses that when a bully from school reads her journal out loud. You see the paths that she takes on dealing with this and see the consequences. Its a very interesting movie with a lot of detail of the lives of the neighborhood that she lives in.

I saw this movie at the library and the Amazon reviews looked pretty good. I really like Michelle Trachtenburg so I thought it looked like a good fit for our family.  Well my daughters liked it but my husband and I thought it was terrible.  I kept waiting for it to get better, but it only got worse.  Wish I would have just turned it off.
It was very mean spirited and just didn't flow at all.  Harriet at one point carves the names of her classmates into the top of her desk and then crosses them off (with a sharp object again)one at a time as she gets her revenge on them.  When her classmates are angry at her they harass her in a lot of disturbing ways and it seems to go on forever. If there is a lesson in this movie it is lost in the ridiculous story line and stupid acting kids and adults.  One of the worst family movies I have seen by far!

I didn't think the classmates had the right to read a notebook clearly labeled PRIVATE however it's eye catching ammo for any sworn enemy that wants to make one's life miserable especially Harriet's life.

The characters, which are the crux of the whole story, are poorly developed and not consistent with the characters as developed in the book. Harriet and Janie are unique quirky clever girls, but you wouldn't know it from this movie. And Ole Golly, who for some reason is called Golly instead of Ole Golly by Harriet, is horribly misplayed by Rosie O'Donnell. She is not helped by a script that misses the whole point of Ole Golly, who is wise, a bit acerbic, unsentimental, and intent on developing Harriet's intellect and letting her blossom in her own quirky way. The movie kept to the bare bones of the story line reasonably well, all while missing the actual point of the story.

And the music was AWFUL. I almost turned off the movie in the first 15 minutes because the music was so overwhelming and so bad. Horrible pounding cacophony throughout the interminable credits, and through most of the beginning scenes - offensive to the ear and drowning out the dialog at the same time.

I prefer a book-based movie to be as loyal as possible to its book (except maybe where special effects might be too challenging or expensive to create)-- and get really disappointed when a film doesn't live up to a story I loved. I do not like Rosie O'Donnell and even if I did, she was a huge casting mistake. Ole Golly should have been played by someone older, with perhaps a dry sense of humor. The nurse in the book never dumbed herself down for Harriet's sake; she wanted to expose her to intelligent literature and a world apart from the upper-class neighborhood and school. The book-Harriet was way cooler, stopping off for egg creams after her spy route and referring to various people as ""finks"". The book's Janie Gibbs was a smartmouthed redhead with lots of freckles, and I hated seeing her look altered for the sake of all those politically-correct ninnies out there. The movie's version of Harriet's best friend, Sport, was too wimpy looking and acting. Perhaps worst of all was that Harriet's movie character didn't come close to showing how badly Harriet took it after her nurse moved away. But then, I never did expect a Nickelodeon movie to be anything but a big cup of cutesy laced with sugar.

839597,3,6304311885,"I first read HARRIET THE SPY in a Children's Literature course in college.  I had been vaguely aware of the title for a while, but I don't think it ever would have occurred to me to read it.  But I found it surprisingly good, with a fair amount of honest insight into childhood relationships, what it means to be a bit different, and some truths about growing up in an urban environment that made it a compelling read.  I started recommending to other adult readers--especially those who (unlike me) had grown up in New York.

I seldom expect adult-level movies to be as good or better than the book, so I wasn't too surprised to find that the 1996 film version was, in many respects, lacking.  This visually hyped-up version (you can tell this is a post-MTV product)is actually jarring. at times.  And it drops(or virtually reduces to nothing) the book's many subplots.  And would it have been SO terrible to actually set the film in the early 1960s, the era of the original's action?  Of course, plots for ""grown up"" movies get updated too, and sometimes it works.  But usually it's just an attempt to appeal to the ""contemporary"" audience and often violates the spirit of the original.

The notion that kids can't identify with children from other times and places is a pretty condescending one.  And speaking of places, there seems to be little attemptin this film to capture any of the flavor of life in New York (in any era).  Sure there are immigrant families, some urban eccentrics, and in fact, the film is much more racially and ethnically diverse than the novel  But it could be Any City, USA.  And while the notion of ""spying"" has a certain attraction for kids of any era, it had a special resonance in the Cold War years that would have been nice to see captured in the film somehow.

Having said all that, I would have to admit that--as some other reviewers mention--that this film will likely appeal to its target audience, contemporary pre-adolescents.  A film doesn't have to be ""truly great"" to be entertaining, and that's true for any age level.  And kids generally like to see their issues and concerns dramatized.  The film makes its points about kindness and consideration vs. honesty and frankness well enough.  In that sense, it really is good ""family viewing,"" in that it can get parents and kids to discuss matters that concern almost any 11-year old.

But that's true of almost any ""After School Special"" or ""very special episodes"" of a given TV series.  What really makes for great family viewing in my book is a film that is well scripted, acted and produced.  It can be entertaining for kids AND adults.  In fact, it should be as entertaining for adults who originally saw the film as kids.  That's probably the ultimate test.  Would a young adult of, say, 23 or 24 who saw this film when it was released 12 years ago, still enjoy it--or more than just a nostalgic level?  I could be wrong, but I think any number of such viewers would come away from a viewing of this film today at least a LITTLE disappointed.",1200096000,8,3041,4.605947955390334
839598,3,6304311885,"I am 43 and listened to the book on CD with my daughter.  We then rented the movie.  I somehow missed this book when I was a kid.  Maybe our grade school librarian didn't like it?

Many reviewers complain about the movie dragging before getting to the real plot.  Trust me, it's greatly condensing the interminable descriptions in the book of Harriet's spying victims.

I was grateful the movie eliminated the absolutely horrid stuff Harriet wrote in the school newspaper at the end of the book (for goodness sake, what school newspaper editor would let a kid write a column that was devoted to ragging on the stupidity of a neighborhood kid, complete with the kid's name???  Or an article where she admits she followed the teacher home to a ""rathole of an apartment""???)

During most of the book I was asking myself ""why aren't these idiot adults mediating in this fight?""  - and of course that aspect is not changed in the movie.  I also thought the resolutions in both the book and the movie were unbelievable.  In the book Harriet's apology claims the mean writings were all lies - which wouldn't go over very well since these kids would know that what she was writing was true, at least in Harriet's own mind.  At least in the movie that's changed to where she says the statements are either lies or mean.  And why did nobody ever sit down with the other kids and ask THEM if they had never thought unkind things about other people?

I can't understand how this book got to be considered a classic.  Maybe just because it was one of the few books at the time that portrayed a girl in a non-girly role.  I sure hope better books have been written since.

There are some good things about the movie.  One of the best aspects is that it could open up some good conversations with your kids.",1197849600,,1792,4.478395061728395

I've had the DVD on my wishlist for ages! My dad claimed I'd seen it before, but upon watching, it was obvious to both of us that neither of us had seen it.

First of all, most of the characters didn't quite match what I had in my head reading the book, and some characters & things had been changed. For starters, Harriet had glasses, and short hair. In this, the glasses are virtually gone, and her hair's very long. The Italians that she spied on in their restaurant in the book, are now Chinese. And Eartha Kitt as the fabulous Agatha Plummer makes only 1 main appearance, and 1 very brief appearance, whereas in the book she was a regular character almost!

Of course, it's open to interpertation, but when you're a child, if you have an imagination that is, you get to 'see' the story unfolding in your head, and when I saw this film after so many years, I was so disappointed to see that some of my favourite scenes had been completely dropped (the section where she builds a town in the mud at the bottom of the tree was a particular favourite). Golly was described as being tall, thin, and not a very pretty person - in the film she was turned into Rosie O'Donnell which actually worked. Sport (Gregory Smith who also appeared in Small Soldiers) was the only other character who matched the image in my head to in the film.

Michelle Trachtenberg, although she has the best name in the world, just didn't work for me as Harriet. (Although she did remind me of myself at that age.) There was something that didn't click, and it brought the film down a whole for me.

Most of the kids who appeared in this, didn't amount to much, although Michelle has recently reappeared in Ice Princess. Gregory Smith has of course appeared in Small Soldiers. Vanessa Lee Chester, who played Janie, hasn't done much recently, although she did appear in Lost World, A Little Princess, and She's All That, although if you check out her pic on IMDB, my, hasn't she grown up! The aptly named character in the film, Boy With The Purple Socks (played by Dov Tiefenbach) has appeared in Jason X and Get Over It. Alisha Morrison, who played Laura Peters, also had a small role in Mean Girls.

The film can be quite upsetting when Harriet becomes an outcast in her class, and I found it quite hard to watch at this point. I'm sure I'll dig out the book sometime in the future, but might give a second viewing a miss.",1139356800,8,2647,4.3373737373737375
839664,5,6304311885,"After reading some of the negative reviews about this movie, I am inspired to write my views!

I saw Harriet the Spy when it came out in theaters in 1996.  I was 16 then, and I had read the book a few times.  Quite frankly, I didn't like the book that much.  I thought it ended badly and Harriet was a bit too mean in the book.  But when I saw the movie, I fell in love with Harriet as played by Michelle Trachtenberg.  She was positively wonderful in the role, and made Harriet likable and believable.

Harriet learns some important lessons about friendship and the power of words.  She also learns to deal with growing up and living with parents who love her but are often absent.  I think many kids can relate to this movie.  Harriet's classmates are real kids and we see Harriet having to decide whether to cater to the popular kids or stay true to herself.  We also see her take responsibility for her actions and win back her true friends.

I think Harriet is a positive role model in many instances.  Of course, some could take issue with her spying on people, but she usually does not do so in an illegal manner!  After all, this isn't a totally real story!  The only thing I didn't like about the movie is when Harriet's nanny tells her she has to lie in order to win back her friends.  Because really, she does not, she simply has to not be so harsh with the truth.  But this is a minor point.

The music in this movie is great, and I have tried for years to find a soundtrack without success.  If anyone knows where the soundtrack is, please let me know!

I also loved the scenes where Harriet does some crazy and fun things like going with her friends to the lady's garden made out of found objects, or fencing with Golly's boyfriend at the movie theater.  Harriet and Golly's relationship is beautifully portrayed.  It made me want my own lovable nanny!

At any rate, sorry for the long review, but I think this movie is fun and great and I highly recommend it for kids ages 9-13 or so.  Parents should watch with the kids and discuss any issues as they see fit!",1136678400,25,2075,4.288659793814433
839665,5,6304311885,Wow some people take children's movies too seriously. I own Harriet the spy and i still love it the same since it came out and i think it is a Nick classic. If you think about it its a shame the new generation of kids have to grow up without movies like this. Harriet the spy does have a few things in it that seem like its not for children but if you pay attention and watch it to the end it also teaches you to appreciate what you have and plenty of other good morals. The movie description is a bit simple and complicated at the same time Its about an 11 yr old that wants to be a writer but her spying is her writing actually its more like shes exploring and writing everything she sees. You cant just read reviews about the movie you have to see it cause some of the reviews don't do this great movie any justice. The acting is great and the story line is very original and thought provoking. If your a parent and you would like to know if this is a good movie for your kids well im tellin you it is. I was 8 when it came out and it has made me look at some things differently. This is a great movie and you shouldn't let your kids miss this and this definitely will teach children to appreciate good friends and more important good parents. I'm sorry if this review doesn't help or give a good movie description but this is a very underrated movie that will leave a good impression on kids not a bad one.,1134086400,5,1410,4.057347670250896
839666,1,6304311885,"Harriets adventures include feeding laxatives to her rivals, and her bright friend's big plan is to set off a smoke bomb (incendiary) during a school assembly. Either one will get a kid expelled, arrested, and in the newspapers. Not amusing ! Then there's Golly telling her about the virtues of lying. If there is a lesson that could be drawn (which the movie misses), Harriet's secrecy from her parents manages to create a full blown crisis out of nothing, because she is showing the sort of secrecy and evasiveness that (in a kid 2 years older) could be a sign of bad things like drug use, shop lifting, or bulemia, as in the movie ""Thirteen.""",1124755200,5,645,4.6173913043478265

Now watching it, though, I am just...less impressed. In fact, bored. Yeah, I'll go ahead and say it: I spent over eleven bucks on something I'm just bored with.

The special features are sparse, the movie lacks the sparkle I seem to remember...oh to be young again.

Anyhow, I am digging my Ren & Stimpy seasons 1 & 2, Pete and Pete and Clarissa Explains It All sets, so back to those. :)",1122940800,2,539,4.223300970873787

Apparently, someone at Nickelodeon decieded it was time to make a feature film.  What a better way to start out than with a sure fire classic like ""harriet the spy""
I remember the hype when this movie came out.  I remember the numerous advertisements for it.  But mostly, I remember going to see it and feeling like an idiot.
What a great way to kick off your feature film market than to make a movie that completly sucked.  Luckily, people knew a bad movie when they saw one, and this thing was forgotten almost instantly.

839669,2,6304311885,"Parts of this story are entertaining, but parts of it tended to bother me.  What really bothered me was that Harriet did some mean things to people in her class, but her nanny never told her that what she did was wrong.  She seemed to tell Harriet to pretend to be sorry, even if she wasn't sorry.  That attitude is what really bothers me about the movie and the book.",1074902400,3,368,4.228571428571429
839670,4,6304311885,"Who says you have to be a kid to like a movie generally made for kids?  My daughter has liked this movie for years and I think I like it even more than her.  Nickelodeon has produced something special here.  Before SPY KIDS there was HARRIET!  This is a great adventure with some emotional themes (peer pressure, honesty) for youngsters.  Through hip hand-held style camera shooting and a festive funky soundtrack to boot, I like the movie simply for the execution.  The fact that Rosie O'Donnel was pregnant (in disquise) during the making is also an interesting obstacle they had to work with.  At any rate, Harriet the Spy is a fun, and rather different movie.  When I say different I mean not like typical movies today filled with special effects and scenes so crammed with action and expository dialog that you can't even enjoy a scene.  Harriet the Spy has some calm moments that cinematically shine (unique camera angles, color choices).  The subtle sound effects and many humorous moments make this story fun for everyone.
The only reason I give this movie 4 and not 5 stars is because the DVD version the Paramount has put together offers a FALSE widescreen representation of the movie.  If you compare to the earlier VHS edition, you'll notice that they actually CROPPED this movie for DVD to give it the APPEARANCE of widescreen, rather, you're actually seeing LESS of the picture which was originally cropped on the VHS version for full-screen adaptation to begin with!  That and NO bonus features to speak for whatsoever (is it so hard to add at least the original TRAILER?) I found that rather disappointing.",1060992000,5,1622,4.794964028776978

This movie, though, has appeal to anyone who's ever been a kid. Adults, teens, and kids can all watch this movie. It's hard to believe Nickelodeon wouldn't do more entertaining things like this film, becuase now all they seem to air are badly made cartoons that kids can enjoy for about two years. Then they move on. This is a movie you don't outgrow though, and Harriet is a fun and easy to believe character.

839731,5,6304311885,"Harriet M. Welsch (Michelle Trachtenberg) is an 11-year-old-spy who dreams of being a writer. She explains her obsession with writing by saying: ""I want to remember everything, I want to know everything.""

In her PRIVATE notebook, she writes down her secret thoughts. Sometimes her comments are all too honest and not that nice. Harriet doesn't yet understand the power of words, but soon she learns, when all her friends become her worst enemies.

Rosie O'Donnell plays the perfect nanny. Her advice to Harriet is that while she might want to know everything, it won't do her a bit of good unless she uses her knowledge to put beauty into the world.

Harriet goes through a great learning experience where she finally realizes she should participate more in life and learns to let go of her writing obsession in order to embrace life. After all, true friends are what makes life wonderful and worth living.

This is a funky, modern story that teaches a wonderful lesson. It is about learning to forgive and being vulnerable enough to be able to say you are sorry.

A great lesson for all ages!

839732,5,6304311885,"Well, first of all I have to say this is my favorite movie, and probably always will be. This is strange, according to everyone at my school, because I am a High School Freshman and this is a kid's movie. Oh, well. But, why? Because this movie is very much like my own life. Although I don't have a spy route and despise tomatoes with a passion, I have always related to Harriet. It's been my goal as long as I can remember to be a writer. So, of course I instantly bonded with Harriet from the moment she declared herself one. I even had a journal like hers already! (Hey, I was about ten, I thought this was more than coicidence.) And I never was ""one of the crowd"", and never will be. So I love Harriet, and her friends. Janie was eccentric but fun, so I liked her, and I was poor like Sport, my aunt was like Golly. My parents a bit like Harriet's...and these still hold true today. This movie holds a special message for me: You will survive. You can make it, and enjoy yourself along the way. And that's why I love it.
It's a special movie that you can watch and always love. This is one.
As for the whole book vs. movie thing: I haven't read the book (haven't been able to get my hands on it), but from reviews I've seen, and just reading about it, I think I like the 90s version a little better -- just because I relate to it more, that's all.
And so, I depart.",1002153600,6,1369,4.092936802973978

I found my imagination portrayed the story better than the movie. I enjoy the Nickelodeon channel and the actors/actresses in the movie, but I strongly feel that if a movie is going to be made from a book, they should follow the book and make the characters like the ones from the book.",997920000,2,441,4.2
839734,1,6304311885,"I hate this movie. Only girls watch this movie. Harriet the Spy should spy out of stores. This movie is really bad. In fact there are more felmale actors then mnale actors. If the company of this movie wanted to make a movie with more actress than actors. Then they should have dropped the male actors out of this movie. Do actresses and actors has to be in the same movie?
Harriet spys around her neighorhood. School is begining for Harriet and she is entering 6th grade. She is 3 more grades away from high school. Harriet's teacher tells the class that Harriet M. Welsch and her rival are runing for 6th class president. Which including taking attendance and working on the 6th grade newspaper.
Harriet loses to her rival. One night Harried goes out with her nanny Golly (Rosie O'Donnell) and a male along on a movie and dinner date. Harriet (Michelle Tractenberg) arrives home late. And her parents are mad. Harriet's mother (J Smith-Cameron) fires Golly. And Golly says it is the right time to leave Harriet. Harriet's mother and father (Robert Joy) try to talk Golly out of it.
So now Harriet is on her own. Soon she faces crisis. Her rival finds her notebook and reads it and soon she finds her classmates aginst her. They plot to get back at Harriet by dumping blue paint on her after her parents order her to stop with the notebook for a while when they find out they she is not doing her school work.

She has two best friends named Sport and Janey,(sport is a comedian, and Janey is a Scientist ) The best part is when they start school and Harriet rates all the students.

839738,2,6304311885,"HARRIET THE SPY is one movie that back in 1996, at eight years of age and had read the book more or less ten times, I was anticipating. Wanting to see so badly I'm sure my parents were getting tired of my protests.  Finally, Mom took my best friend and I to see the movie we had been waiting  for.  What a mistake. I loved it back then, with Harriet doing all kinds  of stuff probably our moms would never let us - but then again the Welsch  family seems as if they don't go for the mushy hugs that our families did,  and were TOTALLY distant from their eleven year old precocious daughter -  and everything was just plain fascinating for our eyes. Now four years  later at twelve, I watch it again. HARRIET IS, to put it bluntly, A TOTAL  BRAT. I mean, she refuses to go over her friends' houses just so she can  spy, and all the time she is spyin' away and worrying whether a guy is a  veggie thief in Hong Fats Grocery she could be with her friends, who aren't  doing anything with her. Finally when Marian the jerk finds Harriet's  notebook, at eight I was screaming ""NOOO"", now at almost thirteen  I am screaming ""Go, Marian!"" Harriet needs to learn that friends  shouldn't be taken for granted. Only Rosie O'Donnell has a superb part in  this. And that's why I'm giving it two stars.",963705600,2,1289,4.264462809917355

Please ignore all the negative reviews, they are just trash.  I do however, agree with a one  star reviewer that Harriet shouldn't have destroyed her notebooks.  Perhaps  she should have drawn a picture of the person she was mad at and destroyed  it.  Rosie O'donnel was out of this world when she played Ole Golly.  Forget about the book, this movie is much better.  My ten year old cousin  thought the part when Marian Hawthorne asked where her notebook was was  incredibly funny.
