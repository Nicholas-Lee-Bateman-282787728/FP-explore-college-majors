8429912,1,B004I1K23M,When I purchased this I expected the extended cut for the punisher I still love the movie I was just  hoping that it was going to be the extended cut,1485561600,2,149,3.966666666666667
8429913,1,B004I1K23M,"The pic shows the extended cut of punisher. Upon arriving in mail, it is the same artwork, but without the words ""extended cut"". I could care less about the steaming pile called ""Law abiding citizen"". Into the trash with both.  I wanted the extended cut Punisher and all I got was the theatrical version. Guess I'll stick to my DVD until they release the superior extended cut version on blu ray.",1485561600,5,396,4.577464788732394

8429916,2,B004I1K23M,Lucky I taught of purchasing but after reading the review the Punisher Extended Cut is not actually Extended Edition instead Theatrical Ver will not buying it unless confirmed if it is Uncut Ver,1481500800,,194,4.909090909090909
