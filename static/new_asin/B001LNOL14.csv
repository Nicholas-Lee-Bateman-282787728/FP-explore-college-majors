I loved seeing the different rides all over the world, and the best part is that you can really go and enjoy them.  Usually the interesting shows are things that you can't go and participate in, but these places are new and real and I'm going to see which ones I can do.",1237248000,,358,4.173913043478261
8360400,5,B001LNOL14,This is the second best thing to being on the rides themselves. Incredibly shot plus you get to meet the people who have the fantastic jobs of coming up with these adrenaline pumping rides. The thing you learn is that building new rides is like being at the cutting edge of technology. They are literally inventing how things work. So cool! Does anyone know if this is a series? I would like to see more shows just like this. I heard of a Ferrari Theme Park opening in Abu Dhabi. Wish they would make a show on that!! Highly recommended DVD!!,1235001600,,542,4.376237623762377
