1353613,5,B00004U2MT,"Boy do I love reading books and watching videos about these guys!  Two ships with only 120 men could storm a town of thousands, pillage it senseless, and get away clean to do it again 20 miles down coast.  Once their ships were so full of booty they couldn't plunder another town, they headed home, only to have to worry about later-launching Vikings who might decide to plunder them!  How such barbarism could be so effective for centuries without anyone finding a way to thwart them is a mystery to me, but there it is.
Another mystery is why all of ""civilized"" Europe stayed within comfortable sight of land, while only the Vikings had the courage to sail beyond the horizon, braving the monsters and the end of the earth.  Some say it was just greed, but that greed had to be backed up with a lot of courage and skill.  It took another 500 years before Columbus risked a western voyage.",1313712000,15,890,4.469135802469136

1353617,4,B00004U2MT,"This DVD is a well made production in the tradition of Nova. Generally well done, with a great deal of archeological fact to counter centuries of ""bad press"" in regards to a brave, industrious and adventurous people.

This documentary covers Viking history, alluding to the population pressures that drove these people to ""go a viking"". Covers their conquests and exploration to their west as well as their forays to the east into what is now Russia.

This is a very good introduction to the ""viking age"", but - imho - does not go as far as I would like to show not only what they did but also who they were. Given the length of television documentaries, this is somewhat understandable, but I would have liked to have seen them explore more of Norse culture, their art, manufacturing techniques (ship building was covered well, though), the role of women in society, etc.

This is a very good primer on the influence these people had on the late dark age/early medieval period and I reccomend it to those interested on the subject. I would hope that it would whet appetites for further reading on the subject.",1228953600,24,1110,4.682051282051282
1353618,4,B00004U2MT,"Right from the beginning I must tell you that I am from Ireland and have studied the history of the Vikings for over 30 years - so naturally I have a slight bias on this subject. This programme is really an overview and introduction of the subject rather than any attempt at intrepreting the influence of the Vikings in the modern world. The evidence stressed is on the material culture and doesn't trace the vestiges of the influence of the Vikings in Europe in any detail - Although Iceland is well represented as being the last home of the Vikings. For instance the latest genetic studies showing present decendants of the Vikings were not even considered - there are such studies. The people of the Orkney and Shetland Islands were notintroduced although they have their own unique Norse language - Norn. The exploration of the Rus is well done and the route of the Vikings to Bagdad was eye-opening. I especially liked the modern attempt to trace the journey by serious historians and archaeologists using boats constructed in the fashion of the age depicted. The Viking influence in France and their transition to Normans is cosidered but again not well developed. From this documentary one would hardly realise that the Vikings had quite an influence on the Mediterranean...Sardinia, Sicily and North Africa are not mentioned. Northwest Scotland was profoundly impacted by the Vikings but again we hear little mention of this...Danelaw in England while mentioned is not accorded its colonial status. One gets the impression that Dublin was the only town in Ireland founded by the Vikings and that aside from the bare mention of discovery of the largest Viking ship found thus far having been built in Ireland of native timber...the largest and possibly the most important Viking settlement in the world - Wood Quay in Dublin is not covered. The documentary does not cover very significant recent finds in Ireland of Woodstown caves and in Cumbria (Northwest England) of  possibly Britain's most important Viking burial site...in addition to which another find in the same county close to Cumwhitton village.

History, out of necessity, needs to be interpreted with the most recent evidence available. I understand that a programme like Nova needs quite a lot of editing but seriously...hopefully Nova will revisit the subject of the Vikings again and this time address it from a more regional context. The reenactments are sparce and we see some scenes repeated...This programme could have used more reenactments to bring the subject to life. This show is still worth the money! I thoroughly enjoyed the production!",1156377600,126,2622,5.053117782909931
1353619,5,B00004U2MT,"This is a great documentary. It hasn't been released on DVD yet  - I have seen the VHS version - there are more reviews there, have a look at them.",1142726400,6,147,3.9
1353620,5,B00004U2MT,"OK, so this documentary isn't perfect, and doesn't cover everything about the vikings - you'll have to read some books for that, you cannot cram it all into a few hours.

But this documentary is truly excellent. They have much footage of people re-enacting viking times, not just battles as most documentaries focus on, but everyday life, working in the farm, chopping wood, building ships, something to look at as the narrator describes the various topics. Much footage of ships recreated and sailing around (fast, too).

Many experts in different fields, not just a single narrator yabbering on for a couple of hours (like some documentaries) ... different locations, and computer enhanced recreations of villages.

I do not hesitate to say that it is an absolute MUST HAVE for anyone interested in studying the vikings.

Buy it, you will be very pleased. I just wish it was on DVD.",1118880000,7,884,4.912751677852349

1353629,5,B00004U2MT,"In the nineteen sixties, there was a discovery of a Viking (Norse) site in Lanse Aux Meadows, Newfoundland, at the northern tip of Canada where archeologists had uncovered the foundations of one thousand-year-old Viking buildings. As this was told of in the Sagas of Erik the Red and his son, Leif the Lucky, these two texts which mixed history with Scandinavian mythology, were all anyone had to go on for centuries until now. The implications were huge and the earlier voyages were proven true and unparalleled for their time. The Vikings had come here centuries before Columbus making them the first Europeans to arrive in North America. With this site being the only discovery and the Vikings knowing these grounds so well, did they actually have more access to this area? The Sagas tell of it and solid proof has been found in the sixties, this is the quandary that spurns on the interest of archeologists still. They have begun using terrific and unique satellites being in place about four hundred miles above the earth to search the coastlines to give them new insight into possibilities that they didn't have before. They are called Space Archeologists and one determined woman, Sarah Parcak, is looking for any new sites while claiming that they just didn't leave many things behind.

She, along with her team, is searching everywhere while tracking using this new satellite technology. They are also looking at their modes of travel via their famous Norse Longships. The land of these seafaring Vikings, or Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, is spread over a vast area of 350,000 square miles being dominated by a maritime culture of fjords, rivers, and inlets scattered around the small towns where they farm, fish and hunt. They had a certain Ruling class back in Viking times over their people which were the Jarls, then-Chieftains and at the very bottom were Slaves. When they set sail in the boats out to discover and/or conquer new places, they buried their dead warriors in their own boats along with their personal items to take them to the afterlife along with them. Waging war with their god Thor, whose father was Odin along with Freya (the goddess of fertility), the Vikings were a pagan race who believed in a polytheistic order. Much of their culture is recounted and explained in depth by Historian Dan Snow, who regaled to the viewer about their ships being built, their bones which were buried within, the famous Viking swords, and much left behind in raids. They can recreate how a Viking ship is all built of wood; buoyant and flexible, made of oak for the long travels on very rough seas.

Parcak and her team have found what they believe to be another Viking site due to the satellites which see below the surface of the earth. This documentary explains in detail just how they go about a new archeological dig to unearth some surprising facts concerning another possible voyage here by the Norse. The invention and use of these satellites are quite fascinating along with all of the information that the historians will teach you throughout the new dig. During in climate weather, long days, and now through limited working placed on the dig time, we may just see Sarah Parcak and the team come to reap rewards dating back quite far. Could it actually have been that the Norsemen who were here on the site of Lanse Aux Meadows came back to colonize yet another place in North America? This Nova documentary fascinates us with answers one may not see coming way below the surface

1353640,4,B00004U2MT,"Lots of great information. However, Live Shreiber is just reading and is so monotone and monotonous, I fell asleep three times watching this, and I am an insomniac.  Worked better than a handful of melatonin ...... When I did watch it in its entirety- sound off, captions on, it was actually very factual and well done. I would prefer it to be politically correct and be called ""Norse People"" but right now, Viking is in vogue and its a slur to those of us who are Norsefolk.  The thing about this documentary was that it was unbiased and did show all the artistic and technological advances the Norse contributed to Europe-and America.  They have done nothing different from any advanced civilization- want a better life,study, share and implement technology,  engage in commerce and trading, build permanent settlements and have agrarian livestyles and still raid when they needed to fund survival of community.  I think if William Shatner or even Christopher Walken narrated this documentary, it would be a must see.  There was much information and scholars and facts, but I was disappointed in the hypnotic narration.  Schreiber is a good actor, he must have had an off  day. Norse culture touches everyone.  The days of the week are  even named after Norse Gods/",1409616000,5,1267,4.906103286384977

1353645,2,B00004U2MT,"One of the first things that I found odd was in the opening scenes.  There is a black viking storming the beaches with the norsemen.  Is this accurate?

There are many things on this DVD I had read dozens of times about in various books; however there were a couple of things that I had NEVER heard of, and doubt, regarding the history of the Vikings.

Then there's the case on the DVD where the storyline goes from talking about trees that came from Ireland that built this huge longship.  Hmmmm, interesting.  A very long boat.  The DVD goes right into a brief story propagating that all Irish are Vikings.  It never mentions how many Irish clans fought against the Vikings, never mentioned the battle of Clontarf, or nothing else of interest other than making it sound that the locals were happy the Vikings were in Ireland.  But, then they never did explain the huge longship.  It was just forgotten about.

The show did cover the Rus' extensively, however it was a purely pro-Normanist view of the roots of Russia.  The video belittled the Slavic peoples, making it appear they weren't good for anything other than hauling boats across portages, even though the Rurikid Dynasty was Slavicized within two generations or so.  I especially didn't find it educational to hear one of the professors proclaim that the local population (Slavs, Balts) would never had had a state had it not been for the Rus.  I'm a Halychyna Rus & Russian descendant & I disagree with his lame proclamation.  In my opinion, the state existed and was as sucessful as it was because the Norse and the Slavs (and Finns & Balts) apparently were the right combination together, at the right time.  The Norse alone standing in an empty field outside Kiev wouldn't have made much of an empire, would it?

The DVD made the Vikings sound as if they were the master peoples of the medieval world, while failing to point out little things like how they were terrified of the Magyars & Pechnegs along the trade routes to the east, and how eventually the Mongols would destroy Rus'.  Or as I mentioned earlier, that the Irish were a thorn in their side.",1368576000,2,2121,4.640750670241287

The Vikings [also known as the Norse].  Scandinavian [Scandinavia is todays Sweden, Norway, and Denmark] warriors who plundered and pillaged over a thousand years ago.  Their brutality was legendary.  They left a trail of violence across Europe.  For centuries, Viking longships terrorized people from Iceland to the Caspian Sea.

But the Vikings were not just raiders, they were traitors and explorers who ventured further than any Europeans before them.

Now, archaeologists are on their trail to uncover their secrets.  How did they master early metal production?  How did they construct their ships to withstand the roughest seas?  And the biggest mystery of all: how far did the Vikings go?  Did they discover North America long before Columbus?

Now, new technology is helping one scientist retrace their steps, with satellites 400 miles above Earth revealing the unseen.  But can this new technology find the Holy Grail?  A new Viking settlement in North America that could rewrite the history books.

At a secret location in North America, archaeologists are uncovering startling new evidence.

The above is said by the narrator at the beginning of this VERY informative documentary.

This film tells you everything you wanted to know about the Vikings from their conquests, their reputation as expert seafarers to their skill at trading and their intrepid explorations.  It investigates the truth behind the legends of these courageous adventurers and their epic journey to North America.

But the main focus is on the use of space technology, excavation, and the analysis of archeological evidence to investigate what may be the first new Viking site discovered in North America in over 50 years.

This documentary has brief comments from experts throughout.  It features a space archaeologist (thats right, a space archaeologist), an archaeologist who is a Viking specialist, and a historian.

Finally, everything about this film is superb from the photography, animation, and research to the archaeology, history, and archival footage.

In conclusion, watching this documentary is like taking a crash course on the Vikings!  At the same time, you get to see how a historical mystery is investigated with cutting-edge technology!!
