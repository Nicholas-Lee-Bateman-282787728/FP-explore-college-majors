8532434,1,B008YAPQIO,The guy wearing the HUNGRY t-shirt has teeth like a Farenghi.  I can't watch this mess.  Englishmen ALWAYS have cappy teeth despite having socialized medicine.,1500940800,,159,5.32
8532435,1,B008YAPQIO,This was not what i thought is was . i wanted to watch the concert. This is just ac/dc history. Not worth the time and money,1447632000,,124,3.8076923076923075
8532436,5,B008YAPQIO,I wanted to hear their story and this is what I got.  There are plenty of interviews with band members and media types.  This dvd really let's you know where they came from and how they became the greatest rock and roll band of all time.,1391472000,,237,4.130434782608695
8532437,1,B008YAPQIO,"Luckily I didn't waste almost $30 on this set, and was able to check it out of my local library.  While the book contains some decent pics, none of them are rare or unseen prior to publication, and the content is 99% rehashed material that barely scratches the surface of the band.  You'll see very little insight that hasn't been better delivered in any number of rock magazines over the years. There's a track by track rundown of each song recorded from the beginning up to the Stiff Upper Lip album, and here's an example of the in-depth and eye-opening descriptions attached to the song ""Can't Stand Still,"" from S.U.L.: ""Another little rocker that harks back to days of old."" That's literally it, nothing more.  And just when you thought the book was the most disappointing part of this set, you pop in the dvds (there are 4 of them) and the underwhelming hits an all new low.  Other than a few grainy photos of the band members, they consist of a beat up group of English music critics, journalists, hangers-on, etc. All look the part of what could have been the original road crew, complete with stereotypical dental issues, horrendous grammar, and very little factual information.  It's like a discussion at the bar with the sad old Englishman who's had a few pints too many, and a week or so between showers, but fancies himself an expert in rock and roll of old.  To add insult to injury, these discs amount to about 30 min each, which could have very easily been consolidated to one disc with no quality loss (not that you would notice). But then you couldn't advertise it as a 4-DVD set could you?  A blatant money-grab, this is one set that unlike other reviewers, I personally feel you should skip.  Any AC/DC fan that knows anything about the band will gain next to nothing but the loss of $30 with this set.",1381708800,5,1823,4.553516819571866
8532438,3,B008YAPQIO,"It's an okay movie.  It drags out a bit at times and completely ignores the bass player(s) which I found rather odd.  It's like they never existed.
Some good pictures, short clips and die hard AC/DC fans would like the added images and clips that they might not have seen.  I was not blown away, but it was okay to have on in the back ground and watch on and off.",1376524800,2,363,4.084507042253521
8532439,3,B008YAPQIO,"I enjoyed this book but had higher expectations for it.  It just skims over their career without delving very deep into any of it.  A good addition for a collector of AC/DC memorabilia, but not so much for the casual fan.  Enjoyable read overall but without depth.",1370908800,,264,4.574468085106383
8532440,4,B008YAPQIO,"This album is one of their better efforts.  One of my favorite songs is Dirty Deeds and I find I prefer Bon Scott's rendition.  Though Back In Black is my favorite AC/DC album, Dirty Deeds is fast becoming my second favorite.  Fans of AC/DC will find this CD to be well worth adding to their collection.",1370908800,,303,4.375
8532441,2,B008YAPQIO,This LP sized 4 DVD set was not quite what I was expecting. However the book that is part of this set is worth the price alone so I figured the DVD's were a bonus. I was hoping for several live performances on the DVD's but it's mostly interviews with various people about the different stages of AC/DC's career. Worth watching once for some nuggets of info you may not have known before but doubt anyone would watch it more than once.,1356912000,2,435,4.317073170731708
8532442,5,B008YAPQIO,"Ive been an ac/dc fan for over 32 years and i must say this is a must have for all ac/dc fans. I believed i only was ordering a 4 dvd disc set, but was pleasently surprised to discover that not only did i receive the 4 disc set, i also received a 116 page hard cover book. giving detailed info on the history of the band. TOTALLY COOL!!! and in closing I would put this book a the same level ( info & history ) as the hard cover book that comes with the backtracks cd and dvd box set.  thanks for reading my review.
