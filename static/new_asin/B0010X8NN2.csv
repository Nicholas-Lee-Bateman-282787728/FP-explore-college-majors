But I am familiar with this style having seen Starblazers (Space Battleship Yamato) and Captain Harlock and enjoying those programs.
  What caught my attention was the somber tone in the storylines and the adult themes. The characters were at once easy to relate to and reminisant of the other shows that this creator has done. The episodes were very well done and sometimes thought provoking as well as entertaining.
  This reminded me more of a live action sci-fi show more than a cartoon. I was engrossed in the plot of every episode and the overarching plot of the series itself. I found that I really cared for the characters and their Trains really grew on me.
  All and all, this was a very well done show. I started watching it by renting it, then quickly decided that I could not live without it. I know that they made more episodes and I hope that they dub those and bring them stateside as well. It would be a great loss for this genre if they do not.

Second understand I am reviewing this series; not the whole of Matsumoto-sama's work so please hopld the liche mobs, I'm going to be honest here.

Okay the plus side of things first. The first thing that comes to mind is the theme or background of the story that reaches back into the almost forgotten realm of hard core space sci-fi. Mean the premace of the show is about people that travel threwout the galaxy on trains, that's pretty out there and at the same time pretty cool. The next positive as expectected of Matsumoto-sama the characters are wonderful as is their developement. By the end of the series I felt like I knew all of them personally. The art work and animation is crisp, clean, flewant and a throw back to the 80's anime. No problems from me at that point but it should be noted. The plot while out there is kinda what you should expect given the world setting. Alien invaders from another universe, pirates raiding trains, stuff like that. Lastly I want to bring up the background and history of the characters they were supperbly done and because of this each character seemed like a real person.

Now to the bad stuff. Oh boy, there isn't that much wrong. Most can be credited to my own personal tastes. That said the few flaws are glaring at least to me. First are, well the show is somewhat slow, there are places where I was actually dozing off as I was watching it. Second I didn't like the ending, it felt rushed and it didn't make complete sense. The whole oh we know the galaxy railways is causing disturbances in another dimension, for reasons never disclosed. So we'll just shut down or rehal it so we can stop killing each other. If only wars were that easy to end. Lastly and perhaps is something that is typical of Matsumoto-sama, he kills off nearly half of the supporting characters for no real reason then just to show that people died. Or at least that's how it felt to me. I really hate when people do that kind of thing and that is my bigest gripe. Mean having a character die by random thugs to show the work is dangerous or having one of the crews not head for the life boats when their train is dead in the water and just sit there and wait to die? Anybody else annoyed by this kind of poor writing? This is what really makes me not terribly fond of a series I for a time truly did love.

In the end I have to say if you don't mind seeing characters you like die. Or a rather haphazard ending then this is a pretty good series but the unbalance between the slow opening, the shining enthrolling middle and the more then lack luster ending kills the series for me.

8239046,4,B0010X8NN2,"In the future mankind has spread across the galaxy using an interplanetary railway. Minabu is from a family of soldiers serving in the Space Defense Force. The SDF is a military group that protects the interplanetary railway system. His father and brother both died bravely in battle; and Minabu leaves home to do them proud. This is a spinoff of Galaxy Express 999. I have not seen that anime, but you don't need to see it in order to understand this one.

Galaxy Railways is  a unique series with lots of action and drama. There are lots of good characters and plenty of memorable moments. It's an easy series to like, but it isn't one of the better animes out there. My biggest issue with this one is the final conflict. The galaxy is being invaded by a military from another dimension. This invasion happens pretty late in the series, and it really felt kinda rushed. For such a huge crisis they should have taken more time to resolve it. There is a lot of sad drama toward the end and it really makes you think about holding on to what is important to you.

This anime is about 10 years old I think; and the animation could have been better. The voice acting is pretty good though. The soundtrack is just alright. Overall Galaxy Railways is a pretty good anime, but it's a long way from being fantastic.",1350172800,3,1308,4.464435146443515

8239048,5,B0010X8NN2,"Galaxy Railways represents some of the classiest and finest pieces of the Sci-Fi genre.  When most people think about science fiction, what comes to mind is something like Starship Troopers, Aliens, Predator, Galaxy Quest, etc.  But Galaxy Railways goes futher than those things.  It is a very deep and engaging show filled with much more than spaceships (or in this case ""Space-trains"") and lasers.  It's about living life and experiencing the things that come with it.  It is indeed, a beautiful space opera that is very much relatable to our own real day-to-day lives.

CONTENT ISSUES FOR PARENTS AND OTHER INTERESTED FOLKS... [episodes for you to review concerning fanservice: Ep. 2 (""Knot in Time""...Yuki putting on her outfit), Ep. 19 (""Tranquility""...this is the hot springs episode), Ep. 16 (Comrade)]
Well, first off, let's touch on content issues that parent's and other people may be concerned about for themselves or their kids.  Language is very tame in that they don't really make use of foul and coarse language.  There may have been a few uses of the D-word but honestly, I don't remember any of it.  Also, there are no innuendos.  Generally, this show is very clean.  However, there are a few scenes that some parents may want to be aware of.  In Episode 2 and one other episode, Yuki (a human-like medical android) is changing into her uniform.  All you see is the back/side lower portion (which is already covered by the part of her uniform that is essentially a one-piece swimsuit with long sleeves and NO cleavage...since she already got that part of her uniform on) as she is putting on her skirt and stockings.  This is done in a manner not really meant to be perverse or fanservicey, but more like a normal everyday kind of thing.  Also, in one other episode, her uniform does get somewhat ripped in an attack by alien beasts...but still doesn't show anything, just a little cleavage (the only instance of this).  Also, there is a ""hot springs"" episode, where they do a little more fan service stuff (though, nothing is shown or ""taken much advantage of).  Still for that episode, I will admit they go more ""out of their way"" to set up those fanservice shots...especially during the tennis match. It's much more tame than most anime out there that make fan service a point.  That's basically 4 instances of almost-fan-service stuff out of the 26 episodes.  Still, I would recommend previewing it yourselves, first, before giving it to a kid (and there are plenty of legal streaming sites where you can do this from).  All in all, though, it is an amazingly clean show with very valuable themes.  Thematically, it's both thought provoking and easily accessible by teens and up.

MOVING ON...
Galaxy Railways is one of the most inspiring sci-fi animations I have seen.  Released in 2006, the show, though very modern visually, is still beautifully influenced by the retro visual style of anime (the box art is actually a good example of what I mean).  Admittedly, some folks may like this, others may not.  I personally loved it.  Also, some people may be too distracted by the fact that trains are traveling through space (I, myself, thought it dumb when reading the synopsis at first)...but believe me, it works wonderfully.  In fact, it is a key linking symbol for many themes that play out in this show.  And anyways, until we have functional commercial intergalactic flights, I honestly don't think we are in a position to really critique the space travel depicted here.  Still, I definitely will say that this is a show that people will either fall in love with, or not at all.

PLOT (ABSOLUTELY NO SPOILERS)...
What makes Galaxy Railways work?  Well, let's begin with plot (don't worry, I won't put any spoilers).  This show is not about simply running around space blasting ferocious aliens and criminals to bits (though there is plenty of action).  It is both an epic narrative as well as a beautiful slice-of-life.  We begin by following Sirius Platoon on their many varied missions as part of the Space Defense Force (SDF).  As we take part in their daily lives, we watch them grow and develop as each character deals with their own personal challenges, convictions, and hidden demons...all of which are very relatable to our own lives and not overly exaggerated.  As ""the days go on"", ever so lightly is the main story arch sprinkled in...until finally the climax that brings the main story arch to the forefront.  The brilliance of this, however, is that even the ""side-stories"" and ""slice of life"" episodes help drive towards the climax as well as connect and bind the show as one.  Also, the ending is one of the most satisfying that I have seen in any animated series...and even against some live dramas, too.

THEMES...
Another beautiful thing about this series is it's very optimistic, but very realistic approach to issues concerning duty, honor, love, death, sacrifice, connections, war, destiny, and many other things.  I was especially impressed with how they dealt with love...not this cliche ""love-at-first-sight"".  Instead, it was a love nutured by friendship, hardship, and time.  C.S. Lewis did right in his book ""The Four Loves"" that the greatest and most welcome surprises that can happen is when two friends realize one day that they're love is not only a love of friendship, but a love that unifies two souls into one.  Also, it's look on duty was especially intriguing and very good, too...is duty the adherence to regulation or regulation the natural spawn of duty?  Those are just samplings of the many themes and many ways it approaches those themes.  They don't just touch up on each theme and then let it pass.  Once it appears, it stays there 'til the end...allowing you to view it under many lights.

CHARACTERS...
The characters really made this show vibrant and lively.  Virtually every major character develops over time and it is a joy to watch them grow.  In fact, you aren't limited to watching just Sirius Platoon, but many other platoons and characters as well.  They are very relatable and realistically portrayed.  Honestly, they could have made this a live drama if they wanted to.  Every character was memorable and an important piece to Galaxy Railways

ENGLISH DUB & MUSIC...
I saw the English dub provided by Funimation (the same one's selling this box set...and yes, The Veridian Collection is a part of Funimation in case you weren't sure).  I must say, I'm very impressed.  Not only do the voices fit each character, there was no annoying voice acting at all.  The script, itself, was very balanced and well written.  I think they really captured the spirit of Galaxy Railways.  The emotional expressions of the voice actors were potent but never overdone...it was like the most precise and perfect casting.  Then again, Funimation has actually been good at that, so we should expect no less.  The music is no less powerful.  It's very energetic when it needs to be, or very ambient when that's what's needed.  The music itself is enjoyable on its own, too.

ALL IN ALL...
This really is a beautiful space opera that touches on many real life challenges and situations we face in life. There is a lot of action, but if that's all you want, I believe you may be disappointed.  But if you want a very emotionally engaging show that gives you much to think about, this is a good series for you.  It's strengths lie not in the ""action"", but in it's multi-faceted plot, it's character development, the retro charm, and how immersive of a show this can be.  It's definitely worth a shot, at least.",1333843200,7,7570,4.817829457364341
8239049,3,B0010X8NN2,"The Galaxy Railways: The Complete Collection is a six disc set that is part of FUNimation Entertainment's S.A.V.E. line of DVD releases.  The first two discs each contain five episodes and bonus features, while the remaining four discs contains four episodes and bonus features.

The first disc contains six bonus features.  The first is an interview with Leiji Matsumoto, the creator of The Galaxy Railways.  This interview, which runs for about five minutes, has Japanese audio with English subtitles.  The second feature is part of a recording session in Japan for the second episode, ""Knot In Time.""  This runs for almost thirteen minutes, and it's in Japanese with English subtitles.  You see the footage of the voice actors performing their lines in the studio, and it's intercut with footage from the show for the scene they're recording.  The third extra is the ""Title Announcement Press Conference,"" which runs for about five minutes.  This is the press conference where Leiji Matsumoto, along with the script supervisor, announced The Galaxy Railways; this feature also has Japanese audio with English subtitles.  Next is ""Character Profiles,"" which contains profiles for Manabu, Louis, Layla Destiny Shula, Wataru, Mamoru, and Kanna.  The profiles include a picture and a write-up for each character.

The second disc has five bonus features.  The first is commentary from the ADR Director and the cast for the sixth episode, ""Reason To Love, Part 1.""  Next is ""Character Profiles,"" which contains profiles for Bruce, Bulge, David, and Yuki.  The third feature is ""Textless Songs,"" and this the exact same feature as on the first disc.  ""Mr. Stain"" contains a preview of one of the Mr. Stain on Junk Alley CG shorts that were produced by FUNimation Entertainment.  This short is ""Magic Crayon,"" and the feature runs about seven minutes.  After watching this short, my husband commented that it made him think of ""Aardman on acid.""  The final bonus feature is trailers.

The third disc contains four bonus features.  The first is footage from the Japanese recording session for episode twelve, ""Twilight.""  The next feature is another copy of the ""Textless Songs.""  The third feature is another preview from Mr. Stain on Junk Alley; this one is ""Binoculars.""  The final extra is trailers.  The fourth disc also contains four bonus features.

The fifth disc has three bonus features.  The first is yet another copy of the textless songs.  The second is another preview from Mr. Stain on Junk Alley; this one is ""Cassette Tape.""  The final extra is trailers.  The final disc also contains three bonus features.  The first is an ADR director and actor commentary for episode twenty-six, ""Eternal Hope.""  Next is another copy of the textless songs.  The final extra is trailers.

As for the series itself, it starts out like it's going to have an overarching story, but the arc is suddenly dropped for a number of episodes for vignettes about the various characters.  It isn't until the final few episodes when the overall story returns.  While The Galaxy Railways did an excellent job when it came to character development, I felt the overall storytelling didn't entirely work.  As for content, there are scenes of people being killed, as well as some blood.  Between some of the images and the storytelling, this anime is probably better suited for anime viewers who are in their later teens and older.

For the DVD set, I felt a little too much emphasis was put on Mr. Stain on Junk Alley in the bonus features.  I also wish that on some of the later discs, that character profiles had been included for the characters in the Spica and Vega squadrons.  Personally, I can only truly recommend this box set to people who are already familiar with and enjoy The Galaxy Railways.

8239050,3,B0010X8NN2,"Yes this really is trains in space. Trains with atomic boilers and warp drive couplers indeed. I bought this on a whim and liked the idea and the price. The packaging is novel as it resembles a thin book with ""pages"" holding the DVDs. It looks okay and is very slim but I couldn't be certain that this saves too much. It does keep the DVDs secure however and survived shipping in Amazon's excellent packaging very well.
So what of the series itself. Well I hadn't seen any of the related series so came at this very fresh. It is 26 epidodes long and the plot doesn't really seem to get started until late into the series. Many episodes could be watched in isolation. The characters develop well and despite a few slow episodes the whole series moves along quickly enough to keep my attention. Overall I enjoyed it but it's not going to be one of my favourites despite the trains.
The English voice actors do a good job but I did find that some of the vocal track was lost in the background music or sound effects. The animation is very good and a cut above other animes I've seen recently. The difference is hard to define but there and it has a very welcome quality.
