7283055,4,B00ZIXHKAW,I enjoyed the movie. While it was pretty predictable the acting was good and the movie flowed well. Entertaining Christmas movie.,1448409600,,129,5.190476190476191
7283056,4,B00ZIXHKAW,Wondering why it didn't make it as a television or cable movie.,1448064000,,63,4.333333333333333

7283058,3,B00ZIXHKAW,"this movie was okay. its predictable and lightweight as far as drama is concerned. i got bored half way through. the cast is pretty good but i feel like the plot could have been developed more. i feel that it took too long fort the storyline to become interesting. Overall, it's okay, something to watch if there is nothing else. Don't waste your money.",1446508800,,353,4.53125
7283059,5,B00ZIXHKAW,Great movie!!! I thoroughly enjoyed the story and cast.  I appreciated the closeness of the family and message relayed of the importance of family and family traditions.,1481155200,,169,5.2592592592592595
7283060,5,B00ZIXHKAW,"What a great Christmas surprise! Loved it! Such a charming and genuine cast! I think what several people have commented on as poor writing is actually the director allowing the cast to improvise and just give the lines as they feel them. For me, that really worked.",1480896000,2,265,4.659574468085107
7283061,4,B00ZIXHKAW,"This enjoyably predictable movie features a supporting role by Jason Weaver, whose voice you may recognize as the musical voice of ""Young Simba"" in The Lion King, not to be confused with the speaking voice of ""Young Simba,"" who we all know to be the one and only Jonathon Taylor Thomas. Fair warning: if you start googling.. oh, i dunno,  JTT 2016 or something, you'll get stuck in a g-hole (""g"" for google, not glory) and wind up reading all about the guy who played his youngest sibling on Home Improvement and get kind of depressed because that kid's life is kind of sad. Anyway, Marry Me is a great example of a hardworking entrepreneurial woman who is doing her best to break the glass ceiling but, in the end, needs to find love in a totally predictable way before she can really be her best self. Because if a woman doesn't find love, she has NOTHING! That's the moral, I think?",1479772800,,885,4.462962962962963

7283075,3,B00ZIXHKAW,"Adam's boots really get to me.  They're just awful...chunky and his pants lay weird on them.  They bothered me so much it was all I could see throughout the movie.  I'm wondering how a director and all the actors let him wear such monstrous things.  The rest of his attire was pretty good, which makes the boots even more of a mystery.",1449878400,,335,4.354838709677419
7283076,5,B00ZIXHKAW,"Marci (Malinda Williams) is a businesswoman in New York. She is satisfied with the single life and has big dreams for her advertising agency. After four years away from her hometown, unexpected news gets her there for Christmas. She shows up with her employee, Adam (Brad James). Stephanie (Victoria Rowell), who has been eager to see a wedding ring on her daughter's finger, mistakes Adam for Marci's boyfriend and soon after the ""engagement game"" begins.

It was December 2013 when I first saw this film on UP. I record television shows and movies so I can fast forward through commercials and, if I remember correctly, I watched this one at least four times before deleting to make room on the DVR. Marci's family members are invasive at times, but in a humorous way. This is an entertaining film that had me smiling as soon as it began and made me feel different emotions with each scene. There are funny, touching, serious and enlightening moments.

Favorite Scenes: The times Marci spends with her mother, Stephanie. Especially the scene in the kitchen.
Favorite Line: I'm gonna win. That's what I do.

Writer: Rhonda F. Baraka (Pastor Brown, Trinity Goodheart, Saving Westbrook High, For the Love of Ruth, To Hell and Back)

Talented cast:
Malinda Williams (Soul Food, First Sunday, Daddy's Little Girls, Girlfriends' Getaway)
Victoria Rowell (The Young and the Restless, Diagnosis Murder, Marry Us For Christmas)
Jason Weaver (The Long Walk Home, The Jacksons: An American Dream, The Lion King, Thea, Smart Guy, Drumline)
Gregory Alan Williams (Million Dollar Arm, Preacher's Kid, The Game, Necessary Roughness, Marry Us For Christmas)
Brad James (For Better or Worse, Comeback Dad, Love the One You're With, Prisoners)
Carl Anthony Payne II (The Cosby Show, Martin, Love the One You're With, Marry Us For Christmas)
Karon Joseph (Where's the Love, Necessary Roughness, Marry Us For Christmas)
Tamara LaSeon Bass (Boston Public, Baby Boy)

I like the Chandlers, which is why I was happy about Marry Us For Christmas (2014) and I am so looking forward to watching the continuing story, A Baby For Christmas @7pm (ET) Sunday, December 13th on UP.",1449705600,2,2152,5.033707865168539

7283078,2,B00ZIXHKAW,"Save your money. The concept is good but the writing is seriously lacking. The acting was pretty good, but I just could not get past the writing.",1448841600,,145,4.407407407407407

8720380,4,B00ZIXHKAW,"Hard to watch the mother and daughter scenes because truly Malinda and Victoria are only 11 years apart and clearly DO NOT look like mother and daughter. They really look closer in age. But if you can get past that, this is delightful movie! Just the kind of movie you can watch with the kids around.",1512777600,,300,4.375

8720384,2,B00ZIXHKAW,"I love christmas movies but this wasn't really about Christmas.  I don't know if it was the acting or the script itself, but it really didn't suck me into the story like a good movie does. Overall it was kind of boring.",1486166400,,219,4.214285714285714
