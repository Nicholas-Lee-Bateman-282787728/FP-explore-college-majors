4018769,5,B002ZG99HC,"Saw this movie last night, it was brilliant and super funny, packed theater everyone was belly laughing!! Now I'm looking for the soundtrack, I loved the opening song played during the car chase. Do you know the title?",1281225600,2,218,4.7631578947368425
4018770,5,B002ZG99HC,"This is one of the funniest movies to come out in a very long time. Here's why:

1. The movie was filled with belly laughing funny bits that were surprising and not the typical cliche kind of stuff. I haven't laughed this hard in ages.

2. There was also a lot of subtle humor, also making this movie very entertaining.

3. Will Ferrell was absolutely hilarious. That's to be expected. What was so surprising was Mark Wahlberg. He was different from his normal hard as nails tough guy roles, and he played off of Ferrell just perfectly. He was so hilarious.

4. Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson were perfect in their roles. They weren't on for long, but they were part of some very funny bits. Michael Keaton also contributed some fun to the movie. Eva Mendes was perfectly cast. All in all, a superb cast that made for an uproariously funny comedy.

While there were periods that moved a bit slowly, that shouldn't stop anyone from seeing this movie. The laughs more than made up for any slower times. Also, those slower periods set up some of the funniest bits later on, and they set up the story.

It was really relaxing to laugh so hard. I felt like I had a mini-vacation. I'd absolutely recommend this movie.",1281139200,138,1217,4.509090909090909
4018771,5,B002ZG99HC,just saw the movie in theater and i thought it was hilarious. definitely one of will ferrells best movies in a while.,1281052800,3,117,4.363636363636363
4018772,5,B002ZG99HC,"I have not laughed this hard since ""The Hangover"".  This has to be the best comedy I have seen this summer, hands down.  I only wish I could think of a TLC lyric to bring it all home.  Does anyone remember ""Waterfalls""?  From the wooden gun to the non-stop one liners, I was rolling in the floor.  Will Ferrell has not been this good since ""Old School"" and Mark Wahlberg was ever bit his comedic equal in this fantastic film.  From Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson all the way to Michael Keaton, everyone was amazing.  Whoever did the casting for this movie took a second seat to only one person, the writers.  The script was drop dead hilarious.

Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg play two down and out cops?  Mr. Ferrell seems to be stuck in his rut by his own choice and since I don't want to give anything away, let's just say that Mark Wahlberg made a colossal mistake to have found his way down to the lower levels of hell.  Luckily the two of them are partners.  Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson are the heroes of New York City but do to some unforeseen circumstances, they quickly relinquish their title.  Wanting to seize the opportunity of the new opening for a hero, our two bumbling cops attempt to solve a very big case.

Apparently some guy has been constructing some buildings without getting a scaffolding permit.  Are you kidding me?  The two losers meander down to arrest him and fall into a very large case of fraud and an attempted robbery, of a very large nature.  I am trying very hard not to give away any of the punch lines in this film but admittedly it is difficult to write this review without doing so, since I was laughing the entire movie.  From driving the Prius into a bucket full of cocaine, all the way to being disgusted about the four homeless guys using it as a sex toy, I was laughing continually.

Have I said yet it was too damn funny, and this is coming from the guy who only a few months ago said Will Ferrell was washed up.  Talk about eating your words.  Even Eva Mendes was fabulous as the homely housewife of Will Ferrell that Mark Wahlberg couldn't seem to stop ogling.

With some movies you see all the laughs crammed into the two minute commercial and when you see the full length feature there is nothing left.  With this movie the commercial is only the tip of the iceberg.  The explosion scene was funny but trust me, if you liked the commercials, you will flat out love the movie.  Everyone in the theater was holding their stomachs from beginning to end.

This is a must see movie.  It was absolutely incredible.",1281052800,53,2571,4.40339702760085

Having seen it on DVD and on other sites, it's quite obvious this movie has been edited to take out so many little tidbits. What a terrible way to ruin a product! it's filmed and released one way, and they had the nerve to crop out scenes. Possibly it was to lower the rating (not a fan of censorship, so director intended it to be viewed as an R-rated movie, so you insult him by thinking it's better as a PG-13), or to shorten the movie, but either way, i found myself taken out of the moment several times when i realized it skipped something.",1511568000,,702,4.449612403100775

4019833,3,B002ZG99HC,"Starts of well with the Rock and Samuel L Jackson's characters, who weren't believable at all, but extremely funny in doing whatever it took to get the bad guys, no matter how much they endangered the public's lives.  But I didn't find Wahlberg and Ferrell characters worked that well as two loser cops, one a nerd and one a bully who shot a professional baseballer at a game who was carrying a bat when walking down a tunnel from the field who resents the fact his partner doesn't want to act like Jackson and Rock, so he misses out on any action.  The two actors have proven they do work together on the screen well in other movies such as Daddy's Home, but for some reason it just seemed forced in The Other Guys and like they were trying a bit hard.  Ferrell was better than Wahlberg, whose character was more annoying than funny but they've both played well better characters elsewhere.

Don't get me wrong the movie still has its moments, but once Jackson and Rock disappear from the picture it just seems to be going through the motions of trying to be funny but not really succeeding on too many occasions.  The story itself was also pretty weak compared to most cop buddy comedy films.",1484784000,,1194,4.483870967741935

The reason I only give it 4 stars is because Amazon REFUSES to provide the UNRATED edition of the Other Guys to us streaming customers. The Other Guys Unrated version is literally worth an extra 1-2 stars, it's THAT good. Ultimately we're only talking a few minutes of extra content, but it makes a huge difference and I cannot see why Amazon won't provide more options for those of us who are trying to not buy more DVDs and Blurays when streaming is much more eco-friendly.",1484092800,,647,4.491525423728813

4020381,3,B002ZG99HC,"Lets get the basics out of the way: The plot of The Other Guys wouldnt hold up in any court of law. Thats annoying, yes, and at times even distracting; the movie loses momentum in the end as it grapples with tying up the thin storylines dangling ends (and there are many) and winds up giving the audience a tutorial on corporate fraud. And Anne Heche as a testy financier is woefully underused.

But all of thats a small-ish price to pay to watch Ferrells singular and witty absurdity unspool onscreen. He milks every moment, no matter how it strains credulity and humor, and often pulls it off. Hes paired perfectly with Wahlberg, whose air of danger is channeled into edgy hilarity. Some successes: A running bit about Gambles seemingly unexplainable ability to lure ridiculously attractive women like Eva Mendes (who plays his wife) and the bizarre fate that awaits a pair of celebrity cops who indulge in Bourne Identity-like action sequences, complete with explosions and gunfire and macho, canned repartee. Hoitz and Gamble are unlike most other guys, and what a gift that is.",1471824000,,1082,4.848648648648648

I love the reference to the other guys.  Much  like when watching a show and you see main characters going into a dangerous place and there are those never seen before people who go with them, those are the other guys.
You know the tag alongside will be on a one way trip and not coming back. We even call them the Other guys.

Will and Mark prove sometimes the best bet is sometimes 'The Other Guys'!

Will Farrell Plays a simple quiet man who is a deck cop. He is continent in his life and likes to make sure all T's are crossed and I's are dotted.
Mark Plays a character a cop who is very angry at the world and wants more than to be stuck in an office at the police station.

**Samuel L Jackson and Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) have short term roles in the film as well!
Pictures below are screen shots from the movie.
When the office looses 2 high profile cops the position is open for their replacements. Who will be the stand out cops?
Will and Mark are partners, Mark wants make big moves, Will wants to finish his report on a minor offense someone has committed.

The fun begins when they team up to make their move. How they solve crimes, learn to be real partners and allow their inner being to come out is HILARIOUS

We laughed so much I had to stop and run to the bathroom at one point.

However, if you're looking for a quirky movie that will make you bust out laughing, this is it. Mark Wahlberg is hilarious; especially with his stupid outbursts and downright denial of his partner's behavior and attitude. I think that how he acts in this movie is how a lot of guys would love to act on a daily basis, if they could get away with it.",1447459200,,471,4.130434782608695

4022475,5,B002ZG99HC,"My wife and I love this movie.  In our opinion this is the best Farrell movie out there.  I'm sure some will disagree and they are allowed to, it is their opinion and mine is mine.  That aside I recommend this movie for those that like comedies that you can watch over and over again.  I think I've watched it 20 or more times.  For a movie that I watch that often I need to have the Blu-ray so I don't need to rely on streaming which invariably is not in the catalog (Netflix, Prime, etc) when I want to watch it.  Here is a quick pro/con:

Pro:
- Re-watchable
- Wonderful transfer for 1080p High-def experience
- The audio is also great so make sure your surround sound is ready to go
- If you watch for it you can get this Blu-ray for the same price as a cup of Starbucks coffee

Con:
- There is one scene we skip...it is the scene with grandma relaying messages.  It just isn't funny after seeing it once.

My wife and I love this movie and we were very happy to add it to our home collection.  I recommend you add it to yours.",1446940800,,1031,4.029556650246305

There are some genuinely funny scenes, especially with Will Farrel and Mark Wahlberg spoofing male bonding sequences.  There are also a lot of references to other films (see http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1386588/movieconnections ), which are a lot of fun to look for.

Also, hang through the final credits - the indictment against the banking industry is both biting and funny.

Otherwise, I'd pass on this.",1433894400,,660,5.027522935779817

4023891,5,B002ZG99HC,"It is hilarious!  There are many memorable scenes and so many quotable lines.  Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell have great chemistry and work well with each others comedy.  The rest of the cast are on their top game as well, particularly Steve Coogan and Eva Mendes.  Even though their scenes are brief, Samuel L Jackson and Dwayne Johnson are show stealers!  I know there are people out there who don't care for Will Ferrells humor, and those are the only people who may not enjoy this movie.

I cannot praise this movie enough; you will just have to watch it for yourself.  Do I think its worthy of an Oscar?  No.  I do know that I was entertained throughout the entire film, laughed harder than I have at a movie in a while, quoted lines for the next few days and still want to watch it again.  I think on that basis alone, I can consider it a fantastic movie.  Do you want to laugh?  Watch it!",1431302400,6,895,4.293413173652695

Detective's Hoitz and Gamble are a laugh a minute and play off of one another perfectly.

4023895,4,B002ZG99HC,"The Other Guys

 This is a cop comedy that really works.  In part it is because of the star studded cast.  Dwaine Johnson aka The Rock is partnered with Samuel L. Jackson as New York hero cops.  Disgraced detective Mark Wahlberg and forensic account Will Ferrell are also partners.  They are The Other Guys.  When Johnson and Jackson die in the line of duty, the unlikely pair steps up to try to become the next New York hero cops.
 This movie is a lot of fun.  Michael Keaton has a supporting role as a police captain who moonlights at Bed Bath and Beyond to support the educational aspirations of his bi-sexual son.  Keaton at one time was a major Hollywood star.  This role reminds us of that and makes us regret the roles he has chosen not to play in recent years.  Eva Mendes is Ferrells unlikely, smoken hot physician wife.  Anne Heche plays a scumbag high finance queen.
 Baseball great Derek Jeter plays himself as the victim of Walbergs mistaken shooting and the reason for Wahlbergs professional disgrace.
 Wahlberg is the ambitious cop, anxious to redeem himself after the Jeter incident.  His squad mates nickname him The Yankee Clipper.  Heh heh.  Ferrell is completely content to sit at his computer and fill out paper work, even paper work for the other detectives in the unit.  His big idea is to track down a billionaire Wall Street financier for the crime of improper documents for scaffolding.  Naturally, this leads to murder, colossal rip offs and skullduggery of the highest order.  We laugh through the entire investigation.
 There are some very nice bits in this film.  My favorite is a bar scene where Ferrell joins an impromptu sing along-singing outrageously sad Irish ballads-and in a lovely voice too!
 Even the car chances and shoot outs are made to be funny and are.  Writer Producer and director all in one man, Adam McKay did a terrific job in all three roles.  He also directed three other Will Ferrell films, including Talladega Nights which is generally regarded as Ferrells finest effort.  Many people like the earnest, bumbling character which is Ferrells stock in trade.  They will love this movie.
 The Other Guys opened this Friday in the number one spot.  Adam McKay might well have his biggest hit yet with this funny, entertaining, light weight cop/buddy movie.  The PG-13 film runs one hour and 47 minutes.  Three and a half saw blades for this fun, fast, film.",1430352000,,2406,4.736714975845411

This is not even close to being a good/memorable movie.  Will Ferrell has made some really memorable movies that are very goofy, but this just isn't one of them. Here's how I'd rank Ferrell's best movies that I've seen, in terms of humor or entertainment value: 1. Anchorman, 2. Old School, 3. Taladega Nights, 4. A Night at the Roxbury, 5. Stranger Than Fiction, 6. Step Brothers, 7. Elf. Everything after that is not super-high quality, and this one goes with others he's done that just don't seem to totally click. Not without effort from the actors, but it's just a lot of dumb writing that doesn't add up to being very funny.",1417478400,,753,4.4963503649635035

4025576,5,B002ZG99HC,"I LOVE cheesy movies, and this is now on the top of my cheesy movies list. It was refreshing to see Will Ferrell play a completely different character than we are used to seeing, and he really delivers in this movie. This is also my favorite Mark Walhberg movie- it is so far out for him as an actor, but he does comedy surprising well and his comedic timing is great!

I think there is getting to be more and more of a trend with comedies where you see a bunch of jokes smushed together and it's funny, but there is no continuity or it feels forced because they are trying to get in as many jokes in as possible. I love that the jokes make sense here, and they are relevant and consistent to the characters as well as the storyline. The story itself is as good as it gets for comedy storylines- the case they are solving is interesting the whole way, and it doesn't become predictable (at least for me) until the later half of the movie. There are some cliches as with any cop comedy movie, but who doesn't love those?",1416528000,5,1019,4.225641025641026

4026272,4,B002ZG99HC,I am not a big fan of Will Ferrell because his brand of humor tends to dominate many of his films to the point where they become a bit boring half way through.  It is hard to make a comedy that is funny for a full hour and a half.  To do so requires a variety of humor ranging from obscure irony to slapstick.  I thought Wahlberg and others did a great job in making sure Ferrell did not completely dominate and the writing was varied making this an hilarious movie.  I think there is plenty in this film for everyone to laugh and be completely entertained for its full length.,1405555200,,577,4.171171171171171

I therefore bought the DVD and watched the whole movie again.

Ferrell and Wahlberg play two bumbling cops - a script formula that has been repeated since the 60s but the refreshing change was, they didn't act like a typical bumbling cop - proud, clumsy and clueless. They were much more unconventional and it is hard to describe. I think you will understand when you watch the movie.

The premise of the movie is very simple. The two star cops in the police department died and the officers who have desk jobs - played by Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg are assigned on-field duties. Just like all bumbling cops, they manage to catch the bad guy. Michael Keaton also has an interesting role as a police chief who has a side job of a store clerk.

The only reason I gave it one star is that Amazon doesn't provide for a rating of zero stars.  If you happen to be a fan of the most lame comedies ever written (e.g., ""the Hangover"", ""We're the Millers"", etc.), buy this one immediately.  On the other hand, if your i.q. is in triple figures and it takes more than watching someone pull the wings off butterflies to entertain you, run, don't walk, run as fast as you can away from this trash.",1399766400,2,648,4.366666666666666

If you like Anchorman, Talladega Nights and some of the better Will Ferrell SNL humor, you will love this. Also, the jokes hold up well after a second viewing (or more), which I think indicates the stuff is definitely funny, bordering on timeless.

The second half of the movie stalls a bit after the near perfect first half, but it is pretty good. I guess with such a strong first half, its hard to top it, but it is by no means bad and still has its funny moments.

Overall, one of Will Ferrell's funniest movies with a great supporting cast that really makes this comedy work wonders.

Well, world: I'm not afraid to say Will Ferrell is the greatest artistic genius of the 21st century. Possibly in human history. And The Other Guys is his masterwork.

What makes The Other Guys great? Bizarre characters played exquisitely. Mark Wahlberg is an underrated comic actor. He's brilliant in this. Rob Riggle steals a couple of scenes. Michael Keaton delivers this gem performance as a police captain who moonlights at Bed, Bath, and Beyond to put his kid through NYU.

If you get offended easily, don't watch it (and please, for goodness sake, find yourself a sense of humor).

4027939,3,B002ZG99HC,I don't usually like Will Ferrell but I must say I liked him in this. Both actors did a good job. The movie goes at a good pace and it's funny in a lot of parts. It also seems to be missing something that's why I gave it a 3 star rating. With comedy it's all about what you find funny. I did enjoy it so I won't give it a negative rating.,1357344000,,338,3.643835616438356
4027940,5,B002ZG99HC,So hilarious you will be surprised.  Samuel l Jackson and the Rock do a cameo that is insane and then mark walhberg does an amazing job like always.,1357257600,,148,4.285714285714286

4028050,1,B002ZG99HC,"Like all the other one star ratings on this movie, I too, was expecting much more from this movie considering the lead actors have been very good in past movies.  And boy was that a bad assumption!  First off, there is constant narration going on before and after each short idiotic scene.  Then there's the short choppy scenes themselves, not believable and not funny at all, some are a little funny, but that's not what I purchased a comedy movie for.  You don't purchase a comedy movie so you can have a small chuckle once in a while.  After seeing the trailer on television, I thought ""oh another Will Ferrell  movie, that will be good""  WRONG.  On the cover of this movie it says ""The best comedy this year"" ~~~~~~Ok, is what country?  People, I didn't even get far into this movie before I started fast forwarding ahead to see if it finally gets to some sort of story and to see if it ever gets ANY funnier~~~nope, it doesn't.  I could not finish viewing this~~mess!  Life is too short to sit and be annoyed by garbage I was duped into wasting money on.  It will go to the thrift store.  At least the next person that buys it won't have to pay what I did for it.  All I can add is that I sure wish I had read the reviews on this one before I paid good money for it.",1355097600,2,1271,4.198347107438017
4028051,1,B002ZG99HC,"This movie had stupid humor. Can't believe Mark Walburg lowered his standards to do this.
This went right in the trash.",1355097600,4,119,4.714285714285714
4028052,4,B002ZG99HC,"Perhaps not as funny as some of Ferrell's better received movies, ""The Other Guys"" is still quite hilarious, for the most part. I feel like a lot of people fail to understand that comedy is a dynamic art, and it requires constant experimentation. Were successful comedians to simply stick to the same formula time and time again, the comedy would grow stale, and nobody would be amused- not the actors, not the writers, and certainly not the audience. The downside of experimentation and trying new things, of course, is that there is always the risk of falling flat (which does happen at times in this movie). Personally, I would much rather watch a variety of comedic approaches, even if some will of course not be as funny as others.

Therefore, though ""The Other Guys"" is not on par with the very best, it's still quite enjoyable- and the very concept of Will Ferrell as an action star/hard boiled detective (reformed from his days as a pimp in college, mind you), is hilarious in itself. Wahlberg is clearly out of his depth here (I suspect those confused looks on his face are not necessarily called for in the script, but generated from genuine bewilderment), but he does an admirable job of trying to keep pace with his costar. A four star, funny movie for me. I liked it!",1354752000,,1280,4.638766519823789
4028053,3,B002ZG99HC,Wasn't happy with the intended purpose of this movie. It is funny in a Will Ferrell sort of way. Not a huge fan of his. Probably wouldn't have purchased if had looked more carefully at the content.,1354665600,,197,4.351351351351352
4028054,5,B002ZG99HC,I skeptically bought this movie  I don't tend to like Will Ferrell movies. I bought because I heard good reviews and I like Mark Wahlberg. This laughed so hard watching this movie. It's a movie I will keep watching.,1354060800,,215,4.512820512820513

I do not know if this tells you anything or not but I bought it at the $7.00 discount rack at the gas station, and it is by far not the worst movie I have seen, and it is by far not the best. I expected that it would have been funny, and kind of expected that Ferrell would have been a get smart type of detective while Wahlberg would have been the tough cop, and that is sort of the way it went. The plot of the movie with them chasing after a wall street ponzi scheme guy did not make a lot of sense, and it got dry and dragged on throughout the movie. However, Ferrell was funny as was Wahlberg.

4028182,4,B002ZG99HC,"I saw this on a plane this week and practically splurted out coffee on the woman next to me when Samuel L. delivered the line: ""If I wanna hear you talk, I'll shove my arm up your a** and work your mouth like a puppet!"" Pure poetry. Here are some more gems: ""We found your stolen Prius, it was voting for Ralph Nader."" / ""Your farts aren't manly. They sound like a baby blowing out birthday candles.""

The Other Guys is a no-holds-barred send up of the 1980 buddy cop action flick. The over-the-top car chases with Samuel L and The Rock pull together many of the the truly ludicrous stunts that seemed to pass as reasonable in those movies. It's all topped with delicious one-liners (""You have the right to remain silent... but I want to hear you scream!"") that would make Shane Black proud.

The writer/director also has an axe to grind on the whole financial industry bailout and there's an excellent Powerpoint-style series of stats that accompany the credits. The bad guys here aren't regular thieves but C-level white-collar types committing financial fraud. It shows how far we've come since the days of Lethal Weapon and 24 Hours.

Will Ferrell is Will Ferrell but the comedic star here is Mark Wahlberg. After being mercilessly ripped by Adam Samberg on SNL, his line delivery actually suits comedy perfectly. The whole thing is like a 90-minute comedy sketch more than a movie and there are enough funny lines and visual gigs to hide the plot. It's been a pretty thin year for comedy, so this is definitely one not to miss.",1327536000,10,1532,4.625
4028183,2,B002ZG99HC,"This movie sucked in my opinion. It had maybe only 2 really good funny moments but I ended up more bored than laughing.

Oh did I forget to mention Eva Mendes plays a ""fine"" role in this film.

4028186,4,B002ZG99HC,"""The Other Guys"" starts off as just another cop-buddy movie  but, about a third of the way in, it suddenly finds its mojo and turns into a clever, frequently hilarious send-up of not only police procedurals but the whole corporate and bank bailout outrages of the past several years.

The mismatched big-city detectives are played by Will Ferrall and Mark Wahlberg, the former a forensic accountant named Allen Gamble who prefers crushing numbers at his desk to crushing criminals on the streets, and the latter, a stereotypically gung-ho, trigger-happy hothead named Terry Hoitz, who's been busted down to an office clerk for accidentally shooting Derek Jeter at the ballpark, and who`s chomping at the bit to get back to doing what he does best.  Together, Allen and Terry mount an investigation into  a billionaire (Steve Coogan) who's become the target of a corporate client (Anne Heche) to whom he owes a great deal of money.

""The Other Guys"" could easily have been just another big-budget throwaway filled with lame comic set-ups and even lamer jokes.  Instead, screenwriters Chris Henchy and Adam McCay (who also directed the film) have come up with a manic mixture of goofiness and near-surrealism that they have refined into a tasty comic brew.  Most of the dialogue is sharp and witty, and the situations stop just short of all-out theater-of-the-absurd.

Much of the success of the film can be attributed to the wonderful performances by the two leads, whose decidedly different acting styles complement one another so completely.  Wahlberg's deadpan, ""straight-man"" restraint provides a perfect foil for Ferrall's more over-the-top comic outrageousness, and part of the joy lies in watching these two old pros find their rhythm and go with it.  There's also a goodly number of ""name"" players in the supporting cast, including Eva Mendes as Allen's ultra-supportive ""plain"" wife, Sheila; Michael Keaton as the police captain who moonlights as a manager at Bed Bath & Beyond; Rob Riggle and Damon Wayans, Jr. as a pair of hyperkinetic, shoot-first-and-ask-questions-later cops (their brief scene at an elementary school career day is itself worth the price of admission); and Dwayne Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson in cameo roles as a pair of super-charged, risk-taking detectives who take the phrase ""let's hit the pavement"" to a whole new, fatally literal level.  And all are excellent.

There's not much point in trying to look too deeply into ""The Other Guys.""  Just sit back and enjoy watching big-budget Hollywood filmmakers get one right for a change.",1324425600,5,2567,5.141826923076923
4028327,2,B002ZG99HC,"The relentless nature of comedy that Ferrell and McKay deploy is starting to wear on me, as I recall the defining moments of my time with The Other Guys.  While good-intentioned, this duo is progressing down a path that will place them perilously close to comedic irrelevance.  Something new needs to emerge and interrupt what seems to be an almost systematic disintegration of an otherwise great pairing.

The Other Guys MIGHT be an improvement to what is otherwise a re-imagining of their preceding project, Step Brothers, and even Talladega Nights before that, but it still just that:  A ritualistic adherence to the ""buddy"" theme that I'm pretty damn tired of seeing.

I'm being unnecessarily cruel, but it's only because I care.  There's some real class present here, and it feels as if it's being buried under an insistent barrel of paper-thin jokes that quickly lose their welcome.  Where this movie needs to be slick as oil, it's essentially syrup, and this applies to its comedy as well:  Simply a trudge through the matter of a humorous concept rung through to its limits for us to see for a minute longer than what is appropriate.

Even the plot feels monotonous and excessive, acting as an uninspired impression of corporate heisting and all that over-your-head nonsense.  It's convoluted, and not really worth analyzing in the first place.  The real story applies to our duo who, despite the predictability of each ones' characteristics, have a surprising amount of depth that leads me to believe that Wahlberg and Ferrell could work together again.

While the comedy may often overstay its welcome, it is anything but conventional when Wahlberg and Ferrell are on the screen together, and this is when the film sparkles, even if it never really shines.  Their joint efforts usually make it work, and their genuine commitment is admirable.

In fact, if anything, this is a movie chock full of recognizable faces, from Mendes and Keaton to the backseat duo in Jackson and Johnson, both of which are responsible for some of the most hilarious scenes in the entire movie.

Despite all of this, The Other Guys still feels like a bruised horse that's tired of being flogged, and deservedly so.  I feel that this could be seen as a significant point in time for the professions of McKay and Ferrell:  Either reinvent oneself and move on from past tradition that has now proven to be obsolete, or fall in the pit that Robin Williams is still trying to find his way out of.",1324166400,2,2478,4.834123222748815

4028409,3,B002ZG99HC,"You might think it's yet another Will Ferrell comedy with his usual antics. Actually, ""The Other Guys"" starts out differently than you would have expected from the name of Will Ferrell, with funny buddy-buddy cop movie spoof.

""The Other Guys"" is about a mismatched NYPD detective duo - mild and gentle Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) and aggressive Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg). Allen likes paperwork, happy with his current job while hot-tempered Terry is definitely not. When Gamble investigates a scaffolding permit violation case, however, the two detectives stumble upon a bigger crime, which could be a chance for them to be the city's new top cops, or stop being ""The Other Guys.""

The action comedy directed by Adam McKay (fourth collaboration with Ferrell after ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy,"" ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"" and ""Step Brothers""), starts out as an amusing buddy-buddy cop movie parody with Dwayne Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson as NYPD's ace detectives. The media and the people love them even though their ""investigation"" (accompanied by a big car chase) may cost the city of millions of dollars, until one day something really bad happens to them. It's very stupid and funny. The film is at its best.

Then ""The Other Guys"" slowly loses momentum as the weak story unfolds. The film's parody is replaced by a series of skits. Jokes become repetitious (about Allen's red Prius, for instance), heavily dependent on Will Ferrell making havoc. The story goes on and on, and the conclusion is disappointing. Supporting actors including Steve Coogan has little to do.

""The Other Guys"" is after all a Will Ferrell comedy, with a rather half-baked genre parody. But certainly it has one very funny joke based on Joel Silver type action movies. And Will Ferrell is not in it.",1315785600,,1812,5.009966777408638

I used to hate his style of comedy and believed it was too crude and offensive and just plain goofy for most viewers, and to be perfectly honest sometimes I still believe this.  However when he's on, he's superb.

The Other Guys is about Will Ferrell playing the role of a detective who's obviously not the most suitable man for the job because his partner immediately despises him just as soon as he realizes Will has an offbeat sense of humor and likes to be a clueless moron.  This of course leads to the two of them constantly getting into arguments while going for car rides across the city of New York.

The movie isn't flawless because Will Ferrell's character tends to repeat some of the themes over and over, such as his obsession with the Little River Band and his cluelessness to understand he somehow attracts extremely hot women.

Expect whackiness to dominate the entire storyline, and expect a few failed jokes along the way too.  We've come to expect the occasional missed joke from Will Ferrell films so it's not exactly a shocking news flash when it happens.

Luckily this was on the rental cue and I got a chance to watch it. I think this is one of the best films either actor has been in and best film director Adam McKay has pulled off. The reason it works so well is because everyone here is at the top of their game, from the top billing down to the smallest supporting cast member. Farrell has moved from doing goofy bit parts to goofy characters with occasional punch to goofy characters that never drop the ball. His character is FLAWLESSLY funny and never suffers for weak spots in dialogue. And then there's Walburg who plays the straight cop but manages to both allow Farrell to have his high moments and still slip in that odd phrase or look that makes him believable AND funny.

4028535,2,B002ZG99HC,"I didn't have high hopes for this Will Farrell (Megamind, Everything Must Go) movie. The trailer looked horrible and I figured this would be a typical Farrell movie. At this point in his career if you've seen one Will Farrell comedy, you've seen them all.

I do like his work in more serious/drama films.

The Other Guys are Farrell and Mark Wahlberg (The Fighter, Invincible); two detectives who are on the bottom rung of the police force. Farrell is a money man and Wahlberg shot Derek Jeter during a baseball game. They're the joke.

But they get their chance to be heroes after some crazy circumstances. (I wasn't sure what to think after The Rock and Samuel L. Jackson plummeted to their death)

I will say that Farrell knows how to do oddball comedy. Some of the things that come out of his mouth are genius in their timing and totally from left field. Most of the time, though, I wasn't laughing.

The language is over-the-top but more importantly, the movie is just bad. Or maybe stupid is a better word to describe it.

I enjoy good comedy and good writing.  This movie had neither.

The entire movie consisted of making crude jokes about sex (and once using a grandma character to describe in detail sexual activities).  My opinion is that if you have to resort to coming up with the most disgusting thing you can think of, and putting it into a film: that's not good comedy, it's a pathetic high school display (no offense to high schoolers) of highly paid, no talent adults, making a film to see how far they have to go to gross you out in order to get a laugh.

To me, when you have a grandma character in your film who describes gross sexual activity, and that is supposed to be humorous, you know you are scraping the bottom of the barrel for comedic writing.

So, if you think paying to hear people make stupid jokes about sex, and thus trying to cheapen it, is not something you want to spend your money or time on in a down economy, then this is not for you.

Also, I think most who've seen this will agree, the plot is terrible.  Another viewer agreed with me that the film just would not end.

It's funny as the only film that came to mind when I watched this movie was Steve Coogan's 'Hamlet 2'(even more hilarious!), which is a different story, but has the same loopy feel. Coogan has a fairly small but intricate role here, but I suspect he helped with the humor or they chose him to be in this because he had the right amount of kookiness they were looking for.

Ferrell has never been funnier and Walberg proves he can do comedy in this farce with a mission to bust your gut! I laughed out loud throughout this crazy flick and it was a welcome change from the standard buddy film.

I remember reading a critic state that they finally got the `buddy cop' movie right, so now they should stop trying.  I agree.  This film narrowly misses genre perfection (Mark Wahlberg tries way too hard here and drags the first half of the film down a peg) and so the studios really should let this genre alone for a while; let it rest.  The biggest surprise here was Will Ferrell.  His comedic timing has rarely been better than it is here, and he really plays it smart.  His one-liners are hysterical, and yet he never resorts to his usual outlandish behavior.  He keeps it very cool throughout; playing a variation of his shtick in a manner we haven't seen from him before.  He slays the dialog, selling every preposterous line after another.  And really, it is the dialog that makes this film so entertaining.  The TLC references (Michael Keaton finally makes a noteworthy impact), the whole Tuna bit, Walhberg's fawning over Mendes, JERSEY BOYS...there is just too much to love about this movie.  Like I said, it's nearly perfect.  Wahlberg has never been my favorite actor, but the first half of the film sinks in his efforts to be funny (NOT NATURAL) but Ferrell is a laugh riot (where was his Globe nomination?) and together with some smart scripting they make `The Other Guys' a must see summer blockbuster.

They both have nothing to do in this movie. Will Ferrell plays Allen Gamble as a big, blank, clueless fool. He is totally out of place in the precinct and is the repeated butt of mean-spirited jokes and insults from nearly everyone around him. There is a looong running joke throughout the movie about how every beautiful woman who crosses Gamble's path immediately falls for him while he is completely unaware but this joke gets old way fast. Mark Wahlberg plays Terry Hoitz as an angry hot head who accidentally shot a baseball star just before a big game and is now stuck with Gamble as a partner. There is a looong running joke with Hoitz, too, where he continually lusts after Gamble's beautiful, talented wife. The scene where Hoitz is leaving the Gamble home and mooning after the wife and repeatedly calling out to her while totally ignoring Gamble who repeatedly, desperately yells goodbye to him, made the Hoitz character just look like a self-centered, sad little jerk and the Gamble character look just plain sad.

The comedy was not funny, the action scenes were boring, the characters were all jerks or idiots or both. Basically I just stuck with this movie to the bitter end because I was determined to finish it. But I also read the newspaper, made a grocery list, and petted the cat, all of which were much more interesting then the movie.

Now, to be fair, I admit I did laugh. Exactly twice.

*Possible Spoilers*

The 1st laugh was in the early part of the movie when the super macho hero cops played by Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson (I love `em both) are pursuing some bad guys who manage to escape by zip lining off a building. The hero cops take a second or two to discuss the escaping baddies. Then one of them yells ""Are you thinking what I'm thinking?"" and the other agrees ""Aim for the bushes!"" And they jump off the building after the baddies. And they go down.... down.... down.... down.... splat! It was a 20 story building. I admit, I love action adventure movies but there have been many times I wished Arnold or Sly or Bruce or some other guy ended up exactly as these two did.

The 2nd laugh came late in the movie, when The Other Guys' rival cops are in a hot car chase after other baddies. The rivals had been at a school showing off and passing around their guns (Bad! Bad! No excuse for this kind of stupid scene) when they get the call and they take a little school girl for a ride along. I admit I laughed when the rivals are speeding along and make a sharp turn and the little girl in the back seat goes ""Eeee!"" as she slides along the seat and thuds into the side. Then another sharp turn and another ""Eeee!"" Thud.

Overall, miss this movie if you can. After seeing it, my opinion of Mark Wahlberg went way down and I will probably never bother with another Will Ferrell movie again.

Lots of action in the beginning of the movie, and after that it slows down now and then, but I thought it was an entertaining movie.

Few references to bail outs does not make it a political movie.

4028603,4,B002ZG99HC,"""The Other Guys"" is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It's not at all what I expected from the photo on the DVD box. ""The Other Guys"" is a smart and affectionate parody of action hero, cop, buddy movies. It answers the question, ""What makes a man a man?"" with whispered kibbutzing during a wrestling match at a funeral for heroic police officers. The most unexpected joke makes fun of the self-important narration that accompanies the PBS Frontline series. I laughed so hard during the ""good cop bad cop"" scene that I hurt myself.

Will Ferrell is Will Ferrell, one of the funniest people who has ever lived. Mark Wahlberg plays it totally straight, as if he were Serpico, and, in his own way, Wahlberg is as funny as Ferrell. Michael Keaton is hysterical as their supervisor who sometimes mixes up his work as a policeman and as a bed, bath, and beyond supervisor.

4028694,5,B002ZG99HC,"...and thus I felt obligated to write a review to bump it up.  I don't know what it is about Will Ferrell, but even though his films do good business at the box office and get generally good reviews, he still seems to be somewhat underrated.  ""Talladega Night"", ""Step Brothers"" and this one are three of the funniest movies I've ever seen, but they never seem to be elevated to ""classic"" status like a ""Caddyshack"" or an ""Animal House"", a league in which I think all three films truly belong.

Of the three, this one is the weakest, but only because at times it seems to try too hard.  And it also drags on a bit long, even in the theatrical version.  Wahlberg (who should've been nominated for an Academy Award in ""The Fighter"" like most of his co-stars were) clearly can't do comedy very well, and his role probably should've been totally straight instead of hamming it up with unnecessary B-story lines about his artsy ex-girlfriend and his lust for Ferrell's wife (played by the smoking hot Eva Mendes, whose smoking hotness is the whole joke).  But that's not to say he's totally miscast for this movie, just that the part should've just continued to play up his tough guy uptightness instead of making him a third-rate goofball where he's got no chance against Ferrell.

Other than that, it's just wall-to-wall laughs, played for absurdity and maximum humor, with a supreme supporting cast.  In addition to Mendez, you get the hilarious Michael Keaton in what I hope is a big comeback for him after many years of obscurity, Rob Riggle in another tour de force performance not unlike his role in ""Step Brothers"", and Dwayne Johnson & Samuel L. Jackson as two over-the-top arrogant cops whose roles are far too brief (again though...that's basically part of the joke).

Not to sound hackneyed, but if you liked ""Talladega Nights"" and ""Step Brothers"", you'll like this one too.  You'll be laughing throughout.",1300752000,,1912,4.7492447129909365

Instead, countless distractions, yelling, prank playing, endless issues with a wife and a girlfriend.  But yes, they finally did solve their case...only I forgot what it was in the meantime.  I will say, as a concession, that Mark Wahlberg was funny while Will Ferrell faded into the background (little better than a prop).

4028746,1,B002ZG99HC,"I was mildly interested in this based on the trailer - the antics of the protagonists looked amusingly off beat. How wrong I was - the first act of the film is surprisingly mean spirited and drags for 45 minutes  -  I actually checked how far I was saying, there's another HOUR of this?! It had moments of pathos/interest like the pimp backstory and whenever SLJ and the Rock were onscreen, but their characters were SPOILER randomly killed off by the writers in the dumbest way possible. Mark Wahlberg has 1 or 2 scenes of cool fight moves - can't we just get Shooter 2 please? Will Ferrell's shtick is different here but it's so ridiculous and inconsistent that it just isn't humorous. Furthermore, the second act is just a series of mind-numbingly dumb smash cuts - the heroes accept bribes twice for a joke? What??? Time and space have no meaning - a trip to and from Vegas takes approximately 30 seconds screen time and is a throwaway joke. Climax is quite dull and unfulfilling. A major misfire, do NOT watch if you want to laugh or have a good time - I was eating buffalo chicken after completing a big essay on a Friday night - can't be much more in the mood than that, and it STILL SUCKED.

This one though, not so much.  There are some funny bits here and there.

I think Walhberg is very talented and I typically enjoy any movie with him in it (especially when he makes cameo's in his own produced show Entourage).  I wish Dwayne Johnson and Samuel L Jackson had bigger parts in this movie.

4028885,4,B002ZG99HC,"`The Other Guys' is a pretty decent comedy film that follows the tired and tested police buddy movie format.

Will Ferrell joins Mark Wahlberg as they attempt to bring an unscrupulous Ponzi investor to justice. But to be honest the storyline takes a backseat to the comedy interaction between Ferrell and Wahlberg who are both genuinely funny and made me chuckle out loud at numerous points. If you have seen other Ferrell films with his slightly offbeat, random comedy then you know what to expect. Saying that, this doesn't maintain that level of quirkiness the whole way though, like other films of his (Talladega Heights springs to mind), but it does come back to the more outlandish humour at regular intervals.

To be honest the story is pretty weak and formulaic, but you don't really notice this as you watch the film. You are so engrossed in the lines and back and forth between the characters that you don't pick this film apart too much and if you take it on face value as the light hearted comedy it is, you should enjoy this just fine. It doesn't take itself too seriously and makes for an evenings entertaining viewing.

4028886,4,B002ZG99HC,"A while back I wrote about a movie that I thought would end buddy cop movies forever. Yes, COP OUT was truly that bad. And this is coming from a fan of both Kevin Smith and Bruce Willis. But the buddy cop movie has been born again with two unlikely leads in Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg. And they're bringing it to life as the anti-thesis of the buddy cop heroes by being THE OTHER GUYS.

THE OTHER GUYS starts out like every other buddy cop film made in the past with two mega heroes in the forms of P.K. Highsmith (Samuel Jackson) and Christopher Danson (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) chasing a car load of criminals. Suffice to say that they costs the city millions, do a ton of damage to vehicles and eventually blow up the front of one of the Trump Towers all in an attempt to arrest this carload for some minor offense. They're declared heroes and return to the precinct to let everyone know that they're leaving the paperwork for the rest of them to fill out...for the other guys.

Allen Gamble (Ferrell) is fine with this. He's there to back up the page grabbing hero's crumbs and take care of the dirty work they leave behind. But his partner Terry Hoitz (Wahlberg) isn't as pleased. He wants to take on the bad guys on the street. He was on the rise at one time, heading for the limelight when he accidentally shot...well I won't say because that ends up being on truly funny joke.

Gamble and Hoitz are left behind to do paperwork and in a way not be much in the line of detectives; even if that's the area they're assigned to. That all changed when Highsmith and Danson jump off a building while trying to catch a group of crooks who used a zip line. Again, what happens is hilarious and I don't want to spoil it but it results in the heroes deaths.

Now the city needs a new team of heroes and Hoitz wants it to be a part of that. But he can't stand his partner. Gamble has a lead on Sir David Ershon (Steve Coogan), a businessman who has building construction going on but hasn't filed for permits for scaffolding. Neither of them realizes that in trying to serve the arrest warrant for this minor offense the two of them will find themselves taking on a top level criminal.

Along the way they face opposition from their captain (Michael Keaton), the D.A. and various other law enforcement organizations. They even find their case turned over to the S.E.C. where their lead agent is Ershon's lawyer. Taken off the case and demoted to lower positions, the only way to get the bad guy is if they do it on their own terms.

So much for the bare basics of the movie. Surrounding this plotline are all sorts of jokes that are some of the funniest I've seen in some time. Enough so that on occasion you find yourself using the pause button until you stop laughing or to back up and witness what made you laugh all over again.

One running joke is that every hot woman that the duo comes across wants to jump Ferrell's bones. The first glimpse of this is when he takes Wahlberg home to meet ""the old ball and chain"". His wife is played by Eva Mendes, looking quite attractive and doing everything she can to please him while he tells Wahlberg how plain she is. All Whalberg can do is keep asking, ""No really, who is she?"" He can't believe this is Ferrell's wife. And the same holds true for every attractive woman they meet who tries to get Ferrell's number.

Wahlberg's character is the stock shoot first and ask questions later kind of guy. In his mind every criminal ties into some drug deal. Ferrell is the more cerebral one who looks for deeper crimes which seem to stare him in the face and he still doesn't get. They make the perfect pair, combining to make a winning team. Or at least you would think they would. Instead they more bumble into the crime being committed and are fortunate to simply survive.

There are all sorts of comedy at play here. The verbal jokes are funny, the physical humor is hilarious and the stabs at the standard buddy cop films are spot on. I've never been a huge fan of Ferrell feeling that he got too caught up in playing the seemingly same character over and over again. But this is one time that he shines in a role meant for him. And Whalberg with his demands to be let lose to fly like a peacock and constant referencing to things he learned as a child to use to bully the kid down the block is funny in his own way.

I wasn't sure I would like this movie. I was afraid that it was going to turn out like most movies with a decent trailer where the best scenes were offered there with tons of filler surrounding them. That doesn't turn out to be true. Sure those scenes are funny, but the entire film has funny scenes from beginning to end. This movie is not just a movie to watch a single time but to add to your collection. Its one that I know I'll end up watching more than once.",1298505600,,4832,4.305830583058306

At one point, Mark and Will have to go several layers into each other subconscious to find the killer. Oh wait...I might be getting this confused with Inception. Another amazing film.

Now I should say, I can't imagine a woman finding this film funny. It's way too ridiculous and childish. Which is why its so great. That's what guys love. Childish crap. Oh yeah!",1298332800,,668,4.520661157024794
4028888,5,B002ZG99HC,"The Other Guys was really one of those surprise comedy films that I really love, its a buddy-cop film but not your ordinary buddy cop film you would expect. Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg play NYPD Partners who are opposites in every sense, Will's character is just an accountent who is looking to stay out of trouble with a very mundane look at life while Mark's character is the overassuming overexaggerated cop whos looking to make a name for himself. I was a little skepticle of this film mainly because the other lead role is Mark Wahlberg and he doesn't normally do comedy films, as a matter of fact this is his comedy debut in hollywood. I am very familiar with Will Ferrell's work (Anchorman, Talladega Nights, Step Brothers) usually his comedy is more or less the same everytime but it is very hilarious either way. I have to say that Mark Wahlberg was HILARIOUS in this movie, and I'm sorry I ever doubted this man because he really does have the comedic chops, his comedy style is more like an agravatted boy and theres nothing more hilarious than to see a grown man act like a child and Mark Wahlberg pulls it off very well. The Star cast is also joined by the action junkies such as Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and veteran Samuel L. Jackson who play the big time cops in the beginnning of the film but later meet their doom. The jokes in this film are funny more or less whether it is Mark Wahlbergs assumption of druglords after him and girlfriend cheating on him with strangers or Will Ferrel's random outburst this film is just a delight from beginning to end. Although I love all the actors in this film there is one actor that is truly the funniest in this film and I have to give it to Mr. Michael Keaton (The Original Batman) his humor in this film in drop dead hilarious and I enjoyed every bit of time he had in this film, possibly the funniest character in the movie. Some may find the humor in this film to be dry but as for me, I like random humor and non-dirty jokes (although there are some here) and this film is one of the best.",1298160000,,2055,4.368146214099217

The Other Guys is just like every other Will Ferrell movie in that it grows on me.  The first time I watched it I was a bit disappointed that there were not more laughs with the pairing of Wahlberg and Ferrell, but there were definitely some parts that tickled my funny bone.  Upon watching the movie two more times and letting it marinate a bit, I'm finding myself quoting lines in the movie with friends and longing to watch it over again.

4029020,4,B002ZG99HC,"Parts of this rambunctious 2010 buddy-cop action comedy are hilariously funny, but director Adam McKay (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anchorman-The-Legend-of-Ron-Burgundy/dp/B00005JMYI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anchorman - The Legend of Ron Burgundy</a>) can't seem to keep up the momentum he sets up in the movie's first fifteen frenetic minutes. Perhaps due to Will Ferrell's presence, it starts to feel like a feature-length manifestation of one of his Funny or Die videos or at its worst, a padded skit from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saturday-Night-Live/dp/B0002I84FI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saturday Night Live</a>. On the upside, pairing Ferrell with Mark Wahlberg as mismatched and thoroughly inept NYPD desk jockeys is inspired casting and provides several giddy moments, but the screenplay co-written by McKay and Chris Henchy fails to sustain the sharpness of its initial satirical edge through the rest of the story.

Ferrell plays mild-mannered Allen Gamble, who is perfectly content as a precinct pencil-pusher. He's partnered with Wahlberg's Terry Hoitz, a hot-headed screw-up desperate to get his old beat back. Terry lost his self-confidence as well as his gun when he inadvertently shot Derek Jeter before a Yankees game, a tactical error that has made him the subject of constant ridicule at the station. Both Allen and Terry idolize the superstar macho detectives (played with comic relish by Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) who have caused millions of dollars of damage in their relentless pursuit of the city's biggest crime rings. When their fate gets sealed in a most surreal stunt jump, Terry and Allen begin to piece together a convoluted white-collar conspiracy involving a billionaire's plan to cover the losses he has incurred for a multinational conglomerate.

In the meantime, the reluctant partners get to know each other personally and discover some intriguing surprises, including Allen's hot, attentive physician wife Sheila. Whether spouting Zen-like psycho-babble or driving his tomato-red Toyota Prius, Ferrell is in typical deadpan form here except when reenacting his outrageous college years as a pimp. Wahlberg works best when he acts incredulous at his circumstances such as seeing a surprisingly funny Eva Mendes as Sheila helplessly smitten with Allen. It's also good to see Michael Keaton back in fine comic form as the precinct captain who moonlights at Bed, Bath & Beyond and cannot help but share his wisdom by quoting TLC lyrics.

Steve Coogan manages a few funny moments as the targeted billionaire, as do Ron Riggle and Damon Wayans, Jr. as a competitive pair of bumbling partners. The 2011 DVD offers only three extras - a ten-minute making-of featurette (""Crash and Burn!: On the Set of The Other Guys"") which focuses mostly on the opening sequence; a four-minute short focused on unused scenes of Keaton at his retail job; and five deleted scenes. The Blu-Ray disc adds several more featurettes; a gag reel; an audio ""mom-mentary"" recorded by the mothers of Ferrell, McKay, and Henchy; the music video for the closing credits version of ""Pimps Don't Cry""; a Judd Apatow-like ""Line-o-rama""; and even more deleted and extended scenes.",1296950400,3,3296,5.695121951219512

4029202,5,B002ZG99HC,"I was afraid to rent this movie because of the very mixed reviews but eventually my curiosity grew too much and I took the chance. There was much more action than I expected. Pretty much every single character has their own comedic quirks to them. Will Ferrell plays his usual ""not-all-there"" character but with the twist that his character actually has his very smart moments. And for someone as serious as Wahlberg's character, I was surprised by how many times he made mistakes as well. There is only one scene that I found that truly did not make sense *SPOILER ALERT* and that was the fight between Sheila and Allen. It went from a loving moment of song to ""let's make love"" ""You have to let me be"" ""I'm pregnant"" ""Gator's b* better be using jimmies"" ""Get Out!""
Why Allen had his freak-out moment made no sense and neither did Sheila's sudden confession of being pregnant.

In any case I can understand this movie getting 3 star ratings but I really don't think it deserves a 1-2. It has stars who know how to act, humor, action, discusses ""white collar crime"" instead of the usual drug cartel premise. Does it overuse CGI and explosions? Yes. Does the comedy miss sometimes? Yes. Is TLC a little too far back to keep referencing? Perhaps. But I don't think that makes this entire movie worthless. And despite the fact that every positive review for this movie has been given ""no"" to the helpful question, I feel so strongly about the enjoyment I received from watching The Other Guys that I'm posting this anyway.

Can't remember ever doing that, but this movie, like alot of Ferrell's movies just don't work. You can clearly and plainly see the ATTEMPT at humour here, it just very very seldom payed off. His actions as the extreme nerdy cop are the farce within the overall farce of a cop movie. You can clearly see where the laughs are supposed to come, they just never do. Ferrell needs to reassess the movies he does...or some writer/director needs to figure out how to better harness his brilliant comedic wit, because none of his movies have done it yet (Talladega Nights and others have there moments though). There needs to be a way to let him do his hilarious farce stints, while still keeping the movie sharp and witty, rather than blatant farce comedy, where the over-the-topness of the joke IS the punchline.

I love the ending song ""Pimps Don't Cry"". When Eva Mendes sang it, the whole time I was wondering, ""Is this a REAL song?"" Apparently it is, and it was so funny hearing it at the end. Watch this movie at least once. I purchased it a day after I watched it and it is a favorite in my household already!",1294012800,2,917,4.2457142857142856
4029432,4,B002ZG99HC,"Hello. Few can challenge MacKay's credentials in the world of comedy and filmmaking, beginning perhaps with groundbreaking digital shorts as head writer of SNL. This being said, THE OTHER GUYS is neither a typical broad comedy, nor on its surface is it a typical MacKay feature. Beginning with ICE T's excellent narrative voice over, the film world of THE OTHER GUYS is populated by important satirical themes, and meticulous and scaled down humor, ie. the almost microscopic scene with Steve Coogan playing a paedophilic pirate-themed video game or the world of the nebbish embodied by the relentlessly put upon Michael Delaney (who even in the audio enhanced version of the movie--listen to the soundtrack--is referred to as the pasty looking man). This reviewer found that, upon a repeat screening, the most satisfying aspect was not the to-be-expected attack on the financial industry but rather Wahberg's character study of a frustrated cop. MacKay should be heavily lauded for casting against type and allowing dramatic exploration within big farcical comedy. Will Ferrell is obviously an incredibly funny human being, so to allow this role reversal may seem mystifying to the 'de regurgiteur' Hollywood accountant.

Perhaps MacKay realized the opportunity to work with dramatic actors in the brilliant STEP BROTHERS had a continuation in this current feature. His writing is no less than great, typified by the Lion-Tuna routine. In a bar scene that employs hyper modern technique he demonstrates future savvy. These elements coupled with his brooding mistrust of the American financial-political status quo make for an evolving future. Even if working to green light a project in MacKay's adopted home may be like bringing a bat fight to the shark tank.",1294012800,2,1761,5.289285714285715

As for a buddy cop movie, Will and Mark Wahlberg make a great comic pair, especially seeing Mark so out of his usual realm. There are plenty of decent sight gags and lots of good dialogue.

Maybe it was just too silly. I fell asleep halfway through it and awoke with about 10 minutes to go. I can't really fault the movie as much as just being tired, but it were that good, I think I would have stayed awake better. Not to condemn it, but it wasn't quite as good as Ricky Bobby.

This movie, with both actors together, did not deliver the movie as a comedy, nor as an action flick.  I think it's due to lack of editing on the film.  Some scenes should've been shorter (i.e. the scene where Ferrell's elderly mother-in-law kept coming back to deliver the message from his wife, played by beautiful Eva Mendes, to him and vice versa.  The scene was repeated one too many times.  We all rolled our eyes - enough already!)  The movie has lots of car chases and action, and there were some funny moments.

4029441,4,B002ZG99HC,"""The Other Guys"" was a smart comedy with just the right amounts of action and laughs. Will Ferrell plays Gamble, a dedicated, nerdy investigator who has been partnered with the disgraced Detective Hoitz (played by the surprisingly funny Mark Wahlberg) who ruined the World Series by shooting baseball giant, Derek Jeter. Because they are the laughing stock of the Department, each sets out to change his fate by doing something bold and fabulous. Gamble is on the trail of a Wall Street con artist who didn't keep up with his permit licenses, and Hoitz just wants to catch a bad guy and prove that he can do good police work. Using a Toyota Prius as their official police vehicle, they set out to solve a somewhat convoluted crime (ponzi type scheme which would eventually devastate the police pension fund) and we are witness to some of the funniest scenes in the movie. Gamble's eventual flashbacks on his own ""life of crime"" (he was a pimp in college), as well as Hoitz's reaction to Gamble's beautiful wife(played by Eva Mendes) will have you in stitches. I think some of the most overlooked stars of the movie (probably because they don't last long) were Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) and Samuel Jackson. I could not stop laughing when they jumped off a roof yelling ""aim for the bushes"", believing themselves to be indestructible or invincible. It was priceless. And not to be overlooked is the surprisingly funny Michael Keaton, who does a wonderful job playing the hard working, tough Police Captain who moonlights at the local Bed, Bath & Beyond. In conclusion, there are so many things that made this movie enjoyable, from the wonderful cast to the decent storyline. Most of all, it offers moments of pure fun.

Well, OK every so often someone sets the bar higher but those studios are probably in France.
I also agree with a lot of viewers that the directing/editing seemed like a hodgepodge of deleted scenes with really tenuous connectivity.
Acting, even of the spoof kind, seemed so tiresomely predictably stereotypic. Nothing like formula for a few bucks when the Hollywood mansion pool(s) needs cleaning.

4029555,3,B002ZG99HC,"Each to his or her own taste, I guess. Some of my friends liked this movie, some not so much. I had my hopes up going in, finding the premise really promising, that is, until the wheels fell off in the movie's second half. THE OTHER GUYS is basically Mark Wahlberg whining a lot - whenever he's not being angry a lot - and Will Ferrell doing that Will Ferrell thing he does. They play NYPD detectives Gamble and Hoitz, except that they are NYPD detectives who are relegated to long term desk duty and, therefore, headed for career obscurity.

Meanwhile, Dwayne Johnson and Samuel Jackson get extended cameos as the hotshot top cops who then get sidelined unexpectedly (in a scene that cracked me up, even though we all saw that punchline coming). Now Gamble and Hoitz aim to fill those big shoes and hog the glory, bogart the media pub. It's tough going, though. Gamble comes transferred from Forensic Accounting; he's an officious paper pusher. And the hotheaded Hoitz, he's actually a good cop, but he's still living down having shot Derek Jeter. In New York City, that's pretty unforgivable (in Boston, it probably gets you a medal and a lobster). The blundering duo does eventually bump into a case and it involves one of those high stakes corporate swindles. Enter Steve Coogan as a Wall Street financier, except that Steve Coogan doesn't elevate the film. The film could've actually done with less of him.

The thing of it is that, going in, I was really sold on the premise, and the off left field casting of Wahlberg and Ferrell as partners had me curious. There were a lot of good bits at the start, some of which set up character structure, cresting with Ferrell's hilarious ""tuna versus lion"" routine and the quiet fight at the funeral. Samuel Jackson and the Rock were funny for as long as they were around, and I liked that we never do learn what was up with Michael Keaton's habit of dropping lines from T.L.C. lyrics. I didn't necessarily buy into the film's recurring gag of Gamble as babe magnet. But Eva Mendes is good.

I guess it bugs me that this film couldn't settle on a genre or couldn't seamlessly accommodate the two genres. Just when you'd think it was a buddy cop action flick with moments of levity, it'd shift into over-the-top send-up mode. See, once you go spoofy and you break with the rules of conventional reality, you've essentially just surrendered that element of grounding and believability. Hoitz's rage issue as a running joke gets really old. Ferrell's lack of restraint eventually lost me. For me, Gamble and Hoitz started out as interesting characters who then became caricatures of themselves, and I don't give one bit of cr@p about caricatures. I already saw MACGRUBER. I couldn't invest in him, either.",1293235200,,2749,4.711018711018711

Normally I would give a lot of credit to a film which really tried to address the current thievery going on in Wall Street firms, but the insertion of these complex themes into a slapstick buddy cop film is exactly the train wreck you would expect it to be.

Aside from the absurdity regarding the overall theme, the storyline rumbles along from one scene to the next with no continuity. The jokes are unfunny and painfully lame. The acting? Phoned in performances across the board.",1293235200,2,595,4.833333333333333

It's too bad because the ideas and concepts of the movie could have been very funny but they simply are so poorly done that it is a really bad movie.

Honestly, I am embarrassed for the actors involved, especially Samuel L. Jackson, Dwayne Johnson, Michael Keaton, and Eva Mendes. I really like Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg, but this movie was horrendous.

In 2010, Will Ferrell and director/writer Adam McKay have teamed up again, after comedy hits such as ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"", ""Taladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"" (and both having worked at ""Saturday Night Live"") are back with a comedy titled ""The Other Guys"".  The film is co-written with Chris Henchy (""Land of the Lost"", ""Spin City""), featuring cinematographer Oliver Wood (""The Bourne Identity"" films, ""Face/Off"", ""Fantastic Four"") and music by Jon Brion (""Step Brothers"", ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", ""Magnolia"").

The summer film took the #1 spot from ""Inception"" in the box office and brought in over $168 million and it helps that the film received nearly 80% of positive reviews from film critics.  If anything, if you want to spoof the buddy-cop film genre, ""The Other Guys""delivers in insanity, gags and all out entertainment.  Now, ""The Other Guys"" receives its Blu-ray and DVD release on December 14th.  The Blu-ray release ""The Other Guys: The Unrated Other Edition"" features the original theatrical release and an unrated version with nine additional minutes.

VIDEO:

""The Other Guys: The Unrated Other Edition"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  As usual, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment gives us a wonderful picture quality featuring plenty of detail, dark blacks and wonderful colors.  First, let's talk about the detail...impressive.  You'll see the skin pores on Will Ferrell's face, you will see how New York City's detail is captured remarkably well in HD.  Even the dents, bullet holes and broken windshield...  Images are sharp, colors are vibrant and I detected no banding, artifacts or edge enhancement.  PQ for ""The Other Guys"" is awesome!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""The Other Guys: The Unrated Other Edition"" is presented in English, French and Portuguese 5.1 DTS-HD MA and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  Also included is an English audio description track in Dolby Surround.

""The Other Guys"" sounds absolutely awesome via lossless.  The film has its fair share of action sequences, car chases, explosions and plenty of cars crashing, gun shots, glass crashing and the sound effects sound great as it comes from the surround channels.  Action sequences, although numerous, the film tends to take its break from the action scenes while focusing on the comedic dialogue. Dialogue and music is clear through the center and front channels.  As for LFE, there is a good amount of bass bumping courtesy of the hip hop music soundtrack throughout the film.

Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French, Portuguese, Spanish and Hindi.

JUDGMENT CALL:

If there is one thing I have learned with films with Will Ferrell, especially when he's working with Adam McKay, if you love comedy, especially moronic comedy...just sit back and enjoy the ride.

I know there are some people who detest Ferrell films, as well as other SNL alumni-related films and they are not for everybody.  And as many of Will Ferrell's films have had its up and downs in the box office, ""The Other Guys"" is one of those films that you can't help but laugh, enjoy and just see how far these guys go with their insane story and improvisation.

There are so many buddy cop films out there, especially comedy and action-based films that have have made us laugh but ""The Other Guys"" is unlike any of those films.  It's unique comedy style is driven by how different this film is.  For example, the main protagonists, Allan and Terry... these guys don't get along.  Allen, who is somewhat of an uber-nerd and unlikely cop has only dated hot women and his wife (played by Eva Mendes) is hot!  And the two talk about their sexual nature as if it was no problem.  But yet Allan keeps saying how his wife is so plain.  And just seeing his partner Terry having his eyes fixated on Mendes' breasts and when he goes to give her a kiss goodbye on the cheek, he tries to kiss her on the neck and that was so hilariously wrong, but it shows you the instability of Allan and Terry's working relationship.

The fact that these two individuals are so different is what makes this comedy work.  Yes, films like ""Bad Boys"" have two protagonist who are different but yet they back each other up and hang out despite their differences.  With Allan and Terry, these guys are just so different and are literally oil and water, so seeing these two work together is just hilarious and fun.  Especially when you get to know their backstory.  The very quiet Allan, a former pimp?  The very angry Terry once learned ballet and art?  Unusual it may be, it works.

As for the Blu-ray release, ""The Other Guys: The Unrated Other Edition"" is a pretty solid Blu-ray release. Awesome PQ, very good AQ and over a 100 minutes of special features.

But it all comes down to your acceptance of these type of comedy films.  Will Ferrell excels at self-deprecating humor while Mark Wahlberg was probably the actor people aren't used to seeing in comedy films.  Both are very different in the types of films they have done, but yet it works because in the film, they are different and despite their differences, they manage to work as a team. Personally, I want to see more of Detective Allen Gamble and Detective Terry Hoitz... As long as Director Adam McKay and Will Ferrell collaborate again, I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel.

Overall, if you have enjoyed Adam McKay/Will Ferrell films like""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" and ""Taladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"", you'll love ""The Other Guys: The Unrated Other Edition.",1292976000,,8990,4.873267326732673

4029628,3,B002ZG99HC,"Watching THE OTHER GUYS, I was reminded of a story told to me many years ago by legendary screenwriter John Lee Mahin:
  He had just finished writing the script for MOGAMBO (1953), the African adventure movie that starred Clark Gable and Ava Gardner.
 Gable approached him one day and he was angry,  ""You son-of-a-bitch,"" he said.  ""You've given Ava all of the funny lines.""
 ""That's right,"" Mahin replied, ""but the audience isn't going to laugh until they see your reaction.""

 That's one of the basic rules of comedy.
 There always has to be a straight man.
 Would Lou Costello have been funny without Bud Abbott?
 Would Jerry Lewis have gotten all those laughs without Dean Martin (or somebody like him) to play off of?

 That's the problem with THE OTHER GUYS.
 Almost everybody in it wants to be the comic, even the actors who usually play more serious roles (e.g. Samuel L. Jackson, Dwayne Johnson and Mark Wahlberg).  Nobody is doing the Bud Abbott or Dean Martin part, and the result is that most of the attempted humor just lies there.  It's simply not funny.

 The basic story premise, which is actually pretty good, centers on a pair of misfit NYPD detectives (Will Ferrell and Wahlberg), sentenced to life behind a desk, who stumble onto what might be the ""crime of the century"".  In their own inept ways, they attempt to solve it.
 In all fairness, there are some very funny moments in this movie, such as the scene in which Ferrell and Wahlberg play ""bad cop and badder cop"" or when Ferrell sends messages to his wife (Eva Mendes) through her mother.  Unfortunately, these scenes are few and far between.
 Ferrell is, without doubt, a skillful comic performer, but there is little chemistry between him and the film's other actors, and so much of the movie, particularly the action sequences, is so far over-the-top that it just comes off as stupid, not even amusing.
 Perhaps the underlying problem with this picture is that writer (with Chris Henchy)-director Adam McKay was never sure what kind of comedy he wanted to make.  At times, it seems like he was trying for another AIRPLANE, while at other moments the picture looks like a misguided effort to do an action/comedy ""buddy"" movie (e.g. 48 HOURS).
 That's another rule of comedy.  Pick your style and stick with it.

 The DVD from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment contains both the theatrical and an extended version of the movie, as well as a couple of ""Behind the Scenes"" featurettes, deleted and extended scenes.

4029629,4,B002ZG99HC,"I loved Anchorman's goofiness, and am glad that The Other Guys almost measures up to it (and surpasses Step Brothers and Talledega Nights, McKay and Ferrell's other collaborations). There are a few typically stupid cop satire moments, but there are also many sharp and sly digs at modern Hollywood films in general that surpass the norm for this genre. Wahlberg works well by playing the straight man to Ferrell's dry wit here, and Keaton is a standout. But the real star is director/writer McKay's sense of humor in both roles; he knows cop movies inside out and works with their cliches nicely, getting laughs in places you might not expect. There are misses as well as hits, but far more of the latter.

A couple of hilarious scenes had us cracking up over and over, especially the ""gator's b's better be usin' jimmies"" line. Will is still the best at those ironically weird moments, and McKay knows how to use him to the max. It feels like much of this was improv, so there's a nice fresh feeling throughout, which adds a lot of zing. Eva Mendes was perfect in her scene, another good comedic surprise.

The blu-ray is excellent, with a good transfer but better yet many very fine extras, including two good gag reels and a
""mom-mentary"" with the mothers of Will, Adam, and the other writer, Chris Henchy; it's quite funny...imagine your mom talking to the world about how hot The Rock is. And the unrated version has in this case truly edgy extras; use the marker feature to see how good some of the cut scenes were, and how blue. But the greatest and coolest surprise of this movie is the end scene about corporate conspiracy, and then the closing credits listing a bit of the litany of Goldman Sachs' brutal crimes against us all. I couldn't have been more amazed and impressed that McKay would use his platform to actually try to say something useful and true at the end of a Hollywood spoof. Well done, sir.

I think this flick will age well, and it's somehow very good to know that everybody watching this in the future will be reminded how much GS has ripped this country off. It's a good thing McKay mentions it, because it's sure being kept as quiet as possible while none of those weasels does one day of jail time for the biggest financial crime in American history. How weird that a cop satire says more about it than (the almost non-existent) documentaries manage to.

The Other Guys is good, with some great moments, and is recommended to any fan of any of the stars here, and those who just like to laugh.",1292544000,,2524,4.552863436123348
4029630,2,B002ZG99HC,"I was looking forward to this movie.  It sounded pretty good.  But for an action comedy, there is little action and most of the comedy just falls flat.  Will Farrell was just not funny in this one.  Mark Wahlberg is actually kinda funny in this.  Don't waste your time or money on this one.",1292371200,3,290,4.296296296296297

Maybe there just wasn't that connection between the actors, maybe it was just poorly executed..  Such are some things you may ask yourself after viewing this movie. It has it's moments. There are many laugh out loud points but overall they just don't seem too cohesive. The result is a movie that seems to go on despite the murmors in the theatre hoping it would come to a hault. It's never bad as there are plenty of stars to pull it back in line as it drifts (Samuel L. Jackson, The Rock, Michael Keaton.
I probably like Keaton as well as anyone as his role was quite funny- the police chief who has to get a job at BABW (because of the economy) and his character is endeering.
The rest is just too scripted and doesn't do anything different.

Being a huge Ferrell fan I did like this movie but the 2 or 3 others watching it with me all felt the same about it. If he wasn't in the film there would be very little apealing to make you want to view it. I think if you go into it expecting a good time you will be happy enough but I would look at this one as a rental at best.

4029634,5,B002ZG99HC,"I'm about 1/4 through the movie and I have to say it is a really funny movie.  Nothing less than what you expect of Will Ferrell, he is hilarious.  The funeral fight scene and then arguing in the car are the funniest parts thus far, but I'm sure there are more.  The funeral fight scene was the funniest, I won't give it away because it has to be seen for yourself.  It doesn't sound funny but just watch how they fight.  All in all, easily a 5 star movie so far, funnier than I thought it would be.",1292284800,2,499,4.051020408163265

A great cast, good script and well directed.",1292284800,2,302,3.646153846153846
4029636,3,B002ZG99HC,"Gamble and Hoitz (great cop names) are a couple of incompetent idiots who somehow managed to make it onto the force.  They've both got pasts, which keeps them doing desk jobs, while admiring the pair of super cops who can do no wrong, Highsmith and Danson (also great cop names).  But when they accidentally stumble upon a scheme (not knowing the full depth of the diabolical plan), they must man up and prove themselves to be the cops they've always wanted to be.  Or at least give it a shot.

THE OTHER GUYS is surprisingly enjoyable.  It's not nearly as good as some other Will Ferrell vehicles; but then, we all know that, funny as Ferrell can be, he can also miss the mark by a mile (LAND OF THE LOST?  SEMI-PRO?).  Here, he's pretty much good.  In fact, most of the acting is good--Mark Wahlberg shows some surprising comedy chops, deadpanning against Ferrell's showmanship.  Also along for the ride are Michael Keaton (a pleasant surprise); Rob Riggle and Damon Wayans, Jr., as Gamble and Hoitz's main competition; Steve Coogan, doing his TROPIC THUNDER supporting thing with equal brilliance; Eva Mendes, holding her own against Ferrell; and Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson as Highsmith and Danson, giving brilliant self-parodies that are unfortunately underused.

So, you're asking yourself: Why the three stars?  Because the film just doesn't congeal.  It feels shallow, unfinished; while the performances are all good, some of the jokes are left to dwindle.  There were very many potentially hilarious moments where the audience didn't laugh at all, because the film just didn't go that one extra step; and other instances where it went a step too far.  Adam McKay and Ferrell make a brilliant team (and we'll throw Wahlberg into the mix, hoping the three reunite for a movie again in the future); but this movie is one of their lesser efforts, primarily because it doesn't feel finished.  It's good for a few laughs, but nothing on the level of their previous collaborations.  It just isn't as memorable as ANCHORMAN, TALLADEGA NIGHTS, or STEP BROTHERS.  If you're a fan of Ferrell, or want to see Mark Wahlberg being intentionally funny (sounds harsh, but yeah, you remember THE HAPPENING), then you should see this movie.  It's not the best comedy of the year, but it's better than some other attempts at humor that we've been unfortunate enough to see.",1292112000,8,2372,4.872817955112219

At points its serious, and then it is the complete opposite the next minute, to the point of being rediculous. Will Ferell never ""goes there"" with his classic Anchorman rants, and Mark Wahlberg plays the most annoying character ever. It was just a mess of a movie, and I wanted to give it a low star rating, b/c I was sickened to see 4 stars, and so many positive reviews. Click the dislike button now, you freaking no-lifes.

I completely realize that there are people who don't like Farrell -- but this movie might -- MIGHT -- make those people laugh. Here Mark Wahlberg takes on the more outburst-y role while Farrell plays it a bit more reserved. Both roles give these guys moments to shine.

I actually didn't expect this movie to be as good as it turned out -- it seemed a little below the radar leading up to its release. But it has all the stuff that makes a Farrell movie great -- repeatable lines, improvised stuff, and perhaps best of all his relationship with his wife and Wahlberg's response to the ludicrous nature of it.

Anyway -- worth renting if you haven't seen it, and worth getting for those Farrell-friends that you have in your life!",1291852800,,858,4.45859872611465

4029761,3,B002ZG99HC,"Synopsis:  Detective Terry Hoitz (played by Mark Wahlberg) is an angry, yet not necessarily sharp, detective who is assigned to desk duty after accidentally shooting Derek Jeter (himself) at the World Series.  He's partnered up with Detective Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) who is a bookworm/improbable ladies man that would rather work behind a desk than get into the action.  Both of whom respect high-powered detectives Danson (Dwayne Johnson) and Highsmith (Samuel L. Jackson), who are respectively at the top of their game.  After Danson and Highsmith end up jumping to their deaths during a bank robbery, this opens up the opportunity for the ""other guys"" to step up and become the next big pair of detectives.  Though other tandems are taking over the cases that many consider to be tougher and higher priority, Hoitz and Gamble end up uncovering a plot by businessman David Ershon (Steve Coogan) to steal millions in order to cover his company's losses.  Will Hoitz learn to calm it down a bit in order to be effective? Will Gamble grow a pair?  Will ""the other guys"" be able to unfoil the plot or be unfoiled as police heroes while trying?  Michael Keaton appears as Gene Mauch the hard-nosed captain who moonlights at Bed, Bath, and Beyond while often quoting TLC lyrics.

Keaton was the largest reason while I enjoyed this film because I wasn't expecting him to be as laugh-out-loud funny as he was.  As for the others, Wahlberg's an action guy with a chip on his shoulder, Ferrel's a bumbling pseudo-nerd, and both Jackson and The Rock are hard-nosed and abrasive.  In short, there's really no surprises here; most everyone else is typecast in the types of roles they're known for and this film's no different.  It wasn't bad, just not something that knocked me off my socks.  Keaton's performance makes it a decent rental; fans of action-comedies or humor in the Will Ferrell variety will probably like it enough to purchase.",1291334400,,1935,4.8807339449541285

I could not stop laughing during this movie and watched it twice just to relive the antics, hear the one liners and see if I could catch Wahlberg laughing while trying to keep a straight face.  The reason this is funny is because there are so many references to old TV shows, famous TV personalities, typical story lines and cultural values (which are basically screwed up).  Of course, it is over the top but that is Will Ferrell's trademark.  The casting is on target and the one liners are continuous.

After spending good money to see this piece of garbage, I went the rest of the summer without seeing a movie. I wanted to see Salt, The Expendables, and other movies, but I just lost all faith in movies after this dumpage and didn't want to waste any more of my money. I finally went back to the theaters a few weeks ago and saw ""The Town"". That was a GOOD movie.

4029764,3,B002ZG99HC,"Judging from the previews months ago i really wanted to see this film because i like that Will Ferrell and Mark Walhberg were in a film like this together. It looked funny but i had hoped they didn't do that usual, show all the funny moments in the commercial deal as they usually do. Well sadly what you saw in the previews is what you see in the movie, but that doesnt really ruin them when you see the film. Ferrell and Walhberg have an excellent chemistry and they mesh well together as two loser cops trying to find there niche' after the parting of two super-hero cops, played by Samuel L Jackson, and The Rock. Thats about as depth as the story gets except for a man they are hunting down about scafeling permits, but i won't really comment on that as to not give to much away.

The movie finds itself in the usual mid range humor, to the more crude and hateful humor that you see in these types of film. It plays out a lot like a Naked Gun film with some of the initial silliness, but doesnt take it quite as far. Most of the jokes are clever, and cunning with a lot of well played out action sequences, which is rare for a comedy such as this. Explosions, car chases, and lots of shooting make this a comical Lethal Weapon of sorts and some of the over the top stunts give a big nod to those type of films. The language i thought was a bit over the top which could have gotten it an R rating to be honest, except for dropping the F-bomb once or twice which was unheard. But it was still enjoyable none the less. So if you want a little above the run of the mill buddy cop comedy film then this is for you. Stay away from a movie like Cop Out, its about as horrible as you can get. Also i would like to give a big thumbs up to Micheal Keaton for some very funny moments as the Police Captain, welcome back!!

Its nothing special but the other guys delivers some laughs in a well needed action type comedy, sure to please 70% of audiences. Just don't expect to be blown out of your seat.",1288569600,,1994,4.123393316195373

It's a buddy cop/bromance like Beverly Hills Cop would have been if John Ashton and Judge Reinhold were the stars instead of Eddie Murphy, because it isn't about the superstar cops.

Ferrell and Wahlberg play mismatched cop buddies who hit the streets trying to replace the recently departed dynamic duo (Johnson and Jackson).  Their polar opposite personalities make a good setup for the Laurel & Hardy and Abbott & Costello type of humor.  And, while I did find myself laughing out loud at times, there were other dry spells where I was slightly bored.  For me, some jokes hit and some missed.

As with most movies with Will Ferrell, you expect some crazy antics and this plot doesn't fail to deliver.  Some of the craziness was a bit over the top for me, however, and detracted slightly from my enjoyment.

Eva Mendes, who plays Ferrell's character's wife, is smoking hot, as usual.  In the storyline, she's undervalued by her husband, but Wahlberg's character picks up the slack by letting her know how much HE appreciates her every time he gets the chance.  What a nice guy!

Wow - what a movie! The laughs never stop in The Other Guys! I was literally laughing every two to three seconds, over and over again, non stop, for nearly two hours! Hands down, the funniest film of the year so far! And don't think for a second that all the laughs come solely from Will Ferrell; Mark Wahlberg, Michael Keaton and Eva Mendes are hysterical as well!

The first few minutes or so had me wondering what was up with my man Mark Wahlberg. I was like, `why is he over-acting so badly?' But the more layers we peeled back from his character, Terri Hoitz, I realized the beauty Wahlberg was giving the character. Hoitz is a pissed off child, throwing tantrum after tantrum and its hilarious!

Hoitz is so pissed because his desk-dork of a partner, Allen Gamble (Ferrell) wants nothing more out of his 9 to 5, than to be confined to the inside walls of their office. This does not sit well with Hoitz as he has a blood thirsty taste for action, and wants to be on the road with their piers, taking down the bad guys. Whatever do these two do for a living, you ask? Hoitz and Gamble are New York detectives who are the laughing stock of the entire police department. Unlike their hot-shot comrades, they are referred to as - the other guys.

Officer Hoitz realizes he has to do something drastic if he is to get Gamble to go on a call with him. So naturally, after losing it with Gamble numerous times in the humorous opening sequence, Hoitz comes does just that; the details of which will not be divulged here.  Just know that they take a call, and a case develops which is the entire force for the entire movie. In most films, this is called the `plot.'

I wouldn't really call it a plot in this case however; for in most films, the plot would be comparable to a heart or some other vital organ that keeps the movie going. No, it's not vital at all in The Other Guys; it's more like a container, to fill with lots of useless stuff!  But everyone involved in this film knows that you are either going to love it or hate it, and if you love it then it requires no plot at all!

Nine and a half times out of 10 any movie that relied on this method, would not be a stellar flick; but The Other Guys is the rare exception. The movie is simply so much fun, and is stuffed with so many brilliant laughs, that we don't even have the lung power to calm down from our fits of dry heaving laughter, to even worry with a plot! There's a bad guy, he's doing bad stuff and our guys are out to stop him; that's all we need - now dump all the funny stuff right on top of it, please!

We know Mark Wahlberg can act, so let's talk about Mr. Ferrell for a minute shall we? What a performance. He's playing an idiot as usual, yes; but he's so damn good at it here. Just like Steve Carell in Dinner for Schmucks, Ferrell is so into character - that you really believe he is this ridiculous of a tool. You believe him when he tells Mark Wahlberg that he has about six copies of the Little River Band CD in his Prius. And you believe him when he explains that he was so intoxicated that he honestly mistook a tube of tooth paste for astronaut food.

Ferrell is a comedic genius; easily in the top five best comics working today. His height, body type and child like sensibility give him an edge over other comics. He also has a divine gift of pronouncing things in a gravely entertaining fashion; such as the way he referred to the female mountain lion as `Karen' in Talladega Nights, or how he repeatedly calls his Captain (Michael Keaton) by his first name, `Gene', in this film. These aren't necessarily funny names on their own, but coming out of Ferrell's mouth while in his shiny little character - they're as good as gold!

I loved the scenes with Eva Mendes. She really pushed the comedy with Ferrell as a couple who we look at and just ask `how?' and `why?' Walberg's character Hoitz particularly finds them an odd match when he is invited over for dinner. He must have asked nearly half a dozen times who she was; not buying for a second that she could possibly be Gamble's wife in even the slightest minute form of reality.

Most films would not have had the guts to try a joke like this that many times, but The Other Guys does, and I'm thankful for it! Far too many times have I wished a comedy would take the joke to the next level; just slide it a tad bit further past the line of normal acceptance, before it's gone too far. The Other Guys carries its jokes to that same line, carefully sets them down before it, looks the audience dead in the eye - and then hauls off and boots it across the line, time and time again! I know some audience members will find this tiresome, but I found it refreshing, to see a film that just doesn't give a damn and knows how much fun it truly is.

And before we leave, we can't not mention the performance of the man himself - Michael Keaton. Where has he been? Man, do I miss him! He killed as the Captain here folks, let me tell you. His little back story for his character and what he does with his spare time, nearly threw me out of my seat laughing. Classic, classic stuff! I've long missed seeing Keaton's physical mannerisms when he's going off in a rant, and they are nicely on display once more for us, in this movie.

Writer and director Adam McKay has a perfect record with his four films. All of them starring Will Ferrell, and all of them sensational. From Anchorman, to Talladega Nights, to Step Brothers to The Other Guys; where will he take us next? I don't care if it's a black and white musical with Muppets, giant skunks, vampires and dinosaurs; I'll be in line to buy a ticket to his next film.",1283990400,6,6010,4.289496910856134

Naturally, Allen is at first hesitant in joining Terry to get some of the glory of being known as a top detective.

4029882,5,B002ZG99HC,""" The Other Guys"" is now the funniest movie I have ever seen! I went to the movies last week to see the film and laughed so hard I thought I would have to leave the theater for being disruptive. A storyline that pulses from the very beginning, the use of backstory, character development, political and government references, a boatload of cameo appearances, the ""frozen pic"" bar scene, the sexual reference humor with a twist, the comments from Captain Gary, the  comedic reference to theToyota Prius and the absolutely SICK (ie cool) soundtrack are reasons to see this movie!  ( And I didn't even give any information about the movie away!!).

 For those who are not huge Will Farrell fans, Mark Walhburg and other characters keep him in check with comments and prevents too much silliness. Very enjoyable with an audience.

I went back to the theater and saw it again the next week! ( I never, ever do that!)

Regarding the soundtrack, I have been unable to locate the song that Mark popped into the CD player by Gorgon Thunder,  Let Loose the Dragon.  ( Sigh)",1282348800,2,1063,4.647058823529412
4029883,4,B002ZG99HC,"I don't think I'm saying anything terribly controversial or original when I state that Will Farrell movies tend to be a mixed bag.  His most beloved star vehicles TALLEDEGA NIGHTS and ANCHORMAN, feature many truly hilarious moments, but also moments that just seem a bit weird and random.  Farrell and his friend/co-writer/director Adam McKay just can't seem to stop taking diversions that are little more than whims.  Sometimes these random moments have a life and excitement of their own (Ron Burgundy playing the flute in a restaurant), others are simply head-scratchers.

It's a measure of how expensive THE OTHER GUYS must have been to make when I thought of how few of these quirky diversions Farrell takes.  McKay & Co. have made a more straightforward comedy, one relying heavily on expensive action sequences...and thus must have felt a bit more constrained to sticking with a linear plot and not a series of sketches held together with a theme.

But it's also a measure of Farrell's talent that the film still feels fresh and offbeat.  Farrell plays a police detective who is really just an accountant with a badge and gun.  He works his desk and hums while typing on his keyboard.  He loves to see others running to where the action is...and loves staying safely at his desk.  He'd probably be happy doing this his entire career, except that he's also got a VERY reluctant partner (Mark Wahlberg)...a once up-and-coming hotshot cop who accidentally put a bullet into Derek Jeter, costing the Yankees a World Series.  Wahlberg urgently wants to get back on the streets...and when NYPD loses two of its most famous cops (Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson)...his desperate need reaches a boiling point, and he DRAGS Farrell out into the field.  Unfortunately, Farrell's vehicle is a Prius, and it's very non-threatening profile generates some pretty funny wisecracks.  (""I literally feel like I'm riding inside a vagina,"" says Wahlberg.)

It is very amusing to see Wahlberg making fun of his usual intensity.  Imagine his character in THE DEPARTED almost totally neutered by a career blunder.  He's got good timing, and creates genuine chemistry with Farrell.  Eva Mendes is welcome as Farrell's wife...she's WAY too hot to be married to Farrell, yet Farrell's character seems to draw hot women to him.  It's so non-sensical as to be quite funny...particularly in the way it perplexes Wahlberg.  Mendes, in many films, consistently shows flashes of having some nice comic ability, but has yet to be truly challenged.  THE OTHER GUYS doesn't challenge her either...her character is more of a device than a real person.

There are other nice supporting turns.  Steve Coogan is always nice to see.  Michael Keaton has a thankless role as the captain...but still gets off a few nice one-liners.  Jackson & Johnson are hilarious (and their early scenes spoofing car chases and the mayhem they cause are pretty impressive).  I must say, though, that I'd gladly never see Rob Riggle in a film again.  Here and in THE HANGOVER, he plays obnoxious, toxic cops to virtually no comic effect.  He's loud and amused with himself.

But the film belongs to Farrell.  He once again brings his character who is outwardly calm but clearly seething with repressed emotions.  But Farrell has dug just a little bit deeper here.  He's tried to bring logic to his character, rather than simply serving comic needs.  The turmoil he is roiling with seems genuine.  I gather from interviews and such that Farrell is a fairly happy family man.  But he also encapsulates what a lot of people feel, I think..the feeling of being trapped in a life that isn't entirely what one imagined when setting out in the world.  He carries an inchoate rage.  In Farrell's hands, this is mined for humor...but you can also imagine how quickly it could be mined for drama.  He's a master at teetering between out-of-control and dangerously out-of-control.

There are a couple of Farrell & McKay's patented ""random"" moments.  While drinking with Wahlberg in an Irish pub, Farrell frequently stops mid-conversation to sing verses in sad Irish songs while accompanied by an older chorus of Irish men.  It's odd but somehow charming.  But the film has many sustained jokes that continue to pay off.  Coogan (as a Wall Street bad-guy) keeps putting off tough questioning by offering Farrell & Wahlberg tickets to Broadway shows.  They accept and then beat themselves up later when they realize they've been bribed.

I laughed a lot.  That's ultimately they key to my recommendation.  But I certainly appreciate the fact that the filmmakers realized they had a good concept and gave it some meat.  Farrell was allowed to create a fully realized comic creation, and was given a stellar supporting cast.  Wahlberg was probably the best possible choice to play the partner...and although I hope it doesn't happen I can certainly envision a sequel.",1281916800,6,4906,4.976629766297663
4029884,4,B002ZG99HC,"Like Laurel and Hardy, like Abbot and Costello, like Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg are perfectly mismatched in the buddy cop film ""The Other Guys,"" although outward appearances suggest this would not be the case. They could not be anything less alike, physically, behaviorally, or even professionally; Wahlberg, for example, has been nominated for an Oscar, and Ferrell ... hasn't. Despite this - or perhaps because of this - they play off of each other with the timing and precision of natural born comedians. They are, quite simply, inherently funny together. I haven't seen a better pairing of actors in a comedy for quite some time, save only for Steve Carrel and Tina Fey in this year's ""Date Night,"" where they were given license to flaunt their impressive improvisational skills.

""The Other Guys"" is, in this reviewer's humble opinion, one of the year's funniest films. It is not, however, merely a vehicle for Ferrell and Wahlberg to act goofy in front of the camera; director Adam McKay and his writing partner Chris Henchy actually bother to tell a story, and they put their characters into genuinely humorous situations. This is quite a turnaround for McKay, whose previous film, ""Step Brothers,"" reached a new low, begging the question of why comedies weren't allowed to be funny anymore. I doubt he read my review for that film, but perhaps he came to understand that, to get a real comical reaction from the audience, he must provide them with more than vulgar characters and disposable one-liners comprised mostly of four-letter words. Let's hope he keeps this in mind for his next film.

The film opens with Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson as a pair of hotshot New York cops, who, along with just about everyone else, painfully mock the NYPD's lowliest staff members - otherwise known as the other guys. These include Detectives Allen Gamble (Ferrell), a forensic accountant, and Terry Hoitz (Wahlberg), a former street cop. Gamble is calm and gullible, the kind of guy who plays it safe, likes to hum his favorite songs, isn't the quickest when it comes to punch lines, and is perfectly content doing paperwork. Hoitz, on the other hand, is angry and bitter, hungry for some actual police work and not at all comfortable with sitting behind a desk all day. He has been stuck with Gamble ever since embarrassing himself in public incident, the details of which are too funny to give away.

For reasons I will not reveal, Gamble and Hoitz have the opportunity to step up and be real detectives, which will hopefully win them some degree of respect. Gamble, through his paperwork, becomes suspicious of a wealthy British investor (Steve Coogan), although no one, not even the police captain (Michael Keaton), takes the case seriously. Because of this, things go from bad to worse every time Gamble and Hoitz delve further into the investigation. To describe every bad moment between them, to mention every disaster that befalls them, would do little more than ruin the hilarity. I will say, however, that there are many well-written jokes related to Gamble's mock wooden gun (a replacement for his actual gun) and his Prius, which in due time loses one of its doors and is riddled with bullet holes.

A curious but nonetheless amusing recurring gag involves Gamble's wife, a doctor named Sheila, played by the indisputably beautiful Eva Mendes. She's so gorgeous that Hoitz is at a loss to explain why Gamble thinks she's merely ordinary. She's also quite accommodating, at times exceedingly so, and yet Gamble continuously refers to her as an unbearable nag. This is, we eventually discover, a trend in Gamble's life, having previously been involved with - and indifferent to - a number of smoking hot women, the kind most men would give their eye-teeth to spend just an hour with. Let is suffice to say that Gamble has his reasons for being the man he is. Let it also suffice to say that Hoitz and Gamble are on completely different frequencies when it comes to women. This connects to the film's one weakness: Hoitz's romance with an aspiring ballet dancer, an unnecessary character who's part of an equally unnecessary subplot.

Perhaps the greatest achievement of ""The Other Guys"" is the way it uses comedy to send an insightful message about corporate greed, partly through the antics of Coogan's character but most obviously through a series of graphs and figures displayed during the end credits. I recommend you stay and study them carefully. You may learn a thing or two. If you simply don't have the time for them, at least you'll have seen Ferrell and Wahlberg in action, and that is truly a sight to behold. Yes, it's an unlikely pairing, but oh, what a pairing it is. They're such a great team. I wouldn't mind seeing their surnames displayed on marquees and posters, immortally joined, able to draw in audiences with the promise of a comedy classic. Ferrell and Wahlberg. It has a certain ring to it, doesn't it?",1281571200,4,4977,4.871310507674144
4029885,5,B002ZG99HC,"Will Ferrell is an admirable actor, and what I particularly admire about him is his fearlessness. Sometimes he plays a button down guy as in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stranger-Than-Fiction/dp/B000LXH0AE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stranger Than Fiction</a>, who breaks out of his everyday character and finds true love in the process, and sometimes he is just an over the top alpha male as in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Talladega-Nights-The-Ballad-of-Ricky-Bobby-Unrated-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000J4P9P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Talladega Nights - The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (Unrated Widescreen Edition)</a>or a lovable jerk as in Anchor Man, and let's not forget the random acts of unnecessary nudity as in Old School.

Mark Wahlberg appears to be getting better and better. Shooter is perhaps my favorite. In recent movies, I think he has vastly expanded his range as an actor. In&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Departed-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000M341QE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Departed (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;he was a typical alpha male police detective, yet in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lovely-Bones/dp/B003IBEH02/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lovely Bones</a>&nbsp;he offered a very delicately nuanced portrayal of a grieving father.

When you put these two guys together on screen in this movie you have movie magic. Because The Other Guys manages to accomplish what other comedies do not, which is to be funny without even trying.

A large part of the credit has to go not only to the actors, but also to the writers. In Gamble and Hoitz they play two cops who have fallen from grace and end up being partnered together.

As you might expect we learn more about them as we go along. Hoitz hates Gamble, and has rage management issues, and occasionally goes off at Gamble over the fact that he just does not like him. Everything he does is annoying. A particularly funny bit is the Lion Tuna metaphor, which had me clutching my sides.

The desk pop, faceback, meeting Gamble's hot wife played by Eva Mendez, channeling the inner pimp, the Prius, the coked up crime scene, wooden gun, every situation is hilarious, but also very well paced. We are allowed to recover a little before the next situation happens.

Perhaps the revelation in this movie is Wahlberg, outside of his usual genre, showing how funny he can be, and Ferrell shows that he can be funny even playing a character who is an introvert who would sit behind the desk than hit the streets, funny without even trying.

Both of these fallen cops accidentally stumble onto a major fraud, they get heat from above, they persist, deepening the fall from grace. We also have brief performances from Dwayne The Rock Johnson, Samuel L Jackson, and two words from Brooke Shields.

Inevitably, perhaps one must compare with another recent cop comedy Cop Out. Let's just say that this movie is incomparably better, and about the best comedy I have seen in almost a year. I hope this was helpful.",1281571200,2,3167,5.9298245614035086
4029886,4,B002ZG99HC,"I thought this movie was incredibly funny. Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg were awesome together. This movie has just as much action as it does comedy. Detectives Terry Hoitz and Allen Gamble are stuck behind a desk and want a piece of the action. When their idols, Danson and Highsmith die, Gamble and Hoitz decide to step up. (I love how they don't get along in the beginning, and are always at each others throats) They try to bring down a billionaire investment banker named David Ershon.

4029887,1,B002ZG99HC,"""The Other Guys"" looked like it might be funny from the trailers, but it disappoints from the first slapstick, sloppy chase scene.  Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg  play wannabe Police heroes.  They have a chance at being just that when the two top cops at NYPD are killed during that first chase scene, where they racked up millions of dollars worth of damage to catch a petty Marijuana user.  One awkward implausible scene after another follows, as the actors read deadpan the unfunny and predictable script.

The movie must have an ad every other scene as we watch chases in the Toyota Prius,  moonlighting jobs at Bed, Bath and Beyond, CNBC and Financial Market News, University of Phoenix, Broadway shows, basketball games,  and on and on.  The audience that attended this movie the same time I did rarely laughed.  The plot was sad as it just reminds one of how the people in finance keep taking advantage of middle class America.  Watching the game playing and gambling of  Wall Street taking pension funds was depressing.  Too close to the truth to be funny.

Overall, I found the movie dumb and bland.",1281312000,9,1109,4.7434554973821985
