2992710,5,B000WW1YOM,"My childhood was filled with this series. The videogames, movies, shows and merch. This classic is much better than what they play today. Misty, Brock and Ash treck along trying to obtain gym badges. There is lots of great humour and sarcasm. This is truly one of the best series of the 1990's. The Dvd's all work and I'm very pleased!",1274745600,,335,4.508196721311475

2992714,5,B000WW1YOM,Pokemon Season 1 (Indigo Legaue) is finally complete with this 3rd installment of the box-set by Viz. Great artwork makes it a package when placed together with sets 1 and 2. This is also the only DVD set that completes season 1 to date.,1217721600,,237,4.409090909090909

2992716,3,B000WW1YOM,"I enjoyed watching Pokemon when I was growing up, and so when they released the box set I had to get it. Unfortunately, Viz Media doesn't quite live up to the anime DVD standards set by other companies. The overall lack of quality was really disappointing.

- The cases themselves feel really flimsy and weak. My first thought when I touched them was ""bootleg."" The box art is colorful but really kind of plain. It just didn't look as polished and professional as other anime DVDs, which was shocking since I dare say Pokemon is probably one of the most popular (or at least well-known) anime series of all time. Furthermore, there are no included inserts: just an episode list that looks exactly the same as the one on the back covers of each DVD. (I wonder why they even bothered?)

- DVD menus are colorful, albeit very plain and minimalistic (only options are ""play"" and ""episodes""). No Japanese track, and no subtitles. No extras either. You get the dubbed episodes plus the full Pokerap (which isn't a menu option, so you have to skip to it). Again, the price is comparable to the Cowboy Bebop or Big O collections, which also have 26 episodes, but those collections include the full Japanese language track, subtitles, and extra bonuses. AND the box art, DVD menus, and overall quality just feel more professional.

- ""Princess versus Princess"" and ""The Purr-fect Hero"" are the first episodes in this collection, which were taken out of order from the second collection and stuck here. It's nice that they did put these episodes in (as opposed to leaving them out altogether, like what they did with ""Beauty and the Beach"") but it's a bit odd that they didn't just put them in order. It's not that big a deal since Pokemon is fairly episodic, so the chronology of things isn't messed up too much.

- These videos aren't uncut and uncensored, like what you'd find with most typical anime. That's fine with me, since it's not like 4Kids censored or cut a whole lot of stuff from these episodes anyway, but it's still worth noting here. Digital paint is out in full force, mostly just to cover up Japanese text that was present in the original. If you didn't care when you first saw these episodes on TV, you won't care now.

- The video and audio quality are beautiful, and exactly what I had hoped for. Certain scenes might seem kind of ""glitchy,"" but that's because the original animators went back and slowed down the framerate and muted the colors because of the infamous seizure incident. Those scenes really stick out and look funky and ridiculous, but that's not Viz's (or 4Kid's) problem.

Even though I love these episodes, I cannot in good conscience give this collection higher than three stars, an ""average"" rating: these DVDs contain only the bare minimum to be considered a ""collector's box set."" Poor production values, combined with zero extras and a rather steep price, hold this back from being really exceptional. If they threw in the Japanese track, a handful of extras, and stronger DVD cases, then we'll talk. As it stands, these are only slightly better than my old VHS recordings of the show, and those tapes didn't cost me $35.

Again, I compare this collection to Cowboy Bebop or Big O: all three series include 26 episodes, but Cowboy and Big O just have so much more. I would've expected Viz to handle Pokemon, part of a multi-billion dollar franchise, with the same kind of respect and reverence afforded to these relatively obscure series.",1212883200,33,3474,4.71334431630972
2992717,5,B000WW1YOM,"I remember watching the original Pokemon Series when I was a little kid. I used to struggle all the time to find every DVD of the Indigo Series.

2992718,4,B000WW1YOM,"This set was interesting.  It's set up just like the others.  However, it includes some of the episodes emitted from the other sets like Holiday Hi Jynx and Princess versus princess among others.",1202342400,3,195,4.878787878787879

I just bought Volume 2 today (I was at Best Buy and hadn't realized the release date snuck up on me), and was stoked to be one step closer to owning the original season that was such a huge part of my childhood in its entirety.

2992731,5,B000WW1YOM,"Great, great, great! It includes the karaoke songs at the end of the episodes. Although I am confused that two episodes were out of order. The Christmas episode with Jynx (never knew that existed) and the Snow In episode where Ash and his pokemon separate from Brock and Misty in a snow storm. Apart from these two episodes being out of order, this DVD is awesome!",1396915200,,364,4.53030303030303
2992732,5,B000WW1YOM,"Disclaimer: This review contains potential spoilers.

We've followed Ash for two box sets, and now we're in the home stretch.  Ash has all eight badges needed to finally enter the Pokmon League!  While fans will undoubtedly enjoy the League episodes, Ash and friends have a lot of other amazing adventures together before getting to that point.  With that in mind, 'Holiday Hi-Jynx' is my absolute favorite from this set.  After all, no self-respecting anime is complete without a feel-good Christmas special.  'The Misty Mermaid' is also a great episode that centers around teamwork and family.

Again, it's a bit disappointing that PUSA didn't include any special disc features, but having the episodes themselves is worth the price alone.  Also, the box art features a lot of Ash's Pokmon which is always a plus (though while I can understand the inclusion of Raichu, the choice to include Machop is certainly interesting to say the least).",1395705600,,943,5.077922077922078

Well i'm here to give credit where credit is due. i've loved Pokemon ever since i was 5 when i first got Pokemon Yellow Version for my gameboy Color and i loved the first two seasons (Indigo League and Johto Journeys).

My son loves pokemon but I'm not a fan of the new stuff. It's most def not nearly as creative as the originals. So now my kids can watch the same show I did growing up and I can answer most q's that they have. I would recommend getting the complete 1st season along with the Adventures on the Orange Islands box set. That's a total of 12 dvds!

Rewatching my childhood show was the best thing ever. I recommend this to anyone whose a pokemon trainer and wants to see where pokemon's first pokemon journey started to take off. The original soundtrack and cast MADE this the best season ever. At a well afordable price i say buy all 3 parts of the first season and enjoy.

For those who don't know, Holiday Hi-Jynx was banned after it's first or second American airing. The pokemon jynx was considered racist by a Carole Boston Weatherford, a concerned parent, and after seeing the episode contacted 4kids about it. They removed the episode from syndication promptly, and Nintendo recolored jynx in later incarnations to be purple. Her origional black skin and big red lips seemed to be depicting african americans in a racist fashion popular in the 1930s and 40s.

When I saw that it was on the box set, I wondered if it was the rumored edited version where jynx was purple. I was really happy to see that it was the origional american broadcast version. It would be nice if the set was uncut with origional dialog, but it could have been worse. They could have left this eisode out, or edited it to purple.",1322524800,,964,4.738095238095238

So, when I stumbled across this box set, I was super excited. So, I coughed up the money. My package arrived promptly (as fast as a super saver shipping does...5 DAYS!!...that's another story). No, the video quality isn't crystal clear HD, but I think people forget that these episodes were made in 90's...NOTHING WAS IN HD. From what I can recall, the video quality remains true to it's original form, and I enjoy that about this box set. It reminds me how and why I fell in love with the series. The ONLY problems I encountered was that in one or two of the box sets (I purchases vol. 1-3 all at the same time, but I didn't want to write an individual review for each one)two of the episodes are out of order. (SPOILER ALERT): In one episode Ash's charmeleon evolves to a charizard, but in a future episode Ash's still has a charmander...weird. Also, there is an episode where Jessie (from team rocket) has a lickitung, but the previous episodes didn't explain how she obtained lickitung. Originally, I thought she might have caught it in the banned episode (not included in this box set), but a few episodes past this one, we actually see Jessie capturing lickitung...again, weird.

3227213,3,B000WW1YOM,"I enjoyed watching Pokemon when I was growing up, and so when they released the box set I had to get it. Unfortunately, Viz Media doesn't quite live up to the anime DVD standards set by other companies. The overall lack of quality was really disappointing.

- The cases themselves feel really flimsy and weak. My first thought when I touched them was ""bootleg."" The box art is colorful but really kind of plain. It just didn't look as polished and professional as other anime DVDs, which was shocking since I dare say Pokemon is probably one of the most popular (or at least well-known) anime series of all time. Furthermore, there are no included inserts: just an episode list that looks exactly the same as the one on the back covers of each DVD. (I wonder why they even bothered?)

- DVD menus are colorful, albeit very plain and minimalistic (only options are ""play"" and ""episodes""). No Japanese track, and no subtitles. No extras either. You get the dubbed episodes plus the full Pokerap (which isn't a menu option, so you have to skip to it). Again, the price is comparable to the Cowboy Bebop or Big O collections, which also have 26 episodes, but those collections include the full Japanese language track, subtitles, and extra bonuses. AND the box art, DVD menus, and overall quality just feel more professional.

- ""Princess versus Princess"" and ""The Purr-fect Hero"" are the first episodes in this collection, which were taken out of order from the second collection and stuck here. It's nice that they did put these episodes in (as opposed to leaving them out altogether, like what they did with ""Beauty and the Beach"") but it's a bit odd that they didn't just put them in order. It's not that big a deal since Pokemon is fairly episodic, so the chronology of things isn't messed up too much.

- These videos aren't uncut and uncensored, like what you'd find with most typical anime. That's fine with me, since it's not like 4Kids censored or cut a whole lot of stuff from these episodes anyway, but it's still worth noting here. Digital paint is out in full force, mostly just to cover up Japanese text that was present in the original. If you didn't care when you first saw these episodes on TV, you won't care now.

- The video and audio quality are beautiful, and exactly what I had hoped for. Certain scenes might seem kind of ""glitchy,"" but that's because the original animators went back and slowed down the framerate and muted the colors because of the infamous seizure incident. Those scenes really stick out and look funky and ridiculous, but that's not Viz's (or 4Kid's) problem.

Even though I love these episodes, I cannot in good conscience give this collection higher than three stars, an ""average"" rating: these DVDs contain only the bare minimum to be considered a ""collector's box set."" Poor production values, combined with zero extras and a rather steep price, hold this back from being really exceptional. If they threw in the Japanese track, a handful of extras, and stronger DVD cases, then we'll talk. As it stands, these are only slightly better than my old VHS recordings of the show, and those tapes didn't cost me $35.

Again, I compare this collection to Cowboy Bebop or Big O: all three series include 26 episodes, but Cowboy and Big O just have so much more. I would've expected Viz to handle Pokemon, part of a multi-billion dollar franchise, with the same kind of respect and reverence afforded to these relatively obscure series.",1212883200,33,3474,4.71334431630972

3227229,5,B000WW1YOM,"Disclaimer: This review contains potential spoilers.

We've followed Ash for two box sets, and now we're in the home stretch.  Ash has all eight badges needed to finally enter the Pokmon League!  While fans will undoubtedly enjoy the League episodes, Ash and friends have a lot of other amazing adventures together before getting to that point.  With that in mind, 'Holiday Hi-Jynx' is my absolute favorite from this set.  After all, no self-respecting anime is complete without a feel-good Christmas special.  'The Misty Mermaid' is also a great episode that centers around teamwork and family.

Again, it's a bit disappointing that PUSA didn't include any special disc features, but having the episodes themselves is worth the price alone.  Also, the box art features a lot of Ash's Pokmon which is always a plus (though while I can understand the inclusion of Raichu, the choice to include Machop is certainly interesting to say the least).",1395705600,,943,5.077922077922078

3227268,5,B000WW1YOM,"This DVD collection is great. Season 1 was the best and had the best Pokemon. It is so nice being able to watch them all in order. Each disk has around 9 episodes on it. The scene selection is just ok. I would prefer to be able to skip the intro sometimes, but it is not a big deal.

Definitely worth every penny.",1358553600,,313,3.9682539682539684

3227273,5,B000WW1YOM,Nothing much to say about this but the 1st season was the best season. A true pokemon adventure all the way to the end with an exciting finish. Rewatching my childhood show was the best thing ever. I recommend this to anyone whose a pokemon trainer and wants to see where pokemon's first pokemon journey started to take off. The original soundtrack and cast MADE this the best season ever. At a well afordable price i say buy all 3 parts of the first season and enjoy. Oh and this product did arrive earlier than expected which i was quite happy with.,1354147200,,551,4.411764705882353

The only complaint I have was that the box itself was a little damaged, but since the DVDs are the important part and were not damaged, I didn't let it affect my rating. Maybe be a little careful with the packaging? But anyway, really great product, and it's nice to finally have the complete first season, minus the banned episodes.",1348185600,,384,4.5
3227277,3,B000WW1YOM,"I just received this in the mail, after receiving the other two volumes of the first season.  This one came pretty beat up, with scratches on the box.  Other than that the disks are in tip top shape!  The handling was not good.",1327881600,,227,4.232558139534884

3227280,5,B000WW1YOM,"I'm not talking about beauty and the beach, legend of dratini, or computer warior porigon, but they did include Holiday Hi-jynx. For those who don't know, Holiday Hi-Jynx was banned after it's first or second American airing. The pokemon jynx was considered racist by a Carole Boston Weatherford, a concerned parent, and after seeing the episode contacted 4kids about it. They removed the episode from syndication promptly, and Nintendo recolored jynx in later incarnations to be purple. Her origional black skin and big red lips seemed to be depicting african americans in a racist fashion popular in the 1930s and 40s.

When I saw that it was on the box set, I wondered if it was the rumored edited version where jynx was purple. I was really happy to see that it was the origional american broadcast version. It would be nice if the set was uncut with origional dialog, but it could have been worse. They could have left this eisode out, or edited it to purple.",1322524800,,964,4.738095238095238
3227281,5,B000WW1YOM,"I have been an avid pokemon fan since childhood. I've definitely been craving some sort of compilation of episodes that I could watch where ever and whenever I want. So, when I stumbled across this box set, I was super excited. So, I coughed up the money. My package arrived promptly (as fast as a super saver shipping does...5 DAYS!!...that's another story). No, the video quality isn't crystal clear HD, but I think people forget that these episodes were made in 90's...NOTHING WAS IN HD. From what I can recall, the video quality remains true to it's original form, and I enjoy that about this box set. It reminds me how and why I fell in love with the series. The ONLY problems I encountered was that in one or two of the box sets (I purchases vol. 1-3 all at the same time, but I didn't want to write an individual review for each one)two of the episodes are out of order. (SPOILER ALERT): In one episode Ash's charmeleon evolves to a charizard, but in a future episode Ash's still has a charmander...weird. Also, there is an episode where Jessie (from team rocket) has a lickitung, but the previous episodes didn't explain how she obtained lickitung. Originally, I thought she might have caught it in the banned episode (not included in this box set), but a few episodes past this one, we actually see Jessie capturing lickitung...again, weird. Overall, I am happy with my purchase, and I'd recommend this box set to anyone who enjoys pokemon just as much as I still do.",1314316800,,1476,4.59469696969697

8225947,4,B000WW1YOM,"Was extremely excited to see this finally get released on DVD.  No problems to speak of and the show is exactly as I remember it.  One issue, of a technical nature (perhaps fixed on newer pressings?) is that hitting ""next chapter"" during the intro theme will take you back to the start of the first episode on the disc rather than the start of the episode you're supposed to be on.  I guess it's a coding issue that there's only one Intro on the disc and it jumps back to that, then back to the episode it's supposed to be on.  Just don't hit ""skip"" or ""Next chapter"" during the intro and you're fine though.",1451779200,,608,4.260869565217392

8225950,5,B000WW1YOM,"This is the version of the 3rd volume of Pok&eacute;mon to buy if you want everything, well everything that was released from the Indigo League season.

This release from 2009 features the episode ""Holiday Hi-Jynx"", which has been omitted by Viz Media in the more recent re-release of Season 1, Part 3 (released October 28, 2014), and the matching Complete Series set (with 78 episodes, again released in 2014), due to the controversy surrounding the episode as it features the Pok&eacute;mon; Jynx, back when it sported it's ""Black Face"" look, which some saw as being racist. So if you want to have this episode, this is the only set to get to acquire this episode.

As for the remaining 3 other episodes (some of which were from earlier in the season), ""Beauty and the Beach"" (set between ""Island of the Giant Pok&eacute;mon"" and ""Tentacool and Tentacruel"") was dubbed by 4Kids, but in reality shouldn't have been, as it features a scene where James of Team Rocket wearing a bikini outfit, plus fake breasts, which is inappropriate for younger viewers, at least outside of Japan. So that episode has not been released on DVD.

The other two were not dubbed at all, ""The Legend of Dratini"" where Ash captures his Tauros in the Safari Zone was not dubbed, due to there being a hunter in that episode, who used a gun throughout it, something of which may upset young children in seeing Pok&eacute;mon getting shot and ""Electric Soldier Porygon"" wasn't dubbed due to this being the infamous episode which gave children in Japan severe seizures, many sources say that it was caused by Porygon itself, some say it was background flashes and some say it was electric attacks by Pikachu, but it could be a result of all of those things put into one. It wasn't dubbed in the end, due to health concerns.

This set also features the episodes ""The Perrrfect Hero"" and ""Princess Vs. Princess"", which was moved over to this volume, instead of being present in the last one.

So if you're a completest, then this version is the set for you and just ignore the re-release, unless missing one episode won't bother you so much? Perhaps one day they make fix the episode ""Holiday Hi-Jynx"" by altering the colour so that Jynx will sport it's purple face, rather then it's black one, but only time will tell I Viz or Pok&eacute;mon USA will do something about that issue and return that episode into rotation.",1424995200,,2391,4.724220623501199
