5373499,4,B009Z1HHU6,This is an excellent faith based movie that deals with issues that can effects all of us.  It has a great storyline and I look forward to watching more movies from this Director. Keep up the good work and keep making movies that I can watch with my Family.,1362614400,2,256,4.224489795918367
5373500,2,B009Z1HHU6,The storyline had great potential but the pacing and camera work was not the best.  Also more thought could have been put into the scenes and props.  Sometimes less is more if you make it a quality effort.  The acting was not too bad.  I say this because I'm a fan of positive films with a message of redemption and I always root for them.  At the end of the day I give credit that the effort was made because it takes a lot to even get to this point.  Praying for future blessings for the the filmmaker's vision.,1362096000,3,513,4.1313131313131315
5373501,5,B009Z1HHU6,"Finally a movie about faith and proper relationships that I can watch with my children.  I appreciate the story line and the positive message in the movie.  This is a great movie to discuss the importance of forgiveness among sibling.  The importance of ""better of worse""  for married couples.  The importance of 2nd and third chances for people who feel defeated.  The importance of open communication for those in a relationship.  Great movie with a strong message!  A movie that you do not have to send the kids in the other room!  Job well done!",1361232000,,549,4.6947368421052635
5373502,4,B009Z1HHU6,"""Under the Cherry Tree"" is an awesome entry for Mixon and his team as they break into the movie industry.  The movie depicts the intertwining of family, faith, and friends that we all encounter on our life's journey.  More so, it guides us and gives us insight into the journey towards forgiveness - of self and others.  In spite of the movie's minor production budget, it makes a major impact on its viewers!  As a neophyte film for neophyte filmmaker Cedric, I am impressed with his ability to move this film from idea to reality.  The movie's storyline (complete with the themes of love, hope, and forgiveness) seems to parallel Mixon's real world determination and efforts to overcome all obstacles toward seeing this project through from start to finish.  I encourage everyone to judge this movie for themselves- in and through their own eyes (and heart).  Look beyond the typical Hollywood pizzazz (or lack thereof) towards the greater message resonating from the movie screen.  Nothing is flawless, and this movie will inspire you to pursue broken relationships and lost dreams all in one.  Keep up the good work.  I look for more great things to come from you, Cedric!",1360886400,4,1176,4.864321608040201
5373503,5,B009Z1HHU6,"Having been a part of this film & not really knowing what it would be about as we were doing the film, then seeing
  the end result at the screening I was very proud and honored to have been a part of the film, because the messsage was great and movies like this one is much needed in Hollywood to inspire & uplift our youth ecspecially to reach for whatever it is they want in life that's positive and having God's guidance is a must. This movie also inspires me to keep reaching for my goals in life. Look for me in the restaurant toasting with my son and also driving the BMW .  I have a children's book coming out soon March 2013 on Amazon entitled Nasir's Strings, check for it",1360454400,,682,4.151515151515151
5373504,5,B009Z1HHU6,"I just watched the movie! I didn't expect much to be honest, but I definitely got the message! Will be adding to my collection and sharing with others. My fav scene would have to be near the end when the brothers reached to the top of the cherry tree. Getting ""cherries"" at the bottom is easy but what God wants is for me to reach. With HIS help I will get what he has for me at the top! It also hit home for me when the brother was speaking to the pastor on the phone about attending church and the pastor said that God can speak to us anywhere but it's powerful when we don't forsake fellowshiping together.",1360368000,,609,4.126050420168068
5373505,5,B009Z1HHU6,"Under The Cherry Tree is what the movie industry needs.  A movie based on Faith and Forgiveness.  With all that's going on in today's World giving people hope and driving them toward the tendency to look on the more favorable side of events or conditions and to expect the most favorable outcome is very much needed.  The storyline is incredible, I would definitely recommend this movie to friends and family.  I look forward to seeing more great work from Kobalt Books.",1360108800,,470,4.765432098765432
5373506,5,B009Z1HHU6,"This movie is great for introspection. We can all learn that marriage is a partnership and each partner must share what's going on, both good and bad.  If one partner keeps secrets, when all hits the fan, the other partner is left trying to pick up the pieces.  I definitely recommend this inspirational movie.  This is a movie of truth, faith and hope.",1360022400,,353,4.571428571428571
5373507,5,B009Z1HHU6,"""Under the Cherry Tree"" is the modern day story of Job. In it, we have the main character suffering through trials and tribulations as he struggles to maintain his relationships with his wife and his brother. He loses his way and his faith but finds redemption and forgiveness. There really was betrayal, faith, and forgiveness found under the cherry tree. I highly recommend.",1358985600,,376,4.984126984126984
8545469,5,B009Z1HHU6,"I enjoyed this movie because of the strong theme of a Christian couple that sees some really though times but ultimately leans back on their faith and one another. It touches on realistic topics such as job loss and its aftermath, marital issues, alcoholic family members, stress, childhood trama that has carried over into adulthood, sibling issues, etc.",1515283200,,355,5.137931034482759
8545470,1,B009Z1HHU6,"One of the worst movies I've seen. Poor quality, bad acting, and not enough time spent on the storyline. The only thing I liked about it, was that it was faith based. I didn't even finish watching it.",1505174400,,200,4.2894736842105265
8545471,5,B009Z1HHU6,"Beautiful story of courage, strength, struggle,  hope, forgiveness and love . I really enjoy the movie.",1503964800,,103,5.4375
8545472,5,B009Z1HHU6,Gripping story of self examination. Who are you as a person? Is it stuff and things or is it your identity in Christ.,1485216000,,117,4.130434782608695
8545473,4,B009Z1HHU6,good movie different but we liked it,1468713600,,36,4.285714285714286
8545474,5,B009Z1HHU6,"When it comes to urban films, I tend to have difficulty finding inference with the storyline and the characters, which often perpuate stereotypical realities. However, this movie about two brothers whose polarized paths led them to a greater understanding of life and family I perused this universal message. Black cinema needs more films like this to overturn a market of entertainment consumers who are oblivious to positive urban stories.",1418169600,,441,5.405797101449275
8545475,5,B009Z1HHU6,It was a great Christian movie that reminded me of the book of Job. My family and I enjoyed it! Looking forward to more movies from Kobalt!,1407715200,,139,4.185185185185185
8545476,3,B009Z1HHU6,I like the book more because it was a  C movie very bad back ground scerne going on in movie,1394928000,,92,3.6
8545477,4,B009Z1HHU6,I enjoyed the film. I was pleased that it was no over the top in converying the message. Initially for me it started off slow but I suddenly found myself lost and elating to many of the story lines.  I look forward to seeing other films from this team. Great job :),1369699200,,265,4.096153846153846
8545478,5,B009Z1HHU6,"We rented the Cherry Tree movie last night.
 I was beat and fell asleep early in the first scene of it but my wife sat up and watched it.
She told me this morning that-
"" that movie was was one of the best movies she has ever seen and I have to watch it""
I sat down with her, started the movie and from that point I was glued to the tv.
There were so many points that were touched upon that are so very real and present.
This movie was a great choice.
I highly recommend it.
Thumbs Up!",1362960000,,485,3.801980198019802
