8276733,2,B001AD54LQ,"There are 2 versions of 'Judex'- one made around 1916 and a remake in 1963. This is the remake complete with English subtitles as it's done in French. It's dreary and slow-moving. The 'transfer' is dark and in some spots, so dark that you can't see what's taking place. At one point, 'Judex' enters a dark building at night while wearing dark clothing and the story disappears for a few moments. The subtitles are too bright and almost transparent and are too often shown against a bright background. Good luck trying to follow the dialogue. I had to send it back but the 'refunder' was quite friendly and accomodating. Buy the 1916 version.",1413158400,,641,4.68141592920354
8276734,4,B001AD54LQ,"I hadn't ever heard of Judex before but found a review and decided to give it a try.  This appears set somewhere around the end of WW I so put your expectations in context.  The camera work is poor, and action mundane but I still like it.  You can see some of the beginnings of the ideas that would become The Shadow and Batman although the ideas are not fully developed.  If you're looking for action like the Bourne movies or modern acting and film editing you will be disappointed, but it is an interesting view into the development of those ideas.",1402099200,,551,4.372549019607843
8276735,5,B001AD54LQ,"Really enjoyed this sound version of the silent serial classic. Nice quality, and decent subtitles. A great addition to a collection.",1378684800,,133,5.380952380952381
8276736,4,B001AD54LQ,"Gotta love a film with magician Channing Pollack. This is a rare treat. Being released from Sinister Cinema it means the release is a DVD-R format, not a true DVD, but don't let that take away from your pleasure in what is a really great movie.",1222992000,5,244,4.326086956521739
8276737,2,B001AD54LQ,"Sadly, this isn't a very good transfer of this film. Judex is a great film though. I suggest checking out the new version that Eureka released. All the same, it's great that Sinister put out this DVD release so that we can see Franju's work today.",1221523200,10,247,4.391304347826087
8276738,5,B001AD54LQ,I last saw this film at the Los Angeles Cinematheque about ten years ago.  I searched online off and on for several years wondering when this film would be released to DVD.  There are few films that so captured my imagination and interest that after all these years I would so welcome its return.  As I have not seen the quality or care taken with this DVD release of Judex I cannot comment but I am hoping it has been given the justice it deserves.,1219795200,3,449,4.258823529411765
