8016736,5,B0001VHRWW,"This is where all the work you've done with Volumes one and two really starts to pay off.  This set is more challenging to learn, but the energy imparted is much more dramatic and consistent.  You'll need plenty of leg, hip and knee strength to follow through with these exercises.  Take it slow and go back to the earlier volumes if you need a break.  Worth the extra effort!  As always, a quality product from Terry Dunn/Zen Bear.",1410134400,6,432,4.487179487179487
8016737,5,B0001VHRWW,"This is a Great Qi Gong set...But if Terry rates this as Intermediate, then I not working hard enough. I found it quite strenuous, so would rate it higher... more like advanced. The video gives very clear instruction as it's a ""Work along with me"" style. Great for lower body strength. Very Good Video. Another good addition to my working library. Thanks Terry.",1380326400,6,361,4.746031746031746
8016738,5,B0001VHRWW,"This DVD has two exercises that are longer and more complex than exercises 1-5 standing meditations found on the first DVD. It is helpful to be grounded in the first 2 DVDs before working on this one, because it is definitely more challenging, and you need the strength imparted to your base (legs and torso) by consistent daily practice of DVD 1.

Again, the exercises impart energy, calm, clarity of mind and strength which are hard to explain. You do not have to believe anything. It is not about faith, but an ancient science.  It is reproducible. Just follow the recipe.

This set of exercises works the ""core"":  torso, back and legs in a rotating fashion that cannot be had in any other way. It is fascinating how such a slow set of exercises could have such an impact on overall health and well being. Be very mindful of your leg placement and control so that you do not twist your knees.",1305072000,14,895,4.506172839506172
