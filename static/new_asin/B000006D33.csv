7904125,4,B000006D33,"Stunning black and white photography, a very intriguing story-line, subtle, underplayed acting, and a spare, yet gorgeous soundtrack (Claus Bantzer) make this film memorable. However, on the New Yorker VHS-release edition (the only format in which this film is available) the subtitles are in white, so they're often unreadable (remember: this is a black & white film) . In addition, any of the non-German (i.e. Urdu [?] & Chinese) dialog is not translated. Therefore, the total experience, while good, is somewhat challenging. A better, more complete print would be ideal. Regardless, I would like to see more of this director's (Jan Schtte's) work.",1437350400,,650,5.320388349514563
