8525385,2,B0085A9JKE,"Very few decent flicks about wrestling and I had  high hopes, but it is pretty much a dismal potboiler.  Joel Mcrea still comes thru as he always does as a cockey athlete (Football player) who thinks he can make good on sheer luck and will power much to his chagrin-he plummets down and becomes a (gasp) pro-wrestler-oh the shame.  Some nice looks at Football and wrestling and how it was presented in the 30's and pre-Hays Office,too, so it does have some risque (for its' time moments),but still could have been so much more with a better script.  Joel Mcrea fans will like it just to see their  hero in a different type of role.",1375401600,3,631,4.452173913043478
