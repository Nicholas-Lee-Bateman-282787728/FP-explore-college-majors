But it was wonderful to renew memories of the movie, s thanks a lot. Love it.",1360627200,,158,3.96875
516666,5,6302802660,"and Olympia Dukakis.  But this is one of my favorite movies.  It is very moving to see her come into her own and I could totally relate.  It is romantic, emotional, heart-wrenching, heart-warming and very funny in places.",1359331200,3,221,4.7631578947368425
516667,5,6302802660,"I absolutely loved this movie. She is about my age and I wish I had her vim, vigor ,confidance and perhaps a wee touch of insanity to do something like she does.",1359244800,,161,4.0625
516668,4,6302802660,Content was good and so was the acting. The story explored aging and the one who is considered aging the one to determine their fate.  Video quality was excellent.,1350864000,,163,4.620689655172414
516669,5,6302802660,"This is one of the movies I watch again and again, because of the messages of reinventing oneself at any age and of the necessity of restoring or forgiving relationships between parent and child.  It is fun, funny, joyful and inspiring on so many levels!",1346630400,,254,4.644444444444445
516670,1,6302802660,"Over The Hill - didn't get to watch it, it pulled when placed in the VCR, don't know if it was the VCR or the tape!  Bad deal, all the way around!  Don't know if I can return the product or not.",1269907200,,194,3.5952380952380953
516671,4,6302802660,"Olympia Dukakis is a woman recently widowed and then all of a sudden her 60th birthday hits her.  Her son wants her to move into his basement in Maine, but she decides to go see her daughter in Australia instead.  Her daughter is very angry and neglectful toward Mom for reasons we don't find out until the very end.

Mom decides to buy a muscle car and take a road trip where she meets several interesting characters, including exciting swindlers, thugs, a lonely old man, an Aborigine tribe and a strange gypsy-type guy named Dutch played by Derek Fowlds.  She eventually falls in love with Dutch, but is still trying to discover herself.  She is torn between romance with Dutch, wanting to make peace with her daughter and this new adventurous side of her.

We get taken through a whole gamut of emotions, mainly with Mom and Dutch and then Mom and Daughter.  It's fun and has some depth, but not as penetrating as Woody Allen films.

I like Derek Fowlds a lot and am a big fan of his, but I didn't like that awful hair piece they made him wear.  Still, I enjoyed the film over all.",1119830400,8,1085,4.4120603015075375
516672,4,6302802660,"""Over The Hill"" is good. I watched it on the Independent Film Channel. What I liked most about the film: 1)The main character. 2)The engaging road story. 3)What HAPPENS in the road story. 4)The action. What I  didn't exactly like about the film: 1)The ending. Way too fast of an  ending. 2)The main character's downward slope into depression and anger.  It's a George Miller film. It seems as though he can make anything  interesting. Whether it be about driving on mindless roads or cooking fish,  it's all just too entertaining. Rent first.",954028800,4,542,4.8478260869565215
7831862,5,6302802660,"I don't think this is a glove that will fit all, but those who get it, really get it. I have that daughter, but worse. We we're so close and I guess it's true what they say about mothers and their daughters. This is not a glamorous, over the top film, but it is realistic..for the most part. And Olympia Dukakis was so beautiful naturally. I'm less afraid of 60 than I was...which I should add, this was what 60 looked like at the time. Not the mangled, faux "" ladies "" of today. Sadly, that may turn you off of a film that is so worth seeing.
I agree there were some unrealistic parts and the ending a tad anticlimactic, but still honest and fun. Olympia could carry any movie, but she is not her character in Steel Magnolias. If that's what you are looking for, rent that..again. This shows her true range and it is beautiful.",1438300800,,828,4.246835443037975

7831864,2,6302802660,"There is no magic in this film. Olympia is a bit disappointing is her roll. I don't think that the film is very well written. I watched this film because of her performance in ""Steel Magnolias"" and was disappointed.",1429833600,,215,4.538461538461538
7831865,3,6302802660,"I love Olympia Dukakis, but the story left much to be desired.",1426032000,,62,4.25
7831866,5,6302802660,"Olympia is fabulous in this part.  The complex relationships make quite a story line.  In the end, much gets resolved.  Visually a treat, tender emotionally, delivers a big message for all.  Don't be afraid to walk your talk!!",1415145600,,226,4.868421052631579
7831867,4,6302802660,perfect movie for anyone approaching retirement with kids who think you're already senile,1407369600,,89,5.923076923076923
7831868,5,6302802660,This movie was very hard to find.  I love it and the way mother and daughter finally understand each other.,1405987200,,107,4.35
7831869,3,6302802660,"The movie wasn't great, but I love the 2 actresses and would watch them in anything!  The teenage daughter is a real addition.",1398124800,,126,4.478260869565218
7831870,5,6302802660,"This is one of my husband's favorite movies and now is also one of mine.  Olympia does a fantastic job portraying a widow who was manipulated and controlled by her husband.  At age 60, her son decided to take over his father's place by selling her home and moving her into the basement apartment he has made for her in his house.  In the movie Olympia's character regains control of her life.  The process includes resolving differences between the mother and daughter as well as demonstrating to the son he will not be in control of his mother's life.  The movie is full of emotion from laughter to excitement, from heartache to love.  We would recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a movie that gives hope and demonstrates the strength that lies within each of us.",1389052800,,778,4.561151079136691
7831871,5,6302802660,"This is a wonderful film, exquisitely shot, with a rare sense of older people's sexuality, dynamism and beauty, a view of the Australian outback that makes one want to get on a plane and hit the road, a theme concerning arrogant adult children as they reverse the tables on their parents (n this case their recently widowed mother), and the ways parents might fight the insult of aging (mostly from their own children). This is also another spectacular performance by Olympia Dukakis, who is so sprightly and youthful without the deforming plastic surgery that has turned Meg Ryan into The Joker and Madonna into Pillow Face: One can only applaud the director and champion this movie based on an actual story of one woman's journey to reclaim her life.",1382140800,5,752,4.837209302325581
