8425808,5,B004DOTKCI,A DVD that all should see at a young age (teenager).  What these people do is something the whole world should be aware of so that all can see the damage being done to the planet and that there is so few people doing something about it.,1382400000,,236,4.0212765957446805

8425810,4,B004DOTKCI,"What you see At The Edge Of The World will not happen any more as far as protecting the whales is concerned since these days the Japanese Navy accompanies the whale killing vessels in Antarctica so Japan can kill thousands of whales in the name of research without fear of being stopped by the environmentalists. Shame is truly understatement of the century after watching Japanese in action. When I watched another documentary, The Cove, the disturbing part was how could a group of people in this case Japanese, slaughter few hundred dolphins at a time and no one in their country would be outraged by their actions... Watch another documentary called ""A Fall From Freedom"" which covers the main story as well. Bravo.",1348531200,,719,4.853658536585366

8425812,5,B004DOTKCI,"I am sure most readers will be on the side of the whales and as this most valuable film makes clear it is an unequal contest with the Sea Shepherd being just about the only mob willing to do much about it. Despite the cheery atmosphere portrayed by the youthful crew of volunteers, (in part very much for the camera I suspect), make no mistake, their task is difficult, very difficult and extremely dangerous and they must know it! One scene deals with a zodiac lost in the open sea for 8 hours. Such a situation is nothing to laugh about. These inflatable craft are quite unsuited to the open southern ocean and can founder in an instant in the huge swells and storms that can arise in minutes. Survival under such circumstances is almost hopeless. Few if any viewers will have crossed these vast and stormy seas or flown by helicopter over such icy waters where again a ditching means certain death. I have had the good fortune to do both. These ships are grossly under-equipped, under-funded and under-resourced. Just look at their equipment, their food, their clothing and consider the enormous limitations imposed by fuel, radar and any meaningful search and rescue operation. Do not rent this disc, BUY IT, (it is worth every penny), and support these courageous defenders of the whales. For those lucky enough to meet and be greeted by a pod of whales in these waters there can be few more thrilling and meaningful experiences. Let it ever be so. The Japanese must be persuaded to stop.",1319846400,3,1493,4.680608365019012
8425813,5,B004DOTKCI,"Code stumbled on Whale Wars TV show and is a huge fan of the Sea Shepard crews.

We heard about the this documentary that inspired the tv show and just had to get it for him.

Anyone know of someone selling toy boats that look like Sea Shepard ships or whale fleet?  We would love to surprise him with that too.",1310515200,,311,4.065573770491803
8425814,5,B004DOTKCI,"Dan Stone's film, ""At the Edge of the World"", is a sincerely inspiring documentary of a heroic journey set forth by the under-supported, under-funded Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. The organization's volunteer crew members, from all types of backgrounds and professions, risk their lives in hopes of protecting the illegally hunted whales that are located in the vast Antarctic ocean territory.

The film captures modern-day true-life heroes engaging together in their efforts to stave off the Japanese hunting vessels that are under the guise of 'research' in order to illegally slaughter whales for profit. A strong sense of purpose and group-member support among all those involved comes across clearly on screen.

Following the courageous, passionate, and determined crew members, are the just as brave, bold, and courageous cameramen who capture the heroic actions on film - some moments of which are hair raising! Also as captivating, and nothing less than breathtaking, is the cinematography of the vast Antarctic landscape, its majestic icebergs, crystal blue waters, and its beautiful wildlife.

Enhancing the film's emotive quality is the music selection. The soundtrack creates the perfect atmosphere for each scene in which the music is placed. Nothing is over or under done.

""At the Edge of the World"" is a film that yearns to be seen on a big screen due to the expansive landscape, action scenes, and cinematography; the bigger the screen, the better. The DVD is one to have on hand when in need of inspiration. Nothing is more motivating than watching people come together for a cause that is dear to them - and this film puts the viewer right in the middle of it all.",1296604800,8,1688,5.127272727272727
8425815,5,B004DOTKCI,"'at the edge' is a documentary that sticks with you long afterwards but is also just good entertainment.

the film follows captain watson's team on their seemingly impossible mission of locating japanese vessels harvesting whale meat for consumption under the guise of 'research.' that this brazen breach of international law (and ethics or morals or whatever you would call it) continues with opposition only from a small and poorly funded group of activists is a worthy enough story to tell. thats not the only reason to see the film though.

see the film if you have ever been to a restaurant and ordered fish without having any idea if it is sustainable or not (the answer is often surprisingly difficult to find out). see the film if you've ever heard the clash's song about the supermarket and have thought about it literally. see the film if you have a pet and are a meat-eater and ever wondered where to draw the line. finally, see the film even if you don't care about any of that but just want to be taken on a real life-threatening adventure and feel it from the deck of the ship like only a handful of people have.

the documentary itself is just fun to watch: that cover shot is an amazing scene to watch in real-time and paul watson comes off almost as a merry clown. 'at the edge' is a tribute to human ingenuity at its worst (unethical behavior) and best (the resistance to that behavior) and is thoroughly enjoyable to watch.",1295740800,4,1442,4.5813953488372094
8425816,5,B004DOTKCI,"If you ever wondered if just for a minute what it would be like to put your personal life aside for something bigger, this is it.  The backdrop of the Arctic is so stunningly beautiful it's hard to imagine something so heinousness such as the illegal harvesting of whales in the name of science is taking place.  You don't have to be an activist to understand the sheer magnitude of what is going on and what a humble group of volunteers outnumber and outspent is trying to do about it.  Dan Stone and his crew of talented not to mention brave cinematographers shed light on a critically important topic in an incredibly thoughtful way and without being overly gruesome.  You don't have to see blood in the water to understand why the mission is so critical and what a few brave souls are attempting to do about it.  See At the Edge of the World, it will forever change the way you think about Whales, the arctic and what it means to be an activist!",1295222400,,949,4.4
8425817,5,B004DOTKCI,"This movie goes where few have gone before. Literally, into the void of the Antarctic Ocean. Specifically, the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary. Documentaries usually are these seemingly long accounts with celebrity voice over narratives that explain what is occurring as you passively watch. The Edge of the World is none of that. This film documents through action and adventure, the struggle between the Lilliputian Navy of the Sea Shepherd Organization and the whaling vessels of the nation of Japan (Harpooning upwards of 1000 whales in the sanctuary each year, ostensibly for research). A David and Goliath epic of biblical proportion. This film places you right on the ship alongside a crew of volunteers from all walks of life, for this mission. The rag tag Sea Shepherd fleet of two rust-bucket ships with aging engines and electronics, a few inflatable Zodiac, dingy size boats with outboard motors, and a gnat sized helicopter sets out to search the vastness of the millions of square miles of frigid ocean in the hopes of finding the Japanese whaling fleet. Needless to say, you are taken along for the ocean ride of your life. This is not your reality TV show where you are the spectator to a contrived plot or where you are shamelessly emotionally manipulated at key sections in the film. What the crew feels, you feel, because the directors and editors brilliantly weave you into the situations shipboard. You are elated that you are finally off on this mission to disrupt the slaughter of whales in this pristine sanctuary. You feel the biting below zero cold as you chip off the ice covering everything after a devastating storm. By the way, you definitely experience the rolling and pitching and seasickness right along with the crew during the storm. You are anxious, not being able to find the Japanese main processing ship. They have superior technology to evade your efforts. Yet, finally you make contact and pursue. The chase is on, cat and mouse, and ironically, you are the cat. However the Japanese captain is cunning. I suggest you see the movie to appreciate the ending.

If you think you are going to be stuck below decks on this voyage, think again. The stunning beauty of this wilderness is breathtaking. The film has one two awards for cinematography. There are so many harrowing life threatening events on this adventure it is hard to single out only a few. The crew seems to think these are a matter of course. Not!!!. For instance, there is a scene with this little soup can of a helicopter flitting about looking for the Japanese fleet when the pilot radios in that he has to land because he has fumes in the gas tank ""so slow down the ship, I can only land this once"". No aircraft carrier, no jet hooks, just a bobbing moving ship and a garage door size platform to land on. Nerves of steel as far as I am concerned. A second scene that stops your heart is when one of the zodiacs on a mission to slow down the Japanese ship they were pursuing goes missing. The two volunteers on this little tub toy are in the middle of an unknown nowhere. This inflatable isn't even a blip on the screen. The weather turns bad and the visibility ends at the tip of your nose. A stomach turning 8 hour search ends on a fortunate note. Perhaps I would have volunteered for something like this in my younger days. But after watching their reality, I am very comfortable viewing the movie in a theatre than being there, knowing that in that hostile environment one misstep and your life is over.

The Edge of the World is currently (at the writing of this review) doing the film festival circuit. It has won numerous awards, both here in the United States and abroad. In my opinion, documentary films need less third person narrative and more of the ""bring me along with you"" that you get when you watch this movie. When you get to see this film on the big screen, (I have not read anything about a general release date yet), you will need to stay right through the credits. True to form, you are pleasantly surprised at how the filmmaker continues to add depth to who the crew are, and where they call home. (I think it is called back-story in movie jargon). Speaking of back-story, there is also a back-story as to how the film has matured since its first festival in Toronto.

The producer, Dan Stone, has continued, based on audience reaction and his own personal conviction, to hone and improve The Edge of the World throughout the usual festival circuit. Most producers, I assume, don't continue to better the entertainment value and message, once the film is, as they say, in the can. As luck would have it, last year, I was fortunate to see the film that was presented in the Toronto festival and recently, the final version that was shown at the Los Angeles festival. This film has undergone its own metamorphosis, and is the better in both entertaining us as an audience and in bringing the message of individual empowerment to face seeming insurmountable odds. The Edge of the World makes the journey worthwhile on both accounts",1294876800,3,5056,4.678651685393258
