7920174,5,B00004CIGW,"This movie is off the chain! It shows a lot of action! Especially Linda Blair who played on the Exorcist is in this movie! They have got some fine naked girls in this film! I'm talking about on point! And they also have Tamara Dobson who playe on cleopatra Jones! If they have chained Heat 2 on dvd, then they should have release the first chained heat on dvd as well! This movie is out of sight! It's all good! They need to recongnize a good film when they see one! Also they need to do a remake of the movie ""Chained Heat"" with different actors in the future and see witch one is better! Please get this on dvd ASAP! Thanks Amazon!

7920177,2,B00004CIGW,"Chained Heat (Lutz Schaarwachter, 1983)

If you're looking for women's prison exploitation movies, you've come to the right place. Lutz Schaarwachter's masterpiece (directed under the name Paul Nicolas) is the gold standard of women in prison exploitation flicks, boasting a solid B-movie cast, sets that don't look like cardboard, a sound effects editor who could actually handle a tape deck, and, shall we say, enthusiastic direction. Don't get me wrong, the movie still blows goat, but it does so in the most entertaining of ways.

Carol Henderson (The Exorcist's Linda Blair, obviously in desperate need of cash) accidentally killed a man in a car accident, and has been sentenced to eighteen months in a women's prison. She immediately hooks up with hooker Val (Hard to Hold beauty Sharon Hughes) and kleptomaniac airhead Bubbles (Under the Rainbow's Louisa Moritz), and they run afoul of the local tough girls, headed up by Erica (Sybil Danning, who needs no introduction). The toughs are also opposed, through prison's natural racial divide, to Duchess (Tamara Dobson, best known for playing Cleopatra Jones in that film series), and everyone's against the guards, headed up by hairspray-helmeted Captain Taylor (Stella Stevens, who was no spring chicken here, and as of this writing is still going strong) and Warden Bachmann (the late John Vernon, whose last major film release was Sororoity Boys in 2002). There's all the corruption, fighting, nudity, and bad acting you could hope for (unless you're a rabid Linda Blair fan, in which case you probably want more nudity). There's nothing else to recommend the movie, but let's face it: if you're renting women-in-prison exploitation flicks made two decades ago, you're not looking for great literature, you're looking for Linda Blair's girly parts. (Though there are a few people who claim they watched it ""just for the articles,"" I have to say, I don't believe them.)

This is a cheesefest, but at least it's a mild Jarlsberg instead of Kraft Processed Imitiation Cheese Food slices. **",1142208000,14,2047,5.1782477341389725
7920178,2,B00004CIGW,"Not what I expected it to be on DVD--several scenes were edited out, such as the prison guard rape scene and also the best scene in which one of the ""baddies"" gets impaled in the neck with a grappling hook in a bathroom stall. The remainder of the film is intact, language and all, but it's a mystery why the other scenes edited out. Perhaps being a foreign Region 2 disc? Who knows. Your best bet is to avoid this and get the long out of print but unedited VHS version. An item of note on the subject of editing, watch closely on many of the prison cell scenes and you'll see the dialogue microphone dangling down near the top of the screen from time to time--how could that have gone unnoticed from the director on down? I think it's hilarious, but it's just a clue as to the kind of movie you're in for here.",1138492800,18,811,4.205128205128205
