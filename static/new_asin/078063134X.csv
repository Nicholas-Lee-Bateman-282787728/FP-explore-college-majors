36077,5,078063134X,"I guess history does repeat itself as these events from 1927 sound awfully like the Hurricane Katrina of this decade.  The limited use of levees was a key problem here.  The president of the time visited the disaster area.  It happened in the state right next to Louisiana.  One area in particular was hit just as the Ninth Ward was this decade.

Unfortunately, like Katrina victims, many of those suffering and isolated were Black.  However, poverty was not the main ingredient here.  Landowners feared that moving Blacks would mean their labor couldn't be exploited later.  This documentary shows whites being rescued, but Blacks being stranded.  Further, in order to get food and other basic needs, Blacks were forced to care for whites.  When one Black man already performed a shift and went home, a white police officer shot him.  The leader of the disaster effort, though sympathetic to Blacks originally, later said the murder was the fault of Blacks due to their ""laziness and indolence.""

Too many people think that the Emancipation Proclamation solved all for African Americans.  Too few don't realize how rights were stealthily taken away during the Reconstruction.  School segregation wasn't banned until the 1950s; interracial marriage wasn't legal in all states until the late 1960s.  Further, ""free"" doesn't equal ""not oppressed.""  The whites in this documentary were no longer slave OWNERS; but they still paid Blacks close too nothing and went out of their way to ensure that they wouldn't advance.  The white figures here were revealed as imperfect individuals.  The Percys, a father and son, opposed the men in white sheets.  However, later, they did nothing to see Blacks escape the flood as effectively as whites had.  Allies turned into oppressors in a second under the right conditions.

One thing I love is the consequence of this exploitation:  land owners feared that Blacks would leave Mississippi and THEY DID!  I never knew one event played such a big role in the Great Migration.  The interviewees didn't mention just going ""up North,"" but they specifically refer to Chicago.  As I watched this work, I thought of how my grandfather moved from MS to Chicago and how this documentary was showing my specific history.  Perhaps this could be suggested or required viewing in predominantly Black schools in the Chicagoland area.

Off the top of my head, this was the best installation of the American Experience series.",1240790400,6,2445,5.06265664160401
36078,3,078063134X,"This package gives you the American Experience version of the presidencies of Eisenhower, Nixon, and Reagan.  Each covers the most salient parts of their early biographies and then shows how their careers led them into politics and eventually the nation's highest office.  About what you would expect from PBS in terms of placing each in the overall context of American history.  A good place to start and get more information or ideas about each of these presidents, but not definitive by any means.  Hardly one-sided, there's a healthy amount of criticism for each of these Republican presidents.
The Eisenhower one does a good job of showing what Ike was like before he became either a famous general or a politician.  The parts about his wartime exploits are more personal than reflective of the war in Europe of which he was such an integral component.  The approach toward his presidency is a little simplistic and follows the interpretation that Ike led by a ""hidden hand.""
The Nixon part of course focuses heavily on Watergate.  There was more to his presidency, but this is given relatively short shrift.  Basically portrays Nixon's political insecurity and obsession that someone was always out to get him.
The Reagan part actually has separate reviews on Amazon, but it draws heavily on the commentary of Edmund Morris, who would not have been my first choice.  Potential bias of the narration aside, the video of Reagan and interviews with his staffers and colleagues is very good and worth watching.",1066435200,9,1512,4.99203187250996

7789843,4,078063134X,"""The American Experience"" documentaries on the Presidents are, by and large, quite good.  But there is undoubtedly a liberal slant to the presentation of the stories of these men.  How can you tell?  Well, when you have liberal flacks like Sam Donaldson and Chris Matthews offering commentary throughout the documentary on Reagan, you can bet that they're not being interviewed because they are full of praises for the man.  Even the ""man in the street"" commentary in the Reagan documentary was one-sided.  A few clips of disgruntled Americans during the 1982 recession who were claiming that Reagan doesn't get it and is out of touch.  Any clips of any of the supporters who gave him one of the greatest landslide victories only 2 years later?  Of course not.  This same technique popped up in the Eisenhower documentary---lots of critics, few supporters.  Needless to day, Nixon got rougher treatment.  Compare to the ""LBJ"" documentary and while his actions in Vietnam get heavy scrutiny, in the end the most the documentary can conclude is that the man had so much promise and fell short.

They're good documentaries, overall, but a more even-handed approach would've been more suitable.",1400025600,3,1190,5.051282051282051

7789845,5,078063134X,"Even when they actually used to teach history in our schools, a lot of the real history of change in America was overlooked.  The Mississippi Flood of 1927 is a great case in point.  Not only did this most destructive flood in American history kill almost 250 people, cause hundreds of millions of dollars in damages, and cover 27,000 square miles across seven states with up to 30 feet of water, it had far-reaching socioeconomic, political, and racial consequences for the region as well as the nation as a whole.  This is a truly excellent installment of the American Experience series, approaching the story from multiple angles, including a truly personal one that seems to render the flood's repercussions in a telling microcosm all its own.

The focus of the story is the city of Greenville, Mississippi, in many ways the economic hub of the Mississippi Delta region where cotton was still king.  Tragically yet predictably in this land where blacks outnumbered whites, the flood all too quickly came to be defined in largely racial terms.  It's important to note that Greenville was no hotbed of imminent racial conflict; the video describes how the most prominent local planter, LeRoy Percy, spoke out for the humane treatment of sharecroppers and personally convinced the town to repudiate the presence of the Ku Klux Klan during its 1920s heyday.  When push came to shove, though, Percy put greed over honor.  When his son Will, head of the Flood Relief Committee, called for the evacuation of the thousands of blacks stranded on the levees with little more than the shirts on their backs, LeRoy Percy convinced the other committee members to change their mind, betraying his own son in the process.  The local planters were scared that the black laborers they depended on for their wealth would not return if they were evacuated elsewhere.  Surprisingly, the video goes on to show how the rebuked Will Percy seemingly betrayed his own nature to become nothing short of a race-baiter who blamed the black population for the cold-blooded murder of a black worker by a white policeman.  Both of the Percys make for most interesting case studies in Southern racism, and this documentary does a great job of telling their story in the context of the great flood and its pervasive consequences.

The documentary features a number of interviews, some of them quite moving, with both white and black survivors of the 1927 flood.  Even here, though, the race question colors their personal narratives.  Once the flood waters receded - which took a couple of months - Greenville was never the same.  Planters' fears were soon realized as blacks began leaving in droves, most of them migrating north to Chicago.  Within a year, half of the blacks in the Mississippi Delta had left - and the very fabric of the nation had changed in the process.

Somewhat surprisingly, this otherwise excellent program does not mention Herbert Hoover's duplicitous dealings with Robert Moton and the Colored Advisory Committee.  As the man in charge of all flood relief projects, Hoover was made aware of the deplorable conditions of the 1300 or so blacks consigned to the levees at Greenville.  Rather than doing anything to help these unfortunate victims, Hoover somehow convinced prominent African-American leader Robert Moton and the Colored Advisory Committee not to reveal the horrible abuses, promising them all sorts of things, even the parceling out of white planters' land to all the sharecroppers, in the event that he realized his Presidential ambitions.  Hoover was lying, of course, as he proved after moving into the White House in January 1929.  It was this act of betrayal by Herbert Hoover that signaled the beginning of the huge shift of African-American voters from the Republican to the Democratic ticket.",1283904000,4,3810,5.015873015873016
