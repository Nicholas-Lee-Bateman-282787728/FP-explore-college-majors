Gather some family and friend's together and enjoy the show!",1344124800,,342,4.540983606557377
7956890,5,B00005Y8VQ,"I first saw Chuck Berry at Spatz showbar in Hamilton Ohio in 1958. I printed up a fake drivers license so I could pass for 18 (the drinking age then)and took anchor for hours of this troubedor's inimitable blues based stylings. Berry was designed to perform best in this type setting, and I was never, in later years, able to find a club video of the man. Until now-
The Roxy video (which I have transcribed to DVD-R) is as close as you will ever get to that 50's experience. There is no background narrator or song splicing, just the real thing. Oh yea, the audience is hot with libations in hand, the backup band is perfect, the audio recording is clean with great dynamic range. I cannot help from playing this at least once a month. All of my music video collection are live performances, and this is a leader in the pack. Captured in the 70's, this 60 minute performance caught Chuck when he could still boogie. This may not make it to DVD, so you better get the VHS now while you still can.",1081987200,2,996,4.331550802139038
7956891,4,B00005Y8VQ,"o.k., this is not Chuck at his best (as you can see in the ""face au public"" video recorded in Brussels in 1965) but I think it's worth seeing. His guitar playing is enough focused and the band is tight, with a good piano player. After all, with no soundcheck at all, they're rockin' pretty well especially in Let It Rock, Johnny B. Goode and Nadine. After all, you don't have a great choice of video documents to catch Chuck's magic chemistry. After all, this is rock and roll.",1047600000,2,477,4.370786516853933
7956892,1,B00005Y8VQ,"Chuck appears to be too drunk too play. He embarassingly muffs all of his trademark guitar licks, so the back-up guitarist has to fill in. Tina only shows up for the encore, and her gyrations and histrionics are not enough to redeem this sub-par performance. Only worth it if you want to see a generic bar band playing Berry covers with a drunk Chuck staggering around in front of them. I sincerely doubt he approved of this release.
""Hail Hail Rock and Roll"" is the movie to get to see Chuck at his best with top-notch back-up, including Keith Richards. Hopefully it will be remastered and re-issued on DVD soon.",1042761600,2,613,4.581818181818182
