3994422,3,B002VECMHC,"I have enjoyed more commercialized dvds on Sedona. Felt this was not professional. Had to turn the volume up straightaway, I could not understand the narration. At times people were talking all at once? Not worth the price. Save your money and find something else on Sedona. Karma Trekker for instance?",1273104000,,302,4.9411764705882355
3994423,5,B002VECMHC,"I really enjoyed this video because it took a fun and balanced approach to the ""Vortex"" energy mystery without trying to force any one opinion about what it is or how it works. Kelli Treadwell was the perfect guide for the exploration as she clearly has a deep love for the subject matter. I found the interviews most enlightening and also very inspirational- in fact that could be said about the whole video. I finally believe I understand the underlying beliefs and principals concerning the Vortexes. I have hiked and meditated in Sedona many times but now I'm eager to return so I can use my new knowledge to enhance my experience. I highly recommend this video to anyone curious about Sedona or other high energy meditation sites.",1263945600,5,735,4.75
8381974,4,B002VECMHC,"I wouldn't say there's anything particularly exciting about the cinematography but that's not to say that the documentary was in anyway poorly filmed.  For me, it's the content that earns a good review. The film presents a lot of interesting information that really adds to an open mind's perspective.  I watched this prior to a trip I had planned to Sedona and I feel it helped enhance my experience in Sedona.  That said, I would probably watch this whether I had planned a trip to Sedona or not...frankly it's just interesting.",1517184000,,530,4.802197802197802

8381977,5,B002VECMHC,"We recently had an amazing experience visiting some of the vortexes in Sedona, and wanted to know more about them. This video was really helpful in explaining the premise of vortexes, acknowledging why it is easy to be skeptical, and providing the scientific basis for their reality. It's a little ""homemade"" at times and some of the featured experts actively hawk their books, which is kind of annoying. But if you look past these things the video offers a lot of insight. It also gives you some info on how to prepare to visit a vortex, which is incredibly important if you're going to be open to the energy. We are going to watch it again before the rental is up.",1397520000,,666,4.512396694214876
8381978,3,B002VECMHC,"More commentary little boring although did have some interesting aspects of the vortex and energy from certain rocks if you are interested in Sedona, AZ highly recommend the movie Sedona",1391558400,,186,5.233333333333333
8381979,5,B002VECMHC,"Hoped this was available as a softcover, but I can always print it out if I want.
Very good info for anyone wanting to do more in depth exploration of  these sites
and phenomena.",1376006400,,178,4.235294117647059
8381980,1,B002VECMHC,"I thought this was more a travelog on Sedona.  Instead it turned out to be some sort of Zen mystical whatever about the ""vortex energy"" found in Sedona.  Whatever.",1371513600,,163,4.586206896551724
8381981,5,B002VECMHC,It's an excellent documentary of a fascinating place and people. I'm very glad I got it. I've watched it three times already.,1367625600,,125,4.7272727272727275
8381982,5,B002VECMHC,"If you are planning on purchasing a D.V.D. about Sedona this is the one to buy!
My family and I enjoyed the positive and uplifting energy in the film.
The filming brilliantly captures the beauty of the landscapes Sedona is so famously known for. The interviews educate and help you to understand and become more aware of the diverse energy power sources Sedona has to offer. Your vacation will be enhanced if you make this video a part of your whole vacation experience and memory.
I highly recommend it.",1283040000,3,504,4.674157303370786
8381983,5,B002VECMHC,"My Wife and I both loved this beautiful video. We had been to Sedona before but always felt like we were missing something because we didn't understand all the talk about the Vortex Energy. However this time we watched Sedona Vortex Energy Exploration first and had a truly memorable and amazing experience thanks to what we learned. This video is a real work of art and a labor of love! Very scenic and at times poetic. The perfect blend of information and ""on location"" experience. A welcome change from the usual gang of blow-hard academics spouting dubious opinions and pontifications. A special bonus is that the educational and exploration segments were shot at the actual locations being talked about. We will treasure this video and watch it whenever we feel stressed. It will help us tap those ""higher dimensions of consciousness"".",1282348800,5,840,4.964539007092198
