8168391,5,B000MFQ1TC,"This is an amazing documentary.  I used to work as a machinist so I have a lot of respect for the shipbuilders.  They show an obvious pride in their work, and the documentary is to me as much a story about these men and their skills as it is the shipbuilding itself.  I have already watched this DVD twice and the second time was just as interesting as the first.  If you have any doubts about the strength of our military or the pride and craftmanship that goes into our great navy ships, then watching this DVD will erase those doubts.  Most importantly, you get a fascinating view of the inception and actual construction of a destroyer.  Fascinating details are presented from intricate welding to the joining of huge sections of the ship to the comprehensive seal trials.  This DVD is WORTH EVERY PENNY.  Enjoy!  10 stars!",1180310400,2,827,4.571428571428571
