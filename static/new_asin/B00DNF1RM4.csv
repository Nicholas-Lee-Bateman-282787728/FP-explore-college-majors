I've watched this movie over and over (had it taped on my DVR a year ago) and I never get tired of it.  The writing is great.  I also love the actress who plays Andy McCarthy's mom, but couldn't find her name, but she is a great pick for his mom.

5834608,5,B00DNF1RM4,"I love this movie, and was very excited to see it offered on DVD. No complaints about the movie, but it is supposed to come with Closed Captioning, which we need, and it did not. I sent the first one back, and Amazon replaced it with their usual efficiency; however, the second one did not have captioning either. Not sure what the problem is, but I'm very disappointed. So, the movie is great, but the product is not as specified.",1382486400,34,431,4.4

It have a two minute Salsa dance in the middle of the movie that was totally immodest and not for young people or children to watch that did not have to be in the movie. :(

5834610,5,B00DNF1RM4,This movie was superb! The acting was so good that it makes you really believe in the goodness in people. It is uplifting and the ending is sensational. It makes you forget about your troubles and really draws you into the lives of the characters in the film. It teaches the life lesson about not giving up no matter what the odds are. They should make more movies like this in the future. I highly recommend this Family movie to all.,1380067200,52,434,4.37037037037037

This movie brings out all the emotions...sadness, joy, peace, anger,fear, and most importantly love. This movie has a marvelous ending that leaves you with a warm feeling in your heart. The actors almost convince you that they are real people and not playing a role. I love this movie. And for the parents, no foul language to worry about. A true Christmas classic.",1379635200,76,466,4.8375

I am comparing it to another Hallmark movie:  ""Straight From The Heart"", in which McCarthy put in a sterling performance.  While the dancing was very good, the plot and story line was drab and predictable.  Thus, while the dancing held one's attention, it was not enough to raise my rating.

5834682,5,B00DNF1RM4,"This is a great movie and a must see if you love dancing. In watching interviews with Andrew McCarthy, I learned that he wasn't that into dancing before making this movie. Maybe that made the movie better. Both Andrew McCarthy and Michelle Nolden did excellent jobs of acting in this picture. The music was superb and one of the best things about the movie. The only negative at all was that the music wasn't in the credits. I would love to have a CD of the entire song that they danced to. The very best thing about the movie was the dancing scenes. If you have a chance to see this movie, don't miss it. By the way when I ordered the DVD, the price was great as well.",1454889600,3,669,4.1937984496124034

Sometimes, for me,  there are days like that, when you just need a hug.. and this movie filled that need.  I liked this movie so much, loved the music so much, that I hunted down the music and put it on my ipod so I can hear it whenever  I want to..

My husband and I have watched this film more often than we're willing to admit. We always like Andrew McCarthy and we have now been introduced to, and like, Michelle Nolden. Stephanie Mills also plays her role with skill and believability, even though we, the viewers, aren't supposed to really like her character. (I did feel sorry for her, though, at the Christmas party.

5834851,5,B00DNF1RM4,I loved this movie.  Sometimes felt like a rip-off of the Richard Geer movie where he decides to learn to dance but turned out to be a very nice and very entertaining movie with good acting.  Love Andrew McCarthy and the entire cast-especially the actor who plays his mother.  A nice addition to my collection of Christmas Movies.,1420934400,,330,4.655172413793103
5834852,3,B00DNF1RM4,Most Hallmark movies are excellent but this one fell short. I ordered it because I really enjoyed Andrew McCarthy in Straight FromThe Heart.,1420848000,,140,5.130434782608695
5834853,5,B00DNF1RM4,At first Andrew McCarthy has no idea that this BIG deal he is working on is tied to the lady giving him dance lessons. When he does he has to make the decision of whether to help her or help himself. He has fallen in love with this lovely delicate woman so decides that helping her would make HIM the happiest. It is a sweet and tender love story.,1420675200,,347,4.043478260869565
5834854,5,B00DNF1RM4,This is really a heartwarming story. It is one of Andrew McCarthy's best roles. So glad we ordered this.,1420675200,,104,4.526315789473684

5834877,5,B00DNF1RM4,Super movie,1420329600,,11,5.0
5834878,5,B00DNF1RM4,I was Channel surfing and clicked on the Hallmark Channel. At Christmas time I spend a good deal of time watching the Christmas movies on it  Luckily I was in time for the beginning. This is almost a magical love story about a man who wants to learn how to dance in order to impress the daughter of his boss who owns a large corporation. He signs up for lessons and begins to feel something for his dance instructor. She receives a letter telling her she will be evicted and asks for legal advice. This is a movie that has a wonderful ending and will make you feel good.  This after a couple of viewings has become possibly my favorite Christmas movie ever. Its a very tame movie. I have read reviews and some are offended about a couple who Salsa during the movie.  If you can handle Dancing with the Stars you can handle this. I have no reservations about recommending this to anyone,1420156800,9,885,4.351515151515152
5834879,5,B00DNF1RM4,Just as described.  Thank you.  Happy New Year,1419897600,,46,4.625

5834918,3,B00DNF1RM4,"This is a low-key Christmas movie that hits a lot of common themes for a Hallmark Christmas romance movie. It is the story of a woman who owns a dance studio that she is about to be evicted from who gives lessons to a guy who needs to learn how to dance for his engagement party. The guy ends up being related to the girl's business plight and the ending is somewhat predictable. The story is fairly tasteful and watchable if not very fresh. Unfortunately, for me, Andrew McCarthy, who made a number of very popular romantic comedies in the 1980s seems a bit out of place in this movie. This movie is watchable but probably not the best Hallmark Christmas movie I've ever seen. If you like dance-lesson-based romantic movies, you might like this one.",1419033600,4,750,4.522058823529412

5835150,5,B00DNF1RM4,This Hallmark film is one of my favorites. Happy endings are always fun and the director weaves the authors story into the magic of the season.

Still a nice 'feel good' movie to watch during Holiday season.  The idea of watching Action/thriller/ shoot-em up or graphically overblown Sci-fy doesn't fill some people with 'Holiday Cheer'.  I used to like watching that sort of fare, but in the later stages of my life I've learned, and paid attention to WHAT are the important things that one needs to appreciate.  Not some outlandish 'illogical' plot line filled with characters that even I would shoot dead upon meeting....",1389225600,,655,4.972477064220183

Very well done, and would recommend it along with the previous movie I purchased at the same time. The other Christmas title I purchased was ""holiday engagement,"" very very good, loved them both. If I could only choose one though, I would choose the movie ""Holiday Engagement"", the actors are closer in age to myself, and the younger crowd would probably choose it instead, however both of these are terrific!!! I just wanted to say that both of the movies that I reviewed were clean and fun with no potty language or trash that I can recall. I appreciate great romance movies without the added trashy scenes.....why can't they make more movies like this!?

5835204,4,B00DNF1RM4,"As he ages and gets more seasoned Andrew McCarthy sheds more and more of the yuppie smug once associated with his onscreen persona. In COME DANCE WITH ME, Jack Pressman (McCarthy) comes off as a regular guy even if he's a hotshot New York exec in a financial brokerage firm. Jack's a Kansas kid made good. He's got his ducks in a row. He's in a shallow three-month relationship with the boss's high maintainance daughter (Stephanie Mills). He's finalizing a humongous account for the firm. He's in line for a massive promotion. And leaving no stone unturned, he's taking dance lessons to impress his boss during the firm's annual Christmas party. Set in an elegant ballroom, guests are expected to waltz and foxtrot and quickstep and all that classy, old timey stuff. There may even be some Latin dances sprinkled in. The big bash is less than three weeks away, so Jack's got some work to do.

See, what had happened was, one evening he glanced up and saw a sign for Waltzing On Air, a modest dance studio. On impulse he negotiates the stairs and signs up for tutelage from lovely instructor Christine Gates (Michelle Nolden). Christine is the brutally honest sort. Having seen his best foot forward and heard him boast of his tennis prowess, she zings him, ""Did you play tennis with someone strapped to the front of your body?"" What else could Jack do but fall into infatuation with the outspoken dame? And, by the way, it's cute that the establishment below is named ""The Framing Gallery."" It becomes the backdrop to when Christine and Jack have an impromptu box step out in the street one evening.

Michelle Nolden's Christine is distant and businesslike. It's only in her private moments that she demonstrates a winning vulnerability, and I appreciate that Nolden keeps that dialed down, that she doesn't overdo it. Her character is strong and independent, never mind that her studio is barely turning a profit, never mind that she loves it dearly, the studio having been founded by her parents, never mind that Waltzing on Air is on the verge of extinction and Christine is slated for eviction on Christmas eve (how's that for heartless?).

Christine fights back, of course, she's got that gumption. But it's a losing cause. Her neighborhood has been targeted for extensive renovation by a deep pockets real estate development agency. When Christine learns that her new student, Jack Pressman, is a corporate financier, she relies on his advice and support. She's in the dark that Jack's brokerage firm is the one handling the account that's shutting down her studio and that Jack himself is the point man of that deal. And Jack's not about to tell her, smitten as he is at this stage. When Christine calls his office for a formal tte--tte, Jack wimps out and, in perhaps the funniest moment in the movie, assumes a wobbly British accent.

Another highlight for me is Jack's down-to-earth relationship with his mom (Mary Long?). She's kinda awesome. She makes Andrew McCarthy wear an awful goofy Christmas sweater. That scene alone is worth the price of admission.

Obvious similarities to SHALL WE DANCE? abound, although COME DANCE WITH ME separates enough to form its own identity. It's unexpectedly a lovely little romance. It helps that the actors keep it restrained. I love the interplay between McCarthy and Nolden, whether in conversational form or in rhythmic motion. McCarthy exhibits grace on the dance floor, but Nolden's the one who floats and glides like she's poetry on legs. Man, I appreciate great posture on women. Again, note Nolden's blend of strength and fragility, these traits translated as well to dance. And don't be surprised if you pick up helpful ballroom dancing tips, such as you're not supposed to look at your feet, yo. After watching some minutes of Christine and Jack practicing it, I had that box step down pat. That's either because I am tremendously awesome or because Christine is an impeccable instructor. In a season traditionally presided by unabashed sentiment, how do you think this movie ends? Does Jack choose naked ambition and a boost up that corporate ladder or love and the box step?",1387238400,12,4137,4.879089615931721

It was kind of a pleasant break from the average romantic comedy in that it had some real life issues in it... that are sometimes comical and sometimes painful.  I also liked that family mattered to this young man and woman... and that was in start contrast to the empty life (full of riches but no significance) of the girlfriend and her family (his boss).  A good story where some old-fashioned values matter.,1516924800,,536,4.552083333333333
