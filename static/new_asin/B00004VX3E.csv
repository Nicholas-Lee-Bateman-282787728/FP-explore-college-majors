A fantastic video with a lot of information, techniques and procedural know-how.

Anyone, anyone who is truly interested in the profession of Massage and also who is serious about their career should have this video in their special library.

I would enjoy viewing a Second Version when it becomes published.

Again, GREAT!",1186358400,,345,5.471698113207547
7924266,5,B00004VX3E,I have been a professional Massage Therapist for four years and have found this tape to be a wonderfully clear introduction to massage.  The full body massage in this video is demonstrated clearly and easy to follow.  It introduces easily flowing techniques without being too technical... yet remains very informative.  I highly recommend this video.. it's inspirational!,1047427200,7,371,5.473684210526316
7924267,1,B00004VX3E,"Dry? This production is a mouthful of alum. But an instructional video doesn't need to be entertaining, only informative, and this one fails badly.  The instructor is a chiropractor who performs the session in a dress shirt (without rolling up his sleeves), and he is stilted, off-balance and awkward.  His explanations of the strokes are cursory, poorly done also. As a professional therapist, I can tell you this guy is nobody to emulate. I give it one star for the nice photo on the jacket...",1040342400,8,495,4.811764705882353
