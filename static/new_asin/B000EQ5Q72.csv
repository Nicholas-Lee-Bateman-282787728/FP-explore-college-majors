8112757,3,B000EQ5Q72,I agree with another reviewer that the lady narrator interrupts too often to tell us what we can see and hear for ourselves.  The overall content is worth watching but I quickly tired of her voice - especially when you can see that BTK is talking while she is. I'd rather hear what he's saying than just her spin on what he's saying.  I'm still glad I bought this program. It's a good length at 80 minutes and is very interesting.,1232409600,3,430,4.296296296296297
8112758,3,B000EQ5Q72,"It was plenty annoying to have the tape interrupted every five minutes by the airhead reporter to explain to us what the killer had just said, not only that, but they also have a need to go to their own not-too-bright shrink to further explain things, even though a perfectly competent FBI serial killer expert is doing just fine.

The other thing that adds to the irritation is that the reporter feels a need to REMIND us that the killer remains unemotional on tape (except for a single moment), while attempting to explain why he did what he did.

Hey, NBC, we have eyes, we can see that; we can also see the killer choking back sobs (not once, but twice actually); so we do not need to have you tell us these things. Get it?

Why couldn't you have simply left the FBI head doc Robert Mendoza ask the questions, and allowed this two-bit BTK jerk  to explain himself away? What is so complicated about that?

We might have learned something worthwhile--if only you weren't busy salivating and hyping the whole affair up for monetary gain. Do you realize howe pathetic this sort of behavior is? This is exactly why the TV networks come across as such abominable hypocrites.

Maybe one day the tapes will be released in their entirety and we'll be able to get a better picture as to why this sorry character did what he did. What is truly baffling is that there does not appear to be a troubled childhood, no apparent abuse--so says the network dingaling reporter, although I doubt it. Instead of yapping on and on about this guy killing ten people, why not delve into his childhood--and thoroughly? There is (hardly) anything here on it. Why? Are the people at NBC this empty-headed? Most of the mystery to these cold-blooded killer types can be resolved/uncovered by taking a serious look into the childhood.

Having said  that, I must add the following: it is going to shake you up to hear and see the anguish experienced by those who lost loved ones at the hands of a pi**ant named Dennis Rader.",1148774400,14,1998,4.56145251396648
8112759,5,B000EQ5Q72,"He committed his horrendous crimes over a 30 year period in Kansas -- but when police finally caught the ""BTK Killer"" (BTK stands for his killing style: bind, torture, kill), he was an average guy with a wife and kids. After his arrest, NBC News got hold of exclusive videos made of BTK's confessions to a therapist -- and that's where this story really turns scary. The crimes are bad enough, but to hear this guy talk about them so non-chalantly (like he's describing a TV show he saw the night before) gives you real chills.  He comes across as the average neighbor next door, mowing his lawn and chatting about the news. There have been several movies and documentaries about serial killers over the years -- but none reveal how the mind of a killer works the way this full-length documentary does. It is jaw-dropping at points -- in the end, you are truly happy this guy is behind bars.",1141689600,6,891,4.53416149068323
