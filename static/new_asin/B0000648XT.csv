1705705,5,B0000648XT,"Three Dot Night fans of all levels will NOT be disappointed in this DVD.  The long time classics have some new twists and have been embellished with the symphony.  I didn't realize you could take perfection and make it better, but Three Dog Night did.  If you haven't been a fan of Three Dog Night in the past, you will be once you hear and see this new DVD.  It's a MUST to have!!!",1023494400,,382,4.121621621621622
1705706,3,B0000648XT,"These guys have still got it. The voices are just like they were 25 years ago. A fantastic performance.
Now for the bad bits:- This DVD just did not flow due to an over creative producer.
Throughout the concert there are several interview footage between songs and this made viewing very ""Stop Start"".
I believe the interviews that I must say were interesting should have been placed on the DVD as an extra all together. I also found the 70's footage mixed in with the LIVE concert on Shambala to be distracting. Throughout the concert and the interviews the producer over cooked things by including split screen views which at the end of the day was just another big distraction and didn't add any value or enhance the scenes.
This producer should step back and learn the golden rule that ""sometimes less is more"".
Please note that my criticism is pointed at the production and not at the talents or skills of the musicians who were brilliant.
If you are a Three Dog Night fan, buy this DVD. These guys sound great. Hopefully sometime soon they might bring out another concert DVD with a different production team.
I bought this DVD to see and hear the talents of Three Dog Night, I didn't buy it to see the over creative skills of a very enthusiastic producer who wanted his special effects to be the main attraction and Three Dog Nights performance to be secondery.",1022803200,14,1368,4.610655737704918
1705707,5,B0000648XT,"First of all I would like to point out that this isn't an ez-listening ""put you to sleep"" type concert. I was very surprised of how high the energy level is on this performance. Cory Wells and especially Danny Hutton's voices have held up extremely well over the years. Guitarist Michael Allsup and keyboardist Jimmy Greenspoon haven't lost a thing either. LIAR and ELI's COMING and MAMA TOLD ME (NOT TO COME) simply rock. The orchestra blends in with the band much better than I had expected, as shown on ONE and BLACK AND WHITE. OUT IN THE COUNTRY and EASY TO BE HARD are particularly gorgeous. Of course it would have been great to have Chuck Negron along, this lineup easily stands on it's own. This concert is essential for all TDN fans.",1022630400,2,742,4.544776119402985
1705708,5,B0000648XT,"This is a terrific performance by a great band. The interviews and commentaries from the conductor and the members of TDN, gave me a sense of intimacy with the band members, their music and their hopes for this project.  As Cory Wells said, the orchestral styles blending with the band's music actually enhances the sound and reveals its beauty. There were two visual features that I really enjoyed. First, the images of the past were blended with the current performance, that gave me a sense of historicity and enabled me to remember the excitement that this band generated at the height of its popularity. Second, the split screen images gave me the sense of presence in ""being there"" to enjoy this concert. Nature lovers and environmentalists will enjoy the hit, ""Out In The Country"" as it is performed with majestic scenes of the great outdoors. TDN was known for recording songs from, at the time, obscure songwriters and this performance includes the song ""Sault Ste. Marie"" which continues the tradition. This band was having fun. Mike Allsup, the lead guitarist, displayed the vigor and intensity that he's always had, Danny Hutton is in full stride, and Cory Wells, always the ham, shows on the hit, ""Mama, Told Me (Not To Come), the spunk that made this band so entertaining.  The only thing that I would have liked to have happened is Chuck Negron, one of the original lead singers, to have been reconciled and brought in for this project. But, that's show biz! Of course, age takes its toll, and the vocals are not as strong as they used to be, but this band rocked and still gave a dynamite performance. The orchestral arrangements blending with the harmonic sound of the Dog has been performed to perfection. If you are a TDN fan, like I am, you will thoroughly enjoy this DVD.",1022544000,4,1792,4.740384615384615
1705709,5,B0000648XT,"This is a group you don't see to often.  Last time I saw them was in a shopping mall playing in the center court in about 1990.  That was an excellent show.  This video is also excellent in sound quality and contains all their big hits.  The orchestra backup is an added delight but don't worry, it doesn't overpower the bands sound, just compliments it.  Sounds excellent in the 5.1 format.  It is definitely worth a look and listen.",1022198400,,434,4.430379746835443
1705710,3,B0000648XT,"Fans of this talented yet troubled threesome will be satisfied if not thrilled by this video. Chuck Negron emerges as the star of this production with his vocal range and obvious talent. Danny Hutton appears out of it  (probaby why he was dropped later that year). Cory Wells gives a  half-hearted effort, and the band really misses original drummer and  bassist. overall, a decent effort by a talented band nearing the end of a  great career.",934502400,10,443,4.7894736842105265

1705770,3,B0000648XT,"THREE DOG NIGHT-LIVE WITH THE TENNESSEE SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (DVD): Even the Tennessee Symphony Orchestra can't mask what's missin' from this program...namely, one of Three Dog Night's trademark trio of lead vocalists, the estranged but powerful Chuck Negron. Of the two belters left, ultra-righteous gospel wailer Cory Wells handles the lion's share of classics here, excelling on his own 3DN masterpieces, and coming ""somewhere in the right neighborhood"" on several Negron-associated gems. Wells injects a lethal dose of blue-eyed soul power into Randy Newman's MAMA TOLD ME NOT TO COME, Hoyt Axton's NEVER BEEN TO SPAIN, and the fun-infested singalong SHAMBALA, leaving Danny Hutton, who only sang lead on two of the group's original twenty hits, to mostly play backup vocalist. Both Cory and Danny sing a verse of inevitable encore JOY TO THE WORLD, but neither can harness Chuck's original gritty passion. 3DN still boasts a couple of original band members, notably guitarist Michael Allsup, the legendary harmonies are more or less intact, and there's not a (you should pardon the expression) ""dog"" in their set list. However, a reunion with Negron would truly be a reason to CELEBRATE.

1705771,5,B0000648XT,This is by far one of the best music DVDs in my collection.  Some of the 70's bands don't cut it anymore but 3DN are stronger than ever.  I love this one and will play it many times for friends and family to enjoy.,1289260800,,214,3.840909090909091
1705772,1,B0000648XT,"Chuck Negron was the voice most people would remember as the voice of the TDN hits, and he isn't here. He sang "" Joy To The World "", "" Eli's Coming "", "" One "", Easy To Be Hard "" and many of the other songs people remember them for. Neither Cory Wells nor Danny Hutton have his ballsy tenor and it shows, if you love the original songs. Hopefully, the original band will appear on a DVD, as they were, filmed back in the day. The chances that the original trio will ever appear together are pretty much non-existent. I call this band ""One Third Dog Night "" because Negron did most of the vocal heavy lifting; far more than his 1/3 share, and these guys were basically his backup singers. This is a weak brew for those of us who remember TDN as they were.",1287273600,,753,4.129251700680272

1705774,4,B0000648XT,"This is a good concert, it's nice to see and hear the band. When I think of THREE Dog Night, I think of all three singers. Since there are only two on this, it probably should be called TWO Dog Night. They sound good and I am sure that the harmonies are not suffuring. After this many years we're probably lucky that it is not ""ONE Dog Night. The years, and money, have been kind to the guys they look good and sound fresh. The songs are there except for the Lennon/McCartney written ""It's For You"", that was one that had to have the three lead voices, they could cover it now but it probably wouldn't look the same. It is hard for me to point out negatives because to hear and see this music in any form is so great, and I am  so thankful to be able to see it.",1250640000,,761,4.006578947368421

I've read thru the reviews here & heard the good & bad, well Chuck's gone, Floyd's doing his own thing, & Joes' dead, so get over it. I'm lookin forward to seein them again on Oct. 3rd here is Texas again & I know it'll be great again.

3. Liar
4. Eli's Coming
5. One
6. Brickyard Blues

1705799,5,B0000648XT,"I actually bought this DVD a few years ago. I just watched it again for about the 5th or 6th time on my new, big screen TV, with a top notch sound system. Let me break this review into sections:

1)  Overall DVD Quality - The visuals, picture quality, audio, interviews, direction, camera work, editing and general pace of the DVD are all excellent.  I have over 30 live music DVDs and this is by far one of the best all around. It does not take too long to get started; interviews and band comments are concise, interesting and paced nicely throughout the concert footage. The stage lighting, background and bit of video projection used are also nice and not over done.

2)  Camera Work and Video Editing - are extremely important (to me anyway). It was well-done. It is not like some long, discordant conglomeration of 20 second, rushed video clips, one after the other. The flow, ""close-up to stage-wide"" shots and angles are well thought out and camera movment is smooth and at an even pace. The camera operators knew what they were doing and also who was singing and playing and when too. No wasted shots of some person or close-ups of hands doing nothing or monster faces, flashing by at break-neck speeds. The overall focus is on the band but you also get nice views of the orchestra as well.

3)  Performance was great!!! - I read some of these reviews which knocked off stars because Chuck Negron was missing from the line up. While that may be the nostalgic view, it is not a practical one or based in reality, in my opinion. I have seen the newer Three Dog Night and also Chuck Negron live as a solo act several times of late and Chuck's voice has not held up as well compared to the other 2 original vocalists (they both still have fabulous voices). And the Bass player, who now sings all the higher and falsetto parts, has an outright excellent voice in his own right. The fact is, as much as I would also like to see the 3 of them perform all together again; I think it would be a disappointment for most fans vocally compared to the current 3DN line up.

4)  Concept, Orchestra and Song Selection are all good - The live band and orchestra really worked incredibly well together. There were only 1 or 2 songs I had wished were also on the DVD. That's a pretty good ratio compared to most. In fact, I will go out on a limb here and even say, (while it's true the band does all the old hits), I think this is the best combination Rock-Band and Orchestra performance I have seen and/or heard since Nights in White Satin.

So how good is this performance and DVD overall? Everyone that has watched it has no less than thoroughly enjoyed it to loved it. That's a good space to be in.",1238716800,3,2693,4.37875751503006
1705800,3,B0000648XT,"Three Dog Night Live with the Tennessee Symphony Orchestra is an eighty minute walk down memory lane for many fans of classic rock. All of the hits are on display but sadly some of the punch is gone.

A large part of the problem is that the disc was over produced. There are strange shot compositions and interview footage spliced into the show. The split screen images are there to be cool and wind up detracting from the show. Many have said that this is not the same band without Chuck Negron. This may be so but you have to take what you can get. The disc is a good introduction for new fans or the casual listener but it won't work for the purist.

The disc includes a silent photo montage as its only extra.

bad dog -  my pet peeve is those interviews in between songs.  I get concert DVD's to watch the concert, not chit chat.  Conversation before the song that is IN the concert is part of the concert, not the offstage interviews.

They have adapted to cover Negron's parts and added a singer/bass player that hits notes as high or higher than they ever did.  They have kept the original guitar and keyboard player in the group.  Although these two aren't using the same equipment they used way back then (Leslie 925 on guitar and dominant B-3 Hammond)they still retain enough of their original sound to make it semi-original.

Let's talk about moving on in life.  Ok, one new song, otherwise they are still living off of 30 years ago.  Pathetic.  They should be talented enough (even withut Negron) to come up with some new material.  Negron has, why can't they?  My advice, skip this piece of junk and get Negron Cd's and his Live DVD.  Much better quality, better vocals, and some NEW songs instead of the same old 30 year old stuff.

Many of their classics, like Easy To Be Hard, One, and Old Fashion Love Song, bring back memories of the good old days. Baby boomers grew up in the 60s and 70s will enjoy this DVD. Afterall, Three Dog Night was one of the most influencial groups during that era. Hope there will be a DVD coming out with all three original members performing.",1151625600,4,543,4.494949494949495

These guys remind me of the Eagles....they gotten  so much more polished and professional with age, and their voices can still soar. If you've ever loved their music, by all means, get this DVD and you will fall in love with them all over again. And don't forget to bring the Kleenex when you watch this, because it will touch your heart over and over.",1144713600,6,448,4.333333333333333
1705870,5,B0000648XT,"Before I say anything, I'd like to respectfully correct Andru Reeve who, in his review, mentioned some of the TDN hits that Chuck Negron sang lead on.  It should be noted that Cory Wells sang lead on ""Mama Told Me Not To Come"" and not Chuck.  As for this DVD, ""Live with the Tennessee Orchestra"", I love it.  I just saw TDN last night, 10-28-05, at the House Of Blues in Anaheim, California, and they rocked.  Of course, they rocked the last 13 times I've seen them, and 2 of those shows were with an orchestra.  This current line-up still sounds great.  Sure, I wish Cory and Danny could bridge their differences with Chuck, and the reverse as well.  However, as Chuck himself mentioned in his book, he was let go from the band in 1985 for missing more than the allowable number of shows, due to his addiction.  I'm sure all sides aren't perfect, but with an addiction like Chuck had, I would guess that too many things were said and too many bridges were burned.  Anyway, this DVD is a lot of fun to watch and I really enjoyed the interviews.  Danny and Cory were very complimentary on the other members of the band and what they contribute to the overall chemistry.  They also mentioned that the music was FUN again.  This DVD was taped in 2000 but, last night, I could tell they were still having fun, even if Michael Allsup's guitar malfunctioned twice, which made for a good laugh.  I wish there would be a comprehensive DVD compilation of original TDN performances from the 1970's, such as television specials, etc.  Of course, if you don't like TDN, then don't buy this DVD, but at the same time, don't waste time bashing the band.  That won't change the minds of people who love them.  If you do like TDN, then nothing more needs to be said....

The symphony makes the incredible songs that TDN recorded sound new.  As a bonus, there are 2 new songs on the DVD that are well worth checking out for any TDN fan.",1128211200,6,330,4.109375

The only thing I didn't like was the breaks between songs for interviews. I feel that should have been done as a separate segment of the DVD. I'm tired of reading the reviews written by Chuck's fans, who constantly bombard anything related to TDN and try to make them look bad because Chuck is no longer welcome in the band. Chuck was given a chance to reunite with the band. It didn't work. TDN has moved on and they are still fantastic and this DVD shows how versatile they are. They are still one of the best live bands around today.",1122595200,7,641,4.35

The DVD is a classy display of classic rock and up-to-date orchestra music with insurmountable energy.  Three Dog Night sings all their hits and sound as good, if not better, than they did in the 60's and 70's. The entire DVD is excellent.  I grew up with their music and at a recent ""Ladies Night Out"" at my home, we danced and sang along with each song. I highly recommend it if you are into classic Three Dog Night music.",1122508800,12,533,4.474226804123711

I saw the original Dogs, many, many times, in fact, it was my first concert at 13.
I'm 47 now, and without Chuck, they're still ok, just not the stars of the show.
Neither of these fellows, have Chucks range, or intonation.
It's a shame that they're not all together.
I'll bet it has something to do with ego's?

If there's one thing that is certain, without Chuck Negron, Three Dog Night is like a 3-legged dog.  Still a good companion, but won't run.  Don't get me wrong - Danny and Cory can belt out a tune with the best of them.  But Three Dog Night is Danny, Chuck, Cory, Mike, Floyd, Joe (replaced by Jack), and Jimmy.  Period!

As many a reviewer has lamented ""Wheres Chuck"" but as Danny opens with ""Black And White"" we are soon drawn into the show as Danny and Cory prove they still have the chops to sing these amazing songs. Chucks voice is really missed on ""Easy To Be Hard"" as Cory has a hard time hitting the notes on that one. Come on guys,patch it up and get out there for the real Three Dog Night. You could probably sell out hockey rinks again like the old days. Honourable mention has got to go to the band and Tennesee Orchastra which really fill out the sound. Great guitar solo on ""Liar ""which was my personal favorite. Definitely recommended to all dogheads. Peaceout",1069027200,10,740,4.330935251798561
1705890,5,B0000648XT,"Unfortunately there are a lot of bad concert DVDs out there lately. And it seems like the best performers or performances get the worst video direction, sound mixing or production. So when the performers AND the audio/video producers all get it right, like here, I have to rave: This DVD is great!
When I bought it I feared this concert might just be a quaint glimpse of nostolgia, and probably proof that the past should stay in the past. I was wrong. While it is really 2 Dog Night with only Corey and Danny, they have an incredible presence and keep the whole concert entertaining. The orchestra integrates nicely into the performance as well, and the video doesn't suffer from ""jitter-cam"" - 45 different camera angles, jumping from one to the next every 2-3 seconds. With this video you feel like a part of the audience (not a bouncing ball). You can actually sit and watch the concert. In between the songs there is a fade to some commentary from Corey and Danny, but even that is entertaining, brief, and segues nicely into the next song.
My only criticism would be that I thought Corey doing a cover of ""Try a Little Tenderness"" was cheesy. I wish they would have instead slipped in ""The Show Must Go On"". But that is my only criticism.
Great video. Great performance. This would be worth seeing even if you had never even heard of Three Dog Night.",1068940800,3,1356,4.561475409836065

I realized ""hey"" where is the other guy lol. Anyway I watched it so much but was somewhat confused to who sang what originally so I knew I needed to see some old concert footage, off to Ebay I went & purchased some old concerts (bootleg) wow was I blown away at them. I must have sat & watched both new & old concerts over 50 times each & for what it's worth it's true that Chuck is amazing in his own right but Corey Wells is really the backbone of that group when it comes to vocals. I personally loved this DVD but after seeing what they were together it would be awesome to see them all together again. I don't feel that Danny & Cory do justice to Chucks songs such as - One, Celebrate, Joy to the world. On the other hand Danny & Corey still have thier voices and can still entertain and have a good sense of humor on stage. I love the way Corey sings ""Try a little tenderness"" what a soulful guy. I love the DVD and recommend it but if you can you really have to get some of the old concerts and HINT!! To the music industry! Produce some!! :o) Thanks.",1058486400,30,1208,4.0375
