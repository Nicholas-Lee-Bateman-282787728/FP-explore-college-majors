8095941,1,B000C65YYY,"Ron Perlman, your best bet would be to ""Alan Smithee"" your name in the credits and deny any involvement with this for the rest of your life. This movie was SO INCREDIBLY BAD, it just defies explanation. And it's not ""funny bad"", like Plan Nine From Outer Space or Santa Claus Conquers The Martians. No. It is ""seriously bad"", as in ""I just found out my grandmother died in a car wreck"" bad. The horrendous acting by the ""leading"" man (and all the actors - sorry, Ron, you weren't convincing at all), the terrible ""plot"", the imbecilic love story aspect, the unbelievable gaffs in continuity - I could go on. DO NOT PAY MONEY TO SEE THIS. And if some else has rented this and invited you to watch, believe me: You can find a million better things to do with your time. Like, maybe, watching the grass grow, or finding some paint to watch while it dries.",1175126400,4,852,4.39873417721519
8095942,4,B000C65YYY,"It's the middle of World War II.  Nicky Raus doesn't appear to be interested.  We open seeing him working a huge mathematical proof.  Looks like he's been at it for a while.

He's just about to figure it out--the secret to a weapon with potential for mass destruction that the world has not seen before.

The Germans want him back in their country.

The Russians want him, too. They seem to be the front-runners, having planted a spy in his midst-the lovely Olga, a Russian actress, who is only working for the KGB in hopes that they'll release her father, who's been a political prisoner for a number of years.

So do the English.

His mentor, Albert Einstein and Oppenheimer, are begging him to come to Los Alamos, New Mexico to work on the ""Manhattan Project."" America has sent their own agent to claim Raus and bring him to the US.

And every single one of these countries has orders to kill Raus if they can't get him.

""Second Front"" is a fascinating chase based on the true-life story of Raus.  The film moves fast asd is subtitled often in both Russian and German.  This is very authentic, but can be confusing--but is also very worth the viewing.",1149292800,13,1155,4.5
