6244238,1,B00HZMRY5U,"Oh no no no.  This is a crappy movie.  Tell me, is it common that a plain but smarmy gay man seduces straight men - so many of them too?  He wants a straight man who is gay for him - and when he gets someone resents that he has a girlfriend (well duh)he doesn't want him to be straight.  But how does he get anyone - well most have been drinking...heavily.  He is a Sleazy mess who cannot act and repulses me.  Really there is NOTHING to recommend this.  Not even worth writing this EXCEPT it may save you from making the mistake I have made.  Go find something really good...like Third Man Out or Shock to the System (Donald Strachey Mysteries).  Those are so worth it - this is CRAPPY.  So just in case I am not clear above...this is horrible:-(",1201478400,4,747,4.160839160839161
6244239,4,B00HZMRY5U,"Although the production was not perfect I loved the premise of this funny little movie. It is amazing to me that things that most gays are complaining about are exactly the points I am drawn to. The main character was interesting and honest, his did realize that his attraction to straights is an emotional dead end and did see a shrink (A real weirdo of a  ""hipster shrink""). But I personally always thought that there is an interesting ""Ying Yang"" between certain homosexuals and certain straights, a wonderful twilight zone full of mystery that is well worth exploring and is being too often shunned off as ""homophobic"". Not so. Whatever happened to ""sexuality is one big gray zone? An obvious victim of the big gay push attempting to tell everyone who to lust after what's right and what's wrong in the gay bible. Gay life is not for everybody and this movie makes a good point of that.
If my words speak to you see the film.",1197763200,5,929,4.562874251497006
6244240,4,B00HZMRY5U,"I like to support Independent films. I'm not expecting a polished Hollywood movie. Some are good, some are just plain awful. It's a matter of personal taste anyway. I watched this last night (rental) and really enjoyed the movie. It was obviously tongue and cheek humor and had an original idea. A lot of good looking shirtless straight(?) guys was the basic theme. You have to overlook the technical flaws and the one that bugged me the most was the loudness of the songs. I had my volume turned to the lowest setting and it was still loud. 25 minutes of out takes were enough and Roy's music video was well, can you say c-h-e-e-s-y? Also, could the credits roll any slower? I mean 4 minutes is overkill. Expect a light funny Independent low budget movie with lots of shirtless straight men and you'll be fine.",1194566400,8,811,4.561643835616438
6244241,2,B00HZMRY5U,I was disappointed after reading the other reviews as to how good this film was. The acting is poor with a very weak story line. There are however some handsome boys in the film.,1193875200,5,178,4.264705882352941
6244242,2,B00HZMRY5U,"This character dates only straight, unavailable guys.  And then he wonders why he is so unhappy, telling his friends what bad experiences he had the night before with some straight guy who was drunk enough to have sex with him.  I had a lot of trouble sympathizing with him.
Otherwise, the acting and script were below average, so even though I tried to like it since it is a gay film, I just couldn't.",1191974400,7,402,4.418918918918919
6244243,4,B00HZMRY5U,What a classic. This brought me back to He- Haw days. Enjoyed this and is fun to play for people who like this style.,1416873600,,117,3.9166666666666665

6244246,3,B00HZMRY5U,"Besides the Hank Williams material and Bill Monroe, this is the bottom of the barrel stuff from the Gannaway series of movies.",1409097600,,126,4.7727272727272725
6244247,2,B00HZMRY5U,"Ever heard the expression ""too good to be true""? File this DVD under it.

Obviously fans of these old music shows go wild any time they're released, but this is one that you might be disappointed with. That is, unless you truly believe that anything is better than nothing. Normally, I would bear with it, but the quality of the video throughout this DVD is too awful. I own several DVD's of old music/variety shows (all 4 of the Country Style U.S.A. DVD's, for example), and this is the worst.

E.J. Van Beek summarized the issues with this product fairly well (so read his review, too). However, I'd like to also point out that the appearance of most of the footage shows digital artifacts including very noticeable pixelation. It's easy to see unless you're sitting too far from your screen. To get an idea of what I'm talking about, go to Youtube and start an old Grand Ole Opry video. Now, enlarge it to fit your entire screen. Can you see the distorted blocks appearing and disappearing? That is what you'll experience with this DVD. Sad but true. The Hank Williams footage isn't quite as bad, but the quality overall is inexcusable.

Shanachie clearly didn't even try to scan any of the footage properly or treat the Hank Williams footage better. Instead, they've compiled awful transfers with ill-timed fades at the beginning and end of each performance. They probably figured using ""the only Hank Williams footage"" alongside ""early color footage of Bill Monroe"" as the selling points would get them easy money no matter how bad the video aspects are. Therefore I do not recommend this. You can stream all of the ""only Hank Williams footage"" from various sites and the quality is just as good or slightly worse.

6244248,3,B00HZMRY5U,"Finally, 60 years after they were broadcasted, all Hank Williams' performances on The Kate Smith Evening Hour have become availabe on DVD. This is something many country music lovers have waited for for a long time.
The Hank Williams performances are combined with priceless 1954/1956 color footage from Al Gannaway's ""The Country Show"" and ""Stars of the Grand Ole Opry"". Main attractions: Bill Monroe & His Blue Grass Boys and The Louvin Brothers.

Unfortunately the Hank Williams footage (and also some Country Show footage) was not directly transfered from the original kinescopes, but from videotape.

Not only did Shanachie a bad job on the mastering of this DVD. The editing is sloppy too. Some performances abruptly start and end.

Moreover, Shanachie messed up the aspect ratio from the Country Show footage. They narrowed the original 4:3 ratio to 8:9. Never seen anything like this...",1404086400,3,894,5.194444444444445
6244249,5,B00HZMRY5U,"This is a great DVD for one reason, Hank Williams , it is the only known Television appearance. For over 50 years we have only seen one Live image of Hank Williams sing "" Hey Good Lookin"" which was used with Hank JR. sing the Duet ""Tear in my Beer"" . However what makes this DVD song fantastic is there were several other performances with Hank on The Kate Smith TV SHow. This DVD has all 4!!

8637552,4,B00HZMRY5U,"Through and through...a great DVD! Don't be fooled about the ratio complaints; this disc is formatted to comply with 16X9 TVs. As long as your player and tv are set accordingly,  the aspect ratio will be correct.  As to the item description where it says beautiful 16mm color film; it lives up to its creed. Now I suppose the real interest here is the Hank Sr footage. I have both complete Kate Smith shows on a bootleg disc in very good quality; but the clarity on You Are There is worth the upgrare to me. My one and only complaint and the reason I gave four stars instead of five, is because I personally would have preferred complete shows on here rather than just the highlights.  Overall I am very satisfied with this title and recommend it.",1434240000,,747,4.437956204379562
