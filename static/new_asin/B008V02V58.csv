8530735,5,B008V02V58,"I bought this to supplement my ASL class.  I enjoy it.  Bob Hiltermann makes it fun and as he teaches he repeats and importantly, gives time for you to try to sign.  The only down side to me is the song ""Don't Worry Be Happy"" at the end that took a lot of time, I would like to have had more signing.  I am still planning on purchasing the other DVD's in the series.  Just an added thought, my husband in not taking the ASL class but even he enjoyed the DVD.",1381017600,,458,3.9347826086956523
