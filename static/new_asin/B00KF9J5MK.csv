6424141,5,B00KF9J5MK,"Just watched this great documentary.  I learned lots about one of the most important life support system componentsbesides water and air. I thought the first part of this documentary was critical in getting a sense of what soil is and what it is composed of.  Soil, except for food production, rarely gets mentioned in studies, articles, and documents on Climate Change.

The knee-jerk response by those who say that we cannot possibly feed the populations of the world with organic farming hijacks the entire discussion about the need to have healthy soil as we go further into Climate Change. Food production on a planet moving towards 9 billion folks by 2050 is critical, but it tends to blind us to the need for soil that does a lot more than grow cropsprobably some biological ecological functions by some unknown creatures in the soil we barely understand.

My favorite quote in the documentary is that watching soil through a microscope is like watching Times Square on New Years Eve. Pausing on this quote for a moment gives one a sense of the infinite complexity of a substance that covers this planet, a substance we have mistreated badly without hardly as clue as to what it is. Soil, the discovery of all that it does, should be a critical part of all Climate Change discussions.

This reminds me of an old joke: The dentist tells his patient that his teeth are fine but the gums have to come out.  Soil is the gums. If we are able to feed 9 billion folks in 2050 but we have trashed the soil with toxins and GMOs in the process, our way of life and those in it will no longer be sustainable.",1406419200,13,1604,4.552083333333333
6424142,5,B00KF9J5MK,"I just started watching this one day, just from the descriptive blurb.  What a great treat.  Simply one of the most beautiful, inspiring, and enlightening films I have ever seen.  It has opened my eyes to worthy efforts surrounding us to sustain the earth as provider, improve the integrity of the soil, restore full nutritive values and healing powers of food, and connect with and support and respect one another in good hard work. Jam-packed with interesting and useful information and very thoughtfully presented, by a wide selection of remarkable experts, and so beautifully filmed.",1504483200,,587,5.157894736842105

6424146,5,B00KF9J5MK,"This is so good it should be watched and incorporated by any serious, or non serious for that matter, gardener. Extremely well prepared and presented without preaching to the viewer. I was extremely relieved to see that they avoided preaching man-made global weather modification. I am completing a Master Gardener program and believe this to be the best approach to soil development and care. Highly Recommended!",1494720000,,413,5.2727272727272725

It is a must-see for gardeners--professional and home- organic or not.  Very educational. Very  highly recommended.",1483488000,,265,4.954545454545454
6424150,3,B00KF9J5MK,"When designing a video-documentary, it takes discipline not to use the occasion to discuss one's personal views or pet peeves, even when an outside observer could tell you they have little to do with - or may even obscure the topic. That's where a good editor can be invaluable.
Unfortunately, if such an editor was available, she/he wasn't taken into account. That's too bad. As just one example, this is not the place to globally condemn genetically engineered crops. An experienced editor would have trimmed the material down to an attractive half or one hour documentary. Extraneous personal topics tend to weigh in heavily, making it hard for a listener to concentrate on what's important -  Deborah Koons Garcia's valuable topic itself.",1480550400,,742,5.081967213114754

I had a tear in my eye at the end, thinking of all the damage that is done to to the Earth every day by uneducated or irresponsible people. I highly recommend it.

6424165,5,B00KF9J5MK,"I reeeeeally liked this movie! It explains why we need to preserve the soil in its natural conditions, let it live, instead of letting current modern agricultural business techniques destroy it. There are ways to keep soil fertile and get benefits from nature if we mimic nature in the way it works to regenerate soil. I liked the spiritual message from Genesis in the end. I think that sometime people who use the first books about Earth creation (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) forget that God asked Adam and Eve to take care of the garden, preserve it and I am happy that this movie brings this responsibility to light.",1445299200,4,624,4.73394495412844

6424172,5,B00KF9J5MK,"This is everything you would want to know about soil. One of the key items is that without soil organisms things such as nitrogen will not be pulled from the air and made bio available to plants.

We all need to know these things with the CO2 over 400 and the gov't spraying nano particles in the sky, you need to educate and ARM yourself with this information.",1430956800,2,361,4.3088235294117645
6424173,3,B00KF9J5MK,"The first half of this video was very informative.  It detailed very accurately what soil ""is,"" and how it is formed.  That part of it was good, but not particularly scientific.  Then, the activism started.  That part of it wasn't good.  If you want to learn about soil composition in layman's terms, watch the first half, and then go outside and dig up your backyard to see for yourself, for the last half-hour.  As soon as I saw Vandana Shiva, one of the rock-stars of the anti-transgenic crop movement, but definitely NOT a soil scientist, expert, or agronomist, show up, I tuned out immediately.  She has no business in a serious work about soil science.  But, sadly, that's not what ""Symphony of the Soil"" is.  It's yet ANOTHER quasi-scientific activist project that wraps itself in ""sciency"" language, while the real agenda is the usual anti-conventional ag alarmism.  This DVD would be right at home with all of the other unscientific activist pabulum in the AcresUSA ""bookstore.""  The filmmakers were pretty clever, though...anyone who is not familiar with Vandava Shiva would never know that the propaganda was well underway. They assiduously presented her as just another smart person who knows about dirt, and has ""concerns.""  Hence my headline.

Fortunately someone loaned this to me and I didn't pay for it.  Bottom line:  I would recommend this to someone who wants to know more about soil, in a very simplistic, uncomplicated context.  But I would make the caveat that there's an agenda.  Unfortunately, so many agriculturally-related ""documentaries"" have one these days.  I honestly don't know what the people who make them would do if Monsanto went of business.  Well, I know they would kick off a rave.  But after that, who knows.",1429920000,2,1748,4.962068965517242
