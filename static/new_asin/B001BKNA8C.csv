8489079,5,B001BKNA8C,"The late Guro (a respectful Filipino martial arts title similar to Sensei or Sifu) Ted Lucaylucay (my teacher's teacher) was a true master of movement, and he loved edged weapons, and his skill (as well as his relaxed, yet somehow intense teaching style) is well-displayed here.

This video offers many different blade training drills, as well as some simple, effective footwork/movement drills, and all are simply taught, making them easily transferred from the screen to your own training area

The 12 Angles of knife attacks, and the very effective practice methodology imparted here is priceless.",1499817600,,600,5.3052631578947365
8489080,3,B001BKNA8C,"The DVD was probably filmed in the 80s so the quality is not great.  It does not contain chapters so it would be difficult to go back to sections you want to concentrate on.  If you're looking to own a DVD of Ted Lucaylucay, this would be great as long as you already have the foundation and understanding of what he is trying to put out.",1353283200,2,338,4.106060606060606
