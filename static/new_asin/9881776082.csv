One of the best classic, Gory, movie that is out there, Actores, and Acting is also impressive, not to mention awesome Director!!",1398556800,,139,4.833333333333333
1174977,5,9881776082,"The movie itself was simple, the plot easy to follow. The more interesting details, however, are for the car fans. If you love cars, you will like this movie. All I have to say is Silvia and GTR.",1397520000,,195,4.157894736842105
1174978,4,9881776082,"This movie delivers as a crime-action-car stunt movie.  It doesn't attempt to be anything more than this but is executed so well, it is a cut above a Fast and Furious movie.",1395705600,,173,4.40625
1174979,2,9881776082,"There are some problems with the movie, and one of them starts before the movie begins.  The cars on the cover do not appear in the movie.  The second problem is that this movie promises to be a pretty serious car chase movie, which, well, there are moments, but it really isn't.  And because it tries so hard to be stoic that it's not even stupid fun - like Fast and Furious, for instance.  It's one of those movies you just walk away thinking, ""oh well...""",1395273600,,458,4.290697674418604
1174980,2,9881776082,"eh, just ok.
Some interesting scenes if you're a car guy.
Overall, don't expect too much and you might not be too disappointed.",1387152000,,127,4.565217391304348
1174981,4,9881776082,Good police procedural.  Anthony Wong was excellent as he usually is. Hong Kong is such a great location for movies.,1378166400,,116,4.8
1174982,3,9881776082,"The first thing that stuck out with this film, as it often is, was the film's cover. The hot muscle cars on the DVD artwork had my attention from the get-go. However, once I found out it was a Hong Kong flick, I knew the likelihood of the cars shown on the cover actually being in the film was low. I know they say don't judge a book, in this case DVD, by its cover, but it's misleading for someone making a blind buy purchase. Rant aside, the gearhead inside me loved this flick. It follows an elite squad of cops, known as the Invisible Squad, who chase down street racers. The outcome is 75% car chases, and 25% cop flick. While there aren't any hot American muscle cars, we do have a few cool imports and some very skilled stunt drivers to boot. The storyline was surprisingly original, the action exhilarating, and it never really lets up. For a car chase movie, it really gives you everything you could want. However, as is sometimes the case when I watch Hong Kong flicks is that I feel as if things get lost in translation. Maybe it's the fast dialog or missing subtitles, but I sometimes felt like things moved quickly without a lot of elaboration. That could just be a culture thing as well, but at any rate, fans of car chase flicks will find a lot to appreciate. This would be one case where I'd forgive a Hollywood remake, there are a lot of great elements in Motorway.

Disclosure: Film sent by Lionsgate",1366502400,2,1452,4.401486988847584
1174983,2,9881776082,"Motorway is like a 70s car movie, minus any kind of memorable, high stakes, pulse-pounding, well-shot climactic chase scene.

The plot is as simple as they were back then: a veteran cop and a rookie cop are trying to hunt down a seasoned getaway driver who has come back into town after over a decade away to help out a fellow crook in need.

Which is actually quite a lot more than most iconic 70s car movies. However, it lacks both atmosphere and that automotive punch.

First, for the atmosphere -- the film just felt too tame. I was never too involved with the characters, and even a dramatic turning point halfway through the film felt more like a plot point being checked off a list than something meant to shape the characters I was watching. It didn't carry any kind of distinctive flair the whole way through, it felt like a hundred other movies, nothing special.

So, with little story, characters who are failing to engage, what remains is the chase scenes. There were several, but given the tame atmosphere of the films, without the feeling of raised stakes, and without anything inspired going on in the chase, I just wasn't into it. There is a bit of a chase around the halfway point involving the two cops chasing the crook down a hill that were tightly done, but that was all of 5 minutes of the entire film. The finale (what could be seen of it -- most of it took place in a parking garage with all the lights out)  wasn't even as intense as this and ended so abruptly that I had to rewind to make sure I didn't miss some kind of build up to its sudden end.

It was a quick 90 mintues, and I never quite felt bored with the movie, but I did feel very underwhelmed in the end.",1363824000,2,1692,4.321766561514195
1174984,2,9881776082,"Anthony Wong has been a part of so many clever and classy action films that it actually hurt watching him play a veteran cop (on the verge of retirement, nonetheless) in this mostly anonymous picture.  Still, there's nothing wrong with a harmless diversion, and I suppose you could do a lot worse than a single viewing of MOTORWAY ... though, at the moment, I'm a little hard-pressed to come up with a worse suggestion.

(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)

Cheung (played by Shawn Yue) is a rookie cop too big for his britches.  Recruited to serve as part of a stealth police patrol that keeps reckless street racers from doing harm, he finds himself benched with radar patrol once he makes one mistake too many.  Still, his partner Lo (the aforementioned Wong) knows his sidekick has the right stuff, and, before you can say `Grand Theft Auto,' he'll take the young stud under his wing - erm, wheels? - in order to teach him the ropes for some quick moves that'll give him the edge when chasing down the street villains.

So much of MOTORWAY veers ridiculous close to the edge of believability that it's hard to find a whole lot in there worth enjoying.  Wong and Yue do the best they can with the half-baked script, borrowing liberally from some others films that capitalized on the need for speed, be it the FAST & FURIOUS franchise and even TOP GUN.  In fact, there are a handful of scenes that unfold late in the picture (I won't spoil it) that feel almost photocopied from TOP GUN, and (would you believe it?) it's like the voice of Obi-Wan himself is telling young Cheung how to navigate his car through the climax in order to destroy the Death Star ... erm, catch the bad guys.

And about that climax?  I understand that director Pou-Soi Cheang may've been trying to add some stylish conventions to Joey O'Bryan's video-game-quality screenplay, but I have to say that shooting a chase in an unlit parking garage where so little could be seen was probably not his smartest idea.  Granted, it emphasizes that whole `trust your feelings, Luke' aspect of it all, but, when audiences can't see what's happening, they tend to lose interest very ""fast and furiously.""  MOTORWAY ends up being not so much a movie with car chases as it is a car chase with a movie attached ... and not a very good movie, at that.

MOTORWAY is produced by Media Asia Films, Milky Way Image Company, and Sil-Metropole Organisation.  DVD distribution (stateside) is being handled by Lionsgate.  For those needing clarification, this is a Cantonese-spoken film, though the disc offers both English-subtitles or an English-dubbed version.  As is often the case with these imports, the disc is light on extras, though there is a five-minute-plus `making of' short that's really little more than a bloated theatrical trailer.

(MILDLY) RECOMMENDED.  I've seen far better Hong Kong actioners than MOTORWAY, but I've also seen far worse.  A lot worse.  Still, I expected better from a film involving Anthony Wong, mostly because he's been a part of so many solid pictures than this.  I don't know what drew him to this (did he lose a bet?), even though it's a harmless car flick that'll probably disappear from your memory as soon as you pop it from the DVD player.

In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Lionsgate provided me with an advance DVD screener of MOTORWAY by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",1363132800,2,3779,4.743119266055046
1174985,5,9881776082,"This movie is SWEET!!!

But honestly, Motorway reflects Hong Kong's infamous street racing and crime. Director Soi Cheang combines his neo-noir photography + voyeur camera angles with high performance. The Chinese(HK) are sophisticated regarding cars, and this film reflects that accurately with BMW E86 Z4 M Coupe, Audi A4 2.6, Honda AP2 S2000, Nissan RS13 180SX, Silvia S15, Audi TTS, Nissan Z32 Fairlady Z, & Nissan R34 Skyline GT-R. Plus, small automotive details are highlighted to show technical sophistication like left foot braking, aftermarket fuel injectors, clutch control, engine management/tuning, side turning, and downhill racing. If you love cars and racing, this film is a privilege.

The plot is not super complex but simply cops and robbers. However, Motorway features a very cool, dark photography/tone of the streets and crime. It makes HK's dim, claustrophobic streets even shadier with Cheung's style of directing. Similar to Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive(2011), it is about how the director shoots the film and creates a noir experience. The excellent, accurate car chases and high-revving engines provides a dangerous feeling. It is not a film to entertain you with a great story but is a dark work of sight and sound. That is real film-making.",1354579200,4,1268,5.335
7901827,2,9881776082,"I had hoped ""Motorway"" would be a better movie than was. I won't go into detail about the story as a few other reviewers have done a nice job in covering what the film is about. The acting was good although it is dubbed. The cars with the exception of a new sporty BMW are crap. An old bunch of cars to say the least. An older black Audi, what appears to be a late eighties Nissan 240SX as well as a early nineties Nissan 300Z. None of the cars on the cover are anywhere to be seen. You'd think they could have had better cars for this flick. If you enjoy car chase movies you can't go wrong with ""Vanishing Point"", ""Gone In 60 Seconds"", ""Smokey And The Bandit"" or newer films like ""Need For Speed"" or ""Born To Race"".",1489968000,,717,4.092198581560283
7901828,3,9881776082,"The movie features a plot very similar to many of the on the run, cops vs. thieves movies released in Hong Kong. The movie has a decent storyline, but the overall action and energy of the film are quite mediocre. Certain parts of the movie contain seemingly skipped sections in order to get to the conclusion of the film. It is a somewhat enjoyable film only if you don't have any top films to watch.",1420934400,,400,4.346666666666667
