8104779,3,B000E371EG,Its not that is a bad DVD.  But please just two homes and of course its the two most popular homes George Washington's Mt. Vernon and Thomas Jefferson's Monticello... there had to be more then those two homes. Both are wonderful homes. However they should have added a unfamiliar home or called it the (Homes of our Presidents)..... if I where you  I would save your money OR buy it cheep.,1247443200,8,389,4.464788732394366
