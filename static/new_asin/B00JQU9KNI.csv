6389108,5,B00JQU9KNI,"I love these fast & effective workouts!  Right under 20 minutes - just needs small weights and a mat.
Leaves you feeling awesome and refreshed.  A fast an effective bottom lifter.",1414800000,2,179,4.741935483870968
6389109,5,B00JQU9KNI,Tracey Mallett has done it again with her energizing and rigorous workout routine.  I absolutely love this new workout.  Tracey has done it again with her techniques for maintaining a strong and toned body.,1408579200,4,206,5.029411764705882
6389110,1,B00JQU9KNI,I am 44 and 5'5 130 lbs and I do Denise Austin Quick burn Cardio 3 times a week and bought this to mix up my workouts.  This dvd requires you to balance  on one leg while using your weights.....  I had my ACL replaced 4 years and this did not work for me at all.,1407888000,4,262,3.642857142857143
6389111,4,B00JQU9KNI,"I love Tracey Mallett- I have 8 of her DVD's. Like other reviewers have said, she has excellent cuing, uses and demonstrates safe and effective movements (with modifiers when possible) and I have yet to get sick of her voice. The only problem I have with her workouts is that most of the movements require the flexibility of a seasoned dancer, which I do not have. Although I love the majority of this video, there are some sets I skip and just do static lunges (to work on my flexibility) rather than doing the movements because my legs simply do not move that way (yet!).
After doing her DVD's, I have seen a huge improvement in my flexibility, but I still struggle with some of the movements (deep lunges, donkey/side kicks, etc) that require hip flexer flexibility.",1403136000,16,769,4.62043795620438
6389112,5,B00JQU9KNI,"I've never had such rapid results with any other trainer. I love Tracey because her choreography is not only safe and effective,  but healing as well! I find that there are many fitness ""Experts"" that are able to create thousands of movements, but a few weeks in your knees, hips, shoulders etc. may be in pain or injured. I've found with Tracey I never feel pain in my joints, in fact they feel stronger and more pliable. She has a voice that you never get sick of and her cueing is spot on. I've learned so much just from the advice and cues she gives.
Tracey is the Booty expert, so it is only natural that this DVD should be considered the modern ""Buns of Steele!"" She isn't lying when she says you can ""Blast your Cellulite!' Stick with her and you will be stronger, leaner, and more flexible for the long term!

6389113,5,B00JQU9KNI,"Tracey Mallet is so great I do a lot of working out at home and love her booty barre dvds, these are both awesome workouts and both 20 minutes.",1401667200,2,143,3.9655172413793105
6389114,5,B00JQU9KNI,"I started exercising seriously and regularly 9 months ago, and mostly rely on DVDs.  Between purchases and borrowing from library I've tried dozens and plenty of instructors.  Some I enjoy more than others but admittedly it's because for the most part they're easier than others.  Tracy does not provide that luxury!  I like her the best because you EXERCISE and isn't that what you put the DVD in for? Here again we have 20 minute workouts - easy, right? - that have your heart racing and legs shaking 6 minutes in.  Three solid weeks of this DVD - and be honest, I'm talking several times a week if not every day - and there's no way you're not going to be admiring your newly toned booty.  This is a problem area for me, being pear shaped, and so I opted for this DVD vs. her other new one which concentrates on abs.  Everyone can fit 20 minutes into their day, no excuses - and while I don't know that at 52 I'll ever again be bikini bootylicious, I look forward to shaking my newly toned and lifted ""groove thing"".",1400112000,30,1019,4.35978835978836
8653362,5,B00JQU9KNI,It's a really great workout!!! It's hard and makes me sweat and sometimes I can't get through all the exercises because I'm so worn out! But that's what you want out of a workout right?!!! I've definitely seen results in about 3 weeks with doing this and some other exercise videos at home!!,1498176000,,291,4.509433962264151
8653363,5,B00JQU9KNI,I love this workout! Tracey is very motivating!,1484352000,,47,5.0
8653364,4,B00JQU9KNI,Unique moves that really focuses on the bum. I wish it was longer than 20 minutes.,1451865600,,82,4.1875
8653365,5,B00JQU9KNI,"I'm an avid runner and use workout videos to mix up my routine. This is a staple and probably my favorite. She's not annoying and it is challenging enough that I do feel it the next day every time. I've been using 2x a week and can see a difference in muscle tone, as well as in my leg strength / split times. I'd recommend this to a friend for sure!",1442016000,3,350,3.943661971830986
8653366,5,B00JQU9KNI,"After only a month of doing this workout at least 3 times a week, I've already noticed a visible difference in cellulite reduction. I alternate between the two 20 minute workouts about 3 days a week with a light treadmill workout another 2-3 days a week. I've done that same treadmill workout for years and I've tried other videos in the past. This DVD is the first that has made such a quick and noticeable difference in just one month! My hips/booty/upper thigh/saddlebags have always been a problem area and I've never been able to make a noticeable difference in getting rid of the cellulite and saddlebags and never been able to get the lower body looking toned. The instant gratification now motivates me to wake up 20 minutes earlier to do this video before work. I highly recommend!!!",1441324800,12,792,4.705035971223022
8653367,5,B00JQU9KNI,"Butt Kicker! I am pouring in sweat within the first 5 minutes! If you want something fast... this is the ticket. My sister bought me this DVD for my birthday:) I love it! I typically do both 20 minute segments,  but if you want a hard core workout, try both. I will definitely keep doing this video in addition to my regular barre, pilates, and cardio routines. Thanks Tracey!",1430956800,,376,4.449275362318841
8653368,4,B00JQU9KNI,"It is a very good workout, however it is not that fun. The second one is better then the first.  There really isn't any music so it feels more like being at a high school Gym class then doing a fun workout.  That being said I still use it for my hard days because it is one heck of a workout.",1427587200,5,292,3.7704918032786887
8653369,5,B00JQU9KNI,"At only 20 minutes for each workout, these are great to fit into your schedule.
The clock counting down time really helps get you through.
Even though short, I felt these workouts were really good and could feel it in my muscles the nest day.
This is one of my favourite workout DVDs",1427587200,4,283,4.3584905660377355
8653370,3,B00JQU9KNI,I borrowed this from my library. I love Traceys energy and most her workouts really push you and make you feel good after. I have a couple other dvds of hers myself. And im starting to notice her back side seems to be deflating!!! Not my desired goal! Her bum used to be fuller and more lifted. It seems shes lost muscle and hanging low. I tend to choose my workouts based on the instructor body...why? Because if they look good then i want to do what they're doing!! My back side is flat genetically so i need things that help build me up. And if shes losing it then i don't want a workout thats going to make me loose it. I do love the dvds i already have but i use them in combination with other more weighted workouts. Maybe im crazy but i don't want a butt as flat as the one shes trying to flaunt on the cover. If i wanted my butt that flat all i have to do is sit on it for a couple weeks while my hard earned work disappears.,1424390400,3,933,3.9680851063829787
