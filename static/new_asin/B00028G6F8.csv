2067301,5,B00028G6F8,A good workout video for everyone to try.,1422835200,,41,4.25
2067302,5,B00028G6F8,"This DVD is excellent! I have been out of shape for years, and this routine is just perfect for me with little time to go to a gym. It has 3-ten minute workout sections. The instructor is so encouraging throughout the program. I just love it! Perfect addition for my workout plan for an excellent price!",1421539200,,303,4.428571428571429
2067303,5,B00028G6F8,Gave my original dvd to a friend because i loved this dvd that much.  bought Janis Saffell's other dvd's as well.  You will get a great workout with any of them....,1417651200,,164,4.258064516129032
2067304,4,B00028G6F8,it is a good workout for beginner kickboxing.  if you are more experienced do all 3 at once and it gives you a good workout.,1403481600,,124,3.96
2067305,4,B00028G6F8,"DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THE ROUTINES.

I WAS DRIPPING SWEAT AFTER 10 MINS AS A NEWBIE.

 KEEP WATER ON HAND, YOU WILL NEED IT . MY HAIR WAS SATURATED !  STOP IF YOU  HAVE TO AND START THE SEGMENT FROM BEGINNING IF YOU FEEL IT IS TOO MUCH OR HEART RATE IS TOO FAST.

THIS TAKES SOME GETTING USE TO- AND IS A SURPRISING GOOD CARDIO WORK OUT.
TO SIT AND JUST WATCH IT, IT IS RATHER DECEIVING.

YES- BEGINNERS CAN DO MOST OF THE MOVES- BUT IF OUT OF SHAPE, YOU WILL FEEL IT FAST- SO TAKE YOUR TIME EVEN IF YOU FALL BEHIND.

JUST FOLLOW WHAT YOU SEE AS IT WILL TAKE SEVERAL VIEWINGS TO GET THE HANG OF IT.

I DO LIKE THIS DVD A LOT AND IT LETS YOU CHOOSE WHICH OF THE 10 MIN ROUTINES YOU WANT TO DO.

 THE ONLY DRAWBACK IS JANIS SAFFELL, THE HOST AND TRAINER OF THE VIDEO.

GREAT, UPBEAT PERSONALITY BUT SHE REALLY SHOULD HAVE DONE THIS BEGINNER VIDEO WITH A SLOWER SPEECH / DEMO PATTERN ,AS IT MOVES A BIT TOO QUICK.

 EVEN IF WHAT SHE IS SHOWING YOU CAN BE DONE BY MOST BEGINNERS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT EASIER TO LEARN IF SHE SLOWED DOWN WHAT SHE SHOWED YOU SO YOU COULD KEEP UP .

ALL IN ALL- WORTH THE PRICE!.",1401062400,,1106,3.896860986547085
2067306,5,B00028G6F8,"There are four 10 min workouts all together on this DVD.  One is called a ""bonus"".  I like the bonus workout.  It is the most intense.  I also like the arms and legs focused workout.  I certainly feel it in my arms the next day when I use this DVD.  I am not a big of the core workout.  It doesn't seem to do much and sometimes makes my stomach feel ill from the rocking back and forth.",1398902400,,386,3.871794871794872
2067307,3,B00028G6F8,"For the record, there are three routines, not four as previously noted.  The first two are pleasant enough and if you apply yourself there's a cardio benefit.  Janis is really straining to do this with the third ""core"" workout - more hype than much else.  A one-timer for me.",1398643200,,275,4.571428571428571
2067308,4,B00028G6F8,"I like that these are quick workouts that you can do if pinched for time, good queuing and and fun workout if you enjoy kickboxing.",1397174400,,131,4.28
2067309,5,B00028G6F8,"I had it years ago and lost it when I moved. Quick, interesting, and you really feel it working! So glad I found it again! =D",1395273600,,125,3.8461538461538463
2067310,3,B00028G6F8,"I thought this was a workout for true kickboxing routines (with a glove and bag) but it's just exercises that simulate kickboxing (air boxing).  Personally found it fairly boring (exercises weren't all that interesting compared to other exercise routines) but if you're looking for something a little more intense that just standard aerobics, it's not a bad workout (it's a decent total body workout).",1394582400,,401,5.265625
2067317,4,B00028G6F8,"I like 10 minute exercises because, you can do a forty minute/hour workout everyday. The AWESOME thing with
10 minutes dvds is that you can work EVERY part of your body in the LEAST amount of time but, still get a daily
workout without BOREDOM!",1392595200,,244,4.444444444444445
2067318,4,B00028G6F8,"This is a great kickboxing DVD for beginners. It is exactly 30 minutes, as advertised. I would've liked it to be more challenging, but it's a nice supplement if you don't feel like working out really hard. I use it before strength training as a warm-up.

It consists of:
-10 minutes upper body (lots of punches)
-10 minutes lower body (knees and kicks)
-10 minutes core (more knees)

One thing I did approve of is that the moves are completely equal on each side. Sometimes, kickboxing videos don't switch left to right evenly and I like to work both sides the same way.",1386892800,2,570,4.524271844660194
2067319,5,B00028G6F8,"I really like this DVD, it is easy enough for a beginner yet it makes you really work up a sweat. Good for people with joint/knee issues. I typically do all 3 workouts (10 minutes each). I think the instructor is motivating and effective. I would recommend this DVD.",1386028800,,266,4.448979591836735
2067320,5,B00028G6F8,"This is one of my favorite exercise CD's!  Several different CD's are included.
Nice music.  East to follow and fun to do.",1381104000,,122,4.5
2067321,4,B00028G6F8,"This video was as expected. Pretty true to the other reviews, very basic, but good for beginners who want to sweat.",1379980800,,115,4.523809523809524
2067322,4,B00028G6F8,"I like this product, its well paced, the instructor is good at leading and announcing moves before they happen.  I think it might be trickier if you've never done kickboxing and don't know how to perform the moves without hurting yourself.  I'm not always sure I am doing them properly!",1377043200,,286,4.7
2067323,5,B00028G6F8,"This is a great video. The lower body kicks really work up a sweat. I like how it breaks down upper, lower, and ab workout into ten min segments. Also, I like ab work is all standing, no floor work. Great workout. Love!",1376784000,,219,4.116279069767442
2067324,1,B00028G6F8,There are better free workouts on YouTube.  Even has awesome club beat music to work out with!  This DVD was a waste of money,1375488000,2,125,4.166666666666667
2067325,4,B00028G6F8,"It's fast pace, so I find it a bit challenging. Good for someone like me, who is not in there 20's.",1375142400,2,99,3.761904761904762
2067326,1,B00028G6F8,"Cheesy music, costumes that looked like something Elvis would have worn and I have no idea how anyone would break a sweat doing this workout.  Total joke.",1373414400,2,154,4.703703703703703
2067334,4,B00028G6F8,This is especially good if you want to get quick workout(s) in without going to the gym and need that pick me up. It is not boring and makes you sweat.,1371254400,,151,3.903225806451613
2067335,4,B00028G6F8,There are 3 kickboxing style segments. The video is only approx 30 minutes but I feel like I have gottena great workout. The instruction is clear and all you need are your tennis shoes. Get ready to sweat.,1371168000,,205,4.421052631578948
2067336,3,B00028G6F8,"This isn't a bad workout dvd, it's just not intense enough for me. I used this video when it first came out (2008), and bought one for a friend who recently decided she needed a change. It's a good dvd for the beginner, or someone just getting back into fitness, and I would recommend it as such. The routines are short, and easy to follow, and they will get your blood pumpin'. If you want to get the most out of this video, I suggest adding some resistance to it. A light pair of dumbbells, glove weights, etc work great for that. The added resistance will add a bit more of a challenge, and will help with results. For me, the dvd alone gets my heart rate up, but when I add a pair of dumbbells, I can actually break a sweat. I'm not down playing this dvd at all, in fact, I know a few people who have used this as a starting point, and have been very happy with the results. If you're just beginning, or getting back into it, this dvd along with a heathy diet, and a commitment to a better you, is a good place to start.",1370736000,3,1024,4.074257425742574
2067337,5,B00028G6F8,This video is great in the sense that you can work out on your own timetable. No need to drive all the way to the gym for a cardio class.,1369180800,,137,3.6
2067338,2,B00028G6F8,"Call me crazy, but I love my old Billy Blanks VHS tapes - especially Taebo Live Advanced #2 of #3.  It's a fantastic workout.  I also enjoy Turbo Jam DVD workouts.  To me, Janis's Total Cardio Kick was similar to a beginners video, comparatively.  I returned it.",1368316800,,262,4.51063829787234
2067339,3,B00028G6F8,"I've been workout to lose weight over the past year and kickboxing is the main style of exercise I choose to use for burning calories, but I wanted something different then what I had been doing and would easily fit into days I don't have as much time as I would like to exercise. I used it the first week and it's been sitting on my dvd shelf since. It's not a bad dvd at all, it was just too easy for me. I didn't feel like I was doing much. I'm using to working up a good sweat so I kinda of felt like I was wasting my time when I could be doing something a little harder. I would definitely recommend it for someone who is just starting out with kick boxing or exercising or maybe to save for days where your not feeling well enough to do a difficult workout.",1368057600,,763,3.9934640522875817
2067340,5,B00028G6F8,"I do several different kickboxing DVDs on a regular basis, and this is one of my favorites.  I've probably done it ten or so times by now- haven't tried the bonus workout yet, but I always do all three of the others together.  It's basic enough that even a beginner should not have difficulty following it, but enough of a challenge that- assuming you put good effort into your moves- it does work up a sweat and feel like I've accomplished a good workout.

I am generally not a fan of cardio workouts- I really prefer strength, as I hate jumping around.  But I've discovered that I love kickboxing.  It's a great cardio workout and a good way to get out some frustration!

One of my biggest pet peeves for any workout DVD is when the instructor does not perform the moves equally on both sides.  This DVD is very balanced when it comes to performing moves on one side and then the other.  It also drives me crazy when there is music playing but the moves are not in time with it- this one is always in time.

This DVD in particular is not the most challenging one that I own, but is great for days when I want to work out but don't feel quite as motivated or have as much time (many of the other kickboxing workouts I do are significantly longer).  It would probably be great for beginners, especially with the option to do only one or two of the ten-minute workouts.  Overall I would recommend it for anyone who loves kickboxing or wants to give it a try!",1366156800,,1457,4.3003663003663
2067341,1,B00028G6F8,I choose this dvd for the time benefit and assumed the alternate verison for beginners would be on point.  I just felt she was a wanna be billy blank and forgot about the person watching.,1364601600,,187,4.3428571428571425
2067342,5,B00028G6F8,I am just starting out with kickboxing.  Easy to follow!  Janis is very encouraging and keeps you motivated throughout the DVD.  Worked up a good sweat while feeling energized when done.  I love the 10 min breakdowns...you can do 1 of 3 up to 3 of 3.  I found that it had an extra blaster workout included!,1363305600,,306,4.298245614035087
2067343,4,B00028G6F8,"I bought this DVD years ago & it is still one of my favorite workout DVDs (and I have a big collection). Easy to follow, but still a good sweat. A good mix of kicks, punches, and combo routines. Nothing crazy like you find in many boot camp DVDs where they seem to throw in every type of exercise known to man. This is a simple, quick workout when you need a fast calorie burn.",1359763200,,377,4.04
2067361,4,B00028G6F8,I purchased this DVD as an addition to a self defense unit that our school teaches. The students seemed to enjoy the workout.,1356739200,,125,4.478260869565218
2067362,3,B00028G6F8,"This quick fix: Total Cardio Kick DVD is okay, nothing to write home about but helpful for a quick work out.",1356566400,,108,4.190476190476191
2067363,5,B00028G6F8,"I purchased this DVD because I had taken a kick boxing class in college, and it was the best workout I have ever done (and I've done plenty of them!)! In my college class, in a period of four months, doing it for an hour twice a week, I dropped 2-3 dress sizes depending on style. So after I had a baby, I was looking for something to help me loose inches but didn't take up a lot of time. As most mom's know, nap times are completely unpredictable and I kept trying to do hour workouts and would end up feeling like I didn't accomplish anything if the workout was interrupted. So I love how I can do just 10 minutes if that's all my son gives me. I feel like I get a full workout, getting toning and cardio in just 10 minutes. And if I can do all three segments, I feel whipped! As you get more comfortable with the workout, the harder you can work. Or if you're super out of shape (or in my case, immediately after a c-section) and it's really difficult, they have someone you can follow who does a modified version of the entire work out. Each segment focuses on one area, arms, legs or core. So if you're like me, my biggest problem areas are my legs and core, so I can alternate my workout to hit those every day if I don't have time to do it all. Sometimes I even do one segment back to back to really concentrate on the area. I highly recommend doing this! The price is right for the workout!",1354233600,,1399,4.090909090909091
2067364,4,B00028G6F8,"I bought this DVD for days I don't want to sit down on my desk all day, thinking I did nothing for my body, but either don't have the time or energy for a die hard workout session. I like the fact that time flies with it, the instruction is pretty good, the music is pleasant and I get a bit of an increase in my heart rate.

This video is for my ""easy cardio days"" as I call it. I try to work out 6 times a week: I do 2 times Jillian Michaels Ripped in 30, 2 times SWAT Weight Loss workout, which are pretty tough bootcamp type workouts. So I want to take a break in between with Quick Fix in the other 2 days.

Don't get me wrong, it is a great workout for beginners; it is just not THE full cardio workout for the intermediate or advanced. Hence, the four stars.",1352851200,2,765,3.8974358974358974
2067365,5,B00028G6F8,"Love the clock countdown! The ladies are strong, their costumes are beautiful, and the workout is pretty good. I work out with it up to twice a week. Very nice attitude on the instructor. The moves are not complicated either. I wasn't as happy with the hip-hop dance version.",1350432000,,275,4.63265306122449
2067366,5,B00028G6F8,"This is a great video for kickboxing beginners. It shows you the moves and once you get them you can push yourself a little bit as you feel more comfortable with the rhythm of the music and the movements. The bonus material it's a great 10 min cardio. Once I got used to the video I started combining it with other home videos like sculpting or pilates and I get the best work out ever. I can do 40, 30, 20 or 10 mins of cardio with this video depending on how tired or motivated I am for the day.",1347580800,,497,3.98
2067367,5,B00028G6F8,"I have several workout DVDs that I rotate thru, and this one by far is my favorite. This DVD is broken down into 3 ten minute segments, and includes a bonus 10 minute workout. The first segment is upper body, the second lower body, third core, and the bonus workout is a combo of the previous 3. The instructor, Janis Saffell, is wonderful. Her cues are wonderful, and she is encouraging without being annoying. She points out clearly at the beginning of each segment that Andrea (who is back and to the right) will be performing easier versions of some of the exercises, such as the scissor jacks.
I have been using this video for a few weeks now, and as somewhat a beginner I found this workout challenging. It is starting to get a little easier, and I think that I will add wrist/ankle weights to increase the intensity as I get more conditioned. All in all I would recommend this to beginners and the more advanced also. It is fun and keeps me motivated!! Happy workout!!",1342396800,,975,4.48314606741573
2067368,4,B00028G6F8,"Love the option to do 10 minutes to 40 minutes. Pretty good workout. Pleased with product, was as advertised. Would order again.",1338768000,,128,4.863636363636363
2067369,5,B00028G6F8,"I hate exercise but LOVE this DVD,,,,,just enuf in 10 minutes or use up to 4-10 minute segments...your choice..each segment is varied enuf to make it interesting. With the countdown clock right there for you to see....I am encouraged to complete the segment. It punches out all the stress of the day and works up your heart rate....these are not size zero women but real fit ladies! Go for it!",1336780800,,393,4.628571428571429
2067370,5,B00028G6F8,"On its own this workout would be too easy for me. However, I combine it with the Weight Loss Cardio Kick workout and I end up with a great 70 minute routine that works my entire body. A few things that caused me to rate this a five:

1.) I love that the Quick Fix video is borken down in three parts. It makes it easier to mix-up my workout so I don't get bored.
2.) The timer in the right hand corner is super. It counts down the minutes, and to me the 10 minutes seems to go by faster. It makes me want to do the next 10 minutes and the next. Love that!
3.) The instructer is great. She takes you through the steps better than a lot of instructors I've worked out to. You defiitely won't get lost or confused.

Overall, the price is perfect if you're looking for something to add to your current workout.",1329955200,,806,4.03125
2067371,5,B00028G6F8,I purchased another DVD and I wasn't happy with it at all. I received this one and it's just what I was looking for. Put on the DVD and hit the bag. Or you can do it without!,1328572800,,174,3.6052631578947367
2067372,3,B00028G6F8,i bought this for a few new combinations but find it is more aerobic KB versus KB  if i new it was that i would not have bought it.,1328313600,,131,3.5172413793103448
2067373,3,B00028G6F8,"This is a nice workout DVD; I liked my Kinect Your Shape much better, but since I no longer have that, this suffices just fine. I do like the fact that they are 10 minutes and I can do however many I have time to do.",1324684800,,216,3.717391304347826
2067374,1,B00028G6F8,"This is a beginner's workout. I found it boring. I used it just the
one time. Thank goodness it was cheap.",1322870400,,106,4.095238095238095
2067375,5,B00028G6F8,"I'm totally new to kickboxing and I have absolutely no rhythm, and this was the perfect introduction to kickboxing for me.  There are 3 workouts on the DVD, one focuses on the arms with punches (jab, cross, hook, upper cut, and combinations), the second focuses on the lower body with kicks (roundhouse, side, front, knee circle, combinations) and the third focuses on your core (all standing, no floor work).  The best part is the bonus workout, with punches, kicks and combinations.  I find it to be most effective when I do all 4 workouts in a row.  I sometimes skip the core workout because I don't think it's all that beneficial, there are other core workouts that are much better.  This DVD is lacking a proper cooldown/stretch, so be sure to take the time to do that.  I definitely recommend this DVD, especially for anyone new to kickboxing, or for those of us who don't like (or can't do) ""dancey"" workouts.",1320883200,,916,4.658385093167702
2067376,5,B00028G6F8,This dvd is great for beginners or a light day workout. I am a intermediate so this dvd is perfect for my in between days of hard core. Janis Saffell was very easy to follow and the cueing I thought was great. A beginner could easily do this dvd 7 days a week. Will have to check out there other dvds,1318636800,,300,3.9344262295081966
2067377,5,B00028G6F8,"I would not say this is her ""Best"" video but it is a good workout for beginners and a quick one for intermediate.  It kept my attention and went by fast.  I use it as a cardio video for an extra 30 minutes after my hard workout.",1317168000,,228,3.8297872340425534
2067378,3,B00028G6F8,"I suppose the workouts on this DVD in and of themselves are decent; the abs workout in particular is my favorite. However, my expectations of ""10 minute workouts"" are relatively high thanks to the series of 10 Minute Solutions DVDs. Sadly, Quick Fix is not quite up to that standard, meaning: it's not intense. When I do a short workout, I want to get as much out of it as possible, and this certainly isn't difficult cardio-wise and doesn't really justify the title of a ""fix"" at all.
That being said, I was already bound to be disappointed (even more so considering that there are only 3 workouts!), but even if the workouts were wonderful I'd have a hard time enjoying them, seeing as the host has NO personality, the ""backup dancers"" are somewhat annoying expression-wise, and the outfits are HORRENDOUS. The entire time I couldn't even get into what little work there was because the attire looked like cheap, overly-sexual poms squad outfits from the 80s. The ""sports bras"" are a joke with v-necks cut so low they may as well be wearing bikini tops, and the bright colors and utterly ugly designs are unflattering.
One last pet peeve: the stretching. A 10 minute workout, no matter what, has no time to waste, so the fact that 2 whole minutes out of that 10 is spent on a 1-minute each warm-up and cool-down (which are both unnecessary, seeing as so little work is done) is ridiculous.
Though I'm being critical, this DVD is still better than some kickboxing workouts out there. And, if you're as desperate as I am for the endorphin rush any form of kickboxing provides, this DVD is still worth the money--as long as the price stays LOW--as long as you don't go into it with high expectations.",1316476800,2,1699,4.629139072847682
2067379,5,B00028G6F8,"This DVD is great. I recommended for who want start in boxing cardio and don't have a good time to go to gym, its easy to follow and you will feel this exercise burn fat.",1315872000,,170,3.8857142857142857
2067380,5,B00028G6F8,This video was great for me because I work full-time and I really don't have a lot time to work out. The quick 10 minute work outs make you sweat and are challenging enough that you feel like you did something. I haven't been able to do the whole 30 minutes yet. I have only been able to do 20 minutes at one time. But already my body feels toned and firmer.,1303084800,,358,3.986111111111111
2067403,5,B00028G6F8,"I've had this DVD for years and no matter what health i'm in, it's easy to get into and doesn't overwhelm you with overly complicated moves. Recently i'd been dealing with a medical problem that made me stop pretty much all physical activity outside of my job. Now that the medical problem has lessened, i'm retraining starting with this video all over again. A great instructor, good music, and easy to follow.

There's 30 minutes divided into 10 minutes segments with an additional power training one optional for anybody.

It's never let me down : D",1296950400,,552,4.739583333333333

Even if you are short on time, one 10 minute segment will feel like you put in a 20-30 min effort.  Each segment starts with a brief warmup before jumping into the workout and finishes with a brief cooldown.  The instructor's cuing is great and the camera doesn't just focus on her but on all three women so you can see their form as well as the modifications.  I would like it if you could select chapters in the order in which you want to do them so you could change it up some but other than that small thing I highly recommend this workout.  You will definetely sweat and burn calories no matter your fitness level.",1296691200,,729,4.141843971631205

They all really make you sweat fast, and get you really pumped up.

Each segment goes fast.  I was pretty new to kickboxing, so there were times when I was not sure if my form was correct, but she and the two women who exercise behind her seem to execute great form, which made me feel more confident when I followed them.

So you won't get injured imitating her.  She knows what she is doing.  She goes just slow enough so that you can pick up the routine but not so slow you don't get your sweat on.

There is, however, one participant who does provide modified moves for the beginner. The workout consist of 4 10-minute intervals, each focusing on a different area of the body - arms, legs, abs, and a final total body combo bonus.  Janis is an excellent instructor and her form, along with the other two participants, is perfect.  If a quick cardio workout is what you are looking for, this program delivers.  I thoroughly enjoy this workout every time I do it and I never find it boring.

That said, I can't understand why brand new copies are being sold at such a ridiculously high price.  I know I didn't pay that much for mine.  If you really want to purchase this workout, might I suggest you check out the Quick Fix Total Cardio Mix - The Complete Cardio Workout System, which includes this work out along with the Quick Fix Cardio Hip-Hop Workout in a program you can mix and match.

Janis Saffell's three 10-minute workout sessions (and fourth 'bonus' session) are so practical for daily and CONTINUOUS use - I am actually able to do this workout about 3-5 days a week on average!  Thanks to this DVD, I finally have been able to incorporate exercise as a daily habit!  As a graduate student who also works full-time and is always exhausted, that's saying a lot!!!

Lately, I find myself doing this video in the mornings, before heading to work which has been great. The sessions seem to go by fast, but I'm always dripping sweat by the end! Saffell doesn't overdo the reps while at the same time she does them enough for you to feel the burn - and she keeps it interesting (at least, I think so)!

I actually find myself ENJOYING many of her workout routines! They feel GOOD and are challenging (for the average person - and if you need more, do the bonus section too and/or add weights), rather than making you feel miserable and wishing it was over already! Also, I learned that over time, as my muscles continued to develop, I could feel them working more and more - so, if at first you think it's not working, it may be because you don't have those muscle yet!  So, just keep pushing yourself and before you know it, you'll be able to actually feel those muscles she's talking about!!!

Furthermore, Saffell and the two ladies with her in this video have the amazingly rare ability to keep you motivated without being annoying! I also like that you are always on your feet, and don't have to lay down or use additional equipment (i.e. chairs, benches, etc)!",1218672000,2,1665,4.570469798657718

In martial arts, we concentrate on forms and self-defense techniques, and I've noticed that, in sparring, it's a combination of aerobic stamina as well as how to ""chain"" your attack. I did try to supplement my karate sessions with additional sessions of kickboxing, but the hour-long workouts were simply draining. I'm also fifty-six. I've found that these ten-minute sessions can be an excellent supplement to the karate practice I do outside the dojang. Right now, I'm concentrating on the first and third workouts; i.e., the boxing and ab segments. I already do a light ab workout, but this is tightening the abs in a standing position through boxing moves. There's also footwork, which is a necessity in sparring. A fourth ten-minute bonus workout is accessible through the main menu, so I have the third (kicks) and fourth (all-around) ten-minutes workouts to look forward to. I like that I can go at my own speed, improvise (as one of the assistants does while Ms. Saffell and another assistant do strict form), and even choose which workout(s) I will do on a particular day. There are a number of styles of karate, and my style, Soo Bahk Do, emphasizes the hands as well as the feet for self-defense. A really good choice DVD to have as a supplement to at-home karate practice.",1217808000,,1455,5.385964912280702

There are 3 10- minute cardio/ lite toning workouts: one concentrating on the core, another for legs and hips, and another for arms. It also includes a 4th bonus 10- minute cardio kickboxing routine. You can do the whole DVD or choose your own combo.

This DVD is good for everyone. They are sure to include an instructor who demonstrates easier versions of the exercises throughout the workouts.

Once I did the routines a few times, I was ready to make it more challenging for myself.  I now do the routines with my weighted gloves and ankle weights for extra resistance.  I also double- time some of the punching drills.  The routines keep my heart-rate up without exhausting me.  That leaves me feeling ready to do some more intense toning with my other DVDs.

One of my favorite Toning DVDs:

Another fun Kickboxing Workout DVD:

It's fun and keeps your heart- rate steady.  Good sweating without over- exertion.

If you are new to working out, be prepared for some serious sweating, and if you are new to kickboxing, no worries, Janis goes slow enough to introduce each new move... you'll get it!  The only problem I have with her routines are the warm-ups:  they're too fast to provide any real muscle warming-up.  I highly recommend stretching on your own (yoga stretching works best for me), before the workouts begin; that way, soreness will be decreased, and you'll less likely pull muscles, etc.  Aside from the silly ""warm-up"" and cool-down moves, the rest is a ""blast"".

I work 12-hours shifts in an ER, so I get up early (4 a.m.) and have only about 20 minutes for a workout on workdays. I usually do upper body every day, and then do either lower body or core. On days when I get up too late for 20 minutes, I do the kickbox blast segment only -- that is an intense 10 minutes! The only thing I'd recommend is stretching/warming up a bit prior to starting the workout -- there is a little warm-up included, but it's usually not enough for me when I've just rolled out of bed. :) I've since purchased a few of Janis' DVDs, and they're all great -- I like ""Brand New Butt"" and ""Strike Zone,"" but they're not broken up into segments; I usually reserve those for my days off when I'm not under time constraints.

What is great about it, is it has a count down clock in the corner. The other issue I have with this video is the replacement of one of her back-up crew. Her videos have always featured very real people and in this one she has one of her old companions but the other girl is a prettier more toned girl then I have seen in her own videos.

Janis Saffell is fantastic - she gives the appropriate cues and encouragement.  I have been able to increase the intensity of my workouts as my fitness level has increased by doing more segments or working harder (i.e. kicking higher, punching harder).  No special equipment is needed.  This is a must-have for beginners looking for a challenge or moderate-level fitness buffs looking for a video to ""grow"" with them!",1170115200,3,524,5.046511627906977
2067553,4,B00028G6F8,"I love work-out DVDs where I can pick and choose different segments because most days, I don't have time to dedicate myself to a full hour of exercise. This one is a great video to have because you don't need a lot of time, or a lot of room.

The first time I did this work-out, I didn't think it did anything for me. I barely broke a sweat and I was only a little out of breath. However, after showering and relaxing for a little bit afterward, I really felt the areas that I worked: arms, stomach and thighs. I was impressed.

I also like Janis as an instructor. She's not cheesy, or cheerleader-y at all, but she's enthusiastic enough to keep you motivated. The time clock on the bottom of the screen helps, too.

The only complaint I have about this work-out is that after a while, it isn't as challenging. But if you add 1 or 2 pound weights to your ankles or legs (depending on which area you're working), you'll definitely work up a sweat!

2067555,5,B00028G6F8,"I really don't enjoy exercising, let me just preface my review with that.  I like the way that I feel afterwards, and how my body looks when I am working on it, but I am not a fitness buff by any stretch of the mind.  This video made the time go by SO quickly!!  It is broken into 3 segments but if you select ""play routine"" or something on the main menu it just shuffles through the 3 sections without a break at all.  What I really liked about it was that there is a countdown timer in the bottom right hand corner that counts down the minutes.  I realize that I have a 30 minute workout to do, but the timer makes me feel like I never have more than 9 more minutes to go which encourages me to really push myself more than I would if it wasn't there.  I just say to myself that no matter how hard it is I can for sure push through another minute or two.  The instructor also does this thing where she does each move a couple of times slowly and then ""brings it up to tempo"".  Admittedly, I am not the world's most coordinated person and this made me be able to get the form down perfectly and really concentrate on doing the exercise correctly so I could get strength results from the video instead of just flailing around and just getting cardio.  I actually have to do the modifications on some sections during the video, which I have never needed to do on any other video.  Even though I feel like I am working past my capacity during the tape I wake up the next day feeling really tight and lean, especially in my core section, instead of in pain.  This is a great workout for your obliques, and none of it is done on the ground which I love.  The instructor is upbeat without being annoying, and has abs that make you want to keep exercising!  Overall, a great workout that is fun to do and great for your core.",1167264000,3,1819,4.1335227272727275

I never get sick of putting on this DVD because I can always rotate between the 4 workouts (I usually do 2-3 workouts at a time).  There isn't a real warm-up or cool-down, which is probably the only small negative, but I just do it on my own.

There are 4, 10 minute workouts.  One for lower body, one for abs, one for upper body and the bonus workout is sort of like a combination of all three only more intense.

During each segment one of the instructors shows you how to do a less intense version of the workouts if you're a beginner.  If you're just starting out with exercise, maybe only do one segment , following the modified, easier version.  Then build your way up to intermediate being able to do all 40 minutes, but following the easier instructor.  Once at advanced, do the 40 minutes the harder way.  I suppose that if you're really advanced you might want to strap on some ankle and wrist weights, and maybe repeat the first and last workout so you get a whole hour long workout.

I do this workout for my cardio, and then the next day I do the 10 minute solutions: Pilates video for my strength training and flexibility.  It's important to do both cardio and strength training so that you don't lose muscle mass along with the fat.",1149465600,25,1251,4.466960352422907

Janice is really good, calm, cues well, doesnt talk a lot, and is not overly inspiring.  She clearly points out the person who will be doing alternative/low impact moves and then continues on.  There is nothing complicated about the moves and they are very easy to learn - no hard choreography either.  I use this w/ a compliment of other videos and it continues to be one I enjoy to return to.

There are 3 segments each focusing on a different section: core, upper and lower body.  The bonus segment is a high impact/faster segment combining all elements.

My abs are strong, the muscles in my thighs have toned considerably and my cardio endurance has really improved. People are commenting on how different I look and I feel great.

They're not as intense as in the Billy Blanks Boot Camp series, though...which is fine with me, because I think Janis demonstrates much better form and cueing.

The upper body and core workouts aren't particularly heart pumping, but ""exaggerating"" your moves can help you ramp up the intensity.  I have yet to try the bonus workout; but that's on the agenda for tomorrow.  Overall, I think this is a great introductory kickboxing DVD and a solid toning workout for all levels.

The minus is that it can be a bit easy if you exercise fairly regularly.  I added hand and ankle weights to it, and it really made a difference, although if you do this, proceed with caution as cardio with weights can be a dangerous combo.  What I like is there's no wasting time with it.  If you are a beginner and need to learn form, go with Keli Roberts 10 Minute Solution Kickbox Boot Camp or Kathy Smith's Kickboxing.

2067593,4,B00028G6F8,"Janis Saffell is a very effective instructor. She cues from your point of view (ie left is your left, not hers) and when she introduces a new move it's usually done slow first for a few repetitions so you can get used to it and get the form right before speeding it up.

This DVD has 3 ten minute segments and an extra ""Bonus"" workout.

The first 10 minute segment focuses on your upper body with mostly punches. The second 10 minute segment is mostly lower body, with a lot of kicks and squats. The third 10 minute segment focuses on abs, with lots of core movements and upright sit-up like movements. The bonus 10 minutes is straight through cardio with kicks and punches and integrates many of the moves learned in the first 3 sections.

The QuickFix workouts have a 10 minute timer on the lower right corner of the screen so you can see how much time is left in the section. It's very motivating and the time goes by quickly.

Janis has 2 other women doing this video with her and Andrea (back, right) does a modification for beginners. Unfortunately, Janis does not usually mention ways for more advanced people to get a better workout, and that is one reason why it gets only 4/5 stars.

The music is also not very motivating (sometimes it sounds like Asian music) and the outfits are at times distracting. Overall, I didn't feel like this took away from the workout experience, but some may.

She is cheerful and fun, yet not ""perky"". She is not boring at all ! (which is my ultimate goal in a video, not to be bored)

I really like listening to her cueing.

This work-out is great because it is in 3 different 10 minute sessions, with a counter for each session. One for arms, one for legs and one for standing core.

  I often pop in the video planning on doing just one, but then I end up doing all 3! I hope there will be more videos out by quick fix soon!

  For added resistance I do this work-out using the Billy Blanks tae bo resistance bands that I got with his infomercial set, his videos were not my taste, but I liked the bands and decided to  try this video with the bands. It is a GREAT WORKOUT.

My friend and I meet to do videos together 3x a week, and she does this video without the bands and still loves it! It is our favorite video. Easy to finish, and the counter is aweseome ! I wish all exercise videos would have a counter!

2067599,4,B00028G6F8,"After trying out a large number of workout DVDs, I've decided that I'm most likely to do a 20 to 40-minute routine.  A workout within that time period hits the exercise sweet spot for me, especially when I've had a long day (or I know tomorrow will be).  That was the situation when I did ""QuickFix - Total Cardio Kick,"" and I wasn't disappointed.

This DVD includes four ten-minute workouts.  One focuses on the upper body, one on the lower, and one centers on the body's ""core"" (another name for the trunk/torso).  The fourth is a bonus workout, and it's an all-around routine that includes two sets of pushups.  Each has the QuickFix timer in the bottom right corner, a feature that I find useful.  It's about the size of those channel logos on cable or satellite TV stations, and looks kind of like this: :QF10.  The numeral counts down by minutes.  It goes to :QF9 when nine minutes are left, and so on until the end of the segment.  A little minute hand circumnavigates the Q as well.  I liked that, since it's a concrete reminder that time isn't standing still.

The instructor, Janis Saffell, is a good caller, and delivers her (mostly) clear commands in a motivating manner.  She has two assistants; the one on her left does easier modifications.  As for the workouts, all of them are well done and will get your heart pumping.  They can be modified based on your fitness level, like when I added 3-pound neoprene-coated weights to the upper body workout for an added challenge.  I also appreciated the monotony-breaking variety of exercises.  For example, three types of kicks were utilized in various combinations: front, side, and round (I also modified a knee circle into a crescent kick).

As with other DVDs featuring time-segmented workouts, the transitions are brutally efficient, which may intimidate beginners.  Also, stretching time and warmup/cooldown are over quickly.  If you value these workout aspects, you'll have to do them on your own or add another DVD.  Even so, ""QuickFix - Total Cardio Kick"" is a fine addition to your home exercise routine.  Other kickboxing and martial arts-related workout DVDs I've enjoyed are the ""10-minute Solution - Kickbox Bootcamp,"" and ""Budokon for Beginners"" by Cameron Shayne.",1131667200,5,2238,4.880636604774536

In the beginning-- I thought I was going to have to resell this dvd -- I didn't feel like I was getting anything out of it.  By the end-- I wasn't out of breath, but I was warm. It gets your heart going :-)

2067607,4,B00028G6F8,"I've had my eye on this DVD for quite awhile now; I really enjoy kickboxing, but I was looking for a video that would help me squeeze in a short cardio workout when I didn't have time for a longer kickboxing session.  This DVD fits the bill perfectly:  with the bonus workout, you get 4 10-minute routines which work well alone or combined for an even more complete workout.

The first routine, Focused Upper Body, concentrates on punches.  Instructor Janis Saffell starts slowly as she introduces each move, but the pace quickly picks up, and by the end of this segment, you'll be doing some double-time moves as well as some simple but fun punch combinations.  The second routine, Focused Lower Body, is just the opposite in that it is all kicks, no punches.  The kicks included in this segment are the front kick, the side kick, the roundhouse kick, and hip circles, a preparation for the hook kick (which she does not actually do).  Again, the pace increases over time, and you end with basic combination moves.  Workout #3 is called Cardio Kickbox Core, and it focuses on standing toning moves for the abdominal and back area.  On the one hand, I was a little disappointed that this segment moves too slowly to really be cardio, but on the other, I thought it was an excellent core toning workout, with plenty of standing crunches, twists, and knee lifts.  The Bonus routine combines all of the above--a mix of punches, kicks, and twists which provide you with an excellent cardio workout.

Janis Saffell is a great instructor:  her movements are clear and her form is always precise.  She cues well, although I thought she spent a little too much time doing the moves at a slower pace --I was ready to pick it up after only 1-2 slow reps.  She and the two background exercisers all have wonderfully strong, toned physiques.  One of the background exercisers shows low-impact modifications for the few high impact moves (eg, occasional jumping jacks).  Although I believe that this video is marketed to beginners, I think it would be more appropriate for those who have at least a little prior experience with kickboxing, as little time is spent explaining proper form.  I think that advanced beginners and intermediates will thoroughly enjoy these workouts, and overall, I give the DVD 4 1/2 stars.",1120521600,87,2304,4.763224181360202

It's not the most challenging workout, but that's fine -- this is perfect for days that warrant lighter intensity.",1119657600,4,374,4.621212121212121
2067609,5,B00028G6F8,"If your not familiar with kickboxing, this video is a great starter. Janis explains each move very carefully and includes many things in each workout that targets all the important areas of your body. I usually do all three segments plus the bonus blast which is also great. You can only get that on the dvd though. I do step aeorbics to as well as other some dance workouts but this is my all time favorite.",1115596800,6,408,4.381578947368421
2067610,3,B00028G6F8,"The reason that I only gave this 3 stars is because, that some of the moves are hard to catch on to. I think if you don't have carpet in your living room or where ever you do this video it might be easier. Once you do this video a couple times you do get the hang of it. I only have problems with a small part of the ab workout part. The part where you step-uppercut, step-sidepunch or something like that. Its ok when they do it slow but when they speed it up I just cant do it. But like I said I do think its the whole carpet issue. This is a good video if you are new to kickboxing like I am.",1114387200,4,595,3.7301587301587302
2067611,5,B00028G6F8,"it's short but effective...the music is pleasant and the attitude and voice of janis saffel is entertaining...l have been using this method for a month, 3 times per week and l really feel the results...so l play the DVD twice per session and for added benefit, l strap on weights on my legs and hands...",1112400000,3,303,4.527272727272727
2067612,5,B00028G6F8,I just started using this dvd with my Core Secrets dvd. They seem to work well with each other. I love this dvd because they break it down but don't go to slow. Your heart rate stays up and it is so much fun. I highly recommend this dvd. The instructor is very easy to follow and understand and usually I have a problem following instructors but not this one. I cant wait to do use this dvd tomorrow. I have only done one routine so far but I have skimmed through the other ones and it looks great.,1110326400,4,498,4.040404040404041
2067626,5,B00028G6F8,"I really like this video, it is divided into 4 parts, you can do any or all of them depending on how much time you have. The first is upper body with assorted punches, jabs, crosses, hooks and upper cuts. The lower body section has some squats, front and side kicks, knees, etc. The core section has a different variety of moves to work your abs, crunches, knees raises, etc.  There is a 10 minute bonus blast that is a shorter version of the 3 other sections. I would rate this video as intermediate, though beginners could use it too. Advanced people most likely would not find it challenging.

This workout is led by Janis Saffell who has led other kickboxing videos, she does a great job in this one. She is joined by 2 other exercisers, one who shows beginner modifications. They have very inspiring figures and execute great form. Good music in this workout also, for those who like kickboxing this is a good video for your collection.",1110067200,11,941,4.529411764705882
2067627,4,B00028G6F8,"This is a good quick kickboxing workout, espcially if you add wrist and ankle weights. It's good for beginners but probably not challenging enough for advanced people. It's still a good work out and the best workout is the 10-minute bonus total body workout-it really gets your heart pumping. Although the host looks like Barbie, her back-up girls are muscular and ripped (keeps you motivate to look like them!!)",1109289600,4,412,4.9855072463768115
2067628,5,B00028G6F8,"after all those Billy Blanks moves, it was nice to find a lower intensity workout...although, if it's too slow you can work at your own pace and still use the moves laid out in the video...as a cardio kick instructor myself, i was really impressed with all the modifications and the easy transitions...it can be tough to get beginners into a new routine feeling confident in their abilities...i think this video does an excellent job...it's a fantastic instuctional tool...i learned a lot!  and do the workout on lower energy days at home",1105747200,12,538,4.8478260869565215
2067629,5,B00028G6F8,"I am an intermediate level exerciser who usually has trouble with kickboxing.  This dvd is great, and Janis Saffell does a great job of cueing and teaching the upcoming moves in a halftime tempo before performing them full speed.",1104192000,4,229,4.871794871794871
2067630,5,B00028G6F8,"I am health nut and workout freak. I love this workout video. I own probably over 15 workout videos, since I bought this one over 2 months ago, I primarly workout to this one. By the end of the workout I work up a good sweat. The best thing about this video is the instructor she is not too cheesy and annoying. The quick fix work out clock keeps you motivatied by allowing you to see how much time you have left. The music is good too. You will see results with time. I have noticed more leg definition in my legs since I started this routine.",1103673600,4,544,4.093457943925234
2067631,4,B00028G6F8,"I almost always start my workout with one of these segments.  I generally only have time for 20 min a day, and these workouts make me feel like I used the time effectively.  I like to follow up with another segment from quickfix total mix:  abs, buns, or arms/legs.  Great for people like me who aren't hardcore workout enthusiasts, but like to counter a chocolate addiction with moderate exercise.  If you are a trained kickboxer this dvd probably isn't for you, but if you just want to get some cardio in a fun and different way you should check out Cardio Kick.",1099872000,3,564,4.490196078431373
2067632,5,B00028G6F8,"I bought this DVD based on reviews & I was hooked from day one! Each 10 minute workout will get your heart pumping, I personally like to do all 3 workouts and the bonus workout for a 40 minute cardio workout.  After doing this for 3 weeks before I went on vacation, I began to see a difference in my legs and my abs.  I hope Janis will release another Quick Fix Total Cardio Kick because this is so much better than Tae-Bo and Kathy Smith Kickboxing workout! This really is easy to follow & you will definitely feel your muscles working.",1097798400,4,537,4.254901960784314
2067633,5,B00028G6F8,"I was a bit leary at first since each segment is only 10 min. but after doing each segment (arms, lower body, abs), I was sweating up a storm & convinced that this was a great total body workout!  It displays a countdown time at the bottom of the screen!  I love this DVD, I highly recommend this one!  You will definitely get the Cardio/toning workout you've been searching for!",1094256000,3,379,4.385714285714286
2067634,5,B00028G6F8,"i have worked out with janis Saffell for a long time and i think she is one of the best instructors out there, she let's you know way ahead of time what she's going to do and she keeps an even count of reps on both sides unlike tae-bo, if you are having trouble keeping up with this program than maybe you should stick with walking because this doesn't even tap into what janis can do .",1090368000,2,386,4.025974025974026
2067635,4,B00028G6F8,"Like the other Quick Fix workouts, I love this DVD. It combines cardio with toning so if you are able to do all 4 segments, you get a great total body workout including the cardio. The moves are not difficult which lends to a better cardio effect. I like to do 2 or 3 segments and combine it with the Arm and Leg workout plus one of the Ab segments from the Quick Fix Total Mix DVD for an excellent total body workout.",1089504000,4,418,4.048192771084337
