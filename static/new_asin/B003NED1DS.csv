4157236,5,B003NED1DS,"Among the countless live performances from YES, there are 2 that stands out. Keys to Ascension and ABWH an evening of YES music. Sadly Keys was spoiled by stupid video effects, or it might have been the definitive YES performance. ABWH however, captures almost perfectly the dynamic experience of their show. It's true that one might miss the bass sound and backing vocals of Chris Squire, but his replacement does a brilliant job. And then we got Bill Bruford back on the drums. Not that Alan White is a bad drummer, but when you hear Bills drums on Close to the edge, Long distance and Starship Trooper, It's perfectly clear that he's sorely missed. What you get here are probably the best live versions ever of Close to the Edge, All good People and Starship Trooper, although the Keys version of Trooper comes very close. So if you're a YES fan, you gotta have this !!",1390608000,11,872,4.596153846153846

8400940,5,B003NED1DS,"Excellent, with one exception. Its clearly not shot in HD but very watchable, theres only a couple of places where you wish the quality was better. I bought this because Bill Bruford was playing with most of the original band. Unfortunately Chris Squire was missing. That being said, for any Yes fan its a must.",1520121600,,311,4.672727272727273
8400941,5,B003NED1DS,As I enjoyed this in the comfort of my home it brought back memories of a great concert I saw nearly 30 years ago. I mention to my wife that the concert looks like an identical venue; she then pulled out our tickets for this show ,1495756800,,230,4.0

8400946,5,B003NED1DS,"Fantastic compilation of Yes classics and original ABW&H songs, by a band who looks as if they were enjoying themselves onstage. Jon Anderson's majestic voice compliments the stirring guitar work of Steve Howe and Rick Wakeman's magical keyboards. Loved the beginning of the show which features solo performances of Jon, Steve & Rick, before launching into the groups work.
Excellent sound & production.",1448236800,,403,5.412698412698413

8400948,5,B003NED1DS,"I absolutely love this concert DVD. Very tight musicianship and Jon Anderson has never been more happy and exuberant onstage, his vocals show as well very clear and strong. Steve Howe and Rick Wakeman are always in top form but for me it was so great to see Bill Bruford back together playing with these guy's. I really wish Chris Squire was involved but Jeff Berlin does a very nice job on the bass filling in for Tony Levin who took ill when the concert was to be filmed. I just wish I had been there.",1415404800,3,503,4.25
