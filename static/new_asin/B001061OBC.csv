8237260,5,B001061OBC,"While I thoroughly enjoyed Seasons 1 and 2 of The Octopus (La Piovra), I felt that Season 3, though still entertaining, lacked credibility and originality. Fortunately, in Season 4, the series redeems itself with a complex central plot and plenty of action, intrigues, drama, suspense and twists and turns to keep viewers engaged over all six episodes.  Our friend Corrado Cattani is back as determined as ever to fight the Mafia.  Sadly, his lover from Season 3, Giulia Antinari, has died in a boat accident (the background to this is not fully explained).  Still mourning her loss, Corrado lives a solitary and reclusive life (only a handful of close friends know where he lives), wary of further emotional attachment, as most of those he's loved in the past are now dead.  He makes some new friends in Season 4, however, including Judge Silvia Conti and Inspector Trevi, newly graduated from the police academy.  In Season 4, each episode is longer than in earlier seasons, at around 1 hour 40 minutes each.

The season revolves around Tano Carridi, who at the end of Season 3 was the personal assistant of the Mafia-linked banker Nicola Antinari but had moved up the ranks of the Mafia, having received the blessing of the Mafia boss ""Il Puparo"".  He's now the chairman of the Antinari Bank.  A sinister and cunning character, yet one with a sad and lonely past, Carridi masterminds a Mafia plot to take over one of Italy's largest finance companies, ""International Securities"".

Carridi's problem is that the chairman of International Securities, Rasi, is an honest man, and doesn't want to sell his share of the company to Carridi, whom Rasi knows is in the Mafia.  To force him to sell, Carridi uncovers a dark secret from Rasi's past and uses it to blackmail him into selling.  Also, Carridi insists on marrying Rasi's beautiful 20 year old daughter Ester, to seal the ""deal"", and Rasi, being blackmailed, is unable to object. Ester agrees to the sham marriage for her father's sake, but actually detests Carridi, and secretly hopes to use her position as his wife to destroy him from within.

Alongside this storyline, is another involving Mafia-linked casino owner Antonio Tindari. At a party one night, Tindari is shot dead by a mysterious man who turns up out of the blue, Salvatore Frolo.  When arrested for the murder, Frolo doesn't respond to police questioning, but it turns out Frolo was involved with Tindari as part of the Mafia in the past but had a falling-out with them after being accused of betraying the clan.  The Mafia exacted a horrific revenge on Frolo by having his wife and baby daughter killed in a staged car ""accident"".  Some 20 years later, Frolo comes back to get revenge on Tindari, whom Frolo blames for the murder.  However, Corrado is not convinced the story is as simple as that, and, along with Silva Conti, begins a search for the truth - leading to an intriguing twist in the plot.

We're also introduced to another evil Mafia figure - a shady character known as Espinosa, who colludes with Carridi in an illegal operation to store nuclear waste on an island near Sicily.

Season 4 explores the internal power struggles within the Mafia, particularly those between the older clan leaders who came to power in the 50s and 60s and were more locally focused, compared with an ambitious younger generation of Mafioso emerging in the 80s who saw a broader international and financial-political role for the organisation.  Although criminals, the older Mafia types had a semblance of a code of conduct, for example, killing of women and children was taboo. The newer generation in contrast generally had less restraint.  Far more dangerous and ruthless, they didn't let any old-fashioned sense of honour get in the way of their criminal schemes.",1320537600,6,3783,4.87207488299532
8237261,5,B001061OBC,"I assume you already have watched Series 1-3.  Since Amazon does not give the summary for Series 4, here it is:

""In Series 4, Police Inspector Corrado Cattani finds himself up against the ruthless Tano Carridi, who with the help of a corrupt senator plans to take control of a major international conglomerate.  Cattani joins forces with Judge Silvia Conti in a desperate attempt to foil the Mafia takeover, but danger lurks around every corner.  This time, will Cattani go to far?""

Warning:  Compared with Series 1 and 2, there is a moderate increase in sex and violence in Series 3 and 4.  In Series 1 and 2 you just got to see the woman buttoning her blouse ""afterwards""; now you get half a rape scene (top half only) and some breasts.  The bad guys also use more bullets to kill, with the same result.",1314230400,,807,4.517241379310345
8237262,5,B001061OBC,"""La Piovra (The Octopus)"" is an excellent series, an enormous cult favorite in Europe, that's taken far too long to reach American audiences-somewhat surprisingly, given the popularity of 'The Godfather' films, ""The Sopranos"", and Americans' seemingly limitless interest in all things Mafia. In fact, one could easily class La Piovra as a sort of taking up where ""The Godfather"" saga leaves off, with the story of Mafia depredation being brought into the present era, and its' tale of corruption extending from the small island of Sicily into the banks and boardrooms of international global finance and the loftiest seats of government power.

The original 4-part arc (each story arc running approximately 5 to 6 episodes each, with the exception of series 8, 9 and 10) of Piovra concerns the exploits of Corrado Caittani, an honest and moral policeman who accepts a transfer to a post in Sicily, where he inevitably becomes embroiled in the ongoing battle of the law against a tenacious and fierce criminal underworld. It takes no time at all before Corrado's life is shattered by events triggered from his pursuit of justice, a quest that he will become all the more obsessed with after horrible tragedy strikes his home in the form of a particularly hideous Mafia retribution carried out against his young daughter.

Any newcomer to the series would be well advised to watch Series One and Two back-to-back, as the very complex storyline interweaves tightly between the initial two arcs. Series Three and Four should probably also be watched together, though the two can more easily stand alone as self-contained storylines. There is some carryover of certain characters' stories from Part Three into Part Four (most notably that of the sinister Tano Carridi, a modest functionary to the Mafia, who rises through the patronage of a wealthy banker, and his own wiles to a position of formidable power, becoming Corrado's most implacable enemy in the process), but enough of these backstories are given expository space in Series Four to make them intelligible to those who watch only this part.

The characterization of Corrado is quite a piece of work, spanning nearly a decade; Italian audiences followed the story eagerly, in the process making Corrado and the man who plays him (the superb Michele Placido) something of a modern-day folk hero, as he works tirelessly to save those whom he loves from the moral squalor and violent evil that always threatens to engulf them. No less worthy of mention is the absolutely marvelous Remo Girone as Tano--Girone's portrayal of the character is dimensional to an almost literary degree, going far beyond a stock 'bad guy' performance to the potent portrayal of a damaged man whose lust for power is undone by his own tragic flaws. With only the most minimal gestures, Girone evokes a presence that's at once both menacing and oddly haunting.

""La Piovra"" Series 1-4 was originally meant to be the whole story in its' entirety, ending with the departure of Corrado from the scene. The series was by then so wildly popular throughout Europe however, that its creators decided to carry on; eventually the series would run for over eighteen years, and span 10 story arcs. Although the series' subsequent installments vary in quality, overall they're still worthy of attention, most particularly series 5-6, in which Girone continues to play a significant role as Tano's story unfolds after his downfall at the climax of Series 4. Also worthy of note is Series 8 (a lush, beautifully filmed period piece that I believe was originally a theatrical release in Italy), which traces Tano's story back to his desperately poor youth in Sicily, the beginnings of his rise in the world, and also the first stirrings of the Mafia's reach for power on the Italian mainland and beyond. Series 10 is also worthy of note, as it brings back into the picture the figure of the ageing and bereft Tano, who meets his appointment with destiny at last.

It's not possible to do full justice to the breadth and scope of this series in a brief review. Suffice it to say there's never been anything quite like it on American television, and probably never will be. I can only say that if you make the decision to start watching ""La Piovra"", then beware--you will quite likely find yourself enmeshed in its tentacles and hopelessly hooked very early on.",1250208000,2,4374,4.961800818553888
