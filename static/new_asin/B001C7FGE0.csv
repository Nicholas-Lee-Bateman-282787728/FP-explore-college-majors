8286218,5,B001C7FGE0,"My son, Jason, is an active 6 year old boy. He loves watching airplanes fly and The Yellow Airplane is one of his favorite videos. The Yellow Airplane's filming is from the child's point of view.  Jason really likes that when he's watching The Yellow Airplane, he feels like he is in the airplane flying!  I especially like the fact that the video is very soothing and has a calming influence on him.",1222300800,2,400,4.465753424657534
