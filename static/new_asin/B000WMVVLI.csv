""How to Dance with Two Left Feet"" takes the fear out of learning to dance and makes it what it should be - FUN!  It is easy to follow and the content and order of its three disc set is convenient to watch in every sense.  This lesson plan will make you comfortable on the dance floor and able to adapt to different music, styles and/or partners.  And the best thing is you can learn all of this in the convenience of your own home, at your own pace!  Buying this video is a gift to you and to others.  After you learn to dance with it and show off your moves, you'll be giving other people fun experiences too!  Real World Dancing for Real World People!  I love it!",1194134400,9,735,4.0979020979020975

8224278,3,B000WMVVLI,The first DVD is really boring; not much teaching at all.  The third disc is OK but I cannot recommend the set for the price.,1346889600,,125,4.0
8224279,1,B000WMVVLI,"If it is marketed as a 3 DVD ""boxed set"", you would expect to get 3 DVD's worth of content.  But not so with this product.  The entire 3 DVD's could be put on one DVD.  Also, the first DVD, with the exception of a very brief chapter on ""What not to do"" is useless and can be skipped over entirely.  This first DVD is only about 10 minutes long!!!  Worse, the actual instruction of dance on the entire set is quite brief (I did not waste my time timing this, but it is probably on the order of 15-20 minutes).

Spreading it onto 3 DVD's is a SCAM to get you to pay more.  I have zero tolerance for deception so I am giving this a one star review.  But, if it were based on the actual dance instruction, I would also give it a single star - it basically tells you how to hold your partner, how to avoid stepping on feet, and how to ""lead"" and ""follow"".  That might be enough to avoid making a complete fool of yourself, but it is not dance instruction.  And lastly, they don't use models or professional dancers, so it is really painful to look at these people (I'm sorry - it does matter).

Worst of all, I believe that the 5-star reviews of this product were faked by the seller.  For all the 5-star reviewers, this is the only product they reviewed.  This, along with their ""gushing"" over the product w/o not a single negative is most suspicious, especially given the product is so bad.  They were all faked in my opinion.",1300838400,25,1423,4.1838235294117645
8224280,5,B000WMVVLI,I highly recommend this dvd to anyone learning to dance.  Its not so scary after all!!  This dvd is very understandable for anyone young and old wanting to learn to dance.,1290988800,2,171,4.483870967741935
8224281,5,B000WMVVLI,"This video covers all the bases! The instructor makes you relaxed and helps you get over all the normal hang-ups. You learn basic techniques that are easy to follow without years of practice to enjoy. The problem with most instruction is once you stop you lose a lot of what you have learned. With this video you can always go back for a refresher! Plus, you're not intimidated by the instructor or other students! I was most impressed with learning the hand signals that helped communicate the next move I wanted from my partner. I really was skeptical but found this fun video well worth the investment in time and money!",1258588800,6,623,4.621621621621622
8224282,5,B000WMVVLI,"This dvd really showed me the path on how to dance to any kind of music. It was entertaining, explained the methods easily and was not boring.

I cannot thank Chuck Reed enough for guiding me on the path to having fun dancing. It took away my fears and anxieties of getting on the dance floor.

Chuck's method of learning how to dance is very easy to pick up and put into practical use especially for a novice like myself.",1258502400,6,422,4.2625
8224283,5,B000WMVVLI,"My husband and I tried to take lessons from the dance studio, we felt so awkward, and uncomfortable we quit... disappointed.
We ordered two other dancing DVDs, and it was more of the same old stuff.  We were disappointed again. We never did want to perform in dance competitions or on TV.  We just wanted to go and have fun dancing.
We went to a festival and saw a couple dancing. It didn't matter what song the band played they were dancing and laughing and having a blast. During the break, we asked them, where did you learn how to do that?  They told us about this DVD and how it was a totally different way of learning to dance and how it brings back the fun of dancing. In addition, how the DVD was even life changing... WOW! they were right. There is so much ""right on"" practical information, humor, and common sense dancing tips it makes you feel like you can do it, and you can. We go dancing all the time and enjoy every minute. Thank you Chuck, I give you and the DVD a 10+.",1258416000,7,985,4.201058201058201
8224284,5,B000WMVVLI,"My husband and I felt like we individually were ""good dancers"" with basic rhythm and movement but never could dance together. Chuck Reed's real world dancing techniques has brought us together on the dance floor like never before.  It is simple to follow and does not rush over details. It is great to have to DVD to refresh and improve skills as well when heading out on that cruise or vacation if is has been a while since dancing, too!
Thank you so much!",1253836800,6,457,4.440476190476191
8224285,5,B000WMVVLI,"WOW, Now I can Dance...the best at any price for learning to dance and not be embarrassed on the dance floor. If I could follow this and have fun dancing anyone can!! Thanks Chuck!",1199577600,8,180,4.323529411764706
8224286,5,B000WMVVLI,"Do you sit on the sidelines while everyone around you is dancing the night away?  It could be that you are too shy to dance because you are out of practice or maybe you've always felt ""uncoordinated"".  This video helps you alleviate that fear and find your inner dancer.

Most people don't have the time, money or the inclination to take years of dance lessons.  Those who want to brush up on their dance skills will have a blast with HOW TO DANCE WITH TWO LEFT FEET.  You can forget trying to learn those complicated steps that you will never need. That pressure is what makes people give up when they begin to think that they will never be good enough.  This video teaches you at your own pace, how to dance to any style of music, with anybody -  anywhere you want.

The video's list of what ""not to do"" is priceless and the testimonials of people who have gained confidence and skills let you know at once that you have found the right teacher in Chuck Reed!

I highly recommend How to Dance with Two Left Feet.",1194480000,16,1014,4.322751322751323
8224287,5,B000WMVVLI,"How To Dance With Two Left Feet is the greatest yet.  I had ballet as a young woman and my passion has always been dancing.  As I grew into adulthood I couldn't find men who could just have fun dancing.  Not that they did not want to,  but rather that they did not know how.  I showed this video to my boyfriend and we have had a blast ever since.  We go on  cruises, weddings, parties and to local live music places.  We dance with laughter and ease.  My 23 and 25 year old sons have watched it and are taking their girlfreinds out on the town with us.  They bulked at watching it at first, but they started watching it and couldn't turn it off.  Anyone can learn this easy, simple ""Port Star"" method of dance. My Christmas gift list has this video by each name.",1194307200,12,763,4.122448979591836
