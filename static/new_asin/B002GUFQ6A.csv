8370036,4,B002GUFQ6A,"I very much like this movie with the exception of the ridiculous witches, which I could've done without.  It doesn't concern itself very much with reality, which I sometimes like.  It doesn't take itself too seriously and is just plain good fun.  I'm quite surprised that the profile of actress Susie Benton, who plays Rachel, hasn't risen higher.",1360713600,,347,4.948275862068965
8370037,5,B002GUFQ6A,"This is a conventional romantic comedy with a share of idiosyncrasy, enlivened by a winning cast.  The unusual conceit of meeting via ham radio sets the ground for more usual mutual deceptions, ultimately resolved in favor of the moral that if you really listen you get to know someone, even through their misdirections.

Ham radio is a network of enthusiasts who communicate through personal radio stations (which make radio *waves*--get it?).  The little fellowship central to the story is a mix of character types, including a cosmonaut in space.  Each of the romantic leads has a well intentioned but daffy sidekick, hers a member of a feminist witches' coven, his a slightly less peculiar version of the scene-stealing roommate in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Notting-Hill/dp/B000023VTP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Notting Hill</a>.  That film, which came out not long before this one was conceived, may have been a model, along with some You've Got Mail and no doubt many others--love of the legacy of cinema is a theme.  Even when it's derivative or predictable, which isn't always, it still has its own freshness.  It's always good-natured and heartwarming.

The cast is all new to me except for Robert Hardy, the always excellent character actor (probably best known currently as Cornelius Fudge in the Harry Potter films), but they mostly shine like seasoned pros.  Much of the credit for this must go to first-time director Nicolas van Pallandt, who also wrote the script.  The leading man, Craig Henderson, has a bit of a Hugh Grant thing going, without all the stammering.  The female lead, Susie Benton, recalls Liv Tyler.

In Britain this film has a 15 certificate, meaning it's only for those 15 and older.  It would likely be PG-13 here, with very brief partial nudity (not where you might expect it--no sex) and a fair amount of swearing.  The extra features on the DVD are video of comments from the actors taped after the filming, and the trailer.  No chapter cues or subtitles are available.  (There's no relation to the British miniseries of the same name.)  Watch through the credits for a final funny.

It might help in viewing this to know that it was a labor of love done on an amazingly small budget, reportedly about $80,000--practically pocket change for a feature film.  The actors and crew worked for a share of the profits in lieu of the usual pay.  First-time producer David Burns also did the musical score (mostly on a synth, it seems).  Locations were limited and, in the case of Lambeth Palace, fortuitously made available via a third party connection in exchange for a cameo by Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey.  Filmed in 2002, it didn't receive a major distribution deal for several years, sadly not until after writer/director Pallandt had died from cancer in 2006, age 45.  Things could be more polished or developed, perhaps, but all things considered, it's a remarkable success.

Four stars, plus one because it deserves more attention.",1292112000,3,3030,5.149284253578732
8370038,4,B002GUFQ6A,"This cute comedy, like so many before it, embeds a romantic fiasco within a supportive small-town mentality. If anything, some viewers might find the focus on about a half dozen characters claustrophobic. The amusing if stereotyped characters pull it along nicely, though: the parson with an Episcopalian kind of angst, the boozy and unshaven wild guy, the ponytailed race mechanic (or some such), the ranting conspiracy theorist, and the baffled but incredibly earnest couple smitten jointly by one of Cupid's arrows. If you expect happy endings all around, then stand up for a round of applause. That's exactly what happens.

The thing is, this gossipy, tight-knit community where everyone's business is everyone else's doesn't really exist, at least not on any map. One of its members appears for twenty minutes every two hours. The others lie scattered around the countryside, at locations unknown to each other. This community convenes via amateur radio. Don't laugh - this oldest of social networking technologies reached full maturity long before the Facebook developers ever dirtied a diaper. And, even if ham radio seems quaint to many readers, it has a low-key but loyal membership, even now connecting through the airwaves around you.

So, the small-town mentality works, especially in contrast to the geographic communities shown. The romantic comedy works, because that sort of insanity will be recognizable as long as humans remain human. And, more than anything else, the wireless communication creates a warm, retro-tech, comfort-food kind of closeness. It really brings out the essential warmth and commonality of the members of that little clique. That remains true right down to the end of the last scenes, when we suddenly learn things about our community members that should change everything - but don't. The voice and personality came through first, and they're what matter.
