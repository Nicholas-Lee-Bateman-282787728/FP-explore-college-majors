8507149,3,B001QPDBZE,"Don't get a Basenji!!!  The DVD lulls you into thinking that you can actually train a Basenji, but Basenji's only do what they want to do.  Mine decided that she did not want to get her feet wet when it rained and then chose the bed she slept in with her human upon which to urinate and defecate during those times!  And would not be trained out of that horrible, almost unbelievable, behavior.  I gave the DVD to the breeder when I finally returned her, a broken woman.  Other than that, my Basenji was a beautiful, smart, playful, and affectionate dog.",1250467200,,554,4.445544554455446
