3730034,5,B001OD8E2I,April 14th cant be soon enough but in my case it is since Ive been calling Universal for the last two years to get this put on the DVD format. When this debuted in 1993 in my area it started at 6:30am then moved to 8:30am then 3:30pm were it finished up its epic first run. I then discovered laserdiscs and 2 were produced which I readily picked up soon as I knew about them so now we move forward 16 years and have this released on DVD for a new generation of viewers to soak up this very well written albeit the animation is reminiscent of early Flash Gordon serialazations which IMO is a very good thing. Im eagerly awaiting all 4 seperate volumes then the box set to come out also. To wrap this up I can say a few more things. Buy it. Enjoy it. Tell friends about it. Buy the 1st volume en masse and distrubute to people who probably never seen or even heard about this awesome show.,1231545600,6,887,4.132947976878612
3730035,5,B001OD8E2I,"Along with Batman: The Animated Series - Exo-Squad was one of the greatest American animated shows ever produced!

With elements of Battlestar Galactica, Star Trek, Star Wars and lots of sci-fi lit this show was light years ahead of 80's toons like G.I. Joe or The Transformers.  This wasn't the same characters in new situations - but an epic storyline.  Each of the 52 episodes fit into each other like pieces of a puzzle - making it perfect for the DVD format!

Sadly the show wasn't marketed right and given rough time slots. The third season was setup with a shocking season 2 finish but it never happened - hopefully this show will have a new life on DVD, develop a new following, and maybe a new series...it worked for Family Guy.

If you like good really good animation and sci-fi/action.  This show is perfect for you.  Much as I loved Star Trek Next Gen, Firefly, and X-Files - EXO-SQUAD was the most original and entertaining sci-fi show of the last twenty years.",1230768000,5,974,4.595375722543353
3730036,5,B001OD8E2I,"Now here's an hard to watch show back when it first came out, and it was out before the USA run, (I first saw it in syndication)

This is one has a running storyline that works quite well and is hardly childish, if you liked the much later Roughnecks: Starship Troopers Chronicles this has just as tight in the writing and something that that one never could make it to... an ending.",1230595200,7,383,4.319444444444445
3730037,5,B001OD8E2I,"Sixteen years is a long time.  Children born during Exosquad's broadcast on USA network are now old enough to drive, quit school, and get married (parent signature required in most states).  But I digress, to those of us who have waited patiently for all these long years; Universal Studios Home Entertainment's announcement that Exosquad is coming to DVD is prime proof of the phrase ""better late than never"".

Exosquad - Season 1 is the first of two seasons from the animated USA Network series that debuted in 1993 and will be followed by three more 2-disc sets totaling 52 episodes.

The show, for those who don't know, is considered by many to be the closest domestic attempt at Japanese anime to date.  ExoSquad's creative staff weaved an ongoing tale centering on a single combat unit (the ExoSquad) and their exploits in a cosmic war raging between human beings and our own rebellious genetic creations, Neo-Sapiens.  The setting spans the rocky planets of our solar system (Venus, Earth, Mars) with occasional visits to the asteroid-laden rings of gas-giant Saturn.

Like most anime entries, the 52-episode saga does not consist of 52 individual episodes but rather 52 parts of a single tale.  Episodes typically end very abruptly and pick up in the next episode exactly where the previous one left off.  Additionally the show doesn't candy-coat concepts such as death or betrayal.  Like real wars, there are casualties and the team you happen to be rooting for doesn't always come out on top.  Finally the use of mecha (in this case they are called E-Frames or ExoFrames) takes another chapter from the typically considered Japanese area of expertise.

Previously released across several VHS tapes, this set collects the first 13 episodes together in one package for the first time. Episodes will be presented in full frame video, with English Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo audio and English subtitles.

Here are the episodes contained:

1 Pirate Scourge
2 Seeds of Deception
3 Hidden Terrors
4 Blitzkrieg
5 Resist!
6 Target: Earth
7 A Traitor Among Us
8 Scorched Venus
9 Sabotage
10 Abandoned
11 The Brood
12 Betrayal

3730038,5,B001OD8E2I,"This show was way ahead of it's time and by no means ""kiddie"" but was kid friendly in that it's war situations were real to life and people actually die with no coming back( unless of course you have a clone or two around).

3730048,5,B001OD8E2I,this is awesome it although they could had provided a bit more artwork on dvd its self it is still amazing. the dvd does come with special feature but it is only the previews of other movies that are out at least its better then nothing right. the episodes them selfs are crystal clear and in good conditions unlike some of the piss poor cartoons like street sharks where not all of the episodes was crystal clear,1455926400,,413,4.376623376623376
3730049,5,B001OD8E2I,"""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" has been touted as the western animation that brought maturity into the animation realm.  But actually, that's not quite true.  Shows like ""Batman: The Animated Series"", ""Wing Commander Academy"", ""The Robotech Saga (though granted, this one had much Japanese production influence on it), ""Extreme Ghost Busters"", ""Swat Kats"", and many countless other shows of the 90s and 80s had been doing that very thing long before.  And amongst them is this long-forgotten gem...well, forgotten until, now.  Exo Squad...a show introducing mature and adult themes to child and grownups since the 90s.

CONTENT ISSUES:  Well, the show tackles heavy themes, but honestly, there is nothing really ""offensive"" (sexual innuendos, vulgar language, etc.).  This was still made with the ""Saturday morning"" mentalities in mind.  But, it should be noted that, again, this show tackles very heavy themes...and amongst these is death. And, now, we aren't talking about ""implied"" deaths.  People actually die in this show in multiple episodes.  So, I just wanted people to be sure to understand that in case they are purchasing this for a child and are a little wary about showing them those harsh realities.

*I'll split this between an ""about the show"" and an ""about the DVD/Package"" sections*

ABOUT ""EXOSQUAD""...
""Exo Squad"" was an old 90s cartoon that ran for 2 complete seasons.  It was produced with the intention of being a contender to Japanese Anime, which was becoming known as the place to go for ""mature"" animation.  And with this mission in mind, ""Exo Squad"" came into being.

BASIC PLOT (NO SPOILERS)...
Since this is a lesser known title, I'll give you a basic synopsis.  At a future time on Earth, mankind has expanded into the stars developing colonies on various planets.  However, to help develop these worlds, man created an artificial being known as ""Neo-Sapiens"" in order to help facilitate the hard labor.  Eventually, these beings initiated a rebellion...but were promptly put down.  Still, the underlying flame seeding in these beings were never fully quenched.  And that's where we are, in a brand new civil war.  The show, itself, is episodic.  In other words, every episode leads into each other and affects the others.

THEMES -
What made this show so special was it's courage in tackling heavy and important themes.  It dealt with loss, it dealt with issues of loyalty and betrayal.  It's a discourse on tyranny and healing.  It also doesn't shy away from the brutality...yet at times necessity...of war.  It explores a multi-facetated conflict that isn't as clearcut as we would like.  There's also good and realistic use of strategy displayed in the battles for you military buffs out there.  And again...death is a huge theme, here.  Many die from both the ""villain"" characters, to the ""good"" characters.

CHARACTERS -
Besides the themes, it was also the memorable and relatable characters that helped to carry this show.  It largely centers around Able Squad of the Human/Terran Exo-fleet.  Each of the characters are unique with lasting personalities.  There's Lt. J.T. Marsh who is a cool headed leader respected by all.  Though no rebel at heart, he does operate with a strong moral compass and strong strategic mind which allows him to evaluate orders given to him accurately.  There's Kaz Takagi, the rookie who is desperate to prove himself a useful part of the force.  There's Marsala, one of the few Neo-Sapiens serving under the Exo-fleet.  He's got quite a story surrounding him.  Then there's Nara, the second rookie on the team, she fights for the hope of her family.  Admiral Winfield is also another amazing character, and a true admiral that cares about the big picture, but is not one to shy away from taken care of ""smaller details"" too.  And there are several more worthy main characters as well.  And I find it amazing how they manage to get them all to have meaningful screen times.  I also loved how each had unique character designs...and E-frame designs (their combat suits)...and it matched their roles and character traits.

But beyond the amazing main cast, the production team didn't scrimp on the minor characters as well.  In fact, they all have such attractive and memorable personalities, I did not realize that many of them were minor characters until they died or something like that.  And even when they died, somehow, you still felt for them.  Even the nameless guards have cool personalities.  And all the supporting characters have unique character designs.

ABOUT THE DVD PACKAGE-
This is the only part that leaves you wanting.  It's truly a ""bare-bones"" package and I wish there could have been more.

The discs:
Their are 2 discs and the hold the complete 1st season (thirteen episodes).  Both are contained in a single DVD case of normal size

Special Features:
Unfortunately, none.

ALL IN ALL:
For any sci-fi junky or animation aficionado, you owe it to yourself to watch this series.  And it's affordable, too!  Admittedly, they could have done better in the ways of special features.  But in the end, the show itself is what it's all about...and it more than makes up for the lack of ""features"".  I certainly hope you will give this series a chance to be remembered...and I know most if not all of you will find much encouragement and thought provoking material from it.  Here's looking forward to a season 2 DVD release!",1453161600,3,5404,4.97986577181208

3730051,5,B001OD8E2I,"It's a shame that after finally releasing first season on DVD, the production company seems decided cut their loses and hasn't released a second season (its been 8 years since the Season 1 came out on DVD). I guess the sales weren't sufficient. Sad, this series so underappreciated. With the right marketing it could have and should have been one of the best animated series of the late 90's Saturday morning line up.  Would have made a great move too, with the modern technology finally providing the special effects needed.",1451865600,7,525,4.833333333333333

3730063,5,B001OD8E2I,"Growing up, I was big on mech shows. Voltron and Transformers were huge hits with me. And Exosquad blows them both out of the water.
With its powerful storytelling, well-rounded characters (hero and villain alike), and uneasy alliances within Exofleet and among the Neo Sapiens, Exosquad isn't just a vehicle to sell toys. It's a story about people. The themes it tackles- life, death, slavery, prejudice, romance, trauma, loyalty, honor- are more prevelant here than in other lauded shows such as Batman: The Animated Series and Gargoyles. Exosquad makes no apologies, no excuses, and sugar coats nothing. It's the kind of show I always wanted Voltron to be. The greatest tragedy is its cancellation after two seasons. I loved every minute of it.",1433116800,11,747,5.08130081300813

The writing & acting is just great, & the serialized storytelling makes it feel like an anime.

I wasn't able to keep up with it usually what with different channels in different areas so sadly I misssed alot of it. I wonder if they will ever release the rest of the seasons because I never got to see the ending, or well most of the series to be honest, either. It was one of the rare shows that actually had a pretty serious story and wasn't just some flashing images that had no point except to, I don't know, draw the eye across the screen for no discernable reason except to say ""HEY! Look at me, Im Flashing! Arent I pretty!?"". Ah well good times.

3730092,5,B001OD8E2I,"Even though Mobile Suit Gundam was created well before Exo Squad; this was a show I'd never seen before on animated television, as a kid, and it blew me away with its mature themes and storytelling having grown up in the 1980s I'd saw a little of that with Transformers and GI Joe (which the two shows I still love) but you had two types of shows that are either safe and marketable but still leaves room to insult the intelligence of the viewer (e.g. The Masters of the Universe) or shows with a overbearing social message while insulting the intelligence of the viewer (e.g. Care Bears, Captain Planet and the Get-Along Gang).

Now what got me hook onto Exo-Squad was, it was a war, not this 'rah-rah-rah! beat up the bad guys; but no one is allowed to die' No! Much like Gundam, everyone gets hurt or dies such Captain Marcus on board the Resolute, Alec Deleon near the end of the war. But you also saw the horrors of war, unlike other kid's shows, where humans were 'deported' from Earth which was more of a coverstory to commit mass genocide, mass starvations on Venus, force labor labor camps. Plus it's a show where all the characters are flawed, not perfect (unlike Captain Planet where all heroes character are perfect). Such as JT suffers from survivior's guilt, Marcus is an officer with very little command or combat expereince due his promotions were during a 50 year peace and he sees his chances for glory, Shiva is ever the soldier even though he later on believes that Phaeton might end up costing the Neo Sapiens the war still remains loyal to him, Phaeton, much like Girhen Zabi from Gundam, is the shadow of Hitler.

I'm hoping there will be enough demand for the season 2 to released on DVD because I really want this show since it does go well with my Gundam collection.

Also in one of life little ironies both Exo Squad and the original Gundam series suffered same fate, cancelled for being commerical failures but Gundam had such a following among college students who want more, Sunrise had enough brains to commission Yoshiyuki Tominio to condense the TV show into 3 movies and create Zeta Gundam which breathed new life into the franchise for the next 30 years, I wished Exo Squad had that same chance.",1316995200,4,2230,4.583959899749374

3730094,5,B001OD8E2I,"I am fortunate to have seen this series when it was still running on television back in the early to mid 90s. I have to say that this has stood up well in the time since it stopped airing. The familiar theme gave me goosebumps and brought back memories. At the end of the day, isn't that what watching these shows are all about? That said, I love that this show presented war in a pretty realistic light. People actually died, and mature themes like prejudice, genocide and the atrocities of war were presented in a way that one could understand. Obviously, being a 'kids' show, it couldn't portray all these things in a truly realistic way. Although the animation didn't stand up to animation from foreign, i.e., Asian studios of the same era, we were visually treated to a stunning color palette and varied designs in the e-frames and even the characters' uniforms. The conflict was very relatable, the battle scenes made you hold your breath wondering who would win, who would live and who would die. I often found myself thinking how mature this show really was in its presentation of the various situations you happened across.

I was about 10 years old when this was on TV, but as a 27 year old adult now, I can finally appreciate this show for what it was and is. I really want to purchase Season 1 on DVD, but I can't help but wonder when Season 2 will hit the shelves.

The storyline is stellar and takes its time developing the characters and settings. The war fought between the humans and Neo-sapiens is not black and white, and makes you think, something few cartoons do.

3730097,5,B001OD8E2I,"Other reviews here are right on the money, so I'll just add my quick 2 cents:

Suspend your disbelief about how good a saturday morning cartoon can be -- for me, this show was never about the animation, nor about the 22 minute time slot it had to fit into on TV.  Exosquad is a truly compelling storyline about issues of war, racism, genocide, slavery, loss, courage, and of course controlling big robot suits through a neural connection in the back of your neck!  I compare it in many ways to Battlestar Galactica -- which had some elements of ""cool tech,"" but was overall a character & human drama.

True, the animation is sometimes choppy or dumb, and occasionally there are small plot devices that wouldn't hold up on a primetime show.  But the excellent writing, and great quality of most of the voice acting, makes me view the animation almost as a storyboard for movie or primetime TV show.  (If only!)  All the pieces are there, it would just need to be better funded to see it better realized!

When will season 2 come out?  Contact Universal to request it, right now they have no plans! [...]",1298246400,4,1102,4.525252525252525

It is like an American version of Robotech however with a toned down flair as it is aimed partially at children and with more of focus on war like a World War II movie and more sci-fi elements like genetics, and more traditional sci-fi elements.

Though no real extras, this the only time it has been released on DVD, so I am giving it high score to encourage them to release the rest of the series. I almost didn't know this came out as there was no real announcement or advertising. Universal should have placed some strategic ads on fan sites or scifi-sites. I'm hoping they release the complete season 2 DVD very soon.

For fan trivia, the makers of Battletech and Mechwarrior were embroiled with a lawsuit with Playmates over images conceived for the toylines for the series. To complicate things some of the robot images where from the Japanese Robotech related animes.

I guess this would be an ""American"" version of anime, and if you would say to compare this to Japanese anime like Gundam, you can distinctly see the philosophy behind American attempts at making cartoons more mature. Basically making cartoons more mature by focusing on realism and seriousness, with topics such as racism and grounding the technology to be a little more believable.",1247097600,4,1359,4.725738396624473

3730120,5,B001OD8E2I,"Although I love science fiction, one of the things that bothers me about most is that they're almost always completely implausible and filled with nonsensical techno-babble. Although Exosquad does make use of some fairly fanciful technology like exoskeleton battle suits, fusion powered vehicles, and interplanetary colonies, they stay within the bounds of practical science. They're not traveling around the galaxy faster than the speed of light; it takes them weeks to travel between our solar system's planets. No aliens from other worlds either, mankind can is good enough at creating enemies for itself.

The continuous story line with a defined beginning, middle, and end is another thing I love about this show. The story itself seems more similar to the reimagined Battlestar Galactica than the original Battlestar Galactica itself.

My only gripe is that for a series so clearly created with older audiences in mind is that everything is so brightly colored, and there's no set uniform. This very G.I. Joe like aspect was clearly put in so that they could sell toys.

I truly enjoyed this show when I was young and it was more than just a 'cartoon' as it was more serious and reflected a lot of society. There are a lot of noble characters that gave you something more realistic to look up to than superman or batman who were awesome but not realistic.

However, I'm still rating this at 5 stars.

Why?  It's simple, they don't make cartoons like this anymore.  They don't make cartoons with a cohesive plot involving doses of reality that kids miss in today's shows.  For instance, in the VERY first episode, people die.  They don't glorify combat by showing that no one really gets hurt, or have the enemy as a collection of unintelligent robots.  No, the creators of this show make sure that the viewer realizes that war is not fun, but instead focuses on a story of triumph in the face of overwhelming odds.

Wow, I'm getting preachy.  Anyway, it's a good show, it pays attention to detail (pupils dilating in response to entering a dark room, for instance), and it's every bit as good as I remember.

Who knows, maybe if enough people by the DVD, they will finish up the series in a straight to DVD release of some kind.  That would be...awesome! :-)",1241654400,6,1047,4.540106951871658

Epic in scope and massively ambitious, Exosquad is not merely a kid's action show. The plot is based recognizably on the Second World War, and it deals maturely with issues of race, slavery, war, death, and hate, all without ever getting too dark for kids to watch. Even so, teens and older will get a lot more out of this show, once they get past the early-90s animation (quite good for the USA at the time, but looks unrefined by today's standards). Moreover, while the show was canceled after the second season, it was one of those rare serendipitous cancellations at a point that really MAKES SENSE to stop, so once the rest of the series comes out (assuming it does, unlike say, Gargoyles), you can have a complete saga ready for your viewing pleasure.

As said before in previous reviews, the series as a whole didn't really feature stand-alone episodes, but worked as an overarching season arc instead, in which our heroes battle the powerful and genetically engineered Neo-Sapiens.  This collection features all 13 first season episodes, and while watching Exo-Squad now finds the series hasn't aged all that well (particularly the animation), the series is still notable for some striking mature themes and an ever-compelling storyarc and characters you actually end up caring about.

The discs themselves have a very neat, nicely finished 2-toned disc face in red with the bare metallic letters shining through,... the design makes the disc appear to have a deep etched look, that while maybe not a selling point, is attractive and easily readable.

What you get on the discs, is the equivalent of 3 feature length films spanning over run of the opening season.  These 3 main story arcs unfold over the course course of 13 episodes, on 2 separate discs.  With each episode book-ended with the credits and story recaps.  The quality of the episodes is very good, but drops quite noticeably during each episode's opening recap.  The colors during these parts are extremely faded and the sound quality drops. but picks right back up as the episode title comes up.

3730129,5,B001OD8E2I,"At long last, after 16 years since it originally aired, the first season of Exosquad arrives on DVD. I thought that Universal was going to let this show rot in their vaults. This series was ahead of it's time in many ways, and that it was Universal's first animated TV attempt made it all the more impressive. Exosquad is a epic series that depicts a war between humans and their creations who want a real identity for themselves, whom unfortunately are led by a dictator who holds fanatical visions of a supreme ""destiny"" and attempts to achieve it at all costs.

The show concluded it's run after 2 seasons, and though the war is resolved in the final episode it still leaves off with a huge cliffhanger. Perhaps the best thing about the series is that it was one long continuous plot told in a whopping 52 episodes. This was uheard of for an orginal American animated series back in the mid-1990's. Cutting out commercial time, this saga goes on for almost 17 and a half hours. Though the animation is a mixed bag and shows it's age, the series approach to the plot was mostly very serious, the script and voice acting were solid, many characters were well developed, and it explored and touched upon many thematic elements and complex issues, among them racism and the psychological effects of war.

The noticable flaws (to me anyways), were that many of the character and vehicle designs and color scheme clearly lend themselves as of being the action figure toy type, it could have benefited having a more (while good) varied musical score and sound effects, and that occasionally some of the plot elements seemed akin for more juvenile animation. These would have been ok, except that with the plot itself and the depth that it has, it seems that adults and teenagers would appreciate it more than younger kids (fans, you know what happens in Episode 11 ""The Brood"").

That was perhaps the biggest obstacle the series faced as an airing program. It was marketed to the wrong audience, yet contains elements for a younger demographic, and it required a committed viewing and long attention span to understand the story arches. Add this to the fact that during it's initial run the show would air in haphazard timeslots, and you have a recipe for having the majority of TV viewers, animation or otherwise, never hearing about Exosquad.

Overall, the series is criminally underrated, and deserves to be checked out by anyone who enjoys animation or science fiction, and also because the characters have real emotions and motivations.

This DVD set is unfortunately bare bones, but hopefully some extras will be included in a future release of Season 2.

The complex dynamic characters, social themes, & long arcs are what made this show truly great and addictive.  Unfortunately, the show fell victim to market conditions and was lost into obscurity, but not before a fantastic finale, and edge of your seat cliff hanger!

It seems that my generation (late 20's) has a thing for nostalgia (i.e. - Transformers & GI Joe live action movies).  Exosquad was clearly targeted at this nostalgic generation at the time (teenagers & young adults, not children), so if sales are good, Exosquad could be next up to bat for a live action series or mini-series!

Exosquad is an above average series that - despite it's toy roots - stepped out onto the stage and made it's own mark. You would legitimately never know toys were involved in the first place with the deep storyline and complex characters. It dealt with ethical issues like war, slavery, racial hatred and the value of life and death and managed not to be infantile or pandering at any moment.

This is the type of show the Cartoon network should be showing prime time Saturday night rather then that pathetic Clone Wars. Speaking of selling toys, Exosquad had some of the most accurately detailed beautiful toys ever made by the the Playmates company. I bought all of them and still blown away everytime I look at them.

This would make for a great live action television series.",1239667200,4,376,3.973333333333333
3730141,5,B001OD8E2I,"We've all been waiting for this moment for far too long.  Other reviews have already explained the brilliance of this show and how unappreciated it was (and still is).

There are no commentaries or special features, which is sort of a drag, but hopefully sales of season 1 will be strong enough that they'll put a bit more effort into the season 2 discs.

It's great to finally own this DVD and here's hoping the rest of the show will be out in not too long.",1239667200,6,458,4.3023255813953485
3730142,5,B001OD8E2I,"I've been an Exo Squad fan since it's original airing, so I have to give this a 5. The DVD's are what you'd expect: all the Season 1 episodes on 2 discs.

There are no special features, no commentary tracks, no featurettes, and no foreign languages. Just episodes. As an Exo Squad fan, I would have loved features like this, though I was not expecting them given the relative obscurity of the show.

The discs also come in a white case instead of a normal black case. Apparently the producers thought this was some kind of kid's show!",1239667200,24,534,4.438775510204081
3730143,5,B001OD8E2I,"True this happened while Babylon 5 was still going on, BUT the reason i wrote that as part of the title is that this show is dramatically brilliant for an animated series in the morning.  For me this beat X-men on Saturdays.  It beats X-men for it had a beginning middle and end, a strong structure for story telling...aside from that tid bit in the final episode...fans you know what I am talking about.  The animation may not be as crisp as 90s Batman, but you have to give them the props for the detail they were puting in the character's design and the design of the ships while bringing to life serious scenes and action sequences.  If you haven't seen this show and are a fan of animated series in action, adventure, and down to earth characters and sci-fi political drama...you will be pleased for what it was doing at its time.  Such a show should not be forgotten.  If you are a fan of comedy then this is not for you.  To those fans of X-men, GI Joe, to the battlestar Galactica and yes my fav B5...do check this out.  Don't believe me or still not sure, read other reviews to prove our suggestions' sincerity.

My online friends and I have been praying for a DVD release of this show for quite some time.  My old VHS tapes started loosing sound, watching on the computer YouTube episodes doesn't really satisfy completely, but it was the way.  Thank you for this release.  March is a drag, and April is taking too long to come.",1236124800,26,1438,4.384905660377359
3730144,5,B001OD8E2I,"Can't believe it is finally here, been waiting for what seems like forever. Great story and characters, and is not a childish cartoon. I have had the 1st season on VHS and Laserdisc, and the 2nd season recorded from TV, I hope people continue to buy this to ensure the 2nd season is put out. Thank you finally for making available on DVD.",1235433600,7,338,4.380952380952381
8330484,5,B001OD8E2I,"For me, Exosquad was a pivotal part of my childhood.  It introduced me to new ideas and philosophies and showed the perspectives of so many that were considered to be evil or cruel, might even be misunderstood.  In many ways, it was almost like a precursor to Game of Thrones.  It introduced concepts of inter-species relationships and genetic alternation with dark undertones related to torture, slavery, genocide, starvation, betrayal, and suicide.  It also showed the harmful consequences of what the effects would be.  As a child, this show really forced me to grow up and see other possibilities and aspects of the world and how important it was to be open minded, something else hinted at in other shows or comics such as X-Men.

Oh, and the ever-evolving plot line and continuation from one episode to the next was reminiscent of Babylon 5 and later Deep Space Nine.

I must have seen this series at least 20 times over the course of my life and never have I gotten bored of it.  I only wish Season 2 would eventually be released for viewing and the rights would be picked up by someone to product a new generation of content.",1523145600,2,1133,4.658291457286432
