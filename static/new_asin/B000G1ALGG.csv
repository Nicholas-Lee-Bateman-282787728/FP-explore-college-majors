8128366,4,B000G1ALGG,"Note quickly how brief the three previous reviews of this DVD have been! There's a reason for such brevity. It's hard to say what to make of this ""cinemopera"" of Thomas Ads's first piece of musical theater. It's categorized as a ""chamber opera"" with four charcaters, three of whom portray several characters each. This production is NOT, however, a film of a stage event. It's an outright cinema, clearly edited both scene by scene and musically dubbed, and it's hard to conceptualize how it might be performed live on stage. What you get with this DVD is visually rather lurid, somewhere between Lucia di Lamermoor and The Addams Family. Do conservatories these days offer young singers courses in simulated sex acts on bathroom floors, with well-modulated gasps of pleasure as part of vocal technique?

The libretto is purportedly based on the life of an historical Britisher, Margaret Duchess of Argyll, whose scandalous divorce captivated the tabloids. Most of the scenes are the Duchess's flashbacks to  romantic affairs of her earlier life, prompted by scrapbook photos. The aging Duchess is now impoverished and humiliated. That much is ""vaguely clear"" even though much of the recitative is impossible to comprehend without subtitles or a libretto text. Thus many of the flashback scenes are perversely undecipherable, though what they reveal is perversity incarnate. English is hard enough to understand on stage, but sung English is fiendish even in ballads, let alone in bizarre fragmented ultra-coloratura. Besides, they're singing it all in some quaint island dialect! ;-)

The music, nevertheless, offers a lot to be interested in. How's that for faint praise? I'm not at all sure I enjoy it, but I find it intriguing. Ads has written a second opera by now -- The Tempest, an adaptation of the Shakespeare play -- that has been presented in two completely different stagings. It's a much more mature, musically deft, dramatically effective opera. I've seen the more recent staging live and would strongly recommend it to any opera fan. I've also reviewed the CD of the earlier Tempest production.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ads-The-Tempest/dp/B0026FIR3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ads: The Tempest</a>",1355270400,6,2262,5.4756446991404015
8128367,2,B000G1ALGG,"This is a wonderful opera. Too bad the DVD release had to be of this hideous production. All the actors are miscast, and the direction is simply astonishingly ghastly. I will continue to listen to the superb recording, without visuals. Also included in the package is a portrait of the composer, much more worthwhile. It is too bad about opera directors....",1229299200,7,357,4.868852459016393
