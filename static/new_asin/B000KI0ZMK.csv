VERY EARLY NEW YORK NY FILMS (the correct title) is NOT a bootleg DVD. It is clearly a privately manufactured item that contains some historically significant public domain film clips. The DVD is nicely packaged in a slimline case that includes three pages of notes (reproduced here under yumheart's review). The quality of the recording is fine. There's menus for easy access to all 45 movies and professional-looking title cards that identify each film.

This isn't scripted cinema as we've come to know it. The primary attraction of these one and two minute vignettes for contemporary viewers was the photographed MOTION itself-- still a novelty at the turn of the 20th century. But for us, here's a wonderful way to see life as it existed over a hundred years ago.

Viewing condition (unless otherwise noted in the following list) is good to fine. That alone is quite remarkable for such ancient and perishible silver nitrate stock. Most importantly, these are all shown in real time-- movement seems natural, not hurried as silents so often appear. No jangly and meandering piano is overdubbed-- in fact, there's no sound at all. Another plus.

PROGRAM NOTES--
ARRIVAL OF EMIGRANTS - ELLIS ISLAND (1906)
Powerful, if limited in action. Hopeful newcomers to America carry in arms and on backs as much as they could manage to bring with them from Europe. They are directed into lines by Immigration officials. Their sheer numbers would change the face of NYC forever.

AT THE FOOT OF THE FLATIRON (1903)
Pedestrians buffeted by wind grasp hats to heads. One jaunty man doffs his derby for the camera as he passes by. An excellent vignette.

AUTOMOBILE PARADE (1900)
Taken from a paper reference print, this short suffers from the grainy blurriness caused by the deterioration of that medium over time. The unique vehicles are compelling, nonetheless.

BARGAIN DAY, 14th ST. NYC (1905)
An indistinguishable throng slowly shuffles in front of Rothschild's five-and-dime. Not much to see here.

BEGINNING OF A SKYSCRAPER (1902)
Workmen in a pit that will one day be a tall building. Steam rises in the background, while closer to the camera, men with giant hammers break rock.

BROADWAY & UNION SQUARE NYC (1903)
Electric streetcars stop opposite each other. Passengers disembark or board.

BUFFALO BILL'S WILD WEST PARADE (1902)
Disappointing blurry paper print. Lots of feathered Indians and cops on horseback. A stagecoach hurries by. More Indians and uniformed men on white horses parade, but where is Bill? Young boys run excitedly alongside.

DELIVERING NEWSPAPERS (1903)
Newsboys await the arrival of a NEW YORK WORLD delivery truck. As the horse-drawn vehicle pulls into view, pushing and shoving ensues. Two boys fistfight in foreground as clip ends.

DEPARTURE OF PEARY (and the) ""ROOSEVELT"" FROM NY (1905)
Film is sharp, but boring. Ladies in ornate headwear and shirt-sleeved men in straw hats board ship. Clearly a hot day.

ELEVATED RAILROAD NY (1903)
Watery images filled with blots and flaws reveal little of city skyline.

EMIGRANTS LANDING AT ELLIS ISLAND (1903)
A double-decked ""MYER'S EXCURSIONS"" boat teeming with humanity docks. The passengers are a mixture of middle-class and peasant.

EXCAVATING FOR A NEW YORK FOUNDATION (1903)
Day laborers shovel dirt into a nearby cart. A fully loaded canvas-covered wagon is hoisted out of the pit by a crane.

FIREBOAT ""NEW YORKER"" IN ACTION (1903)
Water-throwing demonstration by a newly acquired weapon against fire.

FUNERAL OF HIRAM CRONK (1905)
A remarkable but somber procession includes some Spansh-American and Civil War veterans, all in full uniform. The latter are the most interesting of all. Great film clip.

INTERIOR OF NY SUBWAY (1905)
Rear of a moving train as seen from a closely following one. The newly opened subway was a turn-of-the-century engineering marvel.

LOWER BROADWAY (1903)
Horse-drawn carts cross paths with electric trollys (the old vs. the new). An enormous crowd fills the sidewalks. Highly evocative film.

MOVE ON (1903)
Fruit & vegetable sellers conduct sidewalk business, while pushcart peddlers of all variety pass by. A cop comes along and sternly lectures the two produce men to ""keep moving."" The officer's demeanor suggests that this was probably not the first time he'd told them that.

NY FIRE DEPT. RETURNING (1903)
Teams of spirited horses pull ladder wagons and steaming engines as ""New York's Bravest"" return from a conflagration.

NYC ""GHETTO"" FISH MARKET (1903)
Save for the clothing, this could be an open-air market of any era. Graffiti, not a modern invention, may be seen on a far wall.

NYC DUMPING WHARF (1903)
Several men armed with rakes stand atop a heaping garbage scow, while cartloads of refuse are dumped almost on top of them. Clouds of foulness rise up around these poor creatures.

NY HARBOR POLICE CAPTURING PIRATES (1903)
Slow-moving, considering the event. A rowboat overtaken by authorities. The rowers surrender peaceably.

NY POLICE PARADE June 1st, 1899
Officers in tall, rounded helmets that are topped with decorative knobs march in double-rows, ten across. When a large gap between paraders occurs, jaywalkers scurry across the street from both directions. None of the cops pay them any mind.

OPENING OF NEW EAST RIVER BRIDGE NY (1903)
The mayor trails a flag bearer carrying a banner that proclaims his presence. He is accompanied and followed by dozens of city officials, all in top hat or bowler and great coats.

OPENING THE WILLIAMSBURG BRIDGE (1904)
It looks like the same procession! Here's His Honor again, traipsing behind that ""MAYOR"" flag, along with political cronies. The older men look very much like the cartoon millionaire from the MONOPOLY board game, with their 19th century mustaches and top hats.

PANORAMA FROM A BROOKLYN BRIDGE TOWER (1903)
Pans quickly and is too blurry to really see anything beyond motion and the bridge's supporting columns, which appear halfway through the clip.

PANORAMA FROM TIMES BUILDING (1905)
Much better film. We can clearly make out the old Hippodrome, Times Square and rowhouse buildings within view of the newly-opened Times offices.

PANORAMA OF BLACKWELL'S ISLAND (1903)
Panning reveals waterfront homes, construction sites and undeveloped lots.

PANORAMA OF FLATIRON BUILDING (1903)
These sweeping shots were apparently a popular film topic. Street traffic dominates, then a view of the unusually thin skyscraper.

PANORAMA OF RIKER'S ISLAND (1903)
Filmed prior to the prison's construction. Panoramic films tend to be a bit dull (""Hey... I can see my great-grandfather's house from here!"")

PANORAMA: WATERFRONT AND BROOKLYN BRIDGE FROM EAST RIVER (1903)
See above. (At least there's more here to look at as it quickly passes by.)

PARADE OF ""EXEMPT"" FIREMEN (1903)
Or, ""The Parade of the Wooden Firemen."" Retired firefighters totter along.

PARADE OF HORSES ON SPEEDWAY (1903)
Slow crawling ""speedway"" procession of horse-drawn open carriages.

PENNSYLVANIA TUNNEL EXCAVATION (1905)
Too-dark film of trains passing a construction site. All the excitement of a hole in the ground.

A PERILOUS PROCEEDING (1902)
Almost a dozen men ride a small crane platform from on-high and down to the street.

PILOT BOATS IN NY HARBOR (1899)
Sloops and steamers pass by. Film has spot damage.

SKATING ON LAKE, CENTRAL PARK (1902)
Grainy footage of the timeless pursuit of wintertime fun-- frolicking on ice.

SKYSCRAPERS OF NY (Parts 1 - 3) (1906/1903/1903)
By modern standards, mostly modest-sized buildings. Bricklayers and ironworkers perform jobs little-changed over 100 years. Part 2 is a fictional account of ""Dago Pete's"" firing, revenge and just rewards. Pete fights with his boss and is sacked. He plants stolen goods in the foreman's home. Later, Pete grapples with a contractor on open beams. His opponent slips over the edge but is rescued. In the last scene, Pete is in court testifying against the wrongfully accused foreman. Pete's duplicity is ultimately revealed by a young girl who witnessed his attempt to frame the man.
Following this is another stultified cityscape panorama which may be of some interest to architectural historians.

SLEIGHING SCENE (1898)
A blurry Christmas card of sleighs moving away from the camera on a snow-covered path.

SORTING REFUSE AT AN INCINERATING PLANT NYC (1903)
Ragpickers cull through castoff clothing destined for burning.

STAR THEATRE (1902)
Engaging time lapse photography of a multistory building's disassembly by hand. Well done!

STATUE OF LIBERTY (1898)
A clear copy of an Edison studios film of the Lady in the Harbor has uncharacteristically little movement to it.

A STREET ARAB (1898)
Amazing footage of a young boy who performs back-breaking twists and turns.

WHAT HAPPENED ON 23rd ST. NYC (1901)
A lady's ground-length skirt blows up in the air, revealing her well-turned ankles. Scandalous!

WHITE WINGS ON REVIEW (1903)
Hundreds of street sweepers in spotless white uniforms march past litter and horse doovers.",1181174400,8,8990,5.224077940153097
8157119,3,B000KI0ZMK,"As someone else noted this is a very poor quality bootleg dvd with no soundtrack and no sub titles. Although  I truly enjoyed some of the historic images, however, if this dvd cost an extra 5or6 bucks and had some sort of ryme or reason it would've made a big difference.  I'm into vintage films so quite a few images I've seen before (the lady who has her dress blow up for example) but on the whole I'm glad I've got it in my collection for the automobile parade alone, showing all these way out designs that people were experementing with.

The 3 stars are due to the fact that there is a poor quality and NO EXPLANATION OF ANYTHING! QUITE WILLY NILLY!  But oh do I love the era so. If your a true fan of old films you too can overlook this.",1177545600,7,744,4.145833333333333
8157120,2,B000KI0ZMK,"Interesting film footage,but with problems. First off this is not a factory manufactured dvd,it is a bootleg dvd-r(This may be why the picture quality is so poor)There is also no music.",1174003200,5,185,5.0
