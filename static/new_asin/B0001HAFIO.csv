2001451,3,B0001HAFIO,"I guess that this was my fault, but it was an honest mistake. I bought this movie hoping to see Hillary Swank bounce around In a sports bra, then break her neck. I popped a bowl of corn and got a nice glass of lemonade, and settled in for two hours of bouncing and breaking, but that didn't happen.
 Instead, I got sandy Duncan and Dean Jones in a romantic romp about a duck that lays golden eggs. It was a good film, and I'm glad I own it, but does that boxing movie even exist? I can't find any clues anywhere!",1216598400,2,512,4.019607843137255

2001453,4,B0001HAFIO,"THE STORY: Professor Dooley (Dean Jones) and Katie (Sandy Duncan)  are a married couple that is having a hard time making it financially. Now to top it off their son wants a dog, but they can't afford it. Dooley is working as a low-level scientist at a laboratory that uses animals as test subjects for intelligence, and his ownh duck subject is a failure. One day the duck gets gamma rays by accident and the boss says, ""Get rid of that duck"". The duck goes home with Dooley and becomes the boys new pet, Charlie. But trouble starts when he begins to lay golden eggs. The family wants to take the duck for their own use and gets greedy, upsetting the boy. It turns out the duck will only lay eggs for a certain sound and watching Dean Jones try to attempt this sound is hilarious. The government is trying to track down the source of the gold eggs that keep showing up around town. But the party is interrupted by a hostile neighbor (played by Disney regular Joe Flynn) that works for the IRS, and leads up to a wild car chase by the IRS agents and this leads to tons of slapstick humor. Good clean family movie.

TRIVIA & BEHIND THE SCENES: Directed by Vince McEveety. Dean Jones returns for his seventh movie with Disney. Screenplay by by Roswell Rogers, based an original story by Ted Key. Title sequences featured animation by Disney animator Ward Kimball.  Filmed at the Walt Disney studios lot. The studio announced auditions at the time for the key roles as... the duck. People from all around brought their ducks, and Disney chose 3 of them to play the part. They were treated like royalty while there, and had recreational swims in the pond at one of the outdoor berms. Sandy Duncan received a Golden Globe nomination as ""New Star of the Year"", and a nomination from the Globes for ""Actor in a Leading Role (Musical or Comedy)"" went to Dean Jones. Running time: 92 minutes.
Released theatrically on June 30, 1971 with a G rating. It aired on the ""The Wonderful World of Disney"" television show in 1974, '79, and '82. During the climactic scene when Dooley is chasing the duck, we see a Volkswagen Beetle. It has the same license plate number Herbie's from Disney's ""The Love Bug"", Dean Jones most popular movie ever.
The current release on DVD of this movie has not been remastered, does not seem as if the image or sound has been cleaned up. No extras on the DVD.",1129680000,29,2374,4.4907407407407405

2001455,4,B0001HAFIO,"I am delighted to see that two of my favorite Disney films have been released on dvd, ""Million Dollar Duck"" and ""The Barefoot Executive.""  Descriptions of the plots for these movies are already noted here, but I will say that both these films are very enjoyable family viewing.  I can remember going to the theater as a child and watching these films, and I still enjoy them today. Nobody's claiming they're the best films ever, or even the best Disney films ever, just good, fun entertainment in the grand Disney tradition. Some have complained about these films not being released in their original aspect ratio's, or being remastered for dvd.  Although I would have preferred them released letterboxed as well, neither film was released in a very wide aspect ratio, so they play fine on tv, and as for Disney using the same masters they used for the vhs releases and tv airings, if that's what they did, big deal.  Those prints are fine.  Sharp, clear pictures, with good color. Sure, it would have been nice to have remastered letterboxed versions on dvd, but be grateful we have them on dvd at all.  They've both been a long time coming.",1115251200,24,1142,4.685
2001456,1,B0001HAFIO,"Well, it looks like Disney is cleaning out the studio vaults with it's DVD release of ""Million Dollar Duck"", one of it's absolute worst films and a textbook example of everything that was wrong with Disney films during the incredibly lame Ron Miller years.  To add insult to injury, they apparently aren't even bothering to release this one in a restored widescreen print; instead, they're dumping in onto the format in the same tired old VHS print that's been available for years.  I ask consumers everywhere:  why buy something on DVD that isn't any better than what you've already got on VHS?  Why waste your money?  And why not demand that Disney work a little for your entertainment dollar?

Let's face it, we the consumers are getting ripped off.  And while ""Million Dollar Duck"" may be a lame film that will bore even the youngest of children into wanting to take a nap, it still should be presented in as fine a quality print as possible.  So, discriminating DVDers, send Disney studios a message and continue to boycott any DVD that has not been presented in the proper aspect ratio and format.  And that goes double for WHV, Paramount, MGM/UA, Universal and Columbia, all of whom are trying to dupe the public by dumping rotten prints of their older titles on DVD with little more than flashy new packaging.

This is getting sooooo frustrating.

By the way, how bad is this film?  Let's put it this way, in the '70's, Disney used to re-release its live-action films every couple of years, whether first-run or to add to a current release as the second-half of a double bill.  Not ""Million Dollar Duck"".  After it's initial 1971 release, it disappeared for a couple of years before appearing on Disney's ""Wonderful World of Disney"" as a two-part ""movie of the week"".  So, even kids of the day took a pass on a film that, if anything, looks worse today than it did back then.  Especially in its present VHS/DVD print.  Ugghh.

Film and DVD:  * (out of *****)",1112486400,10,1966,4.646376811594203

2001458,5,B0001HAFIO,"Wow, I used to think this was the funniest movie when I was a kid! Sandy Duncan and Dean Jones were always great!

Everything from that Eugene character to that farmer who demanded ""Hep me get these ducks back in the pen!"" LOL! Too funny.

If you're wanting a little 'value added' with Italian and German dubs (ie. learning those langs and want to hear familiar dialog by native speakers), and have a multi region or Region 2 DVD player, search amazon.de for ""Die Millionen-Dollar-Ente."" You can select whether you want to hear the movie with English, Italian or German speech before you play the movie.

Most people in America don't realize how enriching their DVD experience can be, since the industry only bundles the english track on the discs sold here. You MUST have a ""Region Free"" or ""Region 2"" (sold in Europe & UK) to play the German DVD. Thank the movie industry for wanting to control what you watch and how you watch it. (And to think of the hundreds of dollars Americans spend on tape sets to hear dialog by native speakers in another language.)
I rate this one an 8 1/2 of 10 on the ""Rewatchability"" scale.",1110585600,17,1121,4.53960396039604

Although not being as good as other cult movies like The Gnome-Mobile, this movie is very cute and underrated. Dean Jones plays a geeky scientist whose son's pet duck lays golden eggs. The family is overjoyed to have their own money-making machine, but stuff gets out of hand with their nosy old neighbor, who works for the US Government. This is a very underrated family movie that I think should finally get some respect.",1087171200,3,498,4.670454545454546

All of which want to cash in on the golden eggs and spend the money.  The tender story is the boy just want to Love the duck. Great Movie!  Especially when the dogs start chasing the duck.

2001489,3,B0001HAFIO,"The epitome (not the first) of the shopping cart movie. Seems all the ingredients are there: A fantastical MacGuffin, Dean Jones and Joe Flynn, a car chase, animal humor, leftover lessons for Dad from Mary Poppins, ignored unethical behaviour (cheating on taxes in this case, though the IRS jumps the gun before the characters have an opportunity to actually declare their gains,) etc.

The free money element is actually reminiscent of The Great Rupert and Money Doesn't Grow On Trees (or whatever that movie was actually titled.) With a surprising reference to Nixon, and sexist attitudes (people automatically disbelieve and laugh at the story when ditsy Sandy Duncan tells it,) and a not-very-serious look at the consequences of artificial gold in the world market.

We actually saw this in 1971 when first released at a Drive-In, and I remembered that at the end I was in full sympathy with the runaway duck kid and the young boys in their hot rod. A generation later, I was in sympathy with Dean Jones' Dad character and thought the hot-rod kids were jerks, nothing there really to identify with.",1448236800,,1102,4.919354838709677

2001508,5,B0001HAFIO,"It's a wholesome movie about the importance of family over wealth, in the madcap comedic style which I so enjoy from Disney of the 60s and 70s.  Dean Jones is a great everyman and was a staple of Disney's movies of that era.  The one thing I find annoying in the movie is that his wife is portrayed as very ditsy, but that characteristic vanishes about halfway through.  I like the story.  Radiation gives the duck of research scientist Albert Dooley (Dean Jones) the ability to lay golden eggs.  Eventually the government finds out, and by a coincidence so silly it's actually enjoyable, his suspicious neighbor (Joe Flynn) works for the Treasury Dept. and goes through some awkward attempts to try to get the duck.  I think the vehicle chase scene toward the end is stimulating and well-done.

I only gave it 3 stars because the only part that held their attention was the wild duck chase involving the cars near the end.

2001534,5,B0001HAFIO,"This one is up there among Disney's best screwball comedies from the 70s!
Dean Jones, Sandy Duncan, Tony Roberts and Joe Flynn are a superb mix of comic timing, slapstick humor and memorable one-liners.  (I think this is one of Sandy Duncan's funniest roles ever - charmingly dumb, yet wisely observant, funny, cute, witty...  She has some of the best lines.)
The film's story is such a ridiculous fairytale premise, but the actors are all in, and they pull the audience with their enthusiastic performances.  They make it look like the film was a lot of fun to make.",1403740800,,567,4.707070707070707

2001538,5,B0001HAFIO,"Sandy Duncan (scatter brain wife), Dean Jones (he is just made for these types of movies) & Joe Flynn (he is a real nut - fantastic comic; remember McHale's Navy) are the main players in the movie.  Due to radiation, a looser duck starts laying gold eggs.  These eggs leads to lots of unforeseen problems: government, greed & just plan silliness.

2001556,5,B0001HAFIO,Our family watched this movie and enjoyed the theme of what's more important: family or money.  This was a cute movie with a lot of laughs and just enough suspense for the younger ones in the family to be nervous about what would happen next.

The wife wasn't too smart.  Rebellious ""teenagers"" who - SPOILER ALERT - nearly got the kid killed. It's a really dumb movie.",1354233600,3,277,4.48
2001569,3,B0001HAFIO,This is a cute movie although not one of my favorites. You can really see the difference in the script writing then compared to now. Dean Jones and Sandy Duncan do a good job of acting.,1349395200,,185,4.166666666666667
2001570,3,B0001HAFIO,"This is one of a suite of slapstick, goofball Disney live-action family comedies from the era of Cat from Outer Space.  Fans of Sandy Duncan, and kids who laugh out loud at animal movies, (and anyone who named their cat ""Zunar-J-5/9 Doric-4-7"") will get a kick out of this. Anyone else might want to get a good book to read while its on (not a bad way to spend family time on a rainy day as far as I'm concerned).  We enjoy downloading these movies from Amazon Video On Demand -- it's nothing I would spend $15 on for a DVD, but it's a good short-term distraction for the kids and welcome break from much of what's on t.v. these days. My kids laugh the goose and dog jokes for days.",1346803200,4,682,4.198473282442748

This film contains timeless comedy, the determined IRS agents, behavioral scientists studying the learning capacities of various animals, beatniks with dune buggies, parents struggling to pay the bills, and a duck that lays some special eggs... Igt surely has to be a strong ""G"" rating thru and thru... and keeps you going with the action and laughs. This will surely be a prized addition to my collection of movies from my youth. If you like a little silliness and good clean entertainment, then I'm sure you'll enjoy it as well - Note: The sound is in Mono which is a bit of a culture shock with todays' audio offerings...",1316822400,,799,4.755395683453237

It's a cute little movie in the same formula as most of the Disney films of this time with Dean Jones.  The kids will like it, the pace moves along and you get a few good laughs.  Mostly it is a good film to watch with the kids or grandkids or in my case grandparents and enjoy something lighthearted with no social implications.  I liked That Darn Cat a little better.",1311120000,,515,4.11

2001590,5,B0001HAFIO,"Ah, Disney's Million Dollar Duck. Yes, it's famous as a prime example of Disney's 70's cheese and one of the only three films critic Gene Siskel walked out on. Well, Gene Siskel can eat it, because this movie rocks!

Dean Jones, in my opinion, one of the greatest actors ever, stars as a research scientist, husband, and father who is barely scraping by on his meager income. That is, until one of his lab animals, a misfit duck, eats a strange mixture and wanders into another lab, accidentally becoming radiated. An alchemist's dream come true, the duck then begins to lay eggs with solid gold yolks! The scientist, whose name is Albert Dooley, becomes aware of this, as does his lawyer friend, Fred (Tony Roberts), who becomes his financial partner. With the help of Albert's dizzy wife, Katie, the Dooleys' financial situation starts looking up. But not so successfully blossoming is Albert's relationship with his young son, Jimmy, who is becoming invisible due to his father's gold fever. Another, some would say more serious problem comes up too, as the gold buyers Mrs. Dooley has been selling the egg yolks to decide to inform the government of their strange new acquisitions. Soon, the Dooley's have the U.S. Treasury Department after them, and there's no telling how things will turn out in the end. Though, being a Disney comedy, it's safe to assume it will all work out alright.

That's the story, but how is the movie? Well, like I said, I LOVE it! It's cheesy at times, sure. It has a few moments when the script is just terrible. One scene that comes to mind is when the lawyer/friend character of Fred basically feels he has to explain the joke he is acting out. Something to the effect of, ""What am I doing? A grown man with a law degree crawling around on his hands and knees looking for a duck that lays golden eggs?!"" Yeah, it's funnier if you don't try to tell us it's funny, Fred. Nevertheless, the fantasy of acquiring your own money/gold-making machine, so to speak, is so universal that it is easy to get lost in the corny story with its corny characters. Plus, the little, gold egg yolks just look so cool! Sandy Duncan as Katie Dooley may be so stupid that it's brain numbing, but she's still very entertaining (heck of a bod back then too), and ya gotta love Joe Flynn (playing a nosy-neighbor/government stoolpigeon here) doing what he does best in all these classic Disney 70's comedies. Is ""Million Dollar Duck"" a silly film? Undoubtedly. Is it delightful? Yes. Granted, there is a nostalgia factor for me. I loved the film on the Disney Channel growing up. However, I did recently show this one to someone else who had never seen it before, an adult, and that person enjoyed it greatly too. If you LIKE silly, pretty wholesome comedies with a slight fantasy element in the mix, this is a great one, and I recommend the other Disney comedies of the seventies (and earlier) too, especially the Dexter Riley films, the Herbie the Love Bug films, and the Shaggy Dog and Shaggy D.A.! They're all great fun!

A final word on the DVD itself. Like many (or should I say most?) Disney live-action DVD releases, this DVD is completely barebones. It's not in widescreen, but of course, the proper framing of Disney classics is often in question, and this is one that doesn't seem to be losing much picture to whatever cropping might have been done. So, yeah, not much else to say about it. All you get here is the movie, but it's still a must for my collection.",1247443200,9,3483,4.623586429725363
