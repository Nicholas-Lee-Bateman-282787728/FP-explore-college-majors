1588,1,0307142477,"This horrible mess should have never been made...terrible story, awful music, dreadful animation (I use the term lightly), nasty characters, devoid of any warmth or charm...just awful, awful, awful.  This has nothing to do with Christmas or any other holiday for that matter.  Stick to the charming ""Frosty the Snowman"" and it's sequel, ""Frosty's Winter Wonderland"" where Frosty gets a wife.  Shame on Golden Books for including this with the original Frosty. Wish I could rate this a ZERO but I wasn't given that option.",1037664000,3,521,5.105882352941176
1589,1,0307142477,"I hated this special.  Frosty is completely sarcastic and obnoxious, nothing like the friendly folksy Frosty we all grew to love.  Even sadder is that CBS keeps airing this back-to-back with the original Frosty.  There are so many other great Christmas specials which aren't aired on the major networks (Little Drummer Boy, George C. Scott's A Christmas Carol) because of cable and VCRs.  So it's all the more sad that this one receives yearly attention by a major network.  Couldn't they at least air the true sequel - Frosty's Winter Wonderland?  ABC used to run that one, so I don't know who owns the rights nowadays.  But either way, that would make much sense for a second half hour of Frosty rather than this dreadful piece of unwatchable junk.",983836800,5,750,4.767441860465116
1590,1,0307142477,This is so lame! The songs are terrible! The villan is a ripoff of Mr. Burns from The Simpsons while the kids look like they're on loan from a Charlie Brown show. But the biggest lowpoint is the Politically Correct ranting! Too bad CBS insists on running this back-to-back with the 1969 classic.,976233600,3,295,4.584905660377358
1591,1,0307142477,"This is with out a doubt is one of the worst Christmas movies I have ever seen!  My daughter liked it because it had a snowman in it, but that's the only reason.  The movie is filled with overdone, unrealistic, trite political issues of the 90's.  It was too complicated for a small child to follow and there was barely even a plot.  Only get this if your child is in love with snowmen and you've exhausted all other viewing avenues.  There was nothing original in this movie that wasn't absurd.  The original Frosty is so wonderfully simple, buy that one instead.",975888000,3,564,4.480392156862745
1592,2,0307142477,"""Frosty Returns"" is the epitome of why classics from the 60s and 70s need not be remade.  Although Jonathan Winters does a respectable job as narrator, the story suffers from ""politically correct"" environmentalism and de-Christianization of Christmas.  None of it was necessary and detracts the story.
Furthermore, there is no artistic continuity with the original ""Frosty"".  None of the characters are depicted in their original form and the computer-aided animation doesn't really add anything, either.
I was disappointed that this episode was included with the Frosty DVD.  The true and worthy sequel to the original Frosty is ""Frosty's Winter Wonderland"".  Watch that instead as it is MUCH better than this one.",975369600,6,715,5.405405405405405

1594,1,0307142477,"I just watched this sad excuse for a cartoon for the first time after viewing the original classic Frosty the Snowman. All I could think was is this country in trouble. Simply put the movie was worse than anything I could have ever imagined. It is an insult to the original cartoon. This is the result you get when left wing communist atheists attempt to destroy our American culture and traditions. How often do you hear any commercials on television or radio mention Christmas anymore? The term Christmas is practically banned from the public airwaves. I say boycott any business that refuses to use the term Christmas in their advertising. Thank god there are some of us old enough to remember what this country and it's traditions use to be like. It was at one time the greatest country in the world, currently being destroyed by the communist enemy within. I fear for the future of this Country. And in closing I must add, who ever heard of a winter carnival? I can say with confidence that this cartoon caused Jimmy Durante to turn over in his grave. An absolute disgrace.",1166918400,,1078,4.649214659685864
1595,4,0307142477,"I caught this on CBS back to back with the original Rankin Bass version. The original served to remind me why I loved it so much as a kid, and I better appreciated some of the story's depth than I could as a child. Leading into ""Frosty's Return,"" My stomach knotted with dread... not another vile sequel; or worse yet, a bargain-bin knockoff... But I was pleasantly surprised by a weird and surreal spin on the Frosty mythos. From the moment a tiny Jonathan Winters appears in the snow, I had to see what was going to happen next. This version plays on the innocent wittiness of ""old school"" classic specials, but has some nice weird touches, like tiny Jonathan Winters floating on a marshmallow in a cup of hot cocoa. There are some cute ""tip-o'-the-hat"" in-jokes on other animated specials, too, with some clever (not disrespectful) riffs on the Peanuts cartoons, among others. There are some delicious non-sequitors that had me laughing out loud, but it never takes on that awful, dated ""hipness"" that contemporary animated fare falls into (like Disney's ""Hercules"" ... blecch!)

Being a Heathen, I loved that this ""Frosty"" did not beat me over the head with yet another gloss of the Nativity tale. (Nor did the Rankin Bass original, for that matter.) There was a nice environmental message that wasn't overplayed, and even a reference to the ancient, pagan concept of Yule being a step in nature's cycle, with the promise of life's renewal.

Overall, weird and fun!",1134864000,,1469,4.8023715415019765
1596,1,0307142477,"This waste of time was shown on network immidiately following the original.  Bad music, dated cheesy dialogue, and nothing to do with the original story.",1134777600,3,153,5.12
1597,1,0307142477,"First, the story and songs are weak.  Second, Christmas isn't even mentioned.  The directors have fallen for the left wing anti-Christmas agenda, resulting in the kids school having a ""Winter Carnival"" instead.  Pathetic.  The real Frosty would melt with anger.",1134518400,3,261,5.45
1598,4,0307142477,"As long as you know BEFORE you buy it that ""Frosty Returns"" is not the sequel to ""Frosty the Snowman"", you can see it without complaint. It is a different story, and has nothing to do with the original Frosty TV Special. First of all it is made by a different studio, with different animators, directors, and voices. The director is Bill Melendez, who directed all of the Charlie Brown, Snoopy, and Peanuts specials, so it looks like a Peanuts cartoon. Made in 1992. The voice acting features Jonathon Winters, and it has John Goodman as Frosty. The songs are original and pretty fun. The plot is centered on the folks in town that want clean streets in winter by getting all the snow removed. The kids and Frosty are in a panic and fight back or else they will lose all their snow fun - and snow men. If you approach this show knowing it is not the sequel and is from the team that made the Peanuts shows, you will be OK.

IF YOU ARE ALSO INTERESTED IN THE REAL SEQUEL: The studio that made the first hour long Frosty special that first aired on CBS television in 1969 is Rankin/Bass Productions, the kings of holiday specials. That show was based on the original song written in 1951 by Steve nelson and Jack Rollins. The studio made a terrific half hour sequel in 1976 for ABC television titled ""Frosty's Winter Wonderland"".  That special starts right where the first one left off.  The basic premise of the story is that Frosty gets a wife named Crystal (played by Shelley Winters), and is sabotaged by the jealous Jack Frost. The character design was by Paul Coker Jr., who did the same work for the first special, so the visual continuity works very well and the characters have that classic Rankin/Bass 'look'. He also did the unique lettering for the credits in both specials. The famous voice actor Paul Frees stars as Jack Frost, and the policeman. Frees was a regular in studio productions and had also voiced the policeman, ticket seller, and Santa Claus in the original. Jackie Vernon voiced Frosty just like he did before. The writer for both Rankin/Bass shows was Romeo Muller, and Maury Laws returned as the musical director. Interestingly, while Rankin/Bassis known for the high quality of their original songs, they used Christmas standards in their sequel.  The major change in the sequel from the original is a big one, the narrator, and it can be unsettling if you watch them back to back.  While the first show was narrated and sung by Jimmy Durante, the second time we had the voice talents of Andy Griffith. Nothing against Andy, but it is a big change.

AND ANOTHER SEQUEL: Another sequel of sorts was made by Rankin/Bass with the same production team, it is a theatrical feature length movie released in 1979 titled ""Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July"".",1133827200,3,2783,4.634888438133874

7787877,1,0307142477,"Growing up, I watched the original ""Frosty the Snowman"" and its true sequel, ""Frosty's Winter Wonderland,"" every year.  By the time Frosty Returns arrived in 1992, I was in high school and didn't make the time to watch it.  In fact, I never had gotten around to watching it until this year when it was part of a set I received for free.  Now that I've seen it, I can skip it in the future.

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas in the town of Beansboro.  In fact, the first snowfall of the year is happening, and that means the Winter Carnival is right around the corner.  This year, magician Holly (Elisabeth Moss) is determined to win the talent show.  She's a bit of an anti-social little girl, but she does have one friend in Charles (Michael Patrick Carter).

But she makes another when she finds Frosty (John Goodman) on the outskirts of town.  They meet just before Mr. Twitchell (Brian Doyle-Murray) arrives on the scene.  Mr. Twitchell has just invented Summer Wheeze, a spray can that melts snow and makes it seem like summer.  Everyone gets on board, including the kids who go from loving snow to hating it in five minutes.  With Frosty now in dangerous territory, it's up to Holly to save the day.  Will she have the courage of her convictions?

What went right?  Jonathan Winters is the narrator, and adds some warmth and charm to the proceedings, which they badly needed.  A few moments are fun, and the overall messages of standing up for what is right as well as respecting the environment are fine.

What went wrong?  Where do I even begin.

To start with, Frosty no longer needs a magic hat.  Yes, he still has it most of the time, but he takes it off a couple of times and it doesn't affect him at all.  I'm sorry, that's like Superman not being affected by Kryptonite.

I recognized Bill Melendez in the opening credits.  Since he has worked on just about all the Peanuts shorts, I thought it would be a good thing.  His handy work is everywhere.  Many of the characters look like they belong in a Peanuts short.  And there is the boy names Charles.  But I found that more of a distraction, especially since the characters looked like such a hodgepodge of styles.  Teacher Miss Carbuncle looks too much like Maxine from the Hallmark cards, for example.

As I hinted above, I found the story pretty lame.  In the opening song, the kids are excited about the first snow of the season while the adults are complaining about the work.  It was fun, as a non-snow lover, I could see the point.  But within just a few minutes, all the kids are hating snow just as much if not more than parents.  I know they only had 30 minutes, but that was just way too fast to be believable.

After that opening number, the songs went downhill and are completely forgettable.

Then there's the moral.  I think we need to protect the environment, and as much as I love summer and wish we had it year round, know we need all four seasons for a healthy Earth.  (And yes, we do have four seasons in Southern California.)  But I don't turn on a Christmas special to be preached at.  Honestly, I don't like any story that preaches to me, but here it was so obviously the only point of the piece that I was turned off by it.

Oh yeah, and if this is a Christmas special, why is Christmas only mentioned once?

This special is almost always coupled with the original Frosty on TV and DVD, leaving the original, better sequel forgotten.  That's a shame because there is very little reason to ever watch Frosty Returns.",1431388800,,3515,4.436619718309859
7787878,1,0307142477,"I'm this username's wife, and I don't think I've ever reviewed anything here. But this is so bad, I just had to. Jon Goodman, who's been a really popular voice over actor for kids' movies lately, is just AWFUL in this. In all fairness, he didn't have much to work with -- the writing is terrible. I think it tries to be hip and modern with trendy references to microwave pancakes and fertility goddesses, but it totally misses. And the music? I can't even find the words. Bad music with bad lyrics sung by actors who CANNOT SING (Goodman, stick to acting, please!) Unfortunately, my kids love this dvd and watch it back to back with the original Frosty all year long. I can't wait till they outgrow this phase because it just grates on me! I just don't get what they see in it. Makes me want to ""lose"" the DVD!!!!",1328054400,2,813,4.355263157894737

7787881,1,0307142477,"Okay.  Sat down to watch this for the first time with my son figuring that it would be good ole' Frosty with a new storyline.  Wrong.  We got about 5 minutes into it and I realized that someone had hi-jacked a kids character and storyline and replaced it with greeny, pagan propaganda.  First, one of the little boys says ""Let's go outside and make a fertility goddess"".  I'm like.....what the.....what the ....what is this doing in a kids Christmas time animated classic?  Then the fact that Frosty doesn't need his magic hat anymore.  Then the obvious corporate knocking message about a snow eliminating spray.  That was it.  Turned it off and instead put in the original Rankin-Bass classic.  This one is going to get hung in the window as a sun catcher, that is all it is good for.",1198108800,11,785,4.58273381294964
7787882,1,0307142477,I was disappointed when I saw how it had nothing to do with the lovable Original classic. I thought maybe its my maturity setting in - but my 3 and 2 year old  basically gave this a bad review - they walked off after a few minutes into the story - too uninterested. I think the target audience is wrong in this one.

7787883,1,0307142477,I wish I had never seen this. I didn't realize it wasn't a follow up to the original Frosty. It's a shame it was done by the same person who gave us the charming Peanuts classics.,1197331200,3,179,4.0
7787884,1,0307142477,"Narration is OK but the story is weak and the songs are brilliantly unremarkable. I cringed when I watched this with my son. I admit I grew up with the original show with Jimmy Durante narrating and the title song a well written classic, rather than a lame paean to 1990's PC themes. This is probably inevitable in that you unfortunately can't re-make something from that era with the same innocence and feel: not in an era where Christmas has become lifeless. Oops! I said Christmas, I meant Happy Holidays!",1196553600,2,508,4.655555555555556
