7905985,4,B00000EZU9,My daughter found these and thought they were great for using while studying and provided just enough visual distraction to enhance her creativity!  My dentist uses them in the waiting room and swears it has a valuable calming effect on patients.,1403222400,,246,5.0
7905986,5,B00000EZU9,"This dvd is getting a bum rap (poor rating) but it should not. It does need more info, that it is all classical orchestral music.  Marvelous entire movements of standard classic pieces paired with beautiful videos.  (There are no other audio options)  It's a real value - I was really glad to find it. I have rented from my library in the past, but would not hesitate to purchase or recommend to my clients (excellent for people who have Alzheimer's and so can't follow a storyline)",1355616000,,482,4.5813953488372094
7905987,1,B00000EZU9,"This has to be one of the Worst items I've seen . Beautiful photography ruined by a
terrible Soundtrack . Item is supposed to be for meditation and relaxation but while
watching the music sound wants to make you throw something at the T.V.
Why would one think the sounds of blaring horns, booming drums and crashing cymbals would be relaxing ?",1271721600,2,343,4.548387096774194
