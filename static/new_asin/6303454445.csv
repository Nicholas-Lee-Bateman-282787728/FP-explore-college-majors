7847394,4,6303454445,"Three VHS casettes with Terminator on ONE, T2 on TWO and Special features on THREE. Well worth the money I paid for this collectible set and for those who don't know, VHS is making a comeback. Great material on casette THREE including trailers.
The only gripe I had was it was listed as 'Near New' and should have been rated good condition instead. However, it's a great collector's gem and I can't complain too much. You won't find this anywhere else for this price and you have Amazon.com backing it up. I think you'll enjoy this set if there are any left.",1397001600,,558,4.480392156862745
7847395,5,6303454445,"Writer/director James Cameron's original Terminator film has Arnold Schwarzenegger as a cyborg sent back in time to 1984. He's programmed to kill Sarah Connor before she can give birth to a son who is destined to lead survivors in a post-apocalyptic war against a self-aware computer network and its army of killing machines.

In an example of the future affecting the past, John Connor, Sarah's adult son, dispatches a trusted aide named Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to protect her from the nearly indestructible cyborg. Sarah bonds with Kyle in their mutual struggles. They make love and thus John is conceived.

THE TERMINATOR was a huge summer hit, grossing $78 million worldwide in first run vs. a $6 million cost. Its sequel, TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY was long in coming, but well-worth the seven year wait. In almost every respect, this sci-fi thriller surpasses its predecessor. The concept of TWO terminators in the story equalling twice the film just may be true, thanks in large part to Robert Patrick's grimly determined T-1000 prototype, a superior poly-alloy mechanism capable of morphing into anybody (or thing?).

Sarah (Linda Hamilton), who was understandably confused and terrified in the first movie is now confident, buff from working out, and ready for the coming conflagration. Her only obstacle is confinement in a prison-like psych ward. Arnold returns as Cyberdyne model 101, but this time his mission is to protect, not kill Sarah, and especially young John (Edward Furlong). Again, the unseen adult John is trying to make sure he lives in the pre-machine war past, and Arnold is his weapon and shield against a superior cyborg. The battle between the two terminators is epic and to the death.

Both ""Terminator"" and ""T2"" are enhanced by brilliant Industrial Light & Magic special effects and the mechanical wizardry of Stan Winston. The pace of both is breathless, the sense of danger unflagging, and the action, mesmerizing.

These are two great movies!
