8371086,2,B002IREXII,"This wasn't what I was expecting. I thought that it would be more of the Hollywood movies that I was used to seeing, but all they were was some sort of European flicks. Frankly the 1st one was unwatchable because of the way it was recorded. I'm not sure what was wrong but it sort of looked squashed from the top down and it bothered my eyes so that I finally gave up trying to look at it and turned it off. Frankly also, I wouldn't waste your money just because the cover is slick.",1422921600,,482,4.08421052631579
