Never received word or any refund from sender !Was out shipping cost and original DVD cost ?  I certaainly wouldn't recommend anyone order Out of Ireland....period !",1284076800,,307,4.773584905660377
671028,5,630353693X,"I purchased this dvd after reading the book to get a further understanding of it all. I had a personal interest and chose the topic ""irish emigration"" for a research paper for a college sociology class. I must say it is put together very well and crammed with a chock full of information. The letters sent home from immigrants expressing their own personal experiences in America give it a nice, personal touch. I enjoyed this dvd very much. Anyone who has an interest or research need should not hesitate to purchase this item, it will be very useful. I read one review about a teacher who was disappointed her 5,6,7 year old students found it boring. I must say this is a mature material. I don't know of any small children who would find the history of Ireland or emigration interesting so i say the fault was on her. A+ rating.",1260835200,20,831,4.509933774834437
671029,5,630353693X,It really kept me glued to the TV . I really enjoyed this DVD because of it's honesty and all the pictures and letters.,1249171200,,119,4.0
671030,1,630353693X,"I ordered this DVD with high hopes. As it is entitled ""Out of Ireland"", I thought it might address the issue of Irish immigration with some depth in a manner that would interest, mostly, fourth graders. In fact, it ignores the controversy that once existed in this country regarding the influx of the Irish. There are strange clips of what my son described as ""some old guy singing boring stuff nobody can understand."" I suppose the bits of musical interlude were meant to add something artistic or nostalgic to the movie. Unfortunately, they slowed the ""action"" and didn't add anything to the understanding of the subject. I was so bored I began to feel weepy with frustration. I did not subject my class to it.",1215302400,3,712,4.704
671031,5,630353693X,"I RECENTLY PURCHASED BOTH DVD'S FROM AMAZON AND ENJOYED BOTH AND WILL CONTINUE MY ASSOCIATION WITH AMAZON,WHO HAS PROVEN SATISFICATION WITH MY IRISH DVD'S",1215302400,,154,5.458333333333333
671032,4,630353693X,"The journey of Irish men and women forced from their own homeland to avoid starvation, religious discrimination and slavery by the British. Even when arriving to America they were treated as second class citizens and forced  to fight in Lincolns' dirty little war. It's the story how an uneducated  group of people who were once slaves, helped build a great nation, ran  major cities built great canals and populated the country side. It's a must  for any Irishman Or woman to pass down to their children to keep the  history of the green alive. Also pick up the soundtrack to this DVD it's  great too.",936230400,65,602,4.685714285714286
671033,5,630353693X,"The video ""Out of Ireland"" narrated by Kelly McGills presents a very informative and an excellent historical overview of the experiences of the Irish in both the United States and Ireland.  The story makes an  extensive overview of the good and bad events surrounding the lives of  Irish Americans beginning with the Battle of the Boyne and culmunating with  an examination of Irish men and women who braved the trip over on not very  sea worthy ships to start a new life in America.  Every aspect is examined  in detail with the use of top Irish and Irish American historians, some of  which are unfortunately no longer with us.  This tape would be an excellent  addition to any library and would be an excellent learning tool to use in  American, World, or Cultural Geography course.",918086400,72,785,4.7407407407407405
671156,5,630353693X,"Very good. It's largely standard PBS documentary style. But the careful attention to individuals on both sides of the migration (in Ireland and in US) gives this a good tone. It's a couple of decades old now, but holds up well. In fact, it's rather better than more recent and argumentative documentaries.",1446163200,,305,4.884615384615385
671157,5,630353693X,"The movie is a great way to begin studying my heritage.  It gave me new perspective on the diaspora.  I also learned more about the Irish impact on Roman Catholic institutions in America.  I enjoyed learning about women experiencing financial independence due to working for families ""in service.""  I also enjoyed learning about the locations where the Irish dispersed to in the U.S. and why.  I plan to watch the movie again.  I will also recommend it to my relatives.",1439769600,3,469,4.8

671159,3,630353693X,"Out of Ireland did a great job as it focused on the experiences of eight specific immigrants.

671265,5,630353693X,"My Irish great-great grandfather immigrated to the United States before the Civil War. He fought in that war and lost an eye and later went totally blind due to his injuries. People forget that the different ethnic groups that immigrated to the U.S.faced all types of discrimination and privation. The Irish, Italians, Jews and Hispanics all had their unique challenges in gaining acceptance, but they persevered. By the third generation, due to their own pluck, effort and sacrifice, they. were attending some of the best schools in the land without the benefit of affirmative action. This series documents the Irish, but other series document the successes of the other ethnic groups. This CD is a wonderful visual and auditory tribute to the efforts and individual success of the Irish in this wonderful country",1365811200,2,814,5.12781954887218
