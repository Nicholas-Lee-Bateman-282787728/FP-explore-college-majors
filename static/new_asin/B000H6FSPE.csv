8136929,3,B000H6FSPE,"This DVD is composed of thow parts.

1/ How to make the frames

2/ How to make the panels.

Graham Blackburn seems to be a fan of handtool so expect for some very short interruptions in the lesson showing you that you can do the work with a machine, everything described is done with hand tools (including antique moulding plane and a stanley 45).

Each part is only 20 minutes or so so there is no time to get into any details. This is particularly true for the section on panels which barely give you an overview of some of the styles you can find with very few hands on.

If you are a newbie and expect to know how to build frame and panel style constuction after viewing this DVD you'd better stay away.",1174694400,4,707,4.207407407407407
