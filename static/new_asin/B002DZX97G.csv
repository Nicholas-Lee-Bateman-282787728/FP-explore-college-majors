8366553,5,B002DZX97G,"Quite surprised to see only two reviews posted on this excellent collection offered by DG, so the least I can do is to add another 5 star to this true gem.

For the most part, I would echo reviews from T. Jolles. A few more thoughts on the operas, as those were the main attraction to me.

1. Carmen. Simply love it. Great visual and audio. Grace Bumbry is incredibly beautiful and alluring in her portrait of Carmen, both vocally and visually. Freni is both noble and vulnerable in Miceala. Not sure I like Vickers as Don, but his voice is glorious, as always. I had watched the Baltsa/Carerras Carmen before, quite different performances, but both are very enjoyable.

2. Don Giovanni. What can I say, it's such a blessing to have a great performance captured in such good form. All characters are very convincing in their singing and acting. Wilhelm Furtwangler is just great.

3. Traviata. Production is quite modern and interesting. Netrebko's singing may not be the best available, but she created a quite convincing Violetta.

4. Die Walkure and Rosenkavalier. Gwyneth Jones is fantastic in both performances, I'd say both characters are quite demanding vocally, but she truly delivered.

5. All others are excellent performances too. Especially liked requiem, hearing those great voices in their prime simply brings tears to my eyes.

Bottom line is, don't miss it, truly great performances, wish DG and other labels can provide more offerings like this.",1299024000,2,1462,4.942857142857143
8366554,4,B002DZX97G,"These all region discs, playable worldwide, feature 22-1/2 hours of opera, dance, and concert videos from the Deutsche Grammophon catalogue, and while I haven't found the time to watch them all, there's nothing here that strikes me as a bad choice for this anthology. Like the other ""DG 111"" limited edition sets, ""11 Great Videos"" is a musical grab bag, but an inspired one, at least if you're not too upset by DG's decision to ignore piano recitals and chamber music on film.

Disc 1: ""The Making of West Side Story"" (1985)
""In 1985, 27 years after its Broadway premiere, Leonard Bernstein went into a New York studio for Deutsche Grammophon to conduct his most famous work for the first time."" Kiri Te Kanawa, Jose Carreras, and Tatiana Troyanos sing; Christopher Swann directs.

Disc 2: Beethoven: Piano Concertos 3 & 5 (1977/78)
A youthful Maurizio Pollini joins Karl Bohm and the Vienna Philharmonic in two perfectly good performances no better and no worse than dozens of other Beethoven concerto recordings. It's the exquisite slow movements, which Pollini and Bohm play with sensitivity and taste, that I want to hear over again.

Disc 3: ""Carmen"" (1967)
Bizet's glorious music supports the tale of a priggish mamma's boy driven over the edge by a slut. Grace Bumbry, Jon Vickers, and Mirella Freni sing the leads, while Herbert von Karajan conducts the orchestra, directs the film crew, and ""artistically supervises.""

Disc 4: Mozart: Violin Concertos 4 & 5 (2005)
Anne-Sophie Mutter, in a stunning blue dress, appears as soloist and conductor, playing Mozart's gorgeous D major and A major concertos before a rapt audience at the Salzberg Mozarteum.

Disc 5: ""Don Giovanni"" (1954)
Paul Czinner's film looks and sounds pretty good for its age, except for some weirdly shaky and out of focus camerawork on the Stone Guest. Wilhelm Furtwangler conducts the Vienna Philharmonic in a typically portentous performance, with Cesare Siepi in the title role.

Discs 6 & 7: ""Der Rosenkavalier"" (1979)
What starts off as a bedroom farce deepens into profound comedy with the Marschallin's almost Daoist realization that love is just another of life's transitory pleasures. Gwyneth Jones sings the Marschallin, with Brigitte Fassbaender as her young lover and Manfred Jungwirth as the boorish Baron Ochs; Carlos Kleiber conducts the Bayerisches Staatsorchester.

Disc 8: ""Swan Lake"" (1966)
Rudolf Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn dance the leads; John Lanchbery conducts the Wiener Symphoniker. Choreography by Nureyev.

Disc 9: ""La Traviata"" (2005)
This is the acclaimed Salzberg Festival production featuring Anna Netrebko, Rolando Villazon, and a giant clock center stage. Carlo Rizzi conducts the Vienna Philharmonic.

Disc 10: Verdi: Requiem Mass (1967)
Leontyne Price, Fiorenza Cossotto, Nicolai Ghiaurov, and a young Luciano Pavarotti are the soloists; Karajan conducts the chorus & orchestra of the Teatro alla Scala; and filmmaker Henri-Georges Clouzot, better known for his thrillers ""Diabolique"" and ""The Wages of Fear,"" directs.

Discs 11 & 12: ""Die Walkure"" (1980)
The year after being filmed as Strauss' Marschallin, Gwyneth Jones sang Brunnhilde in Patrice Chereau's then cutting edge production of the Ring cycle. Pierre Boulez conducts the Bayreuther Festspiele Orchestra.

Disc 13: ""Peter and the Wolf: A Prokofiev Fantasy"" (1993)
And what to make of this one? Everyone outgrows ""Peter and the Wolf,"" but this production, narrated by Sting and featuring puppet caricatures by the Spitting Image Workshop, gives us a hard-drinking Duck, the Marx Brothers as hunters, and Prokofiev himself (rather pointlessly) playing the part of the Grandfather, even though the actor portraying Prokofiev bears an uncanny physical resemblance to Shostakovich. The ""Classical Symphony"" performance is much more fun, featuring a frenetic 18th-century orchestra playing for a group of rowdy dinner guests including Beethoven, Wagner, Haydn, Bach, and Schubert.",1269302400,12,3952,5.388978930307942
8366555,5,B002DZX97G,"I'm surprised no reviews have been posted yet; usually I buy based on reviews of others on this site.
I'm a fanatic collector of music on CD's, which is a breeze now with all the box offerings; a lot of CD's and all my lp's had to be replaced after a big hurricane-LUIS-in 1995; my sons and my wife advise downloading, but I love my boxes; DVD's also became cherished collection items but were sometimes disappointing,sometimes exciting-Georg Solti:the Maestro.
This offering is superb and my review is just to advise you not to miss the opportunity to get this collection at this great price; most of these DVD's are available on Amazon for at least $19 each and have received generally good-excellent reviews.
I tried to sample all DVD's but didn't have the time yet because of the need to see some of them again and again.
1.the making of West Side Story: beautiful singing-Kanewa (relaxed),Carreras(challenged)- trumpet playing- unidentified- and altogether very nice documentary with great portrait of Bernstein and interaction with great ensemble; saw it already 3 times. Now have to look for a complete performance.
2. Beethoven Piano Concerto 3 and 5; Pollini-Bohm: very good.
3. Carmen-Karajan: not seen yet; good reviews.
4. Mozart Violin concertoes 4&5-Mutter:very good with nice support of Salzburg Camerata which plays well despite the ""conducting"" by Mutter; different from the Oistrakh versions I prefer.
5. Don Giovanni-Furtwangler: incredibly good video; first time I saw this conductor of the old style; doesn't sound or looked old fashioned at all and is beautifully sung and acted by artists which are not very known anymore; better than my Karajan version of some later date (Ramey-Tomowa-Winbergh-
burchuladze etc)
6. Rosenkavalier-Kleiber: astounding; excellent video; more waltzing than in our recent visit to the Metropolitan opera, which was also a beautiful production with Renee Fleming; still very up to date in acting,screenplay and singing.
7. Swan Lake: Nureyev Fonteyn; never seen ballet DVD yet, but was glued to the screen with thso one: good video,nice music and performances by these dance legends; living on St. Maarten I know Nureyevs home on St. Barths.
8. Traviata-Rizzi;not seen; good reviews.
9. Requiem Verdi-Karajan; excellent; nice video of Karajan; I prefer this to-the also good- Abbados EMI version with Berliner Philarmoniker,Gheorghiu,Alagna e.a
10. Die Walkure-Boulez; should be interesting; I'm still dealing with Levine's ring on DVD and the Rings of Bohm and Solti on CD;
11. Prokofiev-Peter @ the wolf etc; very different but rewarding at repeated viewing.
