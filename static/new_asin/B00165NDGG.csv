8260971,4,B00165NDGG,"I found this video to be very helpful to me in learning some of the initial Poomse movements, particularly for when you leave class and can't quite remember what to do during practice.  From that perspective, this is an excellent training tool.

Movements are clean, crisp, and he never moves too quickly so that you lose what to do next.  The front and back views are very helpful, and thankfully, the cameramen weren't shifting angles or anything during the performances.  At first, I was hoping for a little more from the descriptions of each move, but on second thought, I think it's OK the way it is (basically the accompanying audio says things like ""Walking stance, middle punch"" and then goes on...very basic, but it would probably be tedious for more advanced viewers to have too much more).

The problem with this DVD is the navigation and the slightly obnoxious music that accompanies it.  There are four different parts to view for each poomse: one with pauses for simple descriptions of the movements, one with back view only, one with front view only, as well as informational screens.  Instead of linking them all-together so that you can watch them all the way through, you have to watch one, go back through the menu tree (with slightly obnoxious accompanying music), and then select the next.  If you forget where you started, and what you've already seen, then you're screwed.  Unfortunately, the ""play all"" option goes through only the front view (with no commentary) option.

This is a minor annoyance, but for a beginner, and someone who hates having to pick up the remote and go through the motions every minute and a half, it was enough for me to deduct one star.  Overall, however, this is a very good DVD and I would definitely recommend it to others.",1221091200,4,1777,4.755700325732899
