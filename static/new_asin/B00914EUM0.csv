It is both a sad story and yet one of hope, that people like this Island President exist and flourish for brief times in human history.

5231645,3,B00914EUM0,"For ""The Island President"", filmmaker Jon Shenk, who both directed and shot the film, and his crew followed President Mohamed ""Anni"" Nasheed of the Maldive Islands around for a year, as he crossed continents attempting to garner support for carbon emission targets. The Maldives are particularly concerned about climate change, as they are the lowest country in the world, consisting of about 1200 islands in 26 atolls, with an average ground level of 1.5 meters above sea level. Their highest point is only 2.4 meters above sea level. So citizens of the Maldives are concerned that their country will sink if sea levels rise significantly. They will be the first to go.

Shenk begins at the Copenhagen Climate Summit in December 2009, where Pres. Nasheed is campaigning for a target of 350 parts per million carbon in the Earth's atmosphere. Then the film backtracks to the Maldives' recent political history, told through interviews. The island saw its first truly democratic election in 2008, when Nasheed, a former political prisoner and democratic activist, was elected president. It spends about 20 minutes explaining the country's regime change from 30 years of rule by former President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom to the democratically elected Nasheed government (which fell in February 2012, after the film was made).

Jon Shenk had near-total access to Pres. Nasheed for the first year of his presidency. He went to policy meetings, into hotel rooms, and observed international politicking behind the scenes. This is the film's strength. We meet the Maldives' Foreign Minister Ahmed Naseem, Minister of Environment Mohamed Aslam, Deputy Undersecretary Aminath Shauna, the administration's British advisor on climate change Mark Lynas, and the President's media advisor Paul Roberts, also British.  We accompany the President on his first trip to the United States, where he attended a meeting of the Alliance of Small Island States. We even watch him try to convince India to reduce emissions.

The access to the Copenhagen Climate Summit is great. It's worth seeing the film just for that. Shenk and his crew obtained this unprecedented level of access in Copenhagen and at the UN by being part of the Maldivian delegation, a privilege which Pres. Nasheed generously granted them, instead of using press credentials. ""The Island President"" fails, however, to present much of a case for the Maldives' being in mortal danger or even to explain the facts as Pres. Nasheed or Mark Lynas see them. There are lots of beautiful pictures of the Maldives but almost no explanation of their geography or the relevant issues.

The impact of rising sea levels on the Maldives is, in fact, disputed. If the filmmakers are only going to present one point of view, okay, but they need to present it. What impact is which sea level predicted to have? What are the chances of that occurring? Where have sea levels been in the past? We are just shown some beach erosion. No science. Beach erosion can be caused by a lot of things. Monsoon season is coming earlier to the Maldives due to a change in winds. Changes in winds can cause erosion. The filmmakers seem to want us to panic over the Maldives' future based on some beach erosion, which has nothing to do with the issue. ""The Island President"" succeeds in giving us a peek at climate politics but fails utterly at providing an understanding of what, exactly, the Maldives fear and why.

The DVD (First Run Features 2012): There is a ""Q&A with Jon Shenk"" (24 min) in which the director discusses how he got access, what attracted him to the subject, what Copenhagen was like, and takes questions from the audience. ""Hilton Worldwide/Sundance Institute Lightstay Sustainability Award Video"" ( 3  min) is a video that was presumably shown when this award was presented. In it, Jon Shenk talks about the Maldives, the film, and the award. There are text bios of director Jon Shenk and 2 producers. The film is in English and Maldivian with English subtitles.",1353628800,5,3996,5.0

5231648,4,B00914EUM0,"I loved how I could stream this movie from Amazon. I have been trying to find this movie for a very long time! I finally found it! Though, the resolution from this stream is not that good, just being able to watch the movie when no other site has it, is awesome in itself! Thank You Amazon! God Bless You!

As for the movie, I think it covers a great deal about climate change and global warming. I think all the data was dead on and that I love how they showed beautiful footage of the Maldives and went into the history of the Maldives thirty years ago. I think that the world will need someone like president Nasheed to prevent the world from going under, unless we somehow find a way to live underwater or in space, then we truly need some like Nasheed. If I am spelling the name wrong, go ahead and correct me, but I have just got to say, for those who are majors in environmental science,politics, or meteorology, or who have a degree in these fields, this is a much watch film! Or those who are just want to know how to prevent global warming, know more about it, or the Maldives, I would still highly recommend this film!",1348963200,9,1129,4.251162790697674
5231649,5,B00914EUM0,"This is somewhat more than the usual ""environmentalist"" movie.  It is that, but also more.  I knew really nothing about the Maldives before I watched the movie.  What makes the Maldives, and former President Nasheed so significant, is that this is a nation of about 2000 islands (sort of southeast of the tip of India) with an average altitude of about 1.5 metres above sea level.  Therefore unfortunately, if the ocean level continues to rise as it probably will, this will be the first nation on earth to be completely eradicated--not just deeply affected but actually obliterated by climate change.
For thirty years it was a dictatorship, complete with fake elections.  Momentum for real democracy began building and then, after the great Asian tsunami did severe damage, suddenly tolerance for the ""President for life"" evaporated, and Nasheed was elected President.  He was exactly the right person, at the right place, at the right time, to draw the world's attention to the problem of global warming, his moment peaking at the Copenhagen conference.  Sadly, though an agreement was signed nothing was actually done.  The world is still waiting it seems, for some larger-scale disaster to finally mobilize into real action.  By then, it may be too late for the Maldives, a place which Nasheed describes as ""Paradise combined with....Paradise"".  The scenes, from the air, on land and under the water, truly are beautiful.
Nasheed observes that ""We are more than just a nation.  We are a civilization; we have our own language; people have lived here for at least 3,000 years--and is it all to be lost?""  Furthermore, at least for a time, it was a Moslem nation with a real democracy and peace [later a coup d'&eacute;tat forced him to resign, and the current political situation wasn't spelled out].  Trying to mobilize some action, Nasheed observes that if the Maldives go under, large parts of Manhattan will follow--and large parts of many coastal cities around the world...hundreds of millions of people may be displaced, often on top of other people often barely getting by as things currently stand.

It's a sad film but a great film, about a person of courage, vision and innate optimism; about a beautiful island-nation, about its history, and about climate change that affects everyone.",1407024000,5,2299,5.031662269129288
5231650,4,B00914EUM0,"""The Island President"" follows the real-life story of a man who stands up against all odds to do the right thing ... and he did it more than once. The documentary is about Mohamed Nasheed, President of the Republic of the Maldives, the world's lowest country that currently faces a big threat from climate change and a rise in sea levels. For Mohamed Nasheed, however, global warming is not the only thing that he has to fight against.

The beautifully-shot documentary is basically about this charming person, whose political career started when writing an article for a political magazine ""Sangu"" in 1990. Though arrested and imprisoned by the government, he went on to help form the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP), and later became the president of the country in 2008. ""The Island President"" is part about the history of the Republic of the Maldives, and Mohamed Nasheed as a politician.

The film also follows the activities of the president before and during United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2009. The film allows the viewers to catch a glimpse of the political tug of war between the nations.

You may say, ""Why 3.5 stars, not five?"" There are two reasons. As the film's postscript suggests, Mohamed Nasheed's story still continues, with several major incidents that happened after the film is completed. Also, I think the film needs more facts about the environmental conditions about the islands so that we understand the serious situations the country is in. How bad are things getting there? We want to know more.

Don't get me wrong. Watching ""The Island President"" is an informative and eye-opening experience. Still I think we need a broader perspective to understand the man and what is going on in the Maldives. In short, the film simply needs more time, or a ""sequel.""",1382313600,5,1798,4.943708609271523
5231651,5,B00914EUM0,A great film that everyone should see.  So many have no clue of how climate change creates problems for others so far away.,1379203200,,123,4.3478260869565215

5231653,5,B00914EUM0,"As the poet John Donne once wrote, ""No man is an island.""  ""The Island President"" is a visually and conceptually stunning documentary.  A fascinating, beautifully realized film that should be required viewing for all citizens of our planet.  As Robert De Niro once said ""You talkin' to me?""  Yes, I am.  I'm talkin' to you.",1376006400,3,323,4.8
5231654,4,B00914EUM0,"""The Island President"" is a documentary about the attempts circa 2009 to influence world powers to address climate change.  This charge is spearheaded by the Maldives, a tiny island nation (only 8 smaller nations exist) in the Indian Ocean that has experienced considerable erosion of their coastlines due to climate change.  Their new President, Mohamed Nasheed, declared that climate change is his number one concern and that the Maldives will disappear within a few decades if it is not addressed.  He attends the 2009 Copenhagen talks, hoping (unrealistically) to sway India, China, and the United States.

Obviously, the focus of this documentary is on global warming - some of the material presented may be questioned by certain audiences.  However, this rich film still offers a great deal to interest viewers, whatever their positions on climate change.  For example, a bit of time is devoted to Nasheed's history; he was a political prisoner of the previous regime.  We see as he attempts to turn his country into a true democracy, which is laden with obstacles, including an economy hit hard by the decreasing fishing industry.  His job is not a glamorous one; he works hard and has to score points where he can, which sometimes seem like desperate attention-seeking (e.g., holding an underwater cabinet meeting).

I also greatly enjoyed scenes at the Copenhagen talks, where the Nasheed is politely received most of the time but clearly in over his head (pun not intended).  The Chinese attache, for example, has to ask the President's staff which person is the President (after mistaking him several times for the leader of Sudan).  The exasperated looks on their faces is priceless but also a bit sad.  Nasheed clearly cares about his country, wants to do well, and is a bright and energetic man, but developing countries have such an uphill battle.  It all makes for a fascinating watch, helped along with the inclusion of several Radiohead songs.",1368835200,2,1961,5.052795031055901
5231655,5,B00914EUM0,"Climate change or global warming has finally been shown to be a solemn reality that the world at large can no longer ignore if it hopes to build for the future. This well-crafted documentary chronicles the efforts of the Maldives president, Mohamed Nasheed, and his cabinet to internationally raise the alarm as to what a projected increase in global temperatures could do to the low-lying islands around the world. As head of a country consisting of 1200 tropical islands, no more than three feet above sea-level, this man is definitely pro-active in his attempts to protect his people's future from being wiped out. As this film shows, he is leader who has come to this very demanding job by appealing to the core values of islanders, forming alliances with key political interests across the Indian Ocean, and devising a plan that will allow the Maldives, at worst, to tap into adaptation funds to build a seawall to hold back the encroaching waters. What is so amazing about Nasheed's lobbying efforts is that as barely a bit player on the world scene, he was able to win general approval, at the Copenhagen Summit, for his motion to establish new target levels for carbon reduction. Though not enforceable, these numbers represent a victory for a tenacious leader who then parlayed them into obtaining matching funds to rebuild the crumbling beaches of this vulnerable paradise. Recent history, in the form of the destructive 2005 tsunami that wiped out almost half of the country's GDP,is a terrible reminder what happens when nations are not prepared to contend with nature. This production is packed with useful facts, great scenery, and excellent media shots of conferences like the controversial Copenhagen meetings. In my estimation, the filmmmaker has succeeded in effectively driving home the point that this environmental issue should be at the top of all national agendas.",1365206400,,1887,5.070739549839228

5231657,4,B00914EUM0,"""The Island President"" (2011 release; 101 min.)  is a documentary about the efforts of Maldives President Mohamed Nasheed to tackle climate change. As the movie starts, we get some introductory images of the Maldives (located in the Indian Ocean, slightly south-west of India) and of course you cannot stop but marvel at its beauty. Or as one comentator says ""it's where paradise intersects with paradise"". But we also get images of the devastation caused by frequent flooding of the islands.

After the introduction, we are then on two parallel tracks: first, how Nasheed came pretty much out of nowhere and defeated the then existing dictatorship in an unexpected but decisive victory (In believe in 2007 or 2008). Second, how Nasheed is determined to bring the plight of the low-lying Maldives to the attention of the world. It all leads up to the last 30 min,. of the movie where world leaders gather in Kopenhagen for the Climate Change U.N. Summit in December, 2009.

Several comments: this movie teaches us a lot, and yet is also entertaining. Nasheed is the charmer from start to finish and altough he is as every bit determined and convinced of the climate change issue than Al Gore in his ""Convenient Truth"" documentary 10 years ago, Nasheed never comes across as condenscending or worse. It needs to be mentioned again that the movie has the (unintended, I hope) consequence of being a travelogue of sorts for the Maldives. I want to visit that place! Next, the movie features a number of instrumental music from various Radiohead songs (in particluar from Kid A), and you just know that Radiohead would never agree to this, unless they believe in the movie and the cause. Last but not least,watch out for the ""updates"" on where these main players now are, you will be very surprised. Meanwhile, ""The Island President "" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1361664000,,1853,4.8949044585987265

8533666,4,B00914EUM0,"I watch many documentaries a year.  I viewed this approximately a year ago and its impact was so profound, I still think on it.  At the time of its filming, it focused on President, Mohamed Nasheed of the Maldives (which is composed of 100's of islands, many inhabited) efforts to reduce carbon emissions in large industrial nations because of its impact on climate which he believes is severely detrimental to his country.  These gorgeous islands are a popular tourist attraction among the rich and famous and particularly the Hollywood crowd.  Set in the Indian Ocean, they offer incredible beauty, friendly peoples and amazing resorts but unfortunately, some of the islands have already been abandoned by the people because their land has sunk and more islands are sinking quickly.

Convinced that carbon emissions which causes global warming is the reason behind their disappearance, the former President went to the big carbon producing nations asking them to lower their emissions by changing how they operate the biggest offenders.  We watch as he is met with limited concern and lip service.  Eventually, he visits the United Nations and speaks to the entire body, and again meets with ambivalence and at times great indifference among his peers.

One can only feel powerless, as he doggedly pursues his task to protect his beloved country, it will remind you of the Greek myth of Sisyphus.

In the end, we are told a new President was elected and the viewer wonders why Mohamed Nasheed was not reelected.  I took a point off because this documentary stands on emotion but leaves some questions unanswered (I can't recall at this point).",1432857600,,1645,5.014705882352941
