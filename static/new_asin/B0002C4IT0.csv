2075831,4,B0002C4IT0,"Dolphina is a good dancer, very graceful, but she's not a very good teacher, she mis-counted a lot of moves, and the left and right moves are sometimes not balanced.

The first DVD, the basic workout, I have to give the photographer a ""D-"", I have no idea why he/she kept photoing a very small part of Dolphina, like the center of her belly, or her face, when people really need to see her whole body to learn the moves. I had to imagine what she was doing for a good part of this DVD.

The second DVD, the warrior goddess, I love it, although she mis-counted the moves, but these moves are very challenging, keeps you interested. Be very careful to ""tuck under"", otherwise you will hurt your back. She's also too quick on some advanced moves, didn't give you time to absorb the moves, you have to spend some time in front of the mirror to drill the moves.

The third DVD, veil and finger symbal, I haven't started on these yet, but I watched and like them.

All in all, not a bad purchase, glad to have these DVDs.",1264464000,5,1015,4.270833333333333
8025826,5,B0002C4IT0,I had this video set before & someone stole it because it is so good. This awakens so many parts of the body without force. It will make you sweat without noticing that you did a great workout.,1525996800,,193,4.105263157894737

8025828,5,B0002C4IT0,This is the first dvd set of bellydance workouts I ever bought and I love it . I actually loaned it to a friend and she kept it! This set of dvds actually helped me out of a very sad and dark place so despite the camera work or whatever not being perfect it gave me a certain hope and light in my life. It inspired me to take classes and helped me improve my self image and readied my body and mind for beginner bellydance classes! Long review. ..yes I know but if u need a fun and inspiring workout it's a great place to start and you may even venture into to a class and former a sisterhood like I did. I'm sorry for those who didn't find it useful maybe you could give it to someone who is struggling and needs a little motivation! Throw in a hip scarf and a smile and you could change a life!,1457481600,,796,3.950310559006211

8025830,5,B0002C4IT0,"I have loved The Goddess workout with Dolphina. She is slower so you can really connect with what she has to say and teach. It is a 3 dvd set that offers basic training. Then an advanced work out. Then a lesson on finger chimes and veils. She teaches you a routine. And let me tell you, my arms burned!!! ... but the just told me how much more out of shape I was than I realized! To me she is one of the best teachers out there. I wish I could go to her class.",1411171200,2,460,3.8020833333333335
8025831,4,B0002C4IT0,Transaction was good. This is a fun work out and you really do learn some nice routine moves.,1396051200,,93,4.222222222222222
8025832,3,B0002C4IT0,"This was several DVDs, but the VHS version was better of just the single DVD.  The original did a good job of showing the moves necessary to get the motions.  The DVDs are too artsie & sexy.  Yes, the art of bellydancing is sensual, but I wanted a ""workout"" as the title mentions.  I also wanted the DVD so I could give up my VHS player.  Oh well, gave the DVDs to a friend.",1352505600,,374,4.0
8025833,5,B0002C4IT0,"I love this video set because the instructor focuses more on the work-out instead of a dance routine!  She keeps the movements simple and easy to perform in the basic video; she continues with just a straight-forward work-out in the second video, and just has fun with the 3rd & 4th videos!  When I can master all 4 videos, I will be sure to try her other DVD's in the future!",1327622400,,376,4.28169014084507
8025834,3,B0002C4IT0,"If you are wanting to learn how to belly dance this is not what you are looking for as it does not teach you many key elements.  Conversely, if you are looking for a belly dancing inspired workout dvd this would be perfect for you.  I like using this dvd but believe that it is advertized wrong, thus my rating.  In general it is a relaxing workout, but the lady can get annoying at times.  Possibly a personal issue?",1307577600,,417,4.2405063291139244
8025835,5,B0002C4IT0,"I borrowed this from a friend, and love it so much! When she asks for it back, I will have my own copy, so I can still work out! It was a great experience, from the search on Amazon, to the delivery at my home!",1303603200,,210,3.688888888888889
