5934546,5,B00EQHLOQM,"Todd and Paul have a tough job - they get to drive a selection of 911s, tracing the evolution of the car from the 1960s through today.  Their impressions are informative, fun and knowledgeable.  They really understand what the 911 is and gets that across in this really exceptional DVD.  The locale is stunning.  The soundtrack, mostly the wonderful sound of the 911 engine, is good.  This DVD will bring a wide grin to the faces of 911 owners and possibly entice non-911 owners to take a look at a classic, iconic sports car.",1379721600,,526,4.553191489361702

5934557,5,B00EQHLOQM,"I bought this movie purely based upon how much I liked Everyday Driver's other movie Mid Engines and Mountains. Prior to watching 50 Years of 911 I knew very little about pre-996 911s and for me this film was a fantastic introduction to those earlier cars. As always Todd and Paul keep it engaging and accessible as the walk the audience through the evolution of 911. You get a lot of great design information, historical context and lot of great insight into how each generation drives. The cinematography and audio are top notch too.",1438732800,,535,4.702127659574468
5934558,5,B00EQHLOQM,"I first saw this video on Velocity and really enjoyed the format - two car guys wringing out each of the 8 versions of the Porsche 911 in the mountains just East of Salt Lake City.  Luckily, I didn't settle for the one hour dvr version and purchased the two hour and 40 minute full dvd.  If you rate the Velocity version an A - then the full dvd is an AAA+.  The additional 1 hour and 40 minutes of ""extras"" are well worth the cost.  Purchasing any 911 is a major automotive investment and it can be daunting and confusing, particularly when you start factoring-in the maintenance quirks of each model.  It's very easy to pass on a model for maintenance reasons without ever exploring its' virtues.  The beauty of this video is that Todd and Paul focus entirely on the driving experience and the unique handling characteristics and personality of each model.  I learned that versions I had written off in my search for maintenance reasons are actually delightful machines worthy of consideration.  If you are contemplating owning a 911 this is the perfect place to start.  After you have zeroed in your prospective favorite years, then you can wade into the maintenance issues, make your decision and start your search.  As you will start to suspect in the section where the owners of the test cars talk about their cars - most 911 owners love their cars and readily expend the necessary funds to keep them in top condition.  Therefore, many of the maintenance issues, especially on the older models, have already been addressed and corrected by diligent owners.  Don't miss the 911 of your dreams.  Get this video and compare the models of this legendary sports car through the insightful test driving of Paul and Todd.  5 Stars.",1433548800,5,1730,4.685430463576159

The scenery is much better here than in Mid Engines and Mountains, but don't blame them, blame California.  The owner testimonials was my favorite part.  Normal folks with great stories that any car enthusiast can relate to.  It brought a big smile to my face, and I've never driven or rode in a 911.",1426118400,,417,4.447368421052632

Rest assured, these guys know cars and driving. Better yet they know buyers and address the ideal owner for each generation and why one might pick a certain model over another. I will definitely watch again once I am closer to purchasing a 993 or 997.1.",1422230400,,506,4.883720930232558
5934566,5,B00EQHLOQM,"Evreryday Driver format of two petrol heads driving and commenting the same car has been a great formula on their You Tube channel. This along with great camera work and editing has been their hallmark. What is an plus about this DVD though is a) the subject matter, the iconic 911, b) the Blue Ray quality and c) the depth in this video in terms of reviewing each car and the narrative of the history of the 911 development.

5934570,5,B00EQHLOQM,"Great tribute and comparison. Loved the details of Porsche craftsmanship (ping!) and the owner profiles.

I'll admit, I bought this solely to support Todd & Paul's venture. They are incredibly thorough in their YouTube reviews and comparisons, so I knew this ""documentary"" would be a solid addition to my library.

That said, I NEVER liked the Porsche 911 when I was a kid. A Ferrari 355 was on the cover of my first Road & Track, so I grew up a fan of the prancing horse instead. I fear if I had watched this when I was 12, I'd be saving up for a 911 instead of dreaming about an overpriced Ferrari.

While I may never own a 911; this film has made me appreciate the car and it's owners.",1416873600,,688,4.276923076923077

There are many people making car videos and some do it very well and some, well, they seem amateurish at best.  This video falls in the first category and is full of cinematic sequences and very entertaining presentations of each generation of the Porsche 911.  I recommend this to any Porsche fan or automotive enthusiast.",1414627200,,457,4.2298850574712645

I bought this to not only support them, but have always been a big admirer of the 911 since I was a kid.  I have never owned one, but it is on my list when the kids are out of the house :)

Really well made video and I love the reviews with the actual owners of the various 911's.  This video was worth every penny and I look forward to more of these in the future.",1411171200,,563,4.185185185185185

5934577,5,B00EQHLOQM,"We're fans of the YouTube show.  We are not ""car people"" but loved seeing and hearing about the 50 year evolution of the 911 from what appeared to us to be a ""sport Volkwagen Bug"" to the near-supercar it is today, and all steps in between.

You get an insight to the cars, and insights to the way they drive, and through the interviews with the owners, an insight to the kind of person that is behind the wheel of these cars.  It's pretty clear everyone has been a Porsche fan for awhile, and all seemed generous with their cars and time, dispelling the old joke bout Porsches and Porcupines.

But also, don't forget the extras - they review the Porsche Caymen S which appears to be a spiritual successor of the early cars, and then an unrelated Pacific Coast Highway comparison of 3 non porsche cars.

The production quality is first rate, but it didn't lose the spirit and enthusiasm of the YouTube.  Great Job!

And while we likely won't own a 911, we really REALLy enjoyed this production!",1407110400,,993,4.483333333333333
5934578,5,B00EQHLOQM,"Absolutely superb video highlighting Porsche 911's.  The commentary was excellent, the video outstanding.  There is much more content than what was on television.

5934579,5,B00EQHLOQM,"If you own a 911 or aspire to, this is a superlative overview of the line.  While I might have selected some other model or  years to review, the overall video conveys what most folks need to know.

5934580,5,B00EQHLOQM,"This is a great documentary, using real cars that have been owned by real people. Not some museum docu with pictures of cars that havn't been started in years.

Wish it had a bit more technical data, and some of the more exclusive models, however the scenery and the Blu-Ray quality were superb, my favorite review is of the GT3 RS 4.0...amazing machine, as Todd describes it....it is the fantasy girl!!! I also enjoyed to hear the owners comments, it gives great perspective on how it is to live with those particular year Porches.  Additionally I wanted to be able to support your efforts, as I've become a loyal fan of the show. Please do a review on the 997 Carrera S vs C6 Z06 and maybe bring Paul's Cayman S also.

The hosts are very good at explaining there point of view, what they see, and what they feel in each version of the 911. Fans of Everyday Driver will appreciate the talking point and humor in the film. Porsche fans will enjoy the owner interviews, sights and sounds.

As a video, it is more car porn than a spec-by-spec or detailed comparison but the driving insights are worth the cost of the disc by themselves.",1391299200,2,401,4.391891891891892

What you won't see on this film are slow motion power slides ala Chris Harris, or extreme track day action in the cars, or technical minutia only a petrol head is going to understand. What you do get is what it's like to own and drive a representative example of major milestones in the development of Porsche's iconic sports car in the real world. Hence, Every Day Driver.

There is just a lot of useful and interesting information.  If anyone is thinking of purchasing a 911, I think they should watch this documentary first.  I am hoping that Todd and Paul do this with other iconic vehicles.  I would definitely buy it.

Delightful film quality and locations, historically accurate details about the cars, interviews with interesting owners and exquisite example cars from every generation of 911 all culminate in a symphony of delight. If Ron Burgundy were to review this he would undoubtedly mention the smell of mahogany and leather bound books. In more pedestrian terms, this video is a one of a kind. As a 911 owner and driver, I felt like I was actually in the cars with the reviewers driving through beautiful mountain roads. Speaking of reviewers, Todd and Paul provide that rare alchemy of excellent details and accurate descriptions of driving dynamics - all while presenting with gritty truth, occasional irreverence and emotional reaction. The story line also intrigues viewers with the pursuit of finding the ""best 911"".  As there are many special 911 models, I wondered if some of these extremely-rare versions would appear in the movie.  I was not disappointed.  Without ruining the surprise, I have to say that my favorite part of the video was at the very end - presented as bonus material.  Beautiful, fun, entertaining, educational - and I agree with one of the reviewers in his pick of best 911 ever.

It sounded fantastic and I had been on the Everyday Driver website before and liked their candid no nonsense reviews. This video is fantastic. It really goes in depth with what an ""everyday guy"" would think about the cars. You have Paul who loves 911's and Todd who respects them but definitely does not have the same love affair. This makes for an interesting counterpoint throughout the documentary. Fantastically filmed in the beautiful areas surrounding Park City and well scripted by two knowledgeable guys who care about their craft and the information they're getting across to you. Again, fantastic video and definitely worth the purchase!  It is just a door.....",1383782400,,790,4.984848484848484

These guys accurately represent the perspective of the ""everyman,"" and so I can really relate to them and enjoy watching them review cars.  And the quality is exceptional!  It's amazing these days what two guys can accomplish with the right amount of dedication and creativity; you will thoroughly enjoy this thoughtful celebration of the 911's 50th birthday!",1383091200,,630,5.463917525773196

Beautiful locations, great car sounds, nicely edited, and a real insightful review of each cars unique mannerisms and characteristics. This is a unique video because you get to see and hear each generation of the 911 back to back. A unique opportunity that very few drivers will ever experience.  The HD quality and look of the film is fantastic too.
Lots of extra's too with a look at the GT3 RS 4.0, Cayman S and each cars unique story and owner.  I have watched this film many times and as I said before, every Porsche fan will really enjoy having this in their Porsche video library!

5934606,5,B00EQHLOQM,"Those of you who are already familiar with Todd and Paul, and their Everyday Driver reviews, will know what to expect: two guys with a love and passion for the automobile that can only be rivalled by Jay Leno, with the remarkable ability to convey that passion to the viewer. With the release of this Blu-Ray, however, you get the usual witty banter and fantastic similes that help you sense what these two enthusiasts are experiencing, but in a ""feature length"" documentary with stunning visuals, gorgeous scenery, and sounds that will have you immediately replaying portions just to hear it again. Even if you're not a fan of the 911 (and I don't consider myself to be one) you can't help but respect the marque for what it has achieved, the legendary status it has acquired in the automotive world, and this documentary does an exceptional job of conveying the development over the decades. If you're a car enthusiast, and certainly if you're a fan of Everyday Driver or Porsche, you really should check it out.",1380585600,,1014,4.767045454545454

8608537,5,B00EQHLOQM,"These guys are great. Honest, down to earth car reviewers that really put lots of work into these videos. I learned a lot about 911s when I bought this for my father in law and we watched together. Highly recommended for anyone looking at a good comparo of various 911 model years. Be sure to check out their other films too (Mid Engines & Mountains, Pilgrimage, Icon)  and their podcast is really great as well. I can't stress enough how much you need to have their stuff in your life if you are a car guy or girl.",1526947200,,515,4.255102040816326
8608538,5,B00EQHLOQM,"Great video from the Everyday Driver guys. Well worth watching, whether you're a Porsche fan or just like cars in general. Great comparison from the drivers seat of each 911 model (up to the date of filming). Unique in that way and good intro to the Everyday Driver franchise if haven't watched their other videos, which I also highly recommend.",1526860800,,345,4.766666666666667

8608541,5,B00EQHLOQM,"Whether you want the inside scoop before you buy, just love cars or you already own a 911, this film and the bonus owner interviews are a must. Only problem is, you will be car shopping before the end credits.

The hosts don't take themselves too seriously, but are gifted at communicating what the cars feel like even while they are hammering through corners.  All this is captured with cinema quality production values. Just two examples are, gorgeous panoramic shots of the cars weaving through scenic mountain roads, as well as a soundtrack wailing with some of Porsche's loveliest engines. Enjoy!",1491264000,,601,4.9405940594059405
8608542,4,B00EQHLOQM,"The first movie by Paul and Todd is great. Not quite to the level of ICON (since you can tell this is their first crack at a full length movie) but definitely worth the price for any car lover even if they're not a fan of Porsche specifically. Each car is incredibly interesting and thought out in terms of explaining how they drive and the experience they give. Paul and Todd do a terrific job once again of conveying to the audience what it truly is like to drive each one and hell... you might find yourself window shopping for one of these classics after finishing this movie. It's that good.

The only reason i didn't give this film a 5 out of 5 is because ICON exists. That is truly great work and if you haven't seen it yet, you're in for a treat.

Great film. Great hosts. Never boring for a second. Makes you reevaluate if you haven't been paying attention to Porsche that closely.",1486771200,,890,4.323353293413174
