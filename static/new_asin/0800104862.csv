168051,5,0800104862,"This movie really makes you stop and think, about how you live your life and how others live theirs. Every person's life has a purpose. Each of us has to find out what that purpose is. Many don't know it, but you can live out your purpose and still enjoy life at the same time, affecting other people in the positive. This movie almost seemed to be from the mind of a pessimist, but some may say a realist. I think it reflects the moral conscious of that day. I have seen a good number of Sidney Poitier movies, and it amazes me how he can always keep that poker face in every tough seen (one calling for little to no expression when giving someone critical information). He ranks right up there with all of the leading men of Hollywood of old, great actors of back in the day.",1175558400,21,777,4.221476510067114

168113,4,0800104862,"I bought this movie for my father since he said it is one of his FAVORITE movies that he watches at least twice a year.

I was curious and I watched it myself and didn't enjoy it as much. To me it was a little hard to get into and had to rewatch it to figure out what John was, an angel? From outer space? I was confused lol.

All in all if you are a Sidney Poitier fan you probably already know, enjoy and have seen this movie already.

My dad, I'm sure would give it 5 stars, but Im taking 1 away because it really wasn't my cup of tea.",1435708800,,538,3.7857142857142856

168116,3,0800104862,"I thought this movie was going to be a religious movie according to the plot on the back dvd cover. The main character carried a Bible in a different language and also the Jewish version of the Bible, consequently, very little about religion at all. The ending left you with what kind of an ending is that. Not clear at all. There was of course a love story between the main character and a teacher but I fast forward all threw that. I am very glad that I bought a used dvd and didn't pay more for this movie. On the dvd cover, I thought that was the main character's little brother but it's the school teacher.

168149,5,0800104862,"The story goes, apparently, that a veteran Hollywood screenwriter who was into science fiction and history had an idea for kind of a creepy story involving a black man who was seemingly on a tour of planet Earth to assess its fitness for...what's that old Bible story?
Anyway, this writer brought this idea to Sidney Poitier who had recently created his own production company, and he was willing to turn this story into a film. Though not as finely-done as we expect from 21st century films, for its day this story was VERY unusual and is very well-told in this movie.",1400457600,2,569,4.643564356435643

168224,5,0800104862,"Brother John is surely one of Sidney Poitier's odder characters. It's the same Poitier and his character is played in typical Poitier fashion, same voice, same looks, same gestures. But who, or maybe more to the point, what, is Brother John? He has been away traveling the world for many years and the movie begins with him mysteriously turning up in his hometown upon the death of his sister, just as he did years before at the death of his parents. It is not known how he knew that she had died. He seems to have other strange knowledge as well, about people and life. His calm observing demeanor and always slightly sad expression suggest that he's not telling all the secrets he knows. A police officer and a rival for a local woman try to beat him up and are handled as easily as a black belt handling a beer-bellied bubba. His responses to some of the casual questions put to him by townsfolk and the few elements of his back story that are revealed only add to the deep mystery and almost Christ-like aura that builds around him. In the end he disappears and you're left wondering not only who he was but what his true message and mission were.",1351814400,,1151,4.433962264150943

168227,5,0800104862,"Like Fragment of Fear (which was also released in 1970)I happened upon this movie while channel surfing back in the 1980's. From beginning to end, I was taken in by the mystery shrouding the main character John Kane. Who, or what Brother John is, remains a bit of a mystery. There are, however, some pretty strong (yet subtle) implications regarding the nature of the man in question.  There is also quite a bit of sociopolitical and racial commentary, which is not unusual for a Vietnam era film.  Furthermore, the film touches on philosophical and moral issues that give it a depth beyond the deceptively simple plot.  There is, in fact, a thought provoking question about the nature of humanity, and the moral implications of its actions towards members of its own species, as well as those of others throughout its brief history on the planet.
  The script is superb conceptually, and implies (without actually stating) that other-worldly beings are responsible for the creation, or at least the evolution, of Man as a so-called rational animal.  Furthermore, there is also the insinuation that a member of that race (in human form) once checked on our progress, and gave an unfavorable report to say the least.  Now almost 2000 years later, another observer (or perhaps the same one in a different human form) has been sent to make a record of current (circa 1970) activity all over the globe.  The purpose of this is to decide whether the human experiment was a failure or a success, and whether or not it should be shut down.  In short, the question simply put is: Does humanity as a species deserve to survive, or are its sins too great?  Deep questions indeed, which might make the viewers of this film question their own moral standing.
  That aside, however, the acting of Sidney Poitier and company is superb, and I can't help but marvel at the fact that such a hidden gem has practically been forgotten over the decades.",1321920000,8,1933,4.771771771771772

168252,5,0800104862,"This is a great movie, but one I'd recommend watching before you read these reviews which give our explanation of what we think it means. Poitier gives a very fine performance, as does Gerr and the rest of the cast. The cinematography (note creative use of light and grainy closeups) and soundtrack (hip Quincy Jones) is excellent (if a bit early 70's dated). Brother John may be an enigmatic character, but the plot is not so subtle in it's look at racism, war, worker and big industry relations, modern humanity and a wide range of human relationships.

In many ways this plays as an allegory of Jesus Christ's life, but it is also more. By the end I thought he was more John The Revelator than Christ. But he is also more wise, restrained and dispassionate than those traditional Christian characters. He is more like Christ as the Taoist sage witnessing and absorbing the world without resistance or judgment.

While the plot is clearly allegorical, with an axe to grind about social injustices, the beauty is that it makes you want to think and examine on your own. And simply live in the moment.",1267920000,5,1101,4.670103092783505
168253,2,0800104862,"Even though I have not seen all of Sidney Poitier's movies, I've seen many of them, as well as owning about a dozen of them. I have always been a big fan of his, and some of his movies are among some of my all-time favorite movies, BUT ... this movie just isn't one of them. :-( When I became aware of it's existence just a few weeks ago, it looked like it might be very enjoyable. But, after watching it, I was pretty disappointed. I don't normally review movies since I think a person has to find a reviewer that they know has similar tastes in movies, if that person's reviews are going to be very useful to the people reading them. But, when Amazon sent me a request to review this one, I just felt that I needed to tell fans of Sidney Poitier's movies to see this before you buy it, else you may wish (like me) that you hadn't purchased it. I'm not saying that it is terrible, but it's certainly far from being comparable to some of his classics, such as ""To Sir, With Love"", ""In The Heat Of The Night"", ""A Patch Of Blue"", ""Lilies Of The Field"", etc.",1257033600,3,1055,4.151219512195122

168256,5,0800104862,"After a two-minute introduction of credits accompanied by a nice winds score, an aging family doctor (played by Will Geer) in a small Southern town sets the plot in motion when he calls the Reverend Mac and his son, the prosecutor, to his home for a meeting concerning Brother John.  Earlier that day, the Doc had examined Brother John's sister and found her to be suffering from an advanced stage of cancer, with only a few days to live at most.

But the story begins thirty years before, with the breach birth delivery of Brother John.  The lights had gone out when an unexpected windstorm popped up out of nowhere.  John grew up like any other boy but at the age of 16, he left town.  He came back to his mother's death bed, then his father's death bed, and ""sure as I'm standin' here, I know that boy, wonderin' God knows where, will show up at his sister's death bed"".

John does show up at this sister's death bed, but this all takes place during a mass demonstration to organize a union at a factory in town, and the Doc's son and the sheriff are worried about outside agitators.  And they suspect John.  They slip into his motel room and rummage through his things, noting a passport that says he been all over the world including Cuba and Communist China (this was before Nixon opened Pandora's Box).  When they later question him, he admits than he can speak Arabic, Russian, Swahili and a score of other languages.  When they asked him how? he replied by saying he listened.  How did you pay for the airfare?  I worked, John said. In short, they suspect him of being a spy.

Only the Doc has figured out that Brother John is indeed a spy, but one from another planet.  Brother John is an extra-terrestial.  When the Reverend's daughter asked John about Judgement Day, he said maybe it wouldn't be that way - every man answering for his own sins, maybe man would answer as a species.

Later the Doc visited John in a jail cell, and admitted to John that he knew, saying that he thought it might be of some comfort to speak with someone who knew.  He added that nobody believes him anyway.  He asked John - ""what have you seen?"".  John's short speech on what he has witnessed around the earth, from children being shoveled off the streets of Calcutta while the rich bask in the sun, to the wars in Biafra and Vietnam, is omnious and disturbing.  John equates man to maggots on a rotten apple getting to leap off, first for the moon, then to the stars.

""Is that it then"", Doc asks, ""they don't want us out there?"" John doesn't reply. When Doc asked if he's seen hope, a chance?  John said he seen's what's there.  ""What about love?"", asked Doc.  ""Man isn't just an animal, he is capable of love"".  John said that might not be enough.  In the end, the Doc is there when John leaves this planet just as the Doc was there when he arrived.",1203724800,16,2844,4.390057361376673

The scene where the factories was about the pollution here on the earth. Man is killing himself and the words of the end we all should remember we will not be judged by what we are we will be judged by what we have become on judgement day. The wind is the result of force, a current. The atom in our lives is slow the current created from our movement is quick and powerful. We need to make sure it is a good current.
