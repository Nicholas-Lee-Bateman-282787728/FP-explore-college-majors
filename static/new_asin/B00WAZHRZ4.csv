8712738,5,B00WAZHRZ4,Lots of fun to reminisce about the early days of Public Television.  Very similar in format to Monty Python.,1532304000,,108,4.684210526315789
8712739,5,B00WAZHRZ4,"A throw back to a more rawer less controlled Public Television world. You will spot lots of unknowns who later in their careers became celebrities. I watched this show as a kid and had fond memories of it.  It is what I remembered it to be, silly, irreverent, and spontaneous.  It is worth the price of the  purchase for the animation sequences alone. Be aware it is not remastered and has a grainy 1970's video tape quality.",1516752000,,425,4.4935064935064934
8712740,3,B00WAZHRZ4,Love(d) the show when it was on PBS like the show on DVD.I know Technology has changed unbelievably since this show aired but I was so very disappointed with the picture quality of this set. If this is heavily restored it is really sad. If not shame on someone for not showcasing it with better viewability,1505692800,,306,4.482142857142857
8712741,5,B00WAZHRZ4,oh boy watched this when i was in high school back in the 70s. thought it was lost for good as it started on NET before it changed to PBS. now put NET  PLAYHOUSE (PRE-AMERICAN PLAYHOUSE) ON DVD.,1460937600,,194,4.105263157894737
8712742,5,B00WAZHRZ4,Marshall Efron is a counter-culture hero!!!!,1457568000,,44,6.5
8712743,5,B00WAZHRZ4,"Oh boy oh ob boy, what a treat to review this wonderful PBS series from a time gone by! Efron was so quirky and SO brilliant, it's really fascinating as well as funny, and a real look into a mindset I remember well but which is now fading into the past. A real treat!",1454198400,2,267,3.962962962962963
8712744,5,B00WAZHRZ4,Great.....just as I remember it from the 70s.,1453507200,,45,4.75
8712745,5,B00WAZHRZ4,"There is actually more than 13 hours of material here, with some minor duplication from the first two discs which are ""best of compilations""
and the seocnd two which are whole episodes.  The downside is there are no chapter selections.  But you owe it to yourself to sample everything, and if you don't like a segment, that's what the FF button is for.  People talk about the pre-SNL comedy sketches and short films, and they are plentiful. But what I found most fascinating are the short docs, perfomance pieces, and commentary that spans the political spectrum.
Some very moving, brilliant, and unexpected surprises here.  ""Fascinating womanhood""  seminars,"" a 31 year old poet dying of leukemia talking about feeling liberated, life on the 92nd floor of the Hancock building, early conducting from Michael Tilson Thomas and Thomas Shippers, Artie Shaw talking about his 8 divorces, George Jackson's fierce and poetic Soledad musings Evel Knieivel, Blaze Starr, and Big Daddy Ed Roth as Great American Heroes...this is a fraction of the ecletic provocative offerings.  And the round table of average folks expressing their social and political views that Studs Terkel gathers on several discs, from 45 years ago, could be found in a bar today!  If you care about comedy, the arts, recent history, social trends, animation (some delightful shorts) buy this set.",1446163200,14,1362,5.135746606334842
8712746,5,B00WAZHRZ4,"The Great American Dream Machine was an irreverent, satirical weekly variety show aired nationally on PBS for two seasons from 1971-1972. The show was unlike any ever seen on public television and seemed to bask in controversy during the pre-Watergate era. Chevy Chase, Albert Brooks, Penny Marshall, Henry Winkler, Andy Rooney, Tiny Tim, David Steinberg, and Charles Grodin honed their comic talents on this show and went on to greater fame on television and the movies. Humorist and commentator Marshall Efron hosted. A combination of humorous skits, drama, musical performances and political commentary, the program was considered public TVs first prime-time hit and inspired such later shows as Saturday Night Live, The Daily Show, and The Colbert Report.

Produced by WNET in New York, The Great American Dream Machine was called the intellectual Laugh-In and reflected a growing counterculture, poking fun at politics, mass culture, advertising, and television itself with cleverly written sketches and wide-ranging vignettes. The show was born at a time in public television when producers were encouraged to explore new ways to use the medium, to be spontaneous, to stun, shock, amuse, annoy, and give viewers a different way of seeing the world. Because it ran on PBS, its creators were not beholden to sponsors, which enabled ordinarily taboo subjects to be covered. The war in Vietnam and the Nixon White House were frequent targets of the programs satire.

The 4-disc box set contains close to 13 hours of comedy and opinion, including Marshall Efrons Lemon Pie From Scratch sketch, Albert Brooks School for Comedians, Andy Rooneys pre-60 Minutes opinion segments, Chevy Chases Singing Faces mime, Great American Weather Days  a Dream Machine-style weather forecast with a glance back at some of the greatest days in U.S. weather history  a Great American Hero profile of daredevil Evel Knievel, and Elaine Stritch performing Stephen Sondheims Heres to the Ladies Who Lunch.",1445558400,17,1986,5.335463258785943
