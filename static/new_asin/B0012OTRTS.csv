2007's ""Atonement"" is a beautifully acted and directed movie, a richly textured period piece, and a tragedy in three parts that defies easy description without giving away the movie's punchline.

At the center of the story is female writer Briony Talis. When the story opens on a hot summer's day in 1935 at an English estate, Briony is a highly imaginative 13-year old girl trying to stage a play with her reluctant cousins. The genesis of tragedy is Briony's observation of her older sister Cecilia's (Keira Knightley) relationship with Robbie (James McAvoy), son of the estate housekeeper and a bright and decent lad whose college education Briony's father has funded. Cecilia and Robbie are on the verge of a passionate romance, but through Briony's eyes, Robbie's actions take on a more sinister connotation. When one of Briony's cousins is sexually assaulted, Briony pins the crime on Robbie, who is sent to prison. The story jumps ahead to World War II, when Briony is a nurse tending to wounded men.  She will attempt to reach out to her sister and Robbie in an attempt to make amends.  The movie jumps again, to Briony's old age.  A final plot twist is delivered that allows the viewer to make sense of a movie told from multiple points of view.

2005's ""Pride and Prejudice"" is a skillful adaptation of Jane Austen's classic romance novel to the big screen. Taken on its own merits as a theatrical release, the 2005 version is visually stunning, includes wonderful location shooting and period detail, and offers two attractive leading actors with genuine on-screen chemistry.  The storyline is familiar to Jane Austen fans.  Keira Knightley is perfectly cast as the young and impertinent Elizabeth. Matthew MacFadyen is very effective as the painfully shy and reserved Mr. Darcy.  Adapting Pride and Prejudice to a two hour movie format means seriously compressing a treasured storyline. Under Director Joe Wright's sure hand, the movie steps briskly through the plot, keeping a tight focus on Elizabeth Bennet and her developing relationship with Mr. Darcy.

These two movies are highly recommended as excellent entertainment.",1430438400,,2235,5.132231404958677
