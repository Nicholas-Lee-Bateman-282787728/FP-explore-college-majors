8209408,2,B000TGURJ4,The DVD skipped and at times froze. Poor quality for the DVD but the story is good.,1429488000,,83,3.9411764705882355
8209409,4,B000TGURJ4,"A nice overview of the rise of the American beer ""industry"", and subsequent growth of craft-brewing.
One curious note about the DVD: I found that the Extras only play correctly in Stereo 2-Channel mode (under Audio Setup). If you select 5.1 Surround, you get no sound from the Extras at all! (This is what happens with my DVD player - might not happen with other players.)",1411948800,,372,4.651515151515151

8209413,4,B000TGURJ4,"As a historical documentary, this was a great watch.  They took a very wide-angled approach to exactly what the title claims and deals with all of American Beer and its sordid history.  This is not the most satisfying watch in the world for the craft-brew loving beer geeks who want to see a history of American Beer that includes the past couple of decades (some of the interviews with the big 3's public relations folks and lab coats will surely spark frothy rage in segments of the cerevisaphile population).  This film mostly documents the big brewers (current and defunct) and how the whole beer landscape was set from the foundation of the country through around the 1970s.  There are brief references to what's been happening more recently, but only in passing.

Still, the story's well told, and it's interesting to see how far we've come with that greatest of beverages.",1303430400,2,879,4.833333333333333
8209414,5,B000TGURJ4,"America and beer have a rich, storied, and intertwined history. Beginning with the earliest settlers, beer played an important role. For example, in the 1600's, beer was being brewed in Jamestown, VA. The governor of Jamestown wrote the King of England asking for two brewers, as he knew that the colony would not survive without beer. In fact, everyone drank some form of beer, from children to adults. The reason? It was safer to drink than milk or water, people got sick from drinking them, but the harmful bacteria could not survive the brewing process.

The history of beer in America is illustrated in an entertaining and fascinating fashion in the documentary, The American Brew: The Rich and Surprising History of Beer. Starting with the earliest European settlers, to the influx of German immigrants, Prohibition, and the rise of craft brewing, the film will give you an appreciation for the beverage as well as a lesson in American history that is not taught in any classroom. Whether your beer of choice is mass produced or craft brewed, there is something for everyone in this film. Schlitz, Miller, Anheuser-Busch, Anchor Steam, Sierra Nevada, Stoudt's, Yuengling, and more are all represented in this documentary. Archival footage, reenactments of early brewing techniques, interviews with interesting people, and, of course, beer, make this a film not to be missed by anyone remotely interested in American history or beer.

The American Brew has some extras that add color and more detail to the film. From the inception and growth of Stoudt's Brewery, to Michael Jackson, world renowned beer critic, to the rebirth of Anchor Steam, the extras are not to be missed. The hour spent watching the film will go by quickly, causing you to have a new appreciation for beer (and history), and you may find yourself heading to the refrigerator to grab a cold beer. Highly recommended for the beer lover and those that want a different view of history.
