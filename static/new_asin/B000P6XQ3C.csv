8189710,5,B000P6XQ3C,I really like using the gliding discs so I was looking for a DVD that uses them.  They are difficult to find.  So I was thrilled when I found this one.  It combines the gliding discs with a weighted bar.  A nice variation from my other strictly weights (bar and dumbells) DVDs.  Lots of fun.,1478736000,,291,4.218181818181818
8189711,4,B000P6XQ3C,"This workout uses both a body bar and the gliding disks.  Instructor Mindy Mylrea is joined by Keli Roberts, who modifies some of the exercises, and Violet Zaki, who increases the intensity.

Mylrea starts with a long (about 7 minutes) warm-up.  During the warm-up, you are just holding the body bar and not really using it for resistance.  In addition, she does not step on the disks until about halfway through the warm-up; at that time, she incorporates added moves such as twists plus side and back lunges.

For the standing portion of the workout, Mylrea takes greater advantage of the body bar.  The option is often to hold the bar at the chest, on the shoulders, or overhead while performing classic strength moves such as side and front lunges, curtsey lunges, and deadlifts.  The standing segment ends with push-up/plank work with the feet on the disks.

The floor work is shorter (18 minutes), but it continues to focus on the lower body with bridges and other moves targeting the hamstrings.  Mylrea also includes abs work and a nice floor stretch (6 minutes), bringing in the entire workout right around 54 minutes.

I really enjoy Mylrea's original Gliding set, as I like mixing and matching from the 3 workouts on that DVD.  For some reason, this workout didn't click as well with me, even though there aren't any major problems with the workout itself.  One issue is that I do not have a body bar; substituting an unweighted stick and dumbbells worked okay, but this took some fun out of the workout.  I also think that I have moved away from these type of cardio/strength circuit workouts now that I have discovered kettlebells.

For those who own both a body bar and gliding disks, however, I would recommend this DVD.",1316822400,,1735,4.74

8189713,2,B000P6XQ3C,"I ordered this DVD thinking I could learn some new moves for the Body Bar that I recently purchased. Upon watching the workout for the first time, I learned that I needed sliding disks to follow along with the workout. I managed to improvise and used paper plates on my carpeted floor for a similar sliding effect, but overall, it was more of an annoyance to try to do the same workout without the proper equipment. They should either include the disks with the DVD or make it very clear that the workout involves the Body Bar AND the slidling disks.
As for the workout itself, it was OK, pretty challenging, but I was not really into it and had  different expectations.",1308528000,2,670,4.491803278688525
8189714,5,B000P6XQ3C,Bought 5 Body Bar DVD in Feb 2010 for something different.  I really like the power & grace and explode but this is my favorite.  Mindy is a fun instructor.  Her workout is challenging enough to keep me interested (and out of breath).,1273708800,,234,4.395348837209302
