631025,5,6303332188,"This is a pretty cool video.  Great animation, with cool images.  It ranges from simple stuff, like a hornet chasing a smaller insect through a forest, to weird stuff, like the ""Too Far"" soda thing.  Bear in  mind that there's no point to any of this, other than for you to go  ""wow, that's pretty cool"".  They're really more like music videos  than stories.  You may be able to make a story out of some of it, but it's  mostly just a lot of weirdness.  The key thing, don't think about it too  hard, just enjoy it.  Jan Hammer's no musical genius, but his compositions  add to the coolness of it all.  By the way, this is a sequel, the first was  called ""The Mind's Eye"", but I've never seen it.  From what I've  heard, I don't think it's as good.  I apologize if anything I've said about  this video was inaccurate, but I haven't seen it in a couple of years, I  just was thinking about it a while back, and decided to review it.  I'll  have to check it out again some time.  In conclusion, this may be weird,  but it's undeniably cool, so check it out.  I guarantee you've never seen  anything like it.",956793600,,1105,4.217391304347826
631026,4,6303332188,"This video places the viewer in a virtual hole and you are forced to explore through computer animation a journey created by the director.  It comes with its own outstanding soundtrack, but I've found it to be far more  interesting to watch along with other music playing--giving this video an  endless amount of viewing pleasure.  It is great to have on at parties for  a coming together of the minds. A definite must for the euphoric party  goer.",949968000,,448,4.67948717948718
631027,5,6303332188,"This is one of the original in the Mind's Eye series and it is _STILL_ the overall best.  While the animations might look slightly dated, the quality of the work is all top-notch, mostly taken from commercial CG outfits like  PDI, Symbolics, Alias, Robert Abel & Associates, BUF, Mental Images,  etc.
The animations are brilliantly arranged to flow into each other  cohesively and form something resembling a storyline or concept.  You do  not get the impression that you are watching a bunch of disjointed pretty  pictures as in the videos that followed.
Jan Hammer's music score is  really the best part of this DVD.  The score follows the imagery and scene  changes perfectly, and Hammer is truely a master of evoking mood through  exotic scales and nuance.
He is most known for his catchy music for  Miami Vice, but anyone familiar with his Mahavishnu Orchestra and Jeff Beck  days knows he is also one of the most influential jazz fusion keyboardists  of all time.  This is a must whether or not you are a computer animation  fan.

631028,2,6303332188,"Let me begin by saying that Beyond the Mind's Eye is one of the best Computer graphic VIDEO TAPES around. The DVD version has made good scene changes from the video tape. And the soundtrack album is excellent.
However, with the DVD conversion, the quality is noticeable lower. The ""screen noise"" caused by magnetic medium on video tape has been converted all too faithfully on the DVD version. Especially looking at the black areas of the animation, the result is horrible. It's like looking a little bit at the ""snow"" on a TV. The picture is not sharp and crisp as it could have been with some digital remastering. Also, the ""Bonus"" video is a shoddy music video that isn't much to look at. The chapter selection is poorly done with not alot of ability to pick just exactly which scene you wanted (The video had about nine chapters, the DVD version only allows you to pick five).
This DVD is not worth your money. Along with showing off it's BAD picture quality, the lack of effort expended on the conversion was appaling. A little bit of digital remastering would have been greatly appreciated to eliminate a lot of the ""snow"" in the animation.  END",900115200,36,1151,4.614634146341463

I ""THOUGHT"" I was getting a DVD copy of it (somehow the VHS title escaped me).  I own the laser disk version of this so I know the graphics and work is outstanding.

I was sad enough it was VHS, but having to put the case, tape and that little plastic trigger looking thang back together was a real bear.  I can't ask him for another, simply because, these are very rare.  If you get a chance to buy one (and enjoy early computer graphics) you will not be sorry for getting it.

631107,5,6303332188,"Man oh man, did I ever love watching this on TV when I was a child. Now that I am an adult, watching this on DVD and falling in love with it all over again has been by far the most exciting trip down memory lane I have ever taken in my life. As I look back on it, and try to compare it with what is being produced nowadays, I have come to realize that in the early 1990s when it was made, it was truly ahead of its time.

The superb computer animation, with its highly complex and constantly flowing composition, truly warps the viewer into a world known only to the imagination. From my own experience, it has enabled me, from a young age, to be creative and unique with my imagination and to think outside the box. Whether it be based on the idea of how life began on earth (Seeds of Life), the interaction between insects and the idea of colonies on the moon (Afternoon Adventure) the world inside of a computer (Brave New World), classic action figure toys (Transformers), rollercoasters, robots or families of eyeballs (Too Far), the gloominess of the evening in everyday life (Windows), romantic relationships (Nothing But Love), the ancient Egyptians (The Pyramid), and the realms of wonder in a theatre or museum (Theater of Magic), the whole progress of every part of this film is truly awe-inspiring on every level. One can tell from the convincing detail that a huge amount of time and dedication went towards the making of this classic masterpiece.

Sadly, we may never see any great works of art like this on TV nowadays, but at least we have DVDs like this to remind us of how there actually used to be stuff on TV that was actually worth watching - stuff that actually encouraged people to open up their imaginations as opposed to just listening to dumbed-down dialogue, such as that which is heard on such atrocities as Monster Garage, Jersey Shore, etc. Please, if you loved this back when it came out, then do not delay in picking it up!

So I can't attest to the fact that the DVD was faulty or there was a problem with its audio track or with my players.  Of all the ones available, this was the most expensive.  It is the best of the 3 I'm familiar with, and had it worked on all my players, I'd have given it 4 and a half stars with my only reservation about giving it a 5 star rating would be because of the expense.

Some say the graphics are kind of below par...but I think this is very well done compared to today's standards (state of the art back then).  I am sitting here in the year 2013, watching this on a 60"" surround sound...wow.  My buddy played the DVD but lowered the volume....and put on his own trance music (moderate to fast paced).  The music and DVD aligned perfectly.  It sounded like the music he played was made for this DVD
I did some searches to look for like DVD's...but came up with crummy wanna be types but more like a kaleidoscope style (which gave me a headache) or really really crummy graphics.  Cannot find anything that is comparable to these DVD's...which is surprising.

Maybe i am not looking hard enuff...anyone know similar type CGI type animations like this?  I want to know if there are more recently made DVD's beyond the 90's...more into 2010 ~ 2013.

I used to watch this video growing up all the time before DVD.  It is one of the most stimulating, yet melodic experiences you could have sitting in front of a television.

Now, over a decade later,I have children and we watch it together - they love it too!
When I recently purchased a DVD player, I was pleased to find there was a DVD version of the video. I read the reviews on Amazon and all seemed positive, except one - who voiced concern over the quality of the DVD. I bought it anyway, knowing how impressed I was with the VHS. I thought I would get a great video, except with all the benefits of a DVD.
Upon arrival, my children and I were eager to try out the DVD. I was slightly disappointed by a few of things.
First, the image quality wasn't what I expected. I found the images to be less crisp and sharp than the VHS version and the brightness was ""turned down"" so the frames all seemed dark and lacking the detail of the VHS version.  Second, the tracks on the DVD are different than the VHS. I actually prefer the tracks of the VHS to the DVD, but I own both so I'm not missing out!  Lastly, the bonus video on the DVD was a real let down.  But it wasn't why I bought the DVD in the first place, so that's ok.
My advice... if you buy the DVD, turn up the brightness on your set, it will bring the detail out a bit more. I'd still encourage people to buy the VHS as well! If you have only seen the DVD and love it (seems like most of the reviewers do), you'll be very pleasantly surprised by what the VHS delivers!

Although the computer animation isn't particularly  great by todays standards, if you think about when this was actually made  (and consider the limited technology back then), the animation in this  video is supurb.  Also, the computer animation is not an attempt (in most  of the cases) at creating realism, it is an attempt at making beauty, and  so it is more abstract than anything else.  And by abstract, I don't mean  random shapes (indeed, there is some extremely impressive modeling in the  video) and fractals, I mean that it is not strung together in a  realistically cohesive manner.  And the computer animation isn't even the  best part!  I absolutely fell in love with the music (composed by Jan  Hammer).  Ever since I have never been able to find music quite like it.  And, try as I might, all other music just doesn't seem up to par with the  music in this video.  So, basicly, this is a true masterpiece of art, and  I think that not only would it be a good idea to see it, but it is  mandatory.",967939200,3,1104,4.558974358974359
631354,4,6303332188,"Although one of the top reviewers notes that the DVD edition had poor  visual quality, I believe this is simply because original mastering media  was not available for the older (or cheaper) animations, thus magentic  media conversion (probably from VHS) was required.
(For those not  familiar with the term ""Digital Remastering"", it simply means  converting from the earliest copy of a work available, in order to reduce  defects caused by copying and re-copying done in a previous analog  production.  Because many animations were submitted for inclusion via VHS  tape, original media was probably not available.)
Some tracks of the DVD  are much better than others despite the broad claim of bad quality.  The  first track, as a bad example, jitters vertically just above your ability  to notice it.  On the other hand, Track 2 (for instance) appears mostly  re-mastered, thus it and other tracks look very stunning.
I couldn't find  the ""snow in black"" effect; perhaps this is an error with the  reviewer's copy of the DVD, or his equipment.
On a greater plus side,  I've found that this and other Odyssey DVDs make for great random-track  play on advanced DVD players.  Like a music CD, the DVD has independent  tracks that are self-coherent, and random play allows you to enjoy it  again, and again, with continual intererest like you would a music CD.

631355,5,6303332188,"Just like its predecessor, ""Odyssey Into The Mind's Eye,""  this DVD has astounding computer animated graphics that will leave the viewer's eyes delighted in a feast of colors and light.
What sets this DVD apart  from the first one is the soundtrack.  While ""Odyssey"" had a  ho-hum soundtrack, this one features a soundtrack written by Jan Hammer.  In fact, the music is from one of his albums by the same name.  The graphic  overtures in this DVD were modeled around Hammer's music, and not the other  way around.  That, I think, is the big difference.  In the first DVD the  music seemed to be more or less an afterthought where as in this one it is  integrated much more artistically into the sequences (not to mention the  music itself is of a much higher calibre than the first DVD).
I would  highly recommend this DVD to anyone interested in computer generated  graphics.  It's a fun and exciting excursion into virtual reality;  one  which will make full use of both the impressive picture and CD quality  sound offered by DVD.",957744000,8,1033,4.670391061452514

Appreciate those who  made a DVD out of the tape.  I wish there was a 3D version of this, and wide screen. This one is not 16:9 ... it is 4:3.
I have a very nice TV (LG OLED, 55"") and, of course, the quality of this DVD was not competing ... but, nevertheless - i was speechless watching it...
FIVE STARS!!! Thanks!!!",1512777600,,469,4.086956521739131

7844441,5,6303332188,"When I was a lot younger than I am now, my family and I went to a book sale at my local library. My parents allowed my brother and I to pick out one thing from the entire store. I can't remember what I chose, but my brother chose this VHS tape, and I'm not really sure why. We had no idea what was on the tape, just that it looked really cool. When we got home later that day and popped the tape into the player, we stared in bewilderment. For its time, the animations were top of the line, and it was really fascinating. I remember coming home from school every day to watch this movie with my brother, over and over again. Eventually, I think we got rid of our old TV and we were no longer able to watch any VHS tapes, so they made their way into a box in the basement, and eventually to Goodwill.

A few years ago for some reason, I remembered watching this tape and how amazing it was, and not too long ago I purchased a VCR from my local Goodwill. So, I set off looking for this tape; in thrift stores, media stores, Goodwill, you name it. I couldn't find it anywhere, until... Amazon! I did a random search for ""Beyond The Mind's Eye"" and lone behold. I immediately bought it, and it arrived the following day. As soon as I popped it into the VCR, all of the memories of me and my brother watching this together started to come back to me.

If you are not familiar with this tape, it is a collection of early 1990's computer animations, which were best in age.

I recommend this to anyone.

Thank you",1493424000,2,1506,4.112244897959184
