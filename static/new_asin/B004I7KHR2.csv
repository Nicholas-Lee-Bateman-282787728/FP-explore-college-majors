4384066,5,B004I7KHR2,"I had the opportunity to study encaustic with Paula Roland a few years ago and was so excited when she produced this DVD. Encaustic is one of the most beautiful mediums, but the process can feel overwhelming. Paula's approach to encaustic monotypes on paper is both inspiring and instructive, and I think artists of all levels will find it valuable. Well worth the cost, I refer to it again and again.

4384067,5,B004I7KHR2,"I would have preferred to spend time in one of Paula's workshops but that hasn't worked out for me, yet. This DVD is the next best thing. I had wanted the hotbox for so long, then I finally bought one and didn't know what to do with it. I got the DVD and for a  month, I sat down each morning with a cup of coffee and watched Paula while my hotbox was heating up. I finally got it, in my time, on my own, and whenever I scratch my head to figure out how to do something, I  think back to the DVD and put it on... So in a way, it is at least as good as a workshop.

I know it was a lot of work for Paula to put this together but I am grateful and appreciative.

I couldn't have done them without her help!",1298246400,10,704,3.704697986577181
4384068,5,B004I7KHR2,This teaching DVD is worth the price. Paula Roland does an amazing job of showing different techniques on how to use the hot box. I highly recommend it and it's a must if you're working with a hot box.,1298246400,2,201,4.17948717948718

8430214,5,B004I7KHR2,"I ordered this DVD just before Christmas to see what monotype encaustic was all about!!  This DVD & her approach to encaustic monotype is something else!!  Her DVD is ""Totally Awesome"" and I was really blown away by this process, which I really didn't think I would like very much, but I wanted to see what all the hype has been about this process. I sat there for almost 2 hours just taking everything in. Her DVD is almost like taking a class with her and if you think about it, hey, if you have the DVD, you can have class with her anytime!!  If I ever get the chance, I will definately take her class, but until then, buy this DVD with confidence and learn, from the best of her ability, what Monotype Encaustic is all about!!  It brought me to ""the other side"", of Encaustics, lol.......Thanks Paula!!",1326758400,5,806,4.389261744966443
8430215,5,B004I7KHR2,"I purchased Paula's DVD about 6 months ago, and it is simply FABULOUS! The artist's teaching approach is thorough, clear, and easy to understand. The DVD teaches everything you need to know about making monotype prints; including both basic and more advanced techniques. Paula discusses everything from the equipment needed to begin, safety, paints, papers, stenciling, registering prints, stamping, mixing colors, and she also includes a great list of resources.

Because Paula includes such comprehensive information in her video, I found it most beneficial to first watch a few chapters, then practice what I learned. Once I became comfortable with the techniques (which sometimes required me to review certain chapters) I then watchd additional chapters and incorporated the new techniques into my work.

Sidenote on equipment: When I started painting monotypes, I initially used a griddle. I later had the opportunity to use a friend's Hot Box, and immediately purchased one of my own. The quality and improvement in my work with this simple device has been priceless.",1315180800,,1073,5.380952380952381
8430216,5,B004I7KHR2,"This is an excellent DVD with wonderful information. It goes at a pace that is easy to follow, it's very well organized, and perfect for various levels of ability. I'm a beginner to this medium, and I felt very prepared after watching this video to put these techniques into use.",1304726400,,279,4.6
8430217,5,B004I7KHR2,"Years ago I took Paula Roland's introductory workshop on encaustic monotypes;  Paula led us through experiences with wax and heat which were enjoyable, freeing and resulted in some beautiful prints.  Since that workshop I have focussed on encaustic in my art practice, but have considerably ""tightened  up""  in my approach. This DVD reminded me of what  attracted me to the encaustic monotype in the first place:  lush color, beautiful texture, luminosity, endless variety in the final product depending on  amount of heat, types of paper, and choices of encaustic paints.  I especially appreciate Paula Roland's easygoing, collaborative teaching style  which in person or on DVD is open and stimulating, suggesting possibilities for adventures with wax, opening vistas for exploration in printmaking. This DVD is not a ""recipe"" for a certain look or style--it is an invitation to innovate, to enjoy the process as much as the product, and it is as much for the practicing artist as it is for the encaustic newcomer.",1303430400,2,1016,5.184049079754601
8430218,5,B004I7KHR2,"I was already an admirer of Paula's pieces that I'd seen in books and when I learned she had made a DVD, I was so eager to learn from her. And that I did. After watching her DVD workshop a couple times, I began creating my own pieces. Not only is it really exciting fun, I have made some pieces that I am very fond of. Her instruction is a wonderful learning tool and one that I will continue to enjoy and grow with. Thank you, Paula, for sharing",1298937600,2,446,4.022471910112359
8430219,5,B004I7KHR2,"This DVD by Paula Roland is not only informative, useful, and comprehensible from start to finish, but also an inspiration, and a genuine pleasure to watch. It teaches how to properly use the hot box palette, how to create simple as well as relatively complex encaustic prints, and how to embellish them with stamps, stencils, tools, and more. Included are valuable suggestions concerning different types and weights of paper to use in encaustic print-making, the effects of variable temperatures when heating encaustic wax, and some of the nuts and bolts of working with encaustic wax in general. Ms. Roland's hands-on demonstrations and explanations are beautifully clear; her manner of presentation is so well-paced and easygoing that it is possible to absorb an enormous amount of detailed information in one sitting. At the same time, this is a top quality DVD that one would want to watch more than once, because it is full of an energy that inspires and motivates. (One bonus is the opportunity at the end of the DVD to view some of Ms. Roland's recent works.) I highly recommend Encaustic Monotypes--Painterly Prints with Heat and Wax to anyone (novice or expert) with an interest in either encaustic print-making, or in encaustic art in general.",1298419200,8,1254,5.06280193236715
8430220,5,B004I7KHR2,"I found this video to be well paced, easy to start-and-stop and come back to review information that I wanted to revisit. It answered all of my questions about paper, temperature, other techniques for the monotype process. I highly recommend it, it's a perfect reference tool.
Enjoy!",1298419200,3,283,5.042553191489362
8430221,5,B004I7KHR2,"Encaustic Monotypes with Paula Roland is a beautifully produced DVD with an approachable instructor and sensational art work.  The DVD provides clarity to confusion regarding media processes.  Ms. Roland's experimentation and playfulness is contagious. The DVD is perfect for beginners or veteran practitioners of the art form.  I liked Ms. Roland's open-ended attempts at a piece, putting it aside and recycling it later.  There seems no mistakes in encaustics, but Ms. Roland's developed eye makes scrumptious choices.",1298332800,5,520,5.714285714285714
8430222,5,B004I7KHR2,"I am an encaustic artist who has taken a weeklong  workshop from Paula Roland. Her workshop covered the basics of encaustic monotype and as I was entranced and hungry for more I purchased her DVD. Not only did I learn many more techniques, I enjoyed her calm and direct way of presenting a relatively complex medium. I would recommend this for someone who wants to try their hand at encaustic monotype but doesn't have access to workshops, but also anyone who would like to expand their knowledge of this exciting medium.",1298246400,5,521,4.725274725274725
