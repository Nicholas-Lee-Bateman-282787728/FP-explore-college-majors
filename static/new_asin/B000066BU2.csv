1712462,5,B000066BU2,"I didn't like it at the first time, because I was used to another tape I had been learning dancing from. But, the more I play The Wedding Dance, the more I like it. I love it's very detailed instructions, and the calm and peaceful way of their teaching,  making dance a very fun thing to enjoy. I hope there are more dance lesson tapes/dvds taught by Paul and Sharon.",1087689600,6,367,4.242857142857143
1712463,5,B000066BU2,"I was really scared that I was gonna make a fool of myself on our wedding day.  My wife had always tried to get me to dance, but I was always too clumsy and self-conscious.  This helped me to make it through and actually have fun!  People even clapped -- and I don't think it was just because I was making an effort -- we were good!  I wol recommend this to anyone who wants to study up and get comfortable with this type of thing.  I also recommnd something my older brother gave me at my bachelor party.  A DVD called ""New Sex Now"" made my wife v-e-r-y appreciative on our honeymoon.",1082592000,12,585,4.132743362831858
1712464,5,B000066BU2,"I've tried dance videos before.  They've all been miserable, frustrating, horrible!  Not to say all dance videos are bad, but if you've ever been frustrated by dancing or a dance video before, I think you know what I mean.
This DVD is different.  The instruction on this disc isn't confusing at all.  Quite the contrary, if you simply watch the short section called ""Moving Together"" you'll learn how to lead or follow in about 30 minutes.  Then you can fake your way through any dance.
I hate to use the ""two left feet"" cliche, but I've always felt that way until my Fiance bought this DVD.  We literally practiced for less than an hour, and we pulled off our wedding dance without a hitch.  We even got a bunch of compliments, and look good in the video.  Who could ask for more?
Why are you still reading?  Add this disc to your basket.  You won't regret it!",1070496000,49,861,4.426751592356688
1712465,5,B000066BU2,"Way back in February, we were supposed to enroll in dance classes. Neither of us dance, but we wanted to dance at our wedding.
Well, the year went quickly. Three weeks before the wedding I remembered we hadn't learned to dance. I frantically went to Amazaon to find a dvd.
I bought this one because it had the moving together which sounded useful. It also had some good reviews.
It lived up to our expectations. We actually only practiced with it for 30 minutes, but were able to pull off a wedding dance that everyone at the reception thought was very good.
Anyone preparing to dance at their wedding can benefit from this dvd, I think. It is a great way to fit in some dance time during the busy wedding planning. We are recommending it to all our friends who are marrying next year and to our coordinator so she can tell other couples. It saved us...",1070323200,6,853,4.405063291139241
1712466,5,B000066BU2,"My fiance and I have a little over a year to prepare for our big day. We were both very nervous about our first dance. He had suggested dance lessons, but I thought that we'd probably be more comfortable learning in our own home and plus a video would save us a lot of money. I definitely think we made the right choice. This video is very complete and very easy to follow. There are steps that are way more complex than we think we'll ever be able to do, but who knows? Practice makes perfect, right?",1050364800,9,501,4.175257731958763
1712467,5,B000066BU2,"I've had the pleasure of studying with Paul and Sharon in person, and -- like in their video -- they are extremely warm, thorough and clear communicators.  For those who don't know, these two folks are some of the most renowned dance instructors around, and deservedly so.  Get the video, and if you're anywhere near San Francisco, take their classes!",1028764800,5,351,4.833333333333333
1712468,5,B000066BU2,"It is very clear, easy to understand and very professional.
Great choices of steps that would make any beginner dance at a pleasing level.
It also teaches the basics of partner dancing that allow you to improvise with your partner.
I would recommand it to anyone.",1020643200,4,263,4.739130434782608
1712469,5,B000066BU2,"Finally, a video that breaks down all the steps in an easy to follow format!  My (now) husband wasn't sure about whether he even wanted to try waltz or foxtrot but once he saw the video, he was hooked because the encouraging and friendly instructors, Paul and Sharon, make it so easy to learn.  They break everything down and go over foot placement so you know exactly what you're doing.  Paul and Sharon not only clearly explain how to dance but also how to *practice* by demonstrating specific exercises which really enable you to learn the steps and feel comfortable with partner dancing.
We really liked how before and within each dance they teach, (waltz, foxtrot and swing), they display the name of the particular dance or dance-step being taught. This structure made it easy to fast forward or rewind to a particular dance or step so you don't have to watch the whole thing to get to the one part you want to review and practice.  If you do watch all three dances, as we did, then you'll love the part where they show how to combine foxtrot and swing - very cool!  There's even a FAQ at the end where they talk about how to talk to the band about setting the tempo of the music and taking care of your shoes so they don't get scuffed or dirty when you practice dancing in them.  The best part is now that we're married, we know we're going to use this video over and over again to maintain our dancing.
If you know a family member or friend who is getting married and wants to learn to dance for their wedding, this is the only video they need.",1020384000,10,1552,4.352941176470588
1712470,5,B000066BU2,"My husband and I used this for our first dance! Very easy to learn. We would put it on, turn down the volume, and dance it to our song. We found it works with just about any song. Huge success. Now, whenever any of our friends are getting married, they always want to borrow it! It has helped 3 first dances!",1241049600,2,308,4.065573770491803
1712471,4,B000066BU2,"Simple stories that bring home the importance of saving, wise investing, and living within your means. I've listened to it twice and am now loaning it to my friends. I wish I could get my kids to listen to it...",1173398400,,211,4.3
1712472,5,B000066BU2,"This DVD is not geared towards individuals who already have some dancing skills.  That was fortunate because neither my wife or I new the first thing about how to dance.  We would spend a couple of evenings per week in our living room practicing the easy step by step ""moves"" and with about six weeks practice we pulled off a great waltz at our wedding. We may never dance a formal dance again but we're both happy that we got our wedding dance right!",1171065600,4,451,4.357142857142857
1712473,4,B000066BU2,I found this DVD to be very good. The steps were easily laid out with each chapter on the DVD and you could replay it over and over until you got the steps down. I still think that if you want to use this DVD to dance for your wedding you'd still better set aside a couple months of practice to get it down. Just because its on a DVD doesn't mean you can learn it overnight. The dance styles are more classical so it will take time to find the right kind of music to dance with-but if you like old style music dances this is the DVD to choose.,1151712000,4,543,3.900900900900901
1712474,5,B000066BU2,"I know nothing about dance videos, and this is the only one I've tried, but I think it's great. They break the steps down so they are very easy to follow and understand and don't try to make you do anything to cheesy or flashy. I think it's worth the $20 or whatever I paid.",1140652800,5,274,4.0
1712475,5,B000066BU2,"My fiancee and I took a 3-hour ballroom dance class with 30 people for $142, and learned only the very basic steps of Foxtrot and Waltz.  We did not learn nearly enough to be comfortable dancing in front of a crowd.  For a tiny fraction of that cost, this DVD provides much better instruction!

The lighting and sound quality on this DVD is excellent.

The presenters, who are young and friendly, are clearly very experienced dance instructors as they provide lots of useful tips for beginners.  The DVD has a whole section at the beginning to teach basic dance posture and leading/following techniques, which we found very useful.  For each dance type (Foxtrot, Waltz, and Swing), they discuss the basic rhythm and clearly demonstrate the basic steps for the leader and the follower from various angles.  They then add music and demonstrate the dance at full speed.  They encourage you to rewind and practice what you've learned.  Next, they build on the basic steps to show several more advanced steps.  Again, they demonstrate everything slowly from different angles for both the leader and follower, then add music and do full speed.  As a bonus, they teach you a few fancy, but not too difficult, moves you can add to really impress your friends and give your dancing a touch of personality.  Once you've learned all the dance steps they teach for a given dance type, you'll feel confident enough to do that dance comfortably in front of a large crowd.

We love being able to rewind and practice the parts we're having trouble with.  This format is much better than a dance classroom, and the instruction quality is much better than what we got with other ballroom dance videos we checked out of the library!

I highly recommend this DVD.",1133740800,14,1743,4.763333333333334
1712476,4,B000066BU2,"As in other reviews, we've tried a number of other videos and DVD's on dance lessons.  We found this one particulary helpful as it shows a good balance between the leaders and followers part.  We took 6 private lessons before we found this DVD and thought this was a better value.  We are looking for more advanced videos now.",1119916800,9,326,4.491525423728813
1712477,1,B000066BU2,"This DVD worked through the first two selections on the DVD on two of my DVD players.  I tried it on three other DVD players and the DVD wouldn't play at all.  I don't know if I just had a defective copy or the DVD's were burned on really cheap discs, but I don't have enough time to wait for a replacement DVD to find out.  I just returned the DVD and went to the local Border's book store to buy a different instructional wedding dance DVD.",1110240000,,442,4.057471264367816
1712478,5,B000066BU2,"I agree with my fellow reviewers--this is a great video.  I won't repeat their praise but offer a few more details.  This video is just swing, fox trot, and waltz.  Enough to get you through any evening of partner dancing.  The directions are quite clear.  Thankfully, the woman/follow wears pants, so its easy to see what each leg is doing (rather than if she were wearing a long skirt).  Occasionally her pants are too dark, obscuring which leg is in front, etc, but nothing to keep you from learning if you watch carefully.

On the DVD, there is no return to main-main menu once you are in the sub-main menu for each dance.  To go from Waltz to Fox Trot, we have to pop the disk back in.  And it would be great if they offered extended play of each music type for each dance, but they don't.

The tone is professional and calm.  The setting for the various dances are lovely--various rooms in a Victorian home.  The dancers occasionally look rather glum and serious, but my husband and I laughted and had tons of fun as we practiced.",1107129600,16,1036,4.423280423280423
1712479,5,B000066BU2,My fiance and I bought this DVD just a month prior to the wedding.  We practice about 5-10 minutes a day because of time restraints.  The DVD is easily laid out with subsections to each dance that make it all very easy to learn.  I highly recommend this DVD.,1088035200,11,258,4.224489795918367
7962111,3,B000066BU2,"Had a great time with my hubby before our wedding with this video. We still practice. Ages of the same moves. It is a little slow, and don't expect a Fred and Ginger experience!",1453852800,,177,4.235294117647059
7962112,4,B000066BU2,"I learned to dance for our wedding, and had fun doing so.",1449878400,,57,3.8333333333333335
7962113,5,B000066BU2,"We bought this video to get me ready for our wedding dance. While I still can't dance, this video did a capable job of giving me enough confidence, and an understanding of the basics to fake my way through. I'll admit I probably did not spend as much time as my wife would have liked watching it in preparation, but after five or six viewings I was ready to go. If you want a good level of instruction with the least amount of effort I would strongly recommend this for any man.",1331510400,,478,4.206521739130435
7962114,5,B000066BU2,"Of the several dance instruction DVDs I've purchased, this is the best one - for the various reasons cited in the other favorable posts. In addition, I would like to ask the would-be spouses to pay attention to how harmoneously these two instructors work together. They provide a perfect example of understanding, trust and cooperation in a blessed marriage.",1295481600,,358,5.084745762711864
7962115,4,B000066BU2,"I bought this DVD for my fiance so he can learn how to dance for our wedding. At first, it was a little difficult for him to figure out, but they actually show you step by step instructions. It took a few minutes, but he eventually got the hang of it. I recommend this for anyone that is just starting out to dance or wants to improve their beginner skills.",1254182400,,357,4.114285714285714
7962116,5,B000066BU2,"As is true in most activities, success and improvement come from working on the basics. There are many instructional videos out there that gloss over the most important partner dance concepts and then teach moves and routines. If you learn to move together first, which is how they urge you to approach partner dancing in this video, then the footwork and moves of most partner dances feel and look much much better. Oh, and did I mention that you will actually ENJOY your dance much much more? That's important for your first dance, isn't it? Learning to dance together from this approach will make it YOUR dancing together, and not just someone else's moves and routines.
I took several classes and workshops from Paul and Sharon in the San Francisco Bay Area off and on for several years. My dancing improved dramatically. I purchased the DVD as a resource for solid basics in Swing, Foxtrot, and Waltz. They always teach with excellent clarity, sensitivity, and the joy of sharing an amazing form of partnership.",1252713600,,1016,4.844827586206897
7962117,4,B000066BU2,"This video is broken down well so you can follow from the beginning or skip around if you like. Has good basic dances and ""moving together"" section to teach more than steps. I wish there was more time where music played to practice steps- we ended up getting out our iPod for more practice time. Alas, it still did not fix my fiance's lack of rythym!",1246233600,,350,4.318181818181818
7962118,4,B000066BU2,This DVD really helped me and especially my husband as we prepared for our first dance.,1246060800,,87,4.5
7962119,2,B000066BU2,Bought it because the reviews said it was basic and simple to learn. My husband didn't even watch it! It was not information or descriptive enough. We ended up going to an actual dance class,1244851200,,190,4.457142857142857
7962120,5,B000066BU2,"My husband and I have been married for 30 years and this DVD is the BEST I've come across.  I started out renting it from the library and it is so good, we bought it.  Instructions for both leader and follower footwork is in plain, easy to understand language.  It has a Moving Together section which is wonderful.  If you have not couple danced, which is probably the case because couple dancing is almost a lost art, then this DVD is a MUST HAVE.

My husband hardly ever danced and now, thanks to Paul and Sharon, he's getting the leads down pretty much.  We can dance and actually look like we know what we're doing.

I want to thank Paul and Sharon for their no nonsence way of teaching and for sharing their art with the rest of us.

I have to repeat that this is a MUST HAVE if you're learning to dance and not just for the wedding couple.  It works for all of us.",1244505600,2,870,4.161676646706587
