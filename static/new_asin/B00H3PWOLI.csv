8629529,5,B00H3PWOLI,"I would highly recommend this excellent video course to anyone studying maths at school or college - or, like myself - one who learns for his own pleasure. The style of the tutor - Jason Gibson - is extremely good; he gets the message across very easily, starting with the very basics and then building on that to further advance your knowledge. He makes a special effort to explain how it works and does not leave out any stages in the process. I have been watching Jason's video tutorials for several years now - and I highly recommend them. This course is a great over-view and refresher on the subject of fractions - often over-looked in today's day and age.
A well-deserved 10-out-of-10 here!
Thank-you all!",1387152000,4,712,4.658730158730159
