442901,2,6302240972,"This flick is not so much a sequel to Alligator as a shoddy remake. This sophomoric low-budget effort plays like a bad TV movie about a swamp-dwelling alligator mutated to monstrous size by toxic waste, munching on the screaming residents of a lakefront community. The naughty polluter who caused this mutation is the property developer himself (Steve Railsback). Wacky, rebel  (well he's supposed to be) cop, David Hodges (Joseph Bologna) is investigating the mutilation/murders. You know he's wacky and a rebel because every time he does something wacky or rebellious, these two other cops say, ""Hodges"" and nod their heads while some corny music plays. In an attempt to remedy the situation, a big-game hunter from the bayou (Richard Lynch) is called in to bag the beast. And, you have to applaud his patience, he waits a respectable 30 seconds before making a gumbo reference. When his efforts fail, it's left to Hodges, assisted by a scientist (Dee Wallace Stone) to pick up the pieces and take charge of the situation when the big reptile decides to take in the grand opening of the local amusement park.

From a nonsensical script to cheesy special effects that make the beast look like a pool toy, this film shows none of the cynical charm and sly wit that made Alligator partially enjoyable. It does have some schlock charm that has saved several of its brethren, but falls short with its horrible characters including the cookie-cutter villain played by Steve Railsback, who is so obvious that he might as well have a ""BAD GUY"" sign around his neck. Yet another addition to the ""mutated animal attacks"" sub-genre, which fans might enjoy.

Be sure to check out Alligator.",1032998400,,1680,4.908450704225352
442902,1,6302240972,"This movie s[tunk]!!!!!! It is a complete ripoff from the orignal and worst of all there is no plot except for big giant Alligator that terrorizes this city. see the original, don't waste your time with #2.",1013558400,,206,4.594594594594595
442903,3,6302240972,"This movie is much more interesting than the first,but also like the first the aligator looks nothing more than a fake card bored cut out. Atleast in this movie some of the actors did a good job but I can only think of 3 which are Hodges,Hawk and the rookie cop(I forget his name)but of course my most favorite charecter Hawk had to get eaten and then after that the movie got boring. I hated the aligator after that,it made me wanto rip that cheap fake piece of card bored apart. Believe it or not but in here there was actually one scene that the aligator looked kinda real was when he was floating on top of the water he looked kinda real. They also don't show the aligator that much in this movie because they realized how fake it looked so they tried not to show the aligator as much as possible like they did on the first. The plot was not original infact the plot has been used in several other movies. Its about a animal of some sort that falls into some chemicals and turns into a gient killer,sound fermilliar???All in all this movie was not COMPLETELY horrible and trash like the first one but not the highest quality eather. Check it out some time,it may not be that much a waste of your time.",1004918400,,1205,4.2894736842105265
442904,1,6302240972,its mainly dump but its not that bad.the alligator looks fine especily with those red eyes.it takes awile for the alligator to come but when he does its bloody for its rating and it attacks a carnival but that was a little cheesy and it has copeyd scenes from the 1st like where it copeyd one of the best parts from the 1st where the alligator is going in the pool. RATED PG/13 FOR BLOODY VOILENCE A LITTLE BIT OF GORE. AND BRIEF LANGUAGE.,1004572800,,439,4.238095238095238
442905,1,6302240972,"Alligator 2 is so terrible I wanted to puke when watching it!  The alligator looks bad, the acting is not the greatest, and the plot is a rip-off from Piranha, which already crossed that line.  So, if you want to see a great crocodile/alligator movie, see Lake Placid or Crocodile.",977875200,,281,4.6
442906,3,6302240972,"The freaky sequel to the 1980 blockbuster,  ""Alligator 2; The Mutation"" is another sickeningly horrifying film about a mutant alligator  devouring a community and its residents.  This time Hodges  (Joseph Bologna) is the movie's  hero, a gruff cop who soon discovers that  a toxic waste dump planned by evil town-corruptors in the local lake has  mutated an alligator into overintimidating size, and it has began to attack  people.  Along with his girl and a Cajun hunter named Lynch, detective  Hodges attempts to stop the scaled menace from its man-eating rampage.  Directed by Jon Hess and produced by ""Alligator"" Productions (you  wonder why).  I didn't like how the gator attacked so many people in the  stupidest ways.  I hate how it always attacks the wrong prey.  In the first  hit it ate an innocent little boy in his own swimming pool.  Good for  horror-film lovers, but to me is very lame.",956534400,2,900,4.88

7823039,3,6302240972,"I am a huge fanboy of water-related blood and gore movies such as Jaws series and I was very interested in viewing some crocodile movies. Horror movies, that is, as watching the Crocodile Hunter on Discovery Channel is a little mismatching my interests.

I've been looking through several movies and I purchased several of different years to compare and discuss.

This movie was not the highest rated, I can tell. Mostly because of the poor storyline rather than the actual models and effects.

The physical characteristics of the crocodile were a bit off. In the movie the crocodile was incredibly fast. In the real life world crocs are indeed fast but not able to go 70mph at one extent. The casual ""dark room"" scenes were used too much. Of course, obviously I understand that it is tended to make most killing scenes in the dark for less visual effecting glitches but too much is sometimes too bad.

As in the Amazon.com plot view it follows: crazy alligator escapes and raises Armageddon in the toilet-wasted waters. You know, I've seen this in some other movie. I think it's pretty sad that the location that this was taking place at had to be in such unusual for alligators enviroment.

At some points they used a real alligator, but they obviously zoomed in the camera to x100 extent. The CGI-controlled model was very unimpressive.

Anyway to conclude, the physical properties of the movie were rather disappointing but will give you a pretty good laugh like in an old-school version of Lost World where they use ""totally zoomed in"" lizards to represent dinosaurs.

If you are a hardcore movie watcher, don't buy this for Friday night. If you are simply interested in another blood movie I guess you could by this at such low price.

Yours sincerely :)",1150329600,,1760,4.766447368421052
7823040,3,6302240972,"By-the-numbers sequel to the 1980 cult classic penned by John Sayles has Joseph Balogna as a veteran cop who must hunt down a giant alligator that has been feeding on the locals. As it turns out, the gator is the product of chemical waste that has been dumped in the sewers by a crooked real estate bigwig. The script has some very silly dialouge and Steve Railsback's evil tycoon is a bit too over-the-top but the effects are alright (though one of the alligator shots was actually ""borrowed"" from the original). This sequel is more or less a watered-down retread of the first but if you're a fan of those ""midnite monster"" movies, you may want to give this its day in court. It is certainly far better than most of the awful new CGI monster flicks that run on cable these days.",1092528000,,779,4.454545454545454
7823041,5,6302240972,"This is is the  only sequel to the original alligator.  Another bady alligator has end up in the sewer.  It is down there for  years where it grows to be abnormal large and strong.  Appears this greed person has been dumping radiactive chemicals in the swamp.
Just like in the first one alligator goes on a kill spring.  Once again it  must be stop.  Unlike  with tremors 2  and 3 none of characters from the First alligator are in it.  I have seen the made for television version of this a few times on scifi.
A new sherrif  and his with must stop  the  buffed up mutated Alligator before he kills ever body in the city.  What they have to do  kill  this one makes  taking down Romon from  the first  look easy.
The  alligator takes for ever to kill.  The try hit it with  two bombs one goes of but the damage  is  not enough to kill.  Then they set off a second  bomb which fails because the alligator crush the denotation device.  Near the end the  inject some short ot chemical  in him that fails.
They have to bring in guns I do not mean machine guns.  They have to use explosive sells which are  expensive  probly cost the city a lot of meny to get because there so destuctive.  Armed with bazkoos the go in and blast the Alligator  2 pieces.
A good movie with a scare theme music  lot of suspense. If you  liked the first Alligator then you Will love the Second.  If you like these  I also recomend Crocodile, Crodile 2 Death Roll  and Blood Surf.",1082332800,,1454,4.202205882352941
