7831914,3,6302812240,"This episode of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" stands as the perfect example why second season just wasn't all that good. It's does everything it can to be the best episode it can possibly be, but in the end serves as a forgettable episode with a predictable story and not much in the way of action or suspense. Bill Campbell is great as Captain Okona, but is given too little screen time for him to develop his character. Too much screen time is given to Brent Spiner as Data, who is working with a holographic image of Joe Piscopo to learn how to be funny. There is a great scene with Guinan, but one gets the feeling the writers didn't have enough interesting things to do with the Okona plot that they spent half the episode with Data. Overall, it's not a particularly bad episode. It's actually pretty good. The problem lies in the lack of plot development.",1043107200,,864,4.474683544303797
7831915,4,6302812240,"William O. Campbell, who stars as the Outrageous Okona was almost cast as Riker in the Next Generation pilot.  He went on to star in the Rocketeer by Disney.  This episode he plays an interstellar scoundrel.  A Han Solo in the Next Generation mold.  He's involved with an on board conflict between two warring familles from different worlds.  The real highlight in this episode is when Data meets Joe Piscopo on the Holodeck.  Wanting to see if he can tell a joke; Piscopo shows him how to see humor in everyday life.  It made an otherwise run of the mill episode much better.  The B story on the holodeck saved the show.",992649600,,621,4.482142857142857
