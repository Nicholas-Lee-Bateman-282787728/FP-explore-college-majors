8357761,5,B0029F2MU0,"FILM REVIEW BY BOB NUCHOW* (FEB 7, 2011) Posted by Joe Rassulo

Multiple and interwoven storylines of ""Shattered!"" piece together the raw and emotional struggles of five men, close friends, crashing, coping with personal loss, love, intimacy, relationships, family, etc. Crisp writing produces a script that enables the actors to have film viewers emotionally invest themselves with the characters on several levels.

The rich talent of the entire ensemble cast is fully utilized under the film's skillful and tight direction of Joe Rassulo. Each cast member, lead and supporting, delivers a strong, nuanced performance to spin a cloth of Shattered!'s connected, tattered lives. Not one line of dialogue or single scene is wasted in telling the film's multiple, compelling and interconnected stories.

The cast and filmmakers craft shine brightly repeatedly in scene after scene reflecting the worn and frayed fabric of many of our own past, shattered family experiences and of present day society's many spills and stains still prevalent in just living life.

Finally, good filmmaking is good story telling. Good films give us stories that capture our imagination, our aspirations, our hopes, our fears, our emotions, our losses, and our lives. Shattered is a quilted tapestry of filmmaking that everyone should wrap himself or herself in.

8357763,5,B0029F2MU0,"A moving film. The beginning scene is a bit rough, but it goes uphill from there. The characters are engaging and the five story lines within the film feel very real.
