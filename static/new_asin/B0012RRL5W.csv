3097208,5,B0012RRL5W,I bought this for my 2yr old son who has a speech delay. He had a stroke around the time of birth which resulted in him losing his language center. We have had these DVDs for only a few weeks and he's taking to sign so quick that I went on to buy the rest of the set and the potty time as well. Thank you for a great product.,1367712000,5,325,3.657142857142857

3097210,5,B0012RRL5W,"I have used Signing Time in regular education 3rd grade and Kindergarten, as well as special education classes.  All of the students LOVE it.

8247513,5,B0012RRL5W,"My little ones love these videos.  I purchase theses for my grand children.  I don't get a chance to
see them as often as I like.  My sister is deaf and it's imperative the kids are exposed to signing.
This is a fantastic way to be entertained and learn at the same time. They love it!!",1453075200,,286,4.071428571428571
8247514,1,B0012RRL5W,This was a lower quality DVD and seemed dated than the Baby Sign Language. I paid $59 for this set and when I returned it I was only refunded $25!!!!!!!!!!!! Good thing my husband caught it. I had to call in and have Amazon fix it.,1443225600,,231,4.043478260869565
8247515,5,B0012RRL5W,"My son love love loves signing time, as do I. This series is a mother's and father's biggest help in so many ways. Besides the fact that my son doesn't seem to engage with whatever they are playing on cable but with these dvds he gets really excited and loves the catchy music. Sometimes when I put the dvds on he'll just stare at the tv mesmerized it seems, like he's learning so much.
Also packaging came on time, completely covered in that protective plastic wrap that never breaks.",1437782400,3,485,4.46067415730337
8247516,5,B0012RRL5W,"Our boy loves this, starts dancing every time it comes on.  Fun, but not annoying, music and easy way to learn signs.  We all have really enjoyed it.  Always our go-to kid show (baby show).",1403222400,,189,4.3428571428571425
8247517,4,B0012RRL5W,Baby really likes the DVDs and has learned from it well.  He is 15 months and is able to sign many words.  My only wish - the 3rd DVD is only about food signs.  There are so many other signs that can be helpful besides many (non-essential) food signs.  I really rather he learn more valuable signs than 'cookie' or 'pizza'.  The other DVDs 1-2 are more helpful.,1399507200,2,361,4.25
8247518,5,B0012RRL5W,I purchases for my grand children both are hearing impaired. The product was recommended by my daughter. They watch it and totally enjoy it. Hoping to add more volumes.,1394928000,,168,4.827586206896552
8247519,5,B0012RRL5W,Fantastic!  My 2 half yr old grandson learnt these in 3 days and is now much better at communicating with all of us.  Highly suggest if you have a non verbal child,1394582400,,163,4.0625
8247520,5,B0012RRL5W,GREAT DVDS.  I purchased these DVD's for my GRANDSON who is in the process of learning to sign.  These are great and easy to follow!!!,1393545600,,134,4.32
8247521,5,B0012RRL5W,We really love these moves and so do our little boys.  I would recommend these to any one.  they are educational and fun!,1385856000,,121,4.217391304347826
8247522,5,B0012RRL5W,"These DVD's are cute and well done.  Toddlers can understand the signs and how they are done.  The young lady who demonstrates is very fresh faced and friendly.  There are also children in the DVD's doing the signs.  There are not very many signs covered on each video, but the ones covered are clear and easy to learn.  The songs are engaging.",1385164800,,344,4.483870967741935
