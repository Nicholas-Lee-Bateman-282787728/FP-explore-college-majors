8171543,1,B00009IB4J,I was really upset with this movie.  This is my favorite movie and thank goodness I have it on VHS from when it first came out!  I bought the DVD and was disappointed that half the movie was gone!  This is why viewers were saying the movie was hard to follow!,1261612800,,259,4.03921568627451
8171544,1,B00009IB4J,I never had the chance to watch the whole movie because it instantly skips from fighting scene to scene...,1196899200,,106,4.631578947368421
8171545,2,B00009IB4J,"I purchased this movie because it stared two computant fight movie actors Phillip Ko and Cassanova Wong aspecially Phillip Ko who has done some great work over the years. Casssanova Wongs work in Warriors Two and North South Shaolin was very impressive. In this movie the action is badly choragraphed and the movie is stuck in the insta,action mode, Phillip Ko only appears in one fight and is quickly dispensed. The movie has plenty of action but I found it hard to sit through maybe its a good thing that the DVD it stuck in the insta action mode I couldn't watch the hold movie.",1144368000,2,581,4.542857142857143
