7957165,3,B00005YUSA,"This is an advanced level film on touching distance gunfights. In the film, ""Jim Grover"" (a.k.a. Kelly McCann) demonstrates four street-realistic knife-attack tactics, popularized by knife fighting expert Bob Kaspar, and shows how you can turn them into gun techniques. Sadly, he does not talk about defending against these techniques (except when saying that ""this is a very nasty technique and very hard to defend against"").
At the beginning of the film, Grover discusses some general issues on close combat shooting, and points out why some of the fundamental tactics (like the tactical L) don't necessarily work in real life. After that Grover shows the four knife tactics, and their applications on gun battles. At the end of the film, defending against multiple assailants is handled.
This film resembles the film Extreme close-quarters shooting, by Ralph Mroz. It is a good and very interesting film, although one wishes that there were more material. Although I can't point my finger at anything particular, I get the feeling that Grover merely touches the subject, without delving in in very deeply. Therefore the price tag is too high, dropping one star from the rating.
