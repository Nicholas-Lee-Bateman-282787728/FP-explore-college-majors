8220994,5,B000W1V4S4,"I purchased this DVD because I miss the ""Old School"" bodybuilders. I grew up watching these men and women during the hey-days of Flex Magazine and Muscle and Fitness Magazine. It's great to see behind-the-scenes and their placement in the Olympia. It is also good to see some of them returning to the stage (Flex Wheeler, Ronnie Coleman, and Kevin Levrone). I will be looking for more of these videos in the future or as soon as some of the price go down!",1512086400,,455,4.493975903614458
