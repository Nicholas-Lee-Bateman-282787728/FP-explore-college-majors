3002128,5,B000XEBXR2,"I learned of Dr. Jerry Allen Johnson from my Qi Kung teacher, Michael Wynn, who is an Instructor under Mantak Chia. Dr. Johnson's work is truly an incredible system of refined simplicity. All of the most basic movements Qi Kung and/or Tai Chi are carefully taught so as to truly perfect even a single step of the foot. If you seek excellence and perfection in your practice, then seek out Dr. Jerry Allen Johnson.",1379548800,2,413,4.594594594594595
3002129,5,B000XEBXR2,I love the nature scenes as they meander past the demonstrators with quiet music in accompaniment. This is a real workout if it is done with an isometric contraction. I enjoy the option of going to a particular part of the exercise sequence.,1366934400,3,241,4.627906976744186

3002131,5,B000XEBXR2,"I am more interested in learning Qigong than i am Tai Chi.  But i liked Dr. Johnson's other DVD so much, The Healing Workout, that i decided to go ahead and get this one, too.

now i do the power set every day. i like the way it makes me feel.  i feel stronger and more collected after this workout.  I've connected to the power aspect of it, at times, and feel like I am building my chi as time goes on.

there is one exercise, called polishing the mirrors, that i didn't see the point of.  As i continued to practice this set, though, the visualization became more real to me and i could really feel the exercise charging the points in my hands. yeah, i think this guy is teaching something tangible and it only takes the time and desire to learn.",1357257600,4,749,4.166666666666667
3002132,5,B000XEBXR2,"While I have been doing tai chi for over 20 years I still benefited greatly from watching this video.  Dr. Johnson offers many pointers that will help you improve your own movements.  The exercises are terrific and not only have benefited my tai chi movements but also toned my total body.  My arms are firm as are all other parts of my body and I am now seventy.  I have been doing the suggested movements daily now for three years and will continue for the rest of my life.  He offers so much information that will make your workout so much better.  For instance, he explains how to keep your chin in to push your head up for correct posture.  There are many more helpful suggestions that I have incorporated into my movements.  Postures that I thought I was doing well before, I learned were not correct.  You will more than get your moneys worth out of the video.  I very much liked the scenery shown and found it peaceful to watch.  Now I hope and pray that Dr. Johnson will do a demonstration video of a full tai chi workout.  We would all benefit from that greatly.  He does not have to say a word, just take us through his total tai chi form.  This is great for beginners as well as the experienced.",1338595200,13,1207,4.306666666666667
3002133,5,B000XEBXR2,"Easy to follow segments and very instructional. I also have ""The healing workout"" from Dr. Jerry Alan Johnson. Both DVDs are excellent and I highly recommend them.",1324771200,2,163,5.074074074074074
3002134,3,B000XEBXR2,"Dr. Johnson does a wonderful job and the narration is excellent, however this still ranks as my least favorite dvd on this topic.  The problem is an unfortunate use of technology; this video has rapidly changing, disjointed, rapidly moving scenery shots flashing by in the background.  It is distracting at best and detracts from the relaxing nature of the practice.  It makes it painful to watch.  If I could turn off the background scenery - or if the scenery just focus on a single relaxing view, it would be excellent.",1294531200,12,522,4.766666666666667

8228099,5,B000XEBXR2,"I found this as a vhs in a library I used to live by, along with Chi Kung The Healing Workout.  Changed my life.  I'm now at the doctoral level through The International College of Medical Qigong, through Dr. Johnson's student, Dr. Bernard Shannon, and have been to China three times studying Daoism.  We use Dr. Johnson's texts Chinese Medical Qigong Therapy.  It took three months of daily practice for me to begin to feel changes from Chi Kung(Qigong, Chinese spelling), then I started Tai Chi(taiji, Chinese spelling), as well.  My immune system went way up, a couple of moles destablized, and I was able to rub them off with coconut oil, and I just started feeling more peace, as the narrator describes, ""see, and feel for yourself"";  you can't exactly tell what chi(qi) will feel like to a person.  Each person experiences it differently, and it is subtle, something our culture doesn't promote, and usually requires patience, something also our culture doesn't promote.  ""Patience was invented in China"".  Learning patience in and of itself is worthwhile.",1451606400,,1062,4.954802259887006
8228100,5,B000XEBXR2,"I have found this a wonderful DVD to follow up after practicing his other DVD for practicing Chi Kung (Qigong).

This DVD should be bought in conjunction with his other DVD. 'Chi Kung: The Healing Workout'.",1450915200,,206,4.722222222222222
8228101,3,B000XEBXR2,"As others have said the changing background is quite annoying and distracting.  The clothes, music, haircuts, etc are very distracting because they are so dated. I read that in the reviews before I bought the video, and dismissed it because I'm generally not hung up on such superficial things.  Usually I'm the one arguing for the content and beneath.  Even I have trouble with this video.  It is just that distracting.

The content is good.  If it were re-recorded to be more concise and less distracting then I could easily give it 5 stars.  It is a shame that those unimportant things detract so much from it. As a side note there is bonus material that has clearly been recorded more recently and I have none of the issues with that part as I do with the feature video. In fact I watch the bonus material more often than the video itself.

I wish I could recommend it. . .  but I can't.",1434672000,,891,4.41717791411043
8228102,1,B000XEBXR2,The worst tai chi dvd I have ever seen. Utterly impossible to follow. changing backgrounds to make you dizzy. I have many internal arts dvd's and this is by far my least favorite.,1431907200,,179,4.454545454545454

8228105,3,B000XEBXR2,"This isn't the easiest to follow.  It appears more focused on motion and the specific exercises, and less focused on holistic effectiveness.

I certainly have learned things from this DVD, and I'm still studying it, but it's not something a beginner may benefit from and it's too focused on movement/physical exercises to probably be effective for more advanced students.",1408233600,,371,5.271186440677966
8228106,5,B000XEBXR2,Dr. Johnson and his students do a very nice job of demonstrating the moves.  His verbal directions are very thorough and understandable.,1391299200,,136,5.181818181818182
