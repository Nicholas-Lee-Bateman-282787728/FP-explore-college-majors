6094712,5,B00GOC74QG,"This show was so far ahead of its time.  Quite obviously it was funny, but it was also a wonderful satire on the various types of people and the odd dynamic that sometimes brings people together as friends and the love/hate dynamic that is so often typical of brothers.  I love the show and will enjoy this product often over the coming years.",1393977600,7,343,4.428571428571429

6094714,4,B00GOC74QG,"I loved this show growing up and missed it. I am so happy that they have it on dvd.

There was one issue with the product when I received it, because it was shipped in a padded manilla envelope the plastic case and center holder for the dvd's was broken due to the rough treatment of the package in the mail.

I would recommend this product to my family and friends, and intend to share it with them.

Now we just need seasons 5&6 and 7&8 on dvd at a reasonable pricing!",1392768000,2,470,4.086956521739131

6094716,5,B00GOC74QG,"If you had season 1-2, you have to watch this one, the show gets better and better.  You will fall on seat laughing.  Love the fight of Joe and Helen's doomed romance.  Antonio is now part of this seasons.  I have not seen a sitcom where all the characters are so great delivering their lines.  All the stars are top notch with acting, delivery and physical gestures.  The writing is phenomenal, you can't ask anything more from this show.  This was the most underrated show during it's regular run on NBC, the network were more occupied with their other shows and kept throwing Wings to different schedules and yet Wings survived the way they were treated by the network and other unkind critics.  To this date Wings humor is still fresh and never staled.",1391558400,2,756,4.58955223880597

6094729,5,B00GOC74QG,"Good quality discs, they play perfectly, and the resolution is as good as you could hope for from an early 90s analog master recording.  They have a ""Play All"" selection, which was what I hoped for.  However there are no extras- no outtakes, deleted scenes, etc.  Just ""Play All"" or ""Episode Selection"".  All discs come stacked in one case.",1439078400,,340,4.711864406779661

6094773,5,B00GOC74QG,"I used to watch this show when it first came out and have missed watching it till now.
An absolute joy to see it again. I also can watch it whenever commercial free and marathon style if wanted. Speedy to the door delivery and a great price. Couldn't ask for more.",1396569600,,264,4.196078431372549
6094774,4,B00GOC74QG,"As a customer in the UK, I'm watching this show for the first time, as I'm fairly sure it was never broadcast here. If it was, I missed it.

For entertainment value, I'd give the series five stars: very funny, good cast who work well together. I'll definitely buy more as the series are re-released. A bargain at this price.

I've deducted one star from my rating for the picture quality which is slightly lacking. Can't make up my mind whether it's because the show was shot on video tape or because there are nine episodes crammed onto each disc. Could be a combination of both. It's not a major issue for me, but some buyers may be put off by this, which is a shame.",1396310400,,669,4.301587301587301
6094775,3,B00GOC74QG,"I remember this show back then but never really watched it as I can't stand men who wear their hair long in the back and short all over like the ""Brian"" character. I watch it now and see that not only can I still not stand that character's clownish look (hair and clothes)  I cannot stand the character . . . what an annoying loser. I also think the man who played it looked creepy around the eyes like a clown does. Of course he can't help it but just don't care to sit around and look at him. Also that Crystal Bernard character is annoying as well. Maybe it is her. And that other female character too. The female characters are kinda slutty losers. Low class when you get down to it. But the good thing is I discovered the hottie brother-Joe. Nice to look at. Too bad that guy is old as dirt now and looks it. Anyway this show is OK. It is kinda funny over all. But they kinda force it with the dumb stuff. Cheap laughs. But it is not what the entire show is based upon like Will and Grace and Friends. Pretty harmless stuff but the liberal agenda appear here and there in the writing  .. . gay . . . communism . . . feminism . . . Christmas without God . . . environmentalism . . . that kinda stuff . . . you see the ground work back then in those shows. But I will leave this review on a very high note. I LOVE the character Sconset Sal. SHE IS FUNNY!!!!! I LOVE that character. I even looked up the actress. (Another liberal nut . . . uh eccentric artist . . . but good at what she does at least in this clip.) She is one of my favorite characters of any show!!! Check her out . . . Marriage, Italian style.",1395878400,,1614,3.978395061728395

8625368,3,B00GOC74QG,great series.,1472688000,,13,6.0
8625369,4,B00GOC74QG,"I'm giving these videos four stars based on the series itself, the quality of the transfer is another question. In a word the transfers and mastering are horrible. If you've ever played with the remote for your TV and hit the zoom button and gotten an oddly big but squashed looking image then you'll know exactly what these look like on your screen. It's as if whoever did the mastering had no knowledge of aspect ratios or formatting whatsoever. And I mean none. The color and clarity are pretty lame, but I can live with that because that's pretty much what my TV looked like when this series was around, but the aspect ratio thing is plain distracting. I was getting woozy watching them.

This is a darn same too because while this series really needed better writing at times, it was a great ensemble cast and having lived on neighboring Martha's Vineyard, I can tell you the characters are lot more real than you'd suspect, lol. Buy it for the series, but overlook the crappy mastering job, that gets zero stars.",1470355200,2,1018,4.593406593406593

8625371,3,B00GOC74QG,the dvds didn't play well and froze mostly. the company acted like they didn't want to be bothered with it so I gave them to a friend who repairs dvds and cds. they work fine now.,1459814400,,179,4.0
