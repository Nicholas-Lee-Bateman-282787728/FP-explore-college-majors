8189904,4,B000P8Y54Y,The DVD is definitely dated but the drills are useful demonstrated from several angles and speeds. The drills are demonstrated from the southpaw stance since Hatmaker is a southpaw but the drill would remain the same for the traditional stance other than being opposite of what is shown. There are plenty of drills on the DVD and the logic behind the drill sequences is valid. I think that if you were to integrate each of these drills into your training they would be very effective. The DVD does seem slightly overpriced compared to other similar titles but overall I think that it was worth buying. I would recommend this DVD.,1500854400,,629,4.7272727272727275
