8323633,5,B001NDLEJO,It depicts the TERROR of 9-11 very well ! It explains with great detail the evil that was done upon humanity that day !,1383696000,2,119,4.0
8323634,2,B001NDLEJO,I just found the way this series was put together rather clunky.  I also think it could have fit in less then half of the DVD's they put it on.,1360540800,,143,3.7666666666666666
8323635,5,B001NDLEJO,"As a child I watched as the building went up, I shopped at the under ground mall as a police officer responded there in 1993 for the first bombing, and when we caught the first set of idiot terrorists because the dumbass wanted his deposit back on the van that exploded the bomb, I laughed but this time I cried and still do for all who died. Especially for the nypd officers, the dire department and ems responders who were doing their jobs.
This was a great set that should be in every school so we never forget!",1307491200,3,514,4.255102040816326
8323636,4,B001NDLEJO,"I agree -- this is a bargain for people interested in 'what happened on 9/11/2001 a the World Trade Center in New York City....and WHAT CAUSED IT?????""  The horrendous events, the people who were there, news stories, different prespectives, and even a few conspiracy theories are examined.  However, it would be very gracious of the History Channel to include one more DVD: ""The Man Who Predicted 9/11"".  This is the story of RICK RESCORLA, who was head of Security at The World Trade Center -- a man who KNEW a second attack would someday be made on the Twin Towers, (an earlier basement-bombing injured a few people, in 1993).
""THE MAN WHO PREDICTED 9/11"", is a monument to a real-life hero, a sad portrait of a man who lived up to his job, and to the word ""Man"", and the anger at his death is undeniably transferred to all who see this sad and magnificent film.  It is presently UNavailable on Amazon, however, (why?) -- and so adding it to this collection -- or starting a ""No. 2"" collection with it -- would mean so much!",1307491200,,1026,4.5
8323637,4,B001NDLEJO,I was very glad to own this documentation to this event that is still so clear in our memories. I had quite a bit on clips from The History Channel but this set offered information that I had not seen or heard. You will not be sorry to own this set.,1307491200,2,249,3.9019607843137254
