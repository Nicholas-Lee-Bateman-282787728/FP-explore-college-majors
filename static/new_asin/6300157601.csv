209528,2,6300157601,"I hate to be a contrarian, but, as a child of the sixties and seventies who grew up on Rankin-Bass, I believe ""The Easter Bunny is Comin' to Town"" is perhaps the worst of the bunch. Not only is the story line pretty much a direct rip-off of the superb ""Santa Claus is Comin' to Town"", but it's a lousy rip-off. Almost everything about this film - the dialogue, the animation, the characters - are just plain sub-par and un-engaging. About the only bright spot in this film are the musical numbers, which are fairly catchy. As for the animation, it seems to have regressed somewhat in quality, even though the film was released in 1977. Believe me, I take no pleasure in writing this. I'm a big fan of Rankin-Bass productions and enjoy having them in my library of holiday-oriented movies. I'm also a bit of a sucker for nostalgia, and ordinarily would overlook minor flaws in these kinds of films. I would say that if you're looking for an Easter-themed video for you or your kids, go with ""Here Comes Peter Cottontail"", which is far superior to this lackluster effort.",1177891200,7,1069,4.572916666666667
209529,5,6300157601,"This was the first Easter my 2 1/2 year old could really start to understand and participate in the holiday events. This movie helped her to understand the concept of coloring eggs and basket hunting, all the while holding her attention throughout. She loved the bear scenes and now always asks me to show her ""bunny town"". Other children's Easter films of this same genre are good but a bit to complicated plot wise for the toddler set. She liked Here Comes Peter Cotton Tail but her attention would wane. There is obviously lots more to holidays and their origins than bunnies, baskets and jelly beans but this is a fun way to help teach little ones that this is a special day and one to look forward to each year.",1176163200,2,716,4.473282442748092
209530,5,6300157601,"Beautiful clear copy of an Easter classic. It is wonderful to see this film on DVD, there is a noticeable improvement from the video version. Unfortunately there are no special features besides languages and subtitles. Also comes in a plastic case which is an improvement from the cardboard cases Warner Bros. usually issues. I highly recommend this DVD for grownups and children alike.",1158451200,7,386,5.142857142857143
209531,4,6300157601,"This is one of the true Rankin Bass classics.  Basically ""explaining""  all the silly things we do for Easter.  I was just hoping for a few special features.",1153008000,3,156,4.5
209532,5,6300157601,"While Peter Cottontail is certainly an excellent Rankin/Bass special, the one Animagic all Easter special (Peter Cottontail touched on all holidays and the First Easter Rabbit was cel animation) and the most popular when I was growing up was this one. While Peter Cottontail came out some years earlier, once this one appeared in 1977, it became THE perennial Easter special of the late 70's and early 80's. With it's cute lead character, Sunny, with the goofy voice, big Gadzooks, lots of colorful eggs, and the Fred Astaire character from Santa Claus is Coming to Town, this is one attention grabbing magical animation like only Rankin and Bass could have made.

For all of us who loved Santa Claus is Coming to Town, this one was very similar in it's story of the characters from their beginnings to the start of each holiday. It was a can't miss special back then, and it should get the DVD release it finally deserves for all the new kids to see this magical story in stunning Animagic!  Just as it followed Here Comes Peter Cottontail when it was originally released, The Easter Bunny finally rolls into DVD town, a questionable 4 years after Peter!!",1140480000,9,1156,4.746268656716418
209533,5,6300157601,"This is a Rankin/Bass classic and one of my favorite Easter specials.  The use of the Mailman character from ""Santa Claus is Comin' to Town"" creates a wonderful link between the holidays.  I easpecially love how all of the Easter traditions are explained in such a whimsical manner!",1139616000,13,282,4.854166666666667
209534,4,6300157601,i think this video is classic and timeless.  Remember all the stories about the Easter Bunny when you were little??  This is like all those stories wrapped into one.  It's absolutley wonderful!  ...,1051660800,,198,4.909090909090909
209535,5,6300157601,"It's hard to believe that ARTHUR RANKIN and JULES BASS were able to Produce another GREAT 'ANIMAGIC' Easter Special after HERE COMES PETER COTTONTAIL....BUT they did!  They were able to do it with the help of FRED ASTAIRE as the narrator and once again ROMEO MULLER as the writer.  As far as the music goes, one reviewer is way off base here.  One of the most memorable RANKIN/BASS Songs is the theme to this one ""THE EASTER BUNNY IS COMIN' TO TOWN TODAY"" sung by FRED ASTAIRE and of course ""Someone's Gotta Be First.""  This has also become a family tradition at my home and it's hard to believe the Networks (ABC) stopped airing it.  Who forget GADZOOKS the bear?  WARNER BROTHERS is to be applauded for this GREAT clam shell cover featuring the ANIMAGIC characters.....now if it could just be released on DVD with THE FIRST EASTER RABBIT starring BURL IVES!

209536,3,6300157601,"If you've seen Santa Claus is Coming to Town, you'll feel like this is an Easter re-hashing, which it is. The story, supporting characters, even the sets seem REALLY familiar. But a kid doesn't care! And there aren't many decent Easter videos out there, so this is one you'll probably want to pick up if you're in the market. My kids almost always get into the songs on such a tape, but not this one. The music is forgettable.",1015891200,2,426,4.405063291139241
209537,5,6300157601,"One of the very best animated Easter shows for children of all ages, it offers an adorable ""explanation"" for each of the Easter traditions~how and why jelly beans are popular; why we have Easter egg hunts and Easter egg rolling contests; the history behind Easter bonnets, and so on, all told in a sweetly charming story that makes for the most delightful entertainment.

She is 25 and didn't have any of the old Easter DVD's since they were mine.  We watched it last night and we really enjoy the biblical content in it.  I haven't seen it on TV in a long time probably for that reason.  Fred Astaire is just as good in this movie as Santa Clause is Coming to Town.  My daughter enjoys that one as well.

I would argue there still isn't quite the breadth of content, but this particular production by the excellent production house that brought us Rudolph and various others is top notch.",1435017600,,468,4.719512195121951

209907,3,6300157601,"I give this three stars because there were several elements present, and they started on the right track, but immediately got lost, then derailed, and subsequently crashed into the train yard in a fiery cloud of unresolved plot twists and deflated ending. Being a Cleveland Browns fan, I know how to keep hope alive until the very last second. But this was like watching Somali pirates attack a US battleship, you just kind of winced and turned your head. I thought the random vagrant who turned out to be a top notch candy inventor and business genius was a nice touch. I figure he learned the art of dying Easter eggs from the numerous years he spent coloring feedsacks for his spring wardrobe; or he was a gypsy. The Easter bunny was an inspiration to everyone: by one year old he was proposing the town of all children begin exporting goods, by two he was playing council to royalty, and by age three I stopped referring to him as the Easter bunny and started calling him Rasputin. This movie contained a dancing grizzly bear in a suit, an evil aunt to the king, and a town where everyone ate only beans and no children were allowed. All necessary factors in any retelling of the origin of the Easter bunny...I guess. The animation was very good, and I think the intentions were good. If your kid is looking for an Easter movie to watch for 15 minutes before going to sleep, this is definitely a great movie. If you happen to watch it any longer, get some headphones, put in some ZZ Top, and nod and smile at you kid.",1428019200,2,1521,4.455197132616488

209910,5,6300157601,This is a Wonderful Video about the Easter Bunny. It reminds me a lot about Santa Claus is coming to town because it starts the same the kids asking the Easter Bunny Questions like they did to Santa. It also starts with a video of kids getting ready for easter with there eggs. This video like Santa Claus is coming to town has a lot of heart and it shows how to be polite to other people and show rude people how to be kind to others.

210035,4,6300157601,"And yet I give it 4 out of 5 stars? Well, honestly, I'd give this 5 stars if I hadn't seen other Rankin/Bass films before and recognized the formula, especially ""Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town"". Heck, that is an all-time fave of mine, and it's pretty clear that this film is basically the same story set for Easter, even with practically the same title. Rather shameless, but I'm a sucker for Rankin/Bass and holiday specials, so I love it anyway! I'm getting ahead of myself though.

This is ""The Easter Bunny is Coming to Town"", in which the narrator from ""Santa Claus is Comin' to Town"", postman S.D. Kluger, voiced again by Fred Astaire, turns up via train (Chugs, the Little Engine Who Could) to answer kids' letters about the Easter Bunny this time around. He does so by telling a very familiar story in which a special little bunny named Sunny, found and raised by a town entirely populated by children, sets out to share the town's greatest potential export, eggs, and unintentionally becomes the Easter Bunny. Following similar events as those in Santa Claus is Comin' to Town, Sunny faces a ferocious bear who plays a similar role to the Winter Warlock in constantly trying to stop Sunny from going on his deliveries until he receives a gift that warms his heart. He also focuses his attention on a town that, while ruled by a kind little boy king, is really under the control of a tyrannical adult (the little king's aunt, whom the boy is too timid to stand up to). Aunt Lily plays a role very similar to Burgermeister Meisterburger in Santa Claus is Coming to Town. Bottom line, we get the answers to why Easter eggs are colored and hidden, where the first chocolate bunny and Easter plush toys and suits of clothes came from, and so on, in a story basically the same as that in Santa Claus is Comin' to Town, but with a happier ending for the villain than simply dying off, like the Meisterburger line.

And I don't mean to sound harsh about this special. It is actually quite good and has similar magic to that of Santa Claus is Comin' to Town. Had you never seen that one, I would understand having no issues with this one, but I am more familiar with that special, and my choice for a Rankin/Bass stop-motion ""animagic"" Easter special will always be the one I grew up with, ""Here Comes Peter Cottontail"", which certainly has the more original plot. However, it also has less Easter subject matter than this one. Overall, this is a great little film, it's just the same basic plot as Santa Claus is Comin' to Town, simple as that. I'm glad to have finally seen it though, and to finally own a copy, and the songs, animation, voice acting and everything are great, as per the norm for this sort of R/B offering (and, yes, I'm a big Rankin/Bass fan, despite how they can repeat themselves). Now, I bought this DVD in the 3-Pack Fun Easter 3 disc set that includes The First Easter Rabbit and Yogi the Easter Bear as well, but I suspect it is the very same disc as is sold solo (and for hardly any more money, so go with the 3-pack). The DVD for ""The Easter Bunny is Comin' to Town"" includes one bonus feature (it also counts the trailers for other DVDs, but I don't), and that is a collection of 3 stop-motion shorts made to illustrate the medium of stop-motion animation. It's not really great stuff, and it's not that relevant except for being stop motion. Still, it's better than I know how to do (then again, I've never tried, ha,... YET). I do recommend picking this up (in the DVD Easter 3-pack, like I said), but be sure to get ""Here Comes Peter Cottontail"" and ""It's the Easter Beagle, Charlie Brown"" before you get this one, unless you grew up with it and adore it, which I can understand, as that's how I feel about ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"" and ""Here Comes Peter Cottontail"".",1365033600,,3804,4.471942446043165

Almost all of the songs are memorably strong though, which is what matters. The explanations for common Easter traditions are altered to adhere to the film's plot. Which is probably for the best, considering their combination of two drastically different beliefs. For 50 minutes however, it does feel a little long-winded. By about the 37th minute or so, you'd believe the special would be concluding. Perhaps it has to do with the complexity of trying to balance the two villains?

The overall running time might be a tad too long and the songs are not as catchy as the other Rankin & Bass Christmas ones, but in general no songs are better than Christmas songs.  I would ordinarily give this 3 stars because it keeps a kid's attention and features classic stop motion animation at its best.

The thing that kind of urks me about this movie is it feels like a recycled version/premise of the christmas special ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"".

The disillusion Jessica, who wants to believe is a small child king named Bruce.
The Winter Warlock is a stuttering giant bear name Kazooks.
And the little Krinkles toiling away in there home making toys distant by a mountain from the depressing drab town they want to bring joy to are little children conducted by a Hobo toiling away in there all kids town making
Easter Eggs, candies and outfits distant by a mountain from the depressing drab town they want to bring joy to.

Like the Santa version there happens to be a cottage that is separated from this town by a scary mountain; this is where our bunny hero learns to make Easter Eggs, and sweets like jellybeans to share with everyone. The cottage features a magic farm that features singing chickens that lay eggs and family that produces sweets perfect for an Easter basket. Instead of a Warlock you have a grumpy brown bear scaring the Bunny and his friends  as they travel across the mountain to deliver their Easter goods.

'tis such a shame that R-B titles have been so badly botched in recent years. Remember the godawful Destiny's Child video slapped onto the ""Original Television Christmas Classics"" box set a few years ago???

Now, let me address the previous revewier, ""A. King"". Umm... I hate to tell you this but you don't appear to know much about Rankin-Bass animation. The studio did not use Claymation in its animation but the tried-and-true wire armature process. Think the original King Kong... and a Happy 75th B-day to you, Kong!!! ;) 'Claymation' is a term trademarked exactly 30 years ago by it's creator, Will Vinton.

However, it was released on DVD just a few years ago by Warner (with a better cover) and now has been re-released in this supposed ""Deluxe Version"" without any additional R/B material?!?! Why bother?? Warner does own the rights to another R/B Easter special, ""The First Easter Rabbit"", which is a nice cel-animated special featuring the voice of Burl Ives and it seems it would have been a no-brainer to stick that one on with this ""Deluxe Edition"". But instead we get 3 terrible stop-motion shorts that are not cartoons, but rather stop-motion experiments that have nothing to do with either Rankin/Bass or Easter. There are also NO CHAPTER STOPS for this DVD which means if you want to access a particular scene in the special, you will have to rewind or fast-forward your way to it, just like with a VHS tape!!

The other thing that really irks me is that nowhere on the box front or back does it even mention ""Rankin/Bass"". That is just stupid! Rankin/Bass fans are a-plenty and leaving their name off the box could only hurt sales as well as shows a complete lack of respect for the history of the film.
