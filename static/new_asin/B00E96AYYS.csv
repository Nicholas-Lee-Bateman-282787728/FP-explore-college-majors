5897770,4,B00E96AYYS,"Although I am glad that Silk Stalkings has now been released in its entirety, the amount of time it has taken for this to happen is simply deplorable.  This particular set, too, was delayed three weeks (it was slated for release on October 1 but then Mill Creek Entertainment changed the date to October 22 for unspecified reasons--I even asked them the reason for the delay but received no response).  Obviously, three weeks isn't a remarkable delay, but to me, it brought to mind all of the past delays this series has experienced and reinforced in me, the consumer, the issues (be it missing footage, erroneously printed episode lists on the product insert, or besmudged episode prints) the DVDs usually have as well as the inattention they usually receive (such as not a single extra feature from season 3 forward).

Does anyone else remember when Anchor Bay Entertainment released Season 1 of this show?  I do.  It was in 2004--that was nearly a decade ago.  Anchor Bay released seasons 2, 3, 4, and 5 at fairly rapid intervals (2005 for seasons 2 & 3, and 2006 for seasons 4 & 5), but after that, the studio stopped releasing seasons.

After four years of nothing, Mill Creek Entertainment bought the right to release seasons, but what Mill Creek chose to do was bewildering: instead of releasing the final three seasons, as one would logically expect, Mill Creek chose to instead re-release Season 1.  Then, after that, it did something even more bizarre: it released a ""Best of Season 1"" which contained only 4 episodes.  Why do this?  Why re-release a season we already had, and then release another set with four episodes that had been released two times before?

These redundant season 1 releases occurred in 2009.  Four years later, Mill Creek announced that it was releasing the final three seasons.  But when it made this announcement, the company planned to call the final three season releases ""The Ryan and St. Johns Cases"".  Take note of what I wrote: ""St. JOHNS.""  Mill Creek knew so little about the show that it thought the surname of Janet Gunn's character was ""St. Johns."" It's actually not; her name is Cassandra/Cassy St. JOHN.  Could this have been a typo?  Possibly, but even if it was, they still had the title grammatically wrong in regard to the rules of joint possession and contextually wrong in regard to what her name was on the show.  I actually had to contact Mill Creek on FaceBook and tell them of its mistake; they said they were sorry for the oversight and told me the error would be corrected, which it was.  So in effect, I changed history.  So maybe I was the cause of the three week delay--but even so, they had ample time to make the correction of her name and really, is it my fault if they make typos, or don't know the character's correct fictional name, or lack the knowledge of joint possession?

Here is my FaceBook message to Mill Creek dated July 13, 2013: ""You guys do realize that ""The Ryan and St. Johns Cases"" is grammatically and contextually incorrect? Her name is ""Cassandra (also Cassy) St. John"" in the show. You have her name in the plural case, which is wrong in the sense that her name doesn't have an ""s"" at the end of it. Furthermore, if you're trying to establish that the title is joint possession (as it is), you don't even have an apostrophe at the end of her name. Just a heads-up. I'm excited and will buy it; but being an English major the error is blatant to me and makes your company seem as though it (1) does not know basic rules of grammar and (2) does not know important details about a show it is representing. Lastly, please don't misconstrue what I have said; I mention the foregoing not to disrespect Mill Creek Entertainment but rather to help and support a company from whom I enjoy patronizing. I'm extremely excited to have this set of seasons. Silk Stalkings is a great show and deserves to be seen and enjoyed by all.""

Here is Mill Creek's response dated July 15, 2013: ""Thank you for bringing this to our attention. It was an oversight on our part and we promise to update it before the release. Thanks and have a great rest of the day!""

Now let's examine the item in question.  The discs come in a large DVD case; the three seasons are divided into a total of 12 discs.  Each disc is contained in a black DVD sleeve.  The episode titles are conveniently written on the disc and each of the three seasons are a different color to differentiate them.  The DVDs have all the content on them from the show.  All the episodes are selectable from a list in the menu, though when you select an episode, the episode plays immediately instead of having another menu with different time phases of the episode to select from.  I prefer the latter method; Anchor Bay did it in this manner, and it's disappointing that Mill Creek didn't follow the way Anchor bay used to do it.

The quality of the episodes is pretty good.  The Season 6 episodes are a little poorer in quality than the final two seasons' quality, but I shouldn't say that the former episodes are unwatchable.  It's average quality I suppose; however, the Season 6 and 7 episodes look very nice--much better than just streaming them off of the Internet.  The nice thing about having the episodes on disc form is that you can ""scan"" them--rewind, fast forward, that is--but on the Internet, not only is there buffering, but you cannot scan at all.  There are no closed captions on these discs which is pretty unacceptable considering the older seasons had them.  But Mill Creek is about ""value entertainment,"" and when you sacrifice quality for value, you obviously save money but you get poorer quality as a result.  That's a shame: personally, I'd rather pay a little more for higher quality prints with closed captions.

Other than that, it's a fairly good package, but based on past releases, I wasn't expecting any extra features or immaculate picture quality.  The bottom line is that while all of the Silk Stalkings releases have been fairly average, the show did not nearly receive the kind of care and attention it deserved.  But with that said, at least we now have all of the episodes on DVD form, even if it did take nine years for this to happen.",1382400000,7,6205,4.6012715712988195
5897771,4,B00E96AYYS,"I'm thrilled to finally have this set and complete the series collection on DVD.  During the series run, I started off not liking Tom and Cassie.  However, they grew on me over time.  The quick wit and back and fourth between them provides for the right mix of laughs and seriousness.  While, I am grateful that these seasons were released, I'm not overly thrilled with the case it came in and the fact that the discs themselves are in paper sleeves you can get at any office supply store.  The lack of bonus material is also rather annoying.  No cast interviews or anything.",1382400000,,575,4.533980582524272
5897772,5,B00E96AYYS,"Silk Stalkings was my favorite crime show during the 1990s.  Mitzi Kapture was great during the first 5 seasons and Tyler Layton was okay in taking her place during the 5th season, but I really enjoyed the last 3 seasons with the attractive Janet Gunn. The male partners for the three detectives were pretty much interchangeable, though Rob Estes was probably the best of the batch as the longest lasting.

Having purchased most of the first 5 seasons, I was thrilled when learning that seasons 6-8 were finally coming out on DVD. Silk Stalkings definitely stretched the boundaries for the 1990s with risqu material and a bevy of sexy guest stars, making it a guilty pleasure that provided a nice balance for the homicide investigations that marked every show.

As it has been years since I last saw the episodes with Janet Gunn and Chris Potter, I am looking forward to watching them all as the time presents itself.

Next up for my wish list will be the second season of Police Woman with the lovely Angie Dickinson and the recently released 3rd and 4th seasons of the Mod Squad, where Peggy Lipton, Clarence Williams, and Michael Cole epitomized true friendship as hippie undercover detectives back in the day.

The dvd sleeves is like the archaic old paper cd sleeves back in the day when you needed something temporary and quick to protect your cd while on the run or until you got something better.  Ya that's what they used here.  No pages to choose, they are all stacked on one side of the box.  It feels cheap, raggiity, and something just thrown together.

No wonder this never made it to network tv ! P U !!! It's mostly one long st john bitch-a-thon !
The fake-action is pretty lame. This dvd release somehow they got away with DIFFERENT actors (!) on the jacket, NOT those on the disc! If U really want to be picky, lousy co-ordination, eg when st john says ""time of death 430"" while holding the clock that says 530 ! Sloppy! Amateur !
season 7 slightly better, less bitching, and ryan got his mustang back. How many ""honest"" cops drive porsches (st john)?

5897815,4,B00E96AYYS,"That is not to say these are bad, they are not, but it is clear that these last three seasons had different writers, the first five seasons have a gritty feel to them & a level of seriousness, these three have really bad attempts at humor that really annoy you, it is as if the writers were trying to do a ""Moonlighting"" approach here & failed miserably, the two leads Janet Gunn (who is smoking hot) & Chris Potter are just as good as Rob Estes & Mitzi Kapture were in the first five seasons, but again they don't get the gritty storylines that Estes & Kapture got, which is sad, there are many good episodes, I would rate the sixth season as being more like the first five, but the seventh & eigth go into ""Moonlighting"" territory, even the Police Precint gets a makeover (why?), & in the 8th season Janet Gunn gets a makeover with her bangs over her forehead, I hate when fashion idiots do this with actresses, Janet Gunn didn't need a makeover, she was fine just the way she was, also the sexually charged atmosphere of the first five seasons are toned down here quite a bit, again why?, overall if you are a fan of this show, I say get it, there are many good episodes, but there some really boring ones too, the final two episodes I think were the best because they really captured what had been missing & that is the gritty feel & Potter & Gunn do some of their best acting here, however it ends on a cliffhanger of sorts, there is no real resolution end here, surely they had to know they were not being picked up for a 9th season & yet they chose to end the show this way, again I blame the writers not the actors.",1391731200,7,1623,4.221864951768489

8602821,5,B00E96AYYS,"The first two DVD sets (Season 1 & Season 2) have interviews from several cast members as well as from Stephen J. Cannell himself. He said of the show it was his longest running show (i.e., 8 seasons).

The first 5-1/2 seasons featured two cops who have a certain chemistry & are best friends who deeply care about each other. They are both detectives and are assigned cases that are referred to as silk stockings (sexual based crimes of passion) and the show takes place in Palm Beach Florida although most of it was filmed in San Diego and some of it in Scottsdale, AZ. Rita (Mitzi Kapture) narrates the stories that she and Chris (Rob Estes) star in during the first 5-1/2 seasons. That narration helps out a lot, but you won't find it after Mitzi left the show.

After Mitzi & Rob left the show two other detectives continue on who were introduced as new partners for Chris & Rita and they had a chemistry of their own. The writing was still the same, but the characters were different.

When Season 6 begins no mention is made of the two detectives who took over for Chris & Rita and Chris is only mentioned in passing at a funeral for one of their own. Where the first 5 seasons were about two cops who were great friends and had this chemistry, Season 6 pairs two cops who also had great chemistry, got married and then divorced. It turns out they tried at least once in the series to get back together but it did not pan out. Carlos lacamara plays a recurring character called Ramone and provides for some comic relief.

Captain Harry Lipschitz (Charlie Brill) is back and it seems like the writing and shows are much better than they had ever been, and he's the glue that ties the 3 sets of detectives Chris & Rita, Michael & Holly, and Tom & Cassy together.

Seasons 6, 7, and 8 are available in one release as opposed to the earlier seasons which were done one year at a time. The DVD's are in a black paper sleeve with a clear front and stacked one on top of another in a holder in the middle of the case. If that's the price one pays to get the 3 seasons for under $15 then it's okay.

The last two episodes of Season 8 leaves us with a cliffhanger of sorts, but it tied up a little better in the last 3 minutes of the show. Reading between the lines (spoiler alert) it looks like Tom will be cleared of all charges, and in all likelihood the Captain would have been back. Cassy & Tom would have started over as Tom said something to Cassy in a heated exchange for which he later apologized to her, but she may not have accepted the apology completely. Unfortunately we may never know what would have happened as the series did not return for a 9th season, still on balance I liked the new detectives and the shows and writing were still pretty good. I still liked the show. I am glad that I bought the series.",1491609600,2,2823,4.287054409005629
