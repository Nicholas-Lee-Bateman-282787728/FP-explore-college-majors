8643813,4,B00IO396P0,Bought this for my daughter for homeschooling and she is really learning a lot.,1471910400,,79,4.714285714285714
8643814,5,B00IO396P0,Awesome program. Comes with a dvd and cd rom. I had not troubles watching the cd on my computer using windows media player. I was also able to download the worksheets and answer guide. This does a great job of not teaching too fast or slow. Perfect for the homeschooling family. My kids can watch these in the car on the go. I only wish they had other grades.,1470873600,,359,4.217391304347826
