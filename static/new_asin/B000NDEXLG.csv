8177087,5,B000NDEXLG,"This was the first Strawberry Shortcake movie I purchased and I love it!  At first I thought that the ""movie"" would be too long to hold my toddler's attention, but the 45-minute length is perfect.  Strawberry Shortcake is so cute, and the stories teach nice, traditional values and morals.",1241913600,,289,4.877551020408164
8177088,5,B000NDEXLG,"This movie is adorable, just like all of the other Strawberry Shortcake movies!  The catchy tunes, bright colors and good lessons make this a sure hit for little kids.  My 2 year old has to travel 7 hours each way in the car once a month for chemo, and we play this movie over and over on the portable dvd.  It keeps her quiet and entertained the whole time.  We bring other movies with us, but we never need to use them.",1233187200,,421,4.097560975609756
8177089,5,B000NDEXLG,"Typical of Strawberry shortcake videos this one has a moral to the story and is very cute. In this case the moral to the story is that manners are important. Strawberry teaches this through songs, examples and games she plays with her friends and even a simple lesson on manners she gives to her friend.

This is a great video and it is not a hardship to sit through this video and the songs are very catchy and enjoyable.

Enjoy.",1231286400,,430,4.3625
8177090,5,B000NDEXLG,My daughters loved the movie berry berry much.  The crown was a great hit.  My daughter wears it almost every day. I had to go out and buy a crown at the craft store for my other daughter.,1185926400,3,188,3.9210526315789473
8177091,5,B000NDEXLG,"my three year old daughter and i saw this movie at a local theater.  she loved it and i did as well.  it was a pleasure to sit through with many great lessons about manners, being a friend, etc.  my daughter even got up in the movie theater to dance to the songs.  we are definitely pre- ordering this movie.",1176422400,4,308,4.083333333333333
8177092,5,B000NDEXLG,"My girls ages 3 and 5 really enjoyed this movie at the movie theater.  We have watched all the Strawberry Shortcake movies, and the 45 minute run time is just perfect.  The characters appealing, songs catchy, and always a lesson to be learned.

The lessons emphasized are using good manners (Raspberry wants a world with no manners)in the first segment, and not cheating ((Purple Pieman and Sour Grapes try to cheat SS out of a win in the SS Festival) in the second segment.  There are several laughable moments, and as always, a good feeling as the show ends.
