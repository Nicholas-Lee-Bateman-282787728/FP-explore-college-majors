5924038,5,B00EK1K14A,The most bizarre film you've ever watched. German influences and a zombie Michael Jackson.,1412035200,3,90,5.5
5924039,4,B00EK1K14A,"Do you ever have that recurring nightmare where midgets and German circus folks take commands from talking toilets and wear Hitler masks and cast spells to bring Michael Jackson back from the dead in zombie form? If you didn't before, you will now after watching this!

Story: Michael Jackson's hand has been stolen from his crypt in LA!! The culprits are two love-struck leather dwarves, acting on the orders of Dr. Cagliostro, a time-traveling sorcerer posing as the manager of a ""punk circus"" in Berlin. The mysterious mystic's mad plan: use the risen Michael to rouse the masses and ignite a global revolution.

Realizing something strange is afoot, two lesbian ghost hunter girls and three horny college dudes team up to infiltrate Cagliostro's circus. Things come to a head when the rapidly decaying Jacko-Zombie Messiah takes over the circus and starts his own ""Rainbow Revolution"" one that quickly descends into chaos.

This has got to be one of the strangest movies ever made, but I enjoyed every minute of it - almost burst my sides laughing! The overall quality is also definitely cut above the usual indie film, including good special effects, excellent acting, a delirious story and kick-ass original music!",1376956800,9,1220,5.059701492537314
5924040,4,B00EK1K14A,"I can TRULY recommend this bizarre flick. It's so creative, so off the wall, unlike any other movie I have seen. If you like South Park, Team America, you will enjoy it.",1421366400,3,169,4.3125

5924042,2,B00EK1K14A,"Obviously, if you're in any way a Michael Jackson fan this movie is intended to upset and outrage you. It's a midnight cult film, blatantly drawing on Rocky Horror, Bubba Ho-Tep and Warhol and Waters movies for, um, inspiration. Maximum offense is intended. You get Jacko as a vulgar zombie, lesbian ghost hunters, gay bondage dwarves, a trip down into Hitler's bunker, a punk circus, lots of simulated sex and gore, crude jokes, the works. If it all added up to anything like what it wants to be it might have been a great cult film like its role models. But like so many low-budget semi-amateur indie B movies, it mostly falls flat. There's an awful lot of it that's just plain boring filler. Plus some really really *really* terrible acting, lame writing, mediocre rock music and mostly unfunny jokes. I liked a few of the ideas, although they're hardly ever pulled off well, and the Jacko impersonator is quite good, but mostly I found myself yawning and fidgeting. You have to work a lot harder and a whole lot smarter these days to be truly outrageous and offensive (except I guess to Jack's hardcore fans). If you have a bud or a Bud and put this on at midnight you're likely to be copping Zs by 12:30.",1419206400,,1209,4.5504587155963305

I'm surprised it didn't release in theaters worldwide. It's a shame that Michael is not with us to be able to witness this beautiful tribute film. Gather the whole family, grab some popcorn, put on your black loafers, white socks, and prepare to be mesmerized  by the pure wonderment this film will bring you and your loved one.",1452384000,2,475,4.780487804878049
