8606053,4,B00EJMG478,"It was great.  Except that season 2, the second DVD was not formatted for the USA.  It was not readable with a new DVR player from Samsung bought at Best Buy!

We feel it was not worth it and it is not a product that Amazon should sell in USA.

We are not satisfied or happy to have paid for something useless in USA.

Amazon should feel the same way and fix it, state it or drop it!",1423008000,,383,3.858974358974359
8606054,1,B00EJMG478,"This DVD would not play on a ""normal"" or Blue Ray DVD player in the U.S.  Couldn't even watch it.  Don't buy it unless you read the fine print about what kind of DVD player you must have to play this DVD.",1404518400,,204,3.8333333333333335
