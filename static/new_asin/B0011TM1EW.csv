The image quality  looks like it's from 1981. Even a black and white silent film would be better!",1483747200,,250,4.434782608695652
8242405,5,B0011TM1EW,"My intent while viewing this video was to get a visual feel for Brittany since I was toying with the idea of taking a vacation there having already traveled through most other parts of France over the years.  Brittany is better known to the English tourist than to the Americans. The incredible images of medieval chateaux, charming well-preserved medieval villages, glorious cathedrals/local churches and breathtaking coastal scenery as well as footage of all the amazing fresh sea food restaurants sold me on the region before the film concluded.  All my boxes were ticked!  I booked our flights and, for anyone who watches this video and is interested in experiencing a week or two in one of Brittany's many historic and charming (and very reasonably priced!) vacation rentals, I undertook considerable research and can heartily recommend googling http://www.gites-de-france-bretagne.com.  The company ""Gites de France"" is a French ""institution"" for vacation goers throughout all of France and maintains high standards for its gite properties at very affordable weekly rates, all charged in euros and one can pay by credit or debit card online. (If viewing the site, be sure to click on the UK flag in order to read it in English.)  To situate ourselves in proximity to the areas we thought most interesting in the video, we found two gites (cottages, both rated 4 stars out of 5)  that were too amazing to decide between so we booked BOTH for one week each: first on the north coast west of St. Malo along the English Channel, and the second in the Finistere region outside the city of Quimpere on the SW side of the Bretagne peninsula with to die for white sand beaches and coastal scenery.  Both 4-star cottages have 2 bedrooms, 2 bath/shower rooms, washer/dryer, wifi, lovely furnishings, stone fireplaces with wood supplied, furnished outdoor terraces/patios, etc.  The cost:  Euros 500 per week during the period last two weeks of May. More rustic cottages begin at 250 Euros/week.  (NB: 5-star gites usually have pools or splendid coastal/on-beach views with 4-5+ bedrooms)  What we rented is perfect for two couples wishing to travel together, which keeps weekly lodging expense down to Euros 250 per couple (great for retired couples to consider!).  The video is excellent but sadly only has a fixed amount of viewing time so to supplement what I learned from the video, I jotted down the names of places discussed while viewing and then googled them selecting ""images"" to assist in deciding in which area to focus our house search. The video is a great ""jumping off"" resource!  As discussed in the video, Brittany is a very compact region of France comprised of five areas:  Finistere, Morbihan, Ille et Villaine, Cote d'Armor and Loire Atlantique.  For a very long time Brittany stood alone as an independent Duchy ruled over by the Dukes of Brittany and only in later centuries became part of the Kingdom of France.  Thus, the unique Celtic origins of Brittany and its culture are very well-preserved.  For those of you who enjoy history and its accompanying architectural achievements, which will be temptingly discussed/viewed during the video, you will be seduced in this arm chair adventure by  Brittany's multifacited charm -- enough to perhaps buy your own ticket and treat yourself to 7 Days in Bretagne (or longer!)",1444176000,,3338,5.038181818181818
8242406,2,B0011TM1EW,"This video is very dull.  I purchased it for a teaching tool about this region of France, but it includes none of the culture...narration is dull.",1359504000,,146,4.615384615384615
