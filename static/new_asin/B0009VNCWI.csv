8067617,5,B0009VNCWI,"Although I knwew this was originally a black & white film I thought it was remastered using color techniques previously used in other classic films.  But nope, this is a plain black & white flick.  Just put it in the player and the movie starts right after.  No extras, no anything else as advertised at Amazon.  I watched this movie when I was a kid, but barely remembered anything about it.  And for some reason this classic was never broadcasted on TV where I live, or ever released as part of other DVD collection re-releases from Jorge Negrete's filmography.  But excellent work by Jorge as usual.  It's totally worth it for the price paid here.  The bonus is that in this film he sings a couple of songs that were never released in any of his albums, one of these songs is a now-classic sung by other artists later as well, but Jorge's version is of course the best, which is actually the only reason why I originally ordered this DVD.  But that I will leave it to you to do the homework, and to find this great surprise.  Great cast too, including the acting work from Czechoslovakian-born godess Miroslava who sadly only did a handful of movies before taking her own life.  Her most notorius work is portrayed in ""ensayo de un crimen"" and in the classic Pedro Infante's ""escuela de vagabundos"".",1319587200,5,1302,4.545064377682404
