8611815,4,B00F30KSS6,"A nice French-Portugal film. ""The Gilded Cage"" (""La Cage Dore"") transfer to DVD from 35mm aspect ratio 1.85:1 is great. The subtitles are well posted and clear. According to the French data box office, the film ""The Gilded Cage"" (""La Cage Dore"") had an admission of 1.2 million in less than five weks. In addition, a big hit around the world. I enjoyed the film with gusto.",1410566400,,373,4.582089552238806
8611816,5,B00F30KSS6,"Beautifully shot and acted film about Portuguese immigrants living in Paris. This unpretentious film tells the story of a Portuguese family living in Paris. Although they are perfectly ""assimilated"" and are liked by everyone (especially their employers) a sudden twist in their lives makes them reconsider their ""French Dream."" It is a universal story about people who migrate to a different country and face the consequences of leaving their native land.",1406851200,,455,5.422535211267606
