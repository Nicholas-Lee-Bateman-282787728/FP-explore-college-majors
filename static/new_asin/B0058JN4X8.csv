4598979,5,B0058JN4X8,"Totally amazing what humans are capable of. This man is ""superman"" in every sense of the word. To be able to live off the grid in the conditions he faced is humbling. I can't imagine the will power and strength he possessed for over 30 years! Would recommend this for anyone of any age.",1323993600,6,286,4.314814814814815
4598980,5,B0058JN4X8,"I have the first dvd made about this gentleman. He was something. I haven't looked at this new one, since it is a Christmas present.
I don't doubt it will be enjoyable.",1319500800,3,168,4.28125
4598981,5,B0058JN4X8,"For the uninitiated few, I would suggest you get a copy of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alone-in-the-Wilderness/dp/B0009PUAFG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alone in the Wilderness</a>&nbsp;first, THEN watch this wonderful sequel.  Although this film does successfully stand alone, Part I is just not to be missed, IMHO (In My Humble Opinion).

I first saw the original Alone in the Wilderness in 2005 on our local PBS station when my husband and I were living in the mountains of New Mexico (snowy, remote, and wild, like this movie's setting).  As soon as I realized Amazon carried the DVD, I got a copy.  My husband has watched it repeatedly over the years; it's one of his all-time favorite films.  We just received Part II today & he's seen it already.  He likes it as much as the first one.  Happy shopper : )

Alone in the Wilderness (and this, Part II), is a narrated videolog created by the team of Bob Swerer Jr and Sr, using film footage shot by the subject himself, Dick Proenneke.  Proenneke moved into the wilds of Alaska and lived there, alone, for about 35 years.  And unique for the time, he set up a camera on a tripod to film snippets of himself living life in the wilderness.  Hunting, building a cabin, fishing, cooking, creating furniture, hammering out his own homemade cooking utensils, constructing cache buildings, collecting foods and berries, making homemade pancake syrup, making stew, sharing space with Grizzlies, baking sourdough biscuits--you name it, Dick Proenneke filmed it and wrote about it in his personal journal.

My understanding is that the Swerers took Proenneke's journal entries and used them to write some very interesting and natural sounding scripted narration for the films (after what I am sure was years of film editing) and created a unique look at an Independent American living the frontier life, told in the first person.

These are REALLY, REALLY great films.  They are not slick Hollywood productions--these are real moments filmed by a real person living a unique life that he notched out of the world with his very own hands.

You get to see him (in Part I) build his own cabin and then, here in Part II, you see wonderful additions to the original footage (building a cache for supplies, caribou, grizzlies, fishing, cooking frontier foods, flying with his brother in a bush plane, and lots more).

These are very unique films that appeal to the rugged individualist/adventurer in us all.  If you loved Part I, you'll love Part II.  Highly recommended!",1318291200,112,2555,5.11566265060241
4598982,4,B0058JN4X8,"I enjoyed this very much. It was very good like Part 1. It is amazing what he could do with just hand tools. The scenery was great. I would love to sit by the lake like he could. I couldn't handle the real cold weather, but it would be something.",1317772800,5,246,3.94
4598983,5,B0058JN4X8,"We have enjoyed the first film for several viewings, and this second film lives up to the previous one. The beautiful scenery, great cinematography, and calm, relaxing narration make for a Zen-like movie experience.

Documentary might not be for everybody, pacing maybe a little boring if you are the type of person that likes fast and furious. If you have experienced nature, this is worth a viewing. I'm pretty anti-social, but this guy must have been very mentally tough to be that alone for that long. Not many people could do what this guy did, and all by himself.

First of all, the movie is very dated (in the film quality) and it manages to be boring, too detailed, yet not showing you how it did things at the same time. I made it through the first half hour only. I'm an avid backpacker and outdoorsy person, but I don't understand all the great reviews.",1483228800,,448,4.409638554216867

I need to be around people, even if it's just walking around Walmart or the mall.  I find Mr. Proenneke to be an interesting case study.  How can anyone enjoy the isolation, day after day, week after week, month after month?  I'd probably be insane or suicidal after the first week but Mr. Proenneke thrives and enjoys every moment.  I do not understant it - but it is fascinating to watch him build his cabin and enjoy his isolation.",1420416000,,570,4.380952380952381

4599119,5,B0058JN4X8,"This is a wonderful story of a man who moves to the Alaskan wilderness, builds himself a cabin and basically lives alone with nature for 30 years. It's such a refreshing antidote to our superficial, ever-moving, ever-connected modern culture that my entire family, including our toddler, found ourselves engrossed, and could have watched 20 more hours. It's slow-paced- the way real life is slow-paced- but there's always something fascinating to see: Mr. Proenneke builds almost everything by hand, he catches most of his own food, he canoes, he hikes, he looks at the wildlife and the changing seasons, he makes profoundly simple observations. He wasn't the type of man who cared about twitter feeds, internet memes, skinny jeans, or sitcom arcs; he simply wanted to be self-sufficient, know himself and know the world God created. He was the type of man most Americans would recognize, not too long ago. So, if you don't like this documentary, just go ahead and get yourself fitted for Google Glasses or a barcode implant or the Mark of the Beast. You're already half-android.

A gorgeous healthy location yet at the dead of winter the temperature can drop down to fifty below and as beautiful as it is teeming with wildlife of all sorts, the place is not suitable to those who dislike extreme cold weather.

Yet Richard Proenneke, who was used to extreme cold weather, was a talented self-sufficient craftsman, mechanic, and carpenter who was obviously up to the challenge of building in a few months an impressive 15' x 11' log cabin complete with a stone chimney and fireplace.

4599163,4,B0058JN4X8,"""Alone in the Wilderness"" is the fascinating account of Richard Proenneke's journey into the remote Alaska wilderness in the 1960's to live a quiet and self-sufficient lifestyle.  He builds a cabin from materials taken from the land. He builds the tools and implements he needs to survive. He shares his thoughts on nature and the excesses of the modern world. It amazes me that this man lived alone in the wilderness for 30 years until he was 80+ years old. Amazing.

I bought the 2 dvd package hoping to expand on the 60 minute production I had seen on public television. Disc one is the 60 minutes I had already seen. It's good stuff, I just wish it was longer. You're watching and enjoying this guy's life and story and all the sudden it kind of skips to the end and it's all over.

Disc 2 is an additional 60 minutes of extra footage. Some of it you've already seen in the main production (disc 1) and some of it is new. It doesn't add to the production all that much. Think of disc 2 as an extras disc. The main ""meat"" of the story is covered in Disc 1, so by buying the 2 disc package you're just getting all the extras they cut out of the original.

I would still say it's worth buying both discs (even with the steep price of $50).  It's a fun and educational vacation away from your everyday life, and it's a true breath of fresh air.",1369267200,37,1344,4.275590551181103

4599206,5,B0058JN4X8,"Middle-aged Dick Proenneke chose to set up housekeeping in a roadless area some 40 mountain-strewn air miles from the nearest outpost of civilization, living in an 11 x 15 foot cabin he constructed on his own using only muscle-powered tools. He lived as the only permanent resident at Twin Lakes, Alaska, for essentially the final 3 decades of the 20th Century without resorting to power tools or anything requiring electricity, including battery power.

Two additional BSP presentations ""starring"" Alaska wilderness pioneer Dick Proenneke are ""Alone in the Wilderness,"" and ""The Frozen North.""

For anyone who loves natural landscapes/scenery and wildlife, and good, true stories, Bob Swerer Productions documentaries are must haves.

Another Bob Swerer Productions documentary made at Twin Lakes titled ""Silence and Solitude"" features some real time footage of an elderly and remarkably spry Dick Proenneke in conversation with the filmmakers.

Three more Bob Swerer Productions documentaries round out their offerings, and are worthwhile additions to virtually anyone's DVD collection.  They are ""Arctic Dance,"" a biography of the late conservationist Margaret ""Mardy"" Murie, ""Ghost of the Forest,"" illuminating a typical yearly cycle in the lives of Colorado's Rocky Mountain Elk, and ""Alaska off the Beaten Path,"" featuring two generations of the Haeg family.

The other Bob Swerer Productions documentaries in my collection were purchased direct from the makers in Fort Collins, Colorado, but I elected to purchase this one through Amazon for the opportunity to give it a favorable review and at the same time give Bob Swerer Sr. and Bob Swerer Jr. a richly deserved pat on the back for doing the heavy lifting required to bring their unique documentaries to the world at large.

Grammarians will be rewarded for exercising charity concerning the dialogue and narration of the Bob Swerer Productions documentaries and focusing on the overall positive impact of these entertaining and educational presentations.  I own all of the Bob Swerer Productions DVDs mentioned in this review and wouldn't think of parting with any of them.",1353283200,3,2135,5.448484848484848

You figure after 35 years in the wilderness alone he must have had extensive video footage and journals.  The more the better about his many adventures.  I was able to see most of this footage on youtube.  The videos did offer quite a bit of additional detail which was nice though..,1337558400,2,425,4.6
4599216,4,B0058JN4X8,"This installment of Alone in the Wilderness is aptly named ""Part II"" because it really is a continuation of the first DVD.  Cinematography, editing, and narration are all the same style.  I was glad to see that because I liked the way Part I was put together and didn't want to experience a significant change going to Part II.

This isn't meant to be some flashy National Geographic documentary, but I personally think it's more honest.  Cinematography is clean and neat, and I find the style to be relaxing and informative.  My wife thinks Richard Proenneke's voice is sing-songy in the spots where he narrates over his old 16mm film.  I say cut him some slack...he's old!

At any rate, I think it's an honest depiction of how Richard scratched out an independent and fulfilling life in the Alaska wilderness.",1336608000,12,811,4.75

4599232,5,B0058JN4X8,"As another reviewer noted, this film stands alone perfectly well, but to gain the maximum enjoyment from viewing it, do yourself a favor and watch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alone-in-the-Wilderness/dp/B0009PUAFG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alone in the Wilderness</a>, Part I, first.  It puts this latest film into context.  Where Part I gave a little more of the background, and then focused on how Proenneke went about setting up his new home at Twin Lakes, Part II delves more deeply into the activities he engaged in over the years.  We finally get to see how he built his raised storage shed.  We see it in the first film, but nothing much is said about how it got there.  In this film, we watch him construct it.

To say Dick Proenneke is inspirational is a gross understatement.  After watching him go about his daily life, you want to jump up and go find yourself something productive to do.  Really, his ability to do so much with so little makes MacGyver look like a rank amateur.  When our son was going through his challenging teen years, we had him watch Proenneke in this video journal Bob Swerer has put together.  It really puts life into perspective when you see a man who fully takes responsibility for his life, and who goes out and does all the things that needed to be done, even though he undoubtedly felt many times like sitting back and coasting.  From the standpoint of what it takes to live a life that is richly fulfilled, these films on Dick Proenneke should be mandatory viewing in our schools.

I've lived in Alaska, and return there yearly.  This film, like its predecessor, captures the beauty of the land and its animals in a way few films, documentary or otherwise ever have.  Swerer has done an outstanding job of editing this old footage into a tapestry of segments that flow effortlessly together.  His selected readings from the journals of Proenneke are exquisitely chosen, and compliment the film footage beautifully.

Another reviewer captured the feel of this film perfectly;  it is almost a Zen experience to watch.  I've viewed both Parts I and II more times than I can count.  I can probably quote significant portions of the narrative, and yet, like a moth to the flame, it just keeps me coming back again and again.  Get this film, and Part I as well, if you don't already have it.  You'll probably find it draws you back many times, as it has me.",1326153600,19,2441,4.861985472154964

8461628,5,B0058JN4X8,I saw this on one of those PBS fund drive marathons.  Had never heard of this guy but was enthralled by his story.  So ordered the DVDs and enjoy watching from time to time.  Just a great story of living alone in the wild... back in a time where there were many more really wild places in America.,1518739200,,297,4.086206896551724

8461631,5,B0058JN4X8,I lost my copy of the original disc but remember being so captivated by it  that I decided to see what the second disc contained. Some of it was redundant but nonetheless it was worth it for the extra footage. If you want a historical record of the Alaska wilderness when it was truly wild and to see how a man can live alone in extreme circumstances these are fascinating to watch. The ability this man has to create something out of nothing and the resourcefulness he possessed inspires awe for how our ancestors survived.,1508371200,,524,4.515789473684211
