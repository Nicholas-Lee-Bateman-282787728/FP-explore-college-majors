2891063,5,B000SULWJA,"When it was airing, Veronica Mars was always advertised as a teen drama.  It stars a ""teen"" (Kristen Bell looks reasonably young, but she is seven years older then her character) and there is drama, but it is a dramedy.  I like to compare it to the two shows in which it competed with in its time slot; House, and Gilmore Girls.  Veronica has the wit and cynicism of House, but is a girl like the Gilmore Girls.  She is a strong female character, but is strong in a very feminine way which is refreshing.  Overall, this show was brilliant.",1223856000,,539,4.35
2891064,5,B000SULWJA,"If I didn't already have these DVDs, I would purchase them today.  Veronica Mars was an excellent show with great writing.  Their one liners were great.  The mysteries were always interesting and the characters were fantastic.  You will truly empathize with many of these people.  Veronica's like Nancy Drew with a lot more spunk.

2891065,4,B000SULWJA,"The DVDs came quickly, and were brand new.  Only qualm: one of the discs was warped, so I couldn't watch it.  Good thing there's a Blockbuster down the street!

I would definitely buy from this vendor again.

This was my first amazon purchase, and it has been a great one.",1208995200,,272,4.38
2891066,5,B000SULWJA,"For my three-hundredth review, I am pleased to give ""Veronica Mars"" five glowing stars.  I will try my best to keep this review short, because I tend to gush when I talk about this show at length; so keeping things simple seems to be the best way to go about this.

THE PLOT: Veronica Mars is an intelligent young girl (Junior in High School when the series beings, Freshman in college when it ends) with a Private Detective father, a bad reputation, and a whole mess of ambition.  She often takes on her own PI duties, sometimes looking into small things like petty theft for classmates, but she also gets serious when a bigger case hits close to home.  The majority of VM episodes are standalone, but both of the first two seasons also form bigger stories, in that you can watch an episode by itself, but watching a whole season forms a bigger, coherent story line.  The third season, instead, is divided into three sections, the first two being shorter mystery arcs, and the final five episodes being completely standalone.  The plotting of ""Veronica Mars,"" especially in the first two seasons, is ideal for television because the story is kept fresh with each episode offering side mysteries, but the pay-off of the ""big mystery"" at the end of a season is heart attack inducingly climatic.

THE WRITING: Here is where I start gushing.  The writing simply couldn't be better.  Much like Joss Whedon of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Buffy/dp/B000AQ68RI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Buffy</a>&nbsp;fame, the writers of this show--headed by creator Rob Thomas--find a perfect balance between drama and comedy, driving it all forward by snappy dialogue and some of the best characters you'll see on television.  Also, the consistency of this show's writing is literally unrivaled.  Even the most quality of television shows (such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Angel/dp/B000TLTCU4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Angel</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Six-Feet-Under/dp/B000HEVZBW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Six Feet Under</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Firefly/dp/B0000AQS0F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Firefly</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wonderfalls/dp/B0006GAO18/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wonderfalls</a>, and the aforementioned Buffy) tend to have weaker and stronger episodes, but ""Veronica Mars"" goes on for stretches of virtually flawless episode after flawless episode.  The weakest writing you'll find is in late Season Three, when the network demanded that each episode be self-contained, but it's also astonishing to see how the writers worked with these restrictions and still made television better than 99.9 etcetera percent of stuff out there.

THE CAST: Kristen Bell stars as Veronica, and it's pretty much pointless to talk about how great she is, because then I KNOW I'll start with the gushing... but I'll say this:  Her performances are laced with subtext and deep understanding of the character, and her chemistry with her nearly equally brilliant cast mates is a physical force.  She can make you split your sides laughing one moment and cry the next.  The rest of the cast--particularly Jason Dohring, Enrico Colantoni, and Ryan Hansen--are all phenomenal at playing their characters.

EVERYTHING ELSE: The special effects in this show are actually rather good.  There are many dream/flashback sequences, and the lighting and coloring of those scenes highly contribute to the mood of the show.  The extras are great (there are a few in the first two seasons and an entire disc for the third).

Critics (everyone from Joss Whedon, to Kevin Smith, to Stephen King, to pretty much anyone with taste) love it, fans still mourn its wrongful cancellation, and I can pretty much guarantee that you will fall in love with this show.  It's one of the best I've seen, if not the best.  That's it.

10/10 Classic.",1207612800,49,4039,5.902061855670103
2891067,5,B000SULWJA,"Veronica Mars: A show so brilliant that the CW decided to cancel it rather than let it air. A great shame, this is the work in it's currently limited entirity.

Were people to save this show from the ax, and with the writer's strike, that is still possible, people might come to understand it's brilliance.

It's not about cheesecake, and it's not about teen life.

It's noir. Good, solid noir, the kind you don't get anymore. Veronica is at her best when the show is so hardboiled that an egg could stand on end.

If you buy enough DVDs, a real ending might one day be possible.

In the meantime, I dream my dreams of Neptune, that sad city by the sea, and hope that you all will join me in them.",1196899200,4,697,4.25
2891068,5,B000SULWJA,"Let me just say the first season of this show is fantastic!  The second season lost it's focus, and the third was just frustrating.  You should buy this series...just not in this set.

The list price and amazon price is about $75 too much!  Seeing how you can buy it at target once and a while for $19 a season.  $160 is WAY too much.  Who ever picked it at that list price should be fired.  $89-99 is more reasonable.",1192579200,15,418,4.15
2891069,3,B000SULWJA,"This is not a special collector's edition like the ones recently put out for Stargate SG-1 or the X-Files. This is only a bundle of the show's three season DVD sets. As it is you will pay about forty dollars more for these three seasons in a bundle than you would if you just bought the three seasons separately.

I hate to compare this show to Buffy, but it does merit comparisons in several ways - the snappy dialogue, a teenage girl as resourceful heroine, an overall season-long story arc, plus each individual episode has a mystery to be solved that is pretty much stand-alone. The final comparison is that Veronica Mars, like Buffy, seemed to lose something once Veronica went to college. Buffy had three great seasons before this happened, Veronica Mars only two. Since Veronica Mars didn't have the sizeable ardent core fan base and surrounding mythology that Buffy had when it went through its troubled college transitional season, and ratings were quite bad during its third season, the show was cancelled. However, if you liked the first two seasons of Veronica Mars you should enjoy the third, and it is worth owning. Just buy the seasons separately, not like this.",1192492800,48,1177,4.798029556650246

2891111,5,B000SULWJA,"Fall of 2004, I tuned into a new show about a teen detective.  I wasn't expecting much and figured I'd give it two or three episodes.  Instead, I gave Veronica Mars three years and only stopped watching because the low ratings that plagued the show all along finally killed it.

Season one of the show introduced us to the troubled world of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell).  She's a high school junior who has gone from the cool crowd to being a loner.  Why?  Well for starters, best friend Lilly Kane (Amanda Seyfried) was killed and boyfriend Duncan Kane (Teddy Dunn) dumped her.  And in the town of Neptune, you are either part of the haves or the have nots.  Since the Kanes are from the haves, all of the people in their circle turned their back on Veronica.  Add to that the fact that mom vanished when Veronica's dad Keith (Enrico Colantoni) lost his job as the town sheriff, and you've got a very hard year.

Keith has opened a PI business in town, and Veronica helps him out, when she's not working her own cases for friends at the high school.  And despite my review title, she will help friends out for free, although she's always willing to take a client who can pay her.  She helps a friend whose pet has vanished.  And she clears a teacher of statutory rape.  Each episode features a standalone mystery like these that are solved by the end of the show.

But each episode also features another piece of the puzzle of Lilly's murder.  And that is all wrapped up by the end of season one.

Season two picks up at the start of Veronica's senior year.  She's now caught in a love triangle between Duncan and Logan Eccholls (Jason Dohring).  And while she continues to help out school mates, she also finds herself investigating the crash that killed several friends on a school field trip.

Season three transports the action to Hearst College as Veronica and her friends move on there.  Sadly, crime also follows along as Veronica squares off with a serial rapist and the killer of the college's dean.

This series is a weird mix of noir and humor.  The cases that Veronica investigates can get quit dark at times.  Veronica herself was raped before the series started, and one mystery she investigates in the first season involves that.  The murders are also quite dark.  Despite the high school setting, this is a show for adults and older teens.

Balancing that is the wit of the characters.  Veronica is especially sarcastic and snarky, and I can't help but laugh at some of what she says.  Veronica also provides a voiceover narration that brings some wit.  But it's not just Veronica.  All the characters can be sarcastic at times, and the interactions are great.

I also loved the characters.  In addition to those I already mentioned, there's best friend and basketball star Wallace Fennel (Percy Daggs III) and bad boy biker Eli ""Weevil"" Navarro (Francis Capra).  All of the characters are well developed and feel real.  As the stories progress, they grow in some unexpected ways.

But the heart of the show is the relationship between Veronica and her dad.  It's great to see such a loving, devoted, healthy relationship on TV, and their scenes together were always great.

How were the mysteries?  Well, this mystery fan often had to go back and watch it again to see how they pulled it off.  Yes, the clues were always there, but I usually missed them.  This is equally true of the weekly mysteries and the longer mysteries.

On top of all the great writing, the actors brought the characters to life perfectly every week.  I became a big Kristen Bell fan as a result of this show, and I have yet to see anything she's done that has matched her level of acting as it did here.  The rest of the cast is just as good.

My only real complaint about the series was the final season.  While I still enjoyed it, I felt they focused a bit too much on the romantic relationships and not as much on the mysteries as they had the previous two years.  Still, I enjoyed that year.  The final season was also only 20 episodes instead of the 22 that the first two seasons had.

This set combines all three of the individual season sets.  There are no special extras.  The individual season sets did include extras like deleted scenes and gag reels plus a few behind the scenes featurettes.

Because the show started on the now defunct UPN, it never drew the audience it deserved.  But those of us who found the show were loyal fans.  If you've missed out on the gem that was Veronica Mars, by all means remedy that today so you'll be ready for the big screen movie coming this spring.",1432339200,,4590,4.5261875761266745

2891153,5,B000SULWJA,"I just recently binge watched the whole series for free on Amazon Prime and was totally hooked! This series is so good, I knew right away that it would be in heavy rotation. I had yet to see the movie and found this bundle pack on here for $45. I think it was destiny because since then the price has climbed but even at the current price hovering around $75 it is still a hell of a deal. Prime is great but titles come and go and DVD's for me are just less of a hassle if I know that I will watch a show multiple times and in different parts of the house.

The series is amazing and the movie is everything a Marshmallow could hope for. I, like all fans of Veronica Mars, wish that the series would have had a longer run but if that had been so then the movie probably wouldn't exist. Or if it did, the story would have been radically different. I just recently discovered Veronica Mars so I wasn't one of those long suffering fans that have been in it since the beginning, torn up inside for so long, missing a piece of themselves because their love was cut down in it's prime. I do however know their pain. Firefly anyone? So, I love the series and I love the movie and I'll take what I can get and I am truly grateful to all of the fans that came before me and made it possible for this AMAZING story to live on!",1416787200,,1316,4.042145593869732

2891171,5,B000SULWJA,"The smartest, funniest,( yet dark )series was cancelled by network tv in the USA. Probably because the the brain dead could not follow or appreciate the witty repartee, and use of a major story line running through each season. Perhaps HBO or a more specialized network would have continued the series. Millions of fans , who call themselves ""marshmallows"" (if you have watched the series you know why) pressed the network to no avail. The creator and writer Rob Thomas was acutely aware of their unrequited grief, and battled for many years to revive interest from the networks, especially as the series was cancelled abruptly with episodes missing at the end of S3. This box set is your chance to to see one of the best shows ever on TV, as it has been released especially to coincide with the Film Veronica Mars that was recently made. How the film was made is another story in itself. Rob Thomas, and all the cast, and production crew put together a project to raise the money themselves for the film. In an ultimate labour of love, everyone in the film did it for free. So Rob T. appealed to the fans with a goal to raise $2million through an online appeal. He was terrified that nothing would come of this, that he had misjudged the true interest of the fans, that they had all moved on, that he would be embarrassed completely. Well, as the appeal launched, the $2million was raised within a couple of days, and the $$$ kept coming in from all the fans such that at cut-off date almost $6 million was raised. This allowed the movie to be made, and to be well made. The fans put their money behind the project in a big way, and in a never done before way. Fan power bypassed studio resistance. So this box set also includes the film!
The series was great- watch out for the most surprising and best kiss on TV in series 1 episode 18(but you must watch all the previous episodes to understand why it is such a surprise). The film shows all the characters 10 years on, and brings them together in an entirely convincing and satisfying movie .Ideally you should watch the series before the film, or a lot of the references, quips, etc will pass you by.
Seems Kristen Bell is ready for another film about this unique and ""sassy"" detective, so maybe there will be another movie. The legions of marshmallows are clamouring for more.
This box set contains the full 3 seasons of the TV show, as well as the recent movie. All at a terrific price. It will become a collectors' item. So, if you were too young to have seen the original TV series, or you somehow were distracted in the years around 2003, this is your chance to ""catch-up"" with the legions of ""marshmallows"", and ""be cool, soda pop!"".",1413244800,3,2694,4.4887983706720975

Delivery: Came in exactly when expected.

Packaging: This is why I put 4 stars, not 5. The DVD case is very nice and the DVD's came in perfectly. But, and it's a very big but (lol), the DVD's come in stacked, you might worry about them getting scratched, but if you're careful, there gonna be fine.

2891206,5,B000SULWJA,"After reviewing ""Veronica Mars"" the movie I decided to ""add my two cents worth"" to the series. This is a cult like series with the people who have followed it.

The nitwits at the network first debuted it against Fox's series ""House"" then for the second season they powers the be decided to match it up with ""Lost"" (the most over rated series). A brief showing on CBS did not pull off the needed bump. Veronica Mars is the perfect example of ""girl power"". From being ""Miss Popular"" to becoming an social outcast when she support her father who stepped on the wrong toes in investigating the murder of her best friend. You have a mature women who decided ""To heck what others think"" and showed the same loyalty to her friends. My favorite over all episode (there were no bad ones) was Season 2's ""One Angry Veronica"" when she was on a jury who's case was a ""Slam dunk"". After picking holes in the prosecution case she infuriated the person who suggested she be the foreman and the of course the wrong doers were brought to justice pending their appeal.

Kristen Bell is great as Veronica Mars.  The other actors definitely complement her role with fine portrayl of their characters.  Great script and looking forward to viewing all the discs in this set.
Have only just finished viewing the last disc and watched the bonus disc.  Great series but I am very disappointed that it was ended were it was.  Leaving things up in the air, in particular the fate of her father.

The writing is sharp, the pacing and direction are top shelf and overall this is one of the best shows of the past few years.  Season three was a weaker than the other two (putting the shows most complex and exciting character - Veronica - with *SPOILER ALERT* the shows most boring and drab character - Piz - was cringe worthy), but I'd still highly  recommend the show to anyone who likes great storytelling in the noir tradition.

For those of you looking to re-watch or find out what everyone is talking about but your pocketbook is a bit light, I suggest looking for a better price.

2891258,5,B000SULWJA,"The show is almost flawless - fantastic writing, the payoffs are great, the surprises are awesome!  It's so nice to watch a show where it keeps you guessing and you don't know within the first five minutes who the bad guy is.  The dialog is clever, and the rapport between the characters (and actors) is a beautiful thing.  Seasons one and two are the best, and while season three drags a little in places, it still has a lot to offer.  Rob Thomas always delivers intriguing story lines with witty banter.

The only negative thing I can say is that the DVD cases suck.

2891283,5,B000SULWJA,"I cannot believe I never heard of Veronica Mars until it was published among series that were cancelled.  I had never heard of it and became curious when it was stated people were disappointed because it was not renewed.  I went to Amazon and purchased the pilot.  I was hooked.  I am 67 years old and enjoyed it like I was a young person.  Don't laugh it is a very entertaining series, and I too am sorry it was cancelled.  Sometimes there is no real reason these decisions are made.  I think a little bit more publicity would have saved it.  Since I had never heard of it, do you think?  My favorite shows are NCIS, Bones, and that is only a small sampling of my interest.  Young people would enjoy this I think.",1363478400,3,714,4.2611940298507465

2891299,4,B000SULWJA,I liked the Veronica Mars series. Kristen Bell does a wonderful job and carries an otherwise ordinary storyline. My grandchildren enjoy it too and mostly I bought it for them because it depicts a capable young lady who deals with the complexities of a teenager but possesses considerable analytic detective skills. It's a nice series. With they'd make some more!,1354320000,,362,5.05

2891301,1,B000SULWJA,"I was so excited when I got the complete first 3 seasons of Veronica Mars for such a good price.  I watched the first 2 complete seasons and everything was pretty good, there had been a few hesitations on a few of the DVD's, but nothing too bad.  Then I put the first DVD of the complete 3rd season and there was no sound.  I tried several of the other DVD's in the package and even tried a different DVD player in my house but they still exhibited no sound.  This was very disappointing.  Amazon made it very easy to return them, however I lost money on that as I sent it priority for $11.95 and was reimbursed $2.98.  But the worse thing of all is I am still without the First complete three seasons of Veronica Mars.  I hesitate ordering them again because will they come from the same warehouse and have the same problem, I do not know.  So that is it!",1338163200,8,856,4.176829268292683
2891302,5,B000SULWJA,"I thought the first two seasons of this were excellent, the 3rd season a bit of a let down. Veronica Mars is sort of a latter day Nancy Drew, and she often has personal involvement in her cases. There are ongoing multiple plots which make this good for repeated viewing as well. Often witty and cleverly written, many remarks will probably be lost on some of the younger viewers, who I am sure make up much of the target audience, as most of the primary players are high school students. Kristen Bell is nothing less than fabulous in her lead role, and Enrico Colantano, who plays her father, Keith Mars, does an outstanding job, also. If I have any criticism of this at all, it would be that a clue or the needed help to find a clue is sometimes a bit too convenient. That is to say, now and then Veronica seems to luck into something, or just happens to be in the right place at the right time. Probably nothing other detective shows are not guilty of, though. I suspect that this show was slated for cancellation about 1/2 way through the 3rd season, as that was when it really lost steam. In fact, the 3rd season was so weak compared to the first two, that if I were buying these again, I would seriously consider only buying the first two seasons, especially if that was a cheaper option.",1330560000,,1293,4.369294605809128
2891303,5,B000SULWJA,"I ordered the series at this price. I had no sooner hit *place order* when I realized that I could save nearly $35 by buying each season separately. I immediately canceled and reordered. I want to add that I love the fact that Amazon gives us this option to do so until items are shipped.
I'm so tired of companies not allowing you to cancel orders saying that they have already been *processed* and then you wait 3 to 4 weeks for delivery. BULL!!

All that aside, Veronica Mars is a great show. I wish it had lasted for more than 3 seasons.",1322265600,,541,4.252427184466019
2891304,5,B000SULWJA,"I love the Veronica Mars series. I didn't discover it until many years after it was on-air, but I am so glad for the DVDs! The writing is funny and smart, the plot lines are always interesting and you'll just love the characters. Kristen Bell is great as Veronica, but the rest of the cast is just fantastic as well. I have already been through the entire series once and can't wait to start again -- you'll be hooked.",1321660800,,418,4.30379746835443
2891305,5,B000SULWJA,"This is one of my favorite shows of all times! I can watch it over and over again. The writing is witty, the charachters feel real, and the plot thickens in a wonderful way.

2891306,3,B000SULWJA,"Firstly, as a show, this one rocks.  I personally hated Kristen Bell and whenever I saw her on TV/Movie, I wanted to punch my TV.  This show turned her around for me (HATE TO ADMIT IT!!!)  I wanted so badly to continue to hate her, but &#@^ it, she wins.  This show was well written, great characters, and engaging.  Sad it was cancelled.  So, watch the show, BUY the DVD's, but not at the current price.  I just bought all three.  The listing right now is $179.99.  The discount offered saves you $53.99 off that price, making it what?  $129.99 or somewhere around that?  I just bought all three for $53.99.  Why would I pay an extra $75.00 to get them bundled together?  Buy them seperately.  If you insist on spending the extra money, buy them seperately and send me the additional 75 bucks.",1300233600,2,794,4.423611111111111

2891319,4,B000SULWJA,"I never really paid attention to Veronica Mars when it originally aired, so I didn't know or care what I was missing. I recently found it on Netflix and decided to give it a whirl, just so I could see what it was about. After the first episode, I was hooked. The first season was fantastic, however, the second was okay, and the third was very choppy. The abrupt ending is what frustrates me because they left the character relationships and story lines unresolved. If I was to buy Veronica Mars, I would only get the first two seasons. However, if the story ever gets finished with a movie or something, I would most definitely buy them all. In the meantime, Veronica Mars is definitely worth checking out.",1292112000,,707,4.53125
2891320,5,B000SULWJA,"There are a few shows I watch on television that I really enjoyed once: CSI, The Medium, Castle, and the Mentalist were among my favorites.
I once laughed at the wit of Two and a Half Men. Then along came Veronica Mars. And now those shows seem tedious, or like watching TV in black and white.
There is just no way you could know what I mean without watching at least the first season. It is the most compelling, heart wrenching show I have ever seen. And the wit!
I will own everything I can find on Veronica Mars. I am still in grief that it is over so soon. And I have a pressing question:
WHO KILLED VERONICA MARS???
I never heard of it until I stumbled across it on Netflix. And it must have been fate because if I didn't know it was there I wouldn't find it now. I try going through the links to see how I did come upon it the first time and nothing but the name will bring it up.
Whoever was responsible for getting the word out, for promoting this show, should find another job, if he can't sell Veronica Mars.
Now every night I pray to whatever powers there be, ""Don't leave me like this, please. Bring her back, her and Logan, and Weevil and her wonderful father Keith Mars. Life just ain't the same without them.",1286582400,2,1223,4.186440677966102
2891321,4,B000SULWJA,"I bought the complete series of ""Veronica Mars"" for my college roommate for her birthday last year. She has been going on and on about this show for as long as I can remember. Unfortunately, she didn't own the series and was watching it with her boyfriend.. evidently, they broke up in the middle of season two and she hasn't stopped talking about wanting to see the rest of it since. It was much cheaper when I bought it than it is today by the way.. but I am glad to have found the entire series in one big package. It made my life so much easier!! Because my college roommate and I now live in seperate states, she has since mailed me the first season so that I can watch it for myself, and I must admit, it is a great show! It is obviously geared toward persons in high school as the show is set around a high school.. but the show came out when I was in high school; it was something I would have watched then (if I had had the time) and something I would still watch today. Even if the show is set at a high school, the themes are generally the type the 20-something year olds can relate to as well. After watching one episode with Kristen Bell, one is hooked. I didn't think I would enjoy it as much as I did, but this girl can act! She made the show totally believable and entirely entertaining. I can't wait until my roommate sends me season two to watch :)",1269129600,,1366,4.119850187265918

Awesome plots, complex characters, sardonic humour and palpable chemistry between the cast members makes for riveting viewing. Series 1 sets it all up so well, Series 2 (my favourite) is epic and Series 3 is good fun. Fell in love with the character of Logan(Jason Dohring), you've gotto love a good bad boy who wants to be redeemed by the woman he loves, and of course Veronica (Kristen Bell), the lynchpin of the series, is wonderful as the ""I refuse to be a victim"" hero.

Veronica is my hero--a strong, creative, persevering and clever woman capable of change and standing up for herself--despite her flaws.
