8431683,3,B004J5RZFK,"I was so excited about the Databazar project of releasing Bengali movies on dvd I bought four movies; it was a not a very good idea. So far I have watched this one and 'Gorosthane Sabdhan': both suffer from poor picture quality and have forced subtitles. On top of that this dvd comes with a black bar at the bottom with the forced subtitle. I guess you get what you pay for, (actually I paid quite a bit because I got the dvds shipped to UK,) but I wish I was at least warned about the forced subtitles. The movie itself is a nice satire, with good acting (in parts) and excellent music.  Three stars for the movie, zero for the dvd.",1326931200,,634,4.19672131147541
