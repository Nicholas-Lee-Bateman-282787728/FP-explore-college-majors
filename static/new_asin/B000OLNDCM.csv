I always considered Ida Lupino as a great yet underrated actress.  She could do any role.  She is really funny in this, of course, along with Lucy!

I recommend buying the VHS over the DVD only due to the fact that it will have the complete show.  Another Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour that I recommend is The Celebrity Next Door co-starring Tallulah Bankhead which is hilarious, dahhhrling!",1346112000,,581,4.702970297029703
