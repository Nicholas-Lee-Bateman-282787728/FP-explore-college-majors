8090945,5,B000BQ5J5Y,"I owned this disc several years ago and actually wore it out from using it so much.  It has a lot of options to fit different time frames, different levels of skill and targeting certain areas.  After I wore my first one out I couldn't find this one and so went with a Gaium series and never really liked it and so lost the habit of keeping up with pilates; my husband found this and I'm back on track.
Top things I like:  being able to choose a work-out that fits my time frame and skill and the instructor is very clear.  I haven't found anything I don't like!",1365811200,2,562,4.128440366972477
8090946,4,B000BQ5J5Y,The item arrived in perfect condition and timely.  It has quite a selection of movements and I just have to take the time to actually go through them all!,1356566400,2,154,4.310344827586207
8090947,4,B000BQ5J5Y,The video has many short routines which is nice when you don't have a lot of time.,1278374400,2,82,3.8823529411764706
8090948,5,B000BQ5J5Y,"I got this DVD as a Christmas gift. It's great for anyone new to Pilates or for those who want to improve their form. The instructor was great at explaining the fundamentals of Pilates. Pilates is one of those things that is hard to learn without a live instructor, but this DVD comes close for those who can't afford live instruction or don't have it near them. An excellent feature of this DVD is that you can customize the time and difficulty of your workout.",1139443200,50,462,4.447058823529412
