8469029,4,B005ETQ2N6,"we've seen this film before many times...or at least the plot. there is nothing exceptional here, but the score by muir mathieson (tho very aggressive) is pleasing.  filmed in desert Libya the scenes are grand and more than sand and camels.  actors Anthony steel, Donald sinden and the wonderful Donald plesence are well directed by brian desmond hurst. I would say it's a bit dated, but politics never let's us find out if war will ever be dated.  oh yes, belly dancing doesn't change either.",1508976000,,493,4.776470588235294

8469033,2,B005ETQ2N6,"The Black Tent, 1956 film

This story begins at a large mansion in the English country where a man gets a message. Next we see a city. Colonel Holland inherited a large estate after his older brother died in the North African desert campaign. What if he didn't die? A promissary note from this brother was just honored. Could it be traced? He will try by going to Libya. We see the camel market. [Note the riding position.] They reach the black tent. ""Salaam Aleichem."" He asks a question and gets the answer about his brother. The details are vague. The next morning he sees a boy who looks familiar. The sheik explains why some of their children are fair. ""There is nothing more to say."" But Holland gets papers in a gray sock: the diary of Captain David Holland. It tells about the war. David survived a battle and walked to a Bedouin camp. [Note the goats with black wool.]

David is with friends. Nabuka feeds him. He learns Tobruk has fallen, he has no place to return to. We see scenes of tribal society. [Are fly whisks a badge of class?] Germans arrive in camp. David is taken to the old Roman ruins, a theater, to hide. The Germans find a British revolver! They leave to visit the old Roman ruins to take photographs. David plans to capture a German vehicle to return to his lines. There, only a poor man has no wife. David promises Nabuka to come back and marry her, but he is not from there and doesn't know their ways. They are watched by a man. She is promised to another. Another day brings a German tourist car. David shoots them, a grenade finishes the men in the car. One of them was a Bedouin. They learn of the victory of Rommel, David has no place to go. There is a marriage and a feast. [Note their bagpipes.] They watch a ""danse du ventre"". The bride is given a bath. They are together the next morning. They visit the old Roman ruins. They play a board game too.

A visitor tells of the British victory at El Alamein. David must return to his lines. He writes a record of his events. ""I will come back."" Colonel Holland returns to get the rest of the story. He and the Beduins attack a truck convoy successfully and take the supplies. Two German tanks shell them. David is fatally wounded while saving the Sheik's life. Then Holland reads the last page - it is David's Last Will and Testament! It leaves his fortune to David's son, Daoud. The family discusses the implications for Daoud. Holland tells him about England. Their pastures are rich from all the rain. What will Daoud choose? He will stay with the only family and society he knows, and not be a stranger in a strange land.

The appeal of this story is its seemingly unexpected ending, which goes against the audience's expectations. Most people would choose great riches if given a choice (it would not mean a change in their society). [Suppose a boy in England was told of great riches if he moved to the North African desert? Would he do it?] This movie is also like a travelogue that tells about life among the Bedouin tribes of North Africa. This movie was made with the cooperation of the Government and Army of Libya. [Was it made before the Suez Campaign?]",1352592000,,3149,4.424137931034482
8469034,4,B005ETQ2N6,"I really liked the 1956 movie ""The Black Tent"" featuring unknown actors because it is an unusual adventure romance.  Set in Libya, WWII, a wandering wounded English army officer is helped by a pretty young Bedouin lady and her honourable father.  Like so much of real life, it goes happy, sad and then happy at the end.  Watch this movie; it touched my heart.  Eric ""the Red"".",1320192000,3,376,4.567164179104478

* Special Footnote:  -- Italian actress Anna-Maria  English was so poor, her dialogue had to be completely dubbed by Nanette Newman, wife of the film's screenwriter, Bryan Forbes. Forbes himself played a dying enemy soldier, a role that took three days to shoot, but the footage ended up on the cutting room floor
