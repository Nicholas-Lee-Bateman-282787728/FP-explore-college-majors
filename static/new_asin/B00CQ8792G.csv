5734723,4,B00CQ8792G,"I like that the author return to the aspect of the original movie, friendship and discovery. The visual aspect is fine. Hope to leave this hystory between the bad guys and the good guys ...",1376956800,,189,4.428571428571429
5734724,3,B00CQ8792G,price was too high for the product with cross boarder fees and postage added could have purchased for $12.00 here,1376611200,,113,4.7
5734725,5,B00CQ8792G,I haven't seen them all but good to have the TV series that will connect the two movies. I'm also glad they are starting to release figures.,1376611200,,140,4.222222222222222
5734726,4,B00CQ8792G,"The tv show is just more of the same goodness, without any sign of sequel fatigue. More dragons, more adventures, the only downpoint is a lack of insight of the production; there is one, but it only leaves a door opened, having you want more !",1375401600,,243,4.304347826086956

Luckily many of the original voice cast from the feature film return to voice their characters in this Cartoon Network TV Series.  The few voices that had to be recast are masterfully done to where they sound very much like their feature film counterparts.  Beyond the voice acting, the stories & animation present in this 1st season are top-notch and are a great way to pass the time until the 2nd feature film due out in 2014.  One touch I like is how Hiccup narrates the beginning & end of the episodes as he did in the original film.

Part 2 consists of 2 discs with the remaining 9 episodes of season 1; each episode running approximately 22 1/2 minutes.  Each disc features a ""play all"" function for the episodes.  The dvd case comes with a slipcover and has two slips inside: one is a code for the Ultimate Battle Pack to be used in the online/mobile game School of Dragons (limited time offer); the other is a coupon good for $3 off on a new Defenders of Berk Action Dragon Toy (coupon valid from 7/30/13 to 1/31/14).  The first 11 episodes of season 1 can be found on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dragons-Riders-of-Berk-Part-1/dp/B00CQ8792Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dragons: Riders of Berk - Part 1</a>

I personally am very pleased with the video & audio presentation of the episodes.  The audio is available only in English with Dolby Digital 5.1; subtitles are available in English, Spanish, and French.  As with most, if not all, DreamWorks releases one of the special features is the World of DreamWorks Animation which features sneak peeks into other DreamWorks animation properties.  Another Sneak Peeks section also includes some other animation theatrical trailers as well as a look at the Dragon toys for which the included coupon can be used.  ""Dragon Tracker Part 2"" provides an overview of the 3 new types of dragons introduced in the included 9 episodes.  ""Evolution of Whispering Death"" is a behind the scenes look at the creation of one of these new dragons.  The final bonus feature is a music video titled ""Fly High"" Dragon Mash-Up.

The actual episodes on the 2 discs are as follows:
12) Thawfest (my favorite of the 1st season episodes)
13) When Lightning Strikes
14) What Flies Beneath
15) Twinsanity
16) Defiant One
17) Breakneck Bog
18) Gem of a Different Color
19) We Are Family Part 1
20) We Are Family Part 2

Regarding my rating of 4 stars, I based it mainly upon a semi-weak selection of bonus features.  It would have been nice to see much more substantial behind the scenes features on the animation & voice talent behind this wonderful series along with possibly some deleted/abandoned scenes/story ideas and some episode commentaries.  Offering the series in Blu-ray would have been good, too, as well as a single full season release vs 2 separate volumes.

The series, itself, I rate 5 stars and highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the original film.  And while it would have been great to have a single full season release, don't let that stop you from picking up this terrific series; the pricing is reasonable enough to allow for purchasing both volumes.  Plus you'll want to get ready for the start of season 2: Defenders of Berk which begins in September.  And if you haven't seen the original feature film yet, why not???  It's definitely recommended viewing and should be seen before beginning the TV series; trust me: you'll love it!",1374624000,47,4189,5.529780564263323
5734728,2,B00CQ8792G,"What do they mean ""Part 2"" and How can they have a DVD of ""season 2"" when it is not yet released??
How about a list of what Episodes are on this DVD please!?!
People, listen up: Season Two is NOT out yet, in fact, Season One just recently wrapped up!",1374537600,,250,3.9215686274509802
5734729,2,B00CQ8792G,"Previous reviewer is confused...there has been only one season of this program...the sequel to the first movie is in the works.  The first 4 episodes already released on DVD this year, but I can't find any information as to what is on these new 'part one & part two' DVD releases...is this the whole season one? Part of season one? Do these discs pick up where the first DVD before part one ended, or are there redundant episodes with an expectation to 'double dip' & buy same consecutive episodes twice? Odd to omit both episode lists and picture of back of DVD packaging to help consumer know what is being sold here....we usually have this info by release date, which is today. Great show, misleading, cryptic solicitation and product description. Show gets 5 stars....great program.",1374537600,,786,4.822222222222222

5734830,5,B00CQ8792G,"Hands down, one of my favorite kids shows...ever.  And that's saying a lot...as I said in the title, I've got three kids, and over the years I've seen pretty much everything there is for kids to watch.  If you like the ""How to Train Your Dragon"" movies, you'll love these.  There's enough episodes that they have the time to explore all of the characters (and their dragons) much more in-depth than they ever could in a movie (and yes, I just said that about a computer generated kids cartoon).  The animation gets better and better as the show progresses, until it's at least as good as the first movie.  The series has a nice mix of action (that's not so scary I wouldn't let my 4 (now 5) year old watch it, and it humor--some of which is only going to be funny to adults which is a nice nod to the fact that grownups will be watching too.  Ruff Nut and Tuff Nut always crack me up lol.
Anyway, it's a great series that the whole family can enjoy.  I almost never give five stars to anything...but I gave it this show.",1404691200,,1020,4.253886010362694

5734832,5,B00CQ8792G,I love How To Train Your Dragon. I love the silliness of the characters! They can be serious too. I felt like a kid again watching it! I love the shenanigans too! SO many fun adventures that I love watching over and over and over again! With this crew you'll never be bored!,1404086400,,274,4.188679245283019

The twins still dumb as ever. Astrid is tough girl, and the girl Hiccup has a crush on. Snotlout still the tough guy, and Fishlegs the dragon fact expert. The dragons are there, Toothless of course plus a whole number of dragons not seen in the movie.
My 13 year old son and I both love the How to Dragon your Dragon TV series. So worth watching, whether you have kiddos or not.",1401667200,,542,4.171428571428572
5734837,4,B00CQ8792G,"Most of these are excellent, but they took a tail-spin on the last 2 episodes of the 2nd DVD.  The writer left the humor behind and took a dive into Treachery, Deceit, and Lying...  Just what I wanted to teach my kids!!!  NOT
They need to fire the writer of these 2 (connected) episodes or keep him on his meds.

However the episodes before these 2 bombs make the set worth getting for all Berk Dragon fans.",1401667200,,407,4.246753246753247
5734838,5,B00CQ8792G,"How to Train your dragon was hard to follow up, but Dream Works outdid themselves with this series. Packed with more dragons and more characters, these stories can be funny, epic, or touching, all at once. Some parts of  the series can be crude, with a few jokes and some less than funny moments, but nothing that is new for animation. The bad guys are well made and send chills down your spine, and Hiccup has you rooting for him the whole time as he tries to protect those he loves the most. A well done, suspenseful dvd that makes you hungry for more Dragons episodes coming out soon!",1399852800,,587,4.385321100917431

The package is very new, came out with plastic box and rap.
About the series are kind of less quality rander than movie but It is fine because I understand this is TV series so It is too much work to do to produce series come out very quick.
About animation always very good as the movie
the story is very fun and make me laugh all the time, toothless so cute.
I love the movie and can't hold myself to love this series too
I hope you will enjoy with it like me.",1399075200,,526,3.8796296296296298

5734842,5,B00CQ8792G,My child can not stop watching these shows.  The fact that there are good lessons being learned in a way that does not show violence and other bad things is a big plus for me.  Today it seems that even childrens show have too much crap in them.  At least there is a few shows out there that a responsible parent can approve of.,1397692800,,327,4.078125

The dragons are nothing like I collect but I was immediately sucked in by the different characters and the very different dragons. I'm 57 and my sister is 55 and we now own both movies and we watch the series on television. In fact, I bought her seasons 1 & 2 for her birthday and Christmas. The show has a lot of action and the humor is wonderful. How often these days do you watch a show and find yourself actually laughing out loud? We do with this series.",1391558400,,531,4.215686274509804

We enjoyed this DVD plus Part 1. It was a Christmas gift for my husband, who is a total fan of the movie.

This is actually the second half of the first year of the cartoon series, and the episodes are fun, creative and fantastic, but you HAVE to like dragons.  Even if you just barely like dragons, you will be enthralled with the series.  The heroes are viking teenagers, who fight evil from the backs of dragons, and their antics and exploits, as expected, are exciting, amusing, and the stuff of legend!",1391040000,,551,4.435643564356436

5734859,5,B00CQ8792G,"This is a fun series.  I loved ""How to Train Your Dragon"" and am pleased to see this series showing how the people of Berk adjust to life with dragons and adds more personality and background to all the main characters.  The animation and technical aspect is below that of the movie, but above ""Saturday Cartoon"" grade.  The follow-on series will likely be just as enjoyable and I presume all this will serve to lead up to the movie sequel, coming out in June 2014.",1388880000,8,465,4.447058823529412

This is clearly intended more for children.  That isn't to say it isn't  entertaining, just that it wasn't quite at the level I was hoping it would be.

For younger viewers, I think it would be a much better choice.",1387756800,,452,4.475609756097561

5734866,1,B00CQ8792G,"I would like to express my disappointment in Cartoon Networks/Dreamworks insatiable greed. I love certain programs like Adventure Time. However, I am outraged on how there are now, not one, but five random selections of episodes out on DVD. I will take time out of my day to make sure reviews on all websites that sell these partial seasons will clearly tell people how CN/DW is driven by greed and not to buy these mixed seasons and not to support partial season DVDs. You can put crap in a shiny box and call it a favor, but it is still crap. So many customers demand full seasons ONLY! You may fool the average consumer, but with a little education, my fellow peers will have their eyes opened to CN/DW's deceit of its customers and insatiable greed. What ever happened to producing quality products? What ever happened to companies that didn't try to gouge the customer and fool them into thinking they are getting a good deal? The DVD's cost you way less than a dollar to produce, but yet you want to try and fool the common customer to buy these mixed seasons of wonderful shows. Sadly, taking care of the customer and offering quality products appears to be a thing of the past.

Please don't hack up the dream works dragons of Burke when you put those seasons out on DVD. I will follow the releases and also educate the average customer on your business tactics and lack of general ethics. My voice will be heard, if not by CN/DW, but by the average consumer.

I don't normally complain, but I am sick and tired of large companies scamming and price gouging the loyal fans for the sake of a few extra bucks. America is no longer a producer of quality, now it seems we are a producer of deception and greed. You should be ASHAMED CARTOON NETWORK/DREAMWORKS!",1384992000,3,1764,4.5266457680250785
