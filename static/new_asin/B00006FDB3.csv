1745385,5,B00006FDB3,"I received Collection 3 on Thursday and can't wait for Collection 4 which is tentatively set for February 25 according to Shadowgram.  The quality of the dvd's is more than I expected.  As a long time Dark Shadows fan, I am looking forward to future releases.  MPI is doing an admirable job with their dvd release of Dark Shadows.  For anyone contemplating buying the series on dvd-GO AHEAD AND DO IT!  You will be happy you did.  I have all the episodes on vhs and the dvd's are worth it.  LONG LIVE DARK SHADOWS!",1036195200,12,514,4.404255319148936
1745386,4,B00006FDB3,"I finally recieved this DVD and so I will provide a quick technical review of the actual product.  The color episodes of Dark Shadows begin on this set (about 5 episodes in).  The color is of course not crystal clear as this was early live color video.  That being said, it looks better than i expected.  The colors do still bleed together a bit, but i do perceive an improvement over the quality of the broadcasts on Sci-fi channel.  All the rest of the aspects of this DVD set are consistent with previous releases.",1035936000,2,517,4.457446808510638
1745387,5,B00006FDB3,"I have Dark Shadows volume 1 & 2, went through a period of time for awhile when I was trying to tape them off the Sci-Fi Network but these dvds are the answer to a prayer - I canNOT wait for collection #3, and in all sincerity I am glad they are spacing them apart as they are - easier to afford each one as it's released, as I buy a LOT of dvds as it is!!
The amazing thing about ""DS"" is that it is so addictive; no matter your opinion on soap operas, or horror yarns, there is NOTHING like ""Dark Shadows"" to keep you enthralled and always waiting for the next chapter - I know some have complained that the quality of the dvds isn't prime, but to me the fact that each show looks as it did when it was on television adds to the sense of nostalgia and creepiness the show had for me as a child - but with the everlasting dvd quality!  I applaud MPI and their WISE decision to bring us the best of all soaps in dvd form!  My only ""negative"" is, I hope that, when done, MPI will go back and release the individual first 200 episodes, as well.
Oh, and to the person complaining that they're only putting on two months per set - Good Lord, we are talking 40 episodes each, about 14 HOURS per set!!  As someone with a busy schedule and tons of dvds and tapes, that's plenty for me between sets - and the only way to keep the cost per set even as low as it is!

Truly addicting, pure and simple. I just would like to point out that set #3 would contain the first color episodes....According to the Dark Shadows Almanac Millenium Edition, the first episode taped in color was #294, however it was aired in B&W. The first episode aired in color was #295, however the original tape no longer exists and they use a B&W kinescope for syndication. So episode #294 is now in color and episode #295 is in B&W despite it having a voice-over at the beginning announcing that Dark Shadows is now in color.",1031011200,9,684,4.569105691056911

1745447,5,B00006FDB3,Great movie !!,1425945600,,14,4.0
1745448,4,B00006FDB3,"Dark Shadows Collection 3 contains episodes 291-230, which were originally broadcast in the late summer and early fall of 1967. At this point the series had been on for a little over a year, it was during this time the show really became the Dark Shadows which has lived on in legend as the character of Barnabas Collins, 150-year-old vampire, becomes the narrative focus of the show.

The main storyline in these episodes centers on Dr. Julia Hoffman who, having apparently skipped ethics classes at medical school, attempts to cure Barnabas of his vampirism and, by doing so, unlock the secrets of mortality and maybe win herself a Nobel Prize in the process. As the episodes go on she finds herself increasingly complicit in Barnabass efforts to conceal his secret identity, including trying to silence Maggie Evans, former kidnapping victim of Barnabas, and coming into conflict with Willy Loomis, who still retains a spark of conscience despite being enslaved by Barnabas.  The culmination of this plot line provides the dramatic highpoint of these episodes. Other plot lines include Barnabass growing rivalry with Burke Devlin over the hand of Victoria Winters and Davids friendship with the spectral Sarah, which leads him closer to discovering Barnabas's secret.

While these episodes do not have the narrative fireworks of some other Dark Shadow story lines, such as the Phoenix storyline, or the more supernatural narrative arcs to come, overall they are effective as a long-form Gothic romance tale, with just enough scares and Hammer horror-style effects to let us know we are watching a TV show that wants to frighten us and keep us tuning in for tomorrows episode.

As with the other Dark Shadows DVDs released by MPL, this package includes an episode guide and modern day interviews with cast and crew members, all of whom look back on their Dark Shadows experiences with fondness. The sound and picture quality overall are good, especially considering the original broadcasts were nearly 50 years ago, during a time when taped TV shows were essentially considered disposable commodities. Also, it was during these episodes that the show began broadcasting in color.

Recommended for: Dark Shadows completists.",1423785600,,2225,5.169444444444444

1745474,5,B00006FDB3,The third installment of Dark Shadows proves to be among the best collections of this series. Jonathan Frid (who is surely missed by the fans) and Grayson Hall make this DVD a treasure and a must have for all DS fans. Their performances are first rate esp Frid's Barnabas. He is totally brutal and yet he can bring on the charm as well. His bouts with Burke played fairly by Anthony George is funny and worth watching. Grayson's Julia as the beloved doctor proves to be an asset to the show. She defends Barnabas at every turn and finds herself drawn to him intimately. There are lot of twists and turn here. I highly recommend this DVD to any DS fan,1390089600,,650,4.380165289256198

This show really comes to life when Barnabas appears (Dark Shadows Collections).  The Beginning Collections are good, but it doesn't really become addictive until the Barnabas episodes.

1745517,5,B00006FDB3,"Collection 3 is a better DVD than Collection 2, although I think their decision to add color was a mistake. Black and white was much more eerie. The color, however, does highlight how very beautiful the actress who plays Victoria Winters actually was--something the black and white episodes did not. It's also enjoyable to see the colors of the clothes.

Unfortunetly, I still cannot stand watching the actress who plays Dr. Julia Hoffman--who I'm half-expecting to see emerge from her dressing room as a cross-dressing man at any moment. Apparently, the writers also thought the actors should start lighting up cigarettes and smoking in every scene...something that Dr. Hoffman clearly didn't need any more of with a voice that already sounded like my Uncle Bill's.

This collection is answering some of the questions posed in the last. I'm happy to see the beautiful Maggie back, and less of the music box that would never shutup. (That annoyance has now been replaced with a flute version of ""London Bridge"".)

The love affair between Victoria and Burk is growing, although he is old enough to be her father--something that the new color episodes really accentuate. There are more set back drops--an old house that Burk wants to buy to name one--that are a refreshing break from the Collinswood ""study"" that we all spent so much time in during the first 2 collections.",1362009600,,1371,4.952173913043478
1745518,5,B00006FDB3,"There is nothing better than watching fine actors having to recover from ""live"" mistakes of those around them.  This is TV at its best!
As mentioned by others, this is the Dark Shadows set that takes us from black & white to color.  Having watched this series from the very first episode, I prefer this kind of genre in black & white, but the color takes nothing away from the interesting story lines.",1361750400,,401,4.47945205479452

It was well worth purchasing.  If you are a great fan and even if you're not, you'll become one!",1358640000,,274,3.8214285714285716
1745521,5,B00006FDB3,this show... this season introduced a character that set the mold for sinister characters.  must people from the late 60's to earlly 70's will recognise the face of barnabas collins and his silver wolf's head cane.  TIMELESS,1355875200,,224,5.027027027027027
1745522,5,B00006FDB3,"(And I might just do it in Living Color). This collection includes much more of the quirky and intense character, Dr. Julia Hoffman, played fabulously by Grayson Hall. With much snooping, she's been able to glean certain things about the Collins family as she searches for answers in her quest to discover why Maggie is such a tormented soul. Victoria, in the meantime, has become enamored with the past, especially with the long lost Josette whom Barnabus is equally mesmerized with, but somewhat reluctant to discuss. He is also greatly interested in the revealing things that Dr. Julian has found out about the Collins as she posed as an historian, while in reality is a psychologist to a patient who is of great importance to the vampire. Maggie gets some unexpected assistance.

I think the chemistry between Barnabus and Dr. Hoffman is great as they seem to act very well together. It seems to me they take less ganders at the monitor compared to many others in the cast. Each disc contains 10 episodes and interesting interviews from the cast. The little bloopers and flubs you'll have to catch for yourself which makes the show that much more interesting and lively.

In this collection also begins a colorized Dark Shadows so we can see the cool houses, sets, and all the funky clothes in color!! We get to see that Barnabus's cape is...well, it's black, of course, but everything else looks great in color too. That's a huge plus of this collection. All of a sudden while watching, the episodes turn from black and white to color, it's pretty incredible to see. Maggie is a ginger.

These collections have been greatly restored and remastered. With the restored clarity and details they are much more fun to watch compared to episodes on TV or Netflix. The actors who played in the original production make this DVD collection so endearing to many people who grew up watching Dark Shadows. People young and old can rewatch the series though the different collections of the entire set.

I've also by chance, seen collections 1-4 at Costco, so if you go to Costco, remember to check the DVDs-you might get lucky and pick some up there.",1338940800,11,2144,4.77088948787062

1745546,4,B00006FDB3,"This review might be a bit spoilerish for those who have never seen the series, so consider yourself warned.

This set of DVD's contains the episodes of Julia Hoffman's first interactions with vampire Barnabas Collins and her plans to *cure* him of his affliction. The ghost of Sarah Collins helps Maggie Evans escape her medical confinement and return to Collinwood - but will she regain the memory of her horrific ordeal at the hands of the evil Barnabas? Although the very best part for me is young David Collins' determination to solve the mystery of Cousin Barnabas with the aid of his new *friend* Sarah. His nightmares, as well as being trapped overnight in the hidden room of the old mausoleum are sufficiently creepy and I just loved it when he keept getting creeped out by the portrait of the *original* Barnabas. And boy, does the last episode in this one end up with a bang of a cliff-hanger. Have the next set handy.

My boxed set includes four DVD's with ten episodes on each one, plus an interview with former cast members at the end of each one. These were a real treat, especially the interview in this one with Louis Edmonds - he's got quite a lively tale to tell. These are a must for old fans of the show looking for a walk down memory lane (like me). If the investment in the entire series is a bit steep, don't forget to check your library catalog - mine has them all.",1293926400,,1390,4.468503937007874

1745549,4,B00006FDB3,"Barnabas Collins enters the bedroom of Dr. Julia Hoffman intent on killing her, only to find that Julia has anticipated him and, even more disturbing, knows his dark secret. Julia than makes Barnabas an offer: spare her life and she believes tht she can cure him. Julia also tells Barnabas that Maggie Evans is alive and safely hidden away; however, Maggie has escaped from Windcliff and found her way back to Collinsport. Unconvinced that Julia can prevent Maggie from remembering what happened to her, Barnabas determines to kill her but is stopped by the presence of his sister Sarah.

It soon becomes apparent that Barnabas has become infatuated with Victoria and is seeking to recreate Josette in her. Burke Devlin, who also has a romantic interest in Victoria, begins to grow suspicious of Barnabas and initiates an investigation of him. Learning he is being investigated, Barnabas cleverly informs Victoria knowing that she will force Burke to put an end to his inquires.

While searching for Sarah, David Collins becomes trapped in the secret room of the Collins mausoleum. While the family desperately searches for David, Sarah appears in the secret room and helps him escape. Terrified, David runs out into the night and straight into the arms of Barnabas who soon realizes that the boy is on the verge of discovering his secret. Barnabas decides that he has no choice but to kill David but is once again stopped by Sarah's presence.

In order to capture Maggie's kidnapper, Dr. Woodard proposes pretending that Maggie's memory is beginning to return. Barnabas still does not believe Julia's repeated assurance that Maggie's memory is gone and once again plans on killing her. Willie attempts to warn Maggie of the danger but is shot by one of the polieman guarding her.

In an effort to incriminate Willie, Barnabas hides Maggie's ring in a lamp in Willie's room which is than discovered by Sheriff Patterson. When Willie regains consciousness in the hospital it is discovered that his mind is completely gone and plans are made to transfer him to an asylum. David goes to the Old House despite Sarah's warnings not to and upon retuning to Collinwood is attacked by a giant bat.

Although Dark Shadows Collection 3 has many intriguing storylines and plot twists perhaps the single biggest treat is episode 295-the first installment of Dark Shadows in color. Originally broadcast on August 11, 1967 the show features Victoria as the first cast member in color(and looking lovelier in color than she ever did in black and white). Still, some fans may lament the transition feeling that the show was spookier or had more atmosphere in black and white and they are not entirely wrong in this assessment but the show phtographed well in color with rich, deep hues making for a quite effective result.

Colection 3 also has interviews with Jonathan Frid, Sharon Smyth(who played Sarah Collins), Louis Edmonds, and director Lela Swift",1269129600,3,2938,4.985714285714286

  Elizabeth thwarted her wedding to the blackmailing Jason McGuire and, in front of everyone, she revealed she killed her husband, Paul, 18 years ago and Jason is the accomplice.
 That night, the sheriff discovered the buried trunk in the basement floor to be empty. It contained no body.  Jason confessed that her husband, Paul, was indeed alive and left to Hong Kong. Jason was ordered by the sheriff to leave the Collinwood Estate and Collinsport forever.
  Maggie is now in the care of Dr. Hoffman, but everyone believes she is dead.  Barnabas has chosen Victoria Winters as his next prey to be his ""Josette"".
  The Collins family attended Barnabas' costume party dressed in their ancestors attire.
 Roger against Barnabas' wishes held a seance in The Old House.
  The child ghost, Sarah, continues to lurk inside and around The Old House and so has Dr. Julia Hoffman posing herself as a family historian at Collinwood. While poking her nose around Barnabas' house, Dr. Hoffman also discovered Barnabas asleep inside the coffin.
  Later, Barnabas pays a call to Dr. Hoffman at Collinwood and they ruffle each others feathers.  Barnabas has a distaste for Dr. Hoffman and is on to her game.  Barnabas agrees for Hoffman to visit him at his home...but only in the evening.
 Later that night, Barnabas appears in Hoffman's bedroom ready to strangle her in bed. However, Hoffman is actually sitting in the chair behind him and says, ""I have been waiting for you for a very long time"".

  And now the gothic story continues:

Forgetting the nostalgia aspect I found the stories to be strong, well paced and not self-indulgent compared to Collection 1.  The characters really come to life (or death!) and the writing has improved tremendously.  Even though some cameo roles seemed cariatures they were contemporaneous and allowed the main characters to shine.

The best aspect of this Collection is that the viewer gets drawn into the stories up to the razor's edge of each climactic ending and the development and continuation of other stories is cleverly delivered.

I only concern is that being British I found the Customs Duty very steep but that is only a warning for UK-based fans.

1745568,4,B00006FDB3,"DARK SHADOWS is probably the only daytime soap opera to have ever achieved the cult classic status of shows such as STAR TREK and THE PRISONER.  By this point in the story, the makers of DS knew 175-year-old vampire Barnabas Collins (played by Shakespearean actor Jonathan Frid) was too interesting and sympathetic a character to kill off as originally planned -- a villain people could relate to.  As director Lela Swift puts it in the bonus interview, Barnabas was treated as a human being with a problem.  Furthermore, DS's modern-day Van Helsing had become a woman.  A typo turned Dr. Hoffman from either Julian or Julius (1) into Julia.  This created new possibilities that both DS's makers and Dr. Hoffman's portrayer, Grayson Hall, wanted to explore.

Dr. Hoffman, has been called in to treat Maggie Evans, who Barnabas had tried to transform into a reincarnation of his lost love, Josette.  As this installment begins, Dr. Hoffman confronts Barnabas, proposing to try and cure his condition using medical science.  Although we later see signs of Dr. Hoffman's romantic interest in Barnabas, she appears at this point to regard him purely as a guinea pig ripe for blackmailing.  Maggie is an inmate at Dr. Hoffman's Windcliff sanitarium, and is suffering from ""temporary"" amnesia.  How temporary depends on Barnabas.  This tactic puts Barnabas in a double role as villain and victim.

It also makes me want to report Dr. Hoffman to the A.M.A.  She's preventing Maggie's recovery and forcing Barnabas into an experiment she knows may harm or destroy him.  IMHO,  ""first do no harm""  covers everyone, including vampires.  Furthermore, she's abusing her authority as a doctor and head of Windcliff.  The implication that authority can't be trusted strikes me as some 60s sentiment that got into DS despite the show's success in remaining immune to the turmoil of that period.

Actually, the blurring of the distinction between villain and victim, apparent in both Barnabas and Dr. Hoffman, anticipates the cynicism of much 70s cinema.

Maggie escapes Windcliff, assisted by Sarah, the mysterious little girl who  helped Maggie escape Barnabas.  During this installment, Sarah is identified as the ghost of Barnabas's little sister.  Sarah helps Maggie escape from Windcliff, then escorts her back to Collinsport --

And I find Maggie's trip home hard to swallow.  Granted, supernatural forces could transport Maggie 100 miles in the short time depicted, but I needed to see more detail -- Maggie and Sarah fading out at Windcliff and back in at the entrance to the Blue Whale, perhaps.  Having Maggie just show up at the Blue Whale seems too convenient and contrived -- as if they were more interested in saving work for the special effects guys than in plausibility.

But to be fair, this is where DS switches to color.  Maggie's arrival at The Blue Whale occurs at the end of the last b&w episode, #294, and is reprised at the beginning of the first color episode, #295.  There were probably enough technical problems involved in this transition that it would have been a bad time to mess with special effects.

Everyone is looking for Sarah, believing (correctly) that she knows who kidnapped Maggie.  Sarah spends the most time with young David Collins, even revealing the secret room in which Barnabas was first found.  Although Sarah won't appear to Barnabas, she gives him signs that she's around, and times them to thwart his attempts to kill Maggie and David.  We know a confrontation is coming at some point.

Unfortunately, Sharon Smyth's wooden performance as Sarah and anachronistic Philadelphia accent interfere with the mood.  The bonus interview with Smyth confirms she was from Philadelphia and reveals that, because she wasn't good at memorizing, she was parroting lines fed to her by her mother.

There are several developments that suggest Barnabas's demise was still under consideration,  First, although Barnabas remains mostly above suspicion, having passed himself off as a cousin from England, there are several important exceptions.  David has seen the secret room with the coffin in it, and has nightmares about Barnabas.  Burke Devlin actively investigates Barnabas and finds that things don't add up.  Dr. Woodard, who referred Maggie to Dr. Hoffman, decides Dr. Hoffman isn't on the level and takes Maggie out of her care.  Second, an new plot line is emerging, concerning Burke Devlin's engagement to Victoria Winters, and their attempts to buy an unused house on the Collins estate.

Additional points about specific episodes:

#291 features one of those flies that appeared from time to time.  This one lands right on Barnabas's face, which seems oddly appropriate, given that he's technically dead.

The bonus interview on Disc 1 features Jonathan Frid talking about one of the few times an episode was edited to cover a mistake.

In #304, when Willie tells Burke that ""Neither one of us ever did anything to you,"" he's apparently forgotten that he threatened Burke with a knife in pre-Barnabas episode #207.

When Sarah shows David the secret room in the mausoleum in #305, the plaque for Sarah Collins is right in front of his face.  One would think he would see it and make a connection.

#313 includes Roger's famous ""incestors"" blooper.  I've heard someone speculate that it may have been faked because he recovers so quickly.

#320 includes a more subtle technical blooper during David's nightmare.  When new background music starts, you hear a needle dropped onto a phonograph record, which was how the music was recorded in those days.

#330 is the last episode with announcer Bob Lloyd saying ""DARK SHADOWS is a Dan Curtis production,"" (2) and the first episode with the bat, created by puppeteer Bill Baird, and superimposed on the picture by means of chromakey.  It ain't exactly Industrial Light and Magic, but it's still effective, especially because of David Henesy's acting.

 (1) DARK SHADOWS COMPANION and DARK SHADOWS ALMANAC differ on this point.

(2) DARK SHADOWS ALMANAC claims his last appearance in #328, but I know what I heard.",1131580800,10,6090,5.0582329317269075
1745569,4,B00006FDB3,"This is another engaging ""Dark Shadows"" collection, with the added bonus of most of the episodes being in color.  There IS a certain amount of wheel spinning in these episodes, however.  To illustrate:

There are a handful of episodes where Burke Devlin gets a little too close to the truth about Barnabas Collins, leading Barnabas to announce, ""Burke Devlin must die!""

Then there are a handful of episodes where the amnesiac Maggie Evans starts remembering the truth about Barnabas Collins, leading Barnabas to announce, ""Maggie Evans must die!""

Then there are a handful of episodes where little cousin David gets too close to the truth about Barnabas Collins, leading Barnabas to announce, ""Cousin David must die!""

Barnabas also intones the dreaded ""... must die!"" line about Julia Hoffman, Willie Loomis, and, if I remember, one or two others during the course of these forty episodes.  So, yeah, there IS a certain amount of repetitiveness here.

In every case, of course, Barnabas is either talked out of killing the annoying supporting character in question (""But Barnabas, if you kill him there will be an investigation!""), or he figures out another way to throw said character off the scent.  It must be said that Barnabas' various solutions to these dilemmas are usually pretty interesting, which keeps this batch of episodes firmly in the ""worthwhile"" camp despite the repetitiveness of the plots this time out.

The color episodes start about five episodes into the set, and continue throughout, with an occasional black-and-white file episode rearing its head when an original color broadcast episode has been lost to the ages.  Somewhat annoyingly, those black-and-white file copies seem to show up just when something visually interesting occurs in an episode, like a surreal dream sequence or an ambitious special effect, things that would have been great to see in color.  Oh, well.

The writers must have also noticed that a certain sameness to the plots was creeping in at this point, because in the next batch of episodes- the ones conveniently packaged together in Dark Shadows Collection 4- some truly offbeat things start happening, including Barnabas actually making good on one of his threats to kill one of the series regulars, and a shift to the past so we can see firsthand the origin of Barnabas' curse.

But these ""Collection 3"" episodes are certainly worth watching, too.  Though I'm glad the series eventually moved into more ambitious areas, it's kind of fun this time out hearing Barnabas Collins repeatedly say that everybody and his sister ""... must die!""  Great stuff.",1126224000,35,2607,5.0988235294117645

Barnabas plots vengence on Burke who is suspious of Barnabas' absence in the daytime. Young David Collins, suspicious of cousin Barnabas, becomes locked in the family mausoleum in a secret room where Barnabas escaped his imprisonment in a coffin.

The ghost of Sarah Collins appears to David several times, and the rest of the family and friends try to search for her, for she knows about Maggie's disappearance.  Also in this Collection, episodes in color begin (about 5 episodes into the first disc) but every now and then an episode in black and white will occur.  As usual, we have 5-minute interviews at the end of each disc with a member of DS, including Jonathan Frid (Barnabas Collins), Sharon Smyth (Sarah Collins), Louis Edmonds (Roger Collins), and Lela Swift (director of the show).

1745573,5,B00006FDB3,"Dark Shadows was perhaps the most memorable daily soap opera of the era of the 60's. It influenced our culture and brought to teens and stay at home mothers countless afternoons of Gothic horror and romance. There was even a religious tract produced which warned of the dangers of watching this show due to the portrayal of the powers of darkness and use of magic and witchcraft. (These people obviously never saw the bloopers and mistakes that were so frequent on this show that it made you laugh, especially when they were trying to be serious!)This DVD set gets closer to the answers of what happened in the past that so influenced the future concerning the characters at Collinwood. Victoria Winters is still the center of attention and Maggie Evans shares the spotlight as the victim who can't remember her captor, who naturally was our familiar vampire, Barnabas Collins. I would like to note and call your attention to an actor who deserves recognition in this series for an excellent performance in a continuing role. Mr. Karlen, who played the helpless ""Willie"", Barnabas's slave/servant at the old house, should have received an Emmy award for his believable portrayal of a man heading toward and eventually having a nervous breakdown. I have never seen a better display than Karlan's characterization and he is a standout in this series (apparently others thought so too and he survived later in a role on ""Cagney and Lacey"" as a husband.) This is also where ""color"" became a regular for the show, although they still press a black and white show each week. It should be taken as ""entertainment"" rather than serious gothic horror and Dan Curtis helped give this show atmosphere by inspiring music that is drawn from his early ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" starring Jack Palance (still viewed as the best Jekyll and Hyde ever made!) and the cues before commericals as well as the errie opening melody are memorable and can now never be associated with anything other than ""Dark Shadows"". Goths will of course, love this series. After all, these characters were the epitamy of ""cool"" back then and they would certainly be ""in"" today,though I can't imagine Josette with Purple hair. Or Barnabas sporting tatoos or lip rings.",1050105600,6,2228,4.881266490765172

Where the quality of the films are lacking, the story-line more than makes up for it.  Highly recommended for anyone who likes gothic suspense/horror.
If you watched this show as a kid, watching it as an adult is both nostalgic and at frightening -- and remember this was produced more than 30 years ago.  Television's golden era?",1042416000,3,493,4.568181818181818
1745575,5,B00006FDB3,"Here we go! Now things start cookin'! The storylines keep getting more and more interesting and this collection surpasses the last two. Jonathan Frid, now comfortably settled in his role as Barnabas Collins, looks and acts even more menacing than before. In this collection, the color episodes begin after the first
few black & whites. There are many great graveyard scenes and the use of lighting is better, which casts an extra eerieness on Barnabas' face. The plotline surrounding young David Collins' suspicions of Barnabas begins here and you can't stop watching until you're through the whole box! Grayson Hall's hambone overacting as Dr. Julia Hoffman is amusing. She, and some of the other actors, get a mild look of panic on their faces when they forget a line and look off-camera for the cue card. Frid occasionally needs to look at a cue card, but he's so smooth about it and manages to stay in character when he does. The man never ceases to blow me away with his performances! Also look for two classic Dark Shadows bloopers: Willie hits his head coming out of the secret room in the mausoleum and a pesky fly keeps
landing on Barnabas' face. This collection features interviews with Frid, the stoic Louis Edmonds, director Lela Swift and Sharon Smyth, now 44, who played ghost-girl Sarah Collins.

7967564,5,B00006FDB3,"Dark Shadows: collection 3

At this stage of the series the characters seem to dwell in a kind of innocence. Theyre unsure of themselves. Everyone is hemmed in by hesitations, including Barnabas the vampire, who  is repeatedly dissuaded, by the efforts of  Willie and Dr. Julia Hoffman, from killing off his perceived rivals and those who might expose his true identity. Accepting that he is new to this modern world, his would-be hasty  excursions  of death  are thus replaced by  more  reflective options. There are exceptions though, as one or two characters are just too much for Barnabas to tolerate. This aura of innocence seems absent in the later episodes of the series, where everyone is emboldened to do their own thing. Too many cast members later on.
And its strange to say, that despite the constant intermingling of the characters, each one seems relegated to his or her own isolation.  Theyre trapped in separate personal dilemmas from which the  vast shadowy depths of the great mansion Collinwood offers no  relief.  Hence, there are many subplots at work. The cast repeatedly joins up, they converse with each other, drink brandy before the flames of the fireplace, then one by one they leave. Alone. Past the big grandfather clock and  through that ever-present front door. And nothing is ever really resolved; their problems just disperse into cobwebs after a time.
The  sound of wind and thunder from without works so wonderfully with all the  ongoing tensions within the house.

Stage Sets provide the perfect atmosphere. The settings are fittingthe dark, windy, foreboding atmosphere is everywhere. The fog enshrouded cemetery, which everyone seems to explore only at night, is notable, as is The Blue Whale,  a quaint  little  tavern where all the characters meet and  hobnob in varying combinations. More brandy.

Observations:
Almost everyone smokes cigarettes, including Dr. Hoffman.
Everyone keeps drinking the brandy, except Barnabas; he fakes it, holds the glass but never drinks.
Some episodes are in black and white, some are in color, then its back to black and white. For some reason I like this shuffling of old and new.
The candles throughout the Old House where Barnabas lives are blue. Their  bright color seemed ill fitted with the gloomy rooms of the houseat first, but after awhile they seemed most fitting.
The seasons are never alluded to, and yet the characters are always  attired for AutumnI like to think the storyline is forever trapped in the month of September, never summer, never winter. The weather is just right to  require the glow of  fireplaces on the New England coastline.
Roger Collins is funny because he is so serious.
Glimpses of artificial trees and blurry horizons when the front door is opened.

Each of the four discs ends with an interview of an original cast member or crew member. Very informative talks are given. The collection  comes with a fold out summary of each episode including the original airdate. Also a picture card is included with each set. Makes a nice bookmarker.
The last episode of collection 3, disc 4 ends with a cliffhanger. A bat flies through an open window. I had no choice but to order collection 4 to see
