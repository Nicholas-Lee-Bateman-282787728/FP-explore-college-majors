8682628,2,B00O8UI5SC,"What did I learn from watching this video? Very little. I have been waiting for a program that explained nutrition, taste, farming, production, food science, storage, processing, actual physical product(food) changes over the years, advances in technology, etc., etc.  This program did none of that. I expected any minute for the host to say something like ""Your mamma says this food is not good for you and you better do what your mamma says."" It doesn't explain what percentage of fat, sugar, protein, etc is normal for normal health. It doesn't mention specifically what additives are harmful and why they are harmful. It doesn't explain why GMO is supposed to the the new great evil..They just had the host frown and make a sour face, as if that would explain just how evil GMO is....yet it does mention over and over that big business and big corporations are going to get you...because they are greedy.... Probably the most obviously stupid thing about the program is that they put senseless fillers in that added nothing...other than a waste of time. I am referring to the fact that they had numerous people state their name...and spell it out...like it is part of a second grade class. I was a little surprised that they didn't run twenty more minutes of that....",1460160000,,1271,4.830275229357798
