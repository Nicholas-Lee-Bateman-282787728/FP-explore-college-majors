3557274,3,B001ER4CQQ,"Hallam Foe is a quirky movie exploring the emotional difficulties experienced by a teenage boy after the untimely and suspicious death of his mother. It examines loss and longing, guilt and helplessness, love and obsession. It's the way in which these themes are dealt with that puts the quirk into the movie and the reason why it's only partially successful. It's not always easy to accept the way the characters behave. There is simply too much improbable behaviour, particularly regarding the relationships between the troubled teen and the women he encounters. A little more realism would have added some necessary gravitas to a story that's meant to be weightier than it manages to be.",1230336000,3,690,5.06140350877193
3557275,4,B001ER4CQQ,"MISTER FOE (aka HALLAM FOE) is another dark film about buried pain and insecurities, much like director David Mackenzie's YOUNG ADAM.  Mackenzie is also responsible for the crackling screenplay adapted from the novel by Peter Jinks, the story of a young lad named Hallam (Jamie Bell) damaged by his mother's death/?suicide to the point where he separates himself from the world by living in a tree house, observing his father (Ciarn Hinds) in his  too rapid replacement of  Hallam's mother with the dangerous Verity (Claire Forlani).  A bizarre 17-year-old, Hallam attacks his fears and the world dressed in a manner of beast like costumes, all to assuage his grief for his mother's death.  When Verity's behavior drives Hallam from his elegant home, he retreats to Edinburgh, becoming a boy of the streets.  One day he spies a woman named Kate (Sophia Myles) who greatly resembles his dead mother and he begins stalking her, spying on her in every conceivable way until he convinces her to hire him in her hotel as a kitchen porter. Proximity feeds obsession and Hallam discovers that Kate is having an affair with a married hotel executive, the result of which is a clash with reality, and Hallam must confront his Oedipal desires with his coming to grips with the reality of his grief for this deceased mother.  The discovery he makes with Kate transfers to his relationship with his own family and opens doors for growth rather than maintaining his jail-like mental anguish.

The story is bizarre and very dark at times, but the performance by Jamie Bell, well accompanied by those of Hinds, Forlani, Myles et al, make this tale of coming of age fascinating.  The art direction (Caroline Grebbell), cinematography (Giles Nuttgens) and musical score (as concocted by Matt Biffa from performers such as Future Pilot A.K.A.) enhance the production - maintaining the high standards set by Mackenzie.  Hallam is a lad we grow to love despite his kooky behavior: few other actors could inhabit this role with the lan of the considerably talented Jamie Bell.  Recommended.

3557276,4,B001ER4CQQ,"There are certain films that would never have been made by a major Hollywood studio. If that's the case, how do I even know about them? How do I see them? I seek them out in independent theaters specializing in foreign and independently made films. Or I watch them on DVD, eagerly anticipating the chance to experience these films I have heard about. Frequently, these films tell stories that are odd, or unusual, in some way. Perhaps, they are small slices of life, delving into a few eccentric characters. Maybe they follow the sexual awakening, in more frank detail, of a central character. Maybe they are just plain off the wall. Frequently, these little films are real finds and contain some great performances in highly unique stories, stories too challenging for a major studio to produce and release. All of these definitions apply to ""Mister Foe"", the new Scottish film starring Jamie Bell (""Billy Elliott"", ""Jumper"").

A strange note. In Scotland, this film is called ""Hallam Foe"", after the main character's full name. In America, it is called ""Mister Foe"". I guess the American distribution company didn't think we would know what ""Hallam"" meant. But ""Mister""? Bell's character is less mentally developed than a teenager. ""Mister"" is not a good choice.

Hallam Foe (Bell) is a strange young man. He likes to hang out in his tree house and watch the comings and goings of the people on his father's (Ciaran Hinds) estate. But he is also disturbed by the theory he has surrounding his mom's death; he suspects his new step-mother, Verity (Claire Forlani, ""Meet Joe Black"", ""Basquiat"") of killing his mom so she can marry his father and inherit the huge estate. Verity was his father's former assistant and has now accepted a larger role in the company. Hallam's sister recognizes the signs and heads to Australia. But Hallam stays behind, determined to prove Verity is a murderer. One night, he tries to seduce her and this leads him to flee to Edinburgh where he gets a job in a large hotel. Hiding out in the clock tower, he starts to spy on Kate (Sophia Myles, ""Underworld"", ""Art School Confidential"", TV's ""Moonlight""), the HR director who hired him. She lives in a building across the way and he breaks out his trusty binoculars. Soon, they start to chat and Hallam becomes more involved in her life. But his father and step-mom make an inopportune appearance, trying to get him to return home.

Directed by David McKenzie (""Young Adam""), ""Mister Foe"" tells a unique, strange, interesting, more sexually frank story about a unique young man.

""Foe"" is as interesting as it is because of the performance of Jamie Bell. Bell initially made a splash as ""Billy Elliott"", but in the intervening years, he has appeared in a number of forgettable or ignored films. Now with ""Mister Foe"", he plays a strange young man with a lot of issues, insecurities and development problems. Bell's performance is close to mesmerizing. The actor seems to get so completely lost in all of the different aspects of the character, making him believable, rich and alive.

Hallam waits in his tree house, dressed in animal skins and war paint, lying in wait for a friend of his. Soon, a young lady and her boyfriend walk by and fall to the ground and start making love, groping each other's bodies. Hallam clearly knows one of both of these people and grabs his zip line. Shouting, he quickly lands in the middle of the couple, startling both. They rush off, hurling threats at him.

The amazing thing about this performance is that even though Hallam is seventeen or eighteen, he has the maturity of a nine or ten year old. And Bell makes us understand this and believe it through his portrayal.

After the falling out with his father and step-mom, he runs off to Edinburgh and gets a job washing dishes in the kitchen of a large hotel. He finds a little nook behind a large clock and makes his home there. The unique vantage point allows him to continue his favorite past time, to watch people. He soon realizes Kate (Sophia Myles), the HR person who hired him, lives across the street in a small apartment. And he also realizes that Alasdair (Jamie Sives), the head porter, is having an extra marital affair with Kate. He begins to watch them.

Soon, Kate becomes attracted to Hallam and their relationship takes some interesting, frank turns.

Bell's performance is what makes ""Mister Foe"" so interesting. Bell seems to take in all of Foe's problems and exhibit them for us as though they are his own. Because the performance is so open and revealing, we get a real feel for the character and what he is feeling and going through. I doubt it will happen, but Bell should be remembered when the Oscars roll around next February.

Sophia Myles is also good as Kate. A single woman, she takes her job very seriously and maintains a very good business demeanor. After she and Hallam begin seeing each other, their relationship seems very natural, goes through some believable ups and downs, based on what we know of their characters. It is almost a bit refreshing to see a female act in the way Kate acts. She is a modern woman and knows what she wants and likes. If she isn't getting that, she moves on. Doesn't want to waste a lot of time.

""Mister Foe"" is populated with many other characters. Verity, played by Claire Forlani, is particularly mysterious and complex. But the film is about Hallam; he is the center of this universe and his character is so strong, everything else seems like an after thought.

""Mister Foe"" is strange, unusual and worth your time.",1223424000,5,5555,4.7272727272727275
3557277,4,B001ER4CQQ,"Not sure why the title was changed. Hallam is the name of the main character. Mister Foe doesn't make the title any more clear or, for that matter, any more interesting for the unknowing to want to view. The film is, however, very engaging and quirky. Jamie Bell is an under rated and remarkable talent in film today. He can always be trusted to give an unusual and startling performance. This is certainly no exception. It is not a great film but entertaining with quite a few bright moments. Claire Forlani is lovely to hate and Sophia Myles is very charming to watch. It is all about Bell though. He is destined for great things. From Billy Elliot to now his character choices and studies have been remarkable and he is to be applauded for not becoming ""mainstream"" in his thinking. Continue to expect greatness from him.",1221955200,10,824,4.612244897959184
3557278,4,B001ER4CQQ,I knew a few actors from other movies I've enjoyed. I really liked this movie! Everyone did a great job and the soundtrack rocked :),1367625600,,132,4.32
3557279,1,B001ER4CQQ,"Maybe I just wasn't intelligent enough to get this movie, but to me, Mister Foe was just weird and twisted. Jamie Bell (who I'll always associate with Billy Elliott) was phenomenal as Hallam Foe, a seventeen year old voyeur, whose mother had recently committed suicide. Unable to cope, Hallam leaves for the big city, where he finds a woman who looks eerily similar to his mother and Hallam starts spying on her. I get that this film was supposed to be coming of age, sophisticated, and meaningful, but honestly, I just found it creepy. The film was choppy, extremely slow, and just when you thought something was going to happen, it doesn't. In Mister Foe, Jamie Bell really does show just how good an actor he has become. Aside from that, this movie is just weird.",1361491200,,766,4.639705882352941

3557281,4,B001ER4CQQ,I am a big fan of Jamie Bell and I was not disappointed with his performance. He covers a major spectrum of emotions in this movie and the end is left up to you. I like this in most movies where they let the viewer decide the out come. No ribbon on the end of this movie but am glad now that it is part of my collection.,1317859200,,320,3.7205882352941178
3557282,5,B001ER4CQQ,Can't really say anything that hasn't been said. Amazing performance by Jamie Bell & The whole cast. A new favorite!,1306713600,,116,4.85
3557283,5,B001ER4CQQ,"I watch a LOT of movies, and as a huge fan of Jamie Bell I was really surprised that I had somehow missed this dark little film, which chronicles a young man's journey from awkward insecurity and longing to eventually letting go and moving on.

The film follows 18-year-old Hallam Foe (Jamie Bell) who has recently lost his mother to an apparent suicide. Completely obsessed with his mother, he even sleeps with a large picture of her over his bed. Hallam suspects that his stepmother (Claire Forlani) murdered his mother in order to get to his father (Ciaran Hinds) and his father's money. Spending most of his days in a treehouse built by his father, Hallam watches the world around him through a pair of binoculars as he becomes more and more socially awkward, choosing to wear a badger's skin on his head and covering himself with paint. After a wild, lustful mistake, Hallam is blackmailed into moving to Edinburgh, where he finds a job as a porter in a hotel whose HR manager (Sophia Myles) looks strikingly like his mother. Hallam begins to watch this look-alike from his clock-tower home, and thus ensues a dramatic and dark comedy, with plenty of sex and self-discovery along the way.

Early on the film, you kind of get this sense that Hallam's... um, quirks, if you will... come not from perversion, but rather from a deeper place, one created by the trauma of losing his mother. As weird as you might consider his obsession over his mother, you feel for the kid. You realize that if you were in a situation where you experienced some sort of heart-wrenching loss, you'd hope that there would be someone out there willing to stand by you despite your oddities. He's a voyeur, but not in the typical sense of the word: he watches people not out of sexual perversion (even though he does chance upon the occasional tryst) but I feel, out of his lack of understanding for how other people perceive each other, how they interact, and how their actions towards each other really define them. Hallam is a sympathetic, if not typical, character, and he definitely inspires a willingness to understand rather than condemn.

Accompanied by a great soundtrack (which I also purchased) and several outstanding performances from supporting actors, ""Hallam Foe"" is a darkly original story which somehow finds innocence in ostracism. I believe it's not so much a coming-of-age tale as it is a story of placing aside those things which ground you and moving on. An excellent film, one of Jamie Bell's finest performances, and definitely one of my favorite films!",1299110400,3,2558,4.795918367346939
3557284,4,B001ER4CQQ,"Loved the movie.  I've liked Jaime Bell from Billy Elliott onward.  Love Sophia Myles.  Ultra sexy.  Loved her on Moonlight.  The psychological makeup of Hallam Foe was a bit shaky, albeit understandable for the most part.  Still, I've been young and in love (or lust) and Hallam was probably no more crazy than a whole lot of teenagers.  You have to pay attention to this movie to understand where it's coming from and going to.  But it's a pleasurable viewing experience.  Watch it when you've a lot of time on your hands.  Do it in a hurry and you're going to miss some salient points.  It's got one helluva graphic episode in it, so you might want to review it before exposing a youngster to it.  Even with said graphic episode, it's a worthwhile viewing experience.  I kind of wish the particular product I rec'd hadn't been anchored to the Spanish language for subtitles.  I couldn't turn it to English.  I'd like to have known that before I got the item.  This is my nth buying experience from Amazon.  I rarely buy brand new products, but every single ""like new"" has proved to be in excellent condition and I've many movies that have lasted me for many viewings.  Some I've resold - at garage sales - and even recovered some $.  How can you beat that for a buying experience? Most recent DVD buys include SALT, RED, and UNSTOPPABLE (on the way now) with TRUE GRIT on my Wish List.  These, and others not listed here, have earned at least 4 and 1/2 stars by my rating system which only covers product condition and delivery speed - or lack of both.",1298246400,,1555,4.4661921708185055
3557285,5,B001ER4CQQ,"Very rarely do I find a movie that intrigues me as much as this one.  There is a fine cast, wonderful symbolism, beautiful scenery and stark colours.  Watching him climb all over the rooftops was very enjoyable. The story has been told before but never with such quirkiness and sweetness.  This movie made me laugh too. Hallam reminded me of my own 20 year old son that is constantly going through 'things'.

This is a must have for any fans of Jamie Bell, and in my opinion,  this is by far the best work he has done.  I would love to see Sophie Myers and Jamie Bell do another movie together.  Their sexual chemistry was great!!

For those that like quirky movies or 'different' movies this one is for you. It is currently my favorite movie.  The music is fantastic and not run of the mill either.

This is a very unique movie and reminds me of why Jamie Bell is the only actor that I will plunk money down in anything he does.  It has been a great ride since Billy Elliot and I am certainly enjoying the ride.  He carried the movie as he often does.",1238025600,3,1052,4.257575757575758
3557286,3,B001ER4CQQ,"I really enjoyed the book Hallam Foe and couldn't wait to see the film. However, now that I have I do not have that fulfillment I was expecting. The story stays fairly true to the source material, but it greatly lacks the emotion of the book. Most notably, the motivations of Hallam are unconvincing, even unclear in the film. Hallam has strange, disgusting habits, and the lack of realism and relatability ruins any chance that the viewer will sympathize with such a character. Instead of odd and endearing, he is just odd.
Another aspect that I was disappointed with was the score of the film. I like the music and the bands on their own, and as a standalone album it works fine. However, the songs seemed too forced, too frequent, and too prominently placed in the film. Instead of complementing the story, they overpowered it.
Overall, if the plot sounds interesting to you, I highly suggest reading the book, and not to expect as much from the film.",1235001600,3,954,4.650887573964497
3557287,5,B001ER4CQQ,"""Mister Foe"" is a delightful surprise!  Perhaps oddball coming-of-age movies strike a chord with me.  My all-time favorite is probably&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harold-and-Maude/dp/6305882592/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harold and Maude</a>&nbsp;about a young man who, like Hallam Foe, has unusual behavior.  Jamie Bell, who was excellent in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jumper/dp/B00177Y9ZC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jumper</a>&nbsp;and came to our attention with ""Billy Elliott"" in 2000, plays a young man who is a peeping tom in an apparent reaction to the loss of his mother.  The intensity and range he expresses glued my eyes to the film.  Claire Forlani who captured my heart in ""Meet Joe Black"" and was recently in ""In the Name of the King"" plays the heavy in the film, the domineering step-mother.  She does a great job with her subtle performance.  The moment early on in the film where Hallam refers to her as a lady of the evening is followed by a pregnant pause at his faux pas, followed by her rollicking laughter.  It's a great moment.  Hallam sees Kate in Edinburgh who resembles his mother and follows her, securing a job where she works.  Kate is played by the lovely Sophia Myles who was on TV's ""Moonlight"" and also played in the film ""Tristan & Isolde.""  Myles comments on the appealing nature of Bell's posterior in a witty aside in the DVD featurette.  Kate sports a businesslike air on the job, but lets loose in her private life.  Hallam spies on her as she makes love to her married lover Alasdair played by Jamie Sives.  The moment when Sives looks up and makes eye contact with Hallam and seems to enjoy being watched as he makes love is so wrong in so many ways and yet works marvelously in the context of the film.  Ciaran Hinds who was great in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stop-Loss/dp/B0013FSL1Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stop-Loss</a>&nbsp;and also was in ""There Will Be Blood"" plays Hallam's father Julius.  The touching father-son moment is well played and creates emotional depth.  Ewen Bremner who was in ""Fool's Gold"" has a delightful deleted scene and a sparkling cameo as Andy the bellhop.  Maurice Roeves also has a great cameo as the grizzly old dishwasher.  ""Mister Foe"" may be a naughty pleasure, but it is a delightful film, sparkling with energy and originality.
