8237368,5,B0010779Q0,So happy to have this DVD! Video quality varies from fair to excellent. Audio quality is excellent. All around a great DVD considering the shows are over 50 years old.,1359504000,,167,4.6
8237369,1,B0010779Q0,"I'd give this no stars if possible. It won't play in any DVD player I own. The few frames I WAS able to see were washed out and horrible looking, so maybe I didn't miss much.

The reviewer who rated this 5 stars must be a retailer of this title - a shill in other words.",1200614400,10,270,3.8214285714285716
8237370,5,B0010779Q0,"This DVD includes 6 full length game shows: Twenty-One, Tic Tac Dough, What's My Line, To Tell The Truth, I've Got A Secret, and Queen For A Day. After watching the over 185 minute DVD, it was quite satisfying to look back at those old game shows.",1196985600,19,247,4.276595744680851
