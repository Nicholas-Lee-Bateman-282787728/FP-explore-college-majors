I'm glad they refunded me, but it angers me that they did not take action before I contacted them. They didn't go ahead and tell me ""Oh hey, we don't have that one! Sorry."" It was more of a ""Maybe he won't notice and then we can keep his money!""

Prompt service after I contacted them, but the fact they didn't do it first makes me trust these guys less. Be careful when buying from them.",1376524800,,660,4.069230769230769

4699149,4,B005HE4AIW,"The first season of ""Bleach"" ended with Ichigo, Uryu, Chad, Orihime and the cat Yoruichi leaving the living world for the Soul Society, intent on saving Rukia.

But getting there isn't the least of their problems. The second major arc of the ""Bleach"" series -- called ""The Entry"" -- continues our heroes' quest to rescue Rukia from a death sentence, but they run into a new set of obstacles. It's pretty divided between action, slapstick and exposition, as well as a series of mysteries and conspiracies -- and a lot of likable new characters.

Ichigo and Co. narrowly make it into the Soul Society, almost losing Uryu along the way. And unfortunately -- between lethal captains and a building-sized Gatekeeper -- it's almost impossible to get inside the Soul Reapers' fortress, the Seireitei. Their only way inside is to ask an eccentric friend of Yoruichi's, a fireworks expert called Kukaku Shiba, to blast them (and her rough-edged brother Ganju) inside the Seireitei from the sky.

But surprisingly, being shot into orbit with a giant cannon isn't the worst thing that happens. The little group gets split apart -- and Ichigo finds himself facing an increasingly strong series of opponents, including the enraged Renji Abarai and the battle-hungry Captain Zaraki. Facing defeat and death, Ichigo is forced to call upon an ally he never knew he had -- and face a horrible inner enemy.

When a murder is committed in the Seireitei, the Soul Reapers are thrown into chaos, as they automatically blame the ""ryoka"" intruders for the death of one of their own. Orihime, Chad and Uryu are trying to fight their way in, but it's Ganju and the timid Soul Reaper medic Hanataro who make it to Rukia's cell -- only to reveal a horrifying secret from her past.

If the first season of ""Bleach"" was all about introducing the main characters and the concept of Soul Reapers, then the second season is all about Ichigo and Co. causing as much mayhem as possible in the Soul Society. Well, the Soul Society is not as pleasant and peaceful as Rukia led us to believe -- in fact, it has even more weirdos than Ichigo's hometown.

And while the storytelling is well-balanced, the second season is much more violent -- there's floods of blood, massive near-fatal injuries, and Byakuya Kuchiki's ability to shred opponents from a distance with tiny ""cherry blossom"" pieces of metal. And the storyline takes an unexpected twist halfway through, when a character is apparently murdered and the lieutenants start turning against each other. And since there are hints of a conspiracy involving Rukia, it's pretty obvious that something is rotten in the state of the Soul Society. Just what it is remains to be seen, but it promises to cause even more chaos in the Seireitei.

But not all is doom and blood in the second ""Bleach"" season -- it's still liberally peppered with funny dialogue (""That's a pretty cute name for someone who takes himself so seriously."" ""MY NAME IS NOT CUTE!"") and physical goofery (Yoruichi's true form is revealed to Ichigo). Though our heroes spend a lot of time running around causing mayhem, they also create a lot of humor as well -- such as when Ichigo screams for Ganju, only to realize that he just alerted several off-duty Soul Reapers to his location.

Ichigo has to learn a bunch of new skills in this season, including getting closer to his inner, um, sword. Uryu's chivalrous side gets a workout when Orihime is threatened. And Chad's history is finally revealed in full, such as how this gentle giant became determined never to fight for his own sake, and how he became fast friends with Ichigo.

There are a couple of new characters too: we get to see Renji's miserable youth with Rukia, and why he's hellbent on defeating Ichigo. And our heroes team up with an adorably timid Soul Reaper medic named Hanataro, who serves as tour guide/comic relief for much of the season (""See how full of life and energy and vitality I am?"") as well as the boar-riding Ganju.

While most of the Soul Reapers aren't fleshed out, they are given enough quirks and personality to seem very realistic -- narcissists, child prodigies, bookworms, battle-o-philes, bombshells and little creepy girls with pink hair. Two particular standouts are a laid-back, sake-chugging captain named Shunsui Kyoraku, and Rukia's captain, a sickly hunk named Ukitake.

The second ""Bleach"" season takes our heroes straight into the heart of the Soul Society, and a lot of new trouble as well. Definitely worth checking out -- but expect one heckuva cliffhanger.",1363737600,3,4543,4.864165588615783

4699183,3,B005HE4AIW,"Rukia has returned to the Soul Society under arrest for giving her powers to a human, and she is to be executed in 30 days. Ichigo along with some of his friends, storm into the world of the Soul Society and break into their base called the Seireitei. They face impossible odds in the form of the 13 Soul Reaper Squads.

Ichigo realizes he's barely on the strength level of some of the lower level Soul Reapers. Later, he engages in a rematch against a Soul Reaper Lieutenant named Renji, whom reveals Soul Reapers lose some of their strength when they leave their world. Therefore, making his survival of their previous encounter nothing more than luck, and to make matters worse, the Captains of the squads are far more powerful and skillful than any of their subordinates.-summary

This is when Bleach begins to take the plunge and follows the path of almost every shonen series of its genre. Where the first chapter utilized creative storytelling and wasn't too predictable. This chapter begins to follow an all too familiar and very disturbing pattern. Relying on long drawn out fights, flashbacks you have JUST SEEN, and lots of filler. In the very beginning, I found all of the fights to be very boring. They consist of the usual formula: main character reaches a new level of power, and then takes almost an entire episode displaying his new strength in one on one battle. Plus, bad guys run their incredibly arrogant mouths for an insane amount of time. It's as if Dragon Ball Z never even existed.

The plot is almost paper thin, with the characters running into plot related elements before a long fight begins. It almost feels like a video game. Ichigo goes through one character after the next, with the next being far stronger than the last. What helps save this chapter is the subplot concerning a conspiracy that later occurs, when a murder of a top official takes place. Some of the battles are kind of worth the wait though. The stand out encounter is without a doubt the battle with Ichigo and a very powerful captain named Kenpachi. He's the only real reason why I enjoy this arc.

The comedy that was done so well, plus well placed in the first arc is mostly miss this time around. I feel it occurrs at the wrong times and ruins some pretty good tense moments. It really does clash with the seriousness of the episodes, and the writing is ridiculous when trying to carry the plot. Speaking of the writing, it causes the pacing to suffer bad. Many battles are interrupted with flashbacks and dreams with the only purpose to prolong the battles, which continue through multiple episodes. This formula would be just fine if it hadn't been done to death long before this point.

The soundtrack is still just as strong with a new opening, and new theme songs for both the opening and ending. The opening theme song called D-Techno Life performed by Uver World is every bit as catchy as the previous opening to me. The animation is very good, and is at its best during the better fight scenes. The sword clashes can be pretty intense, and they're a lot bloodier this time around. I really enjoy the artwork. The character designs vary amongst the most notable Soul Reapers such as the Captains and Lt's. There were very few short cuts taken here with each bearing their own distinct look.

Once again, I have no complaints with the voice work and I still prefer the English cast. A couple of interactions are just too funny. The fan service is still very tame which I'm not complaining about. I'll also mention again that the violence is a step up in this arc, but nothing too graphic.

Bleach: The Entry does begin to come around during the half way point and ends on a cliffhanger, which almost makes an immediate purchase of the third arc mandatory; that is, if you bought into the characters and story by this point. Many anime fans seem to love this series. I think it's decent and nothing more, but if you made it this far and are hooked. Then it makes very little sense to stop since the third arc improves on the fight scenes, plus it introduces a few more elements to push the plot. This season is 525 minutes and contains episodes 21-41.

Pros: New opening song, a couple of nice battles, sub plot, one cool character

Cons: Very bad pacing, long and dragged out annoying sequences, more bland characters",1428105600,,4329,4.611688311688312

4699194,5,B005HE4AIW,"The second season of Bleach, known as ""The Entry"" is 21 episodes this time and continues directly after the end of season 1.. Spoiler warning"" i'm going to ruin the plot of season 1 so if you  haven't seen season 1 entirely, then go watch it all first then come back.. did that? ok good, lets continue...

Season 2 has the spikey headed hero aka Ichigo, the human brick wall Chad, the cantaloupe smuggling airhead Orihime, the way too uptight for his own good Uryu and a talking black cat named Yoruichi traveling into the Soul Society to rescue Rukia Kuchiki, who's set to be executed, supposedly, for just giving Ichigo her powers. Rukia was captured by Byakuya Kuchiki and Renji Abarai after nearly killing Ichigo in a battle in the world of the living. Urahara helped Ichigo gain his own Soul Reaper powers after losing Rukia's when he was defeated by Byakuya. He and his friends are determined to save Rukia and end up in a conspiracy that effects both the Soul Society and the world of the living.

Season 2 ( along with Season 3) are among the best seasons early on due to the amount of incredible one on one battles that Ichigo and the others get involved with. Season 1 might not have seemed lacking, but compared to season 2, it definitely was. Beyond trying to rescue Rukia and battle against the members of the Soul Society, the season is also about Ichigo's powers as a Soul Reaper growing rapidly as he learns a lot from from winning fights as well as by other means, I won't spoil.

They story does have a lot going on and you learn a lot about the Soul Soceity and Soul Reapers during season 2(as well as season 3).. but you need to pay attention, as some of it is quite complicated at times.

Now then..

The animation improves a bit over the course of the season compared to season 1, though it's still not perfect compared to later seasons.

The voice acting is improved as well especially by season's end.

 The two opening songs are a mixed bag. .the first 5 episodes reuse the same opening from season 1 which is kind of disappointing (not that that song is by any means bad) but the second opening used for the remaining episodes is quite catchy.

overall not much is different in terms of positive and negatives things about season 2 that weren't in season 1..

+Slightly better animation
+Slightly better character models
+A good story arc
+Improved voice acting as the actor/actresses become use to their characters
+you learn lots of useful and interesting info on the Soul Society and Soul Reapers
+Kukaku is an awesome character but..

- Kukaku's not used or shown enough in season 1 ( or the series in general)
-Orihime is still annoying at times
-the cliche of being beaten in a battle and then quickly finding a way to find hidden power to beat your opponent is used too much

Despite a few minor issues, Season 2 is definitely better then season 1 was and I can't recommend it enough.. so but it.. or i'll send Kukaku after you and trust, me you don't wanna make her mad.. just ask Ichigo..",1416700800,,3023,4.494525547445256

And if you like the story line started in Uncut Box Set #1, you will need the Uncut Box sets 1 through 4 (Uncut Box Set #4 is actually 2 Box Sets - set 1 and 2 - not sure why they did this other than milking the fans of extra cash)The 1st 4 Uncut Box sets will get you through Episode #63.
