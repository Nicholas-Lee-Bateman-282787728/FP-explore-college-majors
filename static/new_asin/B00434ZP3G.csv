4253623,3,B00434ZP3G,"The movie was very cool with lots of planes and jets but there was just music....no words.  Still, my seven yr old loved it!",1312156800,6,124,4.166666666666667
4253624,5,B00434ZP3G,"I watched this dvd with my parents, and I have got to say the the story line for this movie is INCREDIBLE. It was a perfect mixture of romance and action. I thought the two main characters- Boeing 737-200 and the beautiful MD-80- made perfect chemistry with each other. With their adventures and friends, I cried and laughed. This was such a touching story. I teared up.",1310947200,8,370,4.537313432835821
4253625,4,B00434ZP3G,My 3 year old grandson loves this DVD.  It holds his attention with fast changing pictures of military and civilian aircraft and some spacecraft. My only criticism is that there is no narration explaining the type or use of the aircraft being viewed.,1310256000,9,250,4.813953488372093
4253626,5,B00434ZP3G,"I just had to get this dvd when I first saw the commercial watching [adult swim].  I don't have the energy to use my keyboard and mouse on my computer to see these clips, I can just pop the dvd into the player, sit back, and enjoy!",1294012800,14,231,3.9148936170212765
4253627,4,B00434ZP3G,"Great quality in shipping, video, and playback! Fun video. Thanks again for the speedy and quality delivery!",1408406400,,108,5.411764705882353
4253628,5,B00434ZP3G,"My 4 year old LOVES, LOVES, LOVES this. He loves to sit and watch the planes zoom by on the screen.",1396137600,,99,3.761904761904762
4253629,5,B00434ZP3G,My 3 yr old grandson loves this video. It has music instead of talking which lets us make up stories about the planes and the people involved.,1355356800,,142,4.296296296296297
4253630,4,B00434ZP3G,"I bought this DVD for my 3 year old nephew and he LOVED it. It gets old pretty quickly with older children, but the younger ones really seemed into it.",1355270400,,151,4.066666666666666
4253631,3,B00434ZP3G,"My 5 and 3 yr old boys were begging me to get this for ages. We did and while the footage is great, there is no talking, so it's not very engaging for children. They don't necessarily even need very kid specific talking, but some explanation of what footage is being shown would add interest.",1347494400,,292,4.327272727272727
4253632,4,B00434ZP3G,my son loves planes and really loves the planes on this video.  this was a great dvd for the price.  it keeps him engaged and that's good for me.,1346025600,,145,3.9655172413793105
4253633,4,B00434ZP3G,This video is entertaining but only eye candy because there is no sounds.  My son has not wanted to rewatch it since he first got it about a month ago.  We'll see if it has staying power.,1338768000,2,187,4.027027027027027
4253634,5,B00434ZP3G,"Awesome! I will always love jets and planes from a pliot. A Great Dvd Air Show. From Military Jets to Civilian Airliners.

-Firefly",1330819200,,131,4.695652173913044
4253635,2,B00434ZP3G,My son has only watched it once.  He was expecting to have narration explaining the type of planes and there functions.  The camera work was fine but it was a let down otherwise.,1328745600,,178,4.363636363636363
4253636,5,B00434ZP3G,"I got this for my five year old for Christmas, so we haven't actually watched it yet, HOWEVER, we already have the Lots & Lots of Trains Vol I & II and WE LOVE THEM!  Well my son does.  He watches the documentary-set-to-music-style movie over and over and over, and has begged for the Jets and Planes one. I have no doubt it will be as great as the Trains!  They are low budget, and are nothing special, not commercialized, not like watching Discovery Channel or something, but somehow that makes them more interesting. They are more like home made documentaries and honestly I think that is what my son likes about it, makes it seem much more realistic and like they are actually talking to him and he is actually there.  Good value for what you get and great for any kid who is an airplane enthusiast.",1323648000,4,803,4.405405405405405

8414129,5,B00434ZP3G,Love it!,1449705600,,8,3.5
8414130,3,B00434ZP3G,"It wasn't what I expected, I suppose I except there to be some sort of dialog to follow but it was really just clips with loud music being played throughout. I actually bought this for an adult because I thought it would be more informative so we got a good laugh when we figured out what it actually was, a flashy clip video for toddlers, haha.",1437177600,,345,4.242424242424242

8414133,3,B00434ZP3G,"We have lots and lots of trains so thought this lots and lots of jets and planes would be awesome. But for some reason it is boring. there are stunt planes and shots of planes flying, but the music is lacking and it just isn't a souped up jet video. Kind of disappointed.",1426723200,,271,4.132075471698113
8414134,4,B00434ZP3G,"Lots of colorful scenes, but some of the dialogue is not interesting to kids.",1414540800,,77,4.571428571428571
8414135,5,B00434ZP3G,My 2-yo identical twin grandsons loved to watch this DVD repeatedly. Some reviewers complain about the lack of talking and explanation. I tend to disagree because some of the kids' DVDs are too instructional for 2-yo's. The sights and sounds of the actions are perfect on JETS AND PLANES.,1411344000,,288,4.8979591836734695
