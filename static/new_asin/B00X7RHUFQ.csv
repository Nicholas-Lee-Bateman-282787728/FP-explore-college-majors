8715322,5,B00X7RHUFQ,"The Third Man, 1949 film

The film begins showing post war Vienna which is divided into four sectors. Holly Martins arrives, he was promised a job (he walks under ladders). Harry Lime isn't there to meet him, he is being buried today. Martins arrives at the graveyard. A stranger offers him a ride and a drink, then pumps him for information. Martins writes cheap novelettes, the westerns that were popular then. Crabbins offers Martins a job to lecture on the contemporary novel; he will be paid. Then Baron Kurtz calls for a meeting; he was a friend of Harry Lime. Martins visits Harrys girlfriend Anna Schmidt, who acts in a classic comedy. She accepts the loss of Harry, and tries to move on with her life. Martins learns more details about Limes death: his driver, his friends, and his doctor were all there. [Was it really an accident?]

Martins and Miss Schmidt return to Limes apartment. The porter tells about Lime: he was quite dead, killed at once. There was a third man present at the death scene! The porter doesnt want to get involved with the police. Next they learn the police are investigating Miss Schmidt, and she is brought in for questioning about her identity papers. Martins visits Dr. Winkel, Limes medical advisor. Miss Schmidt was used to send a message to Joseph Harbin, who went missing the day Lime died. Martins visits the Casanova Club where Harrys friends hung out. Mr. Popescu tells how the death happened. Martins asks about the third man, and tells what the porter saw. Popescu says he doesnt know much more. The porter asks Martins to return that night, but after he closes the window he is startled as if he saw a ghost. Martins tells Anna about Harry, how he could fix things and knew how to fiddle the rules. When they go to visit the porter they find he was murdered. Did he know too much?

Holly Martins speaks to the literary club. He seems to be over his head among the literary crowd. Two hard looking men pursue him, but he flees through dark alleys to escape. Major Calloway explains the racket that Lime organized. Stolen penicillin was watered down and sold for enormous profits. The facts convince Martins. Before he leaves he visits Anna Schmidt to say goodbye. On his way home Martins is startled to see a watcher in a doorway. He reports this to Calloway, who investigates and discovers buried facts. Martins goes to meet Harry Lime to warn him of what the police know. The conversation reveals Limes amorality, and Limes ignorance of history. Martins makes a deal to save Anna, but she doesnt want to be saved [symbolism?]. Martins is convinced to help Calloway by meeting Lime while the police keep watch. The trap works, Lime flees underground among the rats while the authorities pursue. A special force searches the sewer system. There is a dramatic ending to the chase that echoes He Walked By Night. Martins settles his debts with his old friend. [Lime had picked him for the patsy.] The film ends with another funeral, not a Hollywood ending. [This fast-paced film entertains without drawing attention to the improbable events.]

Switzerland is famous for its militia system that prevents any military takeover and guarantees its democracy. In olden days they also hired out to foreign monarchs who wanted a reliable armed guard. Cuckoo clocks represent a high value export for its day, like watches today. Limes slur on Switzerland is wrong.",1466467200,,3402,4.770797962648557

Andrews Blu-ray Review: THE THIRD MAN [1949], Carol Reed's classic tale of post-war friendship and comeuppance, is so uniquely stylized, it would seem that Carol Reed was in complete control of the picture from beginning to end. But dealing with producer David O. Selznick was something of a wrestling match for Carol Reed. And Orson Welles, who eventually stole the show and entered yet another realm of movie history as a memorably suave villain, purposefully turned the casting process into a cheeky game of cross-country cat and mouse.

Joseph Cotten plays Holly Martins, a two-bit American novelist who travels to Vienna, where his old friend, Harry Lime [Orson Welles], has offered him a job. Holly arrives to find that Harry Lime has died in a car accident. At the funeral, Holly meets Maj. Calloway [Trevor Howard], a military officer who informs him that Lime was actually a thief and murderer who had done brisk business selling tainted, often deadly penicillin on the black market. Eventually, Holly Martins will unexpectedly discover that Harry Lime isn't really dead, and that he suffers no guilt at all for having killed innocent people in the name of money. This causes to force Holly Martins to make a choice between protecting his old friend and helping the police take him down for his vile crimes.

THE THIRD MAN legendary finale, a nail-biting chase through Vienna's massive sewer system, is one of the great sequences in film history, and absolutely shouldn't be missed. But Orson Welles performance is also a mini-marvel, Graham Greene's sly dialogue crackles, Anton Karas strangely incongruous and equally effective, zither music casts a mesmerizing spell, and Carol Reed's final shot is an audacious jaw-dropper. You could argue that this immensely entertaining, if occasionally too self-conscious, picture is the best British film of the 1940s.

Still, THE THIRD MAN film's beginnings were simple enough. Carol Reed and Graham Greene, who had enjoyed great success with a picture called The Fallen Idol [1948], were contemplating another project when they had dinner with producer Alexander Korda. During dinner, Graham Greene showed Alexander Korda a brief paragraph he had written that began, ""I had paid my last farewell to Harry Lime a week ago, when his coffin was lowered into the frozen ground, so that it was with incredulity that I saw him pass by, without a sign of recognition, among the host of strangers in the Strand."" On that intriguing concept alone, Alexander Korda hired Graham Greene to write another screenplay for Carol Reed and then Graham Greene left for Vienna, and scripted THE THIRD MAN in about eight weeks.

Alexander Korda insisted that the story take place in Vienna, where four political powers like America, Russia, England, and France were then overseeing a rather corrupt post-war environment. He felt that this location would draw big-name American film stars, which would give the British production a leg-up in finding a U.S.A audience. Alexander Korda's game plan obviously worked, as the film became a major hit all over the world. While searching for inspiration in Vienna, Graham Greene had a fortuitous conversation with a friend who described a literal ""underground police"" department that patrolled the city's sewers, looking for shady types who were trying to pass from one Allied checkpoint to another without the proper papers. This titbit triggered Graham Greene's imagination, and led to Harry Lime's final bid for freedom beneath the cobblestone streets.

In Graham Greene's initial treatment for the script, Lime was described with a degree of detail that all but cried out ""Orson Welles."" ""The picture I have of him on my files is an excellent one,"" he wrote. ""He is caught by a street photographer with his stocky legs apart, big shoulders a little hunched, a belly that has known too much good food for too long, on his face a look of cheerful rascality, a geniality, a recognition that his happiness will make the world's day.""

Unfortunately, David O. Selznick, the film's American co-producer, had been driving Carol Reed and Graham Greene crazy with  inappropriate suggestions, and offered what he considered to be a brilliant casting choice for Harry Lime and none other than Noel Coward! How David O. Selznick came to the conclusion that the delicate, angular playwright (who rarely acted) was their man is anyone's guess, but Carol Reed wisely held out until Orson Welles was approved. On the way back to London via a privately chartered plane, Orson Welles played one final, brilliant prank on Alexander Korda. Vincent Korda asked him to hold a basket of fruit that he had gathered for his brother during the pursuit. This was post-war Europe, so fresh fruit was an exceedingly rare item. ""It was going to be offered as a great present,"" Orson Welles said. ""He'd gone and picked each piece of fruit. It was too good to be true! I knew Alexander Korda wouldn't touch any of it if it had been bitten into."" So, when Vincent Korda was asleep, Orson Welles carefully took a bite out of each piece.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Presented in its original aspect ratio of 1.37:1 and you get to witness a totally glorious crisp brilliant Black-and-White 1080p image transfer, and arrive on Blu-ray courtesy of StudioCanal. The release is sourced from the recent 4K restoration of the film. The 4K restoration is excellent. Generally speaking, edges are better defined and a number of close-ups look cleaner. Contrast levels are also better balanced. Some of the most obvious improvements, however, are with shadow definition, and plenty of the night-time footage now appears a lot better balanced nuances. Grain is well resolved and tighter, but in some areas it could be difficult to see the difference. In fact, there are various segments where the better balanced contrast levels actually make a bigger difference. There is some mild unevenness before, during and after select transitions, but overall image stability is actually improved. Plenty of flicker and sporadic light warping that were present on StudioCanal's previous release are also eliminated. There is no large debris, cuts, torn frames, or damage marks. All in all, I prefer the overall better balanced appearance of StudioCanal's release and I think that at this point it is unquestionably the best one on the market.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

DISC 1 [Blu-ray]

Audio Commentary: Commentary with Guy Hamilton, Simon Callow and Angela Allen: Here we find Guy Hamilton [Assistant Director], Simon Callow [Actor], and Angela Allen [2nd Unit Continuity] viewing the film with their comments and it is an audio commentary that is done just right. First to speak is Angela Allen and explains here relationship with working on the 1949 film. Next up is Guy Hamilton and also goes into great detail his involvement with the 1949 film, where he was brought in to be a first assistant, an finally Simon Callow chips in and informs us the reason he is there as he has a great deal of knowledge on Orson Welles. We find out in great detail why Anton Karas and his Zither was brought in to do the music soundtrack for the 1049 film, and all came about via Alexander Korda. Most of what they talk about while watching the first 10 minutes of the film, is mainly technical details, and it is mainly Simon Callow is asking all the questions. Simon Callow asks Angela Allen about filming down in the Vienna sewers and tells us it was a pleasant experience as they were very clean and smelt rather nice. They all talk extensively about the character Orson Welles plays in the film and we hear a lot of anecdotes that Orson Welles was a very eccentric person and all the antics he played up to before he appeared in front of the camera. Guy Hamilton and Angela Allen talk about Carol Reed and how he worked close with the editor so Carol Reed got the film looking like it wanted to appear in the cinema. We find out some very interesting facts about the music used for the soundtrack, whereas originally they were going to use a full orchestra composed music soundtrack, which idiot David O. Selznick wanted the full orchestra soundtrack, but Carol Reed put his foot down insisted that Anton Karas and his Zither was the preferred music soundtrack, but we also find out the interesting information on how Anton Karas got to be recorded, and Carol Reed sat Anton Karas in front of a Movieola and let him get on with composing the music as he watched the film and was all done in total improvisation, as Anton Karas cannot read music. But of course the Zither music became a missive hit around the world and especially for Anton Karas and it changed his life forever. As we get near to the end of the film, especially after the harry Lime funeral and it was all filmed at around 6:00am and everyone was tired and kept having lots of silly arguments, especially the ending of the film, and when you see Joseph Cotten leaning against the cart, you had men up in the trees throwing the leaves down and were told to take it slowly. But of course we are informed again about the dispute of the ending of the film, which had stupid ignorant David O. Selznick who caused lots of falling out with his idea of the ending, which would have been a total disaster, but of course Carol Reed sent a message back to David O. Selznick and told him to get stuffed, and so Carol Reed caused the great classic ending that was shot with Alida Valli who walks past Joseph Cotten and ignoring him, which of course David O. Selznick was totally incensed, but lucky for us he could not touch the film or change the ending, but of course David O. Selznick eventually got his comeuppance, because the 1949 film because the most massive box office hit around the world. And so ends another fascinating and interesting audio commentary, as you hear some totally fascinating interesting anecdotes about THE THIRD MAN film from especially Guy Hamilton and Angela Allen.

Special Feature: Shadowing The Third Man [2004] [1080i] [1.78:1] [89:39] This special rare documentary narrated by John Hurt, opens with a typical Graham Greene line; ""Isn't it rather dangerous to mix fact and fiction?"" and explores the making of Graham Greene's all time classic film THE THIRD MAN. This is the first documentary ever to be made on this much-loved film which was voted the best British film of the 20th century in a BFI poll. Shadowing the Third Man literally projects the classic 1948 feature film back to the original locations in the Austrian capital Vienna. Using state-of-the-art projection technology, the stunning images created by Carol Reed and the Oscar winning Director of Photography, Robert Krasker are beamed on a huge scale on to the glorious architecture of present-day restored Vienna and the city reclaims its place as one of the central characters in the film. You get to see how the great British director Carol Reed used the ruins of a bombed out city, just 3 years after WWII to set a superb stage for such stars as Orson Welles [Harry Lime], Joseph Cotton [Holly Martins], Trevor Howard [Major Calloway] and Alida Valli [Anna]. Two of the last remaining members of the crew have returned to Vienna to tour the locations and bring the filming to life. The Assistant Director Guy Hamilton, who went on to direct three Bond movies is joined by the continuity assistant Angela Allen, to tell what it was like to film in the Vienna sewers. Finally, Shadowing the Third Man looks at the fascinating creative east-west tensions between the British and American views of the world, as Alexander Korda in London, and David O. Selznick in Hollywood, the film's two immensely powerful Co-executive Producers battled it out behind the scenes to form the film in their respective images and the final outcome. Contributors are Angela Allen, Joseph Cotton (archive footage), Graham Greene (archive footage), Guy Hamilton, Trevor Howard (archive footage), Anton Karas (archive footage), Alexander Korda (archive footage), Vincent Korda (archive footage), Carol Reed (archive footage), Daniel Selznick (son), David O. Selznick (archive footage), Karl Hermann Spitzy, Alida Valli (archive footage) and Orson Welles (archive footage).

Special Feature: Interview and Zither Performance by Cornelia Mayer [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [4:43] Here we get to see Ms. Cornelia Mayer giving us a performance of the Harry Lime Theme and also the Caf Mozart Waltz. Here Ms. Cornelia Mayer explains in great detail about the musical instrument the ZITHER and we also find out that this young lady to play the musical instrument at the age of 10, and it was also at the same time the first time Ms. Cornelia heard the Harry Lime Theme played by her Father, and was also the first piece of music that Ms. Cornelia was taught. Ms. Cornelia Mayer also tells us that Anton Karas who composed the music soundtrack for THE THIRD MAN film, was not trained as a musician and self-taught himself to play the Zither and when he did the music for THE THIRD MAN he did not compose it on sheet music, but was all improvised while viewing the film.

Special Feature: The Third Man Interactive Vienna Tour [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] This interactive map was inspired by the film THE THIRD MAN and what you get to view is all the names of the places where the film was shot and when you click on each individual name title, you get to see Dr. Brigitte Timmermann, who is the founder and senior partner of VIENNA WALKS & TALKS and takes you on a tour of the City of Vienna and explains in great historic detail, as well as in-depth detail of each place the film was shot in. So basically you get to see Vienna in 1949 with film clips and then the same place in Vienna in 2015 and this is totally fascinating inside facts relating to the film and the locations. But I suggest you set aside some spare time, as to view the all of the named places with the map of the City of Vienna, will take the same amount of time it takes to view the THE THIRD MAN film. The places in Vienna you get to visit are: Karlsplatz [3:00]; Zentralfriedhof [4:00]; Stadtpark [3:00]; Sacher Hotel [5:00]; Josefsplatz [3:00]; Molkerbastei [3:00]; Am Hof [5:00]; Maria Am Gestade [4:00]; Hoher Markt [2:00]; Stephansdom [2:00]; Morzinplatz [3:00]; Ruprechtskirche [2:00] and Prater [4:00].

Special Feature: The Third Man on the Radio [1951] [1080p] [1.78:1] [20:00] Here we get to listen to a very rare American radio recording of The Third Man on the Radio: The Lives of Harry Lime. The episode we hear is entitled A Ticket To Tangiers [1951] and was written and performed by Orson Welles; and the 1951 Lux Radio Theatre adaptation of The Third Man, where Anti-hero Harry Lime is persuaded to travel to Morocco, where a dangerous widow needs his assistance. With each episode it would begin with ""The Third Man Theme"" being played, abruptly cut off by an echoing gunshot. Then Welles would speak: ""That was the shot that killed Harry Lime. He died in a sewer beneath Vienna, as those of you who saw the film The Third Man. Yes, that was the end of Harry Lime ... but it was not the beginning. Harry Lime had many lives ... and I can recount all of them. How do I know? Very simple. Because my name is Harry Lime."" Orson Welless deep rumble is very hypnotic, and had it not been for his involvement, this radio play would have been totally dreadful. Throughout the radio broadcast you hear the music of Anton Karas playing his Zither. I also found the sound very harsh, but if it had been recorded by the BBC the sound would be a much cleaner natural professional sound. One very strange aspect of this broadcast is at the end of the play we get repeated the music of Anton Karas playing his Zither.

Special Feature: Guardian / National Film Theatre Interview with Joseph Cotten [Audio only] [47:42] To set the scene we get the music of Aton Karas on his Zither doing the music from THE THIRD MAN. Recorded in 1987 and here we find Joseph Cotten who defies the Doctors orders by attending the NFT screening of THE THIRD MAN where, through a severe case of laryngitis, he talks at great length about the film and his career with the help of his wife, Patricia Medina. Its a delight to see or, rather should I say, hear the witty dynamic between this couple who are both entertaining to listen to and are very funny. One funny anecdote where hear, especially via his wife, is that they went back to Vienna for a reunion and was asked to take a trip down the sewers for a photo shoot and found the whole experience very funny, and especially being drunk their health with loads of bottles of wines, but at the same time they met the sewer police that were in the THE THIRD MAN film, but most of all it was very enjoyable trip down the Vienne sewers. Theres a particularly very humorous moment that plays out like this, with the Interviewer, where he says, Did you win an acting award for Portrait of Jennie? and Joseph Cotton replies by saying, Where is it? and of course the audience respond with hoots of laughter. Because Joseph Cotten had the severe case of laryngitis, I found it slightly painful to listen to him trying desperately to talk and sometimes you had a job to hear what was said, especially because of the badly set up with the microphone, plus of course when the audience asks questions you can only just about hear the question asked.

Special Feature: Guardian / National Film Theatre Interview with Graham Greene [Audio only] [8:04] This is a much briefer recording than the one with Joseph Cotten, whose interview was equally insightful, witty and very comical, and was recorded in 1984. When asked about David O. Selznicks involvement in the film, Graham Greene says dryly to the interviewer, We didn't accept any of his ideas, and quite understandable really under the circumstances. One of David O. Selznicks suggestions was that the film be called Night Time in Vienna instead of THE THIRD MAN and once again the audience laugh out loud at this ridiculous David O. Selznicks pointless comment. Despite the shorter length, there is still a lot of information was crammed in the session and it was also a far superior and much clearer recording session.

Special Feature: Joseph Cottons Alternative Opening Voice-over Narration [1949] [480i] [1.33:1] [2:00] Interesting to hear this rare item, but I cant help but feel that the Carol Reeds voice-over, of the European films opening minutes, suits the sardonic tone of the social-commentary of post-war Austria so much better, especially as it is a much more superior professional voiceover experience presentation. Somehow, for me it is not at all as affective with Joseph Cotten introducing the film in that way for the American audiences. I have nothing against Joseph Cotten, he was a marvellous actor, and it just sounds so much better with the Graham Greenes opening words being read by Carol Reed.

Special Feature: THE THIRD MAN: A Filmmakers Influence [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [16:06] In this brand new special feature, Martin Scorsese [Director] kicks off this discussion about the fascination with this classic film THE THIRD MAN, and Martin Scorsese informs us that the first time he saw this film was on his television in New York and was either in 1957 or 1958, he is not sure, but from that first viewing of the film he was hooked and stated to become aware of its powerful cinema image. The other contributors to this special are John Sayles [Director]; Hossein Amini [Screenwriter]; Franc Roddam [Director] and Ben Wheatly [Director].

Special Feature: Restoring The Third Man [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [19:38] In this brand new special feature, Paul Collard [Vice President of Film & Digital Services/Deluxe]; Marie Fieldman [Film Specialist]; Paul Doogan [Head of Scanning]; Tom Barrett [Restoration Supervisor]; Tom Wiltshire [Digital Restoration Artist] and Stephen Bearman [Senior Grader] discuss in great detail StudioCanal's new 4K restoration of THE THIRD MAN. I feel it is now the best you will ever view now that is has been presented in 4K image, that you will ever see from this StudioCanal Blu-ray disc and totally far superior to anything that The Criterion Collection brought out on the Region A/1 Blu-ray disc release.

Special Feature: Dangerous Edge: Graham Greene Documentary [2012] [1080p] [1.78:1] [56:00] This film is a portrait of a writer Graham Greene (1904-1991). It explores how Graham Greene's life both inspired great writing and drove him to attempt suicide. He was a British spy, a doubting Catholic, and a manic-depressive who wrote critically-acclaimed, best-selling novels, including The Quiet American, Brighton Rock, The End of the Affair and The Third Man. But before all that Graham Greene went to Berkhamstead School, where his father was headmaster, and was bullied, not least for the assumption that he was a spy for paternal authority (the spy persona would return later in reality; psychologically he himself remained his most elusive character). Graham Greene experienced profound depression and those brushes with suicide through Russian roulette and at the age of 16 underwent six months of psychoanalysis, an experience certainly progressive for its time. Other major participants include  novelist and screenwriter Sir John Mortimer, novelist and former SIS agent John LeCarr, award-winning literary critic and novelist David Lodge, acclaimed writer Paul Theroux, former CIA operative and author of The Great Game Frederick Hitz, Graham Greene's wife, Vivien Greene, and his daughter Caroline Bourget. Other contributors include Shirley Hazzard [Writer]; Dr. Kay Redfield Jamison [Professor of Psychiatry]; Norman Sherry [Biographer]; Belinda Straight; Richard Greene [Author]; Dr. Brigitte Timmermann [VIENNA WALKS & TALKS]; Bernard Diederich [Author]; John Perkins [Author] and Nathan Shropshire [Young Graham Greene].
