1784276,5,B00006L91Z,"For those who enjoyed the documentary that aired in July 2003 on PBS and couldn't find the DVD to buy, this is it!  This is the entire program with David Starkey as the narrator.  A very good account with live actors intermixed with historical locations and portraits.  My only criticism is that the costumes (particularly the headpieces) tend to be a lot more lavish than what they would have been and equal time should have been spent on the last four wives.  The time is allocated more on the number of years they played a role in Henry's life, so the first DVD is comprised of Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn, the second with Jane/Anne/Katherine/Catherine.  All in all, Henry VIII fans will not be disappointed.",1072656000,122,719,4.674603174603175

1784286,5,B00006L91Z,"If you have ever wondered about Henry VIII and his tragic 6 wives, the DVD THE WIVES OF HENRY VIII will enthrall and educate you. The Tudors had a brief reign and ruled England during one of the most tumultuous periods in the country's history. Henry VIII changed the religion and the future of England forever. His desire to find love and father a male heir caused him to marry six times and to execute two wives. Dr. David Starkey gives us incredible insight into the mind of Henry VIII and the fates of his 6 wives. The DVD is filled with a visual feast of Tudor England as actors relive history. Starkey may not be an exciting speaker but there is passion in his knowledge. The series is divided into two discs. Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn fill disc one from years 1509-1536. The bulk of his married life was with the brave yet tragic Catherine of Aragon. Disc two continues with year 1536 and Henry's marriage to his third wife Jane Seymour. Jane Seymour was followed by Anne of Cleeves, Catherine Howard and Katherine Parr. Only Jane produced the desired male heir and she died soon after childbirth. Henry knew that one male heir was not enough in an era where death often came at a young age.  Anne of Cleeves was chosen as wife number 4 after Henry fell in love with a painting of Anne. When they met in person, Henry was repulsed by her appearance. Anne was foreign-born, did not speak English and her style of dress and her mannerisms were alien to Henry. Above all, Henry liked petite women and Anne of Cleeves was more full-figured.  The story of each wife is remarkable in itself. Some were highly devoted like Katherine of Aragon while Anne Boleyn and Jane Seymour acted out of ambition rather than love. Catherine Howard was the child of the group and paid the ultimate price for her youthful love of frivolity and men. Starkey passes on some interesting facts about the wives. Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard were cousins.  Henry's last wife, Katherine Parr, was already twice widowed when she married Henry. She outlived him and married Jane Seymour's brother, Thomas. History sometimes is too strange to sees true and as they say,  ""You can't make this stuff up.""",1200614400,,2191,4.61025641025641

It was also very intersting to me to see his use of original documents (letters and decrees).  I had seen the series on PBS, but always fell asleep at some critical point.  Having the DVD at my disposal at home didn't keep me from falling asleep, but I could always go back and review it to see what I had missed.",1182816000,2,488,4.7176470588235295

1784291,4,B00006L91Z,"""The Wives of Henry VIII"" is a historical miniseries produced in 2002 that has aired several times on PBS stations as ""The Six Wives of Henry VIII"". A companion book to the series by Tudor historian David Starkey has yet another title: ""Six Wives: The Queens of Henry VIII"". David Starkey narrates the series, regaling us with the backgrounds and personalities of the 6 women who married King Henry VIII and their experiences as his wife, as they navigated the monumental political power struggles and dangerous court intrigues of Tudor England: Catherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn, Jane Seymour, Anne of Cleves, Katherine Howard, and Catherine Parr -""queen, lover, mother, outcast, victim, and survivor"" respectively.

Happily, the personalities and ambitions of these women are preserved in their correspondence and other documents, so their characters are not opaque. We can hear their own words and visit the places that their dramas played out. The wives' stories are told in David Starkey's narration as we watch dramatizations of the events. The dramatization serves as more of a punctuation to Starkey's compelling tale than as a source of information, which is unusual. Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn are treated in more depth than the other wives. ""The Wives of Henry VIII"" succeeds in bringing these women and their time alive in the viewer's mind, reminding us that history is anything but dry. It's the greatest of all dramas, and the wife of King Henry VIII was a perilous role to play indeed.",1170201600,9,1509,5.0602409638554215
1784292,4,B00006L91Z,"David Starkey gives us an excellent insight to the differences in the wives that Henry chose. He describes each Queen so well, it is as if he had met them!!

The actors are beautifully arrayed; and although there were a few small historical inaccuracies in terms of costume, if you aren't obsessed with minute details like this, its magnificently done.

1784298,4,B00006L91Z,"This DVD is an excellent addition to both the book of the same title and also the book and DVD ""Elizabeth"", also by David Starkey.

Any person interested in this period of English history will enjoy this DVD.  David Starkey is an excellent narrator and historian and obviously has an affinity for the period.  The only criticism that I have is that maybe the DVD skips or makes light of some issues, however, the book puts that right and actually makes the DVD more enjoyable.",1124668800,7,476,4.576470588235294
1784299,3,B00006L91Z,"I was extremely excited when this series was announced, but after seeing episode 1 I was bored and decided not to bother with the rest.

This is probably much more interesting to someone who is not familiar with Henry's marital escapades.  The history and analysis were simplified and shallow, even given the very real limitations of the format.  Part of the problem is that the visuals aren't used effectively to enhance our understanding or bring the characters to life.  There is a certain amount of eye-candy, but this would lose very little if it was used as a radio broadcast.  It would be fine as an introduction and overview, so long as the viewer realizes that things were a lot more complicated.  I don't think that anyone already familiar with this oft-told tale will learn much.

Rather than really acting, the visuals were done more like tableaux of people moving against historic backgrounds.  These sometimes got VERY repetitious.  There was one shot of Catharine of Aragon praying that was used over and over.  While there were some handsome shots, the casting, costuming and makeup left a lot to be desired.  I think that in portraying historic figures, it is a good idea to be guided by their portraits.

The casting for Henry and Anne was fairly good.  Catharine of Aragon was red-haired, but for some reason she was played by a dark-haired actress, presumably to ""look Spanish"".  Sloppy, sloppy.  I am sure that the audience could have coped with an auburn-haired Spaniard.  One of my criteria for judging a book on Henry's wives is whether or not the author realizes that Catharine was not dark-haired and that she was quite pretty as a young woman.  The glimpses that we got of Jane Seymour were not promising.

Although the costuming was generally handsome the women's headresses were often wrong.  O.K., maybe it is a little picky to wince because Anne Boleyn is wearing the wrong style of French hood, but accuracy is nice, and probably wouldn't have cost any more.  Again, why not rely on her portraits?

The makeup was truly appalling.  Catharine of Aragon looks exactly the same at 16 as she does on her deathbed at age 50.  It was remarked by one foreign visitor when she was in her 40s that the King of England was young and handsome, but his wife was old and deformed.  I think that portraying her as she actually looked might have added to our understanding of the web of reasons that inspired Henry to seek an annulment.  Henry also looks the same at 17 and 44 - couldn't makeup and costume have made a little effort?  At least shown him as clean-shaven, as he was when he was young and added the beard and a little poundage as he got older?  Ironically, the story makes a point of saying that Anne Boleyn was visibly aging although she is the one who is shown for the shortest time period.  The visuals simply add very little to the program, a serious flaw in a visual medium.

I can only hope that this has inspired viewers to go out and read on the period.  David Starkey's book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Six-Wives-The-Queens-of-Henry-VIII/dp/0060005505/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Six Wives: The Queens of Henry VIII</a>&nbsp;is much better than this.",1124236800,12,3236,4.884403669724771
1784300,5,B00006L91Z,"David Starkey's documentary miniseries ""The Wives of Henry VIII"" first aired on PBS in 2003 to wide popular and critical acclaim. When the film was released in late September of 2004, I bought the DVD set, (2 discs), and have enjoyed watching them immensely, as have my friends and family. There are four episodes which focus on the lives of Katherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn, Jane Seymour, Anne Of Cleves, Catherine Howard and Catherine Parr, all wives to the same man, (one at a time, of course), Henry VIII, King of England, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, and Supreme Head of the Church of England, (as of 1544).

The episodes are remarkably detailed given the time constraints. The monarch's personal and political reasons for selecting and/or rejecting, (or beheading), his spouses are depicted to some extent. An example is Henry's relationship with Anne Boleyn. The focus here is on the role their marriage played in Henry's divorce from Queen Katherine of Aragon, and the split with the Catholic Church, which sets the stage for the English Reformation, and years of war between Catholics and Protestants. There are obvious simplifications, but this is an excellent overview. It is truly remarkable to see how one man's decisions about his personal life effected the course of British history and that of all Europe. What one should remember here, is that when reading history, or as in this instance, when viewing it, that it is subjective and open to interpretation. There are learned historians who will forever argue, for example, about whether Richard III was a hero or villain.

Dr Starkey, a notable British academic, history teacher, writer, and broadcaster, introduces the series and narrates throughout this almost 3 and one-half hour historical production, directed by Stephen Clarke and Mary Cranitch. The commentary is intertwined with dramatic presentations, (wonderfully well acted and directed), actual historic locations and painted portraits of the protagonists. The costumes are lavish and appropriate to the period. I recommend David Starkey's book ""Six Wives: The Queens of Henry VIII"" as a companion to this film. Also, his book ""Elizabeth,"" is one of my favorite and most accessible biographies of Queen Elizabeth I.

The DVD provides clear imagery, a strong picture, and stereo sound. Extras include text biographies and a family tree.

1784301,5,B00006L91Z,"If you would like a good overview of the lives of the wives of Henry VIII and don't want to pick up a book, this is the place to start. These DVDs are beautifully done, the costumes are wonderful, and the use of actual historical sites is great. I only had one complaint and that is Catharine of Aragon on her deathbed looked younger than Anne Boleyn first come to court!

1784302,2,B00006L91Z,"...but I feel duped. I really don't see the beauty and drama everyone's talking about. Instead I see a bunch of actors standing--literally standing, frozen in tableaux--and looking straight into the camera, smiling or frowning or whatever, while Starkey works himself into a lather in his narration. The whole thing has a rushed and oversimplified feel to it (example: Anne Boleyn insisted that Henry VIII divorce his wife and marry her....HELLO, a little more complicated than that). What's really baffling is that Starkey, of all the people on the face of the earth, should know better than to present this as a simple little fairy tale. Even the details people rave about--the costumes, the hairstyles--are distracting. Jane Seymour wears a fantastic contraption on her head unlike any I've ever seen in portraits of this period, and is decked out like the Queen of Sheba while she's still only a lady-in-waiting. And hair-down-over-the shoulders is not a Tudor period hairstyle. There were lice at court. Only the queen wore her hair loose on formal state occasions. The women playing Anne Boleyn and especially Catherine Howard (who Starkey makes a point of telling us was a ""teenage queen""--Johnny Cash, anyone?) look too old for their roles. It sounds petty, but it's touches like these that are supposed to really bring a series like this to life. Unfortunately they can also damage it as well. The worst part has got to be Starkey's delivery--he's really over the top. If you've ever seen Jack Horkheimer talk about astronomy, you have some idea of how worked up this guy gets.",1105920000,29,1586,4.988679245283019

It does a superior job of portraying the drama of the court of Henry the VIII in an compelling fashion without focusing on the gratuitous or sensational facets that so many historical docu-dramas focus on.

The reign of Henry the VIII undoubtebly changed the course of British history. I would recommend this as an essential piece to learn more about this turbulent period. This mini-series gives you an excellent perspective as to how Henry's decisions in his ""personal life"" affected his country, and even Europe, as a whole.",1100217600,15,660,4.936936936936937

I'm a history major, so I'm a huge history addict (The highlight of my year is going to renaissance faires) and this particular time period is my most favorite, so I was thrilled when I saw that it was on DVD.

1784305,5,B00006L91Z,"This PBS mini series, narrated by David Starkey, describes in great detail the six wives of King Henry the 8th and their respective lives and fates. PBS has always been the first and foremost in high quality mini series regarding history. After all, it has seens such great mini series as The Civil War and Jazz. The costumes, authentic to the Tudor Era, and the acting is very well done and the insight into what really happened is exciting and engaging. King Henry the 8th did not intend to marry six wives throughout his entire life. He wanted a son or many sons to be his heirs and future kings of England. He felt he was assaulted with enormous bad luck because his wives proved to be unsuitable and he never fathered a male heir who lived to be king.
The series is divided into parts, each tape has the story of his sequence of wives in chronological order. He first married the Spanish-born royal, Katherine of Aragon, daughter of the famous Queen Isabella of Spain. Katherine miscarried all her boys and the only health living daughter she mothered was Mary, the future Queen Mary aka Bloody Mary who in her overzealous Catholic passions, ordered the burning of Protestants in England. Henry the 8th divorced Katherine, formed his own Church, and married Anne Boylen. Anne Boylen, his most famous wife, did not provide him with any male heirs either. Her supposed promiscuity was used to scar her name and as grounds for adultery for which she was beheaded. Next came Jane Seymour. She proved to be his best wife. She gave birth to Edward, but she died while giving birth. Edward lived only until his teens and never ruled England as an adult for he was a sickly boy. Jane Seymour's death brought on the need for a new wife. Henry married Anne of Cleves, a German princess. Here's something silly. Henry the 8th, who was no Adonis himself- he was short and fat, believed Anne of Cleves was ugly and unattractive and soon divorced her. He married the teenage Katherine Howard, who was too young and impetuous to handle the status of queen. She cheated on Henry the 8th with her former lover. She was beheaded and next came Katherine Paar. Although she was a gentle and seemingly fitting queen, she attempted to reform the Church in England to the newly established Protestant/Lutheran religion. Katherine Paar married her first love, Thomas Seymour, after Henry's death. Their story marks the beginning of Queen Elizabeth's story, for when she was still a princess, she was living with Katherine Paar and Thomas Seymour. But that's another story. Here's the thing about Henry the 8th. He didn't get a male son to be king, but he got the best thing England ever saw as far as monarchy- Queen Elizabeth I.",1086048000,112,2710,4.683438155136268

7971270,5,B00006L91Z,"David Starkey is one of the greatest historians of English history of today and here presents a penetrating and moving portrait of the six wives of Henry VIII, presenting Henry in all his cruelty and egotism and the tragic tale of his wives.
The actresses and recreations were compelling and I could strongly sympathize with the fear and pain of Anne Boleyn (played by Julia Marsen)when she was framed for adultery by Henry's evil chief minister Thomas Cromwell. Anne Boleyn was an intelligent and well educated woman with strong opinions on religion and politics, quite different from the inaccurate picture we get in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Other-Boleyn-Girl/dp/B0018STVHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Other Boleyn Girl</a>
She played an important role in persuading Henry to renounce the Pope and the Catholic Church and move England into becoming a Protestant country. she certainly did not commit adultery but her strong character was seen as a threat. This together with her crime of giving birth to a girl child instead of a son, that turned the perverse Henry against her.

Strangely Anne of Cleves known to be rejected by Henry because she was unattractive was played by the very fetching Catherine Siggins
I liked Michelle Abrahams (Coronation Street) as Catherine Howard, and Starkey's explanation of Catherine's fun loving upbringing, her frivolous nature and love for men (I really believe Catherine Howard had a loving nature and her sexual adventurousness could never be held against her given the cruel fate of being used as power pawn by her unscrupulous family).

Starkey makes the very palpable point that As Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard were English Henry could send them to their deaths, with no repercussions whereas Catherine of Aragon and Anne of Cleves were spared this fate as Henry would never risk the anger of their families who ruled over states in Europe.

Even the staunchly Catholic Jane Seymour as we see was threatened at one point with being reminded of Anne Boleyn's fate when she meddled in the affairs of state.

We also learn just how close Katherine Parr came to being executed, because of her religious fervour and aim to strengthen the Reformed faith in England, Caroline Lintott showing her despair and fear when it seemed she had incurred Henry's wrath. she may well have been sent to the scaffold had it not been for Henry's death.

One can see that his favorite period in English history is of the era of Henry VIII, Mary I, and Elizabeth I--all of them unforgettable and notorious people in equally graphic times. I watched most of it when it was on TV years ago, but now, as it's on DVD, I can only find expensive versions of it everywhere. They are all consistantly 50-100 dollars a set per web sight! It's the 2nd most difficult to afford DVD set I'm currently after and the only thing from Dr. Starkey I don't already own and love. The ""Rudest man in Europe"", Mr. Starkey is the most fun to watch, eliquent, straight forward, and rhetoricly fun (in his own way), but I don't know if I can afford this volume as it's currently priced above. Ahh, well--time will tell--cut me a deal :)",1314748800,,892,4.478527607361963
