3718348,5,B001NG6A0Y,"This was my 2nd Christian based dvd I brought of Leslie's.  The first one,""Walk the Walk"" was very good on days that I want spiritual inspiration, but the music was a little dull for my taste.  This one, ""A closer 2 Mile Walk"" is the better one.  The music is more upbeat and I love the pray at the end by Father Farrell.",1238198400,20,321,4.063492063492063
3718349,5,B001NG6A0Y,"I have been walking with Leslie for years and I have many of her videos.  I just love this new video! It is very pleasant and enjoyable.  Loved the music, the choreography, and the occasional Bible verses were very inspiring.  I laughed out loud and another time became teary eyed because I was so moved by the words of the song, ""Here I am Lord"".  It was also a great moderate workout. And I'm so glad that Leslie included the blessing with her Pastor, Fr. Phillip Farrell!  I was physically, emotionally, and spiritually moved!  Great job Leslie!",1233878400,101,548,4.597938144329897
3718350,4,B001NG6A0Y,Just purchased this dvd and I really enjoy it. I like the music and the walk. It is only two miles so would be nice for a new walker. I use it when I want a gentler dvd.,1233014400,27,169,3.473684210526316
3718351,5,B001NG6A0Y,Had been doing another one of Leslie's videos for a year when a personal crisis came into my life. I first picked this video up from the library and was startled to find that the theme music used in this video was the same hymn I had been drawn to in my crisis. The video was an affirmation that we need to keep moving through our lives one step at a time.,1470873600,2,356,3.9583333333333335
3718352,5,B001NG6A0Y,"Yes!  This DVD workout was just what I needed: a good way to ""walk"" off the pounds and stay fit easily.  I would definitely recommend it to other ladies my age, 60+, who prefer working out at home instead of a gym.",1467849600,,214,4.071428571428571
3718353,5,B001NG6A0Y,Leslie is the best and have the best dvds,1460246400,,41,3.6666666666666665

3718361,5,B001NG6A0Y,"A very pleasant change from music typically used for aerobics videos.  To be clear, the music is definitely about Christian faith, not just spirituality in general.",1447286400,,164,5.3076923076923075
3718362,1,B001NG6A0Y,"I really like Leslie Sansone and use her 2 mile walk.  However, I was disappointed with the Walk By Faith. I bought it in order to have a good walking workout with accompanying Christisn music.  Both were disappointing.",1446681600,,219,4.7368421052631575

3718368,5,B001NG6A0Y,"I always enjoy walking with Leslie at home.  This 2 miler is definitely a sweat maker!  But love the songs of faith that

3718377,4,B001NG6A0Y,I was hoping that there would be 2 two mile walks but there is only 1 and the other is a from the priest.  I wish it was just faith songs to walk with on this dvd.,1427241600,,163,3.4054054054054053

3718380,1,B001NG6A0Y,"I'm sorry I like most of Leslie Sansone's videos, but this one is not that good, I have the one Walk the Walk A Christian Inspired Work out and thought this was the same, but it is not, I through it away",1425427200,,203,3.857142857142857
3718381,4,B001NG6A0Y,"She's a bit too chatty for my taste, but the exercises are perfect. I enjoy doing my 2 miles a day (with the volume off) to my own music or even while watching a movie.",1425340800,,168,3.8285714285714287

3718383,3,B001NG6A0Y,I was a little disappointed with the music in this video.  I expected much more contemporary Christian music and it is mostly music only and music I was not familiar with.  I am still looking for a workout video that has popular christian music to work out to.,1424304000,2,260,4.395833333333333
3718384,5,B001NG6A0Y,I took this one to our church sewing workshop on Wednesdays. We would exercise after lunch. Nice break from sitting all morning.,1424131200,,128,4.863636363636363
3718385,3,B001NG6A0Y,Expected better music instead of a couple of good songs.  Low impact workout.  Try walk your belly fat by Leslie Sansone for more effective workout of your mid section.,1422748800,,168,4.758620689655173

3718388,3,B001NG6A0Y,The video was just okay. Very much like her other videos. Was disappointed that it didn't have much of a spiritual content as I thought it would.,1420761600,2,145,4.407407407407407
3718389,4,B001NG6A0Y,Good workout,1419292800,,12,5.5
3718390,4,B001NG6A0Y,"After buying some of Leslie's more recent ""upbeat"" DVD's, this was more in line with her old style and nice to revert back to it.  Easy to follow, the 2 miles goes quickly and no ""bounce, bounce bounce"" in this one.  Where are her original walkers.  Miss seeing them.",1417392000,2,267,4.408163265306122

3718394,5,B001NG6A0Y,I love Leslie Sansone videos. This is my 6th of her videos. I am not as healthy as I once was but I can still use these. Walking and swimming are the only exercise I can do. This walking video adds great motivation for me by allowing me to mix faith and exercise. This is better than just walking because Leslie uses her 4 leg movements along with her incorporating arms too for a better arobic workout.,1411257600,,403,4.246753246753247
3718395,4,B001NG6A0Y,2 miles in 30 minutes. Got me sweating.,1410134400,,39,4.0

3718401,4,B001NG6A0Y,As a woman of faith I found this workout very encouraging. It's intended for those that are just starting out on the journey of walking. It's a great video to start with. The blessing from Leslie's parish priest was an added bonus!!,1401753600,,232,4.5476190476190474
3718402,5,B001NG6A0Y,One of my favorite walking aerobic videos and it came in record time! Thank you!! :),1401321600,,84,4.3125
3718403,5,B001NG6A0Y,We like to use this whenever we cannot get outside to walk.  Leslie's Walk by Faith DVDs are very well done and we are able to feel a sense of accomplishment.,1401148800,,158,4.096774193548387
3718404,1,B001NG6A0Y,"I have no idea what that video is, but it is NOT Leslie Sansone.  I would be interested in seeing this workout, because I have her 2 previous walking/faith videos.",1400976000,3,163,4.433333333333334
3718405,5,B001NG6A0Y,Gets my heart and spirit pumping!! Love the energy and great feeling afterwards. Awesome workout that is fun to do. :),1400198400,,118,4.666666666666667
3718406,5,B001NG6A0Y,"Leslie Sansones A Closer Two Mile Walk is a thirty minute walk featuring Leslie and a cast of walkers. This is a nice brisk energetic workout. As always, Leslie features her four basic moves (walking in place, kicks, side steps, and knee lifts) but adds some nice variations to each move. There are lots and lots of sidesteps in this workout (almost too many) including single and double sidesteps. There are also tap out sand plenty of knee lifts (singles, doubles, and four at a time). The workout is a bit intense but Leslie always knows when a particular move is too much and transitions into another move. While this is part of her Walk by Faith Series and features spiritual music, some written inspirational quotes on the screen, and a separate blessing by a pastor, you can do this walk even if you are not particularly religious - the music is nice but not overwhelming.

I really like Leslie Sansones A Closer Two Mile Walk  - it is a good workout for both the body and soul.",1400025600,,985,4.52808988764045

3718408,4,B001NG6A0Y,This was very similar to other Leslie DVDs I own.  There were no surprises. and  I  really like the music.,1397606400,,106,4.2
3718409,4,B001NG6A0Y,Nice easy uplifting walk. I like to use it on Mondays when I haven't walked during the weekend to ease back into it.,1396742400,,116,4.086956521739131
3718410,5,B001NG6A0Y,I have a lot of Sansone's walking DVDs but this is by far my favorite. I love the music. I love the moves. And the 2 miles goes by so quickly..,1396483200,,143,3.6451612903225805
3718411,4,B001NG6A0Y,I was hoping that there would be christian music for walking throughout the video.  There was only music at the beginning.,1396483200,,122,4.809523809523809

3718416,3,B001NG6A0Y,"I thought this DVD would be filled with uplifting spiritual music as we exercise, but there was only a few songs at the beginning and end of the session.  I would have liked more spiritual music throughout the work-out. The exercise portion is fine for women like me who can only do low impact aerobics.",1393113600,3,303,4.509090909090909
3718417,5,B001NG6A0Y,"I also have many of Leslie's walking DVD's.  This one is not only a great workout it is so inspirational.

I love Leslie and this DVD is my absolute favorite.",1391385600,,354,4.147058823529412

3718421,5,B001NG6A0Y,I recently got hooked on Leslie's walk. 2 miles is perfect for what I have time for. I love that this version is faith-based and that it includes a blessing by her Pastor. Jesus walked in his ministry and so can we.,1389657600,,215,4.142857142857143

3718425,5,B001NG6A0Y,I chose this rating because it is a great DVD. It lets you walk at your own pace and she tells you to just walk if you can't do all they do at first. I recommend this to anyone that is just starting out. She is fantastic because she understands not everyone can go at the same pace.,1375660800,,282,3.8793103448275863
3718426,5,B001NG6A0Y,"I love this walking DVD as much as all her other ones.  I will do this 2 mile walk and then do another one of

3718428,5,B001NG6A0Y,"I love Leslie Sansone's walking sessions.  Here in Houston, it's too hot to walk during the day.

3718435,5,B001NG6A0Y,I prefer her regular series to these faith workouts. Although faith music and talk go away at about 10min into it. Then it is just like normal..... I love Leslie' walks.,1369440000,,169,4.483870967741935

3718440,2,B001NG6A0Y,"I have dome several Leslie workouts, and continue to do them even though I am not thrilled with the music.  This DVD has similar moves and workouts, but the music, with the exception of ""Here I am Lord"" is not discernably Christian music, which is why I bought the DVD to start with; it's some bad take on Disco music. ""Here I Am Lord"" is not music that fits in very well with the workout either.  At he beginning of the DVD when the song is used, there is no beat to work out to.  In short, if you need a different workout DVD this DVD weuld be OK but do not buy it if you are interested in working out to Christian music.",1341446400,5,623,4.008064516129032
3718441,5,B001NG6A0Y,"I have walked with Leslie off and on over the years.  This is a wonderful 2 mile walk.  I really enjoyed her sharing her faith and the connection between mind, body and spirit.  Thanks Leslie!",1330992000,,192,4.428571428571429
3718442,4,B001NG6A0Y,"This was my first video from Leslie Sansone.  This workout was very unique with walking in place in your own home and then adding some kicks, step touches, knee lifts, and arm movements, too.  I worked up a sweat.  The only thing is that Leslie does giggle a lot which can get on some people's nerves, but I just ignore it.",1326931200,,323,4.262295081967213
3718443,5,B001NG6A0Y,"This DVD workout exercise is really good for the days when you know you need to exercise but perhaps haven't got the time or the strength to do a lengthy session.

Those unfamiliar with Leslie, she has four basic steps. The walk in place, knees-up, kicks and sidesteps. With all of these she add variations and you're open to add your own as well. The message is keep the pace of the music and keep moving!

Doing it will at least affirm that you're not lazing around on a sofa dreaming of a lean fit body - you'd be actually doing something to attain that dream! And it really does go by very quickly.

I've done and usually like five mile Leslie Sansone workouts; even doing those you don't really worry about the time. But when you've finished this 2 mile one, you think, is that it? Even if you are in a real hurry, it still gives you a feeling of wanting to do more by the end.

I like the faith bits. It's uplifting and motivating. If anything though there was not enough Christian faith issues in this DVD to warrant it being called a faith DVD. It just has a very short second video, (5 mins), with her Pastor, (or was it Father - can't remember), talking about walk with faith. Don't get me wrong it's nice but it's like one of her workout DVD with a meal-plan - you wouldn't call it a cooking workout video because of it would you?

The verses were good though. Again not enough of them.

I bought it specifically because it had this faith aspect to it but like I said it didn't go far enough. Methinks it was trying to appease to non-believers which is sort of wrong - like why call it a faith dvd if it's not going to have a lot of that in it? And what about the believers?

I like the workout, but because there's only two miles, you're only just beginning to break out a sweat when it's time for the cool-down.

It's 35 minutes long so you should have plenty of time to fit it in somewhere in a busy schedule.

This is probably best aimed at those who are just beginning to work out, the infirm and/or time challenged people. For the experienced fitness freaks it's best suited for off days - when you're just not up for it for whatever reason but you want to be able to say you done SOME exercise!

*NB* Just want to add this is my first faith Leslie Sansone dvd and judging by other reviews there seem to be more. Will check them out as never knew there were any others.

**Also it's really time these dvds provided subtitles, (in different languages), for the deaf and hard of hearing and for anyone else who could benefit from it.",1317254400,,2548,4.243801652892562
3718444,2,B001NG6A0Y,"This is a typical Leslie Sansone video, so of course it is a good workout. And if you just want to do the moves you know in a different order and see some different ladies in different outfits then buy this video. I own three videos of Leslie's now, and they are all basically the same workout. I now just turn the volume down after I know the routines and listen to Christian CDS while working out. I love Leslie's advice, but only the for the first week or so of having a new video. I thought this one might be different with Christian music in the background, but really it is not. I have a 2007 video (3 mile and 4 mile Walk) that I feel is better quality than this one. So if you already have a Leslie video, I suggest spending the money you plan on spending on this DVD to buy a new great Christian CD, turn your old video down and listen to your CD and see if it is not like a whole new experience.",1300924800,6,905,4.005524861878453

Recently, I found out I have a touch of COPD and that really cuts into the length of time I can exercise.  I happened to come upon our local cable on-demand channel, and found the fitness network and I tried this Leslie Sansone DVD, and it was great! I was able to comeplete the program with no problems concerning my knees or my breathing.  I looked up Amazon on the computer and found a few more of her Walking DVD's, so I bought this and the one and two mile DVD'S from Amazon also.  They are great!!  Really worth buying!",1300320000,4,751,4.08843537414966
3718446,5,B001NG6A0Y,"Depending on your fitness level, this is a moderate to easy walk. I like the music, but I wish it was a little louder. Leslie would probably have to talk a little less.  She does tend to go on a bit much, but this is Leslie. You can exaggerate your movements or push yourself more to get more out of it. Or you can add hand weights. She has harder workouts when you're really to push harder. I love Leslie. I find her motivating and real.",1296000000,2,438,4.093023255813954

You can also use it to ""relax"" on during off days. As Leslie points out after a few minutes into the tape ""I know your spirit is lifted. Your mood has changed..."" and ""This is really healthy for your body, mind and soul.""

I especially like that Leslie reminds you ""This is a walking workout. You're not trying to learn steps"". She really seems to enjoy teaching and the people she exercises with. Her emphasis is not only on improving physical health but emotional and spiritual as well. I like that the tape has a little added script running across the screen towards the end of the second mile.  It reads: ""I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."" How this reminds me of a number of (walking) half marathons I have done in the past where about the ten mile mark my muscles started to hurt so bad I felt like I might need to quit. Remembering those words helped me get through. I think for beginning walkers those are important words to think on as well. This is, after all, a basic tape but one that certainly motivates the exerciser to do so much more.

Finally I liked that the tape contains a blessing (of Leslie's new studio) by a Catholic priest who reminds us ""The greatest person who walked the face of the earth ACTUALLY walked the face of the earth"" referring to our Lord Jesus Christ at the time he walked the earth as a man.",1286582400,18,2002,5.427652733118971
3718449,4,B001NG6A0Y,"I've been a Leslie Sansone fan for quite a few years now but this is the first of her ""Walk By Faith"" series that I've bought.  I love the beginning hymn ""Here I Am, Lord"" (also repeated a bit at the end) but I wish that all of the workout included more inspirational hymns to accompany the walking exercises.  The rest of the tape has background music with soft tones and a strong rhythmic beat which are great for keeping up the pace but I would have loved some faster paced hymns with inspiring lyrics so much!

Also, the sound on my DVD is not consistent.  The volume goes up and down which is a bit distracting.  I would still recommend this DVD, however.  As usual, Leslie Sansone's workouts leave you feeling so good and energized!",1284595200,3,738,4.389705882352941

I originally was avoiding these Christian ones b/c I'm not Christian and I thought it would be annoying (sorry Christians, being honest here to hopefully help people similar to me who may be interested in this DVD) but it isn't that bad.

When I first started my weight loss journey four years and forty pounds ago, it was Leslie and the real people she works out with that helped me to see that I just had to get off the couch and put one foot in front of the other. I find Leslie as an instructor to be wonderfully encouraging and very positive. These days, when I don't feel like exercising, I pick a Leslie Sansone workout because she helps me remember why I'm exercising in the first place (to be fit and healthy for myself and my children). I really enjoy the Closer 2-Mile Walk DVD and love the addition of faith to a workout routine. I find this workout as motivating and approachable as all of Leslie's DVDs. I love the music, too. I just wish the Christian music was throughout the entire workout instead of just during the warm up and cool down segments. That's my only suggestion. Otherwise, I think this is another wonderful walking workout DVD from Leslie Sansone, and I highly recommend it!",1244419200,20,1037,4.463157894736842

It starts out with a nice warm up and then takes you right out of the gate elevating your heartrate quickly and keeping it there for the next 20 minutes.  The music is very up beat and also up front so you can hear Leslie talking and have a nice strong beat to walk to as well. I always love listening to Leslie talk through the workout and find her informative and entertaining.  As far as Christian music goes, the warm up song is spiritual and she lets us know that it is her favorite song of all time.  Then it goes on to regular walk music and has a few bible verses pop up along the way.  It's a great workout no matter what type of exercise you are looking for.  I highly recommed trying this- you won't be sorry!",1244419200,8,831,4.092592592592593

3718469,4,B001NG6A0Y,"I was SO excited when I found out that Leslie had put out another installment into the faith line of dvds!  Her first, Walk the Walk ""A Christian Inspired Workout"" was where it all started for me in my walking with Leslie and her dvds.  If I could give this new ""A Closer 2 Mile Walk"" half stars, my rating would be 4 1/2 stars!  I loved the new set and the walkers with Leslie.  ""Here I Am Lord"" is one of my favorite songs out of the old ""Glory & Praise"" songs that made their way into Mass & worship back in the late 80's.  The only reason I took a 1/2 star off is that I was disappointed that there was not more recognizable songs to the 2 Mile walk to go along with ""Here I Am Lord"".  The songs in Leslie's 1st ""A Christian Inspired Workout"" had such songs (albeit more traditional) throughout both the 1 Mile walk and the 2 Mile walk on the dvd.  In her book ""Getting Fit With Faith"", is yet another 2 Mile faith walk dvd that I also include as one in her faith series in my Leslie walking library.  Even though I own quite a few other Leslie walks & workouts on dvds, it is a pleasure to add ""A Closer 2 Mile Walk"" to my Leslie library. It's so uplifting to walk in His light and with the positivity of faith along as it plays in my dvd player.  I'd recommend this to all Leslie walkers who wants to put a positive bounce to their step as they walk side by side with God.  It's my hope, there will be more dvds & walks to come in this series!  Father Phillip is a wonderful, I would love to be able to sit in his parish mass and listen to one of his homilies!
