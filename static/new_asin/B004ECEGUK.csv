4336576,1,B004ECEGUK,"Very dissapointing release, I is unviewable, returned the first one received, was rapidly exchanged by amazon but the second copy is also unviewable, already paid and still awaiting for a good copy. Starting it flickers the image with the Fox logo for 2 seconds and goes blank, the same thing in both copies,

4336578,4,B004ECEGUK,"I saw this movie years ago. Too bad it is not available on DVD (USA format) now.  I would definitely buy it for my classic movie collection. Tyrone gives a good performance, as does Patricia Neal who was an excellent actress.",1330732800,5,225,4.487804878048781
4336579,4,B004ECEGUK,"A diplomatic courier (Tyrone Power) for the State Department is set to receive an important package from a colleague and old friend (James Millican) in Austria but the contact pretends to not recognize him and is later murdered and the package missing. Veteran director Henry Hathaway (TRUE GRIT)is behind the camera for this intriguing espionage cold war thriller. Shot in B&W by Lucien Ballard (THE WILD BUNCH), the film doesn't take full advantage of the colorful Austrian and Italian locations which would have benefited from a Technicolor perspective. It would have been different if the B&W photography contributed a noir-ish post WWII atmosphere like Reed's THE THIRD MAN but it's not that kind of picture. The film profits by having two femme fatales, a globe trotting widow (Patricia Neal) who Power meets on an airplane and a Czech spy (Hildegard Knef) who Power meets on a train. Hathaway keeps the movie whizzing along to its conclusion with very little lagging. The large cast includes Karl Malden, Lee Marvin, Charles Bronson, Stephen McNally, Herbert Berghof, Helene Stanley and Michael Ansara. An enjoyable, if minor, entry into the cold war movie canon.

The Fox DVD via Spain is a nice B&W transfer in its appropriate 1.33 aspect ratio. Spanish subtitles are removable.",1305072000,16,1287,5.128571428571429
4336580,5,B004ECEGUK,"I LOVED IT!!! Already watched it 3 times. Love the suspense and romance. So excited to have it. Tyrone Power is great, Patricia Neal is her great self, and Hildegarde Neff is great. Love the way she talks.",1404345600,5,205,4.421052631578948
4336581,3,B004ECEGUK,"It was a pretty good story, but hard to tell which were the ""bad' guys and whish were the ""good"" guys. It was also hard to figure out exactly what was going on. I got lost several times.",1403654400,,186,3.9210526315789473
4336582,3,B004ECEGUK,"I love Tyrone Power. He made this Cold War thriller in the early 1950's and it takes you all over Europe with plenty of twists and turns. Ty really gives his all and you will see many soon to be stars, like Lee Marvin popping up. It is not great, but I liked it.",1399680000,2,262,3.8703703703703702
4336583,5,B004ECEGUK,"Good movie but what's not to like about Tyrone Power. He's a great actor and was excellent in everything he did. It's just  a
shame that he died too young. I want to see all of his movies that are left and I have quite a few of his.",1394755200,3,232,3.7346938775510203
4336584,4,B004ECEGUK,"This film held my interest from beinning to end. All of the actors were at the top of their game. It sparked my interest to the point that I am going to purchase the book, Sinister Errand, on which the movie is based.

The cold war was so simple as compared with today's international problems!",1393027200,4,294,4.345454545454546
4336585,4,B004ECEGUK,"This is a good, solid spy caper featuring a good, solid Tyrone Power in a more adult role than when he was being used by Daryl Zanuck as his answer to Errol Flynn.  Power showed he could act in ""The Razor's Edge"" and ""Nightmare Alley"".  This is a good vehicle to expand his dramatic chops in.  Not a great film but a very enjoyable one with fast pacing and a good cast.  If you like Power or even remember him this is a good example of what he could bring to the screen.",1388620800,2,470,4.021505376344086

4336589,4,B004ECEGUK,"I love old black and white classic movies, which this qualifies as. My collection of over 500 movies , which Amazon can testify  to, is loaded with some of the finest ever made. I'm still adding to it. Yatahey!  D.E.K.",1359849600,3,218,4.425
8426777,4,B004ECEGUK,"Great movie.  Sadly, not pressed, or burned on M-DISC

I completely understand that obscure movies like this may not economically justify pressing a disc.  However, I would have gladly paid a dollar or two more for a disc that would last forever.  Instead, they burned the movie on the old-fashioned, purple dye type disc that are only good for around 5 - 7 years. M-Disc last 100s of years.

This review is for the actual item I received from Amazon. If you are after a, ""pure movie review"", I suggest you look at the International Movie Database. There you will find many reviews without regard to the delivery mechanism.

Great Movie !!",1515888000,,639,4.660714285714286

8426784,4,B004ECEGUK,"Probably one of the lesser known Tyrone Power films, this filmed on location Cold War spy thriller has many twists and turns that keep you guessing.

I bought this because I'm a fan of Tyrone Power and like most every film he was in (well, some more than others).  I had never seen it before so I took a chance and was happy that I did. On another DVD in the Tyrone Power collection, Patricia Neal is interviews about her role in this film so I was intrigued enough to buy this. He's still pretty darn handsome in this one; only a bit older and less of a callous youth, as with is films from the 1930s.

Remember, as with all of the Fox Cinemas Archives DVDs, there are no extras of any sort - just the movie. All very barebones!",1406505600,5,729,4.156028368794326
