4264272,5,B00462QJRQ,the Movie that I bought is great. I received the movies in a timely manner. the transaction was hassle-free. I love to shop with Amazon. Keep up the good work.,1325548800,,159,4.333333333333333
4264273,1,B00462QJRQ,"I'm getting all 6 seasons for my brother for Christmas and this is a scam.  I can get the 5 seasons for $74.95 individually, leaving $91.54 for the box itself.  Even adding season 6 is $106.03, leaving $60.46 for the box, which is still too expensive for a box.  At [...], Scott T Williams said that ""When bundling things together, they should give a discount for buying the bundle, but it should NEVER cost more for a bundle."" and I agree.  I am getting; 6 seasons of Supernatural (1-5 for $14.99 each, total $74.95; season 6 for $31.08), a bunch of Jeff Dunham DVDs (Spark of Insanity and Arguing with Myself for $7.49 each, total $14.98; Very Special Christmas Special for $8.49; The Jeff Dunham Show for $9.73), Gabriel Iglesias Presents: Stand-up Revolution for $14.99, and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (Dimension Collector's Series) for $5.55.  The price is $159.77, A $6.72 PROFIT BY NOT BUYING THIS!  It would normally cost $251.31 for the box set.  DO NOT BUY THIS, BUY THEM SEPARATELY, IT'S WAY CHEAPER!!!!",1323302400,17,1018,4.7175141242937855
4264274,5,B00462QJRQ,"Great product, very happy with them.  Also received sooner than anticipated, so that was great, considering it was an international purchase.  Postage to NZ was 3 weeks from time of order.  Much appreciated.",1318896000,,207,5.212121212121212
4264275,3,B00462QJRQ,I found that some of the discs skip or will not play right.  Very disappointing but not all of the discs do this.,1318464000,3,113,3.9130434782608696
4264276,5,B00462QJRQ,"I've only recently gotten into Supernatural, after catching a handful of episodes on TNT in the morning; and I've really come to love it. So of course I thought, ""I'm gonna get the DVD's, and then I can watch it whenever I want."" And I don't regret it. I thought the price was very reasonable, especially considering the near-perfect condition they were in. The cases were bent a little bit, but the DVD's are excellent. Also, the shipping was very fast. The estimated arrival date was from September 16- October 3. And I received it Sep. 17th. Great product!",1316563200,7,559,4.656565656565657
4264277,5,B00462QJRQ,This is a great series. It's funny and entertaining while still having a horror movie feel to them.  I plan on getting the 6th season.,1313971200,2,134,4.36
8416957,5,B00462QJRQ,Very good show,1485734400,,14,4.0
8416958,2,B00462QJRQ,"We ordered the box set for my daughter's birthday.  When it arrived today, we received each individual DVD package (Individual seasons 1-5).  Which was disappointing.  We specifically wanted a box set.  The picture and the description is obviously for a BOX SET not individual DVDs.  Feeling disappointed.",1416873600,,305,5.404255319148936
8416959,1,B00462QJRQ,seasons 1 through 5 are not worth anywhere near that much. seasons 1-8 are $120 don't get robbed people. cause this is bull,1401667200,2,123,4.391304347826087
8416960,4,B00462QJRQ,"Surprisingly interesting series.  I was expecting a cheesy, teeny-bopper version of the X-Files, and got more than I expected.  The main mythology of the show is pretty good, and I loved the lighter funny episodes.  While it certainly has X-FIles moments (certainly due to some of the same crew) the interaction between the main characters gives it it's own unique flavor.  Just wish Castiel had shown up sooner.",1384732800,,412,5.014705882352941
8416961,1,B00462QJRQ,"Bought the product over a year ago and just recently opened up my ""new"" dvd sets and found that quite a few of the discs were scratched and one will not play on any device I have in my home.  To me that is not new that I paid for.  I will never buy from this vendor again.",1381881600,,272,3.6724137931034484
8416962,5,B00462QJRQ,My DVD's arrived earlier that expected. Supernatural is a great series. Great stories and plots.,1365638400,,96,5.466666666666667
8416963,4,B00462QJRQ,"To anyone who enjoys reading about or researching myths and legends of ghosts, goblins, witches and demons will certainly enjoy Supernatural.

The two brothers, Sam and Dean, in each episode, track down and destroy beings of the supernatural and the paranormal to rid society of the damage they are causing. The entire series (I bought them all! Blush!) was well done with some very good special effects of the creatures the brothers encounter. This series has taken many of the popular legends such as the ghost girl hitchhiking along the highway, the man or monster with a hook for an arm menacing the parked couple etc., ad nauseum and made them almost literally come alive on the screen.

I would normally give this series five well-deserved stars except for one detail that continues to pop up repeatedly: I was not at all comfortable with the way Supernatural dealt with God and the angels. It appears that God and all the angels in heaven are constantly warring with one another and are always disorganized and killing each another over personal power trips.  As a firm believer in God and His awesome power, I felt Supernatural made it appear that God was always ""away"" somewhere or at least always ""unavailable"" when all the demons of hell were being released. Don't you think that God might have at least raised an eyebrow over this? The heavenly angels, namely Castiel, are always in some kind of trouble and don't appear to know what to do. The angels bring bad news to the brothers but cannot do anything about it. The devil and most all the demons, however, always appear to be organized and strong.  Couldn't they have made God and the angels not seem so unorganized, stupid and always warring against one another?

Other than this, it is well worth watching!",1360454400,,1774,4.765472312703583
8416964,5,B00462QJRQ,Great quality!  Love the extras and can't wait for the next batch season 6 - ? as a collection rather than buying individual ones.,1359590400,,130,4.416666666666667
8416965,5,B00462QJRQ,"I love Supernatural!  I've never bought CD's of TV show before but I really love the show....interesting, fun, exciting and funny and dramatic - and 2 cute guys all in one show (3 cute guys if you count the angel).  These have interviews and outtakes included.",1357862400,,260,4.630434782608695
8416966,5,B00462QJRQ,"This is a must for any fan of the supernatural itself.  They take things to the weird and extreme.  They push more bounderies than anyone even know exsisted.  Dean, the hunter at heart and Sam the reluctant one, travel from place to place.  Trying to make the world a safer place for all of us that live in it.  Do be afraid of the monsters in the closet and under the bed.  But always know that Dean and Sam will be there to take care of them and to keep you safe.  The love/hate relationship (hate on Sam's part)between these two brothers is very touching and will make you cry.  All the things that Dean has done for Sam to be able to go to school and Sam doesn't even realize it.  Dean has been watching over and taking care of Sam since he was 4 and Sam was 6 months old.  That is a lot of burden to place on a 4 year old boy, but Dean has lived up to that and when it comes down to the wire even is willing to die for Sam.  Need to own so that you can watch over and over again.",1333324800,5,984,3.87
