8526456,5,B008A16KEQ,"I ordered this series years ago, and have found it to be one of the most insightful and meaning full bible studies I have ever done. I continue to review it from time to time, there is so much information here its difficult to take if all in unless you review it over and over. Very professionally done and an excellent study for the serious student of the Bible.",1415059200,2,363,4.27536231884058
8526457,5,B008A16KEQ,"I have a friend who raved about this DVD set for months on end, and eventually bought me a set as a gift.  I've been watching it for a few days, and WOW, it is just as my friend described - REALLY GOOD!  Missler delves into areas of Genesis that most people never give a 2nd thought to, such as what happened between Genesis 1:1 and 1:2 - WHY was the earth now void and in confusion, right after having been created in verse one?

Missler examines the scientific evidence behind the various aspects of creation, and stretches our imagination by exposing us to such things as the mind-blowing science behind quantum physics, for example.  If you are a thinking, questioning person, you will love this DVD set!",1394928000,3,708,4.5078125
