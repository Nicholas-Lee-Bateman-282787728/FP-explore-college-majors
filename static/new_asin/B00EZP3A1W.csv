8610857,4,B00EZP3A1W,I enjoy the assortment of DVDs in this but feel that they are a bit short and can get repetitive to watch after a while,1529539200,,119,3.8
8610858,2,B00EZP3A1W,"This product is advertised as being The Best of Sesame Street.  I was expecting episodes of Sesame Street but its basically all Elmo! Elmo is fine for a while but his voice and speaking of himself in 3rd person really gets old.  I want the old fashioned Sesame Street, I want my children to experience the variety show I grew up watching.  Now, I will say that when I went back to look at the detailed description after receiving the set, it does in fact list all the individual dvd titles.  My fault for not reading that first but who knew I would have to! Seriously, label the thing The Best of Elmo so its more accurate.",1525651200,3,623,4.299145299145299
8610859,1,B00EZP3A1W,"Elmo ruined Sesame Street. This product is an example of how bad they let it become.

Give us actual old classic episodes that were educational and entertaining. A full collection. Not this Barney-wannabe garbage.",1520726400,,213,5.264705882352941
8610860,5,B00EZP3A1W,"My grandson loves these, although my daughter is a bit aggravated, because the songs are stuck in her head. It keeps my grandson entertained and he interacts with these very well.",1519603200,,179,4.806451612903226

8610864,1,B00EZP3A1W,"Looking for best of Sesame Street not a collection of Elmo!
He's a fun character sure but I miss the rest of the ""cast"" and even my 3yr old nephew is sick of Elmo!!! He keeps asking ""Auntie, where is everyone else??"" And then shuts the DVD off. If I could rate this ""Best of"" collection (HA!) a zero I would! Do not waste your money- it's most certainly not worth $50-60!",1397952000,11,371,4.166666666666667
8610865,4,B00EZP3A1W,My toddler loves it! I think the school bus look is a great touch. All the DVD's contain games you can play with your child to reinforce the lessons learned.,1390435200,2,157,4.266666666666667
8610866,1,B00EZP3A1W,got this thinking it was going to be packed but it wasn't so far the dvds are only about 20 minutes long.  not through the box completely yet but this seems to be a disappointment. 1 episode of elmo on each. ok after having this for 3 weeks it becomes infuriating. this was very misleading and prompted me to come in and change my review from 3 stars down to 1. this is not sesame street but straight elmo which is fine if you're looking for elmo but I wasn't. on top of that the discs don't let you skip to play. you have to sit through a fundraising pitch and promos for other products on most but not all of the discs making this seem like it's a bunch of leftovers that they just threw together to get rid of. for the price I don't recommend this,1387929600,27,750,4.0675675675675675
