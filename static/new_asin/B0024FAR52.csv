3846482,5,B0024FAR52,"Along with many other people, I hope that the packaging is better than season 11. I don't know who's idea it was to put DVD discs in between two pieces of cardboard! I rarely watch season 11 just because I don't like taking the discs out.. even though I know I could easily put them somewhere else, I too do not want to rip the cardboard holding them.

I do think the show started going downhill when they were practically ""name dropping"" on every single episode, but I always have and always will love my Simpsons and I will buy season 12 the day it gets released.

I never did get into the whole ""plastic head"" boxes though. When season 6 was released and the only choice you had was Homers plastic head I was thinking, ""That's kind of late in releasing the seasons to change the boxes!"", I did send for the normal box though. I'm annoying like that, my boxes have to match! Ha!",1242777600,,880,4.295180722891566
3846483,4,B0024FAR52,"season 12 is one of the last seasons the show is still good/funny n what knot.

But I forget what season the show isn't funny anymore. The reason why I only give this 4 stars is because of one of my favorite characters on the show named Barney Gumboe isn't funny anymore ever sense days of wine episode where he quits drinking duff beer.

Before that episode barney used to be wicked funny like he sat in the bar all day long drinking an burping, etc....whenever they showed him.

But on seasonm 12 they do show barney but he drinks coffee not duff beer.

anyway besides that character I still think the show is good at 12th season.

I used to get excited when a new simpsons episode comes on but anyway I half the time stop watching the newer ones in the middle of the episode because because I think that they are lame/cheesy, etc..

ok i'm done with the post.",1242691200,2,862,4.290123456790123

The packaging will most likely be the same as the fan hated packaging for the eleventh season, here's hoping that FOX will respond to fans outrage by making the packaging for this set different. It would be nice to have a DVD boxed set that actual protects your DVD and makes them easily accessible but I wouldn't get my hopes up. Artwork on these sets is always well done though.

3846486,4,B0024FAR52,"The Simpsons Season 12, is the point where some fans, even the most dedicated really believe the show started to go down the tube, so to speak.  I respectfully disagree.  While it may not have the consistency of good episodes you found in earlier season (ie 4-9) it still has some stand out episodes.  Some of my personal favorites from the season include:  A Tale of Two Springfields, Homer vs. Dignity, The Computer Wore Menace Shoes (which is one of my favorites), Skinner's Sense of Snow, HOMR, Tennis the Menace, Day of the Jackanapes (which marks the first appearance of Sideshow Bob since Season 8), Hungry Hungry Homer, and Children of a Lesser Clod.  While having many solid and hillarious episodes, there are some bummers in this season also.  Worst Episode Ever is pretty bad, and the rest in the Season are pretty passible, but not necessarily bad.  Furthermore, I believe this season starts the trend that we still see in the Simpsons today, where the ""B story"" or secondary plot of the episode is better or more funny than the main story.  Notable example being Pokey Mom where Homer's spinal trouble and garage run chiropratice is far more humorous and entertaining than Marge and her convict painter.  If you're a true collector however, I would recommend getting Season 12...I will.",1240531200,7,1299,4.841628959276018
3846487,5,B0024FAR52,"We all know the many, many problems with season eleven's packaging. To this day I almost never watch that season cause I'm afraid of a: scratching the disks when taking them out of the sleeves and b: ripping the sleeves. It makes me tempted to copy them onto different DVDs so I can watch them when I want to, but of course, Fox doesn't want us to make copies.

We don't know what the packaging will be like this time around, though I am guessing it'll be similiar to the last design, with comic book covers instead of midway scenes, but what we do know is that there are some very good episodes in season twelve! The complete list:

""Treehouse of Horror XI"" - The yearly Halloween insanity!

""A Tale of Two Springfields"" - A personal favorite! Gotta love the badger at the begining!

""Insane Clown Poppy"" - Krusty has an illegitimate child. Only one?

""Lisa the Tree Hugger"" - Lisa goes green!

""Homer vs. Dignity"" - Homer becomes Burns' prank-monkey.

""The Computer Wore Menace Shoes"" - Any resemblence between this episode and a certain 1960's British TV series is completely in your imagination, Number Six.

""The Great Money Caper"" - Homer becomes an artist. A CON artist! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Ah, I slay me.

""Skinner's Sense of Snow"" - Imagine a snow day where you're trapped in the school. Sucktacular situation, but a fun episode!
""HOMR"" - Homer has a crayon lodged in his brain. Messy.

""Pokey Mom"" - Marge kicks it with a fun-loving criminal.

""Worst Episode Ever"" - Comic Book Guy falls in love... with Skinner's mom! Terrifying!

""Tennis the Menace"" - Lots of tennis. Yeah, that's about it here.

""Day of the Jackanapes"" - Sideshow Bob and his boy-bomb attempt to destroy Krusty!

""New Kids on the Blecch"" - Yeah, it's got NSYNC, but it's still a fun episode!

""Hungry, Hungry Homer"" - When the owner of the Isotopes tries to move them to Albuquerque, Homer rises to the occasion! Pft. Imagine the idea of Albuquerque having it's own baseball team. It is to laugh!

""Bye Bye Nerdie"" - Eh, not one of the best. It's a Lisa episode, but kind of, well, lame.

""Simpson Safari"" - The Simpsons are goin' to Africa!

""Trilogy of Error"" - Three stories meet up together to make for one good episode!

""I'm Goin' to Praiseland"" - Flanders tries to create an amusement park devoted to God and Maude!

""Children of a Lesser Clod"" - Lisa takes up gymnastics and Homer tries to run a day-care center!

""Simpsons Tall Tales"" - a fun ""anthology"" episode centering around old folk stories and legends.

Lots of good episodes here, I just hope that Fox gives us good packaging this time around! They won't, of course, but I can dream. I can dream.

*** UPDATE ***

Sadly, Fox ignored me and most of the other fans out there and released this season in a format almost exactly the same as what they did with season 11. I'm guessing seasons 13, 14 and 15 will be the same. I'm quite disappointed. I like the show well enough that I'll probably buy these anyhow, so I suppose the fault is mine in to that extent. Oh, well.

It does need to be said, though, that at least the artwork they chose for the DVD folder thingy does look really, really good!",1240358400,26,3139,4.523049645390071

Worst Episode Ever will be on here - COMIC BOOK GUY!!

The DVDs are housed in accordion-like cardboard sleeves that are so thin and tight, the only way to get the disc out without out nicks or scratches or fingerprints would be to tear open the sleeve.

There is a scene in ""HOMR"" which I love where the new intelligent Homer goes to the theater and they are playing a romantic comedy with Julia Roberts and Bill Pullman Homer says ""It's obvious she is going to stay with him"" and then then Dr. Hibbert says ""What! I thought she was going to stay with the snobbish guy"" then he gets kicked out for killing the movie for everyone else.

This is the last season before the long, dark period of mediocrity known as the Al Jean years.  Even in this season it becomes more hit or miss, which some great episodes like ""HOMR"" (where Homer becomes a genius by getting a crayon out of his brain) and ""Hungry Hungry Homer"" (where Homer finds out the Isotopes are moving to Albuquerque--and there really is an Albuquerque Isotopes team!) but also some lesser episodes.  Though of course not everyone would agree with that assessment.  For a complete list of episodes, go to Wikipedia or something and then you can decide whether this is a season you want to own or not.  This isn't the Worst Season Ever, but it's also not the Best Season Ever either.  By this season they'd started to ""jump the shark"" and yet it's gone on for another 10+ years, so that by now the poor shark has been bludgeoned to death.

I think this is it for me, because I just don't think it'd be worth it to buy the later seasons.

Having never seen any of the episodes as they aired on TV, I only got Season 12 as I already had 1-11 on DVD. To my delight it features hardly a single bad episode and is consistently funny with dozens of laugh-out-loud moments. Absolutely brilliant!

  In my opinion, this is were The Simpsons start to curve downward. I'm not saying they're horrible episodes. All I'm saying is this is the start of it becoming not as funny as prior seasons. I loved to death seasons 1-11. This season is good just not great.

  Enough rambling..lets talk episodes...

  There are 21 episodes, and yes there are some far better than others in my opinion. Undoubtely my tops 3 favorite episodes of this season are in no particular order :

  ** I'm Going To Praiseland --I love Ned Flanders character and all of his episode based shows are so touching to me. This one is really good.

  ** Hungry Hungry Homer-- I love Homer's drive to stand up for whats right. Super funny episode though very serious. I mean sheesh think about it, Homer on a hunger strike, the odds of that are once in a lifetime :)

  ** HomR-- Another Homer based episode, I thought it was funny the first half of the episode than it gets really heartwarming and serious toward the end. It has the old vibe simpsons aura to it, with Homer and Lisa finding a bond like they have so many times before.

  The episode that I didn't care too much for was Insane Clown Poppy. All in all this season is a good season at best. BTW, I'm not a fan of the packaging for this season, season 11 and season 20.

The packaging on these DVD's have been pretty bad. Reason number one beign that the discs are not clearly marked as to what season they belong too. This is irritating when you own every Simpsons DVD set there is. Second, trying to pull the discs out of the packaging is just play annoying. Scratching happens easily.

In regards to the Season itself I still find the Simpons funny. Every episode has some lines that make me chuckle. Maybe not as much as some earlier seasons but for a show that has been running as long as this one has I think it's still pretty good.",1263427200,2,670,4.528925619834711

However, the packaging has changed again and is more annoying than usual. Do they not test these thing with children or something? And the DVD menus are just as bad as ever.

3846636,1,B0024FAR52,"When it comes to seasons 1-11 of The Simpsons, there isn't many negative things I can say about all those episodes; as I like 95% of them, with most of those being ones I can watch over and over and over.  I don't know what happened between after the Eleventh season was complete and the time they got together to start writing the Twelfth season, but there's no way those responsible for seasons 1-11 could possibly be responsible for this pile of crap that is season twelve.  They must have completely changed the writers, because every single one of the episodes is more outrageously stupid than the next.

I realize this is a cartoon and crazy things happen in cartoons as far as plots are concerned, but the plots for every one of these episodes are just ridiculous.  If you sit down and watch any random three episodes from this season, and then watch any random three episodes from any of the past seasons, you will see what I mean by how obvious it is that a change in writing staff has been made and stupid outrageous plots that don't even seem Simpson-like.  I think that might be the best way to describe these episodes, the Simpson's characters are all there, but the episodes don't feel like The Simpsons.  There's not a single episode in season twelve that I have a good thing to say about; I hated them all.",1253664000,3,1322,4.4875

3846639,4,B0024FAR52,"The twelfth season of this show follows the Simpson family into another year of dysfunction and cartoon absurdness. Although I think The Simpsons is considered one of the greatest TV shows of our time, the show has gotten very stale into its (sigh) twentieth year on TV. Honestly, they should've ended The Simpsons years ago. It saddens me to see people who would rather watch Family Guy or South Park over this once hilarious show...but onto the twelfth season:

This four disc set contains all 21 episodes from the twelfth season of The Simpsons, including classic episodes like the eleventh addition to the infamous Treehouse of Horroe series (as well as the season finale Simpsons Tall Tales), Skinner's Sense of Snow (where the students of Springfield Elementary are snowed in at the school with Principal Skinner), Homr (the emmy winning episode where Homer discovers that a crayon lodged into his brain has made him a moron all these years), Pokey Mom (where Marge takes care of a convict who has artistic talents), Worst Episode Ever (Comic Book Guy dates Principal Skinner's mom and Bart & Milhouse  run the comic book store), Tennis the Menace (the Simpson family take up tennis and it tears the family apart), Hungry Hungry Homer (Homer goes on a hunger strike after learning that their baseball team is moving to Albuquerque), Trilogy of Error (three different stories intertwine between Homer cutting off his thumb, Lisa going to the wrong school, and Bart finding illegal fireworks), I'm Goin' to Praiseland (Ned Flanders builds a Christian amusement park in honor of his deceased wife, Maude), and Children of a Lesser Clod (Homer starts a daycare and ignores Bart & Lisa). Despite having a handful of classic episodes, it's not enough to match its glory years (seasons 2 through 7), and most of the episodes end in complete nonsense, which is unlike the best stories from The Simpsons earlier years.

This season also has quite a bit of guest stars as usual, such as Stephen King, Drew Barrymore, John Updike, Amy Tan, The Who, Jay Mohr, Leeza Gibbons, Patrick McGoohan, Joshua Jackson, Edward Norton, Charles Napier, Michael Keaton, Robert Schimmel, Bruce Vilanch, Tom Savini, Venus & Serena Williams, Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi, Gary Coleman, `N Sync, Stacy Keach, Kathy Griffin, Frankie Muniz, Shawn Colvin, and regulars Kelsey Grammer (Sideshow Bob) and Joe Montegna (Fat Tony).

This set of course has the usual extras that you'd expect from a Simpsons set. There's a special intro by series creator Matt Groening, Audio Commentaries on each episode and deleted scene, Multi-Angle Animation Showcases, Commercials, a Global Fanfest featurette, Sketches, Special Language Feature, and the best of the Comic Book Guy. Nothing really exciting or ""new"".

In conclusion, The Simpsons: Season Twelve is a decent season. I have decided I will keep buying each season of The Simpsons until I reach the one that gets stale. And so far at this rate, it's coming soon. I remember the last good season was the thirteenth season, but I haven't really been keeping up on The Simpsons for the past few years. Overall, I would definitely recommend this set for diehard fans of The Simpsons, if not, you'd be better off buying an earlier season. Also, (the elephant in the room) The Twelfth Season's packaging is terrible. Fox has switched over the set design to a strange ""accordion style"" case that can easily scratch your discs after the tenth season. BUYER BEWARE!",1253059200,,3472,5.0103986135181975

3846645,3,B0024FAR52,"My review for Season 11 of The Simpsons was less than favorable. I dint enjoy that season too much and itched to finish it. Season 12 isn't that much different.
I did enjoy this season a bit more than the last, but thats not to say this season is great by any means..
I find it upsetting that I don't enjoy these anymore...I remember the days of being able to watch Seasons 2-8 within a couple of days!
It took me nearly a week to get through this DVD set!
There are some good *but not great* episodes (HOMR, New Kids on the Blecch, Im Goin To Praiseland, Skinners Sense of Snow) and some not-so-good ones (Tennis the Menace, etc..a few too many to list)
There are no obvious stand out episodes. Because of that, the season leaves you feeling very wishy-washy on the whole. Was the DVD really worth the price?
Season 11 was pretty average but it had Behind The Laughter to save it from complete ruins!
The season is honestly not the worst one...but it is far from the heyday of The Simpsons and is literally (in my mind) The beginning of the end.
I am buying these DVD sets because I started buying these nearly 8 years ago and I want to complete it. Like any avid DVD collector.
Unfortunately if you are looking for quality Simpsons and are thinking of buying this (and you are not a collector)...then I would stay away from this.
Please go and purchase any seasons from 3-9. Those are quality episodes that will make you fall in love with the show.

As for the DVD packaging...it is horrendous.
Absolutely horrendous.
I was hoping they would fix it after last seasons extreme negative reaction but there are no changes.
I got out a disc and it scratched as I took it out. Not only that, but there was glue on it.
This is unacceptable packaging and I honestly don't know why I bother with these DVDs anymore.
I appreciate the art design ad it looks great..but the execution of the discs with their eco-friendly angle is just such a huge mistake to anyone who wants their DVDs to be pristine!
Not only do I miss the days of the earlier DVD episodes, but I miss the packaging!
If you want to take care of the discs, I strongly recommend buying something else to put the discs in or skipping this set altogether.
Its just not worth it!

Overall I give the episodes 3 stars
The packaging...1 star!

I really hope FOX finds new, less damage inducing ways to package these discs for Season 13...but knowing them..they probably wont.
Id start finding alternate packaging, people!",1252281600,12,2473,4.454746136865342
3846646,1,B0024FAR52,"First off let me start by saying I that love the Simpsons. I have not yet gotten to see this season, so I can't comment the episodes themselves. However I did buy Season 11 and this season is packaged the same way. You have to slide the disks in and out of the cardboard causing scratches to the disks and occasionally jamming a disk in the casing causing further damage to the disk. I would strongly caution would be buyers to heed this warning and check out the episodes by getting them from the library.

If you do buy it- I would advise storing the disks elsewhere, unless you want to end up with scratched disks that you can't watch and have to buy another copy. I'm curious what Fox is thinking? Its probably cheaper for them to package them this way (while still charging normal prices),but at our grief. Hopefully other fans will make voice this sentiment otherwise the future seasons will probably  be packaged the same way (fox studios phone # 310-369-1000).",1252022400,3,968,4.557471264367816
3846657,5,B0024FAR52,"Twenty years and counting the Simpsons remain more than just a long lived television show.

They are an American icon mirroring the insanities that run deep into our culture and give us a thirty minute vacation each week (or at least for a few of those thirty minutes depending on the scripts).

For those avid Simpson episode buyers I would suggest steering clear of the commentaries this time around.  Though careful attention was paid to them in earlier seasons, this time around it's basically just a bunch of guys sitting around laughing at their own jokes (though admittedly their jokes are very funny but you can hear them by listening to the episodes anyway).

As for the episodes, perhaps my favorite from the season is the one where L.T. Smash recruits Bart and company to form a boy band.  The episode guest stars In Sync who fortunately came ready to laugh at themselves.  It also features some hilarious and toe tapping faux boy band songs.  Thanks to this episode I smile every time I think of the phrase ""YVAN EHT NIOJ!""

I also like the Kelsey Grammer episode...as always.  Grammer's sonorous voice coming from Sideshow Bob is just funny.

For those of you Simpsons fans no persuasion is necessary.  For those of you not inclined to buy probably no persuasion would work so if you choose not to buy at least watch an episode.

I promise you won't regret some portion of thirty minutes you give it.",1251763200,,1413,4.676113360323886

The earliest seasons I still dig completely, and can watch a billion times over and still laugh (sometimes even still catch a joke that I missed the first 999 million times). For many years I had watched the show religiously, never missing a Sunday (or Thursday, depending on what year we were in...)  However, by season twelve those days had already passed for me. I was a senior in High School with other stuff to do... and plus the show had sort of hit a slump for a couple of previous seasons...

But the timing was right. I was home again on Sunday nights... or hangin' at my friends house and watching The Simpsons every week. This was by far their best season in a number of years.

I watched right from the beggining... TALE OF TWO SPRINGFIELDS (The one with The Who in it). It's easy to notice that the raw old school animation of the show had completely moved into pristine twenty first century production by this point, but the off the cuff writing, and surrealistic jokes and attitude were at top form.
 With a ton of gems... My absolute favorite is the (sur)really wonderful COMPUTER WORE MENACE SHOES episode. On par with some of my earliset favorites. This is the one where Homer is kidnapped and brought to ""The Island."" I've seen it about 900 million times, so I've got a few more to go. The best. But also we have the one with Michael Keaton as the in-mate trying to reform under the wing of Marge. Or how about the one with the washed up western actor? Or when Krusty gets mixed up with the Mob. The Homers thumb episode, done to the beat of Run Lola Run,,, or Even the N'SYNC episode is hillarious. I love the song, which is a subliminal government message to join the Navy.  Or whatever,,, just a really great season!

I think in the seasons post eight or maybe nine, season twelve would be the only one I would drop the cash on for DVD. It is a diamond (or rather a ""DIA-MONNND!!!"") in the rough of the later (IMO)mostly watered down seasons... with several episodes worth keeping. Many more than I mentioned even. After this season, I would just stick to syndication.",1251244800,5,2131,4.4512820512820515

The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season is one HELL of a season - completely underrated - and, in my opinion, better than seasons 11 and 10, and even 9 and 8. The bonus features are alright, as usual. 24 minutes of deleted scenes on the fourth disc, best Comic Book Guy moments from up until 2001, Butterfinger commercials and a Red Rooster one from 2000/2001, and a Simpsons Fanfest from 200...1 I think? And, as always, there is also commentary on every episode.

As far as the boxing is concerned, Season 12 is a bit better than eleven. The discs are easier to get out of the box, and the material sleeve that the discs go in is a little more scratch resistant. The Comic Book Guy head you see on the box, as with season eleven, can be taken off. There is only bit of that peely-glue stuff to take off.

Overall, as I said, this is a great season, and is probably my favorite season since season 7, or maybe 8... I'm probably one of VERY few to say this, but I just really thoroughly enjoyed most of this season. It started slow, but it really got going, and the Simpsons Tall Tales and Trilogy of Error episodes were a great little change. I really recommend this season.

4.5/5

Pros: Several awesome episodes, I counted 11 ""epicsodes"" out of 21 episodes... that is a really good ratio. Also some pretty cool bonus features.

Cons: The box, while slightly improved, is still pretty subpar. The first disc for the most part doesn't have very good episodes... that's really about it.

And now we wait for season 13...",1250985600,28,6557,4.665798611111111
3846663,4,B0024FAR52,"Been taping the show since its debut December 1989.  20 years this year.  About to start season 21.
Wish the show was still good.

I did NOT want to purchase this version of the DVD.  I wanted the normal card board holder set but I could NOT because of where I purchased it.

For when the show was still good but had lost the appeal from the previous seasons.

Best show of the season for all of us internet hounds ""The Computer Wore Menace Shoes"".  Homer as Mr X was good.

From the stupid years when they started the season with the Treehouse of Terror episode AFTER Halloween.  I hated this.

Normal usual extras on the DVD's.

TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE, PACKAGE TO GET THE DVD'S OUT OF, HOW THIS WAS DESIGNED.

3846664,4,B0024FAR52,"By this point the series had settled into a too-comfortable format that this season exemplifies.
1.  Hilarious first act that is soon left behind by the actual plot.
2.  So-so second act that introduces the gratuitous guest voice and expands on the plot.
3.  Hit or miss third act that either veers completely away from the general plot or takes the premise to an absurd level.  Depending on the execution and one's personal tastes, this makes the episode either decent or awful.

Individual episodes deviate from this at times, but for the most part they stick fairly religiously to it.  Did I say the guest voices are gratuitous?  The stories should not be notable mainly because of the guest voice.  This season leads off with The Who episode (which the commentary reveals doesn't feature the entire group, even as it existed then), a symbol of what's to come.

That said, I still give this 4 stars because of the mostly great first acts, which this period of the show elevates to an art form.  The best ones have almost nothing to do with the direction of the rest of the episode but are loaded with great gags, like the trip to the Festival of Books in ""Insane Clown Poppy.""

Some of the third acts are brilliant, too, like The Prisoner homage in ""The Computer Wore Menace Shoes,"" or the mob family gathering Homer & Krusty invade in ""Insane Clown Poppy.""

What's largely missing is the emotional core that was so memorable in the first several seasons.  By this point many of the writers, directors, and producers who created and cared about these characters have all have long since moved on to other things.  The commentaries make pretty clear that the 12th season staff just like making Homer appear as dumb and depraved as possible.  ""Homer vs. Dignity"" is a particular low point featuring Homer doing baby talk in a diaper and getting raped by a panda.  When genuine emotional substance is called for, such as Krusty trying to establish a relationship with his previously unknown daughter in ""Insane Clown Poppy,"" no feeling comes through at all.  (Compare it to  ""Like Father, Like Clown,"" where Krusty reconciles with his dad, or the end of ""Lisa's Substitute"" when Homer gets Lisa to laugh with him again.)  In this specific case, part of the problem is Drew Barrymore's generic voice work completely fails to convey the emotion that's animated for her.  In general, though, it reveals that the producers generally seemed to coast through the year.

Still, there are some highlight episodes, like ""Trilogy of Error,"" and ""HOMR,"" and the annual ""Treehouse of Horror"" is a little better than some previous years' Halloween eps.  Even the lesser episodes have great moments.  The animators' commentaries are interesting as they discuss and illustrate on screen certain aspects of drawing the show.  The Comic Book Guy's highlight reel is fun to watch.  There is still plenty to enjoy, even if you maybe won't enjoy it quite as often as the earlier seasons.",1250812800,41,2967,4.816205533596838

Since that is the same as the standard, why not buy the cheaper one?

Also, the inside sleeves are a bit better than season 11 (not as tight and damaging). I still don't like them and I put all the discs in a 4 disc standard size DVD case. That fits perfectly inside the outer sleeve/box. On the shelf you wouldn't know the difference.

Derived from shorts shown on the The Tracey Ullman Show back in 1987, ""The Simpsons"" has broadcast over 441 episodes and has amassed 24 Primetime Emmy Awards, 26 Annie awards and a Peabody Award. And also has received the recognition of being America's longest running sitcom and animated program. Needless to say, the animated series is part of American pop culture and inspired many trends in American culture.

The twelfth season of ""The Simpsons"" features 21 episodes from the 2000-2001 season. And the theme of this DVD box set release is a spin on San Diego Comic-Con but in this case, ""Bi-Mon-Sci-Fi-Con"".

The first things you will notice with the DVD is the box cover feature the Comic Book guy on the front. It's when you open the package, it's one of the coolest six-panel gatefold type of DVD packaging I have ever seen. The artwork features the characters at the Bi-Mon-Sci-Fi-Con and everyone in cosplay. Very cool looking but some DVD collector's may not like how the DVD's are stored inside the gatefold sleeve.

Each DVD also reflects that on the main menus as for example, disc one features people in line at the convention, waiting to get an autograph from Krusty the Clown and other characters. And the menus feature a good amount of animation, so you end up watching those too.

As for the episodes, included are (non-spoiler summaries):

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""The Simpsons"" is presented in full screen 1:33:1.  Picture quality is good but considering the animation was done 8-9 years ago, you will notice that the episodes are fine but the intro and some parts of the special features (like clips of ""The Best of the Comic Book Guy"" which contains older footage look a bit aged.  But for the most part, animation is very good and I spotted to digital artifacts or dust or scratches.

As for audio, ""The Simpsons"" is presented in English 5.1 Dolby Surround, Spanish and French stereo.  The series of course is primarily dialogue-based, so the series takes advantage of the front and center channels.  But dialogue is clear and understandable.

Subtitles are in English and Spanish.

JUDGMENT CALL:

The 12th Season of ""The Simpsons"" was another fantastic season with plenty of hilariously fun episodes.  Although, ""The Simpsons"" has always received criticism especially Executive Producer Matt Scully (during this and last season) from those who wonder how the show can run for so long, I personally feel that the writers and directors have managed to keep the season quite fresh and enjoyable for most of the time.  For the 12th season on DVD, it was great to watch these episodes again and for the most part, watch it with the commentary track.

For me, I truly enjoyed ""Treehouse of Horror XI"", ""A Tale of Two Springfields"", ""Lise the Tree Hugger"", ""HOMR"", ""Worst Episode Ever"", really to many to mention.  Of course, some episodes were very good and some were OK but for the most part, the twelfth season was quite enjoyable and the DVD release I felt was quite awesome!

I have to say that ""The Simpsons"" is one of those DVD releases for each season that you really get your money's worth.  Not only are there a ton of special features, the fact that every episode has a commentary track (which are all fun, hilarious and just enjoyable and informative to listen to) is amazing!  If there was one major surprise, that is on disc 1 for episode 2, there is a deleted scene that has profanity.  So, you may not want to have your kids around during the deleted scene.

As for the DVD release, again I really dig the Comic-Con parody gatefold disc holder but I know that there are people who despise this type of packaging and feel it can damage their disc or they are hard to remove.  Personally, I don't find any problem with it, similar to past releases and I actually enjoy this packaging especially because it is artistic but I know there are some people who don't like it.

But for the most part, there is so much included on ""The Simpsons - The Twelfth Season"" DVD set that if you already have been collecting every season, it's a no-brainer to have this new set in your collection.  Granted, every viewer has their opinion of which season is the best and which is the worst but for me, I've always felt ""The Twelfth Season"" to be hilarious and fun.  And if anything, enjoyable!

""The Simpsons - The Twelfth Season"" is definitely recommended!",1250726400,8,12630,4.835360149672591
3846669,1,B0024FAR52,They actually went with the same horrendous packaging again? You can't even take the dvds out without scratching them. I guess this will be the last season of The Simpsons that I buy.,1250726400,10,183,4.575757575757576
3846670,1,B0024FAR52,"Dear Fox
I Have purchased every series of the simpsons since you have released them and i have wanted to collect them all but you have been really bad in your packaging the last two series its crap. Before was OK  so why go cheap now. Stop or your fans will. I don't want to put a DVD into my player and have it eject, i don't want want to take out of my DVD packet a dvd that is covered in glue. I HAVE BROUGHT TWO COPIES OF SEASON 11 AND THEY WERE BOTH COVERED IN GLUE. THEY WOULDNT PLAY AND IT WASNT RIGHT. PLEASE GO BACK TO YOUR YOUR PREVIOUS BOXES ITS NOT FAIR TO CHEAPEN YOUR PACKAGING ON YOUR LOYAL FANS. YOU HAVE LOTS OF MONEY  WE DONT WE WANT TO BUY OUR SHOW THAT WE LOVE TO WATCH NOT TO EJECT,
 DO SOMETHING THATS RIGHT BY US PLEASE,
  GRAHAM",1250726400,4,752,3.888888888888889
3846671,4,B0024FAR52,"Finally they have released another season of the Simpsons on dvd. If your a huge fan of the show and own the prev. 11 seasons, this one don't disapoint. Tho the packaging is slightly alittle better then season 11, the disc do have the chance of getting scratched if your trying to remove them. Do yourself a favor and buy a dvd case the holds four disc to keep them in good shape.",1250726400,,380,4.219178082191781
3846672,5,B0024FAR52,"I won't go in depth here about the episodes in this season... anyone who's picking up the DVD set knows about these already. I will say the special edition head box is a lot better than last season. While it's not as easy to get them out of the sleeve as if they were in plastic holders, they made the cardboard dividers in between each disc a lot thicker and somehow that lets the DVD's slide out a LOT easier than with season 11. One disc in last season's set was nearly impossible to get out, but it's not so bad this time around.",1250640000,7,533,4.134615384615385
3846673,1,B0024FAR52,"I like the Simpsons, but I was not prepared for the F-bomb on episode two of disc one!!! I was watching this with my eleven year old daughter, and we played the deleted scenes and imagine my complete shock when Roger Daltry of the Who uses the F-bomb right on the soundtrack. I know the Simpson's have pushed the boundries of acceptable language on their show, but this was completely out of line. I am angry that my daughter was exposed to this word. This is the last season I will buy of the show.",1250553600,4,499,4.2631578947368425
3846674,1,B0024FAR52,"Obviously a wonderful show. My rating is for the product.

The packaging seriously makes me want to cry. If you don't own the rest of the seasons to date, this may not apply to you.

First of all, the box opens with a flap that should be tucked in to close it. Last time I checked, paperboard was not a good material to use for a reusable latch. The back of the box gapes open because of this, and does not look very collectible at all.

Also, they used the accordion-style paperboard sleeve system to hold the DVD's even though it clearly did not go over well with the fans after they used this method on season 11. The discs are very difficult to remove.

...Oh, also, it's a great season of a great show. Make sure to own it. But make sure to buy ALL the seasons as they are trickled out slowly by fox, and THEN, years from now when all of your individual box sets are damaged and crummy looking, buy the 20 some season mega box set after the series has ended. I think this works out well for everyone: You, me, and 20th Century Fox.",1250553600,8,1036,4.165
3846675,4,B0024FAR52,"***About the packaging: same accordion-style packaging as before, but the DVDs are much easier to get out.  There is a bit cut out of each holder that allows you to grasp the DVD without ripping into the packaging, and they are not as tight so they slide out much easier.  I still might put the discs in protective sleeves like I did for the last season, but I think they did at least try to better the situation.

Season 12 contains such great episodes as Treehouse of Horror XI, HOMR, and Trilogy of Error.  Can't beat Homer's near-acceptance into heaven, his brief stretch of brilliance after getting a crayon removed from his brain, and a plot that makes no sense (TELL THE PEOPLE!) told from three different points of view.  There's also Biclops, another Sideshow Bob episode, and the tall tales of Paul Bunyan, Connie Appleseed, and Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn.  And then there are a lot of others that I haven't seen in a long time that I'm looking forward to seeing again.

Certainly not the ""Worst...Season...Ever"", happy to add it to the (for now) complete collection.",1250553600,3,1075,4.656084656084656
3846676,3,B0024FAR52,"Fox learned nothing from the release of season 11. After all the critizism received for the awful packaging for season 11, Fox did the same thing again for season 12!!!

3846677,1,B0024FAR52,"Once again FOX took the easy way out and put out awful packaging. At this point the only people buying these seasons are the hardcore fans that have been collecting since Season 1 so why not give us what we want??? These DVD's are collectors editions so that we can always have any episode at our disposal whenever we want and to put them in scratchy cardboard flimsy packaging is a disgrace!!

3846680,3,B0024FAR52,"As most fans know, the show's been going downhill since season 8, but this season has some good episodes. Trilogy of Error,HOMR,A Tale of Two Springfields, and a few more. The rest are pretty average, with a few bummer episodes that aren't even entertaining to watch. The packaging of this season could be an issue, though. FOX has heard the complaints about season 11's crappy packaging and hopefully they'll fix it. If they don't fix it, be prepared for scratched discs. (All you need to do to fix this packaging issue is put the discs in those little plastic DVD sleeves. They fit in the box and prevent scratching.)Even if you stop the disc from scratching, the accordian-style inside box is clumsy and cheap. If you're a fan and are trying to complete your collection, get it. If you're just looking for a really good season of the Simpsons, try getting season 4-8. (In my opinion, the best seasons)Its your call if you really want this or not...",1247356800,,951,4.666666666666667
3846681,4,B0024FAR52,"I know I am not alone when it comes to the way season 11 and probably season 12 will be packaged. In those almost immpossible sleeves the discs are crammed into. Once out of that tight fitting slot, just use some of those two sided sleeves or envelopes you get at office depot. They fit back in between the accordian type booklet just fine. It's a quick low cost solution to the problem. Just thought i'd share that with everybody.",1246320000,49,431,4.4

Its because after so many years on the air, the characters don't have the same impact as they did when they premered. There still as funny as ever but people get board and they start looking for the next big show.
I still laugh up a storm when I watch the show. Yes there are some episodes that are not as good as the rest, but all the early seasons had the same amount of off shows. It's just people want to hold on to the episodes they rememberd as a kid so they feel young.",1246147200,3,628,4.07258064516129

3846685,3,B0024FAR52,"It's no surprise to any fan of The Simpsons or even the casual viewer that the show has declined tremendously over the last few seasons and gets worse with each episode. Not only are the Simpsons episodes today out of touch and sterile they have no heart. Personally, I blame Al Jean. Many fans want to place blame on Scully who took over come season 9 up until 12, which yes, I agree, the Simpsons lost much of it's groundings in reality as well as its heart under Scully's leadership but nonetheless, the episodes have their shining moments and humor and the characters are all intact.

It isn't until season 13 to now under the leadership of Al Jean where the characters have been sold out and diminished to one-dimensional caricatures. There are some stand-out episodes left here in the 12th season that I've been waiting to add to my collection but in comparison to the 13, there is only two episodes in season 13 I would actually want to sit through again.

Al Jean has run the show into the ground and imo is a bigger crook than Madoff and ought be exiled from Hollywood. The Simpsons today, thanks to Al Jean, is nothing more than a watered down version of Family Guy which is sad as FG is really not any better (FG was good before it was yanked off the air).

Season 12 is the final boxset I will be purchasing as I cannot reward the show for Al Jeans heinous disregard for the integrity of what isn't just a show but an American family icon.

Hopefully this boxset will be less destructive to the DVDs than 11.",1243468800,18,1520,4.398576512455516
