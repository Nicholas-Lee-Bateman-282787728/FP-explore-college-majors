After seeing this, I realized how many of my favorite films such as ""A Handful of Dust"" concern loss.",1316649600,2,201,4.611111111111111
2657469,4,B000II674M,"... and this is a Norwegian film with all the ""sorg"" any appreciator of dark films could ask for. The darkness is all framed by the whiteness of a Norwegian winter, so that one is compelled to wonder whether Winter isn't the protagonist. The snowplow driver Kai, who becomes both the murder suspect and the lover in this film, says jokingly ""Gud er en god fyr -- God is a good guy"", but Victoria, the Oslo doctor who has fled to the back country of Norway to escape her 'sorg' and 'skyldflelse' (guilt), thinks otherwise. ""God is simply mean,"" she says, though what she really thinks is that Life is mean. This is, on some level, a film about being Norwegian (or Swedish) and therefore kissed by 'sorg' and 'skyldflelse'. Are 'bleak and 'beautiful' compatible adjectives? They'd better be, if you want to appreciate this film.

Victoria is played by Annika Hallin, whose face is wonderfully bleak and beautiful. It's the acting that makes this movie poignant. Kristoffer Joner, in the role of Kai, is beautifully boyish and bleakly needy - a man whose wife has deserted him in the back country and taken his daughter to the city. The cinematography is beautiful; well of course! it's a Scandinavian flick, though neither as introverted nor as subtle as a classic Ingmar Bergman drama of bleak passion. Indeed, the whole film is well crafted, edited, acted, scripted. It falls short of five-star artistry only in one odd implausibility. The doctor mother fails to detect her son's leukemia; she misreads his lethargy as a moral weakness, a failure of energy for life. She drags him from his TV and his couch, with tragic results. Yeah yeah, it's in the script, it's the motivation for her flight to the snowfields, but I didn't 'buy' it and neither did my wife when we watched it together.

There's also a sub plot. The young man who is found frozen in the snow, whose death is blamed on Kai, is a Muslim refugee, living with his parents in a camp for refugees. The portrayals of the his Muslim parents is credible and not unsympathetic. The Norwegians of the countryside are likewise not unsympathetic -- bleakly generous, you might say -- but it's quite obvious that the refugees have no actuality for them. They are not people of the winter whiteness. Despite the recent anti-Muslim terrorist murder spree in Norway, this depiction of the bleak reserve between Norwegians (and Swedes)  -- the dutiful tolerance on one side and the grudging dependence on the other -- seems to me to be precisely realistic.",1315526400,21,2507,4.758620689655173
2657470,4,B000II674M,"I happened to pick this movie up the other day at the foreign movie section of my local public library here in Blue Ash, OH. I really didn't know anything about this movie, but looked at the box and was intruiged. Am I glad I picked this up!

""Kissed By Winter"" (80 min.; originally released in 2008 in Norway) brings several concurrent story lines: the first one is that a body of a teenage boy is found in the snow, and it's left up to the local police to figure out what happened (and who might be responsible for it). The teenager is from a Muslim family living in Norway. The second story line is of a local female doctor Victoria, who makes the rounds visiting patients in the country side and at the local hospital. She gets involved with a guy, Kai, responsible for clearing the roads of snow and who is a suspect in the death of the teenager. But wait, there is more! As the movie goes on, it becomes apparent Victoria carries a heavy secret. I don't want to say much more about the story line, you'll just have to see it for yourself.

The movie plays beautifully and really comes together in the last half hour, when all is revealed. Just great. In all, yet another great foreign movie I've enjoyed tremendously. It puts the mainstream Hollywood movies to shame, frankly, as it seems that Hollywood can do no better than to come up with the next Iron Man or Pirates of the Carribean sequel. Meanwhile ""Kissed By Winter"" is highly recommended!",1303948800,31,1453,4.438202247191011
2657471,5,B000II674M,"I loved this film!

No other AMAZON customers have ""reviewed"" this film.  So, this is my wholehearted endorsement of this gem - to hopefully draw attention to the pleasures this film offers.

The Scandinavian setting was a definite attraction.  The plot is unique and interesting.  However, the lead actress is what makes the film.  The film is otherwise well-cast, with cast members who are refreshingly new.  Indeed, the entire film is refreshing - as being NON-Hollywood.

The lead actress's performance is fascinating, captivating.  I was spellbound by her.  This actress's expressions often seemed so stern and inscrutable, yet she has a smile that could melt the North Pole.

I discovered this film by accident, in an idle moment, when I searched AMAZON.com for Scandinavian films of interest.  This film seemed problematical, but was recommended, so I purchased it on a lark.  I hit the jackpot.  I have viewed this film several times already, and expect to view it again from time to time.",1295654400,25,997,5.03680981595092

It's been a while, so I'm considering a fourth go round.  A friend of mine has the DVD as well, and we both agreed it takes time to grow on you.",1438214400,3,305,3.6615384615384614

8145568,4,B000II674M,"Beautiful film, unfolding slowly as there is more than one story.  It's beautifully layered and very true to the emotions that would be evoked by what has happened, and what is happening now.  The mysteries of the human heart are not easily said, or measured, but as this film reaches its denoument, there can be no other explanation for the sorrows and ecstacies that lift us than the capacity for a deep love and a real connection.",1422316800,3,433,4.6103896103896105

8145573,5,B000II674M,"This is one of many Scandinavian films that I've purchased in the last few months.  As with almost all of them, this movie is built on a strong, interesting and provocative screenplay.  Also, so many of the Scandinavian film actors are exceptional without being over the top.  They occur in the movie as real people that the average movie viewer could imagine in their lives.  It is also a great way to learn a bit out the current social concerns in Sweden regarding immigrants.",1356307200,6,478,4.654761904761905

You get to see other cultures and there are some really great story lines...and surprisingly many of the foreign movies Ive watched are really well produced and directed.  This movie wasn't too bad but really not the greatest either.  It was ok.,1344902400,,297,4.653846153846154
