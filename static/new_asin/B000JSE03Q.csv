2679039,5,B000JSE03Q,"This DVD gives practical instruction to men on how to lead properly. We especially liked the ""hustle"" segment. We busted out our salsa skills at my high school reunion and really impressed my classmates!",1164153600,6,203,5.0
8152891,4,B000JSE03Q,Instructions re great as always.  Just wish each dance had a longer instruction time with a couple more  moves.  Have purchased other DVD dance instructions by Shawn Truman and are very pleased.  Will stay with this Dance instructor for sure!,1462752000,,242,4.975
8152892,5,B000JSE03Q,Very clear instructions and easy to follow.,1447027200,,43,5.285714285714286
8152893,4,B000JSE03Q,"I like Shawn Trautman's dance-instruction videos very much, but it gets expensive to buy all of the pieces that you must study to have confidence in the ballroom setting. My motive in buying the sampler DVD (and I have several of his other samplers) was to show my father what the Cha Cha, Salsa and Tango looked like. (Dad protested that he could already do the Foxtrot and I did not expect him to get much use from the Hustle steps -- because it is a fairly complex dance with many different steps.) We decided to concentrate on three dances: a slow-tempo [rumba], medium-tempo [cha cha] and fast-tempo dance [Salsa]. The product is introductory and does not teach many steps since the DVD is 77 minutes long, there are five dances to showcase and there is generic introductory material that eats up bandwidth.",1358208000,,812,4.685314685314685
8152894,2,B000JSE03Q,The instructors do not teach the dance steps except by dancing themselves which is difficult to follow.  We were only able to follow a few of the steps after many rewinds.  The small amount of verbal instrucion is not clear and just as difficult to follow.  The photo shots from the waist up are not very helpful for learning to dance.  I do not plan to buy any more of their dance videos.  There are others on the market that are much better.,1279411200,,443,4.289156626506024
8152895,5,B000JSE03Q,"This DVD creates a nice foundation. Shawn teaches the moves clearly and slowly, giving the lead just enough information without confusing him. Although, I would have liked to see more tips for the follow. The pace was also nice, not overwhelming but not boring. The variety of dances made for an interesting and diverse dance DVD.",1165276800,9,330,4.910714285714286
8152896,5,B000JSE03Q,THIS IS AN EXCELLENT VIDEO IF YOU WANT TO START BALLROOM DANCING. THERE ARE ENOUGH STEPS IN EACH OF THE DIFFERENT BALLROOM DANCES THAT WITH A LITTLE BIT OF PRACTICE ONE CAN VENTURE TO THE DANCE FLOOR WITHOUT GETTING UNCOMFORTABLE DOING IT. THE BASIC STEPS ARE EASY TO LEARN AND REMEMBER. JUST GET YOUR MIND INTO IT AND START DANCING.,1165276800,4,333,4.566666666666666
8152897,5,B000JSE03Q,"My wife and I are new to ballroom dancing in the last year.  We've taken some lessons, but found that we needed the extra help of videos that we can use on our own schedule in our home and we've tried a bunch of them.  This DVD and the whole series of new videos from Shawn Trautman have been a godsend and much more useful to us than the others we've tried.  We are actually doing the dances within a short time and having fun, rather than getting aggravated with one another.  Trautman's emphasis on the differing roles of leader and follower and the very clear demonstrations of those roles have helped us enormously.  These DVDs include much more music and time to practice the new steps than most videos, rather than just watching an instructor do a step and go to another step.  We like this video a lot and strongly recommend it.  On a side note, the logistics/timing of shipping and subsequent email communications with the company were, after many frustrations with other online outfits, the best we've seen.",1165276800,10,1017,4.585635359116022
8152898,5,B000JSE03Q,"My favorite thing about Shawn Trautman's DVD's is the instruction provided individually for the leaders and the followers, so that each person learns what they should be doing.  The camera angles are great too.  This particular DVD has a lot of great variety (salsa, cha-cha, tango, etc).",1165104000,8,288,5.1063829787234045
8152899,5,B000JSE03Q,"Before this DVD I didn't realize there are so many common elements in different dances.  Little things like how to hold your hands and where to place your hands can be used in more than one dance.  I had no idea how important those little things could be, or how easy they can be to master.  This is a good starting point for any beginner.",1164672000,6,339,4.184615384615385
8152900,5,B000JSE03Q,"This lesson is definitely worth taking!  It's a private lesson that you can take and repeat anytime. I really enjoyed the variety of dances taught in this Ballroom & Latin dance sampler.  While all of the dances are fun to learn and practice, the Tango steps were particularly fun for me and my partner!",1164499200,8,303,4.592592592592593
