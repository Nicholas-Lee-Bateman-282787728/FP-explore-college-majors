8623705,5,B00GJ2WLVO,"I deeply admire Dr. Truman Madsen, and knew of him as a teacher at Brigham Young University in Utah.
This series contains excellent video of important locations pertaining to history of Joseph Smith.  Dr. Madsen
is shown in the video and does a great job with the commentary.  Now that he has passed away, this has become
more priceless to me.  It arrived in perfect condition.",1469145600,,377,4.681818181818182

8623707,5,B00GJ2WLVO,"I am LDS, so I already love sincere appraisal of the Prophet Joseph Smith.  This is a masterful work.  I have watched it many times.  My baby son loves it too....falls asleep to the music and pleasant voice of Truman Madsen.",1398729600,,224,4.414634146341464
8623708,5,B00GJ2WLVO,"I listen to Truman G. Madsen regularly and I love his teachings.  This DVD is not far behind ""The Eternal Christ"" in valuable and life changing content.  I consider ""The Eternal Christ"" Madsen's magnum opus and the analysis in ""On Sacred Ground"" of the modern day restoration is almost as informative and enlightening.  Madsen's depth of knowledge and inspired commentary on the early movements and lives of the Prophet Joseph Smith and the early Latter-Day Saints is comprehensive and meaningful.  I highly recommend this great work of commentary and cinematography.",1391126400,,567,5.266666666666667
