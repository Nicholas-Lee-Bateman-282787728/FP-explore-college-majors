8352124,5,B00266G834,If you have not had the chance to see Pie in the Sky yet then don't hesitate for another minute. This is a wonderful series with characters that catch your imagination and take you with them on the journey. After seeing series one I bought the box set and just love it!,1300320000,2,269,4.1923076923076925
8352125,5,B00266G834,"Who doesn't like Richard Griffiths? Or, for that matter, food? I certainly like both.

This is wonderful British mystery ""light"" by any standards. I actually purchased a multi-region DVD player so I could buy the whole series from Amazon.co.uk. (Series 2 is finally making an appearance here in the States).

Wonderful performances. Great scenery and sumptuous food. Bella Enahola is particularly good and was sorry when she left the series half-way through. My only quibble is that there is no interview with Richard Griffiths.  Does anybody know why?

8352126,5,B00266G834,Had to be sure it would play on dvd recorders in Oz. A lot of the other shows I'm after (two and a half men series 5 and 6) no t sure will play and I don't fully understand the different systems. I would hate to buy only to find it didn't work. Never too sure what to expect but this was a great buy.,1257638400,2,300,3.6307692307692307
