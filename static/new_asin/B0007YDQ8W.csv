8588341,5,B0007YDQ8W,"A very balanced, but not particularly in-depth, piece on the P-40.  It does its best to portray the P-40 in a good light.  It doesn't delve deeply into its use in the European theater where it got hammered by superior German aircraft.  It spends more time looking at its successful use in north Africa and in the China theater where it was used very effectively by the Flying Tigers under General Claire Chennault against Japanese aircraft who were never able to achieve air superiority primarily because of the men who flew this aircraft.  It mentions the controversy about the plane's politics, but doesn't go into the details.  It's one of my favorite 'war birds' documentaries.",1347235200,,681,4.886956521739131
