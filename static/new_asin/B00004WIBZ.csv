1364763,5,B00004WIBZ,"We finally put some of those digital credits to use and got this for my son that LOVES Blues Clues, and he loves this even more than the episodes! This is a super cute movie about the characters putting on a musical show for all of their friends and neighbors. Everyone in the house has a special talent that they want to display, and then there are a couple characters that are either too shy to speak up, or just aren't being taken seriously about wanting to be in the show too. They are eventually heard and get to be a part of it, don't worry. :) This has quite a bit of really cute little jingles and songs, but it also has all your favorite characters in it doing all sorts of cute stuff. I think this has been on repeat since we got it a couple days ago. This is a BIG hit!",1467504000,2,780,4.038709677419355

1364852,5,B00004WIBZ,"When I say I love it that's debatable. My teenager grew up with Blue's Clues so when we had our second years later we purchased a few Blues Clues for our toddler and he loves this movie. Sings pieces of it almost daily even when we haven't watched it for a month (I limit viewing in an attempt to maintain my sanity). It is a good movie and I do love listening to him sing ""Don't give up"". I will also admit I don't really know about different musical terms but I now understand the difference between tempo and rhythm ect.",1435881600,,523,4.188118811881188
1364870,5,B00004WIBZ,"I adore this movie - the show impressed me as a parent but this movie charmed me utterly. My nephew watched it, enthralled, and clapped along with each song. Even my sixteen year old son watched it, even though he wore out a VHS copy of it when he was a preschooler! It's excellently crafted, the music is spot on perfect for both its audience and its characters, and the drama of the plot is really well done.
Some folks might be uncertain about the ""sad"" parts of the show. I am not, and here is why. Yes there is a dramatic arc - there is ""conflict"" and several characters show sadness, even weep. However they all model appropriate responses and coping - social skills that are increasingly lacking. The character work together, show empathy for one another, and use their words to express themselves without harming others. Excellent, excellent lessons for any young child to learn.
But, to be honest, I myself still sing along with most of the songs, especially the blues passages!",1435363200,4,987,4.645714285714286

1364979,5,B00004WIBZ,"Both my daughters greatly loved this charming and sweet film in which Blue, Steve and all their friends are preparing a big musical show. Periwinkle and Side Table Drawer play particularly important roles, but all the gang is here: Mailbox, Mrs Salt, Mr Pepper, Paprika, Slippery Soap, Shovel, Pail, Tickety Tock, Magenta and even the Purple Kangaroo.

A particularly great moment is the explanation of how to compose a song, made by G-Clef the Keyboard, who speaks and sings with voice of Ray Charles and by Notes, who are voices by the a capella group The Persuasions.

There is humor, there is emotion and there is of course a very happy ending with a great singing finale. A wonderful film for little kids. Enjoy!",1357603200,,717,4.774193548387097

It is very entertaining and has a lot of re-playabilitly, even for parents. It is definitely great for those rainy days when they are bored. They really like the segment with G clef.

The songs are very catchy and not hard to listen to.  Ray Charles even makes a guest appearence as G clef. The only reason I reluctantly gave this all Steve DVD movie is because of the length. Its great in the car but at home my son gets bored with it about a half hour through.

1365023,2,B00004WIBZ,"We have the movie, but we got it after someone gave us the score. The movie is ok, whatever, but disappointing after listening to the music and envisioning Blue's Big BROADWAY! Musical, not a boring old Blue's Clues episode.

You know that little clip where they sing ""Steve's got a silly hat""? That's a whole Samba number. ""Why don't I ever find a clue like you...""? That part? The awesome-est bossanova. Every tiny clip in the movie is a full-on fabulous song. And some aren't even in the movie. ""The magic of Theater"" is especially fantastic. And the star of the show is Aleisha Allen as Sidetable Drawer -- she has two solo numbers and that girl can SING!

Apparently the score is out of print. That is a tragedy, truly, because the music that Steve Burns and those kids made is really exceptional. I don't know who wrote the score and did the arrangements (because we've long since lost the cover art) but they are as sophisticated and listenable as the best of musical soundtracks. I'm ripping our copy to iTunes right now because eventually the cd will be unplayable and my four year old would cry and cry if we didn't have another copy.

With all the resources they had at their disposal and all the kids tuned in to see Blue teaching them about music, it saddens me that this is the best they came up with.  My kids learned tons about music from the far lower-budget Trebellina DVD, which they love.  Alas, I fear nothing will compare to that.",1234310400,,447,4.481481481481482

This is a fantastic movie which involves the regular problem solving part seen in espisodes and much more. Steve and the gang are putting together a show for the neigborhood and they need to get ready for it. Blue needs a singing partner so we play blue's clues to figure out who it should be. Side Table is too shy to say she wants to sing in the show as well and that part of the story is very well portrayed. There are many practical lessons for kids in this about not giving up, how being shy can prevent you from doing what you really want to do, etc. My favorite part is when Steve is trying to make his song and they explain notes, tempo, etc. Very well done!",1202774400,,806,4.0375

On the two aforementenioned children's movies, the colors are washed out like most adult films and my daughter loses interest quickly (15 minutes tops). In this Blues Clues movie, the colors and resolution are exactly the same as the 1/2 hour television show. Therefore, she watches the entire movie from beginning to end. She finds it captivating and I thoroughly enjoy it as well. I play guitar so I appreciate the ""how to write a song"" segment. The lessons taught in this movie (""don't give up"", ""song maker upper"" and ""team work"") are all done very well.

Blues clues is the ONLY thing my son will sit through, begin to end without going to do something else, which is very handy while I'm in the shower or cooking dinner.  This episode especially grabs his attention.  He's right up there singing and dancing with Steve and all his friends, he gets VERY upset when Side Table Drawer and Perriwinkle get sad and upset.  There is a part in the movie where your children sing along as part of the backyard musical show (a song they learned from G clef, voiced by the late Ray charles)  which he loves to sing along with.

I decided to order this anyway, and since it arrived three days ago, we've been watching it at least three times a day.  Good music, good story line, good acting.  And because of the extended story line, we can even have a little discussion about what the various characters are feeling.

1365143,2,B00004WIBZ,"Blue's Clues (with Steve) is my 3 year old daughter's favorite show.  We were very excited when the DVD finally arrived and we sat down all together to watch the movie.  Unfortunately, all the way through the movie there were very annoying interferences due to manufacturer's disc defects.  The DVD signal would disappear throughout the movie and a regular TV program would come on for 1-2 minutes instead.  The most unfortunate moment was in the end, when Steve finally lands on his thinking chair with all 3 clues in his hands.  The whole episode was erased from the DVD. We returned the DVD back (...) and received a replacement - the same story!! And the same spots on DVD were damaged.  Desperate and determined to show my daughter the whole movie, I finally purchased a copy from our local video store.  Guess what... it was damaged in the same very spots as the two previous bad copies (...)!  I exchanged it again -- and received another bad copy with the same exact damage!!!
However, to give credit to the movie creators, my daughter still was watching it at least 2-3 times daily, this is how much she loved whatever she could see.

We received an apology (...) and advice from the local video store to contact the manufacturer directly for a good copy.  (...)
Maybe the movie itself deserves a much better rating, but when you are unable to watch it without constant interruptions, natural frustration takes over and there is no enjoyment and no point in bothering to put it on. What a waste of time and money.",1066262400,2,1522,4.62453531598513

It's also nice to have a long BC video for her to watch. Some of the character voives aren't the same ones from the TV show, but she can't tell.  Also Steve Burns gets to show off more of his wonderful musical talent (He has an album out now, by the way). I need to get a new one though because it was used so much the tape is broken now.

The chapter stops on the DVD make it easy to forward to a particular favorite scene, and allows you to break up the 1-hour show into more manageable chunks so you can limit the amount of viewing time. My only wish is that they would have done the story in such a way that there was a logical break at the 20-minute or 30-minute mark to match the running time of the regular show.
G-clef is probably the highlight of the show for younger kids, but the underlying themes of ""being anything you want to be"" and helping out a friend in need should strike a chord with older kids as well.",1052784000,,670,4.2015503875969

If anyone who use HTPC for some more quality out from this, and use some more features from the disk, it would fail to achive what you intended...

Not only do I find Blue's Big Musical non-irritating, I catch myself singing the tunes to myself -- especially Steve's Got a Silly Hat, and  Putting It Together.  In plot summary, Blue and Steve have a lot to do before they can put on their backyard show for the neighbors. (Shades of the Little Rascals.)  Along the way, they have to find a new singing partner for Blue, make up a song, find a part for Side Table (who is too shy to tell them what she really wants to do), and include Periwinkle (who misheard and thought it was going to be a magic show.)  Steve spends some time reflecting sadly on how he never finds the clues first, and why he's just not as good at finding clues as You (the audience.)  But don't worry -- he'll get his chance before the end.
In addition, the DVD includes a wonderful separate segment on the making of Blue's Clues.  Parents will enjoy hearing Steve Burns talk like an intelligent adult for a change, and kids who are old enough to understand will enjoy learning who speaks the parts of the different characters.
In conclusion -- you can't go wrong with this DVD.  Great themes, great songs for kids and yes, adults.  Who among us doesn't need a reminder now again: When Things Go Wrong, Don't Give Up -- Just Go On!",1018224000,7,1374,4.356862745098039

1365186,5,B00004WIBZ,"Steve, Blue and their friends are putting on a show -- but where is Steve?  He's in bed, still sleeping!  Thus begins the day of the Big Musical -- an expanded 78-minute show in which Steve finds three clues that let him know who Blue wants as a singing partner, Periwinkle gets frustrated trying to audition for the show, and bashful Sidetable Drawer struggles to overcome her shyness so she can join the cast, among other ongoing activities on the first DVD release from the Blue's Clues team.

Our two-year old, amazingly, sat through the entire movie -- even the relatively lengthy visit with G-Clef and the notes (played winningly by Ray Charles and the Persuasions) as they discussed the composition of a song using notes, rhythm, tempo and, of course, soul.

DVD extras: two music videos: 'I Can Be Anything That I Want To Be' and 'There It Is'; 'Who Am I?', a game to try and guess Blue's Clues characters given three clues; two DVD-ROM games; and a wonderful 16 minute backstage tour, meeting the talented team behind this great show.

I thought about giving this disk 4 stars -- my PowerMac met all the system requirements for playing the two DVD games, but still they wouldn't run -- however, the movie is so good and the backstage tour so interesting that I couldn't bring myself to give this product anything less than a 5 star rating.

1365189,5,B00004WIBZ,"This was SUCH a great purchase, and a must-have for any Blues fans!  It is longer than the regular shows, and the first couple times we watched it with our now 2 yr old daughter, we inserted an ""intermission"".  Don't need to do that anymore.  My husband and I are both musicians, and we love the bluesy/jazzy/big band style music (we even got the soundtrack cassette for the car--what a tantrum squelcher!).
I STRONGLY disagree with a previous reviewer about the Ray Charles segment--no one in our family finds it ""boring"" to learn about the musical elements of notes, rhythm, tempo, harmony.  Granted, I'm a music teacher--but my daughter is just an average 2 yr old and she enjoys it.  And as a teacher, I think it's a great mini-music lesson!
Another little lesson woven into the fabric of this movie is the concept of making ""to-do"" lists, so everything gets done, and we don't forget about anything.  This is just a little nugget of learning organization and priorities.
This movie also teaches that even though you may have a mishap onstage--keep going--your friends are there to support you.  And it happens to everyone.  This is great for young kids to know when preparing for their school programs and pageants.
Of course, there is a game of Blues Clues within the show--Blue's duet partner, Tickety loses her voice, and we need to figure out who should take her place.  Poor Steve, all he wants to do is find a clue himself!
As you can see, we found LOTS of redeeming qualities (educational and entertainment) in this video.  I highly recommend it!",1001635200,8,1558,4.715867158671586

""Everyone has a good time with Blue. Steve always does something fun and you learn something too."" It inspired kids to plan a show, starting with a checklist.

1365191,5,B00004WIBZ,"My 3 year old got this VHS video as a gift about six months ago, and it is still his favorite (he has an extensive collection -- for a 3 year old).
Well, this video is entertaining, even to adults. The plot has been explained by others, and the characters (especially Periwinkle, the kitten) are cute. The lessons are worthy, for example, dealing with disappointment. It merits five stars on that basis alone.
What's a bonus is that this video has helped to develop my son's music appreciation. He sings with all the songs, and he loves the Ray Charles as G-Clef interlude where G-Clef explains short and long notes, notes and rests (where kids are encouraged to clap), and tempo (where they act as slow or fast trains). My son now can recognize the classic ""Kansas City"" bass line from the number ""Together"" when he hears it in Buddy Guy or Lonnie Brooks numbers now. (I should mention that I now play it on my bass a lot, since he likes it, and it is a good ""swing"" exercise). In short, this video, which is about putting on a musical show, is making my son more of a ""musician"" per se. Blue's clues has always had interesting musical elements: the bass lines or guitar riffs or horn figures during the drawing of the clues and the ""thinking chair"" episodes, the songs, the sounds. This develops that even more. It has been said that exposure to music encourages kids to think (the Mozart effect). Waste no time if you have a 2 to 4 year old who likes Blue's Clues, or music, or both, and buy this video.",999043200,3,1506,4.420863309352518

There is so much action and singing that it totally keeps her attention for the entire video!  Unbelievable!  She even tries to sing and clap along with it.  She even loves the music intensive section another reviewer mentioned.  She is riveted to the t.v. the entire time.  Another reviewer also mentioned that there was ""too much"" music and singing in the video.  Maybe they didn't realize it when they bought it, but it does say ""Big Musical"", and all the MUSICALS I've ever seen have lots of uh.....MUSIC and singing.
