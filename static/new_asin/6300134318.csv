208828,5,6300134318,"This film is an absolute MASTERPIECE of the art of film by the director of Zorba.  Cacoyannis has captured the essence of the Greek tragic drama and has brought it to the twentieth century audience (now also 21st century).  In an age where the film maker is drawing on ever lower common denominators of western experience in formulaic storylines and familiar characters and in comic books and fairy tales, it is a rare pleasure to see a masterpiece of literature handled in so clever a manner.",1342310400,,493,4.72093023255814
208829,5,6300134318,"How should I interpret the movie? It's a tragedy, but every tragedy originates in some sort of conflict, or conflict of interests to be specific. The cinematography is so good! The director took me all the way back to the Greek era--even someone like me who had not original bond with Greco-Roman culture (I am originally from a different cultural milieu), I had no problem feeling the universal human pathos expressed in the movie. Those who already know Irene Pappas, know that she did a superb acting in the show. The cast were simply optimum in their performance, even the little kid, who played Orestus. We saw politics, paternal love, greed, devotion, loyalty, desire to be alive, feminist appeal, male stupidity that has been our species curse since the dawn of mankind, and helplessness of mortals in the face of necessity--rightful or not.
It's a myth turned reality on celluloid. Watch it, you will like it.",1313798400,,917,4.884615384615385
208830,5,6300134318,"Better minds than mine have already masterfully critiqued IPHIGENIA on Amazon, so I'll be brief & list the 3 main reasons I voted 5 Stars.

1. The acting is brilliant, moving & perfect.

2. Actor, script & director produces a classic movie moment in the scene where Irene Papas as Clytemnestra rails against her daughter's cruel fate & her husband Agamemnon's  complicity in it. No one could have played it better, with sug depth of desperation & outrage. It reminded me of the opening of A DREAM OF PASSION where Melina Mercouri reprises her role of Medea originally played in the Greek Amphitheatre. A woman powerful--and dangerous. Medea uses her children for revenge against her faithless husband, Clytemnestra will eventually go on to committ a very bloody murder of a different nature in order to avenge her child's death (but this happens in another play.)

NOTE: Playwright Euripides (ca. 480 BC - 406 BC) was reknown for his sympathetic treatment of women in his works & he authored both MEDEA AND, of course, IPHIGENIA. Each play confronts patriarchy (Hellenic culture was a prime example.) Euripides was surprisingly frank--even devastating--in his critique of male dominance at the expense of women. It is a compliment to the Athenians that their society  was ""liberal"" enough to accept both plays as true works of art.

MEDEA was the least popular of the two, but nonetheless won 3rd Place in the annual Greater Dionysia, a religiously important & prestigious drama festival that was presented over the course of several days. The festival was free to the public & produced as an act of civic pride. My, how times have changed...

3. The final scene where Iphigenia goes to meet her fate. There is a frightening authenticity to it's suggestion of Mystery & Death.

If you're building an archive, then IPHIGENIA will do it proud.

208831,5,6300134318,"Whether to give up war and glory or to put on the ""yoke of necessity"" and sacrifice his first-born daughter; this is Agamemnon's dilemma in Euripides' ""Iphigenia""; and the playwright's ancient Greek audience, well-aware of his choice and the blood-guilt that will continue to rain down upon the accursed House of Atreus, will have been filled with pity at Iphigenia's plight. And modern viewers of Michael Cocoyannis' ""Iphigenia"" will find it equally difficult to suppress tears, which are guaranteed to spill down one's cheeks, not from any cinematic manipulation of musical score or special effects, but from the stunning performances of the actors.

Costas Kazakos depicts a self-centered Agamemnon; his tears for his daughter are not quite of the crocodilian species, but he knows where his priorities lie. Irene Papas' portrayal ranges from the happy loving mother--confident that her daughter is going to marry the handsome hero, Achilles--to the wounded tragic heroine, whom we see 'learning through suffering' before our very eyes. At the end she is the portrait of vengeance-to-come, as she stands alone on a hill, black garments billowing, watching the departing fleet. Then, in an amazing camera shot, we watch the fleet ourselves, through Clytemnestra's wind-blown black hair (And after Euripides' tragedy, a prequel, as it were, to Aeschylus' ""Agamemnon,"" the viewer will be inclined to acquit her of all future crimes on the grounds of justifiable homicide.). Tatiana Papamoskou is pitch-perfect in her understated performance as Iphigenia. Her attractiveness suggests a slightly androgynous Athenian statue of Artemis, to whom she is sacrificed. One can easily imagine a boy playing the part, as would have been the case in an ancient Greek performance of the play.

Although some regard ""Iphigenia"" as an anti-war drama, the tragedy is far richer than a mere 'message' play. Certainly, Euripides had lived through the tumultuous events of Athens' war with Sparta, but the tragedy, produced after his death in Macedon, is essentially about selfishness and expediency, which in time of war, according to Euripides and his Athenian contemporaries, usually trump 'nomos'--the right thing to do in respect to one's family. Agamemnon makes his choice, and, as the audience knows, he is going to have to live--and die--by it.",1271808000,5,2334,5.356948228882834
208832,5,6300134318,"This was a nice find on my part after seeing so many terrible recent tellings of Greek history from Hollywood such as  Troy. All too often in recent American films you see a couple of things from Troy to Oliver Stone's Alexander a distorted editing of the time-The people and uniforms are too tidy,the actors look like they have just come out of Gold's gym and even the tans look artificial. Another thing one sees is how in American films in the 21st century the films sanitize ancient Greece-The Greeks are not shown as racist which they were as much as the Nazi's and the nature of early life of rasing a boy to be a warrior is even edited in Oliver Stone's Alexander showing boys wrestling in clean white cloths in a controlled enviroment by helpful instructors-sorry,the reality was kids would have been wrestling outside nude in the hot sun and there would have been plenty of injuries but does this make it to the screen...we cannot bring reality to the screen it appears...Consider even how much things have changed from the 1980's-a perfect exsample is the remake of Clash of the Titans compared to the 1980's version where mother and child walk naked down a beach which would not have been taboo in ancient Greece is now too taboo to appear on the remake 30 years later-Which is why this film is so great-it just could not be made in America in the early 21st century as it is just too realistic. Now by realistic I do not mean to imply voyeur cinema-there is nothing voyeur like in Iphigenia but a feeling of a different culture that was VERY different from our own and has not been edited to fit the views and sentiments of a modern viewing audience. The world of Iphigenia is brutual,women unlike some modern films showing woman in ancient times are not shown as equals to men but property as they were seeen in that time. This film begins as a good-looking but emotionally overwrought melodrama. Somehow, though, by its end the movie has worked up to a level of emotional intensity that does justice to Aristotle's famous phrase. Iphigenia is about the Greeks' determination to reach Troy, and about the terrible decision that their commander, Agamemnon, is presented with by the gods as the price for doing this. After his men inadvertently offend Artemis by killing a sacred deer, the gods withhold favorable winds from the Greek fleet, stranding their ships, halfway to Troy, on the island of Aulis. In this version of the old myth, taking place in a Bronze Age warrior society but produced by a young and troubled democracy, the leaders- Agamemnon, Menelaus, Achilles- enjoy only a partial and shaky control over their men, who, tired of waiting without adequate food or supplies, are on the brink of mutiny as the story begins. Odysseus is portrayed here as less just another tribal chieftain than as a dangerously eloquent demagogue, further stirring up the troops with resentment against their leaders. In this tense situation, the Greek chieftains, particularly Agamemnon and his brother Menelaus, are relieved when the prophet Calchas announces that he has learned of a sacrifice by which they can appease the gods. Agamemnon's relief turns to horror, however, when he learns that the required sacrificial victim is none other than his own daughter, Iphigenia. He keeps this secret from everyone except Menelaus, while at the same time he summons Iphigenia to Aulis. Caught between a rock and a hard place, Agamemnon seems unable to come to a decision, or rather, to be trying to put off a decision until the last possible moment. Agamemnon's mistake is that in trying to keep his options- neither of them good- he ends up backing himself into a corner, where he no longer has any choice. In part Euripides seems to be showing how power can be as imprisoning as powerlessness. Agamemnon, Menelaus suggests at some point, has spent his whole life in pursuit of power, and now his ambitions are rebounding on him. The horrible dilemma with which he is faced drives the story forward. I've never read Iphigenia at Aulis, but considering the tight restrictions in time and space of the Greek theater, I would assume that much of the script is of the filmmakers' own invention. The director tries to keep things cinematic, but really the film is at its best when it sticks to the text, and to dialogue-heavy exchanges between the characters. The movie only starts to really work when Iphigenia and her mother arrive at the Greek camp. Up until then the scenes, consisting as they do of exchanges between burly, armor-wearing, almost indistinguishable Greek warriors, tend to feel a little flat, so the introduction of the slight, delicate-looking Iphigenia brings a new note of dramatic contrast that grounds Agamemnon's dilemma in reality- it's an obvious but very effective device. As word spreads among the characters of the nature of the planned sacrifice, Agamemnon almost fades into the background of the story, and his dilemma takes on a life of its own. Once the army has learned of the gods' demand, Iphigenia is doomed. Considering that I already knew the outcome, Euripides's play and the filmmakers' adaptation does a remarkably good job of sustaining the tension and suspense to an almost unbearable degree. And as I have said,everything looks right on the screen from the filthy sweat and burnt by the sun look of Agamemnon to Iphigenia's little brother sounds asleep naked on a goat skin-it looks real and natural for the time which would seem strange and out of place in our own..such as in the film Young Aprodites by Janus Films where one feels like one is viewing something through a time machine rather than a film...Why Hollywood cannot capture this look and feel is tragic itself and sadly after horrible attempts like the film 300 to tell Greek history I am afraid they get worse evry year at doing it....
 Anyway, Iphigenia comes closer to that inevitable ending, I finally understood what Aristotle meant by ""pity and fear."" It may not be pleasant, but it is a riveting experience that left me somewhat shaken, and certainly rather subdued, after it was all over...One can only hope future films about ancient Greece will take a look at this film rather than look to Americanized versions of what ancient Greece was like. This film is haunting and beautiful and though it does not lend itself to much enjoyment for multiple viewings it is a film well worth seeing once.",1264809600,2,6412,4.812330009066184
208833,4,6300134318,"I do like the work of Kakogiannis. There are definitely echo's of Pasolini's Medea and Edipo Re in his movies. I think this movie is made with a lot of respect for the original playwrite. Also, I like the original scenery chosen. I am still hoping that one day also the Odyssee and Eneide from Rossi will be put on DVD !",1257724800,,320,4.17741935483871
208834,5,6300134318,"I don't have the background to discuss the classics and the place of Iphigenia in the canon of Greek literature.  But I can say that this was so beautifully acted that everyone in my family literally sat weeping through most of it.

Of course, most people know the story of how the Greek army is told that their leader's daughter must be sacrificed to Artemis (whose sacred stag he had arrogantly killed) or the winds won't blow their ships to Troy.

In this play/film, we see Clytemnestra (Iphigenia's mother) and Iphigenia happily going to the sacrificial site, thinking she is going to be wed to Achilles.  But when they arrive at the army camp, they discover that, instead, she is to die.

What tragedy!!  I even sympathized with Agammemnon (and doesn't everyone always hate HIM!).  It is so well acted!

If I recall correctly, these plays fulfilled a religious purpose and were supposed to purge emotions (correct me if I'm wrong).  Well, we were sure purged of grief!

The girl who played Iphigenia was perfect!  And who can ever say anything critical of Irene Pappas?  She is wonderful.

This film is truly a masterpiece, and you don't have to be an expert in Greek lit to know it!",1256083200,3,1188,4.653846153846154
208835,5,6300134318,"Greek Tragedy does not often get translated to film in a very convincing way. Iphigenia is a notable exception. The movie is perfectly paced, acted and and directed. Irene Pappas is the best known performer in the movie to non Greek viewers and she along with  the entire cast is wonderful in this. The story line based on Euripides' tragic play is well outlined below so I won't repeat what others have already said regarding the plot. Filmed in stark rural settings, Iphigenia is a great way to be introduced to Euripides for someone who hasn't read the original yet. This is not a slick Hollywood production with tons of special effects. It is an artistic film true to the spirit of the original play with a fine cast and what may be for some slow pacing. Just sit back and enjoy.

208836,4,6300134318,"I enjoyed the acting in this very interesting film.  It was refreshing to view a film untainted by the worn out formula of graphic sex, violence, explosions and vulgarity.  Good acting and lots of options with subtitles and dubbing.  If you're not in the mood for this radical departure, you may not like it.  But I was hungry for a change of pace and this delivered nicely.  I got so absorbed in the acting I felt like I was in the presence of the actors. There are a couple very powerful moments in the film where the acting between the king and the queen is a real jaw-dropper.  For me, just those well-acted scenes were worth the cost.",1219190400,6,639,4.372881355932203
208837,5,6300134318,"Note: Greek & Spanish with English subtitles.

The '77 film `Iphigenia' begins slowly and I must admit uninterestingly. The first images that greet your eyes are nothing more than a lot of half naked, Greek men lounging around a beach on a hot, sweltering, windless afternoon. You notice scattered piles of armor and other tools of warfare here and there serving as an indication of the time period of the tale that is to follow.

The mood is restless, even angry and the soundtrack amplifies the mood with appropriately discordant music. The men are anxious to sent sail for Troy and reclaim the beautiful Helen but the Gods have withheld the wind from their sails until they have been appeased with the sacrifice of their own choosing. When commander Agamemnon learns that the Gods demand the life of his beloved daughter Iphigenia he is coherced into sending for her under the pretense that she is to marry the brave Achilles.

Iphigenia (Tatiana Papamoschou) happily arrives in camp with her Mother (Irene Papas) and female attendants under the delusion that her marriage is at hand (This is where the film comes alive and captures the audiences rapt attention). As the lies and pretenses of Iphigenia's reason for being summoned slowly fall away and her true purpose for being there is made known the viewer is caught up in this heart wrenching tale of familial love versus blind obedience to an unsympathetic Divinity.

Excellent adaptation of Greek tragedy captured on film. The only thing missing is the outdoor amphitheater and chorus.",1215302400,6,1544,4.94980694980695

He shows us that the ugly beast of war consumes and destroys everything in us that is noble and delicate, that religion is its instrument, politics its machinery, individual anguish and despair its food, and then, by some miraculous process, he leaves us elevated, not cast down. The human heart, though powerless, is yet triumphant. This film version of Euripedes' Iphigenia does not fail to bring the master's lessons home.",1211587200,4,592,4.757281553398058

208878,4,6300134318,This film has a rapturing tale. Gods and men are monstruous liars.

Essentially, this  stunninglyly acted  film dramatises, poignantly and  shockingly, the repercussions on the innocent of the union of egomania, the ambition for power and warmongering.

The juxtaposition of  and  intense tension between the male and female worlds, ie the violent vs the lifegivers, the state  vs the family, is tightly contained within prisons within prisons.

Just as the sacred deer is trapped and  slaughtered by soldiers, so too the beautiful Iphigenia is trapped  and slaughtered by the corruption of power and the lust for war. Agamennon is trapped by his ambition, pride and the military,  consequently Clytemenestra is trapped by Agamemnon's decision to sacrifice their daughter.

It is only the innocent Iphigenia who emerges with phenomenal human dignity thereby intensifying the personal and universal tragedy caused by war and egomanic power.

208881,5,6300134318,"For anyone who loves Greek tragedy and the beauty of complexities of ancient storytelling, this presentation of ""Iphigenia"" should not be missed.  We see Greek soldiers stranded in the port, waiting for wind so they can sail and recover beautiful Helen who was abducted by young prince Paris.  The chief of the army is ruthless Agamemnon and he is followed by his brother Menelaus who is Helen's husband. As soldiers fight boredom, heat and hunger, Agamemnon gets a prophecy from the local temple's priest that the only way soldires can leave the island is if the sacrifice is made for the virgin goddess Artemis, protector of the island.  Oracle says that Agamemnon must sacrifice his eldest daughter Iphigenia.  To lure her daughter for a scarifice ceremony, Agamemnon announces to his wife Clytemnestra that he is marrying Iphigenia to Achilles, young, handsome and fearless Greek hero.  Mother wishes to participate in her daughter's marriage to a great hero from a good family and unknowingly prepares her eldest daughter for her sacrifice.  One can only think - what else can happen know?  But this is where the beauty of the story unfolds.  We see Agamemnon realizing that he is a victim of a scam until it is too late. His wife, daughter, ladies in waiting, his little son Orestes all beg him to spare young Iphigenia's life.  Even the Achilles pledges to protect young girl in order to protect her honor, honor of both of their families and spare her life at a price of his own.  Young actress playing Iphigenia delivers majestic performance from this point on.  We see her as a young princess of true royal blood, full of wisdom and courage.  Her eyes, full lips and innocent face are before all this tough men and soldiers but she commands them all with her calm presence.  She is a bride whose wedding ceremony starts and ends at the top of the mountain, where we learn she is not being sacrificed to the Gods, but she is soldiers' revenge against ruthless Agamemnon whose ambition, greed and perhaps hidden lust for Helen is so great, that he must pay for it with a life of an innocent.  Irene Pappas who plays Clytemnestra, Iphigenia's mother is heartbreaking when she learns the fate of her daughter.  She swallows her pride, enlists and begs anyone who will listen to try to save her daughter.  Film is made in Greek language that only adds beauty to it.  The island is true mediterranian island: hot, barren with nothing but olive treas, surrounded with vast blue sea that hugs blue skies.  The heat of the island is competing with heat of emotions that erupts with wind, Greek soldiers sailing out and heartbroken mother whose pain can only be seen in her dark eyes that have no other emotions left but hatred.",1194220800,6,2728,4.731501057082452

If it were not so, my rating of this DVD tranfer would be ONE star only.  I was stunned by the gall of MGM World Film!  How dare they sabotage Cacoyannis' masterpiece?  How could the idiots who published this DVD took so much liberty with the original film, cropping it on all sides.  As a result, the long shots are seriously shrunk, the people in the full shots are most of the time cropped, and even more so the close-ups, which are badly damaged, giving the impression that Cacoyannis does not know how to use his camera.  (Where is Criterion when we need it?)  Therefore, I give ONE star to this disaster of a transfer, which has irremediably damage this beautiful production.
______________________________________

Mikhali Cacoyannis is peharps the first film director to have successfully brought the feel of ancient Greek theatre to the screen. Cacoyannis' film was based on his stage production of the play, produced first in Greece then taken on tour, where it played at the Classic Stage Company in New York. His own screenplay, an adaptation of Euripides' tragedy was far from easy, compared to that of the other two films of the trilogy he directed. The text of the original play contains many inconsistencies resulting from the fact that the play is thought to have been put together after Euripides' death, by his own son, using rough drafts. However, Cacoyannis, in his transcription of the tragedy to the screen, seems to have done away with these inconsistencies and ambiguities. The story itself has been very carefully deconstructed from Euripides' version and placed in a logical, strictly chronological framework, better conforming to the modern methods of cinematic story-telling.

The most obvious of Cacoyannis' changes to the original play is the removal of the Chorus of Players traditionally employed to provide explanatory narrative before and after key scenes. These choral interludes would have been alien to the pace of the film, and made for cinematic nonsense. As a result of having eschewed the chorus, the drama moves forward in a seamless and coherent fashion. Cacoyannis also added some characters to his film who do not appear in Euripides' tragedy: Odysseus, Calchas, and the army. This was done in order to make some of Euripides' points regarding war, the Church, and Government clearer. Finally, Cacoyannis' ending differs remarkably from Euripides'. Cacoyannis chooses to leave the ending somewhat ambiguous: is Iphigenia supernaturally whisked away, as in Euripides' play, or is she sacrificed, in agreement with the tradition? Not having Agamemnon's eyes, we'll never know for sure.

The film was shot on location at Aulis. The Director of Photography, Giorgos Arvanitis, shows us a rugged but beautiful Greece, where since the Homeric days time seems to have stood still. He takes advantage of the bodies, the arid land, the ruins, the intense light and the darkness. The harshness of the landscape is particularly fitting to the souls of the characters. The camera uses the whole gamut of available shots, from the very long, reinforcing the vastness and desolation of the landscape, as well as the human scale involved, to the extreme close-ups, dissecting and probing deep into the soul of the tormented characters.

Cacoyannis opens the film with a bold, accelerating tracking shot along a line of beached boats. This shot is followed by an aerial view of the several thousands soldiers lying listlessly on the beach. This is a very effective means of communicating Agamemnon's awesome political and military responsibility -- quite a different way from Agamemnon's recounting of these events in Euripides' original tragedy.

No word but ""sublime"" can describe the stunning performances of Kosta Kazakos (Agamemnon), Irene Papas (Clytemnestra), and Tatiana Papamoschou (Iphigenia). Since my Greek is, as it is I believe for most of you, limited to only few words, I must refer to the subtitles 100% of the time. But are subtitles, letters at the bottom of the screen, what choke you and bring tears into your eyes? Most likely not. I believe instead that the amazing power and sincerity of the acting is the reason. Kazakos and Papas embody the sublimity of the classical Greece tragedy. Kazakos' character is extremely down-to-earth, and his powerful look into the camera, more than his words, reveals the unbelievable torment tearing his soul. Irene Papas is the modern quintessence of classic Greek plays. In Iphigenia , she is terrible in her anguish, and even more so for what we know will be her vengeance. Her career spans more than fifty years, during which she has appeared in more than seventy films, including all three of. Cacoyannis' Euripidean trilogy. Tatiana Papamoskou, in her first role on the screen, is outstanding in her portray of the innocent Iphigenia, which contrasts with Kazakos' austere depiction of her father, Agamemnon. She received Best Leading Actress Award at the 1977 Thessaloniki Film Festival.

Cacoyannis is faithful to Euripides in his representation of the other characters, and his chosen actors have lived up to the tasks: Odysseus is a sly, scheming politician, Achilles, a vain, narcissistic warrior, Menalaus is self centered, obsessed with his honor, eager to be avenged, and to have his wife and property restored.

The costumes and sets are realistic: no Hollywood there. Agamemnon's quarters resembles a barn, he dresses, as do the others, in utilitarian, hand-woven, simple garb. Clytemnestra's royal caravan is made up of rough-hewn wooden carts.

The music is by the prolific contemporary music composer Mikis Theodorakis. Theodorakis' score intensifies the dramatic and cinematographic unfolding, reflects on the psychological aspect of the tragedy, and accentuates its dimensions and actuality. Theodorakis uses the richness of motifs from the first movement of his seventh symphony (""of Spring""), but also the Byzantium theme from his third and seventh symphonies.

This film and the story it narrates offer considerable insight into the lost world of ancient Greek thought that was the crucible for so much of our modern civilization. It teaches us much about ourselves as individuals and as social and political creatures. Euripides questions the value of war and patriotism when measured against the simple virtues of family and love, and reflects on woman's vulnerable position in a world of manly violence. In his adaptation of Euripides' tragedy, Cacoyannis revisits all of these themes in a modern, clear, and dramatic fashion.

The relationships governing the political machinations are clearly demonstrated: war corrupts and destroys the human soul to such an extent that neither the individual nor the group can function normally any longer. With the possible exception of Menelaus, whose honor has been tarnished by his own wife's elopement with her lover, everyone else has his own private motivation for going to war with Troy: the thirst for power (Agamemnon), greed (the army, Odysseus), or glory (Achilles). And so in a real sense, Helen became the WMD of the Trojan War. The War, stripped of all Homeric glamor and religious sanctioning, was just an imperialist venture, spurred primarily by the desire for material gain, all else being a convenient pretext.

Another conflict raised in the film is that between the Church and the State. Calchas, who represents the Church, feeling the challenge to his priestly authority and wishing to destroy Agamemnon for the insult to the Goddess he serves, tells him to sacrifice his daughter. In consenting to the sacrifice, the King comes closer to his moral undoing, but in refusing, loses his power over the masses (his army), who are brainwashed by religion. Of course, for Agamemnon, it's a game. The King must go along with the charade whether he honestly believes in the Gods or not. At first, he agrees to the sacrifice because, blinded by his ambition, he trusts that the winds will eventually blow. When he realizes he has ensnared himself into committing a despicable filicide, it is too late: he is trapped.

Is it a sacrifice or a murder, and how can we tell the difference between the two? By focusing on the violent and primitive horror of a human sacrifice--and, worst of all, the sacrifice of one's own child--Euripides/Cacoyannis creates a drama that is at once deeply political and agonizingly personal. It touches on a most complex and delicate ethical problem facing any society: the dire conflict between the needs of the individual versus those of the society. In the case of Iphigenia, however, as in the Biblical tale of Abraham and Isaac, the father is asked to kill his own child, by his own hand. What sort of God would insist on such payment? Can it be just or moral, even if divinely inspired? Finally, does the daughter's sacrificial death differ from the deaths of all the sons who are being sent to war? These are many deep questions raised by a two-hour film.

Euripides' Iphigenia is a tragedy for all time, and deserves a special place in the modern repertoire. Cacoyannis' film recreates for the modern audience that overwhelming, excruciating assault on the emotions that was Euripides' special talent, which made him, in his own time, a poet greatly loved but also feared.

Iphigenia received Best Film Award at the 1977 Thessaloniki Film Festival, and the 1978 Belgian Femina Award.",1189036800,27,9523,5.126370083816893
208884,4,6300134318,"Competent in its technical aspects, considering its age.  The main weakness is the audio, which is much improved from the VHS release but still overemphasizes ""ambience"" -- background noises.  Some may like it that way; I suspect, however, that it was as simple a thing as poor mike placement.  And again, the musical score is sparse: Some may like the stark quality that suggests, but for my tastes a little Hollywood-ization -- a little, not a lot -- would have added to the production.

Please do not hear this as a bad review of this great performance, to which others have accurately paid tribute.  But this is not a big-budget production and it looks and sounds like a 1970s foreign film . . . which is exactly what it is.

And like others, I use it in the classroom to introduce Greek tragedy, but I caution the students not to expect ""Troy"" or ""300.""  Most of them can deal with the fact that there isn't a car chase or gunfight at the end.",1188604800,,948,4.445086705202312

208906,5,6300134318,"Stunning, profound, expressive. This is Michael Cacoyannis' greatest masterpiece of three Euripidean tragedies.  His first was ""Electra"" which was a stark drama in Black and White shot at the actual ruins of King Agamemnon's palace at Mycenae in Southern Greece. The second was in color - ""The Trojan Woman"" - a disturbing portrait of men's cruelty to the vanquished in war.  The third, my personal favorite, is this film. While it involves the sweep of historical events, it remains focused on a highly intense family drama - a heart wrenching decision between duty versus love.

What is the story of Iphigenia? Agamemnon assumes the honor,duty, and responsibility of leading the troops of Greece to war with Troy so as to avenge his brother's mistreatment by a Trojan prince.  Having killed a sacred deer of the goddess (Artemis), the King discovers the winds will not blow for the Greeks. That means his battle ships cannot launch.  To persuade the Gods to give him the wind to victory, the King learns he must sacrifice that person most dear to him, his innocent and
virginal daughter, Iphiginia.  Agamemnon's reaction when he discovers the terrible choice he must make is a frightful anger.  He clearly does not want to lose his flesh and blood, his innocence, but he is also realizes he is asking his troops to risk death in the upcoming war.  Ultimately, and reluctantly, he chooses death for his daughter.  Eventually she discovers her terrible destiny...as does her mother Clytemnestra. The mother refuses to allow it, but Iphigenia sees the honor of being martyred and chooses to die...and therefore to live for Greece.

The last moment of the film is everything Greek tragedy should be. We see the knife, Agamemnon's stark reaction to the horror, and the wind blows at long last.

Part of the power of the film comes from the stark locations...Here we don't see sumptuous palaces in, let's say, Richard Burton's ""Helen of Troy.""  Instead, the action is filmed in the rough landscapes of Greece reflecting the tough, untamed ancient world. And the cast...the cast is magnificent.  Tatiana Papamoskou is beautiful and fair...yet she radiates something more...a real heroism.  The King, played by Kostas Kazakos, is vital, brutal, charismatic, and surprisingly protective of his daughter.  His wife, Irene Papas, plays the profoundly strong Greek woman to the core.

I cannot imagine anyone who won't be moved by these stirring performances. Highly recommended.",1185321600,33,2469,5.089330024813896

The emotion in the movie was thrilling, and the music added greatly to it. Near the end, my heart was thumping, although I already knew what was going to happen.

My only issue with this movie is the actor who played Iphigenia. Yes, she is cute, but her hair- In my mind, she looked almost like a boy. I have always pictured Iphigenia with shoulder length blackish-red hair, but that's just me.

208912,4,6300134318,"This is the last film in director Michael Cacoyannis's Greek Tragedy trilogy after his early Sixties ""Electra"" (featuring Irene Pappas in the title role) and his early Seventies ""The Trojan Women"" (which starred Katherine Hepburn, Vanessa Redgrave, Genevieve Bujold and, once again, Irene Pappas - as Helen of Troy).

All three movies are based on the works of Euripides - who was born approximately 484 BCE and died circa 406 BCE. Out of all the ancient Greek tragedians his work has arguably the most relevance to a contemporary audience as it eloquently demonstrates the causes and nature of human suffering especially in circumstances of war or multiple  murder. Despite our current familiarity with these subjects we may not always perhaps be able to fully comprehend the nature of the painful emotional consequences involved.

""Iphigenia"" is significantly more low-budget than the visually impressive second film in the trilogy and yet it has it's own considerable emotional power. Like the first film of the three it is spoken in Greek with English subtitles.

As the film opens the Greek army is waiting at Aulis for the winds to pick up in order that they may sail to Troy. But they have been waiting many months and no such winds have arrived. The troops have become restless and are on the verge of mutiny. Agamemnon - the commander in chief - has sought advice from the Oracle at Delphi as to the best solution to this problem. To his shock and horror the answer returns that in order to sail to Troy and be successful in the ensuing war he must sacrifice his beloved daughter Iphigenia.

Initially Agamemnon refuses to perform such a deed. He attempts to seek any way out that he possibly can. But eventually he is persuaded by his brother Menelaus (the abduction of whose wife Helen sparked the Trojan War) that it is a tragic but necessary solution to their impasse.

Agamemnon decides to lure Iphigenia to Aulis on the pretext that she is to marry Achilles. But little does he know that Clytemnestra (played by Irene Pappas), his strong-willed wife, has decided (against his expressed instructions) to accompany her daughter to the proposed wedding.

The first half of this film is rather unimpressive. You have the feeling you are watching a fairly cheap Greek tv movie. And yet, from the point where Iphigenia (played by a marvellous swan-necked, androgenous young Greek actress) meets Agamemnon, her tortured father, the film really takes off. Clytemnestra finds out her husband's terrible intention and attempts to recruit Achilles as her ally in order to save her teenage daughter's life. But the wily Odysseus, with his demagogic influence on the Greek army, stands in their way.

The final twenty minutes of the film have as much emotional power as any play or movie I have ever seen. The sheer heartbreaking dilemma of the characters is conveyed in a stunningly convincing manner. At the screening I attended many people were on the verge of tears during this concluding section. I would unreservedly recommend this film to anyone with the slightest interest in either Classical History, Greek Tragic Theatre or an emotionally fulfilling cinematic experience.",996019200,100,3183,4.992452830188679

7803040,4,6300134318,"This 1977 film retells one of the more poignant tales from Greek mythology.  When King Agamemnon prepares to send the Greek navy against Troy, he finds the oceans becalmed.  The oracle tells him that the gods demand that he sacrifice his daughter, Iphigenia, if he is to be able to launch his fleet.  The film captures the internal conflict that he faces.  He is hesitant to kill his own child, but as a king whose power depends on the support of his warriors, and as a religious man who is unwilling to go against the gods, he eventually bows to the inevitable.  He summons Iphigenia to his camp under the pretext of offering her in marriage to the warrior Achilles, but then goes through with the sacrifice instead, albeit reluctantly.  And in the long run, he will pay for this decision: he will win the Trojan war, only to be murdered by his vengeful wife when he returns ten years later.  The film powerfully evokes the world of Ancient Greece and brings the legendary characters to life.  Iphigenia is powerless, an innocent girl caught up in events larger than herself.  Achilles, who famously proves his prowess in battle during the Trojan War, is rather more humane toward women.  Agamemnon himself is portrayed as morally ambiguous, internally conflicted, but driven to kill by force of circumstance.",1446595200,,1310,4.782222222222222

7803048,5,6300134318,"This excellent movie reinterprets the tragedy of Iphigenia in Aulis in a new way. The underlying fabric of the plot brings to our attention many human characteristics such as ambition, jealousy, the need to comply with necessity, not omitting vanity, weakness, despair, hate and opportinism (on the part of Odysseus). The script is superb and convincing since it adds insight of psychology to the myth. The result is a story that unravels with logic the underlying factors of crime and vengence.

The actors are fascinating : Agamenon - and finally Menelaos - transmit their despair about Chalchos' claim of disguised vengeance for the accidental killing of the divine deer by Agamenon's troops who try to provide food for a starving army that is on the brink of revolt; the ruthless and cunning Odysseus pulls his strings from behind, being helped by the priest Chalchos ; Clytemnestra (the most excellent Irene Papas) is betrayed by her husband and becomes unforgiving for the murder of her daughter. And finally the innocent Iphigenia, a girl that seems to consist of fine marble, animated by breath and who is the victim of the sacrifice. The situation is out of control and devoid of reason since the monstrous Greek army has one objective only: invading Troy at all cost.

A powerful movie of high aesthetic value, superbe acting and an insight in human nature that does not fail one moment. Superb!",1343174400,4,1405,4.9491525423728815
