8206062,3,B000SNBJDQ,"Watching the DVD ""Drawing People"" is like a one hour visit with a grandmother who is a famous artist.  She is kindly and less pushy than your mother.  Grandma gives you wise counsel about how to practice drawing and how to have realistic expectations.  She quickly demonstrates some basic information about portrait drawing and figure drawing.  You wish that you could stay longer and ask some questions, but you have to leave.

The artist Donna Hugh instructs us.  She speaks spontaneously, but in an organized manner.  Her delivery isn't smooth.  There are times when she searches for the right words.  This is a professionally produced video, but the design of the camera work isn't up to par.  When we see her drawing, we usually have a vantage point that is to one side and too far away to see the fine details of what she is doing.  There are a few times when we would like to see her drawing but we see a ""talking head"" view of her sitting at her desk instead.  All the drawings are suitable for children.  The emphasis is on line drawings.  She shows that a line drawing of a figure can be smeared with water and a brush to add shading, but she does not emphasize visualizing the shapes of shadows.

The material on portrait drawing is a traditional approach.  Learn to draw the features  -eye, nose, lips.  Then learn where they go on an oval that represents the head.  The lesson on the eye is clear and done with a felt pen using a simple contour representation of the parts of the eye and some hatching for shading.  It is harder to see her drawings of the nose and the lips which are done with different implements.  After explaining the placement of the features ( the eyes go on a horizontal line through the center of the head etc.), she draws a quick sketch of a young girl from life.

The material on figure drawing contains the traditional fact that a standing figure can be drawn about 7 heads high and not much else in the way of how to draw a figure.  Donna does demonstrate several drawings of child in a baseball uniform done from a photograph, but certainly not in a ""step-by-step"" manner.  She demonstrates how a figure in a photo can be copied using a grid, but not in enough detail to teach anyone unfamiliar with the process how to do it.

For teaching how to draw particular things, I would rate this DVD as one star out of five to indicate that it is completely inadequate.  However, Grandma's general advice about simple ways to practice drawing (and her urging you to practice)  is five star.  Among her suggestions are these:

1. Use a mirror and draw your own eyes, ears, etc.  Most famous artists did self portraits

2. Use casts of eyes, noses etc. that are available from art supply stores and draw them in various lights

3. Get your friends to sit for short (say 10 minute) poses and draw their features.  Make sure that they understand you aren't trying to draw a likeness - or don't show them the drawing at all.  Most people get too discouraged if their models tell them that their drawings don't look realistic.

4. When trying to draw a figure from a photograph where the background is complicated, try cutting the figure out before you draw it.

5. Make drawings of the articulated manikins sold at art supply stores.

6. Study the shape of a figure in a photo by copying it with a grid.  Then try to draw it freehand.

7. Look at a portrait drawing upside down to check the placement of the features.

All this advice is simple and, to many people, obvious.  However, I am sure there are many who perversely spend more time looking for the magic book or DVD that will teach them how to draw than they spend on doing those simple exercises.

I rate this DVD as three stars out of five.  That's the best I can do to indicate that the general advice and moral support is first rate and the drawing lessons are too abbreviated.",1273536000,7,3870,4.445234708392603
