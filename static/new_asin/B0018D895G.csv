8269605,5,B0018D895G,"Because I prefer to have musical masterpieces represented as the composer intended, and because Tatiana Nikolayeva received information and advice directly from Shostakovich for properly playing this composition, I feel that this is a very important and historic performance.  We are fortunate to have this performance for reference and enjoyment.",1424563200,,347,5.94
8269606,5,B0018D895G,"I knew nothing about Ms Nikolayeva but am now utterly smitten!  Her poetry at the keyboard is simply stunning.  I am only so sorry to have only discovered her now.  As a pianist, one would have thought I would have been exposed to her playing.  The DVD is a bit unwieldy to ""operate"" but my DVD player is ready for an overhaul anyway.  Perhaps once I get my new one set up, I'll be even more enthused with the DVD.",1390780800,,414,4.125
8269607,3,B0018D895G,"I like the way Tatiana Nikolaeva plays Shostakovich preludes. Some of the tempos are much slower then I am used to hearing, but she is thinking thought it as she plays. I wonder how she played it when she was a young women.",1356652800,,223,4.209302325581396
8269608,5,B0018D895G,"I am a huge fan of Russian composers, especially the 20th century ones. First came ballet music. It began with Romeo and Juliet: the ballet was very good, but the music by Prokofiev just blew me away. Then there was Stravinsky's Rite of Spring with its complex rhythms. Next came Khachaturian's Spartacus with Carlos Acosta.
According to Wikipedia, Shostakovich wrote only one ballet: The Bolt, which premiered in Leningrad in 1931, was jeered by the audience and was not performed again for 74 years. I have not seen The Bolt. I began with this performance by Tatiana Nicolayeva from 1992 playing Shostakovich's Preludes & Fugues. She looks like your average Russian grandmother, but I can only describe her playing as heavenly.
I am now listening to Shostakovich's complete quartets by the Emerson Quartet. Next come the symphonies.
For further information on the DVD read Scott Morrison's excellent review, the leading classical reviewer on this site.",1259884800,,954,5.161290322580645
8269609,5,B0018D895G,"Everything about this DVD is first rate. The compositions are masterpieces. The performer plays them better than anyone else. The film was made with patience, care, intelligence, and forethought -- it is interesting to watch without distracting from the performance. As to the performance... it is beautiful. We are lucky this film exists!",1223078400,8,339,5.415094339622642

8269611,5,B0018D895G,"When it comes to Shostakovich's Preludes Tatiana Nikolayeva is the abosulte master. One thing is to hear her performances, another to see her absolute dominion and mastership of everything needed to be a great concert master. You will see her flawless hands movements, her incredible fingering and how she can obtain crescendos and pianissimos pressing the keys all the way down. Old school, if you want, but perfect. On an subjective feelings I discovered her beyond the audible spectrum, although I have heard many times her The Art of The Fugue incomparable performances. I f you like Shostakovich and/or if you like virtuoso performances, do yourself a favor, and get this DVD.",1219276800,14,681,5.089285714285714
8269612,5,B0018D895G,"At the Leipzig Bach Piano Competition held in 1950 on the occasion of the 200th anniversary of Bach's death, Dmitri Shostakovich was the chief judge. The winning pianist was a 26-year-old Russian, Tatiana Nikolayeva. The two met and began what was to become a lifelong friendship. Hearing so much Bach so impressed Shostakovich that a year later he composed what became his Op. 87, the 24 Preludes and Fugues for piano, inspired by Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier which Nikolayeva had played so well in Leipzig. He dedicated the work to her, she premiered it in 1952, and the set became the work with which Nikolayeva was most closely associated. She recorded it a number of times. Forty years later in December 1992 she was filmed playing the work in the BBC studio. The set was then telecast piecemeal over a period of several days during that year's Christmas season. Only a year later Nikolayeva died at the age of sixty-nine.

The Preludes and Fugues are written in each of the twenty-four major and minor keys of the chromatic scale. Rather than being arranged in parallel major and minor pairs (C Major/C Minor; D Flat Major/C Sharp Minor, etc.) ascending the chromatic scale, Shostakovich's set is arranged in ascending major and relative minor pairs (C major/A minor; G Major/E minor, etc.). Each fugue is based on a musical fragment taken from its preceding prelude. The set takes about 2 1/2 hours to play.

Nikolayeva is filmed in a setting that is made mildly abstract by use of a fanciful set and creative lighting. (The arrangements of colors reminded me of the paintings of Vassily Kandinsky). She is dressed in a floor length black gown accented only by a pearl and onyx brooch. She had thickened in her later years and with her hair pulled tightly back into a proper bun, she reminds one of an elegant Russian babushka. The camera focuses much of the time on her pudgy but strong hands, but there are long shots and head shots from time to time. Her posture at the piano is upright, almost motionless except for her hands and arms. At times she appears to be almost in a trance. Her playing is subtle, sensitively nuanced and under utter control. The overall effect is hypnotic. One cannot but feel that Nikolayeva's performance is definitive. Sound is slightly reverberant but quite acceptable.

There is a fourteen minute documentary featuring Nikolayeva talking about the 1950 Bach competition and her meeting with and developing friendship with Shostakovich. There is black & white footage of the two of them in Leipzig as well as in his apartment. There is also footage of his historic 1949 trip to New York as cultural emissary of the Soviet government. She comments that the great conductor Kurt Sanderling had said to her that the Preludes and Fugues were Shostakovich's 'intimate diary.'

For anyone loving this work and familiar with any of the several of Nikolayeva's recordings of it, this DVD is self-recommending.
