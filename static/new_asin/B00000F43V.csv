7906721,3,B00000F43V,"This New Year's Eve episode of ""The Honeymooners"" from the 1953-1954 season isn't exactly the best episode/skit of the show around.  It does feature Ralph and Alice, Ed and Trixie, but the majority of the show is built around the characters going to a night club to see Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey and the orchestras.  The bulk of this show is made up of live music and dancing, giving the viewer the feeling of actually looking in on a nightclub.  Not exactly what ""The Honeymooners"" were built around!  The second episode on this tape is called ""Two Family Car"" and is a short skit performed during the 1956-1957 season, after the Classic 39 had already been filmed and aired.  This is probably the stronger of the two shows, featuring Ralph and Ed entering a contest to win a 1957 4-door sedan.  This tape is recommended for the collector and fan who feels they must own every show on tape complete and unedited, just like I must!  For the casual fan, I would look elsewhere.",991267200,3,973,4.557471264367816
