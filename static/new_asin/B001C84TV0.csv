8286286,5,B001C84TV0,great instructions but some people also need them in written form. I personally do not have a VCR so i must get them transfered to DVD. Another expense!,1400457600,,152,4.464285714285714
8286287,5,B001C84TV0,This product was very helpful. I expected a book and got a video instead. Luckily I have a VHS player. The information contained in the video allowed me to operate my Popeil Pasta maker in the proper manner and make some delicious pasta. I will be using this video for the length of time it take me to transcribe the information to paper. I recommend this product if the book is not available. It is very helpful when it come to making great Pasta.,1327881600,,448,4.345238095238095
