6432512,2,B00KITEIAG,I didn't like it.  Other comedians were barely funny and ralphie wasn't at his best.,1409270400,,84,4.6
6432513,1,B00KITEIAG,Only played the intro. in a continuous loop.  Not good.,1409270400,,55,4.5
6432514,5,B00KITEIAG,"Totally hilarious!  All the comedians are fresh and funny, but I think the Smash Brothers stole the show.",1409011200,3,105,4.833333333333333

6432518,5,B00KITEIAG,"If you are easily offended, Ralphie may not be for you!  If you want to laugh out loud, he's the guy!",1433376000,,101,3.8095238095238093
6432519,1,B00KITEIAG,"I'm sorry, I just don't think Ralphie May is funny at all! I have given him so many chances. Going back to when he was a contestant on ""Last Comic Standing"". Being vulgar and acting like you are African American doesn't make you a comedian. I am no prude. I like my comedy sometimes nasty as hell...but it has to suit the jokes. The problem with Ralphie is there are no jokes. He tries to use ""Observation comedy"" like the great Louis CK and it is so ""forced"". You can tell by his look of terror these stories never happened. I have been a fan of stand up so long I've seen the art evolve from Lenny Bruce to Katt Williams! I give everyone a chance. Why? Because I do stand-up at open mic's. I know, I am no pro or am disillusioned that I will make it someday. I just love to make people laugh. But I bow to the great comedians of the past (Carlin, Patrice O'Neal,Bernie Mac, Sam Kinison, Greg Giraldo,John Pinette, Richard Jeni, Johanthan Winters, Robin Williams...so many gone too soon). Plus the great ones of today (Louis CK (The King), Bill Burr, Jim Jeffries, Chris Rock, Zach Galifianakis (Yes! he is a stand up too!) Sarah Silverman,  Chelsea Peretti, Louis Black, Seinfeld, Craig Ferguson...an endless list of halarious people that are all unique!) Ralphie begs borrows and steals and there's no other way to put it, thinks he's black! Ralphie is now off my list of chances....he has gotten as big as he will (no pun intended). But that's okay because there are plenty others! If whoever is reading this haven't heard some of the great comedians I listed...check them out! Laugh every day! :)",1433116800,,1601,4.520689655172414
6432520,1,B00KITEIAG,This was not very funny.  Not worth watching.,1432771200,,45,4.625
6432521,3,B00KITEIAG,"just about everything in this video is forgettable.  Except for the Smash Bros who come in at the end.  It's good for mild chuckles until I saw their set, but ultimately it was just a rental for me, and not a purchase.",1432252800,,218,4.166666666666667
6432522,2,B00KITEIAG,Not as expected. I LOVE Ralphie May but this was a collection of other un-funny guys.,1432166400,,85,4.375

6432526,5,B00KITEIAG,Ralphie May is funny as hell. I laughed so hard my sides hurt. I have not seen a comedian come around like him in a while. Must see.,1426982400,,132,3.75
6432527,1,B00KITEIAG,horrible! I'm a big Ralphie may fan and this was just down right disappointing,1426896000,,78,4.642857142857143
6432528,2,B00KITEIAG,"I really liked Ralphie May in the past. However, as the title says, filthy is the keyword here. This comedy special was EXTREMELY vulgar and crude. I wasn't expecting it to be as bad as it was. I couldn't even finish watching it. If crude, rude, and vulgar is your thing, then you'll love this movie. If you're not into that type of comedy, steer clear of this!",1424908800,,361,4.323529411764706
6432529,2,B00KITEIAG,not as good as his other stand up videos.....when he wins he wins big when he inches by its just not good....,1423958400,,109,4.0

6432532,5,B00KITEIAG,RALPHIE IS THE BEST!,1415750400,,20,4.25
6432533,4,B00KITEIAG,See them live if you ever get a chance. The movie was ok. I saw Ralphie and the smash brothers a week after filming this in California.  The live sets were so much better than this editing. Did not do justice to their acts. As far as the other acts. Billy was good Danielle was ok and I loved bear's act. He is an act you need to be loosen for.,1415232000,3,344,3.8450704225352115
6432534,1,B00KITEIAG,"I normally like Ralphie, but this one, not so much. A little to much language for me.",1413504000,2,85,4.0588235294117645
6432535,1,B00KITEIAG,"If you like raunchy sub-par jokes solely based on Hedonism, homosexuality, and drug abuse, then get it.  If you don't, I strongly urge you not to waste your time. Stardom has gone to his head, not the cleaver Ralphie May I am accustomed to.",1413244800,,240,4.454545454545454
6432536,3,B00KITEIAG,so he's hosting he does 20min in begin and the other 4 comics are not really good at all. Seen Ralphie on cover &assumed it was his own special heads up.,1412899200,,153,3.967741935483871
6432537,1,B00KITEIAG,"Awful.  Filthy.  And in spite of this guy saying he doesn't care about being politically correct, he's lying.  He bashes Caucasians in an effort to be cool.  He also totally misses the boat on politics.  He should stick to what he knows -- street life.  We've seen other videos of his and thought he was funny.  Not this one.",1412208000,,325,4.406779661016949

6432539,1,B00KITEIAG,"Very very disappointed. This is the 5th DVDs I bought but it is NOT worth spending the money, Ralphie's materials are not funny, the other comedians also fell way short, if you are expecting the same level of ""FUNNINESS"" as before, you will be disappointed.",1412035200,2,257,4.733333333333333
6432540,1,B00KITEIAG,Not very funny the twins at the end were ok but seemed shorter than the rest. Or I enjoyed that part more.,1411430400,2,106,3.8636363636363638
6432541,5,B00KITEIAG,We saw this made Live in Portland and even made it onto the DVD so of course we had to get it. Wished there was more of Ralphie but the other comedians are really funny too.,1411171200,,173,3.8333333333333335
6432542,2,B00KITEIAG,Love Ralphie May but this really wasn't funny.  Lots of cussing for no reason and nothing that stood out.,1410739200,,105,4.526315789473684

6432544,1,B00KITEIAG,"I literally had to keep skipping segments because it was so bad and not even remotely funny. And i didn't even finish it. half tthe time the ""comics"" were complaining the crowd wasn't laughing. This is terrible, do not waste your money.",1410652800,2,236,4.642857142857143
6432545,1,B00KITEIAG,"I got excited because this was a new Ralphie May stand-up but this was very disappointing. The jokes were not funny and lacked creativity. I understand it is the ""Filthy Animal Tour"" but come on you can't just swear a whole bunch and expect laughs. The content in the stand-up seemed to be made up on the spot. I couldn't finish this and I was a Ralphie fan before this!",1410134400,3,370,4.3
6432546,5,B00KITEIAG,"Smash Bros Cory N Chad steal the Filthy Animal Show along with classic Ralphie!  Well worth the $13, just wish the editing was better.  They cut the Smash Bros set and edited it to make it ""cleaner""...CMON NOW THIS IS THE FILTHY ANIMAL TOUR!!!",1410048000,,243,4.5
6432547,1,B00KITEIAG,"I usually like Ralphie May, even though he can be somewhat raunchy. He makes me laugh. Sorry, but I can't say that about the ""Filthy Animal Tour"". It sucked with a capital ""S"". Not one of the comedians was even remotely funny and I had a hard time finishing the DVD. I had to because I paid for it and I kept hoping it would get better, but to my disappointment it didn't. Ralphie looked and acted like he had been smoking crack or something. If this is his new norm then he has lost a fan.",1409356800,,490,4.061855670103093
