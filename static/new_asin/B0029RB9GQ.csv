Also, the women characters are empowered and interesting, not the bubble-head victims of many 80s cartoons. This is a truly engaging series, and inspires people to do the right thing no matter what.  The DVD has great image and sound quality.

*Please note that the DVD image used to describe this product is actually an image of the UK version, not the North American version.",1340236800,3,460,4.654320987654321
3880563,4,B0029RB9GQ,"I was a little worried that this might not be a real copy as the cover did not look the same as in the picture. But I plays fine, picture quality looks great, and are enjoying these cartoons again.",1331856000,,197,4.076923076923077

3880565,5,B0029RB9GQ,"I got this for my brother for Christmas, we used to watch it as kids.  He absolutely loved it and so did I! We watched the whole thing and it was just as fun and catchy as I remember.  I only wish there were more than one season!",1293408000,,229,3.75
3880566,5,B0029RB9GQ,"Bucky O'Hare is a character, created by comic writer Larry Hama between 1978 and 1979, who was the eponymous hero of a comic book series, as well as a number of spin-offs, including a TV series and various toys and games.

Neal Adams is currently working on Bucky O'Hare movie project.

I think it WILL BE excellent, if Bucky O'Hare gets released in America, in a 2-disc set, including 13 episodes, to tie in with the Bucky O'Hare movie that may air in the future.

Please release Bucky O'Hare in America, and during the production of the film!",1255046400,,544,4.530612244897959

8358139,4,B0029RB9GQ,Been looking for this for a long time. Glad to see that at least it did come out on DVD but was a little disappointed at there being no special features. Still brings back the good ole days though,1376611200,,196,4.051282051282051
8358140,4,B0029RB9GQ,"I had no idea there was a Bucky O' Hare DVD set.  I was excited that it was released!  It is a shame there was no bonus material or features on this DVD.  It is just each 23-25 minute, 13 episodes divided among 2 disc.  No captions or ability to skip half the show.  That means you have to fast forward or rewind if you want to see your favorite scene if it is in the 14-15 minute mark.  If you push the skip button, it skips to the next episode.  I just hope another company picks up this series and add some extras, or heck even reboot this series.  I remember vividly this cartoon was eye catching due to is war like nature and fights.  It stood out.  Why it didn't last longer then 1 season confuses me!  Pick this DVD up before it goes out of print!",1366070400,,754,3.9932885906040267
8358141,1,B0029RB9GQ,as far as i know this dvd set never made it to the united states. i know it was released over seas as a region 2 dvd but never released in the states. i seen this and check up with tvshowsondvd website and there was nothing about it being released here.,1360972800,2,253,3.980392156862745
8358142,4,B0029RB9GQ,"I am happy to have the whole set.
My son loved the series when he was little.
I was a little disappointed in the quality of the videos.
They look like old videos transferred to CD's.",1358035200,3,182,4.083333333333333
8358143,5,B0029RB9GQ,I wish they would of used the pal cover art instead of the ugly North American but still the show is just as amazing as I remembered it even though there is no bonus features it's a blast!!!,1357257600,,190,4.026315789473684
8358144,4,B0029RB9GQ,"First off, I'm very happy to have this in my collection. Brings back good memories :)
I give it 4 stars for a couple different reasons. The case arrived broken and the discs obtained quite a few surface scratches. Fortunately it plays perfectly. So I can't be that mad about it. Quality of the cartoon is decent, but not the greatest. Better than other dvd comps of shows from the 80's and 90's.... other than that, I'm happy with it (plus I got it 3 days earlier than expected).",1357084800,,479,4.393258426966292
8358145,5,B0029RB9GQ,"I spent a couple of years trying to remember a cartoon I used to watch as a kid. Eventually I ran across it and found out it was called Bucky O'Hare. I found out only one season was made, so I didn't think it was going to be on DVD, but I looked anyway. To my suprise, I found it here on Amazon. I ordered it immediately. There are no thrills to this set, no special features, no history of the show, nothing. Just the original 13 episodes. All that considered, it is still a great show who's story is still interesting today (though you can tell the theme song was definately made in the 90s). Considering the obscurity of this show, I'm still just amazed that it has been put on DVD. That's why I gave it 5 stars.",1353542400,3,715,4.114285714285714
8358146,5,B0029RB9GQ,"In 1990, I was eight years old and watched this series in repeats over and over every morning before going to school. And then it disappeared, and nobody ever talked about it again outside of ""oh yeah, that was the green rabbit show, right?""

Yes, the animation is dated, and no, it doesn't hold up to newer cartoons -- but with its unique story and its creative team, I'm really glad this series is finally getting the DVD release it deserves. There are no extras on this set, just the episodes of the show itself, but that's okay. It's one of the best series of the 90s that has been sorely missed by its fans, and now we can own it.",1353456000,,635,4.24793388429752
8358147,4,B0029RB9GQ,"I've been wanting this series ever since my vhs copies finally died on me, so I speak the truth when I say this was a fantastic find.  But be warned, this is the series and nothing else.  No frills, no interviews, no bonus content whatsoever.  And truthfully the artwork on the box looks like something I'd expect on a bootleg.  Don't get me wrong, the episodes still look good, and the sound doesn't skip so if you were a fan of the series it is what you get.  I just think that for $30+ they could have given us more, at the very least better box art and making the video better.  That's the only reason this lost a star.  But beggars can't be choosers, and this series needed a collection made of it.",1341964800,6,703,4.201492537313433
