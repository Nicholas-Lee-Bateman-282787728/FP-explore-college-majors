556098,5,6303094856,"The Frim series delivers what few others can...and its promise of visible results in ten workouts is not hype.  That said, this is one of the tapes in the series I come back to.  The segments are quick and having two instructors helps to break up the tape mentally.  The instructors are cheerful, but never annoying and the setting is bright. While the moves are simple, they are also quite effective.
In response to criticism tht the tape is dated, I would say that many of the Firm tapes are dated by their choice of costume, but barely.  Their outfits were tasteful to begin with, not trendy.  And while no tape is perfect, this one is close! Definately worth the money!",1024358400,3,673,4.528925619834711

556100,5,6303094856,"I LOVE ""FIRM IV"" aka ""Time-Crunch Workout"".  I am a FIRM Believer from Day One when we sent the Company [money] BEFORE the videos were made!!  I've had to buy this video 3 different times because I wore each copy out!!  Susan Harris and the FIRM Classics are the best FIRM videos ever!!  I LOVE Kai's fast step and weight segments...my husband always laughs because I groan and say, ""Please Kai, no more!!""  But it is my favorite part of the video.  The very TOUGH ab segment at the end with Susan is a killer!!  I have 5-Day Abs and Tough Aerobic Mix just to do those segments again!!  You definitely get a workout in only 42 minutes; but I stop at Kai's sort of silly ending ""cool-down"" segment, too.  I would recommend FIRM Upper Body for more variety  for heavy upper weight work, especially weighted pecs.  But for FUN and VARIETY and TOUGHNESS, get this video!!  As a matter of fact, get TWO, since this is unfortunately not available anywhere else, and you WILL wear the tape out by using it so much!!",1015632000,15,1008,4.418478260869565
556101,5,6303094856,"This is the FIRM ""Volume Four"" tape, reincarnated as the Time-Crunch Workout.  Of the fifteen-plus FIRM tapes I own, this is my favorite for a total body workout (I think Firm Parts / Five Day Abs is my overall favorite, but what's not to like about workouts that last only six minutes?)  Why oh why is this no longer being produced?  This is such a fantastic tape.  It's short (42 minute workout), effective, fun.  It was the first tape to introduce the step up box, which is taller & narrower than the plastic stacking steps used in traditional step aerobics classics.  Thus, the moves are slower, more deliberate, and frankly, more effective than your average step aerobics.
I love the FIRM series, and this is the best of the best.  I started buying the FIRM tapes back in 1989 when they were fifty bucks a pop.  At one point, I had nearly sixty exercise videos, but I found that as my collection grew, I would ALWAYS choose a FIRM over Jane Fonda, Denise Austin, Kathy Smith, Jazzercise -- so most of those, though they were good, went to Salvation Army.  AFter doing the FIRM workouts, other workouts just seemed silly, all hoppy and bouncy, and not particularly effective.  THe first six FIRM tapes are superior -- some of the later tapes have been cut and pasted from early workouts, and they aren't quite as slickly-produced as the first run tapes.  I think that this is the best of the first six.  If you can get this somewhere, or find a used ""Volume Four,"" grab it; I don't think you'll be disappointed.  If not, grab one of the currently-available FIRM tapes in the interim & keep your eyes open for this one.",994464000,25,1622,4.5326460481099655
556102,5,6303094856,this is a great total body video! I used this video along with the other firm total body volumes (1-6). I recommened that you start out slowly!,992736000,,143,4.333333333333333
556103,5,6303094856,"I am a lifelong PE Refugee who would still be a slug if it weren't for my ""party animal"" aerobic tapes. But the year I turned 40, I realized it was time to get serious about strength training! While I had dabbled with other toning tapes, I really wanted to try the FIRM tapes. Upon some recommendations from friends at a popular fitness video review website, this one was my very first FIRM purchase. One month after I'd been using it, three or four people asked me if I'd lost weight. (I hadn't--but my clothes were a little looser). The only other workout that's ever done anything like that for me is Kathy Smith's Weight Loss Workout (which is 35 minutes of aerobics and 16 minutes of toning with light weights). ! But even more than the changes in my body's looks, I was excited about how this workout increased what I could DO! My upper body and my back were stronger than they'd ever been--even when the heaviest  weights I used were 10 pounds on each side. Three months after starting this routine 2-3 times a week, I found that my muscles were strong enough to do longer and more intense cardio routines.  Cross training really helped me take it to the next level.
The workout itself is about 40-42 minutes in length, which should appeal to the leisure-challenged among us:) Susan and Kai take turns leading different sections, plus you rotate five minutes of heavy weight work with five minutes of very basic aerobics or slow-paced step aerobics. The repetitions for most of the heaviest moves such as squats are broken up and rotated with other exercises. Nothing like a little variety to keep you interested! You're busy ALL the time, so the workout seems shorter than it really is. But don't let the short length fool you. You can make this as easy or as hard as you want by the size weights you choose for the moves. If you use the heaviest weights possible for you, you will definitely know you've worked out. Or if you're not up to par, you can always go with lighter weights for a day and still maintain your exercise habit!
The set is beautiful, and so is the cast. I'm usually too busy moaning and groaning to pay attention to them, though. The music is pleasant--some jazz, a little new age or neo-classical, sychronized very nicely with the routines. There are a couple of numbers, though, that sound like 1950's burlesque music. One of them is performed by a horn section with more brass than class. Apologies to tuba enthusiasts everywhere, but I think tubas sound hilarious. All you have to do is say the word ""tuba"" and I start cracking up. Well, guess which instrument has the flatulating solo on this song? But at least it comes at the end of the toughest sequence of the tape, when I'm ready for a good laugh.
Speaking of laughs, the last couple of minutes or so of the routine, after you've stretched and are all mellowed out, for some strange reason Kai takes center stage again and leads you through this little cheerleader-type dance routine.  My internet fitness buddies and I refer to this as the Dork Dance.  It's totally anacronistic and out of place at that point in the routine, and Heaven only knows what the Benson sisters were thinking when they put it there.  I tried it a time or two, but just thought, ""this is stupid"" and then decided to just exercise my stomach muscles some more by laughing at it. You just gotta love the FIRM--they're masters at the unintentional humor!
Both Susan and Kai are very elegant and classy-looking. Kai is a joy to watch--she even looks good doing squats and hoisting those heavy weights. I happen to love Susan, too--and her wonderful accent. (It's nice to see and hear a fellow Southerner in action!) However, she has multiple personalities that change with the workout segments. She's really sweet and soft-spoken during the stretches and cool-down, a drill sergeant during the pushups--""PUSH!!!""--and serious most of the rest of the time. I must warn you--there are a couple of places where she really seems to get an endorphin rush--or something--from working out. If this were a 1940's movie, I'd expect her to light up a cigarette in the next frame!
I do hope they'll bring this one back to life someday.  If you can find a copy for sale on an online auction or here at Amazon.com, grab it.  It's a good deal. . .",987033600,30,4296,4.5859375
556104,5,6303094856,"I definitely recommend this video to anyone that does not want to do neither an hour long workout nor a thirty minute workout. It is only 42 minutes. Even though the workout is only 42 minutes long, it has a lot of intensity during those minutes.
BTW, I decided to squat side to side whenever Kai did that on the short box in the video. Even though requires the use of a short box, there are ways that people who do not have a short box could do some of the movements on the floor.",978307200,2,481,4.073684210526316
556250,5,6303094856,"Good short total body workout. This workout is not for beginners.  You will need a step and weights (ankle, 5, 8, 10 pounds)",1393200000,,124,4.391304347826087
556251,5,6303094856,"I had this way back as a VHS tape and I got down about giving up all of my FIRM tapes.  However I started buying mostly the used old FIRM DVDs, as they are the BEST of them all, this year.  I was happy to see the Time Crunch workout and man what a workout it is!

This is a complete circuit training with cardio and weights workout to include adding the step up box.  It is a constant movement through the whole workout with no time to rest.  Susan Harris was the toughest of them all in my opinion in regards to the old FIRM workouts.  It is a nice combination between the two instructors resulting in a full body workout.  I really worked my legs out and I think it's because the step box was used in like 3 of the exercises I believe it was.

Susan Harris kept a constant movement/pressure on the abs during that section so it was more challenging.  Her stretching session was pretty thorough I thought but then when Kai got up at the end to do that little dance routine I thought that was completely unnecessary and it really made no sense so I skipped that part.  This is one of the best FIRM faster pace complete 42 minute workout, you will not be disappointed if you get this!  Oh just noticed they upped the amount to a 'classic' price range, I'm glad I got this a week ago when it was much cheaper!",1383696000,,1307,4.146825396825397

I have been lifting weights at a gym, and I was a bit sore in some spots because it works every muscle group, and I have not been doing that at the gym. It is also a quick way to hit all the groups.

556258,5,6303094856,"I first got this tape in the '90s, and it is the absolute best. In 45 minutes you'll workout every major muscle group while getting the cardio you need. I haven't seen too many of the newer Firm workouts, but one of the best things about the older ones is their low ""impact-ness"". I have a couple of herniated disks and jumping is not in my repertoire anymore, but this workout is really manageable.

If you're new to working out, begin by doing about half of what you think you can do, with absolutely NO weights. This is a challenging video, and you will be limping if you overdo it. The Firm are quite serious workouts, which is one of their major assets, in my opinion. This tape has no filler time--it's all purposeful all the time. Don't skip the warm up or the stretching, as it's all important.

I've worn out my first tape and haven't been able to use it in a couple of years. I'm soooo happy to find it again--this time I'll take it to be converted to DVD because it's my all time favourite workout. I promise if you work up to the whole tape and so it a dozen times, you'll be hooked, and you'll see your body change and feel so much better. While I recommend switching workouts for muscle confusion, even if this was the only one you ever do you'll be in great shape. Enjoy!!",1305331200,,1287,4.270491803278689

It may work, but there is no way I would want to work out and become this obsessed.

The workout is solid and time-efficient as promised. The only drawbacks are the very dated looking outfits and somewhat cheesy music.

556308,5,6303094856,"I've had this video since it first came out in the days when you paid in advance and waited for them to be done.  I'd like to tell you I've used it consistently since then, but I'm afraid I've spent nearly as many years on the sofa as I have in consistent exercise.

However, when I am exercising, this is one of my favorite exercise routines.  It's tough enough that I usually work my way up to having the stamina and strength to use it when I resume exercising and I always get a good sweat from it.  I'll be honest and admit that I've recently decided that the first three original Firm videos - Volumes 1, 2 and 3, may be excellent work-outs, but they're too much for me, especially now that I'm getting close to hitting 50.

The sets of working out with weights are broken up by sections of quick, relatively low impact cardio routines.  The tape moves by quickly, with good cueing from both instructors and fun music that I often find myself humming later.  While I sometimes dread the tough tapes, I find myself looking forward to using this one.  I used to think the 42 minute length was the reason I used it so frequently, but I really believe it's because the routine is such a good one.  When you're done, you feel worked out, but not ready to be laid out.

Others that I like are Maximum Body Shaping (with Tracie Long) and Super Body Sculpt.  Buying and trying most of The Firm ""videos"" produced after the initial 6 and finding many are great.",1139097600,2,1456,4.3357933579335795

This workout is good for the ""pro"" or an ""amateur"".  Be careful when you start:  pace yourself if you're fit, and, if you're just starting to exercise then:  don't use any weights and only do about half of each routine at first, then build up gradually.  You really do see results quickly.  As you become more fit you can use heavier weights to continue progress.

I'm sure she's pretty embarrassed about it now when she looks at it years later. My husband and I were laughing so much watching it!!

But OMG, what a fabulous workout and in only 45 minutes...probably because they use heavy weights and the step. You pretty much get the same workout quality as Susan Harris' Vol 1 tape, which is 60 minutes long and also a killer.

If you're new to the Firm please realize that this tape, though a great workout, will take some getting used to.  The changes between sets are QUICK and the moves - especially Kai's - are FAST.  Don't get frustrated, it will take doing the tape 5, 10 times before you will be able to stay with them the entire time.  That's the down side of all of the Firm's tapes. The up side is that once you know the tape, you won't get bored being taught the same move for the umteenth time (or hear that darned joke again), you'll just get on with your workout.

By the way, even though I'm in good shape, I still found some of these exercises too challenging.  I recommend that beginners use a shorter step (6"" rather than 10-14"") for Kai's kick-your-butt segments and use half the weight that Susan recomends in her segments.",1093564800,4,904,4.351190476190476

I don't care about production sets or hairdos of the instructors, I care about results, and I get it with this tape. Susan and Kai give great cues and the footwork isn't too dancy for me on a ten inch step. The workout is short enough, yet is tough and motivating, and you can grow with it by increasing weight size as you grow stronger, as with all Firm videos. It works out just about every muscle group and the abs section is tough. I admit I stopped exercising for many years but went back about a year ago and I credit this tape ( along with walking and a balanced diet) for a 50 pound weight loss and I only do it 3 to 4 times a week.

556454,4,6303094856,"I finally bought this tape after reading the reviews on Amazon.com. I agree, this is a great overall tape, for those who have little time to spare. The tape lasts a little over 40 mins. and you will sweat too. The music, and the clothing are of course outdated, but the routine is easy, and the instructor's are easy to understand. After the next day, I was a little sore.
After doing this video on a regular day I am left energized, not overly tired or exerted, which is nice. I only own one other video by the Firm and that's the Super Cardio Split on dvd (full of fast pacing foot moves, a definite cardio burner)and that one will leave you feeling tired, weak and sore.
But, don't be fooled this work out will make you sweat, and you will still get the ""feeling"" that you did something good for your body.
I would definitely recommend this (if you can overlook the garish clothing and music) for those days that you're not feeling so energized but still want to kick some butt!",1035849600,6,981,4.366120218579235
556455,5,6303094856,"I have many Firm videos, and this is one of my favorites.  It often works two areas of the body at once, so I really feel like I've done myself some good in a short amount of time.",1033516800,,180,3.736842105263158
556456,5,6303094856,"Holy smokes this video is good!  The aerobic sections working with the step and weights is really quite intense!  Being at an advanced fitness level (running 6 milse, cycling 50+ miles weekly, as well as doing lots of the Firm videos), I found this video to be quite challenging.  The first time I did this I had to work with very light weights.  I highly recommend it as an addition to many of the other Firm videos.  It is shorter and more aerobics oriented than the others.  Also the aerobics of this video is superior to the other aerobic sections in the other Firm videos I have (like the Tortoise and Hare videos).",1030665600,7,620,4.442477876106195
556457,5,6303094856,"I loved doing the Time Crunch workout. I loved everything about it: the music (sometimes I find myself humming the tunes while working out), the short aerobic segments (my favorite is the tri-star), Susan Harris (the legendary original instructor in my opinion),& best of all, the dance finale! I actually rewinded the tape back once to do it again because it was so much fun! This also shows that yes, exercise is serious, but hey, you work your [rear] out for about 45 minutes,so why not have a little fun while you're at it? I too,find myself going back to this tape. It's great to do either in the morning (a quick workout to get you energized and started on your day),or at night (if you have a little bit of energy left).TIME CRUNCH WORKOUT RULES! SUSAN HARRIS RULES!! I wonder how come she's no longer working at the Firm. She makes Jane Fonda look like a [wimp]!",1030320000,6,870,4.512658227848101
556458,4,6303094856,"This is a good overall workout for the intermediate to advanced exerciser.  It has a mix of aerobic and weight training sequences.  Susan Harris is an excellent instructor, but extremely thin to the point of looking anorexic.  Perhaps that is why they have obviously retouched her photo on the video case.  Kia (sp?) does the aerobic sequences and is not the best at cueing upcoming moves.  I think The Firm has improved their teaching of aerobic sequences in later videos.  This is obviously an earlier, less polished effort.  I will say that Kia is obviously a gifted dancer.
Despite these small criticisms and observations, I find myself going back to this tape time and time again for several reasons  1. mix of aerobics and weight training  2. good intruction from Susan Harris  3. strong abs section  4. great workout in 42 minutes.",1028505600,22,838,4.830985915492958
556459,3,6303094856,"This Firm video makes for a great, quick workout.  I purchased this tape because I needed something short, and this really fits the bill.  However, when I first watched it, I was dismayed at the awful music, and poor production values.  You can see the boom mikes hanging down in front of the camera many, many times!  There are also blue screens behind the ""doors"" on the set that were never changed into any kind of scenery.
I really get into a tape when the music is fun & upbeat, but this stuff is odd, not always appropriate for the movements & just plain awful!
If this kind of stuff is important to you (which I didn't think was that important to me, but is!), there are many other Firm tapes that may be better.
BUT, I have to say, that the workout is still good, and I've enjoyed adding extra weights as I've gone along.  It's just hard to make myself do this tape when I've got other, newer ones that give me less of a headache to look at.",1027900800,4,949,4.220994475138122
556460,4,6303094856,"This, like all the other Firm tapes, provides an excellent workout.  I, however, found that the combination moves, e.g. doing overhead presses in conjunction with step ups, required more coordination than I have, and to do these would have risked injury from losing balance during the step ups.  By electing to do these moves separately, it defeated the ""time crunch"" of the original workout.  Other excercisers, who do not suffer from the same balance problems, would find this workout very effective.",1027555200,2,502,5.172839506172839
556461,5,6303094856,"Yes, the hair and costumes look like 1990, but the moves, sequencing, tight choreography, and excellent production quality make this video timeless.
Susan Harris and Kai Soremekun provide excellent cueing in this no-nonsense but entertaining workout. Short sets with heavy weights, alternating with aerobic segments, give a great, complete workout in minimum time. The ab section is innovative and very effective. The cooldown/stretch is wonderful, and the optional ""dance"" at the end is just plain fun. Composer Marc Aramian wrote the music specifically for this and the other original 6 Firm videos. It's perfectly synchronized, so you don't have to listen to monotonous ""gym music"" or deal with music that doesn't match up with the instructor's moves.
I have more exercise videos than I care to admit to, but when I want RESULTS, I always go back to the Firm.",1027468800,21,862,5.164285714285715
