4130928,4,B003JMJ5WU,"GREAT MOVIE!!! GREAT INSIGHT INTO THE EVENTS LEADING UP TO 'Fist Of The North Star'...SURPRISES AROUND EVERY CORNER. THE DIVERSE STYLE OF CHARACTERS WERE SIMPLY AMAZING. THE ANIMATION IS EXCELLENT & SMOOTH. THE MUSIC IS GREAT. I HAVE ONLY 3 'minor' COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS MOVIE. 1) they don't show the fight between RAOH & SHIN. 2) they don't show RAOH kill RYUKEN. 3) when does RAOH hair turn black???... BESIDES THAT, THIS IS A MUST BUY FOR F.O.T.N.S. & ANIME FANS EVERYWHERE. OFFICIALLY NOW IN MY TOP 5 JAPANESE ANIME OF ALL TIME.",1401580800,,532,4.731182795698925
4130929,5,B003JMJ5WU,I loved it it came fast an on time less than a week. I suggest if you like the dark King series I think you should get it you will not be disappointed.,1355702400,,151,3.606060606060606
4130930,4,B003JMJ5WU,"First of all, let me say that I'm not a fan of Fist of The North Star.  As such, I had very low expectations for this series.  However, watching it both subbed and with the English dub I found it much more enjoyable than I expected.  The animation is dark and gritty, and as such actually looks a bit older than what it really is.  However, the lack of vibrant colors does seem to suit it.  Otherwise, the series is well animated and the story is enjoyable.  It actually managed to make Raoh a sympathetic character, compared to his role in Fist of the North Star.

Also, pay close attention when you purchase this.  There have been three releases total.  The first DVD set from 2009 is sub-only.  Later, Sentai Filmworks went back and dubbed the series and released it again on both DVD and Blu Ray.  The DVD set that has the same cover as the bluray set is the one that is bilingual.  It still includes the original language, if that's your preference.  The dub is expertly cast and quite good, so I highly recommend it.

Overall, the show wasn't the best, but it managed to pull of what it was aiming for.  It's definitely worth a try.",1318723200,3,1138,4.352380952380952
4130931,3,B003JMJ5WU,"i really enjoyed the Fist of the North Star (FotNS) series.  having introduced to it by the movie, i hunted down the series to watch the whole shebang and it was worth it.  it had it's annoyances, but the overall arc of it was well done enough for me to give the series a solid 5 stars *****!

note that i try to omit spoilers and i apologize if any get in by accident.

so, what is the Legends of the Dark King (LotDK) about?  Raoh, the central figure of this series, is a very popular character and a series dealing with him seems to be quite reasonable to flesh out the story.  where did he get his horse?  what was he doing while Kenshiro is out there doing good things?  what drove Raoh and changed him to become the unstoppable force that he is?  who are his two assistants, Souga and Reina?  um, wait, never mind that last one.

it's been a while since i have seen the original series, but i don't recall any Souga and Reina.  ok, so they added new characters, not a big deal at all as long as it makes it better.  problem is, it didn't.  and that is the main problem i have with the Legends of the Dark King series.  it changes things or adds things that do not necessarily make it better.  if they had, i would have welcomed them with open arms.

the new characters of Souga and Reina... why are they there?  they're sort of a fighting version of Bat (sans humor but, has a rocket leg) and Lynn (all grown up with swords).  i'm not sure why they're bothering to help Raoh.  their relationship is hinted at, but it was a weak connection to me.  well, the bigger problem is, why does the invincible Raoh need or want these two underlings?  Raoh only needs himself.  then, there's Sakuya, who was not in the manga, to add another dimension to the story.  i found her to be vaguely interesting at first, but by the end, she was more annoying than anything else.  so, too many bland new characters, not enough Raoh.

the music in the original series was really fitting and enjoyable.  both ridiculous and melodramatic - just like the series.  the music in LotDK is totally forgettable.  i highly recommend getting the soundtracks to FotNS if you can.  so, bland music.

the art is based on the manga drawn by Yuko Osada (you can see him in the bonus featurette) and of course, it is re-imagined.  problem is, we now get generic style mixed with DragonballZ, last airbender and Cowboy Bebop (Spike Spiegel is in LotDK, i swear).  any of those by themselves would be fine but, it just seems derivative here when FotNS already has a strong style tradition.  i mean, Raoh has a very characteristic forehead... why get rid of it and make Raoh look like a teenager?  at first, i thought it was because LotDK was a prequel of some sort, but it really isn't.  it is parallel to the FotNS series.  again, in my opinion, the art changes were not for the better.  FotNS was totally ridiculous and over the top.  LotDK looks like any other generic anime that comes out.  so, bland art.

the storyline is very uneventful.  while the series is only 13 episodes, that should be enough to have some epic battles.  but, alas, no.  it is a lot of exposition (which FotNS also had) with tiny amounts of battles (which FotNS had gobs and gibs of).  in fact, Raoh seems to be barely in the storyline.  many of the episodes deal with Souga, Reina and Sakuya with Raoh making cameo appearances to mutter a few lines like, ""I will go straight through the enemy.""  one basic problem is that Raoh's story doesn't have a major foe (other than Kenshiro which is FotNS).  so it lacks that drama as you know Raoh will totally and easily crush anyone he meets.  well, except Raoh's final fight which conveniently and unsatisfactorily ends.  i won't bother with nitpicking with things like, Raoh can blast holes through mountains, why is he standing outside an iron wall unable to get in?  i did like Raoh's battle against ""Pluto"" which was interesting.  so, bland overall story line.

very little ridiculous and over the top violence and campy lines.  this is FotNS where Kenshiro says things like ""dahdahdahdahdahdahdahdahdahDAH!"" and ""You are already dead."" with total conviction.  when two heroes battle in FotNS, it is a meeting of titans.  what the heck happened in LotDK?  you may see a standoff...  things are looking good, but then, they talk it over and nothing happens.  argh! a tease of a battle.  and not sure how others feel, but i don't want to see Souga and Reina fight b/c they really don't have any special martial arts.  they're just very good at kicks and swordfighting.  i want to see more of Raoh using Hokuto Shinken.  the best fights are done by Ryuga whose blows are so powerful, they rip out chunks of his victims.  very bland fights overall with a couple of exceptions.

if you really really like FotNS and you need a further helping of the series, this helps as long as you don't expect too much.  the bluray quality was quite good and the english subs were very well done.  the video is widescreen (currently, the aspect ratio in the specs at amazon is incorrect).  the audio options are english dub or japanese with english subs.  it also had a japanese featurette (with english subs) that showed some of the dubbing process as well as short interviews with voice actors and others.  i always find it pretty remarkable how the voice actors really take their craft seriously in Japan.  overall production of the bluray set is very well done.

this is a great time to be a fan of FotNS.  i highly recommend the new sets being released currently as well as the movie.  if you really need more, LotDK can help.",1289260800,5,5608,4.469367588932807
4130932,4,B003JMJ5WU,"When I saw ""Legend of the Dark Kings"" on an anime channel, it looked like a stand alone series.  Part way through, I realized I kept hearing ""North Star"" and ""South Star"", and even ""Fairy Star"".  (No kidding, but that's a plot point I won't belabor.)  Finally, I looked it up, and found out this is a side-story for ""Fist of the North Star"".  Aha!

My teen-aged daughter and I watched this, and were impressed by the artwork, and the way over the top voice acting.  The constant references to Raoh as ""The King of Fist"" were startling at first, and became funnier as the series progressed.  (BTW, Raoh's original title in Japanese is ""Ken-Oh"", which is much less amusing.)  One exchange between Raoh and another martial artist was just *wrong*:

  Other Guy:  ""Do you wish to trade blows?""
  Raoh:  ""Yes.""
  Other Guy:  (rushing to attack) ""I come!""

Lordy.  There are just some things that should be translated a bit different.  My daughter had to have me stop the playback she was laughing so hard.  It wasn't just the lines, but the earnest manliness with which they were delivered that was so funny.  These aren't the only examples in the series, either, so it sounds like the translation just wasn't given the effort it should have been, which is the reason I docked it a star.

As what it is, essentially a fighting anime, but a seinen (adult) one, the fight scenes and the sheer bloody brutality are quite interesting and engaging.  The characters are not terribly deep in their motivations, with one or two exceptions, but I don't think of Raoh as evil.  He sees a ravaged, post-Apocalyptic world, and all the murderous glee of the strong preying on the weak, and decides to change it by uniting the world.  United in fear of The King of Fist's unstoppable Divine Fist of the North Star, and his oppressive reign, but at least his intentions were noble to begin with.  He's definitely a villain, but not entirely as black-hearted as he's being made out to be.

The stories are interesting, and not as predictable as you might think.  The music is grandiose and pompous, while still effective and a little stirring.  The animation is pretty good, far better than most of the refuse shown on Saturday morning for years.

I haven't seen ""Fist of the North Star"" in years, and never saw the whole thing, only a few eps, but I think this is an excellent companion to the original series.  Bottom line is that if you like fighting anime, or Fist of the North Star, you should check this out.",1280534400,2,2493,4.580498866213152
4130933,4,B003JMJ5WU,"In 1983, the manga ""Hokuto no Ken"" (Fist of the North Star) was unleashed in Japan.  Illustrated by Tetsuo Hara and written by Buronson, the manga went on from 1983-1988 and has spawned anime TV series, two films, OAV's, novels, video games and more.

Needless to say, in Japan, this series has been a staple of storylines that has touched Japanese pop culture showcasing good vs. evil as the series focused on a post-apocalyptic era in which the world now unstable with fear across the land. Where power is justice and power ruled.  Those without power are left in fear.  Those who have power command great armies or a ragtag group of the men who have succumbed to evil.

""Hokuto no Ken"" featured four adoptive brothers who were taught the ""Hokuto Shinken"" (aka ""God Fist of the North Star"").  The four are eldest brother Raoh, Toki, Jagi and Kenshiro.  With the main storyline focusing on the eldest, Raoh and the youngest Kenshiro.  In the ""Hokuto no Ken"" (Fist of the North Star) series, Kenshiro has been chosen as the successor to Hokuto Shinken, a martial art that is 18-centuries old and involves using the body's 708 vital pressure points to either destroy or heal a person from within.  Kenshiro is a man who is in love with Julia and instead of having a happy life, his evil brother Jagi uses his influence over Shin, who controls the rival to ""Hokuto Shinken"" known as Nanto Seiken (aka Sacred Fist of the South Star).  If Hokuto Shinken is the Yin, Nanto Seiken is the Yang.  Two can't exist without each other.

Earlier on, Shin has defeated Kenshiro but given a chance to live when Julia gives herself to Shin in order to rescue Kenshiro.  Because of this pain, Kenshiro has learned from sorrow and vowed to get better, fight alongside the people and defeat evil.  Meanwhile, his brother Raoh is the opposite. Jealous that his younger brother was chosen as successor, his goal is to conquer lands using his power and rule the world with fear, having not experienced sorrow.

Raoh can be seen like a Japan equivalent to Darth Vader, Cobra Commander or Megatron.  Villains with power and despite being evil, their fan following is tremendous.  In fact, he's so popular that back in 2007, a mock funeral was held for the character in order to promote the theatrical release of ""Raoh Den Gekito no Sho"" (a retelling of the final battle between Kenshiro vs. Raoh).  And thousands of people attended the mock funeral, and many genuinely mourned Raoh as a man who touched their lives (despite not being a real person).

With the popularity of Raoh, a 13-episode series based on the 2006-2007 manga by Youkow Osada (""Gear Rally"", ""Toto"", ""TRIBAL12') was created to show how Raoh alongside Souga and Reina, and later a few other key members of his army known as ""Kingdom of the Fist"" were able to take on other evil/powerful sects around the country and completely drive fear around the world.

The series featured anime production by Satelight (""Geneshaft"", ""Heat Guy J"", ""Macross Zero"", ""Genesis of Aquarion"", ""Hellsing Ultimate"", etc.) and was directed by Masashi Abe (""Blue Gender"", ""Solty Rei"", ""Tokko"", """"Inuyasha"", etc.), a screenplay by Hiroshi Ohnogi (""Aquarion"", ""Arjuna"", ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"", ""Macross Zero"", etc.) and character designs by Hirotaka Marufuji (""Death Note"", ""Pokemon: Arceus and the Jewel of Life"").

The series would primarily focus on Raoh and give us a perspective of his side of the story and despite being a villain, he is the protagonist of the series and we see how he eventually becomes a demon.

The main characters of ""Legends of the Dark King: A Fist of the North Star Story"" are:

  * Raoh - The eldest of the adoptive brothers who were trained by Ryuken, the previous Hokuto Shinken master.  Wants to be the greatest martial artist in the world but is jealous that his younger adoptive brother Kenshiro was chosen as successor to the Hokuto Shinken.  Also, the woman he loved, Julia, has chosen Kenshiro.  Refusing to give up the Hokuto Shinken style, he has taken the name Ken-Oh (King of Fist) and together with childhood friends Souga and Reina, the three take part in developing one of the most feared armies in the land.  Bringing fear to everyone around them.
  * Souga - Raoh's strategist.  Known as Souga the Swift Footed for his incredible speed and Songshan Whirlwind Kick, he assists Raoh in developing the King of Fist army.
  * Reina - Sister of Souga and the female captain of the Royal Guards.  She is known as Reina of the Twin Blades and is fantastic with her swordsmanship.  Although, Raoh and Souga accept their demonic side in conquering the world, she has a compassion because deep inside, she cares for Raoh and loves him.
  * Sakuya - The mysterious woman who becomes the tactician for the King of Fist Army.  Deadly, mysterious and becomes a rival to Reina for the attention of Raoh.
  * Ryuga - Master of the Taishan Heavenly Wolf Fist and the right hand man of Raoh.  Fast, furious and incredibly deadly, earlier on, he is a rival to Souga.
  * Ulghur - A convicted killer who the prison warden at Cassandra have tried to execute five times but he has survived each execution.  Seeing his potential, Raoh makes Ulghur the warden of Cassandra and using the city as a prison.
  * Toki - One of the four adoptive brothers that learned the Hokuto Shinken but unlike Raoh, chooses not to fight and uses his martial art technique to heal people.  Because he is knows the destructive power of Hokuto  Shinken, Raoh wants Toki to join him at his side of the King of Fist army but Toki will never do such thing.  His goal is if he ever runs into his adoptive brother Kenshiro, he will work with him.  Because of that, Raoh has Toki imprisoned in Cassandra.

VIDEO & AUDIO QUALITY:

""Legends of the Dark King: A Fist of the North Star Story"" is presented in 16:9 Anamorphic Widescreen.  Hirotaka Marufuji wanted to make sure that the artwork of the series was close to Youkow Osada's manga with the strong black lines and corners and curves were represented well.  For the most part, because the era takes place in a post-apocalyptic setting, you can see there was quite a difference between the blue skies and vibrant setting before the war and now the grayish atmosphere after the war.  But overall, animation was good and there is emphasis on dark strokes around the characters and a detail on the ravaged backgrounds.

Despite being a television series, there is still a good amount of severed limbs and bloody violence in the series.  Not as hyper-detailed as what we would see in a ""Hokuto no Ken"" OVA series or film but still, good amount of violence which is expected from a ""Hokuto no Ken"" related title.

As for audio, the series is featured in Japanese with English subtitles.  Audio is featured in Japanese 5.1 Dolby Digital and there were some scenes where destruction can be heard through the surrounds and certain music that lingered on via LFE that had my subwoofers going for a bit.  But for the most part, the series is front and center channel driven.  Dialogue is easy to understand and for the most part, voice talent did a good job.  Takashi Ukaji who has done the voice of Raoh in the previous live-action film and film series does a great job.  The series also features well known voice talents such as Mai Nakahara (who plays Reina), known for doing the voices for May Wong in ""Kaleido Star"", Nagisa Furukawa in ""Clannad"", Eina in ""Gravion"", Mai Tokiha in ""My Hime"" and ""My-Otome"" and many other series.  Masaya Matsukaze (who plays Souga) who has done the voices of Blues in ""Rockman. EXE"", Hirsche in ""Gunslinger Girl -Il Teatrino-"" and Daisuke Aurora in ""Heat Guy J"" to name a few.  Overall, voice talent did a superb job!

For those wanting an English dub track, this anime series does not offer one.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Legends of the Dark King: A Fist of the North Star Story"" comes with the following Special Features

JUDGMENT CALL:

DISC 1: Clean Opening and Closing theme and Sentai Filmworks Trailers

DISC 2: Behind the Scenes of Legends of the Dark King - (28:04) An episode of ""The Hobby World Project"" hosted by actress Ayumi Beppu.  The episode is about how Ayumi Beppu visiting the creators of ""Legends of the Dark King: A Fist of the North Star Story"", how she became a voice actress on an episode and interviews with the crew and voice talent of the anime series.

""Legends of the Dark King: A Fist of the North Star Story"" turned out to be a pretty good anime series and for those who are familiar with ""Hokuto no Ken"" (Fist of the North Star) can definitely respect the anime series as it did show Raoh as the incredible, major badass as he is.  Despite being the protagonist in this series, he's still the villain of the ""Hokuto no Ken"" storyline.

The anime captured Raoh's lack of emotion (only once do we see him really showing off his emotion when he receives distressing news) but for the most part, he believes that he has received the power from the heavens to fix the world and become the leader of this new world.

Souja and Reina are characters that are dedicated to Raoh and can be seen through the ""Legends of the True Savior"" film series to know the backstory of why these two came to help Raoh.  But even if you haven't watched the films, it's not essential to enjoying ""Legends of the Dark King"" as the film is pretty much about Raoh and him wanting to conquer countries and amassing a massive army.

The anime series also features a side of learning how people were starting to side with Kenshiro, because of his ability to understand the sorrow of the people but also emphasizing that the Hokuto Shinken is the Yin and Nanto Houken is the yang and it's interesting to see the differences between the two martial arts and how it was utilized in the film.

Also, I found the various enemies that Raoh had to take on quite interesting and it was quite obvious that such a thing is good for a video game tie-in and sure enough, a fighting video game on the Sony PSP was released based on the anime series.

For those wonder if Kenshiro is in this anime series, he is shown via a silhouette or from behind.  If anything, Kenshiro only shows up as reports given to Raoh but the main characters that know the Hokuto Shinken that you will see primarily are Raoh and his brother Toki.

Overall, ""Legends of the Dark King: A Fist of the North Star Story"" was a violent, action-packed and highly entertaining anime series.  As mentioned earlier in my review, like Darth Vader in the US, Raoh has a a large following in Japan despite being a villain.  So, for those who have been enamored by the darker side of ""Hokuto no Ken"" especially with Raoh, this anime series is quite entertaining and again, yes... there is a good amount of bloody violence, decapitations and severed limbs which the series is known for.  So, no worries about that.

If you are a fan of Raoh or the ""Hokuto no Ken"" series, definitely give ""Legends of the Dark King: A Fist of the North Star Story"" a chance!",1254355200,18,13161,4.5683176771989755
