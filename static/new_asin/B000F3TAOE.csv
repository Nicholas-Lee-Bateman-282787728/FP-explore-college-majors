2550620,5,B000F3TAOE,"This DVD is truly valuable for its visual elements and production.  It fills in parts where the opera is potentially weak--such as why violetta yields to alfredo or the fact that we never see alfredo and violetta in the spring of their love.  However, in doing so, there are inevitably conflicts with Verdi's libretto, such as at the beginning of ACT II. Even so, it is so fun and enjoyable to see this concept of traviata.  Emotions are uninhibited and drama is center.  The musical side, however, often leaves something to be desired.  Villazon is good, though perhaps over the top (which isn't a bad thing in this production).  Hampson....is pretty bad.  Netrebko has a beautiful, thrilling and expressive voice, however, she has little technique or control and occasionally poor musical taste. Unlike solti/gheorghiu's musically flawless violetta, Netrebko's is rife with errors, even though gheorghiu was only at the very beginning of her international career and netrebko was at least five years into it by 2005. (Hmmm perhaps this shows the sad state of musical affairs today...) Either way, the pros highly outweigh the cons, though it may not seem that way from my review.  One must watch it to understand why I give it 5 stars despite what I would otherwise consider huge flaws--it is really exciting!",1172188800,13,1311,4.981651376146789

2550622,5,B000F3TAOE,"I am delighted to own this DVD as the production offers a new take on Verdi's masterpiece. Fond memories of productions featuring Gheorghiu and Gruberova are not eclipsed with this new version, although I am tempted to say that I enjoyed this version more than the others. The principals sing and act excellently and I can see why this production caused such excitement when it was premiered at the 2005 Salzburg Festival.",1160092800,32,422,4.875
2550623,5,B000F3TAOE,"This interpretation of Traviatta is very close to the real life even today.
There will be no better performance than this one with Netrebko and Villazon....",1429660800,2,156,5.038461538461538
2550624,5,B000F3TAOE,"This production pierces with laser precision to the very essence of Verdi's masterpiece! Powerful and Masterfully executed! The chemistry between Villazon, Netrebko and Hampson was mezmerizing! The brilliance of Decker utilizing minimalism with a contemporary set allowed me for the first time to focus solely on the music, the drama and the tragedy unfolding in front of me. The incredible emotional experience was utterly draining! I have seen perhaps 6 different versions of this opera with everything from a fully modern set to the over-ornate baroque and always I was somewhat distracted by the elaborate costuming and sets to fully engage with the actors. Unadorned of all this, the emotional power of the singers to embody their characters was all that was left to pull you into their suffering and heartbreak. Anna Netrebko had me weeping for her sacrifice; Villazon, passionate with his love for Violetta and Hampson for the grief of a father over a beloved son. Their singing was superb! Anna with her bell like clarity and coloratura was nimble and precise;Hampson's baritone equally agile and  exhibits his years of experience with a reputation as a perfectionist. Hampson drives home in his Master Classes the importance inhabiting the character not just John Doe baritone playing the part of Germont. He became the man on stage and it was heartbreaking. I own three different productions of La Traviata including the traditional production by the Los Angeles Opera that Villazon did with Renee Fleming and did not realize how much of an emotional experience I missed until I watched this version! His portrayal with Fleming lacked the chemistry that he and Netrebko have, mainly because Fleming appeared to be just a little too old for the twenty something Villazon. Fleming's portrayal of Violetta was stunning and gave me goosebumps but when they were in-scene together it was more about lack of chemistry than individual performance. On this production Villazon's Alfredo was beautifully executed His lush warm tenor and gorgeous stage presence makes him eye-candy equal to Anna's beauty and the chemistry between them made it that much more rewarding. Villazon is good at being a lover on stage. Of all the human emotions to portray on stage, falling in love and being in love is the most difficult to project covincingly. In Opera its more than just physically acting the role. Performers are tasked with the added artistic burden of acting the role in voice. The musical voice is a complicated and taxing actor in the drama. Villazon embodies the nuances of love: falling in love; the tenderness and loyalty of being in love and its torment when placed in complex situations; of the hard choices when one loves someone so completely. He does this better than any operatic actor on the stage right now and with such a diverse line up of co-stars and themes. The only disappointment in this production was Decker's interpretation of how the final scene of Violetta dying would be played out. I was confused more than anything. For having been so successful up to that point in stripping away the unnecessary to zero in on the the powerful emotions in the story, the ending blew apart the intimacy that had built up between the characters and the audience and became cold. Perhaps death is supposed to be that way, cold. It seemed too austere, devoid of the intimacy that the reconciliation of her final minutes were supposed to portray in her death scene. Annina was supposed to be lovingly reassuring her and nursing her on her death-bed, summoning the Doctor, keeping her comfortable physically and comforting her emotionally when Violetta reflects that she will pass away unnoticed by the world, there will be no one to eulogize her passing no one to place a marker on her grave as she had no one in the world except Alfredo and he is gone too. Instead, Decker had Netrebko walking and staggering around on the stage when she was supposed to be gaunt, lifeless, at the very end of her strength, too weak to get out of bed, minutes from dying. The rest of the characters were supposed to be at her side to comfort her. Instead,  Annina her faithful servant sat  a long way, across the stage from her and was not to rush to Violetta's side when she stirs from her delirium and asks for a sip of water. When Violetta finally sees Alfredo he is supposed to be cradling her in his arms for most of the scene as she goes in and out of consciousness and has visions of her better days as well as says her final goodbyes, content now that the very ones she loves the most in the world are there at her side. Instead, Decker has Alfredo, Annina and the elder Germont saying their reconciliations seated at least 10 feet away from her and each other. Violetta sings her final notes and then abruptly drops to the floor dead, all alone in the middle of the stage. Perhaps the interpretation was symbolic, that the space, the distance between each character's position symbolized the great separation that is the finality of death and that everyone has to go there alone. After the tremendous emotional ride I went on with these characters up to the final scene, it was anti-climatic that all of these characters would experience her death ""alone"" If Willy Decker did not want to direct a traditional ending then perhaps if he had ""Death"" (I presume the big silent guy in the room symbolized Death watching her living out her final days)  carry her off and out those big doors the symbolism would have been more evident and at least there would have been a sense of an physical contact in her final minute. Oh well, it was still worth adding this one to my opera library. I highly recommend it!",1412208000,5,5703,4.7926829268292686
2550625,5,B000F3TAOE,"This production is not for everyone, just want to point that out first and foremost. If you're a fan of Traviata with extravagant, Victorian sets and costumes, then this isn't for you... maybe ;)

Singer wise, this production is amazing, Anna, Rolando and Thomas deliver their roles very well. All in all, their portrayal is marvelous. The only difference I can spot (compared to a production of the classic) is that Violetta in act 1 is more sexualized, and the opening to act 2 was a lot more innocent and carefree, since both characters are new to love (Violetta in an emotional way, and Alfredo in both emotional and physical) so its very playful.

The Production:

This production is exceptionally minimalist in nature. Using a full white set, and a LARGE clock. The only thing of color is Violetta's Dress and Couch, while everyone else is in black and white suits.  The clock was a nice touch, once you catch on to the symbolism of these props it all falls into place. The clock looms in constant sight of Violetta, and at times begins ticking, telling her that her time is running. A man in a trench coat traipses about the set every now and again, and appears before Violetta with a cold, distant stare. This man is a metaphor for death, as Violetta appears to plead with him not to take her so young (**plot twist with this guy in the final act***) and he appears next to the clock a few times as well. The lighting is used well too, darkening at the right dramatic moments, often in bluish tones for sorrow (at least that's what I got from it) and as a heavenly light at the finale. My favorite lighting used was in Act 2, Scene 2 in which the stage went very dark and a looming silhouette of death came into the set. The scene in which Alfredo throws his winnings at Violetta was quite cruel and brutal (this is a fairly updated version, so what was seen as offensive back then, is nothing compared to the ammount of anger that drove him to do what he did here.) He drives her down, and throws the money at her, shoving it down her dress, and stuffing it in her mouth, and at one point stuffs it into the crotch of her dress O.O so its pretty brutal, but all the more convincing.

Conclusion:
This production is a very good update/revamp/re-imagining, whatever you'd like to call it. It's powerful, dramatic, and quite an experience once you've gotten into the flow of the symbolism.",1405468800,,2395,4.48394495412844

2550627,3,B000F3TAOE,"La Traviata is my favourite opera. Natalie Dessay's 2011 performance was sublime. I have unsuccessfully tried to get a DVD version. Anna Netrebco is a great soprano so I felt sure she would make a great Violetta.
My mistake. Ishould have known that it would be impossible to transform such a rudely healthy & beautiful woman into a frail consumptive close to death Violetta. I should have known better.
However Anna was partnered with Rolando Villazon who is a great tenor and musically all looked promising. To my ear it was far from it. The orchestra was drowned out by the singing and Roland was too powerful against Anna.
Whoever did the mixing on this DVD should be shot!
If anyone knows where I could get a DVD copy of Natalie Dessay's 2011 version I would be eternally thankful.",1390521600,2,785,4.654676258992806

2550629,4,B000F3TAOE,"This production is minimalist, but both Villazon and Netrebko give solid performances. A more traditional performance would have been preferred.",1388966400,,144,6.25
2550630,5,B000F3TAOE,"Critically, this production received almost universal raves by critics. Willy Decker's staging is conceptually simple ( a circular stage, pink couch and chair), symbolic ( a foreboding clock), and aesthetically sublime. Netrebko is ideal and dramatically incisive in acting and singing. Rolando Villazon is aptly intense and his chemistry with Netrebko is near perfection.

The professional opera critics were informed and their opinions count.

Of course, here in the states, there are always those handful of opera fundamentalists who bellow, hiss, throw out those predictable, and by now quite boring insulting phrases like ""eurotrash,"" beat their chests and throw hostile tantrums. Why? Because they want to keep opera solely in the past.

Sure, there are examples of ludicrous contemporary stagings (i.e. the M22 Ascanio in Alba) but there are just as many, if not more thought-provoking directors who are dedicated to keeping the profundity of stage direction alive and fresh (i.e. Claus Guth).

In the 1980s, Patrice Chereau staged a Ring Cycle. Gone were the cardboard swords and plastic, horned helmets. The traditionalists were outraged. Today, Chereau's Ring is considered a classic by all, but a few holdouts (who histrionically liken the late director to the antichrist). The offended opera puritans proved to be as antiquated in their thinking as those King James only bible fundies who predicted the end of the world when publishing companies started distributing contemporary versions.

Naturally, these puritan opera attitudes are predominant here in the west. It is because of them that opera companies, catering to the ultra conservatives (who feel they own the art form) are forced to stage a La Boheme every single season, simply to keep themselves out of the red.

Meanwhile, Europe, which has long staged opera in contemporary settings, has a thriving opera scene.

Do the math.

The supposed American opera fans have killed the art form they claim to love. They have killed it by putting that art form on a pedestal, edifying it, dehumanizing it, and keeping it stale. At the sign of even a single 21st century dress on a singer, these fans will be as sounding brass, wailing blasphemy behind the curtain.

It is no wonder opera is in its death throes here in the states. What potential music lover, under the age of thirty, would want to even explore an art form held captive by such a constipated lot?",1386806400,2,2427,5.1395939086294415
2550631,3,B000F3TAOE,"While I generally do not like opera productions that stray too far from the composers time setting, much of this production makes musical and emotional sense. I do think that the androgynous dress is a bit over the top, however. Also, while this record is of the original Decker Viennese production, I felt that it lacked the emotional punch of the 2013 NY production with Diana Damrau, Plcido Domingo (WOW! The baritone gets better billing & applause than the tenor), & Saimir Pirgu. There were a lot of wet eyes at the end of that production, unlike my reaction to this one. Perhaps if I had not seen the Met production first, this one might have more stars.",1386633600,3,660,4.601694915254237
2550632,1,B000F3TAOE,"A terrible production that has nothing to do with the opera or Verdi or Dumas. Many have already trashed what needs to be trashed.

Villazon is excellent in this and it is too bad that he is with Netrebko who is as bad as the production. Lunging into high notes, scooping at every turn, no drama except what the red dress provides, and an annoying habit of stepping out of character the instant she has sung her ""lines.""She needs a cigarette.

Get the Fleming/ Villazon one..it is miles ahead of this mess.

Hampson is OK..he's a Lieder singer however..no big range here. His Thais is the same..he's way over parted in that as in this.",1380326400,6,635,4.504347826086956

2550634,4,B000F3TAOE,We liked the performance. Anna Netrebko and other singers performed very well. We will watch it again and again and again..,1373068800,,123,4.904761904761905
2550635,3,B000F3TAOE,"First the bad news: except for the giant clock, I wasn't crazy about the staging. The costumes were inconsistent - ""La Traviata"" need not be historical, but for the love of God, pick a decade and a theme, and stick to it!! This one is, what, ""postmodern""? I'm not really sure, and that's what bothers me. The scene of Germont confronting Violetta was disappointing as far as the staging - Violetta prances around in a little white nightie the entire time. This was doubtless comfy for singing, but it was a little painful to watch since her time with the devoted Alfredo is supposed to redeem her of her ""wicked ways,"" yet there she stands before a stuffy, socially muzzled Germont. It's a stark, close-to-literal take on ""caught with your pants down."" Perhaps there's a metaphor there about being stripped of the superfluous frills of life, but it instead just proved Germont's point about Alfredo falling in with the wrong crowd. It adds drama aplenty, but I'm not sure it helps Violetta's case.

The ""set"" (if you can call it a set) had little to rest the eyes upon (in fact, it usually looked like a stage that hadn't been put together yet, or perhaps the backside of another set). I suppose this was done to emphasize the music and, ultimately, the isolation of the dying Violetta (and it does), but part of why I buy an opera on DVD instead of merely a CD is so I have something fun to look at while I listen.

And now on to the more important matter, the music itself. The Vienna Philharmonic seldom has an ""off"" day and they tried their darndest to bring out the beauty and subtlety in the music. However, Rizzi seemed to keep rushing them through some passages. Verdi cannot simply be sped up or slowed down. Verdi music, and especially ""La Traviata,"" has a certain pulse that weirdly moves forward even when it's not moving very quickly, but Rizzi seemed more concerned with chopping the total time down to size. Failing to give the music time to ""breathe"" really messes with emotional perceptions within the music and doesn't always allow important little intermediary steps/progressions to happen within the characters (admit it, most of us listen to Verdi because we want a big soap opera firecracker show!). Having said that, the conducted dynamics were sufficiently interesting and appropriate during the sung portions (my main complaint is with the interludes and introductions, and particularly the overture).

People sure are flaky about their sopranos, and Netrebko seems to provoke a lot of this reaction in people. I will at least say this: Netrebko's type of soprano is a bit unusual by today's standards. It is quite deep-throated in the lower and middle registers (is this a biological/anatomical function or just the influence of Russia-based training? We're not really sure.). Some reviewers complain about upper thinness, but I don't hear much of that if it's really there. Yes, her topmost notes sound different than the lower notes, but most singers *do* show this, especially women. It's a very rare ability for a soprano to have a strong, resounding pitch range that is also consistent in volume/quality for the entire range, and complete consistency in sound tends to just mean a smaller voice (take Kathleen Battle, who has great tone consistency but tends to sound like a 90-pound teenager). The thing that takes getting used to is that the character of Violetta (who is physically and vocally supposed to hint at being frail, small, and tired) seems a little odd in the form of a full-throated, physically svelte (but not malnourished) woman. A fuller sound also makes her seem older than she really is (Opera 101 question we all know the answer to: presumably part of the tragedy in the story is that Violetta dies young, right?).

Villazon is vocally marvelous in this production, and even if you 100% hate Netrebko, please consider at least watching this for an excellent Alfredo. Once you get past his caterpillar eyebrows, he's also a competent actor. His voice is a bit more nasal than some other tenors out there, but his technique is solid and you can clearly see him enjoying himself in this opera.

Thomas Hampson's Giorgio Germont is a nice blend of restrained, fatherly, and somewhat selfish. I always appreciate singers who have the sense to play it that way because this character is not necessarily a villain (only Fate is the true villain in this opera). Societal obligation more than personal gain is what motivates Germont to push Violetta away. Hampson is usually a welcome vocal addition to a cast, and the same is true here. The only laughable detail that wouldn't leave my thoughts is that Hampson looks (and in reality, he IS) young enough to be Villazon's older brother rather than his father.

Is this production definitive, and should it be placed far above other casts of singers? Definitely not. Is it worth adding to your collection? Certainly! There are few productions that everyone mutually hails as a miracle of human achievement. Explore it for yourself and see what you think. In all fairness, there are weirder stagings out there than this one!",1372377600,,5115,4.8466819221967965
2550636,1,B000F3TAOE,"Traviata is one of my favorite operas, and I had seen video of this rendition on You Tube.  It is a fantastic version of the opera (except for the totally unnecessary transvestite/homosexual ditty in the debauchery scene).  Anna Netrebko is downright scrumptious, and her singing is superlative.  The problem comes when you try to play the disc.  The material the sticky back is mounted on is the structural equivalent of a graham cracker.  I bought two of this disc, one for myself and one for some friends who are just learning about the joys of opera.  I really enjoyed the one and only  time i got to play my disc before it broke in half the second time I went to play it.  I have no idea how the one that is still in its wrapping will perform.  But being a patsy, I ordered a third disc, because, well, I think I have become addicted to Ms. Netrebko.  That one CAME BROKEN.  I opened the jewel case, and had two half discs before I even touched anything.  DO NOT BUY THIS DISC!!!!!!

2550640,5,B000F3TAOE,"... and I've seen dozens of them. Some people object to the minimalist staging and the modern costumes. Not I. They provide an ambiance that allows for greater psychological depth than I've seen elsewhere and a small degree of symbolism. This is also the sexiest Traviata I've seen; Nebrebko is almost as beautiful of body as of voice, and she's not afraid of showing what a party girl, then a woman in love might do with such a body. But, golly, is that voice amazing!

Rolando Villazn's Alfredo is a worthy match. He sings the role more or less as he does in his DVD with Fleming, but the acting is a bit different. That befits the production concept. Thomas Hampson as the elder Germont is not as imposing on stage as he might be, though his singing is superb.

A newcomer to this opera (most likely someone new to opera in general) would find this production hard to follow, but this is the one I'll be coming back to most often.",1355702400,4,933,4.4186046511627906

- act I: her coloratura is barely satisfactory and not what one would expect from a regular singer at the MET...
- act II: her Amami Alfredo was weak; she went off tune rather often;
- act III: I got no sense of the frailty and tragedy of Violetta - she failed to convince dramatically.

So if you are a big fan of Villazon, you may want to buy this dvd for his good Alfredo; but if you are like me and you can't imagine a good La Traviata with a mediocre Violetta, save your money.",1351900800,4,849,4.2407407407407405

If you are a fan of any of the leads I would say you will enjoy this vocally. The singing by the leads is outstanding. If you have an open mind and are not shy about experiencing opera outside it's ""traditional"" staging you may find this one enjoyable as the singing by everyone involved with this project somehow lifts it beyond its unusual staging. So, if you're not a stickler for ""staging authenticity"" you may enjoy this one.

Now a word to the ""agents"" of the leads in this Traviata, how about a ""traditional staging"" of this opera with the leads.

2550649,5,B000F3TAOE,"Though Rolando Villazon had performed La Traviata with Renee Flemming about the same time (2006), this pairing (2005) with the incomparable Anna Netrebko (""La Bellissima,"" as she has been called)wins the day hands down. This is an odd production--an abstract, cinemascope-like white background bare wall, against which black-clad choruses surround Netrebko, who first appears in red, then in her slip and barefoot, while Villazon often sings in his underwear! This modernistic, almost total abstraction in sets seems an anomaly, in a production often given in lavish costumes, ballet dancing and much extravagance that threatens to drown the story. Here, two people--the tragic lovers--dominate; an oversized clock symbolizes time passing, I guess, although that does not preclude other interpretations. A figue looms in the background, like a charon waiting to take the beautiful and sick and sinful Violetta to the other world. Plain, a bit disturbing,demanding some stamina to watch in one sitting (meaning the DVD). But it pays off, for Netrebko catches all the nuances, vocally and dramatically, of this role. Perhaps not for all tastes, but for me it was a musical event--and innovation--worth paying for. Vienna Philharmonic, with Carlo Rizzi conducting.",1325548800,3,1261,5.538860103626943
2550650,5,B000F3TAOE,"Rich, vibrant singing and acting; sensuous, warm, and believable even against the modernistic setting.  We enjoyed the ultra-sparse modern setting, which seemed campy with the fifties manner of dress.  The symbolism struck us as an eighties sort of interpretation ... hit us over the head with a skillet so we catch the symbolism, and yet it was so artistically done.  Absolutely loved the doctor lurking about, trading camellias.  Laughed about the scene with the floral coverings of the clock and sofas matching the night gowns, so the artists disappeared against the props. Very campy, but well done.  Laughed, but the scene was so well done ...this may be the dream scene we've heard others say was missing.  Alfredo musing upon his love and delight with his Violetta.
  This is an imaginative interpretation, but nothing is out of order.  The transitions from scene to scene contain several dream-like and prophetic suggestions which we do not find in the more traditional interpretations of this masterpiece, but which made wonderful sense, and added to the suggestion that this opera is really about Violetta's last hours of life, recalling the scenes as flashbacks.
  Definitely recommended, not as the sole performance, but as an incredible interpretation. Netrebko and Villazon are ne plus ultra as singers and actors.
  I needed to see this opera in its traditional presentation in order to appreciate the genius displayed in this interpretation.  I am impressed, and also enjoyed the traditional, which I saw today with Joyce El-Khoury as Violetta, and Zach Borichevsky as Alfredo, in the Knoxville Opera production.

The disease which consumes her is not one of her choosing, nor one she can be held in any way responsible for having contracted. She is ennobled by her actions, in defiance of her disease.

In order to make the story more 'relevant' to historically illiterate audiences, the geniuses behind this production re-imagined Violetta as a drunkard whose demise is due to inveterate boozing, rather than due to an epidemic which passes through society blindly.

Furthermore, Violetta's sacrifice makes no sense, as cast here in this version. We are asked to believe this modern day society woman needed to give up the man she loves, so that his sister could retain her good name and thereby go on to marry a man of position?

The trick is to trust the audience, to be able see a 19th century drama, and then individually, as concert goers, relate it to our own lives. Not trusting the audience, is belittling.

In any case, both she and her man look ravishingly believable as the love objects, or rather, the sex objects. It's fantastic they look so sexy, but the plot has lost its nobility. Violetta has lost her gentility.",1319500800,15,1319,4.6239316239316235

2550654,5,B000F3TAOE,"I already have three Traviatas in my collection and when the Decker production was released I didn't feel compelled to add another one--that is until it was produced for the Met. The discussion that it created on Opera L and other sites devoted to opera was amazing. The critical comment from many contributers to these site became fascinating, especially if I had read their reviews on Amazon as well as critical comments that were made in other venues. For those whose reviews were positive and/or challenging, I thank you for making this a ""must buy"" item. I am amazed that there are individuals out there who are prepared to dislike any new production that smacks of ""regie"" or updating in general. New concepts and ideas challenge the singer, that is if the singer is interested in being challenged. I have found that the most interesting singers welcome the challenge and ultimately they are part of the creative process. Could Renee come to this production? I have no doubt Dessay would and successfully. Angela has made her feelings known on the subject and for those who are not interested in a ""regie"" production she is in the most traditional (and beautiful) production on DVD's, from LA Scala--the one from ROH is traditional but the Scala trumps it easily because it has better singers all round. For a piece of history the Traviata on VAI with Scotto and Carreras (making all the usual cuts) is well worth owning. For all those who are willing to go with an intelligent provocative well-sung and acted Traviata, this DVD is well worth owning",1298592000,2,1555,4.8059701492537314
2550655,3,B000F3TAOE,"La Traviata has always been one of my favorite operas, and I own several versions of it. I knew this one was going to be a bit different, but it was actually a shock. When I saw the set, I couldn't believe my eyes, and I kept saying, who is that old man who is in almost every scene? It wasn't until I saw it the second time around, that I realized he was supposed to be Dr. Death (or the Grim Reaper, if you prefer).

Where to start? Well, let's start with the clothes. I don't mind the clothes of the three main characters being up to date and modern. But the clothes of the party guests? The men are OK, but the women in men's clothes? Couldn't they find a few cocktail dresses? No woman I know would attend a party in men's clothes, so this was just not believable. If they'd simply updated everyone's clothes to fit their gender, it would have been fine. And do away with the silly masks, for Pete's sake.

Now on to the liberties in the script. There is no Grim Reaper in La Traviata, there is no man in a red dress (what was that supposed to mean?), and no other woman wearing the same clothes as Violetta, mocking her. And for that matter, no masks either. And the matter of the Grim Reaper suddenly singing the doctor's part? That would confuse the hell of any newcomer to this opera. And we see Violetta receiving Alfredo's father in her slip and then getting dressed in his presence. No wonder he wanted Alfredo to be rid of her.

About the acting. Since there was no set to speak of, they tried to make it up with over-the-top acting (and antics). Violetta being lifted up in the air on a sofa by the partygoers. Alfredo bodily attacking his father, and the two physically fighting. A deathly sick on-her-deathbed Violetta, walking around on a ledge on the set. And countless other nonsense actions that have no place in the story.

And finally, the set. I'm OK with a white background, but let's have a bit of furniture to represent the surroundings. I'd like to see some tables, chairs and lamps in the party scenes. Some minimal living room furniture in Violetta's home. A change of furniture would let us know when there is a scene change, instead of confusing us. Such as, we see Alfredo crying in Violetta's house, and then suddenly a bunch of people burst in and move the furniture around. Wait, where are we? We are supposed to be in the Countess' house where a party is being held, but how did we get here?  And that large clock? What was that about?

Now finally, to the only really good thing about this DVD: the music and the singing. I loved it. Beautiful. I could listen to it again and again. And that's just what I'm doing. I bought the CD, while the DVD is sitting on my shelf.

This is reported to be an assemblage of the several performances of the opera at the Salzburg Festival's Grosser Festspielhaus  in August 2005.  I rather suspect that there are also some cuts from a dress rehearsal, for there are some points where applause would certainly be expected but only dead silence ensues.

SOUND:
This DVD has the full-bodied resonance of a studio recording, at least for the principal singers.  The orchestra in the pit is usually rather distant-sounding, although from time to time, it leaps forward into the listener's lap.  The on-stage orchestra--which, of course, never appears on-stage--is always distant and muffled.  The chorus and occasionally the comprimarios sound a bit mushy throughout.

I frankly do not believe for one moment that Netrebko and Villazon sounded in the Grosses Festspielhaus as they do on this disk.  The resonance and fullness of their voices simply make no sense in the context of that particular theater and that particular stage set.  I think that both have been given a bit of body and ""sweetened"" by the engineers to make them sound more ""real.""

CAST:
VIOLETTA VALERY, a successful courtesan in her last days, unaccountably attracted to Alfredo - Anna Netrebko (soprano)
ALFREDO GERMONT, a shallow, callow young man with no discernible self-control - Rolando Villazon (tenor)
GIORGIO GERMONT, father of the half-witted Alfredo who falls under Violetta's spell - Thomas Hampson (baritone)
FLORA BERVOIX - Violetta's friend, another successful courtesan - Helene Schneiderman (mezzo-soprano)
ANNINA - Violetta's maid and friend through thick and thin - Diane Pilcher (soprano)
IL BARONE DUPHOL, Violetta's ""protector"" during her high-flying days, a sensible man who has no use at all for Alfredo -  Paul Gay (baritone)
IL MARCHESE D'OBIGNY, a guest at parties thrown by both Violetta and Flora - Herman Wallen (bass-baritone)
IL DOTTORE GRENVIL, Violetta's GP and generally a society doctor (in Acts I and II) - William Schwinghammer (bass-baritone)
IL DOTTORE GRENVIL, a stalking figure throughout the opera who may represent death or fate or the tax collector or the stage director's indigestion, and who may or may not be singing in Act III--it's hard to tell - Luigi Roni (maybe a bass-baritone)
GIUSEPPE, a servant - Dritan Luca
FLORA'S SERVANT - Wolfram Igor Derntl
A MESSENGER - Friedrich Springer
A GUEST - Athol Farmer (who sings, I suppose, like a choreographer)

CONDUCTOR:
Carlo Ricci, with the Wiener Philharmoniker and Konzert Vereinigung Wiener Staatsopernchor.

STAGE MUSIC:
Mozarteum Orchester

STAGE DIRECTOR:
Willy Decker, a practitioner of Regietheater, alas.

SET DESIGN:
Wolfgang Grossmann.  The set remains unchanged throughout all three acts: a greyish-white concave wall some twelve or fifteen feet high curving all the way from stage left to stage right.  The top of the wall has a practical platform from which the chorus can look down on the stage, as though from the top of a battlement.  At the base of the wall a curved bench extends across the width of the stage upon which members of the cast can perch like so many frozen haddock.  The only entrance to the playing area of the stage is a tall set of greyish-white doors which open and close at stage right.  Stage props consist of a large clock, perhaps eight or nine feet in diameter that represents ... er, time, I suppose.  The clock lasts for the duration of two-and-a-half acts.  Stage furniture consists of a couple of uncomfortable-looking, squared-off sofas which serve as sitting places, hiding places and stages for slightly raunchy exhibitionism.

COSTUMES:
Wolfgang Grossmann and Susana Mendoza.  The costuming is simple: black men's contemporary suits with white shirts and black ties for all members of the cast--male and female alike--except for long frock coats (black, naturally) for Papa Germont and the stalking Grenvil-Death figure; Violetta in a red dress and sometimes a white slip, a mute Violetta-successor in a white slip to which is later added a red dress, and a guy in red drag who makes goo-goo eyes at Alfredo ... don't ask.  In Act II, the black-suited ensemble don flat face masks ... again, don't ask.

I assume that Ms. Mendoza's function was to walk into a women's shop to buy the red dresses.

CHOREOGRAPHER:
Athol Farmer.  His hand is not readily detectable.  I suppose some of the milling about might be classed as dancing.

DRAMATURGIST:
Klaus Bestisch, a complete buffoon, if this is a fair sample of his work.

TEXT:
The singers and orchestra offer a fairly accurate and complete rendition of what was written by Verdi and his librettist Piave.  The stage director has apparently been exposed to a three-paragraph summary of the plot of ""La Traviata"" at some time in his career.  He has chosen to ignore most of it in order to substitute his own improved notion of what the story should have been and to insert the stalking Death (or whatever) figure that Verdi and Piave inexplicably omitted.

COMMENTARY:
This is a Regietheater (aka Eurotrash) version of Verdi's ""La Traviata.""  As such things go, it's not nearly as obnoxious as it might be.  Rather than obscenely disgusting, as the best of Regietheater must be, it is more accurately to be described as wrong-headed and mostly visually boring.

Both Netrebko and Villazon are among the top-ranked of contemporary singers and do very well here, although I found both their acting and their singing styles to be more appropriate for the sweaty, earthy  ""Carmen"" than for the more elegant and formal world of Verdi.  That is merely a matter of personal taste, however, and it is perfectly possible that theirs is the proper style for Verdi in the early 21st Century.

I found Netrebko to be just a bit short-breathed for some of Violetta's soaring passages and just a bit too hardy in parts of Act III.  I also found Villazon too dramatic tenorish to be an ideal Alfredo, whom I would prefer to be of lighter and more elegant voice.  Once again, these are matters of purely personal taste.  I must give Villazon full marks, though, for singing his big aria, ""De' miei bollenti spiriti,"" in character and with a straight face while wearing a pair of baggy, blue boxer shorts.

(To those who would damn Netrebko for ignoring certain very high notes, I ask, ""Are you out of your minds?  What about the other 99.99% of the notes she sang?)

Thomas Hampson is a very big operatic name.  Despite that, I found his voice to be too light in weight and too lacking in warmth for the older Germont.  To call his acting stick-like would be to overpraise it.  (I must admit that it is possible the fault may lie with the director rather than the baritone.)  In any case, the singers who did Baron Duphol and Doctor Grenvil of Acts I and II and maybe even the Grenvil of Act III would have been better choices for the part.

Among the performers, the most damaged by the stage director's limited vision are the comprimarios, Flora, the Barone, the (Acts I and II) Doctor, Gastone and the Marchese.  All are very good vocally but visually, they are entirely subsumed into the black-suited unisex chorus.

All in all, I regard this as a pretty good performance from Netrebko and Villazon who offer strong, if not especially elegant takes on Violetta and Alfredo.  Hampson, to give him the benefit of a doubt, is minimally adequate.  The Regietheater production is disrespectful of the material provided by Verdi and Piave--naturally!--but not as awful as it might very well have been.

A weak four stars for the singing and two stars for the dismal staging.  Call it three stars overall.

Bringing the staging and time frame up to the more modern 1920's and giving the stage a stark setting dominated mainly by a tell tale clock, for me makes the focus not on costumes but on the voices.  And what voices!  Anna Netrebko, as Violetta, and Rolando Villazon as Alfredo exude a sexual chemistry in their duets unparalleled in the operatic world.  Their voices are sharp, clean and strong and neither one overpowers the other.  I have always admired the soprano voice but never before now LOVED a single diva's instruument -- Netrebko is both beautiful and magnificent. Add to that Thomas Hampson, now entering into the more mature roles, as Alfredo's father, and you have three of the best voices you will ever hear in a single performance.",1255996800,3,998,4.77906976744186

Well, yes, Mr. Decker has reinvented and modernized this tragedy, and his production is spare as they come, but the results are magnificent.  Without all the gowns, furniture and accents of 19th-century Paris, the personal torment and social commentary shine through.  And who better to embody the main characters than the reigning visual/vocal operatic duo of the DVD age...Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazon.  As good as Mr. Villazon is, Ms. Netrebko is the real star here.  She sings with conviction, sweetness and pathos, but it is her acting ability and stunning beauty that steals the show (after all, Violetta is supposed to be the most attractive and sought after woman in Paris).  You really believe that the young Alfredo would be totally enraptured by this Violetta.  This may be an old opera ""chestnut"", but in Mr. Decker's exciting yet disciplined imagination and the principals' lovely interpretations, this La Traviata is a great success and a most own DVD.",1253404800,3,1273,5.175609756097561

Features a giant clock, androgynous party guests with identical cardboard masks, a stubble-faced transvestite with a long tongue wearing a bright red dress (a duplicate of Violetta's, which is no doubt intended to make some profound point or other), Alfredo violently stuffing money into Violetta's bodice, gratuitous dark ""angels"" standing about in serried ranks, and a dark, mysterious figure who turns into Dr. Grenville in the last act.

In other words, it's a total mess that bears some resemblance to Verdi's opera, but has much more to do with Willy Decker's ego (which, come to think of it, is a good working definition of Regietheater). It's a great example of what's become popularly known as ""Eurotrash"" opera.

I am no rabid hater of alternative stagings, and I would have been fine with it if it somehow made the story more comprehensible -- but it really doesn't. Instead, it seems more like Decker is poking fun at Piave's (and, by inference Dumas') story and trying to impress us with how smart he is (and, of course, with how dumb all of us are should we not ""get it"").

All that being said, the quality of the singing is admirable -- especially given the conditions under which Netrebko, Villazon et. al. had to work.

Beautifully filmed on stage at the 2005 Salzburg Festival, this places full attention on the two leads - Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazon - and places them in modern dress against the most minimalist of stage sets - and it all works beautifully. Willy Decker's stage production allows Netrebko and Villazon and the Vienna Phiharmonic conducted by Carlo Rizzi , without the usual scenic distractions, to concentrate on the music with power and beauty. Netrebko and Villazon are in a real sense a 'dream team' and Netrebko's performance is dramatically and musically astonishing. It is no wonder that the performances produced the ovations that they did.  The Deutsche Grammophon recording - apparently documenting the entire run of seven performances to ensure the artists "" enjoyed virtually the same conditions as in a studio production""-  makes for a wonderful consistent sound.  The filming of the brilliant stage set (A large clock is the single prop in the first act !) is bright and clear.

2550671,3,B000F3TAOE,"Traviata is one of the most performed operas around the world. It is normal to be portrayed in different ways. But this particular version was quite risky from my point of view. The withdrawing of all the accessories or any other settings that would have been needed, stripped the message once Verdi, Piave, or Dumas tried to send. The script was almost completely neglected. I love abstract art, but I can't say the same thing about this performance. The settings looked like Wallmart walls, and the only other things were a clock and a few mathematically drown sofas. Violetta appeared both vulgar and very healthy. In the ending scene she remained full of life, and with those false eyelashes and makeup still on, she didn't look like dieing from a consumptive disease as TB is, or better said was before the antibiotics era. The haunting old man that was almost always present, was both her doctor and, maybe an alter ego of the fate determined by the disease.
I am not a fan of Anna Netrebko, but overall I liked her singing. Rolando Villazon was also good, but I could not find the chemistry others are talking about. May be that is due to the direction that they had to obey. I don't know the director's name, and I don't think I should bother, because I could only notice his lack of talent.
They didn't look like real lovers. From this point of view, I prefer Stefania Bonfadelli and Scott Piper version, directed by Zeffirelli. As for Violetta, Angela Gheorghiu rules, among nowadays Violetta sopranos.
I am sorry I bought this DVD. I don't think I will ever want to watch it again, especially when I have three other much better variants. The three stars are for the quite good singing.",1244073600,7,1697,4.641196013289036
2550672,2,B000F3TAOE,"Well Allazon and Netrebko are in fine voice but this stark brutal version is not for me. It's more like Traviata by Brecht than by Verdi and what is more there are moments of sheer vulgarity throughout particularly in Act 3. Doing it different, don't make it better. I prefer the version from La Scala with the exquisite Gheorghiu.",1240272000,10,331,4.627118644067797
2550673,5,B000F3TAOE,"The publicity and hype that accompanied this production of Traviata, along with some less than favorable reviews, made me ignore it until quite recently. When I finally bought this DVD, I was absolutely stunned by its emotional power and impact.

A drama is unfolding in front of us, with the omnipresent Fate (or perhaps Death?) confronting the heroine sentenced to permanent stage presence, on the stage of her life that is running out too fast. She must face the large wall clock whose time is accelerating her to untimely death. What time is it? We never exactly know, but certainly we feel that it is too late, far too late for everything, for love and happiness, and for normal life... Just before her death, the Fate becomes her doctor, only to tell that she has but a few hours to live. The minimalistic approach, the stark empty stage with its clock and with the red or white sofa, combined with the outstanding singing and acting by the principals (especially by Anna and Rolando), creates the most powerful and unique experience I have ever seen in an Opera. The musical and emotional impact of this production is totally unique and unforgettable.

I am unable to add anything novel or original to the existing descriptions of the unique dark timbre and exceptional beauty of Anna's voice. It grew onto me slowly but steadily until she won me over completely, especially by her recent recordings including the Russian album, the Souvenirs, the Manon (also with Villazon), and I Capuletti e i Montecchi (with Elina Garanca). Anna sings gorgeously and seemingly effortlessly in almost any body position, something quite unseen before. Currently there seem to be no limit whatsoever to what she could do. Fortunately she is sufficiently different from the other leading contemporary sopranos, especially from Angela Gheorghiu (my other favorite), that there is no real competition there. Anna's voice blends especially well with the mezzo voice of Elina Garanca, and I am very much looking forward to their future joint productions.",1236729600,5,2040,5.014749262536873

2550676,5,B000F3TAOE,"....but at times they can't be avoided. Every new star evokes memories of the past...Anna Netrebko has frequently been compared to Maria Callas, and I will go ahead and provoke the anger of some by stating up front that Anna is better than Callas was the best day she ever saw. Now, I admit that, early in her career, she saw some good days; she had Style, and a fabulous voice. But, defective technique, and bad casting decisions, washed her up well before the age Anna is now. OK. Now I shall approach blasphemy...in Anna's heavier passages, I heard the merest hint of Rosa Ponselle. Anna is no Rosa. God forbid. Rosa was the greatest singer who ever lived. [Flagstad? Different genre]. She did Violetta later in her career; wonderful, naturally, but somehow ""sick"" and ""vulnerable"" are not words I associate with her. Soprano roles are varied, and Violetta is a meeting ground...the idea of Anna as Norma is painful, and Rosa as Lucia is laughable. And the the thought of Rosa, or Callas, doing this production is nauseating........

Which brings us to the issue at hand. A modern dress production of ""La Traviata""? Why not? Opera is entertainment, and the idea is to get an audience to pay money. You always need a fabulous voice for Violetta, and, here, you need a gorgeous girl, too. Anna is PERFECT. She not only sings well, she looks lucious, and displays the full range of Violetta's emotions and conflicts. The red dress, the BIG CLOCK, the Grim Reaper [in the character of Dr. Grenvil]...all fabulous artistic touches. Were the bare feet to show vulnerability, to be sexy, or were the red shoes just uncomfortable? Some of her gyrations stop barely short of indecent, but they do stop. I'll digress back to comparisons; has there ever been a more beautiful Violetta? Absolutely....the late Bidu Sayao. She, for me, remains the ideal Violetta [and Mimi, and Juliette]. Alas, we never got to see her costumed like Anna. I would have stood in an ice storm to see her. Smitten? No doubt.

I've gone out on a limb this whole review; I'll go further....this may be the best ""La Traviata"" ever assembled. And I did say assembled. Villazon and Thomas Hampson are wonderful beyond words. Yes, there have been better practitioners of the individual parts...Alfredo Kraus, Lawrence Tibbett, Leonard Warren. And I already swooned over Bidu. But this assembly is MAGIC. If you don't believe me [or if the production offends you], try the CD version. You'll HEAR what I mean.

The technical side of this DVD is all we could ask...great sound and video. Carlo Rizzi's conducting, and the Vienna Philharmonic's playing, are standards of perfection. The audience puzzled me....they liked it, naturally, but there was more polite applause than raucous cheering. Well, people are different...a Met audience would have torn down the house. Maybe there's a bit of a New York Mets crowd in a Met audience....I've said enough; if you don't have this, get it. Period.",1214697600,9,2954,4.857142857142857

2550678,2,B000F3TAOE,"(by a Japanese girl, 15 y.o.)
This DVD was my first opera DVD and the reason I chose this was I became a fan of Anna whom I found on YouTube lately and this DVD has such good reputations here and there.

As a beginner, I expected a Gorgeous stage set and beautiful costume.
But the stage set is very simple and poor. I was disappointed.
The costume, Anna is wearing simple red dress or white slip and the men are wearing business suits! I was severely disappointed.
I admit I should ask somebody about these things before.

But I was also bewildered by its presentation.
Who is that snowy-haired gentleman always standing at the side of the stage? As long as I read all review here, people don't care or express different understandings. I am not sure what he was meant to be.
There is a man wearing Violetta's red dress at act 3. What does that mean? I don't understand it either. For me, it was only dirty.

At the scene Alfredo was suppose to throw money to Violetta, Alfredo was putting money into Violetta's mouth! I was shocked and frozen. What was the director thinking? Somehow I suspect he did that because it was Netrebko. He wanted to show his power to this new idol singer. He didn't do this if she was Maria Callas, or could he? Man who does such rendition must be hating women somewhere deep in his psyche.

At act 3 there is a scene people wearing same mask and same costume thong into the room. It was so similar to Kate Bush's legendary video ""Running up that hill""(1985). It is not fresh at all to repeat the idea existed 20 years ago. More to the point, one studies choreography must have seen her videos. I suspect he copied her idea. Even I noticed, there would be hundreds of people who noticed it either. For people who don't know what I am talking about, you can see on the net. Key word is ""Kate bush Running up that hill"".

I didn't appreciate this presentation. The stage set was poor. The costume was poor. (It is not innovative. It looked they just did not have budget.) Singers are great. Orchestra is great. Then, CD could be better as I could concentrate music. I can't believe people admire this production. It is my two cents. Thank you for reading<3",1211932800,48,2184,4.396039603960396
2550679,4,B000F3TAOE,"If you prefer to see ""Traviata"" with traditional stage design and costuming, then this is not the production for you. I tend to fall into that category, but unlike the 2004 production from La Fenice which also is contemporary in setting, this 2005 Salzburg production works for me because of the terrific chemistry between the two stars and the way the director allows their relationship to blossom. If you like seeing two lovers light up the screen, this production is not to be missed.

Anna Netrebko has the most remarkable voice - rich, creamy, and dusky. And I love her youthful exuberance. That said, I don't think her interpretation of Violetta is as nuanced and deep as others I've seen (Renee Fleming and Angela Gheorghiu come to mind). But she is young in this production and should only get better in the role.

Rolando Villazon is wonderfully expressive as Alfredo and has a rich tenor voice. He pays careful attention to phrasing which makes his Alfredo sound fresh in interpretation. He does flail around the stage a bit too much (a tendency he has under control in his recent portrayal of Alfredo opposite Renee Fleming). As Germont, Thomas Hampson is a bit stiff in the role; perhaps this results from his trying to play a stern father. It's a shame because he possesses such a rich and powerful baritone voice. I hope he plays the role again on DVD.

Bottom line, don't miss the chance to see this inventive production, featuring two of opera's young superstars.",1211500800,2,1479,4.76953125

The sets were extravagant complete with the entire third act set rising through the floor.  The costumes were likewise extravagant and faithful to their time period.

Despite all the things the Met version had, seeing this stripped down version, I can see what it was missing: chemistry between the two leads which is not a problem with this Villazon/Netrebko production.  Here I believed the leads were actually in love with each other rather than just in love with hearing their own voices.  Here the focus was on the two lovers, the father's interjection of duty, and the menacing clock ticking away.

2550689,5,B000F3TAOE,"Anna Netrebko delivers a sexy, sizzling performance as the courtesan, Violetta. Not only can this acclaimed Russian Diva sing but we now learn she can act. She is both beguiling and captivating as she succumbs to the ardent overtures of her lover, Alfredo charecterized skillfully and convincingly by the Mexican born tenor, Rolando Villazon.

One can audibly hear the smacking of lips as the two lovers come together in passionate embrace. There is no holding back in this daring production as we see Netrebko lasciviously entice Villazon by lying on her back upon a sumptuous sofa, one leg bent and teasingly drawing back her brilliant red skirt to expose a shapely upper thigh.

Certainly it is one of the great contemporary productions noted for its stark minimalist set as staged by Willy Decker. There is symbolism aplenty however as the hands of the giant clock turn feverishly and unrelentingly to illustrate that Violetta's inevitable death is imminent.

Not only are Netrebko and Villazon perfectly cast but the admired American baritone, Thomas Hampson delivers a superb performance as Alfredo's anguished father, Giorgio.

Decker's production is unflinching and uncompromising as the human pathos unwinds with true love being found and lost in a heart rending climax.

To top it all Carlo Rizzi conducts the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra so masterfully prompting riotous acclaim from the audience not seen since his great pre-decessor, Herbert von Karajan.

For opera buffs this is a ""must have"" and for opera novices or initiates do yourself a favor, take some time out, sit down and be entranced as the essence of this human tragedy is revealed.

As much as I enjoyed Edita Gruberova in another version of this sad

Anna Netrebko's singing and acting are simply wonderful. She uses her body language and facial expressions so well it's pure magic. And her voice! Its elegance, sweetness, and emotional power blow my mind. There is nothing more you can ask out of a Violetta. Rolando Villazon is just as wonderful. Their duet scenes are as natural and passionate as it can get. You feel their ecstasy and pain, while appreciating the beauty of love. At moments, the emotional force is so strong that it becomes overwhelming. It must have left an indelible impression on the live audience. I envy them.

His performance in Donizetti's Elixir deserved an Oscar for acting and an ""Enrico"" for beautiful singing. He almost makes me reconsider the idea of reincarnation.

The minimalist staging works wonderfully well and really adds to this production, as nothing is there to detract from the magnificent singing and acting - except for the symbolic messages in the staging.  There is a relaxed abandoned feel to the performance which is very different and very appealing.  Both Villazon and Netrebko are extremely relaxed in their acting, not the stiff and stuffy stars of old - this is modern and well worth adding to your collection.  Netrebko seems to have the talent to sing in all ranges  lyric, coloratura and spinto - she is seriously impressive, my only fear for her, is that her popularity will ruin her voice if she does not take care of it.

This is opera as great theatre and yet the music is not compromised.

Enough has been written about the two stars and I agree with the accolades.  But for those who know this opera well, watch and listen to the way Thomas Hampson sings the cantabile lines:  he is not a singer who is seduced by a melody.  He is a thoughtful artist who is after creating a total character withing the structure of the music.  His singing of the cantabile lines bring out the provincial aspects of Germont's character.  I found this interpretation incredibly orginal and brave.  Kudos to Thomas Hampson.  A true artist.

2550701,5,B000F3TAOE,"For the past fifty-four years, everybody's been talking about ""The Tosca"" of Callas, Di Stefano and Cobbi: the August 1953 studio EMI recording under the baton of Maestro Victor De Sabata. It may finally have come to pass. Now, everybody will be talking about ""The La Traviata"" of Netrebko, Villazon and Hampson: the 2005 Saltzburg Decker's staging with Rizzi on the podium.
The minimalist and stark stage design, with its unlimited intellectual and emotional symbolism, creates an intentional void- we have seen enough of replicating realism of fatiguing chandeliers and old dusty Parisian gowns in other productions- but no one will ever forget the short red dress and the clock, and the intelligent directing and stellar singing and acting, which have sealded the fate of all La Traviatas to come in one's liftime.
With no curtains to rise and a bare stage, and with Violetta present from the very beginning, the drama unfolds with convincing pathos as soon as the first orchestral bar is played. Violetta's choreographic moves across the stage to meet her untimely and tragic death is the creation of a genius- Decker- and the execution of a consumate artist- Netrebko. This is the most innovative, the most emotional, and the most dramatic and live prelude or ""overture"" or ""prologue,"" if you will, of all La Traviatas you'll ever see.

In Decker's brilliant and unparalleled staging, every nuance has a redeeming value that slowly depicts the cleansing and tranformation of Violetta's soul ready to meet her Maker. After a determined and enlightened Violetta confronts reality, she understands that the frolicking of the last few months with Alfredo is over, and that she lives on borrowed time. She first uncovers the clock, accepting her fate and that her time is running out. Then she pulls the huge wild- like her life- multicolored-flower-designed slipcovers away from the sofas, and the expected red color of the upholstrey has changed to white! And later, Violetta unzips her red dress of carnal passion and throws it away with distain and repulsion, revealing her white slip of purity, soon to be coverd with a black coat, like a shroud, heralding her approaching death.
The lack of distracting scenery allows the viewer to totally surrender to the music, the thrilling vocalism, and the emotions of the characters. And this format completely succeeds becouse of the superb quality of singing and acting. Anna Netrebko does not play Violetta, but she is Violetta: the kept woman available to the higher bettor, cynical and distrusting the power of pure love, for only carnal pleasure she has known.

Netrebko is a phenomenon combining voice, looks, and acting. Is she a phenomenal actress who possesess a phenomenal voice, or is she a phenomenal soparano who is a phenomenal actress? It's hard to tell; and that makes her unique. If she developd futher as a singing actress, she could be a formidable Tosca or Carmen. Netrebko's voice does not fit the standard classification of the soprano range. She crosses all levels, from lyric to spinto to coloratura, with phenomenal agility and contol, and with an unbelievable creamy darkness in the middle. From the sopranos seen on available videos, Netrebko's voice comes out as the most natural. She sings as if she speaks. The muscles of her face and neck show no distortion or annoying gimaces- even in close-up-shots- that other excellent sopranos use to project their voices. Netrebko uses her facial muscles only to show emotions, which makes her a unique singing actress. To compare Netrebko to Callas- as some do- is a disservice to both singers. Netrebko is Netrebko, and Callas is Callas. Period. Both are unique artists in their own right with no peers.

In all fairness, Villazon with such a mature, rounded and expressive voice, and a clarion that is rather unusual for a young tenor, Hampson, a lyric baritone of renown, with his smooth, honey-like and powerful but controlled singing, chorus and orchestra playing, are as good as Netrebko but, somehow, her charisma steals the show and she becomes the epicenter of the production. Artistically, musically, emotionally, and theatrically speaking, any production of La Traviata will rise or fall on the strength of its protagonist- Violetta. Netrebko, thanks to Decker's vision, focus, inspiration, and imagination, has become the paradigm and standard of all the Violettas to come: sluttish, witty, manipulative, opportunist, playful, sensual, seductive, and glamorizing and using sex for prosperity; but honest and ready for love. And when, for the first time, she experiences true love that has eluded her all her life, her spiriuality is awakened, and she is transformed, miraculously, into a powerful woman ready for sacrifice, repentance and salvation. Violetta is a complex and multifaceted woman, and Netrebko, with the help of Decker's denuded stage, touches Violetta's inner soul with depth, emotion, and thruthfulness, as it has never been sung, acted or seen before.

Some criticism of this DVD seems to be off base, and maybe it comes out of ignorance or emotional bareness. ""It's vulgar!"" What do you expect? Violetta is a glorified and high-prized prostitute! Spreading her uncovered thighs and legs, with exuberance and enthousiasm, on the red sofa raised by men, tells the whole story with honesty. ""Nertebko in not Gheorghiu. Solti's La Traviata with Gheorghiu is the best Violetta on DVD."" Of course, Netrebko is not Gheorghiu, and we should be thankful for that. Netrebko sings lying on her back, on her side, on her stomach, on all four, and on her knees! And while putting on and zipping up her allegoric red dress of caranal passion, or while unzipping it and taking it off! Netrebko is possessed by the character, as if there is no tomorrow, and constantly moves and acts with utmost discipline and precision. What more can you ask?. Netrebko is not a better Violetta but a different Violetta, and that makes her unique, and not like all the others. Netrebko's Violetta is totally her own, vocally and emotionally, and it can neither be taught nor acquired.
Villazon is a perfect match, vocally and dramatically. Why he has to be compare to ""the young Domingo,"" no matter how flattering? Villazon's voice is more lyrical with more ""Italianate"" timbre and texture.
Hampson, a perfect and equal partner of Netrebko and Vollazon, ""is stilted and cold."" How an upper-crust Parisian novelist is supossed to behave and act when he meets for the first time the living-in hooker lover of his already socially compromised illegitimate mulato looking son?

Warning: this DVD is addictive. The more you watch it, the more you love it. This DVD for an opera fanatic, with a sensitve heart and a critical mind, is a masterpiece destined for eternity. And of course, it sould never be fotgotten that the master behind all this is the genius of Verdi. ""Verismo"" per se was not in Verdi's bag but, in La Traviata, he wrote the most human and the most true opera music of all times that has reached immortality.

2550702,5,B000F3TAOE,"Recorded live at the Salzburg Festival in 2005 this 2-DVD Premium Edition of Verdi's ""La Traviata"", featuring Carlo Rizzi, directing the Wiener Philharmoniker, is a treasure in every way a great opera and great production (staged by Willy Decker and Directed by Brian Large) can be. Filmed in widescreen and recorded for digital sound, every visual and audio advantage that could be given to the cast was offered, including an interesting use of a single set (picture a cinemascope screen and walls lit in soft white or blue) with an occasional tapestry covered couch or two to contrast color against the black and white unisex suits worn by the chorus, and red dresses and robe of Ms. Netrebko. It's not necessary to dwell on the voices of the stars, suffice so say that the performances were lively and vibrant, filled with easy passion and an obvious affection and chemistry that clearly exists between Villazn and Netrebko. This is a sensuous, minimalist production of ""Traviata"" that obviously exploits the sex appeal of Ms. Netrebko and exuberant vitality of Mr. Villazn who does justice to those scenes that require he cavort around in little more than a pair of shorts. For this Premium Edition, the full opera is contained on a single disk; the second disc is reserved for some extras, one of which stands on its own for its sheer enjoyment: ""The Making of . . . video."" This alone is worth the cost of the set because it captured the stars and supporting cast in rehearsal, joking, interacting - and in one particularly funny scene, having Ms. Netrebko lecture Villazon that he uses his hands too much when he sings as she stands behind him pressing his hands behind his back, and using her own arms, under his, to gesture the way she thinks he looks. This was a laugh out loud moment because her feminine gestures are so clearly at odds with his male persona. To warm up to this production you might even want to view the ""making of"" first to understand what it is you will see and why it is staged as it is. This 2-DVD set is a clear ""must own"" because it gives us an updated and far sexier ""La Traviata"" than we are accustomed to seeing, and because the music, both vocally and orchestral, comes across so beautifully.

2550703,5,B000F3TAOE,"When this DVD was released last summer I was reluctant to buy it because I have heard about the ""unusual"" staging, but finally I decided to go for it. And I am glad I did!
Right from the beginning I was taken in and never let go.
Netrebko and Villazon were amazing. Some of the other reviewers have said that Villazon was over the top, and Netrebko's singing was flawed,yes, they are not the best singers I have heard or seen, but I don't recall other Alfredo and Violetta team that create such excitement, and I have been going to the opera for almost fifty years!!

You could feel the wild passion of young lovers in the earlier scenes and their despair of knowing that all is lost in the last act.
In the last act after Annina announces that Alfredo have returned and Violetta and Alfredo run into each other's arms I broke into tears and I think that I cried all the way to the end.
These two people just with their voices and their acting did not need any staging!
I did not care for Hampson's Giorgio Germont, but then I am not a great fan of his,anyhow.
This a DVD that I am sure that I will watch many times in spite of the ""unusual"" staging.",1184976000,5,1150,4.2272727272727275
2550704,5,B000F3TAOE,"I am not usually a fan of old operas done in the modern era. However, this was absolutely superb!  The stars, Netrebko and Villazon were magical.

Now I am 43 and I had the greatest surprise of seeing this opera in a different way, in a modern version, with a perfect couple and the greatest DTS sound, sorry neigborhoods, but I have to listen in a loud and clear sound, because is really wonderfull.

2550706,4,B000F3TAOE,"Opera purists may wince a little at the artistic concept of this
production, but Willy Decker's minimalist setting worked so well
for the Salzburg Festival crowd that this performance has since
became legendary.  (So much so that New York's Metropolitan is
currently planning to revive it.) They're not likely to recreate
this pairing of leads however. This was the first crown jewel in
the blossoming careers of the stunning Anna Netrebko and equally
magnificent Rolando Villazon, making them opera's 'golden couple'
for the decade, and their subsequent work together has only gotten
better.  It all began here though, and if you're any kind of opera
enthusiast, this recording is a must-have. The chemistry between
these two leads make this one of the hottest, sexiest versions of
La Traviata you'll ever experience. Deutsche Grammaphone's quality
is, as always, top-of-the-mark. Enjoy!",1182556800,7,888,5.381294964028777
2550707,5,B000F3TAOE,"Having witnessed the palpable acting skills of both Villazon and Netrebko, one will enjoy this DVD.  Their voices are rich, luscious and the acting only lends credence to the performance.  It is refreshing to see opera updated by Dekker to meet modern tastes rather than the same old staid traditions of the MET.

Thomas Hampson is wonderful in this performance.  The entire opera moves well, both musically as well as plot wise.  It is a performance not to be missed.  Netrebko and Villazon seem to have an innate ability to connect well both emotionally as well as musically.  One should buy their recent duet album as proof of their talents.  Netrebko has also teamed up well with Rolando Villazon and Roberto Alagna in Manon with great success.  Her long awaited debut at Carnegie Hall with Dmitri Hvorostovsky hopefully quell the critics.

Ms. Netrebko has done much to popularize opera and that deserves much credit.  Indeed she has been recognized by TIME as one of the 100 most influential people of the year.  Her I Puritani at MET was thrilling and indeed she may be next Callas-like Diva",1180483200,4,1098,4.81283422459893
2550708,1,B000F3TAOE,"Modern art, whether music or painting or as in this case an opera production has often shocked people in the past, especially near the beginning of the 20th century, but has slowly become accepted by certain critics as having its own place next to the classic masters. This acceptance has, in many ways, opened Pandora's box to a number of totally absurd productions, which for the sake of their ""modern aspects"" have been accepted by some members of the public as ""interesting"". This has happened because some people when faced with such a production do not dare express their dislike in case they are called ""old fashioned"".

This Traviata is such a case taken to the extreme. People are trying very hard to find a trickle of Art in what is purely obscene rubbish. Music apart, it bears no possible resemblance to what Verdi had in mind when he composed this Opera. Composers have used the same theme in a number of different settings in the past, take for example Bernstein's ""West Side Story"". This is based on Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet"", but Bernstein being an honest and great musician gives his work a totally different name, because it is after all a totally different piece of work. Mr Decker who obviously has neither of Bernstein's attributes still uses the title ""La Traviata"" as if what he presents has any resemblance to the actual opera composed by Verdi. It is interesting to note, after watching his equally abominable ""Otello"" that Mr Decker must have strong fetishes, for example the clock in ""La Traviata"" and the cross in ""Otello"".

I just hope that enough people will eventually speak their mind and send the likes of Mr Decker looking for a different job, for which he may after all be more talented.",1179964800,40,1729,4.76

2550710,4,B000F3TAOE,"The outstanding aspect of this production is the stark, sparse stage production.  In a way it forces the viewer to pay attention only to the music.  In my view it does nothing to enhance Verdi's music.

  The baritone adds nothing to the production.  In a way I feel sorry for him since everyone knows of many, previous, stellar performances.  The tenor is better suited to ""fluff"", like l'Elisir d' Amore, but he was OK overall.  Anna Netrebko is just a jewel.  Her presence makes any production a winner.

  That's just my opinion.  George of Denver",1175212800,4,551,4.673684210526316
2550711,5,B000F3TAOE,This version of La Traviata is especially outstanding.  Netrebko's performance along with the wonderful choreography make this a real treat. It is a welcome relief to seeing an opera in the traditional 19th century costumes.,1174608000,4,224,5.4

The chemistry between Netrebko and Villazon is wonderful. The acting of the entire cast is so great! The voices are amazing, sound quality great... Everything about this production is wonderful!

The minimal set really sets the attention on the singing and acting. The voices are so clear and articulate with the primaries mic'd individually.

I hated the stage setting the first time the MET did it with Dessay, and still hate it. Villazon has a wonderful voice as does Netrebko, but this opera is heavy handed and rough sounding. Netrebko sounds breathy in some arias. There is no finesse in this Traviata for me. I am no expert, just love opera.

However this is a very complete, the most complete Traviatat I've ever seen or heard; all the caballetas are included and all the repeats.  It's also very sexy with the second act displaying the lovers in their underwear....not a bad display with such attractive artists.  Thomas Hampson is very dramatic and convincing as Pere Germont.  Of course the updating works against the drama....who in our age would object to the ties between the lovers....there's no bourgeoisie in our world.

These trash productions will do nothing to draw a younger audience to opera.  This staging  is worse than Wagner's Ring Cycle produced after Peter Gelb took over as General Manager of The Metropolitan Opera.
