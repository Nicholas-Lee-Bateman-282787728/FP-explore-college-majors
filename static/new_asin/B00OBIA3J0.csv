6731551,5,B00OBIA3J0,"This movie is absorbing.  I rate this a 5 because of that.  Even though the ending was a little sad, i loved the movie.  I related so much to Rafa and his attraction to his new friend.  The feelings of attraction toward Ibra totally overtook Rafa, and was demonstrated very well throughout the movie.  Guille was Rafa's best friend, and honestly, I think I liked him more than the main character.  He was Rafa's best friend, and the scene near the end, when Rafa was fleeing with Ibra, Guillie felt so much for his friend that he handed Rafa money with tears in his eyes.  Very heart touching moment.  Some scenes were supported by some great music.  The producers did a good job; very good job where I can relate so well to the main character.  It is as if they read my mind and knew how I think.  At the end, i started to tear in my eyes.  Well done.  I wish there was a sequel to this movie, and one that could end on a positive note.",1455321600,,937,4.167597765363128
6731552,4,B00OBIA3J0,"At last a gay film that warms the heart. No sex or nudity for a change and  brilliant in every way. Superb acting, photography, directing and screenplay make this a coming of age film that we have not seen the likes of, in a long time..",1451347200,2,236,4.130434782608695
6731553,4,B00OBIA3J0,"The drama leaves you hoping for more intimacy, but you endure being teased for the movie length.  There is a very brief kiss, and towards the end, you can tell they are ready to 'hookup' for sure, but unfortunately, they are pulled apart.  At first I was offended by the lack of any real connection, but the teasing is actually good drama and works up your passions.  A pretty tame movie, but the sexual energy is powerful, especially from the French boy towards the Algerian immigrant.",1450137600,2,486,4.627906976744186
6731554,5,B00OBIA3J0,"Original title for this Spanish gem is `A escondidas'. Rafa is fourteen and hangs around with his mates - some of whom are less than mature. They are also very `anti Arab' and display the usual teenage attitudes towards sex - being default heterosexual. He plays water polo in his spare time and then his path crosses with a strikingly good looking Moroccan boy called Ibrahim. Ibra as his friends call him lives in a hostel and has no-one back in his native home. The authorities though are falling over themselves to repatriate as many people as possible and do not always want the letter of the law getting in their way.

With that as the backdrop Rafa has an immediate liking for this new kid and goes out of his way to get the attention of Ibra. He is though crossing more than one line by so doing but Rafa is a tryer and god knows we all love one of them - this is their story.

This film is brilliantly acted with a script that gives life and clarity to a very real situation that most of us would never think we would be in. The music is excellent too I spotted the much under rated Fanfarlo in the mix but there is not a full listing on IMDb so I will keep an eye out for the other bands used here as they were all great. Yes this is essentially a gay themed drama but there is no bedroom antics - this is more about teen, first love under extreme circumstances and the friendship that such feelings can induce. I thoroughly enjoyed this and can highly recommend it to not just lovers of gay cinema but anyone who loves a ruddy good love story.",1446681600,3,1554,4.228956228956229
6731555,5,B00OBIA3J0,"I loved the movie and what was nice no sex scenes, finally gay movie about love and not sex, hooray!!
Though it was about a Fifteen year old kid becoming attracted to, I think a 19 year old.

It would seem that the story must have been true to some degree as at the end the writer wanted to say thanks for the love even though they never meet again. The writer was in the movie.

They old thing was the subtitle was in tiny English letters so I had to pause to read it quit a bit.

I'm still give the movie 5 stars because I think it's that good, but hay the just me.

Well got run! Laters people!",1441152000,5,597,3.909090909090909
6731556,4,B00OBIA3J0,"Very touching story of first love and friendship.
The two young actors are great as well as the supporting cast. Well worth the wait for this being released in the US. 4.5 stars",1439683200,2,177,4.393939393939394
6731557,4,B00OBIA3J0,"It seems like I waited forever to finally obtain a copy of this film. With that said the wait was well worth it as I thoroughly enjoyed it. The lead actors did a great job, and the supporting cast was equally entertaining to watch. If anyone is having second thoughts, don't let Hidden Away stay hidden for too long from your library. There was a lot of hype building up to the release of this film here in the States, and rightfully so. I'm very pleased with my purchase, and I can give my official recommendation to anyone contemplating the purchase of this film! Looking forward to seeing more from these actors and filmmakers in the future!",1437868800,9,644,4.512820512820513
6731558,5,B00OBIA3J0,"The film displays itself in a way that you feel the drama. You feel the crush like growing passion. You become the characters, and you become a part of the situations on screen. Wonderful friendship and sensual reality to this story. It is a story weaved together in a dramatic reality that is believable, and most of all, it leaves you with an emotional ordeal.

I don't give the term flawless often when it comes to cinema but I think this film deserves that title and is everything that can be flawless about a film, is captured in this movie. From the amazing script and direction, to the acting. The whole movie is something one must experience to fully understand that statement of flawless. I loved this movie. I felt it captured everything a movie needs. Its equal parts beautiful, and equal parts dramatic. It gives all the emotional baggage of life, love and hate.

There is a multi-cast of young extraordinary actors. German Alcarazuas playing the part of Rafa is your main character, and is something to be seen. He truly is magical in this part. He gives a breathtaking reality to this character that few movies have done before.  Next would be Adil Koukouh playing the part of Ibra. Both are dynamic together. The chemistry on screen by all is perfection. The tight direction and well written story showcases itself through the film. Now I have to mention that this is German Alcarazus first feature film acting. This idea brought my mind to be utterly numb. I cannot believe that this young man has not gifted the movie world with anything else. Thankfully he was able to express his talent in a worthy film for the first time. He aced his part and gave it his all, and more. That is something that ultimately works for this movie, the whole entire cast is amazing. Adil Koukouh is also another actor who only started performing in 2014, the year this movie came out. This film, being only the second acting role for him. Joseba Ugalde playing the best friend, Guille to Rafa, which he gives another powerful performance. Such young actors with a masterly talent is unbelievable. Moussa Echariff, Ana Wagener, Alex Angulo, Eder Pastor, and all the others gave great performances.

6731562,3,B00OBIA3J0,"I wanted to like this much more.  I really liked the setting, and the characters were kids you felt for as they stumbled through their normal teen issues, and had coming out and immigrant/refugee issues thrown in, too.  The subtitles were not timed well, did not catch everything, and I don't think they were always the truest sense of conversation.  Even if I understood Spanish, I am pretty sure I would still find the time transitions problematic to piecing the story together.  It was difficult to figure out the chronology, to identify transitions from current to flashback, and to piece together the proper place for the flashback.  Ultimately, the technical issues with translation to English, coupled with the problematic chronological sequencing left me wanting the story to be told again in a better way.",1486252800,2,814,5.044776119402985
6731563,5,B00OBIA3J0,One on one peoples around the world learn they are one and the same. If only this love could conquer the differences that make nations and cultures enemies.

6731570,4,B00OBIA3J0,"The movie was pretty good and had an interesting setting and plot, but it was kind of dry. It left me unsatisfied in the end and I didn't dislike the movie nor did I love it. The main thing that bothered me about this movie though, is how bad the subtitles were timed to what was actually being said. It took away a lot from the dialogue and the emotion, because everything they were saying I didn't understand until way after they actually said it. Also, the translation just wasn't good. If you're going to watch this movie, I suggest finding it on a different website with better subtitles.",1466467200,,593,4.4495412844036695

6731577,5,B00OBIA3J0,"TLA releasing has a quality DVD movie, titled Hidden Away.  This was a superb movie because both lead actors German Alcarazu and Adil Koukoth absorbed themselves in the roles played to the extent it was alive.  The value of this film is the producer had the viewer arrive at a complete understanding of the times and the culture in the Mediterranean area that is so different in the Western Hemisphere.  The young are confronted with less economic opportunities and restricted societies.  At the same time, the challenges of young teenagers growing up is part of this.
Iharhim is a 14 year old Moroccan boy while Rafa is a 14 year old boy also.  Young Teenage boys and girls experiment with relationships - and sexualities tested also.  Deportation is a constant threat for a Moroccan Teen who has no family in a country like Spain.  I did not accept the presumption that this is a gay first love story.  Rafa is struggling with heterosexual matters also.  However, for two young teenage boys to have an  intense friendship like Rafa and Ibrahim is normal just as youth is fleeting and choices come and go.  I like this film because it was an very good presentation of the universal problems of growing up, balanced by the unique challenges of different regions of the world.  At the end of the movie I was deeply moved by the trauma of Rafa's friends - a boy and a girl who feared they would loose him.  This included the tragic breaking of a bond when Rafa lost the struggle to find a way for Ibrahim to escape the fate of deportation.  Another good illustration of a refugee tragedy, and worthy of 5 stars.",1459382400,,1609,4.580419580419581

8683069,5,B00OBIA3J0,"Story of friendship of 2 teens, Ibrahim, a Moroccan migrant and Raffa a native Spanish boy, growing into love, amid the societal pressures aligned against it: homophobia, xenophobia, refugee issues etc. Refreshingly, the homophobia had relatively minor part here. The acting was excellent as was the direction. The pacing was perfect. It never dragged and was suited to the tempo of the story. Aside from 1 hardcore jerk, there really aren't any caricature villains or unrealistic characters. Just real people with believable conflicts between them or within themselves..Another special relationship that adds to the emotional appeal of this movie is that of Raffa and his best friend Guille who always has his back,  including Raffa's relationship with Ibra, even as he confesses to ""not understanding what's going on"".
*** spoiler alert***I won't reveal much of the story except the ending is indeed sad.  But fear not, our young heroes don't suffer the fate of far too many lgbt characters: - no death by murder/suicide/gay bashing/aids, or any other means. etc. The geopolitics of modern Europe dictated this realistic ending. It was bittersweet though, as the closeness they reached is so  tenderly displayed. I still tear up, as my mind replays it.",1508630400,2,1254,5.2288557213930345
