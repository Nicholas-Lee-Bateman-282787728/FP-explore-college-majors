3070448,5,B0011XVR9S,This was a very well done movie.  I am hoping it will give a a bit of self confidence to the child I got it for.  It does show that children CAN overcome some of the problems with Tourette's.,1362614400,,191,3.871794871794872

3070450,5,B0011XVR9S,"I saw this documentary on HBO.  It is awesome!  I love how the story is told by the children, as their point of view is as genuine as it gets. I am a high school teacher and immediately thought it is something that I would like to show in my classes.  The 30 minute duration is perfect for viewing and discussing in one class period.  However, the price of the dvd is very high!  Why is it so expensive?  If it were $20 or less, I would definately make the purchase.  However, for $60+, I just can't justify the purchase on my tight budget.",1350950400,,540,4.134615384615385
3070451,5,B0011XVR9S,"I just watched this documentary film, and I immediately jumped on Amazon to rate it 5*.  As the daughter of a man who had Tourette's (he passed in '05), I wish I could make this mandatory viewing for...well, everyone!  It profiles several children who are coping with Tourette's, each in his or her own way, and it offers the best insight into what people with T's go through in school, with friends, and with strangers.  I also wish this had been around for my dad when he was a youngster in the '40s and '50s, when there was much less awareness of the disorder, though I am proud to say that overall he was successful in life.  I am so impressed with the children in this doc, who are each so mature in his or her approach to dealing with it.  Major props to them for having the courage to share  their stories for the betterment & education of others!  I wish them even more success and happiness I life than my father had.  :)",1340755200,5,930,4.274285714285714

3070453,5,B0011XVR9S,"Hi I am 15 years old and I have Tourette's Syndrome. Me and my family watched this when it first came out. It is a very good documentary, and I was especially fond of it as it included kids like I was at the time. I have been blessed with the fact that my Tourette's is very mild but unfortunately other's aren't so lucky. This is an excellent video, and, in my opinion, should be shown in every classroom that has a student, who has Tourette's Syndrome. I urge people who can financially afford it, to buy this product, especially if you are a parent with a one or more children who have Tourette's Syndrome.",1245110400,14,609,4.304347826086956
3070454,5,B0011XVR9S,"I am a retired middle school teacher, and I grew up with tourettes.

I have shown this documentary to all my classes over the years, and often use it now as a substitute teacher. It captivates even the most distracted of classes, because it's a video of kids talking about problems that kids face. (Unlike documentarys where adults speak about kids, and loose the attention of my classes in favor of their own conversations between desks.) This documentary never fails to capture each childs focus throughout the film (a perfect 30 minutes which leaves a comfortable time for lead-in and follow-up).

When I grew up with tourettes, no one talked about it, and I didn't even realize what was wrong with me until years later. When parents of my tourettes students find that I understand what and how tourettes is, they are gratefully relieved that someone understands. We all need to understand this challenging condition, and be able to empathize with, and not stigmatize its victims. This video goes a long way toward spreading an understanding amongst peers, and the more we share this information, the easier life will be for children who are forced to live with tourettes.",1235520000,11,1175,4.899497487437186

8242916,5,B0011XVR9S,"I bought this DVD and a book on the subject written by a 9-year old. These were gifts for a friend for her son. She was reticent about watching the DVD. I said I would watch it first and give her my honest opinion. I truly learned so much. It is only 20 minutes long but very well done. You start out feeling sorry for these children but by the end, realize that they will all succeed in spite of this condition. Each child seems to possess some talent, either musical, artistic, or athletic. They are open and just want to be included. They want people to know it is not catching.
