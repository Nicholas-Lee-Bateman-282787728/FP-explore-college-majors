2122921,5,B0002V7U1O,"Our children love to watch the Leap Frog DVD's and truely enjoy learning to read, count and do simple math.  We bought these two (Code Word/Complex words & Math Circus) because the previous two in the Leap Frog series (Letter Factory and Word Factory) are just fantastic. These were no exception. My three year old is learning how to count higher numbers, such as 1-20, and simple math skills like addition and subtraction.  The Complex Words video addresses some of the special rules in the English language, as I have seen other reviews detail.  After watching a Leap Frog video, adults can see how well they really had to think through the presentation of the material to make learning fun and memorable.",1130198400,4,707,4.778688524590164
2122922,5,B0002V7U1O,"My daughter loves anything from the leap frog line.  These videos are great, and she sings along while learning.  This is something a parent can put on without feeling guilty about putting their child in front of.  My daughter has watched them a dozen times, and has already improved her reading and math skills.",1122940800,3,312,4.7407407407407405
2122923,5,B0002V7U1O,"As a homeschooling parent of 8, I've been there - done that with most educational products out there.  A friend recommended these videos to me, and it was only her fervent insistance that they were the best thing out there that made me willing to buy them.  I have to say I have been REALLY impressed! I was hoping my four year old would enjoy them, but I have to admit they have captivated the entire family.  (Even my 13yo ds stops to watch when he enters the room.  Shhh, don't tell that I told you.)  The songs are very catchy, and the kids really do learn from them.  I was shocked to find my 4yo and 2yo were talking about the sounds different letters made and trying to draw them on paper, and my 2nd graders even benefitted from the reviews of long and short vowel sound words.  I've not tried the other Leapfrog products, but these videos have impressed me enough to make me want to try them.",1111968000,47,901,4.264705882352941
2122924,5,B0002V7U1O,These DVD's are great.  They have helped my son to learn basic math and reading and the leap characters are so entertaining he loves to watch them over again!,1106784000,15,158,4.448275862068965
2122925,5,B0002V7U1O,"We bought these to go along with the other Leap Frog DVDs we have.  Our 4 year-old son loves to watch them.  He often insists to watch the DVD again as soon as it is over.

The Math Circus teaches them the basics of counting all the way up to 100.

The Talking Words Factory 2 teaches children to read more complex words.  They learn to say the ""TH"", ""SH"" & ""CH"" sounds.  They learn how silent E makes the other vowel say its name like in ""HIDE"".  They learn that ""when two vowels go walking, the first one does the talking""  as in the word ""wait"".

These DVD's are remarkable learning tools - and  fun!.  I recommend them to everyone.",1104624000,43,635,4.1652892561983474
2122935,5,B0002V7U1O,This was a very nice box set that also came with a very small stuffed animal. Would be a great gift set. It was cheaper for me to by them together than seperate and these are great quallity and kids love to watch them and they learn a great deal.,1255564800,,246,3.94
2122936,5,B0002V7U1O,"Delivered on time and arrived in good condition, and works great
New as promised",1254873600,,80,4.785714285714286
2122937,5,B0002V7U1O,My son has learned so much by watching these videos.  The characters and story that accompany the learning are so entertaining that he wants to watch them over and over.  It teaches the types of phonics lessons that most adults take for granted and would never think to explain to a child.,1248912000,,289,4.538461538461538
2122938,5,B0002V7U1O,Awesome! My kids ages 1.5 and 4.5 love the movies! It is so educational and fun at the same time.  A must see.  I make sure I let my 4-year old see this every other day as part of our weekly goal.  They are really hooked!,1247443200,,221,3.760869565217391
2122939,5,B0002V7U1O,"As a mother of 3, I have to say that every product we have from Leap Frog is excellent. We have tried educational products from so many companies, and none compare to Leap Frog (from the Leap Pad, Leapster, videos, Baby Tad, Fridge Phonics and on and on). You can count on their products to be educational, and entertaining. I only wish the money I had spent on other things (like v-tech toys) was used for Leap Frog stuff. Live and learn, and then buy Leap Frog :-)",1242691200,,466,4.306818181818182
2122940,5,B0002V7U1O,Great DVD's my son is 3 and loves them.  They are helping him to read and learn math.,1240358400,,85,3.7222222222222223
2122941,4,B0002V7U1O,This is a really great series of educational dvd's.  My kids(2.5 qnd 4 years old) prefer the Word Caper to the Math Circus by far.  They get bored of the Math Circus about halfway through the program.,1239753600,,200,4.378378378378378
2122942,4,B0002V7U1O,Our only disapointment was for some reason we thought we were purchasing 3 dvds not 2. But my kids LOVE the leapfrog learning dvds. My 2 yr old son know all of his letters and sounds and my 4 yr old daughter is writing words on her own. . . it's mostly due to the leapfrog dvds and some positive encouragment from us.  My kids ask to watch all of the leapfrog dvds all of the time...they are their favorite movies.,1236124800,,414,4.111111111111111
2122943,4,B0002V7U1O,"My Kids really liked these.  They are intertaining enough that they will watch them over and over.  My children would prefer to watch other shows but they will agree to watch these, if they want to watch TV.",1234051200,,207,4.421052631578948
2122944,5,B0002V7U1O,"The Leap Frog line of educational program was recommended to me by a friend of mine. When I received my order I tryed it out on my PC for my 2 and 5 year old and 3 year old Niece, they was so impressed with what they were viewing that they forgot that they were watching television and instantly got involved in the program. This is a very very very good program your kids do not need you to be there with them, they will learn a thing or two on they own. It is a teacher by itself. i will recommend the Leap Frog line of educational Cds to any parent.",1220572800,,552,3.9375
2122955,5,B0002V7U1O,"My 3 year-old son had great time watching these 2 videos again and again. In less than a month time, he picked up  advance phonic words and getting so much interests in doing simple math. You really don't need much efforts when you have these DVDs.",1216598400,,248,4.391304347826087
2122956,5,B0002V7U1O,"My son already has the other 2 Leap Frog DVDs. When I saw the great price Amazon was advertising for, how could I pass it up. He enjoys the DVDs and always has the stuff frog with him while he is watching. We have other educational DVDs but when he is watching the Talking Word Factory 2 DVD, I can here him attempting to pronounce the words. What a glorious sound to hear. Thank you.",1209254400,,384,4.133333333333334
2122957,5,B0002V7U1O,"THis product is excelent.  My three year old is beginning to understand the concept of silent 'E', blends, and other complex words.  These DVD's are excellent.  Let your child watch them over and over, they'll want to and you won't regret it.",1203206400,,242,4.714285714285714
2122958,5,B0002V7U1O,"Our children enjoy all the leap frog dvds.  They are actually learning letters, sounds and numbers as they are exposed to these concepts.",1168473600,,137,4.956521739130435
2122959,5,B0002V7U1O,My 2 1/2 year old daughter loves watching them. She brings the little Tad everywhere she goes. These are the best DVDs after she has been grown out of Baby Einstein.,1142812800,3,165,4.354838709677419
2122960,4,B0002V7U1O,Loved the Math Circus .... The Talking words factory doesn't rate as high,1142467200,,73,4.6923076923076925
2122961,5,B0002V7U1O,"My son enjoys his Talking Words Factory"" DVD, so when I saw this on Amazon I immediately ordered the set.

While the math one is a bit short, it still interested my son. He loves numbers, so he was willing to work a bit harder to get the concepts.

The Words Factory 2 was as wonderful as I expected. Alec even repeats some of the rules for sounding out words, such as: ""When two vowels go awalking, the first one does the talking"" and ""silent e makes the letter say its name.""

The little frog included in the package was a big hit as well.  My neighbors and I are starting to exchange LeapFrog DVDs and it usually results in ""Oh, I have to get that one now.""",1140998400,6,660,4.1328125
2122962,5,B0002V7U1O,"THE TALKING WORDS FACTORY OF LEAP FROG IS A WONDERFUL TYPE OF SOURCE FOR CHILDREN TO MOTIVATE THEN TO READ. SENCE TED IS VERY EGER TO LEARN, TOO.

2122964,5,B0002V7U1O,"We own four DVDs in this series:  Math Circus, Code Word Caper, The Letter Factory, and the Talking Words Factory.  We bought them when our boys were ages five and three.  We've had them for about a year now, and the boys still enjoy them.  We get a lot more use out of them than the Leap Pads, which our kids never really got into.  Our younger boy is in speech therapy, and seeing these DVDs has improved his articulation of letters.  I love that he requests to watch these.  I will hear him sounding out each letter along with the Frog, and know he's developing skills.  Our older son has picked up on how to build words and spell with this series.  It explains how phonics work, and in a simple-to-understand way.  We found all of the DVDs in this series exceptionally educational, and see tangible results from the children watching them.  I can't say that about any other toy we own.",1134086400,7,889,4.392638036809816

8032554,5,B0002V7U1O,Great video for learning.,1448841600,,25,5.5
8032555,5,B0002V7U1O,"I had this for over 2 years and I could say that my daughter had benefited on this video. When she entered pre-school (4 years old) the teacher was amused on how she can easily put the letter sound together to build a word.  She has a classmate that is a fast sight reader but when given a new word she just does not know what to do. My daughter was not a fast reader at pre-school but she can read any word that her teacher write on the board. She is now in kinder and was way ahead of her other classmates in terms of reading speed and comprehension. Of course she has all the other leapfrog videos to build her foundation prior to starting school.

She was not really interested in Math Circus. She probably watched it 4 or 5 times and lost interest in it. It might be too hard for her to grasp the concept but when similar subject was introduced to her in Kinder, she just picked it up and is now good in adding and subtracting numbers.",1363651200,,940,4.131147540983607
8032556,5,B0002V7U1O,"Love the Leap Frog series so much for my kids, bought this as gift for cousin's kids.  Word Factory helpful in teaching phonics and math circus with numbers.",1357603200,,157,4.607142857142857
8032557,5,B0002V7U1O,We got this when our daughter was 2. She is 5 now but she learned to read with this and with the Letter Factory from Leapfrog also. When we tried teaching her before she did not pay attention but with these videos learning became a game. I recommend it to anyone who wants to homeschool their kids.,1343433600,,298,4.245614035087719
8032558,5,B0002V7U1O,"My daughter is a huge fan of the Leap Frog DVDs and we could not wait to get these two - both are just as good as the other leap frogs.  After watching all of the phonic series and this math DVD, she was well ahead of her peers in preschool and is now reading at 4!",1273968000,,265,3.6491228070175437
8032559,5,B0002V7U1O,"Was worried my daughter wouldn't be interested but the stories really keep her interested and I can tell she's picking up a lot from them. Looking for some more, great alternative to mind numbing cartoons that have nothing to offer.",1265846400,,232,4.825
