8521530,1,B007RVUDPC,"The proclaims aliens are real as we listen to two guys tell us their views on aliens and how they are involved with government and build the pyramids. They were attempting to get achieve footage on Elvis when they came across this film. I was shocked to find out these guys believe Elvis is actually dead and not taken by an alien. We actually get about 10 minutes of film where they apparently remove two organs without weighing them. They also let us know that ""the best [unnamed] special effects guys said they could not reproduce it.""

The testimony of some official named Marcel with a ""higher than top secret"" clearance told people about the alien crash. It never dawns on our narrators that the government uses these guys to run misinformation campaigns.

For those who are really into to pseudo science, this would be a great film. I wasn't buying it. The film has some blurred simulated sex and what looks like a nude female figure at the end because nude midget aliens are not sexy enough.",1444435200,,999,4.606741573033708
8521531,2,B007RVUDPC,"There is not much more than the interview of the two men who acquired and released the autopsy film. Oh, yeah, there is the autopsy. And what's up with what appears to be obscured porn imagery in between the 'featured sections' ? (perhaps some subliminal messaging) Really! Was it necessary? It sure does look like porn. Lots of 'Fluff' imagery in this documentary, not much substance, except for the autopsy.",1399420800,,409,4.857142857142857
8521532,1,B007RVUDPC,"Absolutely horrible! Two guys sit in chairs and out talk one another as they tell us that the Alien Autopsy film was real. The sound is bad, and you can barley hear the interviewer when he speaks. The picture quality is dullish and there's nothing here but a couple of guys talking and a few animation skits showing UFO's flying around.... TERRIBLE AND POOR QUALITY!",1384905600,,366,4.6461538461538465
8521533,5,B007RVUDPC,"We all know the Area 51 story, but I certainly hadn't heard it straight from such respectable sources! A lot of hearsay surrounds Area 51, it was great to hear the story from the horses mouth.",1374883200,,192,4.361111111111111
8521534,5,B007RVUDPC,"Anyone who has studied ufos and aliens knows about the alien autopsy footage. Having said that, this dvd takes it to an entire other level of analysis with expert opinions. Awesome stuff.",1374883200,,187,4.875
8521535,4,B007RVUDPC,"I thought this was so interesting.  First hand accounts of real men's experiences with aliens and everything that naturally seems to surround them--black helicopters, men in black.  It makes you really admire the bravery of those involved that choose to speak out.  There are real forces at work here attempting to keep them silent.",1355961600,,332,5.111111111111111
8521536,4,B007RVUDPC,"When I spend my hard earned dollars on a video I expect new, fresh info on my favorite topic: ALIENS!  I got what I was looking for. I own A LOT of these type of releases and this is on my top ten list. Highly recommended.",1354492800,,222,3.8260869565217392
8521537,1,B007RVUDPC,"This is a documentary with two men tell there story about aliens,area 51 and the autopsy. Almost the whole film is about these guys opinions. The video footage sucks. I could do better with my $100 camera and I'm talking about the interview with these guys. You can find something much better on discovery channel or free online.",1339804800,5,329,4.689655172413793
