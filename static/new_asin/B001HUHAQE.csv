3644434,4,B001HUHAQE,"I really enjoy this movie, which arrived before the estimated date. The only warning I would give parents, is to be aware that it touches the subject of children being sold.  I found that the subject was presented tastefully, but depending on the children's age, you might want to prepare them a little bit.  It was presented in my niece's second grade class after someone had attempted to kidnap a child by the side of the road.  The school thought it appropriate to warn the kids of stranger danger but I feel that they failed to explain the message since my niece, who loved the movie, did not understand it completely.",1390608000,,622,4.585585585585585
3644435,5,B001HUHAQE,"If you love the softer side of Sean Bean, you'll love this movie, and the boy is an endearing child.",1366156800,2,100,4.05
3644436,5,B001HUHAQE,"Think Kids Movie, and you'd be wrong. This is a poignant and thought provoking challenge to an adult's (Sean Bean) commonly held misconceptions about childhood. This British/Dutch co-production handles the story of ten-year-old adoptee Thomas (Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Aaron Johnson) and his ""imaginary friend"" with stark honesty. A dramatic family movie, but not for the youngest children, there is some child endangerment.",1350000000,3,423,5.838709677419355
3644437,4,B001HUHAQE,"I love it !  Tom was fun Thomas is amazing, Shepherd unique. the start , bond between the twins strong, Tom 's father caring but preoccupy with life. New life interest short  yet engaging. Finch silly,but scary even to himself.  Usual kids interacting with each other,
Caring even in a bad situation(the coat scene, and the heart attack guard,) the reward being let go for Thomas' kindness. The ending usual but good.",1333756800,,417,4.763888888888889
3644438,4,B001HUHAQE,"My 8 and 10 year old grandsons loved this movie about 10-year old twin boys who didn't know each other existed.  For adults, there were a few funny parts, but mostly it was very predictable.  There is nothing unsuitable for young children in it - no drugs, no real violence, and no sex.  One odd thing that my grandson pointed out that didn't make any sense -- for the first half of the movie when the kids were separated, the one who was with the financially well off parents dressed like a bum, while the supposedly poor twin dressed very well??  No explanation was given.",1305244800,,574,4.438095238095238
3644439,5,B001HUHAQE,"una de las pocas peliculas que me encanto en todos los aspectos, las actuaciones, las locaciones, la banda sonora, bueno, sencillamente redonda, la recomiendo para toda la familia.",1303948800,,180,5.464285714285714
3644440,5,B001HUHAQE,If you are a Sean Bean fan - this movie is a must see. It was so refreshing to see Sean in such a lovable role:),1298678400,,112,3.3461538461538463
3644441,5,B001HUHAQE,"I've been waiting for MONTHS for the release of this DVD; originally scheduled for April 7th, it has been ""discontinued by the manufacturer"" before the release date.  I cannot believe it!!  This is a wonderful film - identical twin boys, neither aware of the other, meeting and switching identities only to have the inevitable happen.  It's an update on the old story, but a very well done update.  Sean Bean plays the father of one of the boys, in a rare good-guy role that he does well.  The twin boys are charming, impish, and loyal to each other.  Why, oh, why is this film not promoted for family viewing and why oh, why is it not available!",1239667200,23,646,4.478632478632479
8309693,5,B001HUHAQE,"Great Movie! Aaron Johnson did such a great job portraying  both boys, you almost believe they are two different actors.
This is one of Aaron's first movies done in 2002 and now he has gone on to be more of a actor in more challenging roles.",1502755200,,241,4.239130434782608

8309699,3,B001HUHAQE,"Despite a good cast this is a bit dark for a kid's movie, child trafficking being the theme under the 'prince and the pauper ' twin story. Nice to see Sean Bean as the good Dad. And nice to see an artist portrayed as a regular human being too, ordinary, loving, ( not crazy ) struggling to make a living. However, the writing...the story relies too much on what my filmmaker son calls ' the velvet bag ', ( or Mary Poppin's magic satchel ), the last half of the movie depends entirely on a whole series of remarkable coincidences happening one after the other in order for the boys to be saved. You can just hear the writers now, saying "" ...yeah we'll have the pilot girlfriend be the one flying the plane and she'll have this hunch see..."" Anyway, if you love Sean Bean you might want to see this because...wait for it....He lives!",1424995200,3,833,4.346153846153846
8309700,4,B001HUHAQE,"Sean Bean turns in a good role as a loving father of a adopted young boy who is actually one of a pair of identical twins separated at birth who don't realize their twins.  One child goes to public school and the other is in a cruel orphanage that is victimized by a gang of kidnappers who kidnap children, ship them to Africa and sell them in illegal adoptions.  It's terrible but this actually goes on today both in the USA and in Britain.  The topic is handled well in this film.  Aaron Johnson did a very good job playing the two brothers.  A serious film and probable suitable to teens and adults.",1416787200,2,602,4.292035398230088
8309701,4,B001HUHAQE,Good movie,1412985600,,10,4.5
8309702,4,B001HUHAQE,"A nice family film for children over 9.  It deals with child stealing and trafficking in a non-graphic or threatening way, which makes it more
suitable for older children, and it is real enough to keep parents or adults interested.  Fine performance by the lead boy playing 2 parts
well defined so it is not confusing.  It is overall fun and exciting, with excellent effects, and some genuine emotional moments.",1410307200,3,411,4.8428571428571425
