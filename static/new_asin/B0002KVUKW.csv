2101217,5,B0002KVUKW,"Directed by the man who brought us The Mummy series,Stephen Sommers,Van Helsing should be interesting to see. Based on the famous character from Bram Stoker's Dracula Van Helsing,played by Hugh Jackman,who we all know is the vampire hunter in the story. But in this film,he doesn't just go after Dracula,he goes after the famous monsters to grace both books and the silver screen like Frankenstien,The Wolfman and others. I don't think the film will be scary,but I think it will be a fun movie to watch.",1070668800,13,503,4.8604651162790695
2101218,5,B0002KVUKW,"One of the most anticipated films of 2004 is the Universal Pictures release: Van Helsing. Hugh Jackman stars as the Bram Stoker character Prof. Abraham Van Helsing. Though many people remember the vampire killer from the Dracula novel to be a bit older and less active, director Stephen Sommers (of movie series The Mummy fame) is revamping the role to a more youthful and energetic age with a no-nonsense dimeanor. Set in the late Victorian age, Abraham Van Helsing is dispatched to investigate strange reports coming from dark eastern Europe. A world-renown monster hunter, this Van Helsing is a killer not to be triffled with. With a huge array of weapons, he appears to be a cross between Indiana Jones, Batman, and Attilla The Hun. Not only does he confront Dracula (played by Richard Roxburgh) on his mission, but also Frankenstein's Monster (played by Shuler Hensley) and the Wolfman (played by Will Kemp) as well. And these aren't your grandfather's monsters either. Universal Pictures has taken their classic horror monsters and beefed them up with modern heirs for the movie. The Wolfman is no longer a man with a hairy face. THIS version of The Wolfman would give the werewolf in An American Werewolf in London a run for his money. The same can be said of the other monsters shown, which Universal has announced you will be seeing all of. As even the movie's narrator proves to be Dr. Jekyll, you can be sure other Universal creatures as Mr. Hyde, Igor, The Creature from the Black Lagoon, and the Invisible Man won't be hard to find either. Buckle your seatbelts, Universal Picture's Van Helsing is gonna prove to be one of the biggest blockbusters of the year!",1055980800,32,1673,4.8125

Such a fuss over a bit of grave robbing and a patchwork quilt thingy that takes exception to not being called a man.  Enter monster-killer Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman), who religiously collects dead critters, furry or not, putting an end to their reign of terror.  After dispatching Mr. Hyde, and Dr. Jekyll in the bargain, Van Helsings next assignment is Dracula, an old foe.  He is aided by a friar and a vengeful sister (Kate Beckinsale as Anna), whose brother was turned into a werewolf.

In fact, I did not know it was here until I went to IMDB to see who was playing Princess Anna.  The outfit really gives you a new perspective on her form- of acting.  Enjoy this truly entertaining movie.  It is family friendly as it lacks much of a scare factor and does not have nudity or sex.

2101294,5,B0002KVUKW,"I got a sneak preview of the new 4K version of the film and watched it alongside the standard Blu-ray version which I had purchased previously.  The 4K is definitely an improvement: much more detail is visible, the contrasts are sharper (it is an HDR release), colors are more vivid, and I found the sound to be better as well (the 4K release is DTS-X and DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1). Of course you would expect the newer 4K version to be better than the 1080HD and it definitely is. I didn't spend as much time scrutinizing the new regular Blu-ray disc in comparison to the earlier release, but it too looked better and sounded better than the earlier regular Blu-ray release.

Even though the 4K version is superior to the earlier Blu-ray version, it is not as stunning as I found Close Encounters of the Third Kind in 4K or The Bridge on the River Kwai in 4K. Instead it is more comparable to Blade Runner in 4K. That's because Van Helsing and Blade Runner were very atmospheric films and filmed with intentional graininess and dark indoor scenes. Close Encounters and The Bridge had very vivid outdoor scenes where 4K looks more dramatic, like the jungle in then-Burma in The Bridge film, or Devil's Tower in Wyoming in Close Encounters. Once again, this is what you would expect, and even though the colors are more vivid, and the contrasts are more sharp, and the details more apparent in 4K than the earlier release of Van Helsing, it is still an atmospheric film with some graininess in it as the Director and others intended. Just trying to prepare you for what you will see as some are buying 4K to stun friends and relatives. For that I'd recommend Flight of the Butterflies or The Bridge or Close Encounters.  But if you like Van Helsing and I do, you will like it even more in 4K.

There are two discs in this set: the 4K version and the standard re-mastered regular 1080 HD version. Disc 2 also includes bonus material on it such as the following:

  Van Helsing: The Story and The Legend
  Bringing the Monsters to Life
  Dracula's Lair Transformed
  Bloopers
  The usual trailers, still photos, and a couple of other featurettes

And of course you get Frankenstein, Dracula and the Wolf Man all in the same film.  And Van Helsing is there too.  Very intriguing and well filmed and well acted.  Not sure what the final pricing will be but it is good to see that 4K films are being released with more attractive pricing than the 2016 sets which were typically in the $40 range.",1499817600,,2488,4.538116591928251

Andrews Blu-ray Review: VAN HELSING [2004] is a belt and braces fun film that shows proper reverence to the classic monster film genre is thrown into a cauldron for good measure. But when it comes to classic monsters as big budget entertainment, Director Stephen Sommers proves yet again that he knows how to please his audience and fans alike, where he shows us Van Helsing that in the past he has seen nearly as many incarnations as Dracula, but this time he is not just hunting evil vampires, he has also undergone into being a tool of the Church of Rome, who is their get up and go medieval version of James Bond complete with requisite gadget man played by David Wenham as his  mousey side kick friar named Carl.

After a brilliant black-and-white opening, in which the Universal logo dissolves into flame and villagers hunt down Frankenstein with burning torches, we switch to Van Helsing on an assignment in London, there he tracks down Mr. Hyde, whom he is supposed to capture and of course things don't quite go to plan, as Van Helsing is thwarted because Mr. Hyde falls to the ground and is killed outright and changes back to his original form. So Van Helsing is whisked back to the Vatican in Rome where he is assigned to Transylvania and to also thwart the evil plots of Count Dracula, and at the same time meets up with a gawkily humorous young monk named Carl who is assigned to accompany Van Helsing on a vital vampire-destroying mission to Transylvania. Carl the young monk is a bit like a version of 'Q' from the James Bond films, where he equips Van Helsing with a variety of state-of-the-art, as well as stake-of-the-heart gear from his laboratory, including a semi-automatic crossbow, where we get to experience monster mash on steroids.

The VAN HELSING film takes Universals hallowed horror cycle to a new levels, where we get an onslaught of special effects that takes over as Van Helsing is joined in his fight against Dracula and his flying harpies by the gypsy princess aristocratic Anna Valerious [Kate Beckinsale] where her family has been challenging Count Dracula for four centuries and unfortunately her brother Will Kemp who is Velkan [aka the Wolfman] and despite not being in the film that much, puts in an excellent performance, especially when viewing the brilliant CGI effects when he turns into a wolfman. Anna Valerious [Kate Beckinsale], who represents the last in nine generations of family sworn to defeat and kill Count Dracula. If she fails, then none of her family will ever make it out of purgatory. Time is running out and Draculas tasty brides are after her blood. Anna Valeriouss suspicion eventually turns to trust and the two team up to eliminate Count Dracula and his evil nasty vampire bride creations. On top of all that, there are some truly exciting moments, especially the carriage chase while Van Helsing and Anna Valerious are attempting to transport Frankenstein's sweet-natured monster back to Rome for his safety, but turn of events does not allow Van Helsing and Anna Valerious to pursue this endeavour.

The VAN HELSING film proves that $160 million still cannot buy your box office receipts. Still with the opening scenes in stunning black-and-white, is a really amazing touch, especially when we see Dr. Frankenstein bringing his monster [Shuler Hensley] to life. However, the mob with pitchforks and torches shows up to ruin the celebration, as Count Dracula [Richard Roxburgh] points out. The creature is thought destroyed, and we cut to Paris 1888. Van Helsing [Hugh Jackman] is chasing after Mr. Hyde [Robbie Coltrane] with a ton of CGI computer imaging. The battle ends with a dead Dr. Jeckyl and the revelation that Van Helsing's efforts are not liked nor appreciated and so returns to the Vatican, where we find an underground base for the Knights of the Holy Rose, an organization consisting of all of the world's religions.

This is one vampire horror film with a really nice bite. It's a deliciously entertaining thrill ride that pleasurably tweaks new thrills from old stories. Thankfully, little time is wasted on exposition and explanations. The VAN HELSING film is pretty much non-stop action, more thrill ride or video game than story, which is fine with me. The production design is fabulously entertaining and imaginative. The monsters are all re-imagined with a great deal of flair, particularly Frankenstein's creation, one of the best of his many screen portrayals. The CGI effects are exceptionally well done, subtle details add a great deal of depth and atmosphere, and there are many intricate contraptions and a lot of slimy dripping gloop.

You have some really good dialogue that is delivered with a lot of panache. The horror film does not takes itself too seriously enough to have us care about the outcome but has enough of a sense of humour to provide Van Helsing with a cheery sidekick with a knack for weapons technology. Hugh Jackman has all that it takes to be both leading man and action hero. Kate Beckinsale is fine as Anna, the last in the line of her family, which for generations has been dedicated to wiping out the vampires. Upon his arrival in Transylvania, Van Helsing quickly joins forces with Anna [Kate Beckinsale], the Gypsy Princess. Anna comes from a long line of Vampire hunters who have all sworn to kill Dracula. To complicate matters, Anna's brother Velkan [Will Kemp] is bitten by a werewolf and comes under Dracula's power and really puts in a good performance. The rest of the story involves Van Helsing and Anna's quest to defeat the Count and his brides. But in a horror film of this calibre, what matters most of course is the bad guys, and especially Richard Roxburgh is just right as Dracula, sinuous and seductive, and at times can be a little effete, a little theatrical, and at the same time deliciously bloodthirsty.

Hugh Jackman looks totally perfect as Van Helsing, with his terse manner, dark flowing clothing and fearlessness. David Wenham is terrific as Carl, the nervous and frantic friar Van Helsing takes along to assist him. Aside from supplying Van Helsing with a lot of neat gadgets, Carl provides a huge dose of needed comic relief. Kevin J OConnor is also memorable as Igor, alternating between being just plain weird to very funny. As for Frankensteins monster, Shuler Hensley is outstanding, giving the creature the right amount of pathos, intellect, and loneliness.

The VAN HELSING film is outlandish, and is a terrific load of fun to watch and is the perfect way to start viewing a fun filled 132 minutes film that should just put logic on hold, where you sit back, and enjoy director Stephen Sommers ode and homage to the classic Universal horror film genre. On top of all that, the effects are superbly rendered, delivering the thrills and shocks the intended audience will pay to see. Same is true of Allan Camerons spectacularly dark production design, Allen Daviaus superbly judged shadowy cinematography, which is a shame the whole film was not filmed in black-and-white like at the start of the film which was brilliant, plus the coolly inventive Italian costume designer Gabriella Pescucci and the innumerable spectacular visual, special makeup effects by a team so large the end credits take 10 minutes to finish and of course composer Alan Silvestri hits every music cue with an amazing fortissimo, which rounds up all that is good about this very exciting Dracula film, that I feel will have you on the edge of your seat throughout the film and is also a brilliant ending giving us the impression in the hope that there was to be a follow up of a VAN HELSING 2 film.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Universal Pictures has finally brought out the ultimate and solid 1080p encoded image transfer of this film since being originally released in 2004. Arguably the best looking part of this film is the stunning black-and-white opening scene with the Universal logo spectacularly catches fire and then morphing into Dracula in Frankenstein's laboratory. The black images are at optimum levels and the lighter white colours on screen contrast perfectly. The Transylvania scenes are given a wonderful bluish hue, which most represents the overall feeling of the very eerie town setting. Also with the bluish tinge is contrasted perfectly when bright red blood is introduced. Textures and the faces of the actors are visually maxed out in great detail. So overall it is a totally brilliant looking transfer and the best you will ever see with this 2017 re-mastered Blu-ray disc upgrade, and I am so glad I waited for this release.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Universal Pictures brings us an excellent 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, that is certainly loud and certainly has the wow factor, and is packed tightly with rich, deep bass and aggressive surrounds. Much like the film itself, especially the sound mix for every action sequence is flooded with Alan Silvestri's bombastic film music score, which really gives the film the panache excellence it deserves. What is also excellent is the sounds are constantly moving throughout all the channels, and the wheels are turning and creaking, wind howling, and lightning striking all are just some of the clear sound effects that pepper throughout the audio track. What I also liked is hearing the demon wings swoosh by in keenly implemented pans with the thunderous sounds ripple outward in rolling waves throughout the speakers, and hearing the crowd of surrounding villagers seething with monster-hating animosity to great effect. So all in all this is a totally awesome brilliant audio effort.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Feature 2004 DVD Audio Commentary with Director Stephen Sommers and Editor/Producer Bob Ducsay: As the Universal logo turns into black-and-white and explodes before our eyes Director/Writer/Producer Stephen Sommers introduces himself and says that sitting next to him is Bob Ducsay who informs us that he is the Editor/Producer for the film VAN HELSING, who informs us that it is very bad to have two jobs when working on a film, especially this one. Stephen Sommers informs us that he originally wanted to use the old black-and-white Universal logo, but felt in the end that people would assume they were about to watch an old original Universal Dracula film, so realised this was not a good idea in the end. They both give great praise to the Cinematographer Allen Daviau in giving the ultimate filming experience at the start of the film to be in black-and-white, which they comment you do not always get a chance to use fantastic black-and-white images in a film these days. They both talk in great praise about the actor Hugh Jackman and the reason they hired him to appear in the film, because someone saw him on the London stage in the musical Oklahoma and felt he would be so ideal for the vampire hunter Van Helsing. When we first meet Kate Beckinsale, we are informed that her previous film was Underworld and they were not sure if Kate would be keen or even interested to appear in this VAN HELSING film because of the storyline of the film to do with vampires, but it seems Kate was more than keen to appear in the film and they really praise Kate in doing a wonderful job in the film. Both of the commentators keep mentioning Kates different hair styles throughout the film, especially the creepy scene in the house where her werewolf brother appears. What really irritated me about this audio commentary is that both commentators kept going on about the scenes where everyone is flying about, especially the extras, and kept going on about how it was all done with wires, especially with the camera, well talk about stating the obvious and really got on my nerves and was certainly the most boring aspect of this audio commentary and I just wished at times they would have just shut up and let us the audience work this out for ourselves and treating us like idiots. On top of all that, what also really annoyed me and got on my nerves is that three quarters of the time the two commentators throughout the audio commentary would talk about totally vacuous technical information that is not of any interest to me in just going on about all aspects of the film that would only be of interest to people who were personally involved with the film industry in general. When you see Hugh Jackman near the end of the film when he changes from the werewolf back to his human form and realises Kate Beckinsale is dead, when they did the first preview screening people could see Hugh Jackman was 100% naked and people in the audience, especially the women, would comment on seeing his naked backside, so when the film went on general release they felt they had to CGI some small shorts on him, because the men in the audience felt uncomfortable seeing his naked backside, so they felt they had to do a compromise on what you viewed. So ends this 2004 DVD audio commentary and both commentators thanks us for joining then in viewing the film VAN HELSIN with them and hoping you enjoyed their comments, well to me that is debatable.

Feature 2004 DVD Audio Commentary with Richard Roxburgh, Shuler Henley and Will Kemp: Here we are introduced to Richard Roxburgh who informs us that he played Count Dracula, next up is Will Kemp who informs us that he played Velkan [aka the Wolfman] and finally Shuler Henley introduces himself and informs us that he played Frankensteins monster, and all three inform us that this is the first time they have viewed this film and seeing the Universal logo catch fire is very cool to them, as well as watching the black-and-white sequences of the film, and in fact wished the whole film was in black-and-white. Shuler Henley informs us that his face alone took four and half hours make-up time before arriving on the film set. They talk extensively about Hugh Jackman who used to get up at 4:00am to do a long workout in the gym and also use to just eat celery and nuts to keep his body well muscular. They also inform us that Kate Beckinsale also had a mad diet regime, whereas the three commentators said they ate anything that was available. One thing that really annoyed me about this particular audio commentary is that the three of them keep going on about that they don't remember that scene being filmed, keep going on about great wire work, keep saying that oh doesnt that look great, and so in the end it just ends up with total verbal garbage and total vacuous nonsense and totally boring, to the point I kept dropping off to sleep, if they cannot say anything interesting, then as far as I am concerned they should shut up and be quiet, as they just point out stuff that is stating the obvious. So from then on we get lots of gaps and when they do say something it is not very interesting and one wonders why they were asked to do this particular audio commentary. So all in all I can only give this audio commentary a two star rating, which is an effort in itself and if you like hearing actors rambling, then this one is for you.

Special Feature: Bloopers [2004] [480i] [1.37:1] [5:39] Here we get to view the usual run of the mill deleted scenes from the film VAN HELSING.

Special Feature: Monster Eggs [2004] [480i] [1.37:1] [1:53] here you get to view three separate features, which consist of Hugh Touchdown; Shuler in ice and Shuler in Training. With this particular feature it is basically a combination of Bloopers and behind-the-scenes outtakes that personally should have been added to the proper Bloopers special feature. How does one even attempt to explain this special feature or why it is called Monster Eggs? I still do not know why, or what the aim for this particular feature is meant to be, but I have already spent too much time writing about this feature than it than it takes to watch this extremely very short blip of a feature, which is a totally pointless extra and a complete waste of time and effort. As usual you can either watch them separately or Play All.

Here you can control a PiP option within the movie to control whether or not you want to see interviews or behind-the-scenes footage while the movie is playing.

Finally, VAN HELSING [2004] is definitely packed full of exciting and thrilling action film. VAN HELSING could be in my mind classed as classic horror cinema, but more could also be concluded perfect popcorn Dracula film genre and ideal for the viewing in the  ghoulish or Halloween holiday season or whenever the mood takes you. You should just turn off your mind, as it will definitely give you some silly, if perplexing, fun. The VAN HELSING film is a non-stop spectacle roller coaster ride that will be enough to satisfy anyone who really enjoys this horror cinema genre and especially the many fans of this film. That said, the film does boast of some really handsome audio/visual package with this excellent Blu-ray discs. The Blu-ray Disc release is a complete reference material all the way, so why not show off your home cinema theatre system to your friends and family and I can assuredly say this is a brilliant 2016 Blu-ray upgrade release without a doubt. Highly Recommended!

2101360,5,B0002KVUKW,"The monster movie I'd been waiting for. A retelling of Universal's beloved characters in one motion picture.

I saw this in theaters and was blown away. Watching years later, yes the script can be campy, yes Beckinsale makes an awfully hot looking Transylvanian noble for it to be from the 1800's (the quality of the projector slide's photos at Helsing's briefing slayed me) but the action makes up for all of it.

Wolf-like wolfman? Done. Rapid fire crossbow? Done. Kinky undead polygamy? Got it. Oh, and Wolverine is the monster hunter Van Helsing. Sold.",1480377600,,556,4.904255319148936

It will keep you on the edge of your chair, particularly the end! See this movie for the scenery alone - it's that good.
Jackman gives a  great performance as Van Helsing. Richard Roxburgh plays Count Dracula with a refreshing and great interpretation of that character, while I didn't even recognize Kate Beckinsale at first due to her costume and ""Transylvanian accent"".  Kate is so hot she could make anything look sexy, even a potato sack! In this action film, Beckinsale plays a great heroine and it really showcases her acting skills.

2101500,3,B0002KVUKW,"Okay, where to start? (Sign.....) They didn't think that the audience would notice something familiar about the storyline, but I sure as heck did. It's Wolverine caught up in the middle of a monster mash which was created by Universal's legacy! The title character was originally a scientist, and one of the most brilliant men ever created by Bram Stroker, but the idea of changing his name, and turning him into an Indiana Jones ass kicker is too silly for his own good. To Hugh Jackman's credit, he pulls it off, and makes us holler and cheer for him!
For the story, a knight from the holy order in the dark ages was vowed to never stop (his family), until Count Dracula is vanquished from the face of the earth. Dracula needs the Frankenstein Monster, in the meantime, to give life to his children, so that they can create more vampires, and wipe out mankind. Doesn't this feel like it was written by a kindergartner or what!?
For the characters, all the ladies are pretty hot! Kate Beckinsale makes a bad Romanian accent, but is a serviceable sexy badass. Richard Roxberaugh is ""meh"" as Dracula, he tries to be menacing despite the films goofy factor, but is cool as a gargoyle/bat. David Wenham as Helsing's sidekick Carl the Fry is enjoyable to watch no matter how silly he is. The brides of Dracula, Marishka, Alera, and Verona, are some of the hottest women whom I've ever seen up until that time, but oh man, do they mail in their performances or what!? It felt like a live action cartoon, because that's basically the whole film! At least the warewolf transformation scenes were tight, and the final battle between the count and our hero were sweet! Some of the effects look dated, but that isn't too distracting. So in the end, this movie is worth checking out again! Just don't expect it to be anything serious!",1446249600,3,1823,4.612307692307692

2101564,5,B0002KVUKW,"First thing you need to know when going into this movie, is that it is NOT a serious, gory movie. It wasn't intended to be. No, this film was made to be lots of fun, a little lighthearted, and even a little funny. What I loved about Van Helsing is that it doesn't take itself serious. It's got quirky characters and humorous dialog.  The film is filled with references to the golden age of black and white horror, yet has new take on all of our favorite monsters. Speaking of monsters, the monsters in this movie look seriously awesome. For example the werewolf looks ferocious, but makes you think of a rockstar in a cool kind of way. I felt like the movie was created when a couple of guys were hanging out and said, ""Who would win in a fight; a werewolf or a vampire? What about Frankenstein?"". Just trust me, you're gonna want to see this film.",1426896000,,848,4.333333333333333

2101598,3,B0002KVUKW,"Van Helsing tells the story of the greatest hunter Gabriel Van Helsing,who is assigned an enormously difficult task of tracking down three monsters that he has yet to encounter in his hunting career. It acts as a tribute to the monster films of the 30's and 40's.

Anna Valerious calls upon Gabriel Van Helsing,a monster hunter to go to Transylvania to bring down supernatural beings that her family has been fight against for many generations now throughout the decades. They happen to be Count Dracula,a creature named Igor and a hideous monster that is misguided by Dr. Frankenstein. Adding to the trouble is Anna's brother who has turned into a bloodthirsty wolf at full moon.

As mentioned above,this is a tribute to monster films by Sommers. That is why the clichs of archetype horror/monster films that was done in the past was maximized in it. Added to that,it was consists of great production values as well as it has a lot of CGI- laden special effects scenes that the viewer will be more entertained or better yet feel overloaded by it that the characters and the story has been minimized to a lesser degree. As for the action scenes,it can also become too long and tiring that one who watches it would feel unleashed from the film after watching it.",1418860800,,1261,4.7272727272727275

moves his arm as if dancing, and even twirls around. I do wish these adventures

The actors get it right, Stephen Sommers, the director gets it right, especially with the nod to his father in the credits, a real passion project...that sealed the deal for me.

2101672,4,B0002KVUKW,"A lot of people trashed this movie.  It really wasn't that bad.  Sure it was made in Hugh Jackman's heyday when anything with his name on the billboard would sell, but this doesn't mean it wasn't without merit.

Van Helsing (Jackman), working for the Vatican, is sent to Transylvania to stop Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) from using Frankenstein's (Samuel West) research for nefarious purposes.  Throw in the ever popular wolfman and Dr. Jekyll (Stephen H. Fisher) and Mr. Hyde (Robbie Coltrane) and the always fetching Igor (Kevin J. O'Connor).

Jackman's character, oddly enough, is somewhat believable even though the entire movie is cartoonish.  After all, there is the all star line up of monsters in which Van Helsing and sidekick Carl (David Wenham) must deal with as well as Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale).  It's a fun movie.  And it IS a movie.  Leave it at that.  It was there for entertainment purposes not education.  The gadgets Van Helsing gets to use are the same ""toys"" a 1700s James Bond would have loved to have had.",1407974400,4,1039,4.88

It's sort of an enjoyable movie, but to make the movie better you have to change the plot and then everything else.

2101739,3,B0002KVUKW,"For those with some knowledge of classical English literature, the character of Van Helsing should bring to mind the Dracula novel.  In this film, Van Helsing is transformed into a tough, macho, hero adept at various weapons along with hand to hand combat.  His task is to hunt down and capture the various supernatural creatures that can prey on man; like the werewolf and vampires.  The movie starts with a prelude featuring the brides of Dracula trying to capture Frankenstein's monster.  The film then speeds forward to the day our hero is dispatched by the Vatican to hunt down Dracula.  The film then zig-zags across Europe as our hero and his sidekick meet up with Anna, played by the beautiful Kate Beckinsale in a role all too similar to her role in the Underworld Trilogy.  Together they go to Dracula's castle where they dispatch him and his offspring in a climatic battle.  Though rated as a horror movie, there is nothing really scary as the film proceeds more like a gory action film with a little fantasy and a lot of suspense mixed in.  Hugh Jackman, fresh of his X-men role, fits perfectly into the role of Van Helsing.  The special effects of the film were quite good as all the monsters seemed very real.  The cinematography was quite beautiful, with awesome shots of various European cities and the countryside.  All in all, a good action film to watch.",1382140800,2,1373,4.702928870292887

2101771,4,B0002KVUKW,"Take a drink for every time a human character flew through the air. Though if you play, you may die ten minutes in, so I don't recommend it. The movie is ridiculously action-packed, but it's fun, and the plot is simple enough to follow, despite all the convoluted mumbo jumbo it throws at the audience. The visual effects are very good up until the end, where werewolf-Van Helsing fights Dracula. I'm guessing the effects company ran out of time and had to cut corners to complete the work. Dracula's hair and Van Helsing's fur looked fake while they were fighting.

Despite the shortcuts, the movie is a visual feast. The cinematography is colorful and lends a wonderful texture to the world. Alan Silvestri's music sets the mood perfectly, and the actors have great chemistry. I'm one of the few people who loved Kate Beckinsale's Transylvanian accent.

2101781,3,B0002KVUKW,"I have a feeling that with few exceptions the Frankenstein Monster, Wherewolves and Vampires, can can be gratifying in horror or comedy films, not both. That was my problem (perhaps the key factor was age); I could not differentiate the elements of humor from those of horror/adventure. That in turn led me to the avoidance of any real fear for the lives of the key characters and no sense of awe at the assorted monsters including Frankenstein's and Dracula. It was pretty much like a trapeze act with a net to catch them safely if they fell; one admires their skill, but has no fear for their lives.
These aspects of the film apart, what was left was well done, the acting, such as it was,  suited the occasion, the stunts were good ones and the action nearly continuous (which was a good decision on the part of the creators). My minimal TV equipment, as compared to that in a movie house or at home with a full set of top visual and sound reproducers, meant I was seeing quite a different film than did those who had better equipment.
In sum, it was pleasant but not exciting viewing for me. I imagine those who are younger or better equipped will get more, perhaps a good deal more, than did I.",1366675200,,1199,4.425339366515837

2101784,4,B0002KVUKW,"This movie starts with a bang, and never let up. The continuity scenes, shot in black and white, tie this film into the with classic Universal horror movies. It is set just after the end of the Universal ""Frankenstein"".

The interlude scene with Mr. Hyde was interesting. Comparing the fight scenes with the CGI used for the Hulk and Jabba the Hut in Star Wars shows just how far the technology and acting has come in the past twenty years.

Creature design for the Frankenstein Monster was well thought out, with just enough of a nod to Karloff's body dynamics and voice as the Frankenstein monster to keep it recognizable. The CGI and makeup for Adam (The monster) has clear descent from Jack Pierce's design, (which was based on early 20th century anatomy), was enhanced nicely by the four section glowing, crackling skull and lightning effects, which were also present in the monster's heart.

When asked what he wanted the simple response- ""To Exist!"" was brilliant! No need for anything else.

Wisely, the studio didn't try to imitate Lugosi's Dracula. The visual transformations were beautiful, though I didn't find this Dracula as creepy as the Lugosi portrayal. This Dracula is certainly as evil as any other on screen, but he is a complex being, driven but lacking in some basic human emotions-providing a nice development that I hope Universal will pick up on in another movie down the line.

The brides of Dracula were well-designed, the actresses beautiful, and were believable as the undead brides who are immortal, bereft of higher reasoning faculties, cruel, devoted and more than a little terrified of their master.

Lon Chaney Sr., the first choice to play Dracula in the 1930's for Universal,  had an on-screen homage in the makeup and visage of the village Undertaker. This character and his clothing is clearly based on Chaney's makeup in ""London After Midnight"", an unfortunately lost silent movie.

Van Helsing's side kick provided just the right amount of humor to break up some of the scenes.

Hugh Jackman does a good if not outstanding job as a driven monster hunter unaware of most of his past. One can only wonder what sort of sins warranted a memory wipe as part of his penance.  How did he come to be taken in by this Brotherhood of Monster Hunters?

The werewolves were different from those in other Universal Pictures, ""The Howling"" series or ""Underworld"". Each new generation of CGI and makeup provides us with fuzzier- and much bigger-werewolves. Designers might consider dropping the dog as a template for this creature and use an extinct bear-dog or similar canid that was bigger and scarier than a wolf. The werewolves simply did not move in a believable manner.

The scene of death by artificial sunlight in Dracula's Palace was interesting, if lifted from a Quentin Tarantino movie some years back, where the vampires were killed by sunlight reflecting off of a disco ball.

Kate Beckinsdale was stunning as an acrobatic gypsy trying to save generations of her family from their badly conceived (in my opinion) bargain with the Church. It was never clear what her plan was for killing Dracula, as she knew that everything in her arsenal was ineffectual.

In all, a good movie. Not a spectacular box office success, but I do hope in a few years for a sequel or prequel built around Gabriel.",1366156800,3,3329,4.858657243816254
2101785,4,B0002KVUKW,"This Is a Great tribute to the old cheesy plot lines of the old Universal Monster Mash series. Of those movies Frankenstein meets the Wolfman was the best of them However the series plotline dipped in quality with House of Dracula and House of Frankenstein. The only time the formula for all three monsters mashing upon the masses successfully was the great Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein...And so does Van Helsing, Kind of. You see Why I prefer this movie to the unscary Indy knock off the Mummy is because it has two great leads doing their jobs extremely well instead of only just Brendan Frasier who is Awesome. this movie is really cheesy and I am totally a fan of Cheesy movies and this one Has all my favorite Universal Monsters. This movie is pure moviemaking cheesefest, which is exactly not only what Stephen Sommers does well But has done in virtually all of his movies. However this movie has one more redeeming quality to it The Director formulates an intricate plot far beyond what they did in the The House of Dracula/Frankenstein series. This Plot which involves all the monsters and is quite impressive Unites the Main Hero And Heroine Into the heart of Darkness. What is great is the Acting is completely serious in this Cheesefest. You have to respect actors who can do that. While the Movie technically is not exactly good, it isn't bad either. It gets really good if you enjoy cheesy movies like I do.

A plot driven adventure to be sure, so don't spend time looking for some deep character arc.

However, what really sets this movie apart from most of its genera is the character development, which has provided practical real-world insights into the mindsets of narcissists and criminal psychopaths. The use of contemporary American/English dialect (i.e., not ""archaic"") presented in a fantasy milieu has made the villains more comprehensible to those who might be initially upset by the chilling ""reality"" of real-world villains (such as contemporary serial killers, fraudsters, and similar ""parasites"" and ""vampires"").

In addition to its value as entertainment, the movie also serves as a valuable teaching tool for those studying abnormal psychology, and provides several good character studies for those whose careers involve working with society's most evil (made more palatable in the movie as mythical beings, but symbolic of villains who are far too real).

Worth watching several times.",1363478400,2,1132,5.807228915662651
2101799,3,B0002KVUKW,"Note: I saw this via XFinity On Demand.

Stephen Sommers' follow-up to THE MUMMY and THE MUMMY RETURNS is a mixed bag of an homage to the classic Dracula, Frankenstein and Wolfman films of the 1930's and 1940's. The script suffers from a lack of character development for Van Helsing, especially in explaining his tortured past, of which we hear a bit from Dracula in one scene and a bit more during the intense climax. Kate Beckinsale's character, however, is well-developed. The score is quite good, and is reminiscent at times of THE MUMMY RETURNS. The acting is excellent from Hugh Jackman & Kate Beckinsale (sporting a very credible foreigh accent; is it Romanian?). The same, however, cannot be said for Richard Roxburgh as the main villain Dracula. He came across as somewhat effeminate and too over-the-top to be truly menacing. I think Gary Oldman would have made for a much more intriguing villain, as he had already played the Count to maximum effect in Bram Stoker's Dracula, which I consider to be the definitive film version of the novel by Mr. Stoker. And what was that nonsense in the middle about Dracula having babies? Can vampires actually procreate as humans do? Suspension of disbelief is required, but here, it flies out the window once this plotline is introduced.

I recommend this film for one-time viewing only.",1362960000,2,1337,4.88546255506608

2101807,2,B0002KVUKW,"The unfortunate success of Stephen Sommers' disastrous THE MUMMY RETURNS awarded him an unrestricted creative license to meddle with the remaining Universal Monsters in VAN HELSING. The legendary monster hunter embarks on his greatest adventure yet, as he tries to stop Dracula from using the Frankenstein Monster's seed to create an army of fledgling vampires that will soon take over the world! How Frankenstein's monster dong ever got involved in this story, the world may never know. Sommers continues to show a complete disdain for logic, reason, and reality, preferring instead to create the most over-the-top and ridiculous action sequences imaginable. Normal is never good enough for Mr. Sommers; every scene must be taken to the extreme, no matter how unnecessary the shot may be. There can be no suspense when impossible feats are being performed by unextraordinary heroes. VAN HELSING is not only a trial in excess, but also in bad acting. As if Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale were not bad enough with their preposterous accents and overblown theatrics, Sommers brings on character actor Richard Roxburgh in one of the most flamboyant portrayals of Dracula that audiences have ever seen! For all of the millions of dollars that Universal invested in state-of-the-art motion capture technology, greenscreening, computerization, and compositing, the film looks like s***. It is unconvincing and instantly dated at best, cartoony at worst. The updated monsters fare no better, and pale in comparison to their former selves. None of this even addresses the brainless script that haphazardly ties everything together. VAN HELSING is nothing but an over-budgeted effects show laid out over poorly drawn characters and a harebrained plot.

2101825,4,B0002KVUKW,"I have a special affection for Van Helsing!

I saw it in the cinema a week or so after breaking off what had become a rather joyless engagement. This film represented everything that I had been missing in my life prior to the break up: fun, adventure, fantasy, overindulgence, the list goes on. Van Helsing put a big goofy smile back on my face!

All that aside, this is a mad, silly, overblown epic, that you are either going to love or hate. Its a bit like Hudson Hawk, you either get it or you don't. This film is homage to the old movies, not to the books of classic literature. Performances from everyone are over the top, not just ham, but great juicy ham and cheese croissants. In particular, Richard Roxburgh deserves a Hamoscar for his Dracula. It is truly a masterpiece of hysterical overacting (which Roxburgh clearly is very aware of) and worthy of some overblown Broadway musical. In fact, Van Helsing the Musical could just work!

Visually, the film is an absolute treat, castles, landscapes, costumes, props, (the ladiezz), everything.

Can I recommend it to you? Yes and no. Like I said, you have to get where its coming from. This is not a film to engage your brain, but a fast moving rollercoaster of spectacle. If you are up for it, then ride it!",1355184000,,1265,4.535087719298246

2101828,3,B0002KVUKW,"Although writer/director Stephen Sommers had an unexpected hit with 1999's ""The Mummy,"" he went overKILL with the 2001 sequel ""The Mummy Returns,"" a prime example of modern blockbuster dreck that's full of explosions and ""exciting"" things going on, but somehow is strangely boring. That's the problem with 2004's ""Van Helsing,"" although not as bad.

THE PLOT: In 1887 Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) teams up with Anna (Kate Beckinsale) in Transylvania to fight Dracula, his three lovely but vicious brides, the Frankenstein monster, werewolves, vampire babies, etc.

It won't take long for the viewer to perceive that ""Van Helsing"" shouldn't be taken too seriously. It's a partial parody/homage of the classic Universal monster movies and part serious, just barely. Imagine ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" (1992) with the over-the-top thrills of Indiana Jones and the flair of classic monster parodies like The Vampire Happening (1971) or ""Young Frankenstein (1974) and you'd have a good approximation.

The film looks good, but there's too much CGI and some of the monsters look really cartoony, like Mr. Hyde and the werewolves. Others look quite good, like the flying vampire brides and Frankenstein's monster. As was the case with ""The Mummy Returns"" the film is strangely tedious despite all the manic happenings. Thankfully, there are worthy hints of depth, e.g. the Frankenstein monster and Anna. I wish there was more.

Speaking of Anna, Kate Beckinsale is definitely one of the highlights here as she looks stunning throughout in an amazing form-fitting costume and thigh-high boots seemingly appropriate for the late 1800s (speaking as someone whos not even a Beckinsale fan). Josie Maran and Elena Anaya are also striking as two of Dracula's wives, Marishka and Aleera. Needless to say, excellent job on the female front. On the other side of the spectrum, Jackman is a great, masculine leading man, perfect for the role. Richard Roxburgh (Dracula), David Wenham (Carl), Kevin J. O'Connor (Igor) and Shuler Hensley (Frankensteins monster) are all entertaining or effective.

At the end of the day, though, ""Van Helsing"" barely rises above the limitations of what it is: a big, dumb modern blockbuster with all its over-the-top trappings. Considering the $160 million thrown into it, it shoulda/coulda been better. The story needed time to breathe and less constant mania. The movies also over-long at 2 hours and 11 minutes. Still, it's better than ""The Mummy Returns"" and there's enough here to make it worthwhile, if you're in the mood for this type of fare.

THE FILM WAS SHOT in the Czech Republic, Rome and Paris with studio work done in Southern Cal and Orlando, Florida.

2101836,5,B0002KVUKW,"As a fan of action/adventure films, I truly enjoyed this movie. Anyone who likes films that include adventure, action, history, numerous characters, subplots, and some humor will no doubt enjoy Van Helsing.

The plot is revealed summarily as this: Van Helsing must go to Transylvania and destroy Dracula, at the instigation of the Vatican in Rome. By doing so, he will aid the family of the Valerious in their entrance to Heaven. Dracula was not destroyed by any of the Valerious, so generations of them are apparently all waiting together at the Gate of St Peter. They currently are stuck there in limbo until Dracula is destroyed and the curse is lifted. There are only two of the Valerious left, so time and aggression are paramount to the mission. Van Helsing arrives to find that his work will not be so simple, as the people there have found that traditional techniques of destroying vampires does not work on the famed Dracula who, once again, is the main target. Only by a secret method, never before known and discovered by the Latin-fluent Friar Carl, will work to eliminate Dracula.

Many classic creatures of legend occupy the screen throughout the film. Frankenstein, Igor, Dracula, Dr Jekyll/Mr Hyde, werewolves, vampires, and a host of wonderful medieval-like characters provide a wonderful array of interesting and thoughtful figures and personalities which many will like. The main part of the film is set in Transylvania, at the turn of the 19th century. The mise-en-scene of the film is simply fantastic, given the central subject of monster-hunting in Europe during the late Enlightenment Period. The sense of foreboding and darkness throughout the entire film is never absent. (Think of Tim Burton's 1989 ""Batman"" film or his 1999 ""Sleepy Hollow"" interpretation. It is quite the same in this film, although this work was directed by Stephen Sommers of ""The Mummy"" fame.) It seems that there is always danger lurking around every corner for Van Helsing and his friends. And if not at risk of being murdered by the local peasantry, then the danger comes at the expense of the fierce monsters whom he is hunting. I also loved the way that humor was mixed in with the theme of adventure, action, and monster-hunting. Hugh Jackman (Van Helsing) and David Wenham (Friar Carl; Mr Wenham was also Faramir in ""The Lord of the Rings"" 2 and 3) are a wonderfully entertaining and comical duo, and are well-remembered long after the film. Add in the colorful and unique Kate Beckinsale, and the duo becomes an even more fun and interesting trio. The main villain of Dracula, played by Richard Boxburgh, is absolutely cool. His performance was downright awesome and memorable. He had a fun mix of anger, ambition, humor, and class. Indeed, he is quite the conflicted monster!

Van Helsing and his friends go on monster hunts and adventures, fighting with state-of-the-art weaponry and inventive techniques for ridding the world of monsters. And the CGI is stunning and amazing, and in and of itself could make for an interesting watch. Everything about this film is excellent.

Watch ""Van Helsing"" for a great time, especially around the Halloween season. Get your friends together, and hold on for a great and fun adventure!",1352505600,3,3232,4.968576709796673

2101842,4,B0002KVUKW,"As mid October rolls around, brisk winds sweep through the crisp autumn air, jack o'lanterns decorate steps and porches, the scent of wood smoke radiates from wood stoves, and the leaves are in their peak season of color. October is a magnificent month, and in celebration of its annual visit, I've decided to review a few great flicks for the Halloween season. The titles that I've chosen to review are ""alternative"" Halloween movies... not the classics that generally spring to mind, but fun movies with elements of the supernatural. Just good, lighthearted stuff here... nothing gory or scary!

""Van Helsing"" is my favorite Halloween movie of all time. Film purists complain that this movie is low brow, or that it defiles the canon of classic monster mythology. But this isn't true! ""Van Helsing"" is about having a good time, while putting a fun spin on the heavy hitters of our monster classics- Dracula, the Wolfman, and Frankenstein's Monster. Heck, even Mr. Hyde makes an appearance, as well as a few other interesting beasties. Hugh Jackman's performance is just right, with a good balance of comedy and action chops. Looks great on Blu-ray, and there's nothing in here that's too gory or scary for the kids. A great Halloween movie to enjoy with friends and some hot chocolate.",1350518400,3,1287,4.9308755760368665

2101845,2,B0002KVUKW,"Van Helsing(released May/04)stars Hugh Jackman as Van Helsing and Kate Beckinsale as Anna Valerious. This production was sure a roller coaster ride,but not in the good sense. I found it quite uneven,with the two stars playing it right on,with other characters sabotaging their work,thus weakening the whole;down to poor writing. The CGI,as far as creatures go,was also terribly weak.
The story opens in Transylvania and Dr Frankenstein is bringing his Monster to life. The castle he works in is owned by Count Dracula and Dracula wants the doctors creation for his own uses. An argument ensues and the good doctor dies. The Monster takes the doctor to the top of a windmill,which is set on fire by the towns people. They end up crashing down through the structure when the floor beneath them gives way.
A year later we find Van Helsing in Paris tracking down Mr Hyde. He finds him in a bell tower,struggles with him and ends up killing him. He is summoned to the Vatican,who bankrolls Van Helsings exploits. They reprimand him for failing to bring Mr Hyde back alive. His next job will be bringing the Count down. Van Helsing,along with sidekick Friar Carl,travel to Romania to find the Count. They meet up with Anna,the last member of the Valerious family,who have fought the Count for generations. Just before his arrival Anna's brother had been bitten by a werewolf and was now being used by the Count to bring his vampiric children to life. However it doesn't succeed,so the count looks for the Monster to use.
Anna and Van Helsing find the Monster first and spirit him off to the Vatican. Along the way Annas brother attacks the carriage and Van Helsing gets bitten,but not before Van Helsing kills him. Anna is taken captive and Van Helsing must travel to his castle to rescue her. In the attempt,the Monster is captured and taken by the Count to a secret lair. Anna,Van Helsing and the Friar discover a secret portal that takes them directly to the lair. The Monster is rescued but the Counts children are brought successfully to life. Dracula,and a now turned Van Helsing,fight to the finish,with the Count biting the dust. Van Helsing turns on Anna and kills her,but not before she injects him with a serum the Count had to undo the werewolf curse. The Valerious family has now been cleansed and purified.
The problem with a movie,especially Sci Fi/fantasy films like this where the suspension of disbelief is paramount,if you don't grab your viewers attention and pull them into your world right off,or cannot get them back somewhere along the line,then you are in trouble. And if your plot is such that it doesn't seem to know what it wants to do exactly,then you are in even bigger trouble. Does this film want to be serious,or is it sending up the monster genre,or is it a light drama with serious overtones,or....?
The Count played by Richard Roxburgh,to me was almost played in a send-up kind of style. He seemed to be doing a poor impression of Bela Lugosi,not only speech wise,but his entire body language and look was slightly over the top and unconvincing;about as scary as a box of cereal. Then came the monster of Mr. Hyde. Van Helsing's first encounter is in a bell tower,and the huge Mr Hyde is hanging upside down looking at him. Again,giving off no menacing vibes whatsoever,and the CGI being too obvious and cheap. Then we have the character of Friar Carl. If I hadn't known what movie I was looking at,I would have sworn I was looking at a James Bond film,and this was ""Q"".Carl is the equivalent of that Ian Fleming character,showing Van Helsing around the workshop,chock full of hi-tech gadgetry. Carl also becomes a source of the film's lighter moments,with his naive and meek and mild manner. Trouble is,he didn't add to the story,just detracted from it. Then we come to Dracula's children. These things were like small gargoyles and again the CGI again detracted from their menace. Finally we have the Monster. At Dracula's castle,as he is being taken on the table up to the tower,he starts spouting bible passages. I have never seen a more erudite monster,than the one that appears in this film. It's weird and I found it so out of type as to be totally unbelievable.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include bloopers,commentary,two featurettes and a you are in the movie short.
All in all a totally disappointing outing for me. The writers had a virtual cornucopia of ideas here to work with,but in the end blew it. Some of the characters were played weakly and went against the film dynamic,the film itself not knowing exactly which way it wanted to go. And it had unconvincing creature CGI effects. Therefore,this picture had no where to go but down for this reviewer. The stars,Beckinsale and Jackman,both played it the way I thought the whole film would be played,but other characters sabotaged it. 2 1/2 stars. Not recommended.",1349049600,,4921,4.783783783783784

2101850,2,B0002KVUKW,"you'll have to give Stephen Sommers this much: he knows what he wants. even if what he wants doesn't quite mesh with what would best serve the story.
the regrettable part is that Van Helsing isn't quite the complete-&-utter misfire it's on it's way down in history as. Sommers wears on his sleeve an enthusiasm and appreciation for the classic Universal monster movies, and even here and there manages to effectively replicate their understated gothic feel. this film could've really been something if only he'd managed to confine himself to those parameters.
alas, Sommers found his niche in that subgenre effectively introduced by Independence Day, the special effects-laden, basically, big wad of special effects. (he did those Mummy movies with The Rock, for cryin' out loud!) so if you already knew the name Stephen Sommers it should hardly surprise you that the film frequently slams into a thoroughly inappropriate (not to mention LOUD) CGI overload.
even that we could perhaps look passed, if not for the Nth degree Sommers favors. he pushes it so far that they cease to suspend your disbelief and actually feel like visual effects. when his vampires set to bite, their hitherto normal sized mouths blossom to Steven Tyler proportions. when his lycanthropy victims change to or from werewolf, they do so by ripping off their skin. (this could be a suggestion that they're ""tearing themselves up inside,"" but how many people will be looking for Freudian symbolism in a film like this?)
to say nothing the wringer the title character is put through. the character made famous in elderly scholar form by the likes of Edward Van Sloan and Peter Cushing is now...a gung-ho Rambo-type warrior haunted by the past he can't remember. Hugh Jackman is basically playing Wolverine without the claws.
the change makes sense in light of the sort of film Sommers had in mind, but it's difficult to reconcile the two versions. i guess you could argue that, Bela Lugosi's Dracula film of 1931 being contemporary, whereas this one is set in the 1880s, he's have plenty of time to grow old, mellow out, and becomes a professor. another possibility occurs to me: the professor version is named Abraham, whereas this one is called Gabriel, so maybe this is in fact the story of the loose-cannon black-sheep of the family.
(there's been much speculation as to why Sommers changed the name, but i'm not sure he consciously did. being of one of the generations that would know these characters better for the movies than the books, i suspect Sommers didn't realize Van Helsing already had a first name.
then again, it could be a tip of the hat to the first Frankenstein film, which, for just as readily apparent reasons, changed Dr. Frankenstein's name from Victor to Henry.)
as i was saying, the film did have some potential. Richard Roxburgh, like any villain worth his salt, steals the show (when his mouth isn't swelling up) as the best Dracula in some time. (the last great portrayal of The Count before this was by Leslie Nielsen for Mel Brooks' underrated Dracula: Dead & Loving It.) and the gist of his villainous scheme - being undead his children are born dead, so he needs Dr. Frankenstein research to revive them - is logical if not altogether rational. so it was never gonna be a Casablanca, but it didn't necessarily have to be an Ishtar, either.
basically it's a piece of ""fan fiction."" there's nothing wrong with that per se, but in this case it's ultimately more about the fan than the fiction.",1346630400,,3496,4.8478260869565215

2101853,1,B0002KVUKW,"1. Abraham Van Helsing, PROFESSOR ABRAHAM Van Helsing was a German man living in Amsterdam and with a Dutch name, who lead the band of heroes in defeating Dracula in the original novel by Bram Stoker. He was a wise, older man, not an action hero, not an angel with amnesia. The fact that he was NOT a youthful action hero was kind of the point. In fact the character most like Hugh Jackman's Van Helsing (the Texan, Quincey Morris) was the one who DIED in the Dracula novel while PROFESSOR Van Helsing survived. It was his cunning and wisdom that defeated Dracula, not a rapid fire cross bow and Dresden Files-esque duster.

2. MAMMALS DO NOT LAY EGGS!!! WHY would female vampires, who used to be human, who take the form of bats (a MAMMAL) lay eggs!??

3. Why would God erase Gabriel's memory to punish him? How is it a punishment if you don't know you're being punished or why?

4. Why give Dracula the name Vladislaus Dracula (what the Historical Vlad The Impaler signed his name as on documents) yet turn him into a gypsy with a birth age and date of death that don't add up. (Seriously, it claims he's in his twenties when you do the math. Richard Roxburough is NO twenty year old), just so that he can incestuously go after a gypsy descendant?

5. Why did Van Helsing show pity toward the Frankenstein creature but not The Wolfman or Jekyll. The reasoning is the creature didn't choose to be what he is but Jekyll never intended to create Hyde and the werewolf never asked to be bitten. It. does. Not. make. Sense.

6. Why would the Vatican want to destroy an intelligent and apparently non-violent being?

7. I'm tired of the new cliche of action films (and anime) using The Vatican as some covert group of spies and assassins going after supernatural threats.

8. WHY would a werewolf bite kill Dracula? If you read the novel he LIKED wolves, he called them the children of the night and went out of his way to calm and pet the trapped wolves at the London zoo. He can take wolf form himself! He was in the form of a wolf or ""large dog"" when he got off the Demeter in Whitby. Has no one actually read the novel!??",1345161600,3,2121,4.3816793893129775

2101855,2,B0002KVUKW,"The central conceit of Van Helsing, that the Universal movie monsters of the 1930s were real and that Van Helsing was a supernatural being committed by a secret religious sect to defeat them, gave a nice spin to old material. Several of the actors, including Hugh Jackman and head vampire Richard Roxburgh, chew scenery with gusto. Kate Beckinsale, by contrast, seems to be trying to play her role straight, which doesn't work as well.

The special effects dominate almost every scene, and they're not great, even allowing for the fact that this film was released in 2004. I liked the werewolf transformation sequences, which are handled creatively, but most of the rest was sub-video-game quality.

There's an amusing scene near the beginning that spoofs James Bond receiving his weapons from Q. Otherwise, the humor is mostly limited to action-movie quips. Too bad, this movie could have been a lot funnier. The religious aspect of Van Helsing's origin seemed odd and out of place; they could have just skipped that.

I have read that people are working on a remake of this film, perhaps starring Tom Cruise. Surely a star of his magnitude can find better material?",1343606400,,1167,4.9438775510204085

It had enough chessy parts to make for a mindless entertainment value.  Just remeber to keep an open mind while watching certain movies, some might end up surpising you just like this movie did for me.  It was better then imagne it could have been.

2101860,5,B0002KVUKW,"It's VERY unusual for me to give a horror movie five stars. But then this is a very unusual movie.

Probably most of you know that Gabriel Van Helsing (Hugh Jackson) appears in the Dracula story as the one who knows most about vampires, and is dedicated to fighting them. This is the same character, in a way, but almost nothing else about this is the same.

This Van Helsing, a very attractive and capable young-looking man, is actually some 400 years old. He's also working for a secret order of priests who send him out to kill Dracula (Richard Roxburgh). Along the way, he encounters a variety of nasty creatures, including Frankenstein's monster, a werewolf, Jekyl/Hyde and three Brides of Dracula, who are of course also vampires. Then there is their numerous offspring . . .

Igor, originally Dr. Frankenstein's assistant, is working for Count Dracula by this time, since when Dracula loaned Dr. F an abandoned castle in which to reproduce his original work, the count was paying Igor's salary.

Two more characters are critical to the story. I can tell you very little about Prince Velcan Valericus without spoiling several surprises, but Princess Anna Valericus is a beautiful, strong, fearless young woman who becomes Van Helsing's ally -- or he becomes hers. The Valericus family has tried to kill Dracula for hundreds of years, so far without success, and with major losses. In fact, the family will be lost entirely if Prince Velcan and Princess Anna do not survive.

This is a major high action movie, with incredible special effects, that kept reminding me of the recent Zorro movies: there's a good bit of humor mixed in with all the blood and gore. And there is plenty of blood and gore, but somehow it didn't bother me so much as in most horror movies. I think it has something to do with the entire thing being in the realm of the supernatural, and therefore not nearly as frightening as psychotic murderers and the like that might be real.

Unless you really can't handle horror stories at all, I think you will appreciate this movie. Van Helsing is just the right sort of hero, and even wears a hat rather like Indiana Jones.",1336867200,2,2146,4.709333333333333

Frankenstein's Monster is kind of a good guy and Dracula, although every inch a bad guy, is fascinating.  Igor is a real jerk.  Dracula's brides are really quite something although I don't know why they are nippleless.  Maybe it's because their goblin babies are hatched dead already and need human blood rather than milch.  I never really figured it out.",1319241600,,617,4.951456310679611
2101877,4,B0002KVUKW,"My feelings about this movie are mixed. On the one hand, I think that the accents/acting were a bit too much. The vampire brides, while looking pretty cool, were as annoying to me as Star Wars' Jar Jar Binks. I liked the special effects & soundtrack, as well as the blending of classics in a homage to movie monsters (Frankenstein, Hyde, Dracula, Wolfman, etc). The plot was decent, the characters overblown, & Hugh Jackman makes a very convincing hero as always. Kate's character was a bit too over the top, though I do think she is normally a good actor...maybe it was just that her accent that was a little too thick & hollywood-ish.
For the girls out there, the eye candy was nice: Hugh Jackman, David Wenham, Richard Roxburgh & Will Kemp (VERY funny!) kept me entertained when the females did not. I liked the steampunk-esque costumes, the sets were amazing, and the special features on the DVD are cool - worth a look.",1316736000,2,924,4.606060606060606
2101878,2,B0002KVUKW,"Take every ridiculous Dracula-vampire-Transylvania stereotype you can find, spice it with some special effects and...voila, out comes ""Van Helsing"".

I think you need a special kind of humour to really appreciate vampire slayer Van Helsing's hunt for Count Dracula, Mr. Hyde and the odd werewolf. He turns out to be on a first name basis with Frankenstein's monster and a mysterious order of Catholic knights. And yes, ""Van Helsing"" suffers from an obvious LOTR-Excalibur complex.

I liked the cow, though.

2101880,4,B0002KVUKW,"After watching it many times I can say that Van Helsing is, to say the least, a mixed bag. The overall plot was pretty good in my mind, though the execution was weak. The effects were strange in that sometimes I was laughing at the cheesiness, and other times I was awestruck. I particularly enjoyed the werewolves in this movie as they had, in my opinion, a perfect balance of man and wolf. In general, the movie did a wonderful job of paying homage to traditional monster movies.

The offbeat style was what threw many people off, since it didn't really stay in one particular genre. It had a little bit of everything; suspense, comedy, action, romance, you name it. Throw in elements of steampunk for additional confusion (or in my case, elation). Another thing was the lack of gore. Just because it is a monster movie does not mean you have to have guts spilling everywhere and blood running in the streets. Yes people died, yes people got eaten, but it was done in a classy way. It was spooky, but something you could still watch with the whole family.

As picky as I am when it comes to films, I do have days when I just want to sit down and enjoy some mindless entertainment. Van Helsing delivers with lots of action, decent effects, great music and an interesting cast. I liked it a lot, even if nobody else did.

Instead of going ""there's no way that could happen,"" remember that it's a silly monster movie. Just shut up and enjoy the ride.",1305072000,4,1449,4.460377358490566

2101882,1,B0002KVUKW,"What are movies for? To entertain! To get you excited and touch on all kinds of emotions to make you laugh or even cry. Or even better, both at the same time... A movie should draw you in so you completely forget your surroundings. It's about getting connected with what's happening. This movie is not able to do any of this. It doesn't scratch the surface so to speak. A trigger happy Van Helsing, who displays action for the sake of action. Lots of special effects that don't serve any purpose (I mean well done guys, but were they meant to scare? heck no!) Not much of a good storyline here. Loose sand. And another thing. Mid winter in Transsylvania and the whole village is dressed up in layers of potatosacks to keep warm, and here we have the lead actress dressed up like a mariachi gal (where was the mariachi hat or guitar by the way?), a thin look through cotton Indian blouse, accentuating her boobs (okay check we needed a sexy lady), Hollywood hair extensions (pleazzz). She sticks out like a sore thumb in that environment. In one scene she gears herself up with so MANY weapons, and the effect of it is, that it only looks ridiculous. You could already imagine how she would get into trouble during a fight and all these weapons would get in the way....
It's not funny, it's not scary, It's all Soooo damn silly. waste of money to make it, waste of time to watch it.",1296345600,,1381,4.419607843137255

2101884,5,B0002KVUKW,"Another Stephen Sommers masterwork, and a movie that may prove ultimately more rewarding even than ""The Mummy"".  I am not surprised by the great spread of reviews here.  When watching this, one must be attentive to all the dialogue, noting nuances and background settings, etc., so as to understand the progression of the plot, which is grandly that of the struggle between good and evil.  Yet there is more.  Dense and complex, Van Helsing becomes better with repeated viewings, and dealing with such issues as love and commitment, honor, evil and curses, and eternal salvation, it certainly does have its fascinations!  Not a movie for the young though, and certainly not for all tastes; an adult fantasy mixing a number of themes with even humor and modern cinematography.  However, if one is interested in the supernatural, the unknown, the quest for triumph, possibly even the sublime, give this a try!

  Recently I have seen ""Van Helsing"" again, being broadcast on cable, and I picked up some ideas and concepts not appreciated the first time or two around.  But this is not at all to be unexpected, as upon the first viewing one may anticipate being thrown into some confusion.  I have also not mentioned there is excellent acting all throughout, led by Hugh Jackman as Van Helsing himself.  Time will, I believe, uphold this as one of the very finest adult fantasy movie experiences.",1294963200,2,1392,4.901709401709402

2101887,3,B0002KVUKW,"It's been a while since I've seen VAN HELSING, and I guess time does sometimes foster a different perspective. Seems that, over the years, my ill will towards this film has waned some, to the extent that I actually enjoyed watching this action horror film, just now, just now. And I've always thought this film was less soulless than, say, THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN, perhaps Sean Connery's most irredeemable flick. Anyway, this is a mixed message sort of review.

Some say he's a holy man. Others paint him a murderer. I guess even Bram Stoker got it wrong. What this Van Helsing is, is a legendary monster hunter, and he works covertly under the auspices of the Vatican. His latest mission dispatches him to the remote fastness of Romania, the Mecca for frightful supernatural beasties. There, Van Helsing will hunt his most formidable quarry: Count Dracula. He also meets lovely Anna Valerious, the last in line of a damned family that had sworn to kill Dracula and barred from Heaven until that deed is done. Cue the spectacular action and CG. Cue the dreary plot. And if you can justify the cohabitation of the cool action with the plodding story, then good on you. I have lowered the bar, I've learned to adjust, and I do like the film better now. I still can't say the same for Connery's folly.

On one hand, if you've enjoyed those old-school Universal horror flicks featuring Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, and the Werewolf, one draw may be that this movie strives at an homage to them. Each of these terrifying monsters plays a role. On that same hand, if you like your Kate Beckinsale, well, she's here and sporting a funky Romanian accent. On the other hand, the nerve-deadening storyline puts a damper on things; it trudges along. And dear, winsome Kate - while she does her best - could only do so much with her underwritten role. She and Hugh Jackman exhibit the rapport of two dandruff flakes languishing on a poor sap's shoulder.

I mentioned that the action is spectacular, and it is. But even the action in THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN was pretty cool. VAN HELSING is so determined to jump from one CG-driven action spectacle to another that it abandons good storytelling in its wake. VAN HELSING is flash and style with not much substance, pulse-pounding stunts with no refinement. And, yeah, I know, sometimes it doesn't matter that the script is weak because the f/x and the fighty fights are just that good. But, man, when the script is this weak and ponderous? And, I guess, it comes down, too, to the acting performances... and I'm eyeing Hugh Jackman now. This guy has shown natural charm and wit before (his awesome opening number at the Oscars is just one example). But, as Van Helsing, Jackman is so relentlessly dour and wooden, we don't get a chance to glimpse his true personality. So, to boil it down, this flick is Van Helsing pretty much tangling with the usual rolodex of feature creatures, and there's also a half-formed romance with Beckinsale. If you like your fighty fights, this'll do ya.

On the plus side, I thought that Van Helsing's assistant, Carl, was a fun character. Carl is pretty much the sole fount of humor here.

There are some pretty robust special features on this DVD: 2 feature commentaries; ""Explore Dracula's Castle"" takes you on a 360 degree tour of several of VAN HELSING's sets; ""The Legend of Van Helsing"" is a rundown of the character as portrayed in films; ""Bringing the Monsters to Life"" focuses on the Industrial Light & Magic folks, as they, thru pencil sketches and digital composition, reveal how the monsters were crafted; ""You Are In the Movie"" grants the viewer the actor's perspective, thanks to strategically placed miniature cameras; ""Play the Van Helsing Game"" - the DVD pops into your Xbox and allows you to play the game's first level; the movie trailers; and 5 and a half minutes of goofy outtakes (""I give you...Van Halen!"").",1290211200,,3929,4.772058823529412

There are very few adaptations of Dracula that I like. This was one of them. It's an o.k. adaptation. The best thing about the movie was it's visual monsters and effects. Here are the things that made the movie what it is:The story was crap,the casting and script need alote more work,and I was expecting it to be a dark and relentless movie ,but it turned out to be a very light movie that talks about Jesus Chris all through it.

The movie does have EVERYTHING, Dracula, werewolves, the Frankenstein monster, Mr. Hyde, Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsale, Van Helsing and an odd friar for comic relief. But since it has everything there is little room for a good story, only short plot drivers to connect endless action scenes built around computer generated graphics.

2101897,5,B0002KVUKW,"I love Dracula, Vampires, Werewolves, & Frankenstein movies.  But all of them in one movie is a BINGO winning formula and Van Helsing could have been the best horror movie ever; unfortunately it is more oriented to the action than to the Horror.  Still Van Helsing delivers entertaining for all fans of the classic monsters.  Kate Beckinsale & Hugh Jackman, are cool in their roles.  Personally, I've never liked the ""Van Helsing"" character in any movie, but this movie makes it for me more likeable.  I prefer the ""Van Helsing"" roll presented in ""Dracula 2000"" he fights and dies.  Maybe Bram Stoker's version is the best personification of the character, but I do not watch vampire movies to see Van Helsing killing them, as I said I prefer the vampires to kill Van Helsing like in ""Dracula 2000"".
Said that, I focused on the other characters, and I found the Werewolf and Dracula's Brides to be my favorite ones in this movie.  The Werewolf was suffered and believable.  But the Brides, they were astonishingly beautiful and horrific at the same time, excellent visual effects.  I wish they make a movie of the Brides only, with lots of gore and terror, something that Van Helsing lacked since is family oriented.  What I liked the most is the cinematography and the visual effects of the Wolf and Brides, they were superb as well as the soundtrack.
Maybe someone in the near future decides to make a new Van Helsing version for adult audience with intelligent and intense gore and horror.
All and all Van Helsing is visually very enjoyable; I recommend it for all classic monsters fans.",1272931200,,1590,4.749090909090909

The film was cast perfectly,with most all of the actors demonstrating great chemistry and keeping their characters believable and well out of ""cheese"" territory. The sets and action sequences within them are wonderful and highly reminiscent of the old-school style of filmaking. There are many famous old-school villains such as: (The Wolfman/Frankenstein/Mr. hyde/Dracula/ect.) The film's CGI and Special Effects are some of the best in the industry and add significantly to the story. The plot of the film is very well written and does an excellent job of balancing such a large variety of classic characters and effectively connecting them to each other. Add on a length of slightly more than 2 hours and a pulse-pounding musical score and you've got a truly epic film. Bonus features include: (several documentaries/bloopers/movie trailers for Van Helsing and Shrek 2/an xbox compatible demo of the Van Helsing Videogame/commentaries/ect.)

Since then he has become a hunter of abnormal and supernatural beings.  He does this on behalf of the ""Knights of the Holy Order"", a secret organisation run by the Vatican.

After ""dealing"" with Mr Hyde he returns to Rome and is told that his next mission will be to go to Transylvania to assist the Valerious family in conquering Count Vladislaus Dracula (Richard Roxburgh -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-League-of-Extraordinary-Gentlemen-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JM5B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (Widescreen Edition)</a>).

The start of the film recreates the old black and white Frankenstein movies.

This tongue in cheek tribute to the classic horror films from the 1930's and 1940's is a thrilling ride with an amazing sequence of visuals. There are many outstanding scenes, such as Dracula's lair with the frozen ice sickles hanging from the ceiling and furniture, to the marvelously dark scenes of the Dracula castle high up in the craggy mountain ranges, to the splendor of the Fellini like ballroom scene inside a Cathedral with its motley group of guests. Perhaps we could have done without the initial battle between Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) and the grotesquely huge, cigar smoking, Mr. Hyde, but once we get beyond this point the film is charmingly engaging as we move from one visual spectacle into the next as Van Helsing and Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale), and the friar, Carl(David Wenham), battle the likes of Dracula, the Werewolf, and the Frankenstein monster.

2101936,1,B0002KVUKW,"Crock o'poo and a snoozefest to boot.

Van Helsing is aimed squarely at socially awkward 14 year-old-boys stupider than the esthetics of the trench coat mafia crowd. I should have suspected something when the ""two disc collector's edition"" was on sale in the four-dollar cut-out bin.

The good things: the visuals and the dramatic camera angles and sweeps make this a visually interesting film, but sadly no better than its comic book origins. Hugh Jackman gives a credible performance distinct enough from Wolverine to safely cash his check in good conscience.

Just awful: Kate Beckinsale is hobbled by the wardrobe director, who forces her to wear an outfit that makes you think she is in a topless teddy (she isn't, there is a scrim of cloth that is *exactly*the*same*color*as*her*skin*tone* and the only difference is some tiny red thread embroidery. The obvious attempt at inspiring allegiance from the audience sub-set of breast fetishists got annoying after a while, and sadly director Stephen Sommers plays it up, as nearly every action shot of Beckinsale leaves the somnolent viewer wondering ""did her knockers just fall out?"" Ooopss, no, it is just that silly outfit again.""

This is a real kitchen sink of a character mix. Let's throw in every monster we can shall we? Werewolves, brides of Frankenstein's monster, Frankenstein's monster, a grotesque and scared Igor, brides of Dracula, flying goblin progeny of Dracula and....DRACULA HIMSELF!!!!

Most. Boring. Dracula. Ever.

Yep, he beats out ""Dracula in Pakistan.""

Really, in college I lit f-rts that were scarier than this guy. The blue flame. The pain. The terror. The promise never to do it again.

Nahhh, actually nothing happened and we just drank more. And this guy is less scary than that.

Even the brides of Dracula aren't that sexy, sporting pancake make-up so thick I was wondering where the maple syrup and side of bacon was.

Van Helsing shoulders a miniature Tommy gun crossbow that shoots silver stakes. He shoots these from cylindrical magazines that hold hundreds of rounds. When actors hold the silver stakes they look like oversized tent pegs half a meter long. Van Helsing whips this weapon around with the ease of a water pistol. Given that silver weighs 11 grams per cubic centimeter, each stake weighs seven kilograms and Van Helsing could obviously rip a bank vault in two, yet puny flying bats also knock him over. Must be some off-screen Superman-Kryptonite kind of thing.

Plot consists of Van Helsing shooting things with occasional interruptions as a supporting character stumbles upon a (document, wall, mosaic, old book, scroll, secret formula, new potion) that helps him shoot things better. The things when hit melt into jelly-skeletons and scream as they re-enter Hell. Putting your ear next to a band saw and slicing a finger off gives you the approximate sonic effect.

What is amazing is how jaw-droppingly expensive the practical sets are and how detailed the CGI is. This was a very expensive film and I'll bet it will never make back its money.

Here is my review of the Bonus Disc: I was sooooooo bored with the original movie I could not be bothered to look at it and instead used it as scarecrow flasher to keep birds out of my cherry tree. It worked great!",1237939200,2,3267,4.961538461538462

2101942,5,B0002KVUKW,"Writer & director Stephen Sommers reinvents the nemesis of ""Dracula"" in ""Van Helsing"" starring Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale. Sommers brings the same larger-than-life swashbuckling bravado to ""Van Helsing"" that he brought to his macabre but campy reboot of ""The Mummy"" (1932) in the blockbuster Brendan Fraser flicks ""The Mummy"" (1999) and ""The Mummy Returns"" (2001). Even more outrageously preposterous but thoroughly entertaining than Sommers' adrenalin-driven ""Mummy"" remakes, ""Van Helsing"" alters more than Dracula's archenemy. Sommers performs makeovers on the Frankenstein monster and Dracula's brides, too. Now, the Frankenstein monster fights for the good guys, while the airborne vampire brides swoop down like harpies on their victims and haul them away in their talons. Even Dracula himself undergoes changes. Stakes through the heart, garlic, crucifixes, holy water and sunlight have no effect. However, nothing is as radical as the transformation of Van Helsing. In the original 1931 ""Dracula,"" Professor Abraham Van Helsing was a much older man with close-cropped hair and thick glasses who practiced medicine. In other words, 60-year old vampire slayer Edward Van Sloan looked nothing like buffed up ""X-Men"" star Hugh Jackman. Neither does Jackman resemble the venerable Peter Cushing, who portrayed Van Helsing as an older but more energetic professor type during the 1950s-60s in five Hammer ""Dracula"" movies. An unkempt Anthony Hopkins hammed up the role in ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" (1992). The closest anybody has come to Hugh Jackson's Gabriel Van Helsing is Christopher Plummer in ""Dracula 2000."" Nonetheless, even Plummer played Van Helsing as an older man armed with a deadly cross-bow. Not only does Jackman arm himself with a gas-operated, semi-automatic cross-bow, but also he totes two six-guns and a hand-held, kung-fu flying guillotine. For martial arts illiterates, a hand-held, kung-fu flying guillotine looks like a Frisbee with jagged metal edges. Young, virile, and fast on the draw, Jackman's Van Helsing dresses like an Italian western gunslinger with a black, floor-length coat and a broad-brimmed hat. His uncanny resemblance to Clint Eastwood enhances that impression.

""Van Helsing"" hits you with back-to-back prologues that identify the chief characters. An enraged Transylvanian mob storms Dracula's castle in the late 1880s. Evidently, Dracula (Richard Roxburgh of ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"") has given Dr. Victor Frankenstein (Samuel West of ""Notting Hill"") refuge in his castle, so the scientist can complete his experiments with reanimating dead tissue. Of course, Dracula isn't generous for nothing. He has a stake in giving life to the dead offspring of him and his brides. Thousands of icky-looking embryos that dangle lifelessly from the ceiling like wasp nests clutter up Dracula's castle. Meanwhile, the Vatican dispatches Van Helsing as their troubleshooter to destroy monsters. In his opening prologue, Van Helsing appears in Paris with the Eiffel Tower under construction and battles the only non-Universal Studios monster, the Mr. Hyde (Robbie Coltrane's voice), half of Dr. Jekyll. Afterward, our stalwart hero rides back on horse to the Vatican for new orders. Director John Carpenter first linked the Vatican with destroying vampires in his own movie ""Vampires"" (1998) with James Woods as a cross-bow wielding vampire killer. Although he wears old west duds, Van Helsing acts more like James Bond. At the Vatican, the equivalent of 007's Q in the guise of Friar Carl (scene-stealing David Wenham, Faramir in ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy) devises a variety of gadgets for Van Helsing. Cardinal Jinette (Alun Armstrong of ""Patriot Games"") dispatches Van Helsing to save the last two members of a vampire slaying clan. They are gypsy princess Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale of ""Pearl Harbor"") and her brother Veklan (Will Kemp of ""Mindhunters"")who gets bitten by a werewolf early on in the action. Unfortunately, Veklan falls under Dracula's power and becomes his werewolf slave. Initially, neither Van Helsing nor Anna likes each other, but they join forces reluctantly to put Dracula on ice. In the middle of all this mayhem, we find the Frankenstein monster (Shuler Hensley of ""Someone Like You"") serving as the key to Dracula's efforts to give his dead offspring life.

Sommers pulls out all stops in this slam-bang, high-octane, over-the-top, roller-coaster of an adventure that has vampires and werewolves battling each other. Twists follow turns in the contrived but imaginative plot, and surprises alternate with shocks. Although he has revamped those classic horror characters, Sommers' ""Van Helsing"" consists more of atmospheric, computer-generated locales and harrowing jolts that occur when monsters appear suddenly behind characters for maximum shock effect. No, anybody over age 12 shouldn't suffer nightmares from this formulaic action epic, because ""Van Helsing"" is basically a horror comedy. Imagine a monster mash cross-between of ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" and ""The Fearless Vampire Killers, or Pardon Me But Your Teeth Are In My Neck"" (1967), and you'll know what to expect of ""Van Helsing."" Nothing about ""Van Helsing"" is remotely credible, but the breathlessly paced story throws so many curves that you cannot predict what is going to happen from one set-piece to the next. When Hugh Jackman isn't performing testosterone-fueled stunts, Kate Beckinsale indulges in her own estrogen-based acrobatics that make her werewolf slayer in ""Underworld"" seem tame by comparison. Neither character has enough time to romance the other, because they find themselves constantly jumping through metaphorical flaming hoops in an unceasing battle with evil. If ""Van Helsing"" has a flaw, it is casting Richard Roxburgh as Dracula. He looks like Dudley Moore and he lacks menace. You have to wonder why Universal couldn't have attracted a bigger star to off-set the combined star power of Beckinsale and Jackman. Ultimately, while ""Van Helsing"" is never boring, the changes in these legendary horror characters probably won't bother younger audiences as much as older ones weaned on inflexible rules governing the behavior of vampires and werewolves. You'll get your money's worth out of ""Van Helsing.""",1228608000,6,6296,5.523316062176166

2101947,3,B0002KVUKW,"I'll give director Stephen Sommers one thing - he's got style. His previous blockbuster hit The Mummy Returns was almost too much style and too little content, but Van Helsing - a rollercoaster of a tribute to the old-fashioned horror/monster flicks of the past century - manages to finely balance this. But then again, you're not gonna watch this movie for plot. You're gonna watch it 'cause it has lots of monsters and fights, and that it presents those with style. And it does.

To get the plot out of the way, nonetheless, mysterious monster-mercenary Van Helsing is under 'employ' by a secret Vatican order to keep humanity safe from monsters. (Sommers seems to subtly poke fun at the Vatican, though, with a scene showing an Arab man being tortured for no apparent reason.) Dispatched to Transylvania to counter the threat of Count Dracula, Van Helsing meets up with a beautiful princess (Kate Beckinsale), the last in a run of family almost completely wiped out by Dracula, and the two reluctantly join forces. Yet how to stop Dracula, when all traditional methods have failed? That's for you to find out - and of course we have vampire brides (whom I personally find way more frightening than Dracula himself), the Frankenstein monster and wolfmen (3 in all) to spice things up a little.

I scarcely need to say that Van Helsing's biggest quality is that it's absolutely BEAUTIFUL. The setting is almost deliberately greyish - comfortably set in early winter - as to subtly homage the black-&-white roots of the movie's substance. In particular the werewolves are its biggest visual triumph - nowhere else have I seen as aesthetically-pleasing werewolves. With a slight spoiler warning, my favourite scene in the movie is the final werewolf fight. In particular where the werewolf almost elongates his claws before our very eyes and scratches the wall to enlighten his menace is a truly stunning cinematic moment.

Stephen Sommers's talent at going over-the-top is all to the benefit of this movie, a rollercoaster of a movie, a thrilling modern homage to monster movies. It's got a believable plot. It's got nonstop action from start to finish. It's got an awesome, well-executed werewolf fight. What more could you want? Take it.

Indiana Jones, James Bond, Blade, everything in this movie was stolen from a better movie.",1224720000,,408,4.513513513513513

But its basically made well enough to qualify as light comedy/action/horror entertainment. However, there is an intense 5 minute scene that comes close to being great and that I re-watched 5 times because it was a really well done action scene. Its the part early in the movie where Helsing arrives into the village is attacked by 3 vampires flying down at him while he fires back with his machine gun cross bow - Great Fun!!!

Of coarse the show was about video games and how awesome they are and cool it is to spend all your time buying and playing them. If your inclined to agree with this nerd's opinion what is there left to say? Thing is, this thing here, VAN HELSING, is the best possible argument for video games being better entertainment than movies you could ever come up with. This is one of the most horrible, absurd pieces of junk I've ever come across. The whole thing is like a stupid video game. But you don't get to play.

2101952,3,B0002KVUKW,"The Good Things
*Loads of slick special effects.
*Good cameramanship.
*Good production quality (good sets, costumes, designs, etc).
*Despite all the stereotypes and bad accents, the acting is passable.
*Storyline works and leaves much room for lots of upbeat adventure.
*There is a good number of nifty gadgets.
*Music is not bad.

The Bad Things
*The main monster characters are not very well developed, and conform more to their given stereotypes. Dracula acts much like he did when Bella Lugosi played him. Frankenstein is a total drama queen. Wolfman is somewhat cool, but still shallow.
*The human characters are also not very well developed, and have incredibly hoaky accents.
*Van Helsing himself is a shallow Indiana Jones type character, and has very little to do with the original character from Bram Stoker's novel ""Dracula.""
*Everything is extremely cheesy.

The concept is corny in itself; a combination of the top three movie monsters (Dracula, Frankenstein, and the Wolfman) in one big brawling adventure. As a story, it's mildly interesting. The characters are very lacking, showing nothing beneath their cliched surfaces. This film doesn't do any justice to the actors or the characters. The best thing is simply the action and special effects. It's simply better to turn your brain off, sit back, and enjoy the eye-candy. Probably best viewed during Holloween.

The one-disc version has a few featurettes, a feature that allows you to explore the set, and some outtakes.  The two-disc set includes all of the same plus a few more featurettes (and for anybody who cares, some movie money for the next ""Mummy"" film).",1216339200,4,1632,5.1471698113207545

This was an excellent, frightening, fast-paced movie. The special effects were fantastic.

The extras were well-appreciated: a tour of Dracula's castle, the Legend of Van Helsing, Bringing the Monsters to life.

I'm an amateur graphic artist, so I appreciate such insights into how such effects were created.

I'd recommend this movie to anyone with similar tastes to mine.",1214697600,2,481,5.128205128205129
2101954,3,B0002KVUKW,"I really wanted to like ""Van Helsing,"" especially after reading various interviews with the director who acknowledged that he was inspired by his love for the Universal horror classics. Unfortunately, he comes closer to recreating the mediocrity of 1944's ""House of Frankenstein"" than one of the studio's superior horror classics from the 1930's.

There is a lot to like about ""Van Helsing."" The sets are impressive and the special effects can not be faulted. There are plenty of impressive action sequences that can make you gasp. In the end, though, it proves the old adage that ""less is more.""

The movie is positively stuffed from end to end with breathtaking stunts and special effects, leaving little time for character development or story. That's unfortunate because there are, indeed, several novel twists worth exploring, such as Dracula's financial support of Dr. Frankenstein's experiments. But this is simply mentioned then quickly discarded in favor of stunts and effects that grow monotonous because they are so plentiful. There's never time to catch your breath. For some viewers, these complaints may sound more like recommendations. Rest assured, if it's action you want, this movie delivers . . . and delivers, and delivers.

Hugh Jackman is okay, but his Van Helsing is closer in spirit to Indiana Jones and James Bond than the character created by Bram Stoker and played to perfection in other movies by such actors as Edward Van Sloan, Peter Cushing, Laurence Olivier and Anthony Hopkins. As Dracula, however, Richard Roxburgh seems too intent on channeling Bela Lugosi and too often brings to mind Al Lewis, Grandpa on ""The Munsters,"" instead.

Frankenstein's monster and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde also put in appearances, but nothing really progresses beyond the surface level. Too bad. The premise is great. The effects are superb. The action is well-staged. The story, however, falls short.

When this first came out, I was very impressed, but even then I thought that some of the CGI was over the top.  If you suspend disbelief (and / or have a margarita), the movie is very visually appealing.

Kate Beckinsale, alone, gives the movie a high rating, IMHO.  There are some aspects of the film which are hokey, silly, or overdone, but overall I liked the movie enough to watch it a few times.

I love action movies, horror movies, and have a soft spot in my heart for all of Universal's monsters, as well as just about any movie ever done of Dracula.  Yes, Peter Cushing is pitch perfect as Van Helsing, and Anthony Hopkins makes him an educated and entertaining psycho, but Hugh Jackman turns him into a dashing and lethal killing machine.  Oddly enough they all work.  The cast is great.  Hugh Jackman, David Wenham, and Kate Beckinsale do a terrific job as the heroes. Richard Roxburgh delivers a Dracula that is charming, dangerous, and ridiculously self-absorbed, and Shuler Hensley comes very close to Mary Shelley's misunderstood monster.  The pacing in this movie is on fast forward all the time, but is pretty much flawless.  Everything is explained, even with several things happening at once and it all converges at the right moment.

The atmosphere was suitably spooky (especially the stagecoach ride through the forests at night), and the sets and costume design were gorgeous.  I have to give credit to Stephen Sommers too for managing to include all the monsters in a story that actually worked.  It has been tried before, but usually the story seems contrived or the characterization just doesn't work.  Not only did he manage a good story, but he created an interesting universe with the church employing its own hitmen and scientists to take care of supernatural evil when it pops up.

And yes, being female, two hours of Hugh Jackman and David Wenham are an absolute pleasure, and Richard Roxburgh is no slouch either.  The female characters were fun to watch too - Anna Valerious was a take-no-prisoners tough girl, and the brides were catty drama queens with some fabulous lines.",1204761600,2,1802,4.884868421052632

I found this movie interesting because of the visual images (and the character of Van Helsing is interesting, too).  Yes, there is plenty of silliness (women in distress with perfect hair, etc. etc. etc.), but I still found much to enjoy.

NOT for those who take their movies seriously, or who want an artistic film with terrific writing.  Also not for the person who likes super-scary, super-gorey movies (this one is still too scary for kids)-- this movie can't decide if it is a comedy of a monster movie.

2101965,4,B0002KVUKW,"When you want to make one more film on Dracula who counts several hundred films already, both as assets and as drawbacks, you have to be original. No problem ! Let's patchwork together dozens of allusions to other films and create the first ever vampiristic salad. So Dr Frankenstein and his creature will be there.

The use of the lightning to get electricity like in Back to the Future 1. The use of strange weapons halfway between Back to the Future 3 and The Lord of the Rings. The costume, dress, apparel of Van Helsing looks like Clint Eastwood's in a spaghetti western, and at times like the main hero's in the Matrix trilogy. The cows in the village are similar to those in Salem's Lot 2.

Even the dance scene with the vampire reflected in a half empty mirror is borrowed from Dance of the Vampires. I would need a volume to quote them all. So what's left after all that composing of tidbits? A superhero Van Helsing who kills Dracula's three fiances, the thousands of baby vampires that look like upside down Aliens in their suspended pods, and Dracula himself. And all that on the order from the Vatican, the Pope and the good old godly Catholic church.

That's a counter-allusion to the Da Vinci Code. The film then is more dictated in its plot by the brand new topnotch state of the art digitalized image processing of the modern world than the reverse. So the plot is a vast ballet between mountains and from abysses to cosmic skies.

It is thus an amusing entertainment as shallow as the Thames River twenty kilometers before its spring. Or is it the Mississippi river?

2101969,4,B0002KVUKW,"Van Helsing is a cool movie.  The detractors here seem to have one thing in common: they all like the old Dracula and Frankenstein movies from back in the 1930s.  Perhaps they prefer that the horrible natures of these two things be taken a bit more seriously.

This movie is just fine the way that it is.  There are many good special effects and the story is actually quite good.  Anyone taking the show too seriously aren't really paying attention, though.  It was clear to me from the opening scene with Mr. Hyde that Van Helsing was not going to be a serious movie.  That was fine with me.  I wouldn't mind if Hollywood tried to create a new and horrible Dracula story (they might surprise themselves if it is really good).  But, as fantasy goes this was a well done show.

The James Bond comparison seems valid but I'd like to point out that there is nothing wrong with the James Bond formula.  Why can't that work for a mild fantasy show?  It is cliche, but these days cliche is hard to escape.  Movies have gone over just about every theme and story line possible.  There's not much new ground to cover.

What makes Van Helsing so cool, though, is that the varied story elements are combined into a unique idea that presents the audience with a mild but credible story.  Dracula is determined to take over the world and only Van Helsing, under precise conditions, will be able to stop him.  There is only one way to kill Dracula.  Will Mr. Van Helsing be able to do so and yet return to himself?

This is a clever show but try not to take it too seriously and you will have some fun watching it.",1196121600,3,1601,4.347972972972973

2101982,1,B0002KVUKW,"Absolutely ghastly. So bad - if I were a werewolf - I'd be hacking hairballs for days on end. I wanted to like this movie - I really did - because I think Hugh Jackman is a wonderful actor - but even Jackman - talented as he is - can't save this mess. It looks like the director was writing the script as he went - throwing ever black and white monster movie, and Hammer House of Horror flick, at the wall just to see what would stick. Thus you have a convoluted plot involving Dracula, Werewolves and even Dr. Frankenstein's monster.

Some movies take a while to get going - I knew this one was going to stink up the joint within the first ten minutes - and I'm probably being generous there. This movie never gets going. There are idiotic plot lines involving Dracula getting it on with his undead brides - is anybody gagging yet. The undead brides look like a trio of jiggle queens - B rated porn stars who look like they are ready for a slumber party - and none of them can act - and really - Dracula and his brides making babies? So what, even undead women have biological clocks ticking away now? If I was Dracula's bride - I can think of much more entertaining ways to spend my immortality - than being pregnant with his undead kid.

So we see Van Helstink channeling Indiana Jones, swinging from ropes and crashing through windows. This movie is unintentionally funny - and even then not in a good way. Then he gets bit by a werewolf and we get to watch him morph- and even this was a collosal disappointment. Instead of employing make up, special effects, etc. and actually creating a realistic werewolf - they just used computers and puked up a CGI fight between an animated werewolf and an animated flying, dracula batlike - whatever. By the time the big smackdown between VanHelstink and Dracula was ready to begin I had completely zoned out of this movie.

The only reason I even stuck around for the end was because I had already wasted the money - thank god it was at least matinee prices or else I would have really been disgusted. So the only thrill I got - all two seconds of it - was watching Hugh Jackman rip his shirt off and I like shirtless Hugh. Save your money - do not rent this, do not buy it. And the guy who wrote the script probably deserves a silver bullet AND a stake through the heart to make sure they never produce anything this bad again.",1181174400,,2374,4.306487695749441

First of all, if you are not a Vampire, Dracula, Wolfman, or Frankenstein fan then you should not be revewing this DVD. This is without any doubt, the best of these type of movies and in HD even better. In HD details of this movie are nothing short of fansastic, my favorite scenes are Dracula's castle, Dracula's ballroom, Vampires attacking in the courtyard, Kate Beckinsale in the courtyard and ballroom dance with Dracula, Frankenstein's design, Werewolfs detail and much more. The Snow scenes and backround scenes are so detailed. Hugh Jackman's fight against Dr Jeckle, Mr Hide is a classic. How can anyone knock the fun of this movie, I don't know.

One of the few movies I've wondered when it would mercifully end, and I'm a Hugh Jackman fan.

2101997,3,B0002KVUKW,"Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale. Were it not for these two gifted performers, this movie would be beyond silly. As it is, the plot is almost pretextual for the special effects.

The Eye Candy factor is high, though. Hugh Jackman as the tortured hero, filmed in the dark all of the time, makes us weak in the knees. Kate Beckinsale does magnificent physical feats while squeezed into a corset.

The story: Van Helsing (Jackman) is essentially a bounty hunter of supernatural monsters, a job he took on at the request of the church as apparent penitence for sins he cannot even remember. As a reward for his centuries of service, he hopes to make his way to Heaven instead of Hell.

Anna (Kate Beckinsale) is the last survivor of a family of Transylvanian vampire hunters. Her brother has become a werewolf and she is conflicted about whether he should live or die.

Naturally Anna and Van Helsing team up to rid Transylvania of the evil vampire overlord. Van Helsing has a tool kit Batman would envy, and Anna maintains an arsenal of monster-killing weapons that would make a survivalist proud. Between the two of them, the monsters don't stand a chance.

Put your mind on hold, suspend disbelief and intolerance for the occasional leap of reason, enjoy a slightly randy friar (Van Helsing's sidekick), and go along for the ride. Van Helsing is a great Sunday afternoon video.",1165104000,3,1376,4.764705882352941

Making Van Helsing a renowned monster hunter backed by the Church and a team of brilliant gadget makers is corny.  If you want to get to know Van Helsing, read Bram Stoker's Dracula.

Van Helsing has beautiful women and great special effects.  The action is attention-grabbing at times. But neither are enough to make this a good film.

2102000,2,B0002KVUKW,"Stephen Sommers can make a darn good movie.  He proved it with 1999's ""The Mummy,"" which was a refreshingly light yet thrilling update of the old Mummy movie-monster.  ""The Mummy"" balanced outstanding special effects with some sparkling chemistry between the two leads, Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz, and employed the perfect comic timing of sidekick John Hannah and the definitely creepy presence of villain Arnold Vosloo.  Not a great flick, by any means, but a darn good one.

""Van Helsing"" is an attempt to regenerate exactly the same combination, just with a different script.  But instead of updating one classic movie monster, ""Van Helsing"" takes Dracula, the Wolfman, Frankenstein's monster, Dr. Jekyll, and even the influence of the ""Alien"" movies and throws them into the PG-13 blender.  But where ""The Mummy"" emerged from the creative oven as satisfying (and as nutritious) as a perfectly decadent Philly cheesesteak sandwich, ""Ven Helsing"" comes out like a stale Big Mac - overly processed lard without much flavor.

It's a dratted surprise, too.  Hugh Jackman is an excellent actor, even in ridiculous movies, but here he is largely wasted in a non-sensical plot as the titular monster-hunter Van Helsing.  His back story, which is hinted at, is never explained . . . even during one of the script's many exposition-only speeches.  Kate Beckinsale is largely in the movie to look ravishing and bring in the audience from her vampire-wolfman ""Underworld"" movies.  As in most PG-13 movies, both Jackman and Beckinsale can be punched in the face hard enough to launch them clear across rooms, yet only emerge with an attractive trickle of blood on the cheek - sturdy stuff, these Hollywood stars!

Perhaps that's the main problem with ""Van Helsing"" as opposed to ""The Mummy"" - it cheats on the violence.  Whereas in ""The Mummy,"" the villain was updated with lots of magical powers that were thrilling and gruesome without being overly gory.  Dracula and the Wolfman, however, are in the ugly business of tearing out throats and rending limb from limb.  It's hard to do that correctly on-screen and still keep your PG-13 rating, which is essential for major box office.  So as a result, the villains in ""Van Helsing"" really come off as lightweights.  The less said about Richard Roxbrough's non-scary spin as Dracula - who comes off as snotty Euro-trash more than Evil Incarnate - the better.

In addition to some pretty impressive special effects showing the brutal mountainscape of Transylvania, the movie's only other real charm is David Wenham's turn as Carl, the Vatican's gadget-guru and nebbishy sidekick to Van Helsing.  After seeing Wenham for the first time as the noble Faramir in Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" movies, it was hilarious to see him play the nerd with such brio.  His performance kept the movie's tongue planted firmly in its cheek, and he saves the movie to the extent it can be saved.

Do not watch ""Van Helsing"" if you are looking for anything resembling thrills and chills or if you are putting together a retrospective of any of the participants' work, other than the artistic folks and Wenham.",1157932800,5,3141,4.990403071017274

2102002,3,B0002KVUKW,"Van Helsing is a pretty good flick. You've got plenty of action, some nice suspenseful parts, and a valient attempt to squish in the entire Universal Studios monster squad, but... The plot wasn't perfect, I'll admit that. I would have liked to see a little more romance between our protagonist and his supposed love interest. Also, much more character development on both the sides of good and evil. I mean, Dracula was alright... but he kind of came off as your typical, maniacal, Saturday morning cartoonish villain. He seemed like he'd taken evil lessons from Casanova Frankenstein from ""Mystery Men"". Too much mad, not enough mastermind.

And the ending. I don't want to spoil it but basically, If you hate when all the werewolves in a flick either get killed off or turn back human at the end, this film will disappoint you. This is definitely not a good werewolf flick, seeing as how the werewolf concept and two thirds of the werewolves themselves are severely underdeveloped. Really, it seems they were stuck in as an afterthought and suffered from the overcrowding of characters in the film. Too many characters to decently develop in a two hour time frame. But, if you just need a movie to kill a few hours, rent it or borrow it from a friend who has it...it's not really worth the thirteen or so bucks to own it.

Kind of a cross between James Bond, Constantine, and Raiders of the Lost Ark, set in the 19th Century.

Whereas Bond serves for Her Majesty, the Queen of England, Van Helsing gets his license to kill, and his peculiar armaments, from the Vatican.  After eliminating Mr. Hyde at Notre-Dame de Paris, Van Helsing is sent to Transylvania to terminate Count Dracula, who is trying to use Dr. Frankenstein's science to bring his thousands of still-born vampire children to life.

Hugh Jackman makes a better Wolverine or even Leopold, and, as one reviewer noted, ""Kate Beckinsale's Transylvanian accent made me expect her to start saying 'One, one vampire! Two! Two vampires. Ah-ha-haa.'""",1145318400,3,617,5.029411764705882
2102015,4,B0002KVUKW,"yes this movie proves that you don't need a cross or holy water to kill a vampire, just a writer/director who doesn't know what he wants to make,an action movie,a horror movie,a western,a bond movie,or a comedy so he makes them all and what he got was this ""monster"" of a mess that he calls van helsing.

  hugh jackman ""stars"" as the famous vampire and monster killer,but the real star is the cgi effects and they over power the movie like a vampire drinks blood. you loose all feeling for the people in the movie because so much of the action is a special effect,and not all the cgi's are that great which really hurts this film.

  ok,by now you must wonder if i feel that way about the movie why 4 stars ,well i'm not sure myself but i found myself i a very goofy mood the second time i saw it and had fun picking out the bad f/x's and the bad acting. so if you are in the mood for a goofy time watching a bad movie and laughing this might be the mess you have waited for.",1145232000,2,976,4.0837696335078535

2102023,2,B0002KVUKW,"When movies are described as a ""roller coaster ride"", or just a ""non-stop thrill ride"", I already suspect that this is just another movie that will give me a headache.

When is Hollywood going to figure it out that making movies with too many special effects, and very little comprehensive drama, ends up being a very disatisfying experience for the viewer?!  Many unnecessary special effects were thrown in just so someone who enjoys creating special effects can ""show off"" his particular animation talent.

When compared to an actual roller coaster, yes, the results can seem to be the same.  Usually a ""thrilling roller coaster ride"" is only about an honest minute and a half.  You don't want to be on a roller coaster for two hours.  That's what this overkill ""roller coaster ride"" of a movie does to people like me.  If you're like me, you'll definitely be bored to tears before the ""ride"" is over.

If this movie was written word-for-word as a book, the contents of the story would be very bleak.  Van Helsing, written here, is a pretty bland story.  A loud, ""in your face"" display of absolutely nothing interesting!  The movie ""Twister"" was the same way.  All visual, but no real story.

""Your reputation precedes you...""  Nobody in real life talks like that, but Hollywood seems to think that's a cool line.  I hear it in movies alot.  In fact, this film has alot of cliches' of films of the past which continues to prove it's lack of originality.

And, what's more, they couldn't have picked a more boring, uninteresting actor to play ""Dracula"".  What is he, a ""she-male"" or something?  Realistically, Dracula should have been more handsome and charismatic, the way Bram Stoker (the writer and creator of the original ""Dracula"" written in 1897) perceived him to be.  This Richard Roxburgh as Dracula definitely contributed more to the non-appeal of this film.

Come on, honestly, is this the limit of comprehensive imagination?  Does ""character development"" make you feel like you're having to learn more about a character that you really want to?  The absence of ""character development"" makes it so that you don't care what happens to anyone in the film.  ""Kill him off!"", ""Kill her off, too!""  Who cares?  We didn't get a chance to know the character anyway.

I was really hoping to enjoy this film because I love ""gothic artwork"".  The still scenes in this film really were very beautiful.  But, it wasn't enough to save this ""lame"" film.",1139529600,4,2450,4.808153477218226

What a team these two make in this film. The special efects are a sight to see. The plot line has been posted numurous times,so I won't repeat it. If you haven't seen this great film check it out, its a dandy, the three female vampires flying around in a full frontal attack on the village early in the film is worth the price of the DVD alone. The movie is 135 minutes long, but every minute is of it is great. With all the junk that hollywood pumped out last year, this ones a rarity indeed.",1138579200,5,778,4.372413793103449
2102027,4,B0002KVUKW,"Ok, when I saw this movie in theaters, it blew me away.  I loved the special effects, and the storyline was much better than many action/horror movies today.  I think Hugh Jackman was a good choice to play Van Helsing, but his character did not portray the originality of Van Helsing in Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"".  They also changed his name for some reason.  It was supposed to be ""Abraham"" but Sommers changed it to ""Gabriel."" Van Helsing should have also been portrayed as more of a scientist than a gunfighter, which was how Van Helsing was originated.

In this movie, Van Helsing's main nemesis is Dracula, but along the way he fights Mr. Hyde, Frankenstein, and some werewolves.  His job is to kill Dracula before he lets lose all of his kids to take over the world. Of course, Helsing is armed with way-ahead-of-his-time weapons which are funded by a secret Vatican society.  That is the tree trunk of the storyline, but of course there are many more branches of obstacles throughout the movie.

As in all movies, some of the fight scenes are very unrealistic.  Such as when ""whats her name"" is thrown against the wall at full speed and she gets up just fine.  Just little glitches here and there, but nothing to ruin a pretty good movie.

Overall, it's a good movie, but check out Sommer's ""The Mummy"" which is his best movie.  ENJOY!

2102029,1,B0002KVUKW,"Gabriel Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) is a monster hunter/mercenary who is sent to the village of Transylvania.  With the aid of his assistant Carl (David Wenham) and the Transylvanian princess Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale), Van Helsing battles the Frankenstein Monster (Shuler Hensley), The Wolf Man (Will Kemp), and the most powerful of them all, Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh)

The most PATHETIC movie I have seen in a while.  I'd take a Uwe Boll movie over this, and I am NOT a Uwe Boll fan.  It's horrid.  I enjoyed Stephen Sommer's THE MUMMY, but even that was lacking in substance.  This movie has no substance what to speak of.  Sommer's direction is fine, but the real fault is the script.  It was a terrible idea of make Van Helsing a younger James Bond-type character, when in truth he is an elderly professor with a strong moral authority.  On the acting side, Hugh Jackman broods throughout the whole film, Kate Beckinsale just kind of stands around, and David Wenham provides some good laughs here and there.  As the monsters, Richard Roxburgh is easily the WORST Dracula I've ever seen, Shuler Hensley's Frankenstein Monster is a shadow of the true thing, and Will Kemp's Wolf Man lacks any real emotional depth or substance.  Even the special effects are weak.  Still, the movie is entertaining, at the least.  I would suggest passing this movie altogether, and just going for Lugosi/Karloff/Chaney, Jr. movies from the 30's and 40's.

2102030,3,B0002KVUKW,"Well, not really.  But at least the main idea, the main plot, was more realistic than Dracula just trying to take over the world, or England, for no reason.  Here, Dracula, played by the wonderful Richard Roxburgh, just wants to give his children LIFE.  That gave him a emotional touch, a shadow, a relic, from his human side that many other vampire characters in other movies have lost.

Also, I enjoyed many of the scenes, I liked how they really brought out the beauty of Kate Beckinsale as well as the Brides -what nice outfits!  Thou I feel sorry for them - they had to wear almost nothing in very cold enviroments.

Why only three stars?  Well, first off it was hard for me to see the character of Abraham Van Helsing as a homdsome, butt kicking, action hero.  A, as somebody else pointed out, James Bond for the Church.

I liked the Mummy movies but I did't know much about the legends or myths behind the Mummy movies.  I DO happen to know a lot about vampire myth and fiction.  In other words, the very people who might wish to watch this movie, vampire lovers, might be the very ones who will spend the whole time shaking their heads and wondering what the heck they're watching.

It was a good story. I'm fine with that. But what's with these monsters and the special effects? How is this like a vampire, Frankenstein or a werewolf?

Most of the flaws I feel the movie has are in character development and to much information that is presented and never solved, and because it is a movie and not a TV series this can become problematic.  Some aspects of the special effects were nice.  The main problem area with the speical effects is in the final fight scene where it just looks to fake.

Yet, all in all I enjoyed this movie and am glad that is a part of my DVD library.  I would say that it is a worth while buy, especially if you can get it used.

2102036,1,B0002KVUKW,"Back in the 1940s, Universal Pictures combined their classic horror creations for all-star monster rallies like HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN, HOUSE OF DRACULA, FRANKENSTEIN MEETS THE WOLF MAN, and ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN. The decision-makers at Universal decided to update this formula in VAN HELSING, which turns the legendary vampire hunter into a buff James Bond/Indiana Jones figure and pits him against Dracula and his brides, the Wolf Man, the Frankenstein Monster, and even Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. All this brings a new dimension to the term overkill.

Writer-director Stephen Sommers is responsible for THE MUMMY (1999) and THE MUMMY RETURNS (2001); both films, particularly the latter, sacrificed any trace of characterization and plot development for the sake of gaudy special effects. VAN HELSING ups the ante considerably with a nonstop parade of migraine-inducing visuals and a chalk-scraping-on-blackboard soundtrack. This is certainly the noisiest monster movie ever made, if not the noisiest film ever made, with enough action scenes for a dozen films. It's like sitting through one l-o-n-g theatrical trailer.

The early sequences provide the best moments; the opening scene set in Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory (presented in black & white) effectively establishes the film as a revisionist take on the classic monster themes. A little while later, Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) arrives in Transylvania just as Count Dracula's three vampire brides attack the village; it's a thrilling, exciting, and beautifully paced set-piece. It doesn't take long, however, for exhaustion to set in. The film, like its title character, takes no prisoners, as one shrill action scene is piled upon another at a furious rate: Windows are smashed, walls crumble, bridges collapse, carriages explode, gunshots reverberate, lab equipment crackles, blood splatters, everyone swings from an assortment of conveniently placed ropes and cords, and all victims die screaming. (Imagine being locked in a room with a group of hyperactive children and you'll get some idea of what to expect.)

The real shame is that lurking somewhere in the midst of all the yelling and carnage is the makings of a reasonably entertaining horror picture. Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsale (as a female vampire hunter), and Richard Roxburgh (Count Dracula) are good leads, although there's precious few opportunities for them to really act. The standard monster clichs are cleverly incorporated into the story line, but without any quieter moments, the film lacks the sense of dread that's integral to any successful horror tale. Most of the fun comes from anticipating a shock scene, allowing your imagination to run wild; unfortunately, VAN HELSING offers nothing but shock scenes, utilizing slick computerized images to spell everything out for you.

A younger generation of film fans now find the Universal monster movies from the '30s and '40s too slow and tame to sit through. If that's the case, VAN HELSING may be perfect entertainment for them. As for me, I'll take slow and tame any day. At least my hearing won't be impaired.",1132272000,11,3110,5.366803278688525

Terrible acting, AWFUL computer animation, and a shockingly pathetic plot made this movie a BIG let-down. I guess the plot is the main downfall of the movie-Dracula (who was very poorly cast in my opinion.) and his brides need some sort of energy lifeforce from powerful beings to bring there gargoyle-looking mutant babies to life. Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale have to save the day. As if the plot wasn't bad enough, the film makers had to create some of the WORST computer animation EVER to grace the big screen. The animation makes it look like cartoon characters rule the movie.  NOTHING looks even remotely real and almost every NON-COMPUTER GENERATED scene is so obviously a movie set that it is hard to endure the countless scenes of lame character dialouge and predictable action sequences.

2102038,5,B0002KVUKW,"The year is 1887, and the villagers are storming Frankenstein castle with torches and pitchforks in a scene that lets you know exactly what sort of movie you're watching. ""Van Helsing"" is a popcorn movie, pure and simple, inspired particularly by the classic horror films of Universal Studios, with a Hammer Studios style (especially ""Captain Kronos - Vampire Hunter""), and a little James Bond and ""Vampire Hunter D"" thrown in. The villagers in question are Transylvanians, their anger ignited by the evil experiment taking place in the castle at the hands of Dr. Frankenstein himself, and under the watchful eye of his evil benefactor, Count Vladislaus Dracula. For reasons yet unknown to the viewer, Count Dracula has been sponsoring Dr. Frankenstein's efforts to harness the life-giving power of electricity in the form of a monster constructed from the bodies of 7 dead men. However, once the experiment is a success, the two-faced count lets his true nature show. Frankenstein's reluctance to allow his creation to be used for evil forces Dracula to put the bite on him (ouch, sorry). This disturbs the now living Frankenstein creature, who knocks Dracula into the fireplace with a piece of laboratory equipment and storms out of the castle with his father in his arms.

Van Helsing Rule Number One: Fire doesn't work on Dracula.

The villagers pursue the Frankenstein monster to an old windmill (classic), and, as he looms over them from the top screaming a very operatic ""Whyyyyyy???!!!,"" the windmill is set ablaze. Just then, the crowd is frightened away by four horrific figures emerging from the clouds. They proceed to land before the burning mill and weep at the loss of their dream. They are Dracula and his three brides. Very cool black and white opening, though campy at times and thoroughly hammy. Richard Roxburgh's Dracula takes some getting used to, but with repeat viewings he can really grow on you. Two of Dracula's three brides, Josie Maran and Elena Anaya, can suck me dry anytime. Silvia Colloca is a bit too mature and downright scary for my tastes.

Fast forward one year, to a world that is still dark, but now in color, where we witness a wanted man named Abraham Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) trailing another man known by two names: Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. The setting is Paris, nighttime, and the trail leads to the belfry of the Notre Dame cathedral. Here, we learn the nature of Van Helsing's work. He is a monster hunter, and he brings `em back dead or a live, which often results in him being mistaken for a murderer. In the big fight scene that follows between Van Helsing and the hulking Mr. Hyde, we learn that Abraham is an easy-going character, much more likeable than the usual tough guy hero personas. He's also a religious man, though he has issues (including a loss of memory reminiscent of another famous Hugh Jackman hero), and most importantly, he's the best at what he does. Clad in a dark leather coat and wide-brimmed hat, armed with spinning tojo blades and a sharp wit, Van Helsing makes short work of Mr. Hyde, Dr. Jekyll, and the cathedral's famous Rose Window.

Avoiding capture by the French police, Van Helsing makes his way to his home-base of sorts, the Vatican City, Rome. Through a secret door in a confessional booth, after some chastising and grumbling back and forth with Cardinal Jinette (guilt and remorse take their toll on Abraham), Van Helsing takes us into the secret lair of a holy order made up of all the religions of the world on a mission to eradicate the monsters that plague our planet. At this point, Cardinal Jinette explains Van Helsing's newest mission to him, simultaneously divulging the details of the plot to us, the audience. It seems that the last two members of a line of Transylvanian nobles, Gypsy Princess Anna Valerious and her brother, Velkan, are in dire need of help to destroy Count Vladislaus Dracula. The fate of the souls of their entire bloodline rests on accomplishing this task, and now they are down to two.  Then, in a sequence right out of a 007 film, a quirky young friar named Carl (David Wenham) introduces Van Helsing to his new ""ahead of their time"" array of gadgets and weaponry. Before the scene is over, Van Helsing has wrangled Carl into the mission as well.

Cut to Transylvania, where the aforementioned gypsy prince and princess are about to spring an elaborate trap to catch a werewolf. A CGI werewolf, but possibly the second coolest looking werewolf ever depicted on film(the first being in this movie also)! Naturally, despite some very cool action and werewolf footage, things don't go as planned. The werewolf does get nailed with a silver bullet, but not before taking Velkan over a cliff with him and down to the icy waters below. Her heart sinking, the lovely Princess Anna looks on and prays for help. Luckily, Van Helsing is on his way, sidekick Carl in tow. Their arrival is not a welcome one, however. The Transylvanian villagers, the same ones we saw storming a castle one year earlier, are wary of strangers. They prepare to kill Abraham and Carl on the spot, with Princess Anna giving the orders, but are interrupted by the vampire brides on a mission to kill the final Valerious. In the process, we finally get a good look at how hot the brides are. Unfortunately, the price is the loss of Josie Maran far too soon in the movie (and with one of the worst CGI effects I've seen in a while). Killing Josie, or Marishka, as she is called in the film, earns V.H. some respect, though he is still not accepted with open arms. It is expected now, that the vampires will be more violent than ever.

The two remaining brides return home to Dracula's secret castle, where we are reintroduced to the count, in color this time. He mourns the loss of his bride for about two seconds, walks around on the ceiling, does some ranting, gently reprimands the hideous Igor(played by the always fun and creepy Kevin J. O'Connor) who is torturing a werewolf behind a curtain, and then we're back to Anna and Van Helsing. In Anna's castle, Van Helsing and the princess toss their tactics at each other while flaunting sexual tension. Unfortunately, they don't come to an agreement, resulting in Van Helsing spraying Anna with some wicked cool knockout Binaca in the hopes that she'll have no choice but to use his plan of waiting till morning to hunt. I guess it wares off too soon though, because Anna wakes up and gets to work. Van Helsing catches up with her just in time to chase off her brother, the new werewolf, before he could do any harm during a failed attempt at warning her of Dracula's plans. Van Helsing goes after the beast, but instead has a brief run in with Top Hat, the creepiest guy in town. While Abraham attempts to kill Velkan the werewolf, Anna catches up with him, and the two have it out about people shooting at her brother... After some bonding, the monster hunters soon find themselves heading in the direction of Frankenstein castle to help Velkan and put an end to the Count. While snooping around within the castle walls, they uncover Dracula's secret plan. He has been trying to use Frankenstein's machine to bring his children to life; hundreds of hideous, gargoyle-like babies, born dead and hanging from the ceiling of the castle in slimy pods! Using mortal humans as power conductors has been fruitless, so Dracula begins to experiment on Anna's werewolf brother, Velkan. The creatures are suddenly brought to life, and Dracula sends them out to feed with his brides teaching them. As Van Helsing goes after Dracula and Anna goes after her brother, the little Dracula babies swoop down and attack the village below. Van Helsing attempts to stake Dracula, but instead of celebrating, the two heroes find themselves fleeing Frankenstein castle, outnumbered by vampires, werewolf Velkan, and the creepy Dwergi, Dracula's goblin-like henchmen.

Van Helsing Rule Number Two: Silver stakes don't work on Dracula.

Van Helsing Rule Number Three: Crosses don't work on Dracula, but they do burn.

Well, after that fun little adventure, Van Helsing and Anna stop for some wooing over a bottle of absinthe, both having learned something from their recent experience. Van Helsing has learned a bit more about his mysterious past, Anna has learned that the best thing for her brother is a quick death, and all the vampire babies exploded from an insufficient electricity supply, so no major characters are worse off for the visit. In fact, Carl even gets a little action from a villager girl whose life he saved! Typical friar... Anyway, while reflecting on the events of the previous night, Carl makes a significant discovery in the Valerious home. The young friar accidentally finds a hidden clue: a magical painting depicting two knights in battle, one transforming into a werewolf, the other into a bat-creature. Simultaneously, Anna and Van Helsing make a discovery of their own. While discussing the mystery of how to kill dracula and swigging back green liquor in the ruins of the old, burned down windmill, Anna and Van fell through a weak spot and landed in the middle of the Frankenstein monster's secret hangout! Yes, that guy is still alive! Now that morning has come and the two have regained consciousness, they find themselves face to face with the man-made man. He is in no mood for polite conversation, so Van Helsing knocks him out with a blow dart. V.H. seems to love knocking people out. Before the creature passes out, however, he manages to reveal to them the secret of his existence. He is the key to life for Dracula's children, and there are thousands more waiting to be given life in Dracula's own hidden castle. Suddenly, Van Helsing's mission is not only to destroy Dracula, but to hide and protect Frankenstein's monster from the vampire's evil clutches, or else the whole world will suffer under the frenzy of Dracula's thousands of hungry offspring!

As I said in the beginning, Van Helsing is a ""popcorn flick."" Much like ""The Mummy Returns,"" ""Van Helsing"" is a thrill-ride of a movie. It's a special effects laden action-adventure based on the icons of Universal Studios horror. The point of a film like Van Helsing is to have a good time while watching it, and on those grounds, it's a huge success. Now, I'm not one to praise computer animated characters in live-action films. I confess, a great many of my favorite recent films rely heavily on computer generated characters, but I would almost always prefer audio-animatronics and other real-life effects over CGI, especially with werewolves and other horror related subjects. Why? Well, because I very rarely encounter CGI effects that aren't obvious, and how can you get a chill from something you KNOW isn't there? CGI effects are best when used simply to enhance real elements, and it's always better when the real outweighs the CGI. ""Van Helsing"" is different though. Yes, there are computer effects in this film that bother me, the death of Marishka, the mouths of the vampires (I prefer the old-fashioned kind), etc...., but these were a few points in a movie heavily laden with CGI. In a film with so many computer effects, it almost becomes more like watching a painting, making the CGI characters seem much less out of place than they appear in a film like ""An American Werewolf In Paris."" With Van Helsing, so much of the backgrounds and effects are CGI that the pure CGI characters seem to blend in so much better than something that is merely pasted over a world completely real in every other aspect. Thanks to Stephen Sommers' obsession with ""Sommersizing"" every aspect of his films, the CGI creatures are far less distracting and far more believable. And, one has to admit, you just can't get great werewolf moves like that with costumes or animatronics. These things are fast and fierce, and the coolest looking werewolves I've ever seen. Their transformations usually involved ripping the human flesh off their bodies, which was actually cooler than I ever thought it would be (probably because it wasn't done in a gory way). And, though I don't love this new breed of werewolves that climb walls and columns like a panther or something, at least that was kept to a minimum here.

Effects issues aside (since you either can take CGI characters or you can't), this film is top notch for what it aims to be. The cast is perfect. Who doesn't love Hugh Jackman? I've already raved about my two favorite vampire ladies, and Shuler Hensley was such a noble monster (I'd love to see his performance as Jud in ""Oklahoma"" sometime). Everyone in the cast was a perfect compliment to Hugh Jackman. I've never been big on Kate Beckinsale, but this is one of those films where you can't help but be charmed. And, oh, the music! Alan Silvestri is just awesome! Definitely, a movie for the collection. Not high art, but a perfect choice for a carefree evening of fun and adventure! I sincerely hope a sequel has not been ruled out!

Van Helsing is available on a great DVD (fullscreen and widescreen versions, be careful which you buy) with two commentaries (no, neither feature Hugh or Kate), a tour of Dracula's castle, outtakes, other behind the scenes treats, and a nice little look into the character of Van Helsing, the rival of Dracula since the two personalities were first cooked up by Bram Stoker in the 19th century. You can also buy Van Helsing on VHS, or get an Ultimate Edition DVD that includes the original Universal classics ""Dracula,"" ""Frankenstein,"" and ""The Wolf Man,"" along with a couple of extra bonus features. There's even an animated DVD prequel to Van Helsing out entitled: ""Van Helsing - The London Assignment."" I believe it deals with the story of Van Helsing going after Mr. Hyde. I definitely need to pick that one up someday!",1130889600,5,13783,4.795875420875421
2102039,2,B0002KVUKW,"I don't know why people vilified this movie so much.  Probably because of the cheap CGI (like in ""Mummy Returns"").  The story is stupid, the action sequences over the top, and all is irrelevant, but is fun nevertheless, and every action (even the stupidly impossible ones) is sliced in understandable bits of information (that is more that you can say about so many Hollywood films these days).  Is a grandiose ""B"" movie (or rather a ""direct to video"" film) with a budget closer to ""Titanic"" than to ""Re-Animator"".  But I will continue viewing Sommers' films, if he manages to slow down and acquire a better technique using the overblown effects that he likes.  In the summer of 2004, two of my hopes for the pop-corn film (Sommers and Twohy) had failed (or at least that's what the public, the critics and the B.O. dictaminated).

2102040,2,B0002KVUKW,"I remember watching the ads from for this film and thinking, ""What a piece of crap.""

Despite this, and starved of an intake of cinematic vampires, I decided to go along on my birthday last year and hope for some redemptive value to it.

Funnily enough, my initial instinct proved correct. In fact, the film actually managed to be *worse* than what I expected from it.

Its opening sequence alone warns you off pretty quickly - we are ""treated"" to one of the - surprisingly worst - portrayals of Dracula I have ever seen. Very odd that it was delivered by the normally rather capable Richard Roxburgh. His moments of fury just make you want to laugh.

We also have an Incredible Hulk-like Mr. Hyde, culled from the interpretation featured in ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen."" The character is rather ludacris - helped by the fact that he also smokes...giant cigars.

Frankenstein's monster is no better: he has a sort of glow-in-the-dark fishbowl in his skull in which his brain resides, barely covered by his scalp...which unfortunately tends to slip off once in a while.

The plot is a monster mash that nearly exhausts Universal's canon of monsters, and wastes any potential they might have had for carrying the story.

Still, the sappy part of me did feel *something* for the tragic, ""Ghost"" inspired ending.

Not much else to recommend on it, though.",1128470400,2,1362,4.815450643776824
2102041,1,B0002KVUKW,"Sadly, this movie proved to be an enormous disappointment.

I honestly cannot recall the last time acting on the big screen was so poor. Dracula and his wives made me want to run from the theater in horror, and I don't mean that as a compliment. He was not believable in the least. His wives were even worse. Fidgeting like you're wearing clothes that you are allergic to does not become a bride of Dracula. I'm also sorry to say that Kate Beckinsale's acting was not up to par with her usual performances either. After watching her in other films, this came as a nasty surprise. Hugh Jackman was passable, but not nearly as captivating as he was in the X-Men movies. David Wenham was the only reason I was able to sit through the entire movie. His comical performance was great. But, unfortunately, it was not enough to save the film.

The effects were lacking as well. We are in the times when one can find people to produce decent effects, not ones that look like they were created in the Dark Ages. Some were painful to look at. I've seen better ones in small screen TV shows.

The storyline was also weak. It jumped all over the place without leaving you somewhere long enough to care. It doesn't draw the audience in to hold their attention. One could be more worried about the fact that they ran out of popcorn than wondering how the heroes are going to stop the birth of the baby vampires.

This movie proved to be a huge letdown. I would not recommend it to anyone. It has no substance and even lacks good, cheep thrills. Pass it up in favor of something else.",1128038400,,1569,4.4
2102042,4,B0002KVUKW,"I have to confess - I am a newbie to the genre of Dracula and Frankenstein. Too young to have watched the black-and white originals, and too prone to nightmares to watch the serious modern remakes. However, this is what made Van Helsing excellent entertainment for me; It was never my intention to proclaim snootily at the end, "" It was alright, but not as good as the first one."" I watched it without over-scrutininzing it, and appreciated its wild thrills and comic undertones.

The bones of the[...]are pretty formulaic. You have your dark, brooding hero of mysterious origins, luscious heroine with come-hither kick-ass abilities, and the insane comic sidekick who nearly threatens to steal the show. Dracula is (surprise!) hatching a nefarious plot and only Van Helsing can stop him. Yawn.

This where the madcap action sets in. There is rarely a moment in which something is not going bang or crash, and the CGI is set amid stunning visual direction. All the adrenaline action is in severe danger of going over the top (as it did in League of Extraordinary Gentlemen) but it is salvaged by two things. Firstly, the aforementioned visual splendour of destruction, enhanced by the riotous premise of the whole movie. Secondly, the acting is good enough to prevent the characters from becoming mere dummies thrown around by explosions.

Hugh Jackson is typical Indiana Jones. Enough said. Beckinsale has a very seductive accent and is generally passable. Count Dracula is a marvellous, tongue-in-cheek ham, who earns instant dislike. The cream of the crop is David Wenham (Faramir from LOTR), as a foul-mouthed, womanizing priest-mad scientist in an impossibly British accent. His dry wit, interspersed by cringing and whimpering, ala a fish out of water, are perfect comic uplifters when the story starts to sag.

""Van Helsing"" will not win any awards, it probably won't have any sequels due to it's small box-office success and it will probably be forgotten in a few years, yet all  of that doesn't matter the fact that I found this movie very entertaining just like last year's underrated ""LXG"" (although LXG is much better) and I recommend it for all of you who like good action movies.

First things first - the effects. Yes, they're good, but Sommers (he of The Mummy and Mummy returns infamy) seems to think that you don't actually NEED plot or, like, characters - you just need LOADS and LOADS and LOADS of effects, thrown at the screen every single minute. When you start to tut and roll your eyes when yet ANOTHER monster comes at the screen, or another transformation or whatever, you know something is wrong.

And then there's Hugh Jackman himself, basically being Wolverine but with less attitude. In truth, he's about as wooden as the stakes he carries, and about as interesting.

Add to that a TERRIBLE ""comedy"" tag-along partner, the worst Dracula in movie history, some of the stupidest action sequences known to man and a veering on self-parody ending and you really do have something that should be put to eternal rest.

However, I can tell you that this movie does NOT hold the same impressiveness on successive viewings. It, in fact, looks like a crazy quilt of CGI work, furious jump-cutting, and a constant aesthetic that is WAY too grim after seeing it only the second time! There should be some respite from all the ghoul-chasing so that a good contrast can be set, instead of a steady diet of lab-OR-atories, gothic architecture. lightning bolts and bloodletting. This worked with ""Ghostbusters"" and ""Aliens"", it should have been used here.

That said, it does have some redeeming aspects, not the least of which is the wizard art direction, which must have driven the miniature people bazoomies! The intricate castles, furniture, room embellishments, and various devices that Van Helsing uses put you in mind of a high-budget version of the ""The Wild Wild West"" meets ""Indiana Jones"" meets ""The Name of the Rose"" meets ""Ghostbusters"". The writing, too, warrants some kudos....Jackman himself speaks a litany of James Bondian wisecracks all through the movie, but it is Roxburgh who gets the really good lines, along with David Wenham, playing Van Helsing's friar sidekick.

I think I'm beginning to notice a pattern, though, in Hugh Jackman's movies....In X-Men 2, Deathstrike, a Japanese mutant that has a duel with Wolverine, played by Jackman, meets a GRUESOME death at the hands of the feral X-Man, having molten lead forced through her body by a berserker Jackman. In THIS movie, the Kate Beckinsale character, Van Helsing's potential love interest through the whole movie, dies....AT VAN HELSING'S HAND!! Granted, he was a werewolf at the time, but STILL...!!

""Van Helsing"" is a campy, tongue-in-cheek homage to the three key figures of classic movie horror - Dracula, Frankenstein's monster and the Wolf Man - and those who do them battle.  Hugh Jackman is the mysterious Van Helsing, a centuries-old monster-slayer who works sub rosa for the Catholic Church in its ongoing battle with the forces of evil.  In this tale, Van Helsing is sent off to Transylvania to destroy the famed Count Dracula, a vampire who's been rampaging through the countryside for more than four hundred years now, making life miserable for the inhabitants therein.

Written and directed by Stephen Sommers, ""Van Helsing"" is a sometimes entertaining, sometimes half-baked adventure tale, beautiful to look at but largely devoid of any real suspense or excitement.  The action scenes are overwrought and redundant, filled with computer-generated special effects that are surprisingly second-rate in nature.  However, the art direction and set design do an outstanding job creating a Transylvania that plays upon our memories of those Universal classics from the 1930's.  Moreover, David Wenham serves as an effective cowardly/comic Sancho Panza-type sidekick for the more staid and conventionally heroic Van Helsing, who suffers pangs of remorse when he is forced to destroy the monsters.

The final battle scene between Van Helsing and Dracula does drag on for a minor eternity, but the movie, overall, should satisfy rabid fans of the action film genre.  The rest of us can find intermittent entertainment gawking at the scene.",1121990400,,1551,5.323770491803279

2102053,4,B0002KVUKW,"When I first watched ""Van Helsing"" my initial reaction was that it wasn't that great, it was just average.  Upon thinking about it, and rewatching the film, I have changed my opinion to some extent.  While still not the best movie ever, but for a monster movie it does a very nice job.  Plus the idea of bringing together iconic film monsters, such as; Dracula, the Wolfman, Frankenstein, and even Mr. Hyde making a cameo, was a unique idea and one that director Stephen Sommers pulled off magnificently.

""Van Helsing"" follows the adventures of a vampire hunter named Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman), who first appeared in Bram Stoker's classic novel Dracula.  Now Van Helsing hunts more than merely vampires, as he takes on various monsters for a secret organization within the Catholic Church that seeks to rid the world of evil in all it's forms.  Through his journey he comes across the lovely Anna (Kate Beckinsale), a kindred spirit for Van Helsing, and together they must stop Dracula and his minions from destroying anymore lives than they already have.

The concept of bringing together so many of Hollywood's classic movie monsters in one movie seemed like an idea that would never see fruition.  As cool as the idea was there just didn't seem to be a director, let alone a special effects house that would be able to do justice to so many epic characters.  That is, until director Stephen Sommers resurrected the classic monster, the mummy, for his big budget films ""The Mummy"" and ""The Mummy Returns"".  The films did so well that they even spawned a spin-off that served as a prequel of sorts to the franchise, called ""The Scorpion King"".  With a director that was adept at reinvigorating classic monsters, Universal Studios saw the chance to bring more of their classic monsters to life, thus ""Van Helsing"" was born.

With the enormous success of `The Mummy' franchise and now with ""Van Helsing"", director Stephen Sommers is proving himself to be Hollywood's go-to-guy for monster movies.  With good acting and a good storyline that blends so many of Hollywood's classic monsters together without rushing any of them, this really is an enjoyable monster flick.  Now that the origin is essentially out of the way for this updated version of Stoker's classic vampire hunter, it will be interesting to see where this franchise will go in future installments.  Since, ""Van Helsing"" was successful, it is conceivable that Universal Studios would move forward with a sequel, so here's hoping for another great adventure in ""Van Helsing 2"".

Somehow they made it work in Van Helsing, turning a creepy genre into an adrenaline-paced Transylvanian romp.  This film is fun, fast, and fictional.

Don't watch Van Helsing expecting great acting or tremendous subtlety.  Like the modern Mummy movie, it's more fun and adventure, with a touch of evil.  Hugh Jackman, in the title role, plays an enigmatic Van Helsing with memory loss.  He works for a secret anti-evil Vatican order.  Of course, for modern PC sake, the order has some token Muslims and Buddhists tossed in, but the Cardinals run the show and give the hero the best technology the late 1800's can provide.

Kate Beckinsdale is a delightfully curvy, assertive heroine, and the supporting roles are well-done, especially a particularly wormy Igor, very reminiscent of the wormy Bennie in The Mummy remake.

Let's start with the plot:

First, Van Helsing is no longer the lovable old guy who is constantly on the trail of Count Dracula. Here we have Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman, X-Men) as a kind of dark arch-angel who works for a secret society in the Catholic Church who's charge is to protect society from abominations (i.e., Mr. Hyde, Ogres, etc.), thus helping Christianity and goodness flourish across the planet.

About 15 minutes into the film, we finally see Van Helsing being assigned to the Dracula legend in Transylvania. He has to save a young woman (Kate Beckinsale) from the dastardly clutches of the blood sucking fiend. If he doesn't, doom will encompass the countryside.

Here's how the rest of the film goes: Having long dialogue with vampires before battling them ...and winning. Having long dialogue with vampires before battling them ...and losing. Having long dialogue with vampires before battling them ...and winning.

The plot --- if there is one --- is basically to kill Count Dracula. But there are so many other things going on (the struggle of Frankenstein to ""exist"" --- which I thought was the best side story of the entire film ---, the development of baby-vampires --- don't ask ---, and a slew of other terrible ideas) that I felt completely and utterly wasted as a movie viewer.

Other problems:

Umm, this is supposed to be about saving people from Dracula and saving Christianity, right? So what was with the burning funeral pyre at the end of the movie (isn't that a Pagan thing?)

The film starts off in black-and-white in the late 1800's, giving the viewer the understanding that the action during this time took place long ago. And then we jump ahead an entire ...YEAR! and switch to color. Wow. That was lame.

I can't begin to tell you how horrible this film was. There's more horrors to be told, but I have to head to the bathroom. I feel ...oh no! ...GHACKKK!",1120780800,,2077,4.668493150684932

2102062,4,B0002KVUKW,"Sadly, many, many critics (and others) just didn't ""get"" this movie.

This special effects extavaganza is simply a tongue-in-cheek, campy homage to the greatest monsters of the 30,s 40s, 50s and 60's.... Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, and the Wolfman. Not to be condescending, but it is incomprehensible to me that so many critics simply couldn't understand this.... as obvious as it is. How can you watch David Wenham's portrayal of Friar Carl and not recognize this???

Dracula's wives were absolutley terrific... and just as I had envsioned them from Stoker's novel (with an added campy line or two). Glad I didn't see that part of the movie when I was 7 years old..... I wouldn't have slept for the next 7 years!. Dracula was excellent.... melodramatic sometimes, frightening the next. He had the look and feel down pat (and the CGI Dracula late in the movie was a might impressive, too).

Frankenstein's monster was also excellent.... just the right mix of pathos, humor and terror. LOVED the electricity buzzing around his head!

Wolfy didn't have all that much screen time, but he was appropriately scary with the best transformation scenes ever.

Kate Beckinsale was there pretty much for her looks (which was ok with me). Although her accent was terrible, it was easy to overlook considering the campiness of the movie.

Hugh Jackman's Van Helsing was superb... fine acting sometimes, and you'd swear he's looking and winking at the camera the next. He seemed to truly have a feel for the intent of the picture.

The sets were incredible.... just perfect on all counts. The sequence where they are flying down the mountainous road in the coach (and all that went with it) was gorgeous to look at and exhilarating to watch. The castles, the village..... Just WOW!

Look..... If you haven't seen this picture, watch it understanding that it's INTENDED to be campy, yet pay proper respects to the monsters of old, all the while with great effects and a decent story.

2102065,1,B0002KVUKW,"I remember, when I was young, idolizing the vampire hunter Van Helsing the vampire hunter.  I would get together with one of my friends and together we would try to slay my sister or the school bully.  Then I heard a movie about Van Helsing was coming out and I was very excited.  Then the movie came out and I was very, very, VERY upset.  Van Helsing is one of those movies that does everything wrong and doesn't try hard not to.  There is so much wrong with Van Helsing I didn't know where to start.  But I think I'll start with Van Helsing himself.

Van Helsing is essecentially a frankenstein made out of the parts of better heroes.  He is dressed like Indian Jones's evil brother trying so desperately to be as cool.  He has gadgets like James Bond that really shouldn't exsist in that period and still don't exsist today.  Like the rapid fire crossbow.  And he has the personality of Wolverine gone so far as to have amnesia.

Sadly, he isn't well acted either.  In fact, none of the people act well in this entire picture.  This is especially noticeable with Dracula himself who has the fakest accent possible.  What truly amazes me is that these actors normally do a good job.  Apparently the director was content with them giving their lowest performances.

It is apparent that most of the money went to the special effects, which are just as dissapointing.  The monsters seem to have been designed by a five-year-old on crack.  And they aren't all that well rendered either.  Most of the monsters resemble moving glob of jello.

Then you have a story.  Van Helsing is an amnesiac who works for a secret service hunting down monsters.  Th monsters seem to all have once been human.  As a result, Van Helsing is seen as a murder, and isn't liked or wanted.  And Van Helsing doesn't seem to like his job either.  So you wonder why he bothers doing it at all.  Anyway, Van Helsing is sent to kill Dracula who seems to know him.  Van Helsing than meets some princess played by Kate Beckinsale.  She can't go to heaven until, Dracula is dead.  This is hard as Dracula can't be killed by the same ways a vampire or human.  You stake him, garlic him or even burn him he won't die.  So how is he a vampire exactly?  And while were at it, why is there a full moon every night?  Why does frankenstein have giant orbs on his body?  And why, for the love of god, did Van Helsing bring a pathetic monk with him?

This movie has nothing entertaining about it.  The only person who is dumb enough to watch it is probably Hugh Jackman.  Hopefully, a good Van Helsing movie will come out.  Until then, quench your vampire action craving with Underworld",1119398400,4,2644,4.429166666666666
2102066,2,B0002KVUKW,"This movie was OK, but not very good. There are too many special effects in this movie, and they take away the movie's realness.

2102067,4,B0002KVUKW,"The classic horror fiends of yesteryear unite in the 2004 film ""Van Helsing"".  Starring Hugh Jackman as the title character, Gabriel Van Helsing, the film also includes Kate Beckinsale (""Pearl Harbor"" and ""Underworld"") and David Wenham (""Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" and ""Return of the King"") as his allies in the attempt to stop Dracula's dastardly plans.  Despite some minor drawbacks, ""Van Helsing"" is a fun, action packed flick that spans a variety of film genres.

It's Transylvania in the late 1800s and Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) has acquired the services of Dr. Victor Frankenstein (Samuel West) to produce a creature.  The plan?  The Frankenstein monster (Shuler Hensley) will help bring life to  Dracula's and his three bride's offspring.  However, things go awry when the local townspeople burn a windmill that the creature has escaped to.

Enter Van Helsing who has been sent to Paris to capture Mr. Hyde (voice of Robbie Coltrane) and is accused of murdering him.  Vatican City, which has been harboring Van Helsing, orders him on a trip to Transylvania with a friar, Carl (Wenham).  With the aide of Carl's various gadgets, the pair's mission is to stop Dracula while protecting Anna Valerious (Beckinsale), who's the only chance her family has from spending an eternity in purgatory.

Van Helsing and company have the odds stacked against them.  Not only do they have the unenviable task of battling Dracula and his brides, but there's also Igor (Kevin O'Connor), a protg of Dr. Frankenstein's, and the Wolfman (Will Kemp) to contend with.  However, Van Helsing, Anna and Carl are able to befriend a most unusual ally.

There are many good things to point out about ""Van Helsing"".  Nobody likes a long, drawn out movie.  ""Van Helsing"" isn't one of these.  The film is fast paced and doesn't allow for many dull moments.  Whether it's one of the many action sequences or a simple conversation between the characters, the movie and the storyline keep moving.

While the entire cast was a great ensemble, there were a few standout performances.  David Wenham adds some comedic relief as the apprehensive and timid friar turned sidekick who eventually comes into his own.  Also, Shuler Hensley cast Frankenstein's monster in a more different light than we are used to seeing.  This was a nice and classic touch.

Another plus for ""Van Helsing"" was the title character.  There have been many movies that have portrayed Van Helsing as an elderly Vampire killer.  For once, moviegoers get to see Van Helsing's earlier days and even get to know the character's background.

Despite being an entertaining movie, there are a couple of distractions.  While Richard Roxburgh was a good Dracula, the character didn't come across as evil as he could have been.  In the movie, Dracula is supposed to be the main villain, however, in some scenes, he comes across as comedic.  The same holds true with Dracula's three brides.  For vicious, blood drinking sirens, they often come across as whiney.

The very end of the movie also serves as a drawback.  The battle beforehand provides an exciting turn of events.  However, the scene afterwards, with the sky and the clouds, seems almost anticlimactic.

""Van Helsing"" seems to include a little bit of everything.  Any moviegoer who likes action, drama, horror, comedy and even a touch of romance will thoroughly enjoy the movie.",1118880000,,3379,4.994623655913978

The plot was weak, most of the action scenes were laughable.

The only funny thing was the ?monk?. He was hilarious.

Most of the ""surprises,"" were not surprises.

If the family had to kill dracula or go to hell (or something like that) then why didn't they have more than two children? And why hadn't their late 20's daughter not already had children? If she was willing enough to rebel and wear pants, why bother with the corset?  Im sure they could have found something a bit more appropriate that still managed to have the sex appeal they were trying for.

They needed to explain much more. Maybe if they had said, 9 of my siblings died fighting the supernatural beasts, we're the only ones left. Instead they left it unexplained.

2102070,4,B0002KVUKW,"Showing you where I stand, Frank Langella will always be Dracula to me, and Laurence Olivier will always be Abraham Van Helsing to me. Also, so you know,this is not Dracula in the most traditional sense. If this is what you are looking for, then you are better off looking in the direction of Lugosi or Langella. All of that said, this is an excellent movie well worth watching. It pays tribute to the many horrors of the past. (Frankenstein, Dracula, The Wolfman) It even starts by showing the first scene in black and white. (A nice tribute to the black and white era of horror movies.) While paying tribute to this time in the history of horror, the movie takes a closer look at the hero (Van Helsing). While Peter Cushing (Christopher Lee's enemy)  and Laurence Olivier (Frank Langella's enemy) handled the role of Van Helsing with style and charm, this movie explores the inner struggles of Van Helsing. This time, the hero is kind of an Indiana Jones type. (A basically good person who has faults and is willing to operate outside the law if he has to.) Van Helsing's allies are well placed. (The woman who carries a personality not so different from himself, and the side kick who is a little more innocent and nervous, but loyal and dedicated.) While many of us are used to the silent and frightening Frankenstein as portrayed in horror, the Frankenstein here is a little closer to the actual book. (Someone who is articulate and carries a deep sadness.) Dracula doesn't quite dominate the screen the way Frank Langella does, but again, this movie is more about Van Helsing. But Dracula does have an acceptable amount of screen time, and despite his evil, he has his charm. The scenery is not exactly up to Director Franco Zeffirelli, but it is memorable. I'm not one who really cares for special effects, but this is one rare case where the special effects flatter the events instead of distracting from them. I don't want to say too much and possibly ruin the movie for you, but they cleverly avoid the cliche happy ending. If you like this movie, I can suggest the following items as well. The book ""Frankenstein"" (1831) by Mary Shelley, the Lugosi version of ""Dracula,"" (1931), ""Horror of Dracula,"" (1958), and Frank Langella's ""Dracula"" (1979).",1118016000,,2257,4.713924050632912

2102072,4,B0002KVUKW,"I was really expecting a schlocky summer film when I heard of this one.  After buying it and watching it I was quite surprised to discover that it was really quite good.

Van Helsing, Gabriel and not Abraham from Dracula, is a mystery.  He was found on the steps of Saint Peter's with no memory.  He was then enlisted by a society that protects the world from evil.

We first meet Van Helsing as he confronts Mr. Hyde at Notre Dame Cathedral.  After that mission he is sent off to deal with Dracula, a vampire.  This is not Stoker's Dracula, but an interesting new creation.  This time Van Helsing is given a guide who's character offers a lot color to the film.  He must stop Dracula before a certain family line is extinguished.

Well, it wouldn't be a good movie if everything went as planned.  With werewolves, vampires and the legacy of Frankenstein running through the film Van Helsing is kept very busy and the audience entertained.  There are some points that seem to have been lifted right from The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen but it is mostly fresh and original.  We see a good number of Universal's classic monsters in a whole new light (we miss the Mummy, Invisible Man, and the Creature especially).

2102078,4,B0002KVUKW,"""Van Helsing"" has not received so much publicity here, so I really did not know what to expect when I saw it. I knew it was connected marginally to ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"", (where they mention Van Helsing's name once, I think). To say the least, I was very pleased with the movie overall, from the plot to the special effects.

Van Helsing, (Jackman), starts the movie by doing in Mr Hyde, after which he is sent by a secret church order to Transylvania to help the beautiful, perhaps equally deadly, princess of an old gypsy family, (Beckinsale), save her family from Purgatory by eliminating Count Dracula, (Roxborough). Monsters from just about every classic book are in this movie from Frankenstein's creature, werewoves, and more.

The action sequences are stunning, and the special effects used to achieve them are amazing. Van Helsing comes fully laden with lots of nifty goodies that are not so nifty for monsters. There are also moments of suspense in places that keep you on the edge of your seat for a bit of time. The balance between plot development, suspence and good, old-fashioned action has been well struck, and suits the movie well. It hardly feels like a movie that is over two hours long.

Hugh Jackman is very suave and cool in the role of Van Helsing. Jackman brings a very real sense of style to the role, bringing out the intense pain of a man that is tortured by a past that he doesn't remember and a life that he seemingly has no control over. Little wonder the makers were set on Jackman from the start. Kate Beckinsale is truly sultry and beautiful as Anna Valerious. She truly carries the driven and almost fanatical feel of the character well, and she really lets the viewer see the intense emotions of a woman driven by loss.

There were only two points on which I would criticise the movie in a small way. First, was that the love interest between Anna and Van Helsing was a little bit predictable and unnecessary to the plot overall. Having said that, I have to also concede that the tension between the two provided some needed light relief from the overall darkness of the movie. Secondly, is Roxborough's Dracula, who seemed a little non-evil. In contrast to people like Anthony Hopkins, (Hannibal Lector in ""Silence of the Lambs""), who can just ooze brooding and malevolent evil of the deepest kind, Roxborough seemed a little like a school boy try-hard succeeding in only reaching ""mildly bad"". Dr Evil in ""Austin Powers"" might term him ""diet evil"".

If you can, the twin DVD set is an excellent buy and worth the money for the added features. They have an extensive section on the effects, which is incredibly interesting. I found it noteworthy that the actor who played Frankenstein's monster, also doubled as the human model in the scenes with Mr Hyde, so that Jackman had someone to look at before they inserted images of the computer Hyde into the shot. I also thoroughly enjoyed the sections on the making of the film, which provided some very cool background to the movie, and the bloopers, which were quite amusing.

For a monster movie full of action and gadgets, ""Van Helsing"" is hard to beat. I loved it, and have seen it a few times without getting bored. The criticisms above are relatively minor and should not discourage you from enjoying what is a classic tale with lots of action. A fantastic movie, indeed.",1116288000,,3379,4.699324324324325

The Mummy Returns was only crap in my opinion because of the terrible CG effects, other than that it was pretty consistent in quality.  Van Helsing somehow tries to combine The Wolfman, Dracula, and Frankenstein into one movie called Van Helsing.  Though, Van Helsing is not the same character from Dracula and really has nothing to do with anything.  The mythologies of these three worlds are completely wasted for some crappy ""comedic"" lines and some overblown special effects.  The movie runs about 2 hours and 12 minutes and could've been edited to the pace that it was meant for.  Heck, it might have even been a good movie if it wasn't so long.  This film just reminds me of the 1979 Universal Dracula remake, which was crap as well and that's because it tried too hard to be great like it's predecessors, and with the classic Universal horrors you can't do that.

In the beginning, Mr. Hyde makes an impressive cameo appearence, although this seemed a bit unecessary, and could have been saved for a subsequent film, along with perhaps The Mummy - even with the other monsters for that metter. Unfortunatey, the characters in this depiction are rather one-dimensional, and the scenes move by much too quickly - the overall impression of this presentation seems more like an action-adventure fight movie, rather than a horror film, so the true fear element is absent here, but is fun nonetheless.

I enjoyed the impressive aesthetics of The Wolfman, done to perfection in My opinion, although Count Dracula could have been better cast, but the brides are exquisite in their beauty and ferocity.  I thought it adorable when the ""draclings"" were released from their cocoons, flying down to feed upon the villagers below. Frankenstein is a tormented creature here, inspiring pathos in his apparent selfless nature and terrible desolation.

Van Helsing himself is presented in a more contemporary manner, wielding remarkable weaponry, particularly the rotary crossbow and the shiroken-like blades. He is commissioned by The Vatican to purge these 'evils' from the world, and during his travel to Transylvania, meets with a gorgeous brunette warrior-princess, who joins him in his quest, whose brother just happens to be the wolfman. Eventually, Van Helsing is infected by The Werewolf curse, that proves to be a key ingredient in his battle with the demonic Dracula. I did like that idea - that The Count tranforms into a magnificent Vampire-Demon  - a decided improvement on his humanoid counterpart.

He's constantly being captured by Dracula's midgets and in one scene he's chained to a table that's held together with a tiny lock.  That lock would be inadequate to secure a gym locker.

As for the story and script, there's nothing positive I can say about them.  If the script-writers for this junk are over 12 years old, I would be shocked.  There are so many scenes in this film where there is nothing but screaming.  There must have been pages and pages of script with nothing but ""Aaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh......"" all over them. If you are expecting any kind of drama or suspense, forget it.  A little witty humor is fine in a movie, but it's overkill here.  After being constantly bombarded with cheesy one-liners, you start to wonder if this was supposed to be a comedy.  Does every action movie require the bumbling comic relief sidekick?  Talk about a done-to-death cliche.  Does every action movie have to use this tired out formula?  I'm sure that if there is a ""Van Helsing II"", we will almost certainly get the wise-cracking kid added to the lineup.

2102084,4,B0002KVUKW,"Some people may have been thinking that this was supposed to be a serious horror genre film, and that it actually came off as a little bubblegummy.  I think that was what the movie about, more a fun, playful way of integrating these characters.  While Stephen Sommers did forego any gore or gruesome horror (or realism: Kate Beckinsale gets thrown fifty feet a hundred times and she lands on her feet every time), he did bring together a plot that is fun.  The plot was coherent (made sense), and aside from some occasional goofy parts (like Kate's invincibility), was presentable.  Sommers managed to write something that had a need and motive for all its characters, and that was the magic of the movie.  The plot wasn't so much ingenious at face value as it was clever when you think about all the work that went into a fairly simple plot to get it out there.
  This movie had everything you could want visually (heh).  While Dracula's brides were eyecandy with bad accents, the werewolves (my favorite mythological creature) and the Dracula Beast (a good point of originality here) were AWESOME (not to mention Mr. Hyde, who is my monster man although he was [purposefully?] CGI-looking).  The sets and scenery was enormous and breathtaking, ""Sommers-sizing"".  Probably the best sets (at least in creating a world) I've ever seen and has ever been.  The overall look and feel was the movie's strongest point.
  Hugh Jackman was, I guess, adequate as Van Helsing (he didn't have much to do).  Kate Beckinsale was, shall we say, audibly hilarious, but I think she was a good character.  Velkan was done well by Will Kemp.  Now we're onto vampires, my most and least favorite characters contained in this sphere.  Dracula's brides were just a bunch of cleavage, and parents will probably want to think about whether to let their children see this movie on that note.  The head vampire, none other than Count Vladislus Dracula, was so cool.  Richard Roxborough (I can't spell his last name! I think) as Dracula come off as the only truly creepy character in the whole thing.  Quite a performance, in my humble opinion, and definitely the best acting job of the movie.
  Other than the enormous amount of cleavage and sensuality (normal vampire fare), Van Helsing is okay for kids.  Not any blood or anything particularly scary in terms of graphic detail  or violence.
  Overall, I would buy this movie (if I was allowed to) because it is thoroughly enjoyable and worth watching over and over again.  Worth a rental to see what you think! Good movie!",1114473600,2,2549,4.773455377574371
2102085,1,B0002KVUKW,"I had high hope for this movie - all of my favorite characters of novels being hunted by Hugh Jackman (the Wolverine in X-men).

However, from the star this movie is just plain silly. It relies completely on computer technology but the story is lost. There is no character development and no decent interactions. There are not even any decent one-liners!

Save your money from something much better - say ""Dude, Where'w My Car."" That movie was one of my worst rated films, but then came Van Helsing.",1114387200,2,499,4.659090909090909
2102086,2,B0002KVUKW,"It's amazing what you can find when you're flipping channels.  Sometimes, you strike gold and find something captivating, and sometimes you find something that's so bad you just have to watch it to see how bad it gets.  This is especially true on Saturday nights, such as yesterday.  I was cruising the movie channels, and I happened upon Van Helsing, just starting.  I'd heard that it could be a fun movie, so I decided to stay on the channel and watch it.  Over two hours later, it ended and I was wondering, ""What was that??""  Hugh Jackman tries hard, and the only really bad thing about Kate Beckinsale was her accent, but otherwise, this movie was a mess.

It's usually a bad sign when the viewer starts giving the movie the Mystery Science Theater treatment right from the very beginning, but Van Helsing just called for it.  The very first scene, detailing the classic scene from Frankenstein where the good doctor (Samuel West) is bringing his creation to life as the villagers attempt to storm the castle, is horribly overacted, mainly on Roxburgh's part as Dracula.  Then, after a thoroughly ridiculous action sequence in Paris with Van Helsing and Mr. Hyde, along with the introduction of Anna in a Transylvanian sequence, we get to the Vatican and get introduced to the best character in the movie:  Carl (David Wenham).  Carl really did make this movie for me.  His dialogue consisted of the only lines that didn't make me cringe (some of the stuff Beckinsale and Jackman have to deliver, despite their best efforts, is truly laughable).  His was the only accent that didn't sound badly done (probably because he wasn't trying to put one one).  His ""actually, I'm only a friar"" excuse for why he can both curse occasionally and why he can take his reward from the young lady who he saves was great.  The movie literally improved every time he was on the screen.  Especially good was the ""Q briefs Bond"" sequence in the Vatican's underground chamber where he's talking to Van Helsing, showing him his new weapons and his other gadgets.

The other good thing about the movie is the cinematography.  The scenery, both natural and computer-generated, really heightened the mood of the movie.  It was beautiful, but it was also dark and moody, bringing a sense of the underlying evil layered over the village and castle.  Both castles were also magnificent, with towers reaching for the sky, bridges over vast chasms, and huge rooms to make room for all of the equipment.  It is truly a beautiful movie as far as setting is concerned.

Unfortunately, that's where the good things stop.  While most of the computer-generated scenery is first-rate, that doesn't stretch to the effects themselves.  Everything else looked like computer animation, throwing me out of the movie almost constantly during the action scenes.  The transformations from human to wolf or from vampire to flying harpy were decent, but the results of those transformations moved around like a video game rather than anything coming close to realism.  I realize effects are going to look like effects at times, as computers are not perfect.  Van Helsing just moved too far toward the fake end of the spectrum for me.  When the characters are thrown through the air, they don't bear any resemblance to human movement.

Speaking of the action scenes, too often they contain scenes that are so far out of the realm of possibility that they threw me out of my suspension of disbelief.  Anna gets tossed high in the air, hits a wall at full force, falls at least 30 feet, and lands.  She gets up trying to shake the cobwebs out of her head from a fall that would shatter the bones of any other human.  Van Helsing has an automatic crossbow, which is a forgivable conceit.  It looks really cool.  I guess God is granting him the crossbow bolts, though, as he goes through dozens of them in one battle without ever reloading.  One funny bit was when Anna takes one of Dracula's brides to task for talking rather than just killing her, neatly turning an action movie clich on its head.  It would mean more in a movie that wasn't committing all of the other clichs, though.

The worst thing about the movie, however, was the dreadful acting by almost everybody involved. I've already singled out Roxburgh for the first sequence, but his acting is terrible throughout the movie.  I don't think there's a piece of scenery left on the set after he's done.  Dracula's wives do their best to out-do him, though.  They are consistently horrible.  All of their accents sound incredibly fake and forced (I don't know the actors' nationalities, but they sound fake to me).  None of the others even really reach the ""acceptable"" line.  Jackman and Beckinsale try their hardest, but even their acting abilities are strained by what they're given.  The dialogue is horrible all the way around (except some of Carl's).  When Dracula tries to entice Van Helsing by informing him of some of his past, I was beyond the point of caring.

There are two reasons I'm giving this movie two stars rather than one.  The first is Carl.  The second is, despite how bad it is, it does entertain a little bit.  Once you've accepted the action sequences for what they are, they are kind of fun.  The climactic sequence is actually quite entertaining in a ""yeah, right"" kind of way.  Beckinsale's beautiful and Jackman (for you women out there) is hunky.  While I certainly wouldn't pay money for this monstrosity, I don't feel like I want my two hours back.  I'd settle for an hour's change back for the two that I spent.

2102087,1,B0002KVUKW,"I took my sister out for her 22nd birthday and ""Van Helsing"" was the movie she wanted to see. What resulted were shaking heads, mild chuckles and a whole lot of perspiration. This film was so bad it actually made my feet stink. No, I'm not kidding.

To get down to brass tacks, Stephen Sommers is a hack who means well but never hits the mark. The first ""Mummy"" film was adventurous and suspenseful, with some well-balanced humor thrown in, and then people started to do a double take of uncertainty when ""The Mummy Returns"" was unleashed. Sommers obviously brushed the flak off his shoulders and wanted to do a film that brought back the campy, exciting appeal of the 30's era of monster classics we have all grown to know and love. People were jazzed that they would finally be seeing Dracula, Frankenstein, the Wolf Man and even Mr. Hyde on the same screen. Sommers simply raped this opportunity and utilized each and every single monster in the worst light. Dracula? Nothing more than a snivelling idiot. Frankenstein? A hulking idiot who not only whines incessantly, but also possesses a vast vocabulary and serves as an ally (!) to our ""heros"", Van Helsing and the, uh, woman played by Kate Beckinsale. Wolf Man? A badly CGI'd cardboard cutout of a monster that does not exude the tragedy he is famous for.

This was a bad move for Hugh Jackman. Here he is, fresh out of X2, and can't seem to hold his ground without invoking reminders of Wolverine. In fact, Van Helsing's character dangles a hair away from rip-off lane. Van Helsing, like Wolverine, has no past he can remember and is probably immortal. In a scene where I literally exploded with chuckles, Dracula comes VERY close, and I'm not screwing around here, at giving Jackman a line of dialogue that resembles what Brian Cox said to Wolverine in X2, except in a different context.

Kate Beckinsale. Again, this was a bad move on her part. It is as if she walked right off the set of ""Underworld"" and filmed this puppy the following week. Starring in two movies that deal with werewolves and vampires is not a good way to play your cards straight.

I know that this was intentionally cheesy, but like ""Batman and Robin"", it tries vainly to combine new-age sophistication with cheesiness, and that immediately rules it out as a bad film. When I wasn't angry at this travesty, my laughter was a subtle reassurance. My sister chimed in there was an awful stink near. I don't know if it was my feet or ""Van Helsing"".

There is action in this movie, but at times it is simply boring. Also, it is very hard to 'get lost' and not understand what is happening. The movie relies heavily on special effects, and those special effects are nothing special.

The script is an absolute mess, trying to cram in everything but the kitchen sink, and the highly anticipated effects prove to be a total disappointment. If I never again see another flying and shrieking vampire/harpy, or another vampire make its entrance by dropping down from the top of the frame, or another CG werewolf bouncing off CG walls, or another hero or villain swing across wide expanses on ropes, I'll be a happy man. The transformation scenes are cheesy (but with none of the charm of the 40s originals they try to emulate), and the CG creatures too often resemble George Pal Puppetoons in their movement. If there had been a little more emphasis on a logical plot and any character development rather than the overemphasis on FX, maybe they could have spent a little more time modeling and animating the CG correctly. But when you use as much as there is here, there are bound to be shortcuts and sub-par animation. At the very least, I thought this film would be dumb fun, but it disappoints even at that level. You'll find yourself looking at your watch and thinking ""Hello, I already SAW this -- how much longer?""

2102091,3,B0002KVUKW,"With Vampires being a mythological character that many adore and admire, and many film versions of the Dracula story has come to be.  This film is not one of the top Dracula fims that has been made.  Were, we have a plotline that follows Van Helsing going around the world trying to save it from all kind of beasts and demons for the catholic church.  However,  the movie does a poor job on portraying the character Van Helsing as a heroic character and as a savoir of humanity.  The character of Dracula is spinned off into a new direction of coming to be a vampire, its not from hatred of the catholic church because of a lost love as in the book.  But is made a vampire because he made a deal with the devil for immortality as long as he serves the devil on earth.  Which is not to enticing of a character storyline but still ties into the movie in general.

  Kate Beckinsale does a horrible job with her eastern europe accent but still manages to make a decent attempt at acting as the movie love interest/co-hero of Van Helsing.

  Furthermore, this movie is driven by the special effects that so many big budget movies are.  Which in turn, like so many before it,  lack a true plotline.  Where the characters are bound to the typical actions of a hero storyline.  Although there are a some well timed humor and decent acting from the main characters, that make this movie an enjoyable and entertaining movie to watch.

  The Special Effects in of themselves are actually really good.  With amazing footage and computer generated scenes makes the movie into a great spectical.  It does capture the goth life style that was prominate during that time period and setting the mood for each scene.  For that this movie gets an A-minus.

  The Directing of this movie was well thought out and done beautifully but could not save this film enough to make it a classic film or even a good film.

To be sure the special effects are dazzling.  But this was the real problem with The Mummy Returns.  After salivating over the Rock and hoping that Brandon would reveal a little flesh, the movie descended into one big special effect.

2102095,4,B0002KVUKW,"Don't let the negative comments scare you away from this film;  most of these viewers totally missed the point of the film.  This is a actually a parody of the horror genre (like Polanski's ""The Fearless Vampire Killers"").  So if you don't appreciate parody don't watch it and I'm not guaranteeing that you will find it good parody, just don't dismiss the film because somebody thought it was serious and said or wrote something negative about it-they are probably clueless.

Parody/satire of horror films has a long tradition and ranges from the obvious (see Abbott & Costello, Mel Brooks, and ""Redneck Zombies"") to the subtle (see ""The Fearless Vampire Killers"" and ""Evil Dead""). Before reading many of the comments I would have grouped ""Van Helsing"" closer to the obvious, after all the film depicts a Vatican Department modeled on James Bond's Special Weapons ""Q"" Section. But apparently even something so obvious is not registering with many people, if the true measure of a 'subtle' satire is how many people just don't get it, then ""Van Helsing"" certainly qualifies.

They went into this project saying something like: ""let's use digital effects and a large budget to create the most interesting sets in horror movie history, and then use these as a backdrop for a parody of the ""horror genre"". When concerns were raised about the expense for just a comedy, they pitched it as a sophisticated parody that would not get in the way of the average viewer's desire to see a traditional vampire movie. Such a dichotomy allows the movie to generate big bucks at the box office while still providing its makers with an outlet for their creativity. But such a dichotomy means there will be a third group of viewers who cannot suspend disbelief enough to enjoy it as a horror film and yet will totally miss the parody angle (the only question is whether they too humorless to find enjoyment in such frivolity or are just a little too dim to appreciate it).

The movie opens with a visually awesome scene of the villagers storming a huge castle and burning a windmill; the sets and the music are great. Except for the overacting and the presence of an assistant named 'Egor' or ""Igor"" (see Mel Brooks reference), you would not suspect that this is anything but a serious horror film.

The film plays homage to the Karloff/Chaney films, to Abbott and Costello, Mel Brooks, James Bond and The Wild, Wild West. There is a little Phantom of the Opera and even Eli Wallach's best line from 'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' (if you're going to shoot, shoot don't talk). In fact they even lift the vampire ballroom scene from ""The Fearless Vampire Killers"".

The individual performances are from the William Shatner School of Over-Acting with Dracula's brides totally stealing each scene in which they are featured. I particularly liked Josie Maran (who had that great scene as the cigarette girl in ""The Aviator"") as Marishka. The costumes are almost as good as the sets. The computer-generated action sequences illustrate all the problems with digital effects, but work fine as satirical devices.

So if you want to see a fun film with unparalleled visuals this is the one. Others who can suspend disbelief and ignore a few campy elements will enjoy it as a straight vampire picture. But if you are can't, are just humorless, or don't know the horror genre you should stay away.

Because there are really two movies here, the first viewing withholds most of the viewing pleasure; once you understand what is happening repeated viewings are even more fun. I suggest getting the ""Ultimate Edition"" DVD because of all the extras it contains.

But by the time the credits rolled on this over-the-top, typical modern Hollywood F/X-in-search-of-a-story dreck, I was almost embarrassed for him.  This movie is so bad, on so many levels.

First, it's every traditional horror movie monster you ever loved and/or were scared of, smashed together in a ridiculously contrived and confusing saga in which Frankenstein somehow holds the key to giving life to Dracula's Babies of the Dead.  Does that sound ridiculous?  Well, that's essentially what we've got here, and this doesn't even account for the ancient family curse, the Wolfman angle, and the ancient Vatican mercenary force which guards the world against all manner of evil . . . blah blah blah.  Absolutely preposterous schlop, through and through.

The movie is all F/X and CGI backgrounds, and more F/X, and more backgrounds, and ridiculous acrobatic fighting and motions.  It's just as bad as the absurd acrobatics in that second&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Charlie-s-Angels/dp/B00005JLYW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Charlie's Angels</a>&nbsp;monstrosity.  Everything happens perfectly, everything is in sync, all of the right things happen for the good guys, and all of the wrong things happen for the bad guys, just when they're needed.  Lots of totally inexplicable and lame plot devices, just to keep the ridiculous story moving along, and to get us from one scene to another.

I watched this film--a number of times, actually--on a 15-hour plane flight from Hong Kong to New York.  It killed time on the flight, sure, but by the time the credits rolled, I was genuinely glad that it was over, and that I was no longer subjected to the subtly insulting devices and diversions, the over-the-top and ridiculously impossible action and stunts and CGI-provided points of views and movements that Hollywood in general and these producers and this director specifically figure I'll just accept, grinning stupidly over my extra-large popcorn.

If you're into shallow, internally contradictive, mindless horror films, with lots of over-the-top CGI, then this is for you.  If you've got half a brain, and find yourself asking connective and conjectural questions about characters' movements, motivations, and other simple observations that really shouldn't arise when you're supposed to be suspending your disbelief for a cinematic experience, then this flick is not going to work for you, just as it didn't work for me.",1110240000,12,2895,5.973365617433414

2102110,2,B0002KVUKW,"And there were lots of them. Dracula walking on walls was a good one, as were the transformations and the CG harpies.

I think the women's costumes count as special effects, too. Anna's exaggerated hour-glass figure says a lot about Kate Beckinsale's ability to endure a corset. Also, her blouse managed to cover her quite properly and still convey the idea of not being there - that was pretty special. I think some strategically placed pink pectoral patches enhanced that illusion. Those brides of Dracula had some very special effects in their bodices as well. (BTW, after seeing where the spawn of Dracula comes from, I really don't want to know much about their home life.)

Plot? I guess there might have been one. Sort of. The lead character, Van Helsing, goes around shooting bad guys with a sort of crossbow/Gatling gun kind of thing. I suppose I could say more, but it still wouldn't add up to real story line.

It's an exciting movie in a bland sort of way. You could do worse - but you might have to try.

The characters were cartoonish and over the top the plot was ridiculous. The CGI was overused ( you can literally not go 5 minutes in this movie without seeing CGI ) and the most intense scene in the movie was when Hugh Jackman's crotch get too close to a wagon wheel...Will his crotch survive? Buy the movie and see.

And a few minor aspects of irritation...

The vampire was so wimpy that the singer for The Cure could kick his butt, he was like a melodramatic goth kid.

The lead actress's hair, costume and make-up remain spotlessly perfect throughout the movie.

Another good point.  Strange concept of vampires having babies, though (Not to mention how.)  Flies in the face of the very concept of such creatures.

Good story line, with those important, pivotal moments that come unexpectedly.

Dialogue was always mixed in at such a low volume, that I found myself constantly having to turn it up to hear something, only to then suddenly hear _very_ loud sound effects!

As a mindless special effects romp, I think the movie is tolerable. Great special effects are the ones you don't realize are special effects. The effects in this film do not fit that definition of great, the computer enhancement is obvious. The movie can be fun, but I don't think it should get any award for technical excellence.

The James Bond tie in, is that like a Bond film, the only relationship to the novel is maybe the title, and the name of the lead charactor(s). There is a Van Helsing in this movie, and there is a Dracula. That's where the similarity to anything that might have come from the pen of Bram Stoker ends. The movie is a series of high technology effects scenes very loosely tied together by an attempt at a plot.

Yes, details are of importance, and in this movie, they have been carefully chosen and put into practice. The computer work is terrific and sure it took thousands of work-hours.

But, we must be truthful. The mixture of characters is, at least, unfortunate. It is more or less ""the league of extraordinary monsters"". Gabriel Van Helsing is a XIXth Century James Bond, with a notable exception: ""Q"", that is, Carl is not only the source of all weapons and trickeries, but is like the fellow servant of Van Helsing.

Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde role is stupid, Frankenstein's ""good mood"" is pathetic, and only Count Dracula is the very very bad. I think it's not a matter of using all characters together. The problem is how to use them and, this is very important, how to perform them. Actors seem to be amateur and only computer can make good face and body expressions and motions.

2102123,1,B0002KVUKW,"Where to begin with this film?  Universal, well known as THE horror studio of the 30's and 40's made some amazing films; classics like Dracula, Frankenstein and The Werewolf.

Fast forward to 2004.  This movie is, quite simply, a piece of drek.  It is not even clever enough to rate as a lighthearted homage to those earlier works.  It is not worth the polyethylene terephthalate it was filmed on.

We have Abraham Van Helsing's younger sister's cousin's boy, a steam punk super secret James Bond-like Q bunker under the Vatican (!?) accessed by a special confessional, David Wenham of Lord of the Rings fame wondering if this is his future, playing buffoonish side kicks in bad scifi/fantasy flicks, and some really cheesy CGI work.  Considering the amount of money they spent on Kate Beckinsale's corset collection they could have kicked in a few bucks for better F/X.

The plot, such as it is, is an unlovely jumble of the three Universal classics mentioned above with a dash of Dr. Jekyll (as someone on LiveJournal put it, escaped from the League of Extraordinay Gentlemen) and James Bond.  Dracula wants Frankenstein (rather than Dr. Frankenstein) to animate vampire babies.  Nevermind the fact that a) vampires are generally considered, by legend, to be dead and unable to procreate b) and humans, even lightly dead ones, do not incubate their young in pupae.  But apparently vampires do.  And there's something to do with Kate Beckinsale's family being the last of the gypsies but their connection to the Dracula/Frankenstein/vampire pupae thing is tenuous at best, unless it's simply geographical distance.  Van Helsing is dispatched by the Vatican to stop Dracula's evil plot.  Or he's dispatched to Kate Beckinsale because... I'm not sure.  I think I was still boggled by the super secret lab.

To paraphrase the immortal words of Bill Macy in My Favorite Year, there's a lot of leaping and jumping but not so much drinking and humping.  There is much running about and CGI brides of Dracula and CGI werewolves and eye-rolling deus ex machina smacking you in the face and it really is never clear what any of them are doing or why they're doing it.  It's messy, uneven and laughable in moments where they're not making a pathetic effort at jokes.

In all seriousness this movie exists merely to show off Kate Beckinsale with tight leather pants, a brooding but anemic-looking Hugh Jackman and mediocre CGI work, the premise seeming to be that the movie-going public likes fast things, explosions, leather-clad, sword-wielding chicks and much rope swinging and we'll pay good money to see it, no matter how execrable the plot.

Van Helsing hops from one scene to the other quickly, hoping that the viewers won't notice. Weapons being 'out of ammo' when they are clearly not. People repeating the same thing twice.

2102132,5,B0002KVUKW,"Van Helsing (2004). Universal Pictures. Rated PG-13. Running Time: 2 hours, 11 mins. Live-action.
Directed, produced and written by Stephen Sommers.

Sequel to the animated film, Van Helsing: The London Assignment (2004). But this film starring Hugh Jackman is live-action.

 Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) is a traveler of the world killing the very things that we fear the most.  As Van Helsing says, if it bites humans and human created it, he will kill them.
  The story begins in black & white.  It is when the ""Frankenstein"" creature is being created in Transylvania.  Van Helsing is there as well.  He must destroy this creature.  One year later (now in color), he is after the ""Hyde"" creature that Dr. Jeckyll has transformed into.  Hyde is 25 times bigger than the hunchback of Norte Dame.  The fight is good one, but when Hyde becomes Dr. Jeckyll again, all that the townspeople see is a dead Dr. Jeckyll (now back to his normal human self)having fallen to the ground.  They believe Van Helsing killed him.  But of course.  However, the townspeople never saw the Hyde creature transform.  A Bishop calls upon Van Helsing to rid Europe of more of these ""creatures.  Next it's the werewolf.
  I shall not spoil any further surprises, but this is a fun film to watch.  This film seemed to come out of nowhere.  What a surprise!  I had no idea they were filming this one.
  Are you asking yourself where you have heard the name ""Van Helsing""?
  Edward Van Sloan played ""Van Helsing"" in Dracula (1931).
  Laurence Olivier played ""Van Helsing"" in Dracula (1979).
  Richard Benjamin played ""Van Helsing"" in Love At First Bite (1979).

  DVD includes a feature where by hidden cameras, not known where by the actors, can give you a different angle of the scene and show you how it was filmed.

2102133,2,B0002KVUKW,"2004's ""VAN HELSING"" is a special effects extravaganza. Some might think this is a good thing. I, on the other hand feel that it fails in the same way that 2003's ""HULK"" failed. First of all there are to many classic monsters in one movie. The actor that played Dracula should be shot. He was horrid. It was almost a comedic performance. He is probably the worse thing about the movie. Dracula is one of my favorite characters in film history, but it takes the right actor to play him. I'll take Gary Oldman anyday. Well enough about that. The story is ludicrous. Somehow Hollwood can bring Freddy and Jason together more believably than Dracula and Frankenstien, go figure.. In my one man's opinion, I feel that if you're gonna make a BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER movie, you should just call it that. I was inspired to watch 1992's ""BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA"" again (which features the character Van Helsing, played by Anthony Hopkins). I recommend you skip ""VAN HELSING"" and go with ""BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA"" instead. It's a classic. This film isn't. By the way there is a BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER movie, it's a comedy that stars Kristy Swanson as a cheerleader turned vampire slayer.",1107043200,3,1176,4.713592233009709
2102137,4,B0002KVUKW,"My wacky title for this review of the 2004 film ""Van Helsing"" is probably the most accurate way to describe this parody of both horror and James Bond films set in late nineteenth century Transylvania.  Written and directed by Stephen Sommers, it is no wonder that ""Van Helsing"" often felt more like a comedy & parody than a serious horror film since Sommers' earlier big-screen works include ""The Mummy"" (1999), ""The Mummy Returns"" (2001) and ""The Scorpion King"" (2002: which he wrote, but did not direct).  Like most 007 films, ""Van Helsing"" opens with the film's hero, Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman), battling a poorly rendered CGI giant of Mr. Hyde (Robbie Coltrane) at Notre Dame in Paris.  Upon defeating the giant, Van Helsing travels to a secret good-guy headquarters that is under the authority of a Catholic cardinal, Cardinal Jinette (Alun Armstrong), who is the film's equivalent to 007's boss known as ""M"".  After being scolded for killing Hyde instead of capturing him, Van Helsing is provided with new state-of-the-art, nineteenth-century paranormal spy-gear from a friar named Carl (David Wenham), who is the film's equivalent to 007's gadget supplier known as ""Q"", after being ordered to battle Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) and his wives who are terrorizing the last two members of the Valerious family: Anna (Kate Beckinsale) and her brother Velkan (Will Kemp).  If you haven't yet seen the film, you may be asking yourself, ""How does Frankenstein fit into all this?"" It seems that in order for Dr. Victor Frankenstein (Samuel West) to obtain the much-needed revenue to create his famous monster (Shuler Hensley), he has been aided by Count Dracula, who has a nefarious planned use for the monster.  When Dr. Frankenstein learns of this, he tries to stop Dracula, but is easily defeated since his assistant Igor (Kevin J. O'Connor) is already in league with Dracula.  Though thought to have been killed in a fire at the beginning of the film, Frankenstein's monster survives and eventually meets Van Helsing after he helps Anna and her village defeat an attack from Dracula's CGI-rendered wives.  Confused yet?  It gets better!  Not only does Count Dracula have his three wives (played by Elena Anaya, Silvia Colloca and Josie Maran) to help him, he also has his personal army of gas-mask-wearing oompa-loompas, which, unlike their 1971 ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" equivalents, don't sing any catchy tunes.  If this doesn't sound a bit over-the-top, let's not also forget the flying vampire babies that are highly reminiscent of the Cornish pixies from the 2002 film version of ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" or the flying monkeys from the 1939 ""The Wizard of Oz"".

Though you now may be thinking that this is a terrible film, in a strictly horror-genre sense, it is; but in a comedic parody sense, it's rather creative.  Granted, not all of the CGI effects were great, but the overall story and characters are entertaining.  Not surprisingly, the film only earned about a third of its estimated $160-million budget during its 2004 theatrical release because previews for the film had given the impression that ""Van Helsing"" was going to be a serious horror film, which left many theater-going patrons a sour experience upon seeing the film.  However, watching the film on DVD (at least from a rental perspective) is far cheaper and a more relaxing home-environment may allow some viewers the ability to see the film as a comedic parody.  I will say that the film's ending was a bit of a surprise that improved my overall opinion of it. My rating of the 2004 ""Van Helsing"" is, therefore, 3.5 out of 5 stars, rounded up to 4 stars.  Though the film could have relied less heavily upon CGI and been a bit more frightening, it is still entertaining when taken less seriously and with a greater sense of humor.",1107043200,,3846,4.937984496124031

2102142,4,B0002KVUKW,"This is a film that had such an excellent concept that depending on how it was handled, it would either be mildly diverting or truly enthralling. With a concept like this, it could be anything from decent to excellent. But to figure out which, I had to see it for myself.

Van Helsing

Here's how it ranked...

Sound: 4/5

Don't get me wrong. The sound quality was good, and the music was good too, just not great. Movies like ""The Mummy"" for example, outrank it pretty easily in terms of soundtrack quality. The music helps to set the mood well, but isn't worth buying the soundtrack for.

Graphics: 5/5

Okay, the graphics were perfect, and unlike in X-men, you got the chance to see them for more than a few seconds at a time.

Story Concept: 5/5

The concept is truly top-knotch. It's the story of Van Helsing the monster hunter and how he discovers his destiny to fight with Count Dracula and his evil minions. There's more to it than that, but the rest serves only to make the story even better.

Story Presentation: 4.5/5

The story presentation was generally very good, but I felt that the basic humanity kind of wasn't in most of the characters. The other problem I had was the amount of times Dracula would walk on walls and ceilings. I know it was meant to be aesthetically-creepy, but it just came off as goofy.

Acting: 3.5/5

This is the movie's biggest failing. Van Helsing and Anna both got wonderful acting talents, but most of the rest of them were mediocre actors, except Dracula, who was a truly horrible and cheesy actor, constantly posing, flourishing and over-enunciating his lines as though in an opera. The reason this grade isn't lower is that I think they made the Dracula performance cheesy on purpose, to mirror the performances of Bella Legosi and the others. Still, kind of a disappointment.

All in All: 4.4/5

It's a better-than-average movie. I reccomend it if you're a fan of the old-school horror genre to which it is, as far as I can tell, a fitting tribute. I was particularly impressed by the fact that they used the book version of the Frankenstein creature, to add a sense of pity and tragedy to the whole thing. Some of the character interactions were golden, and a lot of the fight scenes are among the best I've ever seen. In particular, the fight at the end between Dracula and a werewolf would make the entire movie worth it, even if it totally stunk, which it doesn't.",1106438400,4,2415,4.560185185185185
2102143,3,B0002KVUKW,"This movie is what it is. My favorite charactors were Dracula's Brides.

I know CGI is here to stay, but good Lord could we tone it down just a bit? I miss the good old days with stop motion action and people in costumes. The CGI looks just as fake as Stop Motion Puppets, but with CGI you feel like you're watching a video game instead of a film.

Some people will like this, some won't. It's one of those movies you really have to see for yourself because everyone has an opinion on it.",1106438400,,488,4.126315789473685

2102145,5,B0002KVUKW,"When I first saw the trailers for Van Helsing I was not very impressed with what I saw; it seemed overloaded with action and had no story.  Out of curiosity, I saw the film and enjoyed it.  I think that this is a film that one better appreciates after viewed more than once.

The film is a hi-tech version of the old Universal movies from the 1940's that featured Dracula, Frankenstein and the Wolfman; such films as The House of Dracula and The House of Frankenstein.  Much of the criticism of the film that I have read ignores that it is a parody of horror films, and meant to be fun.

Van Helsing has the loudest soundtrack that I have yet hear with a lot of loud drum pounding.  The story is flimsy: monster killed who has no memory set out to kill Dracula in Transylvania.  But this is not a movie that was put out so we could measure it for credibility: it is two hours of entertainment: it is a movie that does not pretend to be anything but entertainment.  It is not meant to be a classic horror tale nor a comic book.

Hugh Jackman is perfect as Van Helsing.  I don't think that another actor could create the same presence. Kate Beckinsale is good as Anna Valerious even if her accent sometimes seems forced.  It was interesting to see David Wenham as Carl after his role as Fairimir.  He brings off the part nicely, even if it takes a little to get used to seeing him as a frisky friar.  An equally interesting part is Shuler Hensley as the Frankenstein monster, who makes the creature into a credible and sympathetic personality despite the heavy makeup.  As for Richard Roxburgh as Dracula, it took a little while before I could see him in the role.  He may not be as obviously sinister as some vampires but he has a menace that fills the role when required.  The Brides are well cast and the special effects when they are flying are probably the most spectacular of the film.  Kevin O'Conner, who as Benny in The Mummy, is equally good as Igor.  His half-weary delivery of the line ""Yes, Master"" is a comic part of the movie.  And Samuel West, in the small role of  Dr. Victor Frankenstein, does a good imitation of Colin Clive saying ""It's alive! It's alive!""

So, I can recommend Van Helsing for the unashamed piece of entertainment that it is.  Why analyze such a movie? The story of bringing to life unborn vampire offspring is patently fatuous.  What rules does a movie have to follow just to entertain you?  If you are fast forwarding or are moaning that your favorite monsters are being ""misinterpreted"" you have missed the point.  This is a movie to sit back and watch for the ride not fault it for something it was never intended to be.",1106179200,2,2659,4.399590163934426
2102146,2,B0002KVUKW,"This movie disappointed me.  I was already anticipating a movie that was laden with special effects.  I was anticipating insipid humor.  I was still disappointed. Hollywood consistantly uses special effects to compensate for poor plot.  This movie disappointed me considerably.  I anticipated better acting, and an attempt on a plot.  They didn't even try.",1106006400,2,356,5.5
2102147,3,B0002KVUKW,"Although supposedly inspired by the Universal monster movies of the 1930s, ""Van Helsing"" has far more in common with both the anime film ""Vampire Hunter D"" and the Mel Brooks spoof ""Young Frankenstein."" Like the mysterious D, Van Helsing fights the supernatural while wearing a fedora and crop duster better suited to a spaghetti western, and much like ""Young Frankenstein,"" many of the scenes and virtually all the dialogue is laughable. I'm one of the few who thinks this was intentional; there were a lot of laughs in Universal's ""Mummy"" remakes, and it's possible that Universal was once again trying to interject comic relief into a feature film overburdened with special effects and an underwritten script.

Hugh Jackman, in his first leading role (he previously costarred in the X-men movies, among others), appears mainly bored or lost as the title character. He finds himself surrounded by oversized werewolves, harpy-like ""Brides of Dracula,"" the always lovely Kate Beckingsdale, a Shrek-like Mr. Hyde, and a seemingly endless series of exaggerated, cartoon-like stunts. There's some good stuff in here; the werewolves are better done than in the recent Harry Potter film, and with their faux Eastern European accents, the Brides of Dracula could probably carry their own comedy-horror film ala ""Love at First Bite."" But so much razzle-dazzle is constantly thrown at us that it's hard to truly enjoy much of this. Supposedly Van Helsing is employed by the Vatican to fight evil; I kept wondering why they didn't just hire the Ghostbusters instead. After all, the Ghostbusters were genuinely funny and memorable, unlike Van Helsing.

This biggest problem with this film (and its DVD) is that Universal proved they learned almost nothing from their 1940s horror films. Those films got sillier as the decade went on, but despite shrinking budgets attempted to compensate with good acting, clever makeup, and intriguing situations. ""Van Helsing"" has one-note performances, unbelievable caricatures, and a numbing succession of CGI scenarios.

The DVD includes a handful of extras. While scarce, they are well done, and move my rating of the DVD up from two stars to three. But ""Van Helsing"" is likely to go the way of other, easily forgotten ""high concept"" films. If you must have this, I'd seek out a used copy.",1105747200,2,2318,5.159574468085107

The writing is so very incredibly bad; one deus ex machina after another--the sort of writing you would hope someone would grow out of once they got out of 4th grade. Lots of noise, lots of really ugly CGI creatures, lots of attempts to sound savvy by referencing classic monster movies--also lots of cliched dialog and situations (and not used in a savvy way). None of it is the least bit interesting or makes the least bit of sense. It's just a total, utter, complete waste of time. Boredom in widescreen.",1105660800,4,545,4.628865979381444
2102150,3,B0002KVUKW,"For all of its campy charm, one could hardly describe VanHelsing as ""innovative"" in its narrative structure. This is the kind of movie that will allow you a protracted bathroom break in pretty much any given spot--and you can be guaranteed a return to your seat having missed nothing that you hadn't guessed already. But as long as you're in the market for 2 hours of hot people in cool clothes, well, hang onto your hats--because our hero is wearing a LOT of clothes.

Whether he's swinging from a cable over Notre Dame or zipping on horseback over the snow-covered mountains of eastern Europe, dear VanHelsing is sporting enough outerwear to dress every toothless, pitchfork-bearing villager in Transylvania. Yeah, I'll be the first to say it--he looks bulky. Uncomfortable, even. As if he's sporting a wine cask underneath that nifty vest, possibly.

In short, it wasn't the most flattering arrangement of leather and turtleneck that ever a good-looking superhero did don. Hugh spends the first hour and a half of the flick looking more bloated than hunky, and by the time he gets around to actually removing a bit of this cumbersome costume, it's (a). towards the very end of the movie and (b). a mere six seconds before he goes about morphing into something way ugly. You thought he was hairy in X-Men. Ha.

And then there's Kate, as bitchy-but-delectable Anna. There's not much to be said about her in this, really, except that yes--she looks great. Her costume makes up for everything imperfect about VanHelsing's, though by the time she finishes loading up with weaponry the outfit must weigh 80 pounds. Every now and again you get all excited as she reaches for a buckle--thinking, ""hey, maybe she's going to slip into something more comfortable!"" But she's usually just making adjustments to her Bat-Belt, which is hanging off her hips like a cast-iron hula skirt. I bet that sucker chafed.

At least VanHelsing thought to remove Anna's waist-contrivance when he gassed her and deposited her in her bedroom (for her own good), though he went ahead and left the tummy-pinching corset in place. It's no surprise that Anna wakes up cranky--trust me, if you sleep in one of those things you'll come to consciousness feeling like you've been beaten around the ribs with a baseball bat.

Then again, if Hugh Jackman put me to bed and I woke up alone, with all my clothes still on, I'd probably be pissed too.

Right. So. We've got Hugh and Kate dashing around, fighting vampires and werewolves, and somehow getting mixed up with the Frankenstein monster--who turns out not to be such a bad guy after all. Naturally, Count (""Bwah"") Dracula is behind all the mayhem, as he + his Freaky Brides Three are trying to reproduce in an elaborate and unlikely manner that requires a buttload of electricity [which in a roundabout way explains why a maniacal German scientist opted to build a castle in Transylvania. Sort of.].

Anyway, as you might expect, this movie lends itself spectacularly to MST3K behavior. The dialogue is clunky and either (a). just plain bad or (b). an attempt to be ironic that fails to register with those of us who have been blinded by the CGI, so by all means feel free to contribute your own running commentary. It's too damn easy.

But I say all of that to say this--it's never boring. Even when the action on screen falls short of making sense, there's always something nice to look at; and even though the dialogue is bad, the people being forced to work with it are clearly doing their best to make the most of a bad situation. VanHelsing is no masterpiece by any stretch of anyone's imagination; it's sensory overload from the opening frame, the storyline falls apart at regular intervals, and apparently Budapest and Italy are either a month's travel apart or 12 hours, depending on how badly you need an antidote for lycanthropy. And don't expect the ending to redeem this mess--the closing sequence is nothing short of godawful in its insistence upon cliche cheesiness. When the clouds parted and the faces appeared in heaven, I was less moved by the moment on the screen before me than by my recollections of The Lion King.

If you like being entertained with no strings attached, ""Van Helsing"" delivers.  Every movie ever made doesn't have to be profound.  Film snobs will hate ""Van Helsing"" and scoff because it lacks such things as ""irony"" and ""character development"".

I just couldn't adapt in time. Maybe if I watch it again, knowing it's a sort of big-budget monster comedy with an ""I'm ready for a sequel"" ending, I'll like it for what it is; but I feel so decieved.

I'm sure it will be a cult favorite. It's not badly done. It plays off every monster movie an dbook you ever even thought of, and then some. You can see the influence of the Matrix in places, and of all those late-night creepy flicks, and of everything else from James Bond to Harlequin Romance books.

Still, while I have no doubt that the original script was brilliant, I think it's evident that the director and editor boiled it down to fit in more action.  Consider the following:

1.  In the opening Van Helsing states that he would rather kill Hyde than take him in alive, as the church.  In the next scene he tell the cardinal how horrible it is the be the one who's there when the monsters die.  INCONSISTENT MODIVATION!

2.  First Frankenstein wants to live, then he wants them to kill him to save the human race just a moment later, then he get's upset about going to Rome where he'll be able to live out of Dracula's grasp and they have to shackle him.  INCONSISTENT MODIVATION!

3.  In an interview with Kate Beckinsale she claimed that the brides of Dracula became jealous of her when they realized Dracula wanted to bite her.  By the time he showed signs of wanting to bite her two of the brides were dead and the third showed no sign of even knowing Dracula wanted to bite her.  The only thing they seemed to feel for her was the same playfulness they felt for all humans.  CLEAR-CUT EDIT!

While no discernable challenge, Hugh played his part well.  Kate ( fitted out with a sleek new nose and hood ornaments since last I saw her ) looked great.

  The films biggest weakness was the contrived deus ex machina ending ( perhaps not exactly the right term since the amazing coincidence showed up half way into the picture ).

  Other than that is was fun.

  One thing I did like was the depiction of the wretch.  I have noted some other reviews complaining that he was drawn sympatheticall, was literate, etc, in contravention of their favorite Frankenstien films.  If they had bothered to read the book they would have found he was intelligent, sympathetic, literate ( learned to read from the bible as the film showed ) and only acted as he did because of the rejection he suffered due to his ugliness.

2102158,3,B0002KVUKW,"Van Helsing is a combination between fantasy, action, a soap opera, mystery, and way to much overacting by the characters.

Hugh Jackman gives a sort of serious look at a man that has a face that says, ""I'm going to shoot first, shoot again, shoot some more, and then when everything is dead and full of bullets try to bring them to justice.""

He is sort of like a mid century bounty hunter for all the monsters you hear about in stories that are under your bed or live in creepy castles in strange lands surrounded by woods filled with even stranger creatures. Dont worry, there are plenty of those scenes in here as well.

His first few scenes have him fighting Mr. Hyde, a huge massive ""Man"" that still has enough class to smoke a cigar even though he is half naked and likes to eat people. [It only gets better from there]

Some of the action scenes are alwright, it doesn't tend to stick to huge explosions that blow anything up, thats not till later, but untill then there are still plenty of loud noises and dizzying jumps off of walls and over buildings to keep us entertained.

The Main story sticks to that a generation of vampire hunters have failed to kill the main man himself, Dracula. It is now down to two family members, a brother and a sister [played by Kate Beckinsale, yeah!] They have to kill Dracula before they kill them or none of the deceased family members cant enter heaven.

Van Helsing goes to Transylvania with a monk [technically he continues to remind us he is a monk in training] to help them.

From there the story goes almost nowhere at times, from hunting a werewolf, who turns out to be the brother of the family, to learning of the fact that Dracula has thousands of kids who he wants to set loose and rule the world.

But there is still certain moments that certainly weren't boring, I found myself actually liking several of the comedy relief moments, most of them come from the ""Monk."" And although Hugh Jackman tries his best to bring out Van Helsing to the best of his abilities, I saw that most of the time Hugh only spoke maybe three or four lines before he fired his guns.

And the main reason for me that brought the movie down was the completely unnecessary overacting by Dracula's three wives. I swear, half the time they were screaming after one of them was killed or when their babies were killed, [Sorry I ruined it if you were curious about Dracula's kids] and it was completely annoying.

Now despite the bad things, and there were a fair share of them, this is definately okay to watch everyonce in a while. I seriously couldn't stand the screaming by the female vampires, but maybe some of you can tolerate it better than me.

Whether you can or cant there are lots of great scenes of other action and a showdown between Dracula and a werewolf, and its not the brother of Kate Beckinsales character.",1104710400,3,2855,4.460652591170826
2102159,2,B0002KVUKW,"I saw the film for the first time last night on DVD.

The first annoying thing about it is that it seems to have a hard time deciding whether it wants to be a spoof, e.g. ""Love At First Bite"" or a serious endeavor e.g. ""Dracula"".......in either case they definitely missed their mark.

In the opening sequence we see Dracula finish off Dr. Frankenstein and then later he is seen lamenting, that he really needs Herr Frankenstein to bring his 'babies' to life. I am wondering ""wait a minute did you not ravish him earlier? so why is he not one of your minions at your beck and call?""....that was never addressed.

By the way, I think Jackman made a very interesting Van Helsing......(wasn't the earlier version an old, cranky doctor with a daughter Mena???)...a younger, more vibrant Van Helsing was a vast improvement to me.......

And speaking of Van Helsing, who is he exactly??? The film never adequately identifies him, at least for me.....Early on we learn he was picked up on the steps of the Vatican.......later he speaks of witnessing the destruction at Masada, which leads me to consider he is either a vampire, like Vlad, or an immortal e.g. Duncan MacLeod....so which is it? Later the confusion about his identity is further compounded when we discover, along with Anna and his faithful monk Carl, that he has been bitten by Anna's brother, who is now a monstrous werewolf. So does this mean that he is NOT impervious to fatal wounds? apparently not, so that leaves out the possibility that he is a vampire or an immortal.......and speaking of werewolves, I could not believe how much they hauled out for this film....every nightmare you could conjure up e.g. werewolves, vampires, Frankenstein etc. I was unaware of all of this, i.e. that it was full of 'problems' for Van Helsing when all along I thought it was just 'Vlad' and his 'brides' who Van Helsing would be dealing with. Also, the 'babies' Vlad was wailing about looked more like gargoyles than junior vampires.....In the film, I think it speaks of the 'babies' being a result of crossing vampires and what?

I thought Richard Roxburgh did well in the role of Count Dracula.....I just wish they had been able to make up their mind as to what they wanted him to do with the role. Half of the time, he was doing a schtick routine of Louis Nye and the rest of the time Gary Oldman.

In the final scenes we are left with the impression that the producer envisioned maybe a sequel or two which would be the further adventures of Van Helsing and Carl?

I think not.........",1104624000,2,2539,4.641425389755011
2102160,1,B0002KVUKW,"I first heard about this film over two years ago and became excited at the possibility of some of Universal's classic monsters together in one film doing battle with Van Helsing. I knew it wasn't going to be your typical horror film mainly because the guy behind the two Mummy films from the late 90's was behind this and both were fun movies and interesting re-tellings of the Mummy story. When I first saw the trailer for Van Helsing in early 2004 my almost 2 years of excitment were quickly flushed down the toilet. Now i'm not one to judge a movie based on just the trailer and will give anything a shot but from the  minute and a half trailer I knew this was going to be awful. I waited until the film hit dvd to see it though friends of mine saw it opening weekend and one friend loved it (though he also thought the Resident Evil films were some of the best zombie flicks ever made) and another friend wanted to walk out of the theater. Boy do I wish I took that 2nd friends advice and didn't waste $3.50 on the rental of this piece of garbage. Still I popped the disc in and was going to try and keep an open mind about it. I knew I would hate the CGI (more on that in a moment) but it could be a fun movie like the Mummy films. NOPE! The acting is some of the worst acting that i've ever seen in a film. Hugh Jackman, who was perfectly cast as Wolverine in the X-Men films is at his very worst and his acting is just as great as some of the low budget 80's horror flicks i've seen (and those are actors who are most likely working at McDonalds right now). The dialouge and the cheesy one liners might appeal to 12-14 year old boys into Nu Metal music but I found them to be very laughable and painful to sit through.

As for the CGI. It's hands down some of the worst i've ever seen. The interaction between real human actors and CGI characters are some of the worst i've seen. The CGI is at it's worst during the Dr. Jekell fight and every scene involving Dracula's Brides. It's funny now looking back on Jar Jar Binks and he just seems so real compaired to the CGI in Van Helsing. The CGI in this film is on par with Scooby Doo and Garfield, two of the worst uses of CGI in movie history. It's interesting that back in 1992 when CGI was still being brought to life how amazing the Dinosaurs in Jurrassic Park looked and 12-13 years later it seems like technology has taken a huge step backwards when I see films like Van Helsing. My advice...stick to the Universal classics from the 30's and 40's. The best thing to come from the release of this horrible film was Universal re-releasing their classic monster movies on dvd.",1104537600,12,2634,4.213861386138614
2102161,4,B0002KVUKW,"This is the type of movie you just set back and enjoy. It does not require a lot of thinking, just that you set back and enjoy. Thats it! Its not a drama or a suspence thriller! Pure action with great effects.  Van Helsing is good, the lady he is helping is also, the Fankinstien monster is pretty good and the werewolves are great!

2102162,3,B0002KVUKW,"From writer/director Stephen Sommers, the man who bought us The Mummy and The Mummy Returns, two of the greatest action/adventure movies of the last decade, comes Van Helsing - a tale of a monster slayer who is sent on a quest to Transylvania to rid the world forever of Count Vladislaus Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) and to save the life of Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale), the last member of Transylvania's royal family. To make things more difficult, Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) discovers upon his arrival in Transylvania that he is up against more than just the humble vampire. Accompanying Van Helsing on his mission is Carl (David Wenham), a 19th century version of James Bond's Q who, among other things, exhales some truly great one-liners throughout the course of the film, a highlight of which is ""Why does it smell like wet dog in here?"". I remember this moment induced a huge roar of laughter at the cinema but without seeing the scene that preceded it it's a little hard to appreciate here.

Hugh Jackman puts in a very admirable performance indicating once again why he is one of Australia's greatest exports. David Wenham's performance in what is essentially the role of comedic side-kick is extremely funny and entertaining. It is certainly a diversion from his previous roles and a very interesting addition to his repertoire. While playing the role of Count Dracula, Richard Roxburgh with his accent and wig is barely recognisable. He brings to this much-played character a very entertaining fresh twist - indeed it is the uniqueness of Roxburgh's performance that is particularly notable. Having been played so many times before it is becoming inherently difficult to bring something new to the character which Roxburgh has succeeded in doing. Kate Beckinsale very near revives her role from her previous film Underworld, once again trying to vanquish, among other things, werewolves.

As you might well have guessed this is a film that relies heavily on the use of special effects and while at times they are spectacular (the horses jumping the ravine is certainly a highlight), this once again proves that effects don't make a film - writing does. While Sommer's intentions were good, if not a little ambitious, the film is a tad clunky at times and doesn't quite deliver in the writing department. That's not to say it a terrible film - nothing could be further from the truth, as it is certainly a worthy addition to the action/adventure genre. However, given my fondness for the two Mummy films it is inevitable that comparisons be made and without being too over-critical Van Helsing simply doesn't compete with either of them. Despite its short-falls Van Helsing is still a fun couple of hours and is well worth a watch.",1104192000,3,2743,4.947939262472885
2102163,1,B0002KVUKW,"I will admit right off the bat that I didn't make it through the first half hour. Normally, I will not even bother to write a review if I see so little of a movie. However, with this movie, I was so repulsed by the set up that I feel a civic duty to warn everyone off this joke.

Van Helsing works for the Vatican and is off to help out a family of Transylvanian vampire killers. Had it been left at that, it would have probably worked. Even with the ridiculous Q type friar that comes up with all of these gadgets in the most blasphemous 007 ""satire"" ever, it might have been one of those charming action-adventure-comedy type movies like ""The Mummy"".

But no, all the movie monsters are in this one. Frankenstein's monster, Dracula, Wolfman, and even Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde make an appearance.

Maybe I've missed this grand ""point"" that these other reviews seem to want to insist makes this movie more than the showing off of special effects. Maybe I am too much of a purist to appreciate these monsters crossing over from their stories into a common story line, like the old ""Godzilla vs. King Kong"" type movies that stank, too. I couldn't get past that, and don't feel that the special effects are worth sitting through something so downright stupid! Why is it that when people are making movies nowadays, that they sacrifice storyline for special effects and vice versa. You can have both!

If you want overkill on movie monsters, take a trip to California or Florida and go to Universal Studios. The cheesiness is not going to be worse than this movie, which on my Cheese Scale, rates as Moldy American Cheese That Is Stuck To the Cellophane. If you want a real monster movie, and you want it to be injected with some humor, get ""Shaun of the Dead"". If you want straight up horror, then avoid this like its contagious.",1104105600,8,1826,4.490963855421687

Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman)has no memory, yet he knows he has a destiny that will answer all his questions. We find him working for the Vatican; the man they use to destroy evil throughout the world. Not a job that is easy, but one he seems equipted for.  I loved the begininning when he faces,Mr. Hyde and wins. That was a great 'catcher' of your attention right from the start.

Now, he must fight Dracula,who has been helping Dr. Frankenstein create life, but Dracula had his own reasons for being so 'kind,' and they are quite chilling.

  Van Helsing also has to save the souls of a family that has been fighting Dracula for centuries. We meet Anna, she is a lovely women and now the last of that family to be alive, she must win the battle against Dracula so her family may find eternal peace and Van Helsing is directed to help her. My favorite character is Carl, a Friar who travels with Van Helsing and  comes up with all the needed equiptment Van Helsing uses to conquer evil. His humor brings a freshness to this movie that is almost like the icing on a cake. Nice touch!

I enjoyed this movie, it was quite entertaining and moved along quickly.  The acting was great and the special effects were very good.  Recommended.",1104105600,2,1306,4.453781512605042

The story is clever and so ""campish."" For example, Anna (Kate Beckinsale), the heroine of the film, never has mussed hair or disheveled clothing, and her makeup is always fresh.  Plus, she wears one basic outfit during the whole film and it is never tattered or torn even though she is slapped repeatedly by the same vampire, falls off several edifices, etc.

The special effects are outstanding.  There's never a dull moment and the ending, unlike most of the story, is not predictable.  It's a fantasy adventure sure to be loved forever by fans of the ""horror"" genre.",1104019200,3,736,4.553030303030303

It isn't so much that this is a bad story as it is burdened with so much noise, hyperkinetic special effects, and the kitchen sink.  I mean everything about all monster movies is thrown into this thing including Q from the James Bond series.

But my main gripe is that human beings cannot fall hundreds of feet and be just fine.  I mean, if you have super heroes and monsters and all that, the real humans have to stay limited to real human powers to make the monsters exceptional.  If you make the people nearly as exceptional as the monsters you diminish the whole movie.

Anyway, it was fun in the way a 2nd rate roller-coaster ride is fun.  You know you aren't really getting to the edge of things, but if you turn off your brain, you can enjoy the ride.",1103932800,5,854,4.3

Frankly, the only good points were the vampires - campy, yes, but wonderfully so.  Particularly the opening sequence, where Dracula's deceptively attractive face is overlaid by flashes of a horrifying monster, and it becomes very clear that this vampire has none of the sweet, cuddly qualities so common in many modern vampire depictions - he is utterly evil.

2102183,5,B0002KVUKW,"Heck, VAN HELSING is lots of fun and that's what makes this movie so entertaining for me.  Sure, it's overbrimming with special effects, but they're so cool and well done, I never tired of them, even a few of which were a little over the top.  Director Stephen Sommers who brought us the delightfully campy MUMMY series gives us a riproaring, action packed adventure story, and even though it's camp and humor is not quite as on target as in the Mummy movies, there is still plenty of tongue in cheek humor to soften the monstrous savagery.

Hugh Jackman (who would make a good James Bond) stars as the enigmatic Van Helsing, not your typical Peter Cushing Van Helsing, but a strange man who has a clouded past.  Jackman does well in the role, infusing the requisite macho and spiritual qualities.  David Wenham as Carl is wonderful in his low-key, restrained performance.  Wenham, who also appeared in LORD OF THE RINGS, is a capable supporting actor and was fun to watch.  Kate Beckinsale is certainly beautiful, but I've never been overly impressed with her acting abilities, but she makes a nice heroine.  Richard Roxburgh as Dracula is a little too effeminate at times, but he is certainly a snarly vampire.  Kevin J. O'Connor behind great make-up plays Igor with a humorous flair.  Shuler Hensley as the Frankenstein monster overcomes his overwrought makeup to portray the man-made ""monster"" who wants to be accepted.

Alan Silvestri's score is appropriately melodramatic and the visuals, cinematography and art direction are Oscar worthy, as are the effects.

Critics generally hated this movie, Newsweek's David Ansen placed it in his ten most disappointing movies of the year.  I found it highly entertaining and that's what movie making is supposed to be.",1103155200,4,1765,4.942372881355932

The specail effects I have to say were very rich and a great job was done on this. This is a movie to just kick back and enjoy. Classic monsters but with a new twist.

The settings for the movie were also extreamly neat, not wanting to give anything away to anyone who has not seen Van Helsing, but one of My favorite parts in the movie was when Van Helsing and His companion Fryer travel to a remote snow laden village deep in the mountains of Transylvania and battle 3 female vampires who change between human to demon fighting them with a cross bow that fires like a machine gun.

While over the top with James Bond type wepons back supposedly a few centuries ago, the effects were superb and again, just an awsome good fun movie to watch.

Forget that the name implies that this has anything to do with the classic Van Helsing/Dracula conflict.  If you're looking for anything related to the classic tail then you should probably steer clear of this movie.  Think more along the lines of 007.  That's right.  There's Van Helsing (aka 007) working for an organization out to save the world from ghouls and ghosts complete with M and Q equivalents and lots of ""state of the art"" equipment.  The movie is not so much great for its subject matter or its acting.  The movie is great for its special effects.

Some of the criticisms are that they try and cram too many beasties in the film.  After all you get werewolves, Dr. Jeckle & Mr. Hyde, Frankenstein's monster, and of course Dracula and his three wives.  Yes, the plot is thin trying to work all of these characters in, but like I said, it's a fun movie that a showcase for the FX folks.  Enjoy it for what it is.",1102896000,4,946,4.410404624277457
2102186,3,B0002KVUKW,"This is an action-packed film that crosses a number of genres: horror, comedy, and adventure. It has a stellar cast and a fairly interesting story line. It also has some stupendous special effects but therein lies the rub. The director has not learned that less is often more. Some of the special effects are spectacular and some are buffoonish/cartoonish and end up being jarring, rather than enhancing, to the film.

Hugh Jackman is excellent as Van Helsing, the mysterious monster killer who is subsidized by the Catholic Church, as the Vatican operates  a secret laboratory run by clergymen who perfect sophisticated weaponry for Van Helsing's fight against evil. In 1887, Van Helsing is sent by the Vatican to assist the noble Valerious family of Transylvania in getting rid of the pesky Count Vladislaus Dracula, drolly played by Richard Roxburgh. By the time Van Helsing arrives, accompanied by his trusty sidekick, a friar named Carl (David Wenham), the only member of this vampire fighting family who is left alive is the athletic and lovely Anna Valerious, played with single-minded dedication by the  wasp-waisted, newly Barbie breasted Kate Beckinsale.

There, they all end up battling the brides of Dracula, a werewolf, and Count Dracula himself, with a little assist from Frankenstein. Let the games begin! The flying brides of Dracula are my favorite special effects, but even there the production cannot refrain from being unsubtle, which is too bad. There are some scenes that are spectacular, such as the battle between the werewolf and Anna and her brother, Velkan (Will Kemp), which takes place before the arrival of Van Helsing. Those special effects are terrific, as are those involving the brides of Dracula upon Van Helsing's arrival in Transylvania and the subsequent battle between them.

The film also manages to blend a certain amount of humor and camp, making it quite funny, at times, and somewhat tongue-in-cheek. As for the romance between Van Helsing and Anna, I am sorry to report that there is little, if any, chemistry between Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale. Moreover, the film is consistently uneven. While the opening black and white scene in which the towns people, carrying torches,  converge upon Count Dracula's castle is very atmospheric, its effect is vitiated by the ludicrous scene immediately following in which Van Helsing  battles Mr. Hyde (of Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde fame). Unfortunately, Mr. Hyde resembles nothing more than a video game monster similar to the Hulk, minus the green hue.

Despite some of the issues with the film, it is definitely an entertaining, action-packed film that is worth a rental.",1102809600,2,2661,5.12933025404157

I'd get this one for the extra's,(I'd love to see how they did all of that stuff),not the movie itself.

These surviving members will be doomed to extinction unless Dracula is destroyed before the last family member dies.  So Van Helsing and is trusty sidekick Carl (David Wenham) set off to face Dracula with an arsenal of weapons to aid them, including a cool repeating crossbow.

One in Transylvania, Van Helsing and Carl meet Anna Valerious, played by Kate Beckinsale. It is her family that has been trying to destroy Dracula for so long.  Now, the three must band together to kill Dracula before it is too late for Anna.

This is an excellent movie, and the special effects are some of the best that I've ever seen before.  The beginning of the movie was my favorite part.  The black and white scenes of the attack on Castle Frankenstein reminded me of the Frankenstein movies from the 1930s with Boris Karloff.  Even the scene in which the townspeople burn down the windmill with Dr. Frankenstein and his monster trapped inside is carefully reproduced from the original film.  The monsters in the movie are really scary as well, especially the werewolf which attacks Anna's brother.  Dracula's ""wives"" flying and attacking the townsfolk while Van Helsing shoots at them with his crossbow is exciting to watch, as well.

I highly recommend this movie.  Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsale, and David Wenham give excellent performances, but Richard Roxburgh's portrayal as Dracula is the best performance of the movie.

The characters hardly described themselves and the romance between Jackman and Beckingsale was way too artifical. It seemed like more of an infautuation then actual love. I will admit I did like Dracula's brides as white- winged creatures, that was a good idea, and Dracula's children actually was somewhat a good idea as well, but aside from that I saw no other compliments for this movie. I was indeed expecting much more from the movie, especially from the actors themselves. I think the main problem was they smashed all these legends into one and exerted all their energy on modernizing the creatures and they completley forgot about the entire rest of the world revolving around the creatures.

I even wish I'd caught it at the theater (the effects and landscapes are something to behold).

Hugh Jackman has yet to convert me from a bystander to a fan, but this movie is one of his better performances. The three brides of Dracula are excellent eye-candy. The Monster and Mr. Hyde are two of the film's highlights.

Kate Beckinsale has never impressed me--either as an actress or as a beauty (does she ever speak in more than a whisper in real life?), yet she pulls off a fun turn of bad horror-flick acting as a transylvanian princess/monster-slaying-broad. She makes a decent foil to Jackman.

One could dismiss the attractions of this film as being the celluloid equivalent of watching ladies mudwrestle. The movie does hold that attraction. But in its cheap, tawdry, yet eye-popping way, this movie attains a perfection of its form (not mudwrestling, but as an ill-concieved, underwritten monster flick).

Jackman and Richard Roxburgh lend the film if not gravitas, then a certain pathos.

2102212,4,B0002KVUKW,"Awhile back when the immeasurable amount of hype floated about the airways of the radio and Television about Van Helsing and its spiffy 3D (or more affectionally named CGI) animated scenes and how practically every legendary non-scary monsters (excluding the Mummy); Dracula, The wolfman [wearwolf], Frankenstein, and Dracula's brides was going to be in this movie, I scratched my head in confusion wondering how exactly they were gonna pull this off. So after the movie came out, everyone was bellowing with all their might about how ""horrible"" Van Helsing was, quoting ""Not even Hugh Jackman could save this movie."" Sad to say, I almost believed them until my mother rented the movie anyway.

I watched the movie with my youngest brother and I enjoyed it immensely! There was of course the occasional corny dialogue supplied by Hugh Jackman's character Gabrielle (or Van Helsing) and his Q-ish sidekick, Carl (David Wenham, ""Lord of the rings: The Return of the King""), but all in all this movie was absolutely fun to watch. The plot is original as far as scary movies goes: After Van Helsing fails an assignment, on bringing back Dr. Jeckyle(?)/Hyde back to his secret organization, he and his fryer side sick is sent to Realm of Transylvania where the feared Count Dracula lives to protect the last two survivors of a  Transylvanian bloodline that swore to kill Dracula, however, he hits a snag when he meets Transylvanian princess herself, Anna Valerious (Kate Bekensale, ""Underworld"") who almost killed by Dracula's brides when they make an unscheduled appearance. Mr. Van Helsing comes across more trouble when he finds out that the werewolf that had been lurking about the small run-down village he and Carl traveled to is Anna's brother. While he is determined to kill the creature she continuously puts a damper in his plans. Van Helsing only find his problems escalating when he discovers that Dracula is using the wolfman to bring creatures possibly far more worse in the bitting department to life, and that's where Frankenstein comes in.

Like all movies this one had its flaws, the accents in this movie were horrible but easy to laugh at it; if Hugh Jackman was supposed to have a British accent he failed miserably in that department. Kate Bekensale and Richard Roxburgh's (along with the brides) transylvanian accents were the strangest ones I've heard since ""Count"" Dracula's on Sesame Street (vone, two, three, haha!).

The weapons in the movie were a bit over the top but were plausible for the movie's long shaggy haired hero. On the positive side, the special affects in the movie were done nicely, I loved the scenes concerning the count's brides in their vampiric forms scooping people up off the ground in all their CGI glory, the action in Van Helsing is nonstop and downright hard not to find enjoyable, plus the ending was quite a refreshing one, a nice change. For all those who like monster movies (scary or not) and a good action flick this movie is the one to buy. ----- [a 4 out of 5]",1102204800,3,3018,4.87719298245614
2102213,3,B0002KVUKW,"There are things about this movie that I really liked, and things that I really hated.  First let me say that when I first heard the movie was being directed by Stephen Sommers, I was really excited.  The 1999 Universal movie ""The Mummy"" was absolutely fantastic.  It stayed true to the original classic, but added in awesome special effects and a lot of humor.  I think that was a truly epic monster movie, it's sequel not falling far behind in terms of greatness.

Anyhow, now we come to ""Van Helsing"".  When the official website for the movie opened, I couldn't have been more pleased.  The shadowy pictures of each of the 3 monsters had me jumping out of my seat, they looked so awesome.  Being a huge fan of the classic Universal Monster movies, I was happy someone had finally decided to do a decent remake of the three monsters featured in this film.  Most of the 90's versions of Frankenstein, Dracula, and The Wolf Man (with the exception of ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", which was excellent) were really lacking.  Then finally when the trailer was released for Van Helsing, it was looking better than ever.

And after many months of waiting, I finally sat down in a theater to watch Van Helsing.  I was greatly disappointed.  First of all, this movie did not stay true to the original movies at all.  It actually rewrote the birth of Frankenstein.  Sure, many of the same elements existed (the castle, an angry mob, the windmill, etc.), but the story was just wrong.  Dracula was never meant to be present at the Frankensteins' Monster's birth, and Dr. Frankenstein was meant to be a mad scientist, not some symbol of good.

Next we come to Van Helsing himself.  Who exactly is the person portrayed in the movie?  He's obviously not Abraham Van Helsing, as portrayed in Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"", but some descendant.  And why does he have to be working for the church, which only comes into play for about five minutes of the movie anyhow?  And quite frankly I don't see why Mr. Hyde had to be stuck in the movie either.  The Mr. Hyde in this movie was a complete rip off of the one in ""The League of Extraordinary Gentleman"".  I personally, would have chosen a different monster, maybe the Gill Man or something more common in the classic Universal realm.  Anyway, I didn't particularly like Hugh Jackman as the hero either.  Don't get me wrong, Hugh Jackman is an awesome actor, but he's already Wolverine in ""X-Men"", and seeing as this movie is obviously some type of superhero story, I think they should have went with someone less popular.  And the whole ""right hand of God"" theme was really lame.

Next we come to The Wolf Man (my favorite monster).  First, I'm glad someone was finally able to make a decent werewolf movie, as the past few years have not seen many, but I do have some complaints.  I think the ""first"" werewolf to appear in the movie, the one to bite Velkan, was the best one featured.  The gray fur, and the overly large fangs looked magnificent.  And the way the creature moved was great.  But the Velkan werewolf wasn't as good, in my opinion.  It looks too much like a puppy, not nearly as feirce as the first werewolf.  Yeah, I know, it's one of the good guys who has turned into the wolf, but still it could be a little meaner.  I didn't care for the transformation sequence either.  The idea of a man tearing off his skin and revealing a wolf underneath is awesome, but its was carried out too PG-13 friendly in the movie.  You need to show the guy actually tearing his flesh away, not blend the shedding skin with the metamorphosis.  And I don't really understand the fact that when the werewolf turns back into Velkan, it also tears its skin off.  The whole idea kind of contradicts itself.  And finally, and I don't want to give away too much, but the ""final"" werewolf in the film was mean looking too, but it's fur was too dark, and it made the creature hard to make out.  Not to mention the monster's face resembles that of a black lab.

Finally we come to Dracula.  I don't think the character was carried out too well, honestly.  Dracula is meant to be evil and at the same time partially compassionate for his love, not funny.  It's good to have humor, but did Imhotep make jokes in ""The Mummy""?  And I also didn't care too much for the fact that Van Helsing encountered Dracula before, and the whole ""offspring"" idea was a cheaply thought out excuse to bring the monsters together.

One last comment, what was the point of that Transylvanian guy with the top hat?  He had really lame jokes, and basically no purpose to the plot whatsoever.  I was glad to see him taken out by Velkan.  On the other hand, I think Kevin J. O'Connor added a great deal to the movie as ""Igor"", just as he did to ""The Mummy"".  He would have been satisfactory as the film's comic relief, but for some reason they had to make Dracula ""funny"", and add that goofy Carl guy for additional humor (a waste.)

So finally, the special effects were excellent, and overall the movie is very entertaining, but I just think too much money was wasted on the project.  If they wanted to remake these monsters so bad, they should have done each one seperately, and if they wanted to make a movie with these three monsters so bad, they should have done it a little more seriously, and stayed true to the original stories.  Van Helsing is basically just a seriously overproduced mix between ""Young Frankenstein"" and ""Howling VI"".",1102118400,2,5432,4.52258726899384
2102214,1,B0002KVUKW,"If you strapped a camcorder to a lame goat, then let it loose in a disused warehouse for 132 minutes, you'd more than likely end up with a better film than Van Helslung.",1102118400,3,169,4.151515151515151
2102215,2,B0002KVUKW,"This is one of the few reviews that needs to begin with a discussion of the climax. Why? I still want to know how two of the three key pieces that composed the climax occurred. Since it's inappropriate to discuss the specifics of any climax in a review, I'll respect that. But I have to say: not only do I not really understand how it happened, I thought it was very poorly constructed. In addition to that, the dnouement was fairly pedantic and, at best, without real feeling.

OK. So much with the conclusion - the climax and the denouement. The concept for this film - a monster hunter with inexplicable longevity who works for an underground ""sect"" of the Catholic Church - isn't a bad one. European monsters have long held our attention: vampires, Dracula, the werewolf, Frankenstein, and even Mr. Hyde. The main problem with the attempt to bring all of this together is that the writers didn't truly understand the nature of the monsters, or the fundamental arguments and/or nature of good and evil. What we saw in that regard was mostly sophomoric.

Question #1 that I had: Why was Mr. Hyde in this movie? He seemed to serve only as a prelude to bring Van Helsing to the Church. Things should only exist in a film or book (any medium) if they are integral to the structure - not if they are merely a vehicle. This was a vehicle. There was also a problem with Mr. Hyde: he was larger than The Hulk. And yet, with such incredible strength, Van Helsing not only subdues him, but kills him. Amazing? No. Dumb.

Question #2: Humans in this film were capable of sustaining mind numbing damage. Van Helsing himself should have been dead during his first monster encounter with Mr. Hyde. Van Helsing was hit hard - HARD - multiple times, and didn't appear to sustain even a broken bone.

Since Van Helsing had somewhat immortal qualities (if the reason for his longevity was touched upon, I missed it), I could understand some of that. But what about the Valerios family? Anna sustained damage throughout the film that would have killed a herd of elephants, and had this rather remarkable ability to walk up walls and do somersaults off of them. What was that about? Is this strength bestowed upon her through some mysticism of the Catholic Church? Who knows? We sure don't. That means it isn't credible.

Question #3: If Dracula wanted Anna dead so badly, and his three ""brides"" proved themselves entirely incapable of such a feat after repeated failures, why didn't he do it himself? This is a major problem in many fantasy, horror, thriller, or suspense films (or books for that matter). Instead of trying to work out a reason for why the Dracula figure doesn't take matters into his own hands (which would require too much creativity, apparently), they simply ignore it. But think about it. You're Dracula. You want this girl dead. Your brides can not accommodate your wishes. Would *you* allow them to fail, time and again, or would you just walk into the village and be done with her once and for all? Remember, the longer she remains alive, the worse your chances for survival are.

Question #4: I have never seen a movie where all of the main characters (even a clumsy Frankenstein monster) had such remarkable acrobatic and Tarzan-like vine swinging skills. If anyone was entertained by feat after feat after feat of impossible gymnastic extravaganza, well, I don't mean to insult anyone, but come on. It's absurd. Sure, at some point you have to allow for the suspension of disbelief. But as John Gardner said (and this is a rough paraphrase): ""Where Folly leads, Judgment must follow. To dumb it down, things need to make sense. Perhaps if these characters had lived in the 21st century, they would have belonged to a circus. But they didn't, and without all of that training, their feats were *impossible*.

Was there anything good about the film? Well, the special effects were good, with the exception of all of the Tarzan nonsense. The swinging here and there, and even some of the flying, appeared absurd at times, and obviously CGI created. When we have seen such remarkable special effects in recent years, specifically with the Lord of the Rings films, these flaws are quite glaring.

I was saddened when I looked at the director's credentials. His first film of note was The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, starring then child prodigy Elijah Wood. That was a good movie. Since then, he's decided to take the amusement park route. Deep Rising (a squid attacking a ship?) The Mummy, the Mummy Returns, and the introduction of the Scorpion King? All of them, while perhaps stylish and shot well, were poorly written and offered very little climactic satisfaction. In other words, cotton candy.

First, the movie had a lot of energy. Second, Hugh Jackman as Van Helsing was very good.  The special effects were good. The sets were terrific. I liked the Frankenstein monster. He was the only intelligent character in the movie.

On the minus side, Dracula was not very scary. The plot was very stupid, but then it wasn't directed toward adults, I suppose. Of course, my kids would have torn the movie apart for its internal inconsistencies. I grew up watching monster movies so I am more forgiving. The special effects tended to defy physics and logic at every conceivable opportunity. There was a lot of swinging from cables and ropes for impossible distances. The movie redefined the vampire legend without explaining why. For example, silver stakes were substituted for wooden stakes, I think. Vampires can sexually reproduce, somehow, I think. It wasn't really clear to me what was going on. There are some plot points that absolutely insulted my intelligence or the intelligence of the vampires.

2102223,4,B0002KVUKW,"All said and done, this film is a tremendous amount of fun.  Director Stephen Sommers takes the stuff of our favorite fictional monsters and blends them together to create a highly imaginative reconstruction of the story of Dracula.  Resemblances to Bram Stoker's original tale are entirely accidental.  Instead we find Dracula  (Richard Roxburgh) using with Dr. Frankenstein (Samuel West) to serve some dark and nefarious purpose.  Not very far in the background is a werewolf (Will Kemp) who carries part of the answer to the puzzle - when he isn't trying to chew a hole in Gabriel Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman).

Kate Beckinsale plays Anna Valerious, the last living member of her family, who have been dedicated to exterminating Dracula for some 400 years.  Thanks to an oath of her forefathers, the Valerious line is condemned to purgatory as long as Dracula wanders the night.  Concerned that this curse is about to become permanent, a secret order of the Catholic Church sends in their best occult assassin - Van Helsing - aided reluctantly by Friar Carl (David Wenham), who plays the mad inventor to Van Helsing's athletic efforts.  Gabriel shows up to help Anna, is promptly rebuffed by the woman, whose mind is definitely her own.  But the action goes ballistic, and no one gets time to be banished or stomp off.

And of action, special effects, stunts. and computer graphics there is a great muchness.  Most of which looks just believable enough to keep the audience staring open mouthed at the screen.  An outstanding job is done with Dracula's wives (Elena Anaya, Silvia Colloca, and Josie Maran) and the Frankenstein monster (Shuler Hensley).  So good that these characters very nearly steal the entire show.  Sets are equally carefully crafted, with a marvelous medieval town and two whole gothic castles.  The visual impression of the film often completely overwhelms the story.

The acting is bright, with a slightly crude, sarcastic style of interplay between the characters. The overall touch is comedic, despite the inevitable sour grapes of the ending.  Don't look for greatness here.  The point is to create an exciting, fun experience, not to recreate the dark and brooding spirit behind the originals.

There are a few laughs, a lot of action, monsters galore and innumerable special effects. All of this comes together to make a James Bond style action flick as opposed to a monster or horror movie.

How is it like Frankenstein's monster?  They are both monstrosities cobbled together from the bits and pieces of better things.  As you can no doubt can tell, I was not very happy with this movie.

In Van Helsing, the title character is transformed from the cerebral vampire hunter of the novel Dracula into a standard action hero who hunts monsters throughout Europe.  The structure of the film is actually similar to a James Bond movie:  we start with a brief action-filled prologue pitting Van Helsing against Mr. Hyde (who is the same type of Hulk-like monstrosity that was seen last seen in the similarly mediocre League of Extraordinary Gentlemen).  Then Van Helsing is given his mission and given neat weapons from a ""Q""-like character.  Finally, we have the main story pitting Van Helsing against the rather standard villain - Dracula - who wants to take over the world and has a whole bunch of monstrous sidekicks.  Frankenstein and the Wolf Man also fit into this plot.

The movie fails on a number of levels, most significantly from its poor writing.  Sometimes the story is dumb, sometimes it's merely silly, but it's never very interesting.  The acting is nothing to speak of either; Hugh Jackman can play a decent hero (as shown in the X-Men movies), but here he is actually rather boring.  Kate Beckinsdale looks nice, but is also rather dull.

Most importantly, however, is that Van Helsing fails to capture any of the magic of the original Universal monster movies to which it owes so much.  The original movies - released in the 1930s and 1940s - may not all be great (though they are all better than this movie), but at their best, they at least have a nice level of creepiness, even if they can't scare a modern audience.  Van Helsing has none of this eerie quality and is merely an action movie with slightly off-beat villains.

If you feel the urge to watch this movie, fight it.  Watch one of the original movies instead; I particularly recommend Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein.  This movie should be avoided as it will almost certainly disappoint.",1100822400,122,2250,4.73521850899743

2102242,2,B0002KVUKW,"In the 1940s Universal Studios attempted to re-energize horror films at the box office by churning out movies that crammed as many famous monsters into the plot line as possible.  The result was usually more notable for being silly than effective, and in spite of its highly touted CGI effects VAN HELSING is sillier still.

Suggested by the vampire hunter of Bram Stoker's novel DRACULA, the film presents a young and sexy Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) who is in the employ of a secret sect of the Roman Catholic Church run along James Bond lines.  After a little run in with Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in Paris, Van Helsing is sent to Transylvannia along with a trusty Friar as sidekick.  There they promptly meet a sexy vampire hunting gypsy princess, and the three promptly encounter the Wolf Man, the Frankestein Monster, Dracula, Dracula's Brides, and even Dracula's Babies.  Who would have thunk it?

The CGI effects are impressive and the occasional hommages to the original Universal Studio horror films of the 1930s and 1940s are occasionally amusing--but the whole thing very quickly collapses into a lot of visual and audio noise, and there isn't much to hold it together.  After about half an hour I began to use the fast forward button on my remote a lot.  It's a case of the director, actors, and special effects people having more fun than the audience.

The transfer is quite good, although to my eye CGI effects do not work as well on the home screen as they do on the big screen.  There are also a handful of bonuses, none of which are greatly interesting or particularly well done.  Final take: this a movie that seems to be made by and for a bunch of hyperactive fourteen year old boys without a whole lot of imagination.

Van Helsing starts out in castle Frankenstein where Dr. Victor Frankenstein is putting the finishing touches on his creature.  Count Dracula then enters the scene and tells Victor that it is his time to control the creature, so his offspring can live.

Victor then proceeds to tell Dracula that he cannot allow the creature to be used for such an evil purpose

The creature proceeds to break out of the restraints on the operating table and hide in the laboratory

Dracula, ticked at Victor for having another agenda, bites him and drinks his blood

The creature is devastated that his creator is gone and throws what looks like an Iron Maiden towards Dracula and sends him into the fire place

The creature then carries Dr. Frankenstien's body out of the castle and to a deserted wind mill

This is all filmed in B/W

A year later takes the viewers to Paris (and colour filming)

where Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde is terrorising the area

Van Helsing (Jackman)

is on the trail of Jekyll/Hyde and traces him to the top of the Notre Dame Cathredal

We then find out that Hugh Jackman is as much of a smart aleck in this movie as he was in the two 'X-Men' movies.

2102266,3,B0002KVUKW,"An entertaining fast-paced good-looking but shallow horror/action movie with predictable flaws.  Translation:  100 m.p.h. eye candy.  Too many monsters (Dracula, Dracula's Brides, Dracula's offspring, Frankenstein, Werewolves, Mr. Hyde, good grief) stuffed into this movie diluted the impact of each.  Weak dialogue.  Weak interlacing of monster plots.  No character development.  But non-stop action, for those of you who likey!  I freely admit that, being a horror fan, I was highly entertained.  Not scared, but definitely entertained.  Hence the three star rating.

Other reviewers have complained about the amount of special effects and the computer-generated monsters, but I was entertained by all the effects, the Brides in particular, and felt the movie as a whole was visually very stylish and beautiful.  But logic says that fewer special effects and action sequences would have made room for some components that were sorely lacking (already mentioned above).

The parallels between the Van Helsing character in this movie and the Wolverine character in X-Men, both played by Jackman, were a little odd.  Both movies:  Mysterious hero figure who can't remember his past fights evil under the direction of a clandestine group. And both have the wolf factor!  hmmmm.  But I can hardly complain about the derivative aspects when I can gaze at Jackman's lovely long locks.  If you ladies thought Jackman was a hottie in X-Men, wait til ya see Van Helsing.  Unfortunately, I felt the male and female leads in Van Helsing had no chemistry.  And, oh, for you guys:  whats-her-name is a hottie too.

The humour that made Stephen Sommer's other movie ""The Mummy"" delightful is completely absent here.  Too bad.  And the Dracula character wasn't quite creepy enough, wasn't quite other-worldly and detached enough for my taste.  Van Helsing's Dracula reminded me more of a James Bond villian, a megalomaniac with dreams of world domination through this offspring.  Sure, he can turn into into a bat-demon, but I got the distinct impression that he preferred his man-form.  One of the movie's characters is clearly stolen from the James Bond films, but frankly, little in this movie is original, so who cares?  As for the acting in general... well, it's an action movie, so let me congratulate the actors on the wire-work and stunts.  Very well done!",1100044800,,2350,5.208556149732621
2102267,5,B0002KVUKW,"This grand monster hunt comes to life as Van Helsing and pays tribute to all the truly great classic monsters while remaining visually interesting enough for all of today's special effects enthusiasts.

The movie begins in a creepy castle, filmed in black and white, and we meet Dr. Frankenstein, his Monster, Dracula and Igor as all the fun begins. Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) is busy in Paris battling a nasty but large Mr. Hyde atop Notre Dame Cathedral. Meanwhile across Europe, and in a little country called Transylvania, a brave and daring heroine (Kate Beckinsale) has hopes of saving her brother from life as a Wolfman. All of the greats are represented here (minus the Mummy) and the story is both interesting and classically told.

Stephen Sommers has made a visually beautiful and classic monster film paying fantastic tribute to all those who came before him. The special effects are quite good and you will find yourself transported into a really good video game that allows one to discover something different every time this film is seen. Jackman is the perfect hero as the title character being handsome, strong and silly all at the same time. Kate Beckinsale brings the typical frail heroine into a new light as the strong and feisty Princess Anna. The main nemesis is Dracula, played humorously by Richard Roxburgh. Dracula's brides are sexy, evil and quite vicious. Will Kemp plays the Wolfman and looks great out of costume! Igor (Kevin J. O'Connor) comes to life with the perfect blend of humor and snide remarks but sadly no flies and finally the Frankenstein Monster (Shuler Hensley) finally has a voice and uses it well. Altogether the cast in this film is highly entertaining and the storyline quite interesting. Of course the special effects in this film often override true human talent but they are well worth your time.

This film is fun, entirely entertaining and beautiful to watch unfold while at the same time being a wonderful tribute to all of the classic monsters. A great film for the family that doesn't take monsters (and fighting them) too literally. Sommers has mastered the ability to take traditional monster movies and spin them into a new form while paying proper tribute to the original. I suspect Van Helsing will emerge as the new hero of modern monster films and foresee a sequel ready to be bolted into life.",1099958400,3,2358,4.875311720698255

Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale were wonderful throughout and the ending was surprisingly sad. And the friar sidekick was also well played by Welham.

The computer animation in this movie was done remarkably well and the many transformations in the movie are done with silky smoothness. And the many beautiful scenes and backgrounds of landscapes captures you into thinking you are really in Eastern Europe.

Most of the accents in this movie are a bit annoying and over the top however. And Dracula looked a bit too 'pretty.' Other than that i cant think of anything bad about the movie.

The only good part was the end battle between VH and Dracula. The soundtrack is pretty good though, but the movie actually gave me a headache, just like Team America did.

The mistake was trying to fit 3hrs of info into what I think was just under 2, then instead of condensing the script to give you the most story, the script was condensed to allow for the most visually lush and lavish scenes, and it never let up. Add to that the time inconsistencies (was night in a frame, woman steps forward, shot now from behind and it's daylight) to downright annoying acting (give me break on the friar).",1099958400,,756,4.518248175182482

The action sequences are breathtaking, and those are the best things about the movie. The story, sad to say, borrows everything from old horror stories like ""Dracula,"" ""Frankenstein,"" ""The Wolf Man,"" and ""Jekyll and Hyde."" But the plotline is more similar to the many James Bond adventures, especially the fact that Van Helsing (a ""Bond-ish"" performance by Hugh Jackman) works for a secret agency run by the Vatican assigned to take out monsters, complete with a Q-like Monk named Carl (David Wenham of ""Lord of the Rings"" fame) and an M-like Cardinal. The cast do what they can in the film, with Kate Beckinsale (be she ever so fine) giving the film's best performance. The story is unoriginal, but when the action sequences occur, ""Van Helsing"" is one wild ride!

So when I heard about Van Helsing I was pretty excited. I did enjoy the Mummy movies for what they were, that is I enjoyed the Indiana Jones aspect of the films, and when I found out Sommers was in charge of Van Helsing I expected more of the same. There were elements to Van Helsing that I really liked. The Van Helsing character resembled a turn of the century James Bond who instead of tackling SPECTRE, hunted down evil. The Wolfman scenes of Van Helsing packed the biggest punch of the movie, which may have been one of the bigger problems with the film overall, seeing as how the Wolfman was a secondary character. Mr. Hyde's cameo was fun, as were Dracula's brides. But I am not a big fan of CGI special effects. I don't see the difference between CGI and a guy in a rubber suit or make-up. Sure you might see the zipper on the rubber suit, but no matter how convincing the CGI is, you can't help but notice that the monster is basically a cartoon. The biggest downfall for Van Helsing to me was Dracula and Frankenstein though. After years of associating Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff with the roles, Dracula in the film came off as a pretty weak character, one without much menace. The Frankenstein monster seemed almost helpless in the film, and came off as whiny. This movie reminded me a good deal of Sean Connery's ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"". The idea looks good on paper, but for some reason just doesn't click. This movie is just some harmless fun, entertaining while on, but forgotten by the time the end credits finish rolling.

2102300,3,B0002KVUKW,"""Van Hesling"" is yet another movie based on a series of comic books. I can comment only on the movie as a movie, as I am unfamiliar with the series. I can say that, by its look, the film is faithful to its comic book origins.

As a movie, ""Van Helsing"" is a handsome product, which like director Stephen Sommer's other big hits, ""The Mummy"" and ""The Mummy Returns"", suffers from too much reliance on computer generated special effects. The opening, a homage to Universal Studio's horror films of the 1930s, is glorious. The introduction to the anti-hero Van Helsing is also intriguing. Here is a man who doesn't know who he really is and who is a pawn of the Catholic Church. His is an interesting conflict.

The movie proceeds to Romania, circa 1890. It's a country in turmoil, its people ruled by fear and superstition. And why not? Vampires and werewolves abound.

Van Hesling [High Jackman] is dispatched by the Church to Romania to finally take care of the nasty Count Dracula. There he meets the amazing Anna [Kate Beckinsdale], a princess whose family Dracula [Richard Roxburgh] has been trying to destroy for centuries.

For the most part, ""Van Helsing"" is good fun. It's a great adventure. What bogs it down is the special effects. Initially, they are interesting. The problem is that these effects go on and on and on. This causes the movie to run at least thirty minutes longer than the story requires. The movies ""Van Helsing"" pays homage to ran anywhere from seventy to ninety minutes. ""Van Hesling"" itself runs one hundred and thirty minutes, mainly because it insists on running the same `cool' special effects over and over again.

Hugh Jackman is a great charismatic actor and to his credit, he does his best to keep you interested but not even his great talent could save this debacle of moviemaking.

Great cast. The director had the great common sense to cast two of my favorite women, Kate Beckinsale and Josie Maran (although Maran was skewered way too soon). Hugh Jackman is the right amount of charm and strength to pull off the character... and finally... it looks good. The special effects are fantastic.

YET!! This movie... about VAMPIRES, FRANKENSTEIN, WEREWOLVES and DR. JEKYLL and MR. HYDE isn't even remotely REMOTELY scary. Not a sliver.

Which is completely and squarely placed on the shoulders of Director Stephen Sommers. Which, and I could see it coming a mile away, also directed The Mummy, which also wasn't scary.

And you know what... I don't think it was intended to be scary when they went into production... which makes it even worse.

Before going to see this movie, I was completely aware of the downfall I would soon become fully aware of. The movie wouldn't be scary. It wouldn't be dark and risky. It would be a comedy with cool special effects.

WHAT!! How can you pool the great monsters of our time and NOT KNOW YOU HAVE TO AT LEAST ATTEMPT TO MAKE THE MOVIE SOMEWHAT SCARY!

Yet the Beckinsale/Maran factor drug me into the theatre and my preconceived notion was absolutely correct...

Ho. Hum. If you like special effect popcorn movies. Don't like to be too mentally challenged when you're watching a movie and like a mild chuckle here and there, then this is your kind of movie.

Unfortunately, when it comes to Dracula, Werewolf and Frankenstein... I wanted to be scared, wanted to be CHALLENGED and wanted to see something that I've never seen before.

Well, that didn't happen.",1098921600,,1656,4.758741258741258
2102315,1,B0002KVUKW,"The Straight:  Unless you have the mentality of a seven-year-old going in...this movie is a big, noisy, expensive pile of festering rubbish.  Sure, there's a story...but it only pops up between flashes of CGI and a bombastic score.  For that matter, the special effects are very average, at best; horrible, at their worst.  There were also frequent moments during the film that conjured up images of an even worse film, ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.""  I was distracted enough by the excruciatingly beautiful Kate Beckinsale to make it to the end of the film.  But the plotting is piece-meal and erroneous, taking a backseat to the pretty lights, fast camera shots, and Kate's gorgeous eyes.  The main characters should've died numerous times during the film.  They are not X-Men, after all.  When one of them does expire it happens in a manner that is feeble compared to what was endured earlier.  Having ""Frankenstein's Monster"" wax intellectual was also extremely ridiculous.  This film is nonsense, even for a fantasy yarn.

The Narrow(or how to make it to the end of this film):  Get a labotomy.  Go in thinking this movie is going to be incredibly dumb and it might elevate itself to mediocrity.  If Kate Beckinsale hadn't been in this movie, I would've thrown unspeakable, rotting things at the screen.  Try very hard to suspend your disbelief...if you can.",1098921600,5,1373,4.956140350877193
2102316,3,B0002KVUKW,"The first good thing about the movie was, naturally, Hugh Jackman. Unfortunately, his normally excellent acting skills were wasted on this particular film. It's not as if I even had high expectations for this movie (which often leads to some measure of disappointment) but it failed to hit even my mediocre expectations. In fact, I would have rated it lower than three stars if it hadn't been for the bloopers as a bonus feature. Make no mistake, the movie had potential -- it just didn't live up to it.  Not only was Hugh Jackman's talent woefully unexplored, the filmmakers seemed far more interested in moving the picture at a frenetic pace than actually investing ANY effort or time on character development. Yes, it has action and plenty of it but without that emotional investment that fully developed characters evoke, the action is merely chaotic motion without meaning or impact. I was actually yawning during parts where I should have been on the edge of my seat. Creature designs had some interesting work (except the less-than-spectacular werewolf designs) but there was so much reliance on (decent but far from exceptional) CGI that they rarely ever seemed to be in the same movie as the material characters. Many green screen shots were unconvincing and the motion control in relation to the green screen shots was shaky enough to be distracting at times. The script was uninspired, the plot had very little flesh to it and, as I said, the characters were hollow. Perhaps a little more money (or less effort to over-reach a limited budget), a LOT more (any!) effort on character development, and some tweaking of plot and dialogue could have made this movie a fun outing.  As it stands, the best points that could be said for the movie was Hugh Jackman in long hair (very nice) and the bloopers which were sometimes laugh-out-loud funny after watching the dismal movie. The bloopers gave more humanity to the DVD than the entire picture and the humility of them made me far more forgiving than I originally felt watching this movie. ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" was a far better, richer picture than ""Van Helsing"" even with Keanu Reeves' typically flat acting and Winona Ryder's flinching when she was supposed to be dead. In Van Helsing's defense, it WAS a PG-13 (therefore very restricted) and B.S's Dracula was R rated but I've seen G rated movies with more depth and development than this one.

The acting is sufficient for the script and the story is encaptivating enough to keep one's interest at all times. Also the DVD extras are very enjoyable to watch. There are tons of bloopers that are most amusing and commentaries that are entertaining and really good documentaries. Also it has this smashing feature where you can watch the movie and see it like they're filming it- which is really neat (and intersting to me at least) Some movies were made to be masterpieces, some were just made so that when you walk away from it all you can think is ""Wow, that was pretty cool"".",1098835200,3,1030,4.543010752688172

I don't know what went wrong with Van Helsing but its should be a crime for a movie of this nature to be this bad. Most of the actors in the film can't act their way out of a paper bag with the excerption of Huge Jackman and he does not give a very good performance in this movie at all. The special effects are great but they don't have a story to support them and the whole script has so many plot holes and inconsistencies that you can drive a truck though them. The characters are not very likable at all and you really don't care if they live or die. The villains are more cartoonist than scary and the climax goes so overboard that you really can't understand what is going on from time to time. I like a good popcorn movie just like everyone but Van Helsing so bad that you really can't understand what you are seeing and stay interested in what is going on.,1098835200,7,1039,4.148514851485149

Give this effort your time and attention.

2102324,4,B0002KVUKW,"""Van Helsing"" hasn't got the best special effects in the world.  Sure, it has a ton of effects in it, but none of them are that special to watch.  In fact, many of them are pretty fake-looking.  But that only adds to the charm of this movie if you ask me.  This is supposed to be an homage to the monster movies of the past, and I think that ""Van Helsing"" manages to capture the essence of those flicks pretty well.  First of all, consider that the special effects in movies such as ""Dracula"" and ""The Wolfman"" were groundbreaking in their day, but are now looked at as sophomoric in effort when compared to the CGI-techno-plaster-anime-wingy-ding effects of today.  ""Van Helsing"" seems to be tipping it's hat at those old effects, all the while wrapping them into some modern CGI a la ""The Mummy"" with Brendan Fraser.

The acting isn't earth-shattering, but it is fun to watch.  Hugh Jackman has this ""John Wayne, tough guy with heart"" thing going throughout this film.  Kate Beckinsale is a damsel-in-not-so-much-distress who manages to whip a little tail on her own.  David Wenham plays ""Carl,"" Van Helsing's sidekick monk, er, friar, who happens to be a whiz-bang inventor full of tricks and treats for our hero to use.  Frankenstein's Monster is given a light, but loving, treatment in this flick.  Mr. Hyde has a cameo(he looks quite a bit like Hyde in ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"").  The Wolfman makes a number of brief appearances, all of which are done in full-frontal CGI-glory.  The Brides of Dracula are rather pesky in this film, and garner most of Van Helsing's attention.  They keep him and the townspeople of Transylvania busy looking at the sky, just waiting for one of them to swoop down on a hapless citizen.  Dracula, as is with most of the old movies, takes center stage as the leader of the pack of villains.  He's played in a hokey fashion by Richard Roxburgh that hearkens back to Bela Lugosi's original, stiff presentation of the Prince of Darkness.  Roxburgh, as well as the rest of the cast, seemed to enjoy himself throughout the movie.

Character development is almost non-existent, but if you are a fan of the creatures these films are based on, you really don't need much background information.  Also, the plot is reed thin, but all you really need to know is that Van Helsing hunts the bad guys with a supernatural flair, and stops at nothing to catch them.

This movie isn't great, but I'm giving it four stars because it does remind me of the old days when a vampire bat flew in on a very visible piece of string and the Wolfman transformed frame-by-frame.  It's worth four stars just for bringing those memories back.  It's excessive, quick-paced and light on plot, but I enjoyed every minute of it.",1098662400,2,2746,4.675
2102325,2,B0002KVUKW,The movie has a horribly weak plot and mediocre special effects. I am giving the extra star because I was interested enough to keep watching till the end. Don't make my mistake.,1098662400,3,177,4.5625
2102326,3,B0002KVUKW,"When I learned there was a 4-movie Ultimate Edition (containing Van Helsing PLUS the original films: Dracula, Frankenstein, Wolfman) I was more than eager to shell out extra bucks for the attractive, three-disc set. I figured Van Helsing may not be a cinematic classic but that it would at least be a fun romp, a ""re-imagining"" that riffs on favorite movie monsters. Like Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes re-imagining, once you suspend the notion that the original is sacrosanct, you are free to enjoy a new twist on favorite old characters. Both Van Helsing and the new Apes have their flaws to be sure, but they have good points that may be enjoyed if you are willing to gag the critic inside.

And Van Helsing does have it's flaws. The plot is sometimes hard to follow, which is ironic, considering it is as thin as the air in Dracula's castle. The only thing truly developed about the characters is the extensive use of CGI animation. [The pervasive use of CGI will disappoint those who are hip to the look of it, as it comes off as cartoonish, despite the attempts at realism. Van Helsing violates the principle that just because you CAN do something, doesn't mean you should - the overruse of CGI prevents us from accepting many of the elements as real because the physics are never quite right, and so our minds know we're looking at something false.] What Van Helsing lacks in true drama, it seeks to make up for in thrills. In the end, it is a fun home theatre experience that yields some visceral thrills - you might think of the whole exercise as ""Monsters: The Thrill Ride,"" where Fun is the priority, not meaningful filmmaking.

I give the movie itself 2.5 stars, plus an extra .5 star for the attractive packaging of Van Helsing: Ultimate Edition, and especially the SMART, VALUE-ADDED IDEA of throwing in the original three films!

---

UPDATE: While Sommers attempted to pay homage to the Universal monsters, the overwrought technology really severed much of that connection (it didn't feel grounded in the real world, taking us ""out"" of the movie). A better attempt to remake these monsters in the Universal tradition is 2009's The Wolfman, directed by Joe Johnston. Rather than pursue the CGI route with wild abandon (as Sommers did), Johnston relied mainly on atmosphere and practical effects - the wolfman was a make-up effect applied to its actors by make-up legend, Rick Baker. CGI was used to good effect for the transformation sequence only. This restraint grounds us in the real world. The wolfman looks real and dangerous (not like a sophisticated cartoon jumping about unnaturally as in Van Helsing). The story is more substantial in The Wolfman, and the characterization is better. The fundamentals really matter when you're asking an audience to suspend disbelief - I hope this trend continues if Universal tackles other classic monsters.",1098662400,7,2866,4.8428571428571425

It was with supreme excitement that I finally got to watch the much hyped ""Van Helsing."" I left with a throbbing headache and with so much disgust I wanted to gather a mob of villagers to storm the movie honchos that green-lighted this $150 million project. First, it looked like the movie was filmed through a pitch black filter. In many scenes, it was impossible to make out the figures and especially the monsters. Secondly, there was so much going on that I gave up trying to figure out the plot. Thirdly, the monsters were disasters. Dracula should have been a sinister, unearthly creature but to me it looked like amateur night in Dixie. The werewolf was obviously such aCGI created creature that you felt no fear. The magic of the old movies is that they introduced audiences to one monster and a small group of people. You got to know them. Even when Universal combined several of the monsters into one of its great horror-fests, like ""House of Dracula,"" ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman,"" you became intimately involved with the key figures, the victims and the monsters. In ""Van Helsing,"" it was like a visual circus gone mad. One positive result from this movie: Universal has recently released all its famous monster legacies in beautifully created packages and at amazingly low prices.

2102330,1,B0002KVUKW,"Possibly the worst film in the history of the world. I don't think I would be far from wrong in hypothesising that this film was made entirely for the sake of the special effects (like the recent Star Wars movies) and not for the sake of making a good film (like the recent Star Wars movies). I spent the entire film sighing and wishing that it would end. There were so many cliches in the dialogue that after a while I was saying what each character was going to say before they said it. There were so many scenes where people flew around on ropes or got thrown through walls that after the first half hour I was waiting for the next rope or wall scene to show up every five minutes. (Hey, maybe if I'd timed the gaps between each rope and wall scene I'd have had something to do other than watch this film). The plot - oh Lord - I think they got their kids to write it. The writers kept trying to top everything they did, throwing in each new utterly predictable ""surprise"" with absolutely no concern for how insulting it would be for anyone with an IQ. As for the special effects - I have a theory that the people who make these movies are so determined to show off their CGI technology that they deliberately make all the effects look like effects. That way people can go, ""Gee, look at that great effect."" Wouldn't it save a lot of time if they just made the CGI effects look real and maybe put a signature or something next to it (e.g., ""This is a CGI effect made by such-and-such,"" or even ""Kilroy was here."")? Honestly, this movie was a horrible waste of time and money - my time and my money. I could have had more fun and saved myself a lot of time and money by repeatedly banging my head against a wall for a few minutes. I'd have probably got the same effect too.",1098662400,7,1775,4.2082111436950145
2102331,2,B0002KVUKW,"VAN HELSING is supposed to be a lighthearted, camp homage to the monster movie genre. And it would have been just that but for the overwhelming pace, relentless CGI visuals (some shockingly mediocre) and the barrage of special effects which render it virtually unwatchable. It's said that 980 different special effects crowd this two hour movie---Is that all? It's all proof that even a $150,000,000.00 budget doesn't make up for a lack of plot and a script that seems pasted together with bubble gum. By the time the credits rolled I had a severe migraine headache.

Clearly a devotee of the ""Kitchen Sink"" school of filmmaking, director Steven Sommers is absolutely hamhanded as he crams in every contrivance he can find, from an out-of-control team of horses racing toward a cliff with our hero in tow to Frankenstein's monster being grotesquely, repetitively barbecued alive to sailing ships at sea to gatling guns and rapid firing crossbows to sexy vampire women having threesomes with Dracula to werewolves. The Mummy never makes an appearance but that's only because Sommers already did two ""Mummy"" movies and used him up.

The scenes shift with dizzying speed, pyrotechnics and rotating cameras give the viewer a sense of vertigo, and so much visual information is compressed into every second that VAN HELSING soon degenerates pointlessly into a visit to a carny House of Mirrors. It batters your brain and can't be grasped.

Sommers substitutes frenetic action for storyline and CGI for characterization, wasting an opportunity to tell a really engaging story, and add a great chapter to the monster movie canon.  Sommers has said that he sees his films as reimaginings of the classic tales. Such an outlook could inspire some really great filmmaking. Unfortunately, here it doesn't.

In what I could comprehend as a plot, Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) the original vampire slayer, travels to Transylvania to assist Princess Anna Valerious (a very sexy Kate Beckinsale faking a deplorable Transcarpathian accent) in ridding the world of Dracula. It seems that the indestructible Count is planning on populating the world with thousands of vampire progeny (courtesy of his three wonderfully underdressed wives, the best element in the picture). In order to animate his undead spawn electrically he has to use Frankenstein (the monster, not the Doctor) as a kind of (quasi) human circuit breaker. The unfortunate monster is quite human here, a kinder, gentler version of Mary Shelley's creature.

Throughout the film we are tantalized by hints of a deeper, darker relationship between Van Helsing and Dracula. Van Helsing is wearing a ring with the Dracula family crest, so the possibilities are tantalizing. Is Van Helsing the Son of Dracula or Dracula's brother? Is he, with his apparently superhuman abilities, one of the Undead? No, when the secret comes out, its that Van Helsing, The Fearless Vampire Slayer was in a past life...a Fearless Vampire Slayer. These are the kind of missed opportunities that dominate this picture.

Jackman is the best thing about VAN HELSING. Dressed in Clint Eastwood's ""second"" wardrobe from PALE RIDER, and behaving like Pierce Brosnan in TOMORROW NEVER DIES, Jackman carries off his role with panache, humor, and grace. The character of Van Helsing demanded a great deal from Jackman physically, and he doesn't stint himself in the stunt sequences. Jackman is absolutely watchable. He definitely put himself in the running for James Bond with VAN HELSING.

Beckinsale is maximal eye candy in this film. Although there are no love scenes and no bare flesh, Beckinsale's modern take on Late Victorian fashion doesn't disappoint. Her acting is only passable here, but it doesn't seem to matter, so little is required of the character.

Robert Roxburgh is a total waste as Dracula. With absolutely no screen presence at all, Roxburgh weakens the entire film with an insipid performance, a shifting accent, and what's worse, no respect for the monster archetype character he portrays. Hands down, he's the worst Dracula ever to be onscreen. Bela Lugosi must be turning in his grave.

In truth, the cinematography and the ""period"" atmosphere hold up remarkably well considering the crystal methamphetamine-fueled quality of the picture as a whole. VAN HELSING is good moviemaking gone rabid. A responsible editor and fifteen minutes of celluloid on the cutting room floor probably would have done VAN HELSING no harm and much good.",1098576000,2,4470,5.178670360110804

Well let me tell you I thought it was a GREAT MOVIE! Many of the reviews I read spoke about how campy the movie was and how bad the acting was especially by the actor that played Dracula... Well my take on this is it was meant to be campy.  The movie starts out in black and white just like the old movies from yesteryear (this should have been a red flag to everyone but I guess a lot missed it) and then we are introduced to Dracula and he is way over the top with his acting ... but just in the beginning of the film... to set it up as campy. It's a wink and nod to the past. Many also complained that the story line just never could happen... that Dracula could never be lead man of both Wolfman and Frankenstein and that Van Helsing could never be a Missionary from the Vatican. With that said, It's called poetic license... those that trash the movie because they don't like the set up I think went into the movie with preconceived ideas on what they were going to see.

Hugh Jackman really helps to save this movie from being a pitiful dreg of film making. He always seems to have this humorous expression on his face, even when he is faced with great peril. Yet, not even the Aussie God can help this movie with what it lacks.

A thin plot consisting of ridiculous twist and turns, and way too many CG effects. You would be better off renting this movie.",1098489600,3,891,4.1988304093567255

2102350,1,B0002KVUKW,"This movie sucked! What was Universal thinking when they greenlighted this script to be made into a feature film? I understand that a studio needs to make money, but to use the various monster properties in this manner is nothing short of sacrilege to any serious monster movie fan. The film itself, while flashy and indicative of the CGI technology that is available today, lacks any sort of plot, subplot, etc. Yes, Hugh Jackman is a good choice to play the famous vampire hunter. Yes, Kate Beckinsale is a fine choice to play the associate/love interest. No, the ""Big Three"" of Universal's stable did not belong together in this abortion of a film (at least not in the manner that they were presented). No, Richard Roxburgh is not a convincing Count Dracula, nor can he act the part (a tree could act the part better). This ""plot"" is reminiscent of the 1970 schlock ""Dracula versus Frankenstein."" Dracula, a scientist? Riiiiight. The Wolf Man, a mere pawn in the movie? Sure, of course. The Frankenstein Monster, a verbal, lonely misfit (okay, truer to the Shelley Monster)? Possibly entertaining, but not the film for it to happen. I am glad thay I did not waste the price of a movie ticket, or the price of the DVD. I rented it, and that is money and time that I will never get back.",1098403200,2,1288,4.604347826086957
2102351,3,B0002KVUKW,"Stephen Sommers, the man who brought us the ""Mummy"" movies, wrote and directed the clever monster movie, ""Van Helsing."" You've got to hand it to this guy for single-handedly trying to bring back the long-lost and much-missed ""rainy Saturday afternoon adventure epics.""

The film is gorgeous. Snowy, gothic, shadowy Eastern European locations predominate, and the aggressive, brilliantine CGI will take your breath away. Actually, there were a couple of moments where I just had to pause the film to turn to my friend and say ""this movie sure looks EXPENSIVE, doesn't it?"" before both agreeing that we ""liked it more than we thought we would.""

Hugh Jackman plays Van Helsing, a sort of nineteenth century monster-hitman who must take on Dracula, The Wolfman, and Frankenstein's monster in seemingly one lost weekend. He arrives in Transylvania and is practically spit on by the trembling, untrusting townfolk. We have to deal with terrorism and a waning economy in today's modern world, but THEY have to deal with vampire's brides swooping down from the clouds, baring fangs, hissing, and devouring ""one or two villagers a month.""

Van Helsing quickly proves himself to the sexy Transylvanian princess (Kate Beckinsale, who never wavers in her commitment to her Slavic accent AND her eye makeup). Although it is never explained where she gets her highlights, after a brief scuffle that establishes sexual tension in that action-movie way, they are off as a team to try and defeat evil from reproducing, and conquering the continent, while upholding a commitment to a Royal Bloodline, that Dracula and his henchmen will finally be destroyed.

Again, I'd like to thank the filmmakers for making it a BIT more complex than it could have been. Dracula, though evil, is funny and charming. The Wolfman, though hairy, is Beckinsale's brother (and his wolf infection, oddly enough, seems almost to be an allegorical stand-in for the AIDS epidemic) and the Frankenstein monster, though ugly, has issues of his own.

The supporting cast do more with campy with one-dimensional roles than anybody ever could have asked. Richard Roxburgh, as the Count, has a lot of fun with his part. Shuler Hensley, as Frankenstein's monster, is teriffic. ""I want to live"" he declares simply while dangling over the edge of a cliff toward the film's end. And as cheesy as the moment was, I found it weirdly touching. The film has a relentless energy and bounding enthusiasm, so every moment counts, and with all of its flaws, I was never bored.

Early sequences, such as the black-and-white opening horror homage, and the rooftop battle, with of all creatures, a fantastic Jekyll--Hyde CGI creation, are memorable. However, inattention to certain major details brings the film down a few levels from classic, unvanquished  adventure films such as ""Raiders of the Lost Ark.""

To start, the dialogue is exceptionally bad, and it didn't need to be. The plot has more holes than a slice of Finlandia swiss. Character relationships are glossed over. Much-needed attempts at humor fizzle. Van Helsing's romance with Beckinsale is virtuallly ignored. Hugh Jackman is a wonderful actor, but his Van Helsing has all the range of a William Shatner film festival. And if he's the film's central hero, with sequels certainly to come, we've got to know him and like him. Instead of probing a bit more, we're left to ponder the three g's: grunts, grimaces, and grizzled objections of complaint.

That being said, the film is a lot of fun, with dazzling spectacle and great, relentless action sequences. The DVD is generously packed with behind-the-scenes extras, that step-by-meticulous step systematically destroy every illusion that the production spent gazillions trying to seduce us with.

On one further note, I am sure kids would love this film, but I would advise parents to use extra caution. I was a sensitive, fragile little boy and I have a feeling certain scenes, like those fangy flying wraiths devouring fleeing villagers, would have kept me up for a night or two.",1098403200,6,4038,5.076923076923077

Hugh is definitely great as Van Helsing, Kate Beckinsale is wonderful as Princess Anna and Richard Roxburgh is WONDERFUL as Dracula!  There's also A LOT of action in this movie and Van Helsings gadgets make Inspector Gadget look like a sissy!

First, a big fan of the universal 1930 monster movies, this was the golden age monster movies, frankenstein, dracula, the wolfman, the invisible man, the mummy and etc!!!

So I was waiting for this since I heard that they gonna make a movie with Van Helsing and sadly this movie is a big miss!!!

Stephen Sommers, who gave us 2 good popcorn movies with The Mummy and The Mummy Returns continues with a similar kind of movie, but this time, it's bad!!!

The beginning is kind of good, shot in black & white, it'S really cool to see that the movie is begenning after the first Frankenstein. The special effects are really good too, but this is the only 2 good things I can say about the movie.

The storyline is bad, it could be a lot better, the acting: the actors tries their best, but you know, when you have nothing interesting to say you can't make miracles. It's sad because theres good actors in the movie : Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsdale. And the Monsters, ouf!!! The worst count Dracula I ever seen, Frankenstsein, a very boring new version of monster and The Wolfman, who is kind of interesting but you don'T see him very much!

There'S some good points, like the special effects, the mood, the colors, but it'S all!!!

So, personnaly, a very bad movie who could be a lot better, because there was a lot of potential! It'S sad, because i wanted to like it!

2 stars because of the special effects, the atmosphere, and some good action sequences!!",1098403200,2,1490,4.492592592592593

Somehow I just picture a bunch of half-bored overrated actors and actresses in a blue room.  The effects are good but I don't feel like the people are really ""there"". If you don't understand the meaning behind that commit, then you must like this movie.

Hugh Jackman was great in the X-men movies, but he is lacking sorely in this and the woman(whoever she was) was horrid, so was the goofy side kick who was trying too hard to be quirky and sucked at it.  Frankenstien's monster was a just a fat dork, drakula was a goof, and Van Helsing just wasn't.",1098403200,,689,4.48
2102365,1,B0002KVUKW,"Horrible.  Awful.  Deplorable.  None of these words can sum up just how terrible this film was.  The plot of Van Helsing seemed as though it was probably written by a third grader.  As I sat in the theater watching this garbage, I could imagine a ten year old child saying to his film-maker father ""and then Frankenstein swings in on a rope, and then the Wolf Man jumps out of a tree, but then here come some flying vampires, but's its all OK because Van Helsing has a silver stake firing MACHINE GUN!!"".  Nothing in this film made sense.  It's creators took pages from some truly excellent horror stories, wiped all of their buttocks with them, stapled them together, and called it art.  The characters were about as deep as your average kiddie-pool, it would be generous to call the plot ""moronic"", and the ""love-story"" definitely the most contrived I've yet seen.  Even the CGI dominated action scenes were implausible.  If anyone reading this has seen ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"", expect more of the same.  It's the only movie that I've seen that approaches van Helsing in its awfulness.  Everyone associated with making this tripe ought to be ashamed of themselves.",1098403200,3,1182,4.797029702970297
2102366,3,B0002KVUKW,"After writing and directing the empty blockbusters of the Mummy and the Mummy Returns, Van Helsing finds him looting Universal's monster vault once again, this time featuring the Frankenstein monster (Shuler Hensley), the Wolfman (Will Kemp), and of course, Dracula (Richard Roxburgh).  Hugh Jackman stars as the monster hunter Van Helsing, teamed up with a princess (Kate Beckinsale) and a loyal friar (David Wenham from Lord of the Rings), sent to Transylvania to stop the count from unleashing a horde of bloodsucking offspring.  Some spots of the film are deliciously campy, while others stick out as plain dull.  The opening is a wonderful homage to the classic Universal monster films, and buffs of classic horror will find plenty of references and homages in the film.  The special effects are some of the best CGI seen today, and Van Helsing is more satisfying than Sommers' Mummy films, although underneath the break neck pace and special effects there isn't much left to it.  It's still worth seeing and it has a bit of a surprising ending, and a sequel is almost virtually inevitable.",1098403200,16,1095,5.027624309392265

The kind of movie that is fun to watch several times because there will always be things that didn't get noticed the first time around. The movie was also pleasantly atmospheric. It is not a deep movie. Pretty basic really, but a lot of fun to watch! Not as serious as the old Frankenstein and Dracula movies but it was not intended to challenge the classics. It was intended to be very, very, visually stimulating and surprising - and it is!",1098403200,3,567,4.68

I enjoyed both Mummy movies because they were campy enough for the audience to have a good time with and you had characters that you cared about and rooted for.  Van Helsing does not only lack these qualities  in spades but it shows that it was the chemistry of the actors who made The Mummy Movies successful, not the director who directed them. This movie is just plain bad from beginning to end. Hugh Jackman is a great actor but he's stuck with a really bad character that has no charm or charisma and the rest of the cast is stuck in the mud with him. Dracula is a whiney wimp in this film and the Wolfman looks too fake to really take seriously. The special effects are fine but lacks a real feel to them and the great cinematography is wasted in a story that actually makes no sense what so ever.

Van Helsing is a great example of what can go wrong when you don't have a competent director who knows what he's doing.",1098316800,4,1020,4.269430051813472
2102369,3,B0002KVUKW,"Wow...I'm exhausted!  Hugh Jackman is wonderful; you cannot fault him, though you do chuckle - again, he is a man with power who cannot recall his past.  And Kate Beckinsale is really showing her stuff.  When you look at Cold Comfort Farm, Underworld and now Van Helsing, it shows there is little this lass cannot do and do well.  The action is non-stop - literally.  It must have more near escapes than any ten - make that twenty - movies put together.  The sets are moody and properly monster movie Gothic.  And you get Vlad Dracul, his brides and a horde of baby vampires - the children of the night - that Drac is trying to bring to life.

But that is only the start.  There is Dr. Jekyll and Robbie Coltraine as Mr. Hyde - as an appetizer.  You mustn't forget a werewolf or two and Frankenstein's monster.  Oops, almost forgot Igor!  By this time, you are ready for Bobby ""Boris"" Pickett to break into The Monster Mash!  The same bunch that did such a bang on job with The Mummy, which I thoroughly enjoyed, does this.  Only someone needs to tell Stephan Sommers often less is more and more is just too much.  This movie is a perfect example of so much going for it - too much going for it - that it overwhelms you.

Van Helsing (Jackman) is an immortal who has memories at being at Masada.  The Church sends him out to hunt down evil and smote it by any means needed.  After taking down and dispatching Jekyll/Hyde, they send him to Transylvania to handle Drac the naughty vamp.  Seems Dracula and his three brides are making a nuisance of themselves at a local village, and only thing keeping them and the werewolves in line as the ancient family Valerious, but they are now down to a brother and sister.  Anna Valerious watched as her brother battles a werewolf.  The brother saves her, but goes over the cliffs, later to become a werewolf.  Van Helsing and Carl, his religious sidekick, arrives on the scene, but the villagers are not so happy to see them.  Seems the vamps only want one or two villagers a month, not too bad, they think.  Carl please note is David Wenham (Faramir from Lord of the Rings!), in case he seems familiar.

Van Helsing, Anna and Carl join forces and the villagers attitude soon changes as they learn the Dracula is trying to bring his thousands of bat babies to life.  The key is Frankenstein's monster, very sympathetically portrayed Shuler Hensley.  It comes down to a battle of the titans between Dracula and Van Helsing, (they second time they have gone down this road) and this time the town ain't big for two these two; one has to bite the dust or each other!

The is no pace to this movie, it's totally pedal to the metal the whole way, where The Mummy movies see slow in comparison!  Shame.  This could have been one really great movie.  The cast was right.  Great special effects, it was just you feel like you have been beat over the head with every cinema monster ever to lumber through Universal's backlot.

Obviously, this is left open for a sequel.  And despite this disappointment, I will be eagerly watching.  Maybe if they look at this one and see what they did wrong, second time around they might get it right.  Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi this ain't; it's not even the classy stylized battle of Lee and Cushing.  But they I didn't want it to be.  I just wanted a few moments to catch my breath.  The ending is very beautiful filmed and the emotions reach you, almost poetically.  Shame more of that could not have be sprinkled into this rest of the script.",1098316800,6,3516,4.44131455399061
2102370,3,B0002KVUKW,"Imagine, if you would, finding something with empty calories that you just can't stop consuming until, when it's finally over, you find yourself stuffed and feeling sick. That's kind of the impression I got after watching Van Helsing. There is nothing there, but you can't help but watch and enjoy the total ridiculousness of it. It is entertaining for sure, with incredible eye candy, but leaves you with a hollow feeling. The plot, for what there is of it, is basically this : Hugh Jackman plays Gabriel Van Helsing, monster hunter axtraordinaire. He teems with a beautiful Transylvanian princess named Anna(Played by the exquisiteley beautiful Kate Beckinsale), and later, Frankenstein's Monster(Will Kemp), to stop the king of all things that go bump in the night, Dracula himself(Played by Richard Roxburgh), and his evil spawn and vampire brides. There is some more mumno jumbo about Anna's family and all that, but does it really matter?. Nope. Not at all. In fact, none of it matters. Director Stephen Sommers makes movies that don't recquire a solid, coherent plot. Just lots of fun, lots of action, and lots of effects. Mission accomplished. Sommers, who has already made his print on Hollywood with ""The Mummy"" and it's sequel, follows his same old formula. The movie is a non stop rollercoaster ride that just flies off in all different directions that it is hard to keep up. The sets, production design, and locations, are nothing short of gorgeous and breathtaking. One gigantic plus the movie has. Sommers knows how to film a set and amazing locations and he films the heck out of every one. So much so, that the film is more about the photography than it is about anything else. Jackman is a very nice, likeable guy, but he seems to be at odds with the role. He is at once interesting and inviting, and the next seems wooden and off somewhere else. Beckinsale is unbelieveably gorgeous, and the camera loves her. At least she has a strong character to play instead of the usual damsel in mistress. Roxburgh, as Dracula, hams it up in an off setting performance. He seems to be channeling the old school style of Dracula acting instead of anything new or scary. His accent sounds forced and off centered at times as well. No doubt the actor is good elsewhere, but he seems to flimsily do it here. The movie does a nice job of incorporating all of the classic Universal movie monsters like The Wolfman, Jekyll And Hyde, and others, into the movie. The beginning of the movie, filmed in glorious black and white, is the finest part of the entire movie. It really felt like those old type films. If only for a short bit. The CGI is good in parts, obviously fake in others. There is so much CGI and effects and the like, that the film goes on overload and out of control. It seems that the whole point of the movie was to get to point A to point B just so they could set up some extravagant action/chase/CGI scene, with nothing keeping it together. If you like this sort of thing, which I do, you will probably dig the simple popcorn entertainment of it all. But a little goes a long way sometimes.",1098316800,4,3109,4.6442831215970966
2102371,3,B0002KVUKW,"Even though I enjoyed the Mummy (2 more than 1), I expected more than I got from this flick. The stars are capable and engaging.

The dialog is a little over campy at times for a ""serious"" vampire movie, but on the whole moves along briskly if you ignore the fact that it is hopelessly modern for the 1887 setting. Likewise, the techno gadgetry is an engaging tip of the hat to the Bond flicks, but ""nitro"" glycerine had been invented long before this date, and we have a ""gas powered crossbow (what's the string for?) with a seemingly inexhaustible supply of bolts without recharging.

It's obvious that the writer/director and producer love adventure movies, and the hero's hat to Indiana Jones. Jackson is a likeable and dashing action hero. The CGI is mostly very good, and most of the photography is excellent. BUT, some of the CGI is hopelessly over-the-top, especially the carriage chase and Dracula's castle, and chasms that dwarf the grand canyon. The most discouraging part of this movie are the holes in the plots that really disappoint. The hero doesn't remember his origins, but then his boss tells him that he will probably find his memory in Transylvania. (He doesn't.) There is a gratuitous Dr. Hyde, in the vein of the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. There is the un-explained situation of how Van Helsing had originally killed Dracula (and I guess turned him into the un-dead), linked with that Dracula can only be killed by a werewolf (similar to Underworld). Why does Dracula want to take over the world through his offspring at all, when he's all hollow inside--no love, no joy, no remorse? Why does he tolerate his brides -- admittedly babes, but with dumb lines and terrible accents? Why does Dracula have a big Halloween costume party with a lot of other vampires at his ""summer palace"" in Budapest? Why, one wonders, do the brides of Dracula have breasts but no nipples--in any case, the vampire brood feed on blood? Why do their vampire progeny come out of ""pods"" (sort of like in the Alien)? What actually kills Anna at the end of the movie? Does she merely die because her family's mission is completed, and if so, how does this square with the fact that she and Dracula are in fact related? One suspects that Van Helsing 2 will clear all this up in the same way that Mummy 2 cleared up the holes in the plot of the Mummy--not at all.

On the other hand, Frankenstein's monster is a truly great character in this movie, who deserved more screen time than the campy brides with their terrible accents. So the bottom line, this is fun to watch, but put your brain on hold. If you want to see something somewhat more satisfying plot-wise in the same vein, see League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. If you want to see a seriously well-made vampire movie, see Underworld.

It's much better than some of the movies you could waste your time renting.  Van Helsing delivers what it advertises: a movie about monsters that is action packed and interesting.  It is a very well done action movie and I would reccomend renting it before buying it.  The acting is mediocre but the acting is not what drives this film, its the action.  Some parts can get slow and repetitive but overall its a fast paced movie.  So, if you want to have a fun night and watch a cool action movie, rent it.

I'm talking of books by the likes of Robert McKee, Lew Hunter and William Goldman. In particular he should re-read McKee's STORY. I say this because 'Van Helsing' is almost devoid of story. It is perhaps the worst film I have seen in years. When will this type of film-maker learn that CGI effects do not make a movie. I seem to remember Goldman in one of his books recalling a line by the legendary director George Roy Hill, something along the lines of ""...get the screenplay right, get the casting right, and you can phone in the direction."" The screenplay for Van Helsing sucks big time and is barely worthy of the name. The casting is God-awful. Hugh Jackman's accent changes for each sequence. Kate Beckinsale is very pretty but if she's an actress, I'm Frank Sinatra. Worse than that however, much, much worse, is the casting of Richard Roxburgh as Dracula. Can someone explain how this no-talent ham gets parts in big budget pictures? The man is devoid of anything approaching screen presence and charisma. His performance was akin to that of an enthusiastic member of a village amateur dramatic society. Didn't Sommers see how bad Roxburgh was in LXG?? Didn't Sommers realise the casting of Roxburgh as Moriarty in LXG seriously undermined the film? Sommers caught us all off guard with 'The Mummy', which had the right mix of human characters and special effects, a  bit like the original Star Wars films. Now, with Van Helsing, he has gone down the same route, much quicker too, as George 'Greedy' Lucas has with the Star Wars prequels i.e. no discernable story of note, terrible actors and plenty of super special effects.

2102392,4,B0002KVUKW,"When ""Van Helsing"" came out in theaters I was pretty harsh. I don't know what I expected certainly something different than this campy popcorn movie. That was probably part of the problem. ""Van Helsing"", like ""The Fearless Vampire Killers"", packages camp, classic horror, satire and action all into one seamless package. Is it the worst film of the world? Well, yes if you were expecting enlightenment or something deep and meaningful. But if you were expecting adventure, humor and a startling mix of traditional special effects and CGI to support some truly looney and over-the-top performances, you'll have a blast with ""Van Helsing"".

Abraham Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) is a man with no memory. Working for the Vatican to rub out evil throughout the world, he faces his most difficult task--facing Dracula who has been supporting Dr. Frankenstein's research into creating life for his own nefarious reasons. Van Helsing also has to save the souls of the family that has been fighting Dracula for centuries. Anna the latest in a long line of vampire killers is in danger and Van Helsing is directed to help her. Playing Q to Van Helsing's James Bond is Carl a Friar who comes up with all the wonderful toys Van Helsing must use to dispatch evil.

Stephen Sommers' monster hit movie was completely misinterpreted by most critics and, yes, by lots of moviegoers. It's not a perfect movie but it's perfectly entertaining. There's always going to be mindless fun movies created for the 12 year old in all of us. Sommers' movie is an attempt to recreate that feeling (which he, no doubt, had as a kid as well) for adult movie audiences as well as kids.

The quality of the DVD varies a bit. While the colors are vivid throughout most of the movie, the beginning of the film looks particularly soft with a lack of sharp detail. It does improve, however, as the movie progresses. My guess is that it's due both to the transfer and the large amount of detail in the images as well as the compression. Some of the sequences are startling clear and are among the best I've seen on DVD. The sound has tremendous presence. Sommers and Ducsay his producer/editor provide a delightfully informative audio commentary as do three of the main actors from the film Richard Roxburgh, Shuler Hensley and Will Kemp.

The big difference between the two region one editons as simple--1 extra disc. Both editions have outtakes, ""You Are in the Movie"" (which tries to create the impression that you're part of the production crew on the set), ""360 Degree Tour of Dracula's Castle"", ""The Legend of Van Helsing"" (which discusses the character as portrayed through films), the first level of the ""Van Helsing"" Xbox game (which can be played on your DVD player) and the ""Bringing the Monsters to Life"" featurette.

The extra disc has a number of features not included on the disc disc set. An interactive map, ""Darkness Falls: Dracula's Lair is Transformed"" which looks at the production end, a short documentary ""Van Helsing: The Story, The Life and The Legend"". Most importantly for old horror movie fans is the inclusion of three classic Universal horror movies Todd Browning's ""Dracula""(1931), James Whale's ""Frankenstein"" (1931) and George Waggner's ""The Wolf Man"" (1940). ""Dracula"" is essentially the same as the first disc in the ""Legacy"" series with commentary, trailers and a short documentary. ""Frankenstein"" and ""The Wolf Man"" arrive bare bones with just the feature films.

The big question will be whether or not the deluxe edition will be worth it? Only if you don't have the three Universal classics included. The featurettes and extras on disc three aren't all that impressive overall considering the price. If you don't have the three classic films and only want those (vs. ponying up for the ""Legacy"" boxed sets), then this would be the way to go. It's a pity that this editon doesn't have a ""Director's Cut"" (if one exists) along with Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale's commentary on the film.

Overall, ""Van Helsing"" is a great movie to watch on Halloween (and there's only one minor bad word that I recall hearing and it's pretty minor)with kids 6 and older. It's a way to revisit the classics you grew up enjoying without having your kids get bored watching old black and white movies that with pacing from another era.",1098144000,15,4315,4.862585034013605

On the DVD you get to see a 360 degree view of the castle and the extras are worth the price.  I still think this could become a franchise. Too bad the producers of the X-Men never made a Wolverine movie instead.

If it wasn't for Hugh Jackman both films would have never been tolerable.  It's a testament to his talent when he can carry a movie that's almost straight special effects. Acting in front of a green screen can't be very satisfying as an actor and he pulls it off well.

You don't have to be a fan of the monster films to like this one.

It has enough outlandish stunts in it to make it one you can see at least twice and still enjoy. Myself, I love the old classics and hope more of them are relased with this film.",1098144000,2,840,4.122699386503068
2102415,4,B0002KVUKW,"I know because I AM one!  I love monster movies of all kinds and Van Helsing is no exception.  True, it is not a masterpiece in filmaking.

I don't care.  It is entertaining and makes use of screen characters who have sat on the shelf for way too long.

Yep, I'm talking about Dracula, Frankenstein and The Wolf Man.

These are updated, reinvisioned versions.  Some people have a problem with this, but as long as you don't count it as Universal Monsters canon, you shouldn't have a problem.

So, here's a short run down of what's good in my humble opinion:

1.  Use of characters.  Lots of monsters!  Vampires, werewolves,Frankenstewin, Mr. Hyde, I almost expected the Gillman to pop up.  Oh well, maybe in the sequel.

2.  The action and SFX are solid.  I kno it looks like a cartoon, but it is STYLIZED! They are intentionally stled to look cartoonish.

3.  The plot is ORIGINAL.  It is totally different from ALL the original Monster movies.

4.  The Costumes and Sets are AMAZING.  The film is worth seeing for them alone. Character wardobes fit the characters perfectly and the setting rovide the perfect air for the film.

So, take it or leave it.  If you want to check it out, go ahead, its a fun popcorn ride.

Classic film of the ages?  Probably not.

But, I shall say it again...IT IS FUN!",1098144000,9,1300,4.491379310344827
2102416,1,B0002KVUKW,"I can describe this movie with one word.  S***.  However, I feel it is my duty to explain why this movie is crap.  Should I start with the horrible plot, or maybe the demented scribbles they call monsters.  No, I think it would be best to start with Van Helsing himself.  Van Helsing has no trace of any originality.  He is instead peiced together by several other action heroes.  He looks like he tried to dress like ""Indiana Jones"" and failed, he has the gadgets of ""James Bond"" along with the incredibly boring debreifing scenes, and has the personality of ""Hellboy"" except in dork form.

Van Helsing is played by Hugh Jackman, but he isn't the only good actor here.  You also have Kate Beckinsale from Underworld, and... a bunch of people nobody who sees this movie will know.  Because they hired an A+ cast there should be some decent acting, right?  Wrong!  It seems as though the director wanted them to act like a group of third graders puting on a school play.  So instead of good acting you'll have bad one liners and some of the worst Transylvanian accents you ever heard.

However since this is the director of the mummy the special effects should be good.  Wrong again.  Just about every monster or effect has been over done and doesn't look all that scary or exciting.  So what was supposed to be monsters looks instead like they asked a demented five year old to scribble on the film.  One good example is dracula himself.  Dracula is supposed to turn into a bat, right?  Well according to this movie he turns into a giant pink blob with wings and a snout.

Oh and did I mention the plot.  Well apperntly, when Van Helsing was twenty he was a vampire hunter with, guess what, amnesia.  His job was to hunt down Dracula who seems to know him from somewhere.  Along the way he runs into this warrior princess who must kill Dracula or she won't get into heaven.  From there the plot goes on, but it doesn't make any sense and is about as dull as a bag of dirt.  However, Van Helsing seems to need to bring this dirty friar, and there seems to be a full moon every night in Transylvania.  Another thing is that Van Helsing doesn't seem to want to kill Dracula and nobdoy else wants him too either, so why is he doing it.  Maybe he's nuts, maybe this pope guy has it in for him, I don't know.

Frankly all this movie does is insult Dracula and moviegoers in general.  Unless you enjoy torturing yourself or have about as many brain cells as a lawn chair, avoid this movie at all costs.",1098144000,3,2495,4.372549019607843
2102417,4,B0002KVUKW,"All right now, this movie has gotten a lot of bad reviews. With good reason some say, I'm not one of these. Let me start by saying this: The movie is a campy crossover style tale that throws Dracula, the Wolfman, Frankenstien's monster, and several other notable horror creatures together for about two hours of CGI action. Stop. Read that again. Now consider this: What kind of plot, characterizations, and entertainment factor is something like this going to provide?

If you are expecting some sort of masterpiece, a triumph in action filming... This movie just isn't for you. If you are looking for a movie with a solid, sensical plot... This movie isn't really for you. Because honestly, when Frankenstien's monster is the key to some evil plot schemed by Dracula, can you really expect all that much?

However! I'd like to state that if you are just a horror loving person that's not afraid to operate under the ""it doesn't have to make sense"" rule... If you get excited at the mere mention of vampires or werewolves... If you just love hours of top notch special effects with a plot you don't have to think about to have fun with... Then this is the movie for you.

So yes, while the hard core, Bram Stoker's Dracula loving, film reviewer in me weeps at such a horrible mush of cliches and over-the-top acting... The part of me that is compelled to watch the SciFi Channel's weekend ""originals"" drools at the thought of being able to sit down for a fun movie featuring some of my favorite monsters duking it out.",1098144000,11,1519,4.618518518518519
2102418,1,B0002KVUKW,"How anybody can even beging to enjoy this movie is beyond me really.

Lets break it down shall we? First the acting...if you can call it that is very, very bad. Hugh Jackman and Kate (both of who I enjoy in other movies) are both horrible here, but I'm putting more blame on the director then them. Then we have the rest of the crew, all of which are horrible also, the only good acting IMO was Frankenstein to be honest, he was the only good thing in the entire movie for me.

Next the action, we'll you'd think that a movie that has a budget of over 150 million would at least have some amazing action in it right...WRONG. It's so akward, clumsy, cheesey and crappy that you can't even get into it. Kate bounces around the sets like she's a Gummy Bear, and most of the monsters look horrible, I've seen better CGI in movies that only cost 4 million to make. Sad.

Now let's talk about the CGI and special effects...they were also bad. The werewolves looked like they were done for a saturday morning cartoon, and Hyde looked like a flesh colored Shrek, and sounded like a complete moron with that HORRIBLE voice they gave him.

I gave this movie one star for only one reason (other then that's all the lower you can rate things on here) and that reason is because of the extra's that come along with the DVD. It includes the orignal monster films (dracula, frankenstein, and the wolf man) and it's packed with tons of extras, but that is no reason to buy this POS movie. The movie it's self is actually lower then 0 stars, it's more like a -5.",1098144000,4,1545,4.317241379310345
2102419,2,B0002KVUKW,"Before saying anything else, let me state that this was a fun film to watch, though not much involved real human actors.  Stephen Sommers is clearly one of those directors so enamored with CGI technology that plot and acting get lost in the mix.  The two 'Mummy' films were very similar to 'Helsing', in that effects ruled them rather than storyline.

The plot is literally all over the place, with monsters, characters, and geography passing by without much audience notice.  Hugh Jackman really is a fine actor, but you hardly get a chance to see it in this film (wonder how he felt about doing  virtually no acting in the final climactic battle sequence ?); he does a few weapons tricks and some one-liners-that's about it.  Kate Beckinsale looks great (how could she breathe in that corset?), but seems lost among all the flying wirework; like Jackman, she has minimal dialogue.

The effects work in 'Van Helsing' is spectacular, and I wouldn't be surprised if this film gets an Oscar nomination in that category.  However, this along with the bombastic soundtrack crowds out what really makes for a good movie: good acting and a competent plot.  The irony is that Sommers eagerly states how much he 'enjoys' writing screenplays for his films (in the extra features).  I just don't see it here or in his other big movies.

Nevertheless, 'Van Helsing' is a fun if uninspiring way to spend two hours...",1098144000,,1404,4.784232365145228

Not only was the price of admission not worth it, but my time was painfully wasted.  The direction was atrocious, I've seen both stars act in other movies and they were not used properly (Pinnochio has less lumber), I would suggest both actors to find new agents.  The screenwriter should renew their alzheimer's medication prescription.  The story has horrible loopholes, grade school dialogues and takes itself entirely too seriously.  Did George Bush write this?  It wanted to be Die-Hard and Dracula, didn't even get close to either.  It does remind me of Hudson Hawk, but it's not one fourth as funny.

If someone had bothered to market this as a spoof I would be kinder.  It wanted to be funny and I would have appreciated that, even loved it.  Unfortunately it fell flat, horribly so.  I feel bad for the rest of the cast and crew, they did deliver.  The art direction, photography, special effects and costumes were outstanding.  It would have been pleasant to escape into some other time and world for 90 minutes, but its sheer absurdity grounded it permanently.  Stay away, far far away.",1098144000,2,1214,4.774038461538462

2102434,4,B0002KVUKW,"Here's the plot short and simple.  Valarious the elder made a vow that either he or his progeny would kill Dracula in exchange for eternal salvation because Valarious is, in this case, Dracula's father. The Valarious Clan has helped protect Eastern Europe from evil and monsters through the centuries. Dracula has managed to kill most of the family off except Princess Anna which means the entire line is in danger of slipping into purgatory. Van Helsing is sent by the Holy Order to A) Keep Anna alive and B) Kill dracula.

Frankenstein's monster is involved because Dracula needs Dr. Frankenstein's Machine to bring his children to life. Turns out when vampires reproduce the children are born dead. The Monster is the key to the machine because he is the only thing powerful enough to provide enough electricity to run the thing.

I'm sure the issues concerning right to life and what is true evil are unintentional because it IS an action movie and a very good one at that.

Friar Carl(same actor who played Faramir in LTR) steals the movie. For me, the best line is when on a stormy night, Warewolf has broken into Anna's home and is consequently scared off by Van Helsing, Carl runs into the room stops and says ""Why does it smell like wet dog in here?""

I am also happy to say that this is the only movie in recent memory that the sidekick gets a little bedroom time and the hero doesn't! Woo hoo go Friar Carl!

Now for the bad parts: It annoyed me to no end that Van Helsing has lost his memory and turns into a Warewolf. Just to ice the cake there's a scene where the warewolf pops his claws and rakes them across stone. It may have worked if the same actor hadn't played Wolverine and Van Helsing.

There's a monk for example who creates all sorts of inventions for Van Helsing to use (a little bit of a rip off of James Bond). Inventions include hand pumped spinning blades, a crossbow that can fire bolts like a machine gun and a device that produces enormous amounts of light. Although these are obviously fake, especially for the time period, they just make the action more cool and interesting. The movie lacks a bit in originallity, and plenty of ideas from other movies can be seen. What it lacks in originallity and realism, however, it more than makes up in action.

2102442,1,B0002KVUKW,"Well, for a start, forget about Bram Stoker. In `Dracula' of course, van Helsing is a scholar, fighting the forces of darkness with his intellect not his muscles. Here suddenly he is a hulking action hero. He isn't even allowed to be a scholarly type with muscles. Rather he's just a grunt, relying entirely on his sidekick Carl whenever there are any books or stuff that need reading. Now it's not really  any kind of virtue in a movie to be too deferential to literary source material. But all this is about as ridiculous as casting Arnold Schwarzenegger  in a loin cloth to play the lead in a movie and then calling it `The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes'.

WE could still forgive this readily enough if the van Helsing on offer was an interesting or engaging hulking action hero. He is not. As played by Hugh Jackman he is almost entirely lacklustre, wooden and uninteresting. No flair, no imagination, no wit, no style. Much the same goes for Kate Beckinsale as the one-dimensional heroine (tediously stereotypical exotic princess type). And, well, I thought Gary Oldman was safe in his tenure of the award for all-time least scary Count Dracula in movie history but just watch Richard Roxburgh snatch it away from him here. But if Dracula is feeble, his brides are just laughable. (It's hard to say if they are feebler in their human version or when they take flight and become entirely computer generated. I'd go for the latter: here they are naked but in a peculiarly daft fit of prudishness they have been permitted neither nipples nor genitals.) If David Wenham as Carl stands out among the cast it's not because he's particularly good but just because he's not positively awful like everyone else.

The film is directed by Stephen Sommers who gave us the two `Mummy' movies. These were both utter silly nonsense but, in their undemanding way, immensely entertaining. This movie has the same vice but fails to share the redeeming virtue. Perhaps the reason is partly because in `The Mummy' we had Fraser, Weisz and Hannah as something roughly recognizable as an approximation to ordinary human beings, finding themselves confused and at a loss in the face of an unfamiliar supernatural terror. Whereas here we just have superhuman comic book heroes it is very hard to identify with or much care about taking the whole thing very much in their stride. But then that's true of the `Blade' movies which are a lot better than this. A better diagnosis is that this is just a totally crap movie, one in which writing talent, imagination, decent acting and more or less everything else a  movie needs are lazily neglected in a woeful over-reliance on tediously overdone CGI fireworks. Some horror movies,, notoriously, succeed in being crap in a rather fun, campy sort of way.

2102456,1,B0002KVUKW,"Van Helsing Sucks!

I cannot believe that people actually give this movie high praise. Not only is this movie an insult to horror fans, this movie is an insult to movie lovers.

It appears that I am officially out of the demographic. Not the usual 18-35 demographic (I'm 32), but the demographic that enjoys overly loud, obnoxious films with bad acting, horrible writing and special effects that make Jason & the Argonauts look cutting edge. Actually now that I think about it Jason & The Argonauts does look better.

I don't even know where to begin with explaining how bad this film truly is. Van Helsing screws up major movie monster lore. I am not even an expert in the lore of these old movie monsters, but I do know that Dracula is not just supposed to change back and fourth at will.

Let's start with Dracula; this version of a classic movie monster has to be one of the worst of all times. He's completely silly and not convincing at all. The actor Richard Roxburgh is perhaps the lamest Dracula I have ever seen. He is truly awful and uninspired. Let's hope this guy finds his nitch playing bad guys in straight to video Richard Grieco action flicks. What's a matter the production couldn't afford Julian Sands? Not to mention these Dracula's have gaping mouths, which look completely silly. The Count has 3 female servants; they are so over the top and downright horrible. They scream and shriek, for what is basically  of the entire picture.

Frankenstein is another atrocity. His silly sympathetic character is truly awful. His look is downright comical. He Did nothing in this movie to make it any more enjoyable. How can a thing made up of seven different people, swing from cables with all the dexterity of Tarzan?

The accents by everyone involved were horrible. I expected better of Kate Bekinsale. While looking extremely hot, it was not enough to make me care about her boring character spewing out this horrible dialogue that is given to her. I understand why Hugh Jackman took the role. I think he has about 12 lines in the entire film, and probably made about 10 million dollars. We can't expect him to just sit around waiting for X-Men sequels.

When I see a movie I understand what it means to ""suspend disbelief"", but the logic (if you can call it that) is not even based in reality in the slightest. There are moments that look like they are right out of a video game, including 1st person shooter perspectives. Not to mention the moments that look like they are paying tribute to some of Warner Brothers best Willie Coyote cartoons, compliments of The Wolf man characters (yes there is more than one). Not to mention that the ending is so bad that it does not even make you forgive the rest of the film. The worst part of all at a mere 2 hours this film feels like it will NEVER END!!!

This film is easily one of the more disappointing films I have ever seen. I didn't even pay for it...I saw it free, and still felt like I was ripped off. After walking out the crowd had a collective feeling of ""What did we just see""-type vibe. VH ruins any love one had for these movie monsters. Universal should be ashamed for green-lighting such a piss poor product, that basically spits on anything they have accomplished in the past. I think the saddest part of all this is the amount of money 15 year olds will spend to see this movie, it will actually garner a sequel. This movie is not even a fun bad movie; I can enjoy a fun bad movie. It's a shame when films like this receive so much attention and a much better movie get lost in the shuffle (i.e Sky Captain and the World of TOmorrow).

The only thing that would have saved this movie is if it were completely animated by a non Disney company. Something of a cool dark look. Then the movie would be great. I could buy the things that happen in this film if it were a cartoon.

Any comparison to Indiana Jones is completely inaccurate. How dare these people compare a FILM CLASSIC with this piece of crap? The creators of VH do not have near the passion invested that is involved with even the first 15 minutes of ""Raiders"". Please do not drag this feces that is VH anywhere near Indiana Jones. The mainstream films today are not made by passionate filmmakers, these are corporate ""yes"" men getting paid to crank out these expensive ""kiddie"" flicks instead of putting heart and soul into great works that will actually be remembered after 2 weeks. Next time I will go with my gut instinct and stay away from movies where even the trailer looks like it sucks.",1097452800,2,4533,4.502433090024331
2102457,3,B0002KVUKW,"WHY YOU SHOULD GO SEE THIS:

With its spectacular gothic sets, impressive special effects and revved up, albeit thin and stretched, plot, Van Helsing is a fun, summer romp. You have not seen Dracula's castle until you see what the set designers came up with for this film. While the leads are busy slaughtering legions of vile and hideous creatures, the supporting cast carries the film with their wit and charm. Friar Carl is a pompous, intellectual and a coward, but you can't help but snicker when he and Frankenstein's monster bicker and argue like a married couple. The adroit Igor is played by Kevin J. O'Connor (Benny from The Mummy)who has made being an obsequious toady with a wise guy edge into an art form. At one point, Count Dracula chastises Igor for unnecessarily tormenting a chained Wolfman to which Igor insouciantly replies, ""Hey, it's what I do.""

WHY YOU SHOULD PASS:

Dracula. Check. Frankenstein. Check. Wolfman. Check. Brides of Dracula. Check. Mr. Hyde pretending to be the Hunchback of Notre Dame. Check. Smart-mouthed, henchman, Igor. Check. Ultra-secret society devoted to the extermination of monsters headed by the Catholic Church with their high-tech, James Bondesque headquarters under the Vatican. Check. Super-hunky hero, wise-cracking comic-relief side-kick and buxom, leather-clad heroine. Check. By the numbers, everything seems to be in place, but this hyper-paced, CGI-pumped movie delivers only action and not much in the way of plot. It is a tale told for action-loving idiots, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. This is a very loud, very noisy and very fast-paced film. It is the cinematic equivalent to 2 hours of relentless orgasms without the benefit of foreplay. By the end, you are physically spent and emotionally unfulfilled. If you like to cuddle with your films before consummating the film-going experience, then you had best abstain from this one.

2102458,4,B0002KVUKW,"One of the things that I thought was amazing about the early reviews were they seemed to miss the fact that this is was a PARODY, a take off of cheesy monster movies from the 50's. Like Frankenstein vs the Wolfman, or Zombies Ate My Neighbors.

The movie is about Van Helsing. A man who is being employed by a secret service like organization to hunt down supernatural menaces. In his first encounter he is hunting down the evil Mr Hyde, and to try to get Dr Jeckyl back alive. The order is a mixture of priests and monks of seemingly every faith on the planet, all banding together to save humanity from dark forces.

He is paired with an inventor and a monk named Carl(David Wenham, Faramir in LOTR). Though he can swear and womanize since, he is not a monk yet. They are sent on a mission to Eastern Europe, which not only suffers from Werewolves but Vampires. He brings a host of odd high tech weapons to fight the supernatural with. They are in the steam punk genre; automatic crossbows, crank powered saws, etc....

It turns out that there is more than they expected. Count Vladislaus Dracula is working on animating his children, thousands and thousands of them, who lie dormant. He uses lightening, but for some reason the energy given to them is never quite right, and they die soon after. There is also some tie between him and Dracula, one that goes far back that he doesn't remember.

This movie was so ridiculous it bordered on genius. The plot makes little sense, the acting is over the top and at times purposefully bad, and the plot devices are shamelessly obvious. In other words, it is the movie you watch with beer and lots of junk food.

Hopefully there will be a sequel",1097193600,2,1690,4.49185667752443

Anyone that wants a serious horror movie may find this silly. It was meant to be outragious but I certainly didn't think it was silly. This is more fun to watch than several horror movies I have seen. Plenty of action and CGI effects make it visually great. The acting is decent and the directing and music are okay as well. All-in-all a good action/adventure that has a good pace, wonderful effects, and a good story.

2102461,4,B0002KVUKW,"I really think that many reviewers missed the boat on this one.  C'mon, it was shtick, was old Hollywood, and there were numerous ""moments"" that everyone seemed to miss.

Did you see the ""Bacardi Bat"" the first time Dracula transformed?  Am I the only person who laughed when I saw Dracula's helpers and said, ""Look!  It's evil Ewocs!""?  (That's obviously what happens when ewocs turn to the Dark side of the Force!)  I had a blast watching this movie.  To enjoy this movie you have to watch it knowing that it was a tribute to the old Hollywood Movies, that Dracula was over-the-top for a reason (I loved the fact that he was so over the top!), etc.

My only complaint with the movie was the last segment.  They went a little too far in the end with the unbelievability and that burst the wonderful bubble they had built.  Personally, I hope they make another one - without that kind of an unbelievable ending.",1096761600,10,911,4.5

It's actually so boring I haven't seen the end of the movie yet, and I don't care who wins, who dies, nor how...

2102474,1,B0002KVUKW,"After seeing Kate Beckinsdale in Underworld, and Hugh Jackman as Wolverine in the X-Men movies, I went to this film with bright optimism.  I even enjoyed the Mummy movies, so I thought this movie with it's stars and budget couldn't fail, but boy was I wrong.

The movies started out inspiringly with Van Helsing chasing after Hyde.  The movie has so many plot holes.  If the only thing that can kill Dracula is a werewolf, why keep one around. I mean he's invicible, so why does he need an overgrown german shepard.  Also, what's with the eggs.  I mean talk about taking liberties with a legendary figure such as Dracula.  Vampires don't have children, by definition once you become a vampire, you stop aging. So what's the point of having little baby vampires.  Although these things didn't look remotely human at all. They had to pay Jackman and Beckinsdale so much money that they couldn't afford a decent actor for Dracula.  I mean the guy was absolutely terrible.  A good villain is almost more important to a movie than the hero, for example, The Mummy had a good villain, Die Hard had a good villain, Kill Bill had good villains, you get the idea. The movie really lost me when Van Helsing pulls out his automatic crossbow with an infinite amount of bolts.  The movie takes place during a time when people are still using swords.  That weapon doesn't even exist today.

I could go on and on about the shortcomings about this movie but I think I am wasting my time. I went with my friends niece who is 14 and she loved this film and hated Spiderman 2. There in lies the difference between those who love this movie and those who hate this movie. Spiderman 2 had a good story, character development, emotional depth, and good acting to go along with the action sequences.  Van Halsing had just the latter, action, action, action, action and more action without any substance. If you are young and just want some mindless fun, than you might enjoy this movie.  If you like your action movies with some substance, rent X-men 2, or wait for Spiderman 2.

Also, they might show this movie at film school on how not to waste 150 million dollars.",1096329600,9,2145,4.561357702349869

2102476,1,B0002KVUKW,"""Van Helsing"" is another movie based on a comic hero. With the success of Spider-man, I expected it to be as quality and emotive as ""Spider-man."" However, the crude visual effects, weak plot, and poor acting proved stark otherwise.

The whole movie looks very dark, so the flashing sparkles are extremely uncomfortable to watch. Worse still, the effects look intolerable since they simply lack beauty and elegance. If images of monsters are deliberately created to be terrifying, there is also art to it that could have beautified them.

Some minor plots, such as Van Helsing's mysterious identity, could have been extended to add some appeal to the awful movie. I personally think that a few scenes of Van Helsing agonizing over his confusion might have very much aroused viewers' identification. Also, more information on Anna Valerious' doomed heritage could have been discussed as well if the movie is filmed to entertain the audience.

Both Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale are brilliant actors to be if they had not starred in this low cast movie. Owing to the unbearable flaws mentioned above, even a player proficient as Tom Hanks can never salvage it, let alone the two.

To sum up, the movie is one of the worst superhero movies I have ever seen. Being so uninspired and almost gruesome, I would recommend ""Spider-man"" instead.",1095897600,4,1337,4.982062780269058

Full of hair-raising special effects, Van Helsing is fast-paced and fun to watch.  But the weaknesses were mainly semi-weak plot with Dracula being portrayed by a B-movie actor.

But I'll be buying it mainly because I dig Hugh Jackman and Stephen Sommer's style of movie making.  I hope he just get's grittier stuff than the Mummy type movies.  I liked Van Helsing better than the Mummy movies myself, because the look of this film and it's pacing were excellent.

2102479,4,B0002KVUKW,"This movie has amazing special effects and borrows from a lot of the action movie directing that is currently in vogue.  Jackman is very likable as a monster hunter hired by the church to eliminate all supernatural creatures and some man-made (Mr. Hyde, Frankenstein's monster).

After disposing of a giant Mr. Hyde in London, Jackman is sent to Transylvania to battle the evil Count Dracula.  There he meets up with a beautiful vampire slayer who is also after Dracula for turning her brother into a werewolf. However, she is reluctant to go after him because the townspeople are content to keep status quo with Dracula.  Dracula and his vampire wives periodically feed on the townfolk to satisfy their urges as long as the townfolk don't hunt them.  Any actions by the townfolk against the vampires would result in terrible retribution.

Van Helsing battles Dracula's wives who swoop and dart through the air around the town while Van Helsing is shooting a ""machine gun"" type bow and arrow.  The special effects of these scenes are amazing.

Later, Van Helsing does battle with Dracula with the help of a werewolf and the Frankenstein monster.

We later learn that Dracula can only be killed in one way (that way is revealed late in the movie) but that way is super risky.  Meanwhile Dracula is unleashing a plan to launch a vampire army to take over the world.  It is up to Van Helsing, his beautiful slayer, and Frankenstein to defeat him and time is running out.

2102506,3,B0002KVUKW,"'Van Helsing' is from the director Stephen 'The Mummy' Sommers, and that means, you get lots of actions, mostly CGI-enhanced ones, with lots of monsters, plus silly dialogues.  You don't find any emotional depth or realisitic characterization here, and those who have seen his films -- any of them -- would not try to find them.

The central idea of 'Van Helsing' goes like this -- Hugh Jackman is the titular vampire hunter with a powered-crossbow, who hunts down the monsters, working for the Catholic Church.  and as this is a Universal Picture, most of them were once the features of the Universal horror pictures in the 30s and 40s.  You see werewolf, Jykell and Hyde, and Dracula himself, the last one played by awfully campy Richard Roxburgh.  And of course, he comes with three females with fangs.

That's it, and that's all.  Helsing fights against them, and meets beautiful Anna, played by Kate Beckinsale, a princess who teams up with Helsing.

From the opening black-and-white shots which is a homage to Universal horror classics, 'Helsing' never stops, showing the fights after fights against the backdrop of Gothic archtectures.  Each scene is finished with first-rate CGI techniques, but the jaded eyes which have seen too many of them would see them with less surprises.

It is clear that Hugh Jackman is the best choice for the role, and so is Beckinsale, but it is Shuler Hensetey who would really impress you, as the Frankenstein's tragic monster.  And as for the story about the two leads, I am afraid that the ending will not satisfy all of you.

The story is long and confusing, and as to its emotional side the film remains hollow to the end, but there are actions enough for us to keep on watching, especialy the one including the Hulk-like enemy, and one extended fighting against the flying vampires.

2102508,2,B0002KVUKW,"This is what I was wondering as I left the theatre after spending what seemed like six hours of this loud, absurd, trite, head-ache inducing crapola.

I'm not even going to recount the plot, mostly because I'd prefer not to try and remember.  Van Helsing of course is the vampire-hunter from the novel Dracula.  Wrong, Van Helsing was a professor:  ""who knows as much about obscure diseases as any one in the world...  He is a philosopher and a metaphysician, and one of the most advanced scientists of his day; and he has... an absolutely open mind... for his views are as wide as his all-embracing sympathy."" (pg 147-8, Penguin Books, 1993).  Van Helsing is a character invented to be a vessel of both science and compassion, truly multi-faceted, inhabiting the realms of heart and mind equally.  In the novel Dracula he is the voice of misreason and reason, hard answers and soft words, and bridges the world between Victorian humanism and Gothic mysticism.

In the movie Van Helsing, he is none of these things.  He's a guy in a big hat, overcoat, boots, grisly face, kills monsters, and has no depth whatsoever.  I imagine most people will call this the film taking liberties for name-sake only, and as such, does not invite a true comparison with the original Van Helsing.  Whatever, I'm trying to defend one of the truly memorable characters in living literature.

The characters around him latch onto this atmosphere of superficiality and voila, we have movie.

You'll probably hear a lot of reviewers giving it five bloody stars, talking about how Stephen Sommers wanted to homage the classic B-movies of old; the endless Dracula movies, the Horror of Frankenstein, the Curse of the Mummies, the Ride of the Zombies, etc etc etc.  The problem with homaging these movies are that they are crap to begin with, and any homage has to find some kind of formula in them to mimic.  The only formula here, folks, is the studio's desire to make big money off of a crappy film.

So go ahead and buy the DVD.  Buy it just to see if you'll end up repeating what I was saying a few months ago.  Why do we allow the film industry to inflict these wastes of time on us?  I wouldn't have a problem with this film if it wasn't such a blatant attempt to simply make money.

Update, Sept. 10: 1 out of 4 people like the review.  Too bad, this is a movie for morons.

2102509,1,B0002KVUKW,"I saw this film the first weekend it came out at perhaps hte best single screen theatre in Wash. D.C. ; the Uptown. It has the best of everrything so that any film that uses all that makes film a grand performance is given the full treatment. Saw each of the "" Lord of the rings"" trilogy and each was an audio/visual concert.

  Then along came this over-indulged piece over of self-indulgent mindless cartoon-character joke of filmmaking showing of how to waste over $100 million.

This was the equivalent of the Micheal Cimino debacle after making the masterpiece "" The Deer Hunter"" got too much money with no questions asked and gave birth to the budget-bloated largesse that was"" Heaven's Gate"".

 Well welcome to "" Van Helsing'sGate"". To think of the possible worthy filmmaking projects , with much smaller budgets ,that got short shrift in order to launch this beached whale on Hollywood market-spawn is heart-breaking beyongd words.

 All I can say is that only  , upon going to the last  showing of the night , one third of the way into the film the poor acting of even more amateurish scripting finally tipped me over the edge and I began what graduated into relentless , uncontrolable laughter and *no one* in the balcony could bring themselves to tell me to be quiet. They knew what they were witnessing and paid good opening weekend money to do so.

 At one point I started to laugh tears and had to get up to go to the rest room to head off laughing myself wet elsewhere. Upon returning to my seat one of friends turned to me and ,by seeing the look on my face , realized the uselessness of even bothering to tell me that I didn't miss a thing. Didn't matter because it just got evermore outrageously ridiculous while being hopelessly stupid & mindlessly awful.

  Bottomline: The entire film can summed up by my first impression of what I , and most of the audience by that last quarter , had just laughed through ; namely it was as if some studio gave $100 million to National Lampoon to totally rip into over-bloated Special Effects gothic Horror/Adventure films which serves only as another ILM sfx demo reel. This made "" League of Extra-Ordinary Gentlemen"" look like polished work

of art.

The *only* reason for any star at all ,  sharing with ILM demo reel fx, was that it was so bad that it was hilarious...for that moment. This does *not* make it worth owning.

*Strongly recommended as a *Rent first* DVD. The spontaneous laughter of the theatre showing was out of desperation in trying to salvage something of an experience out of this collasal waste of 2 hours and over $100 million.

 And after it was all over and we thought we could collectively catch  our breath we  were hit with that last finishing touch that stole whatever breath we had caught. After that bloated fiasco of a film the director put into the credits a dedication to "" You, Dad"" which ,considering what we had all just sat through, demanded the response "" Boy , he sure must have mad at his Father"".

 I'm sorry , but this film is the poorest of bad jokes that's funny only for how spectacularly it utterly fails. And this was made by supposed professionals. I'm afraid leaving one's mind outside the box office is becoming too much of the common national pastime and unfortunately

makes excuses for the next round of thuroughly mindless largesse.

Why encourage this. Let's disasterous box office failure be a lesson to the makers of this utter circus of thoroughly mindless nonsense.

This movie was good in that it captured the monster movies of yesteryears and brought them into the 21st century in special effects. Violence you say,thats what you need with this type movie. Graphic violence is what this type of movie thrives on. Van Helsing could be much better if they had put more effort in the story(Had room to make it longer)more detail behind the plot. This story will continue. Hopefully Mr Jackman will play the part again. I can't think of anyone who could fill his shoes in this story. It seams the second movie out shines the first these days.

Van Helsing isn't young, he's old. In the movie he looks like a mix of Spiderman, James Bond, Men in Black and Batman.

I am looking forward to the release of this DVD...as are my kids! It will be a welcome addition to our collection of ""monster movies"". I'm sure Mr. Karloff himself would whole-heartedly approve.",1092873600,17,632,4.91588785046729
2102528,4,B0002KVUKW,"A Word To The Critics: If you're not into the genre, don't rate the film. This movie was panned so badly by every conceivable movie critic (except Ebert), it's a wonder anyone went to see it at all.  The only people qualified to comment on how good/bad a movie is should only be done by people who enjoy that kind of movie. It was very obvious that the same boring people who thought ""Moulin Rouge"" was the best thing since ""The Piano"", should not go see a horror movie. They don't have a background to judge it.  They should leave that sort of thing to the people who get into it --- like me!!

I love a good horror movie. Especially a good vampire/monster movie. And when you have more than one . . . all I need is a bag of popcorn, a superlarge drink and some Milk Duds and my afternoon is set!!  This was not Oscar material, but it was a great vampire/monster movie.  I made it a point not to watch too many ads so I'd be genuinely surprised at the characters and the developing plot line.

I have a great many gay friends, so I feel at liberty to say this next statement. Dracula was a flaming queen.  I was left to wonder which of his minion was the ""father"" of all those bat babies. It surely wasn't him. All he needed was some blue eye shadow and a gown and he surely would have passed as queen of the ball.  I think a stronger Dracula presence was needed in the film --- of course, in casting, why wouldn't you have a more unassuming Dracula character, deceiving in his fopishness, while stronger and more ruthless than anyone could imagine?  Why not indeed.  So maybe it was a good choice after all.

The vampire brides were deliciously wicked. I think they were actually the highlight of the film.  When the first bat babies started dying in mid-flight, the girls' expressions and agony were comic yet tragic. I literally loved seeing them suffer!! The Frankenstein monster was a great pick as well.  He showed great humanity through the makeup.

Of course, the stoic Jackman made a picture perfect Van Helsing. All business, no nonsense at first -- and then they humanize him after his wolfman encounter.  Very effective characterization.  In fact, each character (except Dracula) seemed custom-fitted to their roles. I sort of expected a dreary overcast backdrop for most of the movie, but was pleasantly surprised to see plenty of light so the CGI effects could be shown with maximum intensity and clarity.  It was good stuff. The transformation sequences were excellent;  some of the best of recent memory and on a par with ""The Mummy"" and ""X-Men"" effects.

In all, you get what you expect with this flick and more. But if you go in looking for the existential meaning of the inner core of humanity, forget it. This ain't that movie.  If you want to see a vampire movie with a twist or two, a werewolf movie with at least one plot line developed, a Frankenstein movie that doesn't degrade the intent of the original and a vampire hunter movie that doesn't disappoint, then you can get all four movies in one with this one.

Why 4 stars instead of 5??  Because it's hard to develop a movie from a comic book and keep the storyline and plot development on a par with a made for film story. There are some gaps here and there but that doesn't make it a bad movie.

Will I buy it when it comes out?  Of course.",1092873600,3,3321,4.415435139573071

2102530,4,B0002KVUKW,"I was pleasently surprised when I saw ""Van Helsing"" in the theaters. After reading all of the bad reviews (save for Roger Ebert, who loved it) I was a little worried that the movie was going to be as bad as everyone said it was. But instead, I was treated to a good summer-action flick with mindless action and lots of explosions. Why can't people just enjoy summer movies? Why do they have to criticize everything? I mean, come one, it's not going to win any Oscars so just enjoy this little piece of brain candy. The best part of the movie was Richard Roxburgh's Dracula. He was so cool!

However, towards the end of the movie, approaching what should be the climax, I found myself nodding off...over, and over again. Make no mistake, I wasn't tired, just tired of this movie. I suppose it was how every fight was designed the EXACT same way (Hugh Jackman gets hit hard, gets up, proceeds to stomp villian arse, repeat), or the absence of those elements vital to a good movie, such as plot and cohesion of said plot, but by the end of this movie, I was just plain bored.

2102533,2,B0002KVUKW,I love these kind of movies but I was somewhat disappointed with van helsing.  First off when the movie starts off it seams like some sort of spoof film based on the old frankenstein movie.  Once the black and white section ends it starts to get a little better.  The most disappointing part about the movie I thought was the dracula character.  He had a very poor stage presence which made his character very dull.

2102537,5,B0002KVUKW,"Stephen Sommers (writer and director) creates another blockbuster hit along with the ""Mummy"" movies. The movie, Van Helsing takes you and the audience on a wild rollercoaster ride. The storyline takes place during the late 1880s in Transylvania. Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) and his three brides have ruled over the land for many years. Meanwhile, Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) and his assistant, Carl (David Wenham) travel to this forbidden land and they are sent to help Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale), the last of the Valerious family. Together, they fight against Dracula and even the Wolfman, who is Anna's brother, Velkan (Will Kemp). They also meet Frankenstein's monster (Shuler Hensley), who they need to help protect from Dracula, so that his plan fails. Besides the story along, there are many HUGE special effects, and even some sad and secret surprises. Sommers makes the audience see the Universal monsters reborn before your very eyes. This movie is the best summer blockbuster starter of the year!",1092009600,8,1010,5.2407407407407405
2102538,5,B0002KVUKW,"In 1999 director Steven Sommers presented the hit movie THE MUMMY to movie audiences (which opened to an amazing weekend take of $43 million May 7th). With so much success a sequel THE MUMMY RETURNS (2001) was inevitable.
Sommers, a big fan of the classic Universal monster/horror movies made the movie as a homage to the earlier Universal movies and in 2004 he paid tribute to the other staples of the genre -Wolfman, Dracula and Frankenstein's monster - all in one movie. The movie VAN HELSING even had Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde in a cameo role at the outset of the movie fighting famed monster hunter Van Helsing - portrayed by Hollywood star Hugh Jackman.
Ignore what you may have read or heard about the movie, it's a thrill ride of a rollercoaster of a movie that owes more than a tip of the hat to both the Indiana Jones and James Bond franchises. The movie never lets up, traveling along at breakneck speed right to its tumultuous, suspenseful, wrist-clenching climax.
The movie opens in 1887 and follows legendary vampire hunter Gabriel Van Helsing as he travels to the mysterious land of Transylvannia - home to his most famed opponent Count Dracula and a land that has been overrun by werewolves and vampires.
Prior to his departure we have a scene unabashedly influenced by the Q-scenes from the James Bond series. Equipped with such `futuristic' weaponry and gadgets as an automatic `machine gun' style crossbow, Van Helsing, with comic relief Carl (played by David Wenham) as his bumbling assistant in tow, heads to investigate the reports coming out of eastern Europe.
Upon arrival Van Helsing meets Anna Valerious (played by the impossibly gorgeous Kate Beckinsale). Valerious is the last member of a family that is under a curse that can only be broken by the death of Dracula. After some initial mistrust Valerious realizes that Van Helsing shares her goal of defeating the evil count and the two enter into an alliance.
I admit that my initial interest in the movie was sparked by the involvement of Beckinsale. A fan of the British actress since I noticed her alongside Clare Danes in BROKEDOWN PALACE, I have enjoyed a number of her movies (SEREDIPITY and UNDERWORLD) and had to endure some terrible movies (PEARL HARBOR and TIPTOES). Thankfully VAN HELSING falls squarely in the positive column and ranks unquestionably as my favorite Beckinsale movie to date. She gives an excellent and stirring performance as a determined fighter of the monsters that inhabit her land.
Opposing Van Helsing, Carl and Valerious is one of the all-time best screen portrayals of Dracula in Richard Roxburgh. Roxburgh is simply superb and steals every scene he is in with his deliciously evil rockstar take on the character. Aiding Dracula are his three vampire brides (Josie Maran, Silvia Colloca and Elena Anaya) who fly around the country doing his bidding - the interplay between the three I found to be constantly entertaining. Also under the spell of the count is Wolf man (Will Kemp), a character Van Helsing has sworn to kill, but one which causes some emotional drama for Valerious and an interesting subplot for the movie.
With a budget of $148 million, Universal really threw a lot of effort into this movie and it shows. A total of 980 special effects accompanies some well honed action scenes, amazing stunts and sumptious costume design in a movie that really delivers the goods. It's an incredible trip that will leave you breathless until the end credits roll.
This movie was criticized widely for its improbable script. Yes, it's a B-movie script but then it is supposed to be. It's a homage to the black and white Universal classics. That's what you go expecting to see, only with updated special effects and a larger budget. In those respects this movie is a triumph. Sit back and enjoy and remember those wonderful Lon chaney and Bela Lugosi movies of yesteryear. This movie isn't one that works if you try to overthink it. It's fun and played to be fun.
Delivering possibly two of their best performances is Jackman and Beckinsale and I really felt a chemistry between the stars, easily more so than Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz in the two MUMMY movies. Sommers sets his story against a spectacular scenic backdrop that worked for me as far more breathtaking than  the desert vistas of Sommers most famous earlier work.
VAN HELSING is an achievement and my favorite movie of 2004. I am eagerly awaiting the release of the widescreen anamorphic DVD on Oct. 19 in a release that Universal has understandably seen fit to shower with special features. Including two audio commentaries, a 360-degree tour of Dracula's castle, You are in the Movie, the tantalizingly titled `The Legend of Van Helsing' and (perhaps most enticing) some deleted scenes, October cannot come soon enough.
I'm hoping for a VAN HELSING 2, but even if one doesn't get made at least I will have this immensely entertaining movie to enjoy.
Well recommended.
 Be aware that the studio will also be releasing an Ultimate Edition DVD on the same day. This three-disc set will also include the classic horror movies DRACULA (1931), FRANKENSTEIN (1931) and THE WOLF MAN (1941).
Other special features included on the Ultimate Edition are: 'VAN HELSING, THE STORY, THE LIFE THE LEGEND'; 'TRACK THE ADVENTURE: VAN HELSING'S MAP'; 'THE MUSIC OF VAN HELSING' and 'DARKNESS FALLS: DRACULA'S LAIR IS TTRANSFORMED.'

It is a fantasy thrill ride, and a must see for anyone that loves the genre!  I thought it was the best vampire movie I have seen to date, and I have seen most of them.  This movie is pure fun, and should be viewed as such!  Hugh Jackman, and Kate Beckinsale bring a very energetic, and fresh feel to the whole genre, that I truly appreciated.

But anyway, for me, Dracula made the movie worth going to see for a second time. Campy - yes, dramatic - yes.... I'm not going to write a big long literary review of why the Dracula character worked the way it did because everyone has their opinions, suffice to say he got my thumbs up :)",1091318400,3,484,4.204301075268817
2102552,4,B0002KVUKW,"Don't go into this film expecting oscar material. If you throw this movie on with the expectation of a fun remix of old monster movies with much improved effects, then you are going to love it!

 Stephen Sommers does it again. If you liked ""The Mummy"", you are going to love ""Van Helsing"". Beginning with the most famous scene for the original ""Frankenstein"", this film dives into all the old favorite monster movies combined into one story. There are quite a few scenes with the ""Yeah, right..."" factor (such as the automatic ""machine gun"" crossbow, and the horsedrawn carrage jumping a destroyed 50' span of bridge), but like I say, as with many of the '50's movie, if you just turn off your brain and enjoy this film for what it is, you are going to have a good time. The effects are great, and the story is about a ""B"" rating. IF you are a fan of old monster movies like myself, this film is well worth the price. If you are one of those geeks that likes to pick apart everything, or is expecting ""Lord of the Rings"" grade story material to accompany the top notch special effects, you may want to skip it. This is a Summer(Sommer) fun movie, noting more, nothing less.",1091232000,17,1173,4.425925925925926
2102553,5,B0002KVUKW,"Obviously this movie got mixed reviews. Either viewers loved or hated it. I cannot understand the hate. First of all, this was a typical Stephen Sommers film - you take a film classic and remake it with sarcasm, better effects, and you poke fun at the campiness of it all. Apparently some people were expecting something more gothic, or serious, or historically accurate. Well, guess what? That has been done to death - no pun intended. What Sommers does here is far more entertaining: he takes these great characters of European Folklore, and he attempts create a nineteenth century world where they actually live, and attempt to intermingle with civilization. It's an amusing concept, or like Dracula says ""Why can't people just leave us alone? We never kill more than our share!"" I think, actually, the humor in this film and its actual folkloric parallels may have been over the heads of many viewers. Based on the reviews, those that hated it obviously did not understand or grasp the humor. I do feel that this film presents the best performance of a Dracula character. No, he is not a brooding gothic figure, rather he is an egotistical, sarcastic, obviously flawed individual whose eternal life in the dark fog of Transylvania is beginning to get to him. Bravo to Richard Roxburgh for his treatment of this character! Anyway, if you enjoy a higher-developed dry sense of humor coupled with parodies of folklore (or have any back ground in the actual myths regarding the characters of this film) then you will truly enjoy this film. Mind you, the action scenes stretch the bounds of reality, but then again, so does the existence of a were-wolf, or the Frankenstein Monster. I do enjoy the exchange between Dracula and the were-wolf, who in the form of a man is a noble chivalrous soul, and upon hearing of Dracula's plans declares that he would ""rather die!"" Dracula's response? ""Oh, don't be boring. Everyone who says that dies."" Enjoy!!!",1091059200,4,1947,4.84984984984985
2102554,1,B0002KVUKW,"I had great expectations for this film.  I loved Deep Rising and both Mummy movies, am a devoted fan of the Universal Classic monsters, and think Hugh Jackman is a fine actor.  Unfortunately, I was severely disappointed with Van Helsing.  Sommers overloaded his film with entirely too much cartoony CGI, the acting was so overblown and melodramatic that any opportunity for decent characterization was rendered inert, the dialogue was ridiculous, and the main character failed at nearly everything he attempted.  This Van Helsing was supposed to be a Victorian butt-kicker, but instead ended up as little more than a whipping boy, and that is where this film's greatest weakness lies.  If you want to see Hugh Jackman portray a capable hero, then watch either of the X-Men movies instead.  If you want monsters, then watch the original Universal Classics or the 50s Hammer films.  If you want a cartoony CGI nightmare, then by all means, watch Van Helsing. F-",1090886400,4,959,4.9937106918239
2102555,5,B0002KVUKW,It was so good. Yes the plot was not really there but still the action was great. The movie did look good. I loved the guy who play Dracula.

2102556,5,B0002KVUKW,"Two of my favorite screen talents, Hugh Jackman (The ""X-Men"" films) and Kate Beckinsale (""Underworld"") team up in the thrilling box-office extravaganza, ""Van Helsing""! I saw the movie about a couple of days after it was released, and to me, the film was nothing short of extraordinary! Like portraying Wolverine in the ""X-Men"" films, Hugh Jackman brings a sheer intensity into the role of Van Helsing. Surely, Jackman's best since ""Swordfish"" and ""X-Men 1 and 2""! Kate Beckinsale's performance, however, was dynamic and brilliant! Basically, her flawless performance in this film, which is her best performance since ""Underworld"", shows us once again why she is Kate Beckinsale! The direction of Stephen Sommers (""The Mummy"", ""The Mummy Returns"") was intense and utterly magnificent!

 ""Van Helsing"" takes place in 1887 and focuses on famed monster hunter Gabriel Van Helsing (Jackman). After hunting down Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde in the streets of London, Van Helsing is assigned to travel to Transylvania, a mysterious region that is overrun with dangerous creatures like werewolves and vampires. Joining Van Helsing is his bumbling assistant, Carl (David Wenham, ""The Lord of the Rings"" films). Once there, Van Helsing must fight the tyrannical ruler, Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh, ""Moulin Rouge""), his blood-sucking brides (Elena Anaya, Josie Maran, Silvia Colloca), and the Wolf Man (Will Kemp). During the mission, Van Helsing meets Anna Valerious (Beckinsale), a woman whose royal family is suffering under an age-old curse that can only be broken when the infamous count is put to death. Van Helsing also forms an alliance with Frankenstein's monster (Shuler Hensley) to prevent Dracula from hatching his bat-winged progeny, thus wreaking havoc all over the world!

 With ""Van Helsing"" having so much good-humored action, suspense at every twist and turn, a great cast, and mesmerizing special effects, you're guaranteed to be both thrilled and exhausted by the time the 10-minute end credits roll at the film's end! The film is loud, obnoxious, and filled with revisionist horror folklore (especially with the fact that Universal is paying homage to the classic horror monsters, including Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, and The Wolf Man). Nevertheless, this colossal monster mash (including Mr. Hyde, just for kicks) will never, ever bore you. All I have to say is bring on ""Van Helsing 2""! In conclusion, if you are a avid horror fan, or just a big Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale fan, like I am, then look no further than ""Van Helsing""! A DVD must-have when released!",1090627200,4,2579,5.282926829268293
2102557,3,B0002KVUKW,"Another summer season has come upon us at the box office with many major releases opening within its first few weeks all in an effort to gather as much coinage as they possibly can before Spider-Man 2 steamrolls its way into theaters. Anything after that film better be pretty damn good to compete with it but that is another topic for another day. Prior to 1999 the summer season kicked off around Memorial Day weekend as children began to slowly be released from schools across the country but that was before The Mummy opened to $43 million the weekend of May 7th, 1999, which, in effect, changed the way studios dealt with the summer heat. In the two years that followed, both Gladiator (2000) and The Mummy Returns (2001) opened on the first weekend of May to fantastic numbers but that never became the official kick-off point for the summer until Spider-Man sealed the deal in 2002, opening to $115 million its opening weekend. Universal studios doesn?t expect that much with the opening of Van Helsing but they do expect a decent return as it is not often that they shell out $160 million (and then some) for one film especially in the current situation they are in with their new parent company. But considering Stephen Sommers, the same man who directed The Mummy and its sequel, is at that reins, there?s a sure bet the cult followers will be out in droves once again.

The story follows the adventures a man sent by a secret society to go out into the world to vanquish evil creatures such as the Wolfman, Frankenstein?s monster, and Dracula and stop their reins of terror on humanity. Van Helsing is known throughout most of Europe, either as a holy man or as a murderer, but the man behind God?s work has no memory of who he is or where he comes from. All he knows is that he is in the service of the Catholic Church sent to different parts of the world to stop evil in the form of monsters and demons. There?s nothing in the job description about being well liked by the people he is trying to protect. His latest assignment is to travel to Transylvania to destroy the powerful Count Dracula while at the same time protect Anna Valerious, the last of her family?s lineage who had sworn to do anything in their power to destroy Dracula and end his rein of terror. But Dracula has a plan of his own ? he devises a course of action in using Frankenstein?s monster as well as the Wolfman in his efforts to raise up a force of bat-like children to rule over humanity with fear and terror. There?s only one man who stands in his way, who has the force of God on his side: Van Helsing. The story for Van Helsing is hard to really grasp but not in the sense you would think. The film isn?t a real puzzler or anything of that nature (Good vs. Evil ? not much to figure out here) but one does have to have a tolerance for campy action flicks or else this will be a complete waste of time. Though the film is clich?d at moments, surprisingly it wasn?t so much as was to be expected, if that helps at all to those who disliked The Mummy films.

No one may actually be going into this film for the sole purpose of seeing any particular star within it, which is probably the reason why there are only two (one if you want to get into specifics) big names in the cast, but none the less the cast of Van Helsing offers some decent performances, nothing Oscar caliber by any means, while at the same presenting several prominent disappointments. Hugh Jackman, who is best known for his performance of Wolverine in the X-Men film series, gives an engaging performance as Abraham Van Helsing, though no where near the one given by Sir Anthony Hopkins in Bram Stoker?s Dracula, which was to be expected. The only problem lies with the character itself as the script starts off with many questions and yet answers very few of the them by the end, which could or could not point to a possible sequel in the works. Kate Beckinsale, who hasn?t been able to make a name for her self in the sense of truly carrying a film on her name alone just yet, works with what is given to her as best she can but there really isn?t much emotional attachment with the character to be really all that concerned for what happens to her within the course of the film. Though it was Sommer?s intent on resurrecting (in a sense) interest in Dracula, the vision seems to be lost with Richard Roxburgh?s go around as he is way too over-the-top in a way that?s laughable and, at times, confusing. The same would have to go for Dracula?s Brides played Elena Anaya, Silvia Colloca and Josie Maran, who become so irritating in their performances that the audience will be applauding at their demises, and not for the reasons they should be doing so.

Overall, Van Helsing kicks off the 2004 summer box office with more of a whimper then a driving force and only shatters the hopes of those who were awaiting an enthusiastic kick-off as had always been accustomed in the past. As with Hellboy, Van Helsing falls into the category of films that don?t leave you clamoring to see them again nor are they features that you would detest repeating, if they were presented to you again. The first third of the film (dividing the film into three parts) was quite exciting, mysterious, and filled with wall-to-wall action, which makes the other two thirds of the film all the more disappointing. There is nothing as bad as a film that sets you up for quality entertainment only to knock you down with a weak follow-through. The problem lies with the script itself which becomes too bogged down with numerous plot lines and character aspects and quickly deteriorates into a mundane and repetitive camp film. There?s nothing wrong with camp films as long as they are done right, which isn?t the case with Van Helsing. Another issue that was clearly prominent throughout the film was the blatant over-use of CGI effects, which often looked fake, no more so then in the scene where the Wolfman jumps across the fire on the wagon toward Van Helsing or the transformation of Dracula, which just looked ridiculous. And there was a small problem with the musical score, which, every so often, sounded too familiar to the score for The Mummy, but nothing major to complain about. There are three types of people who will be disappointed by this film: fans of the classic novel (and film) Dracula, those who fell for the hype, and all others who aren?t just entertained by a few mere explosions and (...) flashed on the screen. Van Helsing will surely go down as one of the bigger disappointments of the summer season.",1090540800,2,6564,4.51892346509672

2102559,2,B0002KVUKW,"Yes, I admit it! I was sucked in by the hype! I was excited by the concept! I went to see the movie! I came away thoroughly disappointed...

If ever there was a case of 'over-egging the pudding' this is it. The concept of the titular character taking on three of Universal's classic monsters is great! So what do they do? Turn Dracula into a mad scientist, make the wolfman entirely CGI and don't even ask about Frankenstein's creature, his glowing cranium and melodic tenor voice. Throw in Mr Hyde (and Dr Jekyll) who aren't even Universal, Dracula's three Brides (who surprisingly are the best thing in the movie) and Dracula's 'children' (think flying Gremlins) and you begin to see that what we have here is enough plot (and I use the word loosely) to fill a trilogy. Steven Sommers seems to have got carried away with the success of The Mummy movies and lost the plot completely!

The 'human' characters are bland and two dimensional with Jackman's Van Helsing briefly showing promise before being thrown into yet another battle against an evil animated character. That the final battle is between two (rather poorly rendered) CGI characters says it all.

When the best you can say for a film is that the Production Design is good you know you're in trouble. The opening sequence is very promising as it harks back to the good old days. Even then the highlight of the film - a human character looks in a mirror to see her's is the only reflection out of a room full of people - was stolen whole-sale from Polanski's The Fearless Vampire Killers (AKA Dance of the Vampires).

There seems to be a plot twist somewhere, involving Van Helsing and his past relationship with Dracula. When it comes it is so under-whelming as to be embarrassing. It was obviously put in for the (doubtful considering this one' box office performance) sequel. Even if there is a sequel, considering how many major monsters were used up on this one, who can Van Helsing fight against? The Creature from the Black Lagoon? The Invisible Man? King Kong?

I have a belief that special effects should enhance a movie(like the lord of the Rings) but not overpower it.  Money should have been saved on special effects to have a real writer do the story.

 Dr. Van Helsing is a vampire hunter in 1890s London who hunts dangerous vampires and werewolves who hunt and kill innocent victims in England and is now up against Count Dracula, one of the world vampires of all time who has numerous offspring waiting to be hatched and the hatchlings are vampires themselves who will swarm up and terrorize the local population of a local town in Transylvanian. Teaming up with the princess of Transylvania, the last descendant of a royal family, Van Helsing along with his bumbling friend Carl (David Wenham who played Faramir in Lord of The Rings) must destroy Dracula forever before it's too late.
 This movie is really a lot of fun and is an excellent salute to the frankensteinian horror movies of the 1940s through 1960s before the genre got too bloody and excessively gory. In a way, I may never look at Frankenstein the same way again. Definately a movie worth seeing and I can't wait to own this movie on DVD!!",1089331200,8,1209,4.671361502347418
2102574,4,B0002KVUKW,"Stephen Sommer's ""Van Helsing"" is a seriously mis-understood movie.
While admitting that ""Van Helsing"" is not as great as I had hoped, I contend that it is one of the most undeservedly maligned films of the year. The movie has it's flaws (mostly being constructed on an excuse rather than a plot), but a lot of the vitriol aimed at ""Van Helsing"" seems to stem from either 1) a dislike of CGI, 2) the attitude that the monsters should have been Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff and Lon Chaney, Jr. and 3)the fact that the film isn't really a horror movie.
CGI is what it is (and it's used a great deal, arguably to excess) in ""Van Helsing"". But CGI is easily as realistic as most stop-motion. The fact that it looks like CGI is not a fault. Most special effects look like special effects, some just better than others.
As for the monsters, well, Universal's Dracula was never Bram Stoker's Dracula. Their Frankenstein (Doctor and monster) was never Mary Shelly's Frankenstein. Their Wolf Man is not a traditional folk tale werewolf. These characters have never been fixed, but are constantly re-interpreted and re-imagined each time they're used. That's exactly what's been done here. (And for my money Richard Roxburgh's Dracula is outstanding - a cold, calculating, bored immortal. Watch and listen closely and you'll start to hear echoes of Lugosi's Dracula in Roxburgh's performance although their portrayals are worlds apart.)
""Van Helsing"" is NOT a horror film. It was never intended to be. It's an adventure film. The basic purpose here is not to frighten the audience, but to thrill them. The film is not creepy, bloody or frightening and that is by design.
As for my own criticism that the movie uses an excuse rather than a plot, it's no worse or hokey in my book than most of the original Universal monster movies (and I've seen them all many times), just bigger and more elaborate.
I'm old enough to remember when John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" was released to equally undeserved critical and box-office drubbings. People hated it because it 1)wasn't a repeat of the Howard Hawks film (ooh, it was gory and gross and icky and had bad language and didn't have a woman in the cast) and 2)was scary in a summer when aliens were expected to be cute (E.T.). Well, these days nearly everyone considers Carpenter's ""The Thing"" to be a classic.
While ""Van Helsing"" may not be of exactly the same caliber as ""The Thing,"" I believe that in time it will come to be appreciated for what it is just as Carpenter's film has. It's expertly made, visually stunning, and there's never a dull moment.
""Van Helsing"" is essentially ""Indiana Jones starring in House of Dracula"". You'll either get it or you won't. Those who don't will hate it. Those who do will enjoy the ride. And I'll wager that ten years from now many of the detractors will watch it and genuinely wonder why they disliked it so much.",1089331200,9,2886,4.705533596837944

Hugh Jackman was a fine actor to play the lead and Kate Beckinsale was eye candy, her accent pretty much resembled that of Count Dracula from Sesame Street. Director Stephen Sommers abandons a plot and just amazes with visual and special effects.  Sommers's scored big with the ""Mummy"" blockbusters which were enjoyable though the first film was a great deal better.  The dialogue is more than laughable.  The plot I won't even bother to try and explain cause it's that bad.  Pretty much Jackson plays Van Helsiing  a lethal hunter, who kills monsters for a living, soon Beckingsale's character must help him to try and stop Dracula.  Make sense?  Probably not, but it's still enjoyable.  As I said earlier the visual aspect of this film is stunning, the action is nearly non-stop too.
  Van Helsing is rated PG-13 for Non-Stop Creature Action Violence, Frightening Images and for Sensuality.  The violence is pervasive and includes the use of an assortment of Helsing's many sweet weapons such as his cross bow, pistols, etc.  There are also many creepy and frightening montsters (what a shock to find out)  so this film.  The sensuality is nothing explicit, just some sexual innuendo.  Overall a big-budget summer flick (approximately $150 million) which has done well at the box-office.

In this film, Van Helsing is a dashing, athletic and young (but somewhat troubled) monster-slayer (superbly played by Hugh Jackman, who imbues the character with more depth than you'd expect) employed by the Vatican. After squaring off with a rather large Mr. Hyde in Paris, he is sent to a remote village in Transylvania to kill Count Dracula (a delightful Richard Roxburgh, who steals the film) and save the ruling Valerious family from eternal damnation. Unfortunately, only one member of the family remains: Anna (the gorgeous Kate Beckinsale), a worthy warrior in her own right. However, Dracula has been rather busy, harnessing the combined forces of both Frankenstein and the Wolf-man.
This film, like The Mummy flicks, is pure comic-book writ large on screen, and doesn't seem to pause much for breath once it moves to top gear. There are quibbles - there are too many story threads that never really come together and some of the computer graphics are a little hit-and-miss (an awesome attack on the village by the swooping, harpy-like Brides of Dracula excepted)- but Stephen Sommers' skill - as he proved with the gory guilty pleasure Deep Rising - lies in taking the audience on a fantastic roller-coaster ride, with some surprising plot twists and an unexpected ending. The gothic production design is fantastic, and the support cast aid the main trio well (other standouts are David Wenham's eccentric Friar Carl and Kevin J O'Connor's wonderful Igor).

This movies is NOT for the serious movie goers, and if you want Oscar-caliber movie wait until December to hit the theaters.
But if you just want to go to a movie and just be amused and dazzaled by special effects then this is the movie for you. Van Helsing starts off the summer movie season this year with loads of SFX, and as the star of the movie, Hugh Jackman, puts it ""It is a rollar coaster ride from the beginning to the end"" and that is exactly what this movie is.  One action sequence after another, with few plot lines in between. The movie doesn't promise to profoundly affect you nor stimulate your thoughts, and it is not meant to do that.
So I would recommend the movie as a fun-filled summer movie.
Hugh Jackman is amazing as always, I swear there is nothing this actor cannot do.  Kate Beckinsale was beautiful and eqaully great in the action sequences, but her Transylvania accent was quite irritating.

2102602,5,B0002KVUKW,"""Van Helsing"", like ""The Day After Tomorrow"", is a thrill ride, meant to be fun and not taken seriously.  The story starts out with a quick match between Van Helsing and Mr. Hyde, showing us what is typical for a man who hunts down evil monsters who threaten humanity.  Van Helsing's next assignment is to stop Count Dracula and his wicked brides, who are hatching a plan to bring their dead offspring to life.  Once in Transylvania, Van Helsing meets the beautiful vampire fighter, Anna, whose family must stop the vampires in order to secure their own salvation.  Anna has additional problems, once her brother who has aided her in the fight, is turned into a werewolf himself.
There are loads of special effects in this film and plenty of monters, such as werewolves, vampires and Frankenstein's monster, to keep anyone who loves old 50's horror movies enthralled.  ""Van Helsing"" falls into the same genre as ""The Mummy"" and ""The Mummy Returns""----a campy, fun, popcorn summer movie.

2102606,3,B0002KVUKW,"After the huge success of his THE MUMMY and THE MUMMY RETURNS, writer/director Stephen Sommers was given the green light to tackle some of Universal Studios' prime horror creations.  I refer, of course, to Dracula, Frankenstein and the Wolf Man, who all raised thrills and chills in the classic films of the 30's and 40's.  The result is an over-the-top thrill ride that will please some, while making others roll their eyes at some of the absurdities that abound.
The movie basically uses Bram Stoker's classic vampire-hunter, Van Helsing, as its hero.  However, instead of the elderly professor of the book and previous films, he is a younger, mysterious and dynamic version played by Hugh Jackman (Wolverine of the X-MEN films).  Aided by a lovely gypsy (Kate Beckinsale) and his ingenious assistant, Carl (David Wenham), Van Helsing must foil the plans of the evil Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) to populate Transylvania with new-born vampires.  Complicating matters are the Frankenstein Monster (Shuler Hensley) and the Wolf Man (Will Kemp and major CGI effects).  Along the way, Van Helsing learns some vital clues to the secret behind his dark past.
For the most part, the acting ranges from solid to almost laughable.  Hugh Jackman is spot-on as the title character, perfectly embodying the vampire-hunter's drive to defeat his foes. Unfortunately, the character is almost completely grim throughout the film, making him hard to relate to at times.  Much better in that regard is David Wenham's Carl.  Coming off as a monkish version of ""Q"" in the James Bond films, Wendam easily gets his share of the film's laughs.  He is almost matched by Kevin J. O'Connor's Igor, who helps out Dracula.  Despite being buried in gobs of make-up, Shuler Hensley makes for a decent and sympathetic Frankenstein's Monster.  On the other hand, Richard Roxburgh's Dracula and Kate Beckinsale's Anna seem to vie for the title of ""most over-wrought accent"", with Roxburgh getting the nod here.  However, Beckinsale looks great as a gypsy and she handles most of the physical stuff pretty well.  Will Kemp's performance is non-existent as most of it is done by his CGI alter-ego.
The CGI effects and stunts are top-notch, and you almost can feel worn-out by the high energy of the production.  In fact, that can be said to be this film's main flaw.  The plot is simply an excuse to zip from one action scene to the next.  Also, unlike the MUMMY films, there is no ""twinkle in the eye"" or sense of joy in this flick.  As a result, one finds it very hard to relate to any of these characters.
Still, this is not a bad film.  If you're willing to suspend your disbelief and accept the film for the amusement ride it is, it is definitely worth your time.",1086048000,2,2739,4.839055793991417
2102607,4,B0002KVUKW,"I'd actually give this movie more 3 1/2 stars, but since you can't do halves I decided to round up.
I walked into this movie wanting to be entertained and I was. I loved the humor, I loved Hugh Jackman and Richard Roxburgh. David Wenham as Carl was perfect. I love how they did the brides and Frankenstein. Most of all, I loved how they decided to do the Werewolves, particularly the transformation from human to werewolf (the idea of someone ripping their skin off and having the werewolf beneath it is creepy -- amazing and creepy).
The only things I had problems with were some of the cheesy moments, specifically the ""Lion-King-type-ending"" as I've seen some people refer to it. And some of the lines were a bit too cheesy -- made me roll my eyes and laugh at the wrong moments.
Ultimately, it was over-the-top, but personally I found it to be the type of over-the-top that was fun and enjoyable, I also liked the non-stop action, you didn't know what was going to happen next.

2102608,3,B0002KVUKW,"I saw this movie while on vacation in Hong Kong. They basically only show 1 english movie at a time and this happened to be it. And although my movie was slightly tampered by the stinky guy sitting next to me, I found this movie to be pretty good. The cool thing I liked about it was that it had all the classic horror monsters in one movie. Frankenstein, Jeckell and Hyde, Dracula, and Werewolves. Even though the monsters were taken out of their original contexts, it was fun to see them all together in one movie. The other reason I wanted to see this movie was to see Kate Beckingsale. I can still picture the unforgettable scene in Underworld where she jumps off the building and bounces up into her walk B-). I was a little disappointed by her character in this movie however, as I found her to be much too vulnerable. Hugh Jackman as Van Helsing was pretty good. It's good that I didn't find myself constantly reminded of Wolverine. The harpies (Dracula's brides) were cool and the final climatic battle between Werewolf and Vampire will not disappoint. The only thing I found a little far fetched was that dracula wanted to have offspring. Even if Dracula had children, and if they were vampires, then how would they age or grow, since we know that vampires don't age or grow? Or were his offspring a new breed of vampire. I didn't quite understand. Anyways, overall, not a bad movie. And I even got a little coke music box souvenier from the theatre for buying a snack combo ;-).",1085961600,,1488,4.4944649446494465
2102609,4,B0002KVUKW,"""Van Helsing"" is a kitchen sink monster movie, so it is a question of how far it can go before things fall apart, which for me was pretty far.  The best part of writer-director Stephen Sommers' film is arguably the prologue, done in glorious black & white as a wonderful homage to the Universal monster pictures of yesterday.  In Transylvania the torch bearing peasants are storming Castle Frankenstein, where the Victor (Samuel West) has just brought his creation (Shuler Hensley) to life and is screaming, ""It's alive!  Alive!  Alive!,"" the words immortalizing by Colin Clive back in 1931's ""Frankenstein.""  However, there is a twist in that Dr. Frankenstein is working with Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh), who is after the secret of creating life for his own purposes.  Events take their tragic course and then we pick up the story a year later in color with the title character (Hugh Jackman) in Paris on the trail of the Hunchback of Notre Dame (who actually turns out to be a different literary monster).
To be clear, this is not Abraham Van Helsing, the wise doctor of Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"" novel, but a mysterious monster killer whose first name turns out to be Gabriel.  I would say that he is decked out like Solomon Kane, but that has nothing to do with any of the Universal monster movies.  He is dispatched by a secret organization in the Vatican to go to Transylvania and kill Dracula.  Not just because the count is an evil vampire, but because the noble house of Valerious has been fighting Dracula for several hundred years and the entire family can only go directly to heaven, passing purgatory or worse, if they kill the vampire before he wipes out their family, which is now down to Prince Velkan (Will Kemp) and Princess Anna (Kate Beckinsale).
Apparently Dracula knows about the deal as well because when Van Helsing gets to Transylvania the vampire launches an attack with his three brides,  Aleera (Elena Anaya), Verona (Silvia Colloca), and Marishka (Josie Maran).  Fortunately, Van Helsing has a new sidekick, Carl (David Wenham), a friar who is clearly the Vatican equivalent of James Bonds' Q.  Carl main creation is basically a mechanical crossbow that shoots like a machine gun.  However, technology is of limited value when you are dealing with monsters.
Sommers plays with the rules of his monsters a little bit.  This time around werewolves do not sprout hair but rather claw off their skin to reveal their fur (and visa versa), which I found rather effective.  The Frankenstein monster has a touch of the industrial revolution about him and is one of the more human characters in the film.  As for Dracula, it seems that driving a stake through his heart or shoving a cross in his fangs no longer has much effect and our hero has to discover exactly what you have to do to this particular vampire to get him to bite the dust.
In the end there are two flaws that undercut the effectiveness of this film.  The first has to do with the new werewolf rules, because I am still not sure when you turn into a werewolf and the whole transformation bit ends up speeding up to meet the demands of the plot.  The second is the idea that Van Helsing and Anna are too busy trying to be superheroes (or Tarzan), swinging around on cables and such.  There so much swinging on such things, over enormous distances, that the idea is done to death and just becomes a sort of running joke.  Add to this that at the end Sommers tries to over a transcendent grace note that is rather lame.  Fortunately the end credits are pretty cool, so you can still leave the theater having good thoughts about ""Van Helsing.""
I was not grossly offended by this film as are some aficionados of the classic Universal Dracula, Frankenstein and Wolf Man films have admitted to being.  For throwing three major characters into the mix ""Van Helsing"" does a good job of making the pieces fit overall and providing a nice summertime roller coaster ride.  The attempt to build chemistry between the hero and the heroine us really nothing more than an attempt to put off their kiss as long as possible and the mystery as to what Van Helsing cannot remember anything about his past is also a minor matter.  This movie is about monsters fighting monsters and on that part the film delivers with the volume turned all the way up.",1085961600,3,4320,4.676354029062087

What I got instead was the absolute castration of all things pure in this world.  The ties between all of the characters was such a stretch that Denise Richards would have gotten a hernia.  There is absolutely nothing that is of high quality about this film as they even managed to mess up hot vampire chicks.  I thought that it was horrible enough when Steven Sommers decided to mutilate the mummy in THE MUMMY, but he took it to an entirely different level when he drained a boil on Frankenstein, Dracula, Wolfman, Dr. Jekyl & Mr. Hyde.

Apart from the CGI pornography, the uninspired dialogue is also straight out of video game land. The screenplay may have been written by someone in the post-production department. The guy who plays Dracula is mediocre at best, and the overacting of his female companions is absolutely ridiculous (or was this intentional?) I realize this film is somewhat tongue and cheek, but that's no reason for the film to be this bad. I am grateful that I had to go to the toilet and I missed about 10 minutes.

2102613,2,B0002KVUKW,"In years to come, people will ask how it was that the thriller movie evolved into a hideous pudding such as this.  With money no real constraint, and special effects enabling just about anything, movie-makers now seem intent on creating 100% action pieces which leave no room for characterisation, menace, sensitivity or even real acting.  I can appreciate that action pieces are more likely to succeed in the international market -- explosions work in any language -- but movies like 'Van Helsing' have got me thinking that maybe films were better when lack of budget forced directors and screenwriters to focus on the things that really matter.
The makers of 'Van Helsing' seem to have included just about every horror genre you can think of: Dracula, Frankenstein, Dr Jekyll, Alien, Werewolves etc.  So it's hard to imagine there being much else for them to include in a follow-up, though it goes without saying that enough ends are left loose (such as Frankenstein's monster paddling off into the sunset) to allow the possibility of a 'Van Helsing Part Twee' [pardon my Dutch].
In the UK, this movie is a further example of how censorship standards have fallen.  When Schwarzenegger's PREDATOR was shown in British cinemas, the film was awarded an '18' certificate despite the removal of a scene in which one of the mercenaries continues fighting despite having his arm blown off.  VAN HELSING is rated a '12A' here, despite the inclusion of a scene in which the hero saws off Mr Hyde's arm.  I'm not sure that 12-year-olds of any era really need to see this sort of stuff.",1085875200,4,1577,4.843866171003717
2102614,3,B0002KVUKW,"This movie works as a good action movie and a fair horror movie.  The essentials of the predictable plot are that Van Helsing, a fallen priest, is hired by a highly secret cabal of Muslim and Christian priests to exterminate evil.  He is sent, where else, to Transylvania, with an arsenal of (for the late Middle Ages) extremely high-tech weaponry, and a loyal Friar as a sidekick, to save the last members of a family which will be doomed to eternal damnation if Dracula is not exterminated before the last one dies.  Naturally, one of the surviving members is a highly attractive, action-oriented woman.
Even though the plot is predictable, and the effects are OK, the movie was very enjoyable to watch (though I probably wouldn't buy it --- it is the kind of movie where you have seen everything after seeing it once), due to good shocking moments and a bit of light humor tossed in to liven up the plot.
If you like action movies, you'll like Van Helsing.  If you expect deep character development, tons of vivid humor, deep musings about the state of the world, spiritual enlightenment, or a fresh pair of socks, you won't get them from this film.",1085788800,6,1152,4.632352941176471
2102615,3,B0002KVUKW,"2004, what a year? Well, if, lie me, you're a bit of (for this read A VERY BIG) movie fan, then it has been awful. Truly awful. From ""Paycheck"" through to ""Gothika"", by way of ""Scary Movie 3"", we've had some painfully awful movies that wouldnt look out of place at christmas dinner.
So, Stephen ""The Mummy"" Sommers to the rescue, eh? Surely? He served us up with that brilliant Brenden Fraser vehicle in 1999 that helped us forget about ""Star Wars : Ep 1"". This year? Yes and no.
""Van Helsing"" is a mixed bag really. The plot concerns the Vatican sending Gabriel (!) Van Helsing off to Transylvania to eliminate Count Dracula (Richard Roxbourgh)before Anna (Kate Beckinsale) is killed and her entire bloodline condemed to hell for all eternity. Well, Sommers doesnt do things for effect.............. forget i said that.
Along the way, there are battles with Frankensteins Monster and The Wolf Man, but none as stunning as the Parisian set opening tussle with Mr. Hyde.
the effects are stunning, espicially The Wolf Man. There are also some nice background effects, like a half built eiffel tour in the Paris skyline at the start, which puts a nice degree of auticallity, before the giant wolves show up.
Despite a strong performance from Hugh Jackman though, theres not alot else to recomend ""Van Helsing"" for if you don't like things messy. It has the potential, but if Steve had maybe put more emphasis on the story, and left one/two of his Real Madrid line up of monsters out, we could have had a perfect start to the summer season. As it is, we have a half-arsed Richard Roxbourgh portraying a strangely subdued Count and Kate Beckinsale doing nothing but looking (VERY) pleasing on the eye.",1085788800,6,1696,4.733108108108108
2102616,2,B0002KVUKW,"At the end of the 19th century Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) is notorious in Europe and his name is often associated with death.  This tale begins where Van Helsing has just finished a mission involving Mr. Hyde, and now Van Helsing is about to embark on a new mission with werewolves, vampires, Frankenstein, and Dracula.  This means that Van Helsing must travel to Transylvania where Dracula and his cohorts reside.  When Van Helsing arrives to the mountains of Transylvania he meets Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale).  Together Van Helsing and Valerious bring more death and destruction to the monsters that cross their path using high-tech weapons made by Van Helsing's follower fryer Carl.  Van Helsing is a movie with visual eye candy that is strikingly spectacular as almost every scene has computer generated images and extraordinary heroism.  This initially leads the movie into a cinematic action experience.  However, the cinematic experience is spoiled as the movie is almost utterly supported by characters telling the audience what they are going to do and not leaving anything for the imagination.  These verbal cues are often redundant and very little story is supported with visual cues besides the combat and rescue scenes.  These combat and rescue scenes are most often extremely far-fetched, which lends very little support to any suspense.  Instead, the suspense is neglected with absurd shoot 'em and beat 'em up scenes.  Lastly, there are occasions with situational comedy, which lightens up the cinematic experience, but it does not save this absurd cinematic experience as it goes into a downward spiraling pattern from the beginning.",1085788800,,1655,5.254752851711027
2102617,2,B0002KVUKW,"This movie doesn't come close to living up to the hype and ballyhoo that preceded it's release. I expected it to be more scary, moody and atmospheric, but it turned out to be quite the opposite. The main characters spend much of the film engaged in chase after chase and doing very over-the-top stunts at a frenetic pace: jumping and falling from ridiculous heights without getting hurt or killed, crashing into trees, buildings and other inanimate objects, etc. It was like seeing ""Lord Of The Rings"" albeit with vampires, werewolves and a ridiculous-looking Frankenstein monster thrown in.
On the plus side, the visual effects are cool, especially the transformation sequences involving Dracula's ""brides"" turning into bats and Van Helsing when he becomes a werewolf. The bats look more like pterodactyls or the dragons in ""Lord Of The Rings"". But as I mentioned before, the Frankenstein monster is ridiculous and cheesy; it reminded me more of Peter Boyle as ""Young Frankenstein"" just without the zipper in his neck and a receding hairline. The monster was much too ""human"" here and spoke almost perfectly, which took away any semblance of menace and scariness. He came across more like a dim-witted sidekick than a monster to be feared.
If you like a lot of stylized action, this is definitely the movie for you; but if you want to be scared, don't waste your time and money. You'll be very disappointed like I was.",1085702400,,1419,4.916666666666667
2102618,5,B0002KVUKW,"Van Helsing, starring Hugh Jackman and helmed by Stephen Sommers, the same director who brought us The Mummy and The Mummy Returns, is mindless fun - but what a rollicking jolly good ride! Unlike the rather more pretentious Troy, Van Helsing does not pretend to be anything other than a good popcorn movie with non-stop tongue-in-cheek action from start to finish. From the hilariously retro black-and-white opening scene to the Lion King-inspired closing scene, Van Helsing rips off other movies with great gusto, and yet never fails to entertain. Aussie hunk Hugh Jackman (yes, my adopted country does seem to churn out these talented celebrity hunks and babes like a well-tuned factory) stars as the mysterious Gabriel Van Helsing, vampire-slayer extraordinaire working for the Vatican who, like Jackman's other famous big screen alter ego in the X-Men movies, has no memory of who he really is. Allusions to his lost memories point to him being an immortal who has been alive since the time of Christ himself. Van Helsing is commanded by the Vatican to help kill Dracula in order to ensure that the souls of the gypsy family who has battled the minions of the King of the Undead for centuries will not be stuck in Purgatory. Meanwhile, Dracula has recruited the Wolfman and captured the Frankenstein Monster for his own nefarious ends. It is up to Van Helsing and the last surviving member of the gypsy family (Kate Beckinsale) to derail his evil plans. Hugh Jackman certainly contributed a lot of the fun factor in this movie - he makes a very convincing action hero, cutting a heroic figure with his testosterone-pumped body in his leather overcoat, bristling with gadgets Batman (and a certain Mr. Bond) would envy. Sommers even found a way for the Aussie hunk to showcase his magnificent body in nothing more than a loin cloth in the middle of the Transylvanian winter. With X-Men 3 on the way and Van Helsing bound to become another franchise, Jackman can look forward to several more years of VERY gainful employment.",1085702400,4,2027,4.895348837209302

Otherwise steer clear. Mr Sommers seems to think that the appeal of pulp movies of the 30s is in their naive stories, but he somehow forgets, that naive doesn't mean stupid!
The concept of Van Helsing in itself has potential (which is demonstrated in a comic book prequel, which is better then the movie).(...)",1085616000,,892,4.546583850931677
2102621,5,B0002KVUKW,"VAN HELSING is a TERRIFIC night at the movies: the actors are very appealing, the production design and costumes are lush & elaborate, Silvestri's film score is TUMULTUOUS with an inventive use of percussion and stirring themes reminiscent of Korngold's music for the Errol Flynn swashbucklers {especially during the coach & Transylvanian horse chase...an exceptional audio/visual feast. While I enjoy reading all of the various reactions to this film, I am struck with just how jaded we have become with regard to action/adventure/fantastic films, particularly the comments about ILM's visual effects & animation. I thought the FX were beautifully designed and executed. The moviegoing public is so inundated with quality CG work that recent marvelous movie magic is dismissed so casually. NOT a good sign...where is the willing suspension of disbelief and childlike sense of wonder?!? Finally, I didn't go to VAN HELSING expecting to see CITIZEN KANE in TRANSYLVANIA or DOCTOR ZHIVAGO MEETS the MONSTERS; I bought my ticket and got on the rollercoaster and dug the whole thing IMMENSELY!

2102622,5,B0002KVUKW,"It always seems to happen, if reviewers hate a film I end up seeing it more than once. I thought ""Van Helsing"" was incredible, the CGI quite believable and the performances by Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale in top form (...although I do admit I'd find reason to enjoy any film with Beckinsale in a starring role. Not only is she a wonderful actress, she's extremely easy on the eyes). Kate's ""Underworld"" was another brilliant sci-fi/horror/fantasy flick. I don't know if Jackman can make a bad movie as I've yet to see one. I also don't want to give away much of the plot, just suffice to say the action is close to non-stop. Of course, as usual, no one could survive half of the stuff these heros shake off (...my only real general complaint with this genre of cinema). Even so, this has everything... even some decent comic relief. My advice, forget the critics and go see it. You'll walk out of the theater happy you went in. I'm looking forward to the sequel for this one, although I can't imagine who he'll go up against. Most of the decent monsters, real or imagined, are all dead. I hope Beckinsale can find her character coming back from her eventual destination.

2102623,4,B0002KVUKW,"Ok I was rather skeptical about the whole concept of this movie but went anyway just to see Hugh Jackman after his phenomenal acting as Wolverine in the X-Men movies. The whole concept of Dracula and Frankenstein topics sounds extremely cheesy and almost laughable to me at first. However, I was surprised because ""Van Helsing"" turned out to be a surprisingly great movie and blew all of my expectations right out into the ocean.
 A special operative named Gabriel Van Helsing is a mysterious man who hunts demons and vampires in the streets of 1880s Paris and London but is assigned to hunt down a murderous vampire named Count Vladius Dracula who aims to spread evil and horrors all over humanity and Van Helsing travels to Transylvania where his world collides with a young woman, the last descendant of a family that has been dedicated to ridding the world of evil for centuries and now aims to destroy Dracula for good after the atrocities he's committed including murdering her father. Dracula has also been sending out a large swarm of smaller vampires hatched in his lair to exterminate the residents of a nearby town in the Transylvanian Mountains. Princess Anna's family has made it's vow that it will not enter heaven until Dracula is destroyed for good and Van Helsing is the only one who can really in fact can do just that.
 I actually found the movie to more fun than scary for the most part but some of the scenes were pretty intense to watch and some were a bit much for me. This movie isn't necessarily one for the thinking crowd but ""Van Helsing"" is nonetheless a really fun and action-packed flick that is a really great homage to the classic 1930s through 1950s horror movies and brings back a lot of the old-fashioned styles of the past. In some ways too it also breaks some of the predictable elements of vampire films of the past. It almost even sheds a totally new light on the classic Frankenstein monsters of old.
This movie has it's share of flaws such as some hammy acting in some spots and awkward storyline but a lot of them are bypassed because this movie is just plain fun and worth killing a couple of hours. It is no masterpiece or even an amazing film by any stretch of the imagination but it is certainly worth a look...that is if you aren't willing to watch a movie that requires intellectualization but instead is like mind popcorn to munch on and that's what matters here.

The movie is indeed atrocious: A flat, candy-coated monster mash that's about as scary as reading the back of a cereal box.
Universal gave writer-director Stephen Sommers ( the ""Mummy"" series) $150 million to pack the studio's classic stable of villains - Mr. Hyde, Frankenstein's monster, Dracula, the Wolfman -  into a quick, presumably fun flick. Sommers returned with more than two hours (!) of plot-filled dirge that focuses on the origins of its drab, amnesia-riddled hero (Hugh Jackman, apparently on anti-depressants) and his relationship with a buxom, plucky sidekick Anna Valerious, in a performance by Kate Beckinsale that belongs in the pantheon of bored, unphysical performances.
Beckinsale, however beautiful, is a slight, tiny little smoky-eyed girl; how in the world she got cast in ""Underworld,"" then ""Van Helsing,"" then some spy movie to follow in the next year, is a worthy homework assignment. And yet she surpasses, two times over, the work of Richard Roxburgh, who throws all drama to the winds and camps it up as a high-pitched, effete Dracula. If Johnny Depp channeled Keith Richards in ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" Roxburgh channels Robin Williams after he's had four goblets of apple wine on Disco Night in South Beach.
Dracula is only real villain of the picture - Frankenstein's monster (Shuler Hensley, under there somewhere) is just a pawn in the count's elaborate scheme to bring his pulsating sacks of bat babies to life, while Wolfman is actually Anna's brother under a wicked spell.
""Van Helsing"" features a series of showdowns, the best of which probably involves Jackman and his machine gun crossbow vs. Dracula's three winged brides. The special f/x aren't awful, just nonstop and, therefore, inconsequential. A relentless soundtrack booms underneath the picture. And Sommers, whether he ever makes another good popcorn movie or not, will never be known for fluid filmmaking.
But some of the blame has to fall to Jackman, who lacks wit, humor, playfulness - everything that made Depp's performance in ""Pirates"" carry that film to unexpected, giant box office returns. Jackman seems plugged in as Wolverine in the ""X-Men"" films and static outside them; remember his straight-man act in ""Swordfish?"" He's not even Brendan Fraser. Beckinsale - who was good as the ice queen in ""The Last Days of Disco"" for a reason - is no tart herself. When the leads are best described as ""glum,"" what kind of blockbuster can you expect?",1085443200,,2713,5.055803571428571
2102628,4,B0002KVUKW,"Some people hate this movie, some people love it. It's just people's opinions, so I'm gonna admit I love it!!! Unlike LXG, this movie manages to connect all of the classic monsters that appear in this movie into one with its great storyline. This is a re-creation of Bram Stoker's chracter, Dr. Abrham Van Helsing. In Bram Stoker's version, Van Helsing is an old man. But this movie couldn't be an action movie if the main character was an old guy would it? So they changed his name and age and deleted the 'Dr.' part. And now he is Gabriel Van Helsing. In the movie, Van Helsing is a man who has a mysterious past and for some reason managed to live from the years A.D. He was found by the Holy Order, a secret organization of priests who's mission is to vanquish evil. Of course, the priests can't do it alone so they had knights who fought evil. But the knights perished long ago and now one single man fights evil alone--Van Helsing. Van Helsing's newest mission is to kill Count Vladislaus Dracula. So he goes along with his companion, a friar called Carl, who invents all sorts of gadgets for Van Helsing to use. Together they go to Transylvania and find themselves with Princess Anna. The last of the Valerious family, the family who swore to God that they wouldn't enter Heaven until Dracula was killed. But now only Anna and her brother Velkan remain. So Velkan is turned into a werewolf and if Anna fails, the Valerious family will remain in purgatory forever. Along the way, Gabriel, Carl, and Anna meet the Frankenstein monster who is friendly but feared by his appearence. He informs the trio that Dracula plans to unleash an evil far beyond imagination. And a whole adventure begins. I gave this movie 4 stars as a 9/10. And I gave it a 9/10 because it left some questions unanswered. But of course, that's 'cause there's gonna be a sequel! So wait for Van Helsing II and Stephen Sommers' new TV series called Transylvania! The series is not yet released and it's not certain when it will come out, but it's based in the Van Helsing universe but the characters from the movie are not the main characters in the series.

2102629,5,B0002KVUKW,"The summer 2004 movie season officially got underway with the release of VAN HELSING.  The movie was written by Stephen Sommers (THE MUMMY and THE MUMMY RETURNS). The film stars Hugh Jackman (X-MEN, X2) as Van Helsing, the famed literary vampire hunter who killed Count Dracula.
Unlike the usual interpretations of the character, Jackman's Van Helsing isn't an aging scholar fighting his last battle. Instead, this incarnation of Van Helsing presents the character as a 19th century James Bond crossed with the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, who is employed by the Vatican as a secret agent to ward off the forces of evil.
After the movie's introductory episode with Mr. Hyde atop Notre Dame in Pris, Van Helsing returns to Vatican City. His superiors send him to Trannsylvania, Count Dracula's hunting grounds.  For half a century Dracula has been living in a symbiotic relationship with the villagers. But Dracula has begun killing more and the village is under siege by werewolves.  Dracula is up to something big and only Van Helsing can stop him.
VAN HELSING is full of plot holes, many of the characters lack development, and there is some really corny dialogue.  However,  the movie has some amazing special effects and provides some very interesting interpretations of literary and movie characters (I especially enjoyed the representation of Frankenstein).  The movie isn't meant to be a deep piece of cinema.  It's a movie that does what movies have done since they were first invented:  entertain and excite.  VAN HELSING is a great piece of mind candy to chew on.",1085443200,,1579,5.042307692307692

LoEG is actually a much better movie, in my opinion.  The movie starts off decently enough, but quickly turns bad.  After the friar, the movie gets worse with the introduction of each new character.  Each character from the Transylvania setting, excluding the Frankenstein monster, is marked by laughably bad acting magnified by obviously fake accents.  The poor acting would have been somewhat excuseable had the action been good, unfortunately, though, it wasn't.  Many of the maneuvers the characters used in the action scenes made little sense, thereby stupefying most of those scenes.  The action and acting weren't helped at all by the story:  I've seen high-school writers come up with better.  Besides those flaws, however, this movie is packed with inane movements by the actors/actresses and weird, absurd cinematogrophy.  In the end, rent and watch this movie once it hits DVD and VHS in order to laugh at it, if you like.  Make sure, though, that you don't pay very much.",1085356800,,1122,5.010810810810811

Another reviewer here mentioned comparisons to ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" and I couldn't agree more except to say that ""League"" was far, far better.  The poor chump Van Helsing didn't even get the girl!!
Trying to be serious, it even fails at comedy--like the monster rowing out to sea at the end--that was supposed to be dramatic??  More than I laughed out loud at that one.

2102632,5,B0002KVUKW,"Van Helsing is a spectacular and fun action movie with awesome special effects and detailed fight scenes. The movie is about an infamous, mysterious monster hunter known as Van Helsing, who is sent by the Vatican to eliminate Dracula, a terrible vampire, who lives in the dark realm of Transylvania. Just before this new assignment, he dispatches the evil Mr. Hyde in Paris, but is accused of murdering Hyde's other half, Dr. Jekyll. On his journey to kill Dracula, Van Helsing is helped by a resourceful, peaceful friar named Carl, and a beautiful and deadly princess named Anna Valerious, who is the last of her clan after her brother Velkan becomes a were wolf (known as Wolf-Man). Along the way, Van Helsing fights and eventually befriends the misunderstood and powerful Frankenstein, fights Dracula's three wives with is handy gas-powered crossbow, fights the Wolf-Man, and fights Dracula himself. A holy man and searching for his past, Van Helsing is hunted throughout Europe, feared as a murderer. During his journey, he learns about his past as he is confronted by the world's most terrible creatures, including Dracula's vile Dwergi, which are small but nasty trolls.
  Van Helsing is a great movie with an interesting plot and great effects. Hugh Jackman is great in the movie as the great monster hunter Van Helsing,  and David Wenham provides a humorous but important role as Carl, the clever but battle-shy friar. The Wolf-Man is spectacular. He is actually Velkan, Anna's brother. After being bitten by a werewolf, Dracula forces him to fight for him. The Wolf-Man is perhaps, aside from Dracula, Van helsing's deadliest foe. Frankenstein is also very well portrayed. Shuler Hensley does a steller job as the misunderstood yet overwhelmingly strong Frankenstein, who actually befriends and aids Van Helsing. Dracula is portrayed by Richard Roxburgh, who does a very good job. Roxburgh is cool in battle, is very evil, and is often even humorous. Dracula's wives are definitely cool in battle, but are sometimes too corny to take seriously. The fight scene with the three wives against Anna and Van Helsing is very action packed and fun. Kate Beckinsale does a mediocre job as Anna. She is very slick and cool in battle, but her acting is occasionally cheesy and boring. Van Helsing is an awesome movie with great action and a spectacular cast. The journey of Van Helsing is fantastic. Van Helsing escapes certain death and battles classic monsters in this action-packed film. Many critics argue that the acting can be boring. I do not understand how you can say Spiderman (which had cool action but terrible acting)  had great acting, and say this does not. Special effects and fun action does not make a movie bad. Almost all action movies have occasionally corny acting (this not an exception). Van Helsing is an awesome thrill ride packed with great adventure and awesome action and effects!!!!!",1085356800,,2912,5.022774327122153

Why not combine all the greatest horror flick monsters and put them all together in a movie with a feasible plot? Well, with Van Helsing, you get Dracula, Frankenstein, Wolfman, and even the Brides of Dracula! Pair them up with one of the most heralded hunters of all time, the Mythical Van Helsing, and you have a classic action movie right? Well, in a way. Right off from the start of the movie, you see a black-and-white version of the Creation of Dr. Frankenstein, setting you up for the horrific and terribly cheesy special effects! Frankenstein and Dracula look like less-frightening versions of themselves, and unfortuneatly, Frankenstein is portrayed as a GOOD GUY and a Kindred Soul! I found this to be slightly stupid, as I was looking forward to a battle between Helsing and Frankenstein. Alas, no. Then, Van Helsing comes to the little but haunted town of Transylvania after rumors that Dracula is killing off many townspeople there. What ensues is a straight-up action flick that is low on acting, high on violence, and with just utterly terrible Special Effects. Also, the plot is very understandable in the beginning, but it quickly becomes stupid and cheesy, making the viewer get confused over the plot. Also, the movie tries to scare you, but many times, in the process the parts that make you jump are either genuine or mostly laughable.

This film does not in delve into disturbing psychological horror that was witnessed in Bram Stoker's Dracula.  Fans of that film will probably not enjoy this one.  This film comes across more like a Dracula meets Indiana Jones flick.  Therefore, if you enjoy entertaining films, this one will fulfill your expectations.  Despite the comments made in the other reviews, I differ in my opinion of Richard Roxburgh's Dracula.  I think that he made a stellar performance!  Roxburgh has an amazing presence on film, and he portrays Dracula as a somewhat tragic, and yes, deeply romantic figure.  If anything, the film suffers from too few scenes with Dracula in them, for he is undoubtedly the main attraction in the film.  I must agree, however, with comments made concerning the use of CGI.  When is Hollywood going to learn that when it comes to computer animation, less is MORE.
The castles in the film look great, but several of the other creatures, like the werewolves and Mr. Hyde, do appear a bit fake.  Some of the stunts are extreme and excessive.

The effects are very sub-par by today's standards, especially in the fake-looking warewolves and annoying brides. Gollum and even Dobby put them to shame. For that matter, so does Shrek (who makes a cameo in the beginning as Mr. Hyde, it seems). Everything about this movie is over-the-top in the worst of ways. The dialogue in particular. Richard Roxburgh's portrayal of Dracula couldn't help but make me think of the count from Sesame Street.

2102641,4,B0002KVUKW,"My father is a huge fan of the Universal Studios monsters. He really enjoyed the remake of The Mummy, so the return of several onscreen monster staples simultaneously (the Wolfman, Frankenstein's Monster, and Dracula) was a must-see. We were not disappointed.
Van Helsing is not by any means a GOOD movie. It is pulp action fun, in the same vein as League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, The Shadow, and the Indiana Jones series. Too many people confuse pulp-action movies for poorly directed films - one is on purpose, the other is unintentional.
The term ""pulp"" is derived from the paperback books that were made of pulpy paper. Cheap and filled with lurid tales of sex and violence, pulp was sort of porn for the action-minded: not much talk, lots of fighting. In fact, it's not unusual for the fights to actually string together so that the hero doesn't get to say or do much of anything. A lot of reviews emphasize, ""Van Helsing never lets up."" Yep, that's pulp.
Another surefire way to identify a pulp-type style is the hero. Heroes in pulp stories are ridiculously well rounded. Pulp heroes are scientists and master pugilists, excellent pilots and crack shots. While modern heroes pride themselves on their flaws, pulp heroes have none. Van Helsing displays all signs of being nearly indestructible.
Now that we've gotten the definition of pulp out of the way and established that the director's (Sommers) intent was to create a pulp film, we can ignore many of the basic weaknesses inherent to a film of this genre and focus on the other aspects.
This is one, gigantic homage. The film makes that homage very overt by filming the opening sequence in black-and-white. Dr. Frankenstein and Dracula talk, act, and ultimately get attacked by villagers with pitchforks and torches. The sequence ends with the appearance of Frankenstein's Monster, who goes out with a bang.
Flash forward to the Victorian age. Van Helsing is tracking none other than Mr. Hyde. Yes, THAT Hyde. Curiously, Mr. Hyde looks very similar to the heroic Hyde of League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, including the fact that he's all CGI and rather ape-like. No matter, here it works - Hyde is rendered beautifully in Gollum-like detail, and he is a frightening sight to behold. We get to see Van Helsing in action without being distracted by all the movie monster hoopla.
What we learn about Van Helsing is that he is a combination of several characters. He dresses like Vampire Hunter D (Sommers knows his anime). He swings along rooftops from his grappling hook like Batman. He is backed by a super-secret organization dedicated to monster hunting that supplies him with bleeding edge gadgets, just like James Bond. In fact, he even has his own Q (David Wenham, playing a friar named Carl). If Van Helsing sounds like he's a superhero, see my comments about pulp heroes above.
Oh yeah, the plot. The movie revolves around Dracula's quest to bring his undead progeny (the union of Dracula and his three brides) to life. ""Vampires are the walking undead. It only makes sense that their children would be born dead."" I'll let that sink in for a bit...got it? Sure you do. Throw in some nonsense about werewolves being controlled by Dracula and Frankenstein's Monster being key to said progeny's resurrection, and you've pretty much got the plot down.
The special effects are amazing. Dracula's brides get far more screen time than any other version of the movie and here they can transform into bat-winged harpies as well as their typically attractive forms. The werewolves are very much the werewolves of Underworld, including the ape-like ability to scale walls. Surprisingly, Frankenstein's Monster is not the shambling moron so many people are accustomed to. In physical form, he is a true monster, complete with flapping braincase and steam-powered leg. He's also a well-spoken person with a heart. Frankenstein's Monster has the best dialogue, and that's saying something.
The parallels to Underworld continue with Kate Bekinsale who is in both films. Kate plays the gypsy Anna Valerious, dedicated to destroying Dracula. Kate looks great in this film but doesn't have a whole lot to do but be the love interest. She also apparently sleeps in her corset, which must be awfully uncomfortable.
The movie plays fast and loose with its own logic, something that the pulp-theme cannot justify. Werewolves shift in and out of human form when the full moon is VISIBLE. The definition of visible is rather flexible. In fact, the full moon seems to be in effect for an entire week. Transylvanian horses can really leap tall bridges in a single bound. And apparently silver stakes work on everybody, including Dracula.
On the other hand, the movie makes some winking allusions to history. Van Helsing ""fought against the Romans at Masada."" The monster hunter's background, which I won't give away here, owes as much to biblical history as it does to Vampire Hunter D. And Mr. Faramir is hysterical as the funny man.
My dad really enjoyed Van Helsing. My wife thought it was stupid. I thought the movie was intentionally stupid and thus enjoyed it. And oh yeah, it had Kate Beckinsale.
Just one question: Where's the Creature from the Black Lagoon?",1084665600,13,5213,4.938496583143508

2102644,4,B0002KVUKW,"This is one of those films where you just cannot trust the critics at all.  Like last year's vastly underrated THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN, VAN HELSING is one of those movies that you know is gonna get pummled by the critics even before the movie comes out.  Not because of the film itself, but of what kind of film it is; critics just don't seem to like these sort of movies.  I for one love 'em, and VAN HELSING did not disappoint.  On the contrary, it was way better than I expected!
Right from the very beginning (in a terrific black & white homage to the beloved Universal classics of old), I knew that I was in for one helluva good time!  Stephem Sommers delivers a much better film than THE MUMMY RETURNS, when at the same time using almost all the elements from that film.  There's epic scope, reminiscent of the INDIANA JONES films; mind-boggling production design (the $148 million budget truly shows in the costumes and massive, intricate sets); and great action scenes, which thankfully lose the sloppiness seen in those of THE MUMMY RETURNS.  Alan Silvestri returns for the musical score, which unfortunately doesn't come close to the sweeping grandeur of his score for TMR, but there are still some great musical moments in this film.  But the main reason VAN HELSING truly rises above TMR is for the very same reason THE MUMMY was so great: the tongue-in-cheek attitude of it all.  Action movies like these are meant to be campy, but only to a point.  TMR pushed it waaaaaaaaaay too far, but VAN HELSING does it just right, very much like Sommers' first MUMMY film did.
The cast is just plain perfect, as well.  Hugh Jackman is the charismatic hero he always is (not to say that his role feels tired, far from it), and Kate Beckinsale makes for a surprisingly good female lead.  David Wenham is just plain hilarious as the friar Carl, who supplies Van Helsing with all his unique weaponry (similar to Q from the James Bond film series).  But for me, the best member of the cast by far was Richard Roxburgh as Count Dracula.  His performance is nothing short of brilliance, eminating the same sort of twisted, operatic villainy that was present in Tim Curry's performance in LEGEND.  Roxburgh's take on Dracula is a totally new one, for no longer is he the quiet, horrific figure that Bela Lugosi was, nor the intimidating Dracula of Christopher Lee.  No, this Count is now a deranged-yet-contained lunatic (remiscent of Peter Cushing's Dr. Frankenstein); the tongue-in-cheek, mad scientist insanity Roxburgh lends to the role keeps one's eyes glued to the screen, allowing him to easily steal every scene he's in.  In short, his performance alone is worth seeing the movie for.
The plot is surprisingly original, adding fresh new takes on several monster legends without dishonoring the originals.  If it's one complaint I have about the film, it is that Van Helsing's actual identity wasn't quite as explained as it should have been.  (That's one thing I'm hoping for the DVD to explain.)  That, and the very ending (SPOILER ALERT!), in which you see Kate Beckinsale's face in the clouds, being greeted by her ancestors in heaven.  I'm sorry, but this was just way too cheesy.  Instead, they should've just shown Van Helsing looking up into the heavens and left out the faces.  But in the end, it's a very, very minor complaint in a 2+ hour movie.  Besides, the final shot more than makes up for it, almost guaranteeing a sequel (which I have mixed feelings about).
In conclusion, VAN HELSING is a fantastic way to kick-start the Summer Movie Season, and is sure to please any fan of LXG, THE MUMMY, or the INDIANA JONES trilogy.  Adventure lives forever, indeed!",1084579200,,3689,4.7265625
2102645,3,B0002KVUKW,"I went to see this movie with low expectations and found I was happily amused for the 2+ hours. It was fun, pure silly fun. Sure the plot wasn't really great and a lot of questions went unanswered, but I didn't really find myself caring. Hugh Jackman seemed to enjoy himself in the part even though it didn't really strecth him as an actor, David Wenhem had some of the funniest lines and Kate Beckinsale looked pretty. Dracula was quite decent, campy, but still enjoyable. There was a lot of CGI, but since this was directed by the same guy who did The Mummy/Mummy Returns I wasn't too surprised. The sets, costumes and locations were all gorgeous as well. I did find the accents a bit dodgy, but after a while it didn't really matter and besides, some of the old monster movie accents were equally as dodgy - perhaps this was a homage?
So, if you want a plot with all questions answered then you'll probably hate this film. But if you want an entertaining couple of hours on a rollarcoaster ride of a movie then this will probably fit the bill.",1084579200,2,1046,4.424870466321243

The melodrama is disgusting, and the character development is non-existent (There are almost no questions answered about Hugh Jackman's mysterious past simply for the point of being able to have and equally disgusting sequel).
I usually don't care about how unrealistic movies are, but there are some parts of Van Helsing that are simply incomprehensible in their stupidity and impossibility, with scenes that involve the type of swinging from wires that would not even be possible in Donkey Kong or Trazan. Also, the rules of physics apparently do not apply to either of protaganists, and although I usually do not have a problem with this type of implausible behavior, the actions they take are so grotesquely impossible that it made me want to cry that some people might enjoy such trash.
In summary, if you don't mind a terrible movie with completely overdone and impossible action, along with no decent acting of any kind, go ahead and see this movie, but if you're capable of processing information at more than an second grade level, stay away.",1084579200,3,1133,4.93717277486911

Basically it made itself a fun action adventure movie for the 12 to 16 set, with enough adventure to keep adults that enjoy this kind of stuff engaged.
I did enjoy seeing it on the big screen, because of the effects, but it'd be hard to give it a strong thumbs up go see this right away recommendation.  I wouldn't have a problem recommending this one to own once it's out on dvd for those with young teens that are into this kind of stuff, it's one of those I think can be watched over a few times.  The violence isn't gory and it's really not that ""scary"" in the horror type sense.  The monsters are realistic in the same way that the monsters were in the LOR movies, so I don't recommend it for younger kids, espically those that are subject to having nightmares.
The monsters here suffered some of the same problems that the hulk movie had, they don't quite blend into the live action just right.  Okay, but not perfect.  The leads were both very fun to watch, with lots of chemistry between them.

Make sure you check your brain at the door if you wished to enjoy this movie. Since this movie is not reality based, there would be no reason why it should not have a comic book feel to the entire film.
The computer graphics did a good job recreating all the classical monsters like the werewolf and if there was any real complaint, that it was too much CGI work. The story was super thin and dialogue was best kept simple as the story - which have Van Helsing going to battle Dracula and his minions. Hugh Jackson does a good job here soldiering on for God and Church against the forces of evil. Kate Beckinsale wasn't too bad and Dave Wenham who was badly miscast in Return of the King was actually pretty good here as a fiar, Brother Carl. While not as good his Mummy movies, I thought the director, Stephen Sommers did well. The ending surprised me a bit but I can feel a sequel coming if this movie make big bucks.
Part James Bond, part Indiana Jones and all made up, this may be a good movie to have a party around. It may scared little kids but grown should have fun with it. Don't take it seriously and it should be enjoyable.",1084492800,3,1235,4.282051282051282
2102650,4,B0002KVUKW,"After observing the landslide of negative reviews on another website, I went to see ""Van Helsing"" anyway. The previews made it look exciting and how could I resist three (actually four) monsters for the price of one movie? I'll admit I entered with trepidation because I didn't like the director's other films--you know, the Indiana Jones ripoffs ""The Mummy"" and ""The Mummy Returns""? Well, I was pleasantly rewarded. I didn't feel that I was overloaded with CGI (and people ought to lay off the criticisms about CGI because we can always go back to Jason and the Argonauts and Sinbad's claymation monsters, or the puppetry of American Werewolf in London and The Howling!) Yes, I agreed with the critics who stated that this film is unrelenting in its fast pacing and climax after climax, but you know, this was a good thing because, you see, it's an ACTION film! I'm not looking for deep meaning or extensive character development with this type of film. So, how was the acting? Well, it was above average for an action film. Hugh Jackman was the appropriate choice to play Van Helsing. This is an underrated actor, just look at how he played Wolverine in the X-Men films. Kate Beckinsale was also appropriate as a gothic princess. There was humor, humanity (Frankenstein's monster), wicked villians (Dracula and his concubines as well as the ultra loud and pulse shaking werewolves). I think I went deaf during my screening because the soundtrack fully utilized the theatres speaker system! The plot was decent enough to keep my interest and the film was just plain entertaining for 2 hours and 25 minutes. Do yourself a favor, don't believe the critics on this one and help yourself to one of the year's most entertaining and fast paced films!",1084492800,8,1745,4.839464882943144
2102651,2,B0002KVUKW,"I'm an older film fan who tries to be selective with my hard saved movie dollars. Van Helsing marketing ploys sucked me in, and I take full responsibility for an almost complete waste of time. It was obviously created by very young talents with limited vision.  Do it again and again and AGAIN seems to be the focus.  I was hoping for suspense, horror and some real feeling of adversarial conflict, but too many monsters spoiled the broth.  No real expectation for character development after the comic Dr. Jeykll/Mr. Hyde showed how the silly game was going to be played.  Computer generated images are already starting to bore me to death, and I suspect many others will support my take.
Kate Beckinsale's beauty and outfit were positive sidebars, but give her something more than ""See Kate run, see Kate jump, and see Kate thrown off the walls. The same for Hugh Jackman except for the beauty and the outfit.  His arrow shooting weapon (sort of a James Bond flavor) was given as many classic closeups as the monsters he was trying to hit.  AND PLEASE!!!NO MORE FLYING FEMALE VAMPIRES! Compared to that fang toothed gal in Frances Ford Coppola's ""Dracula"" they were pathetic fireflys. Gloria Holden (Dracula's Daughter) is probably turning over in her grave at this latest display of creative boredom.
The other leaden refugees from the ""Monster Mash"" were just as weak. Frankenstein's monster doesn't even deserve one word of reference.  The Wolfman seriously overacts. My suggestion when doing the wolf thing is to please review ""The Howling"" and ""An American Werewolf in London"".

The kids may think they like it now, but someday they will  know better....We hope.  I give it one star above what it deserves because of the end credits which were by far the best thing about the whole catastrophe except for the looks of Kate.

Essentially what was given was ""The Mummy"", but set in Transylvania with Dracula as the main villain as opposed to the mummy.  You could pretty much trade the heroes and not see much of a difference in character, and like ""The Mummy"", ""Van Helsing"" was filled with great action scenes, cheesy lines and numerous plot holes.  I think the one that killed me (warning: SPOILER AHEAD!) was the whole Gabriel reference.  So was Van Helsing actually and arch angel reborn near the end of the 19th Century?  Unfortunately, the movie ends while leaving this question unanswered/unexplained, so I'm sure a sequel will be in the works.  I honestly far preferred the Van Helsing described in ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", a learned scholar who hunted the undead as opposed to an unknowing, brawny adventurer who doesn't know the first thing about vampires.
The special effects were great, mixing in the familiar cheesiness with in-your-face CGI, thus making it one of the movie's strong points.  I was impressed by the werewolf transformation, but I have to admit that the death of Dracula was severely lacking.
To sum it up, see this movie for what it is: cheesy, loud, high action that won't make you think, and you won't be disappointed.",1084406400,,1366,4.862068965517241
2102656,1,B0002KVUKW,"I can't believe people enjoyed this film!! (...)
Stephen Sommers should hand in his Directors Guild card and stop making crap like this. ""Van Helsing"" is easily the worst film of the summer and it isn't even June yet!
Combining classic movie creatures into one feature film goes all the way back to just about the beginning of the horror genre. ""Van Helsing"" takes the ""classic"" creatures (Dracula, Frankenstein, and The Wolf Man) and combines them into a mish-mash plot that is stupid as it is frightless.
The film starts out strong with the classic birth of the Frankenstein monster, but, takes a bizarre twist when Dracula shows up to confront the mad doctor and save the monster from certain destruction by the hands of angry villagers. After that the film falls apart, alarmingly fast. Taking place a year after the opening events, the viewer is introduced to Van Helsing, who is doing battle with Mr. Hyde (he looks like ""Hulk"" leftovers from summer 2003, with an Irish accent). One unbelievable, ridiculous action sequence later, Van Helsing heads to The Vatican (which turns out to be an antique James Bond style MI5 complete with a friar who does his best ""Q"" imitation) and recieves orders to travel to Transylvania & take down The Prince of Darkness, Ozzy Os-er-uh, Dracula (""SHARON!!"").
Once in the Count's homeland, Van Helsing, with the ""Q"" wannabe friar, have a run in with the locals who think both are freshly made vampires. There accusations are wrong when the Dracula's brides show up (in the middle of the daytime, but, under cloudy skies) killing villagers at will & trying to capture a female gypsy (hottie, Kate Beckinsale) who poses a threat to there master. Before you can scream, ""X Men Unite!"", Van Helsing swings into action (with an assinine stake-gun thats a cross between a machine gun and a crossbow. Where's Buffy Summers when you need her?) scaring off the bloodsuckers.
As the movie slogs along, the viewer is introduced to the pointless arrival of The Wolf Man and also founds out Dracula's motives behind taking Frankenstein's Monster (an ass-clown plot thread involving Drac's lifeless offspring that resides in ""Alien"" like egg-cocoons, that once hatched, look like left over ""Gremlins"" with paper-machet wings).
How bad is this? I'd watch ""Howard the Duck"" backed with a viewing of last summer's ""Hulk"" in a heartbeat, than watch this celluloid turd again. The movie is horrible (I gave the film one star just to register this review!).
Jackman looks like he's trying out for a Broadway musical. Beckinsale has an uneven accent, & is overdressed (she looked better in the equally crappy ""Underworld"").
As for the creatures, they all deathly pale in comparison to their original counterparts. Dracula looks like the lost member of ""Duran, Duran"". The Wolf Man looks like he needs dogtags and a bath. Frankenstein reminded me way too much of Peter Boyle's performance as ""Young Frankenstein"" (I unintentionally laughed out loud twice when Frankie swung into action!). The film isn't  scary at all, or original. The SFX are sub-par at best (the first scene where Dracula walks up the side of the wall doesn't match up at all & Mr. Hyde is to cartoonish for his own good).
I could go on all day long, bashing this film, but, the true final nail in the coffin, for ""Van Helsing"", is that it is one of the biggest turkeys to come to theaters in a very long time.

2102657,4,B0002KVUKW,"Right now, there are a lot of opinions of Stephen Sommers' movie Van Helsing being slung around all over the internet. Some folks want you to believe that the movie is the worst thing ever commited to film and others are ready to convince you that Sommers is the next messiah of the horror flick. Well, I am here to tell you that the TRUTH of the matter is that the question is not really all that simple... and, at the same time, it IS all that simple.
Allow me to explain... and to re-ask the question that started off this review: why do you go to the movies? Do you want incredibly complex and believeble characters? Do you demand a convoluted plot that will take you days to mentall sort out in your head? Do you insist that everything that happen on the screen adhere to the same rules and laws of physics that our everyday reality does? If the answer to any of these questions is ""yes"" then you might want to stay away from Van Helsing.
On the other hand, if you go to the movies to have fun and enjoy yourself, if you like seeing old ideas presented in a new light, and if you don't mind part of your experience being ""eye candy"" then Van Helsing will definitely please you.
The crowd that will be the most divided over the film will be the fans of the old Universal monsters, I think. As you have probably heard from the hype surrounding the film, there are several from Universal's stable here and if your view of these classic monsters is purist then, once again, you might not want to try this film. If, though, you are willing to have a few (OK.... several) liberties taken with your old familiar friends then you just might find this movie to be the wild, fun-filled ride that I can only assume Sommers intended it to be.
There is very little character introspection or high minded moralization in this movie but what there IS (Action! Action! ACTION!!!) there is in spades and, in the end, I believe that the movie is well worth the time and the funds you will invest to see it.",1084406400,6,1993,4.331550802139038
2102658,3,B0002KVUKW,"I finally got to see Van Helsing today and I had really, really wanted to love this movie. Don't get me wrong, there is movies that are not considered high art and I love them to pieces but this movie, for a lack of better words, was dumb.
The thing that bugged me the most about this was that this movie reminded me of so many movies I have seen in the past and movies that I enjoyed too! Probably it reminded me the most of ""The Mummy"" and ""The Mummy Returns"" which is to be expected because the director of this movie was also the director of those two. It was terribly cliched and horrifically done.
There were some things that I really liked, I really liked the costuming and visuals. On the superficial level; this was a beautifully shot movie. I especially loved the corset/leather pants combo that Kate Beckingsale wore and the metrosexual Dracula suit that Richard Roxbourgh wore as well. I loved the snowcapped Carpathians and the slight gothic motifs. The Halloween ball scene was the most beautiful in the whole movie.
The acting was bad either; I think all actors did fine with what they had but in the same breath, the accents were annoying. I was so glad that Hugh Jackman didn't embrace a German accent for this. Most of the cast was British in origin and I felt that it was strange having a bunch of Brits do a Romanian accent. I could make exceptions but the accents really did start to get on my nerves.
The sad thing overall, I could make exceptions but the plot was so horrific that it couldn't be redeemed. So, if you really want to see it, rent it on DVD.
Some minor notes:
- I adored Frankstein's monster in this; it was the only character not bastardized.
- I loved the friar and the underkeeper as well; they gave some humor to the script as well.
- Dracula's brides, yummy. They can nibble on me any time they like.
- The soundtrack was great and would love to have it on CD.
- Why was there a pair of Tibetian monks in Catholic order that Van Helsing belonged to.

2102661,3,B0002KVUKW,"I had very high hopes for Van Helsing.  I thought that it would be a good concept to combine Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster and the Wolfman.  I didn't really expect a deep story line and the best acting.  I was expecting a lot of action and something to keep me entertained for two hours and change, and thats what I got with Van Helsing.
The story is about Van Helsing (Jackman) getting sent to Transylvannia to kill Dracula.  Why he was all of a sudden sent there now is a mystery, since Dracula has existed for 400 years.  Dracula wants to use Frankenstein's Monster in order to give his children enough power to survive and continue to have vampires exist.  Anna Valerious (Beckinsale) is trying to kill Dracula in order to fulfill her family's destiny.  These are the main plot points of this movie.
Hugh Jackman plays Gabriel Van Helsing, a man who is ""employed"" by the Vatican to stop evil doers.  He is a very religious man, whom is in a constant inner struggle about if what he is doing (killing people) is righteous.  Jackman does a good job for what he was given.  I really hope that he excells as a big action star, but this role reminds me a lot of his Wolverine character from the X-Men series.  Kate Beckinsale is alright in the movie, mainly a pleasure to look at.  Dracula really annoyed me throughout the movie, along with Frankenstein's monster.
The best part of this movie was clearly the action scenes, and believe me, there were a lot of them.  This movie did not really have too many boring parts.  I don't like how every action scene was CGI and no stunt men doing what they do best.  I guess I'm kinda old school and occasionally like to see stunt men doing the stunts, instead of a computer animation.  Van Helsing is not a bad movie.  I wouldn't say that its a good movie either.  Its more good than it is bad.  Its basically an action movie that keeps you entertained throughout the movie.",1084233600,3,1918,4.459770114942529
2102662,2,B0002KVUKW,"This movie is souless.  Its not bad and its not good.  In fact, its so boring it's barely watchable.  The writing is absolutely atrocious.  It's as if they piece the script together from other films.  It absolutely brings nothing original to the screen.  You seen everything here before done much much better.  The actors seem as if they are mailing in their performances.  And that crap with the Friar and tying him into Q from James Bond almost made me want to leave the theater.  I've seen Van Helsing played better by older men with less effect and no modern weapons.  Obvious the blame is squarely on Sommers.  All he did was took his shell from The Mummy and inserted different characters.  He had no idea what to do with his leading lady and his leading man, as the same with the Mummy, is just trying to be a weaker version of Indiana Jones.  You will recognize all sorts of films in this movie: Mask of Zorro, The Mummy, Underworld (with all the blue in the movie), James Bond, Indiana Jones.  It's just a formula film whose formula needs to be retired.  There is absolutely no passion in this film.  No risk taking, nothing that WOWS you.  You would only see this movie once you exhaust all other ideals on what to do with your evening.  And guess what, you can tell it's lifeless from the previews.  And the funny part of it all, is that you pull for this film to be better while you are watching it.  You want them to go that extra steps, but apparently the director just doesn't have the confidence to do so and in the end the audience gets cheated.",1084233600,,1562,4.376306620209059
2102663,4,B0002KVUKW,"Although one may be inclined to cast Van Helsing as a knock off of Hollywood Classics, based on the previews, once you've seen the movie it's easy to see that it's not so. They have taken cinematic legends such as Dracula, the Wolf Man and Frankenstein and given them new dimensions and linking plot lines.
  The movie, at nearly two and a half hours long, has enough fight (or if you will in the case of Dracula's brides, flight) scenes, and enough mystery that it only suffers from slow moments in a scene or two.  The high points are that while the plot is interesting, it is not too complex to follow, and the cinematography is visually stunning (although a bit dreary at times, but what do you expect given the subject matter.) Also, while it is a movie that brings in horror classics there is very little of the associated blood and gore that goes along with the genre, a good point in my book.
  The low points of the movies are that the charatacters are not always very fleshed out, particularly Beckensale's ""Anna Valeria"" but again, with the speed of the plot it is easy to forgive that; and that the soundtrack's instistant volume occassionaly makes it hard to understand the dialouge.
  A point that could be both good and bad is the reliance on CGI to make the movie more visually spectacular but at the same time does take away from some of the realism (again though, with the subject matter what does what expect, documentary?)
  Don't discard this movie based on what professional critics are saying or by the admittedly hard to understand previews. See it and judge for yourself.",1084233600,12,1596,4.591549295774648

2102665,2,B0002KVUKW,I was really disappointed in this movie. The girl was the chick from Underworld so I thought it would be aweasome and since we was just human there was nothing special about here. The previews make the movie look better than it was. Althought the Wolfman and Dracula were aweasome. That is the best Wolfman I have seen in awhile it was even better than American Werewolf in London and Paris and I think thoes are two great werewolf films. Dracula was so cool and so sexy but the movie overall was not that great and really boring I almost fell asleep. The Frankenstien was pathetic.,1084233600,,582,4.5
2102666,4,B0002KVUKW,"With the Success of ""The Mummy"" and ""The Mummy Returns"", it was no surprise that Universal Pictures gave writer/director Stephen Sommers the green light to use the big three: Dracula, the Wolfman, and Frankenstein's monster, in a big budget action/horror movie.  And while ""Van Helsing"" is more action and less horror, it is still an entertaining ride.
Van Helsing (Jackman) is a monster hunter that secretly works for a religious organization that polices the supernatural.  He is sent to Transylvania to stop Count Dracula (Roxburgh).  Dracula is searching for Frankenstein's monster, because he holds the key to bringing Dracula's evil spawn to life.  Aided by a local vampire hunter by the name of Anna (Beckinsale), they venture forth to stop the evil blood sucker.
""Van Helsing"" is a very loud movie that is relentless in its action.  There is very little down time for the viewer to catch his breath.  While that would be good in a shorter movie, at 135 minutes it is a bit tiring.  The special effects are on par with the Mummy movies, that is to say, good but not great, and that suits the tone of the movie just fine.  ""Van Helsing"" is a great start to the summer blockbuster season.",1084233600,6,1193,4.757281553398058
2102667,4,B0002KVUKW,"About a half hour before I was to see this movie I overheard someone commenting on it. I believe the word ""mediocre"" was applied to it. After seeing it it seems understandable that someone would indeed apply that word, however, it was entertaining enough to justify seeing it.
Being a big fan of vampire flicks--well, all things vampire actually--and other assorted monster and myths stories I was really looking forward to the release of Van Helsing. It's always interesting to put such powerful creatures in the same room and watch how they play and the trailers for this movie lead one to believe that they did a good job. Which they really didn't. The creatures are obviously underutilized.
A big sticking point for me was Dracula. And since most of the movie hinges on that one character it's not a good thing. Unfortunately I have no idea as to who the actor is playing the role of the legendary count, but his melodramatic performance, which I do believe was done purposely, really lacked luster for me. There is a scene in which Beckinsale's character, Anna, is suppose to be under the vampire's spell--it was utterly unconvincing and not at all her fault. There was nothing seductive, powerful, or compelling about the actor they chose to play Dracula. And those are all, to my mind, very necessary traits for the man playing the vampire. The power of the character lies, in part, in the fact that, though he is horribly evil, you don't want him to die. Sure, you want good to triumph, but perhaps not at the cost of losing such a beautiful presence. I really could not have cared less about Dracula in this movie. I sat there thinking, ""Oh, come on already, Van Helsing, get it over with."" Not a good thing indeed.
The werewolf was rather silly. Very fake in appearance and you are unsure as to where the initial wolf came from. How Dracula came to have a hold on him/it. Frankenstein's monster was ok, I suppose. Though his character was suppose to be tormented and that really didn't come across. These are two very powerful monsters in the horror canon and they were treated almost laughably in this movie. Such a shame.
Hugh Jackman, though I had reservations about him in the role, wasn't bad at all. He didn't have much to work with in terms of the script, but he had certain mannerisms that carried well and made him a little more believable. There are hints of a very intriguing history behind his character, but they aren't explored to the extent that they could have been. The actor who played his sidekick (again, I unfortunately cannot recall his name) was very amusing. Another reviewer thought his character should have been written out entirely, but the movie would have been even more lacking for his loss. As silly as his one or two liners might have been, they were cute and made me chuckle and I thought he was a perfect compliment to Van Helsing's seriousness.
Anyone seeing this moive must keep in mind that it is ""fantasy"" as well as ""horror"". The monsters aren't real and therefore it's unreasonable to expect the stunts/action sequences to be realistic. In The Lord of the Rings trilogy (yes, I know it's almost unfair to use this as an example, but...) Legolas never ran out of arrows, but no one dismayed over that.
Overall, Van Helsing fell short of the mark. It had a lot of potential, but couldn't quite fulfill it's promise. Despite that, I still thought it was enjoyable and entertaining. If you have some time on your hands and want to spend it in a dark movie theater, it wouldn't be a bad choice.",1084233600,3,3540,4.629570747217806
2102668,5,B0002KVUKW,"This is a highly entertaining film with loads of technical expertise similar to the Matrix films. The computer graphic artistry is expert. It is a modern version of classic films with themes including Dracula, Frankenstein, Werewolves, Brides of Dracula, *plus*, a swashbuckling adventurer, named Van Helsing, who on certain levels, resembles a darker, cutting-edge, mysterious ""Indiana Jones"", added to this is, a 'secret' religious group within the Catholic church that is 'fighting the worst kind of evil' resembling an off-spring of the ""Da Vinci Code"". Overall, the film was a huge hit with this viewer and the audience who sat in the same theater ...
It is non-stop action and in this sense, resembles the Matrix ... The film begins with scenes of magnificent snow-capped mountains, quaint villages with spired onion-domed steepled churches, hordes of peasants in revolt, trying to break into the castle while crossing the moat ... Dr. Hyde (Victor) has created a 'monster', Frankenstein ... Victor is killed and Dracula seeks to steal the machine which produces 'life' ...so that his 'off-spring' with his brides may be brought to life. for 400 years Dracula has been forced to drink the blood of the local peasants, but to his credit ... he never takes more than he needs (such a nice guy and handsome, too). Velkion and Anna, the son and daughter of Count Valerius of Transylvania are trying to fight Dracula and his vampire entourge (who just happen to be mostly -- no, in fact, *all* are females). Velkion, the handsome young count becomes a 'werewolf' during one of the fights against the evil forces which haunt this village. Van Helsing receives orders from a secret Catholic organization, he is to go to Transylvania to overthrow the powers of evil which are growing there and may overtake Europe. He receives James Bond-like modern weapons created by Karl, a friar, who is a modest-looking scientific expert. He becomes Van Helsing's side-kick in this adventure. Furthermore, he brings along a parchment, with an undecipherable Latin phrase that later fits into the mural on the wall. It becomes the 'missing piece' providing the ""secet"" to the entrance to Dracula's castle. The battle between ""good and evil"" ensues ... again, the resemblence to the Matrix is very evident but with lots of differences. The transformations of human into monster and back to human are quite creative and realistic, computer artistry at its best.
The casting and acting for the most part are superb. Richard Roxburgh plays Dracula with finesse. He looks authentically like a Transylvanian, complete with believable Eastern European accent. His clothes and manners are impeccable. His upper class haughtiness is perfect. Van Helsing is a great action hero,a true fighter for the cause. Hoswever, he is a let-down in the area of romance. The scenes with him and Anna (Kate Beckinsdale) do not *sizzle* ... unfortunately, our hero is much more interested in his *job* than *this* temptation, a tangential romantic relationship ... too bad ... that is the only reason I gave it *FOUR* and not *FIVE* stars. Of course, Van Helsing is not to blame, it is the writer. Nonetheless, even with this one flaw, I highly recommend this film. Great fun and entertainment.

2102669,5,B0002KVUKW,"Hugh Jackman takes the title role in this horror / action flick about Vampires, Werewolves and Frankenstein's monster, in an excellent recreation of 1880's Transylvania. I had my doubts as to just how all three legendary monsters would be incorporated into a single story, but the end result is very cleverly handled, written and directed. Making this kind of movie believable should never be the director's aim (considering the subject matter) but making it plausible should be, and one or two minor grumbles aside, Stephen Sommer's has done an excellent job in my opinion. Remaining true to many aspects of the original horror flicks of the 30's, but bringing a 21st century flavor, with some magnificent set design, and truly suspenseful sequences all add to the feel of the picture. The acting performances are strong, not only from Jackman, whose character is given a mysterious edge almost as strange as his quarry, but also Richard Roxburgh who is deliciously evil as the malevolent Count, and Kate Beckinsale as the heroine. Some clever comic relief from David Wenham as the knowledgeable bookworm friar, who accompanies Van Helsing on his mission, blends well with a very fast paced, and action packed story, and all the other performances are better than average. At 2hr and 25minutes this is not a short picture, but races along at such a speed, the viewer could be forgiven for thinking it was about 90 minutes. Some scary moments, and even scarier monsters (albeit CGI) ensure the R rating, but otherwise this is NOT a blood fest, or overly gory horror picture, and constantly remains faithful to the fantastical elements of the classic horror genre. I quickly forgave the unlikely portrayal of the hero's being able to take unbelievable physical punishment, and liked but felt the 007 style equipment lab a little misplaced at the beginning of the picture. These two minor points aside, this is a thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining movie. I gave it 5 stars as I couldn't give it 4.5. Great Fun!",1084233600,6,2011,4.970326409495549
2102670,2,B0002KVUKW,"I expected very little from Van Helsing and that's exactly what I got. The hero Gabriel Van Helsing is such a stiff I couldn't wait for the monsters to appear so he'd show some kind of personality. Hugh Jackman seemed to be sleepwalking through the role and the character is confusing. Is this an account of young Abraham VanHelsing's adventures of is this some other member of the VH clan and why is he dressed like a Japanese cartoon? By the time the movie is over you won't even care.
The villain, Dracula is a pretty poor spectacle. Richard Roxburgh wouuldn't even scare a timid baby. George Hamilton once played Dracula for laughs but poor Roxburgh was trying to be serious. Frakenstein's monster and the Wolfman are just thrown in for the heck of it.
The movie  does have one thing going for it: if you are one of those poeple who feel the need to talk back to the actors on screen or to loudly complain about how dumb the  plotline is VanHelsing will make you very, very happy.

2102672,1,B0002KVUKW,"I remember a long time ago a small movie called The Monster Squad. I saw it when I was a wee lad, and loved it. Now I know it is absolute crap, but it is still enjoyable to watch. So when they announced this movie I was excited. Not only did it have some of the best movie monsters in it, it was being directed by Stephen Sommers. I really enjoyed his Mummy movies. Then came the trailers and the early reviews and I pretty much gave up all hope on this movie. I wanted it to be good because of the cast and the premise, but deep down I knew it wouldn't be. My lower expatiations may have helped a little because this movie wasn't as bad as I expected. It just was only a little better.
 The movie opens up like part of the original Frankenstein film, in complete black and white and with the monster being made. Only this time in the background is Dracula (Roxburgh) who wants to use the monster as a way to bring his dead babies to life. Frankenstein refuses and of course Dracula kills him, but the monster escapes and of course leads to the town mob going after him in the now classic windmill sequence. The story then cuts to Gabriel Van Helsing (Jackman) killing Mr. Hyde and being sent to Transylvania to battle Dracula. He gets help from a friar (Lord of the Rings Wenham) and a local woman (Beckinsale), whose family will never rest in heaven until Dracula is defeated. Along the way Van Helsing battles the brides of Dracula, the wolfman, Dracula's kids, and of course Dracula himself.
 So let's get on to the review portion shall we? What is good about this movie? Not much, the set designs are really nice especially Frankensteins lab. But the performance don't help the movie one bit. Not to say that there weren't good performances. I was astounded to learn that Wenham was in the movie. Wenham played Faramir in Lord of the Rings, but it was hard to make that out. He played the usual side kick but there was some glee in his performances. He was without a doubt the best character in the movie. Also notable was Kevin J O'Conner as Igor. Not just for the makeup job but the character made me laugh. It almost reminded me of his character in The Mummy, but funnier. I like Hugh Jackman. I think he is a good actor, but he felt like he was just going through the lines in this movie. Unlike in other movies where he was the character, here he just seemed like he was collecting a paycheck. Likewise with Beckinsale and Roxburgh. No real performances by either of them.
 Now I don't expect much of Stephen Sommers. He isn't the greatest writer, nor the best director. Of his previous work all I cared for were ,as said earlier, the Mummy films. But I think he has hit a low with this one. Not quite as bad as Deep Rising but close. He made this movie with too much of a serious tone. He reminds me of Lucas and the Star Wars prequels, which I enjoy. But he seems too much in love with his special effects rather then the story. This brings me to the special effects. Am I the only one here who thinks that ILM's work is going downhill? I use to love their effects. I mean they did T2 and Jurassic Park, among others. But now it is becoming too cartoonish in look and style. Mr. Hyde (while not as bad looking as LXG) looked halarious. Amazing how they can make something so fake and try to pawn it off as real. The score by Alan Silvestri was fun, and actually overcomplimented the movie. Silvestri previously worked with Sommers in The Mummy Returns and they keep their strong partnership going in this movie. But the score is just wasted on this movie.
 Now remember, I really wanted to like this movie. It could have been a brilliant movie, a throwback to the old movies but instead it ruins what those movies. The film is silly, but not fun. It has mainly wooden performances and cartoonish special effects. I also find it amazing the logistics of the movie. On how Van Helsing can have a gas powered crossbow that shoots off 200 arrows in a minute yet still can't hit a vampire in the heart that is right in front of him. Nit pick, I know, but that is what came to mind during the movie. But if you are looking for a good movie, go elsewhere. This movie will not satisfy you in the least bit. What is good about the movie can not cover the feeling that you get when you leave this movie, that of pure dread at the direction that movies are heading.",1084147200,3,4366,4.294902912621359

The brains behind Van Helsing completely threw logic and reason to the wind and ended up with a movie that can only be described as fun. No one involved with this movie, from the actors to the costume designers (once again, spandex in the victorian age??) seemed to be taking themselves very seriously and just had a good time with the flick... so naturally nobody else should be taking this movie to seriously either, its a good campy time at the movies",1084147200,,628,4.566371681415929

That hasn't happened since Joel Schumacher screwed up Batman and Robin. I didn't have high hopes to begin with, I figured Van Helsing would be like a roller coaster ride.  But even on that level it failed.  The actor playing Dracula did a passable Lugosi accent, with some traces of Peter Lorre, but he couldn't do anything with the part.  Everyone shouted each line of dialogue like it was a show stopper, but they didn't even qualify as a knee-slapper.  The movie was a kaleidoscope of pastiches from earlier better movies.  The monster design was uninspired, and looked far too rubbery.  The Frankenstein monster looked like a cross between a robot, and David Prowses's monster in ... .

2102677,3,B0002KVUKW,"I can just imagine the production crew meeting at Universal Studios before VAN HELSING was launched:
""Let's make a 130-minute horror/adventure film and make sure every frame is filled with either blood, fangs, snarls, or CGI.""
Mission accomplished.  VAN HELSING, based on a character plucked from Braum Stoker's ""Dracula,"" is a visual onslaught of Transylvanian proportions that never--ever--lets up.  The movie looks good, especially with its opening black and white sequence depicting Frankenstein's castle under siege by enraged peasants, and certainly delivers enough thrills and chills to satisfy any ghoul lover.  Yet, after awhile, all the chaos and mayhem become as long in the tooth as the fangs on the vampires.
The story itself is surprisingly lame: Count Dracula must use Frankenstein's monster as a conduit to bring to life legions of
little vampire/bat offspring to wage war on mankind; the evil Count also uses werewolves to wipe out the last generation of a rival family; Van Helsing is dispatched by a secret Vatican society to clean up the mess.  With vampires, werewolves, Frankenstein's monster, and even a brief dose of Jekyll and Hyde, this movie has as much on its plate as a five-gallon tub at a buffet.  Pardon the pun, but VAN HELSING bites off more than it can chew.
Hugh Jackman as Van Helsing is your typical one-dimensional, unemotional superhero.  David Wenham is the film's comic relief, although I liked him much better as Faramir in ""The Lord of the Rings.""  Richard Roxburgh as the scheming, diabolical Dracula reminded me of Bela Lugosi with a ponytail.  And femme fatale Kate Beckinsale can tap me on the shoulder to tango any time she wants.
Don't get me wrong:  I was entertained by this movie.  I particularly liked how the vampires would dislocate their jaws to depict sprouting fangs like mushrooms sticking out of a pile of manure.

Ten minutes before my parents and I drove to LOEW'S THEATERS in Cherry Hill to see this amazing movie, my father told me that the newspaper critics gave their reviews on the movie. The newspaper critics, again, tried to tell us something that was unbelievably false. They said the movie was not worth watching. We all know that they are speaking for all of us. May I remind you that the newspaper critics are nobodies, they are nothing, just like the lives they lead. The opinions of those newspaper critics do not count because the critics are morons with lives that are nothing. To the amazon reviewers who also said the movie sucked, get a life. You all do nothing but post reviews on movies you didn't like. If you didn't like the movie, then don't post your review on it because your opinions don't matter.
  VAN HELSING has to be the best movie I've seen this year. I spent $40 on four tickets (the other three tickets went to my mother, father, and lil' brother) and we all got our money's worth. The movie is jam packed with action, horror, a touch of comedy, and special effects that are outstandingly incredible. HUGH JACKMAN is in the role of GABRIEL VAN HELSING, an intelligent man who hunts the monsters that terrorize different parts of the world. After destroying MR. HYDE, the horrifying alter ego created by DR. JEKYL, VAN HELSING is given a new assignment: He must go to TRANSYLVANIA and destroy the evil DRACULA. Dracula and his brides plan to use DR. VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN'S horrifying, monster to bring life to their offspring. Dracula also plans to destroy the last two members of a family he has been killing for centuries: VALEK and his sister, ANNA.
  KATE BECKINSALE is in the role of the charmingly beautiful ANNA. ANNA and her brother VALEK are the last two members of their family. DRACULA has sent the WOLFMAN to destroy VALEK, but VALEK receives something much worse than death: THE CURSE OF THE WEREWOLF. Now, with the help of VAN HELSING, ANNA must destroy her brother and DRACULA before DRACULA destroys them both and unleashes a new breed of terror and evil on all of Transylvania.
  HUGH JACKMAN was outstanding in his performance of VAN HELSING. I don't think any other actor out there would have given a performance as good as HUGH JACKMAN's.

2102682,2,B0002KVUKW,"All the monsters showcased in ""Van Helsing"" are merely there to detract the audience away from the absurd story. It is obvious that director Stephen Sommers wanted to make a monster movie but was unable to make up his mind on which classic monster to use. Therefore, he decides to just throw a bunch of them into this movie and write the action around them.
Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) is honored with being the vanquisher of monsters. Sporting a long coat and a raven hat, Van Helsing hunts for monsters that prey on humans and instead of being a hero figure to the public, he is a wanted man. A man misinterpreted by the people outside of his world. Van Helsing himself is like a mixture of Blade and Batman because he always seems to have the right gadgets to get him out of serious situations. Coincidentally, Van Helsing is also like Wolverine, which was also played by Hugh Jackman, for they both have no memory about the past and are driven by the urge to remember something.
The only thing that kept me motivated when watching ""Van Helsing"" is the ambiance. I admire the look of the opening scene. I fancied the edifices, especially Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory, and also approve of the appearance of Frankenstein himself. We are treated with a gorgeous look of a half-built Eiffel Tower. Externally the movie is delightful but it got too monotonous. There is an interesting and comical commentary near the movie that pokes fun of itself and other movies similar to ""Van Helsing.""

She's just there to be tossed around by the bad guys and to serve as the object of Van Helsing's lust. I thought Hollywood had moved past that, but apparently I was wrong. Van Helsing himself is completely uninteresting. He has ancient memories, he has past history with Dracula, he's the ""left hand of God"" - whatever. I couldn't bring myself to care about any of it. It didn't really have anything to do with the story anyway. The only good part was the character of Dracula. He was campishly(is that a word?) cool. But, all in all, it was a waste of my money. Now, Underworld, there was a good fantasy-action movie.",1084060800,,933,4.4941176470588236
2102684,4,B0002KVUKW,"I thought like THE MUMMY and THE MUMMY RETURNS -- VAN HELSING is a good popcorn movie.  It moves from one action sequence to the next without any slow parts, and overall has great special effects.  Great cinematography and design.  And a good loud score to match!  Go to it expecting a good old fashioned monster mash and you'll be okay.
For nitpickers -- I do have a question to ponder. (...)  Dracula and his brides want to bring to life their ""babies"".  Okay - I thought VAMPIRES reproduced by biting people and creating more vampires.  So where are these ""babies' coming from?  And they certainly are not humanoid.  They seem to be baby bats!  And they are born in huge pods!?!?!  Geez.  I don't want to see that birth -- a pretty frequent occurence by the looks of the movie.  I am picturing these brides walking around the castle ""Oh my!  I have dropped another pod!  Could you pick that up for me?""
Also if Frankenstein is the ""key"" to the life machine ... how did he come to life in the first place?  Hmmmm.  Who was the conduit for his resurrection or birth?
(...)
I could go on, but in the end these questions do not ruin the entertainment value of a good monster movie.  It's fun and exciting even if a little silly!",1084060800,,1227,4.353982300884955
2102685,2,B0002KVUKW,"Don't go into this film expecting a coherent and well written story or for the hairs on the back of your neck to stand on end because you'll be disappointed. The story is a mess and there's not much here that'll give you the creeps. Action is the name of the game here, not horror.
The only performers who succeed in standing out from the CGI effects that crowd almost every frame are David Wenham as Carl, Van Helsings assistant, the always excellent Richard Roxburgh as Dracula and Kevin J O'Connor as Igor. Wenham gets all the best lines and steals every scene he appears in. Roxburgh has a ball hamming it up as the Count, and O'Connor is a riot as Igor. Unfortunately Hugh Jackman can't do much with the underwritten character of Van Helsing and can't help but look faintly embarrassed wearing that ridiculous hat. He looks more like an action figure than a real human being.
This is yet another Hollywood blockbuster that expects audiences to leave their intelligence at home and just mindlessly watch the CGI effects with a willing smile on their faces. You may think I am being mean-spirited, but I'm tired of being told that movies like this are just escapist fare and don't need a good story. You have to wonder if the apologists for films like this have seen classic all-ages adventure films like Superman, Raiders Of The Lost Ark and The Rocketeer. This film looks more like a Playstation game than a real film. It's a bloated commercial for merchandising rather than an original and smart updated homage to the classic Universal 1930s/1940s monster movies.
I'd give this a one star rating but it is worth seeing for the performances of Wenham, Roxburgh and O'Connor. They are a timely reminder that actors can be a helluva lot more fun than millions of dollars worth of CGI.",1084060800,,1787,4.658227848101266
2102686,1,B0002KVUKW,"I didn't want to see Van Helsing in the first place, but my friends talked me into it.  I was not disappointed because I went into the film with low expectations.  My expectations proved valid.  What the makers of this film have done to the character of Van Helsing is a disgrace.  In the original Dracula novel, Professor Van Helsing is the scientist and scholar who uses his wisdom and knowledge to defeat the evil of Dracula.  Its sort of a metaphor of science's victory over superstition.
The makers of the Van Helsing films have taken this character and turned him into a long haired, pretty boy vampire hunter more akin to Buffy the Vampire Slayer than the character for which he is named.  Doing this to Van Helsing would be like taking Sherlock Holmes and turning him into a Rambo like character that blasts Professor Moriarty with machine guns.  I am sick of modern movie makers taking gothic horror stories, situations, and characters, and turning them into amped-up action films.  Now, the one exception would be the Mummy, because they did do a good update to that character, a big improvement over the old bandage swathed skulking villain of yesteryear.
That being said, they could have made an acceptable action based film of this sort, with the Van Helsing character.  You make Van Helsing true to what his character should be (the old, wise scientist), and team him up with a young Hugh Jackman character that is a vampire hunter.  Brains and brawn brought together to defeat the monsters.  But what they did with this film is absolutely disgraceful.
The only good thing that has come out of Van Helsing's release is that Universal has re-released many of the classic horror films from the 30's and 40's to DVD as a marketing tool.  I will buy the old films on DVD.  When Van Helsing comes out on DVD, it will not be on my shopping list.",1084060800,2,1853,4.629969418960244
2102687,4,B0002KVUKW,"I thoroughly enjoyed Stephen Sommers' new action/adventure flick, Van Helsing, starring the charismatic Hugh Jackman and beautiful Kate Beckinsale.
Fresh from her vampire role in the excellent ""Underworld,"" Kate looks and acts the part as the mysterious and brave Anna Valerious.  Hugh Jackman is always excellent in everything he does and he plays Gabriel Van Helsing with his signature charm, bravado and magnetism.  Richard Roxburgh (Count Dracula), Shuler Hensley (Frankenstein's monster), Kevin O'Connor (Igor) and Will Kemp (Wolfman) round out the excellent supporting cast.  The most surprising role of all, however, is the fabulous David Wenham (Faramir in ""The Lord of the Rings"") who is funny, charming and adorable as Van Helsing's sidekick Carl.  His smart, ironic monk-in-training steals every scene he is in!  I also adored the handsome Will Kemp (as Velkan Valerious), who, unfortunately, had less screen time than his alter ego, the Wolfman.
The highlights for me are the stellar cast, fast and exciting action sequences, thrilling chase / fight scenes and Alan Silvestri's throbbing score.  I rate the film 4 stars mainly because some of the CGI still needs to be perfected. Admittedly, my idea of seamless visual effects is that of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy (ie. Gollum) so any movie compared to this pales in comparison: for instance, Mr. Hyde in the beginning and the big fight between two of the main creature characters in the climax need a bit of work.  However, the CGI/stunt work on the flying banshees/Dracula's brides are very well done as are the cinematography, art direction and sets/locations.
This film is what summer movies are all about - big, brash, fun and exciting.  ""Van Helsing"" fully lived up to my expectations and my friends and I had great fun watching it. I recommend this to horror/fantasy/adventure film fans, Hugh Jackman/Kate Beckinsale/David Wenham fans and anyone who enjoys a good time (and a couple of scares) in the movies!",1084060800,2,1982,5.171875
2102688,5,B0002KVUKW,"I went to go see Van Helsing with very high expectations for it. I'd done a lot of reading on the film and knew what the plot was going to be. I'm a fan of Stephen Sommers and I've been impressed with the movies he's done in the past. Van Helsing is the first real summer blockbuster of the year and Sommers doesn't disappoint.
The plot to Van Helsing is pretty simple. Gabrielle Van Helsing(Jackman)works for the catholic church for an organization that doesn't exist. He's sent by the Vatican to Transylvania to kill Count Dracula(Roxburgh). Time is of the essence because of the Valerious family. They are a family that is sworn to an oath were they can't enter heaven if Dracula is not killed and they will be doomed to purgatory. The beautiful Anna(Beckinsale) is the only living member left of the family and hope looks bleak. The church won't let the Valerious family just die so Van Helsing and his Q-like Friar friend Clark(Wenham)are sent to Transylvania. I won't reveal any more of the plot because I feel it takes away from the fun of the movie.
Hugh Jackman is great as Van Helsing. The character is a fun and mysterious one. We never learn a whole lot about him and it adds to some fun mystery. It's been reported there will be two sequels and hopefully we can get little more character background. Jackman still excels as the action hero and between this role and his job as Wolverine in X-men he is showing he can be one of the top guys in Hollywood in this genre of movies.
I liked Kate Beckinsale a lot in the movie. She is absolutely gorgeous in the film. I was surprised to see her in this film trying to kill Vampires after the succes she had as the vampire Salene in Underworld. Some would say her talents as an actress are wasted, but this is a summer action movie. You don't go to see her performance. You go to look at her and the special effects. Who cares about her performance.
The special effects are outstanding in Van Helsing. Stephen Sommers has shown us from his previous movies The Mummy and Mummy Returns that his movies have great effects. The transformations in the movie are great. Every time one of Dracula's brides or a the Werewolfs change I kept wondering how much it cost to make because it looks great. The CGI is great and is the second best eyecandy in the movie behind Beckinsale.
Stephen Sommers is really showing that he makes fun blockbuster movies. It's obvious he doesn't care that his movies are overproduced and overmade because they are fun. The guy just makes fun overthetop action movies. I hope he does a sequel to this.
Go see this movie and have fun. It's an over the top movie that is fun. It's a fun new twist to some classic monsters that will bring back memories and make new ones at the same time. This is the best action movie of the year. Don't miss out on it.",1084060800,2,2827,4.428023032629558
2102689,2,B0002KVUKW,"I really wanted to like this movie but it falls short. Almost non-stop action the whole time- unfortunately this gets repetitive after a while, as do the computer-generated affects, some of which, particularly the brides of Dracula, are admitedly impressive. However, others such as the Mr. Hyde CG character looked more like something out of 'Shrek'. Beckinsale's accent was cartoonish. Her and Jackman's acting talents are mostly wasted as there is little character developement. And the plot--Dracula needs Frankenstein to give life to his thousands of dead vampire babies. Huh??
  Save your money and get out your ""An American Werewolf in London"" or ""Interview with a Vampire"" DVD's for some truly satisfying horror-genre entertainment.",1084060800,,740,5.482456140350878
2102690,2,B0002KVUKW,"I give this movie two stars just because the FX are pretty good, the action is very dynamic (somewhat MATRIX style) and the women are very, very hot! The acting was not good except for the main character, and the plot is as simple as a blank page. Overall: MEDIOCRE.",1084060800,,266,4.34
2102691,3,B0002KVUKW,"Um, well, it's definitely entertaining. If you want to watch a mindless film full of action and special effects, go ahead. If you want to see Dracula and Frankenstein, go ahead. If you want to see Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckensale, well, go ahead. But, if you want to see a movie you'll remember for more than five minutes, stay away. The simple fact is that Van Helsing is one of the most generic films in a long time. The plot is roughly about the angel Gabriel (Hugh Jackman) also known as Van Helsing, who is employed by the Vatican to exterminate evil. Evil such as vampires, ware wolfs, Mr. Hide, and of course Count Dracula. He is sent to Transylvania to put an end to Dracula's evil doings, and to keep Kate Beckensale alive. Frankenstein is rather oddly portrayed as a nice person, who just wants to be left alone, (laughs) but is needed by Dracula as a source of electricity to jump start his spawn (more laughs). But, the story `unravels', actually fairly dull, as Mr. Helsing is bitten by a warewolf (OoooNoooo!) but is quite handy in the end, I won't give it away. This brings me to my next point, the ending. I will struggle in finding a film with a cushier ending, the last thirty seconds made me laugh at the producers and script writers. You need to see it, just for comedy value.
The characters never really develop and are always very one-dimensional. The acting is not wooden, but the actors just aren't given the chance to flex their muscles. Hugh Jackman certainly looks the part, occasionally says something with a deep voice, so is perfect for the part. Dracula, looks and sounds ridiculous, he has a very feminine looking hairpiece with a ponytail, the most homosexual Dracula ever to caress our screens. The other point is the general idiosyncrasy of the Eastern European accent, they all have bizarre lisps and sound very peculiar. The lisp adds to the homosexuality of Dracula. The guys who made this film were probably feminists.
Overall an ordinary film, the plot is ludicrous in places and very far fetched. The acting is adequate but the characters are very mundane.
I found the film as more a action, fantasy kind of unintentional comedy. So, probably a hit with kids, or mindless people, don't expect to be blown away.",1084060800,4,2251,4.644110275689223
2102692,2,B0002KVUKW,"Van Helsing is Stephen Sommers newest attempt at recreating a classic monster movie.  The only problem with this movie, unlike his Mummy movies, he tried too much in one movie.  Instead of remaking Frankenstein or Dracula, he made a movie with Dracula, Frankenstein, the Wolfman, Dr. Jekell and Mr. Hyde, and more.  It was way too much, and would have been much better if the movie focused on one monster instead of including them all.
As for the movie itself.  It's about a man named Van Helsing who works for a secret society who kills and covers up monsters in Europe.  As a mission, Van Helsing is sent to Transivania where he must kill Dracula and save the last remaining member of a cursed family.
That's the basic story without giving too much away.  A big problem that I had with the movie was that it took too much from other movies.  The biggest take from another movie was the James Bond story formula.  The movie started out with an action filled scene showing what Van Helsing does.  The next scene was at the headquaters of the secret society that he worked for where he was given a mission and gadgets to help him on his mission.  He then set out on his mission for the rest of the movie and completed it.
Something else taken from another movie was the idea of the Secret Society who covered up monsters in Europe.  This reminded me of Men In Black about a secret society who covers up aliens.
Another one that I could think of is from Pirates of the Carribean.  At the end of Van Helsing, Van Helsing gets bit by a werewolf and is able to destroy Dracula since the only thing that can kill him is a werewolf bite.  Van Helsing then is able to get an antidote and turn back to human.  In Pirates, Jack Sparrow takes gold out of the cursed treasure chest so he could become immortal and defeat captain Barbosa, and then return the gold with his blood on it to turn back to human.
Also, the last and final thing that I could think of taken from other movies was Hugh Jackman's character ""Wolverine"" in X-Men.  In X-Men, Wolverene is a mutant who has blades in his hands making large metal claws.  He also has dreams about how he got his claws.  In Van Helsing, Hugh Jackman turned into a werewolf, and was often seen sticking out his claws.  He also had dreams about battles taken place long in the past.
The CGI was overdone too.  Lots of the stuff looked fake because of it, and would never happen in real life, and was very obvious.  But, some scenes made up for this, like the mostly non-cgi halloween ball where there were some impressive circus type acts going on.  But even scenes like this had inconsistencys.  Vampires don't have reflections, and the movie makes a point to show that dracula doesn't have a reflection, but you see the reflection of everyone else on the ball.  Then you find out that it is a Vampire ball, and everyone there is a vampire, so no one should have shown up in the mirror.
Stuff like this brought the movie down.  All the senseless fighting also brought the movie down.  If you have not much to do, maybe rent the movie, but don't see it in theatres.",1084060800,,3101,4.388791593695271
2102693,4,B0002KVUKW,"Van Helsing is like the Indiana Jones of Transylvania.  It is full of action, adventure, shocks, and special effects.

It is like the old classics of the 1930s and 40s, but what Van Helsing has that the others don't is a 21st Century revamp.  It is what we go to the movies for.  I enjoyed every minute of it.

2102694,3,B0002KVUKW,"""Van Helsing"" (which opened in theaters last night) is the type of movie that kicks off the summer movie season in grand fashion, promising and delivering everything including the kitchen sink and just about every other kitchen sink in the United States. Is it loud? Yes. Is it overdone? Yes. Is it overblown? Yes. Does it work? Yes. Director Stephen Sommers, who helmed the remake of ""The Mummy"" with Brendan Fraser, has finally found his niche. Those looking for an intelligent monster movie would be wise to look elsewhere. Other critcs may compare this to the ancient black-and-white Universal monster masterpieces and scoff but they should remember that while the Universal Monster Movies are fine pictures and have made immortal the beloved characters of Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, and the Wolfman (to name a few), they were also the ""Van Helsing"" of their time. I say this because while they were good movies, they were also horribly abridged versions of their source material. An example of this: I remember seeing the Claude Raines version of ""The Phantom of the Opera"" on video for the first time after having read Gaston Leroux's novel. It was pretty, it was flashy...and it was hammy. My then-girlfriend (who also read the novel) pointed out that the only thing it had in common was the chandelier being cut from the ceiling and I agree to this day. Bela Lugosi may be forever known as Dracula, but Gary Oldman's portrayal was true to Bram Stoker's book.
But, I digress. If the old monster-flicks were skeletons of their source-material, then this is a tribute to those skeletons...no pun intended, of course.
Like I said, this movie lights every firework for the sake of entertainment and puts us in the same world that Fred Dekker's ""The Monster Squad"" put us in, where Frankenstein's Monster, Dr. Frankenstein, Dracula, Dr. Jeckyl/Mr. Hyde, and the Wolfman all exist in the same world and are linked together through in some warped ""Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon"" way (Dr. Frankenstein is hired by Dracula to create horrible monsters like The Wolfman and super-soldiers like Frankenstein's Monster to better serve the Dracula's evil deeds). Hugh Jackman (""X-Men"", ""X2"") plays Van Helsing, a Vatican-assigned monster-hunter who roams the streets of such conveniently-gothic locales as Paris, Rome, and of course, Transylvania. Of course, he is put there to protect us from these ""nightmarish creatures"" and of course, He Doesn't Exist And Because Of That, Nobody Understands Him and Everybody Hates Him. Director Stephen Sommers crosses into Marvel Comic territory there and it plays like one, too; don't you worry.
The story begins with Helsing taking on Mr. Hyde (Robbie Coltrane of ""Goldeneye"") in Paris and is soon assigned to kill the nefarious Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh of ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""M:I2"") in his hometown of Transylvania. Oh, by the way, this is ""Universal Studios Hollywood""-Transylvania where the natives storm castles, are ready to burn at the stake anyone who comes into their village, and say things like, ""we don't take kindly to strangers"". The whole town is pretty much led by Anna (Kate Beckinsale of ""Underworld""), the only person in the village who is, a) attractive and b) must hold some knowledge of a secret time portal that allows her to jump to the future for her hygiene and beauty needs. She's the only one who doesn't dress in unsightly rags or looks like she's been on a desert-island for 10 years. Anna is the last of her ancestry and, because of this, is the constant target of Dracula and his minions. We learn that if Anna is killed, all hope for good will be lost...we won't ask where Van Helsing stands in all this, so let's move on. We learn that crosses burn Dracula but then melt in his hands like giant M&M's and silver has no effect on his body (it was always wooden stakes when I was a kid). So what kills Dracula? Therein lies the mystery and the source for stylistically elaborate action sequences and outstanding chase scenes. CGI Wolfmen soar through the air and Dracula's brides chomp at the screen with such fury that you almost wish that this was a 3D special feature picture show. The thrills and chills come fast and heavy, things (and minions) explode, and arrows and bullets are fired as the camera whips around catching all the action as if it was placed in a plastic ball at an Aerosmith concert.
Van Helsing would make a great comic book if nothing else because it plays like one. Like a comic book, the backstory is laid on thick and is unbelievably goofy (Van Helsing is ""linked"" to Dracula somehow and the secret to Dracula's mortality is wholly unrealistic), like a comic book, the heroes kick butt and take names with shiny Batman-gadgets, and like a comic book, the dialogue sucks on toast:
Van Helsing: How come you can't just tell people about us?
Priest: Because we don't exist.
Van Helsing: Well, then...neither do I!!!
But...this is a summer film. A Universal Monster summer film. It's a movie where the visual effects are what we're paying our money to see and it's a movie where we will hide our eyes at the sight of the Wolfman, Dracula, and the impressive Monster of Frankenstein...and it's movies like this one that make us smile.
--Matt
Note: I was particularly touched by Stephen Sommers dedication in the end credits under his name. Simply stated, it reads, ""In memory of my Dad"". I think all of us monster-lovers can relate...the opening-sequence of this film could only be done by a true fan of movie monsters who was brought up right by his father.",1084060800,3,5556,4.849473684210526
2102695,4,B0002KVUKW,"I watched this movie yesterday and I really enjoyed it.  It's all about a crusader trying to rid the world of evil doers and coming face-to-face with his greatest advesary Dracula.  He's helped with the aid of his side-kick and the georgeous Anna (played by Kate Beckinsale) who also wants to see the distruction of Dracula.
Now the movie is all about having fun, with non-stop action and mayhem. I know alot of people complained about how silly it is but I think it's ment to be this way. I mean the idea of these monsters are silly anyway so why not make the movie not so serious and just poke fun here and there.
The only negative thing I could say is that the music was a bit to loud and the movie played a bit to long but apart from those things a really good movie.",1084060800,,771,4.202702702702703
2102696,4,B0002KVUKW,"Much too often i don't understand people and even more so the so called ""professional critics"". I went to see ""Van Helsing"" having read barrages of reviews describing it as anywhere between the disaster of all disasters or the joke to end all jokes. Knowing better than to trust critics i decided to risk 2 hours of my saturday night and i didn't regret it.
  Van Helsing is two hours of absolutely spectacular tongue in cheek entertainment. That's what it is, and anybody who's judging it on any other level than that is totally missing the point and will inevitably deprive himself of having fun with this cool flick.
  In a nutshell, Van Helsing is the guy to call when you've got trouble with some legendary monster. He arrives complete with his special tools and weapons and takes care of the gory business till the next job. From the opening sequence of the film when Helsing takes on a version of dr. Jekyll that looks more like an offshoot of the Hulk, you know you're in for some serious parody fun with loads of aces in the formula:
  the effects are truly stunning, but what makes the package even more attractive is the settings, the locations. Van Helsing's adventures take place in 17-18th century Europe, and the monsters are roaming all familiar cultural capitals like Paris or Vienna. The touch of the Eiffel tower being still under construction made me smile.
  But then the real plot kicks in and the opening sequence (which was by all means a treat) seems like peanuts.
  The exterminator is sent off to legendary Transylvania, where an all-star monster team is terrorising the locals, headed by Dracula and his flying-vampire brides (they totally steal the show of the first hour of the film) along with his army of genetic horrors, a stolen Frankestein with a partially blinking skull, Quasimodo who takes his orders directly from the King Vampire Himself, and of course, werewolves the kind of which i doubt you've seen in such form.
  Sounds like all this could be a mess to even attempt to tie into a ""story""? Well, as far as I'm concerned, the scriptwriters did a great job of tieing all this together without insulting the audience, except for that part of the audience who insist stubbornly of treating this seriously. Those you can't satisfy anyway.
  Once these formalities are taken care of, and once you've understood on what level the premise of this film will work, the rest is a grand success really. The settings are even more impressive now, as the sky-piercing tower of Dracula appears together with the ultra-gothic village at the feet of his mountain which serves as a food source for him and his brides.

  The effects jump to jaw-dropping levels by now, and this becomes a super-fun ride. Surprisingly, the nice touches here and there never cease appearing, as  the Dracula character is totally slick and very good with punchlines, while his brides have all the appropriate lines to qualify as high-flying, blood-sucking vixens of the highest order.
  I thought that by that time the wheels of the film should be about to fall off. It never happened though. ""Van Helsing"" keeps a frenetic pace through-out right to the very end, its parody feel is always there in perfect balance, and the overall result is actually very successful when you consider how badly this could've failed.
  To be sure, this film belongs in that category where you need to partly shut your brain off in order to enjoy it, but I'll tell you what: I've seen too many films lately where you're supposed to watch with your brain full-on and where the result was an utter joke. At least Van Helsing is totally honest with the viewer which is exactly why you can't possibly feel cheated afterwards, unless of course you want to. That's what some people would call bias (me included).
  The paradox of it all? That would be the fact that to make a film like Van Helsing work you need an intelligent film crew, especially that part of the crew involving the directing and the script-writting.

2102697,4,B0002KVUKW,"As entering watching this film, I didn't really expect much of it. But before I saw this film, I manage to look through the comic book, and it is a great adaptation to the book. This film has a lot of CGI, which they didn't really need that much. It didn't really need that much CGI. As from the director of the ""Mummy"", in the ""Mummy"" I'm pretty sure you would know that director Stephen Sommers loves using CGI. But I must comment on the cinematography, it is fantastic. If it won an oscar I wouldn't be mad. The cameos are really great, which you would agree on.
The story really just puts out as a killer of monsters Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman)who is now hunting for the castle of Dracula. This film has a mixture of Frankenstein and the Wolf Man. The main character out of the 3 is Dracula. The Wolf Man isn't in this film that much, but Frankenstein has a long part too. The reason I gave this four stars was the acting. Hugh Jackman was great to be as Van Helsing, but he could have done a way better job. I didn't really like the guy who played Dracula, I guess he tried to hard to tie up with Bela Lugosi and Gary Oldman. Then the line is long for this film, to wait an hour for this film, I don't think so. It's not worth it.
Overall this is a great film, but needed some major changes. But I love the lighting. The way they make the day look all dark, and just the way this film looks I love. That definitely deserves an award for production design. You will love the look of this film too I bet. If you loved Hell Boy, this is the film for you. But if you don't want to wait forever in line, might as well wait for this to come out on dvd.",1083974400,,1650,4.048929663608563
2102698,1,B0002KVUKW,"OKay...I don't even know how to start this review. This may EASILY have been the worst piece of crap i've ever seen. About 30 minutes in, I said to the person that I was with that I wanted to leave, and they said ""maybe it's going to get better"".....infact, it ACTUALLY got worse. Which I didn't think was possible. I looked around the theater, and everyone was fidgeting in their seats, and moving impatiently. Not to mention the 6 conversations that were taking place around me.
Kate's accent came and went as frequently, as my yawning. It's almost like she forgot that she was supposed to have one.
The dialouge was pathetic, and Jackman's talents were WASTED on this movie. I honestly don't know how it even got released. When we finally decided to get up and leave *about an hour in*, I walked down the stairs first, and everyone in the audience started to giggle, and clap for us leaving. I said, ""this movie SUCKS"" and people started cheering me on.
I am personally shocked that me and my friend were the first people to leave....and to be more perfectly honest, I cant believe it took us an hour.

2102699,3,B0002KVUKW,"Van Helsing delivers on everything that we all expected to get: action, special effects, and fight scenes  The acting can border on cheesy, but the movie is VERY entertaining.  I was somewhat disappointed in the Frankenstein character, but all the other monsters were awesome.  There is some comedy in this movie to go along with the action (think ""The Mummy"").  The characters are well casted and the plot is pretty decent.  Don't go see this if you're looking for depth though, you won't find any.  I'd go on, but I don't want to give away too many details.  But if you're into action, then go get your tickets, you won't be disappointed.",1083974400,2,640,4.660714285714286

Suprising ending, and many twists along the way.  They took the orrigional frankinstine and turned him into a living zombie like mechine.  The warewolves are huge with awsome transformations, ripping their skin off, bones crunching, organs growing, thats how it happens.  And the vampires, since little bats aint scary enough, now they mutate into giant bat demon... things.

example: ""Noooooooooooooo!"" (seriously)
  I say it was a fun movie minus the campy drama.

2102703,3,B0002KVUKW,"Van Helsing is a film that sort of kind of pays homage to some of the classic movie monsters by bringing them back to life in this new version that brings them all together.  At the helm of this gaggle of monsters is Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh).  A person on MTV compared this Dracula to a rock star.  I can believe it.  This Dracula's persona is very unique and up to date.  It is something worth seeing.  The rest of the monsters include a (...) outfit of Dracula's Brides, Dr. Frankenstein and Igor, Frankenstein's Monster, Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde, and a werewolf (compared to the Wolfman).
Out to stop most of these...enter our hero...is Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman).  He is later joined by our vixen hero Anna (Kate Beckinsale, whose family holds itself responsible for killing Dracula.  Action pursues and many different skirmishes between Van Helsing and different monsters collide on screen.  Not to ruin the movie, there is a bunch of killing, a little bit of twist, romance,a little bit of dancing, and a small plot...kill Dracula.
Two scenes really stand out in the film.  First, there is a scene where Dracula hosts a ballroom dance.  The colors and the lighting really make a beautiful picture on the screen.  The second is the scene of the stagecoach chase.  One critic has described the film as part Raiders of the Lost Ark.  I hardly believe it lives up to that expectation, but this seen is probably what they are talking about.
In the end, the answer is discovered and a battle between Van Helsing and Dracula begins, in what really is kind of amazing to watch.  Since the mention of a couple of sequels was rumored before the movie was ever released, it is probably no surprise to figure out who wins.
A lot of critics have talked about how much action and CGI was used, and it made me think that it would be a typical summer blockbuster.  Yet, there really wasn't as much as expected, but that's good.  A film like this does not need all action and CGI.  There were also a few one-liners that some characters would drop that kept the film from being serious.  The guy that was sitting beside me almost fell out of his seat a couple of times, but he acted like he hadn't been to a movie in 5 years.
Yet, Van Helsing is not a great movie.  It is not scary, creepy, tense, frightening, or white-knuckled-edge of your seat kind of movie.  Something that the classic horror films were.  In fact, in personal opinion, I wish the whole film had been black and white.  The opening scene was black and white, and it made me want to watch the rest of the movie in that form.  It spoiled me. That could just be me though.  All in all, as mentioned, it's not a great movie, but it is fun to watch.",1083974400,,2704,4.469387755102041
2102704,2,B0002KVUKW,"I was looking foreward to seeing this film after all the media hype and speculation. I should have learned my lesson after The Matrix: Revolutions. Dazzling special effects and classic movie monsters was not enough to make a good movie. All of the characters were one-dimensional, if that. Van Helsing is an immortal amnesiac, a complete ripoff of Wolverine, without the pizazz(during the movie he becomes a wolf, a relative to the wolverine), his assistant is a friar, not a monk, and the girl, whose name I can't remember, wants to protect everybody. All of the classic characters (with the excepion of Mr. Hyde) were terribly acted and written( the actor for Igor got his part because of the way he could say ""yes master"") did not stay true to their original incarnations. The cinematography was unimpressive. Every scene was shot in a different  style, but each style was repeated dozens of times in its scene. It was far too predictable to be taken seriously(""I don't know what this sunlight machine can be used for in Transylvania?"").
  There was one scene I thoroughly enjoyed, a mascarade scene. It was extremely impressive until they ruined it by adding cheezy action. Other than that, there was nothing I liked
This movie was not worth my time, effort, or money: 2 stars.",1083974400,,1281,4.840182648401827
2102705,3,B0002KVUKW,"Stephen Sommers must really love Raiders of the Lost Ark - he keeps remaking it; first as The Mummy, then as The Mummy Returns, and now as Van Helsing.  Perhaps the reason I liked this movie is that my expectations were so low - I'd been hearing negative feedback for weeks.  But what sold me is this movie is a love letter to Classic Age of Universal Monster Movies.  The plot of this film is no more silly than that of Frankenstein vs. the Wolf Man, say.
Frankly, I think Sommers has ONLY seen those movies - everything in this film is reminiscent of them: Frankenstein in the windmill, Dracula's Bela Lugosi accent.  The main character is named Gabriel Van Helsing - either to distinguish him from Bram Stoker's Abraham Van Helsing, or Sommers just didn't know what his first name really was.  In actuality, this is an ""alternate universe"" story - the Frankenstein and Dracula have nothing to do with Mary Shelley or Bram Stoker...or history, for that matter.
This is essentially a James Bond film.  Van Helsing works for the Catholic Secret Service, going around the world, killing monsters.  The funny thing is, Hugh Jackman is basically playing Wolverine from X-Men all over again: he is an immortal super-hero who can't remember his past.  Sound familiar?  Watch the movie, the comparisons grow.
I enjoyed this movie for the art direction and the atmosphere.  Let's face it, no matter how many times filmmakers want to take us inside Castle Dracula, I'll be there to go with them.  The story is pure shlock, but that doesn't matter.  The whole film seems to be a promo for the Van Helsing Ride coming to a Universal Theme Park near you!  However, I mind mindless action movies less lately.  Screenplay writing is a dead art and if I'm going to sit through a banal script, I better be watching something visually interesting.",1083974400,3,1831,4.699059561128527

I'd award the fifth to it if it were not because it did go over the limit of the fantastically tolerable in several occasions. It is a fantastic film, very original and it will keep your attention on the screen for the entire ~2:20 hours. Be warned though, it is a movie of fantastic beings and actions, but a very well developed one, with excellent special effects, beautiful sceneries and very good acting. Jackman as Van Helsing delivers a powerful performance, and though his character does not demand great dialogues, his presence is enough to give life to this evil-hunter.

What disappointed me was, instead, giant plot holes and action-scene overload.  Not to mention it seemed to be a full moon every three to four days!
The movie doesn't let the character of Van Helsing develop to his full potential.  He is very mysterious and you do find out more about his history as the movie progresses, but I feel more time should have been devoted, instead, to his background as a slayer rather than the mission at hand.  There is very little opportunity for any dialogue between the characters and you find out the most about Van Helsing as he confronts the Count, not through any flashback scenes which would have been interesting.
It had a great idea but they really dropped the ball through bad directing and too much computer graphics.  I really wish they had done this better.",1083974400,3,949,4.585798816568047
2102709,3,B0002KVUKW,"Gabriel (no relation to the character Abraham from Stoker's Dracula) Van Helsing is a Holy Warrior type that goes about killing monsters to save the souls of the humans buried within them.  As is the case with San Francisco's Dirty Harry Callahan, Van Helsing's successes are usually more costly in damage and bad PR (that is if anybody actually knew about the secret society that employs Van Helsing) than other men's failures.  After facing off with Mr. Hyde, Van Helsing is sent to the farthest reaches of Romania to do battle with Dracula and his brides.  The movie starts off strong with a spot on homage to the classic Universal horror movies of days long gone, but it stumbles when Van Helsing returns to the Vatican to receive his orders.  All the dialogue that follows is largely exposition and the action is non-stop.  Not once does the movie stop long enough to build any characters to relate to, or care for.  The movie does have some witty touches (Van Helsing getting outfitted with his weapons is a clear play on James Bond getting his gadgets from Q), but it is mostly a parade of outlandish action setpieces that aren't well connected to the plot trying to string them together.  The best thing about this is the effects and Alan Silvestri's score.  James Whale, Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi are spinning in the grave.",1083974400,3,1336,4.703862660944206

Although, the how and why of the story weren't really well developed this was a really fun and entertaining movie.
The dracula character was the most likeable and charming villain I've seen in a film in a long time. And the Frankenstein monster came closest to the Mary Shelly novel than anything in film since the 1940s (Boris Karloff) Frankenstein movie. And yes, there are some spooky, creepy parts.
If you liked Raiders of The Lost Ark or if you've read or seen A Boy and His Dog and loved the ending, then I think you'll like this film.

2102711,4,B0002KVUKW,"I might typically be indignant with such a two dimensional movie, but I'm finally accepting this new genre, the Mega-Budget B-Movie. `Van Helsing' re-confirms that Stephen Sommers(the Mummy Movies) is championing this campy escapist genre.
If you don't mind checking your brain at the door, and if you put on a sensory raincoat, you may find this movie quite the guilty pleasure.
I use the phrase `put on a sensory raincoat' because it felt like that's what I had to do get through this movie. My attention span isn't quite short enough. One is constantly being doused with heaping buckets of digital grandeur, absurd sets, absurd superman stunts, comic book action, and C-G-I-candy. Don't go if you're prone to sensory induced seizures.
The whole movie is pretty silly, not at all scary, and the wacky details and plot turns are churned out like the bolts in Hugh Jackman's improbable automatic cross-bow. I won't bother with details, because they really aren't that important to the film. The omni-present movie-trailer tells you all you need to know.
All this said, I'll admit it was good weekend matinee fun. I didn't like the Mummy films. Maybe I had too many A-movie expectations. I just might revisit them",1083974400,2,1212,4.946078431372549
2102712,4,B0002KVUKW,"I am a horror movie buff, and also a Hugh Jackman fan.  Therefore, I rushed to see this movie at 11:45 a.m. the day it came out--May 7, 2004.
I had read the early reviews, most of them highly critical and negative.
However, my own assessment is that the movie looks stunning--there are some spectacular shots, and they are very enjoyable.  Hugh Jackman's performance is, as always, FLAWLESS.  He is perfect, as usual.  He is a consummate actor, regardless of which genre he is working.  Everything about him communicates his character, even his silences.  Hugh is ALWAYS worth watching.  And did I mention he looks fabulous in this movie?  I love the hair, the physique, the costumes.
The story lags in a couple of places, but the filmmaker has made a deliberate effort to mimic the horror movies of old, and it is done tongue-in-cheek, indicating that the filmmaker is not taking himself so seriously that he cannot humorously refer to the filmmarkers of old.  There is a little something for everyone: Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Frankenstein, werewolves, and of course, Count Dracula.
There are also some new effects, such as the flying vampire brides, and the flying vampire progeny.
I think you have to view this movie bearing in mind the old ""B"" horror movies.  If you do that, you will have more of a context for appreciation.
I liked the movie, though I don't think it will win an Academy Award for screenplay.",1083974400,,1415,4.715447154471545

If you are looking for a perfectly put together, fun, high intensity thrill ride, go see Van Helsing.  Hugh Jackman brings his Wolverine style brooding to a new character, and is just as sexy.  Kate Beckinsale is HOT and pretty much made the movie for me.  The only thing that really came close to Kate was Elena Anaya, Sylvia Colloca, and Josie Maran as Dracula's brides.  They are catty and viscious.  Perfectly played and HOT (when they aren't in their naked winged harpy form).  As far as plot goes, Van Helsing is full of them.  There seem to be about 5 going on at once, and Stepehen Sommers does a decent job of pulling them all together into a somewhat cheesy but significant ending (sequel much).  The dialogue is kinda dense, but the action and monsters make up for it.  There is some great comic relief in the form of Carl, who is Van Helsing's friar assistant, who I think is an ancestor of James Bond's Q.  If you wanna have some fun, give Van Helsing a chance.

""Van Helsing"" is fun, exciting, pure candy for the eyes, and a roller coaster of action that never lets up, not even for a moment.
Hugh Jackman, in desperate need of a haircut, plays Gabriel Van Helsing, a monster-slayer secretly commissioned by the Vatican (who took him in as an infant) to slay evil in the world.  The movie opens in 1886 Transylvania, with Dr. Frankenstein having finally perfected his quest for eternal life by awakening the Frankenstein monster, with the help of his assistant Igor.  Unfortunately, he's done it for none other than Count Dracula, who wants to use the monster for his own nefarious scheme.  When the doctor refuses, we find out Igor is on Dracula's payroll, and Dracula kills Dr. Frankenstein, determined to steal his creation.  But Frankie has other plans; he temporarily knocks Dracula silly and escapes from the lab with the doctor - his daddy's - body in tow.  Meanwhile, the townspeople of Transylvania have had enough crap and are attacking the castle with torches and other weapons.  They catch sight of the monster escaping, and follow him to an old windmill, which they set aflame.  Dracula and his three brides arrive just in time for the castle to collapse ... Drac losing his shot at the monster forever.  This opening sequence is AWESOME, shot lovingly in crisp black and white as an obvious tribute to James Whale and the original ""Frankenstein"" films.
Cut to one year later, where Van Helsing -- after a tough battle - dispatches with Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in Paris.  A visit to the Vatican afterward reveals that Van Helsing's next mission is also going to be his most dangerous -- he has to conquer Dracula AND the Wolfman in Transylvania.  The Valerious family -- who has a connection to Dracula's lineage - has a curse upon them; they were to be the line that slayed Dracula, but in turn have all been killed off by the vampire of all vampires.  That is -- all but two; Anna Valerious and her brother Velkan are the last two left of the old Romanian dynasty .  Van Helsing's job is to help dispatch with Dracula, otherwise the entire family - which has been stuck in purgatory until the last heir is gone - will all end up in hell for eternity.  Should Dracula die before the last heir falls, heaven is their fate.
As you can understand, for the Catholic Church this is kind of a big issue.
Van Helsing, with his sidekick Friar Carl (David Wenham, who is GREAT and provides some nice comic relief in the film)- whom the church has insisted Van Helsing take with him - heads off to Transylvania ... where he finds Anna and Velkin fighting bigger foes than even he could ever have imagined ...
That's the plot - but hoo-boy, wait 'til you see the visuals!  If you want to see this movie at all, and DON'T see it on the big screen, you are totally cheating yourself; visually, this film ROCKS, and never lets up on the action.  I jumped at least 5-6 times in the film, not so much from fright but because stuff is thrown at you without warning, and will make you jump in your seat.  Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale - as the gypsy-like Anna Valerious - are good in their roles, playing it for serious when we all know this is really a $200-million ""B"" movie.
And that's the problem, I think, with those who've UNJUSTLY given this film negative reviews.  ANYONE who has seen the original Universal monster movies that inspired ""Van Helsing"" know that they were never meant to be high art.  They were always ""B"" movies designed to thrill, chill, and simply to be enjoyed on their own merits; the word ""Oscar"" may never be associated with this movie outside the special effects department.
And on that level this movie will knock you on your butt!  The vampire brides of Dracula absolutely steal every scene they're in - you'll feel your pulse quicken whenever they are on the scene - and Richard Roxburgh as Count Vladislaus Dracula is evil as evil gets (though I think the role could have been better cast - he sort of got on my nerves).  The CGI Wolfman - or technically I should say WolfMEN, but you have to see the movie to find out what I mean - are incredible; overall the effects make the film, and you'll find yourself dizzy at times from the pure action that fills nearly every frame of the movie.
Anyone whining that this film didn't deliver has either never seen (or understood) the original monster films from the hey-day of Hollywood.  Not perfect but still a feast, ""Van Helsing"" is a thrilling ride that is meant as nothing more; what I call a ""popcorn"" film -- fluffy, not too substantial, but perfectly filling ... and very tasty going down.",1083974400,,4813,4.546296296296297
2102717,3,B0002KVUKW,"As far as Vamp flicks go, this one is mostly cute and fun. The character development is not deep. The plot has holes so deep, I had to throw away all my preconceived notions about things like, you know...REALITY?! But, hey! This is a movie. There's a reason why film makers don't make Vampire documentaries, eh? That being said, if you let yourself buy into the carefully crafted (I mean that literarally) world, you will definitely have fun with this one. I think this film was shot in Prague. So, the general look of all things vampy get a huge ""thumb's up"" (sorry:) for virtual realism. You know how fun vamp flicks, like ""Interview With A Vampire,""  ""Dusk Til Dawn,"" and ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" have beautiful vamp chics/wives who figure into the story, but not on the screen? Well, this film features the chics in a different way than most commercial vampire flicks have in recent history. There's some sillines to the movie, as far as c.g.i. usage. I mean, at times it's a bit heavy handed. But, realism is a hard thing to create in a story like this. If you have a healthy imagination, you'll understand why when you see the things these loonies try to bring to the screen. But c.g.i. stunts and gross-outs are a fun and necessary part of any healthy campy vamp flick. There are a few things in this movie that were truly unnecessary and felt more than forced: the entire ending!  However, the execution of the credits were a reminder that a zany band of professionals worked hard to create this film. The costume, makeup, set design, and actors were all well chosen. The music, the odd turn of the plot, and some effects, sadly, were not. But, if you're crazy for vamp movies, this one really won't let you down. Just bring your sense of humor and check your intelligence at the door.",1083974400,2,1792,4.562111801242236
2102718,3,B0002KVUKW,"Van Helsing suffers from too much of a good thing.  I just got back from watching it and discussing it in the car ride back.  Both the people who enjoyed and disliked it agreed about these fundamental problems:
* The movie is too dark.  Yes, vampires only come out at night, but it seemed like we were inside the caves of Mordor the entire time.  Speaking of which, the scenes in Lord of the Rings inside black caves were lit brighter than the majority of this entire movie.
* Constant lightning is unexciting.  Lightning, or little flashes of light from somewhere, is basically a constant throughout Van Helsing.  Though dark and stormy nights are the backdrop for good monster movies, lightning loses it effect if it's always present, like lightning during a gentle rain in the middle of summer. Considering the amount of bright flashes, I wouldn't be surprised if people get seizures, or at least headaches, from this movie.
* Some of the audio is extremely grating to hear, and these nasty noises keep repeating.  The laughs of the vampires are very irritating, which, of course, makes sense... but boy, are they ever prevalent.
Maybe I wasn't in the mood for the movie, maybe I was expecting something different.  However, the entire audience didn't seem too involved with the movie, with very few audible gasps or reactions.  The exception to this was Carl, played by David Wenham (Faramir from Lord of the Rings), who has some hilarious lines that are delivered wonderfully throughout the movie.
Sometimes Van Helsing seems to be an exercise in technical wizardry, and it definitely succeeds in bringing intense action to the screen along with some great visuals. The story is mildly entertaining, with a few neat twists.  Overall, unfortunately, I did not find myself clicking with movie very well tonight.
Nothing's too discrete, and everything is very over the top.  Recommended for hard-core monster movie buffs; it probably won't win any new fans to the genre.",1083974400,,1972,4.909638554216867
2102719,2,B0002KVUKW,"I like most action-adventure films.  I was in a good mood and expected a fun evening.  The only problem was I went to see Van Helsing.
The film tried to walk that fine line between camp and sincerity (which in my opinion Pirates of the Caribbean walks so successfully) and failed.  You know how The Mummy Returns had great effects but some looked like they were still in the roughed-out test mode?  Same here - not quite finished.  Not quite believable.
Acting was laughable.  Even performers I thought to be skilled looked stupid in this.  I cared about no one, not even Van Helsing, although I came closest to caring about the Frankenstein monster.  Lots of film villians have managed the outragious, over-the-top, steal the show performance with great success (Capt. Barbossa) but K. D. Lang, er - Dracula just didn't cut it.
Oh, yeah, and Jawas are the minions of Dracula.  Yes, I said Jawas.  You knew they had to moonlight somewhere until the next Star Wars flick - well, here they are.
I saw the film opening night - a Friday night - at a mall theater packed with high school and college students.  This should have been the best reception of the film possible.  Sure there were some laughs (a few even intended by the film makers) and a few good jumps, but nothing that really got even this most-perfect-of-audiences worked up.  There was no, ""alright - let's rock!"" moment like, for example, when the two Jedi take off their robes in preparation to fight Darth Maul.
And considering this was a film that relied completely on its special effects, some were surprisingly poor.  The werewolf, for example, looked like this film had borrowed the software program used in American Werewolf in Paris.  Michael Jackson's video Thriller gave us a more believable beast.
Great premise.  We've got a monster-hunter, a centuries-old secret society, vampires, werewolves and Frankenstein.  What could go wrong?  Well, to start with, maybe you could have an audience that DOESN'T CARE.  Now that's enough to scare anyone in Hollywood!",1083888000,5,2030,4.831884057971014
2102720,3,B0002KVUKW,"STORY: Well, this is an interesting piece of work to dig into. I went into the movie expecting nothing more than an action ride, and even though that's what I got there was a little more to Van Helsing than you would expect. Even though that ""more"" can in fact be too much. The story is about Gabriel Van Helsing, a vanquisher of evil who works in the name of god. He has been assigned to help Anna Valerious, the last member of her family, to kill Count Dracula. Count Dracula must be killed in order to send the rest of Anna's family to heaven and out of purgatory (I know, sounds lame . . . it is). Dracula must use Frankenstein's monster to unleash his children of the night by harvesting his energy (Sounds even lamer . . . it is). All the while, Dracula uses the aid of the wolfman as well as his evil brides to try kill Van Helsing and Anna; thus providing the audience with overdone action sequences. The dialogue of the movie is something to laugh at, as well is the lame character development, and the reality bending action. In one scene Kate Beckinsale is swinging from a cable only holding it with one hand as if she was just holding a rope while standing on a platform. The ending was a clich&eacute;. So why in God's name (no pun intended) would I give this movie two and a half stars. Well, two stars by all means is a very low score, but that half would insist that this movie is okay. It is.  The two stars go for the undeveloped plot, overdone action, and overall nonsense that is the movie. The half star is for the fact that it's fun to watch. I guarantee you will not get bored with this movie. The CGI effects are astounding and are incredible. The movie can not be seen on your TV and have the same effect that it does with a big screen and DTS. This movie is the definition for ""summer blockbuster"". This movie is fun, entertaining, and one hell of a ride. It just makes no sense.
ACTING: Hugh Jackman is perfectly cast as Van Helsing, although his acting is almost a replica of his acting as Wolverine in the X-Men films. Kate Beckinsale is the hot babe, the local gal from Transylvania with the sexy overly done accent.  Comic relief is provided by David Wenham (Best known as Faramir from The Return Of The King) and Kevin J. O'Connor as Igor (Best known as Beni Gabor from The Mummy). Who really steals the show is Richard Roxburgh as Count Dracula. A very genuine fantasy performance that is not overly done, yet not so subtle that it goes unnoticed.
BOTTOM LINE: Fun movie plagued by a weak (very weak) plot and weak characters. Sometimes movies like this are good because you can park your brain at the door and set it in neutral, and let the movie do its job, entertain. Stephen Sommers is a huge fan of classic horror films and is why he remade The Mummy. I guess he wanted to do remakes for all the classics and to save time he just threw them in a blender to make this romp. It's obvious why the movie cost $150 million to make just by seeing the special effects, but at times they seem overdone. 90% of the camera shots in the movie have one CGI. A fun way to kick off summer and even though highly flawed, it shouldn't detract from the overall experience of this summer flick.",1083888000,2,3214,4.29324546952224
2102721,2,B0002KVUKW,"I was really looking forward to opening day. What a let down. The performances were flat and uninspired. Absolutely no chemistry between Jackman and Beckinsale. The film was derivitive, corny, and boring.",1083888000,,204,5.40625
2102722,3,B0002KVUKW,"This is certainly a case of a clever and misleading trailer.  The exciting trailer makes ""Van Helsing"" out to be some kind of fantastic movie, when in fact it is just so-so.  The special FX are OK, Hugh Jackman is acceptable as the hero, and Kate Beckinsdale is surely one of the 2 or 3 most beautiful actresses working today, but the story is just NOT all that interesting, and there are various other problems.
 The characters spend WAY too much time swinging through the air on ropes, chains, cables, etc.  It's probably more frequent than in the average Tarzan flick!  The ""rules"" of horror creature mythology are played with in rather arbitrary and even stupid ways.  For example, the vampires can move about in daylight, as long as it's not direct sunlight (ala Buffy & Angel).  The one major departure from the standard ""rules"" - the idea of the vampire offspring - is a silly notion and is handled in a completely idiotic way.  The greatest offense of all, though, is that the villain, Dracula, is probably the LEAST interesting and un-scary Count Dracula EVER.  I mean, Count CHOC-ula is scarier than this guy.",1083888000,2,1119,4.697435897435898
2102723,2,B0002KVUKW,This movie without a doubt could have been the best movie out of the year. Let talk about the story it like the same Hollywood movie I seen last week that drag the woman all thought movie but that killer on the end! Seen it hundred times if u going to keep her as a side kick please give some skill. My god who write this stuff! She fighting monsters. The reason I give it a 2 because without a doubt good special effect!!! My thing how can u turn this movie into a love story?

Wasted performances, well mabe not, the over articulation of the transulvanian accent got to be a little much, Hollywood kiss moment, come on, This thing starts very Universal Old time Horror stuff, Yeah to that, Draculas Wifes are worth the watch, The wolfman, well I felt outta place but they used 'um for the story line, Whats with Draculas helpers. ??!! whaaa.... Do you think Hugh is chasing down Wolverine here again I mean he gets hooked up as a wolfman (:) OK not to mention the Frakenstien monster. New look like it or not when he gets zapped in the tower I thought I was watchin the old newer improved version. It was cool. The movie has a Burton quality but leaves me dry on the performances say a 2 but 4 on the effects gives 4 to see it. Querky hollywood I wanted so bad to give it a 5 but I'ts not as bad as Extrodinary Gentlemen. Egor is the only laughing moment. Universal owns these characters and I don't need to remind anybody whos seen enough of the old black and whites how many munipulated story lines over the years. One point felt like an old Christopher Lee B-Movie which I thought was cool",1083888000,15,1164,4.393518518518518
2102725,4,B0002KVUKW,"Have you ever watched ""The mummy""? If so, and if you liked it, there's a good chance you'll probably going to enjoy ""Van Helsing"". Director Stephen Sommers once again used his proven formula to make a blockbuster movie: a likeable male character, a resourceful heroine, funny moments provided by the supporting characters, lots of visual effects, impressive monsters, winged ghouls, the works.
Sommers was very intelligent: he knew that a movie like this was going to be burdened by all the endless clichs used in previous monster movies, made since the beginning of cinema history. Count Dracula, the Frankesntein monster and werewolves (among others) were portrayed in countless movies; some of them were serious, some of them were spoofs, some of them were good, most of them were terrible.
So, what did he do? He pays homage to all those movies. The very first scene is a nod of the head to early horror movies (Lon Chaney comes instantly to mind). This scene is filmed in black-and-white, and features all those constant elements of ancient movie-times: close-ups of the faces of the angry villagers, the huge monster carrying a human being in his arms, a terrible fire in the wind-mill, and more. Sommers also set a sarcastic tone to ""Van Helsing"" by featuring scenes with more than a close resemblance to other action movies, most notoriouly ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"", ""Mission: Impossible"" (this is very funny), ""Sleepy Hollow"", ""The name of the rose"", and, obviously, Coppola's ""Dracula"" and Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein"".
That is to say: Sommers wrote his screenplay in an intelligent way. He shows the viewer his intention since the first shots. The movie is greatly helped by the beautiful wintry landscape. The visual effects are carefully done, and the animated monsters interact with live characters in a believable way. I only wanted to remind the viewers that this is a work of fiction; in fact, Van Helsing is a fictional character, and vampire, frankenstein and werewolves legends are fictional too. I won't understand someone complaining that he didn't know what this movie was about, that he went to the theater expecting a movie like ""The pianist"" for example. ""Van Helsing"" is what it is, and it's good at that.
Hugh Jackman is a good actor, and shows it once again. But I think that he could have played his Van Helsing a little bit more loosely; the problem is that he would have looked too much like Brendan Fraser's Rick O'Connell in ""The mummy"". Kate Beckinsale is very beautiful in her dark looks, but she's still unconvincing as a romanian Lara Croft-like maiden. The touch of genious is Count Dracula: Richard Roxburgh (from ""Moulin Rouge"") is almost unrecognizable in his Bono-looks, an extravagant, sometimes pathetic creature. I almost forgot to say, the ""romanian"" accent was tiresome.
If I had to compare ""Van Helsing"" to ""The mummy"", I would have to say that ""The mummy"" is better: the settings, the characters and the story. But ""Van Helsing"" is not that far behind. It's one of those movies that start slow, but then picks-up the pace and completely grabs the viewer.
Anyway, a very good entertainment. For those who know how to appreciate it.

2102726,4,B0002KVUKW,"The early reviews for this are all over the map, with lots of pans. I frankly don't get it. Let's face it, folks, the progenitors of this film were B movies long before they became ""classics"" of the horror genre. As such, they endured decades of critical scorn before  being appreciated. Will this achieve the same fate? Probably not, but it's not the turkey everyone is saying!

Disclaimer: I'm a boomer. I grew up with high-concept silly movies and learned how to adopt a mindset to appreciate them. Shoot, I was even able to find fun with ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" (LXG) which was by any measure a much worse movie than this.

The tactic here is relentless action which sweeps you along without giving you too much time to think of what's illogical (other than the mere existence of vampires, werewolves, et al). Is some of the action silly? Sure. But is it entertaining? It can be if you let it. Aside from the obvious derivations, there are, as others have noted, quotes and homages from a variety of other films. Those are fun. There is comic relief, mostly from David Wenham but also from Hugh Jackman himself. Is the heroine totally implausible? Duh, of course! But that's part of her job. Classic horror films have two types of women - crones and bimbos. Since there's no one comparable to Maria Ouspenskaya these days, we have to just settle for the babe.

I rated this 4 out of 5 stars. It's good mindless entertainment that pays due respect to its origins. Where it falls down is both at the very beginning and near the end. In the beginning, there's a sequence with Van Helsing and Mr Hyde/Dr. Jekyll where Mr. Hyde is every bit as overdone as in LXG. At the end, the temptation once again becomes too great and the climactic battle is between CGI creatures. Well done, but a bit disappointing. The very end of the movie is its Achilles heel - it's a real downer and probably hurts the word of mouth for the show.

Should you see it? If you liked ""The Mummy"", you may well like this. Just don't be too swayed by the critics. Many of them were wrong about the original Universal horror films, as they have been later over other FX-laden films. Especially if you're of boomer age like me, you may find yourself having a pretty good time with it.",1083888000,6,2270,4.51338199513382
2102727,1,B0002KVUKW,It really is basically a Bond movie. Think about it. What a waste. Is Hollywood just going to [cull] all classic literature to create camp? Kids don't waste your time on this. Instead you might want to pick up Bram Stoker's 'Dracula' or Mary Shelley's 'Frankenstein' in a very old format called a book.,1083801600,6,302,4.611111111111111
2102728,3,B0002KVUKW,"What can I say about Van Helsing? This movie in not completely forgettable because I still remembered it up to the point where I got into my car to leave the cinema. I would like to criticize the plot but that would pointless.

It appears to me that Van Helsing's major selling point is the special effects and I would consider it a demo movie for special effects.  The winged female Vampires were very appealing. They were horrifying, sexy, theoretically nude but not actually so. Dr. Jekyll was a bit over done and too Shreklike. Frankenstein was a likeable chap and might even be the best character in the movie but second only to the beautiful Kate Beckinsale. I liked her gypsy type costume, her Transylvanian accent and ""I won't stay down"" attitude.

Van Helsing can be classified as Action/Adventure/Mild Horror/Sci-Fi/Comedy/with a touch of drama added in the last five minutes for completeness. I know there are fans of the modern special effects movies but special effects alone can never make a movie memorable.",1083801600,5,1022,4.862068965517241
2102729,4,B0002KVUKW,"I think people are expecting too much if they demand realism. Like all stephen sommer productions this movie is about remaking the legends of the Hollywood monsters. Roxburgh is quite the man as Dracula, and I had a good laugh when V. Helsing uses all the tried and tested anti-vampire methods to kill him. My favourite villain is the wolfman, he's so agile and aggressive, so unlike the 60s monsters. There's a twist at the end which I won't spoil for you guys, my only gripe is that Frankenstein should have had more screentime. And they didn't really explain clearly how Dracula and V. Helsing are connected. In a nutshell it's popcorn entertainment, just sit back and enjoy the ride!",1083715200,16,687,4.733333333333333
2102730,1,B0002KVUKW,"I interviewed a lucky, or rather unlucky, viewer who happened to be chosen for the sneak preview of ""Van Helsing"". This special effects porn (see note below) might appeal to naive kids who have never heard of Mary Shelly, or Bram Stoker; but, it just goes to proove the point that ""a sucker is born every minute."" Let me explain.
This travesty attempts to merge the various monster myths from antiquety; but, does so poorly a job at it that the ludicrous ""Clash of the Titans"" held truer to the base myths. Within the monster myths, ""Abbot & Costello versus [insert monster here]"" movies were closer to the mark.
Here are some paraphrases of the comments I heard:
A silver stake through the heart of one of the brides of dracula, and she puffs up in green goo and explodes when the others when pierced with the same stake crumbled to dust? Excuse me, a silver stake does not kill a vampire! The myth says that ""only something which once lived"" could be used as material for a stake. Also, where is the cutting off the head and burning it; which is also required to prevent the vampire from rising again?
Okay, no myth has ever had Van Helsing kill Dr. Jeckyl/Mr. hyde, or any werewolves, for that matter. The myth tells us that Van Helsing is a bookwork/geek type doctor that studdied the vampire myth for decades and gave advise. He is not a 30-something appearing importal ""left hand of God"" who has lived hundreds of years. How does someone think this excrement up and expect to shove it down our thoats.
As for the werewolf myths, the transformation scene in ""American Werewolf in London"" is far more believable, though my source applauds the flexibility of the actor. Unconvincing special effects include Van Helsing-turned-werewolf grabbing two people by their necks and jumping 2 stories up! Then jumping down and landing with the peoples feet and his hitting the ground at once. Come on! A human neck would either fracture their larrnyx, crack instantly, or be ripped off with that kind of lifting force. Even if they could have correctly filmed the scene whith him grabbing them around the chest and under the arms, the jump down would have likely broken their legs. Sure the werewolf might have survived unscathed, but the humans would be toast.
The only good things I have to say is that the actors do an excellent job of acting. It is too bad they were saddled with such a contrived script. And the artistry in the ending credits is quite good, if you can manage to make it that far. Frakenstein's exclamation ""I want to live!"" might better be stated ""I want to leave!"".
Note: Special Effects Porn is a term that applies to a movie that appears to be wholly created for special effect extraveganzas with a contrived or thin plot (if you can even call it that) linking the special effects scenes in a similar fashion to the so called plots between sex scenes in porn movies.",1083715200,11,2885,4.614785992217898

I have seen VAN HELSING in an audience preview, and I will tell you that the trailer doesn't come close to describing the film.  As the Universal folks said, the special effects weren't finished in time for the trailer... but the final product is absolutely stunning.
No, critics will probably not like this fun romp through Van Helsing's monster adventures.  It might not win an Academy Award for its script.  But if you liked The Mummy or other epic adventures of its type, you ARE going to be the right audience for VAN HELSING.
This movie is just plain fun.  The story pays homage to the classic monster legacy films in Universal's vault, as well as many modern day adventures.  Van Helsing is a James Bond character of dark Transylvania.  And his battles against Dracula are a roller coaster ride with non-stop action and vivid, beautiful scenery.
If you're an art film snob or the type who overanalyzes everything, forget about VAN HELSING.  You've missed the entire point -- badly -- and you'll spoil all the fun.

I finally seen the movie and it was disappointing in some areas. Dracua did not put up a good fight at the end and he acted like a sissy yet supposed to look bad?
