8588016,5,B000NE6480,"This is the second copy of this video I have purchased for friends of mine who had their Navy Boot Camp training at Farragut.  I first saw this on a PBS station in Spokane, Washington, enjoyed it and thought it was well done.  I suggest giving a copy to any veteran who trained at Farragut so they may show it to their children and grandchildren.  I find many vets, myself included, do not talk about their fast days of military training.  Good viewing!",1245715200,,453,4.421686746987952
