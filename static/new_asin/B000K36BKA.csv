Exhibit A: I offer you Carl Nielsen's Maskerade, which Matthew Boyden (in his Guide) says it is a major achievement and in some ways scarcely inferior to Der Rosenkavalier. In lieu of a proper review, here are some of the notes I took while watching this bizarre (Vienna? Hamburg?) version.

Oh I get it now ... the guy in the miniskirt/tutu, with the polkadot male diaper -- who keeps appearing on a trapeze, and who tosses rose pedals -- is meant to be Cupid. Ack, yikes. Everything was going rather swimmingly (especially the fine music) and then the chubby guy in the scarlet bowler had to go and unbutton his long, black Gestapo leather trenchcoat ... and flash all the girls on stage. Sorry, where was I?

Irony kills emotion, and it specifically kills the emotions meant to be conveyed by the music and by the characters' words to each other. The main characters sing -- rather beautifully -- about love, and yet everything on stage, especially the lighting and their costumes, undermines what they proclaim. (It's like watching two postmodernists flirt.) In other words, it is all too obvious that they don't mean what they are say, and that eliminates audience interest (especially as regards love, one of those few areas where one ought mean what one says or say what one means).

Oh oh, the guy dressed like the Green Hornet is going to get pummelled by the guy dressed as Fred Flintstone. But I digress.

If it weren't for the compelling spectacle of i) seeing how far the director will go or ii) seeing a host of beautiful women, I would turn the screen off and just listen to the music. But this is like a car crash; I can't stop gawking.

Ah, here's an Elvis impersonator. And a male stripper. (Hmmm. I guess HE ran out of water and had to bathe in oil....) Marilyn Monroe? Napoleon? A beauty pageant winner? Alright already, we get it: people have always worn masks. Or rather, everything we don is inevitably some kind of mask.

Is this platitude all there is to Holberg's libretto or Nielsen's opera? Yes, if this interpretation of the opera is anything to go on. Too bad, because Nielsen's music is excellent, and Holberg is a very distinguished playwright. I can't wait for another DVD version.",1166054400,13,2390,4.692124105011933
