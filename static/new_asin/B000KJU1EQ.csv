2692993,3,B000KJU1EQ,"The impression I received from the title was that this film was going to be about the architecture of Jerusalem's holy sites or largely undiscussed history therein.  This instead became largely based upon Jerusalem from three points of view, once from each major religion in Jerusalem.  The idea is that the viewer should get a better understanding the sites themselves by having the sites presented by those who revere them the most.

This works best for the case of the Catholic priest who is located at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.  He is an engrossing character presenting an extraordinary historical and religious site.  The Muslim family starts to bring a political twist, since they have been separated by the violence in the area.  Certainly political differences and violence characterize the area, and these struggles center around the holy buildings.  But, the Muslim family's and a Muslim restoration official's complaints are largely left without a Jewish rebuttal in the film which creates a lopsided axis to the film.  The section on the Dome of the Rock, which the family visits, is very interesting, and the shots of the inside are presented well.  The Jewish police officer seems like a interesting character for this exploration, but his whole purpose in the film was a drawn out visit to the Wailing Wall with little, as before-mentioned, emotional story.

I like the footage of the architecture.  The political and religious overtones mixed into the film are necessary considering the nature of the city, but the Jewish footage was not as strong as the other sections.",1303084800,11,1594,5.0458015267175576
2692994,4,B000KJU1EQ,This is a detailed examination from the perspective of three cultures and each of their respective religions.  Individuals and three families in particular discuss the holiness of Jerusalem to each their religions as well as the city's critical importance to each culture's life and values.  The video provides evidence of why Jerusalem is so beloved by so many.,1299715200,4,362,5.224137931034483
2692995,4,B000KJU1EQ,"This documentary looks at Jerusalem's holy sites from a surprisingly personal perspective, which can be a good or bad thing, depending on what you prefer. Largely, it takes the form of exploring Jerusalem through the eyes of a Muslim family, a Jewish family, and a Christian monk. Because of this, there is a fair bit of personal histories of these individuals included in the documentary, which is interesting, if not wholly relevant to the subject at hand. Credit must be given to the approach, however, since this close perspective does help underscore how the history of these sites in the past has affected the lives of those living around Jerusalem today. Hence, you're getting a lesson in culture and politics, as well as history. As stated before, this can be good or bad, depending on your personal taste.
Regardless, Jerusalem's Holiest Sites is highly informative, and does a very good job explaining the history of these sites and the conflict surrounding them. It's more than just a virtual tour - it takes you back through time and religion, and goes far to help the viewer understand the significance of each of the sites mentioned, most particularly the Temple Mount. I recommend this to anyone interested in religion, culture, history, religious architecture, or even simply for curiosity.",1298678400,17,1306,5.050925925925926

The presentation was kind of sterile in it's attempt to present the information and left me unimpressed.  Although I did not love it, there may be others that may and should take their own chances.  As I said, it did have its good points.",1273276800,4,397,4.397260273972603

2693001,5,B000KJU1EQ,"There's a saying: ""If you need water, you build an aqueduct. If you are looking for God, you come to Jerusalem."" Jerusalem means ""City of Peace."" But as a focal point of three major world religions, and home to some of those faiths' holiest sites, Jerusalem has witnessed 3,000 years of bloody conflict, intrigue and passion.

This compelling documentary from National Geographic, with exclusive access, intimately explores locales held sacred by Jews, Christians and Muslims throughout the centuries. The documentary unveils some of the rare onsite footage of the Holy sites of all the three monotheistic faiths - Judaism, Christianity and Islam. From footage filmed inside the magnificent Dome of the Rock to the vast underground expanse of Solomon's Stables to the traditional sites of Jesus Christ's death and resurrection, it's a spellbinding journey into this ancient, multilayered urban landscape of war, worship and timeless wonder. As a special feature, a useful and Interactive Timeline of Jerusalem along with narration is also provided.

The documentary takes you inside the beautiful Dome of the Rock adorned with Islamic art. It is an Islamic prayer house in what Muslims call Al-Aqsa Mosque, or the Noble Sanctuary (al-Haram al-Qudsi al-Sharif in Arabic; Jews and Christians call it the Temple Mount). Built in between 687 and 691 by the 9th Caliph, Abd al-Malik, it is the oldest extant Islamic building in the world and remains one of the best known landmarks of Jerusalem. The rock in the center of the dome is the spot from which the Muslims believe Muhammad ascended for a night-long journey to Heaven in AD 621, accompanied by the angel Gabriel. In Judaism, the stone is the site where Abraham fulfilled God's test to see if he would be willing to sacrifice his son Isaac. The focus then shifts to the southern congregational mosque in the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound area commonly referred to as Al-Aqsa Mosque which can accommodate about 5,000 people worshipping inside it. The government of Israel has granted a Muslim Council, Waqf, full administration of the whole site of the Noble Sanctuary. Since the beginning of the Al-Aqsa Intifada in 2000, non-Muslims are barred from entering the site. Beneath the Noble Sanctuary is shown the mysterious natural cave known as Well of Souls which is rarely documented. According to Islamic tradition, it is the place reserved for the faithful spirits who will gather on the day of resurrection.

Another remarkable structure of the ancient times shown in the documentary is the Solomon's Stables. It is the common name of an area located directly underneath the south eastern corner of the Temple Mount, an area where the bedrock falls away steeply from the level of the Temple Mount platform. Consisting of rows of massive pillars and arches, the impressive structure was built by King Herod to support the gigantic platform for building the second Jewish temple. The area was later used by the crusaders as stables during the crusades.

The documentary then takes you to an insightful tour of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the most famous Christian church within the walled Old City of Jerusalem. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was first built by Constantine I the Great during the fourth century, after he became christian, and turned Christianity as the official religion of the Roman empire. The ground on which the church stands is venerated by most Christians as Golgotha, the Hill of Calvary, where the New Testament says that Jesus was crucified. It is said to also contain the place where Jesus was buried (the sepulchre). Immediately inside the entrance to the church is the Stone of Unction, which commemorates the preparation of Jesus' crucified body for burial.  The church has been an important pilgrimage destination since the 4th century. Today it serves as the headquarters of the Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem and the Catholic Archpriest of the Basilica of the Holy Sepulchre.

From the Judaism viewpoint, the documentary shows the Western Wall, a retaining wall in Jerusalem that dates from the time of the Jewish Second Temple. It is revered for its proximity to the sacred Holy of Holies on the Temple Mount, which is the Most Holy Place in Judaism. One of the highlights of the documentary is the footage of a small area below ground level, unknown to many, called ""The Cave"", in the Western Wall Tunnel, which is the closest to the site of the Holy of Holies - at one area only about 100 meters away from Holy of Holies. The documentary also unearths Jewish ritual baths discovered recently under the Western Wall which the Jews including Jesus would have used before entering the Jewish Temple during the first century.

This documentary effectively captures the essence and the enigma of the city that is Jerusalem, thereby helping to retrace the main events in the history of Jerusalem with onsite footage, reenactments and excellent narration throughout. It is highly recommended to those who wish to understand the troubled psyche, mystery, passion and legend of the city called Jerusalem.

For the three world faiths, Jerusalem's holiest sites have been a gateway of Heaven since the days of the Bible and shall be so until the day of resurrection. From their beginning, all three faiths shared the common stories, prophets and an undying devotion to the holy sites of Jerusalem. In the end, it is going to be the place where their destinies are also tied to. After watching this, one just wonders how such a tiny piece of land in the whole world could evoke so much passion among the followers of three great world faiths, that their very own lives and their fates are bound to it, whether directly or indirectly, until the end of times.",1191024000,98,5739,4.989550679205852

I have never been to Jerusalem, but would love to visit soon and I bought this movie to learn more about this magic place. I feel so attracted to this place, even if I'm not religious, this place is more than special.  ""Jerusalem is the Center of the World.""",1392249600,,350,4.287878787878788

This video presented information that I was not aware of previously.",1359331200,2,176,5.555555555555555
2693017,2,B000KJU1EQ,"Both content and footage is anemic at best.  Far too much stock footage of people walking around, very little of actual sites.
Definite Muslim slant (eg. ""a Muslim neighborhood was torn down to build this plaza"" is a completely irrelevant statement made discrbing the Western Wall plaza).  Better title would be ""An editorial about the conflicts surrounding the Temple Mount""

Paid $2 for it on on-line and would like my money back.  I pine for the days when National Geographic did good stuff.",1330214400,9,494,4.9156626506024095
2693018,2,B000KJU1EQ,"The documentary is stale and more of a human interest story for modern times than about the ""Holiest Sites."" It follows three families from a Christian, Jewish and Muslim background, but spends a good deal more time following the families around than highlighting the sites for which the city is famous. Also, I get a sense that several of the scholars are fringe and nuttier than most. The title should have been, ""Three worlds collide: Jerusalem"" or something like that - it's simply NOT about the Holiest sites.

My suspicions were confirmed after watching the PBS documentary which has outstanding footage, detailed history, and states the events more matter-of-fact, avoiding political controversy.",1329436800,22,703,5.276785714285714
2693019,1,B000KJU1EQ,Would not recommend this video be used for anything associated with primary or secondary education due to the overwhelming bias.  I am sure the so-called Palestinian Authority approves.,1324771200,12,185,5.607142857142857
2693020,1,B000KJU1EQ,Just watching the first 15 minutes you can see the overwhelming bias of this production. I'd expect a lot more from a reputable group such as National Geographic.,1322265600,8,162,4.821428571428571
2693021,5,B000KJU1EQ,This is a good overview of a tour of the city.  There are some other places I would have wanted to be included - but the main attractions of general interest are well presented.,1310342400,2,177,4.205882352941177
8157675,4,B000KJU1EQ,"The main sites covered and shown were: Dome of the Rock, Wailing Wall, Al-Aqsa Mosque, Solomon's Stables, Well of Souls, Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Various stories from the Bible and Koran concerning why the sites are holy are related. Also many shots of Muslims praying, Jews praying, Christians bearing crosses, etc. Some of those scenes could be stock footage, more or less, so not too exciting. A throbbing background score rounds things off, adds to the entertainment value.

Contrary to another review, the DVD video quality seemed fine to me. However, does not have closed captioning, if that is a consideration. And some of the reviews mention about ""Muslim family's and a Muslim restoration official's complaints"". I did not see any of that. Maybe I think they wee reviewing something different? I am sure I am reviewing the correct product. Finally, some of the reviews mention about a strong pro-Muslim bias. Maybe there was some bias, but it did not seem very strong to me. After all, when the Muslims conquered Jerusalem, the Temple Mount had already been wiped out by the Romans centuries ago.

Overall, whether you are Muslim, Christian, Jewish, something else, or atheist, I think this is a pretty good video to understand more about the holy sites in Jerusalem. Not a huge amount of detail, so could have been shorter. But it's hard to get more detail about some of the off-limits Muslim sites, and what more can you say about the wailing wall that takes more than a few sentences? I think the ""secrets"" title is fair enough, as I leaned a fair number of new things.",1525737600,,1586,4.805860805860806

I don't know how the Blu-Ray would be, but I wish I had ordered it. The Amazon item listing showed DVD and 3D versions available. I should have looked further, because the 3D version apparently also includes a Blu-Ray - but I see negative comments about the video quality of that version, also.
That's too bad, because it's a terrific movie that would be one of my favorites if only the video quality were better.",1518134400,,566,4.5588235294117645
