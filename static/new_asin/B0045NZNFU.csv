8416839,4,B0045NZNFU,"This is a somewhat cute romantic movie... It is about a disillusioned teenager who uses her friends to make money by prostituting themselves to men (this apparently is quite common in Japan)...  Due to a mix-up at a photo store, she gets the pictures for someone else and is intrigued by the person whose photos appear in the package.

She falls in love with the person, giving up her bad past and tries to start a new relationship with the man.  He is a teacher with a hidden secret and tries to discourages her from getting too friendly because of her being a minor.

There is no nudity or profanity in the film, but some sexual references may not be suitable for younger viewers.",1444348800,,682,4.475806451612903
