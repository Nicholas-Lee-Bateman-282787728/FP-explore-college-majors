8168353,5,B000MFGUFC,The review by JCW is for the 7 Volume Don Dickson classroom instruction. This 1 VHS tape is an on the water Mapping and Interpretation instructional clinic that Don Dickson did back in the late 80's. It goes over the two most common types of structure: A Bar and a Hump. Don does a masterful job of teaching Buck Perry's structure fishing principles. He is an excellent teacher and he keeps your attention througout the entire tape. I would highly recommend this tape to anyone that is interested in becoming a Spoonplugger.,1360108800,,524,4.706521739130435
8168354,5,B000MFGUFC,"This series of video tapes is the most comprehensive collection of facts regarding modern day fishing that exists anywhere.  It is all based on the discoveries by Buck Perry over sixty years ago.  Mr. Dickson, whom I have personally fished with, did some of the best video work on fishing facts that have ever been compiled.  If you fact check it against Mr. Perry's written documentation, you will find this collection of tapes are dead on the money. It is a classroom presentation in Minnesota that was presented over two days.  It includes over 200 video slides.  Don covers seven sections: Basic Movements & Migrations,  Structure Breaks & Breaklines, Weather & Water, Lake Types, Tools & Controls, Presentation of Lures, and finally, Mapping & Interpretation.  No where else will you find anything like this.  It is the absolute truth about fishing.  Neither Mr. Dickson nor Mr. Perry where ever sponsored by anyone.  They had no contractual obligations to sell anything.  Only the facts about fishing.  This series of tapes will change your fishing world forever.  The spoonplugs mentioned in the video are available from Buck's Baits on line.  This series of crankbaits were designed by Mr. Perry to run at specific depths on the troll regardless of speed.  They also are the only crankbait ever designed to sink and stay on the bottom, on the cast, all the way back to the boat.  A signifigent design characteristic as you will learn in these tapes.  These tapes have been out of print for over ten years.  I have a set of the originals and still use them today.
You will not be disappointed with this purchase.  A must have for the dedicated fisherman.",1250121600,4,1661,4.826241134751773
