697325,5,6303566545,"After seeing this ""o.g."" when it came out in the 80s, I'm watching it again 2017 and totally seeing Mary Lou as a feminist...but she's the bad guy? Too bad. Am I f.u.? No. I saw her as an anti-hero back in the day w/o understanding why I liked her. Now, I get Mary Lou' s f/u purpose but with more dimension.",1503619200,2,308,3.9838709677419355
697326,5,6303566545,"Excellent, movie has some similarities to Stephan Kings Carrie but I find this filming to be more intriguing there are definitely some unique moments that make this Film original and making its mark as a Classic Horror Film. I love twisted ideas and suspense that take place it's a very smart film in its entirety. The special effects at the time added to the visual story line of the film really bring another level of alluring evil seduction.",1503532800,3,444,4.705128205128205

697328,5,6303566545,This was one of my favorite horror movies growing up. It's a stand alone horror movie. Mary Lou Maloney just wanted to be the prom queen. Nothing will stand in her way of reaching her goals. Thanks!,1501545600,2,198,4.378378378378378
697329,3,6303566545,"This was a pretty good slasher/psychological thriller. It was filmed in Edmonton, so if you've been you will know some of the locations. My dad was living in Edmonton at the time and he was recruited to do some computer work.
I now own the DVD and must say that Micheal Ironside is a good actor, but is famous for going into small-time projects.
Overall this is a good film.",1089590400,3,374,4.357142857142857
697330,5,6303566545,"This film is so 80s and so great!
I love when the blond girl seduces her dad and then throws her mom through the front door! Or when she sings ""a wop baba loo bop, wop bam boo"" and the lockers squish that other girl!",1078617600,,216,3.8222222222222224

7852205,5,6303566545,"In the late 1950's Mary Lou Maloney is accidentally killed by her boyfriend, Bill, after he attempts to pull a prank on prom night in retaliation for her cheating on him. Her spirit then comes back 30 years later via possessing high-school good girl, Vicki Carpenter, to get revenge and have the prom night that she's alway wanted in this (in name only) sequel to the classic Jamie Lee Curtis starrer.

Micheal Ironside, usually quite a good actor, seems to sleepwalk through most of the film as Mary Lou's ex, now principal of the high school and every scene he's in brings the film down. Otherwise, as cheesy and bad as this movie is, the fact remains that I enjoyed the movie for what it is, a cheesy, bad, yet fun 80's horror flick.",1516752000,,736,4.492537313432836
7852206,2,6303566545,"a very poor copy of ""Carrie"".  Bad acting and script.  Not scary at all, in fact it had a lot of stupid moments and was funny sometimes.  Not worth watching!",1516147200,,157,4.166666666666667

7852208,3,6303566545,Not scary at all. Just one off those old not so good movies. The ending when they they were at Prom was funny to me.,1511222400,,116,3.68
7852209,4,6303566545,"Gotta love the 80's TV movie horrors. Just a lot of fun. This one is better than most, with some genuinely good SFX for the time, considering it was probably made on a shoestring budget given that Ironside was in it.

Fun!",1510790400,,222,4.285714285714286
