2807299,4,B000P1YNAC,"Michelle is as personable as they get.  This workout is not only fun but also doesn't even feel like exercise.  Yet you are getting a good one, no doubt.  I recommend this workout for those that are just starting and those all the way up to a medium intermediate.

Add this workout to the other Body Breakthru workouts, use them regularly and you will get yourself out of that 60% of obese Americans.

Easy to catch on to, work up a great sweat and have a fun workout with Michelle.  She's a pro.",1214265600,11,496,4.279569892473118
2807300,5,B000P1YNAC,"Michelle is a terrific instructor who is motivating and encouraging all while being great at what she does.  She knows her stuff and she's outgoing without being overly so and she makes this routine fun even though you are working hard.
You get a resistance band with the dvd and it's used quite a lot in the workout.  There are separate upper and lower body workouts and in each you use the band and weights.  For a lot of the standing exercises, you are working your core too by engaging your ab muscles while doing squats and such.  Each workout is about 30 minutes and I found it to be easy enough but still feeling the benefits from it.  She cues really well so you always know what to do and how to do it, and if you combine this with some cardio too, then you're going to get the results you want.
I love Michelle Dozois and if you are looking for a workout by a professional and motivating instructor that is fun to do and somewhat challenging at the same time, then this is for you.  Once you've done this you'll want all her other dvds as well.  I love this a lot.",1197417600,10,1074,4.209756097560976
2807301,5,B000P1YNAC,This DVD is broken into two segments.  The first is a 30 minute upper body and core workout and the second segment is a 30 minute lower body and core workout.  This is a very challenging yet fun workout.  You will definitely feel it the next morning.  I like that Michelle uses some new and interesting moves with the resistance band that is included with the DVD.  She is a great instructor who is very knowledgeable and fun at the same time.  I would highly recommend this DVD.,1191369600,19,479,4.386363636363637
2807302,5,B000P1YNAC,"In this video from her Your Body Breakthru series, instructor Michelle Dozois offers two 30-minute workouts, Upper Body and Core and Lower Body and Core. Michelle uses both weights and band work (a flat blue band is included with the workout) for fun, innovative strength training moves.  The DVD Main Menu breaks down as follows: Introduction, Upper Body and Core, Lower Body and Core, Chapters, Testimonials, More on Your Body Breakthru, Michelle's personal message, and Contact.

The Chapter menus break down each of the two workouts into four separate segments.  For Upper Body and Core, this amounts to 1=warm=up and chest work, 2=back, biceps, & core, 3=chest, triceps, & core, and 4=shoulders, arms, and cool-down.  Lower Body and Core is a bit more difficult to break down, but basically, 1=warm-up, squats, and 1-leg balance, 2=squats, plies, and abductions, 3=floor and core work, 4=additional floor and core plus cool-down.  Michelle keeps the warm-ups and cool-downs short on both so that you get right into the workouts and finish up with a quick stretch.  Both weights and the band were used, sometimes both at the same time.

These felt like a solid intermediate workout to me.  One of Michelle's four background exercisers always shows easier modifications, so more beginning exercisers would easily be able to modify by following these moves and using lighter weights.  Heavier weights could be used as well, but advanced exercisers looking for a challenge are likely to find this workout a bit too easy.  All of Michelle's background exercisers in the Body Breakthru series are from her classes, and their stories (7 total) are featured in the testimonials section.  They are quite inspiring, as is Michelle's ""personal message,"" which details her struggles as the mother of an autistic son (the DVD case indicates that it is ""Promoting Autism Awareness"").

Overall, Michelle has done an excellent job here in creating a challenging workout that is both interesting and fun to do; I definitely recommend it, and I give it a final rating of about 4 1/2 stars.",1191110400,16,2076,5.109467455621302
8188274,5,B000P1YNAC,"This is a DVD that I had, got rid of and reacquired. This time, I will keep it. I generally don't do split workouts, which is why I originally didn't keep it, but both of the workouts on this DVD are thorough while being moderately paced. It is so nice to do strength workout using a band and weights that lets you take the time to get things into place.

The upper body workout thoroughly works out the upper body muscles, with a bit less work for the triceps than the biceps. There is one plank/push up section in the middle of the workout that has moves on the knees and hands. With my problematic left knee and hands, I don't do all those moves. Otherwise, I found everything doable.

The lower body workout has a good combination of squats and lunges and other lower body moves to thoroughly work the lower body. The only muscles that don't get worked are the calves.

I really like these workouts.",1423008000,,903,4.363095238095238
8188275,5,B000P1YNAC,"love michelle dozois and how she leads a workout.  this workout has multiple levels so even a beginner can keep up, and an advanced person can get a great workout too.",1393286400,,167,4.387096774193548
8188276,5,B000P1YNAC,"Michelle has a unique approach to strength training. A lot packed into a small amount of time. Weights with bands, good instruction. Be sure to use a long enough band when you do these.",1361836800,,185,4.470588235294118
8188277,5,B000P1YNAC,All of Michelle Dozois's DVDs are great!  This one is a weight training/strength training DVD.  Her Cardio DVDs are high intensity and are great for medium-advanced exercisers.,1324339200,,176,5.481481481481482
8188278,4,B000P1YNAC,This DVD is a difficult workout and was way to strenuous for an in shape middle- aged woman. It is geared for a younger woman.,1265414400,,126,4.08
8188279,3,B000P1YNAC,"Although I really like Michelle, I'm a very experienced workout fanatic, who mostly does videos at home. This workout was way too easy for me and I didn't feel challenged at all.",1262822400,,178,4.59375
8188280,3,B000P1YNAC,"This was my first try doing a workout with a band like this one. I have used the kind with the built-in handles a lot. This workout itself is OK- I was sweating and could feel a burn -  but using the band is difficult. I can't figure out exactly where I need to grab it each time and if you start sweating and your hands get slippery, it's difficult to hold onto. Also, the band smells sooooo bad! My hands smelled like nasty rubber after-even after showering. I don't know if this smell wears off eventually, but I can't get past that and have only done the workout 3 times. I kind of liked the instructor and the girls with her, so I may try another of her workouts.",1254528000,4,668,4.138461538461539
8188281,5,B000P1YNAC,"The seller gave me great service--the DVD came quickly and in good condition.

I have other exercise videos with Michelle Dozois so I knew that I would have a good workout DVD that is well organized and easy to follow.  This workout came with the exercise band included which is a help if you don't have one already at home.

I found that the band work patterns after Pilates reformer work--easy to do and Michelle gives hints on using the band to make it less or more challenging.  You can add free weights to some of the exercises or use the band alone.  All in all, I thought Michelle was creative in the use of the resistance band.

I suggest watching the workouts through first so you know what to expect.  She does have one of the participants modify the exercises if one finds it necessary or wants to pull back a little.

All in all, happy with purchase.",1242604800,5,862,4.377358490566038
8188282,4,B000P1YNAC,"I really liked this DVD.  It's challenging but not impossible and it's a DVD you can grow with.  There's a nice variety of exercises.  In the upper body section you'll use the resistance band, weights and for your back and biceps you'll wrap the resistance band around the weight for an extra challenge.  There's also push ups, side plank and tricep dips.  The lower body section has lunge and squat variations with dumbells, standing balance work with the band and pilates style floorwork with the band.  There's more core work in the lower body section than in the upper body section.  Michelle is a friendly instructor and she cues well.  The testimonials from the women who re-shaped their bodies with this workout are inspirational.  My only complaint is the warm up and stretch is very short.  I wish Michelle added a separate, longer stretch segment.  Overall I'm very happy with my purchase.  Michelle packs alot of effective exercises into each segment. Adding the resistance band gives you an extra challenge and keeps it interesting.",1242172800,4,1044,4.936781609195402
8188283,5,B000P1YNAC,"Michelle is terrific - I have many of her workouts and she's fun and energetic and outgoing and not annoying.  She encourages you without being pushy and she's a great cuer.
There are two workouts here; upper body and lower body and each use dumbbells and a resistance band (which comes with the dvd) together.  While you're doing every exercise, your muscle is always challenged - you work against the weight at one position and against the band in another position - which really helps tone.  Your muscles might shake a little here because they are almost always engaged.  You are at times working your core while doing certain exercises and so this becomes a total body workout for sure.  As I mentioned earlier, you get a band with the dvd, but the only other piece of equipment you need is weights and you are good to go.
This is really enjoyable, challenging and effective.  I use it often in my workout routine and still feel the benefit from it.  Michelle is a great instructor and I really recommend that you give it a go because it's definately going to give you great results especially if you do cardio too.  I love it.",1222128000,10,1131,4.536945812807882
