3953097,1,B002MXZYGS,I am an otaku i have watched hundreds of anime and read a lot of manga. This anime is a love story about a young man and dragon from space. it sounds kind of cool but its not. I love romance anime i always hope there is goining to be a good endng. This is the first i have ever watched that i wished all the characters would go ahead and off themselves. I really don't need to go into details just listen to a person who has spent half his life on jap culture and don't buy this crap of a love story. Buy something else anything just not this. Im trying to save you alot of money and regrets.,1263340800,4,592,3.9008264462809916
3953098,3,B002MXZYGS,"I came away from the first installment of Dragonaut with very mixed feelings.  The visuals were pretty impressive, a few of the ideas interesting (the asteroid that's in fact a mobile battle station), and the romance decent, if slightly contrived.  However, what remained to be discovered was whether the second half of the series would improve upon the promise hinted to in the first or completely fall apart based on the non-linear nature of the story threads.  I just finished the second and final installment of the series and can state with certainty that it did neither of what I initially suspected.  It was exactly the same blend of ups and downs as the first set!  Sure it's different in many ways, but the end result looks an awful lot like more of the same- for better or worse.

Spanning a pair of discs Dragonaut The Resonance Part 02 comes packaged in two thin packs within an outer cardboard slipcase and consists of episodes 14-26. The show comes in at a total runtime of 315 minutes and wears an appropriate TV 14 rating due to animated violence, a lot of clothed promiscuous adventure qualities, some near nudity and a whole lot of jiggling.

Language options are standard sub & dub with both an English dub (Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround) and original Japanese soundtrack (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo) & the choice of English subtitled if so inclined to turn them on.

Extras include an English cast commentary over Episode 16, textless opening and closing songs, and a host of fresh Funimation trailers.

The story technically picks up where the initial prose left off in that it involves humanity dealing with the threat of Thanatos, most of what happens throughout the 26-episodes feels like little more than a succession of excuses to have numerous CGI battles involving human-looking individuals who can transform into dragon-like mecha.

The remainder of the prose involves efforts to establish Jin and Toa's disturbed relationship, which mostly involves Jin tracking down Toa across the solar system and Toa ending up saving his life.

The artistry and animation, beyond the clothed fan service (meaning breasts that have more in common with beach balls then human anatomy), is a mixed bag as well. Gonzo has proven time and time again that it is more than capable of dazzling with its use of CG (see my review of Blassreiter for further proof of this), here it results in too much contrast between the computer-generated and non-CG sections.  The dragon models are pretty cool looking and harken back to the mecha designs of the early 1980s, but the reason for their unique design are never fully fleshed out.

The story itself doesn't make any strides in sorting itself out much this time around either but I will say that viewers who were comfortable with the time-line jumping in the first set will likely have no complaints with this one.

None of the fault for the non-linear story presentation lands in the lap of the English dub staff either. It scripts comfortably close to the original, with solid casting choices who deliver the type of emotion captured in the original Japanese.

By the time you reach the conclusion of the show, the viewer is left with a feeling of superfluous resolve but many unanswered plot points to consider.  It almost feels as though the show got a little too caught up in its own tangents and love interests along the way to cover all of the really big bases (like the motivations/ history of the invading aliens).

In conclusion, it's a bit sad that Dragonaut comes off as such a muddled completed piece because on paper it looks to be one of the finest anime titles to come from Gonzo in some time.  It has nearly everything I look for in an anime title- fan service, mecha, clashing civilizations on a grand scale but it simply doesn't play out to meet the potential of the elements contained within.  It's safe to say that fans of the original release will likely enjoy this collection for its ability to conclude the tale but for those (like me) who felt the first 13-episodes were a bit lackluster should prepare for more of the same.",1262649600,4,4098,4.762711864406779
3953099,4,B002MXZYGS,"It is an entertaining love-story meets sci-fi.  It has action and some extremely endowed women for guys to enjoy and surprising does have decent character development to appeal to a female audience as well.  The animation quality is pretty good, but you can still see the CGI on the dragons.  If that is not something that bothers you the show is worth watching.",1261612800,,362,4.714285714285714
3953100,5,B002MXZYGS,So this is an honest review that won't be a weird overdrawn essay on how bad it is. So far its got my interest as the story plays out. The animation is kin to witchblade which I liked as well. good fan service too. Rent it first and buy it if you like it. plus I didn't give any of the story away,1258588800,4,296,3.7142857142857144
3953101,3,B002MXZYGS,"I know, I know you should never judge a book by its cover but even still I have to admit that Dragonaut -The Resonance's cover had me interested. And what's not to love about a cover that depicts a massive biomechanical dragon and a from-below view of a near-naked girl?  Needless to say, I was a fan before the first episode.  The show continues to dazzle with the material promised by the cover art but before we get into that, let's take a moment to look at the cold hard facts of this FUNimation release.

Spanning a pair of discs Dragonaut The Resonance Part 1 comes packaged in two thin packs within an outer cardboard slipcase and consists of episodes 1-13. The show comes in at a total runtime of 323 minutes and wears an appropriate TV 14 rating due to animated violence, a lot of clothed promiscuous adventure qualities, some near nudity and a whole lot of jiggling.

Language options are standard sub & dub with both an English dub (Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround) and original Japanese soundtrack (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo) & the choice of English subtitled if so inclined to turn them on.

Extras include textless opening and closing songs, and a host of fresh Funimation trailers.

The story itself goes something like this: Twenty years in the past, an asteroid enters our small solar system and completely destroys the small planetoid that we know as Pluto (well at least that's what we called it then). Due to Pluto's destruction, the asteroid, (Thanatos) has become lodged within Pluto's long orbit around our sun.

It turns out that Thanatos is not just some erratically flying chunk of rock as was initially believed and is in fact a living organism that's got earth in its targets for complete destruction next.  Thanatos is actually home to a bunch of ultra powerful dragon-like beings that can conquer the void of space to invade planets with alarming destructive efficiency.

In order to give Earth a fighting chance against the inevitable threat, the International Solarsystem Development Agency (ISDA) develops a top-secret program labeled the D-Project, which hatches a dragon egg recovered from the ocean and uses the organism within as a powerful weapon for humanity.  Long story short- we'll try to fight fire with fire (or dragon with dragon as the case may be).

The viewer follows the exploits of a teenage schoolboy named Jin Kamishina and the tale opens literally with a massive tragedy that is sure to grab the attention of even the most easily distracted observer.

If linear time lines happen to be your thing, you'll probably want to steer clear as we jump around the time continuum in this plot like a frog on a hot plate.  The core of the tale actually takes place two years after the initial tragedy where a now 18-year-old Jin finds himself buried in conspiracy theory involved with the ISDA and their efforts to hatch/ prepare dragons for battle from the impending attack.

Helping him both to make sense of the madness (and saving his life nearly constantly) is Toa, a mysterious pink haired, well-endowed girl with a penchant for very short shorts.

If this all sounds good to you so far, let me burst your bubble slightly by saying that the tale works far better as a few written paragraphs than it does an epic anime saga as it attempts to be.  Sadly in its delivery, Dragonaut is a very sundry blend of story elements that never fully finds itself (at least not in the first 13 episodes anyway).  On the one hand you have the typical anime clichs such as the innocent but depressed kid who holds the key to humanity's salvation, the cast of adult women who jiggle from scene to scene with no apparent knowledge of the need for a bra, the mysterious yet bubbly (voluptuous) alien girl, and enough CGI dragons to give Peter Jackson a case of envy.

Aside from the superficial there are attempts at covert operations, conspiracy theories, alien invasions, space exploration, extraterrestrial technologies, human/ animal bonds, moon colonization, feuding agencies, teen angst, campy romance attempts, and even some ""boy meets girl"" teen melodrama.  If this sounds like a full plate, believe me it is.  Every once in a while a thread develops that delivers on the potential within but more often than not the prose feels pretty muddled.

The visuals are quite stunning as is par for the course with anime masters Gonzo (who collaborated with Nihon Ad Systems (NAS) on this one) with beautiful skies, a colorful pallet, nice animation and many CGI heavy intense battle sequences.

The dragons themselves remind me a bit of the models used in Heroic Age but the human/dragon bonding element harkens to something you might expect from a giant robot themed program.

The score is nice and crisp with some catchy J-Pop themes and upbeat tempos to compliment the action sequences.

In all Dragonaut The Resonance Part 1 is quite an ambitious property, maybe even too ambitious for its own good.  There are hints of Vandread and Gundam buried within the dozens of clashing elements that never fully cement themselves into a continuous classification.  The show certainly has its moments but unfortunately they are too few and far between to place it firmly into ""must buy"" status.",1257120000,16,5213,4.829213483146067
3953102,1,B002MXZYGS,"Watch out! A giant space asteroid has destroyed Pluto and is unleashing CGI space dragons on the Earth!

Yeah, I don't really buy that concept either. But unfortunately the concept is still the best part of ""Dragonaut: Resonance Part 1,"" a flaccidly plotted little anime that covers its plot holes and confusing storyline with lots and lots of CGI dragons, jiggling breasts and power-of-fuzzy-sparkly-love-will-prevail stuff.

Two years after his family was killed in a shuttle accident, Jin is being followed by a mysterious pink haired girl -- and it turns out the ISDA is interested in making him a dragon-riding Dragonaut, like his old pal Kazuki. Amazingly, Jin isn't really surprised by any of this.

And as he and the girl Toa fall in love (over the course of, like, half an hour), the ISDA's dragons attack her -- and she suddenly transforms into a dragon as well. Since Jin has seen her true form, Toa flies off to the moon, but Jin is determined to find her -- along with a newborn dragon named Gio, who was supposed to be Kazuki's but who claims he was born to protect Toa. Cue emo woe of angst.

Of course the ISDA's Dragonauts are sent off to find Toa because she is a ""living original,"" and the Gillard military -- led by the silicone-sacked Major Garnet -- is trying to capture Gio so they can find out how Resonance (the bond between a dragon and human) works. But Jin and Gio have their own secret allies among the Dragonauts, as well as a new enemy, Kazuki.

""Dragonaut"" is a mess in most every way -- half the time you won't know what's going on and why (why are people ATTACKING Toa if they want her alive?), and the other half you'll be scratching your head over the random plot twists. The series is at its strongest when it focuses on the whole idea of the Dragonauts, the conspiracy to sabotage them (including a truly spooky subplot early on, involving a dragon eating humans) or when they rely heavily on comedy (usually from Howlingstar).

Unfortunately, little of the story is actually about that -- and while the series starts off intriguing, it sinks under the weight of its own melodramatic angst, lots of dramatic aerial battles (and space battles), and jiggling. In fact, when you strip it down, the entire first part of the series is basically made up of Toa running headlong into trouble, while Jin and Gio chase after her (usually with screams of ""Toa!"" ""Jin!"" ""Toa!"" ""Jin!"").

It also has extremely patchy animation -- the dragons are basically big draconic mecha, rendered in flat, matte CGI that looks like it was lifted from a video game. And WHOA what is up with all the BREASTS? Most of the women in this series have giant sacks of Jello boinging around their chests and hanging out of their porn-star outfits, (these are high-ranking military and scientists?). Girls get a few shreds of fanservice -- Gio and Howlingstar in tiny little swimming trunks -- but it's not much comparatively.

Jin is also rather useless as a hero -- he never really DOES anything, and we never really find out why he's instantly crazy in love with Toa (and vice versa). Most of the other characters range from flat (Liner, Sieglinde) to crazy (Kazuki, who even gives himself a ""crazy"" haircut). The dragons are actually the most striking characters -- the peppy quirky Howlingstar, the paternal Amadeus, and especially Gio, whose fanatical devotion is shaken when he starts to question his fate.

""Dragonaut: The Resonance Part 1"" starts off interesting enough to keep watching, but rapidly falls apart under the weight of its angst and silliness. Maybe it improves later on, but I'm not holding my breath.",1251676800,10,3628,4.718799368088468

3953104,5,B002MXZYGS,This was a great anime. Love how it worked you up so you had to keep going to the next episode. I watched on netflix and then had to buy it and add to my collection. It was a good story with all the cast putting there all into there parts. I started to watch just to see where it would go and watched the whole first season at one setting. You will love this Dragonaut if you are in it for the fun of it.,1310515200,12,404,3.7093023255813953
3953105,4,B002MXZYGS,I've seen this series before and thought that it was an alright series. There was too much CG in it and the battles looked sort of cheesy but all in all I liked it enough to want to buy it.,1297123200,,189,3.75
3953106,4,B002MXZYGS,"Dragonaut: Part 2 is where the epic action & level of danger starts to spike. The storyline centres around Jin, Toa, & Gio. Their situation is not looking very bright since their names are on the Dragon hunting list & the threat from outer space named (Sorry, can't tell you) is approaching Earth at an accelerating rate. Join Jin & Toa as they avoid pursuit & avoid widespread destruction of the planet Earth. The plot has increased the level of urgency making the plot more exciting but still suffers from a lot of dull moments being filled with fan service.
The voice acting is still pretty good in portraying the characters emotions & thoughts. The dialogue is still straight forward & understandable with a few awkward conversations. Overall, a good recovery from the slow start of the anime series from Dragonaut: Part 1.
I will make this anime series optional for anime fans.

3953107,3,B002MXZYGS,"Dragonaut: Part 1 is one of those anime series that presents itself with some epic action & lots of dull moments. The storyline consists of an organization developing outer space weapons in response to a growing threat from an unknown celestial entity. Tied within this storyline are two lovers attempting to prosper their love during a time of conflict between the Earth & this unknown celestial entity. The plot is somewhat interesting with epic battle scenes & cool out of this world combat powers but still has a lot of dull moments that are reserved for fan service; lots of fan service.
The voice acting is pretty good in portraying the personalities of the characters. The dialogue is somewhat confusing due to the lack of details given about this unknown celestial entity & this organization's involvement with a developing weapon called ""Dragons"".
I will make this anime series optional for all anime fans.

Of course the ISDA's Dragonauts are sent off to find Toa because she is a ""living original.""

But then (and by ""then"" I mean a year later) all dragons -- artificial or ""original"" -- are endangered when a Cliche Evil Military Company turns against them, Gio suddenly starts attacking everybody, and Thanatos is beginning to threaten the planet again. Of course, Jin and Toa alone can save us. HELP.

Angst. Breasts. Space battles. Breasts. Killer Asteroid. Angst. Breasts. Random turns to evil Breasts. Bland romance. That's pretty much the only description I can think of to give ""Dragonaut: Resonance"" -- it's just such a bland, unappealing series, with characters that seem bipolar and an animation style that keeps snapping you out of the story.

Now I will admit that there are some powerful moments, especially in the middle of the series, including shocking deaths and a conspiracy to attack them. Unfortunately, it takes more than TEN EPISODES for the main plot to really start, and most of those episodes are made up of Toa running headlong into trouble, while Jin and Gio chase after her (usually with screams of ""Toa!"" ""Jin!"" ""Toa!"" ""Jin!"" SHUT UP). Even worse: the ending is just... lame.

It also has extremely patchy animation -- the dragons are basically big draconic mecha, rendered in flat, matte CGI that looks like it was lifted from a cheap video game. And WHOA what is up with all the BREASTS? Most of the women in this series have giant sacks of Jello boinging around their chests and hanging out of their porn-star outfits (these are high-ranking military and scientists?).

Jin looks a lot like Sasuke from ""Naruto,"" but is much blander and even angstier; Toa is equally bland. Kazuki is a selfish pig who spends the whole series acting like a psycho (HAIRCUT OF DEATH!), and Gio is just a character that makes you think, ""Why is he even in this show? And why is he he twirling his legs around?"". And there's just SO MUCH WHINING.

It took me multiple tries to get through ""Dragonaut: Resonance"" because it left me wanting to punch most of the characters. Bland, boring and often confusing.",1285632000,7,3084,4.762172284644195

3953110,2,B002MXZYGS,"When watching this, it reminded me of Evangelion. To the point where I never really could be bothered to learn the names of most of the cast - I just thought Shinji Equivalent, Asuka Equivalent, Kaji Equivalent, Ritsuko Equivalent, Maya Equivalent. The story turned out to be obviously derivative as well. Ultimate plan of the villain? Grant everyone in the world a Resonance so that it/she can trigger Third Impact. But the thing that really makes this anime forever second rate isn't the derivative story, it's the fact that every single problem faced by anyone in the cast is caused by an inexcusably stupid mistake on the point one or both of the governments involved - and the closest either of them get to facing justice is Gio trashing most of Mars - which gets blamed on the dragon, not the idiot princeling who had been deliberately provoking the dragons for half a season using methods that qualify as acts of war.

I think the one complaint is that it isn't 'up to American standards'... which I don't care if it is or NOT. The American mindset seems to be more towards the 'kill 'em all let god sort 'em out!' type of stuff.

This is a study of a romance and emotional conflicts -teen-adolescent and adult.  Though it seems defeatist, if one compares it with say ""Gundam- Stardust"", or ""Bakurano"" or how many other dying hero/heroine style anime, you either like it or you don't.

8374224,5,B002MXZYGS,"It took a few episodes for me to get into this anime, but I'm really glad I did. The anime is too short to really live up to its potential, but it's certainly worth the watch for the interesting story. The character development is fairly simplistic and disappointing. The dragons don't get enough screen time and their fights could have been much more intense. The last few episodes really hook you enough to forgive the series' earlier shortcomings.

If you ever thought Gundam dragons would be a cool idea, you'll probably like this. If you can get invested in simple characters with single-minded ambitions and a cute love story, you'll probably like this. If you like anime characters with boobs that defy physics, you'll definitely like this.

If you're expecting something on par with Attack on Titan as far as plot and character development, you probably won't like this.

8374231,3,B002MXZYGS,"You can't let yourself get too in to this one, or you'll get disappointed very quickly. The writers try very hard to create a complicated and deeply convoluted plot, but it all ends up being too confusing. Either that or you don't feel involved enough to care. What it basically boils down to is boy meets girl, who is a dragon. Lots of angry people with guns and dragons of their own don't want them to be together. So they run. Then they get caught, then they escape, then they run some more. Then they decide they can't be together, so they break up, then the people who they think are helping them turn on them and so on rinse and repeat. I could go in to more detail, but it doesn't matter. There are bits and pieces and fights and situations that will have you totally interested and then there are other forced conflicts that you don't really know why they are fighting, what is at stake or the goal is if either side wins. What you do get along the way are some good visuals with some epic space battles, some car chases, interesting vehicles and spacecraft and breasts. The fanservice ranges from just a serious conversation or fight or poignant moment that just happens to involve a woman or three with extremely large chests to blatant camera angles and overt jiggling. Most all of these women tend to wear very low cut blouses to accentuate their assets and depending on your feeling about that it can either make a boring episode bearable or make the whole show too embarrassing or uncomfortable to watch. If you are like me you are an anime fanatic but you sometimes want to ""share"" your love of the genre with others to get them in to it. This isn't the one to show your GF, wife or anyone who isn't already used to the boob factor some animes have.

To sum things up, Dragonaut is worth a viewing or rental. You'll find some parts of it entertaining, some of it titillating (if you happen to be a fan of really big boobs) and also a bit annoying if you are looking for a serious technical story with a well formed plot.",1334880000,6,2035,4.369393139841689
