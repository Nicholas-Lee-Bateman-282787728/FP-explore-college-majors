8332125,4,B001P53ISU,"Pity the DVD could not grant the whole scope of US Opens, as there were so many memorable ones which preceded those which followed from 1960 onwards. 1950 Merion, 1955 Olympic, 1930 Interlachen come to mind, just as examples. But what is presented is good, so are the extras provided. Could have been a little more in depth with recap interviews with the kep personalities from each open, and lets be honest, there have been plenty of those! Notwithstanding, a very watchable presentation.",1320278400,,489,4.903614457831325
8332126,2,B001P53ISU,"As a high school golf coach, I purchased this video with the hopes that my golf team members would be able to watch the video and gain a greater appreciation for the great moments of the game. I hoped it would build greater interest and excitement to golf for these students who are being introduced to the game.

Sometimes, I wish the producer/narrator would just set up moments and let the footage speak for itself.

Unfortunately, the use of ""elevator"" music creates a sense of ""blah"" and the constant presence of a narrator adding his own comments rather than the live footage and TV commentators seem to sap the excitement of the moment from the videos.

The producers would be better served if someone took the video and reedited the music/sound to build in the natural drama of the moments or select music that sounds dramatic/exciting rather than ""elevator"" music leading to drowsiness.

In other words, quality content in terms of footage, but the weak production value detracts from the excitement of some of golf's greatest moments.",1278720000,3,1043,4.875706214689266
