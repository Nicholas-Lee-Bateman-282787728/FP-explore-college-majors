8361890,5,B002BSPWUW,"I have purchase several of these dvd from this company and love them all. They are perfect on our 65 inch TV in our great room when we are entertaining.  We have beautiful sceneries on what other wise would be a big black rectangle on our walls. The music if you chose to have it on, is soft calming and easy back ground music while entertaining. LOVE THESE PRODUCT AND THIS COMPANY.
I receive no compensation of any sort for this review. I just really enjoy these products.",1448323200,5,474,4.386363636363637
8361891,1,B002BSPWUW,"Very disappointed in this DVD for two reasons.  One, the Amazon description says ""tribal music"" as the background and the DVD label actually says Native American flute music -- but the entire soundtrack is Vivaldi's Four Seasons. Not that Vivaldi is so bad but I would rather hear the other.  Next, the film quality is pretty bad.  Forget about playing this on your big plasma!",1420243200,7,377,4.769230769230769
