7306178,3,B01080QWSA,"These are fun to watch if you like gross out humor, the idea of a foul-mouth Teddy Bear I am sure looked good on paper, upon watching these I found myself laughing out loud, upon a second viewing, not so much, I will admit a Teddy Bear with a NY-screw-you-accent is no doubt fun to watch, but I just don't get Seth McFarland's obsession with bodily functions......

In the first film a kid in 1985 wishes his teddy bear to come to life, his wish is granted....fast foward to 2012 & the kid (Mark Wahlberg) is now grown up & in a relationship with Mila Kunis who feels Ted is a bit intrusive, their relationship is put to the test as Wahlberg has to decide which one is more important, the relationship aspect is good, but Kunis coming home to find Ted with a bunch of call girls where one has crapped on the floor was a bit too much, which bothered me a bit......a totally unnecessary scene to say the least.....the pot smoking scenes again unnecessary........things I did like was Sam J. Jones making fun of himself as his 1980 film ""Flash Gordon"" is Ted & Wahlberg's favorite movie, Sam really has fun here with that & since he is playing himself, one wonders if he is a pothead....all in all the first film is good but mainly because of Mila Kunis who brings dignity to the film, however I can see why she didn't return for the sequel.........there is also a reference to ""Superman Returns"" at the end where the narrator (Patrick Stewart) talks about how horrible the film is, please Seth, keep your opinion to yourself!!!!!!!!!.....not everybody thinks your films are great either!!

The second film is more of the same with the gross out humor, such as the scene at the fertility clinic where Wahlberg accidently has a shelf fall on him with many semen samples getting all over him, again, what is Seth's obsession with bodily fluids???....yes it is played for laughs, but it amazes me that the MPAA didn't demand the scene be cut, In this one Ted wants to prove he is human, & Amanda Seyfried fills in for the female love interest for Wahlberg who is Ted's attorney to fight for his right to be recognized as a person, but she too is a pot smoker, this one likes to rip off many others films such as Liam Neeson making a cameo playing his ""Taken"" character, to Ted driving down a road in a scene that rips off ""Planes, Trains, & Automobiles"", the only real fun part is the end where they end up at comic-con where Michael Dorn is dressed up as Worf (Star Trek Next Generation) who played the character on the show, Sam J. Jones once again making fun of himself as ""Flash Gordon""  to the ""Jurassic Park"" theme playing when Ted & Wahlberg discover a pot field, if you like gross out humor this is for you, but after a second viewing I found these films a bit to hard to take, they really require a serious suspension of disbelief big time, another ridiculous scene is in the courtroom when Ted's wife says he has no male anatomy despite the fact that we have already seen him having sex with her, she is not all that likeable, although Mark Wahlberg has fun in these films, he has done better things, Amanda Seyfried really is much more talented to be in a film like this, she does her best with what she was given to work with, but she wasn't given the same material that Mili Kunis was given & that is a shame......

Overall....these are good if you like bathroom humor or pot smoking scenes......unfortunately Cheech & Chong Ted & Wahlberg are NOT!
but after a second viewing not so funny.",1467417600,,3496,4.432348367029549
7306179,5,B01080QWSA,"I didn't think Ted 2 could be funnier than the first but they proved me wrong. Though they are both hilarious indeed the second had me dying. I want spoil the movie, but typically anything with mark Wahlberg has turned out great .",1455494400,,230,4.372093023255814

It was amazing, something I'll never forget. So, Ted/Ted 2 have his comedic spirit and are worth a watch or ten.",1519171200,,287,4.333333333333333
