Many of us have lied or made mistakes before.  Fortunately for us, our misdeeds are not recorded in the Bible.  Luke 22:54-62 recounts Peter denying that he knew Jesus three times, just as Jesus predicted.  After Jesus resurrection He restores Peter by having Him affirm him three times in John 21:15-19.  The movie Peter: The Redemption depicts Peter living his final months in a Roman jail and refusing to confess to burning down the city under Neros rule.  Despite being given several opportunities to recant his faith, Peter holds firm and refuses to deny Jesus any more in his lifetime.  Unfortunately, several other Christians are persecuted and tortured as a result.

There are many bloody and uncomfortable scenes as Christians are seen getting beaten and bloodied.  For this reason, younger children should probably refrain from seeing this film.  Fortunately, the scenes with them being set on fire are not shown, but the screams of torture still hit home.  Many popular actors are in this ninety-minute film including John Rhys-Davies as Peter and Stephen Baldwin as Nero.
Besides the story of Peters strong faith, there is a budding romance between a dedicated Roman soldier named Martinian and a palace servant, Suzanna, who is tending to Peters many wounds.  Suzanna is a Christian and is treading on thin ice as Nero detests Christians and enjoys using them as torches to illuminate his garden.  To make matters worse Nero takes a liking to her and his wife is extremely jealous.

I won't spoil this movie, but unlike many Christian films out there, Peter The Redemption tells a good story about faith, love, forgiveness, and perseverance.  Not all of the believers keep their faith as some of the prisoners recant to regain their freedom.  However, others die for their faith and those strong Christians inspire unlikely individuals to become saved and get baptized in Jesus name.

For less than $10 for the DVD, Peter: The Redemption is worth picking up.  Though there doesnt seem to be a Blu-ray version available, the visual quality is surprisingly good for a DVD.  My husband and I were pleasantly surprised with the overall quality of this film and highly recommend it to believers and non-believers alike.",1471737600,9,2282,4.98941798941799
7750530,4,B01FKPW2BO,"Our family recently saw this film and loved it! I thought the actors all did a great job and Nero was creepy and evil as per history. It seemed like a realistic portrayal of how it would have been during that time. I do not just watch faith based films, but I can appreciate them when they are not overtly pushing religion. Which I know is rare. But, there is more of a realistic moral message being presented. Leaving room for the viewer to have his/her own thoughts. I enjoy watching morality based films with my family. Especially with my teens because we can have great conversations that relate to the values I hope they carry into adulthood. Personally, I am a fan of actors John Rhys-Davies and a fan of Bobbie Phillips from the great television series Murder One.  It was a pleasant surprise to see her again since it seems she left acting for a long while. She played her role very well. I enjoyed the relationship of Suzanna and Martinian and thought the actors did an excellent job. The costumes and look were very well done keeping in mind it was made for DVD not the big screen. I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys biblical films. But, I think others who know about the history of the Roman Empire and the evil Nero will enjoy this take on it.",1471737600,6,1263,4.397435897435898

8760975,5,B01FKPW2BO,"Considering that this is a small budget film, we found it better than most Christian films available today.  If you are interested in Bible history mixed with a bit of romance and some imaginative storytelling, it is well worth viewing.  I would suggest that before watching, you might brush up on your history concerning Nero's reign.  While Baldwin chews the scenery a bit, Nero was so insanely crazy that he is probably more closer to reality than not.

I believe that it's important to support these Christian film makers when they do a good job, especially when they can't compete financially with big studios.  I am looking forward to seeing what this company produces next.",1484956800,,680,4.878260869565217

8760978,5,B01FKPW2BO,"I just received this film on DVD. It is an excellent faith based movie depicting Peter is his last months.
I found the film very inspirational and moving. The actors were all terrific. I think the scenes well represented the times.
Especially on a small budgeted film. The movie kept my attention. I found myself wondering what happens next with Nero and his wife during his rule. I would love to see a continuation. I agree with the other reviewer that maybe it's too much for small children, but it is definitely a strong message of faith.",1474588800,,541,4.587628865979381
8760979,1,B01FKPW2BO,The production was on the level of a high school drama team. I really can't say anything more about it....couldn't get through the first 30 amateurish minutes. I'm glad I only paid $4. for it - not worth asking for my money back.,1473638400,,229,4.348837209302325
