4460084,4,B004RAIZ8I,I have seen all of the other seasons of this series and this season is just as good as all the others.  If you like Canadian humor in an odd setting you'll enjoy Red Green.,1324512000,,172,3.914285714285714
4460085,3,B004RAIZ8I,"When the Red Green Show first started putting out DVDs, they started with season 7 and went one season at a time. It sort-of made sense; the show's popularity had expanded at that point, and there were apparently some rights issues with the early shows.

Unfortunately for fans, they stopped 5 seasons in with the 2001 season, then went back and started doing the 3-season packs. Fans who bought seasons 7-9 had it easy, just skip the one pack. Fans who bought seasons 10 and 11, not so much.

While we surely appreciate the 2002 season being put out as a single to negate the pricing issue of ""re-buying"" the two seasons we already bought, the price tag - $35 for this single seasons as opposed to $50 for all three - is just ridiculously high.",1305590400,13,745,4.470588235294118
4460086,5,B004RAIZ8I,"While I am glad to see Red Green released on DVD, these 3 season were already released earlier as individual seasons by Acorn Media. I want the seasons beyond 2001 released!......and soon please Acorn Media!!",1301011200,,208,4.9714285714285715
4460087,5,B004RAIZ8I,"This is Canadian TV comedy at it's BEST..!!....Steve Smith, Graham Green, and the rest of the series cast are side splitting in their antics..!!
Most of what they do is ""family rated"" and suitable for most members...but some of their humor the kids may not ""get"" as it is somewhat nostalgic. This is an excellent series and I highly recommend it. Done in ""vignettes"" and short sketches, Steve Smith pokes fun at almost everything and everyone. Some of his ""inventions"" to solve daily problems are truly creative and bizarre....but extremely funny..!! I believe it originally aired on PBS or the BBC channel. This is an excellent series.",1293753600,5,636,4.953271028037383
4460108,5,B004RAIZ8I,Ordered for my father and he loves it. First time I've seen him smile so much. Plus he is laughing a lot more. He loves Red Green. So happy to if found this for him,1483315200,,164,3.7142857142857144

4460111,5,B004RAIZ8I,"I loved the Red Green show, so of I course I love this collection.  However, my 5 stars have a caveat. I purchased this set at one of his ""I'm not old, I'm ripe"" live performances and paid the asking price of $225, only to check the Red Green web site the next day and see that it was listed at $199.99. At the same performance, I also bought his book, ""Red Green's Beginner's Guide to Women"" at the asking price of $25, only to find that on the web site it was listed at $18.95. Orders over $50 are shipped for free.  So, by purchasing these items at a live appearance, I overpaid by $31.06. I suggest you don't make the same mistake. It seems that Red Green is more of a capitalist than I thought!",1473811200,,699,4.094890510948905

4460114,5,B004RAIZ8I,Love love love this show. First 4 seasons seem slow and dry but it picks up quickly after that. For $0.32 per episode and $3 per movie (my own value breakdown of the price I paid) This is a great DVD set! I was worried with that many discs that the cases would be cheap and I would receive scratched discs. This was not the case as all discs were flawlessly new.,1468540800,,362,4.041666666666667

4460117,5,B004RAIZ8I,Super funny show that my grandpa and I would watch together all the time on pbs. He is unfortunately gone now but I still watch the show and remember how he would laugh at some of the more adult jokes that I was too young to understand at the time. As an adult it's just as funny as I remember as a kid.,1461974400,,303,3.8253968253968256

4460120,5,B004RAIZ8I,"Absolutely hilarious.  A friend of ours, in Canada, had told us about this show many years ago, but it wasn't on TV in our area.  I'd ordered the Stuffed N Mounted set some years back and we really liked it.  When I found the entire series available I couldn't pass it up.  This show is so funny.  We definitely recommend it.",1456185600,,325,4.262295081967213

4460124,5,B004RAIZ8I,I've always been a Red Green fan but not a coinsure so I'm not overly concerned about what was not included in the set as some posts have indicated. Its been interesting to watch the progression from season to season as they experience with the format of the show.

4460129,5,B004RAIZ8I,I bought this a couple of months ago for my dad's christmas gift this year (2015). Christmas hasn't come yet and I can't wait to see how happy he will be to open it. It came to me packaged well and it's a little smaller than I thought it would be. But it really has everything in it that it says it does.,1446681600,,304,3.8412698412698414

4460133,5,B004RAIZ8I,"I bought this as a gift for my Dad about a year ago, who is a huge fan of the Red Green Show. He used to watch it every Saturday until they stopped airing it, so I thought it was about time I bought him his favorite show on DVD! Perfect gift for him, he loved it and watched it constantly... until he accidentally broke on of the discs while trying to remove it from the case.

Well, he told me not to bother to do anything about it, but he seemed so sad. So about a month or two after I made the purchase, I e-mailed Acorn Media (as they are the company listed on the box) and explained the situation, asking if it's possible to get a replacement for the disc that broke and only that one disc. I told them it was my Dad who broke it, not an accident or any fault on their part. I didn't really expect anything from it, but I had to try.

Completely shocked when I received an e-mail back from them asking for my mailing address where they could send a new disc free of charge. Wow! Within a few weeks we had the replacement disc. It was amazing customer service on their part, and a year later I still remember how nice they were about the whole thing, and it made my Dad so happy. He still watches this box set constantly. Every time I call him and hear a TV in the background, I ask what he's watching, and it's always Red Green. Definitely worth my money, especially for that amazing customer service I received. So thank you Acorn Media, I still remember what you did last year and really appreciate it.",1444089600,3,1509,4.129251700680272

My husband has loved this show for years.  I bought him this combined set in the very nice box for Christmas 2013.

4460141,4,B004RAIZ8I,"I bought the box set for my dad, and we have been enjoying the box set.  The menus can be a little obnoxious to figure out, I've seen simpler DVD interfaces, but it's not too bad.  Despite the back of the boxes showing a ""CC"" logo to indicate closed captioning, the earliest seasons have not had captions added to them (I'm sure they weren't captioned when they originally aired, but I thought for the sake of the DVD they may be added, no such luck, which made it a little more difficult for my father, particularly considering the audio quality of the first few seasons wasn't all that great, either).

All in all it's a box set I'm happy to own, but it's not without its flaws.",1438646400,,680,4.338582677165355

We're not sure where the name ""Red Green"" came from, but we like to believe that it means a ""redneck with a commitment to a green world.""  Red Green lives in Canada, and he just might win the award as the ""reddest"" (ouch .... sorry about that) Redneck of them all!  Definitely fun and enjoyable!",1437436800,,469,4.344827586206897

These particular DVD's appear to be of high quality...it will take some time for me to sample all of them but the first DVD and one of the bonus DVD's that I viewed are sharp.

Long before those guys on Mythbusters  discovered alternative uses for duct tape - Red Green was demonstrating just how handy it could be.

4460188,4,B004RAIZ8I,"This show was great, I can remember watching it as a kid and some as I grew up.  The set let me watch all 300 episodes and enjoy the antics and inventions of Steve Smith's Red Green without all the foul language of many of today's comedies.  My favorite character was Mike, the semi reformed thief with a seeming heart of gold played at many times with so much energy during the Word Game by Wayne Robinson.  I also really liked Harold played brilliantly by Patrick McKenna who captured Harold's socially awkward and nerdy ways  Rick Green as Bill during the Adventures with Bill and later just Adventures segment was also a highlight and how he was never killed I will never figure out with everything he went through, fell off of, was hit by, etc.  I also liked Winston, Hap, Ranger Gord who spent far too many years alone in that tower  and turned making slightly disturbing cartoons.  Graham Greene''s demolitions enthusiast Edgar Montrose was also great and it took me a while but I eventually came to like Dalton.
The different characters and segments as the show evolved over the years were a hit.  Red showed a certain naivety about the  world outside of Possum Lake and Lodge.  The first season you could tell they had no money or idea what they were doing, and watching the show grow and change over the years kept it fresh and eventually a ride you could settle into and enjoy (as long as Red did not build the car) and laugh at.  As I said I enjoyed this as a kid and as I grew up.  Watching it again I realize I know people like these guys.  Different actors appeared, all Canadian but some I recognized from appearances in American shows.
I loved this show and the set, and only took a star off for a two reasons.  One it was not a complete set, as the movie Duck Tape Forever was missing and I had to buy this separate.  The other reason was the lack of commentary and bonus content, from what I have seen of the Stuffed and Mounted Sets they had much more.  Only bonus material here were a few videos and intros by Steve Smith.  However all the specials were included.  Beyond that, I am sad that I finished it.

4460189,5,B004RAIZ8I,"This collection is just about the funniest and far out craziest redneck humor I've ever seen.  If you're not a mechanically inclined male or have a technical appreciation about how things work, then this is not for you.  This is good clean ole fashioned ""man cave"" humor that should be enjoyed without women present unless they have a really good sense of humor.  Most of the skits are side splitting funny and will bring tears to your eyes. If you are one who uses duct tape on a fairly regular basis then this collection is a must have for you. If you are a do-it-yourself kind of guy and fix things using the ""Gerry Rigging"" method then this is also a must have.

4460252,5,B004RAIZ8I,"COMPLETE RED GREEN SHOW: From somewhere within the vast wilderness of Canada came THE RED GREEN SHOW, a no budget ""do it yourself"" sitcom starring STEVE SMITH as the genial, advice-dispensing head of POSSUM LODGE, a messy man-cave haven for eccentric outcasts...basically the same people that populate your own workplace, neighborhood and family. RED's clueless cronies included his uber-geek nephew HAROLD (PATRICK MCKENNA, who made BARNEY FIFE look like JOHN WAYNE), bow tied septic sucker WINSTON ROTHSCHILD III, wild haired store proprietor DALTON HUMPHREY, petty thief MIKE HAMAR and lonesome RANGER GORD among other assorted kooks. Regular off kilter features such as HANDYMAN CORNER (demonstrating creative uses for old car parts and duct tape), WORD GAME (think the TEN CENT PYRAMID), and ADVENTURES WITH BILL (black & white home movies of slapstick-filled mayhem) kept things rolling along at a hilariously frantic pace. In a gloriously convoluted ""men will be men"" world of rusted out grills, tangled fishing tackle, misused tools and abandoned vehicles...THE RED GREEN SHOW was a ""no-brainer"" for fifteen testosterone fueled seasons.

Perhaps those used to multi-million dollar productions may find this ""crude"" from a budget perspective, but to me at least, that it part of it's charm. All 15 seasons only get better and better. As some have commented, the only truly annoying aspect of watching the show is the chainsaw in the background. I'm not sure why a show, supposedly from a peaceful lodge in the great white north, would have the annoying chainsaw track used excessively.
 The show is nothing short of comedic genius and good clean fun for all.",1380153600,,610,4.700934579439252

As a fan, I loved seeing this come out as a big set of all the episodes. I'm now in the process of watching all of them from the start to the end. It's been fun to see the progression of the characters, as well as the various skits that were developed, dropped, and added through it's long run.

For any other fan, make a mental note of the extras provided in this pack before buying the specials available separately. Most of them are included here. I almost bought two of them before I read the fine print.

(P.S. So sad to hear of the passing of the actor who played Mike Hammer. I loved it when they had him up for the word-guessing games. His guesses were hilarious. He played that part so well. He died too young.)",1371600000,9,945,4.268156424581005

I love to watch this after having a bad day at work and I forget how bad things are. I am very fond  comedy and this is one of the better ones out there. The only bad thing I could think of is I wish they had continued the show longer to have more to watch. This and keeping up appearances and of course mrs browns boys are some of the best things to watch when I am tired of listening to people complaining and all the terrible things that are on the news.

4460293,5,B004RAIZ8I,"My sister introduced me to the Red Green Show.  I was compelled to write her in humble thanks:

I don't know how I've missed this show all these years.  How many Nobel prizes has this guy got stacked up anyway?  All this time I've been looking for practical solutions to everyday problems-- and there's an entire wealth of them right here in one box!

I wonder if he's patented any of these ideas?  If not, throwing all ethics aside I could take a few of these puppies down to the patent office.  They'll probably gaze at me in wonder that no one has ever patented these ideas before.

I especially like the way he doesn't waste time running back and forth to the tool box to get a specific tool.  Like most common-sense handymen he simply uses the closest thing that'll get the job done-- a kitchen knife to open the paint can lid-- a hammer to loosen the cork on a wine bottle-- a screwdriver to open that stuck back door (as everyone knows, the wood frame can always be filled and repainted).

I was surprised to hear he was married.  Most men of this capability and skill can have his pick of any woman he wants and simply switches between supermodels every week.  Myself of course, I like to stick with one woman for life.  That way you don't have to break a new one in to basic emergency procedures when something goes wrong.

In my mind the Red Green show is one of the finest I've seen.  I was so impressed I wrote the Educational Channel and recommended they carry his show on prime time Friday night... but it may be too sophisticated for their audience.  After all, not everyone has the courage or foresight to remove the roof off their car to make way for a john boat hauler.  This is a special show for special men (or women, if they are so inclined)... and would not suit every person's taste.  Besides, not all of us have the wherewithall to come by those scarce scienctifically-advanced resources he uses in his experiments.

Thank you for introducing me to this wonderful show.  Next time you come over to visit, you may find something new and interesting when you open the front door.

No wonder this show was a big hit in Canada for 15 years and now we can all enjoy every episode here in the US. The set comes in a box that looks like a toolbox, each year in its own separate plastic DVD case with a well printed guide inside providing the all the episodes with each disk, professional all the way and not like a company who makes ""knock off"" DVDs and skimps on packaging. A must buy and although all the Red Green shows are available to view on You Tube, there is nothing better than having this DVD set for viewing on a home TV and well worth the money spent.

The rest of those episodes are horrible. If I were giving a score based on the show itself, I would take a star away based just on season 2. But since I base my score on the product, which is how reviews should be given on a site that sells these things, I am giving it a full 5-star score, as the product is amazing.",1358640000,,747,4.02013422818792

4460308,5,B004RAIZ8I,It is so rare to find some comedy that doesn't have nudity or rude language and that is what makes this show so priceless.,1358121600,10,122,4.125
4460309,5,B004RAIZ8I,Love it!  Couldn't buy just a few series...needed the whole enchilada.  It will take a long time to view all of it.,1357948800,,115,4.181818181818182
4460310,5,B004RAIZ8I,"I was not familiar with the show, but was looking for a gift and this was just perfect.  Everything that we were looking for and the price was much lower than buying everything individually.  Packaging was nice too.",1357948800,,215,4.631578947368421
4460318,4,B004RAIZ8I,This series is very easy to get into with no thought process involved.  Light humor for adults.  You have to think about why they ever tried some of these items.,1357603200,,161,4.333333333333333
4460319,5,B004RAIZ8I,"This is a great show and it is wonderful collection. The extra episodes, movies, and the behind-the-scenes is a great addition to all the laughs. There was a mislabeled disc in which one year the first and second set of episodes were flipped, but otherwise this is a great fun for anyone with a sense of humor.",1357257600,,310,4.456140350877193
4460320,3,B004RAIZ8I,"The show has some very good moments, some is more social commentary rather than entertainment. OK, but not as good as I had hoped.",1356998400,,130,4.458333333333333
4460321,5,B004RAIZ8I,"best thing since Monty Python, hard to believe this is Canadian comedy, love the series and this box set, the box is cool but the flip lid easily comes off",1356566400,5,155,4.2
4460322,5,B004RAIZ8I,"The Red Green Show is the ultimate redneck show. Red Green maintains that ANYTHING can be fixed with duct tape. Every show he comes up with the most outrageous, unbelievable inventions. And his advice to the parents of teenagers is so true, but he puts in it such a way that you can't help but laugh. this complete red green show was well worth the $99.99 I payed.",1356393600,7,364,4.367647058823529
4460323,5,B004RAIZ8I,"The biggest thing I'd like to give you is EXACTLY what's in this box as the description made me go ""huh?"" on some of the extras they include. There is a dvd case for each season containing 3 discs which covers 45 of the 50 discs. There's one dvd case that contains 5 specials dvd's. That is all that is contained in the box.

That being said, it's everything I've wanted which is every episode of the Red Green show as well as many of their specials DVD's. The only remaining video items left for a complete collection would be Duct Tape Forever, Wit and Wisdom, and We Can't Help it We're Men. Amazon had by far the cheapest price on this collection and I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again. If you love Red Green, this is the set to buy",1355529600,51,737,4.190140845070423
4460324,5,B004RAIZ8I,I continue to marvel at the crackpot creativity of this show.  Incredible that they kept it fresh for 15 seasons.,1351382400,,113,4.65
4460325,5,B004RAIZ8I,"Years of fruitcake entertainment from the creation of Steve Smith (Red Green) & Rick Green (Bill). See more use of duct tape the ""Handy Man's Secret Weapon"" ""Spare the duck tape-spoil the job."" Hear the phrase ""If women don't find ya handsome, they should at least find you handy"" so often you'll be repeating it. Red can't explain nephew Harold (Pat McKenna) except ""Uncles can't be choosers."" Red actually once told Harold, ""Speaking of misconceptions, of which you are one.""

Red Green, at some point in the set, is similar to other comedy stars. He resembles Red Skelton's commonness and innocent thinking. He resembles Tim Conway with off-beat gags, almost becoming believable. He's like Lucille Ball, Queen of American Comedy, a steady normal expression regardless of event preposterousness. He's Groucho Marx through smile-free one-liners. Green is Canada's Tim-The-Tool-Man-Allen. As straight faced, solemn through gags as Bob Newhart. Dare we compare to Bullwinkle the Moose?

This set is the zany hilarious dull-witted back-woods red-neck show that continued for 1 1/2 decades and accumulated a cult-like following equal to many rock stars. It's a great `Man-Gift'. Women with a piqued sense of humor will find this show engaging. LOL comedy. ""Red Green Comedy Pinnacle Perfection"" of imagination and dummm-ness, classic craziness, Canadian calamity...Possum Do-Do.

Closed Captioning is available, sometimes helpful when you are laughing too hard and loud to hear the audio. It's a large price but almost enough episodes (300) to last one-a-day for a year, taking Sunday off to rest your laugh muscles.
Released earlier but still also available in smaller sets. See those listings for my reviews that list episode titles.",1345593600,44,1732,5.360294117647059

4460327,5,B004RAIZ8I,"The Red Green show contains a wide range of humor that are all very clever. The best are the shows that contain ""Adventures with Bill"" and listen carefully to the songs and conversations as they contain some zingers",1328400000,2,215,4.684210526315789

8438836,5,B004RAIZ8I,My grandparents introduced me to The Red Green Show when I was about 6 years old. That would mean I started watching around season 6.  I was hooked and became a regular viewer. PBS stopped airing the show shortly after the series ended in 2005. I'm very grateful the series is on DVD. It's interesting to see how primitive it started out in the first 3 seasons. It really takes off at season 4 and becomes the show I remember watching.,1507939200,,435,4.37037037037037
