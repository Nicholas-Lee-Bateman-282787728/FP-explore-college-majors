Kim is phenomenal (as always) as a troubled detective and he really proves how great an actor he is with this role.  This movie, and another one from his earlier works: ""Blind Fear,"" show what I've been saying all along about Kim - he's leading man material.  He's too talented to shove into the background.  I'd love to see him do more films in a leading role, he's worth every penny!",1496620800,,637,4.258333333333334
8307670,4,B001H29EV6,"This movie is the follow-up to Trail of a Serial Killer which stars Michael Madsen and Chris Penn. I recently watched that movie followed by this one.  I'm glad I did as it hooked things nicely together.  You can watch Part II without having seen Part I but I think you miss out a little.

Steve Serrano (Kim Coates) plays a detective who is a lead investigator in solving murders that he has committed. This makes for an interesting twist as he struggles with the 'ghosts' that come from doing these deeds. He meets a psychiatrist who has her own demons.  The two of them hook-up and things go out of sorts from there.

The mental states of the lead characters makes for an interesting film as they delve in deeper and try to rescue each other in their own ways.  Both main charcters are plagued with tragic events from the past which contributes to their present situations.

This is by far one of Kim Coates' best performances.  He is so believable and awkward with his character.  You're not sure what to make of this character throughout the whole movie.  At times you hate him and other times you feel sorry for him. You have to pay attention for sure when he starts to reveal his past.  Chills down your spine!

If you are looking for a thriller this is a good one.

NOTE: There is a packaging issue.  Packaging will say it is Part 2 but the DVD will play Part 1 (the Chris Penn version).  If you plan on buying this movie, if possible check with the seller that the DVD really does play Part 2 (Kim Coates version).  The only way to know for sure is to play the DVD as Kim Coates will appear on the menu.",1365206400,3,1612,4.305647840531561
