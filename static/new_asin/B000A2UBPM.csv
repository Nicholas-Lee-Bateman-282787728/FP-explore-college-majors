2351797,3,B000A2UBPM,"Cho is great in her stand up routine. There are some really funny moments, and great satire on politics, society and life. Worth a watch. Just keep your mind open.",1132617600,,163,4.466666666666667
2351798,2,B000A2UBPM,"For all its controversy/political relevance/stereotype-challenging/what have you, ""Assassin"" just isn't very funny. It has its moments (""Matthew 4:17 - Shut the f*ck up"" is a winner), but her style is so overbearingly political that it more often than not just seems preachy. Throughout the sets, she alternates between her normal voice and that of a sassy black woman, the only purpose of which is to evoke nervous laughter. Even when she's doing a good joke, it takes about 5 minutes to tell, as she is either waiting for applause or spelling out her material in a condescendingly slow fashion. The funniest parts have nothing whatever to do with the larger political message, leaving one with the feeling that she'd do splendidly with less politically motivated material. We get it - she's Asian, gay, and angry. You won't come away with much more insight than that. For wittier, more playful, and equally political satire, check out Eddie Izzard.",1132444800,5,950,5.057324840764331
2351799,5,B000A2UBPM,"i love the fact that margaret cho loves to fight.  she fights for what she believes in and she is not afraid to back down from the majority.  i think that is her greatest accomplishment, her ability to vocalize for those who are oppressed and speaking out against those that do the oppressing.  all of her dvds tackle similar rants but each one still delivers on the laughs.  she has great imagination and charisma.  i love that she has the audacity and the courage to speak out against the president and all of the awful right wing people.  i really got a kick when she said that on the night of the presidential election, she pointed out that as the states became colored that there was a color coded map to where all the stupid people are.  another great snippet came when she performed for all the republican hotel owners and she would not get off the stage.  she is an inspiration to me and so many others, i wish that everyone she represents could be like her and really make a change, then everything would be great.  the bruce daniels intro is worth watching as well.  the real gem in the extras is the short documentary invisible son.  i almost started crying.  the dvd is great and on par with all the other cho videoes.  i wish i could see her live again it would be awesome.  but for right now i will settle for knock out dvds.  thanks margaret",1132358400,7,1356,4.346613545816733
2351800,5,B000A2UBPM,"I have watched and listened to Margaret Cho over the years and found her brand of humor funny throughout. This time around, however, I find she has successfully migrated herself into that elite group of social humorists who are able to comment on our social status as a country and our politics, and do so with blazing strikes that are poignant, on-the-mark AND funny. Margaret has changed, and with this change comes a broadening of her boldness. She has taken the torch from the likes of Lenny Bruce, and she holds no punches back when she speaks her mind, be it about the rights of individuals or the brazen BS of our some of our right-wing politicians. Ms. Cho may be the one that she wants, she might be notorious, she could lead a revolution, but frankly, she IS one politically savvy comic assassin and this show is her best yet.",1131926400,10,836,4.543046357615894
2351801,5,B000A2UBPM,"I have been a solid, die hard fan of Margaet Cho since I first saw a stand up routine of her on Comedy Central several years back.  Since then, I have listened to every major release she has produced and have not been disappointed with any of them.  I have read many reviews of unsatisfied customers and most of them are similar in their roots.  They believe that she's too over the top.  I guess they have forgotten that in history; some of the most powerful female voices have been women whose work is loud, controversial, and looks taboo subjects right in the face.  Margaret's work is very confessional in every aspect much like the work of the poet Anne Sexton whose work spanned subjects such as incest, masturbation, sexuality, and sexism.  How about Sylvia Plath; whose work dealt with suicide, sexism, infedility, and depression.  It is my opinion that people of this generation have forgotten that there is in fact a point behind pushing boundaries; something that Cho does endlessly in her work.  Like she stated in Revolution, a previous routine, ""The function of art is to comment on culture"".  Perhaps those who claim her as being too over the top are those who simply don't appreciate art and its function in society, and moreover, don't respect successful women who are not nice about it, something she says verbatim in The Assasin.

  In the Assasin, Cho packs a hard punch aimed at the right wing.  When the unemployment rate is rising to unprescedented levels, the deficit has done way more than skyrocket, and we are fighting a war which is beginning to resemble Vietnam; how can somebody not be pissed off at the President and the Republican Party who is chiefly in charge of this country for the time being?  Margaret addresses the flaws in government and society ferociously in Assasin and, as she always does, works to empower the underdogs (minorities); women, gays and lesbians in particular.  How can somnebody not like a comedian who says ""You know Laura Bush's p**** tastes like Lysol"".  Maybe that's just me.",1130889600,13,2038,4.78
2351802,5,B000A2UBPM,"Shameless plug alert! For all of you that view this DVD, check out ""Ode to Margaret Cho"" in the special features section, it's a short film starring my whole family ! hehehe",1130457600,6,173,4.4375
2351803,5,B000A2UBPM,Margaret is KILLER!! SO real! SO RIGHT! DAMG I wish most people looked at this world in more of a light that she does. Just being open minded and remaining at peace. I LOVE MARGARET,1129680000,7,181,4.2
2351804,1,B000A2UBPM,"They tried to force Cho down our throats about 10 years ago. Yeah, that worked. In my opinion she is flat out just not funny. Period. If I have to see her doing another impression of her mother (the squinting of the eyes and screaming pigeon English into the microphone) I cannot take it. Now her act seems to be her just rambling on about herself, not only is her current act not engaging it would be torture if I was actually with her one on one and had to listen to this crap. I think she is basically for the hardcore left crowd now. Other comics of course have had acts that had real overt points of view from the left like Bill Hicks except he was FUNNY.",1126828800,12,660,4.124031007751938
2351805,5,B000A2UBPM,"A lot of people are being critical about Margaret ""turning"" political nowadays, which is ridiculous because all she does is speak about her life and her experience, and everyone is more political these days.  If she has anything interesting to say about politics, than by all means she should include it in her act.  That said, here's my review-

She is much more connected with the audience here than with Revolution, which I'm sure a lot of people will be happy with, even though I thought she was great before.  Most of her new writing is 100% political in nature here, and scathingly funny.  Gay marriage, the moron in the oval office, the flavor of Laura Bushes' coochie, the pope's decidedly homosexual lifestyle- are just a fraction of the perceptive and hilarious material seen in this film.  You pretty much know what to expect, which is something creative and original.",1126224000,37,879,4.826666666666667
2351806,1,B000A2UBPM,"Margaret Cho USED to be so funny that you'd gag on your own laughter. She seems to have forgotten that she's a comedian. I don't know if I'd call if social or political soapboxing... I didn't laugh once. Even the folks who paid to see her show in person aren't laughing. They clap in agreement with her views. The crazy thing is that she ^believes^ that she is being edgy and original. She's just boring..... I miss the old comedian, Margaret Cho - the entertainer.",1213142400,3,465,4.482352941176471
2351807,4,B000A2UBPM,"She is like a ray of hope in the dark discriminative world. When I watch Margaret Cho I get the courage to be what i want to be.

I love you Margaret and I hope you keep bringing the light into our lives.",1209254400,,204,3.744186046511628
2351808,1,B000A2UBPM,"Me and my girlfriend are both big fan's of Margret Cho, so we were thrilled to get the chance to see this routine live.  Three or four drinks later and this was still an abomination to humor that does none of her earlier work justice.  If you want a political sermon, watch this DvD.  You will learn such interesting tidbits like Bush is a stupid jerk... for an hour.

Look, it isn't that I disagree with the political message.  I too think that Bush is an idiot, that gay marriage should be legal, and pretty much everything else that she advocates for.  The issue is that I don't watch Margret Cho to have someone parrot back my beliefs.  It isn't like she is some great left wing philosopher who will provide new deep insight into liberal ideology.  Margret Cho is a comedian that I watch to laugh... and laughing is the last thing you are going to do while watching this.  Occasionally you might chuckle, but how many bad Bush is dumb jokes can you take before you get bored?

If you want to laugh, buy Margret Cho's old DvD, ""I'm the one that I want"".  You will laugh until you cry, and then laugh some more as she tells side splitting stories about sex, traveling, her family and her friends.  If you want a political sermon and a few dozen Bush is dumb jokes that will be lucky to get you to chuckle once or twice, order this DvD.",1177113600,7,1337,4.304
2351809,5,B000A2UBPM,"I do not understand how any fan of Margaret would say that she was being too crass in this movie.  It doesn't make sense.  Margaret Cho has always been crass.

Granted she is political in this stand up.  But considering that since W has been in office, it has been nothing but political talk from ALL comedians; she is not alone.  She has always expressed her opinions, which went against the mainstream.  (And considering that she has a mostly gay audience, her views kind of makes sense.)

If you are a true Margaret fan, do not believe those who give the one star.  Crank the mother up and laugh your --- off.",1166400000,2,612,4.401785714285714
2351810,5,B000A2UBPM,"Since when is Margaret Cho not political?!?!?!  She is one person who hasn't run the to the right now that this country is getting scary conservative.  Everyone says that comedy comes from pain, and with the recent assault on gays, lesbians, women, people of color, religions that don't fit into the right's idea of christianity, feminists, anti-war activists, and everyone else who bothers to use the space between their ears to think, there is a whole lotta pain going on for many of us.  Margaret just puts a humorous face on it.

She is amazing to see in person but this is the next best thing.  My mom found much of this funny and there is a world of difference in our political value system.

PS--  Making fun of the Shrub (bush) never gets old, just for the record.",1157760000,3,772,4.510791366906475
2351811,3,B000A2UBPM,"I wouldn't say this was Margaret Cho at her best.  I enjoyed ""I'm the One That I Want"" and ""Notorious C.H.O."" more.  This DVD focuses a lot more on issues in the media and with the government.  There was less involving herself.",1154563200,,227,4.357142857142857

2351813,1,B000A2UBPM,"The problem with this dvd is it is just not entertaining.  Margaret goes on a political rant rather than performing true comedy.  Suffice to say she is anti-bush. She can substitute the word Bush for Clinton, It still won't be funny.  Margaret forgets she is a comedian.  She should not use the stage as her political forum regardless of either to the right of left of political views.  Perform comedy, not name calling.  I am just flat out bored watching this DVD.  Not recommended.",1151971200,4,483,4.678571428571429
2351814,4,B000A2UBPM,"This installment of Margaret Cho's comedy outting was pretty good. It's a step up from her last comedy movie, Revolution, but still doesn't live up to her first two.

It starts off pretty slow, but once she starts kicking in heavy on her political jokes, you'll start enjoying it. She's very critical of the administration in her jokes, but does it in a way that's very truthful and not too malicious.",1149379200,2,401,4.647887323943662
2351815,2,B000A2UBPM,"Why this show was so disappointing in comparison to her earlier work.

1. Her excruciating comic timing. Margaret makes bad jokes and not-so-funny faces, and when the audience doesn't go for it, she continues, hoping for the eventual applause. She gets it, all right--but it's more of a get-on-with-it clapping.

2. The Preaching to the Choir factor. I'll admit it: I hate George W. Bush. I hate the war in Iraq. I hate the assault on women's rights that's happening in our country. But to base your ENTIRE ""comic"" routine on it is stretching it a bit. And let's face it--most people in audiences are already going to agree with her, so it's not exactly like she's ""getting the word out there"" or anything. This level of political material made sense for her shorter ""State of Emergency"" Tour, which went around the country to various swing states (and kicked off at Harlem's Appollo Theater, which I saw--and which was far better than this DVD and should've been released in its place), but c'mon. Make us laugh, Margaret! WE KNOW BUSH SUCKS!!!!

3. All the little voices. I'm so tired of Margaret Cho's queeny-drag-queen-esque gay-male impersonations. They're not funny, they're not getting any reaction from the audience, and they should be phased out. And as a gay twentysomething male who does NOT talk like an aging, sassy queen, I can't help but feel a little alienated. It's all getting very tired.

I miss her INTELLIGENT humor. I miss the self-deprecation. I miss the humbleness, where she didn't have to precede her comedy specials with 10-minute-long ""I love Margaret Cho""-fests from fans who do HOOOORIBLE impersonations of her earlier, funnier days' routines.

Basically, there were a few laughs in this DVD, but not nearly enough to justify buying it. This is the definition of a rental.",1146787200,14,1802,4.9144736842105265
2351816,2,B000A2UBPM,This DVD was not as good as her previous ones. This one was boring not funny at all.,1144713600,4,84,3.7222222222222223
2351817,1,B000A2UBPM,"Before I finally turned it off. I had seen and liked her first thing years ago, so when my gf (a big Cho fan) picked this out I was like ""okay"".

We watched for about 15 minutes, waiting to laugh or even be slightly amused. No dice. We fast-forwarded; more of the same.

The whole show is apparently joke-free and consists of a shrill left-wing political screed using 'newsworthy' events from 2003-2004, interspersed with long silences and Cho making weird faces or staring dully off into space. It was sort of like being forced to watch Bill O'Reilly of Fox News fame, only if you put him in drag and made him into an anarcho-communist somehow.

Very annoyingly dull, boring, and pointless. Save your time and money by staying far far away from this! (Note - other anarcho-communists may find the show minutely entertaining, but would probably have a lot more fun by just turning on the news and righteously yelling at the stupidity).",1143244800,3,935,4.689024390243903
2351818,3,B000A2UBPM,"I was introduced to the joy of Cho last year and having shipped all of her previous titles over from the United States, I was moist at the prospect of her latest offering.

She never fails to garner a screaming reaction to everything she says and in her previous shows this has been based solidly around a vibrant sex life filled with shocking social faux-pas'. Her ability to mix this with poignant stories from her father-induced eating disorder and raging war-cries against those who discriminate against minorities has always made her a valid and credible mouth piece for the issues that effect our generation. An Oprah for the sexually experimental masses, if you will.

And this is where Assassin starts to flail. Her fundamental message of tolerance and self belief is still there but the delivery has changed.

She quotes more from the various indiscretions of Dubbya than she does her own life. Everyone is taking pot-shots at the Clown and as a result I would not expect Miss Cho to emulate tired material. Her dirty slant on proceedings is still there and it is a joy to see these Gems flow from her filthy mouth. But these moments of 'Classic Cho' are too sparse for my liking.

Definetely worth buying if you are a fan: her transition throughout the 3 DVD's is amazing.

But for someone expecting the Cho of old, this is not true-to-form Margaret. Where did she go????",1142553600,3,1381,4.713692946058091
2351819,5,B000A2UBPM,"Although Margaret's first tour/DVD always holds a place in my heart, Assassin is by far an equivalent accomplishment.  It can be a bit political to some people; so if you're a right winged conservative you might not respect her talent.  There is not hesitance in her honesty, making her bluntness rise far above inappropriate.  This is why we love Margaret.  She gives no resistance to truth.  Assassin is a guaranteed, jaw-dropping laugh.  You'll most likely find yourself the next day trying to imitate her sarcastic impressions of society.  There's always an excuse to quote Margaret Cho at least once in your day.",1142294400,2,617,4.990196078431373
2351820,1,B000A2UBPM,"Margaret Cho has been one of my faves for quite awhile. I was telling my wife that if she stopped doing impressions of her mom that she would be done, and it happened. Instead of being funny and poking fun at the right wing tactfully, she just comes off with vulgar language. Many times she is waiting for the audience to get what she thinks is funny. She pauses and nervously goes into her next tirade. I think gays are cool. I am not much into politics, but this was really, really bad. It is something if I can't even sit through 30 minutes of it. If I could have given a more negative score I would have. Any fans of her old material will be VERY dissapointed. Do not buy or rent this garbage. Dave Chapelle gets more laughs in 3 seconds than I did watching 30 minutes of this. It is one thing to be vulgar but funny. She was just vulgar. He career is plummeting.",1140652800,4,867,4.166666666666667
2351821,3,B000A2UBPM,"She's ""OUTRAGEOUS!""  I mean, ""she'll say ANYTHING!""  That's what ga-ga fans tell the camera in the intro to this uneven concert video.  But it's also the reason why this video is uneven.  Once you've said that a certain part of Laura Bush probably tastes like Lysol, where do you go from there?  Yes, the comment is ""outrageous,"" but it doesn't provoke much thought beyond, ""Oh, my God, she really said that!""  So, yes, you will laugh -- a lot, actually -- but you won't necessarily feel satisfied or enlightened or as though you've been on a journey.  And there are some misfires, like Cho making fun of how Terry Schiavo looked in a coma.  The audience seems to be waiting for that insensitive bit to be over.  But Cho drags it out, hoping for a payoff that ain't coming.  The really good news is an extended piece about Cho's mother toward the end.  Good impersonation, good character development, sharp observations about aging parents, and good laughs -- it all comes together.  Otherwise, Cho would do well to remember that neither man nor woman lives by outrage alone.",1139270400,,1075,4.689839572192513
2351822,1,B000A2UBPM,"I've enjoyed much of Cho's past work, but this time around nothing was funny. Even she didn't seem to be enjoying the material on this outing. She just keeps feeding the audience the same tired routine (hate Bush love us) and the audience just goes insane.

It's just not entertaining.",1137283200,4,285,4.7
2351823,5,B000A2UBPM,"Once again Margaret Cho's showes that she is a performer in the mold of Richard Pryor.

She manages to make people love her or hate her.  Proof in the amount of negative ""reviews"" from right wingers.

Margaret Cho is here to stay.  Deal with it!!",1136419200,4,246,4.4
2351824,2,B000A2UBPM,"...because it mainly sticks to its own, preaching to the converted in a handful of major urban areas instead going out into the heartland and interacting with the large majority of the population---its appeal only becomes narrower and narrower.

Ditto with Margaret Cho, I'm sorry to say.  I loved her first DVD concert, ""I'm The One I Want""---the material was fresh and daring for the most part, despite the occasional maudlin detour into pop-psychology bathos (""poor me, they told me I was fat!"").

However with each new DVD, Margaret seems to be mainly recycling the same old punchlines and hooks, and most worrisome of all, seemingly ALWAYS TO THE SAME ULTRA-FRIENDLY HOME AUDIENCE!!!

It reminds me a bit of GW Bush of all people---all of his appearances are carefully planned with the audience carefully prescreened and limited to enthusiastic Republican supporters.  The result being that Bush often appears to live inside a bubble and makes sense only to himself and his endless sea of stooges and ardent fans.

There is a annoying clubbiness about Cho's whole approach, which you can see in the first 5-10 minutes of these DVDs, when the camera gets in the face of her adoring fans standing in line, all of them gushing about how absolutely cool and bad-@ss Margaret is...ick!  So much narcissistic self-congratulation, and it all stinks of some vague desperation: why would she NEED to showcase all that validation at the beginning of her DVDs?  Does she feel that the viewer needs to be told how GREAT she is (or at least how great her fans think she is) before they watch her performance?  Or is it her way of fostering a sense of commonality and identity (see ""clubbishness"") in her fan base?

This is all such a shame, because it's obvious that Cho is blessed with immense comedic talent even when she's just phoning it in like she does here.

Margaret: why not tape a concert before an audience in oh, Topeka Kansas instead of your usual San Francisco or NYC fan base?  I'll bet you COULD make those Kansans laugh too if you really wanted.",1136332800,6,2054,4.771186440677966
2351825,2,B000A2UBPM,"This performance is not as funny as her first 2 concert films, but it is an improvement on ""Revolution""*.  She looks the best - she appears healthy and her outfit is flattering (look Ma - no sweat stains!).  The only negative is that her routine is very topical, which may not preserve well over time.  Opening act Bruce Daniels (seen as a DVD extra) is pretty funny.

8072681,2,B000A2UBPM,"I really loved Margaret Cho's first two concert films - ""I'm the One I That I Want"" (2000) and ""Notorious C.H.O."" (2001).  She has always been a gifted storyteller, and some of her jokes about her family as well as her riffs on sex were hilarious.  Somewhere in between these two films and ""Margaret Cho: Assassin"" (2005), Cho became increasingly politically edged.  Her jokes now focus on lambasting conservatives and Christian religious groups.  I'm pretty open to any topic being the source of humor, but the jokes have to be well-written and original or else it can come across as petty.  Unfortunately, too much of her material in ""Assassin"" is stale - tired iterations of the same old Bush jokes.  Of course, ""Assassin"" was released in 2005, so some of the jokes may have been a bit fresher then.  However, even to this Cho fan, they haven't aged well.

A few jokes did score.  Her impression of Bjork is terrific, and she can still tell a raunchy joke skillfully.  Unfortunately, Cho is starting to come off a tad smug, even though I agree with most of her political beliefs.  Making her political beliefs and activities the focus of her act is a mistake, in my view; she verges on pandering to her audience at times, and it overshadows the jokes.  I'm curious to see how Cho in this age of Obama will change her act.  I'm still a fan, just a tad skeptical of whether I will enjoy her future work as much.",1240963200,,1412,4.533596837944664
8072682,2,B000A2UBPM,"I typically love Margaret Cho and her wicked sense of humor. Her edgy, sardonic, volatile way with words has always appealed to me. Unfortunatly, With Assassin, Cho has lost that charm. I actually sat down expecting to CRACK UP, but I found myself only chuckling a few times and one of the times was when Margaret famously imitated her mother-which is standard Cho. I agree with all of Margaret's political views and I find her opinions refreshing. I find myself feeling ostricized in my small-town community for having the views that I do, and it is incredibly soothing to find celebrities and people in the spotlight who can vocalize what I am always thinking. She vocalized everything....But, it was just too much for a comedy routine. I wanted to laugh more! If I was having a group discussion with Margaret, I would have appreciated her input and the views she expressed in this routine, but for a comedy routine it was lackluster.

Not really recommended unless you want to hear someone vent about Bush.",1218931200,2,1009,4.7988505747126435
