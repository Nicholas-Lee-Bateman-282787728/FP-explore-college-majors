2729731,2,B000MEYJHE,"""Lovewrecked"" establishes its premise pretty early on and then goes on and on and on and even at a shade over 80 minutes feels like it goes on forever. Bynes is appealing but she doesn't have a lot to work with here.",1193356800,2,216,4.166666666666667

2729736,5,B000MEYJHE,"FYI, the first two songs in the movie, ""Perfect Girl"" and ""Lonely Boy,"" sung by Jason Masters on stage, were written and produced by a band called Black Lab. The songs (sung by their singer, Paul Durham) can be heard on their album See the Sun. Two additional songs by the band, ""Broken Heart"" and ""Weightless"" (the slow song that plays over the scene in the cave after Ryan rescues Jenny in the rain) are also in the movie and can be found on their album Passion Leaves a Trace.

Watch it with the gang for everyone to have fun.

Its great entertainment watching the leagths Amanda Bynes goes to to keep him from finding out their only 2 miles from the hotel.

The extras are lacking on this dvd.

I think standard extras on all dvd releases should be min blooper reel and deleted scenes.

This movie was orignal set to be released in theaters in 2005 with a

pg-13 rating.

The distribution to theaters fell apart for some reason.

Then in 2007 it was recut to pg and released as a tv movie.

(USA abcfamily) It also aired on tv in Germany still pg ver

The pg 13 ver has never been released and is not avalable anywhere at the moment.

2729739,3,B000MEYJHE,"Jenny Taylor (Amanda Bynes) is a high school senior obsessed with Jason Masters (Chris Carmack).  She is convinced that if they could just spend some time together, Jason would realize they are soul mates and the two of them would fall in love.  The catch?  Jason is an internationally famous pop star, so there's no way that a nobody like Jenny would ever get to met him.

Looking to earn money for college, Jenny gets a summer job at a Caribbean resort with her best friend Ryan (Jonathan Bennett).  Unfortunately, her nemesis Alexis (Jamie-Lynn DiScala) also shows up.

The trio hasn't been there long before Jason shows up for a couple days off in the middle of his current tour.  Naturally, Jenny is ecstatic and does anything she can to catch his eye, including slip aboard the night cruise that Jason is taking.  When Jason accidentally falls overboard, Jenny dives in and saves him.  The two wind up stranded on an island.  Jenny immediately realizes this is her chance, and she intends to make the most of it, going to any lengths necessary to win her man.

Okay, I'll fess up.  I enjoy Amanda Bynes.  So I decided to give this made for TV movie a try.  Amanda is great in it.  The part of Jenny was written for her.  The rest of the cast is fine, but Amanda is the standout.

Unfortunately, the plot needed some work.  There were some twists in the final third that really came out of nowhere and made little to no sense.

On the whole, this is a light and fluffy way to waste a couple hours.  I recommend viewing it before you buy since it's probably not something you'll want to watch more then once.",1171411200,27,1612,4.455479452054795

2729765,3,B000MEYJHE,I thought this was OK for a single viewing.  It was not as good as the actors in it would indicate.  The story is pretty far fetched.  The dialog is ok but not really good.

2729766,4,B000MEYJHE,"Released in 2005, ""Love Wrecked"" stars Amanda Bynes playing a high school student who has a crush on a rock star (Chris Carmack). After getting a summer gig at a Caribbean resort she learns that her idol is visiting the island and, unexpectedly, ends up marooned with him on a deserted island. But is it really deserted? Jamie-Lynn Sigler plays her catty nemesis and Jonathan Bennett her guy pal who desires more than just friendship.

Amanda was 18 years-old during filming and has an undeniably cute face, but her body's not very curvy. Nevertheless, she easily carries the film with her fun-spirited charisma and likable disposition. The movie starts out great, but settles into moderately amusing by the second act. The paradisal Dominican Republic locales are a highlight.

The film runs 87 minutes.

I like some of Amanda Bynes' movies well enough (acknowledging that none of them are what I'd consider to be awesome), but this one had a somewhat odd resolution concerning the characters Jason Masters and Alexis Manetti. Alexis, clearly made out to be the primary antagonist of the story, gets exactly what she wants, whereas Jason seems to get comeuppance for simply being, well, simple. Doesn't seem a sufficient reason to vilify him toward the end.",1416268800,,531,4.835164835164835

2729804,1,B000MEYJHE,"Maybe I would feel differently if I were 8, but this movie is pure garbage. Before Amanda Bynes became just another trashy hollywood actress getting drunk and crashing cars and making statements about loving chocolate men...she was a good actress with some fun movies. She has also always looked normal in filns but here she looks too skinny woth tiny tooth pick legs. I have enjoyed everything else I have ever seen her in (and She's the Man itself is pretty ridiculous), but this is just a poor story with awkward moments that are supposed to be funny. A geeky guy has a crush on his best girl friend. He doesn't realize it until almost the end, but it's red flashing lights obvious where thus is going. She has a crush on a pop star who comes to stay at the resort they work at. She ends up following the pop star onto a boat, he falls off, she jumps in, a storm takes them to a nearby island. He hurts his ankle, they think they are shipwrecked...then she finds out they are on the other side of the island. Thus begins the awkward lies and scenes of her sneaking into town to buy groceries and pretend she picked fruit, caught fish, ground berries for makeup...it is all very awkward and unbelievable. He starts to fall in love with her, enter the second annoying twist. Her geeky friend duscovers her in town showering and agrees to help. The slutty, catty, empty headed nemesis of girl follows him and hatches a plan to pretend she is a stranded french model throwing herself at him and making other girl look bad. The girls fight, pop star professes his like for normal girl...and of course geek boy does the dramatic ""we belong together kiss"" out of nowhere. As the movie progresses it just gets more annoying and more awkward. It tries so hard to use Amanda's well known comedic timing and humor but falls flat every single time. I won't spoil it for you, but the ending is one of the most far-fetched, annoying, and just plain stupid I have ever seen. We see the cliched coupling hinted from scene one but everything else the ending wraps up with is...bizarre and very unhappy for everyone but the new cliche couple.
Skip this snoozer. Badly written straight to DVD movies for preteens are a dime a dozen, bit most of them will leave you empty and skeptical...not angry and disgusted. I seriously can't believe ANYONE would give this more than 2 stars.",1359158400,,2363,4.5233644859813085

Yes, at times it was funny and fun.  But.  At other times it was heavy handed, nasty, and worthy of a cringe or two in disbelief.  To suggest the plot was a little more than farfetched is putting it kindly.  It was an idiot idea that could have done with a little more consideration.  (It doesn't say much about a film that it was edited 3 times and released (and rereleased) after each edit...a year between each showing!  And still it couldn't rise above the silly premise.  This was no hit.)
Amanda Bynes is too strong a talent to waste her efforts on slipshod efforts like this.

Amanda Bynes ends up on a deserted island with the famous, rich, young, rock-star guy she adores; along with another girl who competes for the affections of the young man. The two girls sabotage each other in funny ways.

There is a lot of comedy at the resort before Amanda goes on the boat cruise that lands her on the deserted island. The rock-star has left an entourage of arrogant assistants, who have no money of their own, at the expensive resort. When the rock-star is deemed lost at sea; the tables turn on the arrogant entourage. Amanda has a nice guy friend, who loves her. There are several plot twists. It is a funny movie, and all quite plausible.

After saving him from drowning and pulling him to safety, Jenny finds a way to convince Jason that they are trapped on an island, all alone.(hoping that their relationship will progresses) One problem, he doesn't know they are just on the other end of the island, with only a small forest inbetween them and his freedom! Will Jenny's beautiful best friend Ryan(Jonathan Bennet) help hide her secret, even though he's been in love with her since he can remember?(Of course he will, they always do...)

So it seem weird that the Mean Girls guy can't seemed to get attention from Amanda. Jamie-Lynn Sigler plays a role in movie, but having the girl from Sopranos in the movie didn't seem to fit.
