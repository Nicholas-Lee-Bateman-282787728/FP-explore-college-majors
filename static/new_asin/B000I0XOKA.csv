THE AFFAIRS OF ANNABEL(1938) & POP ALWAYS PAYS(1940).

THE AFFAIRS OF ANNABELLE (1938) directed by Jack Stoloff.  Movie studio publicity man, played by Jack Oakie,  puts studio's top star, Annabel, played by Lucille Ball, into constantly ridiculous situations for publicity purposes. Finally the star revolts and the situations become even sillier than before. Lucy and Jack Oakie are very funny together in this fairly decent attempt at the start of a screwball comedy series. Pretty fair, occasionally funny.  With Lucille Ball, Jack Oakie, Ruth Donnelly, Bradley Paige. Fritz Field, Thurston Hall

POP ALWAYS PAYS  (1940) directed by Leslie Goodwins. Pop Hank Brewster, played by Leon Errol, promises his daughter's fiancee. Jeff Thompson, played by Dennis O'Keefe, that if he can save one thousand dollars he, Pop,  will personally  match that sum. The prospective son-in-law can't seem to save a penny but with that incentive he starts amassing a savings account in no time at all.  Soon Pop has to pay and thein lies the problem.  This funny film is almost a lesson in practical economics for folks long on itch but short on scratch.  Very good and quite entertaining. With Leon Errol, Dennis O'Keefe, Pamela Blake, Walter Catlett, Marjorie Gateson, Tom Kennedy.

This RKO Double Feature video tape is a pretty good comedy pairing.
I rate it Four and One Half Stars.",1284681600,,1443,5.093617021276596
