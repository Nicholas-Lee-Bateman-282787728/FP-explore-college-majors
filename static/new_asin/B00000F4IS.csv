1201838,5,B00000F4IS,"In the late 1970s KISS was at the absolute height of their popularity and KISS mania was running rampant. Their merchandising machine was sheer genius (until it got a bit out of hand later), which meant that we all wore KISS concert shirts, bought all their records, View-Master reels, comic books and anything else we could get our hands on.

So it seemed a logical idea for the band to capitalize on their success by starring in their own feature film. I, along with millions of other members of the KISS Army, sat transfixed on October 28, 1978, to watch the fabulous foursome for 96 minutes in KISS Meets the Phantom of the Park on NBC.

The plot was pretty simple: the band (starring as themselves) discovers a mad scientist amusement park owner's scheme to turn humans into cybernetic park attractions. The guys caught on when he kidnapped them and built evil KISS cyborg clones that he planned to use to enslave thousands of folks at a KISS concert, which coincidentally would take place at the very same park. But KISS isn't any ordinary band - they've got magical powers that they can summon with their ancient talismans, which they use to escape and foil the evil genius's plan. The climax of the film is a showdown between KISS and their evil robot counterparts.

Not unlike the band, the movie has a comic book feel, which makes complete sense since it was produced by Hanna-Barbera, the folks who gave the world The Jetsons and other cartoons. It was filmed at California's Magic Mountain amusement park and contains some cool footage of the band in concert and in action, with 'Shout it Out Loud,' 'Rock and Roll All Night,' and a great version of 'I Stole Your Love.' While it was a made-for-TV movie, the film actually did enjoy a theatrical release in Europe.

There's no question that all the members of KISS are great musicians and even greater showmen. But they sure can't act. Mostly level headed Paul Stanley gets the bulk of the lines, while Gene Simmons gets to growl and frighten people. Ace Frehley is for all intents and purposes incoherent with his heavy Brooklyn accent and penchant for making weird bird-like noises. And while we get to see and hear Peter Criss sing 'Beth' accompanied by acoustic guitar, we never get to hear him actually speak any lines. His voice was dubbed by someone else because he never bothered to show up after filming for relooping.

Amusing flaws aside, the film is a real trip if you're a KISS fan or if you like 70s nostalgia. There's nothing else like it.",1115164800,6,2516,4.657657657657658
1201839,3,B00000F4IS,"This movie was not handled well. When you think of a movie staring KISS, sure THATS a great idea, but it seems no one had the initiative to really put it together. It starts slow, and keeps going slow, untill you want to turn it off, and then...  there they are! KISS! That in itself is the most interesting part of the movie. If it were anyone else as the stars, it would not have made it onto the TV, let alone onto VHS. No one should blame KISS for this film failure. It just wasn't put together well. The plot was hazy, the jokes were off, and it kind of reminded me of watching an old batman movie while under the influence. Still, I will watch it again, and recomend that you do too, if you enjoy those old oudated movies with special effects from the 80's, that make something thats not supposed to be a comedy funny! I about laughed my a** off watching some of the goofy antics, and the androids that were so clearly men sticking thier heads through holes cut in tables. This is a film for die hard KISS fans that love the guys, and wanna have a good laugh. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE IF YOU DO NOT L*O*V*E KISS! It will make no sense, and will probably land you a visit to the shrink,

 KISS FOREVER!!!",1102032000,2,1206,4.145299145299146
1201840,4,B00000F4IS,"Well, being the consummate Kiss fan that I am and probably always will be, where do I begin with ""Kiss Meets The Phantom""? I guess I have to do it in a ""then & now"" sort of way, so here goes:

Halloween, 1978: Your humble reviewer, a then 13-year old pimply-faced youth is practically Super-Glued to his chair directly in front of the family TV waiting for his idols to come on. After what seemed like an eternity, the movie finally started and there they were...KISS!!! My parents sat behind me pretending not to care at the crazy rock & roll spectacle unfolding on the TV screen in front of their son's very impressionable eyes, but secretly wished that they could be watching an episode of ""Taxi"". But NOT THIS NIGHT...the TV belonged to ME and KISS!!! At the time, I couldn't get enough of it...this movie was like the beginning and ending of it all, and two hours later, I thought I'd just witnessed the greatest movie ever made and that KISS were the ultimate superheroes.

Almost Halloween, 2004: Your humble reviewer, a now pock-marked, wrinkled, bloated mass of horse flesh staring age 40 directly in the face is practically Super-Glued in front of his computer struggling to remember exactly what he'd witnessed some 26 years ago (among other things...) Yes, I have to agree with the masses that in hindsight, this movie is very campy, unintentionally hilarious and corny, but man, what a lot of FUN!! I think I have more fun watching it now than I did back then!

I think even a great actor like Anthony Zerbe knew what he was getting himself into at the time, but he showed just how versatile and professional he is and played the part to the hilt; he made you believe that his character really was demented and evil! Kiss on the other hand, well...um...let's just say they were who and what they were and leave it at that.

But let's not forget the immortal ""Chopper"" and his girlfriend in the film...what a wonderful biker trash couple they were!",1098316800,2,1960,4.591428571428572
1201841,5,B00000F4IS,"I saw this movie on TV once, Way Back When. I didn't understand it then, and I still don't now, but one thing's for sure; this movie *must* be released on DVD! It's a cult classic, right up there with ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" in its' (unintentional) badness. KISS fans, unite; petition the band to get this movie released on Special Edition DVD--featuring a ""making of"" documentary, of course!!! 'Nuff said.",1086048000,17,408,4.680555555555555
1201842,2,B00000F4IS,"There is only about 30 minutes worth of actual KISS members in the film, but there is some outstanding live in-concert film from the show at Magic Mountain in the spring of 1978.  Some of the show is the actual live recording, not dubbed music.  This is the made for TV movie that came out on Halloween of 1978.
I believe this video is out of print, so grab it if you can find it somewhere.  A must for any diehard KISS fan.",1076716800,2,424,4.0843373493975905
1201843,5,B00000F4IS,"I think it helps if you're a KISS fan to enjoy this movie as much as I do, but I loaned it to a friend who was never into them at all and it became a cult favorite of his which he quotes to this day.  This 1978 masterpiece was directed by Gordon Hessler who did tv shows like Hawaii 5-0, Kung Fu, and Wonder Woman and I think the influence is apparent.  Also, the film is produced by Hanna-Barbera (as in Yogi Bear & the Flintstones) and that influence is extremely present!
The plot! involves KISS playing live at Magic Mountain where there is lots of cool things going on like a Peter Criss look a like contest!  Anthony Zerbe (Omega Man, First Deadly Sin) plays the mentally unstable Abner Devereaux (the Phantom), creator of all the rides at the park and also the machanical apes.  Anyway, he starts losing it when some biker dorks mess with his ride so he sends them to his haunted house to get sucked down these big pipes and....wo!  My brain stings...hang on.  Ok, so Abner ends up losing his job and he totally flips out and creates a little microchip thing that fits behind the ear and turns whoever is wearing it into a mindless robot.  He's also jealous of KISS, not to mention hates their music so he creates a duplicate KISS to destroy the original KISS.  Whew!
Watching KISS try to act is endless fun.  Gene has a few lines like ""Starchild!"" and other times just opens his mouth and a prerecorded animal growl comes out!  Paul says stuff like ""Easy Catman, these guys are serious."" and shoots a laser beam out his eye so he can listen to what people are saying far away.  Ace says ""Ack"" and can teleport the whole band out of sticky situations (like when be attacked by samurais or cat people in disco suits, stuff like that.).  I never found out what Peter's power was but I know his real voice isn't in the film, its a famous cartoon voice like Aquaman or something.  He does have some great lines like ""without them we'd be ordinary human beings."" This is in response to a question about their talisman, which are these little glowing objects they keep in a little briefcase in their apartment.  They get their powers from these things you see.  Anyway lots of KISS tunes and scenes that are pricelessly cheesy and unintentionally (I think) hilarious.  Like when the cops go to question KISS about a Gene look alike bashing up property in the park and all 4 of them are sitting on high lifeguard stools at their pool dressed in their normal black leather and also silver hooded robes sweating their butts off!  This scene always gets me.  ""Rock and rollers don't bathe.""
I found this at a dept. store for cheap on VHS and now I wish I would've bought more copies because it's very out of print.  I hope it comes to DVD someday but KISS aren't very proud of it so they probably want it to be buried.  However, since KISS will usually sell anything for a buck including a big coffin with their autographs on it, maybe their greed will make them put this timeless cheezeball from 1978 on special edition DVD with interviews about why they hate it!  I love this movie!  ""Rip & Destroy!""",1062288000,33,3099,4.409490333919156
1201844,5,B00000F4IS,"Oh where do we begin with this? KISS was at the height of their popularity in the late 70's when this came out. Star Wars and KISS was all that kids my age cared about. KISS was on lunchboxes, comic books, bubblegum cards, toy guitars, action figures, etc etc etc. Phantom of the Park was a made for TV movie that was played on network television one time. On Halloween night, 1978. Well being 7 years old and a huge KISS fan I stayed home from trick or treating to see my heros...P>This movie is so goofy, that the band itself is too embarrassed to mention it in interviews... The acting is terrible, Ace and Peter have no interest in this abortion of a film (and with good reason). Paul hams up every line he has and basicly acts like a jive turkey with miscues and untimely lines. We see the things to come too of Gene's brief 80's acting career.
The stuntmen made to be KISS are pathetic, Gene's double is a 300 pound guy going up on a wire. Paul's double is complete with double chins, Ace's double is a kungfu funky black dude, and Peter's is about 40 years old.
The special effects are sad, the plot is ridiculous, and the one liners fall flat... In the entire KISStory, this is the 'dark, sad, what the heck were we thinking' chapter.
All in all a great movie to watch when you think your own life is pathetic...",1040601600,5,1320,4.284
1201845,5,B00000F4IS,I don't know where that dude think he saying about camp.  Funny?  There was nothing funny about this flick.  It the only time on tape that Gene Simmons real voice gets captured on the tape!  That's what he sound like!  It also shows off Aces sense of humor and Paul is a good actor.  I was nervous when the robots said rip and destroy!  Don't worry.  Kiss saves the day and plays rock and roll all nite.  If you never heard Kiss play that song there is your chance they rock on it!,1040515200,2,481,4.086021505376344
1201846,3,B00000F4IS,"This was a ""made for TV"" movie from the good old days before Kiss took off their makeup. It is great fun if you enjoy mystery science theatre 3000. Anthony Zerbe is a wonderfully smarmy mad scientist, and of course, the boys in the band are their usual comic book selves. If done up in comic book format, this would have been perfect! It was not meant to be quite this funny, but it is a riot if you like laughing at really campy cinema!",1014508800,3,437,4.152941176470589
1201961,5,B00000F4IS,"Great movie for any KISS fan. Got it for my husband who first saw it on tv when he was a kid; he was really happy when he got it. The picture quality is kinda grainy, but what can you expect for a movie made for tv almost 40 years ago...",1436659200,,237,3.6666666666666665

1201963,5,B00000F4IS,"I forgot the story plot, I saw it sooo long ago. It was funny!",1429228800,,62,3.5
1201964,3,B00000F4IS,"""Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park"" is made up of 75% schlock and 25% fun. It's pretty obvious that this movie was never intended as a masterpiece, but even if you're just watching it for kicks, prepare to be strung along for the duration. Kiss fans won't be bothered by the fact that the band can't act, but they might be disappointed when they find that TOO much footage has been wasted on: a) a random girl searching for her boyfriend; and b) Anthony Zerbe, who makes a very dull mad scientist.

The director may have been absent on the days of filming and the scriptwriters may have been hard-pressed for ideas, but the final product could have been much worse. After all, Paul, Gene, Ace, and Peter could have been played by Rob Reiner, Iggy Pop, Erik Estrada, and Joey Ramone. If for nothing else, watch it for the best bits: the goofy antics of the band inside the Chamber of Horrors, Gene storming through the park grounds like a reincarnation of Godzilla, and the band fighting off a pack of white dog-monkey-men robots. Kiss songs play in the background and later on, the band performs some of their classic tunes on stage for a crowd of hysterical teenage fans. Kiss even performs their token ballad, ""Beth"" while that random girl (Melissa) continues to pine for her boyfriend.

I imagine that the outtakes for this movie would have been far more entertaining than the final product. A worse scriptwriter with a better imagination would have made it more amusing. Before you watch ""Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park"", just make sure the fast-forward function on your movie-playing device is in optimum working condition.

The u.s. version of course, and An Australian version called ""Attack Of The Phantoms"", which includes Music from the solo albums that Kiss released in 1978. Cheezy? Yes, no doubt, but if you remember your childhood, and are a Kiss fan, then pick this up(It's on Kissology released in 2007). you don't have to pay the asking price for this. Still hard to believe.

When I do, I always look forward to hearing the final song, Rock and Roll All Night. I suppose that is what caused me to watch their movie and I loved it from beginning to end. I suppose I taped it when it played on TV because I did not purchase it. I did purchase a DVD recorder so I do have it on DVD. Not the best quality as it was an old VHS tape I recorded it on, but it is still worth watching. Imagine my surprise when I read on Wikipedia the group hated the film and how it portrayed them more as clowns than superheroes. That was not my impression as I saw four guys really connected to each other, each using his own specialized power to help Melinda find her boyfriend. Turns out he had been put under a spell by a mad scientist to steal the Kiss talismans to transmit their powers to the clones created to take their places. Perhaps a bit corny and childish, but I still like watching it, especially in the end when the real Kiss, having destroyed their clones, performs Rock and Roll All Night to the amusement park audience. Now, there was something else I learned from Wikipedia and that is according to them the idea the group's name KISS stands for Knights in Satan's Service, and that the name is only in caps because that is how it appears in their logo, but the group's name is really what it spells out -- Kiss. I was not surprised that one of those who inspired them was another big favorite of mine, Alice Cooper.

1202164,2,B00000F4IS,"Yes once you actually have one of these DVD's in hand you realize it's a bootleg and a lacking one to boot! (pun intended).
Not sure what source was used to create the DVD but it is grainy, fuzzy, and sub-standard in all respects.
Gene Simmons was instrumental in getting this DVD release removed from shelves as it was an unauthorized product.
But is not impossible to find here and on ebay.

If you want to view the TV version of this film, the way you remember it from your youth the only true quality way is on Laserdisc.
Thats right! the official Laserdisc release is the best of the best offer at this time to see the film in all it's cheesy glory.
It's not picture/audio perfect or a 1080p upscaled heavenly beauty but it's top notch, easily knocking out both the official Hanna Barbera/World Vision & Goodtimes VHS releases and this bootleg DVD offered here. Cheesy DVD version is just a basic Laserdisc transfer without any clean-up, enhancement or bump up to HD.

The audio on the Laserdisc is the same TV mono soundtrack but has been preserved in good quality so that it sounds like it should from 1978. The picture is the best there is to offer (not counting the theatrical version on the KISSOLOGY DVD set,which makes even less sense with it's different scenes edited in/out) with only a small amount of dirt to be seen and only one really noticeable bad scratch in one scene where Calvin (Carmine Caridi) tells ""Phil! cut the power, cut the power!"" but not enough to totally destroy your viewing pleasure. I suspect a decent master was used in the film transfer. You can tell once you see the Laserdisc version.

So if you really enjoy this timeless hunk of cheese of'a film like I do try to find a Laserdisc copy of it (although not an easy task) & a player to enjoy it in a quality that even rivals it's debut airing in 78'!

This movie combines all the depth and suspense of a bad Scooby Doo episode with the wooden acting of an Adult movie.  Mix in some special effects worthy of Ed Wood and pacing more suitable to a Pintner play and you have a work of stunted genius.

This movie is like watching a car wreck.  A slow, poorly paced, badly acted car wreck that takes forever to get where it is going (KISS doesn't show up for 30 minutes!).

There are clips on YouTube where you can see the stilted acting, cheap effects and laughable dialogue but you really need to own this.

My favorite bits are watching KISS ""act"", the poorly staged fight scenes with obvious stunt doubles (they don't even try to conceal their faces!), the cheesy werewolf robots and complete lack of suspense at the denouement.

Oh, and the super cheesy disco funk background music during the fight scenes should be released as its own soundtrack.

I just wish the movie would have explained why he aged 30 years over night.

  The members of Kiss had great stage prescence and some cool one liners. I wish there was more material availible that featured their electrifying characters in story lines.

You have to see it to believe it. Also, the main villian was probably the only real working actor in the entire production.

Ed Wood and Al Adamson are like Spielberg after you've seen this! What is with Ace and his weird quaking sounds and Gene's roaring like a lion?  Anthony Zerby, who is a great and classic actor from the 60's and 70's, is so pathetic as this scientist that has this fabulous laboratory beneath Magic Mountain!! And the plot? Oh man!

The part where Ace, Gene, Paul and Peter are sitting around the swimming pool has the most horrific dialogue in cinema history and is worth watching over and over for a belly laugh!

An evil scientist who specializes in robotics creates fake Kiss clones & steals said talisman. The real Kiss is captured while the clones perform a dreadful concert, replacing the song ""Hotter Than Hell"" with ""Rip And Destroy"" (same music, different lyrics). This incites the fans to rebel against Kiss (and the amusement park this all takes place at) by rioting. Kiss regains their talisman, kick the crap out of the clones, find the evil scientist and...well, I couldn't even print a spoiler on this if I wanted to, because nobody (including Kiss themselves, when asked about the movie in interviews over the last 25 years) understood the ending.

So that's the plot. Even taking the ""Ok, its a sci-fi comic book style movie"" outlook, there are still 2 major reasons I only give this 2/5 stars...

1) The end made no sense
2) The acting is atrocious...not just Kiss, but just about everyone in this movie

When I was a little kid, though, at a Halloween Party having just bypassed the obviously non-productive way of bobbing for apples by simply shoving my entire head in the bucket, pinning an apple to the bottom and winning the damned bobbing kudos; well, I was fairly soaked and removed from the garage while somebody tried to dry me off.

What were the adults doing?  They were watching this film.  I was too young to be into any form of music, I had no idea who these guys were, but they were cool.  I spent the remainder of the party slipping in to watch bits and pieces of it before being sent back out only to repeat the cycle.

I mainly remember liking Peter Kriss's make-up and his singing of ""Beth"".  A few years later I was into music and got Destroyer, and in adulthood they put the movie on to VHS format so I could see the whole thing.  I had the slight cringe one sometimes gets when viewing a movie as an adult that you thought was incredibly awesome as a child, but I couldn't let it go.

It's a pure nostalgia thing.  Adding to the nostalgia is the filming location at Magic Mountain, home of the most awesome rollercoasters ever, though it would be a long time before I really went there.  Magic Mountain, now owned by Six Flags, is shutting down at the end of 2006, so now there's double nostalgia involvement.

Regardless, it's just plain fun - good music, a mythical like approach to the characters of KISS, a plot to take over the world, and really horrible production and effects that you let slide because of the 'to hell with it, let's have fun' mindset this was made in.

It's not for people who don't like at least a little KISS, nor for those who hate gaping plot holes and lousy special effects; but as a time capsule of oddly more innocent times despite the fact that the heroes did things like barf blood and growl, it's a wonderful thing.",1160524800,26,2033,4.384
1202229,4,B00000F4IS,"To the strains of ""Rock 'n' Roll All Night"", the film begins with the members of KISS in various poses and locations, in gigantic proportions playing in the sky, towering over rollercoasters, walking on laser pulses, and riding the track. Switch to concert footage featuring the massive stage show using torches, smoking guitars, sparks, explosions, props, stroboscopic lighting, fog, a rising drum platform, and... fire works!

The Four-Crown Princes of Rock 'n' Roll Hell are being set up by evil super-genius Abner Devereaux, who desires to frame the band by using impersonating robot clones to take over the world using diabolical mind control, to brainwash fans into causing a riot.

First for the framing is Gene, whose robotic double smashes up portions of the park, including bursting through a brick wall, trashing a stand,  and roughing up some security guards.

A girl named 'Melissa' {Deborah Ryan} searches for her fiancee', a photographer who falls under the control of Devereaux. She encounters KISS outside the concert, who provide a clairevoyant clue to his whereabouts. She eventually becomes their acquaintance, and attends a private performance with an instrumental rendition of ""Beth"".

In his malefic menagerie, Devereaux also creates albino wolfmen, spookhouse monsters including Dracula, Frankenstein, and various martial arts villains.

Filmed primarily at Six Flags Magic Mountain in California, the quartet battle the albino wolfmen at the Collosus rollercoaster, the movie villains within the Chamber of Horrors, and the martial arts characters at a stadium, all dispatched with sparks and explosions.

KISS preserve their collective emblems within a box in their chamber {all resembling their symbolic characteristics - a dragon for The Demon, a star for The Star Child, a lightning bolt for The Space Man, and a cat head for the Cat Man; which all rather resemble cookies, interestingly enough}. The Demon spouts fire and can roar like a lion {no trademark blood-spitting here}; The Star Child emits a pulse blast from his starry eye which can both destroy and paralyze; Space Ace has the power of dematerialization and laser blasts; The Cat Man is highly dextrous; and all have the ability to fly.

Devereaux sends the zombified photographer to do his henchman work, to blast the emblems with a laser ray, which weakens them enough to capture through vaccum tubes in The Chamber of Horrors. They are imprisoned within an electric cell and witness the crowd's mental manipulation via a small monitor in Devereaux's Chamber. Not to be kept down for long, KISS use their joined mental telekinetic force to retrieve the talisman box and revive their energy. Flying in from the sky, the final battle is waged on stage with the clones, and they are victorious.

KISS became a major cultural influence in the 70's, with omnipresent merchandising from action figures to make-up kits, cartoons, comic books, to clothing, and all manner of conceivable accessories. Essentially party rock, KISS was an alternative to the Disco proliferation occurring at the time, with the creation of these four characters in mime makeup and fantasy-costumes, creating a living Halloween theater spectacular hardly matched to this day, with the possible exception of Venom, who truly brought a literal Hell to the stage, with resplendant displays of Satanic iconography.

To that end, in the 80's KISS actually earned the ire of evangelists during the SRA-obsessed period of American society, were placed on warning lists along with many others, as numbered amongst the musical agents of The Devil, and became thusly presumptuously labelled with the ""Knights In Satan's Service"" acronym, which of course, the band played to the hilt, as it only added to their showmanship. The double-SS's in the logo were particularly cited as suggesting some far-flung connection to the Nazi SS, which has since been proven irrelevant.

Overall, KISS Meets The Phantom of The Park comes off like a cartoonish ""made-for-TV"" movie, but is amusing for what it is.",1160265600,9,4049,5.252321981424148

7906667,4,B00000F4IS,"In 1978 at the age of 12 I remember calling radio station KTNQ all week to try get free tickets to see KISS at Magic Mountain in California. I had a dial phone back then and the push button phones were just out (dang I'm old.) All my friends had tickets all ready because they had push button phones and they could call twenty times to my one! With my dial finger all sore I finally got threw on the last day! The tickets came in the mail a few days before the show and had KISS's first album cover on the tickets. On the day of the show me and my friends dressed up as KISS and I was Ace of course. It was a hot day and the stage was in the parking lot. We had to wait awhile and then KISS came out and did a few songs for the 8000 fans and then came out and lip sync some songs for the film. Then KISS got off and the film crew asked the fans to start booing and filmed the audience at the time we didn't know why but later when the movie came out it was for when the KISS clones came out and sang "" Rip.. Rip...Rip and Destroy"" instead of Hotter then Hell ... you can't make this stuff up! As for the movie Peter's voice was over dubbed and Ace had no lines in the scrip at first and he just said Ack! Later Ace threaten to leave and then was given some lines. Ace didn't show up on the day for the fight scene and a black actor in makeup took his place. Again you can't make this stuff up! The movie now is a Cult Classic.",1459814400,,1426,3.820945945945946
