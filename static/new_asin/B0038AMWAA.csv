8391182,4,B0038AMWAA,"Ericka Beckman's film is one of those long forgotten finds that opens another perspective on a piece of history. This home footage of No Wave bands creating through deconstructing is invaluable for fans of that genre; as well as those that followed like Post Rock. The slapdash/homemade production might disappoint anyone expecting something the likes of URGH: A MUSIC WAR or even DOWNTOWN '81 (the majority is shot from a static point of view); however being one of the few, nay the only, documents of it's kind - this footage reveals precisely what it should. These are artists of all kinds (sculptors, poets, photographers, painters AND musicians) diving in unabashedly and trying their hand at the 'art' of music. Many budding names crop up of later musical fame; but more never intended to pursue music as a career in the first place. There are as many unknown ensembles present here as famous groupings, but amongst them Youth in Asia shines out as particularly skillful and thankfully now re-acknowledged. If you can imagine a loft party with a camera set-up to face the 'stage' (nothing more than some checkered linoleum on the floor); where BOTH people who arrived that evening as groups with song ideas to create AND people who have never performed together before nor touched an instrument take the stage - then you might visualize this. If only they'd had another camera trained on the rest of the room; the production might have turned out like the infamous TV PARTY shows. On a side note; I was particularly pleased to catch a glimpse of Robert Quine, who pleasantly slogged in the trenches doing sound for No Wave events and recordings before Brian Eno popped up and stole the show (so to speak). As a filmed musical entertainment...perhaps a weak 3 stars; but as a unique historical document - an unabashed 5 stars. So glad this exists.",1357776000,2,1852,4.8454258675078865
