Skip it.",1495411200,,123,3.88

8397411,4,B003IISTJ0,Only bought it for the one DVD (Follow the river).  That was OK.  I had read the book and it kept to it pretty well.  Of course they took some artistic license with the story and characters but what the heck.  The older actress was really good.  The chief Indian was good.,1383004800,,272,4.153846153846154

8397413,4,B003IISTJ0,"The Inheritance is one of my favorite movies.  I had taped it on VHS when it was on TV a long time ago, but I love it so much, I wanted the DVD.  It is based on Louisa May Alcott's first novel, written when she was 17.  Wonderful story, clean, romantic, and just plain good.  What I did for love was OK, not the best acting but also entertaining.  I have not viewed the third movie yet.  Seller was great at keeping in touch when the product did not arrive in a month.  She was willing to reimburse me my money, but then it did come.",1325980800,2,533,3.9716981132075473
