2156836,2,B00061QJ9E,Yu-Gi-Oh Is A Japanese Anime That Was Brought In By 4Kids Entertainment And Was Broadcast On Kids WB! And On Cartoon Network The Movie Was In Theaters In 2004 Here Is My Two Cents On This Movie It Is Way Beyond Dumb And Awful Why ? Here Why The Plot Of The Move Is That Yugi Moto Must Face Of Against Seto Kaiba  Just To See Who Is The Better Card Game Player The Problem Is That This Game Is Real And Dangerous And It Is One That No One Must Loose And It Gets Worse Much Worse Because A Pharaoh Had Lock This Game Away For 5000 Years But Nothing Is Meant To Be Locked Away And What's More An Evil Egyptian Lord Of The Dead Was Spose To Be Locked Away As Well But As We Know Nothing Gets Locked Away Now The Shadow Games Begins With Yugi And Kaiba Facing Against Each Other Or Is it Yu-Gi-Oh Vs The Evil Anubis Who Plots To Control The Entire World This Entire Story Is Laughable At Best At Worst The Character Seto Kaiba Does Not Care If Game Is Real Or If His Life Is In Danger So Why Should I Care About This Movie ? Or For That Matter Why Does Anyone ? And Here Is My Rating To Movie And A Dvd  That Has Very Little Special Features And That I Own This Movie Is Worth 2 Stars Stay Away From This Movie Let Its Life Points Drop Down To Zero,1491091200,,1243,3.8897637795275593

Yu0gi-oh really screwed up with that new yugioh zexal whatever and now a days is not nearly as popular at all, I doubt the yugioh zexal show will even be on tv come this September...
Yu-gi-oh was a kid thing, once you got to high school it wasn't that cool anymore and people stop watching it.
its $15 for this movie which is a total rip off.
no one is going to pay that much for a movie about some show they used to like 10 years ago or whatever unless their rich and spoiled...
and the new kids now a days have no idea what this is because they refuse to play the original episodes on tv whiuch were the best, and no one like that new yu-gi-og zexal garbage.

Try not to get ripped off and buy season 1 on amazon instand video if you have or get that mailed to you, its a way better deal, you can decide if you like it or not.

I used to love watching barney when I was a baby, doesn't mean I spent $15 on a barney dvd now a days though...I was hoping to see some yu-gi-oh but not if it means getting ripped off.",1398902400,,1141,3.930735930735931

2156885,5,B00061QJ9E,"I really liked this movie alot.  It carried a good story line and the animation looks better than it does than the T.V show.  As all Yu-gi-oh! fans know, when Yugi solved the mellinium puzzle Yami yugi was freed.  But unkown to them a evil force was realesed too! Anubis, the lord of the dead has been resurected and is ploting revenge aginst Yami for ruining his plans to take over the world 5000 years ago.  You have to watch this movie your self to know what happens because the story is too good to spoil.  What really makes me angry is that the movie got 1 and a half stars!  Adults just don't understand good movies any more! Just because it is a kids movie dosent mean its bad.  But you can be the judge fo that if you decied to see the movie.  The movie has a little more violence than the show, so parents should be cautioned.  If you are afraid of mummies coming back from the dead, this movie would most likely creep you out so be warned if you arnt a mummie fan.",1138924800,5,974,4.138297872340425
2156886,5,B00061QJ9E,"You know people are getting way too much into the movie when:
1) A girl starts crying at the end of the movie because it was over and she didn't want it to be.
2) The promo cards given away at the movies caused multiple fights over them.  (This actually did happen when I saw the movie.)

Anyways, this is definitely the best anime movie that I have ever seen.  After viewing the abysmal ""Enter the Shadow Realm"" series, I was doubting whether the movie would be good... but believe me, it was.

Yugi and his friends face their greatest challenge when their arch-rival Seto Kaiba obtains powerful cards from the now retired Maximillion Pegasus. More is at stake this time than a monster card championship, or even the rescue of Yugi's amateur-Egyptologist grandfather. Kaiba's challenge coincides with the discovery of the tomb of Anubis by a team of Egyptian archaeologists. The jackal-headed god is portrayed as an evil sorcerer whom the Pharaoh Yami defeated 5,000 years ago. The resurrected wizard uses Kaiba as a pawn in his plan to destroy the world, with everything hinging on the card game between Yugi and Kaiba. The plot is just one good thing about the movie, though.

Yugi and Joey really develop their friendship throughout Yugi's duel with Kaiba.  Also, the action is just plain awesome.

Overall, any fan of the series will love this movie.  A definite infinity/100.

P.S. My favorite quote in the movie comes from Seto Kaiba: ""Let me get this straight. You're going to defeat me with a creampuff and an elf?""  Kaiba does it again- makes you laugh your ass off.",1133827200,11,1576,4.718978102189781
2156887,5,B00061QJ9E,"This movie was great from the beginning to the end, which wasn't very long but it was still a great movie. I reccomend the Animanga also.",1131235200,4,137,4.3076923076923075
2156888,3,B00061QJ9E,"...but it's still 4Kids, and they make a mockery of Kazuki Takahashi's masterpiece every week, every episode, so...

Actually, even though I don't like what 4Kids does with the anime, I still watched the movie with an open mind, so I found it quite enjoyable. The animation wasn't as crappy as it could have been, the ranting duelists weren't as bad as they were in Battle City, and Kaiba's voice-actor displays definite improvement.

For those of you who don't know Jack 'bout Yu-Gi-Oh, don't start here. Walk into a bookstore, go to the manga graphic novel section, and pick up the Yu-Gi-Oh manga. As I write this, there are fifteen volumes available: Yu-Gi-Oh Vol. 1-7 which form the ""Dark Beginnings"" of the series and which are 90% Not There in the anime series we get in the States; Yu-Gi-Oh: Duelist Vol. 1-7 which form the bulk of Season One of said anime, in all its uncut glory; and Yu-Gi-Oh: Millennium World Vol. 1, which is a jump all the way up to the Final Season--I recommend you save that one for later. Just stand in the bookstore and flip through the pages, and if you feel even slightly interested in what you find, buy Vol. 1 of the first series, and if you like that, get Vol. 2, and so forth.

If you don't like those, you'll hate this movie, period at the end.

Myself, being a fan of not only the manga but the card game as well, found it quite enjoyable, but to follow the duels you have to know the rules... hence the need for familiarity with the series behind the movie.

I won't waste time or space blabbing out the plot. I'll just give my verdict. It was closer to the original story of the series than most 4Kids rubbish, but only in the fact that the duel was a Shadow Game that leeched the very life from the players as they lost their points. (The manga games are generally dangerous and many of the early games did not involve the card game at all. In fact, throughout the first seven volumes, the cards only appear in one two-part story nine issues into the series and one two-volume story arc in which four issues are occupied by card dueling and most of the rest by various death-games.) The rest remains true to the English dub only, and the discrepency between the movie and Takahashi's original story become evident at the very beginning, where the completion of the Puzzle is re-written to exclude Ushio (see Vol. 1, issue 1) and include a pack of Duel Monsters card-monsters bursting from the Puzzle to devour Yugi. (Yami Yugi, the Pharoah's spirit contained in the Millennium Puzzle, promptly possesses Yugi and firmly orders the beasts to back off.)

The villain, Anubis, was a paper cut-out. If I were to write this movie into a novelization, I could write Anubis out to be the terrifying, deep baddie he should have been, but in the movie, he's a Joke in a Cape. He has a very vague, shallow history, and there isn't much interesting to tell.

As for the animation... it's somewhat better in the movie than many of the episodes (surprise, surprise--to be expected, actually), but not up to any real movie standards.

The voice actors? Well, Kaiba's improved (as I said), and Pegasus is once again alive in living color... but other than that... well, the English dub is NOT famous for it's voice acting, right? Average at best.

The duels? Well, from one who knows how to follow them, they're pretty good. Granted, if ol' Peggy had summoned Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon and Toon Summoned Skull BEFORE attacking Kaiba, he'd have won, and Kaiba could simply have used the effect of Pegasus's Ultimate Offering card (which works on both players) to bring out his Y-Dragon Head and Z-Metal Tank instead of doing that flashy Return from the Different Dimension combo, but I suppose that plot point had to be set up somehow (Return from the Different Dimension is an important card later on). But overall, good duels, good duels. The pacing was better, less ranting, and the cards aren't those idiotic blown-up parodies 4Kids uses in the television series--they're the real cards on display, just like in the Japanese version of the show. And the life-point counters were the same ones used in the Japanese version, too, a nice touch. There are quite a few little things an uncut fan like myself can appreciate.

My advice: if you're not a Yu-Gi-Oh fan, or else a parent with kids to distract, pretend this movie doesn't exist. If you think Yu-Gi-Oh is just some stupid kiddie show already, read the first seven volumes of the manga, and if that don't disillusion you, nothing on Earth will.

And now, I bid you all, faithful movieviewers, a fond farewell...",1125705600,7,4593,4.623312883435583
2156899,3,B00061QJ9E,"I didn't go to see this in the theatre; I waited and got it as a DVD.  I wasn't expecting great drama, and I didn't get it.  What I DID get was a pleasant couple of hours' or so diversion, which is about what I expected. Yes, you can't deny the commercial tie-ins.  Seems like the American market loves to go for that.  But the characterizations were more or less correct, I don't mind the American voices (where I live it's very hard to get the Japanese versions for ANYthing) and the art wasn't quite as bad as it easily could've been.  (Besides, it was a chance to see more of one of the classier anti-heros in the world, Maximilian Pegasus aka Pegasus J. Crawford.  Darren Dunstan does a good job with his voice, and he really impressed me on the 'Music to Duel By' album by singing in key IN CHARACTER.  That's not as easy as it sounds).

I like to think of the movie as sort of a 'parallel universe' version of the original series. It has a certain similarity to the American TV dub (and thereby to the 'Yu-Gi-Oh' series in general), but it goes in an entirely different direction.  I would DEFINITELY recommend that anyone really interested in Yu-Gi-Oh look into the manga if you want to get to know the full richness of the series.  To me that's the 'purest' form since it was pretty much straight from the mind and hands of the characters' creator.

I give the movie 3 stars because it's brain candy. Take the phone off the hook and put your higher processing centers on hold for a while.  There's nothing here you're going to have to really think deeply about, but there are a heck of a lot worse ways to spend an afternoon.  I don't think I'll make a lifetime out of watching it, but it's going into my stack of 'will watch again'.",1124928000,3,1742,4.323076923076923

Fake drama, end of the world yada yada, only yugi can save us. I understand it's anime- however I am an anime fanatic. Yugioh the movie is definetly not worth seeing.

2156925,1,B00061QJ9E,"When I viewed this movie, I was expecting an hour and a half long card commercial, and I wasn't disappointed. However, going in with the lowest hopes possible was a good choice on my part; I found it was actually more enjoyable than the dubbed television series. There was a little less dueling in it than I had expected, though the plot was still incredibly bleak.

On the animation:

It was horrific. I knew this would happen when American studios tried to mimic the Yuugiou style (Or perhaps any other anime style for the matter. Anime is best left to the Japanese). The characters have elongated faces, and their eyes keep changing. It looks like the Kaiba corp. Grand Prix series did, when they must have been saving the good studios for developing the Egypt arc. Kaiba must be triple jointed at times, and manages to do the fanciest flourishes with a card that I have ever seen, before THROWING it into the graveyard with his hand upside-down.

The coloring is off; Yami Yuugi looks like he's been dunked in grape juice. His hair is meant to have crimson in it, not purple. Tristan Taylor's (Honda Hiroto's) hair seems to have grown even spikier and pointier than usual. Almost all the people in the movie look like they've been drawn by mediocre fan artists.

Some of the new monsters were interesting, but it turns out that Kazuki Takahashi worked on a lot of their designs, so no credit goes to 4kids there.

The inside of the millennium puzzle was wrong. It is not silvery-gray. I was so confused when Yuugi first entered it; I thought he'd entered the `Pyramid of light' instead. In fact, I'm still not completely sure. Originally the room Yuugi entered (Which is Yami Yuugi's heart maze/soul room) is supposed to be a brownish-yellow sort of color.

On the voice acting:

Well, I have to say that the American voices have never been a match for the Japanese voices (It seems that being a voice actor is a much more serious job in Japan than it is in America. I've never heard a Japanese voice actor sound like they've just been picked up off the street), but even for the Yu-gi-oh dub, the acting was disappointing. They already had an awful cast to start with, what with Yami Yuugi sounding like he gets 20 years older with each series and Malik sounding like an 80 year old man who smokes 10 packs a day and is hooked up to an oxygen tank (Or if you just want something easier to imagine, think of The Green Goblin from Spider Man).

Aside from Yami Yuugi, who sounded like himself, everyone seems to have gone a few tones higher. It seems they've realized that almost everyone in the movie, aside from Yuugi, sounds like they're decades older than they really should be. Unfortunately this came with the voices randomly changing to something unexplainable, such as Tristan (Honda) sounding like the Indian man from the Simpsons. I found myself switching it into German, because normal Yuugi's voice actor sounds a lot more like the Japanese one.

I have to say, though, I was impressed that normal Yuugi actually let out a scream that was longer than his legs without his voice breaking. They actually had some emotion in their voices for once. Unfortunately that came with the price of listening to the characters sounding like they're coming down from being on helium.

On the script writing and ""plot"":

Uh... should have gotten Kazuki Takahashi to write it for them. Okay, he's finished Yuugiou; it's over for him. But at least he may have come up with something more original and filled with fewer lame lines. He could have made one last attempt and saved us from Yuugi yelling, ""It's time to get real with the Blue-eyes Shining Dragon!"" Indeed. It IS time to get real. At times, if I closed my eyes, I may have thought I was watching a porn movie. For example, Tristan (Honda) saying, ""This place is crawling with stiffs!"" Pegasus saying, ""Let's not get nasty... yet."" A random 4kids original character yelling, ""I want some!"" And Yami Yuugi announcing, ""Mmm... Yuugi."" Mix that in with the `English for the hearing-impaired' subtitles, ([Grunting] almost immediately followed by, [Moaning] or something to that effect) and you get a combination I wouldn't take my children to if you paid me.

The plot was... lacking for a movie. For a movie, I would give it 1 star. For a card commercial, I'd probably give it a 4 and a half. Pretty much, some random archaeologists find a mummy and an `8th millennium item', Kaiba duels with Pegasus in a semi-important duel and receives cards from him that will apparently help him beat the Egyptian god cards, random people duel in random duels that don't really matter, Yuugi, his grandfather and Ta (Anzu) come across the mummy and millennium item in the museum, find out about a curse, Yami Yuugi and Kaiba duel, Yuugi gets sucked into what I THINK is the millennium puzzle, along with Tristan (Honda) and Joey (Jounouchi). Ta (Anzu) ends up in there too.

They fight mummies, Anubis takes over the duel for Kaiba (Wow, they actually put violence in!), and Yami Yuugi wins. The end. And yes, the plot is about as enjoyable as reading all the run-on sentences I just wrote above.

Usually 4kids takes out every single bit of writing in the Yu-gi-oh dub, whether it's Japanese, bad English or perfect English. It seems they believed American children can't read. However, in this movie, they added quite a few words all over the place. Not to mention the dialogue... oh, good god, the dialogue. Do they expect the average 8 year old to understand the words `postulate' (Even I hadn't heard of that word until Seto said it...) or `imponderable conundrum'? Come to think of it, `imponderable conundrum' is a pretty accurate way of summing up this entire movie.

On their accuracy:

Okay, I know very little about ancient Egypt... but apparently their Egyptology consultant knew even less than I did. Anubis was not an evil god; Seth was an evil god. Anubis was not the god of the dead; he was the god of DEATH. I believe that it was Osiris who was god of the dead, or of the underworld. But obviously since `Slifer the sky dragon' was originally called Osiris and Seth probably sounds too much like Seto, I guess they couldn't use those names. Not to mention Osiris was a good god... but then, hey, so was Anubis!

They gave Anubis a human head. Now, if they hadn't said he was a god, that may have been okay... but the Egyptians didn't give hi a human head, they gave him the head of a jackal. There are some Egyptian gods that you're not supposed to depict as people, and he is one of the many. Lastly, according to my sister, one of the hieroglyphics they used in the title belonged to pharaoh Akenhaten, who Egypt hated for trying to change their religion dramatically. When he died, they tried to remove everything to do with him from their history. That hieroglyph should definitely not have been used. But hey, they probably just made up half of the hieroglyphics that were in that movie.

Their Yuugiou information was just out of whack. When they said that Yami Yuugi's real name is Yami in the TV series, that was wrong; his real name is Atemu (Or Atem). I figured from that, that they don't read the Yuugiou plotline, but THIS is just ridiculous. They completely changed the way Yuugi solved the millennium puzzle. It originally took him 8 years, and when he thought he was finally done, the last piece wasn't there. After he solves it, he transforms into Yami Yuugi, goes and plays a Dark Game with a bully and drives him insane. Pleasant, but that's the way it went.

Yuugi does not call Yami Yuugi `pharaoh'. But you know, he also isn't in love with him, but there happen to be several scenes where Yuugi looks like he's about to start making out with him wildly, or nibbling on his ear, etc. etc. In the movie, he runs through the halls of Yami Yuugi's heart maze yelling, ""Hello? Hello? Pharaoh? PHARAOH? PHARAOOOOOOOOH!!!"" Obviously, that would never happen in the real Yuugiou... or probably even the TV dub, come to think of it.

On the characterization:

They had the personalities of Kaiba and normal Yuugi way off. I lost count of the amount of times I said aloud, ""Kaiba's not like that."" Or, ""Kaiba's personality is totally wrong."" It was hard to put my finger on it, but I felt like I was watching an animated fan fiction at times.

Yuugi was the worst. They made him into a total wimp. He screamed and acted like a complete and utter sissy. At one point, he wakes up from unconsciousness and says something to the effect of, ""Ta, can you read me that story about the bunny?"" I really hope it was `just the concussion talking', because Yuugi doesn't harbor dark secrets about being a fan of fluffy bunny stories, etc.  It was quite sickening, since during the anime, from battle city onwards, there's a heavy focus on how Yuugi has `the strength of kindness' and how he will `one day surpass Yami Yuugi by far'. He's not meant to be a weak character; he's an emotional character. It's a shame the movie didn't manage to show this particularly well.

There were little things wrong, such as Ta (Anzu) being made a total wuss when they're fighting against the mummies. However, Joey (Jounouchi) charges right in there. It doesn't show up much in the dub, but he actually has a horribly morbid fear of ghosts and the occult. It's likely that he would have cowered with fear in the corner until he was surrounded, and then would have fought back out of shock.

Having said all that, I think this is an excellent movie for Yu-gi-oh dub fans to watch. It's slightly deeper than the series, and since I barely ever noticed the music, it can't have been as horribly out of place as usual. You may be disappointed by the pictures, since we all known what the real Japanese pictures are meant to look like, but hopefully if you're young enough, you won't notice. If you're a fan of the Japanese version just looking for a little Yuugiou action, you'd be better off watching the Hong Kong rips (Even if they do have incorrect subtitles such as, ""You look good as the naked pharaoh).

I have to say, parents may want to be careful. Unlike the TV dub, there's shots of violence, like Yami Yuugi's silhouette being stabbed through by a duel monster wielding a knife (This was a HUGE surprise to me, and probably any other people who dislike the dub), or slang words like `crud' or `bull' being used. Pegasus' fruit juice is suddenly revealed to be alcohol (Not that anyone fell for the line about it being fruit juice anyway) and then there's the countless sexual innuendoes. But hey, there are worse movies out there.

This one actually made me laugh several times (Though only two of them were in bits they meant to be funny).

In conclusion, I'd strongly recommend hiring this before making a purchase. You may find it's not worth your money.",1113004800,8,10814,4.6036363636363635

Their trance only broke to discuss which cards they have that matched the ones in the movie.

2156927,1,B00061QJ9E,"Well this was...erm interesting to say the least. I'm not a huge fan of yugioh but I'll watch it if its on and I know the general story. I get the Spanish dub version where I live (which is miles better). I saw this in my local DVD rental and decided to give it a whirl. I confess I was quite eager to listen to the characters in English for a change. Or so I thought. This move is god-awful. I almost fell asleep. The animation was horrific. Fox kids should leave anime well alone. This isn't yugioh; this is an American attempt at yugioh. Everyone looks anorexic, their faces over elongated with their eyes changing shape with every frame. The animators tried giving it an anime look by shining everything up, only to make the characters appear as if they've been rolling in oil and wearing PVC. The characterisation of kaiba is completely off. Did they even research the original series a little bit? Nope. The script is atrocious but also hilarious is some places. Kaiba informing his workers to; `think about postulating a new job'. Do American kids understand the word postulate? Is it the scriptwriter's intent to appear intelligent? `Look he said postulate, how grown up!' But it gets worse. Pegasus is gay. I'm sorry but its true. He flounces about in his flamboyant red frilly ensemble, with long purple hair and drinks red wine spritzers at bedtime. The overly camp voice doesn't do him any favours either. But his constant reference to kaiba as kaiba-boy is quite disturbing. 'Someone needs a hug' Ur yeah. And that whole dungeon duel thing seemed like a lead up to a bondage scene. Kaiba: `This place is an outdated joke, but then so are you so I suppose it fits.' Pegasus: `Now now, Kaiba-boy, lets not get nasty...not yet anyway. Oh dear I'm afraid you're about to enter a whole new world of pain.' But it's not just that. Yugi like his yami a bit too much one feels. Apart from that, insert the plot from the Mummy and you basically have a yugi\mummy hybrid. With tea, tristen and Joey having it out with a bunch of crusty corpses. And another thing, why is everyone speaking so much higher then usual? Dan green sounds the same but Eric Stuart, and the guys that do Joey and Pegasus sound like they really need to go to the bathroom but the director locked them up in the sound room and said, `right you cant go until you've finished this take!' Only he meant the whole movie. I guess it wasn't just the animation that was rushed. Oh and Eric Stuart, please stop singing yugioh songs, you have a lovely voice and this is ruining your credibility. Apart from that, the rest of the movie is just one long advertisement for duel cards. And another few surprising script directions such as yugis grandfather worrying about the electrical surges interfering with his pacemaker and that he doesn't thing kaiba's insurance is going to cover the mass destruction of his duel dome. Add the usual friendship speech from tea and kaiba using the word bull and you have the movie. Oh sorry I'm just going to say it again, Kaiba used the word bull. Now you'd think that fox kids, the guys that brutally mutilated the original TV series and took out all forms of violence and cussing wouldn't allow this. But hey they do and then some. Yugi gets stabbed by a duel monster (my mouth dropped open) and there are some scary moments for very young children (actually when that sphinx thing contorts her face, it freaked me out). Oh yeah and when Joey gets the injection in his bottom by that nurse card, in the TV series the injection is edited out and turned into a rocket. Why? Make up your bloody mind fox kids. To be honest this movie is a total mess. Stick with the original TV series and if you can, hunt out the superior unedited Japanese version. A word to mothers, if your kids loved this movie and are over the age of 8 then I should worry. Really worry.",1110585600,4,3862,4.502849002849003

Yu-gi-oh the Movie was done badly.  Whoever wrote the script had no idea what this story was about.  If they had bothered to have read the manga version which is the best version or saw the original anime subtitled, they would have understood what it was all about.  There were too many one-liners borrowed from movies and television shows (Zoinks? Please!), too much bad dialogue and too much overacting on the part of the pharaoh's voice actor.  I would rather hear the original Japanese voice actor than this guy.  Dan Green does not fit the part. His voice is too old for the character.  Seto Kaiba's voice actor is no better.  The villain, Anubis was lame at best.  He looked like a bad version of Bison from Street Fighter.  Did the writers know that Bakura was lurking in the puzzle and if so, wouldn't Anubis's power affect him since he claims to be the darkness?  Where the heck was Ryo?  Or even Marik.

The little friendship speech at the end on the part of Yugi was really out of line.  Do the writers know who Kaiba is and why he's even in that position in the first place?

The script writers had no idea how a duel was done either. A lot of rules were broken.  I don't know how to play it, but I learned some things watching the subtitled version. It was nothing but a 90 minute commercial to buy more cards and a duel disk.  This movie made me want to bang my head against the table while watching it.

Hollywood screen writers who want to take on the job of writing a screenplay based on someone else's work should do a hell of a lot of research first before they write.  After all, the guy who originally created Yu-Gi-Oh did his research in Egypt.  What research did these writers do?  None.  I didn't even see the need for an Egyptologist in it.  I know this was a kid's movie, but come on!  Give them some credit for intelligence!

I could have written a better story.  This to me was a total fanboy production gone bad.  Maybe they should try for a job at a fast food joint!  God knows, they have no writing talent!",1101081600,7,2214,4.290556900726393

2156944,5,B00061QJ9E,"Although I can be a crazy fan girl, I will give you the truth about the Yu-Gi-Oh! movie. Now personally I was a little let down because the plot was just out there and pretty out of whack as to what KidsWB was showing. It did give you a spoiler, although it was fated, as to who won the Battle City Finals because when the movie came out they were not done showing the ""final duel"" between Yami and Marik. I was pretty upset also at the fact that it was the same old thing: Kaiba vs. Yami, Kaiba goes out of line, another villan takes Kaibas place, Yami beats them, friendship speech, heart of the cards, the end. It was seriously like that. It's really for the people who like the dubbed, butchered versions of Yu-Gi-Oh! But, all together I will buy this movie, and watch it about 10,000 times. Just a warning though for  YGO fans. DO NOT go and buy this movie if you haven't seen it yet. I HIGHLY reccomend going out, renting it or borrowing it from a friend, and figuring if you want it or not. You may be dissapointed and will have wasted money on something you aren't going to watch or enjoy. Really it isn't THAT bad, in my opinion, but I think that a lot of fans were a bit upset about it. I'm not saying the movie was terrible, but when I saw it once in theaters I thought once was enough.

Much of it can be blamed on Pokemon for that but still the ripple effect continues.  Now that I have gotten that out of the way it is time to review this.

Yu Gi Oh the movie takes place after the Battle City Kingdom chapters in the Yu Gi Oh Series.  The plot here is that Kaiba is obsessed with finding a way to defeat the Egyptian God Cards.  So to do so he travels over to Pegasus to get the one card that can stop the god cards.  What no one realizes is that an ancient sorceror by the name of Anubis has manipulated Kaiba so that he can unleash his evil into the world.

This movie is action packed with a good dark story to boot.  I realized early on from the Yu Gi Oh series that despite the dumbing down in translation (that and the Shonen Jump Mangas) that Yu Gi Oh is really a darker more teenage Anime series.

The movie pretty much focuses on one big battle between Yugi and Kaiba.  Both characters can be annoying in this movie if you're my age.  Kaiba is insanely determined to beat Yugi, and Yugi occasionally and superstitiously rambles about the non-existing ""heart of the cards"".

2156957,4,B00061QJ9E,"First of all, I would like to point out that this movie has absolutly nothing to do with the manga or anime.  It is its own seperate story with some hints and some plotline reguarding that of what it is based on (Yu-Gi-Oh of course)

For instance, how Yuugi solved the Millennium Puzzle, was very different compared to Kazuki Takahashi's original written works. In short, manga characters such as Ushio/Ushio and Jounouchi/Joey and the missing piece have nothing to do with it in the movie.  Yuugi just solved it, and then some monsters appear, followed by Yami (voice potrayed by Dan Green) and that is the end of it.

The movie's animation proves to be incredibly different, lacking the beloved quality and style of the anime-- obviosly revealing Four Kid's (pathetic) to attempt at performing Yu-Gi-Oh animation.  The movie, however, does have some violence that you wouldn't expect to see in the US Dub. Such scenes include Atem/Yami getting stabbed by Kaiba's (voice potrayed by Eric Stuart) Pentan the Dark Clown in great detail, along with Anubis decaying at the very end of the film.  However, do not confuse the mythology with true Egyptian Mythology, for ""Osiris"" was the King of the Underworld and ""Anubis"" was the funeral god.

Probably what I liked most about the movie (other than getting Sorcerer of Dark Magic with my ticket at the theater ^^;;) was Pegasus's (voice potrayed by Darren Dunstan) role in the film. With all honesty, I thought he was the best part.  His funny quotes (such as, ""Oh my, sounds like someone needs a hug,"" and ""That's it: no more white wine spritzers before bedtime for me"") and personality were actually quite humorous.

Over all, the movie is (with all honesty) most likely a cheesy Konami and Four Kid's marketing scam-- but for Yu-Gi-Oh fans, it will bring 'some' joy to them. However, if you are an Otaku Yu-Gi-Oh fan, by all means, stear clear.  Also, it is my belief that this movie is and is only for Yu-Gi-Oh fans-- everyone else should stay away or start with the animated series.",1098835200,3,2033,4.766381766381766
2156958,5,B00061QJ9E,"this has to be the best yugioh yet, the shows r very cool, but this movie shows it all, not having to wait another week to watch how it ends, thats what i love mostly about this movie and the fact that it tells a newer story, but where is it on the timeline wit the episodes? i'll just have to figure that out later, u have to check out this movie everyone!",1097971200,3,357,3.904109589041096
2156959,4,B00061QJ9E,"We took our 6yr old son to see it. both he and All the kids there seemed to really love the movie. My wife and I thought it was OK, with a few cool spots(like the other guy said (peg.)""somebody needs a hug"" and certianly the ""Your not me"" (kiaba's song) ROCKS... We had to go out and buy the soundtrack just to get that song. All of the other stuff people have been writing is somewhat illrelevant. the only question is ""Does your kid like Yu-Gi-Oh?"" if you answer that yes, then buy the movie, if no,  ..... don't.

2156960,1,B00061QJ9E,"This film is a testament to how short sighted the mainstream viewing public is, how can children LIKE this crap? It's just an hour long toy commercial with the product forced down your throats every two minutes...and eventually every four seconds.

The film follows EXACTLY the same plot as the series: The characters talk ENDLESSLY about the rules of the game, using card strategies that seem to come out of...nowhere, before pulling out a ""shocking card that turns the tide"" all whilst explaining this to the audience who have no clue what is going on.

The series is rubbish, the film only has moments of quality humour (from Pegasus, who steals the film) but apart from that, it's a toy commercial

If you want to see a movie that is worth watching AND will keep children buying toys, watch the all time classic Transformers: The Movie, or Pokemon 2000, those films have

1. A plot

2. Character development

3. No bad jokes (except for Daniel in Transformers: The Movie)",1095638400,4,975,4.739644970414201

  The animation is flat, no improvement over the lame TV show. I recognize some of the voices, used in Pokemon.

So when I came across this movie on Amazon being sold for a pretty good price, I took it. And I gotta say... IT WAS WORTH IT!! I had to get it used but the dvd and even the case is in pretty great condition! The image quality is superb, the sound is perfect, there isn't a scratch on the disk and the case may be a little wore but still in good condition! Whoever owned it last took very good care of it! Thank you! And thanks to Amazon for helping me get a movie I've loved since I was a kid!! Now I can watch it without having to rely on an Internet connection!!",1508284800,,688,3.852112676056338

8036444,5,B00061QJ9E,"Yu-Gi-OH The movie are one of those movies that just doesn't seem to fit in with it's show. No it really doesn't, but does that make it mad show? Of course not. But it's defiantly not a classic by any means. Yu-Gi-Oh the movie stands out because it's wide variety of monsters in the show, from the blue eyes ultimate to the unusual sphinx monsters, now add in an all powerful evil god like character and Kaiba's obsession to win, you get a movie that really puts on a show. Unlike the Dark side of Dimensions film this movie mainly focuses on one duel, Atem vs Kaiba, but does have some side duels to keep the film entertaining before the final showdown with Atem, Kaiba and the even Sphinx guy. It's not as near as good as when Atem/Yuhi went up against the horrible Marik who tortured his opponents until they pretty much die in like 6 episodes but the movie is great for what it is. The Blue Eyes Shinning Dragon is pretty much steals the entire show, with it's badass but hard to summon abilities. Without no doubts Yu-Gi-Oh the movie is an awesome movie with one main duel that really gets to the point. 90 minutes long, I really like this film because it has all the tension between Atem and Kaiba. This movie is great to see that doesn't connect to the Animated television series. Yu-Gi-Oh the movie is one i'd recommend to fans for all ages. (The music is iffy in the movie but it's nothing that really bothers)",1493942400,,1419,4.378787878787879
8036445,4,B00061QJ9E,"If you've watched the show from the early 2000's then you pretty much know how this movie is going to go.  Kaiba challenges Yugi, Yugi becomes the Pharaoh, it becomes a shadow game, Kaiba pulls out a new card or strategy and it looks like he has Yugi on the ropes for a while, then Yugi believes in himself, his friends or the heart of the cards, etc., and he finds a way to win the duel.

That's the overall plot of the movie, but we also have the world at stake because the Egyptian God of the Dead, Anubus, is using Kaiba to defeat the Pharaoh and re-enter the real world  in order to destroy it.

Overall it's pretty predictable, it's a lot like the show was, but let's face it, Dan Green does an awesome job voicing Yugi and he makes the show so much better with his cool voice!  Check it out!",1493769600,,798,4.122580645161291
