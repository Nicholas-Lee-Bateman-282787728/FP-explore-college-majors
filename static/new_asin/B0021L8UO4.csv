3834291,4,B0021L8UO4,"Cute movie.  I like Nia Vardalos, she's been entertaining in everything I've seen her in.  Though she's not a dramatic actress it's obvious she likes what she does.  I recommend the movie if you want something lighthearted and visually inspiring.  After living in Greece I can completely relate to some of the issues experienced, it makes me miss it.  The movie is predictable, ""gal is uninspired, gal meets guy she can't stand, their differences bring them together, OPA!""  I do intend to buy this once it's available, it's always nice to have a feel good movie around.",1248912000,4,570,4.824742268041237
3834292,5,B0021L8UO4,"I enjoyed watching this movie and I suggest that you watch it.

3834293,5,B0021L8UO4,"Why are there so many critics in this world?  This is a sweet, fun movie that opened up a chance for many to see places in Greece that can not be filmed for commercial reasons.  Kudos to Nia for gaining approval to film in such fantastic places as Delphi, Olympia and at the Acropolis.  This is the perfect movie for a light, summer night or for when you just need a ""pick me up.""  See for yourself.  Greece is a magical place and it was a delight to see it on the big screen.  Nia is charming on and off screen and I think she is terrific.  You go girl!",1248566400,113,554,3.981818181818182
3834294,2,B0021L8UO4,"I thought this was an amusing way to spend an hour and a half.  It was by no means the best movie I've ever seen, but I thought it was cute and carried a good message about the priorities in our lives!! The scenery is great and the supporting cast created many laughs amongst my friends and I.",1248480000,2,293,4.051724137931035
3834295,2,B0021L8UO4,"Nia Vardalos and the producing team of Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson must be trying to recapture the fifteen minutes of fame they achieved with ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding."" Otherwise, I don't think any of them would have been involved with ""My Life in Ruins."" This is one of the worst romantic comedies I've seen in a long time, not so much a film as an exercise in meaningless messages and shallow characters. Only the final half hour shows any degree of entertainment, and even then it's a lost cause simply because the payoff wasn't earned. As a vehicle for director Donald Petrie and screenwriter Mike Reiss, it represents a colossal error in judgment, serving as nothing other than a way to spend ninety minutes out of the house. If you're with a date, good luck trying to make up for it afterwards.

The story is about Georgia (Vardalos), a Greek American who moved to Greece hoping to teach classical studies. That didn't pan out, so she became a lowly tour guide on a ramshackle bus with no air conditioning. At the start of the film, she learns that she has been ranked as a merely average guide, which is essentially one step away from getting fired. Her brutally honest boss (Bernice Stegers) tells her that she lacks ""kefi,"" the Greek term for mojo or zest for life. Unfortunately, she doesn't seem too keen on helping Georgia find her ""kefi."" If anything, she's happy to let Georgia's competition, a bus driver named Nico (Alistair McGowan), do everything he can make her quit. And no wonder--Nico is given the nice-looking bus with the working air conditioner, and he's purposely assigned the nice Canadian tourists who love him for bypassing all the historical landmarks in favor of gift shops and stalls.

So what does that leave Georgia? A mishmash of nationalities that no one seems to like. From America, we have Big Al (Harland Williams) and Kim (Rachel Dratch), perfect examples of why foreigners hate American tourists. We have the fat, clueless, slow witted Gator (Jareb Dauplaise), who unknowingly puts on a T-shirt with a Greek phrase that promotes sodomy. We have Marc (Brian Palermo), an IHOP executive who will gladly drone on and on about the history of pancakes and his collection of rare syrups. And then there's Irv (Richard Dreyfuss), another American; he's loud and obnoxious, cracking very unfunny jokes at Georgia's expense. He also serves as the archetypal wise elder, a lonely widower who inspires Georgia with astute observations on life.

From England, we have the kind old woman, Dorcas (Sheila Bernette), who doubles as a pickpocket and shoplifter. We also have the snooty Mr. Tullen (Ian Ogilvy), his icy wife (Caroline Goodall), and their moody teenage daughter (Sophie Stuckey), who spends almost the entire film wearing headphones attached to a non-working MP3 player. From Australia, we have a young couple (Simon Gleeson and Natalie O'Donnell) who spout unintelligible slang and are never seen without a can of Fosters in their hands. From Spain, we have two bitter divorcees (Mara Botto and Mara Adnaz) who are apparently not bitter enough to keep looking for their respective Mr. Rights.

Finally, there's Alexis Georgoulis as the manly Greek bus driver, Poupi, which unfortunately is pronounced like ""poopy"" (his last name isn't any better). He inevitably becomes Georgia's love interest, although not before he shaves off his thick beard, dresses in nicer clothes, and reveals that he can in fact speak English. He's a student of the Zorba the Greek philosophy, giving Georgia the spiel about living life passionately and without a plan. What no one seems to notice is that he's all talk and no walk. It's not as if he dances in the streets or plays lovelorn melodies on the bouzouki. He's a bus driver, for God's sake. Where's the passion in that?

These people are not characters. They're nothing more than caricatures, broadly drawn stereotypes so lacking in depth that they couldn't even aspire to be cardboard cutouts. Even Vardalos, talented though she may be, can't escape the superficiality of her painted face, her bright smile, and her salon-quality hair. Her character is not a woman with genuine problems so much as a byproduct of the romantic comedy paradigm--a nice enough girl trapped in a less-than-ideal situation with no boyfriend. The question is: Will she ever find love, or is she doomed to spend the rest of her days alone? And can she win the hearts and minds of the boorish tourists?

Feel free to answer the above questions as you see fit. If there is a reason to see ""My Life in Ruins,"" it would be to look at the ruins, which are not only lovely up there on the screen, but are also hilariously symbolic of the film itself. To say that it goes in the wrong direction would be an understatement; it's tragically misguided, succeeding only as an example of what not to do when making a romantic comedy. It tries to be both an escapist date movie and a message about living life as it happens, but when there's nothing funny or truthful about the story or the characters, all you have is a ridiculous premise about ridiculous people. I can only hope that Nia Vardalos will put this one behind her, after which she can move on to something that will actually connect with the audience.",1244419200,6,5255,4.813953488372093
3834296,3,B0021L8UO4,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was funny, entertaining, touching and the scenery was breath taking.  Was it a great movie, no but it was a good movie that entertained. After all, isn't that why we go to the movies? I recommend it without reservation",1244246400,15,254,4.644444444444445
3834297,1,B0021L8UO4,"Sure, Greece is beautiful--think about Homer's wine dark sea, the cradle of Western Civilization with a shining Parthenon sitting upon the Acropolis looking over the modern city of Athens, ice white windmills gyrating in a sun-drenched blue sky--but in director Donald Petrie's hands in his film ""My Life in Ruins,"" even the cinematography screams: mediocrity.  How could that be in one of the most picturesque countries in the entire world?

Well. . . blame it on Hollywood.

Another ""I Love My Greek Ancestry"" vehicle for Greek Canadian actress Nia Vardalos whose one hit wonder&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Big-Fat-Greek-Wedding/dp/B00006FMUW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Big Fat Greek Wedding</a>&nbsp;(2002) still brings a smile to this reviewer's face, ""My Life in Ruins"" formulaically depicts the now skinny Vardalos as fired professor, now reluctant tour guide, Georgia, whose frustrated existence is summed up in a confession which effectively states she hasn't had sex in quite a long while.  Vardalos, who in ""Greek Wedding"" portrayed the overweight yet endearing Tula, shed more than just twenty pounds and some major eyebrow hair.  In ""Ruins"" she misses the mark, seemingly thrilled to show off her new figure and an expertly colored Tina-Fey-as-Sarah-Palin coiffure while sporting ridiculously high heels for her walk up the treacherously steep precipice leading to the Parthenon.  The amusing self-deprecating voice-over of ""Greek Wedding"" becomes cloying as Vardalos rushes from one scene to another hampered by sappy supposedly introspective dialogue, thanks to screenwriter Mike Reiss and 40-ish spinster woe as she sarcastically critiques her lack of romantic situation and then, of course within the span of two hours, as in all Hollywood fractured fairytales, suddenly switches on the light bulb of attitude adjustment, wins the guy and creates a synergistic miracle amongst all her troubled constituents.

Whereas Vardolos had a fine supporting cast in her first film---the marvelous Lainie Kazan and the stoically hysterical Michael Constantine as her old-fashioned parents, (remember the crazy aunt whose biopsy showed teeth)--she is barely bolstered by the group of stereotypical tour bus goers that except for veteran actor Richard Dreyfus as the tour's self-appointed schtick-y comedian are simply not all that memorable.  Love interest Alexis Georgoulis definitely radiates attractive male charisma as he transforms from a hairy voiceless creature from Hades to a philosophy spouting demi-god with a six-pack.  However, he doesn't have the well-honed chemistry of John Corbett whose white bread sensitivity and boyish charm offset perfectly Tula's shy and unabashed vulnerability to create movie wow.  Couple Ruin's weak cast with an even weaker storyline: misfit tour director bonds with her disgruntled group to eventually form a mini-village of helping hands complete with the requisite happy ending.

Bottom line:  Skip this one.  For a good film about Greece look at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zorba-the-Greek/dp/B0001XALGY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zorba the Greek</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Never-on-Sunday/dp/B00008ZZ9J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Never on Sunday</a>.

3834397,4,B0021L8UO4,"I really liked this story. It was original in the fact that it takes place on a tourbus, touring Greece. The cast made it fun. I wasn't sure what to expect after watching My Big Fat Greek Wedding, but I was pleasantly surprised with this movie, as I was with My Big Fat greek Wedding. Nia Vardalos plays a Greek tourbus guide, and learns on the way how to make this job fun for her and fun for the tourists on her bus. Her new positive outlook may even find her love. All with a beautiful backdrop of ancient Greek ruins and beautiful sunny beaches. I kind of felt like I was on vacation watching it. I also always appreciate it when a comedy doesn't fall back into ""the cheap way to get a laugh"" through vulgarity or slapstick humor to keep the viewer entertained.

Too bad they threw in the trashy hotel scene with Richard Dryness (really? two women?) but maybe thats the only reason he agreed to do the movie. Why does Hollywood ruin things?

3834802,4,B0021L8UO4,"Nia Vardalos plays the disheartened tour guide, Georgia, who finds that her historical knowledge of Grecian antiquities holds little interest for the odd assortment of tourists from other lands whom she conducts around Athens in a dilapidated bus. Only when Georgia discovers her own joie de vivre with the help of a handsome bus driver nicknamed Poupi (Alexis Georgoulis) and an elderly widower, Irv (Richard Dreyfuss), from one of her tours, does she discover her own life's meaning, plus a little romance on the side. This delightful romantic comedy is obviously inspired by two classic Greek films, ""Never on Sunday"" and ""Zorba the Greek."" Whereas the uptight intellectuals who need spiritual awakening in those two earlier films are both men, ""Georgia"" in this film is very much a woman. ""My Life in Ruins"" actually pays homage to both its predecessors as Nia Vardalos sings the theme song of the former, and the tour group dances to the theme music of the latter. The gorgeous cinematography of Grecian antiquities will inspire you to contract your travel agent immediately. This movie is meant to be a feel-good movie, and it succeeds.",1477699200,,1142,5.0476190476190474

3835769,4,B0021L8UO4,"There are movies that are meant to inspire, films meant to tell us about the human condition, and others that just seek to entertain. ""My life in Ruins"" aims to simply entertain with its girl down on her luck love story.

Nia Vardalos plays an Greek-American who has relocated to Greece to serve as a tour guide. Her excitement of Greek culture doesn't translate as she comes off to her tour groups as a boring history guide who lectures more than entertains.

Her latest perhaps last group proves to be the eclectic mix that helps her connect with her tourists and find love during their misadventures.

The tourists are complete stereotypes even by the movie's own admission and the events are very much situational. However, if you are just looking for a fun film with lots of heart this is a fun hour and a half. It doesn't hurt that the Greek ruins serve as the scenery which is very easy on the eyes.",1454198400,,906,4.512195121951219

It is a good move but not one I would watch again (which would equate to a 4 or 5 star) that has some good points in it and some not so good points.

The good - Actions and attitudes of others do not mean they are a nasty person but could be someone struggling with a loss or other 'disaster' in life.
Look around because the life you want could be as close as your current life.
Live life to its fullest because as fast as we have it today, tomorrow might not exist.

Although I really like Nia Vardalos, especially in My Big Fat Greek Wedding, she seemed to be coasting through this one, trying to get it over with. Part of the charm of My Big Fat Greek Wedding was how ""real"" she was in that part, she owned it. And the chemistry between her and John Corbett was so good too. Her love interest in this film just didn't cut it.

I also really like Richard Dreyfuss but found his role depressing for the most part, in this film. The ending was all wrong in this regard, IMO. SPOILER ALERT!!! He should have died peacefully on the beach, to join his beloved wife on the other side then. Not to go on to have a night of ""wild"" sex with a couple of sleazy tourist girls who were less than half his age. That just didn't ring true.

The scenery of Greece is breathtaking, really liked that part. And Nia, I don't know how she's accomplishing this, but 7 years after: Greek Wedding, she looks even younger!",1423180800,2,966,4.2967032967032965

Her comedic genius and ability to convey humor with just a facial expression showcase her talent, built upon experience in the Second City company. She works off of Richard Dreyfus, who convincingly plays the role of a widower taking his first trip alone after losing his wife. If Nia Vardalos is the heart of this movie, Dreyfus is its soul. Dreyfus' character uses humor to mask the grief of losing his mate but he opens up emotionally to Vardalos and reveals depth and wisdom. He is the catalyst to Nia's character finding herself again.

But the big appeal, at least to me, is Nia Vardalos herself, an actress that reaches into the audience's heart and makes you feel like a welcome visitor to her world. She imbues her characters with an accessible charm that I find rare in most actresses. Somehow, she conveys a sense of being down to earth and rooted in the same world as her audience. I hope to see more from her in the future.",1421366400,,1261,4.526315789473684

Just like any other romantic comedy, it's pretty predictable, but who even cares! All romantic comedies have the same skeletal structure that make us giggle and smile in our seats!

This is a lighthearted romantic comedy that also gives you a peak at Greece (which was the real draw for our household).  Nia Vardalos is charming and so is her eventual boyfriend.  There are moments of stagy-feeling physical comedy that were a little irritating, but this movie is meant to be a diverting event not high art.

3836750,5,B0021L8UO4,"I really loved this movie.  I love a great light-hearted, feel good movie and this is one my new finds.  I have certain go-to movies when I need a virtual vacation, a pick-me-up, escape from reality, or just a good old veg out evening.  What am I looking forward to in a movie like this: great scenery, some good jokes, and a happy ending. I don't care if it is realistic or true to life.  Life itself is realistic enough.  I want to be entertained for two hours. On this criteria (my criteria!) this movie is 5 stars.  This is the latest addition to my ""mental vacation"" rotation which already includes: Under the Tuscan Sun, Letters to Juliet, You've Got Mail...you get the idea.  If that is the kind of movie you are looking for, don't hesitate.  If you are looking for a thought provoking Oscar wining movie, keep looking...but you'll miss out on a cute movie.  By the way I literally laughed out loud at least 4 times. The synopsis, and I am sure many other reviews, describe the story and plot so I won't go into that.  To say it is the Classic romantic comedy format -- done well -- says enough.  In the light-hearted, virtual vacation category I also recommend Ginger and Cinnamon if you are ok with subtitles/foreign films.",1408665600,,1232,4.479820627802691

She is so appealing and seems like an old friend--that is, if you are lucky enough to have a friend like her!  Nia also wrote this hilarious movie, and you will recognize people you know who are just like some of the characters. Another reason I love it is the breathtaking scenery of Greece, which I have dreamed of visiting. The hilarious tourists and the endearing love stories make this a great film for everyone. You will also love the dotty old couple, the handsome bus driver, the nasty tour guide and Richard Dreyfuss, who is very appealing. I know this movie received some poor reviews, but it is silly fun and harmless, and Nia is the best.  I wish she would do more films. She also is wonderful in CONNIE AND CARLA. Shakespeare it is not...but great fun and hilarious characters it is.
You won't be able to take your eyes off Nia, who like Fran Drescher, channels Lucille Ball in her performances--and that is a high compliment.",1396396800,,1020,4.532608695652174

3837244,4,B0021L8UO4,"This is an adorable, go-to movie that I have watched time and again. Nia Vardalos is absolutely perfect in her role as the forlorn expat who is biding her time as a tour guide until something better comes along. The assortment of characters who join her on the tour bus is a delightful amalgam of ""types"" whose contrasting personalities make for moments both poignant and hilarious. Richard Dreyfuss, who plays an endearing American tourist whose wisdom and humor covers a broken heart, is the modern-day Oracle of Delphi who dispenses spot-on advice to his fellow travelers. And travel they do, playing their parts against a gorgeous background of scenic Greece. That element alone is worth the price of admission. Highly recommended!",1395878400,,735,5.082644628099174

That said, I don't understand how either of these fine actors ended up in this pitiful movie.  It is crude, the script is terrible and the storyline is senseless.

The group of characters in her tour group teach her that it's okay to laugh, dance, and have fun in life.  Enjoy!",1370044800,,382,4.492753623188406

I really like Nia Vardalos after having seen her in My Big Fat Greek Wedding (MBFGW), and have always wanted to be a travel agent, so this movie was a ""must see"" for me. The movie is a nice way to escape from reality for a couple of hours, although, as I said in the title, it's a little (okay, a lot!) unrealistic. I can't imagine being on a tour with a tour guide who acted the way she did in the movie, or being with any of the characters for that matter. I did like seeing Greece though :) Bottom line is that I won't watch it again, which is telling for me, as I bought MYFGW after I saw it the first time and have watched it a few times since. That said, I think that this movie is worth a watch on a sick day or on a boring weekend evening :)",1365811200,3,800,3.8545454545454545

3837735,4,B0021L8UO4,"We ordered this movie in anticipation of our upcoming trip to Greece, on a recommendation that it would somewhat acquaint us with some of the historical sites.  While it is not an excellent movie, it does have a fun story line.  Feels similar to some of the ""Vacation"" movies of the 80s.  Lots of variety. Nia Vardalos is great in her role, as is Richard Dreyfuss in his loveable character.  Lots of funny parts, a little romance, and one somewhat sappy scene where tears filled my eyes.  Good for a light evening.  Not deep, doesn't require much thought, no action, some romance.",1363996800,3,580,4.637254901960785

Sure we'll recall her other films and the notorious ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding.""  But this one stands out because it's a good comedy.

Nia Vardalos is a very talented woman.  I've seen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Big-Fat-Greek-Wedding/dp/B00006FMUW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Big Fat Greek Wedding</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Hate-Valentine-s-Day-Widescreen/dp/B002U1LGTQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Hate Valentine's Day (Widescreen)</a>.  But I really prefer ""My Life in Ruins.""  It's a great comedy film.  Sure it's got some romance but the humor outshines.

Apparently the script started with Mike Reiss and then Nia re-wrote it.  So it has a mix of ""The Simpsons"" and ""Greek Wedding.""  Then there's ""Saturday Night Live"" gal - Rachel Dratch.  And then Richard Dreyfuss as ""God"" Irv Gideon.  These and other cast members were all perfect.  They had perfect chemistry and just the right amount of attitude.

I did not know that it was the first time any production was able to film ""The Acropolis"" (according to Wikipedia and the ""London Guide"").  I was in the Navy for 4 years and blessedly visited about 8 countries.  I've been on various tours and made quick tours ourselves (being that each visit lasted no more than 4 days).
Seeing this movie reminded me of the adventure of traveling and sight seeing.  Some of the stereotypes in this movie is spot on and others are exaggerations, but this is a movie.  A comedy at that.  The exaggerations helped give it an extra bit of comedy.

So I own this movie through iTunes.  I've watched it countless times and I recommend this for a good laugh.",1359936000,3,1954,5.981949458483754

3837744,5,B0021L8UO4,"Let me start by saying that even if you see this movie and do not like the story, the scenery alone is awesome and worth the purchase price.  You get to see many tourist areas of Greece without the cost of a plane ticket to go to Greece (although, I definitely would love to be in Greece and see these places in person).  I think the story line is great too.  Nia Vardalos has certain aspirations and has a different perspective of how she viewed people and just life in general.  She was a tourist guide and was simply burned out.  With the help of some of the tourists more specifically Richard Dreyfuss, she begins to see life differently.  As a result, she had also found love.  If you are considering this movie, definitely give it a try.  As I mentioned earlier, even if you feel the story was horrible, you will not be disappointed by the scenery.",1356998400,2,854,4.360759493670886

The only reason I didn't give it a five, is that although the film is supposed to have been filmed in Greece, knowing the country as well as I do, it is clear that more than half was filmed in Spain. While I am sure it is because the film was co-produced by Spanish backing, and many of the cast are in fact, Spanish, I only wish they would have taken advantage of a country as magnificent as Greece, to have filmed all of the scenes there - as well as using Greek actors to play Greeks, instead of Spanish actors.

No. This is a feel good, romantic comedy of the type not made much anymore. Nia Vardalos (My Big Fat Greek Wedding) is perfect as the American who came to Greece to teach and ended up as a brainy tour guide when the economy tanked. Her competition is a smarmy, ingratiating guy who plays up to the women although he's gay. But he seems to know what tourists want, while Georgia is intent upon imparting history. Richard Dreyfuss is at the top of his game as a widower hiding his grief behind an obnoxious, wisecracking exterior. The hunk in this film is Alexis Georgoulis as the tour bus driver, who falls for Georgia long before she gives him a second glance. The cast is filled out by various ""types"", and as they travel together, they also change a bit together. Don't look for any great philosophical moments, or even any breathtaking cinematography here.

3837978,3,B0021L8UO4,"Three stars because I bought it.  I bought it because ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" always seems to end to soon, and while this movie is no relation to that one, it serves well as dessert.  That said, this isn't nearly as good as MBFGW.  The plot is simple:  An American college professor of Greek Art History is out of work and doing tours between offers, in Greece.  She wants to share the fine parts of Greek culture with tourists who want to shop, eat ice cream, and suntan at the beach.  She's very uptight.  Because the forward motion of the movie is largely dependent on a bus, the bus is filled with stick figures draped in stereotypes, and so we never really develop a relationship with them, that we had--to some extent--in MBFGW.  Two actors play Aussies, which means a couple hugging cans of Fosters and uttering gibberish from the Book Of Aussie Slang, and nothing else.  The eastern European women say nothing, but dress in print dresses circa 1958.  The Americans all play shades of dumb and rude, save for Richard Dreyfus who plays a God of sorts, and always utters something pithy.  It is Dreyfus' character who helps Nia's character to loosen up.  It takes about half the movie for the film to get moving.

Again, I bought it because I liked ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"", and recommend it accordingly, to those fans.  If you're considering this film without having seen the other;  I'd first recommend ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"", instead, or, ""Bread And Tulips"" which is an Italian effort (with subtitles) that has a similar vein (to this film) in that it starts on a tour (of Italy) and ends in Venice, but has more developed characters and a better story.  On the other hand, if you're snow or rain bound, and want something light, and have some good popcorn and real butter, you won't hate yourself for watching ""My Life in Ruins"".",1294185600,4,1847,4.5683890577507595

The sentiments of love and romance that she espouses in her films aren't necessarily fashionable among the elites (i.e. the critics) yet she's such a firm believer in amore that she goes whole hog in her films.  It wasn't until ""My Big Fat Greek Weeding"" became a phenomenon that it was given a re-evaluation.  ""Connie and Carla"" was a gender reversal of ""Some Like It Hot"".  This film reminds me of a Sixties cult film, ""If It's Tuesday It Must Be Belgium"".  Vardalos is also aging quite nicely.  She's more beautiful here then she was in ""MBFGW"".  I also find it interesting that her love interests in these films are usually hunky guys (John Corbett, David Duchovny, Alexis Georgoulis).  In real life she's married to the tubby balding Ian Gomez from the late lamented ""Whose Line Is It Anyway"".  Gomez has a bit here as the randy hotel concierge.  Needless to say, this film was released in the Summer of '09 a time of year when people aren't looking for the deepthink and are more receptive to Vardalos' worldview.

Richard's part was so like him in that he is another great actor that can ""play"" any character and be so great and adorable at the same time.

I am a ""first generation Greek"" in America and could understand the Greek that was spoken as well as the English so I was entertained by both languages spoken. That was a very special treat for me personally.

The movie was sweet, cute and a great show of how the Greeks in Greece really are in their ability to ""bargain"" and ""seduce"" tourists.  I experienced it first hand and the tour that I was on, was the same tour that they took us on in the film.

The scenery is so breathtaking and beautiful and Delphi really does ""change"" you in a very subtle way that even I came away touched by the oracles of Delphi.  The day that we were there was sunny and balmy and it was my favorite day in the 14 days that we were in Greece.

The story line was, to me, portrayed in such an enjoyable, sweet way and, of course, I was once again so touched to know that Rita Wilson and Tom Hanks were the ones that brought us this film just like they saw to it that ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" was their undertaking after seeing the play.

I feel personal pride in being Greek as is Rita Wilson and she has the ability to let the rest of the world experience, in a ""family way,"" what it is to be a Greek in North America.  I actually thought I was the only little Greek girl ""in the world"" that didn't get to become a ""Brownie"" because I HAD to go to Greek School.  That was a ""special moment in time"" for me. to say the least.

Thank you, Rita and Tom, for allowing the rest of the world to actually become a part of the Greek culture in such an entertaining way and what you did was ""right on"" about what we, as Greeks, are all about and in such a ""tender"" way.

There is a lot of interesting and beautiful scenery of Greece and the famous ruins there as well as an interesting story about a young woman who has moved to Greece to teach at the university but has wound up as a tour guide.

The tourists, unfortunately, do not share her academic fascination with ancient Greek ruins and history and instead, just want to have some fun. Georgia, the young tour guide, played by Nia Vardalos, finds herself being frustrated by their indifference to all she allows herself to hold dear.

As the story unfolds, her frustration reaches a breaking point when she writes to her employer that this is her last tour after which she is quitting her job.

The second half of the film explorers the impact of two men in her life, one older tourist, played by Richard Dreyfuss, and the young Greek bus driver, played by Alexis Georgoulis. From this point on the movie picks up speed and actually got more interesting and funnier to me.

As one might expect, the movie has a happy ending and all turns out for the better. The journey to that point makes for an entertaining evening with a few suggestive scenes but no real nudity. The movie is rated PG-13.",1282953600,2,1238,4.613636363636363

The scenery, however, was beautiful - it made me want to hop on a plane and explore ancient Greece!

I love Nia Vardalos, and while she wasn't as great as she was in My Big Fat Greek Wedding, I still found her very funny with a fantastic spark about her.  I also loved Richard Dreyfuss, but especially Rachel Dratch and Harland Williams!  They were fantasticly fun and ridiculous as always!

3838056,1,B0021L8UO4,"I am sure someone won't like this review because I am only giving ""My Life in Ruins"" one star. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, including me.

That being said, I'll begin my review with this question: Why was this movie made? Aside from the beautiful scenery in Greece, there was no reason to watch it. My wife and I sat through only 40 minutes waiting for something funny to be said by someone, by anyone, before we gave up. Both of us were embarrassed for the lead actress Nia Vardalos. She was terrific in ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"", but seemed to be struggling to salvage something even marginally humorous from this mess of a movie. The plot was unbelieveable and silly. A college professor, Vardalos, is laid off from her position as a teacher of Greek History and can only find work as a tour guide. She shows her party of tourists (a busload of stereotypes: obnoxious Americans, drunken Australians, hot and hungry for love Spaniards, a bored teenager forced by her parents to take the tour with them, an unfunny guy who tries desperately to string out flat one-liners, etc.) the sights in and around Athens, informing them, without success, about the history and culture of the early Greeks at the ancient ruins they visit, when all the people on the tour really want to do is shop and eat. None of this was a bit funny to us.

If you want to see a good movie, full of humor, beautiful scenery of Greece, and, yes, romance, watch ""Shirley Valentine"". Now THAT'S a movie both my wife and I can recommend.",1280620800,8,1518,4.536496350364963

I was very pleasantly surprised, because I wasn't expecting to like it so much.  I just thought it would be one of those movies where I would take a look, fast-forward, and erase.  But I am keeping it on my DVR.  It is a light, romantic comedy and has so much gorgeous scenery.  Sure it's simple and has some easy humor, but so what?  The only question I ask myself about any movie I watch is, ""Was it entertaining?"", not ""Was it intellectually stimulating?""  It's a movie, not school.  And this one is fun and it makes you (well, me, anyway) want to visit Greece.  What I like most about it, is that it reminds me of Vardalos's ""Greek Wedding"" (but without the Windex)- repressed woman who is a lonely, struggling Greek tourguide, with the help of colorful tourists and an increasingly attractive tour bus driver, finds romance and self-fulfullment.  Simple, cute, fun film.  And Richard Dreyfuss is great here, too.",1278115200,,1196,4.426605504587156

3838062,3,B0021L8UO4,"If you've ever been part of a tour group in a foreign country, you'll be able to relate to My Life In Ruins.  If the characters are over the top caricatures and the predicaments they find themselves in a little too bizarre to be believable, that's OK.  This is a romantic comedy and nobody expects it to be realistic.  What we do expect is for it to be funny, and though it tried really really hard, it's not, though not a total waste of time. I enjoyed spending an hour and a half in Greece, but Zorba The Greek this movie isn't.

My Life In Ruins does not flow. The actors knock themselves out demonstrating growth from misfit geekiness to warm fuzzy family, but it's not quite believable.  Don't get me wrong.  I heart everybody in this film, especially Nia Vardalos, and it's not any of the actors' faults that the material simply isn't good.

Sometimes when film writing and casting stars align, magic is made--Gigi, When Harry Met Sally, Moonstruck, and My Big Fat Greek Wedding for example.  What makes them magic is that all the characters are appealing. My Life In Ruins is not magic--very few of the characters are likeable.  They could have been, and Greece deserves better.

Poor Ms. Vardalos.  Her forte is self-deprecating humor and at her best, we're included in the jokes.  It's too bad she can't seem to find a screenwriter who understands her strengths and can write a script around them.",1277164800,4,1406,4.602409638554217

3838064,1,B0021L8UO4,"For me, `My Life in Ruins' is a colossal failure.  It has all the elements of a failure, and so I should have known walking in that it was going to be bad, but I held out hope because this formula has been known to work when the elements come together in the right way.

This film is a waste of time.

I say this because `My Life in Ruins' has absolutely no charm.  It has the same scenarios and the same `characters' that all these `finding yourself' romantic comedies has, but it lacks any and all charm.  It is merely a series of events with a slew of mismatched people brought together with reckless abandon to create a hodgepodge of moments we either laugh at (because we have to) or we roll our eyes to.  There needs to be some sort of connective tissue with these films, some sort of entity that draws us in.

Nia Vardalos just can't do that.

The film follows a single middle-aged (or nearing) woman named Georgia who works as a tour guide in Greece.  She is in love with the culture, but she is disrespected by her boss and co-workers and finds herself consistently stuck with the worst groups and the worst hotels.  When she has finally had enough, she winds up finding happiness thanks to a scruffy driver and a crotchety old widower.

Seriously.

You can open mouth and insert corn right about now.  The film prides itself on slopping one ridiculous clich&eacute; after another right on you plate, with a healthy dose of stereotypes that don't even have the decency to try and appear fresh.  You have the sullen teenager, the crazy Americans, the fighting married couple, the wise old widow(er); etc.  And then you have the forced sentiment that comes in all shapes and forms, from Poupi (yes, you pronounce his name like the stuff in your toilet) explaining why he loves to drive to Irv pretending to be the oracle (the corniest scene in any film I've seen this year).  The jokes are all tired variations of jokes we've heard a million times.  This entire film just feels like a recycled version a every other comedy you've ever seen (almost).  The acting doesn't make up for it either.  I like Vardalos to an extent, but sadly she hasn't been able to capture the magic she ignited with `My Big Fat Greek Wedding' and this surely doesn't help.  Georgoulis may clean up nice, but he's rather flat.  In fact, the only actor who brought anything to the film was Dreyfuss, and sadly he was hampered by being stuck with Mr. Clich&eacute; himself.

I highly recommend walking far, far away from this movie.  You can throw this on my list of `Worst Films of the Decade', easy.",1275350400,5,2582,4.493562231759657

She isn't the best tour guide and tends to bore her tourists with too many facts and not enough beaches.  Her boss Maria decides that if Nikos, another tour guide gets Georgia to quit, he can have a raise.  Nikos tries to sabotage Georgia and her group along the way.  You meet a handful of supporting characters like Popi Cacas, Irv, Dorcas the clepto, etc that add to the charm of the story.

You get a hairy wolf-man, which underneath all that hair, you know he must be hiding his true assets of a man, and brother he can shake up any gal in finding her ""mojo.""  Georgia, which is Nia Vardalos is just my favorite of all actresses. She was a hoot in ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding,"" and she's even more spunky and funnier in this one.  You can't help but just fall in love with her; my hero-girl.  Richard Dreyfuss supports his character very well with humor, silliness, seriousness and at times a ""crab-fart.""  But he's a very enjoyable character; loved him in Jaws! From this movie you will receive ""Georgia's"" tourists ranging from Australia, England, Greek and USA.

Nia plays a great part, and looks gorgeous in this movie. According to my wife Alexis Georgoulis (Poupi) also turns out to be quite a hunk! Richard Dreyfuss injects some magic into the storyline and plays a lovely pivotal character.

With a talented international cast including Richard Dreyfuss this movie optimizes both the humorous and serious side of life.  The chemistry between all of the characters is just wonderful and relies on real human interactions combined with the spectacular scenery of Greece rather than special effects - how often do you see that these days?  Noting some of the negative comments it is admittedly something of an 'inside joke' to those who are into travel and there are a few Greek tourist clichs and other stereotypes.  However all of the jibes are sensitively done, by and large accurate to my experience, and will resonate with anyone who has ever toured Greece 'economy' class!

There is also a spot-on icy grumpy 40ish British wife.  Real surprises come from a 70-something little old English lady who is a superbly skilled pickpocket - always a giggle and a treat when she has a scene.  Also Brian Palermo has a small role as an IHOP executive constantly talking about pancakes.  But Palmero is also a writer and a top-flight improv comedian, and there are some wonderful 'extra' out-takes where Palmermo creates a series of improv scenes playing the pancake-fixated IHOP executive in a dozen extemporaneous variations.

3838281,3,B0021L8UO4,"My review title here should read Entertaining, but probably best as a rental (think Unbox).  While I can see some viewers enjoying this enough to add it to their collection, and certainly the location shots of the wonder and splendor that is Greece shines through, the story here just doesn't rise to the level of something that would likely be viewed multiple times.

I give the writers credit for not going for the completely contrived and predictable, but then again what is here is barely above that.  There's humor in watching Georgia (Nia Vardalos) struggle in her job as a tour guide, but the setup is a bit too convenient.  Her tour group, Group B, is a mix of charicatures of various types all of which come together as a perfect mix of personalities that all wind up fitting too neatly with the rest of the group.  As the tour moves along Georgia winds up watching her rival tour guide leading his group, group A, in fun activities that makes her own group jealous and distracted.

By the end of the flick, well, let me not give away the ending, even though it's fairly well telegraphed (heck, a blind person could likely see where things are going to go here).  Just be cautioned in advance that what you're watching, while cute, sweet, funny and somewhat entertaining, is also headed right where you expect.

Personally I enjoyed the film more than I thought I would, and found several laughs along the way, but again, not enough to inspire me to give this film a buy it recommendation.  Err on the side of caution, rent first if possible.  Those that have an appreciation for Greek history might enjoy this more, and certainly it's a date night flick that both male and female can enjoy, but multiple viewings seems to be a value that just isn't achieved here.",1257638400,2,1773,4.6

Disappointed with the cards life has dealt to her, she is uptight about her job much to the consternation of her group who want only to have fun rather than an education on ancient Greece.

Directed by Donald Petrie (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Miss-Congeniality/dp/B00005AAA9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Miss Congeniality</a>) and written by Mike Reiss (episodes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Simpsons/dp/B0024FAR52/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Simpsons</a>) in an extremely slapdash fashion, the story focuses on how Georgia has lost her passion for life (called ""kefi"" in Greek) and how it takes the motley tour group and her attraction to a studly bus driver named Poupi to rediscover it. Vardalos is a likeable presence, but her screen persona is getting redundant as her depiction of an everywoman becomes less credible with her every appearance. Richard Dreyfuss is really slumming here as an avuncular Jewish widow named Irv who acts as Georgia's wizened counselor in love and life. Yet, his Oscar-winning chops at least make his stereotype less offensive and brain-draining than the other actors, in particular, Harland Williams and Rachel Dratch as a mouthy American couple. As Poupi, Greek actor Alexis Georgoulis looks initially like Grizzly Adams, but love transforms him into smoldering eye candy as the movie progresses, which is really the whole point of his role. Rita Wilson shows up in a sentimental cameo as Irv's deceased wife since she and husband Tom Hanks served as executive producers (same as they did with ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"").

With cinematography by frequent Pedro Almodvar collaborator Jos Luis Alcaine, the Greek locations are refreshing, even though the environs around Valencia, Spain, apparently doubled for much of the country. The 2009 DVD oddly offers three separate commentary tracks from Vardalos, Petrie and Reiss. Vardalos' track is charming but marred by long pauses since she seems to miss someone prompting her to speak, while Petrie's is understandably more technical in nature. Surprisingly, the most entertaining commentary is provided by Reiss, a genuine comedy writer who convinces us that the story is based on his real-life experiences as part of a tour group. There are twelve minutes worth of deleted and alternate scenes, including an excisable alternate ending, and a comic three-minute featurette, ""Everybody Loves Poupi"", that Petrie created by re-editing some of the footage. Even though Vardalos is not at the helm this time (unlike the far more execrable ""I Hate Valentine's Day"" released a month later), I have a feeling that she has more talent than this movie allows her to display.",1256428800,5,3827,6.007326007326007

The guy puts it on, not knowing what the Greek characters say, and becomes an instant magnet for certain locals. Turns out it was implying he was searching for a boyfriend. The romantic thread is predictable as well. But, that's not to say people aren't going to find it to be an okay and entertaining way to spend an evening, especially if they like the genre and the premise.

Richard Dreyfuss is sweet as the funny sage and there are moments of melancholy that leave you quite moved.

The film has a wonderful title, storyline premise, along with the warm and intelligent character of Vardalos herself, but manages to flop nonetheless.  To be sure, it starts out funny and true, but not wanting to be that, it quickly 'morphed' into just another Hollywood sex-comedy with over-the-top characters.  A real disappointment for Ms. Vardalos's talent.  Unfortunately, nowadays people seem to equate sex with romance, plain and simple, not understanding that romance has more to do with the heart. And if this is the case, then the spectacular backdrop of ancient Greece was wasted in this movie.  (Yes, a few jokes on the sexual side would've been amusing, but to craft an entire film of them?--along with Richard Dreyfuss?)  If only the screen writer and director had spent more time on developing a thoughtful and understated script--and given Dreyfuss less of a speaking role--this movie could've been a real gem.

[Just as a side note, I felt the storyline was rather cheated by not beginning with Georgia (Vardalos)as the college professor she once was, in a university classroom, and then depicting her layoff before she ends up as a Greek tour guide, thereby showing the contrast between these two lives.]",1255132800,9,1481,4.967611336032388

And while the 'love interest' was a nice pick, he doesn't say much, and all of a sudden she realizes he'd gorgeous and has so much depth and heart? It wasn't a well developed script, they could have done a lot more with his character and made you really understand and be rooting for them as couple. Now he's just eye candy at this point.

At first Georgia is frustrated that the tourist are more interested in shopping and eating than looking at the historical buildings but with some help from Irv (the widower) played by Richard Dreyfuss she soon gets them interested in the history of Greece as well as finding love the with bus driver.

With this movie you will laugh.  This is the feel good movie of the year.

Some of the ""critics"" have panned it, but I feel the audiences will have the last laugh.  When we went to the theater everyone laughed throughout and applauded at the end. Remember, some of the `critics' also didn't like ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"".  If I recall, at least a few million people saw that one and continue to watch it and talk about it.

""My Life In Ruins"" is simply fun and lighthearted. Though this movie is not a deep, dark film that many `critics' thirst for, I assure you it will touch your heart and tickle your funny bone.  When was the last time you heard a critic use those words?  The movie showcases the romance, travel and wonder that is Greece.

""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" was an independent film that could stay in theaters longer to gain support.  This is how ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" became wildly successful.  Back then, theatergoers had the chance to spread word-of-mouth and cause the silent majority, who rarely go to movie theaters, to also support it.

""My Life In Ruins"" is a studio film (FOX Searchlight, kudos by the way!), so it needed to do well the very first weekend to avoid leaving theaters early.  Unfortunately, those same moviegoers who made ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" a runaway success may not have had the time to mobilize the troops again.

So if you wish more lighthearted, family fun in your future, this is your movie.  What's better than a fun, $[...]-vacation to Greece with your family?
