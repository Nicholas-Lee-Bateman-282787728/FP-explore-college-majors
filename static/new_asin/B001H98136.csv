8514911,4,B001H98136,"While The Nativity stories are some of the most beloved in the New Testament, they are also some of the most suspect. When critically evaluated, especially in tandem with parallel historic sources like Josephus, the data becomes seemingly irreconcilable. To aggravate matters further, much of the information presented in the Nativity stories seem incepted from mythological or even Pagan origins.

The lack of cohesion combined with apparent mythological constructs present Christian scholars with an enormous credibility issue. What if Gospel Nativity stories could be disproved as historic poppycock? What if they are shown to be mythological inventions designed to attract Roman or Pagan listeners? Would the remaining Gospel text be equally comprimised?

It is especially these weaknesses that sensationalist writers have attacked to call into question the foundations and historicity of the Christian story.

Enter ""The Census and the Star"".

Openly acknowledging the inconsistencies in the Nativity stories, both internally, and against peripheral sources, ""The Census and The Star"" evaluates the Nativity like never before. Using the latest evidence from archeology, paleo-astronomy, and excellent historic research, ""The Census and The Star"" reduces facts and data to solidify Nativity stories into a homogenous, and even likely, chain of events.

It explores the identity and methods of The Magi, the likely dates of the Census, the phenomenon of the Star of Bethlehem and the birth of Jesus, and revisits the writing of the 1st century historian Flavius Josephus. Combining these sources, a powerful argument emerges that the Nativity narratives are not fabricated or promotional in nature, but are in fact historically relevant and accurate sources that can be taken seriously.

If you are a Christian looking to solidify your knowledge and faith, or a curious historian wondering if NT Nativity stories are inherently trustworthy, ""The Census and The Star"" will satisfy both.

I can't emphasize the importance of grounding your understanding of Christianity by means of legitimate and historically documented study. In a world of often speculative, wild hypothesis, ""The Census and The Star"" presents solid research and solid conclusions based on demonstrable facts. Ideally, this presentation not only serve as a personal information source, but also acts as a wonderful educational film for any Christian Educational ministry. You won't regret the purchase!",1230163200,7,2472,5.646900269541779
