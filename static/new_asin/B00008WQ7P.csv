7987694,5,B00008WQ7P,"This DVD arrived from amazon a few days ago. Since recieving I have watched it every day. I never saw Sailor live, but now wish I had. My collection of DVDs amounts to about 500, of which about 15% are music DVDs. This is without doubt my favourite. If I have a criticism it that Georg deserves a higher profile than he gets. My favourite tracks are Glass of Champagne, Josephine Baker, and Sailor. The song ""Sailor"" comes with the original lyrics, which were changed for some audio recordings (presumably to be politically more correct), so the DVD is worth buying just for that. I cannot stress enough in a few words how brilliant this DVD is. The video colours look 70s although the band members have obviously aged since then. The professional delivery of their music is an outstanding advert as to why why ageism should be encouraged (the older the better). There is no doubt that these musicians really do know how to deliver.",1118620800,,932,4.620481927710843

With their wide and entertaining set from pop to waltzes and Latin-American songs they entertained the widely travelled fans from England, Germany, Holland, Denmark etc. The DVD includes all songs of this concert as well as bonus material (band documentary and history, unplugged songs).
