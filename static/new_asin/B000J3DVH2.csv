2666717,5,B000J3DVH2,"I have only seen the vhs version of this video, but I cannot wait to buy the DVD. I have loved Ms. Martinez's pottery for a very long time and am quite impressed with the documentation of her entire process.  This video shows her gathering and mixing the clay, making the pot with the coil method, decorating it with slip, and firing the pot. Ms. Martinez was an extrordinary woman. This video shows the talent, expertise, and love that she put into each pot she created.",1189036800,9,471,4.476744186046512

8148960,5,B000J3DVH2,"I have been showing this video to my ceramics students for over 30 years.  My first copy was a reel to reel tape, then a VHS, and now a DVD.  This is a great video that has withstood the test of time.  The kids are still enthralled by Maria's  technique and the lesson that it offers about the culture of Pueblo Indian artists.  The length is perfect for a set up, viewing, and discussion after.",1402444800,,395,4.213333333333333
8148961,5,B000J3DVH2,I love this DVD about Maria Martinez and her pottery. First saw it in a college pottery class and had to own it. She shows her techniques from collecting her clay to final polishing of the pottery.,1387065600,,197,4.351351351351352
8148962,5,B000J3DVH2,I always show my students this video when we are starting our unit on Ceramics! Maria is so gifted yet so humble. My students are so impressed with how she makes such beautiful pottery with no technology! This is the perfect film to show today's youth! We always follow this video with a primitive pottery project and firing!,1362614400,,325,4.620689655172414

8148964,5,B000J3DVH2,"This video is an outstanding introduction to the Indian pottery craft.  It is featured in Santa Fe's Indian Museum of Art and Culture.  Martinez is among Dillingham's Fourteen Families of Southwestern Pottery and considered a matriach of the art.  Having collected Native American pottery for years, this film clearly captures the essense of the craft, differentiating it from the growing commercial immitations.  Native artists collect the clay and temper from local, ancestral sources; they shape and polish their vessels by hand using tools passed between generations (i.e., no green-ware or potter's wheel here); like the clay, paints are homemade from native plants and minerals, joining with the clay to give each pueblo its unique qualities.  Firing is done in hand-assembled and tended fires, not kilns.  Pottery made this way is risky.  This summer a San Ildefonso potter, Erik Fender, told me that on a good day 70-75% of what he fires emerges intact or worthy of his approval.  In short, these are painstakingly hand-crafted pieces of art, not mass produced, commercially painted chatzky's for the tourist trap window.  To anyone fortunate enough to own a piece of Southwestern pottery, or contemplating buying a piece, this DVD is essential background.  Knowing how it is designed and made - the story behind the art - can only enhance the value of the pot.",1353974400,3,1369,5.153846153846154
8148965,5,B000J3DVH2,"this is must viewing for any admirer of pueblo pottery.  watching maria make a piece, from gathering the clay to pulling the finished piece out of the fire is astounding and one is left with the feeling that you have just witnessed a miracle.  i've watched it many times, and it never fails to amaze!  don't miss it.",1259971200,6,316,4.413793103448276
