6496840,5,B00LOCL8ZO,"I watched the first movie on tv through my computer, but couldn't find the other two.  I play all my favorite Christmas movies every year and knew that I'd want to be able to do the same with this series, especially since dogs are featured.  Now I can easily ""retrieve"" these movies next Christmas.",1453248000,2,298,4.5
6496841,5,B00LOCL8ZO,"Have owned the first movie for years....cute movie, enjoyable even if I had not little children to watch with me.  Caught the 2nd movie on TV during the holidays.  Thought I would purchase the seet and then watch the third movie.  Cute, wholesome movies...",1453248000,,256,4.7727272727272725
6496842,3,B00LOCL8ZO,First movie was ok but pretty predictable.  Second movie was less interesting...and I disliked the subplot of the 2 very young kids in a romance.  It was treated like an adult romance and turned me off completely.  I don't know at this point if I'll even bother with the 3rd movie.,1451865600,3,281,4.470588235294118

6496848,4,B00LOCL8ZO,"""A Golden Christmas"" is the best, in my opinion.  The other two, as sequels go, don't seem to be quite as original.  Nice collection though - family movies are so difficult to find these days.",1439683200,,192,4.457142857142857
