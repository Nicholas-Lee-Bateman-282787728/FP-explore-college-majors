8518489,1,B007JUVQ5W,"Do not trust this Dutch edition of Peacekeepers (aka Warriors).
The telefilm is 175 minutes long which is what you get if you buy the British release.
This Dutch edition says it's 170 mins but that is a lie. It's actually cut up into two parts of 75 mins each -- for total of 150 mins. Full half hour shorter.
Dutch DVDs of shows from U.K. do this routinely. They release the cut version that Dutch tv aired then pretend on DVD packaging that it's the same length as the U.K. Broadcast.
I learned the hard way. I mean cutting 30 mins out of a 3-hour movie radically changes it! Bloody idiots.
I've yet to look at the other 2 discs but I'm sure they are cut up too.",1476403200,,664,4.155038759689923
