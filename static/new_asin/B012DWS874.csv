7347610,5,B012DWS874,"It is a comedy, action, and nostalgia funny summer movies you've missed since you were a kid.",1438214400,,93,4.529411764705882
7347611,5,B012DWS874,"From Donkey Kong to Pac-man, from Adam Sandler to Josh Gad, this film really has anything you could imagine. Pixels is the funniest film of the year so far!

This is, of course, a comedy. However, along with that, there is a lot of drama and a hint of romance all packed into one huge adventure made for the entire family to enjoy.

The story features Brenner (Adam Sandler) who installs electronic equipment for a living. However, when an alien species attacks in the form of 1980s classic video games, Benner and his friends are the only ones capable of stopping them. And, to do so, they must beat the aliens, as if they were in the game.

This film is fantastic! The special effects are absolutely mind blowing. There are no boring scenes and some special effects are simply mind-blowing fantastic. I still can't figure out how they did it some of them. The acting is spot on. One scene I really liked is where two kids are competing on classic arcade machines with Donkey Kong loaded on them. The director makes it so you see them playing, their points and the screen as well as the reflection of the games in their eyes. It looks amazingzing!

My favorite scene is when they are facing Pac-Man in mini coopers that are designed to be the ghosts who chase and destroy Pac-Man. When Brenner is the only one left and Pac-Man just gets a power up which allows him to eat the ghosts, Brenner pulls of an awesome and insane stunts to run away and it is action packed and just stupendous to watch!

This film is good for kids, adults and gamers of course. I do believe people in their 30s and 40s would like this the most because they can understand a lot of the older game references. I don't think younger kids should watch this due to the adult language and mature references. I recommend it for ages 9 through 18 and older and give it 5 out of 5 pixelated stars.

7347612,5,B012DWS874,"I've read this movie lost money and I don't understand why people didn't like it.  Granted it isn't Oscar-winning material and the plot is a thread because the games are the stars but it's good escapism and entertaining because of that. Some of the younger generation may not recognize the games represented but they don't have to in order to enjoy the story.  Pac Man, Space Invaders, QBert, Centipede, and Donkey Kong as well as many other so-called classic games are represented...as well as Max Headroom and a few old TV series.

A bit Ghostbusters, a bit Independence Day...the CGIs upstage the actors and some of the invasion scenes are really first-rate. No one dies and there's a happy ending. Perhaps that's the reason it's gotten such low reviews? Personally I'm ready for a little Happily Ever After  about now.

This is one of the few movies I've scene which I'd like to own, and I dn't say that about just any film.

This movie was scene at a theater as a paid admission and no remuneration was involved in the writing of this review.",1438214400,4,1047,4.632432432432433
7347613,4,B012DWS874,"I really don't understand the hate for this movie. Was it a cinematic masterpiece? No. Was it entertaining? Definitely! The acting was typical of an Adam Sandler movie, as was the script. The plot and special effects were above average though.
I'm 22 and took my video game obsessed 5 year old brother to see it, and we were both thoroughly entertained. There were very few scary scenes, so I wouldn't have a problem taking any kid to see it. If you like movies like other Adam Sandler movies like ""Grown Ups"" and ""Blended"", then I'd say you would probably like ""Pixels."" It's simply silly, stupid fun, but I personally liked it.",1438214400,3,629,4.625
7347614,3,B012DWS874,"Was I entertained? You bet. Did I have fun? Did my son have fun? You bet. Did the movie stick with me afterward? No. Not really. Did my son and I have anything to talk about afterward? No. Not really. Although my son did make a Q*bert mask out of paper and scotch tape.

This is a strange movie to review because I can honestly say that I enjoyed the movie, but given the richness of possibilities that this movie possessed and the amazing job done on visual effects, the rest of the movie in my opinion sort of fell flat. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't outstanding either. The script was completely forgettable and predictable. The movie starts off with a period in time where our three adult leads were teenagers being introduced to the quarter-arcade craze and of course, Sandler's character, Brenner, is the super stud of gaming. After all, it is his movie studio that produced the movie, so it's only natural. I won't give what little there is away, but everything that will come to fruition in the movie is foreshadowed in this opening sequence from 1989.

The laughs are sometimes outstanding but for the most part ineffective. A line from Peter Dinklage's character Eddie about Martha Stewart and Serena Williams made me laugh out loud and for a good minute or so. Sandler played his part too much like Schwarzenegger instead of the goofball that he should have and the effects and premise deserved a better screenplay. Otherwise, this is a fun video rental movie that make for a fun night at home, but I won't go beyond that.",1438128000,6,1537,4.605839416058394

7347618,4,B012DWS874,"Wow, I can't believe so many people are hating this movie just because it has Adam Sandler in it. I think it has the potential to become a cult classic years down the road. The idea of video game aliens coming from outer space to attack us and the only hope to defend mankind are some video game nerds from the 80's who knew what gaming is all about is a great concept. I'm a Sandler fan, and there were actually times where Josh Gad and Peter Dinklage had funnier lines. This review WILL contain spoilers!

In 1982, Sam Brenner and Will Cooper count down the days to when the new video game arcade opens. They enter a video game competition and are up against Eddie Plant, who is a pro at playing Donkey Kong. Meanwhile, NASA sends up a time capsule to outer space with 1980's culture of video games and clips from tv shows as a sign of peace in hopes to make contact with alien life. (This is the Adam Sandler video game version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battleship/dp/B005LAIHPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battleship</a>)

33 years later, Sam Brenner works for a tech company and his best friend, Will is now the President of the United States. The world is soon attacked by video game characters because the aliens took the message the wrong way. They send down Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, Centipede, Mario, Space Invaders, Arkanoid and Tetris. Sam, Will, Eddie, and conspiracy theorist Ludlow must team up and stop the video game aliens from destroying and pixelating the world. This is a cheesy fun ride. Don't take it too seriously and you might enjoy it. I would definitely recommend PIXELS!!!",1437782400,3,1647,4.920863309352518

I'm not sure Kevin James should ever be president of anything, even in fiction. Also, Josh Gad boning Cubert is wrong on many levels. And don't even try to tell me ""Oh but Cubert changed into Lady Lisa so its OK"".. No. They had Cubert babies. Not cool.
BUT, the actual alien destruction by pixelation was pretty cool to watch. Michelle Monaghan is amazing and beautiful as always. And in true Tyrion fashion, Peter Dinklage's short stature doesn't prevent him casting a shadow over the rest of the cast with his performance.

So if you feel like turning off your brain for a while and watching a movie, this one is a solid pick.

7347800,5,B012DWS874,"I laughed, I cried, I was back in the first game room in Anchorage at Jewel Lake Bowl  in 1980 with all my friends and all the newest video games while watching this movie.  My kids stared as I giggled, screamed at the screen, and I cheered when certain songs came on or a video game long dormant in my memory made an appearance in PIXELS.  I want to be in a live version of DONKEY KONG. why hasn't anyone made this a reality show? seriously. I would watch that.  I loved this movie.  I miss making a night of it going to the arcade with my folks to play stand up video games. all the lights flashing, the music blaring, my folks were always terrible at the games but we had so much fun.  This movie should have been marketed to those of us who were on the front lines of the video revolution. I had never heard of it till this year. if I could I would go back in time for one more night of Centipede, Ms. Pac Man, Galaga, Frogger, Donkey Kong, Stargate, with my brother, friends and my folks, circa 1980, anchorage Alaska, - thank you for Pixels, it brought up great memories and when I want to relive those I will pop in Pixels and go for a ride down memory lane. great family fun flick!",1505606400,3,1189,4.103448275862069

7347822,3,B012DWS874,"Its fashionable to bash the current slew of Adam Sandler comedies, and not without justification.  Yet PIXELS doesnt fully deserve the knee-jerk negativity it often receives.  Its one of Sandlers better recent efforts, faint praise that it is. While Im sure a score of video-game references went right over my head, I did enjoy the satire of standard science fiction invaders from space cliches and was impressed by the production design.
Critics can carp, with good reason, about certain characters and plot elements but at its heart PIXELS is an amiable, defiantly preposterous comedy that delivered more laughs than I had expected.  Gamers and younger viewers are welcome to add a star or two to this rating.  Theyre the ones who will really appreciate this movie.",1502496000,,767,5.063492063492063

For some totaly un-understandable reason SONY Pictures put a German DTS MA 5.1 Sound on it which is ""ok"" but in parallel the put an Englisch ""AURO"" Sound on it.
Whoever can Play AURO or has a native Setup for it... anyway.

I liked the movie so much that I searched the Internet for ATMOS versions as my home Theater has a 7.2.4 Setup for Atmos/DTSX
Found this version and finally got the time to watch it.
Surprise: the 3D disk does NOT have an Atmos track, even though the Atmos-logo is printed prominently on the back.
Don't get my wrong, the Englisch DTA MA 5.1 is way better than the German one! But also here the upmixing to ceiling Speakers kind of suck.
Then I looked at the 2D disk that came in the same box.
Finally there it is Dolby Atmos with TrueHD 7.1 core in all it's glory!
Now this is the Sound the movie deserves!
Mind blowing and earth shaking!
extremely dynamic with great sourround and ceiling Sound. definately one refference now!

Can anyone explain what Intention Sony has with the strategy?
3D-sound only on the 2D video?!? How stupid is this?!?

My inner schlub is the same age as his inner schlub, about 6 and a half years old, and he's a life-long major reminder of my dire psychological predicament.

Meanwhile, most youngsters should love this film, but some of the parts are only fitting for the entertainment sensibilities of a child who has not yet fully mastered language.  Makes me squirm, yep, the ""silly"" can get painful, but I can't help watching Sandler's films...well, most of them.

7347924,4,B012DWS874,"I thought for SURE this movie would be absolutely worthless, but I have to admit, I was tempted to give it 5-stars, as it does exactly what it should do.  It plays to it's target audience.  If you're an old school gamer from the dawn of videogames, or simply a retro fan, this movie will do it for you.  If not, it most likely won't at all, lol.  But, at the end of the day, a 5-star movie is one that changes your life.  If an Adam Sandler movie ever changes your life, just end it.  If you saw Happy Gilmore, and went on to win the Stanley Cup, understand that you are the single largest walking paradox reality has ever witnessed, and that can't be safe.  That said, I give a Stephen Colbert tip of the hat to Adam Sandler for royally not sucking.  Not ""not royally sucking""... ""royally not sucking"".  There is a difference.  It's really good, man.  You are still of great value to the world, so go out there and just bathe in the oceans of babes surely breaking down your front door, like a tsunami of raw desire.  You killed it.  /grats

The plot is really bad. All of the references to video games are really sad (generally referencing games from the incorrect time periods) and most nostalgic references are lost since they completely ignore the source material for a ""Look, it's X, remember X?"". Character development is non-existent and most of the characters are really annoying and immature. The effects are nice, but the rest of the movie is just plain awful including most of the acting which is completely phoned by everyone but Peter Dinklage.

You shouldn't expect much from it either, it's meant for kids and their parents who grew up in the 80s.
That being said, a lot of the dialog that was supposed to be funny just came off as annoying and really forced.

Also the film industry needs to stop adding weird CGI characters to movies like Qbert and Jar Jar Binks. NO ONE LIKES JAR JAR.

7348654,1,B012DWS874,"I saw ""Pixels"" for the first time last night. Like most of the critics, I didn't like it. In fact, I hated it. It took me a while to figure out why, though. When I realized it, it hit me with a ton of bricks.

Pixels is nerdsploitation.

Nerdsploitation is the term for movies and TV shows that exploit nerds. Blaxploitation movies of the seventies pretended to be about showing love for black culture when they really just used the worst stereotypes in order to make money. Nerdsploitation pretends to be about showing love for nerd culture while using the worst stereotypes of nerds to exploit them.

In case you're not familiar with it, Pixels is a science fiction comedy about classic videogames. The idea is that aliens found a videotape of people playing videogames in the eighties, thought they were real, and sends living versions of classic games to destroy Earth. The only ones who can stop them are a group of classic videogame experts. Armed with exotic weapons, the gamers shoot giant centipedes, race cars against Pac-Man, and jump over barrels in a gigantic version of Donkey Kong. It's an Adam Sandler movie, which means it has a lot of crude humor, dumb jokes, sexism, and cameos of all Sandler's friends who can't get a job anywhere else. But I'll put all that aside.

What bothered me most about the movie is that it should have been a celebration of eighties nostalgia. Anyone who walked into an arcade and dropped a quarter into a slot would see the appeal of the concept, but it was wasted. Pixels could have been all about how gaming culture has changed. People who played games used to be made fun of, but now videogame culture is everywhere. But mainly, it should have been a classic underdog story. The ones who seemed to be wasting time then are here now to put those skills to good use and save the world.

But that's not what we got.

Sandler's character Sam Brenner is the hero, but he's portrayed as a pathetic moron whose life fell apart because he couldn't play videogames. He works for a company called Nerd Brigade, which I assumed was a riff on Geek Squad. And that makes sense. I mean, he's good at technology, right? Geek Squad does troubleshooting on computers and electronic equipment. It's a classic nerd job.

But no, Brenner just installs television sets, which doesn't take that much technical skills to do. Really, he has no real skills, and no ambition. He's what someone in the eighties who looked down on videogames would imagine the players growing up to be. And while people talked about how Brenner has ideas and inventions, we don't see any evidence of that. It would have been good to have Sandler's character open up, maybe even invent some weapons to fight the aliens. But no, someone else creates all the weapons. Brenner just grabs and uses them.

By the end of the movie, Brenner and his team defeats the aliens and saves the day, but he still seems like a loser. Just a loser who can handle a light cannon. And the only reason he gets the job is his best friend happens to be the president of the United States (seriously).

The other gamer characters were even worse, One (Josh Gad) was a glasses-wearing conspiracy nut who literally lived in his mother's basement, and treated videogames like his friends. The other (Peter Dinklage) was a sleazeball ex-convict who thought he was loved while he was really hated. All the gamer characters were portrayed as losers then and losers now. There was no love for them. Just contempt.

Even worse, the movie misrepresented videogame skills. All the gamers kept talking about patterns as if being good at videogames is just about memorizing patterns. It's not. There's also eye-hand coordination and multitasking. But that didn't happen. At one point, Brenner complains that he can't play modern videogames because there are no patterns. That made no sense to me. I don't know anyone who loved videogames in the eighties who doesn't love videogames today. All the same skills apply. That made the fondness for videogames that should have been the entire premise of the movie seem cheap and hollow, restricted to a love of Pac-Man and Asteroids, and shunning the next thirty years of technology.

The bottom line is that the movie felt like it was made by someone who didn't understand nerd culture. The collective message was more about saying, ""Hey, here's Pac-Man. Hey, here's Q-Bert"" without knowing why seeing them was so much fun. It's like they said, ""Let's make Ghostbusters with videogames"" and moved on without thinking deeper than that.

The wife and kids loved Pixels, and it made a surprising amount of money, so I know I might be in the minority. But I was an arcade gamer in the eighties, so I should have loved Pixels. Instead, the whole movie made me feel ugly inside, like I had gone to a party claiming to be for nerds, but where everyone wore fake glasses and pocket protectors and fake buckteeth while saying, ""See? I'm a nerd!"" It felt like Adam Sandler and Kevin James just pointed at the camera and laughed at me for two hours.

And all the good stuff was in the trailer.",1470873600,2,5096,4.680446927374302

Sure it's no plot puzzle, but the special effects are AMAZING and the laughs are clean with that Sandler element of the ridiculous.  Michelle Monaghan also does moms proud.

(***There is some obvious product placement, Mini Cooper S and Dan Ackroyd's Crystal Head Vodka are gratuitously plonked upfront and centre and for the obscure product is New Zealand's Cloudy Bay Chardonnay which is straight up my fav Chardonnay that used to be not so easy to find??? and frankly a perfect pairing to drink whilst crying over a guy... in a closet - that got the biggest laugh out of me.)",1470787200,,802,4.580419580419581

I've recently become a soft fan of some of Adam Sandler's silly stuff framed more for kids (""Bedtime Stories"" specifically). Well, this movie underlines why I had ignored Sandler's movies from the early days. It's too bad that now he has (had?) the money and power to throw at (throw away) an ultra-expensive visual effects laden piece of crap. Honestly, if you have that much to spend on the production value of a movie, can't someone hire a good writer? Or even a so-so to crappy writer would have been better. Geeze...hold a contest or pay a team a few million. Dump your 'pals.' It's actually unwatchable. I just orbited into the living room every once in a while when my 9 year old was watching it. And no, it's not really a movie for 9 year olds. It's a movie made by a 12 year old trapped inside a mega multimillionaire middle aged man's body. An adult spoiled brat who can have whatever narcissistic fantasy he wants placed on the ""big screen."" I'm just wondering if this streak can go on much longer. How much gas is left in the Happy Madison machine? Can they coast for a while? Will Sony keep giving them a push uphill? Will they say, ""it's okay son, take the Maserati?"" I'm curious to see what comes of the mega deal made with Netflix and Sandler. Let's all brace ourselves. Oh, a final thought-- Chris Columbus, shame on you. You've made a lot of crap too, but I thought you finally grew up. What a waste of time, talent, resources, money, and PIXELS!",1468800000,,1593,4.421768707482993

7348899,5,B012DWS874,"As long as you go into this movie with an understanding that it is beyond ridiculous in every possible way, it's incredibly entertaining. If for some odd reason you go into this thinking it'll be a plausible story made into an Oscar worthy film, you're going to be severely disappointed.

To give you an idea of what I mean when I say ""beyond ridiculous"", they try to reason with Pac Man to get him to understand why its wrong to eat New York City. That's the level of ridiculous that we're dealing with here. As long as you can get on board with that, this movie is major fun.

I thought this looked stupid when I saw the original trailer for it. And it was definitely stupid, but I enjoyed every stupid minute of it! There were multiple times when I was laughing out loud in my living room. (That's LOL'ing for the texters)

The plot is pretty obvious. Video games attack Earth. Only a team of video game nerds can win the battle. It's all laid out in the trailer. There is no deception. That's exactly what the actual plot turns out to be.

The movie is funny. It's got good action scenes. Toru Iwatani (creator of Pac Man) makes an appearance. You get to see Q-Bert in a tuxedo. I mean its got literally everything!

Most importantly it's just fun. It's a light hearted all around fun movie.

And don't forget to watch the closing credits. This doesn't spoil any plot details. But they recreate the entire movie during the closing credits in 8 bit video game graphics. (8 bit is what the original Nintendo Entertainment System used, for you millennials out there who consider the Wii to be ancient technology.) And they do a really good job of it too!

The video game battles in this movie were pretty cool and the ending and certain scenes could have been done much better.

This movie had a great little story that only Adam Sandler and his cast of characters could portray. This took me down memory lane big time. I'm an 80's kid and I remember so vividly many of the arcade games and summers like this movie. It made me proud to be an ""old school"" gamer. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that misses the good old days in the 80's and wants a video game time warp there.

If you don't have a sense of humor or enjoy the duo Adam Sandler and Kevin James together, you'll likely be disappointed.  Kevin James as President in a movie, yeah, it's that kind of humor.  Some of the name calling is actually hilarious and there were a few zingers I thought were great and have since implemented when tossing out some sarcasm.  Now I didn't grow up with the greatness of Atari games but my wife did and it brought back some fond memories and she too had a few good laughs.  But for me, the nonchalant name calling was great.  The integration of some of the greatest Atari favorites I thought was also well-done.  We've watched Pixels a few times now and still laugh each time.",1462406400,4,867,4.308641975308642

7349308,5,B012DWS874,"Oh my gawl... so many reviews out there had me hesitating to watch this movie let alone buy it. Adam Sandler isn't exactly my favorite go-to actor, so that halted my watching as well.
First, things I liked.
 It was funny. If you remember the 80's video games or even if you don't, it was funny.
Adam Sandler did great. He was funny and I really enjoyed his character. It has more of a slapstick comedy feeling to it more so than just a comedy. So, you have to appreciate the humor to laugh.
I also appreciated the fact that there was no on-screen sexual content that seems to happen all too frequently even in a comedy that has no need for it.

Things I didn't like.
Language. Although there wasn't as much as I anticipated, there was still a few curse words that didn't have to be there, but because it was more spread out than most AS movies it was easier to overlook.
Plot hole: (spoiler) if there was supposed to be a trophy after each win, then why wasn't there a third trophy at the end, thus making it so Qbert didn't have to change into Lady Lisa. That part annoys me.

All in all a fun movie!",1460505600,2,1101,4.208530805687204

This was one of my first 3D movies that I purchased for my new 3D TV. The 3D experience in itself is awesome even though it's a GIMMICK, but that's a whole other topic on a whole other level. Being an 80's born kid I can definitely say I recognize all of the video game based characters. If you were born in the 90's and or above then you might not really know some of them. Not that it really matters, but it doesn't seem to click if you don't know who they are. The movie is just a movie, and I really should've just rented it. But thought for $16 it was a bargain.

I would recommend this movie to families unless you are super strict. It was a family movie but had a little violence, bad language, and kissing.

7349384,2,B012DWS874,"Honestly, it wasn't as bad as I had expected - and that's unfortunate. The way I see it, there are two ways to go with a film like this: Either make it a huge summer blockbuster or a campy nostalgic romp. This film is neither of those things. Do yourself a favor and just watch the short film that inspired this one, there's only about 5 minutes of quality content in Pixels anyway.

Additionally, if you're looking for the Adam Sandler that you're familiar with and his character styles that made him famous, steer clear of this one. I personally don't like Adam Sandler's comedic roles (Billy Madison, Waterboy, et al), but even as a non-fan, I can tell he's just phoning it in this time around. I really couldn't tell through the whole film if he was trying to be funny, trying to portray a serious role, or just trying to be himself, but whatever he was trying to do, this oatmeal-bland performance was weak.

I was a little concerned that this film was going to be poking fun at video game and nerd culture. I think the only positive thing I can say about the film is that it didn't do that. It was clear that somewhere in the creative process, there was someone with a love of old arcade video games. Unfortunately, it seems that it got filtered through a lot of people who don't care and have very little knowledge on the subject so it gets watered down and there are a lot of ""creative interpretations"" (read that as inaccurate interpretations) of how things work. However, it all seemed to stem from ignorance as opposed to disdain for the culture.

On the plus side, Peter Dinklage was pretty good at being an arcade bad-boy.",1459209600,,1635,4.47986577181208

Unless you're a person who watches your favorite movie over and over I would say rent it as opposed to buy it.

The plot of the movie is that aliens misinterpret video-feeds of 1980's arcade games as a declaration of war against them, they attack the Earth.

They use old games like PAC-MAN, Donkey Kong, Galaga, Centipede and Space Invaders as models for their various assaults.

President Will Cooper (Kevin James) has to call on his childhood best friend whovis also an 80s video game champion Sam Brenner (Adam Sandler) to lead a team of old-school arcaders to defeat the aliens and save the planet.",1457568000,2,774,4.627737226277373

After seeing Kevin James was the president (Seriously?) the movie just went straight downhill from there. I just felt like as it went along, it just got more & more & more boring. The only good thing about Pixels was seeing all the old video game characters, remembering the old video games I use to play & the 1s I didn't recognize, trying to figure out what games they were from. God, this movie stunk. I cant think of enough bad things to say about it. If somebody told me to come up with 1 funny moment from the movie, Id say the scene where the lady is in her closet, crying over husband, drinking wine from a sippy cup & Adam Sandler walks in. Other than that, nothing. If you're thinking of watching Pixels, Id tell you to skip this movie & find something better to do with your time",1456876800,2,921,4.2988505747126435

The cast was good and the special effects are top notch, but even though it is science fiction it is simply filled with too many implausible moments to draw you in.

So much retro throw back for this 39 year old plus Adam Sandler is still a very good comedy actor in my opinion. If I had to criticize one thing of the movie... it was that weirdo freak character who buddied up along side Adam's character. Not the little guy but the other slob... Josh Gad. His character personalization was totally not needed. IF they do in fact make a sequel... PLEASE leave his character out! But by all means bring back Lady Lisa lol,1455926400,,523,4.346938775510204

7349546,3,B012DWS874,"Usually, when I see a preview for a disaster or alien invasion flick, I pass on it.  That genre just isn't my thing.  I feel the same when I see a preview for an Adam Sandler flick since the previews for those usually annoy me.  But I had to make an exception for Pixels.  A film with classic video games  the games I grew up playing  come to life?  I knew I had to watch it.  Sadly, it wasn't as good as I hoped it would be.

Back in the 80s, Brenner was one of the top video game players of the era thanks to his innate ability to recognize the patterns in the games.  However, that didn't translate to a well-paying job as the Brenner of today (Adam Sandler) makes his living installing home theater and electronics equipment.

However, one day the US Naval base in Guam is attacked by a mysterious enemy, and Brenners best friend Cooper (Kevin James), who also happens to be President of the United States, calls on Brenner for help.  He recognize the pattern for what it is, Galaga.  With help from conspiracy nut Ludlow (Josh Gad) and his old video game nemesis Eddie (Peter Dinklage), he must help repel attacks from an alien force using 1982 video games against us.  Can this unlikely group of geeks succeed?

I had to smile as each new video game enemy was revealed.  These were some of my favorite games as a kid, and I could spend hours playing them on my Atari 2600.  (I didn't spend as much time in arcades playing the real games, but I loved my Atari.)  There are some great lines based on that nostalgia, and the battles were great.  Heck, the fight against Pac-Man alone will make any member of my generation smile.

However, the nostalgic fun was covered in the haze of usual Adam Sandler immaturity.  The main characters are just what youd picture if youve seen one of his movies (or the previews) with the typical immature but supposed to be funny antics, and the movie is filled with PG-13 level sexual jokes.  I often found these parts painful to watch; I certainly didn't find them funny, and the very little bit of predictable character development we got wasn't enough to save this aspect of the movie.  I will give the actors credit for being good in their various roles, I just didn't like the characters.

I was very impressed with the effects.  Naturally, there were a lot of them in the film, and they were very well done.  I especially appreciated the fact that the effects for the video game characters were very blocky, perfectly representing the level of graphics we had back in the day.

Do I regret watching Pixels?  Not in the least.  I think anyone who enjoyed playing the video games of the 80s is going to want to watch it at some point for the pure nostalgia of it.  However, the immature characters will keep me from rewatching the film.",1455580800,2,2778,4.432806324110672

I give it a 3.5 stars though because it is very predictable as far as the lead, Sandler, goes. His movies are all the same, and that is ok. However, a little more originality would go a long way. The supporting actors run circles around him in this one. It is worth a look, but I would rent it first... If you love it, then pull the trigger...

In an odd way this has a real cult classic feel to it though that is kind of fun.",1454371200,,542,3.9724770642201834

Not five stars worth in my opinion, but my opinion is my own and you are welcome to your own opinion. It was, i thought, aimed a adolescent boys, but i managed to look past that and appreciate the CG effects, which were pretty well done. The premise was a little hokey, but able to be overlooked when the opportunity presents to watch golden oldie video game characters try to squish humans. And it was mildly funny.

7349729,3,B012DWS874,"I can just imagine the pitch that was made to the executives at Sony Studios....

""We have this great idea for a movie where aliens intercept a time capsule filled with 1980s arcade classic games and misinterpret it as an acknowledgement of war on Earth.""

Wow!  What a great idea that must have seemed.  If only they didn't turn it into an Adam Sandler movie.

As thus, Pixels is a film that's mostly fun, filled with great promise, but unevenly executed thanks to the fact that it has been dumbed down into a Sandler and company vehicle.

The film opens during the 1980s arcade world championships where a young Sam Brenner clearly shows his skills as an ace video game player.  Sam has the unique ability to recognize programming patterns within arcade classics and commit them to memory.

Jump ahead some 30 years later where Sam (Adam Sandler) is being summoned to the White House by his childhood friend, and now U.S. President (Kevin James), after an alien invasion has taken place.  When Sam recognizes the invasion patterns match that of the video games he mastered as a teen, he gets his rag-tag team of washed-up gamers together to take on the space invaders.

On the surface, Pixels serves as a fantastic homage to 80s video games that explode onto the screen in often-impressive 3D.  However, it's been completely dumbed down into an Adam Sandler film filled with bad acting, only mildly amusing humor, and a premise that is probably more interesting to a gamer from that era than anyone else who might be viewing.  It's hard to believe that Chris Columbus, the man behind Home Alone and Mrs. Doubtfire couldn't do anything more interesting with the script he was provided with.

Pixels sports an above average transfer with razor-sharp detailed images and convincing green screen effects.  Like every other 3D film produced today, this is an effort that was upconverted in post production.  However, as such, I was fairly impressed with its results.  In fact, the 3D makes a barely tolerable film into something that, at times, is immensely enjoyable. Alien attacks take form of crude graphic classic video games, all presented with immersive depth and pronunciation.  The film's finale, a Donkey Kong sequence, becomes particularly impressive when viewers get to watch it in multiple dimensions.

I can immediately understand the budget constraints for a film like this being lensed natively in 3D.  It's sad that this opportunity was missed, as Pixels is the perfect candidate for exploiting in-yo'-face gimmickry.  The best that we get here are a few minor forward projections, with most of them being mere slip-overs outside of the widescreen bars. Downward camera angles take particular advantage of displaying depth, and I particularly liked how the video game score overlays projected themselves outwards towards the viewer.  With all that in mind, the 3D release of this film is a step-up from its 2D counterpart.

Very disappointing to see that this 3D presentation was not accompanied with a Dolby Atmos or even 7.1 soundtrack (which is available only on the 2D release).  This is a hugely missed opportunity for the film's engaging mix that we only get to experience in DTS-HD MA 5.1.  The good news is that the filmmakers have taken advantage of filling each of the channels with all-encompassing effects that hit you from every direction.  The inclusion of a toe-tapping 80s music soundtrack is quite immersive as well. This is genuinely one of the better mixes I have heard of late -- so convincing that I was actually fooled into believing that my rear channels weren't supporting the efforts.

Pixels comes with three 3D trailers: The Walk, Hotel Transylvania 2 and Goosebumps.  Both 3D and 2D Blu-ray discs arrive in lenticular cardboard outer packaging.  A digital HD copy is included.

Take note of the clever retro 80s Blu-ray menu design when pausing and fast-forwarding.  A very savvy addition by the Sony team.

I have made it known many times that I am not a fan of Adam Sandler.  I don't generally find his films funny or entertaining.  It is my opinion that Pixels could have been a monstrous, more successful effort if it had not been dumbed down as it has been.  Despite all its shortcomings, it may surprise you to find that I actually enjoyed parts of this film.  The 80s action sequences are wonderfully accomplished, and look quite extraordinary in 3D.

In all, I give Pixels a recommendation, though I think it will appeal more to those that remember the era of Madonna and Max Headroom than those that grew up with Playstation and Xbox.  This is one of those films that actually is saved by its 3D presentation, and quite frankly, I don't see how it can be enjoyed any other way.",1453075200,,4727,4.856429463171036

As an adult gamer, I have to admit that there are very few movie adaptations based on video games that are handled with the same care that goes into the source material.  While Pixels wasn't perfect, it was a very solid film and I'll be proud to have it be part of my film collection.  This is an homage to the 80's in every way.  The characters, dialogue, and settings are spot on, and this movie is a love letter to anyone who remembers the golden age of the arcade.  If you're a fan of 80's movies you'll also feel right at home here in the exact same way Grind-house (of which I am also a fan) made it's brief comeback recently.  The source material was handled with respect and honored classic video games in every way.  The jokes were ""silly"" and very funny, but that is what one should expect with a film like this.  If you were expecting a cerebral Woody Allen script, you'll be disappointed, but in all honesty you probably weren't thinking too clearly if that is why you wanted to see Pixels.

Like Jim Carrey movies, I just don't find Sandler's comedy funny anymore.  The story line for this one seemed pretty cool, having grown up in the 80's in the arcades.

7349848,5,B012DWS874,"This is certainly one of the years top movies, im a huge Sandler fan, still one of the best comedy stars after all these years in the business, pixels has a great original story that's been begging to be done for a long time and now we have the technology to do it justice, the movie starts with Adam Sandler and Kevin James as kids in the 80's, Sandler is something of a prodigy and becomes one of the greatest video game players in the world, he enters a competition that is being videoed by NASA to put out into space, Cut to many years later and the world comes under attack by Aliens who took the message the wrong way, they take form of the retro Video game characters and begin their destruction of the world, now Sandler and his team of players are the only ones who can save us. The cast is perfect as always all the usual faces are here plus new ones, Adam Sandler, Kevin James (as the president Genius) Josh Gad, Peter Dinklage, Michelle Monaghan are all great, the visual effects cant be flawed, all the retro characters have been done justice and look fantastic, Pac-man, Centipede, Donkey Kong, Space invaders, plus brief glimpses of many other characters like paperboy and even Mario, if your a big fan of the 80's or fall into the age group of remembering the good old days of video games you will love this movie, its very funny too, lots of gags for you to spot that younger watchers won't get, young or old or Sandler fan or not this is a great film that's certainly unique and very retro in its style which makes a change. The open and close credits are all pixel retro style too and look great, a lot of great detail has gone into the design of the movie, the soundtrack is great too, make sure you see pixels!!!

7349854,4,B012DWS874,"This was a surprise to me.  I'm not typically an Adam Sandler movie fan, but I really enjoyed this.  Some of the younger generation may not get the 80's jokes and video games, but they would still enjoy it.  Good story writing here and fantastic special effects with giant video game characters attacking Earth.  Hilarious moments with the comedic writing here, too.  If you see this film for one reason, see it for Josh Gad.  He will have you rolling with laughter.  He's an actor that you basically just turn on the camera for and let him loose.

Kid Factor:  A few surprisingly raunchy/adult jokes in this film.  For a movie that appears to be aimed squarely at kids, this feels more geared toward adults at times.  Because of the saucy jokes alone (not due to violence or language), this film is not suggested for kids under 10.",1451174400,,832,4.554054054054054

Josh Gad had a few funny lines, but the rest of the cast was really phoning in every second.

7349897,4,B012DWS874,"I remember some of the games from this movie from my childhood and for me that bit of nostalgia was worth the viewing experience alone. Granted my version of Donkey Kong was on some hand sized thing that only had Donkey Kong on it and nothing else, and had graphics that weren't really colour but different greys that resembled the graphics that told you what time it was on digital watches. You don't need to be old enough to have played these games but it probably does help.

Adam Sandler usually plays the same character in each movie he is in, and nothing changes with this one, where in his childhood he was almost the world's best arcade gamer, and now is, you're going to be real surprised by this, seen by society as a bit of a loser.  Kevin James likewise seems to have only one character card to act out, I thought when it is revealed he is the President of the US we might see something else, but unfortunately we don't.  A film with an unbelievable premise really needs believable people in the character roles.  The bumbling klutz character as the President, just didn't work.  Josh Gad rounds out the trio and again plays the same character we've seen countless times before.  Peter Dinklage's character who is in the flashback childhood and joins the team for the final battles, at least adds something new when he's brought  into the team, and it's nice to see he's never referred to as being a midget, little person, small or anything like this like a lot of his roles. In Pixels, he's just referred to an judged on his character's good and bad traits.

The film, especially once it gets going is a lot of visual fun.  The attacking Earth through video game characters didn't exactly make sense but it didn't really need to, to enjoy the film.  Besides the video games there's plenty of old TV show characters clips who relay messages from the aliens (the shows and games were part of a time capsule sent into space that the aliens misinterpret as an act of war).  Those clips are a lot of fun, although you might not know them all. I have no idea who the ones were who gave the message after the PacMan attack.

I think you probably knew what you were going to get with Pixels, and it delivers exactly what you think it will.  It likely won't ever win any awards but this type of movie isn't supposed to either.",1450483200,,2330,4.44131455399061

I love that the movie is accessible to a general audience but that there are some references in there that only hard core nerds will get.

Pixels is inferior fare with one tired cliche after another. As per Hollywood standard, most production money was spent on the special effects department (from the appearance, full of kids fresh out of school without basic behavior of materials, i.e. REAL WORLD, knowledge), and none on good writers who can produce an intelligent story with sympathetic, well-developed characters.

7349927,3,B012DWS874,"With the exception of Hotel Transylvania, this movie is better then a lot of Adam Sandler's recent work. Still I think it really falls short of what a movie with this premise should be.

On the pro side for the movie the CG effects work really well.

And Peter Dinklage is just fantastic.

On the Con side...

This movie makes use of several of what I now consider Adam Sandler standard plot points. Sandler playing an adult character who doesn't exactly have his act together who must now take on a momentous task. Meeting a hot woman early on who clearly has no interest in him that he woos throughout the movie by showing her what a nice guy he is. Having a point in the 3rd act where everyone is angry with him for something he didn't mean to do or was framed and he has to redeem himself.

That last point was particularly annoying because then the army General in charge kicks the Gamers (Sandler and his friends) out of the operation even though they have shown to be the only ones with the knowledge of video game patterns and the skills to beat the aliens.

Beyond the fights with the video games, the rest of the story is pretty forgettable.

There are several plot points that don't make sense when you stop to consider them.

1) If the aliens were basing their attacks on video games they received in that transmission then why is it during the Caterpillar challenge they broke away from the game's pattern?

2) In the 4 Challenge, why did the aliens take the player character role of Pac Man when previously they had taken the role of game enemies?

3) How could Peter's character have entered a cheat code for a video game into his car? How did it make his car super fast? If the cheat code normally makes Pac Man super fast then why would it work on the car that represents the orange ghost? How did he use that code in the video game tournament when he was a kid without anyone noticing? Did the script writers know that there were no cheat codes in the arcade Pac Man games?

4) Why did the human have this big victory celebration after they won the 2nd match? Sure I can understand a lot of cheering and congratulations going around but shouldn't you save the Black Tie ball until after the 3rd match and you won it all?

5) In the big video game assault at the end the aliens release characters from Game Boy games that didn't appear until the 90s.

6) If the humans cheated to win the 4th match, why did the aliens allow them a final all or nothing deal? Technically the humans were defeated by losing the first 2 matches and being disqualified by cheating in the 4rth. Why announce the humans had lost due to cheating, send out a big attack force, and then allow them one last chance?

7) The Qubert thing was just creepy.

So to recap, I wouldn't call this movie bad, but it just has a number of problems with the plot coupled with characters that I couldn't invest myself in that bogs it down between the intense segments that are the video game fights.",1449878400,2,2976,4.35623869801085
7349928,2,B012DWS874,"ll be honest I really wanted to like this movie, as I'm a huge gamer myself, and I wanted Adam Sandler to be in something good again. This was not that movie.

In all honesty the game scenarios when they face Pac-Man and Donkey Kong were cool, however everything else in this movie was dreadful. The script was terrible, the women characters are just there to stand and look pretty, Sandler was unfunny and looked like he just wanted a paycheck, everyone else seemed to be phoning it in, but Peter Dinklage was the only person who was funny the whole time and even that isn't saying much, as he only made me laugh twice. Kids might enjoy this movie, but kids will enjoy anything.

Pixels had a great idea, but the dialogue was not good at all, the acting was awful, and the characters had zero chemistry. Overall Pixels is a complete waste of time, money and effort. It could have been good cause the Video game bosses were the only good part, but in the end its just another bad movie on Adam Sandlers resume",1449878400,,1009,4.390374331550802

7349938,2,B012DWS874,"Writing off Adam Sandler movies as probable train wrecks before you even see them isn't just a common practice, its also a wise one. For a star who seems to be fully entrenched in that phase of his career where hell sign on to any project as long as theres a paycheck, Adam Sandler has shown hes still capable of doing more than his usual underdog hero schtick, he just doesnt want to. Films outside his comfort zone like Punch Drunk Love, Reign Over Me, and Funny People now happen with increasing rarity, and instead were now getting a non-stop parade of formulaic garbage like The Cobbler, Blended, Grown Ups, Thats My Boy, and so on. Pixels is now the latest atrocity on that list, and though it gets a couple laughs, the rest of the film is a wasteland of duds in a story based on a short film from 2010 (which deserved a better feature film adaptation than Sandler has given it).

Did anyone really think this was a great idea outside of the Happy Madison braintrust? Using the same writers that have helped churn out some of Sandlers best and worst hits, Pixels makes Sandler down-on-his-luck tech support agent from not-Best Buy, Brenner, who still smarts from a childhood loss in the arcade game championships to a cocky rival gamer called Eddie the Fire Blaster (Peter Dinklage). His job installing big screen TVs in random peoples homes introduces him to imminent divorcee Violet (Michelle Monaghan) who also ends up on Brenners team to stop a race of aliens that use classic 8-bit arcade characters to wage war on our world. Also on their team is Eddie, Brenners childhood friend and conspiracy theorist Ludlow (Josh Gad), and, eventually, the President of the United States (Kevin James). Its important to note, casting Kevin James as the illiterate President of the United States might be the films best joke.

Shoved into the margins is a ridiculous amount of talent thats all wasted by a script that did little to expand on the original short, including Dan Aykroyd, Jane Krakowski, Sean Bean, Brian Cox, Serena Williams, Martha Stewart, and more. If you were to cut out the usual Happy Madison folks (Sandler, James, Nick Swardson), and get some writers who haven't settled for repeating the same mediocrity over and over, you could make a much better film with the talent left over. Instead, we have to watch Monaghan, Dinklage, and Brian Cox sludge through this embarrassment for 90 minutes. While I don't normally mind a movie subplot where an overzealous military official gets his comeuppance, it helps if that happens at the hands of characters who aren't idiots.

At its heart, Pixels should have some rewarding message about nerds, geeks, and indoor kids having their day, but that message never really shines through. The closest we get is that Sandlers character isn't as much a failure as hes always thought due to a defeat in gaming as a kid, and the military types look like clods or angry cool kids on the sideline getting shone up by the weakling they mocked. Its not much more than a mishmash of clichs tied together with some snazzy special effects and a rushed fairytale endingexcept theres a problem: the heartwarming ending isn't about all of us, its about Sandlers character being a winner and getting the girl. Where there should have been a meaningful message for kids, theres nothing. This is just another movie Sandler made as an excuse to kiss a pretty woman. Once he got that, the rest of the story didn't matter, and consequently so many opportunities fall by the wayside.

The biggest crime committed by Pixels isn't that its just another opportunity for Adam Sandler to cash a paycheck for playing the same schmuck who gets the girl, but that in the hands of better writers and without Happy Madisons involvement, this concept could have been adapted into a really cool movie. Instead Sandler sullied it and made it another in a long line of cookie-cutter disappointments.

After this, Adam Sandler doesnt deserve to waste any more story ideas or money. He needs to retire and step far away from the reins of his company so better minds can take control.

Blu-ray Bonus Features

The movie may be awful, but Sony at least found a nifty extra to include on the Blu-ray: the ability to battle old school arcade monsters along with the movie on your phone or tablet. Otherwise the extras are pretty standard with featurettes on the classic video game characters, the one they made up as a love interest for Josh Gads character, production featurettes, and a sit-down with the creator of Pac-Man when he was on set for his cameo. The set also includes an Ultraviolet digital copy.

7349977,3,B012DWS874,"Watch the first 10 minutes, fast forward until you see Galaga, then watch. If you can get past the beginning of this movie, it is worth watching to see the pure love they give Pac-Man, Centipede, and Galaga in all their 1980's arcade goodness. The beginning of this movie is pure Adam Sandler, the premise doesn't make a lot of sense, you have to really suspend disbelief, you already know who the love interest is, but then suddenly, it becomes cool. While there is a little cussing which makes my cringe, my kids love the battle scenes and seeing the ""Creator"" of Pac-Man interact with Pac-Man. The cars turning into ghost Inky, Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Clyde is pretty awesome. And things turning into pixels is great CGI work.",1449187200,,729,4.658914728682171

And now he has the classics on his iPad and enjoys playing them. All because of Pixels. I also loved the soundtrack again for all of the old songs. Now my son sings the songs. And it is so funny to me. And he was really shocked at the language (i.e. valley girl) that we used in the 80s. I personally loved the movie, the games coming to life, and the soundtrack.

I think the first act and character intro is a problem. if you're going to have such a fantastical story as what happens in acts 2 and 3, act 1 should I think really ground the story in reality as much as possible, and didn't see that. the film opens with two boys stealing money from, and right in the face of, one of their little sister that she's earned from working (her lemonade stand).  what kind of kid does that and why would he think that's okay and story shows no pushback. Story doesn't seem to think its' a problem introducing it's characters in such a way but it didn't work for me. There is a funny sequence at the end involving Martha Stewart, Serena Williams and one of the hero's in the Lincoln bedroom but other than that, it's a desert without laughs or even chuckles. Full disclosure, skipped around quite abit trying to get traction, without success. 2 stars for good acting.

7350142,2,B012DWS874,"Sandlers getting old and sloppy. Ive been a staunch defender of the comedian over the years, though hes long been the public poster boy for mindless Hollywood drivel. The masses are quick to dismiss his works without even seeing them, as Ive personally witnessed several hipster film snobs come around on his better, recent films like Don't Mess with the Zohan and Thats My Boy, which are vastly underrated comedic gems.

But Pixels is not a good film, and deserves most every bit of criticism.

It takes a simple premise and fails to do anything special with it. The story is dull and predictable. The effects are not special. And worst of all, the jokes are just not funny. Outside of a few wacky conspiracy-nut asides from one supporting character, nobody seems to be trying too hard here. Sandler used to at least bring some zany, manic energy to the table in his worst outings. But nowhere in this film are the silly voices, tweaked rage, or physical shenanigans that would at least look like his usual attempts to be funny. Hes long ridden a predictable formula of outrageousnous and shock that is now neutered and boring.

The film is completely basic, and will only impress small children with the occasional flairs of loud noises and shiny colors. Given Sandlers shrug of a performance, that attitude reflects the end result for his film.",1448409600,,1347,4.772532188841201

7350257,4,B012DWS874,"Watching the debut trailer for the first time, I was excited. REALLY excited. Could they pull it off? A movie based on video games? Something finally better than The Wizard?

Fast forward to theater release....being a father and working more than 65 hours a week, I don't have time to go to the theater often. I knew I would love the subject material, but my wife? Not even interested. I started reading the theatrical reviews.

OMG THIS IS GARBAGE, they said. TOTAL ****, they said. ADAM SANDLER SHOULD JUST STOP, they said. WASTE OF TIME, they said.

I was on the fence on it now. Did they really wreck this movie?

The answer is: No.

It's funny, and I mean, legitimately funny. There were a few times where I literally laughed out loud, which I haven't done during a Sandler movie in a long time (since Happy Gilmore). The subject matter? Aliens mimicking video games to take over the world? Effing awesome. The CGI is very good. Some great sequences of action. The Pac-Man sequence was great. Some awesome video game cameos as well.

The characters were great and well acted (Peter Dinklage was awesomely over-the-top ridiculous, kudos to him)

My ONLY complaint? I wanted MORE. There's so many great games to include in sequences. I wanted more SO BADLY.

Was it a masterpiece? Will it win Oscars? Of course not. Is it a fun popcorn film full of mindless fun and video game references? Yes. Am I glad I got it? Yes. Am I glad I watched it? Yes. Do I want a sequel? Hell yes!",1447977600,,1480,4.51685393258427

Remember, you're not going to be blown away by the plot or the specifics but if you can overlook those short-comings then you'll be fine. There's times when reviews of movies are way to harsh and people expect another masterpiece. You will not get that with Pixels. Otherwise, there's great FX and straight up action.

7350284,4,B012DWS874,"So it's not ""Ghostbusters"" for the 21st Century - although it shares the same sort of implausible story line and Dan Aykroyd does make a cameo appearance - but ""Pixels"" is great fun and I, for one, really enjoyed this ""nerds-save-the-world"" movie.
And that's not just because I once spent more than a few hours playing these classic video games with my son back in the day.
In truth, the plot is pretty thin but Adam Sandler, Kevin James and the rest of the cast make the most out of it; the music is great and so are the special effects.
This is a lighthearted movie with no pretensions; the kind of film designed to capture your attention with its visuals so if you're looking for great writing ala ""On the Waterfront"" don't waste your time or your money. That said, I have to admit that while this flick isn't going to win any Academy Awards for its dialogue there actually are some good lines in the movie - Michele Monaghan's rant about her soon-to-be-ex-husband's Pilates instructor girlfriend, is, for example, among them.
Director Chris Columbus keeps the film moving along at a nice pace, giving viewers an opportunity to enjoy the special effects without dwelling on them overmuch. In other words, he lets the actors act, not just serve as props to show off the CGI. In an era when CGI seems to dominate the film industry, I consider that a real plus.
Is it a classic?
No.
However, if you're just looking for something that will entertain you for a little while on a Friday night when you don't feel like going out, I think you'll find that ""Pixels"" fits the bill nicely.",1447718400,2,1581,4.5508771929824565

We actually both ended up liking it quite a bit. It is not actually directed by Adam Sandler so it doesn't have a lot of his cheesy reoccurring jokes and characters and really he is just quite tamed down in it, so that is good.
The plot is a bit weak, and they jump to the thick of it without much build up, but really it was quite a bit of fun, and some good laughs.",1447372800,2,721,3.781456953642384

It's definitely worth a watch.  The only reason I'm docking a star is because besides the introduced and the action scenes, there are too many scenes where you almost want to just get up and grab a drink due to lack of interest.  Don't get me wrong, I like character building and story lines but I just feel there was something missing.  While this isn't the greatest film ever made, it is worth watching, and i will even watch it again.  I bought the 3d version and the 3d is very cool.",1447113600,,636,4.206611570247934

He plays the same character over and over... the lovable loser, and it is getting very old, and was barely funny the first time.  This movie had terrible reviews which suggested it was another of his typical comedies.  So, I had no hopes for this movie and rented it only because my kids wanted to see it.

I was pleasantly surprised.  Sandler was his usual self, and the story is dumb, as are most of the characters.  But, there are several good laughs and the supporting cast are all pretty funny as well.  While I am glad I didn't pay full price in a movie theater to see it, and am not going to buy a copy to watch again and again, it a was perfectly acceptable to spend to rent it and give it a watch.",1447113600,,801,4.129032258064516

7350481,2,B012DWS874,"Conclusion: If you like video games, 80's references, or Peter Dinklage, you might find this tolerable. Otherwise, it is ""Jack and Jill"" tier awful.

The premise is pretty straightforward: alien's interpret video game footage sent into space as a declaration of war and respond by invading earth with video game characters. Science fiction movies have been great with less, so how does Pixels fare you might ask?

Pros:
- the art direction was actually pretty genuinely interesting. All of the video game characters themselves were really well done and the art team should be commended.
- Peter Dinklidge, I can see why he agreed to do this film
- Sandler actually does make you feel things in a few scenes. Even if he has a good amount of dialog that seems like it was written by a child.
- As a gamer, I could enjoy the references being made.
- Kevin James's character did manage to make some comic relief at times, barely makes up for some cringe moments.
- Sean Bean gave a memorable, albeit short, performance

Cons:
- Josh Gads character really doesn't add anything to the film and the time spent at his unfunny shenanigans could have been spent explaining things to the audience or leaning on the strength of the few character's interesting enough to want to watch. His entire character is I guess ""laugh because he is awkward"". Seriously, they could have filmed over his character with a dog, and I would have found the film more enjoyable.
-Q*bert is another character that really didn't need to exist and the film would have been better off without him. Yes, he was cute, but becoming a central part of the story make no sense, and really seemed to be little more than pandering to children viewers. Again, Dog would have been able to contribute more to this movie.
- At no point is there an actual villain, so there really isn't any dramatic tension.
- Unnecessary love stories. I understand  that there is a ""formula"" but seriously, the movie is about washing up nerds trying to save the world! Can the drawn out flirting scenes wait until after the end of the invasion? If there is an exception to the formula this should have been it.",1446940800,2,2148,4.644736842105263

7350566,1,B012DWS874,"Iconic 80's director Chris Columbus, who launched some of the most endearing and infamous careers of that unique decade, tries to wax nostalgic with this latest Sandler outing but finds his attempt at arcade parody not only loses ""life"" quickly but is ""Game Over"" before it ever gets started.  Sandler, the man behind one of the best homage comedies of our time, The Wedding Singer, fails epically with this overtly simplistic, rarely funny, and poorly acted farce that possessed the originality and potential to be a new classic had anyone else, but he had been involved in its production.  The remaining cast fares no better but not because of a lack of talent.  Rather, it is solely due to a defective script filled with elementary level humor and dumbed down plot points that are repeated far too often and conclude without any effectiveness.  The predictability is so obvious that by credits end the only surprise is that you decided to sit through all 106 minutes.  Again, this could have been a fantastic concept, too bad it was so miserably wasted.  In lieu of any further comments, just think of the sound Pac-Man makes when he dies and you have a general idea.",1446681600,2,1170,4.767326732673268

7350629,2,B012DWS874,"I am a child of the 80s and I spent a good amount of time during my childhood in various video arcades.  So when I saw this movie, I knew right away that I wanted to see it.  But really its nothing special.  Its got the typical Adam Sandler formula in it.  Hes an average guy shown in his average life doing an average job.  He meets a girl and tries to start a relationship with her but she shuns him.  But over the course of the movie, she learns that he is special.  The girl then comes around, gives him a chance and they end up together in the end.

The jokes are just okay and the acting is also just okay.  Parts of it are worse than others.  I mean can you really see Kevin James as the President of the United States?  Somehow I cant see the same actor who played The Zookeeper and Paul Blart as the leader of the free world.

The graphics of the game characters seemed like the makers of this movie were just trying too hard.  Seriously, how much can you touch up or polish Pac Man or Q*Bert?  Theyre just blobs of one color with dots for eyes in those old games.  Also I have to question why Mario is only in this movie for like 2 seconds?  And hes in the background at that!  I kind of thought in a movie that is about video games from the early 80s that he would be more prominent in the story.

All in all its just a movie that is okay.  It does give you a feeling of nostalgia for these games as you are watching the movie, but really the movie is just so bland that you find yourself just wishing you could be playing these old games.  And if you really want to do that you can download them on your smartphone for a few bucks or you can find videos of people playing them online.

If you liked these games as a kid and want to be reminded of your days playing old cabinet games and pumping quarters into them, then check this out.  Just don't expect anything mind blowing.",1446508800,,1889,4.035040431266847

The problem seems to have occurred as he made the transition from comedic peon to corporate producer.  Obviously, OBVIOUSLY, he is burdened by suits who don't know what funny is, forcing themselves onto the movies he makes.  The result is cheese.  Every movie is a little worse.  Except Pixels.  Pixels is ALOT worse.  They could literally delete a half dozen scenes that just make a person WINCE and gain a star.  Could have gained another if, instead of that, had they simply bothered to add in a scene where the aliens so much as talk to humans.  The conspiracy guy, in particular, has no place in the movie since they obviously cut whatever purpose he might have had.  Some link to when they were kids would have in fact made this movie better.

7350684,5,B012DWS874,"I saw this movie in the theater in 3D and bought the blu-ray.

Before seeing it, I set proper expectations: this movie is not going to win any Academy Awards. The story exists solely to showcase the special effects, similar to how the story in an action movie exists to create an excuse for action. This movie is all about nostalgia for those of us who grew up in the 1980s playing Pac-Man, watching The A-Team, etc. It is not historically accurate.

What this movie is, however, is a lot of fun with CG effects that are amazingly cool. Main characters that we love to hate and hate to love. Easter Eggs hidden throughout, including several cool cameos. Peter Dinklage (no explanation needed). Decent pacing between action and non-action scenes. Wholesale destruction of national landmarks, city buildings, etc. in a unique way (pixelization): we don't need giant monsters, bombs, etc. to destroy stuff when we can use magical energy weapons.

7350706,4,B012DWS874,"When I read movie critics' reviews I sometimes wonder if they miss the point that movies should be made for ALL the possible audience members, not just the New York Times and Chicago Tribue critics. E.g., they hated Speed Racer, a movie made for 8-year old boys, because it was too juvenile.  Uh, right.  That's why every 8-year old boy who went to see it sat rapt through the whole thing, often sitting in their movie seats driving their imaginary race cars, turning as Speed turned, laughing at monkey jokes, and just generally enjoying the heck out of it.  It wasn't great art.  It was just fun.

Is Pixels great art?

No.

Is it intricately-plotted and well-thought out science fiction?

No.

Will this movie finally earn Adam Sandler his well-deserved Oscar?

No.

The movie is about the fantasy of being able to enter the video games of your youth and recapture some of the lost innocence and fun of the video arcade.  It has no deeper meaning.  The plot, the sets, the casting, the occasionally laughable dialogue -- all of it -- serve that one somewhat simplistic goal.

But it actually works.

It's wonky fun.

It's a way to waste around 90 minutes and chew up some popcorn saying things like ""I remember Qbert, what a great little game,"" ""Those stupid centipedes, they were evil little buggeers!!!"" and ""We can't be Pac-Man? Awwwwwwww, mannnnnnnn.""

Don't bring your logic circuits. Bring your sense of the banal.

One note for me.  I gave this three-star movie FOUR stars because of the superb 3D effects.  This is one of those times when the 3D was not just a hoax or a way to make a few extra bucks on the same movie. The 3D really did MAKE this movie.  Why?  Well because it made immersion in the movie easier.

I mean -- What's the point of having a movie about a **living** video game unless you feel like you are a **part** of those games?

The 3D effects are stellar and they make the movie more entertaining -- to me at least. If you have a 3D set, I would definitely get the movie in that format.",1446336000,91,2016,4.475274725274725

7350708,4,B012DWS874,"Cute, amusing and family friendly. The scene some reviewers refer to - josh gad humping the stage - I believe is actually his attempt at the worm. It's not sexual, it's just josh gad, a totally uncoordinated nerd attempting to show off dance moves that he doesn't have.

Nothing naughty actually happens in the movie. The scene at the very end with the Lincoln bedroom is innuendo only. And super light innuendo.

Overall, it's cute. I enjoyed it. I might even watch it a second time.

Is it predictable, yes. Do the good guys win, come on, it's an American movie. That's what we do best. And this is an Adam Sandler movie, pretty sure that is all he does. So, enjoy the scenery, relive a little of the 80s and don't think too much about it. This film is profound only in it's push to let every dog have it's day.

The movie, I guess, is about things from another planet that receive a signal we send out into space.  The signal shows games being played, among other things.  These things, or aliens, are not good.  They come to take over the planet.

Now, there is a kid who is really good at games, him and a friend.  They show them paying games and winning a lot.  Then, we jump ahead to them as adults.

These things start attacking the Earth.  Just so happens, one of the kids is the president.  Convenient right?  Him and the other guy get back together, because a president always allows a civilian to fight for the planet?  That is the movie.

It was awful.  All of the acting actually seemed good, but for Sandlers.  Honestly, it was as if he was just standing there, talking into a camera, not even trying.  Then, that made me think.  All of these actors are standing there, probably in front of a green screen, just rambling on.

The parts when the guys are shooting at the things.  It is so, well, it is so fake looking.  It just drug on and on.

Now, there is a lady who Sandlers character meets.  He talks to her and they kind of seem to like one another.  When they talked, the movie seemed good enough.  But, it is when all the sci fi stuff happened, that the movie just got pulled down.

There seemed to be no attempt at any kind of a story here.  I thought to myself, kids might like this.  But, most say that if you were not around to see the classic games and stuff from the 80s, you would not like this movie.

I don't think there were cheat codes that you could use on the arcade versions back in the early 80's, but since I rarely played them, I could be wrong.

But Pixels is utter trash... just like the rest of the stuff Sandler has released in the last ten years. Sandler thinks that with enough references to old video games from yours or your parents childhood, you will love this movie. I'm not that stupid. You're not that stupid. This film had a promising premise, but ultimately fails due to a lousy script, lousy performances, and absolutely no comedy whatsoever. I will give comedies a lot of slack if it actually makes me laugh consistently throughout the movie. Pixels didn't even manage to give me a slight chuckle. Sandler is trying too hard to be relevant that he forgets what made him relevant in the first place. Pixels serves better as a drinking game. Take a drink every time something cringeworthy happens and you'll be out before the first ten minutes is over. Pixels sucks. Sandler sucks. Do not watch. Do not rent. And certainly do not buy.

Honestly, I thought it looked like a joke movie that you would see playing in the background during the real movie (example: Tropic Thunder). But, on a whim and being very bored, I rented it. I was surprised at how decent the movie actually turned out. I actually liked it, except for the horribly unfunny Josh Gad. Who is this guy? He's not funny at all. I'd rather see another one of Sandlers SNL friends play this part like David Spade. The rest of the cast is pretty good, Adam Sandler plays a likable nerd, Kevin James is hilarious as always (and plays an odd part also), Peter Dinklage cracked me up with his too cool for school attitude, Michelle Monaghan plays a hot mom, and there's also a surprise appearance from Dan Aykroyd.

So if he was not gonna pull this retro active style comedy. Who would have ? Not Jim Carrey nor Seth McFarlane.

After making the finals in the championships he is devastated when he comes in second. For prosperity purposes the video tape of the contest is shot into space. 33 years later he is working as an electronics installer when he gets a call from his childhood friend, President Cooper (James) telling him that the Earth is under attack...by video games. Now it is up to Sam along with other gamers from 1982 to save the world. This is a movie I was not sure what to expect. To me, Sandler is either very funny (Happy Gilmore) or unwatchable (Jack & Jill), and I thought this one could go either way. I was actually leaning toward the latter but I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised and I laughed a lot throughout. The movie is really nothing amazing but what it is is very entertaining and a decent family movie. Growing up in the 80's I loved seeing all the old video game characters again and I have to admit that Q-Bert stole the movie. This is a very Sandler type movie and is not worth all the bad press it was getting. Overall, much much better than I was expecting and I surprisingly enjoyed this as did my family.

7350815,3,B012DWS874,"I went in to this movie without much expectation and as expected I got a pretty mediocre experience. Adam Sandler is Adam Sandler at this point. If you want some mindless fun with no real purpose and can overlook some very large plot and pacing negatives, then you'll probably have the same experience I did.

The obvious draw to this movie was the play on nostalgic games of old and in that aspect the movie succeeded where it wanted to. We got to see the re-imagining of our old favorite games growing up and in that aspect the movie was a lot of fun. The pacing at times seemed off and apparently the military cannot aim or take orders for crap, which kind of mutes the point of having a military, which leaves the fate of the world up to four washed up gamers. The premise is silly, but then again the whole movie is meant to be.

The cast choices was interesting. The main cast is Adam Sandler, Peter Dinklage, and Josh Gad with Kevin James in largely a supporting role. There are also some cameos, like the (wasted) Sean Bean. Adam Sandler plays his normal, physical, self. Josh Gad is the more reclusive, stereotypical nerd/gamer, Peter Dinklage does a pretty hilarious job as the egotistical criminal gamer and Kevin James plays the largely out of place, and pretty much pointless, President of the United States.

As the world is falling apart against an alien invasion that has taken the shape of video game characters, Adam Sandler, a regretful loser of the world gaming tournament in 1980s, leads a rag-tag group of washed up gamers tasked with saving the world as the military fails and then subsequently disappears for the rest of the movie(?). Like I said earlier, the entire premise of the movie is silly and the final ""boss"" is probably the weakest part of the entire movie (Seriously, the boss could have killed the entire group while they did numerous impromptu conversations literally IN FRONT of him), which is unfortunate.

Overall, I give this movie a 2.5 out of 5.0, but since Amazon doesn't have a .5 rating system I will round to 3.0.",1445817600,,2060,4.604904632152588

7350828,4,B012DWS874,To be honest I wasn't expecting much so I was pleasantly surprised with this film. I'm old enough to remember the playing the games in the film back in the day so it was a nice trip down memory lane for me.  My kids didn't know the games with the exception of pacman. It was amusing I liked the cast. Kevin James was impossible to believe as President but I find him funny so I let it slide.

7350832,2,B012DWS874,"Pixels has a strange concept for a movie geared to kids. When aliens misinterpret video feeds of classic arcade games as a declaration of war, they attack the Earth through video games  Space Invaders, Donkey Kong, Pac Man, and such. Sam Brenner (Adam Sandler), a teenage video-game champion from the original heyday of the games, is empowered by President of the United States William Cooper (Kevin James) to save humankind.

The problem is that the target audience has never heard of these games, so they will not be in on the basic joke. The film combines live action with computer-generated monsters that look more silly than threatening. The acting  if you can call it that  is atrocious, and Sandler is given far too much screen time doing shtick. Its hard to accept James as the President, even in a picture as goofy as this one. He mugs shamelessly, probably to compensate for the lack of real comedy in his role, and director Chris Columbus (Mrs. Doubtfire, Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone) fails to reign him in. The supporting cast is impressive Michelle Monaghan, Peter Dinklage, Josh Gad, Jane Krakowski  but fail to add any pizzazz to the lame script by Tim Herlihy and Timothy Dowling.

The 2-disc 3D Blu-ray/2D Blu-ray edition contains 8 behind-the-scenes featurettes and a music video.",1445558400,3,1307,4.918181818181818

laughs that hes the best funny man out there. Not even close and it gets worse from there with Kevin James making another crappy movie appearance. He should stick with TV.

My kids who have never heard of any of these games except PacMan (due to terrible newish shows) enjoyed the movie very much.

His last few movies prior to this one have hardly been memorable; and critics seem to do best when they can bash a certain film. Once this movie was over I thought to myself: ""What exactly is a bad movie in today's world?""

So while I will say that Pixels is neither spectacular nor incredible, it still is enjoyable. Yes, there are some cheesy moments/dialogue, and no Pixels does not try to dazzle you or be an award caliber type movie, but that's the point. Pixels is a movie you have fun with and is obviously not one to be taken serious.

I enjoyed each performance; notably Peter Dinklage's character Eddie Plant. I also liked the appearance of iconic characters like Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, and Q'bert.

Again, Pixels is neither spectacular nor incredible, but it is quite a fun movie. It doesn't reach the same level of effectiveness like Disney's Wreck It Ralph did, but in the end, Pixels does just enough to satisfy viewers.

To close out the review, I say this: Yes, there are in fact bad movies in the world, but Pixels simply isn't one of them.",1444435200,6,1153,4.528846153846154

7350980,5,B012DWS874,"This movie doesn't deserve its terrible RottenTomatoes score, not even close.

When I first saw the trailer to this movie I thought it looked like a great idea, but was turned off in part by the Adam Sandler inclusion. This is only because in the past decade+ Adam Sandler has been consistently misfiring, but he didn't always. Remember Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore? Very silly, but funny. This movie has a lot of the same kind of completely random humor that those movies did--and it works.

Let's be clear: ** This movie is laser guided at a specific demographic **. You're thinking kids. You're wrong; it's aimed at guys in their 30's; guys who grew up playing the games that come to life in this movie. If you're in that demographic and you played video games as kid you'll really like this movie. If you don't, let's both share the lament of your lost childhood and the fact you cannot remember anything about it.

As far as kids are concerned, the two I was with also enjoyed this movie a lot. They were unfamiliar with almost all the video games in the movie, but there is enough going on outside of that not to matter. There is a little bit of swearing, though, and some sexual inuendo which they may not get.

This is one of those movies that shows all its cards in the trailer. If you thought watching the trailer you would like this movie, watch it--you will. If it doesn't seem up your alley, just move on, no harm or foul.

As to the 17% on Rottentomatoes? Perfect example of people outside of a movie's demographic reviewing it. They just didn't get it and they let their readers down.",1444435200,3,1602,4.472602739726027

The reality? This s an Adam Sandler flick. Certain things are going to happen (boy meets girl, boy fights with girl, boy gets girl). The story itself is not that unique (a bit too close to Independence Day) though it was entertaining, the 'pixels' they brought back were quite adorable (loved Q-bert) and the concept there was solid.

7350988,1,B012DWS874,"Let me say before I begin the review of the film itself that I work at a movie theatre. While this film was in theatres, it was considered a ""kids film"" and seen by many families and the like. That being said, I think this film is just another raunchy-humored Adam Sandler film. Just the typical sexist, racist, homophobic Sandler cash grab.

Let me also add that my review may contain some spoilers for the film, so if you haven't seen it you may not want to read.

For starters, the main character -- of course, played by Sandler, -- repeatedly makes inappropriate jokes to his love interest throughout the film. There is one point near the end where he even says ""Hold on to my mighty hammer,"" and she replies, ""You love saying that.""

As a whole, the film wasn't very entertaining. The characters were typical of any Sandler movie. The guy whose weight is made fun of, the 'smart' one, the one who flirts with all the women, and the leader. With the addition of Adam Sandler's love interest. The only female character who really had any lines, at all.

The character played by Josh Gad is made out to be a total loser of course, in a humorous light. Because it's so funny to be overweight and alone, right? Hilarious. [SPOILER] Throughout the film, Gad's character mentions his obsession with the video game character ""Lady Lisa."" Typical attractive, skinny, tanned, blonde with blue-eyes woman in any Sandler movie to be the ""hot"" one.

As the war with these ""aliens"" continues, the character of Lady Lisa at last appears. Lady Lisa is the ONLY video game character in this ENTIRE film who appears in a NON-PIXELATED FORM. In turn, sexualizing a character for the enjoyment of the viewers, despite the film itself being called PIXELS, in which the aliens send PIXELATED WARRIORS to fight.

Gad encounters this Lady Lisa, who ""attempts"" to fight him for all of two minutes before he is down on his knees professing his love to her, and she abruptly stops fighting for no reason and drops her weapons. Keep in mind that earlier in the film, the supposed ""Creator of Pacman"" gave a heartfelt speech to Pac-Man about how he was a good character, and Pac-Man in return bit off his arm.

So- this drone warrior, because she's a woman, has to drop her weapons when Gad says three words to her, but Pac-Man (despite actually being the good guy of his game) showed no sign of emotion at all.

After quitting the fight with Gad, Lady Lisa shortly thereafter makes out with Gad and Peter Dinklage's character walks up to the scene, questioning if this is Gad's new girlfriend; to which Gad replies that she's now his fiance. Did I mention that in all of this - Lady Lisa never says a word? She doesn't have a single line and shows no emotion. At the end of the battle with the aliens, Lady Lisa dissolves and goes away just like all the other aliens, much to Gad's dismay as he screams to the heavens over a woman who could never even say no to him, apparently.

At the end of the film, the character of Q-bert, which until that point had really been the only decent character of the film, randomly shape-shifts and becomes the new Lady Lisa with absolutely no explanation, and after this Gad's character gets to keep her as a trophy - Yes, a trophy - from the war. Keep in mind, even at the end of the film, Lady Lisa has never said a single word.

So essentially, have your sons watch this for inspiration if you'd like them to grow up thinking they own women, can speak to them in demeaning manners, and that jokes about 'staying in the kitchen' are okay. As for your daughters, this is the perfect two hours to show them how boys are the boss and girls have to do what they say, and can't be the heroes.

This movie is made for the typical Sandler audiences of 35-50-year-old straight, white men who love bro-humor and almost aggressively shuts out anyone else. Sandler and James just sleepwalk through their roles and don't even seem to be enjoying the action-adventure premise or 80s nostalgia. Josh Gad (14 years younger than Sandler, but is supposed to be maybe only 5 years younger), interprets humor as shouting, and it is genuinely unpleasant when hes on screen, especially when hes super creepy. This movie also has a lot of cameos, some of which just bother me for wasting talented peoples time. Jane Krakowski, Sean Bean, Brian Cox, and Dan Aykroyd show up but never get laughs.

As is typical with most Sandler movies, gay panic is pretty common in this film with the man-child characters, AKA our heroes. These guys want chicks, and that fact is made a little too clear. Besides Monaghan and Sandler (no chemistry by the way) and James and Krakowski as the President and First Lady, Dinklage and Gads sexuality is pretty gross for what is clearly being marketed at children. Dinklage, in prison, wants to blackmail the US government into providing him with a forced 3-some with two women who don't fit traditional beauty standards (sadly, that got the biggest laugh in the theater I was in).

Basically- I really am not as impressed by this film as everyone else seems to be. Total waste of two hours that I spent WAY too much time cleaning as a movie theatre employee. Although to be honest, the soundtrack wasn't bad. But other than that- I'll never watch this willingly again.",1444176000,6,5289,4.5664556962025316

So imagine my delight in going retro with this nostalgic look at old gaming culture... 80s styles and lexicon, the coin-op game cabinets... it all makes for a pleasant walk down memory lane.

PROs
 I'm not one of those folks who thinks Adam Sandler can walk on water, but he was funny more often than not in Pixels.
 Peter Dinklage gets ample screen time, and he brings his Game of Thrones buddy Sean Bean (Eddard 'Ned' Stark) onto screen for a cameo as Corporal Hill, an SAS Officer; 80s icon Dan Aykroyd also has a cameo, and Jane Krakowski (30 Rock) appears as the First Lady.
 Other than the typical boy meets girl subplot, Pixels is a fresh story with decent special effects.

CONs
 I'll forget the story by the end of next week. Of course, that could just be because I am getting old.
 If you don't have any kind of attachment to classic (""Golden Age"") video games, Pixels is not likely to win you over. Kids, on the other hand, are likely to get some enjoyment out of it regardless.

 Take it or leave it: you won't be on your deathbed wishing you had watched it, nor are you likely to wish you ""had those 109 minutes of your life back.""",1443657600,175,1249,4.280851063829787

The story is really interesting and the 3D version was the best that I have seen.  The characters were flying at and around you all of the time.  It was great!! The best thing to do if you hear people that don't like this movie is to see for yourself.  They just have a bug in their hiney...(I cleaned it up for them so that they don't get their undergarments in a wad).  It's ENTERTAINMENT!! Stop analyzing every little thing about a movie and just let yourself have fun.",1443398400,7,1055,4.072815533980583
7350995,4,B012DWS874,"OK, first off, let me voice my disapproval at the Hollywood media critics and propaganda machine who essentially bashed this movie into the ground before they even saw, giving the movie literally zero chance of proving itself to them as something worth watching. It worked like a charm with audiences missing the movie because of bad word of mouth and brainwashing those who did see it into believing that what they saw was complete garbage, when in fact, it was the complete opposite of.

I'm not really sure what the critics were expecting with this film? It's a movie about a bunch of old school gamers fighting an invading alien force using old games as weapons. Sandler and co. weren't trying to remake 'Citizen Kane' here. What about the premise of this film screamed Oscar contender to any of these people? The film delivered on EXACTLY what it was intended to deliver on - it hit well with older audiences who saw the film for nostalgia purposes and also hit with younger audiences who love all things video games - even old school games. The story was solid and the acting was good (although trying to picture Kevin James as the President of the United States is a bit of a stretch). It had genuinely funny parts and is just a good old fashioned fun time.

Adam Sandler has been given an unfair shake as of late. He has produced some great comedies over the years, but because his last 3 or 4 haven't been up to par with his older movies, he and his gang have been dragged through the mud for it. Although films like 'Chuck and Larry', 'Zohan', 'Thats My Boy', and 'Blended' haven't been massive hits, they were still funny for the most part.  Sandler still needs to answer for the train-wreck's that were 'Jack and Jill' and 'Just Go With It' however. That being said, films like 'Click', 'The Longest Yard',  '50 First Dates', 'Funny People', 'Bedtime Stories', 'Grown Ups', 'Grown Ups 2', 'Hotel Transylvania', and 'The Cobbler' have all been pretty good in my opinion.

 Back to 'Pixels', I'm not going to go into mega-detail about the plot, but to sum it up Sam Brenner (Sandler) is a former child video game prodigy who, after losing at Donkey Kong in the 1982 world championships to Eddie 'Fireblaster' Plant (Dinklage), has seen his life spiral out of control. A VHS tape of the competition was sent into outer space as part of a time capsule which was found by a civilization of extraterrestrials and wrongly looked upon as a threat of attack. Now, in present day, the aliens have begun counter-attacking Earth with huge, life-size versions of the video games in the tape. Brenner is asked by the President of the United States (James) who also happens to be one of Brenner's old gaming buddies to help fight an alien invasion. So Brenner, along with a group of other old school gamers (which also includes his old nemesis Plant) proceed to use their gaming skills to try and defeat the alien invaders. Are their logic errors? Sure, what movie doesn't have them? Are there video game errors? Absolutely, games like Paperboy, Tetris, and Super Mario Bros. among others did not exist in 1982, so how would the aliens know about them? All of that aside, it doesn't detract from the film in any way.

It's a simple plot that doesn't require too much thought to process and I believe it is done very well. I thoroughly enjoyed the film, and even better, my kids who range from 15 years to 8 years old absolutely LOVED it! Which gives the movie the seal of approval as far as I'm concerned. They loved it so much they wanted to see it again right afterwards, if that's not a sign of a good family movie, I don't know what is. So, in short, please just ignore the idiot sheep naysayers who keep giving the movie a bad rap and see it, you won't be disappointed.",1443398400,6,3771,4.561299852289513

When aliens misinterpret video-feeds of classic arcade games as a declaration of war, they attack the Earth in the form of the video games.

What did I think?

You know whats a really good video game movie? Wreck-It Ralph. Wreck-It Ralph is funny, moving and has a plot that makes sense. Wreck-It Ralph isn't confused about whether its supposed to be for children or adults. Wreck-It Ralph entertains both without resorting to recurring jokes about slut-seeking missiles. Nobody repeatedly screams bitch in Wreck-It Ralph, and nobody receives an adoring scantily-clad warrior woman who never speaks as a (quite literal) trophy. No beloved video game characters urinate on themselves. In Wreck-It Ralph, the King of Queens is not the President of the United States.

Watch Wreck-It Ralph, watch the not-half-bad 2010 short film on which Pixels was based or watch the episode of Futurama with a similar alien-video-game-battle plot. Do not, under any circumstances, watch Pixels.",1442016000,9,994,5.272151898734177

My kids loved this movie; we saw it in theatres twice and will definitely be purchasing many copies to give away this holiday season. As someone mentioned earlier, there are some pretty awesome special effects in this film. We also love the music and 80s references. Sandler does act like the immature ""man child"" as some critics call him, but when is he ever not? The point is, this is part of his character persona and it is evident in his old SNL skits when Sandler was a hot item. Sandler likes to take us back to bygone eras of simpleness and innocence before his characters understand what really matters or learn a lesson (albeit later in life than ideal) but what is wrong with that?

7351006,3,B012DWS874,"It's not surprising that the daggers have been out for Pixels long before it ever opened in theaters. Adam Sandler's movies generally are pretty terrible, and director Chris Columbus was the only guy who couldn't make a decent Harry Potter movie.  And let's face it; there's an aversion to anything that dares to play on our childhood memories, whether it be remakes or movies about our favorite action figures. Chances are, the same people who played with those classic toys also plucked down a few quarters at the local arcade, and they will get a kick out of the way Pixels brings those games to glorious life.

First, you'll have to wade through the typically sophomoric Happy Madison junk to get to the fun stuff. Penned by Sandler's buds Tim Herlihy and Timothy Dowling, Pixels is loosely based on Patrick Jean's amazing short film in which aliens attack the Earth by using classic video game characters. Sandler plays Sam Brenner, a childhood video game maestro who very nearly became the Donkey Kong champion, but he lost to the Billy Mitchell-esque Eddie Plant (Peter Dinklage, nothing short of hilarious) in the competitive finals. The defeat sent Sam on a tailspin he never recovered from, and as an adult he's basically a member of the Geek Squad, installing video game systems in the homes of more successful people. At least his best pal (Kevin James) is the President of the United States (!!!), which is a lot better than his other childhood buddy, Ludlow Lamonsoff (Josh Gad), who grew up to be a total crackpot.

After an awkward and overlong meet-cute between Sam and tough military mom Violet (Michelle Monaghan), its game on when an army base is suddenly obliterated into 8-bit rubble by mysterious forces. Turns out that a time capsule (remember those?) sent into space decades ago was interpreted by an alien race as a declaration of war, and so they're on the attack using Pac-Man, Galaga, Centipede, and more as their weapons of choice. If the Earth loses three battles, its game over and the planet will be destroyed.

The most fun to be had with Pixels is scoping out the literally hundreds of characters populating the screen at once. Everything from Burger Time to Q-Bert to Paperboy (my favorite) can be seen in the background trying to destroy the Earth, and those who have a fondness for those games will get a kick out of it. How often do you get to a 3D version of Pac-Man take over New York City, complete with power pellets and little cars posing as the ""ghosts""? Columbus has never been the most visually inventive filmmaker but he's stepped up his game with impressive digital renderings that are like something straight out of your Atari 2600. There's a fair bit of action, too, far more than your typical Sandler film, and other than the bland Centipede set piece they're surprisingly well-choreographed, resembling stages from your favorite coin-ops.

Pixels is all about the nostalgia factor, though, and it's important to remember that Columbus is partially responsible for some of the '80s most unforgettable films: The Goonies, Gremlins, Adventures in Babysitting, and others. His love for the era and respect for these games is what makes Pixels so enjoyable. It also doesn't hurt that Sandler is largely in the straight-man role, leaving the humor to Gad and Dinklage who are far funnier than him at this point. Sadly, this is still a Happy Madison production and that means a ton of useless cameos from Sandler's useless buddies, and occasionally a crass joke disrupts what is generally wholesome family entertainment. The best cameos are by Q-Bert and Frogger, anyway. Pixels isn't the kind of movie you sit around and think too much about, but it works as a fun and fast-paced celebration of the arcade era. When it's over you won't want to hit the reset button and get your money back, at least.",1439078400,38,3846,4.830045523520486

7351013,4,B012DWS874,"This is an Adam Sandler movie so it automatically has lovers and haters with parents wondering if their kids can watch it. The film opens in 1982 with kids playing in an arcade championship with the tape being sent into space by NASA for aliens. Years later when Kevin James is POTUS and Sandler is on the NERD Brigade installing TV systems, the world is attacked by aliens using video games tactics. Only the old time players have the ability to defeat them, sort of like ""Ghost Busters"" but not nearly as funny.

For those who like movies based on video games, this one goes over the top. The script is formula with minor twists but not real surprises. The language was iffy as it uses the word ""bitch"" which made the kids giggle. There was 1 F-bomb. There is some talk about sex such as making a Martha Stewart, Serena Williams sandwich. Definite PG-13 stuff.

Adam Sandler managed to score minor roles for his wife and kids. There are some fun scenes with era music and people, even though some came after 1982 creating anachronisms.

Director Chris Columbus (""Harry Potter"") is playing to all three generations. In fact, the fellow next to me kept making happy little chirping noises all through the classic game sequences, which also included Centipede, Asteroids, Space Invaders and Galaxian. Video games are a HUGE industry in today's digital world.

In 1977, Carl Sagan spearheaded the launch of a Voyager time capsule to outer space which contained samples of life as we knew it. For our story, aliens find video games on board and mistake them for reality, consequently they launch a ""defensive"" strike using the patterns they find in the samples. Obviously humans who excelled at those arcade games in years gone by are best suited to defend Earth today.

We see:
  * Adam Sandler (""Grown Ups"") Brenner is a former arcade contender who now installs digital devices in homes for a living. Sandler continues to use the same whiny voice and deadpan delivery that made him a multimillionaire. ""If it ain't broke...""
  * Kevin James (""Hitch"") Cooper surprises us with his success story, but he is still a loyal friend and with the future of the world at stake, he reminds Brenner of his old skills.
  * Peter Dinklage (""Game of Thrones"") Eddie ""The Fire Blaster"" Plant beat Brenner for the world championship when they were boys. This egotistical braggart provides some of the best laughs near the end of the movie.
  * Josh Gad (Olaf's voice in ""Frozen"") Ludlow was another successful arcade player but his personality has kept him at his grandmother's house all these years.
  * Michelle Monaghan (""Eagle Eye"") is nursing a broken heart and a bottle of wine, but her son is having some digital devices installed in their home...Brenner tells her she has already married the wrong guy so the worst part is over...enter her instant dislike for that nerdy installer (nudge, nudge, wink, wink...).
  * Brian Cox (""RED"") Admiral Porter is the proud military fellow our civilians humble with their unique skills.
