1254369,5,B00002EPXL,"This is an excellent DVD that I used as an introduction to yoga, and that I continue to use two or three times a week to supplement my yoga studio classes.
The movements are largely stretches, with none of the  ""huffing and puffing"" that more intense yoga can require. The  teachers are very responsible about showing alternate poses when needed.  The standing poses helped me with my initial balance so that I was able to  sustain more challenging poses in my studio classes.
The production  values are very good, and the audio quality is great. Many yoga teachers  encourage the use of home yoga videos and DVDs, but recommend listening to  them more than watching them (after you're familiar with the sequence, of  course); with audio instructions only, you're more likely to focus on your  own body rather than trying to mimic the ""perfect"" teachers. This  DVD has great sound quality and instruction, and I'm able to turn away from  the TV and listen only.
I recommend this DVD for yoga beginners, and for  yoga intermediates looking for a light 20-minute program on days they can't  attend longer classes.",961632000,139,1111,4.814814814814815
1254370,5,B00002EPXL,"I'm fairly new to yoga and got this dvd for more of the advanced features.  It has the 3 programs, plus a bonus on how to use props.  The morning is perfect to get you going...same with the stress one.  Also, in the evening,  the stress or pm is perfect before bedtime.
I would suggest this for  beginner or intermediate level people.  While challenging on some poses for  most newbies, I think advanced to very advanced people would get bored.  The background music is very nice and soothing too!",957484800,20,497,4.50561797752809

1254375,5,B00002EPXL,I'm getting back into yoga and working on increasing my flexibility! Patricia Walden is my favorite. This 3 in one is an excellent tool for the returning and beginning yogi.,1402358400,,173,4.8
1254376,5,B00002EPXL,"I bought this specifically for the stress-relief yoga session which is an excellent work-out for someone like me who suffers from fibromyalgia.  The other two work-outs are excellent, too.  Rodney Yee is a top instructor and makes this clear and easy to understand.  I highly recommend this video.",1400198400,,297,5.145833333333333
1254377,5,B00002EPXL,"Many years ago I had the am routine on VHS and it was my favorite, but the tape wore out and I needed to replace it. This DVD is exactly what I was looking for it is in great condition!!",1399248000,,186,3.675
1254378,5,B00002EPXL,This is by far my favorite yoga DVD.  My first one I used everyday for years and ended up misplacing it on my last trip.  They come in 20 minute session which means I can always fit one into my day,1391126400,,197,3.7804878048780486
1254379,5,B00002EPXL,"I love Rodney Yee, and his A.M. Yoga is the DVD that introduced me to yoga.  It's the one I do when I don't want to do yoga, when I am in pain and stiff, when I am tired.  It prepares me to get through the day.  It prepares me for more advanced Rodney Yee yoga DVD's.  Suzanne Deason's Stress Relief Yoga is really nice to prepare you for a stressful day or to take the tension out of your body after a stressful day.  No heavy lifting here, easy to do, but very effective.  I have done Patricia Walden's P.M. Yoga, but don't enjoy it as much as ""my morning cup of"" A.M. Yoga or the Stress Relief yoga.  The three workouts on this one DVD is THE best yoga workout for any level or for people that are recuperating from illness and injury.  The actual workout are each about 20 minutes or less.  So when you know you should do your yoga but don't feel like it, just do this short A.M. Yoga workout.  You will not believe the difference it makes in your energy and ease of movement throughout your day.",1390262400,3,1000,4.108247422680412
1254380,5,B00002EPXL,I love this program because I can take 20 minutes out of my day and do one of the workouts at home. I have suffered from back pain and the PM Yoga gently stretches and relaxes me at the end of the day. I immediately feel better and less tense. I have purchased copies for friends as well.,1385251200,,288,3.9827586206896552
1254381,5,B00002EPXL,"Patricia Walden was my first exposure to yoga. The PM version of this dvd is my favorite, she uses very clear instructions that help you understand what position she wants you in. Wish she was in more of these..watch the dvd all the way through once before trying to practice and you'll know how to prepare for it.",1384387200,,314,4.431034482758621
1254382,5,B00002EPXL,I had this on VHS and finally broke down to get it on dvd. So happy I did. I love this yoga workout. Especially the p.m. yoga. Great relaxation before bed!,1372204800,,155,4.032258064516129

1254384,5,B00002EPXL,"This is a great yoga series for people who want a gentle yet effective yoga stretch, relief of stress and a way to unwind in the evening.  I found the p.m. yoga helps me to relax and prepare for sleep and I've removed myself from much internet and cable tv activity before sleep.  A.m. yoga is a great 20 minute way to easily and gently awaken my mind, body and spirit.  Stress relief is amazing to do anytime and I sometimes integrate one after the other depending of what I need...",1362268800,,483,4.285714285714286
1254385,2,B00002EPXL,"My husband and I had been doing a 20min. beginners yoga video by Rodney Yee and were looking for a little change up, so I got this video. It's terrible in comparison. The segments are supposed to be 20min, but half of it is spent talking so you don't get to do many moves. They also don't hold you in the positions for very long. I suppose for a very very beginner and for someone who needs to figure out how to relax and isn't looking for the stretching part of yoga this would be a place to start.
On a side note the choice of clothing for the instructors is distracting in a very bad way.",1323648000,3,591,4.05982905982906
1254386,5,B00002EPXL,"I had this in a VHS version in the past and wanted to upgrade to a DVD.  I love Yoga so much.  If you are a beginner or just out of shape like me then this is the one to get.  I found it to be relaxing, good stress release and a good start/end to my day.  Plus now I can do the splits.  Never done them before in my life until I started doing Yoga.  Just one day I realized how flexible I was getting.  I have lost a lot of weight as well.  It does not build muscle mind you.  But It is a relaxing way to exercise.",1297382400,,514,3.6
1254387,5,B00002EPXL,"I feel much better after practicing with Rodney Yee. The A.M. program helps me waking up and starting my day with more energy. The P.M. program is awesome to help me have a good night sleep.
Just don't practice near anything that can be broken! I was doing the warrior pose and broke a crystal bomboniere! Now I still do my exercises at home, but in a emptier room.",1260230400,,365,4.304347826086956
1254388,5,B00002EPXL,"I bought this for my daughter who went away to college for the first time and between sports and a full course load was having a very tough time of things. She was even getting injured because she was always so tense. Her coach suggested yoga, but she didn't have time and had never done it before. She has found that this set has loosened her up tremendously before her games and her swing has improved. This set has made a huge difference in relaxing her after tough classes and the p.m. disc helps her get to sleep and clear her mind. I've noticed a huge reduction in her stress levels and her favorite disc is the stress relief. She is normally very high strung and on the go and this set has really helped her with a lot of relaxation and calming techniques. I highly recommend it.",1237075200,,786,4.3175675675675675
1254389,4,B00002EPXL,"Great daily starter for beginners or more advanced, although it helps to know the basic poses as little verbal direction is given on this tape.",1236816000,,143,4.76
1254390,5,B00002EPXL,"This is one of the first Yoga DVDs I owned.  I have since worked my way through several of Rodney Yee's and some other productions as well, but I believe this remains my favorite because of the flexibility it offers.

It is nice to complete a more serious Yoga collection because it has 3 short components (each around 30 minutes).  This way you have segments that are short enough to do every day.  Most other videos I own are comprised of one hour long session divided into 3 segments.  The living arts series say that you can do just one of the segments, but when it completes one, it continues playing into the next (some videos don't even show the segment breaks). However, this video is 3 different workouts. So this video is convenient if you just feel you need to decompress or stretch for 30 minutes.

The exercises are simple enough for any beginner.  I would classify the exercises as relaxation and stretching.",1194912000,,922,4.585365853658536
1254391,5,B00002EPXL,I used this every moring for a year when I was very stressed with my job and it helped a lot,1172275200,,92,3.4285714285714284
1254392,4,B00002EPXL,"This DVD contains three very good yoga practices which are perfect for virtually all levels of yoga practitioners, particularly advanced beginners to intermediates. Although the practices are each labelled as being 20 minutes long, the actual times vary a bit: AM Yoga has a 4-minute breathing exercise followed by a 12-minute yoga program, PM Yoga is approximately 24 minutes, and Yoga for Stress Relief is about 16 minutes. All of these programs are very doable for those new to yoga, but they do assume some prior familiarity with the poses (total yoga newbies will find Yoga Journal's Yoga Practice for Beginners to be an excellent place to start).

AM Yoga provides a practice so gentle that I've frequently performed it upon first waking up and while still in my pajamas. The simple breathing exercise helps your mind to focus, and then the basic twists and other poses which follow help your body to awaken. The practice is led by Rodney Yee, an excellent instructor who provides flawless cuing and who has an extremely calm, soothing voice--ideal for anyone who is not a morning person! PM Yoga is a very nice practice for winding down, relaxing, and stretching. It also begins with a short focus on breathing, encouraging you to turn your attention inward ""where it's quiet."" The practice moves from a seated to a kneeling position and also includes traditional standing poses such as a warrior and lunges. This is a great end-of-day workout or a quick practice to fit in anytime you need to relax. Patricia Walden is also a very good instructor, but her cuing is not quite as accurate as Rodney's; however, I enjoyed her practice the most.  My one disappointment with this DVD was the Stress Relief program by Suzanne Deason.  Although I thought that her voice was soothing and that she cued well, she moves so quickly from pose to pose that there's little opportunity to enjoy each posture. Furthermore, the use of props seems to hinder and further complicate this practice--if the workout moved at a slower pace, the props would be a nice addition, allowing those with less flexibility to attain the poses, but because the transitions are so fast, I spent most of my time worrying about where the props were supposed to be positioned, leaving little time to relax in the poses.

Overall, this video would be a good addition to your collection if you are looking for short, relaxing practices accessible to a wide range of levels.",1116460800,10,2441,4.84652278177458
1254393,4,B00002EPXL,"These three yoga workouts are very nice to have if you need short, relatively easy sessions.  I do agree with other reviewers, however, that some of the poses are rushed and the transitions are difficult to do in that time.

My biggest complaint is with the setup of the DVD, however.  Even when you navigate through the three menus to get to the session that you want, you have to sit through the intro with the instructor explaining what exactly he or she is going to do in this practice.  Of course you need that the first time, but after that I'd like to get right to the beginning of the practice.  But they've disabled the skip-ahead feature on the DVD!  The only way to do it is to fast forward and then take the chance that you'll miss the beginning and have to back track.

I have just started using this DVD and I suspect I'll get tired of it soon simply because of that feature.",1111363200,5,889,4.287425149700598
1254394,2,B00002EPXL,"At times, it's nice to have a relaxing yoga session, but this one was boring.  There are three different sessions to choose from, AM Yoga, Stress Relief & PM Yoga.  All three were much too simple.  The flowing poses in Stree Relief were nice but I didn't find them to relieve stress.  If you're inflexible and new to yoga then maybe this would be suitable but if you have any yoga experience, pass on this one.  Thankfully I was able to rent this.",1075248000,8,447,4.337349397590361
1254395,4,B00002EPXL,"Rodney's am Yoga warm-up is the best thing about this video.  He has such a calm, soothing voice, and this yoga stretch is a great way to start your morning.  It's not particularly challenging, but I don't think that's the point--it's just a great way to get loosened up and ready to start the day.  The other two work-outs are fine--I find the evening one a bit too strenuous for a before-bed workout--it gets me too energized, but I think it would make another good morning work-out.  It's just too bad Rodney doesn't feature in all three segments--then I would give this five stars.",1061769600,6,585,4.596153846153846
1254396,4,B00002EPXL,"I have studied yoga for 2 years and use this DVD to supplement for my home practice.  It is a great value these 3 workouts for this price.  They are each 20 minutes long with a warm-up and relaxation.  The AM works on you gently getting you energized for the day.  The stress-relief works the shoulders to relieve the daily stress you carry there.  The PM is slightly more vigorous and tires you out a bit.  The only one I have difficulty watching is the PM because Patricia is in the desert and the wind is blowing and it looks HOT!  My favorite is the stress relief, so I disagree with the other reviewers.  I find Suzanne to be an excellent instructor.  The workouts are very quick and just perfect for before or after work.  The section on props is great for beginners.  If you are a beginner most likely you will need props because you can't reach as far and they help you get deeper into the pose.  For this tape you need one brick, a belt and a mat.",1054425600,8,956,4.220994475138122
1254397,4,B00002EPXL,The AM section of this DVD was a nice introduction to yoga and  I still find it a nice way to start the day (Rodney Yee on the beach in Hawaii doesn't hurt either). I have progressed on to the Total Body Yoga DVD but I still use the AM section for a relaxing start to the day. The stress relief person has a voice that does not lend itself to relaxation. PM section is more strenuous and a little harder to follow but a good workout.,1046649600,2,433,3.9770114942528734
1254398,2,B00002EPXL,"I recently rented this DVD.  Thought I would try before I would buy. I enjoy Rodney Yee's AM section.  His voice is calming and it's very relaxing but he doesn't hold the poses very long.  Suzanne Deason's voice is annoying and she is like ""Speedy Gonzalez"" ... waaay too fast to relieve any stress.  Did nothing for me.  Patricia Walden's PM was too difficult.  Again, too fast!  She doesn't tell you how to change the positions.  I didn't find it very relaxing.  I'm happy I only rented this.",1044921600,12,494,4.5227272727272725
1254399,2,B00002EPXL,"The scenery in this DVD are gorgeous, but for a beginner it needs more detailed instruction and some of it just moves too fast.  I like workout videos that are attractively filmed but for yoga I'm willing to sacrifice a bit of beauty for instruction.  I was really looking forward to the stress relief workout but I can't get through it.  Suzanne Deason might be a great yogi, but I'm having a hard time getting past her voice and find her direction had to follow.  The ""extras"" on poses and props are good.  Overall, a nice looking package but I had to get another DVD.  This one just didn't give me enough of what I need right now - more detailed instruction and less distraction.",1043798400,7,682,4.416
1254400,3,B00002EPXL,"The video is set in Hawaii, on the beach and on a sand dune.  The scenery is stunningly beautiful and will quietly lull you into relaxation.  Rodney Yee is the spiritual Chinese hunk in a black speedo who will lead you into a not-too-strenuous series of moves, but who cares?  You're mesmerized by his voice, the cinematography, and the calming music, though much of the time he is just on his back telling you to wiggle various body parts to wake up.  Suzanne Deason is like the aged, former peppy cheerleader who will make you hit all of her marks a little too rapidly.  You will go through moves so quickly that it's nearly an aerobic workout.  This can seem stressful for a beginner, although it is supposed to be for stress relief.  Patricia Walden's p.m. section is far more peaceful and the most difficult, since she will make you hold poses.  Classically beautiful with no middle-aged bulges, Walden also serves as inspiration to be as gracefully well-preserved at her age.  Bottomline, this is a nice video to unwind, but you will need to add more challenging elements to your workout routine to really get into shape.",1042848000,4,1127,4.680203045685279
1254401,3,B00002EPXL,"This has many great poses, but some need more explanitory time for a beginner.",1042675200,,78,4.642857142857143
1254412,5,B00002EPXL,"I've done aerobics, steps, pilates, running...you name it!...but I've never consider yoga as a workout routine, I started practicing yoga and bought this dvd, It is perfect! specially if you are a beginner why?, THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: it has a section where you can learn the name and the posture of each yoga position, which is essential to know if you are a beginner!, the AM workout is great!(all of them are good, but this is my fave)although I just started practicing yoga, I see significance changes in my body and well-being, when I am exercising my form, posture and flexibility is much better! if you are new, be patient, but worth a hundred fold to try yoga and/or combining it with your regular routine.",1041379200,12,720,4.722222222222222
1254413,5,B00002EPXL,I recently just started doing yoga. I don't really have the time to take classes and this dvd is the next best thing. i feel so refreshed and relaxed. this is a must buy!,1041292800,3,170,4.029411764705882
1254414,5,B00002EPXL,"The other reviews have offered ample reasons for purcasing this.  I would add that while the straps and blocks are needed, these can, if you wish, be fashioned from things you have around the house.  A nice wide terrycloth belt from an old robe makes a great strap, for example.
If new to yoga, the best course would be to do Rodney Yee's A.M. Yoga for 21 days.  This will build a healthy habit that will help you more than you can realize.  Each of these lessons, by the way, are very well written and sensitively convey the benefit of the movements while expertly leading you through the actions.
Suzanne Deeston's Yoga for Stress is more strenuous and is very effective.  A week or two into Rodney's A.M. session, you might want to begin with the Stress session after work.
After a week or two of Yoga for Stress, you should be ready for the P.M. session.  But don't rush into it.  Take your time.
If you do nothing other than wake up each morning and do A.M. Yoga, I believe you will find very pleasing results.  I give this a powerful 5 star rating.",1040169600,28,1054,4.369230769230769
1254415,5,B00002EPXL,"What a great way to get three yoga workouts in one DVD!  Three workouts to match the time of day and/or your mood, or both!  I find myself doing AM yoga in the morning to start my day and awaken my senses, stress relief yoga on the weekends when I try to unwind and not think about work, and PM yoga in the evenings to prepare me for a restful night's sleep.  I am a beginner and found these to be just up to my speed, although I think all levels will enjoy.  There are some nice extra features including a chapter search so you can go right to the spot you want, how to use yoga props (VERY informative), nice bios of the three instructors, and even a yoga music feature.  Besides a mat, you will also need a block & strap for these workouts.  Enjoy!",1036022400,6,751,4.074829931972789

""The All-Day Yoga Workout - AM, Stress Relief and PM Yoga for Beginners"" DVD is just what I was looking for.  It's low maintainance and really easy to work with.  I found it so calming and user friendly that I plan to give it as Christmas gifts.
Anyone can use this program and feel like they are accomplishing something.  It's a wonderful tool for beginners out there - Just Like Me!!!!",1035849600,8,551,4.219047619047619
1254417,3,B00002EPXL,"The AM section was *very* easy.  Basically it did nothing for me, so gentle that afterward I felt as though I didn't do anything at all.
The Stress Relief and PM were both very similar, and both surprisingly focused mostly on the legs.  I personally hold tension in my shoulders and neck, and it would have been nice if the Stress Relief focused more on those areas.  But for what they do, both segments are very good.  Beginners should be able to follow along well after watching the segment once, and paying attention to the voice cues.  With continued practice, you'll definitely see more flexibility in your legs.

1254420,4,B00002EPXL,"I highly recommend this program.  I've been doing it for about 3 months.  Totally on for about 1.5 months.. sparastically for about 2 weeks (and I missed the calm, so) I'm back to full on.  I do only 1-2 work outs per day and NONE after 8pm.. They really get your 'chi' moving.  I mistakenly did the PM yoga right before bed, and I was up until 3:30am!
I've recently started a nother exercise program ""Power90"" and this Yoga series is the perfect compliment after each day's workout.. really targets tired muscles and relaxes them with out making your body feel ready for nighty-night.",1023235200,3,585,4.596153846153846
1254421,4,B00002EPXL,"I've done this DVD a few times now. I generally do the AM and the Stress practices at the same time. I feel VERY refreshed and wonderful after doing these two sections of the DVD. I still find the PM practice too difficult for my current ability and patience. Do be sure to wear non-binding clothing to do this workout. I put on an old sleeveless leotard I had from years ago. It leaves all my skin exposed pretty much, except my torso....Back to ""All Day Yoga,"" I think it's terrific. I so love how I feel when I'm do the AM and Stress practices. Also, I particularly like Rodney Yee's AM practice. His voice is calming and his routine is very comfortable. When I have time, I like to do the Stress practice right afterward, although it's a little more challenging. You get a bit more stretching with that workout. I DEFINITELY need to use a block (and sometimes 2 of them stacked!) to do this workout. This DVD is a great way to begin your day! And if you're feeling sluggish mid-day, or after work, I think it's a great pick-me-up for that. You could do Rodney's AM practice even if it was a different time of day. It's clearly the easiest one on the DVD ... especially if you are new to yoga and completely out of shape as I am!",1021939200,16,1232,4.269230769230769
1254422,5,B00002EPXL,"This DVD is a gem and since buying and using it, I'm trying to get all my friends to buy it.  After 13 years of martial arts, I might have more flexibility than some people, but I probably have my fair share of sore spots and tight areas too.  Doing this DVD, both in the morning (the a.m. part) and the night (the p.m. part), for only three days, made a big difference in how I feel just walking around.  My back feels looser than it has in years.  I have never done any type of yoga in my past, but it's making me be much more aware of my posture and how to arrange my body, just in day to day life, for more comfort and health.  The a.m. segment does help to wake me up in a gentle fashion and really improves my mood for the day.  My body feels lithe and limber.  The p.m. segment TOTALLY helps me to put the stress of the day behind me so that I can really rest.  I tend to be a night-time worrier, but the p.m. segment relaxes me and focuses me and I never lie awake and stare at the ceiling or restlessly toss and turn before finally going to sleep, if I've done the p.m. segment.  This DVD will really help contribute to a more healthy life.  It's not a hearty workout - it's very pleasant, and you'll WANT to do the segments.  It's something you'll want to give yourself, not something you have to talk yourself into.  BUY THIS DVD!!!",1017100800,12,1343,4.064638783269962
1254423,2,B00002EPXL,"I have a bad back (fractured my spine unknowingly when I was younger, and never had it looked at), but my spine doc said yoga in moderation would be good. Now, let me start by saying that I have had three Rodney Yee tapes or DVDs and every single one was too hard for me to do.  Either he moves too fast from pose to pose, or he does poses that end up straining my back. The AM part of this is no exception. His poses are too difficult. The PM part of this is all right if I could do it more slowly but it's hard for me to keep up with the instructor. However, the DVD is worth it just for the Suzanne Deason part (Stress Relief) which is calming, easy on the body, and makes me feel good when I'm done.  (The AM and PM make me feel cramped and sore right away when I finish.)  So now all I do is the Stress Relief one.  Worth it though!",1016755200,13,837,3.8488372093023258
1254424,5,B00002EPXL,These 3 programs are short and easy to squeeze into a busy schedule; and they all leave you feeling great. There is a slight feeling of being rushed and not really being able to sink into a pose but that's how they stay within the 20 minute time frame. Sometimes I know I need to stay in a certian pose longer so I do and then rewind and pick up where I left off. All in all this is the best DVD (also avail in video) for a  beginner. I have 7 others and I like this one the best & I use it the most. Namaste.,1016755200,4,509,3.7570093457943927
1254425,4,B00002EPXL,"I got this DVD after reading many reviews as I was a beginner and am also pregnant. I am now 7 months and am still doing all 3 sessions with certain limitations that are address for pregnant women in the beginning of the disk. I wish there was a DVD specific for pregnant women but have yet to find one and this DVD still has many things that I can do. I think it is a great start as after my birth I hope to move to a more advance yoga DVD and am glad that this DVD got me into enjoying yoga. My only complaint which could be my DVD player is that you have to hear the introduction of each segment for you can't just skip to the beginning of the workout. I can forward it but not jump like I can do on other DVDs to a certain part. I highly recommend it though as it is still keeping me interested- which my exercise programs become stale after a couple of months, this one does not.",1007942400,7,884,3.9441340782122905
1254426,5,B00002EPXL,"Well, I guess it really comes down to motivation. This is a great DVD. My wife and I used more than any other of this type, about 4 weeks....but then, for some reason it went on the stack with all the others. I can't really say why, because we both enjoyed it very much, and felt great each time we used it....I think writing this review gave me some extra motivation and I will start again. I was going to rate this a 4, but I got to this point and realized it was my own laziness that stopped me from continuing, so, I just changed it back to a 5. As far as these go, I have two from the series, and this is the better one, and by far better than anything else, including some of the bogus Tai Chi DVD's that I use to even out my poker table. If you are going to buy any of these types of DVD's, this is definitely the one to buy. Just stay motivated....I'm off to stretch.....btw, this is no easy DVD. I'm not in bad shape, and I was really sweating! My wife and I would laugh at eachother constantly. You really learn to appreciate Yoga, that's for sure. Buy it, if you use it more than 6 times it is worth it, and I'm sure you will. Then, wait a few months to review it, and you'll start all over again and hopefully stick with it.....

1254430,3,B00002EPXL,"This is an enjoyable video for some reasons, and I do use the Am yoga at least 3 times a week....but...... As far as it being a ""beginner"" video, I'd have to say that it lacks the instruction needed to be something I would recommend to novices. As a former intermediate practitioner, I found that I understood the video easily but certainly would not have if I had no previous knowledge. I feel that novices should be given as much information as possible regarding the poses they are doing, so as to allow them to get the maximum benefit of this discipline. Novices should be told the names of the poses, why they are so named, what muscles they stretch, what variations can be done, etc. This tape lacks instruction in this area. Also, very few counterposes are done, and these are essential aspects of a workable practice, as are the breathing techniques which are ignored. Only due to the fact that I have already practiced yoga do I feel I know ""how to use"" this video; as I incorporate aspects which I had already known from previous instruction. THE VERDICT: the AM and PM yoga sections really are well designed for their purpose and I would heartily recommend them to advanced novices and experienced practitioners. However, stress relief yoga was a laugh in my opinion....too many props, way too fast, and I must admit that I thought Susan Deeson seems to be a phony--someone just making a buck off of fitness videos. But overall, a worthwhile purchase.",998611200,6,1462,4.670542635658915
1254431,2,B00002EPXL,"Each of the three workouts contain poses that are too difficult for beginners and some that could be very hard on the knees.  The AM section doesn't give enough time for warm up before going into some severe stretches.  Also, the instructors move through the poses too quickly.",997747200,6,277,4.75
1254442,3,B00002EPXL,"I'm definitely in a beginner's range when it comes to yoga practice (only started out last month). This DVD with three short sessions I bought simply based on people's raving reviews and it turned out to be a disappointment. This review mainly focus on A.M. yoga part by Rodney Yee, as that's the only one I feel comfortable practicing with more than a few times per week.
But that doesn't mean A.M. yoga is flawless. The biggest problem, at least for me, is that the pace is way too fast. Even it is seemingly the slowest and most relaxed part of all on this DVD, I always find myself a bit behind. For example, whenever he tells us ""change the side of your legs"", I fall behind and that leaves me with frustration. Of course I do my best so that I can keep up with his graceful movement on TV screen, but it's simply impossible for me at this stage of yoga practice, having been a non-athlete all my life. Also, there are times that I cannot really figure out what he's exactly doing (e.g. ""briging your right knee toward your armpit...) because of the poor camera angle.
As for A.M. part, I do not think the overall movement is particularly challenging, though. Anyone can follow it with ease (if you DO watch it over and over again before actually doing it!)---that's why I tend to stick to Rodney's part most of the time despite its problems.
Other parts, namely P.M. yoga and Stress Relief, didn't hold my attention enough to keep practicing with: the former I didn't like its whole sequence at all (sitting-on-the-hip-and-stretch poses are my least favorites, closely followed by standing poses, especially when they are performed THAT quickly), the latter turned me off completely with extensive uses of foam blocks and, again, it's incredibly fast paced for ""Stress Relief"". (Now I'm slowly beginning to understand that I have an aversion to these Iyengar style instructions!)
Another common problem with these three instructors is their not-so-great cuing techniques. In this respect, Alan Finger of Yoga Zone series(Great place to start! My favorite!!!) and Erich Schiffmann on Ali MacGraw's ""Yoga Mind & Body"" are far superior. If you beginners would like to know what the best cuing sounds like, try their tapes first---you won't regret it. (I know, I know, that Ali MacGraw one perhaps might not be the best choice for absolute beginners for its lack of detailed explanation on poses...yet I believe it's a tape you eventually would like to grow into, if it suits your taste.)
Anyway, I would rate this All-Day Yoga Workout a 3. (4 for Rodney part, 3 for P.M., 2 for Stress Relief) I'm going to sell/give it away as soon as I find a better alternative for my shorter yoga practice. (A couple of recently released Yoga Zone DVD might be the best bet for me, I guess.)",997574400,16,2780,4.6871165644171775
1254443,5,B00002EPXL,"This DVD is very nice.  There are beautiful visuals, soothing music, and the routines are short enough that you feel like you acheived something, but they are short enough for absolute beginners (which I am!).  I would definitely recommend this DVD for someone who has been considering Yoga, but hasn't tried it yet.  I would suggest, if you are a beginner, to already have yoga blocks and a strap for the stretches that you may not be able to fully reach just yet.  A yoga mat is not a bad idea either, but not neccessary.  Give it a try! :)~",997142400,2,543,4.39

I woke up the next day feeling fantastic.  I can't remember feeling this good in years.  I then signed up for local classes in Yoga AND quit smoking (finally)!

I easily can take 20 min. in the afternoon to do the stress relief and it helps me greatly to continue my work more focused. I had purchased the ""Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss"" DVD and started with this on but unfortunately I got a bad copy and it skipped tracks. It seemed to have good exercises but I think the am/stress/pm is the better one for beginners. I also like the visual backgrounds of the DVD.

I enjoy doing yoga, and consider myself to be in the ""Experienced beginner"" range. I find this to be more mediatation oriented, as the instructors provide very VERY basic moves that relax more than invigorate in all three vignettes. This was marketed in a misleading manner, as I think this is intended for those looking for a mediatative guide, or someone perhaps that has been injured and is restarting the workout process. Or for someone that is just beginning their work out routine. The only endearing quality that I can find is that this offers the viewers a detailed content section on the DVD selection menu.

That title is not currently available for purchase as a stand alone from Amazon, on the verge of turning to Ebay, I did one last search, and found this All-Day yoga workout.

The A.M. workout is also one I have done many many times over the years, and I might even have the P.M. VHS too-- however, as I tend to do yoga first thing in the a.m. when I roll out of bed if I own that one, I have not done it often.

As a three pack, though I assure you this is an incredible value-- and I snapped it up. This is a great addition to a collection, and honestly, based on the dozens of tapes I have, this is an AWESOME first in a collection. What a great package.
