6229683,4,B00HVFA33G,"I'm always fascinated by a movie that starts off with the use of a Bible verse. Sometimes it's just a dramatic way to kick things off and means nothing more than that. Other times, the filmmaker is alluding to a message we'll be exploring for the next couple of hours or so. As a Christian, I like when that happens. Lionsgate's newest indie horror film ""The Appearing"" really surprised and impressed me using this approach.

After the death of their daughter, Rachel (Emily Brooks)and Michael (Will Wallace) move to a small town to forget the past and start over. Shortly after they arrive, Rachel begins seeing disturbing visions that seem linked to an old abandoned house. It's the very same location of several disappearances over the years. As Michael digs deeper into the vanishings, he discovers there might be a more sinister power at work.

""The Appearing"" works because it isn't just a possession film. We get plenty of those every year already. It's successful at holding your attention because it blends the aspects of movies like ""The Exorcist"" with ingredients from supernatural thrillers and mysteries with surprise twists in the end.

Lead actor Emily Brooks does an adequate job of portraying the schizophrenic and seemingly bi-polar Rachel. What she lacks in one area she more than makes up for when she lets her hair down and gets demented for the camera. ""The Appearing"" also stars Patrick Swayze's brother, Don. He puts in a heartfelt effort as the God-fearing Sheriff Hendricks. Dean Cain plays a doctor who believes everything can be explained away by science.

Extra points are awarded to ""The Appearing"" because of the religious and Biblical angle it comes to the table with. The people that are possessed in the movie aren't just innocent bystanders. Each one harbored some sort of deep-seeded anger or other negative emotion that acted as a doorway for the demonic force to let itself in. The film serves as a reminder to everyone that we're all capable of committing heinous acts. It's only through faith and self-control that we can overcome temptation and wrong-doing.

""The Appearing"" is rated R for bloody horror violence. However, it includes language and adult situations as well. It's not a movie you'll probably want to use as a study tool for your youth group. Just because it promotes Christian themes doesn't mean it's appropriate for all ages.

The DVD version of ""The Appearing"" has a couple of special features. ""Making 'The Appearing'"" goes behind the scenes of the movie and includes interviews with the cast and crew. They all comment on how great it was to shoot at the actual ""Psycho"" house from the classic Alfred Hitchcock film. There's also a trailer gallery included.

For those looking for a movie that reaches out past the boundaries of most demonic possession films, ""The Appearing"" adds the spices you can find in supernatural outings and crime thrillers. While it's not perfect, enough effort was put into creating the movie to warrant a viewing by any fan of multiple horror sub-genres. It also provides some food for thought in a spiritual sense, which is never a bad thing.",1395446400,7,3132,4.93168880455408
6229684,5,B00HVFA33G,This was a well done exorcism film that had some talented young actors and was well shot.  Pretty sure I saw the old psycho house in there and the exorcism scenes were very cool!,1395014400,4,178,4.235294117647059
6229685,1,B00HVFA33G,"Such a let down, I expected a half-way decent film.....I expected too much.  The movie drags on and on the first half.  I lost interest and googled Don Swazye who appears as the Sheriff in this movie.  Yes, it's Patrick's younger brother & you recognize the family resemblance as soon as he first makes his appearance.  He even sounds like his brother (RIP).  He was the most natural looking actor, comfortable in front of the camera and his skills brought range to his character.  Unfortunately, he wasn't in the story enough to keep this film flowing & captivating, so it crawled on.

HINT:  Playing suspenseful musical tidbits loudly isn't really enough to actually create suspense.  That comes from words on the page.  The story was non-eventful, the rest of crew (lead actor/actress) were stoic and not believable as a married couple - there was no chemistry and not enough talent to pretend there was.

I think you may be as disappointed as I if you choose to view anyway.  I wish I had listened to the first reviewer and passed on this one.  Lesson learned.",1394755200,3,1064,4.686486486486486
6229686,1,B00HVFA33G,"There is a reason why The Exorcist is a classic... Everything was done well, IE; The Acting, The Atmosphere, The Story Telling (Which is what a movie really is BTW.), The Visual Effects, The Timing of Events, The Originality, And so on... Lionsgate failed on all of these requirements for this film. Please, please, please, somebody out there regard the Art of Film Making as only capable by a few. Sadly, so many now can make a film for cheap and even the Big Film Houses are trying. STOP!!! It's costing me, and I'm sure many others, a fortune in renting and buying films which unbelievably 90% are pure nonsense attempts at the very serious task of Film Making. It's time to regard at least intelligence, ability and talent as necessary, not optional, components of film making. I would rather see less films with at least ingredients of fore said components than watch the garbage so often put out these days in the Horror and other genres.

6229694,2,B00HVFA33G,This was a very long ok movie. Characters were a loft and you never really knew just what was going on or what was going to happen next . I was left confused and I hated the ended. This movie was slow so it was hard to remain interested.,1409788800,,237,3.857142857142857

6229698,1,B00HVFA33G,"I tried to watch the whole thing, really did. There was no chemistry between the husband and wife- really they looked kind of creepy together. The ""teens"" around the campfire cannot really be teens... i basically couldn't get passed the horrible acting and had to turn it off. Total waste of my money.",1399766400,,301,4.69811320754717
6229699,2,B00HVFA33G,"Deputy Mike (Will Wallace) and his mousey wife Rachel (Emily Brooks) relocate to the small northern California town of Glenwood Bay following the tragic drowning of their daughter. Mike blames his wife who is currently off her meds. The town has a haunted house and now has a missing high school girl (Abigail Cooper) with a crazed boyfriend (Payton Wood) in custody. A small girl appears and people have hallucinations and appear possessed, etc. etc.

This is a faith based film, which I admit have come a long way from a modern Jesus in a restaurant. What they haven't yet conquered is composing convincing dialogue with actors who can deliver lines. The plot didn't develop a good twist and it was apparent with ""natas"" written at the top of a blood list, it was simply backwards writing. For some reason there are Christians who are obsessed with the idea of demonic backward masking. What was with the bar scene? How is it this northern California town has a bar filled with people who have a southern rural accent?

Film is written, produced, directed, and edited by Daric Gates.

No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.",1397952000,6,1114,4.761658031088083

The preview made it looks good but the actual movie wasn't.

6229704,1,B00HVFA33G,Completely awful movie. I get scared easily and this movie did nothing for me. I could be a better actor in this movie than any of these characters and I have never acted in my life. Don't waste your time or money.,1396828800,6,214,4.119047619047619
6229705,1,B00HVFA33G,"Normally I don't write any type of review on movies I have not seen but this one was inviting me to critique it.  So here goes based on the very limited information I have to work with.  I thought the trailer sucked so bad that I lost all interest in considering watching this film.. you know how trailers are usually better than the movie itself, well if that is the case here then I would not watch this movie even if I was paid several thousands dollars to do so.  Nothing in the trailer looked scary in the least.  I can only imagine that the movie is total fail.",1396742400,,567,4.174311926605505
6229706,5,B00HVFA33G,"First, you have to understand that this is a low budget film, so you're not getting the A-List actors or their talents, and you're not going to get the production value that you might expect from a movie with a multi-million dollar budget.  So once you get past the mental blocks, you can see it for a pretty great film.

I mostly appreciated the twist the movie takes on the exorcism genre.  Without giving too much away, I like that the film focuses more on the characters and their actions as opposed to just the demons and theirs.",1396569600,7,534,4.428571428571429
6229707,2,B00HVFA33G,"Is it just me or is every horror movie released nowadays based on a true story or true events?  It seems like every other tagline I run across states that very thing.  As such, its getting difficult to differentiate between actual legends and/or myths and those created specifically for films.  THE APPEARING is a movie that falls into this category.  But what makes this one so interesting is that neither the film nor the supposed story it is based on make much sense at all.  As a result, this lackluster horror flick contains few scares and even fewer enjoyable moments.

Normally, Im foaming at the mouth after watching a demon or possession flick.  After all, who doesnt enjoy that subject matter?  Earlier this week, I mentioned this very thing in a book review of David Bernsteins DAMAGED SOULS over Shattered Ravings.  I said, I love stories about demons because there seem to be no boundaries. With zombies, you have specific guidelines to stay within: they have to be dead, they are usually rotting, they don't have cognizance, etc. Similarly, vampires usually cannot be out in daylight, they drink blood, etc. You see where Im going. But with demons, all bets are off. Authors can pretty much do what they want and make them as sadistic as they want to be.  This certainly fits for the most partbut unfortunately not here with THE APPEARING.

The cinematography and production value of this film look ok, although the budget looks lean and the quality of film is about that of a Syfy Channel film.  The acting is so-so, and the characters themselves are decent.  So everything up to this point should provide a decent movie experience.

But the story is where THE APPEARING fails.  Theres no cohesion to much of anything, just a random assortment of story lines that never quite mesh together.  Now that it is over, I think I see where the filmmaker was trying to gobut the film never gets there.  I am left with a bunch of questions and nothing that ties them up.

I cannot recommend THE APPEARING, unless you really want to see Patrick Swayzes brother, Don, onscreen.  Although he does a decent job with his role, the movie itself flops too greatly to appreciate him.  I would simply give this one a pass.",1395964800,2,2219,4.684754521963824
