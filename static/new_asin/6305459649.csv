Sammy was captivating and Eddie was as you would  expect..this is a must have and what a treat for the Van Halen fan!!!!",931564800,2,281,4.62
1030513,3,6305459649,"To start, when I received the DVD I discovered that it was formatted for ""Region 4"" which can only be played on DVD players made for use in New Zealand, Australia and Latin America. Seeing as how I'm from the US and the seller knew that, I don't know why he would think I would want a DVD not formatted for the US. I have a older generation DVD/VCR combo that could not play the DVD. So I had to go out and spend $43 for a new DVD player. All for a $14 DVD. Once I got the DVD player, it played just fine. But the problems didn't stop there. As it's been said before, but I'll say it again just so anyone who reads this and doesn't read other reviews will know...this video was filmed over 2 nights, and the idiotic director often cut back and forth between both nights during the same song. So one second in the song Sammy would be wearing a red shirt, and the next second he'd be wearing a yellow shirt. Also, the idiotic director used the footage from both nights, BUT only the audio from one of the nights, so sometimes Sammy's mouth doesn't sync up with his vocals completely. So If you're OCD, and the video and audio inconsistencies would bother you, I wouldn't recommend this DVD. And that's still not the end of the problems. During Eddie's solo, twice the image on the screen changed to widescreen in the center of the screen, and on the top and bottom was the full screen version out of focus. And also during that solo, it changed to black and white at the end. I'm giving this 3 stars because it's ""Van Hagar"" in their prime, and if you see past the aforementioned issues, it's a great concert film.",1458518400,,1612,4.254071661237785

1030557,3,6305459649,"I was at the second night of the two shows recorded for this DVD, and somehow the DVD misses the enhance of that night.  The music was great and the band was awesome that night, but the quality of the recording is lacking, plus it leaves out PANAMA!!! How could you leave a Van Halen classic out of a recording?!?!?  I would only recommend by this one if you are a hardcore VH fan.  Otherwise, stick to the CD, it is a much better recording, and captures more of the essence of a live show.",1389744000,,490,4.136842105263158
1030558,3,6305459649,"This concert video, while not a complete concert, comes close... much closer than the previous ""Live without a Net.""  The trade-off is production value.  While the stage has a few tricks... some pyro used sparingly, and a levitating drum riser, it's somewhat less-imaginitive than the stage from the 5150 tour.  That's a minor gripe.  In truth, three albums in with Van Halen, Sammy Hagar is more confident as the VH frontman this time around, and his presence on the ""For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge Tour"" says that he doesn't have anything to prove... he just fits in the band as if he were always there.  That said, it's unfortunate that we don't have a legitimate live record of David Lee Roth's stint with the band.  Paying respect to Van Halen's legacy with Diamond Dave, Hagar, after a brief explanation that ""what is understood, need not be discussed,"" rips into a more-than-serviceable rendition of the classic, ""Jump.""  There is no love lost between the two frontmen, but this time around the Red Rocker acknowledges Dave's biggest hit with the band.  A good song is a good song, regardless of who wrote it.  The fans wanted to hear it, and VH obliges.  As a film, Right Here, Right Now is shot well on Panaflex cameras.  It is presented largely in the 1.66:1 aspect ratio, letterboxed for most of the show for 4x3 TVs, given that this show predates DVD and HD.  The exceptions to this are a mildly-annoying self-serving intro from the director, some video camera commentary from each of the band members before their respective solos, and some dated video effects during Eddie's lengthy guitar solo.  All-in-all, this is a good performance from all of the guys, and shot well.  Maybe one day it will be re-transferred to HD and remastered without the cheezy video effects.  The sound is in stereo, but the mix is fairly solid, if a little light on the bass.",1380067200,,1866,4.751552795031056

1030603,3,6305459649,"I have to agree with other reviewers who have complained about VH using (at least) 2 different shows and splicing them together.  Too often, what you're seeing is from a different show than what you're hearing.  It's incredibly distracting, especially when the video & audio don't match exactly.  I can see recording 2 nights and using the best performances from each night, but why in the world would they use video from multiple nights in the same freaking song???  It makes you wonder how much of the audio may have been doctored up in the studio (since it doesn't match up with the video anyway, it could be from anywhere).

On the plus side, this was a nice reminder of how good some of the songs were in the Hagar era.  I've always been more of an old school VH fan, but I have to give the Sammy era its due.  It's pretty amazing that they had such huge success with Roth, but if you look at the track listing on this video, very little is Roth-era stuff.  VH completely reinvented themselves and became a new band (and a very successful one at that) once Sammy joined.  Even a Dave fan like me has to respect that.

One final note:  watching this DVD I was pleased to actually HEAR Michael Anthony's bass.  On most of the VH discs, his bass is buried in the mix.  He's loud and clear on this video.",1249948800,,1305,4.3429752066115705

1030605,5,6305459649,This DVD shows Van Halen at the peak of their Sweet Spot in Rock and Roll History.  Great production and editing of two shows over two nights.  You can absolutely tell that the band is having fun and rockin it at the same time.  Buy this DVD if you like pure fun and true Hard Rock !!,1202947200,2,284,3.9473684210526314
1030606,1,6305459649,"After having owned the double CD ""Right Here, Right Now"" for a very long time I was ready for the DVD. I cannot express my disappointment enough by rating this DVD with one star because:

- The song ""Why Can't This Be love"" is missing from the track list (which I could have known if I had studied the box). I assumed it was on it because it's on the CD

- Between the concert there is interview footage with completely uninteresting information from all the band members. Which would have been quite OK if it was on the ""extra"" section of the DVD, not cut between songs of the live concert.",1192838400,3,591,4.267857142857143

1030608,2,6305459649,"To bad this concert is only available in a dolby 2.0 sound version. Also the concert is filmed over a two day period which makes it very strange to look at as the members change clothes during each song.

Wish they would have made a DVD of their last tour in 2004. Hopefully they will film the 2007 tour with David Lee Roth.",1171411200,,324,4.142857142857143

1030610,3,6305459649,"It don't cover the whole tour, Isugest buying the CDs, I was hoping to get to watch the whole thing and see every song from the CDs preformed live, but it wasen't a total loss.",1152576000,3,176,4.057142857142857
1030611,3,6305459649,"A few other reviewers already mentioned it, and it bugs the heck out of me as well.  They blended the footage from two different concert nights to put this video together.  I'm not crazy about seeing Hagar change clothes instantaneously (as someone already mentioned), but I'm REALLY not crazy about watching Eddie play a solo with the video footage coming from concert 2, but the audio is from concert 1.  And this happens frequently in the video where the band isn't exactly playing along with the audio because they swap back and forth between the video footage from the two different concerts, but only use the audio from one of the performances.

Despite what looks like a lip-synching performance at times (because of video not matching audio), Van Halen are in fine form in this, and though I loved the Roth years, I found plenty I enjoyed with the Hagar era as well.  They really seem to enjoy playing up there, and that's part of the reason the band rocks so much.

For audio/performance purists, I'd consider something else, but if you're really a die-hard VH fan, there's some good stuff on here.",1146873600,23,1107,4.709844559585492
1030612,5,6305459649,"It's as simple as that because basically it's the only full concert filmed and edited professionally and released to DVD and will be the last one at the rate Van Halen is going! So buy it and enjoy!

I've been a huge Van Halen fan since the 80's and own all of thier material.  I personally think this is their best concert of all time. I have a copy of the U.S. Festival and while it is truly a classic, the video is horrible due to the bootlegs. But that's understandable! Live without a net is really good, but that whole 80's era and the overall look of the band is cheesy. Some of that stuff including the clothing is hard to look at because I grew up in that era. There are a couple nice Van Halen concerts that aren't released to DVD that a Van Halen fan may want to get if you haven't had a chance to see them. The pay per view material such as the 1998 Australia concert with Cherone is ok, but again, you can tell Cheron didn't quite fit in. The band tried to make it work, but it wasn't there. The only other concert that comes close to right here, right now  is the Toronto show on their Balance tour filmed at a jam packed Molson Ampitheatre. Good set list, great sound but the band was a little banged up. Alex was in a neck brace and Eddie was hurting. But the band still sounded tight, they put on a great show and the sound was great. The Balance songs aren't as good as For Unlawful, but it's still a great show and Eddie's playing was sharp.

But Live Right here right now is some of the best Van Halen concert footage from one of the best bands in the world that you'll find anywhere. However, the one discouraging thing about it was they took video footage from 2 different nights and edited them together.  So for example you have Eddie performing the same solo but notice him wearing different clothing. No big deal because the music is the same and sounds great, but why do that!  The songs they perform are great, the music is fantastic and Eddie's sound is right on, but what may be the best of all is the fact that the album For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge was their best material top to bottom and it shows in this concert.  I've had it on VHS since it came out several years ago and finally updated to DVD. Not an overall big improvement on the video since it came from VHS, but it beats re-winding and fast forwarding.",1121817600,25,2346,4.211581291759465
1030648,1,6305459649,"I have one question to ask--WHY does Van Halen have to do this to their fans? This is pathetic--what kind of moron(no,not Eddie,Alex,Mike,or Sammy--I'm referring to the person who made this)would film two of one band's conerts and mix the concerts all on one DVD? They should have just released the two conerts on two DVDS in one package--who wants to see Sammy Hagar singing a song from the David Lee Roth era of Van Halen in a red cocunut shirt and shorts on,and then,two minutes later,see Hagar sing another Van Halen song from their era with David Lee Roth with a different pair of shorts on and no shirt on(well,not exactly,that was just an example of what this DVD is like--you know what I mean by that)! Save up some cash,go grab the LIVE WITHOUT A NET DVD and Van Halen's VIDEO HITS VOLUME ONE DVD,and then hope that Eddie Van Halen,Alex Van Halen,and Michael Anthony will have enough decence and class to release a more proper Van Halen DVD that gives more recognition to David Lee Roth than it does to Sammy Hagar(no offense--I like Sammy Hagar,but how many times have Eddie,Alex,and Mike been giving more recognition to their replacement lead singer than they have been to their original lead singer? Surprisingly,this time,a great band and great music result in a bad DVD.",1121644800,9,1284,4.711111111111111
1030649,4,6305459649,"This is good DVD despite the fact that it was made by compiling footage from two different concerts. For example: at certain times during the video, you see Sammy Hagar's shirt change color right in the middle of a song. I wish what Van Halen had done instead was just film two nights and use the best one for this video. Some people may say that Live without a net is better because of that. I do agree because this dvd was taken from two nights of video. Other than that, this is good addition for the diehard fan. The sound is even good when viewing on a regular stereo tv and DVD/VCR combo.

Update 10/05/2012. I now watch this on an LCD TV with component cable hook up and the same DVD/VCR combo. The video quality is somewhat grainy like it was transferred from a video tape. That is true no matter what type of video cable you use. I also use a 600 Watt 5.1 (5 speaker and one sub-woofer) Home theater receiver. The sound is PCM but it would have been nice if it was also mixed for Dolby Surround and DTS. They should have just filmed two concerts and then use the best one instead of compiling them like the idiot director did. They should have used a different director and maybe the footage would be just from one concert.",1119744000,6,1232,4.264957264957265

I barely noticed the change. Also, some above posters said the lighting was bad, but hey, indoor concerts are never lit right for photography.  After all, it's a concert, not a tv studio!
 Van Halen was head and shoulders above their contemporaries when they came onto the scene in the late '70s, early '80's. They more than survived a major change of lead singer and improved upon themselves.  Not many, or maybe no other band can claim that. Here they prove they can still rock with the best of them!  Sammy Hagar and the rest of the band give a high energy concert.  This will pump you up enough to use as background music to a workout.
Eddie Van Halen has been an influential and innovative guitar player when it was thought, after Jimi Hendrix, there wasn't any more innovation possible on the guitar.  Before seeing this DVD I had heard Alex's awesome solo before but seeing it I have to say it is amazing he did this with a pretty much bare bones kit.  This man is a great drummer.

To Bad I cant base it just on content because it is such a sick DVD.  There are a couple things that make me slightly discourged and for that I have to settle on a 3 star rating.  First of this guy named Michael comes before the concert and says that he filmed this over two nights.  I didn't think this would be a big deal at first but after five minutes into the concert I saw how lousy it was.  The members clouths are changing every second because it was filmed over two nights and it makes you sick at times!  At some parts the audio and visuals don't match up so it becaomes awakward at times.  It makes me pretty mad.  Also there are no special features on the DVD version.  I bealive they should have added a little somthing extra to the DVD version.

The music is great!  Ed's solo is sick and actually Mike Anthony's solo is pretty solid to for a bass player.  Sammy also performed ""Where Eagles Fly"" on an accustic guitar which was cool.  They also featured songs like ""jump, Runaround, Top of the World"".

The actual content was awsome but I just got to annoyied at the 2 night thing and for that unfornetly I have to give it a 3 star rating!",1105228800,5,1354,4.1937984496124034
1030653,3,6305459649,"I don't get one thing about this DVD - why was it done over two nights?

That's funny, the Live Without a Net concert was filmed over one night. For that reason, it's much better, seeing as how the band member's wardrobes don't change in the blink of an eye, and the music is actually up to sync with the video.",1095206400,3,520,4.009615384615385

Granted, this DVD is a VHS transfer but who cares.  This is an outstanding DVD of Van Halen's For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge tour, from beginning to end this DVD displays what an outstanding rock group they were with Sammy Hagar in the lead vocal position.
There are those out there that have said that Van Halen was better with David Lee Roth but I wouldn't go that far.  Both versions of Van Halen had their particular sound to them, both of which I've enjoyed over the years, when you add Sammy Hagar to the mix though, their music is incredible.
The DVD is a mix of several concerts and some brief interviews.  Although it is slightly distracting with cutting between different concerts and cloths on the same songs it's no real big deal.  As a live bind, their sound is incredible and all four of their solos are absolutely wonderful.  There are a couple of songs where the transfer isn't all that great, leaving a grainy picture, but who cares, for someone like myself who wanted to but never made it to one of their concerts this is a great find.  That being said, it's great to see them back together again and my tickets are purchased for their ""re-union"" tour!

Reason 1: Pee on all of you, this DVD rocks. Every song, serenade, interview and solo is full of proff that Hagar did NOT ruin Van Halen's career. If anything, he re-started it. This thing is pure gold, start to finish, even though several were cut out of the DVD from the original concert.
Reason 2: Pee On all of you, Sammy Hagar rocks. Between Sammy Hagar & David Lee Roth, I can't choose who's better, but everyone has to admit, Sammy rocked the jukebox as much as Roth did, & they're both lightly annoying at times. So, pee on all you non-Van Hagar fans.",1074124800,4,598,4.348214285714286
1030657,2,6305459649,This DVD starts well for about 8 minutes and then slowly puts the watcher to sleep.  Bits and pieces cut up to make up a concert.  It's obvious to me that VH cannot play a concert through without things going wrong.  Eddie's guitar solo piece is particularly disappointing as he makes so many mistakes.  The other disappointment is that he has not written any additional original guitar solo work since the 'without a net' video.  Shame Dave Lee Roth never released a live DVD when he was with Steve Vai.  It would have made Van Hagar look like a bunch of amateurs.,1072396800,,565,4.490196078431373

1030689,4,6305459649,"As a videographer, I found the approach used in filming this rather interesting.  The footage was taken from two separate shows and spliced together.  Hence, as one reviewer pointed out, it looks as though Sammy n' the boys are regularly changing between songs.  While some might find this irritating from a 'lack of consistency' perspective, I can definitely see the advantages of using this approach on a practical level (something inevitably goes wrong during a shoot and backup footage is invaluable).
Personally, I found both the audio and visual elements brilliant.  You really get the feel of being admist the crowd and witnessing something that is unlikely to happen again (sadly most VH fans are still coming to terms with this).  Full kudos to the director.  However, I was dissapointed to learn that not all the songs from 'Right here Right now' live CD are on this dvd, namely 'Give to Live' (the band didn't play this song on both nights) and 'One way to Rock'. In addition some backstage footage would have been nice. Regardless, the dvd gets a definite ""buy"" recommendation from this die hard Van Halen fan. Grade B+",1069459200,,1131,4.864583333333333

1030691,4,6305459649,"I'll just add to the litany of dissatisfaction with this video.  First off, since this is the only live DVD, I have to recommend it, just to see them play and listen to the incredible sounding music.  The performance is great, they don't miss a note.
Unfortunately, the original high quality video shooting is utterly butchered by editing two shows together. As mentioned by many others, it destroys any sense of ""being there"".  It's basically the equivalent of lip-syncing, but worse.  It's like reverse lip-syncing, the moron director syncing a different performance to the music.
And another annoying factor is how often the director cuts away from Eddie right in the middle of a guitar solo in a song.  Quite unbelievable.
Nevertheless, like I said, this is all we got, as far as DVD, so it's certainly better than nothing.  Just sit back, squint your eyes to not focus on the video too much, and enjoy the music.",1058227200,4,917,4.772151898734177

1030693,3,6305459649,"""Live: Right Here, Right Now"" is not Van Halen at their best, but it's good enough.  I am a huge Van Halen fan, and, perhaps, I was just over-anxious to see this concert, but there were aspects about the film that disappointed me.  No. 1:  the video footage was spliced together from two shows.  So, you could be watching one song, and, in the middle of the song, Sammy Hagar's outfit would change.  That became a nuisance.  No. 2: Eddie Van Halen doesn't display his usual over-the-top energy during this show.  No. 3: the song selection could have been better.  Since this was taken from the ""For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge Tour,"" there are too many songs taken from that album, leaving little room for precious older songs.  But most of the songs work and work well!
However, the sound is top-notch.  If it's sound quality you want, not much beats this.  Michael Anthony's bass solo sounds out of this world. (You die-hard VH fans will recognize a portion of ""Sunday Afternoon in the Park"" in the middle of it.  Alex Van Halen's solo is, indeed powerful and impressive, but a little too long.  Eddie Van Halen's solo is a definite crowd-pleaser and it's very good, but I've definitely heard better solos from him.  Finally Sammy Hagar's solo (""Eagles Fly"")  is a nice acoustical change of pace.
""Live: Right Here, Right Now"" is a good DVD, and worth the price, but it lacks the energy and fun of ""Live Without a Net.""",1041984000,6,1419,4.597609561752988
1030694,5,6305459649,"Although several songs are missing in the DVD compared the the CD version, this DVD shows Sammy Hagar-era Van Halen at their best.  Van Halen was always renowned for their live prowess, and this DVD does not disappoint.  SH-era Van Halen was light on Roth-era music, so it is unfortuntate that much of these great tunes are missing.  However, Jump, You Really Got Me, and a whole bunch of Hagar greats are here, ready to rock you.  Eddie Van Halen even integrates a cordless drill into his guitar solo in Poundcake.  Excellent show!",1034380800,,532,4.67741935483871
1030695,4,6305459649,"Hey what can I say, I am a huge VH fan and that is the way it is. I don't care what anyone says, Sammy Hagar is a great front-man. Roth is great also, but Hagar is better. Van Halen basically put on a flawless performance. Eddie is just remarkable, and sammy sang perfectly note for note. The only flaw in the DVD is the editing. I hate how they put the concert together over a 2 night period. During the same song, the band ramdomly changes their clothes. It is obvious that they took the live audio and edited it into the live video. In my oppinion that takes away from the live ""feel"". But other than that it is an excellent DVD to add to any music fans collection.",1029024000,6,668,4.106870229007634
1030726,2,6305459649,"I love Van Halen and have (literally) every CD Van Halen has ever released. However, I was incredibly dissappointed with this DVD. While the sound is excellent, any avid Van Halen fan will have all of these songs, especially the live versions if they bought the corresponding CD, Van Halen: Right Here, Right Now.
The video quality is not only poor (dark, fuzzy and poorly lit), but it does not even match the real audio track. Yes, every attempt was made to match video of Sammy and Eddie with the songs, but it is very clearly dubbed. I've watched this DVD maybe twice, and now it collects dust on my shelf. As far as I can tell, this entire collection of footage was recorded over SEVERAL concerts and was created ENTIRELY in the editing room. Having recently purchased a flawless, high quality, close-up and AUTHENTIC Peter Frampton DVD recently (Frampton Plays Detroit), the quality of the two productions simply can't be compared. If you love loud, crystal clear, high quality sound that matches high quality video in an AUTHENTIC concert setting, don't buy this Van Halen DVD--instead BUY FRAMPTON.
Van Halen will come through (I'm sure) with a higher quality DVD with better production techniques (they need to hire the guy who did Frampton!), but of course, we'll have to wait for their next big tour! Who knows, maybe Eddie can patch up things with either David Lee and/or Sammy for one giant Farewell World Tour. If so, you can bet that a comprehensive, high quality video and audio DVD would FLY off the shelves. Until that time, though, I'd pass on this DVD and wait!!!",1007251200,11,1582,4.7355072463768115
1030727,3,6305459649,"This DVD has no special features, the sound quality isn't even Douby Digital. The footage was shot back over a span of two nights in the same location. From song to song you notice the clothese on the band members has changed.
The setlist is good, the sound the bad gets is good, you get to see eddie perform an amazing solo and pull off his most complex works live. (I'd give it a four for content if I were rating the video version of this, but I believe the DVD release should have been given something more).
Anyway anyone who has seen the band live will know there was some post-production work done here. Sammy Hagar has even alured to this in post-Van Halen interviews refering to it as a b**s live CD and called the CD version of this set the bands weakest album.
Sadly the Balance tour video footage will likely never see the light of day.",993168000,4,848,4.30625
1030728,2,6305459649,"This DVD is a disgrace. A monumental screw up of the highest order. You wouldn't think it would be possible to take a concert by one of the best hard rock groups that ever existed and turn it into a disaster.. but they've done it.
How, you may ask? By sheer arrogance and stupidity. The ""powers that be"" decided that a mere Van Halen Concert wasn't good enough. They were going to make it ""better"". What they did was to take footage of two separate concerts and merge them into one. The video is hacked together from the two concerts, constantly switching back and forth. They don't hide this fact, they announce it right at the start, like they were proud of it. On the surface it may sound like a good idea but as you watch the concert it quickly progresses from a novelty to a minor irritation to a major turn-off.
The problem is this: What you really want from a concert video is the feeling of being there. You want the illusion that you are a part of the concert, that it is a real event and that you are there. This ... merging of two separate concerts completely destroys any possibility of this. Even the clothes they are wearing become major distractions. In a few seconds the singer's clothes change back and forth so fast you can't even begin to figure out which is the 'real' video (which you would suppose matches the soundtrack) and which is the 'alternate' video (which I guess is supposed to be more 'lively' or 'interesting' for that split second). In other words it jumps back and forth so much that EVERYTHING looks fake.
To sum it up: It was a stupid idea. It effectively ruins what would have been a superior concert video. Every time I try to watch it I get so mad I want to put my fist through the screen. Please Please Please... just let us see the bands! Keep your clever ideas on how to improve an artist's art to yourself! These artists have reached the pinnacle of popularity for a reason. They have the gifts we want to see, NOT the editorial meddling of wanna-be film makers.",992822400,5,2006,4.395161290322581

It is a shame that such a good show doesn't have the quality of sound to go with it.  This DVD should never have been released with such poor sound quality. Eddie's guitar solo still rocks.  But, that was the only thing that is not totally destroyed by this hacked up sound mixing.  I would have rated it lower, but VH does put on a great show.",992649600,,437,4.094117647058823

1030733,5,6305459649,"What can I say?All I can say is:It's a Van Halen concert!  How do they do it?Is it because everyone of them is an ultimate proffessional is what he does?Is it because they settle for no less than perfection?Or what is it?To  me(and every die-hard Van Halen fan),the answer is simple:it's Van Halen!  And that's enough for us! This might prove to you that Sammy is incredibly  gifted. I think he's much better than Roth. Pros:
*The  direction(especially lights and cameras) is to die for. It's one of the  reasons why you could watch this concert a hundred times and not get  bored. Fine job,Mitchell. You too Daniel.
*A Sammy Hagar pre-Van Halen  song.
*An Alex Van Halen drum solo(with a cute surprise at its end! But I  won't spoil it).
*A smashing Michael Athony bass solo! You will never  look at a bass guitar the same way again once you see this part!
*AN  EDDIE VAN HALEN SOLO!  This would be enough in itself,and  when you add the other hot solos and songs,you get a masterpiece worth  every cent you'll spend on it. You might never look at a TV screen the same  way again once you see Eddie's breath-taking solo.
*It's a ""For  Unlawful Carnal Knowledge"" tour. That album had some of the best songs  Van Halen ever did(including Man on a Mission,Judgement Day,Poundcake,and  hey,IN 'N' OUT!)
*The crowd was really cool and added even more life to  the concert.
*Brief interviews with some members of the band before their  solos.
*This might sound stupid,but one of the female fans really looks  like Jennifer Love Hewitt.
Cons:
*The concert doesn't include all the  songs avaliable on the audio productions of the concert. For  instance,Panama,Ain't Talkin' 'bout love and other songs weren't  included,unfortunately.
*In 'N' Out doesn't have that ultra cool guitar  opening of the original.
The bottomline is this:if you always hear about  someone named Eddie Van Halen,and you hear people say he's the greatest  guitarist ever,buy this DVD.You might not totally agree with them,but you  will definitely see why they say that. If you aren't a Van Halen fan,this  DVD is the perfect start for you.

Alex has very few equals in the drummer category. He is in a list of  greats that include John Bonham,Vinny Caliuta,Buddy Rich,Dave Weckel,Steve  Gadd,and Tommy Lee. Sammy is without question the single best live singer in  rock history. The man truly has a gift. One listen and you wonder why people  even care about the whole David Lee Roth issue. Roth is horrible live. Lastly  there is Mike the most under appreciated bass player in rock. This videos  editing is not so great. I recommend Live Without A Net.
