7976832,4,B00007JMEF,"My daughter loves Dragon Tails and was thrilled to get this.  Show and sounds are clear, cover pic is good.  Was happy to see it wasn't just some knock off or recorded off the tv!",1399161600,,179,4.085714285714285
7976833,5,B00007JMEF,"My 5 year old granddaughter and I watched this program every day when it was on TV and we were
so upset when it was taken off.  When I found the videos I got them and now she and her younger
sister 2 and I watch them all over again. They are just as good and cute!",1361836800,,264,3.6315789473684212
7976834,5,B00007JMEF,"I have reviewed many dvds of this series.  I can't say this enough...I love Dragon Tales.  In the episode, A Kite For Quetzal, Zak is overly dramatic as usual. He is like this through the whole movie. I love his drama.

I laughed when Ord realizes he takes the wrong paint, and the kids had so much trouble getting the paint off themselves. I could not stop laughing at Ord sneezing when he was allergic to dandelions.

For once Wheezie was stressed in Light My Firebreath.

It was funny to see Zak be chief chef in The Big Cake Mix-UP because he is so careful, and Weezie is so careless.  For example, Wheezie breaks eggs open by using two pot covers.

Emmy wanted to go to see Crystal Cave, and she was too much in a hurry to collect supplies to prepare themselves. For example when they arrived at Singing Springs, they had not brought anything to put water in.  Luckily Max thought of his rain boots.",1330732800,,904,4.37125748502994
7976835,3,B00007JMEF,"These Dragon Tales are not nearly as good as the newer kids' videos like Dora, Diego and Backyardigans.  They have good messages but I found the voices a bit irritating.  The Spanish soundtrack has some translation errors--not that it isn't correct Spanish but that I think the original meaning of some phrases was misunderstood.  It wasn't as good as I had hoped.",1319673600,,364,4.838709677419355
7976836,5,B00007JMEF,"Though my kindergartner has outgrown this beloved series, I have presented DVDs of this PBS show to my friend's young children. The series follows the adventures of 6-year-old Emmy and her 4-year-old brother Max who are able to travel to a fantasy land called Dragon Land and meet many fascinating characters. Their best dragon friends are Cassie, Zak, Wheezie, and Ord, and the wise teacher Quetzal.
This DVD contains five episodes, i.e. ""A Kite for Quetzal"", ""Prepare According to Instructions"", ""The Big Cake Mix-Up"", ""True Blue Friend"", and ""Light My Firebreath"". The stories are interesting, fun, and best of all contain morals that teach young children important life lessons. The extras include four sing-along songs, audio option in English or Spanish, and English subtitles.",1301788800,2,783,5.32258064516129
7976837,4,B00007JMEF,"My daughter loves the DVD, and it was a pretty good price. My only complaint is that the default setting on the DVD is to come on with the subtitles on. Most DVD's come on without the subtitles (since most people don't want them) and then you can turn them on if you don't want them. This DVD is just the opposite.",1255910400,,314,4.080645161290323
7976838,5,B00007JMEF,"My son absolutely loves Dragon Tales, when the show is over on PBS I hear ""again again"" and then I put the DVDs in.  This one is one of his favorites, it keeps him quiet while taking long trips in the car.  It teaches the importance of following directions and is very light-hearted and silly.  My son is 2 1/2 and he follows the stories along.  I can ask him about Weezie losing her firebreath and he'll tell me about it.  The sing-a-long songs are great too!",1105660800,8,460,4.241379310344827
