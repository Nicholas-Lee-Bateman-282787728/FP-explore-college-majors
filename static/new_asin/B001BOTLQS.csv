8283970,5,B001BOTLQS,"I've seen the series on tv but never saw the pilot episode so it was interesting to see how Luke had come about, being an archetype created by the Bane, an alien species that had infiltrated a soft drink being marketed as organic, everyone who drank it become affected, in a brainwashed kind of way, trying to get other people to drink it too. It was a great story and I loved the menu section of the dvd, which scanned the interior of Sarah Jane's apartment. The dvd also had a history of Sarah Jane section, showing some of the earlier Doctors. I have been wanting to obtain the whole series on dvd ever since it finished its run on tv, I don't know why it's taking so long. All the stories were fantastically good, especially the one with the nuns, which was very creepy. I hope they don't make us wait too long!",1215129600,,815,4.298701298701299
