8006212,2,B0000DEYSD,"I bought this DVD to show to my U10 boys team when our practice is rained out.  I watched it myself first and it was a bit boring.  It's like watching a regular practice session of a high school team.  There isn't a whole lot of pizaz that would get boys excited and hardly any real game footage showing passing.  Machanics I can teach myself, but having the boys see how and when passing is done in a real, high level game is something I can't easily do and that's what I was looking for.",1130716800,,489,4.11578947368421
