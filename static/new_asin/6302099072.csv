8324586,5,6302099072,"Before Hollywood discovered the pleasures of New Zealand tax breaks, cheap production costs and skilled technical production studios (The Lord of the Rings) or the beauty of the country (The Piano) there was a vibrant local film industry.

Some of the films were pure crap but as time went on the films became better and better (witness Roger Donaldson, Geoff Murphy et al).

But the quintessential NZ movie has to be 'Carry Me Back'. It is a movie about New Zealanders for New Zealanders. It captures perfectly the essence of the NZ way of life, the droll sense of humour and the absurdity of a people locked on small islands thousands of miles from anywhere.

John Reid's direction is deft, the acting is perfectly understated, the locales are selected with pin point accuracy.

Of course, if you live outside of NZ it may be a mystery but nonetheless it captures NZ life perfectly.

And it's a bloody good yarn!",1353110400,,914,4.723270440251572
