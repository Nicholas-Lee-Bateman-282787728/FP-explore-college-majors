8125394,5,B000FP2PDK,Fast shipment/dvd is a good workout.,1461196800,,36,5.166666666666667
8125395,4,B000FP2PDK,"I really enjoy this program. The exercises are great and I like the way you have the option for 10, 15 or 30 minute workouts. I like the instructor, I wish she had more of these type of dvds! This one fits my schedule perfectly! I would have given it a five if there were music. I can live without it, but like to have the option.",1221264000,,330,3.9402985074626864
8125396,3,B000FP2PDK,"The actual exercises in this video are good, and the instructor does a great job, but the production quality of this DVD are very poor.  I have spent way more than 10 minutes on just getting it to run.  I would follow the menu prompts to the 10 minute section on abs only to have it go back to the beginning or, worse, freeze and I'd have to shut down my DVD player and power back up.  During play, the DVD stops and starts.  The picture is grainy.  There is no background music - this doesn't bother me, but if you are looking for some music to motivate you or keep a beat, you'll have to provide it yourself.  It's too bad because I love the idea of being able to use the sections based on my schedule.  I usually do this stuff after a 40 minute cardio session, so I can skip through the warm up section (that is one nice thing that they have it queued that way) and go right to the exercises.  I haven't been through all the sections, but the ones that I have done were easy to follow and definitely got my muscles burning.",1221264000,3,1026,4.095
8125397,5,B000FP2PDK,I found this video easy to follow and easy to keep up with the instructor. It is great for a daily routine. I have some problems with my knees and I found the combinations to work very well for me. I like that it is a total body workout.,1210723200,,237,3.857142857142857
8125398,1,B000FP2PDK,"If you like high energy and music when you work out, this is not the routine for you! It is very basic and clinical for any one who likes to have fun while getting fit.",1197849600,3,168,3.8285714285714287
8125399,5,B000FP2PDK,"I had a baby 4 months ago and I was feeling too busy to get back into the gym routine.  However, as the cover says, ""everyone has 10 minutes"".  Now I am able to work on toning up my body during nap times. No more excuses!",1152662400,4,221,3.782608695652174
8125400,5,B000FP2PDK,This is a great DVD. I take classes from Kira at least twice a week and if I am unable to attend I do the Video. It is a great workout. You can work out individual body parts in your own home at your own pace. You have the ability to work out at home without ever leaving the living room. Its Great!!,1149724800,6,300,3.7777777777777777
8125401,5,B000FP2PDK,"I really liked the ""Quick Fit! 10-Minuets to Tone"" DVD. It had very good workouts. I also really liked the fact that many of the workouts were short. This made it possible for me to fit work outs into my busy schedule. As a mother of 3, I need a workout that I can do in between naps and soccer practice. I would also reccomend the pregnancy DVD's by Kira! They helped me alot during my last pregnancy; they were really easy to follow and were at a good pace for any pregnant woman.",1149292800,8,482,4.138297872340425
8125402,5,B000FP2PDK,This video is really great. I have been using it for a month now and I'm having great results. It's easy to do every day. Helped me get back into shape quickly after having my baby.,1148256000,5,181,4.055555555555555
8125403,5,B000FP2PDK,"Being a mom of a two year old makes scheduling time quite difficult.  With this DVD's choices of what areas to work, along with the length of work out time, I can easily fit it into my busy schedule.  It doesn't take long and the results are rewarding.  It's a quick and easy way to lose all the extra baby weight while toning the entire body.",1148083200,4,343,4.166666666666667
