2455011,2,B000CAPVT8,Sadly this caused the recipients (my daughter and her boyfriend) a lot of trouble. It came postage due and wasn't redelivered even after they paid the extra 59 cents or whatever. Don't you have a post office with a scale?,1296604800,,221,4.55
2455012,3,B000CAPVT8,"This one is obviously not a Hollywood type production.  It looks, sounds, and feels like something that I could of put together myself using Microsoft movie maker, which is disappointing for the price.  Bill Parcels does have some good insight and advice, but what he -and all the other professionals that were assembled for this football training tool- have to offer are very simple and very basic.  If you have absolutely no idea what you are doing when it comes to coaching football, then this will be a good place to start.

It is disappointing to see that instead of showing the correct technique and form when conducting these drills, they use some random dads and sons to execute the drills, which really doesn't give a good idea of how they are supposed to be done.  All the drills and examples are very brief and rushed.  The highlights are OK but I can download those on You Tube.  This video could have been so much more in quantity and quality, especially for the price. This is great for fathers trying to help their sons improve, but not all that great for a coach trying to improve his team.",1278115200,2,1106,4.555555555555555
2455013,5,B000CAPVT8,"I am thrilled with the quality, substance, and entertainment value of this youth sports series.  Finally there is a product available to parents and coaches alike which not only concentrates on the fundamentals of football taught by the experts, but also elevates the importance of ""character"" training as well.  Thanks Backyard Drills - job well done!",1239580800,4,352,5.267857142857143
2455014,2,B000CAPVT8,"Unfortunately, right after ordering the product, I found it more than 100.00 Dollars cheaper at the Dallas Cowboys page. I regreted my purchase deeply.",1169078400,8,151,5.333333333333333
2455015,5,B000CAPVT8,"I am a father of a young football player. Before I bought this dvd, I would say my sons skill level was equal to Charlie Frye or Treant Dilfer possibly Kosar. Anyways you get the picture a very bad quarterback! Since he is learning from players from Different NFL teams and a hall of fame coach(Parcells) he has learned about cutting down on the fumbles like Ernest Byner. His interceptions have gone down considerably unlike Brian Sipes career. I don't know how well he will learn to ride a motorcycle in the future, but I am sure that a trained chimp can do it better than Kellen Winslow! Thanks Tuna! Go Cowboys!",1137024000,4,615,4.5
2455016,5,B000CAPVT8,"I got one for my son's birthday.  Finally I get to watch my husband having fun with the kids.  Our 10 year old especially loves football and looks forward to their short training sessions together.  Plus the players are so ""cool"". My husband has a great time because he finally has something to do with them and the kids love having his attention!  It's just really great to see them having so much fun together.  My sister is returning the video game she got for her kid for Christmas and is buying one of these.  Thanks for giving us the choice.",1133136000,13,547,4.366336633663367
8096549,1,B000CAPVT8,This DVD set doesn't play in DVD player or computer.  Can't return now... DO NOT ORDER THIS,1471824000,,91,4.352941176470588
8096550,5,B000CAPVT8,Purchased for my husband who is a little league football coach. He loves the drills included in the book and uses them with his football team.,1442880000,,142,4.5
8096551,4,B000CAPVT8,Very helpful!,1436659200,,13,6.0
8096552,2,B000CAPVT8,"i bought this in a search for a good youth football coaching dvd and when I saw Bill Parcells name I bought it expecting quality instruction and drills. While there is good advice on discipline and character and some very basic drills on stances, route running,quarterback exchange and pass catching, I was disappointed.  This is very basic and it seems as if it was thrown together very quickly with too much fluff and not  much depth. The menu is confusing and very difficult to navigate. You would think that Parcells would be involved in a more detailed production. If you are familiar with football, you already know this material. If you are looking for material for drills, practices etc. for youth football, look elsewhere.",1407196800,,731,4.887096774193548
8096553,2,B000CAPVT8,Communicated with seller. They gave me some tips to get the dvd to play but no luck. My son was really disappointed,1400457600,,115,4.2727272727272725
8096554,5,B000CAPVT8,"For the price, it's difficult to beat.  Great ideas for drills at each position.  The QB portion is especially good.  The dynamic between Star Player / Dad / Son is a bit awkward at points, but definitely a lot of good content and information.",1390348800,,243,4.4772727272727275
8096555,1,B000CAPVT8,Boring. I just thought more was going to be with DVD. The instructions were really vage. The DVD menu set up screen was extremely difficult to navigate.,1379203200,2,152,4.666666666666667
8096556,5,B000CAPVT8,"Great video. Great way to work on football movements. Parcels hall of game coach, he knows his stuff. Check this one out!",1378771200,,121,4.545454545454546
8096557,5,B000CAPVT8,"I wish I would've had this movie when my son was younger! IT EXPLAINS A LOT! in a very cute way....the part you will love is the referree signals are acted out and explained! I just did a quick browse, but I believe that it's a great way to show the fundamentals of football~Im a mom and his dad has no interest in football to teach any kind of skills to a child that is interested,,,so this is a good way to learn as a parent and a new young athlete",1369094400,3,450,3.956043956043956
8096558,5,B000CAPVT8,The video has solid information for beginners and experienced players.  The menu is a little difficult to use but the information is great.,1345334400,2,139,5.043478260869565
