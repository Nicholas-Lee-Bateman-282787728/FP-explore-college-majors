7996334,5,B0000A9GHZ,"I really enjoyed this movie, it is obviously a low budget production, but I was really impressed by the passion and energy behind the film making, I highly recommend it!  Also I suspect that Mister vandenberg, the lead actor is headed to higher and finer things.  Keep a eye out for him.  He posseses a raw energy i haven't experienced in a while!",1067817600,,347,4.476190476190476
7996335,5,B0000A9GHZ,"The Honorable is a fine example of independant film making. It is a dark film about the sleezy side of nightclubs and gangster wantabe's. It is filled with action, seduction, and emotion. I enjoyed Eric Etebari's portrayal of Jr. Lopez. Eric is a fine actor and brought this character to life. This fine actor should be used in more mainstream as well as many more independant films.",1062806400,2,383,4.731343283582089
7996336,5,B0000A9GHZ,I love how Eric Etebari protrayed his Charactor Junior Lopez.  Eric Etebari made the charactor alive and believable as a thug. I enjoyed watching Eric and will be looking for him to be cast in more major roles. He is an up and coming actor worth watching. He has an amazing talent to bring the role he plays alive and believable. His body language and voice add that special touch to the charactor he plays.,1062547200,4,407,4.426666666666667
7996337,5,B0000A9GHZ,"I saw this film at the First Glance Festival In Los Angeles, I really went to see it because of Eric Etebari, who I liked from the TV show ""WitchBlade"".  But I sat enthralled by this picture of life in the LA nightclub and underworld, it's a dark and brooding piece that takes it's time unwinding.  But, there's a subtle intensity that stays with you after the movie's over.  Sure it was probably low budget, but the energy in the performances and the ingenuity in the story telling more than make up for that.  I noticed the lead actor, Dominiquie Vandenberg is in ""Gangs of New York"".  Perhaps this is the first work of a real ""new action hero"".  He reminded me of Charles Bronson in his hey-day.  I recommend this film, very good -- (I have ordered it!).",1061769600,2,757,4.402877697841727
