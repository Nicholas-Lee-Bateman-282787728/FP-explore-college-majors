112604,1,0790741067,Why would Criterion not add closed captioning to expensive make over of classic movies???  This would almost seem like a criminal act.  Robert Altman directed this movie while having everyone talking over each other in 70% of the movie.  I couldn't understand the dialogue which sounds like everyone else is high on opium like Mrs. Miller.  Robert Altman thought he would be cool and purposely distorted the camera shots in this movie which had a lot of potential.  The video is so bad that even Criterion could not clean up the garbage.  The ultimate blame has to be with Robert Altman who made a movie for Robert Altman and certainly did not care about the movie goers.  CRITERION should be ashamed of themselves for not providing CC for all their releases.,1501200000,2,759,4.748091603053435

The two star review represents my dissatisfaction because the Blu-Ray version of McCabe and Mrs. Miller does NOT have closed captions, nor any subtitles that I can find. The Criterion Blu-Ray disc offers only this: MOVIE, TIMELINE, CHAPTERS, COMMENTARY and SUPPLEMENTS. There is no LANGUAGES to select even though the jacket has an SDH symbol.

My older DVD version (out of print), which began locking up at one spot and disabling any action for SKIP, FAST FORWARD and FRAME by FRAME, offers the choice of PLAY MOVIE, SCENE SELECTIONS, SPECIAL FEATURES, and LANGUAGES. It provides CC and subtitles in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese & Japanese. The Criterion Blu-Ray version has apparently left the LANGUAGES out.

I rented this movie after hearing a great review on NPR.
My wife and I sat down to watch it only to find that, unlike every other streaming service that we use, Amazon fails and fails and fails to stream properly. Completely unwatchable.
Finally, we gave up and decided to try our luck again the next day. Amazon, in it's infinite wisdom, had canceled our order because, for some reason, once a movie has begun to be watched, you have less than 24 hours to finish it or it must be paid for once more.
Ridiculous. Utterly asinine.

Criterion has outdone themselves once again, with this Robert Altman classic.  What else can be said about the film?  It's fantastic.  It's funny, bleak, exciting, violent, poignant, evocative.  The music is great: featuring songs from the late Leonard Cohen, which are anachronistic to the time the film depicts, yet seem to fit the images perfectly.  It contains a wonderful ensemble cast, in addition to its stars, Warren Beatty and Julie Christy.  If you have any interest in the New American Cinema movement (70's Cinema), then this is an absolute must-see!  The last twenty minutes feature a gun battle in a snowstorm.

The story is slow and not exactly edge of your seat.  Even though I watched this with headphones on, a lot of the dialogue is hard to hear, sort of mumbled in the background.  Still, there is something unique about the movie.  I didn't love it.  I didn't hate it.  The primary mood of the movie is darkness and gloom.  Two hours of it.",1479600000,,495,4.170212765957447

112673,5,0790741067,Many reviewers have termed this one of the greatest movies of all time.  I concur - saw it first in 1971 when it came out and had to watch it again (it was time ;-).  Stands up very well and interesting to see some actors I'd forgotten were in it.  The Leonard Cohen songs fit the images beautifully.,1477958400,3,300,4.137931034482759
112674,5,0790741067,"Since there are so many reviews that mine would be redundant, I will just say that McCabe may not have ""killed Bill Roundtree,"" after the townseople (including Mrs Miller) get off their highs, they will eventually see all of the evidence but of course Pat Sheehan will blab it all over Presbyterian Church. He'd even be a major player in putting McCabe on a pedestal, if any sequel were made. (But none was, of course.) That idealistic lawyer, Clement Samuels (an anagram of ""Samuel Clemens"" aka Mark Twain), extolled the virtues of justice in its purest form and assured McCabe he'd be one. But all McCabe wants is to stay alive, and all Mrs M wants is to be opium high. One of my favorite movies. Leonard Cohen's songs are in my repertoire. The Stranger Song (McCabe), Traveling Lady (Mrs Miller) and The Sisters of Mercy (the whores) are perfect music for this, another Robert Altman great. This was the way people looked and behaved. The commentarians assured the viewer in this DVD that the snow was real, the buildings were erected during the film's progess, and that shaggy, dirty sheepskin coat Butler wore stank to high heaven. Everything is real. It is one of the unsung great films.",1477094400,2,1193,4.712918660287081
112675,4,0790741067,"McCabe & Mrs. Miller is Robert Altmans 1971 revisionist Western starring Warren Beatty and Julie Christie. In 1902, John McCabe (Beatty) arrives in the Pacific Northwest mining town of Presbyterian Church. His goal in town is to establish a business, and pretty soon he opens a gambling house/brothel, becoming the most prominent man in town. Some time later, Mrs. Miller (Christie) arrives in town, is unimpressed by McCabes establishment, and  proposes that she and McCabe team up to run a swanky whorehouse, with baths and clean sheets part of the plan.

Like Sam Peckilnpahs The Wild Bunch, McCabe & Mrs, Miller is about civilization inevitably coming to the frontier. Its also a picture that undermines the image of the Western hero, which reigned supreme in Hollywood from William S. Hart to John Wayne. The whole notion of masculinity is subverted by Altman. We see the townsmen sitting around the bar gossiping while Cockney newcomer Ms. Miller immediately takes command of her destiny to get what she wants. With her larger-than-life personality, shes no match for McCabe, who appears genuinely flummoxed by this brash, self-confident woman with a strong will. Yet they're a good team and their partnership is extremely profitable until the mining company becomes a dangerous adversary.

Miss Christie is easily the best thing in the picture. Her Constance Miller is a feminist well before the term existed  a tough, intelligent woman who knows her strengths and exploits them. Though actresses like Bette Davis and Rosalind Russell had portrayed strong, independent women long before Julie Christie, Mrs. Miller is an unexpected ingredient in a familiar genre that usually portrayed women as school marms, prostitutes, or homesteaders wives. The supporting cast includes familiar Altman actors Rene Auberjonois, Shelley Duvall, Keith Carradine, and John Schuck. The Canadian cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond is striking and adds greatly to the atmosphere, as does the set  an entire town constructed for the film.

Bonus features on the Blu-ray release include audio commentary from 2002 featuring director Robert Altman and producer David Foster; new making-of documentary featuring members of the cast and crew; new conversation about the film and Altmans career between film historian Carl Beauchamp and Rick Jewell; featurette from the films original production; Art Directors Guild Film Society Q & A from 1999 with production designer Leon Ericksen; excerpts from archival interviews with cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond; stills gallery; excerpts from two 1971 episodes of The Dick Caveat Show featuring Altman and film critic Pauline Kael; and a critical essay.",1476835200,2,2679,5.427884615384615
112676,5,0790741067,"Best non-conventional but realistic western ever.  Probably provided inspiration for HBO's ""Deadwood,."" some 30 years later.",1476403200,3,124,6.75
112677,5,0790741067,"One of Robert Altrman's classic films and an inversion of the traditional western, ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller"" came about because of the success of ""M*A*S*H"" allowing Altman the freedom necessary to pursue this unusual project. Make no mistake, this isn't an action western like the classic ""The Magnificent Seven"", ""The Searchers"", ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" or ""High Plains Drifter"" but is an intense character study of the people that populated the old west.

Featuring songs by Leonard Cohen to punctuate and underscore this character study, Warren Beatty and Julie Christie star as the title characters. McCabe and Mrs. Miller show up at the town of Presbyterian Church where the miners lead a largely arid existence of work, drinking, gambling but without the ""superior whorehouse"" experience that the duo mean to provide at a healthy profit. That leads, of course, to conflict with the powerful mining interests that occupy the town and, ultimately, a show down between McCabe and their representatives.

Director of photography Vilmos Zsigmond (""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"") and Altman create visually unique photography for the film with its blown out colors and contrast. Zsigmond and Altman deliberately baked in the look of the film by ""flashing"" the film i.e., partially exposing the negative combined with a fog filter to often the images. This was to prevent the studio from messing with their vision for the film. Altman and Brian McKay's script (based on the novel ""McCabe"" by ex-patriot author Edmund Naughton) create a series of rich characters. Like ""M*A*S*H"" this isn't a traditional genre film but, instead, the makers play with the conventions even of both the old and spaghetti westerns that were all the rage at the time. Interestingly, Leonard Cohen had not seen Altman's ""M*A*SH"" but elected to provide his music for the film after seeing and enjoying Altman's ""Brewster McCloud"" a cult classic that failed at the box office. When Cohen first saw ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller"" he disliked the film but allowed Altman to use his music anyway (Cohen changed his mind when he saw the film for the second time).

Interestingly, the sets were being build by Americans in Canada (it was shot in Vancouver) who were trying to escape the Draft and they built the town while Altman actively shot the film with each one wearing period clothing and also functioning as extras in the film. It adds to the atmosphere of a frontier town in the Pacific Northwest.

The Criterion Blu-ray looks much like the dreamy version I remember seeing in theaters as a young adult in revival houses back in the day. Because this presentation is true to what Altman and Zsigmond wanted, a discussion of traditional sharpness and colors is largely a waste of time--like Brian De Palma's ""Obsession"" or Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" the films has a unique look to it which makes such discussions useless. I will say that the film has never looks better with a new 4K transfer and the original mono soundtrack presented uncompressed with dialog sometimes a blur as with all of Altman's projects. Keep in mind the choices made for the look for this film will prevent a sharp, brilliant looking blu. You have to accept the look of the film for what it is.

Dialog continues to be a cacophony of sound--using personal microphones with each one getting its own track allowed Altman to pick and choose what bits of dialog he wanted the audience to hear creating a unique aural experience. He would refine this further with future features.

The special features are terrific with an older 2002 commentary track from the DVD featuring Altman and Producer David Foster. Criterion also provides a new documentary on the making of the film, film historians Carl Beaucamp & Rick Jewell in a new featurette on Altman's career and the place that ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller"" occupies in his filmography. A 1999 discussion by the production designer Leon Erickson on the project is also included. The late Zsigmond is represented by an archival interview on the film while Altman is represented (again) from two episodes of ""The Dick Cavett Show"" (1971) featuring film critic Pauline Kael as well. Novelist Nathaniel Rich provides an excellent essay on the film and Altman while things are rounded out by the original trailer.

One of Altman's masterpieces, ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller"" never got the attention that ""M*A*S*H"" or later Altman films like ""The Player"" did. This terrific reissue remedies that situation with a healthy group of special features, a ""true"" looking presentation of the film and interesting essay discussing its impact. This classy package is worth it for fans of the film.

Highly recommended.",1476144000,26,4702,4.996168582375479

It's a gritty looking western which is less about gunfights and more about the West. It's a film that a sophisticated Western fan should appreciate. Altman shows us life on the frontier and how dangers lurk virtually everywhere. There's no place in this film for the hero who shoots up the place and rides off into the sunset. Even the least invested people, like McCabe, have a great deal to lose. A man's reputation follows him everywhere on the frontier, he can't actually escape what people think of him.

Leonard Cohen's lyrics of lamentation mesh perfectly with the Altman's laconic camerawork as it flows along the landscape.

112694,5,0790741067,"Robert Altman's films did not always come together as they should, his style of film-making depending on large groups of actors and loose plots, but when they did they were marvels to behold and this is one of his very best. It's a mood piece and character study and not the action picture some people expect in a nineteenth century Western setting., and so the film has its detractors.  If you are willing to settle for what it offers it's very rewarding.

The film is set in the Pacific Northwest, largely in winter, which is one of the reasons I have difficulty thinking of it as a Western, though many praise it as one of the greatest Westerns or anti-Westerns. I don't see many of the big Western tropes in the film (though there are some) and feel Leone's films are the real anti-Westerns, but that's just about labels and not all that important anyway. This is brought up enough in discussions of the film to merit comment.

McCabe thinks he is a gentleman. smooth and clever, a shrewd businessman and gambler who doesn't deny a possible reputation as a gunslinger. He comes to the small town of Presbyterian Church which is beginning to grow  because of a profitable nearby mine. He has come to literally build a house of gambling and prostitution. He knows nothing about running such an establishment, but into the town comes Constance Miller, a woman who does. She convinces him he needs her expertise by asking, ""What do you do when one girl fancies another?"" Together they thrive with Mrs. Miller basically Chief of Operations and McCabe a good ol' boy front man for the customers. They get along despite big differences in character but there is no big romance or anything like that. Life goes on and you begin to feel familiar with this group of people and the day to day events that go on. Then a big corporation sees an opportunity to buy up all the town's establishments to profit on the miner's paychecks and make it a company town. McCabe thinks he can make them up their offer and thing get complicated from there.

The film is beautifully shot from the snow and evergreen outdoors to the dark and cozy interiors that keep the cold out. Every actor is spot on, from the two principals to the most minor locals. The soundtrack includes moody Leonard Cohen songs brooding and existential, his deep voice intoning, ""You chose this journey long before you came upon this highway"". Together these create a unique and special place unlike any other film you've seen.

The film splits audiences with the very factors that some see as its greatness the things that others don't like. There is little plot beyond the basic setup and a major decision or two. This is a slice of life film that audiences used to plot-driven vehicles simply don't get. It can often seem like nothing is going on when what is going on is in the small daily actions and conversations of the characters. There is a casualness to the manner of acting that makes it sometimes feel like a documentary rather than a traditional film. The really dark and dirty interiors seem simply murky to some and the Leonard Cohen songs seem anachronistic as well, either too new for the setting or too much of the seventies for today. Some find none of the characters admirable and want a more heroic drama and others find the whole thing too bleak. i am of the opposite opinion, but I think it's useful to point out  what some see as negative aspects of the film.  I feel it's one of the greatest films of the seventies and certainly worth checking out.",1458345600,9,3526,4.594594594594595

I felt more and more depressed the longer I watched until I had to stop.  Maybe it was the constant rain, maybe the fact that human trafficking figures so prominently in the plot.

112740,5,0790741067,"I have seen a lot of westerns. There are, of course, John Wayne's Big Jake, Shane, Rio Bravo, even Cahill: United States Marshall.
I am in love with Sergio Leone's opus, Once Upon a Time in the West, his Man With No Name trilogy, and even Sergio Corbucci's depressing The Great Silence. They are all magnificent in one way or another, but only one western has ever reached sublime perfection, and that is McCabe & Mrs. Miller.
To start off, as many are aware, this isn't your typical western, it's an anti-western, set in the murky Northwest in a small mining town. It sets out to subvert or just totally ignore any and all conventions of the genre and goes for something much greater.
This film is very, very sad, yet authentic. This has to be the most realistic portrayal of the West that I've ever seen. The photography is stunning art, every shot, every frame is a painting.
The film might feel like it's lacking a plot, but Altman draws you into the lives of these simple people. One day, McCabe rides in and quickly makes a name for himself and gambles his way to his dreams. Mrs. Miller arrives and qjickly makes him realize how outmatched he is by her fast talking and all business attitude. Another day, a woman tries to kill another with a knife. On a bad day, Ida's husband Bart is killed.
Life goes on. These are ordinary people, people you might have known of a past time long ago.
The ending is heartbreaking, yearning for love and warmth that will never have come. McCabe is hunted by the killers, and he dies. He dies alone in the snow, frozen, swept away, as Mrs. Miller just shuts down her mind in an opium den, with Leonard Cohen's haunting Winter Lady playing. It's an utterly beautiful and unbearable scene.

Everyone should watch this film. It's criminal this film hasn't a good restoration yet. Maybe by Criterion. I hope. They're released a few of Altman's other films, including Nashville. There's no way they can't release this one.

A haunting, spellbinding, bleak, beautifully sad and mournful anti-western and the greatest western of them all.

112752,5,0790741067,"This film could only have been made by Robert Altman in the Seventies.  Gambler John McCabe (Warren Beatty)  serves as sort of a surrogate to Altman demonstrating in the film the maverick spirit in bringing a first class bordello to the Pacific Northwest mining town as Altman brought to his work.  The similarities don't end there.  It's legend that Altman fought the studio bean counters about bringing his vision to the screen just as McCabe feebly fights off the robber barons in taking over his interests. This film is as much  a Western as a brooding mood piece.  Altman bathes the landscape with washed out colors and ramshackle structures.  The people occupying these abodes are right at home seemingly owning one set of clothes and hygiene being an afterthought.  The melancholic song score by Leonard Cohen matches the film's rhythms to a tee.  The stars are Beatty and Julie Christie and they are excellent but it's in the supporting parts that Altman has cast that gives the film it's essence.  Altman utilizes his usual ensemble of the time (Rene Auberjonois, John Schuck, Shelley Duvall, Keith Carradine) and they are perfect for their roles.  Not to give anything away but Altman ends his film with Christie laying down in a haze of opium smoke oblivious to the cataclysmic happenings in the town of Presbyterian Church.  This ambiguous ending falls perfectly with the narrative that Altman established with the rest of the film.  When this film was released on DVD in 2002 Robert Altman was still alive to offer a commentary on the disc.

Set in the Pacific Northwest in 1902, Robert Altman's ""anti-western film"" as he called it, is unconventional to say the least.  As the lone figure of John McCabe (Warren Beatty) rides into the new town of Presbyterian Church in a cold rain, you can't but wonder what fate awaits.  It turns out he's a gambler and a business man, muttering under his breath something about not letting it happen again.  We can assume he wore out his welcome at his last stop.

As we find out later in the movie, gambling really isn't McCabe's strong suit.  But public relations is.  He captures the hearts of the local 125 towns folk, who are mostly men working in a mine, by buying rounds of whiskey even when he's losing at cards.  Eventually, he decides to call it home and commences to build a saloon with the sideline of also operating a whorehouse.

As Altman slowly progresses the story, based on Edmund Naughton's novel, it takes a turn when McCabe is introduced to upstart hooker who believes that McCabe needs her to run the brothel.  In fact he does.  Mrs. Constance Miller (Julie Christie) will occasionally do a trick, but only for $5 rather than the meager $1.50 the other girls charge.  She charges the same to McCabe, now her partner, who is an overnight regular.

As the business prospers, McCabe is confronted by a couple negotiators of the mining company who want to buy him out.  This is where McCabe overshoots his gambling acumen.  With what appears to be a fair offer, McCabe shoots down the offer and counters with something unreasonable, assuming that the negotiations would continue.  They don't.  The bluff didn't work.  In fact, the company sends a trio of killers to remove McCabe as an obstacle.

In perhaps the most memorable scene, the youngest of the trio known as the Kid (Manfred Schulz) decides to have fun with a young guy (Keith Carradine) there for just the ladies.  On a walking bridge over a creek, the innocent man is gunned down in cold blood by the Kid.  Point made.  There is no law enforcement in the town, and McCabe, even with a hint that he may be a gunslinger himself, is no match for the 3 hired guns.

Still, left with no alternative, McCabe is able to almost pull off a win.  Well technically he won the battle but paid a high price.  The highest.  With a fine supporting cast including Rene Auberjonois, John Schuck and Corey Fischer, Altman weaves an authentic time piece and a strong film that stands the test of time.  Seen on DVD, the technical aspects of the film beg for Blu ray.",1375833600,8,2545,4.573008849557522

112811,2,0790741067,"The traditional view of the old west is that of the courageous self-reliant man who pits himself against nature, Indians, and all things evil and emerges triumphant, (or at least dies trying).  Robert Altman, known for his work in MASH and Nashville, uses McCabe and Mrs. Miller as a vehicle to expose the real west.  The real west of Altman's mind is composed of weak-willed, morally compromised minions who sell their soul to the highest bidder.  In this case, McCabe (Warren Beatty), a weasel in a nice suit, sets up a brothel in the non-descript mining town of Presbyterian Church, misnamed of course, because no one in the town attends the church. McCabe is moderately successful in his flesh peddling, but when Constance Miller (Julie Christie) offers to upgrade his brothel and split the profits, he becomes so successful that rivals decide to buy him out or take him out (kill him).  McCabe falls for the drug-addicted Mrs. Miller, who warns him to sell out to the rivals or lose his life.  McCabe, who initially foolishly disregards the rival's offer, realizes that he must kill or be killed when three hired killers come to town and aim to gun him down.  The ending (not revealed here), is Altman's antithesis answer to the traditional shoot-out on main street at high noon.  It ends in a whimper, not a bang.

This is probably a very accurate view of the old West, where people were more led by their emotions and moral weaknesses than their moral courage and valor.  As the editor of the Shinbone star so famously states in ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence"", ""When the legend becomes fact, print the legend"".  In other words, real life is not as compelling as myth and legend.  While likely accurate, Altman's dreary realism does not make for great (or exciting) viewing. Quite frankly, I found this film to be melancholy and unexciting.  I could not get emotionally invested in the movie due to the ambivalent collection of Altman's cast of characters.  There was nothing to like here, nothing to get behind and root for.

There is some good acting, especially from Julie Christie, Keith Carradine, and Warren Beatty, but even good performances from the stars of this drab affair cannot lift this film out of its doldrums.

Age does not wither it, however - it seems just to get better, and in some ways even more pertinent (monopoly capitalism v. small business enterprise, community organization, &c.).  Also, too, Leonard Cohen.  One of the rare really good commentary tracks from Altman and the producer - I was surprised to learn (though I should not have been) that it was shot in sequence, that there was a housing subdivision going up just around the corner, that snow fell just when it was needed, and that horse was pure luck.  And that Julie ate that whole, appalling meal by her very own tiny self.

112818,3,0790741067,"Too much of McCabe & Mrs. Miller tries to preach 1970s values at its audience, when it should be instead trying to recreate the virtues of the late 19th Century, and this schizophrenia is yet another major flaw of this film. A good example of this comes in an otherwise throwaway scene with William Devane as an unnamed lawyer that McCabe seeks advice from on how to battle the company that is trying to muscle him out of the action. Devane tells him that he can be a hero, and strike a stand for the little man against corporations that plunder the environment, but, as McCabe is an inveterate con artist, the idea that he would buy such hippy-drenched drivel is laughable; especially considering such advice is tantamount to a death warrant.

  Overall, McCabe & Mrs. Miller is not a terrible film, although a viewer does not care, much less identify, with any of the characters, but it is not a good film, even if one, Heaven forfend, actually finds Leonard Cohen's songs somehow interesting, and it is certainly nowhere in the universe known as perfection, period.",1339027200,4,1068,4.7005347593582885

However, the western that hit hardest and seemed most compelling and personal to me is McCabe & Mrs. Miller.  The characters are rich, real, and endlessly fascinating, and of course the bonus is that Robert Altman directed it, so that means the depth of the cast goes beyond the primary characters and even beyond the supporting cast, as in any of Altman's movies even the guy chopping wood in the background probably has something more interesting to say than anyone in today's average Hollywood investment.  Everything is in its right place in McCabe & Mrs. Miller and watching it is as if the story was happening all along, and then one day Altman and his crew showed up to film John McCabe ride into town with his cards and fancy clothes and then another day they were gone, leaving the cold northwestern town of Presbyterian Church to trudge along toward a more civilized future all by itself.  Altman is one of the finest American filmmakers of all time and it is no wonder he creates such a masterful western.  It is also no wonder he did so however the hell he wanted.  Good for him and he is obviously missed greatly.

Altman makes it clear that the idea of heroism in the west is in all likelihood overplayed but he doesn't take that message to the point where it may offend much of his audience as he had in other films.  He shows McCabe's charisma to be his greatest asset above all while his stealth and wit are what guide him in the film's outstanding snowbound climax.  His actions would get his hat shot off by Eastwood's Blondie from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Good-the-Bad-and-the-Ugly/dp/B001U6YI92/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</a>, and no matter what character John Wayne's playing he would've referred to McCabe as yellow.  There is also a scene in McCabe & Mrs. Miller when a young gunslinger confronts another young man on a bridge.  The two are far enough away that their captive audience cannot likely hear what they are saying to each other.  The gunslinger doesn't defeat his opponent with his hand speed but instead with his sharp tongue and sheer drive to prove to his watchers that he is a killer not to be trifled with.  To us of course, his actions show very little genuine courage and are even outright vile.  Altman is right to play down the virtue of courage as commonplace in such an uncivilized and violent domain, and it is one of several reasons this film challenges the many mainstay conventions of the western.

This 1971 film takes place in the very early twentieth century in northwest United States, as clever gambling man John McCabe (Warren Beatty) rides in to make a dollar on a gullible mining town's mostly male population.  Beatty is just a few years removed from his performance as Clyde Barrow in Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde and you can see some of Clyde's aggressive nature surface between McCabe's drunken lamentations about having poetry in him.  He puts together a brothel but is soon upstaged and assisted greatly by Constance Miller (a dynamic Julie Christie), an English opium addicted alpha-female that becomes McCabe's associate and business partner.  Mrs. Miller knows her way around the whoring business.  A mining company soon arrives to purchase the town and McCabe denies their offers and sets off a violent chain of events.

Christie's Mrs. Miller is not only the best performance by a female in any western I've ever seen but it is quite possibly the most powerful fictional female character conceived in the genre.  This also might be Warren Beatty's best performance.  The persistent use of just three simple Leonard Cohen songs in the soundtrack is beautiful in every scene we hear them.  And finally, enough cannot be said for Altman's naturalistic storytelling and ability to manage a scene.  He did this right after M.A.S.H. and it really is Altman in his prime and most generative phase.  This is in so many ways an unconventional western but it still somehow manages to deliver an astounding climatic showdown in the film's final minutes.  McCabe and Mrs. Miller is as gorgeous as it is devastating.",1334188800,3,5246,5.698331193838254

Some have entirely disappeared.  But there are some that survive in ruins and personify the story that is McCabe & Mrs. Miller.  I have stood in dismal towns that were never more than a few buildings surrounded by mine tailings, pits and tunnels and felt the disappointment and frustration that lives on in places where miners worked day and night to scrape out tiny amounts of gold or silver.  It was not all Unsinkable Molly Brown and Horace Tabor making fortunes and moving to Denver.  The vast majority of miners came West with hopes that were never attained.  Many ended up working for a mine owner, earning a pittance, and living in a company town, with little entertainment, little intellectual stimulation, and a lot of dirt and mud.  Miners were often drifters, moving from one tiny town to the next, always hopeful that the next town would hold a fortune.

When big mining interests come to McCabe to buy out his holdings, he drunkenly passes them over hoping they'll be back with a better offer. They come back, but the offer is much worse. Look for William Devane as a full of it lawyer spouting pre-progressive era nonsense about ""fighting it in the courts"" and ""protecting the little guy"" while McCabe literally has guns pointed at his head. Not much has changed in a century according to Altman. Gorgeous ""flash"" photography-Altman briefly exposed the negative to light before developing it-bring to mind an ancient postcard. McCabe, I think, set the standard for the revisionist Western, which has yet to be repeated, even by Leone and Peckinpah. About twenty or so actors round out the more than natural cast including Altman regulars Rene Auberjonois and John Schuck.

And if you are not aware of it, Marlon Brando in his heyday  the 50's) was accused of always mumbling his lines.

Secondly, the movie is so boring that there were only five or ten minutes of action in the entire movie. It was the scene where Robert Carridine confronts a bad guy.

112824,5,0790741067,"In 1971, the year following the great success of his movie ""M*A*S*H"", Robert Altman chose to adapt Edmund Naughton's novel ""McCabe"" about an amiable drifter who discovers his soul in the harsh, unpromising outback of the Pacific Northwest at the turn of the 20th century.
  Altman assembled his stars, Warren Beatty and Julie Christie, a group of durable character actors including William Devane, John Schuck, Rene Auberjonois, and Michael Murphy and ingenues Keith Carradine (his first role) and Shelley Duvall (her second). He instructed his cast to select their own wardrobes from thrift shops and personal belongings, prepare themselves to live in rudimentary dwellings near the set for the duration of the shoot, and not to expect excellent weather.
  The result was ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller"", a dreamy, sensuous and affecting film about ambition, pride, romance, character, and community. A sense of fragility and bust held at bay pervades the story, emphasized by the gently rueful songs of Leonard Cohen and the presence of rain, mud or snow in nearly every scene. Digging in against the elements, determined miners scrape their living from ore reluctantly disgorged by the hills, finding their comfort in rugged humor, bottled spirits and muted camaraderie as the town of Presbyterian Church takes shape around them.
  The arrival of the mysterious stranger McCabe (Beatty) brings mutual benefit. He is rumored to have shot dead a notorious bad man, but he seems to have no more aim than to be one of the boys, taking his chances along with everybody else at rude poker and raw whiskey. McCabe is accustomed to solitude; he communes with himself in muttered monologues. Among the residents of the hardscrabble town, he finds he is the one-eyed man in the kingdom of the blind. Acceptance by his newfound friends stirs ambitions he was not aware he had. He sees the profits to be banked by bringing the town a product it most eagerly needs: prostitutes.
  Fancying himself an astute cosmopolitan, McCabe is blindsided by the beautiful, calculating and thoroughly worldly Mrs. Miller (Christie), the madam who follows the imported ladies of pleasure. McCabe falls for her like Cascade mountain rain. Though their business partnership redounds to their personal advantage and enhances the town's prosperity, no effort of charm, sincerity or plea can crack Mrs. Miller's granite heart. Turned away at her door, McCabe audits their partnership. ""Money and pain. Pain, pain pain."" Mrs. Miller's impenetrable reserve prompts McCabe's disconsolate soliloquy. ""You're just freezin' my soul. That's what you're doin'.  Freezin' my soul.""
  The booming town inevitably attracts the interest of a large mining corporation that dispatches representatives to buy out McCabe and Miller's holdings to cement their local monopoly. Confronted by an obstinate McCabe, the company resorts to more intimidating tactics, sending the implacable Butler (Hugh Millais) with a pair of surly gunmen. Will McCabe and Miller sell out? Will they ever pledge their troth? Are they the only thing standing between Presbyterian Church and the relentlessly controlling forces of commerce?
  In his long, fruitful career, Robert Altman (1925 - 2006) wrote, directed or produced 34 films for the big screen and dozens of movies, series episodes, documentaries, and short features for television. He favored experimental approaches in style and story. In this film he spotlights main characters with appreciable flaws, portrays prostitutes in warm, familial glow and fills backgrounds with chatty ensembles conducting business without reference to the principal action.
  ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller"" may have been submerged by the acclaim accorded many of Altman's other movies, but it is a work perfectly realized in its chemistry, atmosphere and effect. Life is rarely an all out war against the armies of darkness. For most it is the humble struggle to put down roots, to nurture one's designs, to be something for someone, to defy transience and impermanence.",1312070400,5,4028,5.311320754716981

But, as in the days of the mining companies and factory company stores of the time, a mining concern makes gambler McCabe an offer that he shouldn't have refused - to sell his interests in the bordello and saloon.

For fiction, the story represents an authentic view of the culture of the time and location - a gripping drama to the end.

Although Robert Altman tells the story in an original way, the story itself is not special in terms of content. The story develops only with long dialogues until the final shootout scenes, which makes the movie a little bit boring. Altman brings a naturalistic approach to the western movies but this originality does not raise the watchablity of the film.
On the other hand, Warren Beatty and Julie Christie play successfully. In addition, Leonard Cohen's music sounds quite restful.

112842,2,0790741067,"Before Altman fans eviscerate my review, let me start by saying I'm one of you.  I think Altman was a true genius and one of our most consistently brilliant filmmakers.  I admire and enjoy his films going as far back as ""Countdown"" and continuing through ""Gosford Park.""  I especially enjoy his films from the seventies, and consider ""Brewster McCloud"" and ""California Split"" among my all-time favorite films.  Heck, I even admire the ""Bonanza"" episodes he directed.

But ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller""? I don't get it.

Believe me, I'd long looked forward to seeing this previously unavailable film, so numerous are the accolades that've been heaped on it.  But when I finally got my hands on the film, what I found was a long, dreary-looking picture about a handful of boring characters. Maybe the film's rich subtleties failed to penetrate my thick noggin. Maybe it just hasn't aged well.  Whatever the case, I didn't find this film entertaining, insightful, or even moderately interesting.  Were it not the product of Robert Altman, I doubt I would have made it through to the end.

I've heard and read the comments about Altman single-handedly redefining the Western, but that'd already been done by Sergio Leone and Sam Peckinpah, among others.  Only the difference is, when those other filmmakers removed the gloss Hollywood had applied to the genre for forty-plus years, they came up with compelling stories and characters.

I don't know any way to put this except to say the filmmaker of this particular movie seemed inept, not just in his storytelling skills, but from a technical standpoint as well. The picture is grainy, the color washed out. Okay, so he was trying to de-beautify the western, but did he have to make every scene so difficult to make out?  Worse is the muddy sound. Apparently this too was one of Altman's choices, but given his fondness for overlapping dialogue--a good effect when done well--the decision to remove the clarity from the sound is a near disaster.  Much of the dialogue is indecipherable.

I've also heard it said that ""McCabe"" is a satire of capitalism, and if not a satire, then at least an indictment of it.  Well, if that's the case, then capitalism has nothing to worry about, because the story of a lone businessman crushed under the heel of a corporation is hardly revolutionary.  It wasn't when the movie came out and it sure isn't in 2010. Instead the message in this film comes off as trite, nothing more.

The film is not without its virtues. There are some good scenes with Keith Carradine, and the ending is suspenseful and well done, if fairly predictable.  But that's about it.

And yet, Altman fans really, really like this film.  Even Richard Schickel, who recently blasted Altman in his review of a new Altman biography, cites this as Altman's best work.

In my opinion, not even close.",1264464000,5,2844,4.84472049689441
112843,2,0790741067,"Robert Altman is an acquired taste for me.  It never fails that I either love or hate his work.  I am a firm believer in the idea that `Short Cuts' is one of the greatest films of all time, and I truly adored `The Player' and to a lesser degree `Gosford Park'.  I thought I liked `A Prairie Home Companion' until it got about halfway through and the script fell to pieces and I now practically loathe it (aside from Streep who was all kinds of superb there).  He has a very unique brand of filming (I guess I should say `had'...RIP) and that style works sometimes and then fails others.

`McCabe and Mrs. Miller', in my opinion, is one of those failings.

I know that my opinion is not the popular one, but honestly, this may be my least favorite of his work that I've seen so far.  I struggle with this and `A Prairie Home Companion'.  At least `A Prairie Home Companion' was genuinely entertaining is most parts, even if the script was utterly ridiculous come it's closing, but whatever.  Here I found myself detached and uninterested most of the time.  I liked the gritty texture to this film, but found that the grit became nothing more than surface when there is no genuine feeling attached to it.

The film tells the story of John McCabe and Constance Miller, two very different individuals with the same dreams; wealth.  Together they build a town from the ground up, and their success becomes something much bigger than either of them can truly handle.  Grounding their town in prostitution, they become quite popular, but when McCabe allows his own arrogance and stubbornness to move him to turn down a business venture he realizes that wealth does not make you infallible.

Technically, I don't like the way the film was constructed.  I don't think that Altman's style fits this type of film very well.  Altman is known for making is mere observers; taking us in and out of conversations and allowing us to come to know everyone through subtle touches.  That just doesn't work right here.  It almost gives the film a feeling incoherency that can cause one to become frustrated or even bored, wondering just why they should be watching this film.  I abhorred the use of song throughout the film as well.  I didn't feel it necessary and I felt rather haphazard.  It just didn't flow and made the film appear rather choppy.  The grittiness of the film, while welcomed by me (I love grit), was not always advantageous.  It made certain scenes hard to grasp or focus on, and while that texture complimented the subject well it didn't serve Altman's style right.

Still, as much as this film left me unimpressed, there are some facets of the film that do work.  For one, the acting on the part of both leads is really impressive.  I am not one who thinks Warren Beatty is an exceptional actor, but he really nailed McCabe, layering him with genuine emotions and a real sense of character.  Even better though was Julie Christie who balanced Miller's frailty with a hardness that was phenomenally understated.  Robert Altman also handled the films finale scenes with a brutal restraint that was very engaging.  It is one of the moments where the films grit paid off and made for a phenomenally crafted and ultimately thrilling scene.

I can't really recommend this film, but nearly everyone else here does so hey, see it and judge for yourself.  I don't think that it fits that wonderfully together, but that may just be me.  Maybe I should watch it again.  Like I said, Altman is an acquired taste, so maybe you like his style more than I do.  When he nails it he really nails it (`Short Cuts') but when he misses the mark it comes across almost sloppy with no real sense of direction.  That's how I feel about this one.",1233878400,9,3724,4.582450832072618
112844,3,0790741067,"A five star film for story, cinematography and music.  However, the image quality of the transfer is very problematic. There is a ""grain"" on many of the shots which is not film grain.  Real film grain constantly changes instant by instant as the individual silver halide particles in each frams differs.  By contrast, on this transfer, the ""grain"" is unchanging, static and persists between shots.  It is almost as if the film was processed through a screen when striking the final master (which may be true, but I have never read about this post-production technique being used).  Also, in the opening sequence, when the titles are running, there is a noticable dust mote (really, a hair-like curling line) on the left side of the frame, which finally is cleared out of the gate after about 10 seconds or so). There is also noticable softness of the entire image on some shots, to be followed by other shots where the image is clear, which I find detracting.

Finally, the sound quality on the analogue tracks is very poor. I don't have a Dolby digital decoder, so I cannot comment on the digital tracks.

However, even with these caveats, I am so very happy to have this film (finally) in my collection.  Watching it a day after Kurosawa's Seven Samurai (Criterion Collection DVD) is also very enlightening.  Whether or not Altman was influenced by Kurosawa, there are elements of the story, the production values (e.g, rain in Seven Samurai, snow in McCabe to highten tension in the final showdown), and camera work which are common to both films.",1231891200,11,1550,4.796992481203008
112845,5,0790741067,"It's Altman at his best, with a cast that clearly believed in him and relished the opportunity to be directed by him. This movie is as close to cinematic poetry as you're ever gonna get. Altman demonstrates his gift and mastery at mood, texture and tone, while skillfully adding rich layers of nuance and wit to this somewhat simple tale of a complex man -- or is McCabe a simple man in a complex tale? Beatty and Christie are nothing less than inspirational, and Carradine makes me cry (his earnest commitment the character and the haunting believability that results should be studied by every wannabe actor seeking the true goods). Such confident, restrained, detailed and thus moving filmmaking from an American master -- Altman never made a more beautiful film. Oh, to have been at least a background player in this experience (for Altman even approached their roles with a thoroughness that adds to the piece's overall realism and sense of actual community); a dream job for any performer. And Cohen's music works wonders with the film's atmosphere; I can't think of anyone else who coulda pulled it off more compatibly -- Neil Young maybe? Willie Nelson? Overall, I can't say enough about this one. I watch it each year, and it never fails to enhance my love for it in new ways every time.",1227052800,3,1296,4.764444444444444

I wondered how I'd react to it now, so many years later.  I was happy that, although it didn't have the huge emotional impact that it did on my first viewing, I still enjoyed every moment and was again genuinely moved by it.

The story is relatively simple.  The enjoyment, I think, for me, is largely visual.  The cinematography is gorgeous; there's something magical about shooting in the snow. (Remember that other spectacular Julie Christie film, Dr. Zhivago.) The two stars, of course, are in their prime and both beautiful to watch. They both inhabit their roles perfectly. The secondary characters are well defined and well played;
Altmann keeps them from falling into stock types.

The music, from Leonard Cohen's smash first album, which came out prior to the film, perfectly enhances the magical, bittersweet, terribly sad but beautiful mood of the film.  The combination of Cohen's voice and the snow falling on the rough wooden buildings makes a kind of poetry not often seen in film.

The movie is a portrait - the cinematography is beautiful, it left me with the same feelings I get while looking at great photographs. I was stunned by the dark mood the movie creates and by some of my feelings, especially my shock at the central murder scene on the bridge.

I thought Keith Carradine's role as the cowboy is the best acting in this film, and if you watch him play Bill Hickok in Deadwood, you'll hardly believe you're seeing the same actor, so great are his talents.

This movie has remained on my all-time favourites list since 1971. But you will not find ""excitement"" or ""action"" here. It's simply an exceptional portrait of a special time and place.",1217808000,3,768,4.557971014492754

112849,3,0790741067,"McCabe and Mrs. Miller (Robert Altman, 1971)

I've never much gotten along with Robert Altman's movies, though I've found that with Altman, as with Kubrick, the farther back I go in the catalog, the better the movie tends to be. There are, of course, exceptions to the rule (Altman was thinking what, exactly, when he agreed to helm the adaptation of Popeye?), but in general, it holds. And while I don't seem to have found McCabe and Mrs. Miller the be-all and end-all of film as some people have, it was certainly an enjoyable romp, if discomfiting at times.

McCabe (Warren Beatty, in by far the best performance I've seen from him) is an entrepreneur with a shady past who arrives in a logging town one winter looking to set up a brothel. He is soon joined by Constance Miller (Julie Christie), a madam with a lot more business sense than McCabe has. The two of them, working together, quickly grow their business into the premier economic attraction in tiny Presbyterian Church, Washington. Unfortunately, as attractions will do, it attracts. And some of the folks it attracts are the wrong kinds of folks, who would like to have that business for themselves. McCabe's flighty idealism and Miller's hard-headed pragmatism clash, even in the face of a common enemy.

This is not your momma's western; if John Wayne hated High Noon, I'd have loved to have been a fly on the wall the first time he saw this! No hookers with a heart of gold here, no square-jawed heroes, none of the usual western clichs anywhere in sight. That by itself makes this an interesting movie, but Altman ups the ante with his directing ability, which was-- at least in the early seventies-- prodigious indeed (viz. M*A*S*H). This is a western that just kind of muddles through, for the most part, with a climax that's alternately amusing and horrifying (not necessarily because of the actions taking place, but because of the lack of every emotion we expect to see from both the good guys and the bad guys), some solid characters, and a few chuckles here and there.

Actually, to call it a Western is a bit misleading, as it may be technically a Western, it is much more than that.  The Leonard Cohen soundtrack fits in so well with the film.  Amazingly, the songs by Cohen were NOT written specifically for the film.  Altman was a major Cohen fan, and got permission from Leonard to use his songs for his film.  Thank you, Mr. Leonard Cohen.  I can't really imagine this film without them.  Most of the songs here appear on Leonard's album Songs of Leonard Cohen album.  The Stranger Song, the song that plays over the opening credits, sets the mood so perfectly for the entire film.  The look of the film is one of the more unique in cinematic history.  It was achieved through various filters at the time.  Vilmos Zigmond, the cinematographer, didn't get the look in the lab, but in the camera, which made it look as good as it does.  Dreyer's Vampyr has a similar other worldly look like this film, except that film had a light leak in the camera.  In other words, that was a happy accident.  This film was a deliberate attempt at a new cinematic look, and it succeeds in spades.  This is great filmmaking.  The performances are astounding as well.  Beatty and Christie are wonderful, and Keith Carradine is superb in a small, but tragic role.

112854,5,0790741067,"""McCabe & Mrs. Miller"" has long been considered one of the best films ever made and is considered Robert Altman's masterpiece (even though his only film to make The American Film Institute's Top 100 is M*A*S*H). The movie is one of the saddest movies you'll likely see. Although, keep in mind, I thought films like The Virgin Suicides and All the Real Girls were sad...So maybe I'm not the best judge of sadness. Anyway, Warren Beatty plays McCabe, a gambler, who arrives in the town of Presbyterian Church; A town that seems to always have a gray cloud hanging over it. This town embodies sadness. It's always dark, always gray, always raining or snowing. McCabe, in the beginning of the film, walks into a saloon, makes sure he knows where the back door is, walks back outside, comes in with a sheet, and covers a table. You hear people talking in the background about how they've heard about McCabe and how they heard that he shot a man...This seems like pointless candor, but it actually prepares us for an important scene much later in the movie. With his winnings from the gambling, McCabe buys three women so he can open up a brothel. His three women are pretty ugly, his brothel poor looking (although he plans to open a brothel and saloon). That's when he meets Mrs. Miller (Julie Christie), although why she's ""Mrs."" Miller is never quite clear. Mrs. Miller, a Cockney woman, quickly decides she wants to be McCabe's partner and the two see that it will work out best for both of them. McCabe is one of those characters that doesn't talk a lot and when he does, he's either talking to himself or muttering in low-tones. One of the most famous lines in the movie is something he says to himself ""I got poetry in me."" Whenever he talks to himself, it seems like he's saying things he wants to say to Mrs. Miller. The movie sets up the end of the film long before the ending rolls around. Some men arrives from a mining company and offer McCabe some money for his holdings. He names a price, they reject him, and later realizes he's made a mistake. He knows that the men will send someone to kill him. There's one (you probably can't even call it a) sub-plot involving a kid played by Keith Carradine, who rides into town and ""visits"" all the girls in the brothel. Before he's to leave, he begins walking across a suspension bridge to buy some socks but finds himself face-to-face with a young gunslinger. This scene is tense and you know the outcome right away, but it's still a very sad moment. This is a scene in the film I find simalar to the Mike Yanagita scene in Fargo. It seems pointless, but it kind of takes the film and puts it into focus. This a brilliant film, an example of what movies should be. It's not the most entertaining film, but it's beautifully photographed, has a haunting score (which isn't actually a score as much as a bunch of songs by Leonard Cohen), and a wonderfully depressing story. Highlighted by outstanding performances by Beatty and Christie, this is a masterpiece.

112857,4,0790741067,"Robert Altman's ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller"" is a gloomy, subdued tale of the Old West filmed with magnificent cinematography in the Pacific Northwest.

Warren Beatty playing dimwitted gambler John McCabe ambles into a remote burgeoning frontier town nestled in the snowy confines of Washington state at the turn of the century.  He has an idea to build a gambling hall and saloon also housing a bordello.  Soon the stunning Julie Christie, a shrewd opium smoking madam from Seattle arrives in town.  With her sharp business acumen she forges a partnership with Beatty and their business begins to boom.

The town receives a surprise visit from the representatives of a mining company who make Beatty a lucrative offer to sell his property for the mining rights.  When he refuses a trio of gunslingers arrive in town to kill him and seize his possessions.

The drama plays out in a blinding snowstorm as Beatty is pursued by the pack of gunmen.  At the same time the town church has caught fire occupying the townfolk who are unaware of the conflict being played out.

Altman's somber classic is a more realistic portrayal of frontier life than what Hollywood has traditionally churned out previously.  Both Christie who was Oscar nominated and Beatty did fine jobs of acting in their roles.",1143590400,2,1287,4.916666666666667

Robert Altman, a political and cultural man of the 1960's Left simply says ""horse feathers.""  The hero is a corrupt bawdyhouse owner.  The school marm makes her living in a crude manner and normal everyday middle-class types don't really exist in the hardscrabble world of capitalism.

Despite many moments of humor, there is still no doubt for a minute that this West is headed for a tragic ending.  And when it comes, in a fortuitous snowstorm, it is a brilliantly choreographed one-on-three quarter-hour showdown.

112870,5,0790741067,"Robert Altman either does it very well or not well at all. MASH vs Nashville (too grandiose, too much material with little substance). As a fan of westerns who maintains a collection just of that genre, from ""The Oxbow Incident"" to ""Unforgiven"", I have always considered this one of my favorite movies. In fact even from a nonwestern viewpoint, it is one of my favorites.

I have never been a Warren Beatty or Julie Christie fan but they make this movie. It might be one of those situations where usually mediocre actors combine to make something of outstanding chemistry. A gestalt type of thing. George Kennedy won an Oscar for ""Cool Hand Luke"" but never again did anything to equal what he did in that role. Harper Lee never wrote another novel, much less anything as great as ""To Kill a Mockingbird"". In music they are referred to as ""one hit wonders"". but this is not about the filmographies of Beatty or Christie. They are at their best because although they are the leading characters and carry the film, they never overdominate the movie. As the main characters we need to and want to know about them but in typical Altman fashion, there are supporting characters who hold our interest between the Beatty/Christie scenes.

I thought the softness and subtle brownish-gold overtones of the cinematography combined with the soundtrack was as important to this movie as much as the character portrayals were. It has, as another reviewer described, a daguerreotype sense to it. This tone is not prevalent throughout every scene of the movie but it definitely sets the mood. The starkness of other scenes such as in the larger town where negotiations are to be held is also a sustaining mood setter. The soundtrack is excellent. Leonard Cohen is an exceptional poet/songwriter. I once read that the songs in the movie were not written for the movie but fit right in. Perhaps Altman had them in mind as he wrote the screenplay. The songs are haunting and befit the mood of the cinematography as well as the theme of the film.

""McCabe and Mrs. Miller"" didn't kill the genre, it enhanced. It took twenty-one years for someone else, Clint Eastwood, to continue that enhancement in ""Unforgiven"". In my collection of westerns there are several John Wayne films but most,if not all of them, lack the flavor and spirit of realism of the true west that movies such as this movie and ""Unforgiven"" convey.",1125878400,2,2397,4.785024154589372

Robert Altman has been one of the most intelligent and enigmatic directors in any age. He works out with the camera was a true scalpel and disects the human nature from all the angles: difuse, violent, oscure and metaphoric.

Through the years, Altman has not got back every single inch in this approach. He likes to work in the insanity's frontiers, surrounded by the  febrile anguish and desperation: in this sense, he is very closed to Werner Herzog, despite Altman is more urban than him.

Warren Beaty grow up as any other actor working with Julie Christie, one of the most remarkable female icons of the stardom in those ages.

A gunfight between a pro and country bumpkin (Keith Carradine) was probably like most actual gunfights - legal murder(one guy didn't have a chance).

Three things in this movie stopped me in my tracks. The music, by Leonard Cohen, the cinematography by Vilmos Szigmond, and the precise control of Robert Altman.

Now, 34 years later, this film still arrests me. The fact that the filmed town 'grew' as the movie developed, that the cast members lived the life in the environment that they portrayed, the willful but gentle portrayl of human weakness, warmth, and prejudice, causes me to consistantly appreciate the salvation that people seek, in whatever form, to make them whole somehow. I'm sure a lot of little criticisms can be made for the film effects, the sparse storyline, the staid pacing, but this is an 'old' film.

Looking at it now and again, I still can feel the rain turning to sleet, I can smell the lousy interiors of the buildings, I can feel the damned mud under my boots, I can feel the isolation of McCabe as he faces his murderers in the end.

112874,4,0790741067,"The Old West as depicted in most movies consisted of heroes and villains, cowboys fighting indians and outlaws to protect a tiny rural town. Well, needless to say, the Western genre does not generally provide an accurate portrayal of the Old West. McCabe & Mrs. Miller turns the Western genre on its ear with its gritty, realistic portrait of a Western town where there are no heroes or villains, only people struggling to survive and live their lives uninterrupted.

McCabe (Warren Beatty) comes to a one-horse town called Presbyterian Church in the Pacific Northwest, where he stresses to the local gentleman that he is a businessman, though they have heard whispers that he killed a man. McCabe's intention is to build a saloon-slash-whorehouse that will make him some money and provide the men in town with some jollies. While the construction is underway, Mrs. Miller (Julie Christie) makes her way into town and strikes up a partnership of sorts with McCabe. She figures he's not too bright and she can help him run a successful business. McCabe develops a liking for Mrs. Miller and her, urrmm, assets, but she does not return his affections; she gets her kicks from opium, not sex.

Before long, business is booming, and a large corporation sends a few representatives to buy out McCabe's properties in town. McCabe balks at the offer, hoping to hold out for more money, but instead the men just walk away entirely, leaving McCabe confused, until he finds out that bounty hunters have been sent to eliminate him. He fashions himself as a spokesman for the small businessman standing up to the large corporations, but his time is becoming precious.

The late '60s to early '70s was a time when some brilliant filmmakers were allowed to be daring and make the kinds of films they wanted to make. Directors like Mike Nichols and Martin Scorsese flourished, as did Robert Altman, the director of McCabe & Mrs. Miller. The visual style has hints of Bonnie and Clyde and The Graduate, but also adds a sepia tone quality to give it the look of old photographs, which is perfect.

McCabe & Mrs. Miller moves at a languid pace, and is less concerned with telling a compelling narrative than it is with exploring its characters. Warren Beatty brings McCabe to life with an aw-shucks approach, creating a character who so desperately wants to be a successful businessman that when he's doing something foolish he doesn't even notice. His heart, while in the right place, does too much of the decision-making.

Also, the film is very sly in its commentary on business practices, which resonates to this day. It shows the small business struggling to retain its identity outside the scope of the corporation trying to destroy it for its own benefit. Overall, McCabe & Mrs. Miller is a worthy film that stands the test of time.",1115164800,8,2821,4.832298136645963

This movie put a different perspective on what the west, in fact the era, was really like. R. Altman created the backdrop for that stark reality using a combination of music and imagery of dismal winters weather and mud lined streets. The characters were not heros but just people doing the best they could to survive in a harsh world.

In the case of Julie Christie's character survival included disappearing from reality through the use of opium. Other characters portrayed are Shelly Duvall as the mail order bride turned prostitute when her husband is killed and Kieth Carradine as a cowboy who happens to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.

The final shootout is not a ""meet in the street and shoot it out"" gunbattle but rather a game of hide and seek with survival at stake. Even the final ending has a starkness surrounding it with the bodies probably frozen and hidden by snow until springs thaw and Julie submerging herself in the opium pits to forget the man you think she may actually have feelings for.

This movie is a true reality check on what the west was probably really like and the first of its time to portray a realistic version of it.",1104278400,3,1401,4.503937007874016

Every moment of ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller"" works for me. The bridge encounter involving Keith Carradine is my nomination for the single most stunning sequence in the history of the movies. The music - my God - here I go again with another superlative - I really can't think of a film that better unites image and music unless maybe it's 10 or 15 minutes of ""Yellow Submarine."" Maybe the opening of ""2001,"" OK, that too. Robert Altman once said in an interview in the San Jose Mercury News that he was listening to Leonard Cohen's music in Paris while he was working on the script. While he was working on the script! The music informed the writing! It's an organic part of the whole deal! And on the DVD it's gorgeously clear and vivid. Thank you, Robert Altman. And Leonard Cohen. And Brian McKay and Edmund Naughton. And Warren Beatty and Julie Christie too, and the Mighty Altman Art Players, wherever you have scattered. Your work here will live forever.",1102032000,10,1524,4.419928825622776

112881,2,0790741067,"Sometimes I find out more about the movie when I watch the Audio Commentary.  In this case, the DVD is most positive about this being the movie after M*A*S*H, in which some of the same actors appeared.  The key to making this kind of movie was that a script was written with one line for each of the characters in the movie, to allow the studio to budget actors for the parts.  Then each of the actors was encouraged to make as much of their part as possible whenever there was a card game, a meal, a fight, or negotiations.  There are two stars in this movie, Warren Beatty and Julie Christie, and WB telling one of his jokes, about a small frog swallowed whole by an eagle, might be the high point of the movie for anyone who needs a joke to tell in the middle of financial negotiations when someone is worried about some little guy flapping in the breeze.

Some of the people who like to see movies are only fourteen years old, and the commentary makes clear that no one ever expected them to like this movie.  Certain scenes that earned the R rating for this movie were designed to keep little kids out, so there would not be anyone in the audience who would fidget every time someone takes a cigar out, when you soon figure out that no one is going to say anything for a long time.  In the middle of the movie, a request for an immediate answer is actually responded to with ""My immediate answer is `No,'"" as if any big changes would have to be thoroughly pondered, possibly over a glass with a raw egg and whiskey in it.

The Leonard Cohen songs in the soundtrack seem unusually stark to me.  A rough voice and single guitar fit `The Stranger Song' and `Winter Lady,' but I am used to lush treatments of `Sisters of Mercy.'  The song that might have been written after seeing this movie is `Smoke, Smoke, Smoke (That Cigarette)' by Merle Travis and Tex Williams, one of the most dramatic songs ever written about playing cards and smoking at the same table, which is now available of the `Too Much Fun' CD of Commander Cody & His Lost Planet Airmen.  There is also an opium pipe in this movie, for a character who doesn't play cards as much.  Filmed in Vancouver, a neighbor complained when one of the film's mules ruined a nice suburban lawn by eating it.  Filmed in 1970 and 1971, many in the cast were carpenters building the set who didn't want to get drafted in the United States and were willing to do whatever they had to do to build a place they could live in after the movie was over.

I like the movie `Popeye' better than I like this movie.  Shelley Duvall has an early part but no singing in this movie, but she got to sing `He Needs Me' and a few other songs by Harry Nilsson in `Popeye.'  Has anyone who saw that movie ever forgotten Olive Oil singing, `He's large' ? ? ?  The plot of this movie has characters bad enough to sing `I'm Mean,' but they don't.  Steam engine fans and wood-nailing carpenters might like this movie better than I did.  The town had water pipes (which you don't see) to allow rain whenever they wanted to film wet weather, and there was snow on the ground when Canada was below freezing.

112883,5,0790741067,"This is, I think, my favorite film of all time.  It has everything: romance, comedy, suspense, gangsters, and the most archetypal of all American movie symbols, the Western shoot-out.  And it's real.  You are not watching actors reciting lines in a script; you are watching the first thousand people or so forging an American community.  You are watching the town you grew up in when it was a seed.
It puzzles as much as reveals: just what is Constance Miller feeling for McCabe?  McCabe for sure loves her a lot, enough to humble himself and pay money for sex.  Would she ever do the same for him?  Why is saving the church cause for jubilation among the townsfolk when apparently none of them felt connected at all to it?  And my favorite puzzle of all: how on earth did Pudgy McCabe get the reputation of a fearsome gunslinger?
The first puzzle doesn't interest me very much.  It's one of those character things that's often good to leave in limbo.  But the second and third puzzles speak to the heart of the United States, for I think they have definitive answers in terms of what Altman was saying with this film.
As for the saving of the church: the rampant lack of real spiritual feeling among Americans is laid bare, for while the church is being saved, McCabe is being stalked.  Americans don't put into practice those churchly ideas that they all claim to stand for, while at the same time they give their all to protect the symbol of the idea they are neglecting.  You get to know these townsfolk intimately during the film, and you really like them.  It's not as if they were evil, but Christian ideals are just words to them, as they are to many Christians today.  How else to explain the rabid Christian right's war-mongering image over the years?
The third puzzle explodes the American myth of the Western hero.  Pudgy McCabe, the feared gunslinger, turns out to be a bumbling character who shot a man with a derringer.  Hardly Billy the Kid (who was hardly Billy the Kid either), but some of the stories circulating about Pudgy McCabe are ones of mythic proportions.  The tall bounty hunter is wrong when he says, ""That man never killed anybody.""  Americans will make their heroes out of lies if need be.  The circulated story becomes the truth, and the truth becomes a lie.  I believe Altman was speaking not simply of Western heroes, but American heroes in general.  They are stories only.  How else to explain Jessica Lynch and almost all of the politicians who crawl around in Washington, D.C.?  We approve stories over truth, we approve symbols over substance.  McCabe and Mrs. Miller is a damning indictment of the American heart, showing us up for our lack of spiritual depth.
  Also, the novel McCabe, by Edmund Naughton, is interesting to read if you are a fan of the Altman film.",1083974400,16,2805,4.627530364372469
112884,5,0790741067,"I've got to admit I'm a little surprised to read the negative critiques of McCABE & MRS. MILLER here.  In my opinion this is one of the five greatest movies ever, in any genre, and I'm not an Altman fan.
 Anyway, here's my response to some of the criticism.
 This film has too much realism - I watched the movie with the audio commentary by Robert Altman and producer David Foster (which is good, as far as those things go), and the short documentary on the making of McCABE & MRS. MILLER, which I believe was made shortly after the movie.  The realism, in my opinion, is what gives this movie depth and texture.  The town was being built while the movie was being shot (the film was shot in sequence), and the buildings are not facades.  They are real buildings.  Interior shots were done in them and not in studio.
 It's pointless, boring and pretentious - I think because Altman focuses so much on characters and their motivations the viewer may miss the plot.  The plot here is pretty simple - At the turn of the last century a man builds a gambling/whore house in a small mining town.  An astute madam joins him and in short order the venture is a success.  Such a success, in fact, that an outside concern wants to buy him out.  Two men are sent to the small town to negotiate with him, and he drunkenly refuses their offer.  They leave and the outside concern takes the next step, which is to employ three hired killers to do away with McCabe.
 I suppose letting characters evolve and refraining from throwing plot points at us can seem pretentious.  To me, it simply felt like the director wasn't talking down to me.  Altman says somewhere in the voice over that movies are canvases to him, and he likes working in the corners.  That's not everybody's cup of tea.
 And the ending.... Well, it ain't supposed to end like that, and even those of us who love the movie wish it had ended on a more positive note.  We wish it only because we've become involved with the characters.  But, if it had ended differently, if Mrs. Miller hadn't made that midnight run to Chinatown, we probably wouldn't be talking about it 30+ years on.
 Dismal story, dismal photography - Altman speaks some about the ""look"" of the movie.  The cinematographer, Vilmos Zsigmond, ""flashed"" the negatives to give it a daguerreotype feel.  Flashing a negative is briefly exposing it to light before developing it.  I hadn't noticed until I rewatched it the other day how the look changes after the pivot point - the failed negotiations.  Before that the film looks warm and soft-focused, after that it acquires a harsh, white, sharp-focused look.  The look, from set design to photography, is perfect.
 McCABE & MRS. MILLER killed the genre - That's kind of like saying Pete Rose destroyed baseball.  I'm a huge fan of Westerns, from Gene Autry to John Wayne to Clint Eastwood and all stops in between, and I think this fits comfortably in the genre.  I certainly think McCabe's response to the threat at the end of the film is truer to reality than most.  When you got skilled bad guys tracking you, you hide in the corner and shot them in the back if you get the chance.",1082246400,114,3149,4.512367491166078
112885,5,0790741067,"In the opening shots of Robert Altman's ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller,"" we follow John McCabe (Warren Beatty) making his way on horseback through the hills of the Pacific Northwest. As the camera shifts to the side, it picks up the credits, hanging in the rain-soaked air. ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller""  shot by Vilmos Zsigmond, delights with beautiful plush cinematography.
 John McCabe,a determined businessman with a mysterious past, settles in Presbyterian Church, a small Northwestern town, and opens up a saloon and a brothel. Soon after Constance Miller (Julie Christie) arrives and strikes a deal with McCabe  to manage the brothel. McCabe loves Mrs. Miller and gives in to most of her wishes, she however uses opium and it's unclear how much she feels for McCabe. The money and power mining folks want to buy out McCabe's holdings in town and he bargains too long foolishly imagining the cards he was holding to be alot better than they were. The Mining company sends their killers and McCabe deals with them as the church burns and snow falls.
 In The New York Times Magazine, Aljean Harmetz wrote of Robert Altman's films: ""He wants to catch the accidents of life and fling them on the screen hard enough to knock the breath out of the audience. He wants to weigh the screen down with vulgarity, pleasure, pain, ugliness, and unexpected beauty"". In "" McCabe and Mrs. Miller"" Altman has painted with these very brush strokes a still, quiet masterpiece.",1080604800,3,1447,4.869918699186992
112886,4,0790741067,"I experienced repeated viewings of this movie on a widescreen in Montreal's art theaters of the early 80's, at the height of my love affair with Robert Altman and Leonard Cohen.  At the time, neither of these artists could do wrong, so I wondered how the movie would fare 20 years later.  Would I discover I had been infatuated blindly in my youth?  Or would my ardor be re-kindled?
I found I have less patience for some of Altman's mannerisms: Camera shots that linger on irrelevant close ups as if the camera wandered off and got lost, scenes where cast and director seemed to be jamming and can't get the magic to happen, and abrupt cuts that disrupt the flow of the movie.  It is as if Altman gave up on some scenes and moved on even though they didn't quite work.
However, most of the time, the magic is there.  The opening credits show a hunched rider bundled from the relentless sleet in a huge fur coat ride though a breathtaking wilderness.  It's beautiful and raw, but not romantic.  We see McCabe (Warren Beatty) bumbling through his attempts to build a whorehouse and gambling saloon:  a man with entrepreneur spirit and vision, but hopeless at business.  The townspeople, deftly sketched with Altman's trademark overlapping conversations and ensemble sets, rally behind McCabe without really connecting with him.  Soon, more people come to town, including Mrs. Miller (Julie Christie), the tough Madam who has the business sense that McCabe lacks.  When McCabe bungles the ultimate negotiation of his ""holdings"" with a large mining company, he misses out on the big cash payout and has to face the bounty hunters sent to get him out of the way.  The town deserts him and Mrs. Miller sinks into an opium induced dream world.
We see the town buildings grow from the timber of the great northwest (the carpenters on the sets must have had a ball), and small hovels change into cozy wood paneled homes.  The photography catches the rain, snow, dark clouds and dazzling sunshine and colors of the northwest, as well as the actor's terrific performances, and the fated arc of McCabe's rise and fall.
In the end, Altman doesn't give us neat answers.  Why did the townsman rally to save a church run by a minister who mostly ignored them, while deserting McCabe who brought them prosperity?  Was Mrs. Miller found of McCabe, or was it just a business relationship?  Was McCabe just a bumbling man in the right place at the right time, or did he have some unique entrepreneurship?  I have my answers, just as you will have yours after watching the haunting, beautiful movie.
The DVD transfer appears rather grainy to me (I remember such crisp images from that large theater screen), and the sound is dim (Leonard Cohen's songs are distant and I really had to crank up the volume).",1050192000,7,2784,4.7190082644628095

I know Robert Altman is renowned for genre-deconstruction, but the story of an inept businessman (Warren Beatty) and his whip-smart prostitute cohort (Julie Christie) in the 19th century Pacific Northwest left me cold.  I really couldn't get all that interested in these two, even after Beatty's futile battle with the evil businessmen from back East.  I can understand exposing the myths of the Old West, but Altman does it in a rather depressing, tedious manner.
On a different note, the famously muddled sound really wasn't all that bad, and the cinematography I thought was quite good.  The Leonard Cohen songs are half-decent, but still not good enough to overcome my indifference of his musical catalog.

112900,5,0790741067,"""Red River"" and ""Unforgiven"" top my list of the greatest Westerns ever made.  Right behind those classics is this film.  Director Robert Altman gives us the West as it probably really was if you can peel back the stuff of myth and legend.  Warren Beatty and Julie Christie play the hardly heroic leads who are trying to reinvent themselves in the West out of lack of other choices.  Beatty is a very flawed, somewhat cowardly entrepreneur while Christie is a madam for the local prostitutes, potentially a much better entrepreneur, albeit a bit of a hop head.  They have an affair of sorts that is about the best this twosome can ever hope to have and that's not saying much.

After you experience living in this hard scrabble, barely standing town, you will be so glad you were not a hearty pioneer!  I know I am.  There is nothing glamorous or romantic about this existence in the least and Altman does not flinch from the task of laying before us the unvarnished West.  Beatty and Christie also do not flinch from playing these disreputable founders of the Old West.

112901,5,0790741067,"McCABE AND MRS. MILLER is a demoralizing tale that degrades the sanctity of the America West or is it? Robert Altman attacks one of the pillars of American cinema and the pioneering spirit of America itself with this film. George Roy Hill's BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID and Frank Perry's DOC almost accomplished the same end though from different perspectives. Once again Robert Altman's instincts go awry as he further demonstrates that he is no auteur. McCABE AND MRS. MILLER is really not a film director's vision of a historically based society. Just the opposite is true about this film. It is all style and nothing more. There is no vision here. It is even unlike its foreign cousin, the Spaghetti Western. The Spaghetti Western is truer to the ideals of what made the classic American Western what it was. The Spaghetti Westerns were both style and substance and created a vision of the American West from an almost surrealistic netherworld of turmoil, greed and passions but always in the form of homage. If you want to see a film that de-myths the American West try and see James Frawley's KID BLUE with Dennis Hopper, Warren Oates and Ben Johnson. As far as McCABE AND MRS. MILLER is concerned the script and story are both uninteresting and Vilmos Zsigmond's inventive cinematography, though not befitting of the genre, can not take this snoozer out of the doldrums.

This is my all time favorite western (or should I say anti-western).It is a anti-western because there are no heroic John Wayne types in ten gallon hats. Instead we are shown a weary frontier world populated by immigrants who are trying to eek out an existence. The film is about an itinerant gambler named McCabe (well played by Warren Beatty) who comes to a muddy, primitive, frontier mining town with the ideal of getting into the business of supplying the local miners with whiskey and women. He is soon approached by Mrs. Miller (a hard as nails prostitute played by Julie Christie) to go into a partnership to build a proper bordello. She supplies the women and the management, while he supplies the house. All goes well until McCabe is approached by a large mining corporation to buy out his holdings. When negotiations break down, the corporation sends a murderous posse. This film is arguably Robert Altman's masterpiece. The story is something you might hear by a midnight campfire. There are no real heroes, yet these characters keep you infinitly interested. Beatty and Christie are brilliant in the lead roles, playing two very flawed people, who have nobody to blame but themselves for their downfall. The supporting cast is excellent giving the viewer possibly a dozen other mini stories in the background. The cinematography in this movie is beautiful as it shows this drama being played out in the warm amber glow of gas lamps and fireplaces. The soundtrack to this movie is packed with the wonderful music of singer-songwriter Lenard Cohen. His world weary voice perfectly matches the film's dirty, frontier town and its inhabitants. The DVD to this film supplies extras which includes Robert Altman's commentary, a short documentry and a trailer. The dialogue track to this movie has always been somewhat muddy and indistinct.

112904,5,0790741067,"Most of Altmans films are in panorama. That is they focus on large groups and social interaction and their purpose is social comment rather than intimate character study. There are a few exceptions though: The Long Goodbye73, Thieves Like Us74, & McCabe and Mrs. Miller71. The world in the background behind Beatty's McCabe  and Christie's Mrs. Miller feels very much like the former kind of Altman film but in the foreground are those two characters intimately drawn The most intimate portraits Altman has ever drawn. Beatty wisely wears a beard to hide those good looks and accentuate his formidable acting ability and Christie never strikes any glamourous poses and so though you have the two most glamourous actors in 70 's Hollywood this movie is just the opposite of glamourous. It is a gritty and violent world they inhabit and each glimpse of either of those two lead actors is just a further subversion of our ideals of the archetypical hero and heroine. The frontier townsfolk(Altmans grass roots troops) are all the Altman regulars and they are also fascinating to watch, however they are not dreamers like McCabe and Mrs. Miller and have no grand ambitions and so they are safe from the violence which checks anyone who doesn't abide by the laws set by the truly powerful frontier shapers.  In the as yet unshaped wild west a few powerful men are making fortunes by buying up railroad towns and they allow no one to interefere. When necessary they exert their power with hired guns. And this movie has some menacing killers in it. The western myth of an open frontier is just that a myth. Many other lesser myths perpetuated by countless western movies are also given a fresh and sobering look. The stars are Beatty and Christie though. Both are enterprising and both have considerable abilities to make things happen in the wide expanses of the west but their inner lives are expanses that neither are equipped to deal with. You have to be rough to make it in the west and what suffers is all those more civilized characteristics which must be put on hold while the fortune is made. Beatty's courtship of Christie is fascinating to watch. She has an English accent and is innately more civilized than he, so much so that she seems out of place in the very uncivil west, she finds solace in opium. Beatty struggeles to break through to her but he's hopelessly unrefined. Experincing one rejection after another he slams his hat down mumbling to himself,""I've got poetry in me."" Very funny and very moving. Beatty and Christie in a just world both would have received best actor awards for this movie, and the movie itself is the most deserving of praise of all of Altmans pictures. In some ways it is an atypical Altman picture in that it concentrates so much on two lives instead of twenty which is more typical of Altman, the other characters merely fill in the western void each in their own way(Carradine another memorable appearance)but they never take the focus off of those main two.

Here, Altman is at his best. In McCabe, he sure does not aim to appeal to the teenager popcorn crowd: this is the thinking man's western without the cliches of the hollywood's thinking man movies.
In McCabe, the good are more vulnerable, the bad are more persistent, and the ugly are,well, pretty ugly. On a closer look, Mc Cabe is a sublime, heartbreaking story of a man's struggle to survive, rather than a straight good vs. evil tale. I sometimes think Altman intended just to tell that, rather than taking on the whole western myth and change it so daringly.
But then again, there is ""The Long Goodbye"", in which he did the same deconstruction with the the detective-noir, which is also excellent!
McCabe might be, to some viewers and critics, a distant, slow, mellow, disorienting and confusing experience that does not amount to much. But for some, it is sparkling brilliant insight on each and every viewing today.

Warner needs to issue this on video and DVD in widescreen to give it proper justice.",988675200,4,292,4.634615384615385
112919,5,0790741067,"This is generally called an 'anti' Western, in the way Altman's other films are anti-detective films, anti-war films etc.  But that sounds so negative.  Altman does destroy a load of hoary macho myths, but he puts something incredibly beautiful in its place - a vivid, teeming picture of a place, people, time and culture.  His entrepreneur/gunslinger and tart-with-a-heart do exist as negative versions of their usual film types, but they are also endearing, movingly inarticulate ordinary people struggling to fulfil those roles, especially as played by Beatty (very funny and sympathetic) and Christie.  The film's scrupulous realism clashes fruitfully with Altman's distracting camerawork, simultaneously alerting and misleading us to crucial and irrelevant information.  In other words, treating his audience like they have a brain - some people did that 30 years ago.",987552000,9,873,5.583333333333333
112920,5,0790741067,"This is first class film-making all the way.
 The West of Robert Altman (Pacific Northwest more precisely) is not the the usual West of Hollywood.  Peopled by poor working stiffs & idiots at the mercy of hustlers, gamblers, killers and whores, and inevitably, by politicians & big business in the form of the quietly rapacious Railroad, it is wet, nasty, dirty, and harsh.
A small-time gambler McCabe (Beatty) becomes an entrepenuer (saloon & brothel) in the soggy and filthy mining town of Presbyterian with the aid of a sharp and clever English madam (Christie) only to have his newfound prosperity & ""status"" threatened by a ruthless larger enterprise.  This is a true American story.  Not the only American story, but just as valid as any others.
Filmed in real rain and real snow on location, this film just has lots and lots of good stuff.  The plight of the cowboy on the bridge (Keith Carradine) facing a psychotic baby-faced gunslinger, McCabe's desperate battle in the snow, the overlapping dialogue with very funny throw-away lines, the appropriate use of Leonard Cohen's songs, and the beautiful cinematography.  It is a rich film that only improves on multiple viewings.
This movie says more about the underlying dark side of the conquest of the American West than Cimino's Heaven's Gate did in half the time and probably 1/10th of the budget.  Of course, that is the difference between a would-be ""artiste"" and a guy who makes movies that turn out to be art.
The quality of the VHS is only fair.  This film cries out for DVD.  But, if this is the only way to see it....see it.",987120000,4,1590,4.773722627737226
112921,5,0790741067,"If only all movies were this good. Beatty's best role as McCabe, an alcoholic, turn-of-the-century businessman who, with his business partner Mrs. Miller (Christie), is being overtaken not only by ""a syndicate"" but by the changing times. Anyone who thinks they were born 100 years too late could get a realistic look at life in the late 1800's in this movie. It shows the sometimes quiet, sometimes violent desperation and uncertainty of the life in this mining town in the Northwest. Leonard Cohen's songs and the weather puntuate the melacholy. One of my favorite flicks of all time.",970272000,4,585,4.979591836734694
112922,5,0790741067,"The deglamorization of the western has never been made so beautifully. One of the sadest films ever made. Altman has basically no compassion for his characters, that is the reason we care so much about them. Warren Beatty  gives probably his best performance as the gambler McCabe who transforms a  small mining town into a busy boomtown. Julie Christie is also excellent as  the business wise hooker that brings 'high class girls' to the town. What  make this one unique are the beautiful landscapes that are expertly  captured by the masterful cinematography, the haunting and unforgettable  Leonard Cohen songs, and powerhouse direction by Altman who brings us  richly textured characters that provide a breathtaking and unforgettable  cinematic experience. The film also features one of the saddest deaths in  Western history, young cocky Keith Carradine is tricked by a ruthless  gunslinger and meats his death on that fatal bridge. The last scenes in the  snow storm where the antihero McCabe is put into a heroic position is  unbearably poignant and unbelievably beautiful. A fascinating film that has  a lot to offer. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 9!",963187200,7,1168,5.052356020942408
112923,5,0790741067,"Masterful character study manages a rare feat: demystifying the West without resorting to heavy-handedness and obvious targets. While the overall soundness of expansion is questioned, Altman is far more interested  in the dynamics of community and how individualism is often sacrificed in  the name of ""progress."" McCabe, played by Warren Beatty in what might be  his best performance, is a vintage anti-hero; self-absorbed, bumbling,  deluded, and concerned only with his own interests. Mrs. Miller, played  wonderfully by Julie Christie, manages to evade clich&eacute; at every turn, never  resorting to a ""heart-of-gold"" status and always keeping her eye on the  bottom line. Their relationship, central to Altman's vision, gives us a  dirty, unglamorous frontier, full of mindless violence, decay, and  prostitution; again not the Hollywood version, but rather as it most likely  was (and is). McCabe & Mrs. Miller co-exist not as friends or lovers,  but rather as a business alliance, reinforcing Altman's belief that  communities come together not out of a sense of sentiment or loving  connection, but rather to build industry and frankly, make money. Once  again, Altman uses overlapping dialogue, muffled conversations, and music  (the soundtrack consists solely of sad Leonard Cohen songs) to convey  character and the inability of people to engage in meaningful interactions.  As McCabe wanders in a blizzard near the end of the film attempting to  evade death at the hands of hired guns, members of the community he helped  build remain oblivious to his plight as they instead focus on a burning  church. Hopeless, alone, and facing a meaningless death, we are again put  face to face with the stark truth provided by Altman. In the Old West, like  any other historical era or region, there are no last-minute heroics or  gentlemen atop white horses, only the sounds of the pipe dreamers and  individuals gasping their last breaths as the wheels of capital grind on.",960508800,5,1978,5.266025641025641
112924,5,0790741067,"McCabe and Mrs. Miller is yet another brillant work from Robert Altman who along with Scorsese ranks as the two greatest filmmakers America has produced.  Next to ""Nashville"", this is Altman's best film.  One  of Altman's devices is to take an established genre of filmmaking and turn  it completely inside out and reexamine it.  Here, Altman has made a Western  (or is is an Anti-Western)like no other.  This neither looks nor feels like  any other film I've seen.  Warren Beatty gives the performance of his  career here(you wouldn't know he and Altman were at odds the entire shoot)  and I will forever remember the lovely Julie Christie as Mrs. Miller, the  tough talking shrewd and business smart prostitute. Altman's sensational  style of filmmaking perfectly suits the material, his remarkable use of  overlapping dialogue demands multiple viewings, and Vilmos Zsigmond's  incredible, ususual cinematography is endlessly fascinating to look at.  And ,as with most of Altman's work, one can interpet the film a number of  ways.  Is it a tough look at achieving the American Dream, or is it a study  of American frontierism/individualism vs. community/democracy? Is it (as  one previous reviewer commented)an indictment of Capitalism and a look at  the way Big Business encroached on the frontier and a simple way of life.  Is it a study of loneliness and heroism? The answer is yes to all of these.  To top it off, Altman's use of Leonard Cohen's songs to accompany the film  adds to the overall sense of melancholy, it fits it beautifully.  If I  sound like I'm gushing, I am, great films have that effect.  See this  now!",959990400,18,1629,4.955390334572491
112925,5,0790741067,"The fact that this film isn't as celebrated as some of the other classics of the early 70s is a shame. It perfectly captures a unique mood and setting. The last 20 minutes are among the greatest in film history. Beatty  and Christie are perfect in their roles. Hugh Millais, making his acting  debut, deserved an Oscar for his icy portrayal of Butler, the bounty  hunter. I consider myself a fan of Altman, but I think his loose style has  ruined many of his films. However, all the pieces fall into place perfectly  here. You will need to watch this at least twice, to catch all the dialogue  and other little subtleties. Plus, the ending's depressing. But it's worth  it.",944870400,6,673,4.558333333333334
112926,5,0790741067,"Robert Altman's ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller"" is one of those jewels that continue to shine while other movies fade.  Maybe it is because it is so atypical of the genre and paints a picture so realistic, not only in the  period it represents and the mining town itself, but also in the community  of people living within.  Add to that, one of the most brilliantly  conceived final shoot-outs, and you have a film that continues to  mesmerize.  I believe that this is Warren Beatty's best film.  In my  opinion, it certainly outshines ""Bonnie and Clyde"".  Once you begin viewing  the film, you quickly realize that all the actors play their parts as if  they were living their rolls, not acting them, and Julie Christie is  especially good.  ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller"" is one of my favorite films and  I give it a solid 10 out of 10.",924048000,,825,4.517006802721088
