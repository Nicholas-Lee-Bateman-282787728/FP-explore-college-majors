6496572,4,B00LOCL99Y,"There's a lot of different phrases & words to describe the relationship & history of these two men together but the best one that comes to my mind is, ""Nobody fights like family"" as Undertaker & Kane have been linked together for close to 2 decades through memorable battles from various singles encounters including both of their WrestleMania matches to brutal historic matches such as the Inferno Match & Hell In A Cell & Buried Alive & No Holds Barred.  However there have been many times where both of these men were allied together on the same side against either a common enemy or had the same goal in mind which is here in this set called appropriately ""The Brothers Of Destruction"" as this DVD contains sets of matches throughout different periods of their careers where they teamed together throughout WWE.

Matches Include:
No Disqualification Match vs. WWE Tag Team Champions Edge & Christian - This match had a unique setup in that Kane lost his Hardcore Championship to Rhyno earlier in the night with help from Edge & Christian setting up this match with Rhyno in their corner.  Kane was coming into this match with an injured left arm which E&C attempted to target right away even before Taker made his entrance to no avail as Kane was dominate using power offense despite only having one man before it took a numbers advantage to finally take Kane down & heavily working over the arm with a weapon eventually coming into play along with others who had a agenda of their own in a fun match that was also creating a bit of history trivia for Kane that often gets forgotten about.
""SmackDown"" Apr. '01

Tables Match vs. Dudley Boyz - It should be noted that this match happened during the WWE vs. WCW/ECW Alliance feud with Undertaker's wife Sara was at ringside for this match as it started out as a brawl in & out of the ring with one team trying to use the strategy of divide & conquer only for the other team to take back control but having to overcome various odds including a biased official & others who had a personal agenda of their own in a quick contest that served it's purpose.
""RAW"" July '01

vs. WCW Tag Team Champions Chuck Palumbo & Sean O'Haire - There isn't much to say here past this match lasted under 5 minutes & was a completely squash performance by Taker & Kane as dominated the champions both individually & as a team as it took a weapon for Palumbo & O'Haire to get offense in which didn't last long at all.  It should be noted that Taker & Kane's rivals in DDP & Kanyon also won the WWE Tag Team Championship earlier in the night setting up...
""SmackDown"" Aug. '01

WCW Tag Team Championship/Steel Cage Match vs. WWE Tag Team Champions Diamond Dallas Page & Kanyon - ...this match with both sets of championships on the line with Sara outside the ring ""holding"" the key to the cage door locking everyone inside as Taker & Kane continued to beat down both men in the opening moments with no offense from DDP & Kanyon having any effect including trying to ram them into the cage only for the brothers continuing to be dominate focusing more of getting revenge more than winning the match to the point where DDP & Kanyon were just trying to get out whenever they had the chance.  Jim Ross on commentary pretty much said it best, ""what an ass kicking!""
Summerslam '01

vs. MVP & Mr. Kennedy - This was a preview of the upcoming Armageddon PPV where both brothers had matches against their opponents (Kane vs. MVP in a Inferno match & Undertaker vs. Kennedy in a Last Ride Match) with a hearse parked in the isleway as Taker & Kane started out very dominate easily overpowering their opponents before a distraction allowed Kennedy & MVP to gain control attempting to single out one member of the opposing team before the action did get out of control with brawling all around ringside & the stage area to the point where one man even attempted to use the hearse to run over one of his opponents.
""SmackDown"" Dec. '06

vs. Mark Henry & Big Daddy V - This match started out joined in progress with both super heavyweights singling out one member using their size to their advantage with various splashes & a bearhug causing Taker & Kane to resort to their trademark offense both individually & as a team to take away their size & power by keeping their opponents off their feet & keeping them grounded.
""SmackDown"" Feb. '08

vs. The Miz & John Morrison - It should be noted that despite Miz & Morrison being the WWE Tag Team Champions that this was a non-title match as Taker & Kane started out very dominate in the early going with Miz & Morrison's offense having little to no effect before they were finally able to gain an advantage taking away the power & size advantage working over one of the opposing team's legs continuously with quick tags & double teaming resulting in Miz & Morrison putting together a better competitive match against the Brothers Of Destruction that most other teams (on this set alone) had previously done.
""ECW"" Apr. '08

(Blu-Ray) vs. Steve Austin & Billy Gunn - Austin was scheduled to defend the WWE Championship against both Kane & Undertaker at the upcoming Breakdown PPV with Mr. McMahon making this match with Austin only having a partner on a volunteer basis which ended up being Billy Gunn.  This match started out with a bang with all four men brawling in & outside the ring with one man being sent into the steps in the opening moments as Austin & Gunn were able to work over each brother individually before a distraction allowed Taker & Kane to take over singling out one member of the team in a good intense tag team match that did it's job continuing the story of the WWE Championship match going into the PPV.
""RAW"" Sept. '98

(Blu-Ray) vs. Steve Austin & The Rock - This match had a very interesting setup as took place on RAW before the upcoming Judgment Day PPV where Undertaker & Kane were scheduled to face each other for the vacant WWE Championship with Austin as the special referee while The Rock was the #1 contendor for that championship.  All four men started brawling from the start with Austin & Rock making it clear that they didn't like each other but had to get along to survive with some double teamwork from them before Taker & Kane were able to take back control singling out one man working him over on both the inside & outside of the ring while other outside parties who had issues with the participants in the match made their presence known as well.
""RAW"" Oct. '98

(Blu-Ray) WWE Tag Team Championship Match vs. WWE Champion Steve Austin & Intercontinental Champion Triple H - For the first time in WWE history, the original top four championships (World, I.C., Tag Team) were all on the line in one match with Jim Ross also making the side note that Triple H would become the second ""Grand Slam"" champion in WWE history if his team were to win tonight. Kane came into the match with arm heavily bandaged from previous attacks as Austin & HHH kept stalling on the outside causing Taker & Kane to take the fight to them on the stage & ringside before bring it back into the ring where they dominated in the early minutes include Taker delivering Old School onto both men. Austin & HHH regained the advantage by double teaming & keeping Taker while taking advantage of the situation that he didn't want to tag Kane in due to his bad arm before Kane eventually tagged himself in causing what Taker feared to happen in that they targeted his arm with wrestling such as an armbar takedown & stretch while working behind the referee's back & taunting Taker causing a distraction to also use weapons from a chair to the steel steps. This was a fun tag match with all the star power & personalities involved along with the storytelling of the match revolving around Kane's arm.
Backlash '01
[Triple H: Thy Kingdom Come]

(Blu-Ray) w/Daniel Bryan vs. The Shield - The Brothers Of Destruction reunited here with Daniel Bryan & being very dominate from Kane's strikes to Bryan's various kicks along with Undertaker going ""old school"" while isolating one member of the team away from his partners including one of Bryan's clotheslines turning Seth Rollins inside out before The Shield was able to regain control using the same strategy of keeping one opponent away from his partners using the numbers to their advantage with double & triple teaming keeping them grounded on the floor. This was a fun back & forth six man tag match with the highlight being Undertaker's first match on RAW in 3 years.

[Best Of RAW & SmackDown 2013]

Well this was one of those no frills DVD sets that was designed to just give you some of Undertaker & Kane's tag team matches to watch within one viewing with the significance being against either a top team at that time, a championship victory, or rivals so this set accomplishes that goal with most of the matches being previously unreleased so I would recommend for fans of the Brothers Of Destruction.",1405296000,10,8944,4.565461346633416

All fights in this DVD are from 2002-2009 or maybe 2010. Don't get me wrong, they're good fights. I love the brothers of destruction, but this DVD is missing a lot. Too much to not be upset about (if you're a huge fan). I'm definitely considering emailing wwe and asking them what's up with this. Maybe it was a mistake of some sort.",1420070400,3,486,4.293478260869565

6496660,4,B00LOCL99Y,"Like every Kane and Taker set that's been released, this is just a match compilation set. But this has no extra features aside from the main feature which is the following list of matches:

vs Edge & Christian - No DQ match for the Tag Titles
Smackdown - April 2001

This took place in April 2001 on Smackdown. It's interesting because heading into this night, Taker and Kane didn't look to win tag team gold. But then Regal has Kane defending his Hardcore Title against Rhyno, who wins with help from Edge and Christian, and Austin and HHH. Taker and Kane go into Regal's office and demand E&C and The Two Man Power Trip. Requested granted after what the brothers did to Regal's office. But in order to get to Austin and HHH, they had to defeat Edge and Christian in a No DQ match.

Good TV match to end the show. Taker didn't see much action. I figured he should have considering Kane's arm. The outcome of this match greatly affected the main event of Backlash 2001.

Tables Match vs. Dudley Boyz - Tables Match
RAW - July 2001

This took place during the Taker/DDP feud while the whole Invasion deal was happening. So Taker's wife at the time, Sara was at ringside.

vs. WCW Tag Team Champions Chuck Palumbo & Sean O'Haire - WCW Tag Team Titles
Smackdown - August 2001

TOTAL DOMINANCE by Taker and Kane. Enough said!

DDP and Kanyon - Steel Cage match for the WWF and WCW Tag Team Titles
Summerslam 2001

Although the Alliance team got their shots in, this was for the most part, TOTAL DOMINATION from the WWF team in Taker and Kane. Some things to take notice of:
1. Taker and Kane's old school sit up!
2. Kane, upon Taker's request let Kanyon go, who left DDP on his own. This was done so Taker could end this feud by getting all the payback he's wanted to on DDP.

vs. MVP & Mr. Kennedy
Smackdown - December 2006

A preview to Armageddon here where Kane would face MVP in an Inferno match and Taker and Kennedy would face off in a Last Ride match. Good preview. But this two teams met before in November 2006. I preferred that one because it was the first time in five years that Taker and Kane teamed up.

vs. Mark Henry & Big Daddy V
Smackdown - February 2008

In terms of match quality, they match on the last Smackdown of 2006 where they faced Booker T and Finlay would have been a better fit.

vs. The Miz & John Morrison
ECW - April 2008

Two dominant veterans against a team consisting of a talent with a hell of a bright future and another who is now known as the A-List Move Star. Not a bad recipe for a match. It was a good match. I knew Taker and Kane would win, but was happy with Morrison's performance.

The following is exclusive to the Bluray edition, which I believe is only released in Europe.

vs. Steve Austin & Billy Gunn
RAW - September 1998

Nice match that I could not wait to see again. I just wish they added the pre-match interview Cole had with Taker and Kane because Taker delivered some of the best lines of his career during that interview.

Steve Austin & The Rock
RAW - October 1998

Six days before fighting each other for the vacant WWF Title in a match referred by one of their opponents in this tag match (Austin of all people), Taker and Kane had to tag up together to face Rock and Austin, who put their storied history aside to combat the greater threat. One of the best TV main events of 1998. Considering the talent involved, how could it not be?

vs Austin and HHH - All Titles On The Line
Backlash 2001

This is the second time in WWE that this type of match was seen (the first was in 1995 at the In Your House: Triple Header PPV)

Taker/Kane//Daniel Bryan vs. The Shield -
RAW - April 22, 2013

Like the first match on this collection, not much action from Taker. But here, he's much older and his body is more worn out.

Good for whatever it was, I guess. Considering this history these two had, this could have and should have been a two disc blu ray/three disc DVD set as a good portion of Taker and Kane's matches as a team were left off.
1. vs Ken Shamrock, Mankind, and The Rock - RAW, September 1998 (night after Breakdown: In Your House)
2. vs Edge and Christian vs The Dudleyz - No Way Out 2001
3. vs Rikishi/Haku/Christian - Smackdown, 2001
4. vs Rikishi/Haku -- Tag Team First Blood match - Smackdown X-TREME 2001
5. vs Kennedy and MVP - Smackdown, November 2006
6. vs Matt Hardy and MVP - Smackdown 2007 (forgot the month)
7. vs Jericho and Big Show - Smackdown, November 2009 (3 nights before Survivor Series)

Also their RAW 1,000 Reunion would have been a nice extra.",1413504000,4,4536,4.300822561692127
6496661,3,B00LOCL99Y,"The Brothers of Destruction: Greatest Matches wasn't a bad DVD, 7 great matches that were quite entertaining. My favorite matches being the Attitude era ones, but one huge problem about this DVD is its only 90 mins long, the back of the DVD says runtime 3 hours long which is a blatent lie. And the DVD is pretty bare bones too. Not much effort was put in to this dvd. But the matches are the strong point of the DVD. Which as it should.
