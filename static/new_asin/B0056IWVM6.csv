The most telling thing I can say, is that on first viewing- in a room full of drunken friends there mostly to poke fun at the rough vfx and acting - a silence fell as everyone shut up and actually watched.  It's an engaging film.  And Jeffree Newman is the next John Malkovich.  Good stuff.",1333670400,,389,4.287671232876712
8459721,5,B0056IWVM6,"To describe the theme of this film--that the mind is the forge that creates our world--is apt to sound a bit . . . what?  enormous? for a science fiction flick.  But here the idea is developed with humor, some fine photography, some knock-your-socks-off special effects--the mind moves particles and forms them into the realities of life.  And some excellent acting.  The film overcomes the limitations of small budget and two-week shooting schedule. It is a genuinely engaging experience.",1310774400,,489,5.151898734177215
8459722,5,B0056IWVM6,"Well, to start let me ask you this, have you ever seen a nano-tech family drama? NO! That's what I thought, so for starters let's just say this movie is original which is more than I can say for about 95% of movies out there. Let me ask you another question, have you ever seen a more studlier actor thank Luke Clements? Maybe, I'll say Barry Pepper and Laurence Fishburne during the Matrix trilogy but the point is that the lead in this movie is dynamite, he carries the film like cheetah would a half dead gazelle after some wicked Nat-Geo chase scene. The music is chub worthy and by that I mean I had a chub half the movie because I dug the score so much. The cinematographer (Patrick Lavalley) makes Nstor Almendros look like my 12 year old sister's VHS footage of her and her friends acting out Babysitter's Club. The direction is solid, most of these guys would probably have been lost in the enormity of the script if it weren't for Jason Windsor getting all Kubrick Vs. Shelley Duvall on their asses. Speaking of the script, I should mention that Colin O'neill whipped this thing up in 6 days...6 DAYS! It takes me 6 days to sign for my welfare check let alone writing a script, a great script.

Overall this movie rules and if you don't see it you're going to look like the guy who asked who Arcade Fire was when they won their Grammy. So, get a copy or just come visit me in Portland and you can borrow mine.

Love
