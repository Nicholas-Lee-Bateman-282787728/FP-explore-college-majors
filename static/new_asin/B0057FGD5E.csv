4595329,5,B0057FGD5E,"One of the things I was really concerned about with the release of this series in the US was whether or not the quirkiness of the Japanese dialogue would hold up in an English dubbed version. Media Blasters has been relatively on and off with their dubbing for shows in the past. However, I can say without reservation that they have done an incredible job with the English language version for this release. The quality of the dub has really impressed me, and I believe that it shows that Media Blasters really put in the effort to make this show stand out.

The English dub was able to retain the ""squiddleness"" of the original dialogue, and it has transferred very well. Fans who have already seen the show will note the lack of ""de geso"" as a part of the English lines, but I don't know how well it would have sounded in English had it been incorporated. It is the one trademark part of the dialogue that will be missed by those who have seen the Japanese version. Luckily though, you have the option to switch to Japanese with subtitles to get your fill of de geso. Besides that, I feel the voice talent chosen for this show has been very well selected, and all of the English voice actors hold up really well in their roles, while managing to capture the essence of the original characters extremely well. For these reasons I've given this release 5-stars for simply exceeding expectations.

The artwork for this release is also a plus side. The DVD cover design looks great and is very befitting of the show. The DVD menus look great as well; they are well laid out, and are easy to navigate. I look forward to the possibility of a Blu-ray release later on, as this show certainly deserves it.",1317081600,16,1700,4.480645161290322

-DVD Review-
The Quality is better than I expected for the DVD release, since DVDs tend to use a more compressed format than Blu Rays, the only thing that sounds weird is the menu music, which is obviously not important unless you like just listening to a low quality version of the opening theme.

There are two DVDs in this first part, so I assume the entire series will be on four DVDs. They arrived unattached to their holding spots in the DVDs, but that's shipping for you. They play fine so far as I can tell.

The Dub isn't horrible, though I'm sure a lot of people would beg to differ with me. I watched some parts in English and the voices certainly fit the characters, whether or not they sound awkward at times is debatable. Though I'll admit you're not going to get some of the charm the Japanese voice actress of Squid Girl gives for her performance (maybe I'm just a sucker for all the ""De Geso"" lines?). It's not like I understand Japanese so I can't really say the English dub is complete crap, but then again I can't say the Japanese voice track is amazing because I don't understand it... While I generally watch the show in the original language with subtitles, I'll admit I've been a lot more impressed with the dubs of recent anime. I'm not so much impressed with Squid Girl's dub, but it's certainly not unwatchable. Though now I sound like I'm contradicting myself... oh well.

The only complaints I have are the Subtitles, not the translation, the color of the text. Why do companies still think Yellow text with a Black outline looks good? I just don't think it looks good, though that's really just a minor complaint.

So the question stands: Should I buy Squid Girl?
I say you should at least check out some clips and see if you like it, I generally watch a few episodes, if I can, and then decide if I want to continue the series. At the time I'm writing this the entire series including the first episode of season two are available to watch on Crunchy Roll's site.

-The DVD extras include-
Textless Opening
Textless Closings (there are 6, all 12 are more or less the same, however, each one has something different about it)
Interview with Hisako Kanemoto (not that the box explains who that is)
and Hat Folding

Not quite the ""chock full of extras"" they were exclaiming the discs would have when they released them, though it's better than the nothing they tend to put on DVDs these days, some companies even claiming subtitles are ""special features"". I guess I'll have to buy part two to get the rest of the Mini Squid Girl shorts which the Japanese releases included with one of the later releases, so I guess it's only fair that this company does the same to the Stateside release and at least in the US we don't have to pay a bundle and only get two episodes a piece I guess. This is like Shakugan no Shana's extras, all the Shakugan no Shana-tan's are going to be on the season 2 discs... if Funimation ever decides to release those. (though this review isn't about my distaste for their release schedule, though Angel Beats which came out exactly 1 year after it aired in Japan has a really good dub (you know they aren't spending that time on the subtitles)... takes Funimation however many years they see fit I guess...)

-Original Post-
I originally watched this show when it was airing in Japan for the first time, it's an interesting premise of a Squid Girl coming to shore to punish the humans for polluting the ocean. However she underestimates the number of humans and the fighting forces they have after unsuccessfully trying to take over the Lemon Beach House, owned by the other three main characters. Eiko, Chizuru and Takeru Aizawa. They tell her to take off her silly cosplay and stop bothering the customers, she later reveals what she is there for and eventually has a mosquito buzzing around her, to which Chizuru exclaims ""You can't even handle a little bug, how could you possibly invade the world and take on Humans?"" To which Ika uses her tentacles and busts a hole in the side of the restaurant, killing the bug, and making Chizuru really mad. So the story begins with Ika having to pay off her debt from the damage she caused, it's a comedy anime and it's also very cutesy, not straight up moe, though what anime series this day and age doesn't have cute girls doing cute things? I feel this series pulled off this story rather well, not having to rely on all the jokes they could've done since Ika isn't exactly aware of how things work on the surface. There are a lot of bad movies and shows that also use this premise, however Ika doesn't fail to please. In the first episode Ika decides she's tired of being bossed around by Chizuru and Takeru and tries to take them down by using her Tentacles, Eiko comes back to the beach house and manages to free the two and scare the living ink out of Ika.

The rest of the series is basically Ika having to deal with various characters, one that thinks she's super cute and she wants to hug her to death. Some Scientists who are trying to convince her that she's an alien and want to do various experiments on her, and the rest of the gang just trying to keep her from invading or at least trying to.

Over all, I'd recommend this series to first time anime watchers and veterans alike, the animation is very well done and the entire series was a joy to watch. Ika is a very likable character and makes the entire series a joy from start to finish.

I'm a little upset that they're not just releasing the series all at once, and that it will only be on DVD, but at least it's being localized and more people can enjoy it. I'm definitely putting my money down for Ika and I hope this review helps you decide whether or not you want to.
When I receive my DVDs I'll be sure to edit this if I can and review them.",1312848000,16,5838,4.426443202979516

4595332,1,B0057FGD5E,"When this anime finally came, I opened the case and the DVDs fell out, scratched and useless, as though somebody had crammed them into the case. It was very disappointing, especially since I waited quite a bit for it; I would not recommend buying this product.",1409443200,,260,4.673913043478261
4595333,5,B0057FGD5E,"This has to be one of the funniest anime series I've watched. It also has a lot of heart and great characters. Part 2 is definitely a requirement! If you can find the series in one collection, even better!",1404691200,,205,4.282051282051282
4595334,5,B0057FGD5E,"When I first checked out the first episode, I was already enjoying the show very much. The plot started with Squid Girl coming to surface to invade mankind for polluting the ocean but quickly she found herself in debt for breaking the wall of the Lemon Beach House restaurant owned by Chizuru, Eiko, and Takeru, she ended up working for them to pay off her debt, the comedic moment is mostly revolve around Squid Girl trying to learn to live the surface life though there is a couple of emotional moment that make you really care for the character. Squid Girl talked with fish pun in it with thing like: that's kraken hurt!, you are bunch of silly school of fish, or leave me the squid the alone.

Overall, the show is fresh and easy to follow, the comedy is clean and funny, and Squid Girl is charming and moe. I just wish the series was longer than just 12 episodes, technically there's another season of this series but Media Blasters decided to cancelled the release for the 2nd season so I am afraid the 2nd season might not get to see the light of day in the US release hopefully Funimation or other companies will licensed the 2nd season at some point in the future.",1401321600,,1173,4.430555555555555
4595335,5,B0057FGD5E,"When I saw this I laughed because of the jokes and puns and the story is about a girl squid who comes from the sea to invade surface world. The story is cute light hear-ted  and will make you want to keep on watching. It's silly and cute at the same time and i have found that its re-watch ability never gets old.

When I received my order, the DVDs fell out of the case and both are very scratched up. Its not a one star rating because they still play. Going to return the DVD ASAP. I don't like the fact that I have to be extremely careful whenever I move the case with the DVDs inside. I'd rather get the bluray for extra price because it don't be all scratched up and I won't have to worry when I move it around. Don't take your chances of getting a cheap one if you can get the bluray version better",1390867200,2,584,4.043103448275862
4595337,5,B0057FGD5E,"Id like to imagine that squid girl is the result of the dark lord Cthulhu rising up out of the oceanic depths from the city of Rlyeh to seduce and impregnate an eco friendly valley girl.

And that the child of this unholy union would one day rise up out of the sea herself to lay claim to a Japanese seaside restaurant as her base of operations to conquer all the surface dwellers for foolishly polluting the oceans.

While Id consider the squid girl series a show written to appeal more to kids than adults I found that the whimsical characters and story won me over. Maybe its the Lovecraft fan boy in me or maybe its squid girls constant aquatic puns!",1387152000,,654,4.352459016393443
4595338,4,B0057FGD5E,"well done likes all around.
so get this it's worth watching. cosplay worthy so give it a try. yay teams",1367712000,,103,4.2
4595339,5,B0057FGD5E,"Originally I did not watch this series. I saw the premise of it and figured it would be an eco warrior style of series. The ideas have been done so I passed on it. Then I saw a season two being aired in Japan. On that alone, I took another look. If it is good enough for two seasons, then I figure ""maybe I misjudged it?""

That in the end turned out to be true. Squid Girl is one of the funniest anime I've seen over the years. Each episode, each character, everything is just fantastic. Squid Girl starts her invasion to get revenge on humans for their treatment of the sea. She makes it to a beach restaurant and there, the hilarity begins as she manages to invade the hearts of everyone there.

This is a show that you'll find yourself watching time and time again. You'll also find it safe for many ages. I've shown it to relatives in their 60s and they had a ball with this one. Which just goes to show, you are never too old when you are young at heart. Hopefully we'll get season two released here soon. It just gets better and better. If you can't wait, go watch it online already. But be sure and buy it when it is released! This show is a keeper, there is no doubt about that.

The English dub is respectable. It lacks the Musume accent and some of the humor of the Japanese dub but it isn't bad.

With that said...
