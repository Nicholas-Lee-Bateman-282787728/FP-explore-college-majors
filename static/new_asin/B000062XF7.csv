7957746,4,B000062XF7,"A little funny title because though Burt Lancaster is the star of ""The kentuckian"" he is not in John Wayne's ""The Alamo"" (cover photo).  A very interesting twosome to couple into a set.  Acceptable transfer of the film to DVD, nice way to add a rarer movie with a much more well-known big budget one.  Recommend getting at a decent price.",1442448000,,338,4.508196721311475
7957747,5,B000062XF7,"THE ALAMO is one of my top 10 favorite movies of all time. THE ALAMO is one of our nation's greatest cinematic icons of ""Film Americana"" ever made. Through word, song and picture the legend of the Alamo was handed down and stills lives today. Men and women of different religious, ethnic and social backgrounds came together and died or lost loved ones at the Alamo in a noble effort to overcome tyranny and preserve basic human freedoms. John Wayne preserved that legend on film. John Wayne produced, directed and starred in this epic mixing nobility with bawdiness resulting in a reverence for the ideals of the defenders seen through their personal lives and conduct. The cast, script, production design and score added to the richly textured look and feel to the film. John Wayne is effective in his portrayal of Col. David Crockett. However, John Wayne takes a back seat to the brilliant performances of Laurence Harvey as Col. William Travis and Richard Widmark as Col. James Bowie as they feud and bicker over the virtues of military protocol vs. military expedience. Wayne in turn approaches the role of Crockett as the levelheaded onlooker who interjects this legend with passages of homespun witticism to keep the defenders from losing focus of their reason for being there. Cinematographer William Clothier's images are proud and majestic depicting the honor of the defenders. James Edward Grant's script is intelligent, energetic and moving. Equally energetic and moving is the eloquent and multi-textured score by Dimitri Tiomkin. Tiomkin's scoring of the final battle scene is brilliant and highly overlooked. Tiomkin integrates the nobility of the combatants with the fervor of the conflict and with simple queues he emotionally captures the falling of each defender in a brief moment of reflection as the battle rages on. His song ""The Green Leaves of Summer"" is beautiful, reflective and haunting and is effectively integrated into the context of why the defenders gave their lives. THE ALAMO thanks to John Wayne's determination and insight to what drives the American spirit.

THE KENTUCKIAN is pure Americana. This is a fantastic and breathtaking cinematic backwoods tale about America in the early 18th century from Felix Holt's novel The Gabriel Horn. Burt Lancaster directed this film with a rather somber and endearing hand and played the central character. A father and his son set out across Kentucky to reach Texas and encounter a very cynical lot of humanity living in the town of Humility in solid allegorical fashion. Father and son become embroiled in several obstacles that impede and threaten their dreams of Texas. The beautifully haunting Appalachian score by Bernard Herrmann sets the evocative mood of this film embracing human desires, wants and needs of the soul and all the fears and obstacles that must be encountered along the way that characterize the American frontier spirit. Despite disparaging critical reaction to Lancaster's direction, this film contains some very memorable scenes for anyone who has seen it. The reloading of the flintlock rifle scene, President Monroe's letter on the fresh water pearls, and the bullwhip confrontation between Walter Matthau and Lancaster are all unforgettable moments in this film. I think Lancaster did both a fantastic job of acting and directing in THE KENTUCKIAN. It is one of my favorite films.",1337731200,,3385,5.165755919854281
