8202784,5,B000RW9A84,"I was 2/3 way through the ""Quantum Story"" book by Jim Baggort, and didn't understand half of what I read.  But as an enthusiastic reader, I was unwilling to give up. Somehow I got hold of these DVDs and started watching. The result is: I just finished watching them all, understood the physics sense of every subject that has been covered, and felt very satisfied and encouraged to read more.

Professor Richard Wolfson did an excellent job to lay out the physics sense of the laws of relativity and quantum mechanics without getting into complex math equations. He was good at driving home the understanding of the essence of the laws by describing how they work in easy-to-understand examples and in connection to the definitions of the laws.  I was feeling quantum mechanics a bit mysterious while reading the ""Quantum Story"" book, but after watching Dr. Wolfson's lectures, the mystery disappeared. All were explained in plain language, no more, no less. I gained a consistent and convincing understanding of modern physics that was not diluted in the process of being made accessible to a non-scientist.

The teaching was wonderful, the learning was joyful! and I am grateful!",1307318400,,1181,4.979695431472082
8202785,3,B000RW9A84,"The first half of this course is repetitive and full of ipse dixits.  It's as if the speaker thinks you should just ""get"" special relativity if he just repeats for you, 83 times, the tag line that ""the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion.""  In contrast, the second half, on quantum physics and general relativity, is more interesting and contains more useable nuggets of information.",1284681600,,412,4.788732394366197
8202786,4,B000RW9A84,"I would have agreed with the recommendation and opinion above, however, I was introduced to Dr. Wolfson's work when searching for an introductory level book on Einstein's theories (and their historical context) as I am currently researching the issue of God, time and eternity, which requires a working knowledge of both the special theory of relativity (""STR"") and the general theory of relativity (""GTR"").  After reading ""Simply Einstein: Relativity Demystified,"" I noticed that there was a Teaching Company presentation that largely follows the book--which is the present 4-disc presentation.  If you read the book in conjunction with the video presentation, it is quite simply the best introductory material I have reviewed to date (and I have read 4 other introductory books) related to the topic of STR, GTR and their respective applications.

I have two graduate degrees in philosophy, but I am embarassed to mention that I had no ""working"" knowledge of many of the concepts (e.g., space-time realism) and definitions of physics that overlap with segments in philosophy of religion, and specifically with issues surrounding whether God is timeless or temporal, and how GTR and STR may effect ones view that God is in time subsequent to creation of the universe.

This actually brings me to my only critique (which is true of most scientists without degrees in philosophy of science), which was the lack of emphasis on a Lorentzian approach to relativity.  Given Einstein's reliance on a defunct verificationism (via Ernst Mach), and like most science professors and scientists with little background in philosophy, Dr. Wolfson commits the same empiricist errors which is evidenced by what is NOT included in his very fine book.  If Dr. Wolfson reads these reviews then I would challenge him to read ""Einstein, Relativity and Absolute Simultaneity,"" published in 2008 by Routledge, and edited by William Lane Craig and Quentin Smith.  As far as I can tell, this is the very first book devoted largely to arguing for the absoluteness of simultaneity.

Dr. William Lane Craig's other materials on the metaphysics of relativity, the tensed and tenseless theories of time, provide further thought provoking insights on these overlapping concepts of time (static v. dynamic theory), temporal becoming, and comparisons of Minkowski's 4-dimensional ontology to Einstein and Loretnzain 3+1 ontologies--all of which must contend with STR and GTR.  And for those who care to delve into these not-so-easy concepts, Dr. Wolfson's video presentation (in conjunction with his book) is the best introduction you will find on the market.",1225670400,,2627,5.326086956521739
8202787,3,B000RW9A84,"This is a collection of 24 half-hour lessons on four DVD's by Professor Richard Wolfson of Middlebury College. The course is essentially a history of physics and a generalist (largely non-mathematical) review of physical concepts for non-scientists. The biggest success of the course is that it clarifies the dualities (and seeming irreconcilabilities) of quantum physics and general relativity. The downside of the course is that it sometimes gets hung up on minutiae and becomes very repetitive in several of the lessons.

I like the course guidebooks that come with the series, and was pleased to see the illustrations that Wolfson uses in the DVD presentations are reproduced for study in the books. I found most of the illustrations to be very useful, although some (e.g. the ""orbital precession"" diagram) are less than ideal.

Wolfson is obviously very smart, and is extremely enthused about his subject, but unlike the other courses of this nature I have enjoyed, this one was frequently confusing, and required substantial outside reading to get a grip on the material. Perhaps it was the subject matter at hand (though I have read a lot on the subject in the past), but I think part was due to presentation style and occasionally confusing sentence construction. Another annoying feature of this program is Wolfson's tendency to introduce a topic and immediately say that he doesn't have time to cover it. Then why introduce it at all?

The historical portion of the program is excellent, and I definitely recommend it for a historical overview of scientific thought, but the explanations of the phenomena themselves, while adequate, were unspectacular. I recommend this course only to those with the patience to rewind frequently and study on their own, otherwise the material becomes quite tedious very rapidly.",1207440000,4,1822,5.190476190476191
