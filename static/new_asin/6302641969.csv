487581,4,6302641969,"The Mating Game is a good movie when you are tired of all the macho, one man takes on the bad guys kind of entertainment. Fun with adult themes nicely vague. Tony Randal is doing what he does best..acting. It's a good down home type of movie. I highly recommend it for people who need a break from the usual stuff shown today.",1274227200,,326,4.190476190476191

487584,5,6302641969,"This movie is a timeless classic.  The entire case is delightful, and it sure stands the test of time.  Tony Randall and Debbie Reynolds are perfect together, and it is possible that Randall's comedy outshines his turns in the Rock Hudson/Doris Day classics.  A great family film, but just enjoyable for adults.",1253318400,,311,4.9423076923076925
487585,5,6302641969,"Wendell Burnshaw (Philip Ober) wants his neighbor Pop Larkin (Paul Douglas) to stop borrowing his pig for breeding purposes and contacts his friend in the IRS Oliver Kelsey (Fred Clark). Oliver Kelsey sends Lorenzo Charlton (Tony Randall) as the IRS agent to evaluate what is owed by Pop Larkin. Evidently Pop has not played any taxes ever. Lorenzo finds more than he planed on when they ""take him in."" On top of everything else the Larrikins have a daughter Mariette (Debbie Reynolds) that is coming of age; it is spring and therefore ""The Mating Season.""

This is one of Tony Randall's best. Debbie Reynolds is a little smarter than her Tammy character.

This story is based on a book ""The Darling Buds of May"" by H.E. Bates.

487586,4,6302641969,"The price is a little steep for foreigners (plus shipping and taxes) but reasonable in the US.
TONY RANDALL was an outstanding actor, capable of bringing nuances into farce. Besides the excellent PAUL DOUGLAS, we find CHARLES LANE, an old hand, usually in newspapermen roles, and SMILEY BURNETTE, ex western sidekick, both known for their parts in PETTICOAT JUNCTION. And FRED CLARK usually a long suffering character,clinging to his dignity.
The CINEMASCOPE photography is excellent. GEORGE MARSHALL was an old hand ,since 1916, with many hits in his career.
The picture is supposed to be based on THE DARLING BUDS OF MAY, a nice novel by (British) H.E. BATES, later a British TV series.
There is nothing to add to the good summary by Amazon.
Enjoy!",1246233600,2,750,4.9603174603174605
487587,3,6302641969,"The Mating Game is a fun but somewhat tedious film about a family who has not paid taxes their whole lives. They live with little income; they trade to get what they need for their large family. When the IRS discovers that they have never contributed to the government, a man goes to audit them. He finds it very difficult to determine what they owe due to their strange way of living and the fact that the teenage daughter (Debbie Reynolds) won't stop manhandling him. To make matters even more frustrating- for him at least- is that the family keeps bringing up that the government owes them payment for horses taken during the Civil War.

The movie can make you think about the way the government works, a somewhat corrupt and unfair system. Although taxes paid for the IRS workers' car, it is considered taboo for the taxpayers to even touch it. The debt to the family from the Civil War is laughed at, but yet the taxes owed for a few decades are of the highest importance. However, these issues are barely touched upon due to the jovial nature of the film.

The cast is great, especially Reynold's whose youthful vibrance lights up the screen whether she's running around shrieking or seducing older men.

Overall, this is not a bad way to waste some time, but it isn't overly inspiring or exciting.",1146787200,,1305,4.592274678111588
487588,3,6302641969,Yes this is a cute movie and was amusing and as a fan of Debbie Reynolds and Tony Randall it was worth watching even though the character who Debbie Reynolds played was kind of annoying at times I still enjoyed the movie.,1122681600,2,221,4.285714285714286

Tony Randall was great!  It is a very old fashioned  movie, one that made you laugh, and in the end one that made you feel good.  We need more movies like that today.  I have to say, being able to own the  movie myself, and being able to watch it again, will be great. I'm going to  order a copy...but, don't count on being able to borrow it, I'm going to be  watching it too much, and then having my children watch it, too.

do a terrific job. I amazed at the stunts Debbie did with a horse jumping
over fences and jumping out of a hayloft with three men trying to out chase her!
Paul Douglas(dad) hasn't paid taxes and he trades everything with neighbors.
Bartering might be the way of the future-who knows. He has a homemade liquor
unit and tries to share with everyone. The other children(twins) are very creative
and the younger brothers ""tinker"" on cars(govt cars). Very talented family on a farm.

487686,2,6302641969,"I came across this film on TMC channel today. I hadn't heard of it before but after just a few minutes recognized the story-line as an Americanized version that of H.E. Bates novel ""The Darling Buds of May"" upon which is it loosely based, so I was keen to watch it, being a fan the TV series version of Bates' books.

It started out okay but descended into a silly, slapstick version that is typical of Hollywood films of the 1950s. I do like that it is somewhat old-fashioned and not full of the crass, vulgar elements that fill today's movies, but I really found this too ridiculous to be funny.

I would instead recommend the British TV Series (1991-93) starting David Jason, Pam Ferris and Catherine Zeta Jones - it's still a lighthearted comedy but much less slapstick, better acting and closer to the original Pop Larkin books . This film corresponds to the first two episodes of the Series 1, which is the best of the three series.  You can buy these on Amazon, too.",1473638400,,973,4.4858757062146895

487755,5,6302641969,"""The Mating Game"" was a great vehicle for Debbie Reynolds, but it was a superb vehicle for Tony Randall, and my favorite of his few starring roles. Normally in those days Randall played second fiddle to romantic leads like Rock Hudson. In ""The Mating Game"" he plays an IRS auditor sent to investigate a thriving farm whose family has never filed income tax returns.

The Larkin family, congenitally friendly, happy, and generous, has a profound influence on Randall's character. It doesn't hurt that he becomes more and more fond of their pretty daughter, played by Reynolds. When Randall's boss presents the Larkin's with an unpayable tax bill, the story reaches its crisis.

The is an utterly charming, delightful, funny feel-good comedy that never seems dated.

Highly recommended.

Notes:
* The movie was taken from a a book by H. E. Bates, ""The Darling Buds of May"". It is the first of five novels (and novellas) about ""Pop Larkin"". The original story is English, but the movie changed the setting to Maryland.
* The title ""The Darling Buds of May"" is from Shakespeare's Sonnet 18, more famously known from its opening line, ""Shall I compare thee to a summer's day"".
* After watching this movie again recently, I was inspired to buy the first four books (the first three in one volume) ... and actually on paper! That's a concession, because I've been firmly dedicated to ebooks since I got my first Kindle years ago.
* I also discovered that from 1991-1993 the BBC aired ""The Darling Buds of May"" as a TV series, and the eldest daughter was an early role for Catherine Zeta-Jones! If you have an all-region player, you can get the series for a song from Amazon.co.uk. They want an arm and a leg for it on this site.",1440288000,,1721,4.688741721854305
487756,5,6302641969,"Some comedies just don't get old.  This movie could be made today and it would still work.  The comedy does not age. A man who does not like his neighbor, report him to the Government for tax evasion. so the IRS sends Tony Randall to investigate, farmer ""Pop"" Larkin, played by Paul Douglass, and is bartering lifestyle. Larkin never uses cash and trades for everything the family uses.  One of his Ancestors provided the Union Army with Horses during the Civil War and was never paid.  Tony Randall is Lorenzo Charlton, who is very nave, when it comes to the ways of men and women and falls for Marietta Larking, the Framers Daughter. Rather than rely on one liners, these old comedies use situations to set up funny incidents.  Watching the comedy build and then seeing the payoff is fun and enjoyable.  The movie is funny, well directed and the actors preform their rolls very well.  The movie is fill with many familiar faces of the sitcoms of the 60's.  Debbie Reynolds is a very talented actress and may be best known today as the mother of Princess Leia, Carrie Fisher.  I enjoyed this film when I first saw the film in 1959 and did not fully understand some of the comedy.  Now I do, this is a good movie.  enjoy it.",1439769600,,1224,4.468468468468468

I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies from the 1940' right through to the 1960's. The younger generation wouldn't be a fan of this movie as they like movies with sex and violence and probably wouldn't even know who these actors were or that they were great actors.,1396656000,,654,4.282258064516129

Holloywood was cranking out ""Chick Flicks"" faster than any other time.
Since I'm a big fan of Chick-Flicks and always enjoy films with Tony Randall & Debbie Reynolds, this is a fun movie.
Also reminds me of the Ma & Pa Kettle shows I also enjoy.
Tony Randall plays a IRS agent that doesn't stand a chance against a female with marriage on her mind.",1393200000,,401,4.220779220779221

487893,5,6302641969,"We really enjoyed this cute and interesting love story with Tony Randall and Debbie Reynolds as the love interest! Randall is an uptight government agent trying to collect taxes on Debbie's parent's farm. The family doesn't have much money but knows how to ""trade things"", laugh, relax and just plain take care of each other and their neighbors! Tony gets drunk on Poppey's moonshine, a car loses an engine, there is a neighboring lovesick pig and the cutest, silliest love story ensues! The actors make the movie and It is simply a ""feel good frolicking fun movie""",1391990400,2,565,4.835051546391752
487894,5,6302641969,"I've loved this movie since I saw it as a teenager in the 1990s. It's sexy without being vulgar. Nothing inappropriate, but plenty is implied, which allows for some funny misunderstandings. A wonderful classic.",1389744000,,210,5.205882352941177
487895,5,6302641969,"The lovable Larkin clan of H.E.Bates book, ""Darling Buds of May"", are brought to life and in this adventure are facing investigation by the IRS.  Pop Larkin, played by Paul Douglas,  barters for everything and sees no reason to pay taxes. What he does see is that keeping the IRS investigator, Tony Randall, at the farm might prove an advantageous match for his spirited daughter, Mariette, Debbie Reynolds!  This wonderfully acted and very funny movie gives the free loving Larkins the attention they so well deserve.

  This same book inspired the popular British series of Darling Buds of May (The Pop Larkin Chronicles) starring Pam Ferris,  David Jason and introducing Catherine Zeta-Jones.  In the further adventures of the Larkins, it is British comedy at it's best.

You will not be disappointed by either of these versions of the story as they all are wonderfully done!  The H.E. Bates book commands a cherished spot on my library shelf.  Like Pop Larkin says,  It's perfick, just perfick!!",1389398400,4,999,4.987878787878788

This is definately not on any NETFLIX, or pay TV so either by it from the internet or look for it at garage sales.  It worth it.",1365292800,,383,4.08

Our family hardly watches the trashy programs on network TV, so we are still accumulating ""classics"" to watch when we have downtime.  Tony Randall is the perfect actor for this part!  The casting was great overall.  I highly recommend this for anyone who do Not need skin, explosions, blood and profanity to be entertained.

This is an hilariously-funny movie and quite entertaining for the entire family to watch.  From the beginning to the end, it kept us all smiling and laughing.  While growing up, these actors were, always, admired favorites of mine...because of their great reputations as talented actors, as well as having respectable character traits.  The characters and the story  was ""believable"".  I  left the movie wishing that I could live on a farm.  A sound and  respectable moral code was evident...The ""good guys"" won!

It really is a great movie to have on hand, especially if you love Tony Randall and Debbie Reynolds.  My problem is the quality of the DVD itself being fragile and made very cheaply for $17.95, for a $2 dollar DVD.  Yes, the actors are worth the price, the movie is fantastic, but why the cheaper DVD that will scratch up easily, fragile to pull  in and out of the machine/clamshell without breaking?",1498694400,,520,4.319587628865979
