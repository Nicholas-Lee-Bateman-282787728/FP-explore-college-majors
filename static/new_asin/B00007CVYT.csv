1805784,1,B00007CVYT,"This movie is classed an action/adventure, well they got the action part right.  Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu are counter espionage agents trying to outfox a supervillan for their own private revenges. Lucy Liu does some awesome karate moves, but has limited and, in fact, minimal dialog.  She shows no emotion at all until half way into the movie.  She is not the only passionless character.  There is no smiling, little frowning, just bland facial expressions, bland dialog and cinematography in an almost colorless film.  Bullets fly, Liu says, ""I buy weapons like some girls buy shoes.""  Cars blow up, trains go boom, but it is all under a colorless pale.  I gave this one star, because it was that or nothing, I wouldn't give it a nothing but a  star fits better that the one.  See this film if you're on a desert island and nothing else is playing.",1032739200,,855,4.6466666666666665
1805785,3,B00007CVYT,"Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever is not shakespeare by any means, but if you get past it's first low budget, straight to video 15 minutes that really does set up more of the story than you might think, what you'll get is an action movie worthy of having the beautiful and talented Lucy Liu starring in it. Lucy plays Sever, an ex agent who's on a mission to seek revenge against the man who took away her family. Antonio Banderas plays Johnathon Ecks, an FBI agent who's also seeking revenge on the same man for taking his wife and making her think he was dead. Both Ecks and Sever believe they are working against eachother which leads to some nice fighting and action sequences; one in which involves Sever on top of a bridge with a rocket launcher firing at any threats that come her way. Martial arts, car chases, explosions, shootings and kickings are just a few of the things you can expect to see in this movie which is also surprisingly touching when Ecks and Sever team up and learn more about eachother's past. This is not the best movie I've seen, but if you want your Charlie's Angels fix and you wanna see many, many things blow up in a no holds barred style movie, then I recommend seeing this fun flick with a group of friends.",1032739200,5,1235,4.397379912663755
1805786,3,B00007CVYT,"I don't ask every movie to break new ground or be artistic, what have you. What I ask is that it delivers what it intended to deliver. ""Ballistic"" delivers what every action-packed ""popcorn"" movie should deliver: a lot of action, great stars with fantastic chemistry, and a plot that has a twist and/or a surprise as you find out more of the backstory. In other words, entertainment. There were even a few great laughs from pithy dialogue.
This is why it puzzles me when critics pan movies like ""XXX"" which I thought was way better than the last two James Bond movies. After all, no one expects movies like XXX to win the academy award!
""Ballistic"" is better than the last Arnold Swarzenneger movie, definitely!!! I got emotionally involved because all of the characters' motivations made sense - Lucy Liu's character, it turns out, is avenging the death of her infant son. Go Lucy! I don't want to explain more of the plot than that - just be aware that you have to pay attention to understand what's going on, because things go through 180 degree turns from what you think is going on to what is indeed going on.
I won't give this movie more than 3 stars because it is only attempting to be a popcorn movie, and I recommend paying only matinee price, but considering the lack of good movies this year, you could do a lot worse.",1032739200,,1329,4.518672199170124
1805787,3,B00007CVYT,"Normally, I'm way ahead of the movie in predicting what's gonna happen when.  There were a few surprises in ""Ballistic"", and there were some good lines.  Mostly, it's a bunch of eye candy explosions and Lucy Liu kicking the men around....literally.
There did seem to be some deluded morality to the storyline that occasionally appeared between the explosions.  Sever seems to have a reason for doing what she's doing.  They also kindof set up a sequel.
The sum of my review - dollar movie, or rent it later.  It's better than some of the movies right now, but it's still not worth full ticket price.",1032652800,,599,4.666666666666667

1805860,2,B00007CVYT,"How can you go wrong in an action movie with Lucy Liu and Antonio Banderas? Well, just ask the creators of Ballistic - Ecks vs Sever. The plot is weak and some of the acting is nothing short of horrendous. The only redeeming point of this film is the excellent quality of the action sequences, that are still lacking in quantity. Of course Lucy and Antonio are great, as well as Ray Park in any fighting scene, but even they couldn't bring this script back from the brink. If you like good action scenes (even if there aren't that many), seeing a lot of explosions, and don't mind a terrible plot, then this movie is still only remotely for you.

1805866,2,B00007CVYT,"Jeremiah Ecks (Antonio Banderas) is a former FBI agent who is haunted by the ""supposed"" death of his wife. He remains mentally tortured even as he continues on to investigate deaths and criminals. Sever (Lucy Liu) is a Chinese government agent who is calm, calculated, and deadly. Do you recognize what's wrong here? If you've guessed already that these two characters are horribly clichd, then you're on the right track...unfortunately. Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever is basically an action film that is devoid of any originality. From the uninspiring plot to the nonstop action sequences, it's no surprise that this film was poorly received at the time of its premiere. The story itself is nothing special: a child is kidnapped, Sever blows stuff up, Ecks wants to know if his monotonous-sounding wife is still alive, more stuff blows up, the villain tries too hard to be like a REAL villain, more and more stuff blows up, blah blah blah, final confrontation, blah blah blah, happy ending, the end. The director, whose full name I won't even bother to correctly pronounce, could have at least put some effort into the plot. But hey, it's an action film, right? Who cares about the story when it's all about the big guns, car chases, and loud explosions?

Now, usually I do enjoy watching action films, as long as it keeps me awake throughout. And I will admit that sometimes I ignore the plot and just immerse myself into the awesomeness of the gunfights and explosions. The Rock and the first two Predator films can be good examples of this. But with Ballistic, it's a different story. While the film doesn't succeed in giving an intriguing story, it makes matters worse by succeeding in giving weak and tedious action. There are a number of problems involving the gunfights. None of the characters look as if their adrenaline is at a high level. The cameras are sometimes too distant from where the action is taking place. Sever is fired at multiple times and is never hit by a single bullet, resulting in a lack of a sense of jeopardy towards the character. Some of the choreography is a bit off, especially during the fight between Sever and A.J. Ross (Ray Park). And what's worse than dull action scenes? Playing loud techno music in the middle of all of this so-called pandemonium. It looks like the creators didn't realize that it has ""clich"" written all over it. But the worst part about the soundtrack that it's mostly inappropriately placed. For example, The Crystal Method's ""Name of the Game"" is played when special agents remain quiet as they try to figure out the actual location of their enemy when a smoke grenade is set off. This really ruins the suspense, which is ironic since there's no suspense whatsoever in this entire film. And speaking of music, there's a female voice that just goes ""ahhhh-ahhhh-ahhhh"" from beginning to end. I do enjoy this sort of vocal music in any type of film. However, this woman gives a poor performance: she's out of tune all the time. It's more annoying than hypnotic.

But what about the characters? Well, they're your basic archetypes: tortured hero, calm and calculated heroine, heartless villain, etc. Most of them are forgettable, since they're pretty much unlikable. And the actors? Let's just say that they don't seem to care themselves. They just say their lines as if they're reading off cue cards. Talisa Soto (as Rayne Gant) is the worst of the bunch, since she doesn't say a single line with a bit of conviction. Plus, her accent is more of a disturbance when she speaks (no offense). How did she survive the audition, anyway?

If there's anything that's good about this film, I will admit that there are two scenes that I found quite satisfying. There is a scene in which a pair of automobiles flip over and crash on the asphalt. Out of all the action sequences in this movie, this one is quite breathtaking to watch. And then, there's a scene that is set in an aquarium. It's a decent-looking environment, with the entire place being beautifully lit.

According to the Rotten Tomatoes website, Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever has a 0% rating among critics. This is considered to be the worst of the worst in the 2000's. I wouldn't consider this film to be the absolute worst of the decade, but it could very well be a runner-up. With an uninteresting plot, underwhelming action scenes, annoying music, and wooden performances, this movie isn't even worthy of a Saturday-night rental. This could be a treat for those who enjoy watching poorly-directed action films.

1805868,1,B00007CVYT,"Distancing yourself as far away from this preposterous slice of ridiculousness is kind of the only way to go here.  Unless you like you action films stupid (and uninspired) then I don't see how anyone could find this hodgepodge of redundancy anything more than mind-numbingly nauseating.  Seriously, this film is probably one of the worst films to have been made; ever.  What was Lucy Liu thinking?  What was Antonio Bandares thinking?  I can't imagine that either of them was so desperate for money that they NEEDED to do this film (wasn't Liu just coming off of the `Charlie's Angels' success and Bandares...okay never mind with Banderas; he's starred in more `bad films' than most actors with half his fame).  Anyways, I have exhausted the amount of time I allow to discuss such undeserving films.",1280793600,,800,4.932835820895522
1805869,3,B00007CVYT,"I checked the ratings content for this movie and it said it has 'strong violence', and all I can say is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-ve-seen-much-stronger-violence-than-this/dp/B0015XHP2C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I've seen much stronger violence than this</a>.  ""Ballistic"" isn't what I call a terrible movie.  Unlike ""The Mod Squad"", stuff actually happens in this film.  When there are explosives, they blow up.  When people have guns, they shoot. When cars appear, there will be chases.  From my eyes, it's an action film built on the mindless mish-mosh of pyrotechnics and bullets.  It's far from the best of mindless actions films, but it did okay.

The story is in a bit on the loopy side. In the beginning, the mother, who's played by Kitana from the ""Mortal Kombat"" movies, got to visit her son but then her husband, Robert Gant, ordered to bring his son back after she spend about five minutes with him. Just as the boy's bodyguards were to take him back, he was kidnapped by a rouge assassin codenamed Sever (Liu).  The FBI hired a former agent named Ecks (Banderas) to arrest Gant, who happens to be the director of the DIA with criminal ties, and to do so he has to find the assassin who has the son, who also carried a deadly nanomachine planted within him by his father. He didn't want to, but when they mentioned the wife (which he thought was dead but is really alive), he joined in. Ecks chased Sever around, they fought, but later they don't and eventually join forces once she told him the truth about the wife, and together they fight the unambiguous bad guy.  And boy, Robert Gant is extremely unsubtle: the guy smiles and he has that smug look on his face, all throughout the entire movie; he might as well wear a shirt that says ""I'm the villain"".

One thing I gotta give this movie credit for is that the film's shot in Vancouver and it takes place in Vancouver. Which begs the question as to why the FBI and DIA, both US security forces, are taking action outside their jurisdiction. To be fair, I only discovered this plot hole online, and there were other big questions that stabbed into my mind: Why didn't the bad guy bother to have his son shipped to his mother if he was gonna take him back at the last second? Why did Sever had to shoot a security official when she had a good opportunity to escape, especially after a hectic fight from the cops? Why did the cops arrest Ecks for apparently shooting his superior when he's nowhere near him, and why didn't the superior clear that up (who was alive at the time)? What happened to the FBI after he was arrested?  How did gun manage to shoot backwards to kill the one holding it in one scene?  Why didn't the bad guy just implant the deadly nanomachine into one of the members of his team and put him into hiding instead of risking it on his child?

It had an incredulously dumb plot, but ""Ballistic"" doesn't want to provoke anything wise.  If I wanted to see a thought-provoking action film, I would've seen ""Inception"".  The action scenes in the film weren't bad, it doesn't try to be too fancy except for the lousy scenes where it's slow-motion from one position and normal-timed on the other.  The movie did have the worst reaction to a gunshot I've seen: at one point in the film, Sever shot a bad guy in the arm, and he just dropped it on the side and nonchalantly said ""ouch""; it's funny in a way.  Dumb as it is, it's got enough explosions and gunfights to merit some kind of watchability. Too bad there weren't enough sound and fury to disguise the awful love song in the end credits.",1279756800,,3622,4.643192488262911
1805880,2,B00007CVYT,"If you can get past the fact that there are two relatively big names (i.e. Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu), and ignore the plethora of guns and explosions, what you really get is an incredibly weak plot with more contrived scenes than I could count.  It's essentially a movie as ridiculous as its title - which just happens to be the reason why I avoided this garbage for nearly a decade.

Ecks (Banderas) is a semi-retired FBI agent picked up by some kind of shadow government that also happens to be DIA, linked to Canadian officials, sort of, who kidnap female Chinese orphans - insert Lucy Liu - to create special agent assassins, or something.  Thrown into the mix is a woman married to two men, a child being held for personal ransom, and some imaginary top secret, microscopic computer hardware that can induce heart attacks or embolisms.  When there is no empathy for a woman whose child has been abducted, you know the movie is complete chaos.  Speaking of that...

The director of this trainwreck is named Kaos, a pseudonym presumably used because he feels guilty that the plot and direction of this film resembles the consistency of diarrhea.  This movie is laughably bad.  Way too little back story, far too few details for character development, there simply isn't anything developed.  And when explanations are given, they are delivered through slow-mo camera shots and three word sentences.

Aside from a couple explosions - which are completely contrived and unconvincing - there is nearly nothing redeemable about this movie.  Even the soundtrack is an irritating distraction.  Watch it if you feel like quoting the lines before the characters, predicting the outcome thirty minutes early, and yawning during the ""climactic"" final showdown.

1805881,1,B00007CVYT,"Have you ever wanted to watch a really really bad movie?  No, I mean like - have you ever REALLY wanted to watch the worst movie ever created where it may have literally been more effective to take a handycam and just have filmed a physical pile of 70 million dollars being set of fire??  Well folks, let me tell you - you have come to the right place.  Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever is literally the cinematic equivalent of visiting a sewage treatment plant and packing a swimsuit.  Not only will you want your life back afterwards, you will also feel really dirty for having experienced it.

The movie starts out harmlessly enough, until a woman who I couldn't care about if the film director mailed a certified check to house has her son taken from her car with the same reaction someone might have if say a box of Cheerios were stolen from the backseat, except that typically someone would have tried to get the box of cereal back.  The woman doesn't appear to care, and in the scene continuation we are treated to a random car parked against the curb exploding while a car in front of the car that is carrying the kidnapped child...just.  You know what - I'm not even sure I can explain how bad this movie is.  I've watched some other reviews that even attempt to step you through the plot and I still don't understand what this movie was trying to accomplish.  Pretty much all I can really even remember is that Lucy Liu looks literally like she might have if she were teaching high school trig but she has a machine gun that she is using to mow down what could be the FBI, except everyone is apparently in Canada.

I'm actually scared to try watching the ""special features"" because I'm not sure that even the film director was aware what was going on, much less that he was directing a movie.  I'm under the impression that everyone involved may very likely have all been sleepwalking at the time and someone else had an expensive camera that was used to film these unrelated people who's hobby it is to dress like they are part of a SWAT team and then someone else stole the footage and edited together a movie.  Somehow - Antonio Banderas ended up being an actor and there were lots of guns.  Everywhere - I don't think a single person in this movie didn't have a gun.  I can imagine that if you had just walked onto the ""set"" (this is Canada or something so it's likely that people just did) someone would have immediately handed you a gun and a pretend bullet-proof vest and told you to start hobbling around and watch out for fire and explosions and oh, you're going to be in the worst movie of all time.  It's also possible that half the people being filmed were actually involved in a massive gun battle just to try to escape being filmed which I'm betting worked in nobody's favor at all.  No, scratch that - I'm actually absolutely completely sure it worked in nobody's favor at all.  I did just watch this ""movie"".  It may have been a 2 hour long montage about the history of automatic rifles and ""How a Bus Explodes"", I'm not really sure at this point.

The only way I could have even imagined this ""movie"" being ""good"" (the word ""good"" probably doesn't even belong in this review but whatever) is if everyone had been given real guns as a joke in the first scene and nobody survived the actual making of the film.  Apparently, the 342 explosions were actually ""real"" but the effect would have probably been similar to having Rambo guest star on the cooking channel, because having actual fire and burning things seemed to oddly juxtaposed opposed to being in this movie.  Another review I read here on amazon invited the cast and crew to ""hang their head in shame"", which sentiment I would like to echo.  Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever succeeds in absolutely nothing except being horrifyingly hard to watch and not hate yourself at the same time.  It would probably be easier to successfully breath underwater than it would be to watch this film and feel good about it.  I'm in favor of amazon disabling the ability to vote anything above ""negative 1 star"" on this feature as having the ability to vote up to 5 stars is like having the ability to play farmville for 1,000 straight hours, because no-one should be allowed to do that.",1278028800,,4242,4.479220779220779
1805882,1,B00007CVYT,"With a title like ""Ballistic - Ecks vs. Sever"" I just had to see the film to know what it could possibly be about given that nonsensical moniker. After watching it I still don't know what it's about exactly, but do know why the film was utterly panned by the critics and public alike.

The entire movie serves as a setup for exploding vehicles, governmental interagency rivalry, gunplay, kidnapping, and uber-dangerous secret weapons. The film was made in Canada, and the low budget shows up everywhere from the special effects to the acting, and certainly in the script. Directed by ""Kaos"" (""Chaos"" is more like it, though his real name is Wych Kaosayananda) in his American big screen debut, the film centers around kidnapping and killing family members, and initially pits FBI hero Jeremiah Ecks (Banderas) against agent Sever (Liu) a rogue agent of a mystery agency that has a very confusing role in the government. Regardless, they both realize they are on the same side and turn their wrath against a murderous and traitorous common enemy, Robert Gant (Gregg Henry), finding ample reason to increase the body count at random intervals.

The plot is unfathomable, people do things for pointless reasons, and at the end of the movie nobody cares. The soundtrack is pretentious, intrusive, and annoying, the pace is ponderous (despite the explosions and gunfire), and the entire family angle is utterly unconvincing or in any way sensible. Then again what did you really expect from a movie with the stupidest title ever; a title that tells you absolutely nothing about the subject matter and should serve as a warning to anyone considering watching it.

1805884,2,B00007CVYT,"Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever (Wych Kaosayananda, 2002)

According to[...], Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever is the worst-reviewed movie of the past ten years. While I'm certainly not going to defend the movie, I have to say that, like most movies about which things like this are said, this isn't even the worst movie I've seen this week (both Bled and The Bone Snatcher were quite a bit worse than this), but ""real"" critics (i.e., the ones who get paid for doing this) never end up seeing stuff like that, so for them, this represents the bottom of the barrel. There are times when I envy them. Most recently, while I was watching Bled and The Bone Snatcher.

I'd try to give you some idea of a plot here, but there's really no reason. What this movie is really about is Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu running around and blowing things up. Why this should surprise anyone is entirely beyond me, given that both of them made their names doing exactly this sort of thing, though even Desperado had a stronger storyline to it than this does. But really, if you're going to see a movie like this for plot, story, and character development, you're probably in the wrong place. This is all about things blowing up, and as far as that goes, it does deliver. Some worthwhile fight scenes offset the incredibly corny dialogue and uninspired direction, so if that's all you're looking for, this should be right up your alley. * ",1260403200,4,1408,4.601593625498008

Later an expert (Antonio Banderas) is brought-in to find the kid and get the kidnapper. The bulk of the movie is a cat-and-mouse between these two. OK, let me explain that cat-and-mouse in this case means massive explosions, vast amounts of ammo expended, lots of cars and stuff blown-up. Lots and lots of action and explosions and shooting!

Later in the movie certain character connections are exposed and relations change, the cat-and-mouse team-up to go after the real bad-guy in the movie. Oh, add lots more action and explosions including most of a train yard getting blown-up.

So why three stars? Well, usually I really like Liu and Banderas. In this movie, both characters were really thin and hard to connect with. In fact, in the whole movie every character is thin/shallow and not likeable. Heck, even the kidnapped kid had no personality. So, if you are into characters, this ain't your movie.

1805906,1,B00007CVYT,"I can't believe that only two years after the big hit, Charlie's Angels, Lucy Liu appeared in this made-in-Canada cheapie.

The story is nonsensical and confusing.  The DVD's description says Liu is an NSA agent, but she's with the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency), sort of.

I say ""sort of,"" because the movie's DIA is not the US Pentagon's DIA, but apparently some ""shadow government"" in Canada that hires Chinese orphans (girls abandoned by their parents in China due to China's ""one child"" policy), to be ruthless assassins.  The characters in the movie talk of a ""shadow goverment"" and the film is set in Canada, with Canadian cops chasing people, so I guess they mean a Canadian ""shadow government.""

However, this ""shadow government"" is legitamate.  We know this, because they get cooperation from the police in trying to kill rogue assassin Lucy Liu.  Only, this ""shadow government"" is also evil and illegitamite, because some FBI people, linked to the Canadian police or DIA or whoever, force ex-FBI agent Antonio Banderas out of retirement to find a child that Lucy Liu kidnapped.

Confusing, no?

In the Special Features, the director says, ""In my research, I found that there really is a DIA.""  Clearly, neither he nor the writer have a clue as to what the DIA is.  It's a branch of the Pentagon primarily concerned with military intelligence.

Lucy Liu's assassin dresses in Lara Croft fashion, walking the streets of Vancouver in spandex and a cape.  In the Special Feature, Liu says she was intrigued that the assassin was a woman, because it added ""a whole other dimension"" to the role.

What other dimension?  The screen has been full of ass-kicking lady spies since The Avenger's Emma Peel, yet people still talk as if it's a new thing.

The special effects are okay but mostly the usual, with the exception of a police sniper falling onto a car roof.  Well shot.

One movie cliche that really annoys me is when you have scores of highly trained troops or snipers blasting away and hitting nothing.  Then the hero (or heroine) steps out and blasts them all away.  Liu's knocking off dozens of people and not a bullet grazes here.

Anyway, she turns out to be a good assassin who's only trying to kill the head of DIA (or whoever he is) because her kid got killed in a DIA mission gone bad.

I rented this film because it has Talisa Soto, my second-favorite Bond girl.  But as usual, her part isn't very large.  Soto fans be warned.

Anyway, the script is just awful, even the title.  Does anyone even know what an Ecks or Sever is?  They're the names of the Bandares and Liu characters, but unlike Lara Croft, they're not previously known names, so why name the movie after them?

There are a couple of good action scenes that are fun. Really, the only reason these kinds of pseudo-Hong Kong movies get made is to show off a director's technical expertise in filming overly stylized action sequences. The rest of the movie is then built around these three or four scenes.

But the director couldn't make Lucy Liu look like much of a martial artist. She comes across as so choreographed and physically incapable that it, was pricelss when Antonio Banderas delivered lines like -- ""Obviously a professional, without emotion.""

A) you have no reasonable story.
B) you don't get in fact many actions from Ms. Liu.
C) and you see the worst performance from Antonio Banderas in his career.
Sorry to say that, but it's true.  Banderas plays an ex FBI agent Ecks, whom you first find drunk, as usual, and who had a wife and kid in the past ... as usual.  And Lucy Liu is some secret agent Sever who was trained for special mission or something, as you know, and she now works alone ... well, as you know.  Anyway, Sever kidnaps a boy of the boss of some government organization DIA (Greg Henry), and the event, which should have been made with much exciting shots, is followed by many, many gunshots and explosions in Vancouver.
The film looks like a bad Hong-Kong actioner, in which no coherent story is given.  There are several surprisingly memorable shots, but they are not many, and most of all, it is painful to watch that these two leading stars, especially Banderas who seems exhaused, (and ill-used Ray Park, ""Episode I"" and ""X-Men"") look very tired and uninterested.  Even a kidnapped boy looks tired too, as if he wants to go home, home of his own.
I heard the director Wych Kaosayananda, born in Thailand, made a hit there with his previous film ""Fah,"" which led to this English-speaking film.

Ballistic fails to follow even that, which explains why the film bored the hell out of me. I'm almost hesitant to say this, but the latest straight-to-video Jean-Claude Van Damme schlock might actually be better than Ballistic, which was arguably 2002's worst film (I've never seen Rollerball).
There's something of a plot here, but I'm not entirely sure what the hell was going on. Antonio Banderas plays FBI Agent Ecks, Lucy Liu is Agent Sever, and the two of them are duking it out because they somehow have crossed paths with a wealthy man (Gregg Henry) who is determined to smuggle a small electronic device that can assassinate its intended victim via heart attack. Mixed up in it all is Talisa Soto as Banderas' supposedly dead wife, only she's not really dead. Much mayhen ensues.
Ballistic is directed by Kaos, a Thai filmmaker who apparently wanted his movies to live up to his name. This is his first American feature and he shows almost no ability in crafting an action sequence. Martial arts fights that should get the adrenaline-pumping are so stiltedly choreographed, it'll inspire either laughs or yawns. Kaos also goes overboard on the slow motion, ensuring there's never an opportunity for the fight scenes to build momentum. And this is the only film I can think of where the people involved in a car chase actually follow the speed limit!
I feel a bit sorry for the cast here, particularly Lucy Liu, whose martial arts talents are squandered here. To date, she hasn't been much of an actress, but she looks and convincingly acts tough so such a role here must have seemed like a good idea. For Banderas, this is the third film where he has trouble with mysterious women. I've heard of typecasting, but never to such a ridiculous extent.

Everything in every area of filmmaking is wrong with Ballistic: Ecks vs Sever. Even the title as Banderas and Liu are not in competition with each other.

Here's the plot...Oh, wait a minute, I can't tell you what the plot is because it doesn't exist. It just a massive load of old cobblers. And what's even worse is that the nonexistent plot is full of holes. Make sense? No didn't think so. It's not even worth watching to see what I mean.

The dialogue is the truly worst ever. At least the bad dialogue in movies such as Dolemite is eternally quotable. Ray Park's acting makes Jean Claude Van Damme and Steven Seagal on their worst day look like Laurence Olivier. The 'action' is so basic it feels like a made for video production, it lacks anything resembling sophistication and excitement.

I'm surprised Alan B. McElroy wrote this. He's done some good stuff (Wrong Turn, Spawn Animated Series) but this must have been something he wrote without much inspiration. Every writer comes up with a turkey but WHAT a turkey this is. Still, a bad script can sometimes make for a good movie if the delivery and direction has skill behind it. that ain't the case here.

As fortune would have it, it's only an hour and a half long which is one of this movies precious few saving graces.  Another huge saving grace for this ""film"" is the casting of Ray Park, an actor whose martial arts skills are quite noteworthy.  Perhaps you might not be familiar with his name or previous works, most notably of which was Darth Maul in ""Star Wars Episode I, The Phantom Menace and in the first X-Men movie as Toad.
The premise:
Quick and ""simple,"" Sever, played by Lucy Liu, is a DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency) agent who for very good reasons has decided to turn her considerable talents against her boss.  This attention is manifested through her kidnapping her ""boss's"" son.  In comes Ecks, played somewhat blandly by Antonio Banderas, who is a former FBI Special agent.  He is coerced by his former lead agent into participating in the search for Sever and the kidnapped child.
What follows from there is, as stated above, a film predicated by well worn clich and an overbearing soundtrack.  While not leaving one feeling as if they've wasted an hour and a half of their life, it does leave one wondering about Antonio Banderas' decision making process when it comes to the films he's been choosing over the last few years.

1805933,2,B00007CVYT,"I don't have very high standards for plot in action movies, so I can forgive the overall weakness of the story line.  I can forgive the sheer implausibility even of the basic premise for the film (heck, if I could swallow the premise for The Matrix, I have no right to complain about lame premises ever again).  There are two things I can't forgive in an action movie, though, and Ballistic - Ecks vs. Sever has both:
First, it prevents two very cool actors from being cool.
Antonio Banderas spends the whole film unkempt, poorly shaven, and slouching.  Antonio Banderas does all of the above very convincingly, but having seen him in Desperado (ASIN: 0800130448), The Mask of Zorro (ASIN: B00005MEV1), heck, even Spy Kids (ASIN: B00003CXWJ), I know how very well he does the suave man of action, and I just hated to see him doing his scruffy bit all the way through.
Ditto for Lucy Liu.  The thing that makes her so watchable (apart from the fact that she's unbelievably gorgeous) is the way she gives her characters strong personalities that shine through in every scene.  Not so in this film.  It seems the director wanted her to appear to be a killing machine through most of the film.  Her face is completely expressionless until near the end, and I just couldn't stand watching Lucy Liu fighting without knowing how her character was feeling.  Was she excited?  Frightened? Depressed?  There was no way to tell, because her face was just blank the whole time.  It could have been somebody else walking around in a Lucy Liu mask, for all I could see of her personality.
The second big mistake this film made is that the bad guys were just way too stupid in the action scenes.  I don't like bad guys who line up to get killed, especially if they're supposed to be some kind of super commandos.
There's one scene in the film where about 50 of the bad guys' elite assassins go after the heroes in a freight yard.  First, when they move out of cover, they do it all together in a nice line 50 abreast rather than filtering in.  Then, they clump together in small groups conveniently near to explosive charges, or run single file out in the open between rows of trains all ready for the heroes to empty their machine guns at them.
Now, I'm not what you'd call a great military tactician, but clustering in groups and running around in straight lines when there are people with machine guns and explosives nearby?  I'd hope even a Hollywood director could figure out how stupiod that is.
This one achieves depths of implausibility in action scenes not seen since Commando (ASIN: 6305364664)...  At least in Commando, though, for better or for worse, Schwarzenegger was able to do his personality thing.
I definitely recommend skipping this one in favor of a Desperado/Charlie's Angels double feature.",1052697600,6,2799,4.670061099796334

1805938,1,B00007CVYT,"Don't get me wrong, I'm all for abandoning plot for action, but on at least one of two conditions: it must be good action OR it must be a Van Damme movie. ""Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever"" is neither. As a matter of fact, it's not even up there with your average Steven Seagal flick. It has no real plot, just plot elements with one-dimensional characters reciting weak dialogue and getting into long, repetitive gunfights. I'm a die-hard fan of dumb action movies, but even this is too void for my tastes. The cast, while consisting of a few admirable talents, can't seem to keep the movie flowing and the action is trite and devoid of originality. As far as the movie scene goes, ""Ballistic"" is pure fluff. Mindless and without any direction, it is dead on the screen before the title even flashes.",1046736000,4,794,4.559440559440559

I was pleased (after seeing it on TV)to see that it wasn't quite so bad as so many people seem to think.
The plot line seems to center on a U.S. Govt. agency gone bad with a commander who's just plain criminal (out for money & power). They've stolen a prototype nanobot killing machine (the worst plot hole in the movie is that Gant wants the perfect killer but destroys the lab, taking nothing but the prototype, if it's so great he'd also want manufacturing capabilities)and used The Boss's (Gant) stepson (Ecks later finds that the kid is really his)as a carrier for the thing to get it back to America (plot hole #2, why to Canada instead of the US?)Sever is a former agent of the DIA who left when they killed her son. The only part of the movie where you can really call it Ecks vs. Sever is at the start when he's trying to arrest her, they soon find that they're really on the same side (she kidnapped the boy to keep Gant from getting the nanobot).
There are a lot of explosions and miraculous escapes (this is a movie, not reality which would have more deaths & injuries than I think were actually depicted on screen)but the basic plot line(s) of criminals stealing a weapon, an ex member taking it from them and dodging the law and the crooks all the way with the good guys (who seem kind of vicious themselves)winning in the end does work pretty well. You need to pay attention, remember that people really ARE working on such killing devices, and suspend belief just a little.
I found that the start of the movie followed by the last part, then the middle part of the movie seemed to be the best way to sort it all out. I thought that Lucy Liu and Antonio Banderas did a god job in portraying their roles.",1045180800,,1922,4.297520661157025

1805960,4,B00007CVYT,"I'd like to open my review with a prediction: in a few years' time, Ballistic: Echs vs. Sever will gain a cult following, either with viewers who appreciate ""bad cinema,"" or action junkies who love its sheer over-the-topness.  This movie was dumped on beyond belief upon its release, and it's hard to understand why.  After all, it's no worse than the other action drek Hollywood churns out.  The fact that films like ""XXX"" and ""Charlie's Angels"" can be enjoyed as mindless fun, yet Ballistic, which itself is also nothing but candy-flossed entertainment, is derided, boggles my mind.
Viewers who enjoy Hong Kong/Asian cinema (""Hard Boiled"" and ""Shiri"" especially) won't have as much trouble enjoying Ballistic as others appear to.  I've noticed the main thing people complain about in Ballistic are the unanswered questions and the sometimes outrageousness of the action sequences (i.e., Lucy Liu blasting apart a whole city and not getting a scratch).  These sort of things are common place in Hong Kong action cinema, but whereas those movies are appreciated regardless, apparently Ballistic must face tougher criticism, because it is, of course, a Hollywood movie.  How hypocritical!
Like most, I read the many negative reviews for this movie.  I figured it probably wasn't any good, and didn't plan to see it.  But then, as I kept reading all of the negative reviews, I began to wonder if Ballistic really WAS so bad.  So I rented it, just to find out.  Not expecting to enjoy the movie at all, I was surprised to find that it was much better than the ""professional"" and amateur critics would have you believe.
Ballistic: Echs vs. Sever, even though it has a terrible name, is the logical progression of action movies.  Plot, character development, realism, and explanations are chucked aside for well-filmed shoot-outs, explosions, and stunts.  Sylvester Stallone once remarked that the perfect action movie would be devoid of dialog; like the old silent films, it would use moving images and action to propel the story.  Ballistic is pretty close; it's all action, all the time.  The last half hour of the movie is the final battle itself.
Cast-wise, the actors do fairly well.  Lucy Liu has only a handful of lines, but comes off cool and deadly as the sexy assassin.  She displays a modicum of emotions, and if you check out the documentary, you'll laugh at how exuberant and giggly the real Lucy Liu is, when compared to the ice cold cube she portrays in the film.  Antonio Banderas is for once subdued, which is a shame.  I was hoping for a few laughably-bad deliveries and pronunciations, as he treated viewers to in ""Assassins.""  Kaos, the director, is straight out of John Woo's school for directing: lots of slo-mo explosions and sweeping shots.  Considering how terribly Ballistic bombed in theaters, I wonder if he'll get the chance to direct a Hollywood feature again.
All told, Ballistic is an enjoyable treat for movie fans who like their action movies the old-fashioned way: lots of gunfire, a hokey story, some explosions, actors doing their own stunts, and a healthy lack of computer graphics.  That's probably the main reason to recommend Ballistic; unlike most recent action movies that shove lame CGI down our throats (CGI which will no doubt look dated in a few years), Ballistic actually features real-life stunts which certainly placed the actors in jeopardy.",1042156800,2,3388,4.982238010657194

Anyone who does not know the main intelligence gathering arm of the United States Army should not be making a movie about intelligence services in the first place. And while you're doing your homework, check out a map of North America. Canada is a sovereign country and it would probably take a dim view of American intelligence services conducting a war in Vancouver.",1041811200,3,617,4.885714285714286

Ray Park who is my favorite actor/ martial artist had only one whihc was diappointing and wasn't his best hence the  Star Wars light sabre battle. With the name Ballistic I was expecting to see Matrix type action but the action has no purpose. Fight scences should be apart and tell a story. But there is no story here so you have violence with no purpose. The soundtrack is killer with hard techno and Curves hell above the water but the song didn't fit into the scence where Banderas and Liu are in a chase on motorcycles which looks like they are acctually riding the electric carts at the grocery store for the hanicaped cause of how slow they are going. I kindda knew this was what I was in for with this movie story but I expected the fights and action to be something not like Matrix but at least close to it, but it fails in almost all efforts.

1805963,1,B00007CVYT,"I have seen some of the reviews from viewers who think this movie is either good or not that bad.  I don't know what they were watching, or what they were on when watching it.  This movie is a mess.  I love action pictures and this one has A LOT of that, but the one thing it doesn't have is a plot that makes any sense!  You mean during the entire seven years FBI agent Banderas doesn't have or know anybody who just happened to see his supposed dead wife with his ex-buddy Gant (Clark)?  I know secret agents are supposed to stay secret, but COME ON!!  Besides wouldn't an agent check for body parts after the supposed explosion that he lost his wife in?  And all we have of Lucy Liu's reason for vengeance is a photo of her and an infant, we see no agony or anger -- couldn't they have given that to us in a flashback - her searching through the wreckage looking for her dead child and the horror of the loss?  If you get the DVD, you can learn more about what's ""supposedly"" going on by watching the documentary, but you really shouldn't have to watch another movie to explain the one you're watching.  I love Lucy Liu and Antonio Banderas, but this was just down right silly at times.  For example, Lucy Liu helps Banderas escape from local police by firing rockets at the prison bus he's handcuffed on!  Huh?  Does she belong to psychic friends, so that she knew he was going to survive despite the two rockets she fired at it and the tumble role it did and it breaking apart, not to mention it catching fire! I wish they would have just spent a little more money on dialogue, character development to make the final revenge for Sever all the more sweeter.  The end came too quick, they could have drawn it out a little longer with her talking the bad guy through his eventual death.  But no, why spend time on something like that.",1041638400,2,1837,4.28695652173913

The producers should have taken all the money they spent making this noisey movie, converted it to one dollar bills, soaked them in gas and fired them out of a big cannon. Now that would have at least been entertaining (What a ""performance art piece"" that would have made!).
  Anyway, everyone knows that Lucy Liu = Bad Movie so there should be no surprises that this film is garbage: a ""Matrix"" wannabe. Sure sure walks around in fetish gear in this and every other film she is in but she is too skinny for my taste, so that was not a plus in my book. Antonio has done some watchable films (Desperado and Zorro) but this is not one of them.
  The plot is bad, really bad but I'll give them a pass on that one since its an action film (nano-tech assasins? Ugh!!). What is really a crime is that the action scenes are so incredibly bad that it makes this film a painful experience. Roger Coreman could have done better, at least it would have been alot cheaper.

1806010,1,B00007CVYT,"For starters, why is this movie called ""Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever""? Why not simply ""Ballistic""? The overblown title is symptomatic of the movie itself. It's hard to figure out how the filmmakers managed to put in so many gunfights, explosions and chases, yet come up with so little excitement. It all adds up to zero.
What there is of a plot is nonsensical and banal. Ecks [Antonio Banderas] is a secret agent who believes his wife has been murdered by some nefarious group. He thinks his arch nemesis is another spy named Sever [Lucy Lui], but, of course, she turns out to be an ally. On and on this drivel goes, with one ridiculous plot twist after another. We stop caring which way the story goes after about thirty minutes because there is not a single character we can possibly care about.
One always wonders how any movie can wind up being this bad. Whether a film's budget is one million dollars or one hundred million, one assumes that its makers' original intention was to produce something that's at least watchable. Often, everything goes amiss, and the result is a bomb. Still, it's rare that a movie is as big a bomb as this one. Sometimes, such a movie is so bad that it's good.

Antonio ""the invincable man"" Banderas should have been killed off the first time he could not possibly have survived.  Lucy ""welcome to my secret underground lair"" Liu in tight leather was the only thing that made me keep watching.  Kaos should never make another movie ever again.  This gets my vote for the absolute worst movie I've seen all year (by the way, it's december 28th).  Even the stupid B-rated movies on late-night HBO were a step up from this garbage.  If you absolutely must watch it, do so with the sound off and make up the lines yourself - at least it will make some sense that way.",1041033600,5,856,4.483870967741935
1806012,2,B00007CVYT,"Yep, I saw all of the reviews about how bad this movie was before I purchased it but figured, what the heck, I like action films and I like Banderas so why not give it a try?  Well, hubby and I took three days to finish watching this movie.  No, nothing was wrong with our DVD player, it's just that we kept falling asleep on it.  There's nothing about the movie that kept our eyes glued to the television screen for lengthy periods.
What's good?  If you like action, there's a lot of it here.  Crashing cars, car and motorcycle chases, explosions, shoot'em ups, and lots of fighting are sprinkled liberally throughout the movie.
What's bad?  Most of the action seems mindless, and the movie plays like a wannabe movie.  (They wanted it to be something that it isn't.)  There is a plot and you can follow it, but some of the action seems overlong or present just to extend the time of the movie or maybe because they figured the action would draw in the moviegoers who would forget about all else.
With some of the fighting and clothing, I got a glimpse of the Matrix -- much lower scale mind you, but the Matrix came to mind nonetheless.  With the motorcycle chase scene, Mission Impossible II came to mind.  Again, the scenes here are nowhere near the quality of Mission Impossible, but it came to mind too.
The acting is decent but none of it will pull you in and make you really care for the story being told. This could be because of the dialog -- it was okay but the actors didn't have a whole lot to work with.
Overall, while the movie wasn't horrible I wish I'd rented it instead of buying it because it's one that I have no desire to watch again.  On a lighter note, my husband and I did have a good time laughing at the various scenes (which weren't supposed to be funny) and calling out the movies that this one copied parts from.

When it was released on DVD, I made a special trip out of my way to grab this movie. I was excited to see that Antonio and Lucy were going to square off against each other in an action film. Both of these film stars had excellent presence in previous action films (Desperado, Charlie's Angels) and I was looking forward to more of that presence. Unfortunately, both of these talented icons couldn't really save the film. I've read some of the other reviews and I must say that the bashers kinda exaggerate the films weak points. I can also agree with them by saying that it's not one that I would watch over and over. In defense of this mediocre movie is that this was Kaos's first US film and he still retained a lot of the foreign action film ways. We all know the characteristics of these movies, a 9mm hand gun capable of firing 300 bullets in one scene without the protagonist or antagonist reloading, a standoff where a character can wipe out an entire army of trained combat personnel without suffering one wound and only taking one punch and last but not least is the famous foreign action film plot of a shady protagonist either looking for revenge or redemption and getting mixed up in a far fetched, poorly written plot. I believe that when people saw the ""ECKS VS SEVER"" title, they thought 'Wow! those two are going to square off?! I gotta see this! Admit it because I was one of those people. It didn't turn out quite like that and it shouldn't have earned the name of this movie that subtitle. Bashers also said that the movie's story line was hard to follow and that there was a 30 minute flashback. If these same awesome film critics can't follow this story line, then they probably need to shut up during the movie. And as for the so called 30 minute flashback, you may have confused this movie with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Basically, 3 weak character storylines came together, rather weakly. Also you need to ask yourself 'what do you go and see action movies for?' Explosions, fight scenes, gun play and if you're lucky, scantily clad women. Ballistic had all but the last. I guess I could compare the strength of the storyline to that of Starship Troopers, incomplete. This is what I saw in the movie to wrap up this review: lots of slow mo', but not too much (John Woo) that it literally slows the pace of the movie (Mission Impossible 2), Decent fight scenes (The last is always the best), weak plot(but not as bad as Universal Soldier 2. Have any of you seen that garbage?!), nice stunts if you can suspend your disbelief a tad, and hot women. And to reiterate my previous point, the things I just listed are the exact reason why we go to see action movies! For the bashers, why don't you just curl up with your significant other and watch Chocolat if you want Oscar winning performances?",1040860800,3,2920,4.480300187617261

This had lots of thing blowing up and lots of Lucy (although overdressed I thought), so why was this so brain numbingly bad?  I believe it was the fundamental cluelessness of the writers and directors.  The idea behind this mess was so incredibly stupid as to make me do a double take when I heard it.  It seems the bad guy has developed ""the ultimate killing machine""  Why?  Because he wanted to circumvent ""The Human Factor"" a machine would not hesitate like a human would (of course a machine would not know who to kill or when without a human but never mind that).  Lucy is one of those mystical Asians who is trained in some bazaar flavor of martial art which enables her to disappear or to walk around with a machine gun and not be seen etc.  The crime here is that this moron ""Kahos"" or something, the director, thinks this hokum is serious and treats in as such with many, many tedious scenes of characters in slow motion standing in front of explosions (There are lots of explosions) for no reason.  When not blowing things up they are forced to recite page after page of mind numbing psychobable laying out this absurd history.

The cops show up in force after all the action has ended (ALA Batman, the TV series, which is much more believable).  Also Lucy Lui kidnaps a child in the beginning, we are not sure why, she just does, the little tike spends days in a cage and never seems to mind, or have to go to the bathroom or anything....perhaps he is silently thankful he is in the cage and not in the theater.

Ecks is brought back to the service by his long-time comrade (Miguel Sandoval) to investigate a serious threat in the form of a deadly rogue operative named Sever (Liu). The thing, to Ecks, about tracking down Sever is that she might hold the answer's to his wife's (Talisa Soto) mysterious death. Or is she even dead at all?? As the movie progresses, Ecks and Sever team up to take down the bad guys as well as fighting their way through a murky world of shadow agents. You see, Lucy Liu's role of Sever was originally written for a man. But the director thought it would be more interesting to cast a woman for the part--yet leave the script unchanged. The fight scenes in the film were choreographed with no flaws whatsoever, especially the scene when Lucy Liu was beating those cops senseless with those retractable metal rods of hers. To me, she's like a Charlie's Angel without that faceless, intercom-speaking Charlie (I wouldn't be surprised at all if they didn't show his face again in ""Charlie's Angels 2"", but that's another story). But anyway, in conclusion, this film has it all! Great performances from Banderas and Liu, a stellar supporting cast including Gregg Henry (""Payback"") and Ray Park (""Star Wars: Episode I--The Phantom Menace"", ""X-Men"", upcoming ""X-Men 2""), and action after action after action all the way from explosive start to explosive finish! ""Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever"" is the best action film that I've seen since Banderas and Liu were teamed up for the first time in the comedy, ""Play It To the Bone""! I can't wait for the DVD release of ""Ballistic""!",1035417600,2,2075,4.914529914529915
1806025,1,B00007CVYT,"I love Lucy Liu.  I like Antonio Banderas.  I love action movies.  I hate movies that have completely unrealistic explosions and obviously coreographed stunts/car crashes.  This movie was full of both - cars that are blown by McVeigh size explosions straight up in the air, simply by being shot at; two cars that simultaneously barrel roll after running into a wrecked truck; people unhurt by being engulfed in flaming explosions; etc.
Add to this general [poo-iness], a dismal story.  It was awful, predictable, cookie cutter, plain, unimaginative, sophmoric, [dumb], [word], and pukey.  Even the premise of the movie, a microscopic, injectible, and remote controlled death micro-machine (which is a pretty cool element) was not fleshed out at all.  Here you go folks, a death machine.  Plot element.  We stole it, and put it under the skin of the main villains child to smuggle it out of the country.  No explanation of how it was stolen, why it was stolen, how it was built, who built it, why it was built, how it works, who wants it, how to inject it, how to get it out -- nothing. Period.  Anyways, this thing unexplainably will kill whoever it is injected into within a certain time, or it can kill that person by remote control.  Hey, I see I'm rambling....sorry.
I just want to reiterate, if you love Lucy Liu, go rent ""Payback,"" she's great in that, and save yourself the eight bucks for this stinker.",1034294400,,1410,4.757201646090535
1806026,1,B00007CVYT,"I was so psyched to watch this film after seeing the trailers.  Finally a film that stars Lucy Liu in the lead role.  And oh, how I *enjoyed* her 5 lines in the movie.  <major sarcasm here people>  There was a lot of, as my friend says, slow-motion hair tossing.
The story is about a rogue agent Sever who has made off with a microdevice that kills at the press of a button.  Ecks is another government agent brought in on the case to find Sever and retrieve this device.  They soon realize their real enemy isn't one another, but rather Sever's old boss.  Bang bang, boom boom.  You can guess the ending.
I predicted the ending by watching the trailer.  With that piece of the suspense missing, watching the film became a bit tedious.  Sure there were lots of explosions and high-tech devices, but in the end you ask yourself ""Wasn't that unnecessary?""  Even gratuitous I might say.  It's also hard to believe how, super-spy or no super-spy, Sever manages to obtain the arsenal of a small army and a BMW X5?  (I suppose on her super-salary.)
I'm SO disappointed with this film!  Watching it will only give the producers the misguided notion that this is acceptable ....  So don't.
LEAP rating (each out of 5):
============================
L (Language) - 1.5 (Lucy Liu has like 5 lines in the whole film, Banderas mumbles.  It's a miracle they can have a coherent conversation.)
E (Erotica) - 0 (n/a)
A (Action) - 4 (Lots of explosions.)
P (Plot) - 1 (A seventh grader can write you a better story.)",1033430400,4,1499,4.537313432835821
1806027,1,B00007CVYT,"What happened in this movie is very simple, the director and producer decided the create a movie with as many explosions and gun shots as possible.  They wanted in to star Lucy Liu and Antonio Banderas.  They simply decided that with all 4 of these things going for it, no one would miss a plot.",1033344000,,295,4.345454545454546
1806039,2,B00007CVYT,"I went to see this with a friend and when we got to the ticket window, I asked the kid working if Ballistic had a plot.  He said, ""No, not really.""  I said, ""Excellent, we'll take 2 tickets!""
I generally am not a fan of movies without a plot, particularly action movies without plots, but since I knew going in that this move did not have one, I wasn't disappointed.
I noticed this movie borrows, for lack of a better word, from several other movies.  The Matrix influence is obvious, with Lucy Liu's character doing cartwheels like she was Neo and techno rock playing in every action sequence.  Also, we have the origami artwork, courtesy of the movie Bladerunner.  And a very famous sequence was lifted from the Orson Welles movie the Lady from Shanghai, where the lovers meet in the aquarium.
What the movie lacks in originality it more than makes up for by the sheer number of things that blow up.  I mean, the only way this movie could've been better is if the projection room blew up after we left.",1033344000,,1004,4.459016393442623

I mean rarely is the day that I'll go online to pan a movie, but after sitting through that last night... Look it's a basically a BAD late-night showtime/cinemax film, with two credible stars (I went to see it for Lucy as well). I watch a lot of garbage/crap, all the time in fact, that was just so bad. I'm really not going to go into it, since its already been said, but it's the most cliche filled, awful, completely non-sensible, confusing movie I think I have ever seen in at the theatres.",1033257600,,576,4.293577981651376
1806041,2,B00007CVYT,"""Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever"" has been saddled with not only one of the worst movie titles in recent memory, but one of the worst screenplays as well.  The film's third-rate espionage plot makes no sense at all and serves basically as a [weak] excuse for endless explosions, shootouts and double-flipping car chases, which have become the standard accoutrements for virtually every action picture since ""Bullitt"" in 1968.
The problem with ""Ballistic"" is that the viewer can never tell who is doing what to whom or why - and we never care.  The film is really all about style anyway.  How else to account for the rather ludicrous image of Lucy Liu - looking more like a fashion model out on a shoot than a trained killer doing the shooting herself  - strolling in elegant slow motion through the streets of Vancouver, wiping out what seems to be an entire hit squad with a combination of superhuman marksmanship and Matrix-like kickboxing moves?  With her ankle-length designer coat and her icy-cool demeanor, she looks like Calvin Klein's idea of what the well-dressed assassin should be wearing this season.  It's enough to reduce the whole enterprise to the level of comic absurdity - and, indeed, I often found myself laughing out loud at many of the ostensibly serious shenanigans occurring in the film.  The flashbacks, which are obviously intended to clarify the characters' relationships, are so poorly done that they actually end up making the whole story more muddled and confusing. (And, although the child-kidnapping scenario is never as offensive in this film as it is in ""Trapped,"" one can still question the propriety of filmmakers running to this theme with the kind of frequency they seem to have been doing of late).
Antonio Banderas makes up the other half of the film's title (he is Ecks, she Sever), and one only wonders what he could have been thinking about when he signed on to co-star in this particular project.  ""Ballistic"" is utterly dispensable moviemaking:  here today, forgotten tomorrow, a film utterly without distinction, conviction or purpose.",1033171200,,2075,5.008720930232558
1806042,1,B00007CVYT,"I figured it couldn't be THAT bad. It has Lucy Liu for chrissakes. Oh, how wrong I was. First of all, the whole plot revolves around things that aren't explained very well, like, why the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency, I assume) is in Vancouver, why the FBI is in Vancouver (instead of the CIA, which is for foreign intelligence), why, if agent Sever is trying to ""protect"" this kid, does she go into a crowded mall for apparently no reason other than to sip some Starbucks? A lot of other questions crop up and there are, frankly, no good answers.
The only thing that was good about my movie-watching experience is that I laughed pretty hard through it. I guess if you're a fan of cheesy movies, this one comes close to winning this year's award for cheesiest. If you're a fan of decent-to-good movies, don't bother watching. If you're a Lucy Liu fan, her part is small, and she doesn't show anything off. If you're a martial arts fan, this movie seems promising, but it fails to deliver -- even with Lucy Liu as a badass killer AND Ray Park (Darth Maul) in a battle ""to the death"". Their fight is lame and ends with a whimper.",1033084800,,1130,4.4375
1806043,3,B00007CVYT,"... I went to watch the first showing available.  I arrived at the movies 30 minutes early...to make sure to recieve the absolute best seats.
Believe me....it wasn't worth all that trouble.  Don't get me wrong...it was a pretty good movie, but it was not anything spectacular to me.  It is probably worth watching once in theatres, kinda like Triple XXX.  There was plenty of action in this movie, and a large amount of romance, and drama, but the way this movie was put together...was not right.  There was an abundance of action...explotions...fighting...shooting...and then the movie would somewhat hit a dead spot.  And the dead spot would last 30 minutes.  And, then...BOOM...more and more action.  Then a dead spot.  This movie was good, but it could have been either the writing or the directing,....but It was almost an insult to Mr. Banderas...and his fine work.
Overall...I give this movie....a 6 out of a 10......10 being lord of the rings quality...and 1 being...Master of Disguise...",1032912000,,996,5.024390243902439
1806044,5,B00007CVYT,"I LOVED this movie.  For all those who trashed it saying that it was shallow, Loud, lacking in dialogue, I beg to differ.  And don't listen to them.  Go watch it.
First of all, this is an action pack movie, what did you expect it to be, ballet dancing, classical music with Shakespear lines?  The plot is good enough to keep you interested.  The fighting sequences, especially those by Sever (Lucy Liu) were incredibly well done.  I usually don't like explosions and things of that nature but even the explosions in this movie were quite awesome to watch.  And Ecks (Antonio Banderas) is supposed to look all worn out in this picture, I have no clue what the critics wanted him to look like.
Lucy Liu rocks in this movie.  She kicked some major [rump] in here and she did most of her own fighting which made the film even better, and all the while with her hair down, now how awesome is that!  And hello, not enough dialouge? Um, she is an assassin after all, and when was the last time you knew of an assassin who blabbered their way through the entire movie.
I am definitely getting the DVD when it comes out.  Heck, I'm even getting the soundtrack and I'm hoping, no, I want a sequel to this movie.  So, I say go out there and enjoy Ballistic: Ecks vs Sever in the theater.",1032912000,3,1276,4.341772151898734
1806045,2,B00007CVYT,"First of all let me just start out by saying ""O-MI-GOSH!"". I can't believe how bad it was! A monotonous excuse for a motion picture! Where's the plot? Where's anything? ...are among the questions you'll be asking yourself as you bore yourself to death by keeping your eyes open. I've got to admit, the only reason I went to watch it was for Lucy Liu. Lucy Liu and that's it. She's the reason I gave this film an extra star. It's really not even worth any star.

  Word has been going around about the creation of a new elimination device. Infinitesimal, it lies inactive within its sufferer until triggered and then destroys immediately, leaving no mark whatsoever. In the hysterical race to gain this device, only two rivals, have the talent to succeed. One of them is an agent (LUCY LIU). She's trained to be the perfect weapon. The other is a gritty previous FBI man huntsman Jeremiah Ecks (ANTONIO BANDERAS). In the violent rivalry for this lethal reward there can only be one winner.

  In short it's dull, depressing, and dreary! Too boring to tell! Simply un-irresistible, the great un-expectation! Take any phrase you want but understand that it's definitely not worth it! Not on this earth!",1032825600,2,1199,4.740384615384615

7975053,2,B00007CVYT,"Not sure why this is rated R. No Nudity & though there is non stop violence it's not gory or over the top in any way other than the sheer volume of people that are gunned down. Banderas is al little hard to understand at times & Liu is deadpan through out. Besides the massive body count, the most objectionable thing about this was the music. Wailing through out  (sounds like something you might hear in India like sarangi / Dilruba but with a female voice) was pretty distracting as there was alot of it. The plot was thin. The movie pretty much revolved around shooting people & blowing things up. When Lui was fighting it was a treat, but  sadly she didn't have that many scenes with hand to hand combat.
