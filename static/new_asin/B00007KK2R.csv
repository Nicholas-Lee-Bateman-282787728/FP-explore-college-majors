1817620,5,B00007KK2R,"Nightmare Castle, originally released in 1965, stars Barbara Steele, the leading ""scream queen"" of the 60's. She starred in countless of horror films through the 60's. With her good looks, sex appeal and mystery, she was perfect in movies dealing with the supernatural and the macabre. This film I first saw in Macabre Theatre, a monster movie showcase in a lesser known station KDOCTV here in Southern California and it's now on cable channel KHIZ. The hosts were Butch Patrick (Eddie Munster from the 60's show The Munsters) and Ivonna Cadaver, a younger Elvira look-a-like. This film does have camp or cult classic value because so much of this material is not considered frightening today. In today's horror movie scene, blood, gore, excessive violence and a scary soundtrack is what does it for today's audiences. But for it's time in 1965 this weird movie must have scared audiences or at least creeped them out. Although it does not reach the heights of horror that Dawn Of The Dead did later in the 60's, Nightmare Castle is chilling, Gothic and genuinely haunting.
The owner of a large castle, a scientist, is happily married to his beautiful wife (Barbara Steele). But while he is away, she engages in an affair with the gardener. When the scientist husband discovers their relationship, he becomes insanely jealous. Unleashing his fury and revenge, he tortures them with electric shock. These scenes are graphic, intense and disturbing, even for a 1965 film. I was very surprised by it. The torture is enough to kill the lovers. Years later, the scientist marries a beautiful replica of his wife (Barbara Steele again) She begins to be haunted by an evil presence in the castle. It becomes so bad that a therapist is hired to help her with what they think is psychological problems. The therapist, however, discovers that the castle is haunted. Guess by who ? The dead lovers that were killed years ago by the jealous husband! Eventually, there is a showdown between the ghosts, the scientist husband, the look-alike wife and the therapist, whom we are lead to believe is her new love interest. After many frightening confrontations, the castle burns down and our heroine Barbara Steele makes it out alive with her therapist boyfriend. This is a truly great film, despite its obscurity and its camp value. For a black and white film, it's visually impressive. The music as one review mentioned, is nothing dissonant or typical of horror movie soundtracks. It's subtle, it's romantic, making use of a lot of piano (Barbara Steele plays the piano in this movie). A must have for fans of Miss Steele or classic horror films.",1083801600,,2632,4.903587443946188
1817621,5,B00007KK2R,I lovee this movie so much from the opening scene to the credits. Starring legendary horror queen Barbara Steele this movie is quite a laugh with more over acting bad special effects and tacky sets this movie is a B-Movie in the best use of the term but that makes it a classic truly a cult classic,1077494400,,298,4.245614035087719
1817622,5,B00007KK2R,"Another Spaghetti horror that helped propel the stunning Barbara Steele to the top as Queen of Horror films.  Basically, a trite and routine Italian horror romp, that largely benefits from Steele powerful presence.  She has a duo role as a wife cheating on her scientist husband and her cousin.  Does she not know it's dangerous to cheat on mad scientist hubbies?  He is working with electrical impulses in human blood that cause murder victims to rise up from the grave to seek vengeance.  Well, anyone worth their popcorn can see where this one will go....Directed and written by Mario Cairano.
Face it, at this price it is a steal for Steele groupies!",1067904000,3,654,4.803571428571429
1817623,3,B00007KK2R,Print was acceptable with 20 min. additional footage missing from previus versions. I've seen far worse prints. Give it a chance!,1046908800,,129,5.190476190476191
1817624,5,B00007KK2R,"I can't say that I'm not a little disappointed that cheapo Retromedia released this and not Synapse. The print isn't nearly as good as it could've been with Synapse. However, I still give it 5 stars because it's the best print of this film I've seen yet. It's watchable and the music score is good. It's 100 min. which is longer than what's previously been available. And the storyline is more twisted than I remembered. I'm a Steele fan so I have to be more forgiving because I consider this a real collector's item. So what we have here is ""The Faceless Monster"" version of ""Amanti D'Oltretomba"" (AKA ""Nightmare Castle""). Just not the best print. The dubbing isn't great either but I don't care. I'm just glad to have it at all.",1046822400,,730,4.537878787878788

7977384,4,B00007KK2R,"'Nightmare Castle' is one of those films that I saw at a young age. It has haunted me until now as I never knew the title of this film but, remembered it's unforgettable finale! There are several releases of this great fright flick and it might pay off to take your time and find out which one it best. The one I'm reviewing has a poor transfer but, it is completely watch-able. The film start off with some creepy organ music in an eerrie old castle full of atmosphere. This is a ghost story dealing with betrayal and revenge. This lost black and white gem should be completely restored as, it is a true horror film. I found this version with the color cover of two people in shackles included with two other horror films on one DVD disc for $6.00! so, it's hard to complain. I would double dip in a heartbeat for a restored version! Check this one out horror fans!",1203984000,,866,4.319018404907975
7977385,2,B00007KK2R,"This version claims to be digitally remastered, but it doesn't look like it to me.  I actually prefer the Alpha Video version, the print quality isn't as dark and indistinct.  Nightmare Castle is a great horror film, but so far nobody has really done it justice.  How about a remastered boxed set of all Barbara's horror films? -  now that really would be something!",1199145600,2,366,4.671875
7977386,3,B00007KK2R,OK I DON'T THE OTHERS DVD  OF THIS MOVIE  IT SEEMS THEY ARE 3  BUT THIS ONE IS NOT THE INTEGRAL VERSION  ONLY  81 MN  AND NOT 101  MN AS INDICATED  SO I DON T KNOW  WHAT IS THE GOOD DVD  IF SOMONE COULD TELL ME  THANK YOU VERY MUCH,1168819200,2,231,3.42
7977387,5,B00007KK2R,"This horror film is distinguished with a rather intriguing and complex plot raising it far above the routine and mundane Italian horror film genre output of the 60s. Staring the exceptionally exquisite and alluring British born beauty Barbara Steele this film is very stylish and has vividly haunting atmosphere thanks in part to Enzo Barboni's black and white cinematography and Ennio Morricone's score. In a film full of images of torture, death, lunacy and other bizarre goings on for the sake of avarice how could one go wrong indeed especially with Miss Steele in the cast? This is an effectively well crafted bit of horror.",1163635200,,629,5.0
7977388,5,B00007KK2R,"I've been looking high and low for an uncut version of this movie and Retro Media has done a bang-up job of restoring it.  The transfer is clear, the sound quality is top-natch and Barbara does her own dub! ( insert pathetic squeal of joy ) The still gallery was a nice bonus too.  Retro Media, you are truly gods among men.  Keep up the good work.  So, if you're a gothic Italian horror/Barbara Steele buff, then this is a sound investment.",1146787200,6,441,4.341463414634147
7977389,3,B00007KK2R,"I have to say, I wasn't all that impressed with Nightmare Castle (1965).  Perhaps the problem lies within the presentation.  Obviously the film has fallen into the public domain, meaning no one owns the rights, and, subsequently anyone can put it out there for sale.  That's why there are at least six different DVD releases.  The one I viewed, released by Alpha Video (it has a colorful picture of a man and woman shackled to the dungeon wall) runs approximately 82 minutes, while The Internet Movie Database lists versions that run 91 minutes, and even 101 minutes.  Would have those ten or twenty extra minutes have made the difference between being a so-so film and a great one?  Who knows?  Co-written and directed by Mario Caiano (Ulysses Against the Son of Hercules, Train for Durango), Nightmare Castle actually goes by quite a few names including The Faceless Monster, Night of the Doomed, Lovers Beyond the Tomb, Lovers from Beyond the Tomb, Orgasmo, and then the original Italian title Gil Amanti d'oltretomba.  Starring in the movie is Barbara `I once worked with Fellini!' Steele (Black Sunday, The Pit and the Pendulum), along with Paul Muller (Barbed Wire Dolls), Helga Lin (Agent 077 - Mission Bloody Mary), Rik Battaglia (Shoot, Gringo... Shoot!), and Laurence Clift in his only on screen appearance.

The story begins pretty well, with some really creepy organ music, followed by the opening credits.  After this we see a couple Stephen (Muller) and Muriel (Steele) Aerosmith (rock on!)...er, wait, it's Arrowsmith...he's a scientist, and she's, as far as I can tell, a boozehound (she'll later add trollop to her repertoire).  Anyway, the two don't seem to get along too well, punctuated by what has to be the most awkward onscreen kiss I've ever seen (their lips don't actually touch so much as they mash their faces together), and we learn Stephen is preparing to leave for a conference or something, which he does, thus leaving his wife in the amorous arms of David (Battaglia), the strapping young stable hand...actually, he's really not that young, more like middle age, but he's a hell of a lot younger than Stephen.  The two pitch their smoochy smoochy woo tent in the greenhouse, only to be caught by Stephen, as he really didn't leave at all (the sneak), and thus begins the whippings, and various other forms of tortuous punishment (Stephen is vindictive, if nothing else).  Muriel and David do end up dying (sort of) for their transgressions, and normally the handsome estate and family fortune, which was all in Muriel's name, would go to Stephen, but because of her underlying hatred towards her husband, Muriel had fortuitously changed her will prior her demise, leaving everything to her up until recently institutionalized stepsister Jenny, who happens to look exactly like Muriel, the only difference being Jenny has blonde hair (Steele plays a dual role, donning a blonde wig to play the part of Jenny).  Stephen plans now include marrying Jenny, preying on her delicate mental state, driving her back to the asylum, and assuming control of the family fortune...that is to say unless Muriel has anything to say about it...and she does...the vengeful little minx (I should say dead minx)...

Creaky doors, darkened crypts, dungeons, laboratories, hypodermic needles, candelabras, transfusions, whippings, electrocutions, bloodcurdling screams, acid drips, dead bodies...this film would seem to have it all...so why was I kinda down on it?  Perhaps it was its excessively talky, painfully expository nature.  Criminey...this is one of the more verbose movies I've seen in awhile.  I don't mind a lot of communication if there's something to say, but for cripes sakes this is supposed to be a horror film...hit me with the scary visuals and some tension.  Don't bore me to tears telling me what you're going to do (in great detail) prior to actually doing it...to be fair, the dialog was dubbed over, and poorly so...perhaps the original dialog with subtitles would have gone down better, but whatever....actually the first 20 minutes contained a whole lot of material, but then things slowed down, only picking up again within the last 15 minutes.  There are a lot of things to like about this film, the main thing being Ms. Steele herself.  She's very attractive, having a most distinctive appearance fitting ever so well within the genre, especially in term of her large, saucer-like, expressive peepers.  She did pretty well here, presenting two, separate characters in Muriel, the saucy, strong-willed, sexy philanderer, and Jenny, the malleable, weak-willed bubblehead with the fractured psyche.  As for the rest of the cast, they did so-so, the only other standout being the hammy (on rye bread, please) Muller as the wormy Stephen, who, incidentally, looks as if he could be a distant relative to Don Knotts.  He really wasn't all that frightening as a villain type, but he was awfully sleazy, getting it on not only with the housekeeper, but also hooking up with his recently departed wife's stepsister.  Part of his masterful plan involved inviting Jenny's therapist Dr. Derek Joyce (Clift) from the asylum to stay at the castle, which I didn't quite understand, but, apparently it was important to the plot that he be around, as to be the sane half of our protagonist duo.  I did like the set pieces, along with the exteriors, as they really helped set the moody, gothic tones of the story, along with the creepy organ music.  I did not like the piano music, though...it wasn't so much the piano music itself (which was pretty pedestrian), but the fact the same bit of music was used like 20 times...talk about monotonous.  If you're a Steele fan, then you'll feel compelled to check this out, but if you're a casual viewer, you might want to start with Black Sunday (1960), an infinitely better film, and a lot more fun.  If you're interested in this film, pay attention to the studio releasing the film, something which the Amazon website does list.  If it says Gotham Distribution (apparently another name for Alpha Video), you might want to keep on going, as it is the extremely truncated version of the movie (Amazon mixes the reviews for all the different versions together, often confusing the hell out of the matter).  My favorite scene involved Stephen hotwiring a bath for Dr. Joyce, and then things going not quite as planned...

As I mentioned prior, the version I have is the Alpha Video DVD release, and features DVD cover artwork consisting of a brutalized couple shackled to a wall.  The fullscreen picture on this DVD looks pretty poor, feeling washed out, murky, and even a bit mushy, it that makes sense.  Also evident is wear and tear, artificing, and even a missing frame or two.  I own a number of Alpha Video releases and I swear they actually go out of their way to find the crummiest public domain prints for their DVD releases.  The audio, however, is surprisingly clear and loud.  There aren't really any extras (what would you expect for the price?) except for perhaps a rough looking trailer for the film, along with a video catalog where you can scroll through the covers of about 100 Alpha DVD releases.

He has no idea that Muriel's been getting real familiar with David the gardener. One evening, he catches them getting busy in the greenhouse and goes ballistic! He takes the two down to his private dungeon, chains them up, tortures them, then electrocutes them together! Well, Muriel has an identical twin step-sister named Jenny (Babs again) who stands to inherit all of Muriel's vast fortune. So, hubby tracks her down and marries her! This doesn't sit well with his house-keeper / partner in crime, Solange. She never figured on more competition! Not to worry, Stephen plans on driving Jenny crazy, so she can be declared incompetant, therefore forfeiting her right to her sister's land and money. All goes well, until Jenny begins hearing Muriel's ghost laughing and telling her to do strange things. Soon, Muriel appears with David's ghost in order to exact their grizzly vengeance. Ms. Steele looks really creepy! NIGHTMARE CASTLE allows her to be a truly evil presence, full of remorseless hate and malice! Highly recommended...",1111968000,4,1149,5.149732620320855
