8702383,3,B00TOGGDUW,"George Kilner (Guy Edmonds) is bipolar manic depressive, and schizophrenic. His mother (Penny Day) and her mother also suffered from mental illness. In addition, George struggles with being sexual abused as a child. He willingly signs away his rights to enter Bedlam, an experimental mental institute which includes punishment, torture, and sadistic guards. George questions his doctor's (Peter McAllum) techniques as no one ever leaves the institution. He befriends an actress Sofia (Cassandra Swaby) and ""Cutter"" (Gary Boulter) also inmates.

The film was the usual people experimented upon and tortured in the asylum. I kept waiting for the characters to break out of their mode, but I found that the film fell into a bit of a rut. Okay as a rental.

Over the years, Ive grown almost bored with horror movies about asylums and hospitals.  This is primarily because there are SO MANY of them on the market now.  Granted, these are great locations in which to set a horror filmbut theres an over-saturation point that should not be passed, and this one was reached a long time ago.  So when the fine folks at After Dark sent the press release for BEDLAM, I was very skeptical.  Could they actually find a way to make an asylum scary again?  I decided to give it a shot, just in case.

As the credits rolled, I sat for a few moments and pondered on what I had just seen.  Was the movie scary?  Not really.  But was it entertaining?  Yes, I have to say so for the most part.  Its not what I was expecting, but I did enjoy it overall nonetheless.

I love the cover art from the DVD.  The image doesnt have much to do with the film itself, but it definitely does its job and sparks interest.  Thankfully, its not too far from events in the movie, so its not terribly misleading.  I cant stand it when a movie poster or media cover art has nothing to do with the film its promoting.

BEDLAM is shot well and looks good from a production standpoint.  The location chosen for the asylum is perfect, a building filled with tight corridors, dark recesses, and cramped quarters.  Likewise, the setting feels very aged, which fits perfectly with the theme of the story.

The acting is very good, with Guy Edmonds heading up a great cast.  Edmonds gives a believable performance as George, the man who inherited madness from his mother.  Supporting him are John Boxer and Greg Hatton, who portray the two orderlies who torments George behind closed doors, as well as Gary Boulter and Cassandra Swaby, who play Georges fellow inmates.  The whole cast does a great job with their roles.

The storyline in BEDLAM is interesting and riveting, however it pretty much as no horror value at all.  I would classify this more as a drama (maybe a thriller) but not a horror film.  Im not saying this is a bad thing at all; but if you watch this movie, you need to know what to expect.

BEDLAM is a win for me, and I do recommend it.  The film is a gripping trek into a madness-filled mind, and it will take you on a journey you won't forget.  The film is available now, so give it a look.",1429660800,4,2387,4.33710407239819
8702385,3,B00TOGGDUW,"I'm conflicted about this film. There are many good points but unfortunately some areas that are not so good. To me, it seemed as it didn't quite know what it wanted to be and commit to it. Just when I started taking the plot seriously there would be something that pulled me back to (oh, OK, it's like this). Meaning it was somewhat of a parody or mockumentary there is  even some ""found footage "".

It makes fun of while also sympathizing with the way people that were deemed crazy in the 1960s were treated while in state asylums. There are dreamlike sequences that in my opinion are the bright spots of the film. (Guy Edmonds)  plays our main character George Kilner,who voluntarily commits himself into the asylum without knowing the horrors that await him. Edmond's acting is another bright spot. He really takes us were the role takes him.

(Gary Boulter) as Cutter was believeable as well. There is also some sketchy acting, I won't hurt feelings by saying the main, mood killer! Because you can be into a movie and a wooden performance can take you right back out of it. I found it entertaining and certainly wasn't bored because it certainly has its clever moments and points. There was a lot of violence and torture that was effective and disturbing but the gore effects were pretty weak. There are scenes of rape and also mentions and recountings of child sexual molestation.

George's perverted uncle whom we see in flashbacks is very creepy and disturbing but then again anything to do with child molestation skeeves me out. If you like any kind of films dealing with asylums or mental illness this will be right up your  alley .As a film about the horrors of the treatment of mentally ill patients, it works but as a slasher not so much.

I think the director (Chew Barker) has a bright future ahead of him and for his first film did an admirable job!",1429056000,3,1866,4.585585585585585
