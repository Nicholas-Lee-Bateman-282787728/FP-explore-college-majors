7867349,5,6304304153,"Season 2 of the X Files had perhaps one of the best cliffhangers in the series.  That is Agent Scully's abduction.  ASCENTION starts with a fatigued Agent Mulder at his wits end after dealing with Duane Berry (Watch the episode DUANE BERRY for more on this episode, it can help) who as it turns out has taken Agent Scully away with him.  Berry believes that if he can offer a different person to his alien abductors, the aliens won't bother him anymore.  Mulder tries his hardest but he is unable to rescue his partner in time and she dissapears, thanks largly to an ""allie's"" meddling.
I have never come away from a TV episode with such a worn out and unhappy feel.  Mulder's partner and best friend is missing with no trace, Mulders new partner Krycheck has vanished (guess why), none of his friends are willing or able to help him and the little help that Skinner can offer can't heal the wounds of what has happened.
This episode has a very unpleasant ending, but that is also what helps make this one so good and it is VERY important to see this episode to link it to the show's main plot line.
ONE BREATH is part 2 of ASCENTION where Mulder, after month's of searching finds out that Scully has mysteriously been delivered to a hospital in exetreme condition and with no trace of where she's been.  Mulder is furious to find out where she has been but nobody can give him an answer.  On top of that Scully's living will states that if she ever ends up in this state she wants her life support cut off.  With no hope in sight of his friend recovering, nor finding those responsible for the crime, Mulder is ready to throw in the towel and quit the FBI.
While it is not hard to figure out the outcome of this episode it is a great follow up to ASCENTION and one of the series better episodes.",983836800,6,1796,4.340298507462687
