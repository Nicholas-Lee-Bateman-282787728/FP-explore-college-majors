3084965,2,B00128VA6C,"""Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium"", the new film directed by Zach Helm (who wrote ""Stranger Than Fiction""), starring Dustin Hoffman, Natalie Portman and Justin Batemen, wants to be the next ""Willy Wonka"" but it has too little conflict, too little narrative and, most importantly, too little magic to make it the next Family classic.

Mr. Magorium (Dustin Hoffman sporting a haircut that looks like he was just riding a motorcycle and gelled into place and a strange lisp which is meant to make him seem childlike) is the owner of a strange and wonderful toy store in the middle of Manhattan. As soon as he opens the store everyday, the toys come to life and children stop by to play with the creatures all day every day. His store manager, Molly Mahoney (Natalie Portman) was once a promising concert pianist, but can not find the last notes to complete her first concerto. All day, every day, her fingers play the notes on an imaginary keyboard until she comes to the end and can no longer play the remainder. One day, Mr. Magorium announces he is leaving, and will leave the store to Molly. Because of this, he hires an accountant, Weston (Justin Bateman) to come in and figure out what the store is worth and to set the accounts in order. The narrator of the film, a young boy named Eric (Zach Mills) hangs around all day and observes everything, narrating the film much like a picture book, complete with chapters. And he has a hat collection, which provide an endless supply of unusual chapeaus for his head.

""Mr. Magorium"" tells a fairly simple story with relatively few characters. Each of these characters is awkward and uncomfortable with their place in the world, but Magorium is the only one who seems to embrace it. Hoffman's Magorium is a strange fellow who has a machine that dresses him in the morning, a zebra in his apartment, and a strange, wonderful store. He walks around with a wide-eyed innocence, despite claiming to be over one hundred years old. Hoffman certainly seems to be having fun playing the eccentric, but the performance just doesn't go far enough. There is little depth to the character. He owns this strange and wonderful shop and wants to leave it to Molly after he leaves, in a way, to help her. That's it. Despite some scenes of Magorium playing  with the kids in his shop, there are no other layers to his character. Everything else is mentioned in passing; he s over 100 years old, the reason he is leaving, etc. Just hearing these wild statements isn't really enough to make him strange and wonderful.

Also, because the film is rated `G', there is no possibility of making him even the slightest bit dark. In ""Willy Wonka"" and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", both Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp made it clear, in subtle and unsubtle ways, Wonka doesn't really like kids. He then puts the bad kids through their paces, trying to find out who should take over his empire. In just about any great Family film, there is some sort of darkness, some sort of menace. In ""Magorium"", the only darkness comes when the store seems to miss Magorium's presence. Because he isn't around, everything turns black and gray, waiting for someone to reawaken the spirit and flavor of the magic it once knew.

But this isn't enough to provide anything but a mildly pleasant diversion.

Molly appears to be that person, the person who will take over the shop. Magorium's trusted manager, she knows many of the secrets and loves working there, meeting all of the (remarkably) well-behaved children. But when Magorium first mentions he will be leaving, and why, she is unsettled. What will happen to her career as a composer? What happened to the promise of her performances as a pianist? She still has hope, because she reflexively plays the piano with her hand all day. But taking over the store seems like it will definitely close the chapter on one part of her life.

Natalie Portman is a good choice for this role because she has a wide-eyed innocence about her that lending itself well to the character. But she is just kind of bland. She loves working for Magorium and loves the store. There is a slight amount of conflict when the accountant (Bateman) shows up. See, he doesn't believe in the store and this irks her to no end. But because the film is rated `G', there isn't even any possibility of a romantic relationship between them.

Strangely, Eric and Weston become friends. Eric is a strange, lonely kid who finds solace at Magorium's store. He has no friends, and his mother worries about him, but he enjoys lending a hand. So what if he sees some kids playing with Lincoln Logs and the urge strikes him to build a lifelike statue of Lincoln using the Logs. Every day he comes to the store, he is wearing a different hat and he seems to enjoy the eccentricity. He believes wholeheartedly in the magic of Magorium's Wonder Emporium.

Weston, played by Justin Bateman, is an accountant and doesn't believe in the store. He is there to set the records in order and he has a lot of work to do. Because he doesn't believe, Molly can barely tolerate him. Because he doesn't believe, Eric feels the need to help him realize the magic. Gradually, they become friends and talk and Weston asks about the hat collection. Eric offers to take him home and show him the collection and Weston is simply amazed; every wall of his room is covered in hats. They begin to play pirates and Eric's mother comes home to find them jumping around on the bed. Hmmmmmmm.

Naturally, Molly will realize two things. She will realize how to bring Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium back to life and she will realize how to complete her concerto. Will they be related?

But before this happens, we have to sit through a veeeeerrrrrryyyyyy slow second act in which she decides to sell the store and entertains offers from other people, because her first inclination is to get rid of the store. Naturally, after working with Magorium for years, learning all about his store, his passions, his life, her first inclination is to sell the store. I'm being sarcastic. This moment seems completely false. All it shows is that Molly has learned nothing from Magorium.

And perhaps we haven't either.",1201046400,12,6193,4.681985294117647

This is a unique movie.  The plot is relatively simple - Toy Store Owner prepares his assistant to take over the business.  There is no villain in the form of a character.  I suppose the ""villain,"" or conflict in the plot, is ""lack of imagination.""  This is initially personified in the form of a dry, by-the-books accountant, however this character is by no means the villain in this story.  ""Lack of imagination"" is the force opposing Mr. Magorium and his whimsical store.

I suspect that mainstream America and the critics didn't respond favorably to this movie for two reasons:  marketing this movie was difficult; and much of mainstream America and the critics are guilty of exhibiting the same element that served as the conflict in the movie:  ""lack of imagination.""

For example, in one scene, the witless accountant finally gives in to others' use of imagination and tries being imaginative himself by wearing silly hats and pretending to be someone else.  He and a young boy act out fairy tale stories and let their imagination run wild.  The boy's mother discovers them and is immediately suspicious of the accountant's intentions.  It's as if the movie is commenting on some people that perhaps don't ""get it.""  Additionally, as if life were imitating art, there were some people that didn't ""get"" this movie.

My family (with two kids aged 6 and 3) thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and we could comfortably watch it without fear of ""toilet gags"" and without anxiety of seeing crude/vulgar moments.  And this movie also effectively addressed the potentially disturbing subject of ""death.""  I liked the approach here.

Like the characters in the movie, give Mr. Magorium a chance.  And let your imagination flow with the movie.

Favorite line:  ""Light bulbs die.  I am departing.""",1200787200,24,1822,4.983388704318937
3084967,5,B00128VA6C,"Perception is everything in this world. The story of Mr. Magorium is partly one of the archetypal American legend who inspired a generation to carry on dreaming. It is significant that Kermit makes an appearance in the film as Jim Henson was one such figure who may well, have inspired the films philosophy. Few men of his generation were so influential to the children of the world and these men like Magorium set an example not by what they said so much but by what they did with their lives. Inspiration reverberates for generations and the wisdom which comes from that inspiration will hopefully always lead us towards the lights until ultimately we have a legacy like Magorium's to pass on. This idea of finding faith in past childhood wisdom in order to regain direction in ones life is largely the journey Molly Mahoney must grasp in the film until she understands the strength of her perception and how she can do some good in this world.

This film was an unexpected highlight over the holiday period. My whole family enjoyed it and will be one for the collection when it finally comes out. The cast performances, as you might expect are a class act and the story was very heartening. I strongly recommend this film and I'd say, pay no attention to superficial comparisons to the Wonka movie!",1199923200,,1301,4.681222707423581

3084969,4,B00128VA6C,"This gentle show gives us slices of life, death, friendship, loss and renewal all in a magical setting.  Granted, it is formulaic, but in a way that's not tedious.

Mr. Magorium (Hoffman), who reminded me a little of Ed Wynn's Uncle Albert in ""Mary Poppins,"" owns a living, magical store full of colorful, magical toys that children love.  He's never kept tabs on profit or loss, has items and signatures from people who lived up to hundreds of years ago, and is now about to ""leave.""  He wishes to pass the store on to Mahoney (Portman), much to her dismay.  She sees  herself as a failure in her chosen field and entirely unsuited to run a magic store.  And, because she loves Mr. Magorium (who is also ""Not Steve""), is heartbroken at the same time.  The child-like Magorium will not be swayed from his appointed hour, however.

To further the crisis, the store itself throws a temper tantrum at Magorium's planned exit and loses all of its color and magic after his death.  Mahoney, with accountant Henry (nicknamed ""Mutant,"" which I found funny all movie long) and store gofer Eric, must set about restoring things after a mandatory crisis of faith.  She wants to sell the store, sort of.

It is the dry and dusty accountant who finally sees the light, that the store must not be sold off, and helps Mahoney to realize her destiny with the help of a magical block of wood.  Of course the beauty and magic of the store and its furnishings are restored.

Will Mahoney also live 243 years, and somehow keep that quaint old building (sandwiched between skyscrapers) intact, open, and safe from modern government regulations?  Who knows?  But forget the newspaper review if it was like the one I read. This is a pleasant little movie that worked its magic not only on me, but even on my G-rated-movie-hating teenager who loves shoot-'em up shows and video games. A fine time was had by all.",1196294400,,1889,4.627627627627628
3084970,4,B00128VA6C,"This movie is great for kids and kids at heart.  They did a very good job of portraying a whimsical magical toy store full of neat things that come alive.  When the toy store was content, it was quite colorful and enjoyable to behold.  When the toy store was down in the dumps, its color changed to a drab grey to reflect that.  It also had a temper tantrum and went from an orderly organized toy store to a disorganized messy chaotic toy store.  You see, the toy store had a personality too, and it was upset that Mr. Magorium (played by Dustin Hoffman) was leaving.  He was leaving the store to Molly Mahoney (played by Natalie Portman), but she didn't want the store at first.  She thought that only Mr. Magorium could effectively run the store because he was full of magic.  Only later does she find out that she has magic herself too with the help of an unlikely character, Henry Weston the accountant (played by Jason Bateman).  She magically puts the toy store back in order, and accepts Mr. Magorium's offer.  All in all a very fun movie with touching moments that your kids can see too.  It leaves you with a sunny feeling in your heart.",1196294400,,1146,4.40952380952381
3084971,2,B00128VA6C,"For a film focusing heavily on believing in magic, Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium is surprisingly devoid of the magic of moviemaking. Several clich characters and a story missing any real conflict produces a whimsically dreary tale best reserved for the young at heart and absent of mind. While its target audience will likely find plenty to enjoy in the Emporium, fans of Hoffman and Portman will want to wait for more meaningful ventures.

Narrated by young Eric (Zach Mills) and told like a storybook complete with chapters, Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium tells the tale of exactly that. The eccentric 243-year-old toy aficionado (Dustin Hoffman) runs a magical toy store with little care in the world. But when he decides it's time to depart from this life and wills the store to Molly Mahoney (Natalie Portman), the Emporium's manager and only other employee (save for the strange circus reject living in the basement), she questions her ability to handle such promotion and determines to make Magorium realize all the fun he would be leaving behind. Meanwhile, Magorium has hired Henry (Jason Bateman) to sort out the mess of receipts and legal requirements of running a business, and it's up to Eric (and a mystical wooden cube) to show both the stuffy accountant and the insecure Molly the magic of believing in yourself.

Deceptively opening with Pixar-esque cutout animation during its credits, such frills are the only thing Magorium has in common with the ever-entertaining computer animated films. Stocked with unremarkable characters, the situations they are confronted with range from death to disbelief, though rarely do we feel attached enough to care. The conflicts never feel immediate and the solutions don't stay grounded in reality. Perhaps the most pressing predicament is a saddened, personified toy store quickly losing its color, or a mopey sock monkey without someone to hold.

Magorium has an impressive cast in likely their least impressive performances. Dustin Hoffman as the gray-haired, bushy-eyebrowed title character grates on the nerves rather quickly with his too-cheerful quips and contrived speech impediment. If Willy Wonka wasn't cool, and owned a toy store instead of a chocolate factory, he'd be Mr. Magorium. Natalie Portman is believable as a cheery toy store manager, and even as a piano prodigy, but rarely does she evoke any emotions from her audience other than regret for not watching her other, better roles. Jason Bateman fits as the workaholic accountant who needs to believe in magic for others to believe in themselves, but too little focus is placed on his character development. He's not an antagonist and no one needs to work all that hard to make a believer out of him. In fact, there is no villain in this film at all, unless the sandman's gritty fingers reaching for your eyelids counts.

While rather languid in the story department, the effects and set designers likely had a field day with the living Emporium, piled high with all manner of games and toys. Animated mobiles, graying walls, and a monstrous dodgeball highlight the special effects, and what wasn't computer generated appeared painstakingly crafted. The dial that changes the rooms of the store also added to the creative feats, though its too bad Miyazaki showcased the concept in Howl's Moving Castle several years earlier.

If one tried very hard they might be able to sink into the magical world of Mr. Magorium and his living toy store, and at times might even realize the important lessons on display, from believing in yourself to the value of friendship. But flying wooden cubes and sad sock puppets mixed with Shakespearean quotes and misbehaved zebras will probably make you forget about such trivial morals.

3084973,5,B00128VA6C,"I love first run movies.  No home theatre system can replace the smell of popcorn, the wall of video and sound of a real theatre--but with the rising cost, I see them on matinee and I rarely ever see a film twice in the theatre.

If my companion had agreed to turn around and see ""Mr. Magorium"" again, I would have done so.  I do plan on taking some friends to see this film--a retread for me but it'll be a treat to see their reactions as the plot unfolds.

""Mr. Magorium's Magic Emporium"" is a 100 year old magical toy store that's about to see some changes.  You see, Mr. Magorium (Dustin Hoffman), the 243 year old proprieter has just run out of his last pair of shoes that he'd selected to 'last the rest of his life' and he's going to move on. (Note--he didn't say 'die' batteries do that)

Eric Applebaum (Zach Mills) is a young boy who collects hats, but only made one friend at summer camp.  ""Jeff"" turned out to be a squirrel.  He's the narrator of this story and a frequent visitor to Mr. Magorium's.

Molly Maloney (Natalie Portman) is the manager of the emporium and the Magorium's unsuspecting heir.  Mahoney is just marking time at Magorium's--she was a musical prodigy, but at 23 feels washed up because she can't get her music quite right. She's surprised when the boss calls in an accountant--they've never had one. Magorium keeps it secret from her that he's doing this to value his bequest to Mahoney.

That's where Henry Weston comes in.  He's a ""Just"" man as Mahoney puts it. It's ""just a""--toy store, car, etc.  No magic in him.

When Magorium does move on, it's up to the three of them to ressucitate a place that's lost all the color in it.  It takes a wooden cube and a whole lot of belief to make that happen.

I'll certainly buy this DVD when it becomes available and see it periodically, because it is a geniune 'feel good' movie without drowning you in excess sucrosity.  The animation was delightful and I was especially moved to see Kermit the Frog make a cameo appearance as a Magorium customer.",1195948800,7,2028,4.437837837837838
3084974,4,B00128VA6C,"What a charming movie ""Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium"" is; here's a film that's delightful, fun, and touching without getting too sentimental. Not that the story is free from sentiment--many key moments tap into a number of emotions, many of which we thought we had abandoned long ago. Watching this film, my belief in the power of positive thinking was refreshed, and I'll thank you to not make fun of me for saying something so hokey. Much like the toy store owned by the eccentric yet loveable Edward Margorium, the film thrives on magic and whimsy, with a plot that instills a positive message without getting sappy. It was thoroughly delightful to watch something so upbeat.

Some have dismissed this film as being a watered down rehash of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."" I do understand how that comparison can be made; both films include oddball lead characters and magical, kid-friendly environments. Nonetheless, ""Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium"" stands on its own, having the power to entrance its audience with a meaningful story, humorous characters, and a wealth of creative special effects. Basically, it feels as bright and colorful as it looks, and we begin to feel joyous as soon as the opening credits begin to roll. Immediately after that, a voiceover narration introduces us to Bellini (Ted Ludzik), the bookmaker for Mr. Magorium's toyshop and his personal historian. From this, we learn that the film will be divided into chapters, each one covering the events that led to big changes.

The most important character, obviously, is Mr. Magorium (Dustin Hoffman), a 243-year-old free spirit who operates a living toy store. Behind certain doors, rooms can change with the flick of a switch. An inventory book can produce a toy in the blink of an eye. Toys are able to operate on their own. Balls bounce by themselves. A mobile has living fresh-water fish hanging from strings. Stuffed animals reach out and beg to be hugged. The store's manager is Molly Mahoney (Natalie Portman), an incredibly insecure young woman desperate to find her purpose in life. A marvelous pianist, she's unable to escape the world of prewritten music; she wants to compose an original piece. But something is holding her back, something strong enough to leave her frustrated while sitting behind a keyboard. She knows there's more to herself, but she doesn't know what it is or how to free it. As happy as she is working for Mr. Magorium, she feels stuck.

After running the shop for over one hundred years, Mr. Magorium decides that it's time to leave (and I won't get more specific than that). To sort out the financial details--of which he had never given any thought to--he hires an accountant named Henry Weston (Jason Bateman). He's immediately given the nickname Mutant, not only because Mr. Magorium believes it's the suffix to ""accountant,"" but also because he's an uptight workaholic that doesn't believe in magic. From his point of view, nothing extraordinary happens in the store; it's a place where kids buy things, and nothing more. Mahoney says he sees everything in terms of the word ""just""--it's ""just"" a toy store, and it ""just"" sells ordinary things. Doing paperwork and talking business is all he knows how to do, which is why he thinks nothing of pointing out suspicious financial activity to Mr. Magorium. Example: when Mutant addresses doing business with imaginary characters like the King of Planet Yahweh, Mr. Magorium says, ""Oh, he's not imaginary. He was never a king, and Planet Yahweh doesn't exist, but he's real.""

Frequenting the store is nine-year-old Eric Applebaum (Zach Mills), who also serves as the film's narrator. I loved this character; he's articulate and witty, and in some ways, he's just as eccentric as Mr. Magorium. For one thing, he has an impressive hat collection, and he wears a different one every single day. He can also build a life-sized state of Abraham Lincolm out of Lincoln Logs. But as approachable as he seems, he has absolutely no friends, save for Mahoney and Mr. Magorium. They both pressure him to be more outgoing, but he holds himself back because everyone his age has labeled him as weird and unlikable. He finally begins to engage Mutant, who gradually relearns how to have some fun. There's a wonderful scene in which they have a conversation through a window; they communicate by writing messages on pieces of paper and holding them up.

Mr. Magorium tells Mahoney that, upon his departure, she'll be the sole owner of the Wonder Emporium. Her self-confidence plummets--how can she operate a business without the man who started it? And what if she doesn't want to be the owner? What if she wants to pursue a career in music? The store itself also takes the news pretty badly, as seen when it's bright red walls turn gray and the toys go berserk. Much like an infant child, it throws a temper tantrum, forcing Mr. Magorium to temporarily close the store. Even for a man that owns a pet zebra and actually helped Thomas Edison invent the light bulb, this is simply too bizarre; everything must be smoothed out before he leaves, and in order for that to happen, he has to have the full cooperation of the store, of Mahoney, and of Mutant.

There are many, many subtler nuances that make ""Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium"" a truly enjoyable film, such as a machine that dresses people, a living dinosaur skeleton made of wood, and a cameo appearance by Kermit the Frog. But what I enjoyed the most was its emotional core; I actually felt happy when I left the theater, not only because I had watched a fun film, but also because it actually resonated with me on a deeper level. This is an enchanting story--I recommend it to everyone, young and old alike.",1195516800,3,5724,4.865641025641025

These people did not have the courage for 90 short minutes to suspend their cynicism, disbelief, and cowardly need for proof or substantiation of every little thing. (Big ol' raspberry to them!)
A kid's movie? ""Just"" for children? Heck no. Rather, this movie is ""just"" for those, regardless of physical age, who have been fortunate enough to retain any portion of their own childlike -- notice, I did not say childISH -- appreciation and pure unclouded understanding of wonder, simplicity, love, and of magic found in the everyday.

3085107,4,B00128VA6C,"It's such a kid's movie. What I refer to as a Manhattan Kid's Movie. It just feels like the kind of story that was made with the elite Manhattan children in mind. That being said, it also holds an innocent charm that I think we lose as we age. I'm glad to say I have been able to hold onto that spark for all these years and this movie renews it. Yes it's ridiculous. Yes, it's perposterous. It's also disarmingly charming and there is an endearing quality to Dustin Hoffman's performance. Jason Bateman can just make anything good. He doesn't seem to fail at that and Natalie Portman has a real sparkle.",1473292800,,604,4.401785714285714

3085149,5,B00128VA6C,"This is one of my daughter's and I favorite movies to watch together. I didn't watch it when it first came out and surprisingly, it was my daughter who discovered this movie.

It is the quintessential family movie.  It's rated ""G"" which I'm ashamed to say I equate with ""boring""! I couldn't be more wrong when it came to this movie.
It's a wonderful movie for the whole family.  Me, my tween daughter ,my teenage son and even my 40 something year old husband  all really liked it.  I'm really shocked that when this was released in 2007 it didn't do very well or make much money.

It's basically about believing in yourself and having self confidence.  Natalie Portman (who I happen to believe is a suburb actress) is perfectly cast as Mahoney, the store manager,  a former child pianist who doesn't believe in herself.  She works for Mr. Magorium,played by a DELIGHTFUL  Dustin Hoffman, who is the childlike Santa  Claus-esque 243 year old owner of the Toy store.  He decides to give the store to Mahoney who doesn't feel she I can do it.  In preparation of this change in ownership, he hires an accountant (Jason Bateman).

As I said this a great little movie, Perfect for children of all ages.  It has a great story, awesome actors and it's just a nice way to pass some time .",1461974400,,1279,4.5

I was looking to try amazon's movie rental and decided to pick this movie because I didn't think I'd regret watching it again, even if things didn't go my way. Wrong. I remember the movie wasn't bad, it's kid friendly and not completely boring for adults....plus there is a sock monkey scene and I have an unhealthy obsession with sock monkeys. Right up until the end of the movie.....when it became silly and I just had to cut it off and move on. Great for households with kids under, let's say 7.

3085199,4,B00128VA6C,"I think kids will like this. It's a story about a really old man, who is quite childlike, who owns a toy store. He decides that it's his time to go, so he wills the store to his clerk. Unfortunately, this is a magic toy store and the clerk doesn't believe she has any magic to keep the store going.

Jason Bateman is the stand out in this production - probably because he's the straight man. Everyone else is a bit wacky. He does have a scene where he gets childlike where he's completely different. That is worth watching.

The little kid is also adorable. I'd expect more from Hoffman and Portman being that they are the lead actors and that they are both really good actors. They were kind of over the top for me. I think kids won't notice though.

As far as the story itself, it was sweet. I think it will either grow on you and you will love it more and more, or you will just watch it once and not need to watch it again. Still, it's worth seeing at least once.",1449014400,,967,4.132978723404255

There is magic in all of us, but we need to want to find it. Dustin Hoffman's and Natalie Portman's performances were great. Even though the film is primarily for children I thought that it was meant for all ages because if we really wish to find happiness in life, it does not matter how old we are. Mr. Magorium served his purpose until his very last day, and he did not lose his happiness. All in all it was a very positive film about faith, devoation, and creativity.",1422748800,,625,4.1735537190082646

3085440,4,B00128VA6C,"A children's fantasy, all about a sense of wonder and active magic in a huge toy store that is alive and has feelings. Magorium is getting old, he is 243 years old and senses that his apprentice is stuck so he dies to push her along. Molly Mahoney doesn't feel she has the skills or sense to run a magical toy store, yet she knows it is magical, as she tells the accountant Henry, who is even more mundane and buttoned up. It is a learns-better story, an opening up to active magic, finding a connection. But old wizard Magorium has to die to teach  Molly and Henry what is magic. A sense of wonder, but a sweet children's story. Not quite Mary Poppins but still a better story than expected. If I had been 5 years old at the time I would have been overwhelmed with joy at it. Nowadays I don't got so enthralled with a fantasy movie unless it is slightly more adult in nature (for example, Stardust, Monkeybone, Who Framed Roger Rabbit). This film has a magnificent and very impressive set of thousands and thousands of toys---all alive. There is a symbiotic connection between the store and Mr. Magorium (who resembles Merlin in many ways). When Magorium dies the store goes deep into depression, when it feels Magorium is going to go away it has a temper tantrum.
  The cast choice is a surprise. Why Dustin Hoffman? And Natalie Portman? I don't think they were right for the parts. Definitely a film for small children. It has parallels with Miracle on 34th Street-- in which skeptics develop a sense of the magical in a subtle way. Also a zen feeling of wisdom is learned by the those skeptics. Molly learns that a block of wood that Magorium gave to her isn't a block of wood, but a symbol of her potential to activate things and move toys.",1399680000,,1745,4.429906542056075

Mr. Magorium does die at the end, and he does die voluntarily which had both of my kids in tears and asking me whether or not he committed suicide.  Yikes.  I said that, first of all, this is a movie, not real life, and secondly, Mr. Magorium was a magical being, kind of like an angel, and I think he just decided his work on earth was done and that it was time for him to go back up to heaven for a while.

It's a really neat movie for people who are open to a clean, fun, child-like fantasy world.  A fair comparison would be ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" as far as how it excites and appeals to a child's imagination of what they wish could really happen.",1385942400,,579,4.572815533980583

3085502,5,B00128VA6C,"It is probably the sweetest movie I have ever stumbled upon. The first time I watched this movie a few years back my dad made us all sit down together and watch the whole thing. I thought it was the weirdest show I had ever seen and vowed never to watch it again. About 2 years later I watched it with him once more and (since I actually payed attention this time) fell completely in love with it.
  It is the most innocent, happy, heart-warming movie I have seen probably ever. While I admit that the special effects are not the best, the message is inspiring and beautiful. I felt rather like Mahoney at the time I watched it (stuck and low on courage in myself) and it struck close to my heart. Since then I have bought the soundtrack, which I listen to every night when I fall asleep, learned to play much of it on the piano, and watched the movie every time I ever feel down or in need of something peaceful. Everything about it fills you with a sense of love and happiness.
  It is my all time favorite movie.

3085521,5,B00128VA6C,"Dustin Hoffman plays Mr. Edward Magorium, the owner of the magical toy store rightfully named Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium. I'm not a huge fan of the movie because of the magic. It's not the witty lines, the family-friendliness or even the character I identify most with, Natalie Portman's Molly Mahoney. It's Mr. Magorium.

Molly Mahoney (Natalie Portman)
  I identify most with Molly Mahoney because she also plays piano. The song she knew best as a child is still, today, the only song she can perform. She feels stuck - or unable to go further with her talent, skills, etc. in life. She believes more in others than herself. She has a very difficult time saying goodbye. I share all of this with Mahoney so that when Mr. Magorium is there for her, it feels like he's speaking to me too.

Mr. Magorium (Dustin Hoffman)
  Mr. Magorium is 243 years old and preparing to ""depart."" He explains that a light bulb dies, but he...shall depart. A beautiful way to look at a sad situation. He plans to give the toy store to Mahoney upon his departure, but Mahoney simply can't take the responsibility because she doesn't believe in herself. Mr. Magorium spends a good amount of time encouraging Mahoney and Eric (a shy, hat-collecting boy who struggles making friends but helps out at the store). He tries to impart wisdom and encouragement to them both so they will believe in themselves and embrace the bravery he knows they need in life's journey.

  I cry when Mr. Magorium departs. My heart pours from my tear ducts and I can't help but feel sad. When Mr. Magorium is saying his farewell to Mahoney, he explains:

""When King Lear dies in Act V, do you know what Shakespeare has written? He's written ""He dies."" That's all, nothing more. No fanfare, no metaphor, no brilliant final words. The culmination of the most influential work of dramatic literature is ""He dies."" It takes Shakespeare, a genius, to come up with ""He dies."" And yet every time I read those two words, I find myself overwhelmed with dysphoria. And I know it's only natural to be sad, but not because of the words ""He dies."" but because of the life we saw prior to the words.

I've lived all five of my acts, Mahoney, and I am not asking you to be happy that I must go. I'm only asking that you turn the page, continue reading... and let the next story begin. And if anyone asks what became of me, you relate my life in all its wonder, and end it with a simple and modest 'He died.'""

  His final line to Mahoney is, ""Your life is an occasion. Rise to it."" By this point, I'm an emotional wreck. I've watched this movie a thousand times, and it was just recently I finally figured out why it is that I can't accept the departure of Mr. Magorium or any of my loved ones in real life. I can't imagine a world without my loved ones in it - the world is the magical place it is because they're here, now, with me. I can't make up for their absence and can't recreate the magic they've blessed the world with. The idea of them no longer living life with me is overwhelming and I'm not ready to accept it. I'm not sure if I ever will be, but I know I will always turn to this movie in difficult times to find a spark of encouragement, a light of hope and a few rays of sunshine to part my dark clouds.

""We must face tomorrow, whatever it may hold, with determination, joy and bravery.""

3085538,5,B00128VA6C,"I started being a Natalie Portman fan when I saw Beautiful Girls, but haven't followed her that much after she was in the Star Wars films. But among all her movies, I like this one the best, as a fun movie to watch. It's a movie about a toy store, and toys make people happy. But there are some sad parts in this movie too, and as an adult, I even got choked up, so I just want to warn the kids that they might cry watching the sad parts. But it is intended for kids as I think it's rated G, so it must be deemed not intense when dealing with the sad themes. Maybe it's just I'm too sensitive. The kid in the movie does a real good job and is very likeable, even though his character is suppose to have no friends. Great special effects too. But if you are a Dustin Hoffman fan or Natalie Portman fan, this is a fun movie that I don't remember having much fanfare. I'm happy I discovered this movie.",1369180800,,899,4.027932960893855

Perhaps some more background on the individual characters would have made for a 'deeper' feel, but nonetheless, it was enjoyable to watch.  One of the underlying purposes of the movie was to believe in oneself, and it handled this well.  We watched w/ our 6-year old who enjoyed the magical toys that made up the center-piece of the movie, and she sat through the whole film and enjoyed it too.",1362182400,,455,4.592592592592593

I give the story three stars because its O.K. but not to deep, or to detailed, but it's a ""kids"" movie made for kids and one of the better ones around (Not the typical stupid type with stupid jokes or jesters to get a cheep laugh). I would not have bought this movie before seeing it first if Natalie Portman was not staring in this movie. I have LOVED her from the first movie I saw her in (The Professional) to her most recent ones. Portman is in most of the scenes in ""...Emporium"" which is why this movie works.

At times, I felt like the movie moved slowly or threw the ""believe in yourself"" message at me too often--something I might have minded less if the makers hadn't simultaneously added in a clever word play about the King of Planet Yahweh, but ""there is no king, and Yahweh (another name for God) doesn't exist.""

3085677,5,B00128VA6C,"Mr Magorium's Wonder Emporium is a wonderful addition to any movie collection.  This story illustrates how you have to believe in order to succeed.  In the story Mr. Magorium's toy store is as magical as Mr. Magorium himself.  He has a door of rooms, a magical book that can locate any toy in the store, a man who lives in the basement who helps with all the books and so much more.  The time has come for Mr. Magorium to leave this life and move on to the next, unfortunately this makes the toy store very upset.  The store starts to ""throw a tantrum"" at the very idea of having to exist without their owner.  Now Mr. Magorium needs someone to take over the store and keep the store happy, only the young lady he has chosen doesn't believe in herself.

I loved sharing this story with my two kids.  We enjoyed watching the toy store come to life.  The imagination that went into the story is fabulous.  If I didn't know better, I would think a child had written the story.  It made me want to be a kid again (or at least act like one!)

3085685,3,B00128VA6C,"This movie was ordered on an impulse; I'd heard some good things about it and decided to try it out. After watching it once, I had not seen it when it was released in the theaters; it impressed me as a moderately charming fantasy if you were prepared to accept its assumptions.

This is true of most movies and I usually don't have too much trouble doing that but this time it just didn't seem to work as well for me. The production of the movie seemed too formulaic, the impression is they were just trying too hard to make it work and it just didn't quite come off right. Too many aspects of the movie were just a little bit over the top.

As I look back I come to the conclusion it might have been better just to rent the movie instead of buy it; I'll watch the movie again just to check my impressions and if I revise my thinking I'll update this review.",1268784000,,858,4.131736526946108
3085686,2,B00128VA6C,"Honestly, I am 23 years old.  I watched this movie because it was written and directed by Zach Helm, who did ""Stranger Than Fiction"".  I was hoping for something as creative and meaningful as that movie, but I was disappointed.  This movie is for children, and it's special effects are now(2010) severely outdated(and not in a charming way).  The plot is similar to ""The Neverending Story"", except newer and more complicated.  Some of the ""magical"" scenes seem to drag on awkwardly long and don't add anything to the story.  Dustin Hoffman delivers a respectable performance as does the young outcast boy, but Natalie Portman is not at her best.  I do not recommend this film to anyone.  Even for children there are better movies that deliver the same message.",1268697600,2,760,4.837209302325581

3085688,3,B00128VA6C,"The movie is certainly a feast for the eyes, but the characters seem very two dimensional. We get an inkling about Molly being lost and get an idea that Bateman's character doesn't have as much fun as he should, but we really know little about Mr Magorium. Despite his 243 years, we have no knowledge of who he interacted with over the centuries: which famous people might have walked through those doors to get a toy that they cherished throughout their lives. Hoffman appears to be doing a homage to Ed Wynn in his mannerism and delivery, yet overall I wanted more from this flick. Why does only the monkey toy beckon to Bateman of all the toys on the wall? For a while I thought it was a toy he had long forgotten about. That would have been a better hook to pull Bateman's character into believing the store's magic (realising something he'd lost; finding again a cherished toy that cherished him). The chapter headings were absolutely pointless and distracting. We know Mr. Magorium's chapters are closing and Molly's chapters are about to turn a page, why hit us over the head? I've rated this a three, but it's really two and half stars.",1265414400,2,1144,4.585365853658536
3085689,2,B00128VA6C,"Despite a workable premise (magic toy store), this movie is relentlessly depressing.  The kids came to see a movie about magic, wonder, and loony fun . . . not about death and decay!

And why is Dustin Hoffman still getting roles?  He's been playing the same character for the last twenty years!  How is he still getting work?",1264550400,,326,4.568965517241379
3085690,5,B00128VA6C,"I found the story emotionally moving and delightful to watch. It even has a line that resonates long after the film concludes: ""Your life is an occasion: rise to it."" Well-acted.",1261785600,,178,4.774193548387097
3085691,4,B00128VA6C,"The children's movie ""Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium"" is highly manipulative and highly effective film-making. Mr. Magorium (Dustin Hoffman) is a toystore wizard whose decided that it's time for him to depart from this world not because 243 years is a long time to live but because he's run out of his favorite shoes. Molly Mahoney (Natalie Portman) is his apprentice who once as a piano prodigy tried to compose a master concerto but now as Mr. Magorium's heir apparent must figure out what to do with a block of wood. To help her Mr. Magorium has hired an accountant or ""a counting mutant"" (Jason Bateman), who as a humorless workaholic represents all that's wrong with the adult world, and so kids instinctively like to step on him. Serving as the narrator and the conscience of the movie is nine-year old Eric.

With Mr. Magorium as the composer the wonder emporium is simply a visual symphony, with shiny fire engines popping out of dusty books and Lego construction workers causing fire hazards. Everything is so cute and cuddly, as are the characters. Dustin Hoffman is very good, Jason Bateman is his usual likable self even when he's playing the movie's antagonist, and Natalie Portman manages to yet again demonstrate the full range of her acting talents even in a movie as emotionally one-sided as this one. This is a feel-good movie, and even the supposedly weird narrator Eric is weird only because he has the wisdom of someone who has lived three centuries.

And as a feel-good movie it slides into conflict and climax without really doing so. Mr. Magorium's last day is one big holiday, his depature is treated as a non-event, and Molly Mahoney's ""rise to the occasion"" is so assured that we have to credit the movie with even pretending anything else was possible.

Yes, this movie may be predictable and plotless but it raises an interesting point about how children and the elderly benefit society. Modern economics views children and the elderly as ""dependents,"" meaning they use important resources without helping to create wealth. Economists have long known that a population with a large proportion of working adults relative to dependents (Ireland, China, and soon India) benefit from fast and tremendous growth; the converse is also true, and so it's easy and quick to believe that the less children and elderly there are the better.

""Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium"" suggests these so-called dependents have an instrinsic and priceless social value: in them lies humanity's collected wisdom that adults have too easily forgotten. The counting mutant never believed in the magic of faith to change one's world, and Molly Mahoney had forgotten to believe but Eric always believed, and he believed with such a stubborn passion that he, not Molly Mahoney, is Mr. Magorium's true heir apparent. Eric is the only one who understands the counting mutant is really a child at heart, that it is time for Mr. Magorium to leave, and that Molly Mahoney is the only one who can inherit the store. The adults must struggle to discover truths that come instinctively to Eric.

That's because this is a children's movie, and Eric is the true hero and protagonist. More than conversing with the Molly Mahoneys and the counting mutants of this world (who as caricatures don't really exist) this movie is telling the the lonely and underappreciated Erics of this world that everyday because they see color in a world of gray and have faith in an overly rational world they help blind adults see.

But is this really true? Well, as Eric and Mr. Magorium would say, you just have to believe.",1257724800,2,3596,4.896551724137931

I picked it up for my kids, unaware of what is was about, and rented it simply because it was rated G -which is hard to find, and found myself engrossed and in love with this movie. It is perfect for any age group and any individual who is in-touch with their inner child's imagination and who has an appreciation for the art of fantasy. I very rarely BUY movies-but after seeing this only once I knew that it had to become part of our regular library of entertainment. The cast is superb, the acting is great, and the story line is fantastically unique. Anyone who 'doesn't get' this movie has simply grown old and become so serious that they have forgotten the joy of dreaming and the small pleasures of childhood like pop wrap and glowing stars on your ceiling at night. As they said in the movie Hook, they ""have forgotten how to fly"". And for the rest of us, its a fantastic trip back to visit those fantasies.",1253232000,2,946,4.380681818181818

Contrary to what other people have said in their reviews, this part didn't bother me because I thought that it was scary(although, that is definitely something to consider if you're thinking about showing this movie to small children!).  I thought it was sad.  I woke up the morning after I saw Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium feeling like I wanted to cry.  I'm not sure if it was necessary to put death into this movie.  Including this subject does add a little something that I can't even explain or even completely understand.  Perhaps it keeps the movie from becoming overly juvenile.

Her utterly wooden appearance in those 3 movies were an affront to acting.  But after seeing Closer and this movie, I now blame George Lucas for her acting in the Star Wars movies.  This is probably the biggest name movie since Star Wars in which Portman is the lead actress, and she pulls it of quite well.  The premise of the movie is quite simple, a very old man owns a magical toy shop whose clerk is a young lady played by Portman.  Said owner, Mr. Magorium, feels his death approaching and decides to hand the store over to his lady clerk.  The store and her disagree, and trouble ensues.  Of course, being a children's movie, the ending is happy, if not somewhat predictable.  The movie itself is carried by the acting, primarily by Dustin Hoffman, who puts in probably his best acting since Hook, and Portman, who puts in her best performance ever.  The soundtrack is also exquisite, and its development is central to the movie's premise.  Overall, quite worth watching.",1236729600,,1090,4.689473684210526
3085715,4,B00128VA6C,"This film is an ultra entertaining, feel good film that will fill your heart with joy.  I have now seen this film 3 times - the last being the bluray version which I had to purchase.  The film itself has an amazing cast who create a great ensemble.  No one tries to steal the show and they all inhabit their characters fully and with care as if they know the special story they are telling.  The story, message and magical wonder emporium itself are the true stars here.

Dutin Hoffman as the store owner is magical and Natalie Portman and Jason Bateman shine on screen as they do some of their best work.  Child actor Zach Mills is a revelation and gives a truly tender, heartfelt performance.  In this day and age with so much tragedy sometimes we forget to feel good and that pleasure can be found in some of the simplest places.  This film shows the viewer that life can be looked at with a positive outlook, definitely tells us to never forget our dreams and that the child in us has the right to always be in the forefront.  Love, sharing and casring are what makes the world go round.

Bluray is also a magical gift in itself to film lovers and this movie was created for bluray presentation.  The whole movie is crisp with vivid color and strong detail.  Everything pops out and the store itself is a thing of beauty.  The whole film shines.  It is so clear that some scenes that were shot with a spotlight on the main action appears like a play.  The film becomes a magical stage with the special light highlighting the action.

I had to give this film 4 stars and not 5 for I try to review honestly.  It is one of my true favorites and is nowe part of my bluray collection.  It is a magical joyful experience all should have but it does lack that certain oomph to make it a masterpiece.  Believe me, the 4 star rating is meant in no way to say the film is not brilliant.

3085727,5,B00128VA6C,"Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium is a movie that grows on you. After seeing it three times, I am beginning to understand why.

On the surface, it's a fun children's movie, but as you go deeper into the richness of it's texture and dialogue, you see something more. You might see yourself in the characters -- Mahoney who can't find the notes, Eric who can't find a friend, and Henry who can't seem to stop working. They're all on an adventure, and, in the end, everyone finds what they are looking for, even though they are not quite sure what they are looking for.

Two hundred and forty-three year old Edward Magorium knows.

Near the beginning of the film, when Mr. Magorium (Dustin Hoffman) hands Molly Mahoney (Natalie Portman) a block of polished wood -- ""the Congreve block,"" a likely allusion to the Congreve clock -- she's confused. She's not sure what it's for. Magorium tells her, ""Unlikely adventures require unlikely tools."" The block is the tool, but we don't know fully why or how until the last scene of the movie.

""Are we going on an adventure?"" Mahoney asks with a smirk.

""Well, my dear, we're already on one. All I'll say is this,"" he continues. ""With faith, love, this block, and a counting mutant, you may find yourself someplace you've never imagined.""

All the actors -- including Jason Bateman as an accountant out of touch with himself and Zach Mills as a boy out of touch with the world -- deliver fine performances.

If you watch it once, you may not get it. If you watch it twice, you'll be hooked. Rent it first, if you must. But this movie will grow on you and, perhaps in years to come, will emerge a classic. It's one of my new all-time favorites.",1232496000,,1679,4.539735099337748

3085737,5,B00128VA6C,"This movie has really grown on me.  I liked it when I first saw it, but didn't really see it as the classic it appeared to want to be.  But, as with many great movies, it is deceptively better than it first appears to be.

The movie deals with loss, grief, change, acceptance, and the continuity of life.  These themes are not dealt with head-on...they are just woven into the plot, lightened up with a bit of verbal and visual froth, and there to contemplate by those who recognize them.  But to a child watching the movie, it is just funny, silly, a little sad, and has a happy ending.

If there is a more overt lesson in the story for younger viewers, it is learned through the character of the little boy, Eric.  Eric is a wonderful kid, and though we see other kids rejecting him, through Mr. Magorium, Mahoney, and Henry, we see just how terrific he really is.

With a title that rhymes like that, what would you expect beside the magical sweetness that just happens to be accepted by the world? I was quickly drawn in by this storybook world where the bizarre and quirky is just a way of life and no one thinks much more of it. Throw in a beautiful message of finding yourself, and I was pleasantly engrossed in this heartfelt tale.

Mr. Magorium is a very old inventor (several centuries) who has not only helped a few famous souls out there but has managed to create a magical toy store. However, he feels it is time to pass from this world. It seems to be pretty much his decision and he seems perfectly fine with it, and I found that to be an interesting look at death.

However, the store's manager Molly is a young woman who still hasn't quite figured out her place in the world. It's pretty shocking to her to learn that her beloved boss plans to die and leave her in charge when she has no idea who she is and only has a hat-collecting boy with no friends his own age and a workaholic accountant as her only companions.

Mr. Magorium is positive she'll do fine, with a little encouragement, and thus pours out a sweet story about finding the best in yourself.

It wasn't what I expected, and that's not a bad thing, especially when I realized the plot was deeper than a toy store romp.

I don't think the characters other than Mr. Magorium were as realized as they could have been, but they were still a far cry from two-dimensional bimbos and it did leave room for some proper growth.

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised at the story's charming simplicity and message. Nothing wildly exceptional, but it held its own in the way of family movies.",1220140800,5,1773,4.390243902439025

3085756,3,B00128VA6C,"Splitting kindergarteners into groups, I was given the privilege of assigning names for each group.  I was surprised to learn that about two-thirds of them had recently seen `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000E8M0VA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (Widescreen Edition)</a>,' so I knew names like Aslan, Mr. Tumnus, and the beavers would mean something special to them.  `Weren't you scared when the wolves showed up?' I asked.  `No,' they said in unison if not with some amusement.  The thought hadn't occurred to them, even if their embarrassed teacher wouldn't admit he got a jolt every time the wily beasts made their appearance.

What does that have to do with `Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium'?  Well, it has to do with audience appeal.  For some this movie will be only for primary purposes, say pre-school to third grade.  For me I was enchanted, but for some the digitalized special effects will seem ho-hum, and cynics will not even want to ride along.  With today's standards, even some of those kindergarteners may be underwhelmed by this film.

For all his inviting charm, Dustin Hoffman plays Edward Magorium, a soft spoken Willy Wonka with a lisp.  He's 243 years old, and his life is measured by the nifty pair of shoes he bought in Tuscany.  When his last pair wears out, he's done.  (Maybe I'm being too philosophical, but most of us--myself included--can hardly be trusted with that much time.)

He laudably puts the majority of his life span into his Emporium, a free-for-all place--that in my estimation--comes to life.  A magic inventory book summons a wish list, duck-duck goose takes literal form, and a perpetual paper air plane flies around the store.  These are just tasters, for the pacing of their unveiling is magical enough for me.  (I don't want to give away the whole store--sorry!)

Just like in `Willy Wonka' Magorium is looking for a successor to his emporium.  Mollie Mahoney (Natalie Portman) heads his staff, but while she believes in the magic, she pines to be a professional pianist and doesn't feel worthy to take his place.  The toy store seems to agree as it starts to turn grey in its foundations as the turnover becomes imminent.

The story unfolds like a book, complete with chapters as their created by a book builder (Ted Ludzek).  Balancing the skeptic/believer schism are an accountant and a kid.  Young Eric (Zack Mills) imitates his hero by sporting a collection of hats; sober Henry Westin (Jason Bateman) can't seem to smile, let alone loosen up to play checkers.  Edward Magorium isn't worried, for he's reassuring to Molly, and hiring Henry to assess the place was his idea.

Looking at the movie posters, I thought, `Well, it looks nice, but...How much can they do with a toy store?'  The answer is they do enough with the toy store, but what they do to the story is even better.  Predictable in places, I was still smitten by the interplay of budding romance and childhood whimsy.  Given the simple, but effective soundtrack and Mills' narration, and you're given one sweet and solid movie.  If you hold films like '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elf-Blu-ray/dp/B001E5CH0G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elf [Blu-ray</a>],' dear, then you're going to have a good time in 'Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium'.

3085757,4,B00128VA6C,"This was such a good, bright, intriguing, magical movie. However I couldn't give it the full 5 stars for two reasons. First, it is terribly sad. I generally don't mind ""bittersweet"" movies, but this one just drug me too far down that even the joyful ending couldn't erase the sad feeling from earlier in the film. Mahoney's distress was just too real!

The second reason is the manner in which Magorium dies. I love that the movie somewhat ""demystifies"" death, reinforcing that a life well lived is not a cause for sadness but of celebration and honor. But the fact that they made his death so ordinarily human with the funeral and everyone lined up at his graveside dressed in black, really disappointed me. I was so hoping as they showed his feet on the night he ""departed"" that somehow they would just disappear as a fitting end to his magical life. Instead I was left with the terrible question, ""What did he do to himself?"" and ""Who found his body?"" etc. I am relatively certain that kids over a certain age are savvy enough to ask the same questions. And the way the movie portrays it, I don't think there are satisfactory answers.

This portrayal of death with the questions it raises take away from the main message of the movie that, ""Your life is an occasion... rise to it,"" and that we do that by believing in ourselves and by faith in the seemingly impossible. ""Wonder Emporium"" is a beautifully crafted movie with only this one dark spot in my mind.

Wonderful performance by Dustin Hoffman.",1217548800,,173,4.548387096774194
3085759,5,B00128VA6C,"Let me make this clear first. I didn't watch this film with any children, nor am I some sort of child in a mans body. I'm a lover of movies that seek to entertain, inspire and teach. Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium does all three and the supporting cast to Dustin Hoffman really make this movie work.

Dustin Hoffman plays the eccentric toy shop owner who's over 240 years old and a believer in magic. One day he tells his dependable shop manager, Mahoney played by Natalie Portman that he's ""Leaving."" Firstly he must hire an accountant who we come to know solely as Mutant played by Jason Bateman to sort out all his paperwork, all 240 years worth. This becomes a story of friendship, love, belief and living life to the full to achieve all you wanted to achieve.

There are times in this film when it becomes truly heart wrenching. Especially the scene where Magorium finally leaves, but you become accepting of this, as that's what the movie's all about. Moving on. A very entertaining film for the entire family to enjoy and is something I'd strongly recommend",1216252800,,1064,4.624338624338624
3085760,5,B00128VA6C,This is a funny movie. Dustin Hoffman is outstanding in his role (especially when he talks to the zebra).,1216166400,,105,4.578947368421052
3085761,4,B00128VA6C,"People didn't really ""get"" this movie when it came out in November, partly because it looks like a cross between Willy Wonka and Pee Wee's Big Adventure. It's actually a movie about friendship, and death. And it's really funny.",1215648000,,227,4.846153846153846
3085762,3,B00128VA6C,"Take Willy Wonka out of the chocolate factory and put him in a toy story and you essentially have Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium.  Like Wonka, Mr. Magorium (Hoffman) is a playful eccentric with wild hair, and a penchant for bizarre behavior.  His old world story is nestled between high rise building and it's no wonder as he has owned the store for over 200 years.  Toys virtually come to life inside the store, playing with the customers as much as they play with the.  The store has an inter-dimensional quality to it as a certain door can lead to different rooms with the turn of a dial on the wall.  The large, dusty store catalog can materialize its toys from thin air just by turning its pages.

Molly Mahoney (Portman) is the store manager and we learn immediately that while she loves working there, she feels incomplete for having never pursued her dream to be a concert pianist.  This is underscored when a former college classmate comments that he didn't know that she was still working at the store.  For shy 9-year-old Eric, the store is a sanctuary as he has no friends his age.  Because Mr. Magorium has never kept book or paid taxes (sure, like the IRS would let him get away with that for 200 years!) he hires accountant Henry Weston (Bateman) to get the books in order.

Magorium startles Molly by announcing that his time in the world is up and he intends to leave the store to her.  Molly refuses to believe that's he's going to die and turns down the offer.  This causes the store to lose all its magic.  Its bright red walls turn black and the toys are now lifeless.  Henry and Eric have to convince Molly that she has to take over the store in order to save it.

Again, the parallels with Wonka are many, even down to the owner needing to find someone younger to take over.  However, while Wonka was laced with often biting commentary about the behavior of spoiled kids and their parents, Magorium has none of this conflict.  Henry's unresolved issues about having friends his age remain unresolved.  Molly's dreams of becoming a pianist are tossed aside.  Only Henry gets to grow, realizing that he cannot be all work and no play.

The film does have some nice special effects that bring the wonder and magic of the store alive but there's not much magic in the predictable and unsatisfying script.  It's riddled with clichs which try to force the viewer into knowing when to laugh and cry and be overjoyed.  On the plus side it's a film most kids, especially younger kids will adore and it is good, clean family entertainment.

Mr. Magorium is old - very old, yet full of energy and child-like humour.  He is about to deliver some sad news to his young shop manager, played by Natalie Portman.  She is devastated, and refuses to accept the news, trying to get her boss (and best friend) to change his mind.  Mr. M is as merry as can be, as an accountant (Jason Bateman) tries to make sense of the store records.

The ""heroes"" of many family films seem to often share the same cynical, shallow, smart-aleck personality, so it was refreshing to watch a movie whose actors did not resort to the same loud, tired, cheap-laugh antics to hold the attention of the audience.  The rich and often subtle facial expressions, body language and intonation of all four of the main actors, especially Hoffman, made this film worth a second viewing.  I also appreciated the message of this movie, which addressed the courage sometimes required to embrace creativity.

The movie follows a great line of not showing too much magic and allowing viewers to use their own creativity and imagination with it. I am a mom of three who is not really a fan of movies. However, this movie has captivated my children and myself in so many ways. I literally can and do watch it over and over again with my 3 year old and 7 year old.

This movie was supposed to be a fun, whimsical movie... but it just didn't cut it. It drug too much... it seemed like it was going on forever. The guy (I don't remember his name!) didn't believe that the store was magic...Mahoney persistently tried to convince him that it was magic (which drug on throughout the whole movie)...Mr. Magorium kept on saying he was going to die (which made up about half of the movie)...Mahoney didn't believe him... he dies... Mahoney is too sad to take over the store... the little hat boy persistently tries to convince her to take the store... she finally does... the man believes that it's magic... the end. It just drug on forever... and Mahoney is a VERY stubborn person!

Not only this but there's not really that much of a plot... there doesn't exactly seem to be a target age range, considering that it deals with death (which doesn't settle well with 5-8 year olds), and it seems as if the movie makers were trying too hard to make it whimsical and magical and failed miserably (which doesn't suit the older audience that pay attention to those things in a movie).

Unlike many ""kid"" movies that try to appeal to adults, ""Mr. Magorium"" didn't resort to bathroom humor or slap-stick comedy, instead it is a story that focus' on our belief in ourselves and what we can do, without being religious, but being magical.  Perhaps the reason this movie is so good is that it is one of the few with A-list actors who give beautiful, fun performances that your family will enjoy over & over.",1208736000,2,651,4.311475409836065

3085796,3,B00128VA6C,"After seeing this film, I finally understand why it didn't do so well at the box office.  While there is a lot to recommend this movie to children, there isn't much here for adults.  When it came to it, I was reminded of Nanny McPhee versus Mary Poppins.  Nanny McPhee was a fun little movie, but it just didn't have the ""magic"" that Poppins had, and neither does Magorium match up to the wonder of Willy Wonka.  That said, it was an entertaining movie overall and I'm glad I saw it, but just as glad I didn't buy the DVD.

Mr. Magorium has decided it is time to depart, and wants an accountant to tell him the value of his store before he leaves it to his assistant, Mahoney.  The accountant, of course, manages to miss all the magic that happens in the store.  And the film wastes no time throwing the audience into the bright colors and wackiness that a living toy store, imbued with the spirit of children, must have.  There is a huge book out of which toys magically appear, a door that has a special dial to change what's on the other side, a room with the biggest dodge ball on earth - no one can dodge it! - a shelf full of stuffed toys literally reaching out to the people passing by (including one adorable sock monkey), and through it all Dustin Hoffman smiles benevolently upon the children.  Hoffman plays the part a little too over the top, but still manages to retain his charm.  But, there is no plot beyond this simple premise.  Mahoney is distraught when she learns Magorium's leaving and the store itself throws a temper tantrum.  Yet, there is an uplifting message behind it all that made this movie worth seeing.

Mahoney believes in the magic of the store, whole-heartedly.  Yet, she doesn't truly believe in herself.  The accountant gets befriended by a boy who collects hats, and together they must convince her she does have the magic to keep the store going.  This is a great film for younger children that are ready to move past animated films.  The CGI and special effects are pretty good, and the characters are all likeable.  Overall, I recommend seeing this film, but potential buyers should consider who they are buying it for.",1208304000,,2159,4.506426735218509

He has, however, been involved in a few clunkers. Things like the questionable&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sphere/dp/079073639X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sphere</a>&nbsp;and the stomach churning&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ishtar/dp/B000AAQ612/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ishtar</a>&nbsp;show that he needs to be a bit choosey when deciding on film roles. Which brings us to MR. MAGORIUM'S WONDER EMPORIUM...

Hoffman's portrayal of Mr. Magorium is pretty unique, if not sexually confusing; an unmarried 243-year-old man with a lisp and colorful outfits? {that was a joke, by the way} Mr. Hoffman does play the role very well. He was the shining star in an otherwise slipshod script.

The problems are many, but the biggies are the lack of secondary character development and an extremely rushed series of events, particularly the ending. Examples:

The movie packed zero emotional punch when a main character dies. Zach Mills (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hollywoodland/dp/B000KWZ7JC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hollywoodland</a>) who plays a vital role as the young and lonely Eric doesn't really shine, even when he tries to reach out to accountant Mark Loring (Jason Bateman,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Kingdom/dp/B000Y7WGOW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Kingdom</a>) and make friends. It is cute but that's about it.

Natalie Portman (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Darjeeling-Limited/dp/B0010X8NF0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Darjeeling Limited</a>) stars as Molly, the surprising heir-in-interest of this magical -- and alive -- emporium. But even Portman's tearful and soft face couldn't hold the story up. The short 93 minute run-time of the film allowed for minimal immersion into her character and the aforementioned rush to the finish.

Probably the most interesting character wasn't a character at all and had very little screen time (which was a shame because I wanted to know more about it). I'm speaking, of course, about the emporium building itself, which goes into a temper tantrum and dark mood when it learns that Mr. Magorium plans to ""leave.""

There are some interesting shots and ideas, however. The turning of a dial near a doorway produces different exit points when the door is opened. Toys come to life if they feel nearby emotion (fear, love, etc.). And the idea that someone must move on so that others can learn and become more human is cliche but came off okay if a bit forced.

The other good thing is that this film holds very little that would upset the parents of young kids. It's safe and visually appealing. But it doesn't allow for much else.",1207958400,,3297,6.854415274463007

Charming.  Brilliantly understated acting; not over the top in any way, no sterotypical characterizations.  Dustin Hoffman, Natalie Portman, Jason Bateman and child actor Zach Mills played true to their characters, filled with wonder, believable.

3085812,5,B00128VA6C,"This is a terrific family movie that is suitable for children of all ages.  There are, to a degree, some parallels with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Willy-Wonka-the-Chocolate-Factory-HD-DVD/dp/B000IXZ7M0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory [HD DVD</a>].  However, for the most part it is its own movie.  It centers around a man (played by Dustin Hoffman) who wishes to leave the management / ownership of his magical toy store to his favorite employee (portrayed by Natalie Portman) as he can sense that his end is near.  Unfortunately, Portman's character is apprehensive about taking over the toy store, mostly stemming from a lack of self-confidence.

To be sure, many will say that this film is predictable, and so it is.  However, the people who criticize it on such grounds are, I believe, missing the point.  Granted, there are no real ""hooks"" in the plot or plot-twists that will keep you guessing.  So what?  In a movie like this, it really doesn't matter.  At base, to me the film is not so much about the story itself as it is about how we all used to look upon the world with such  a sense of wonder when we were children.  People who are only looking for surprises are not prone to ""getting it"" insofar as this DVD is concerned.

The casting is terrific with Hoffmann and Portman leading the way.  Hoffmann gets his chance to play a sort of pseudo-Santa Clause, and it's evident that he enjoyed himself immensely.  I've always like Portman, and it's nice to see a young woman who is both a fine actress as well as a great person.  She is kind of the antipode to ""bad girls"" like Lindsay Lohan.

If you are the parent of small children, I'd highly recommend this film.  If you're not a parent of small children but enjoy feeling like a kid again, this one is recommended to an equal degree.",1205625600,36,1875,4.917197452229299
3085813,4,B00128VA6C,"OK, I didn't quite know what to make of this movie.  It has its charms.  Unlike some folks, I didn't mind Dustin Hoffman's choice of hair and lisp for Mr. Magorium.  The man is supposed to be more than two hundred years old, magical, and imbued with a childlike wonder of life.  Yet, the story really isn't about him.  The story is about Molly Mahoney, played by Natalie Portman (one of the actors I always enjoy).  She was a child prodigy on the piano who, the story says, played the Rachmaninoff Second Piano Concerto.  Yeah, right.  No one who could actually play that concerto as a child would ever find there way behind the counter of a toy store.  The sad history of prodigies does indicate a poor chance for her to progress into permanent pianistic stardom, but she would likely stay in music or head into some other intellectual profession.  Oh, and the kind of music the movie has her ""composing"" and playing is just absurd.  Portman's hands look as if they have had lessons and played the piano, but they are not hands strong enough or experienced enough for a big concerto.  As the Master Thespian used to declare, ""Acting!""

Magorium hires an accountant, a counting-mutant, to help him figure out what the store is worth since he has never even seen a receipt.  The hiring of Henry Weston (played by Jason Bateman - whom I also always enjoy) is one of the more delightful scenes in the movie.  Of course the store is in a state beyond disarray.  Magorium isn't big on explaining why he wants the Mutant (as he is affectionately called).  The other delightful character in the movie is Eric Applebaum (delightfully done by Zach Mills).  Eric is a lonely boy with amazing creativity, a superb collection of hats, and zero friends.  Given his personality that seems as impossible as Molly's playing Rachmaninoff.

The store Magorium runs is indeed magical, and we are given abundant evidence of it.  However, it understands Magorium's secret, as do some of the toys, and none are happy about it.  Magorium intends to give the store to Molly, who doesn't want it because she wants Magorium to stay.  He can't or won't.  The store turns entirely black after he goes and Molly intends to sell it.  But Eric and the Mutant want her to keep it.  The climax of the story, which is about the power of being aware of the magic that is your life and the power of believing in yourself, is whether or not Molly can bring the store to its former glory or whether she lets it slip away.  Take a big guess.

So, some of the things in the story didn't work for me.  I didn't like that no one has an actual complete family.  Magorium's history is largely never discussed nor is how he lived to be a couple of hundred years old.  We do learn about his delight in the kind of shoes wears.  Molly is alone except for the store (no boyfriend, fianc, mother, or father), Eric has a Mom but only because he is nine.  She doesn't do much except fret.  The Mutant is as alone and as detached Molly.  And the issue surrounding Magorium's decision actually makes no sense and has nothing of the weight such events have in real life.

Yet, my opinion of the movie changed when my five year old granddaughter watched it.  She was delighted and mesmerized and demanded to see it again immediately.  And she has watched it twice more since.  So, there is obviously something about the movie that is compelling to a small child that escapes me as an adult, deeply into the realities of life.  Hmmmm... take that for what you will and I added a star because of my grandchild's enthusiasm.  It is not a bad movie.  The special effects are a bit much.  However, it is successful for the kids.  Go with them, I guess.

Molly Mahoney (Natalie Portman) is the store manager, a former piano virtuoso ready to get back to her music career.  Mr. Magorium doesn't pay any attention to her, however, but brings in a mutant.  Okays, so it's really an accountant, but he figures the word derived from mutant at some point.  Henry Weston (Jason Bateman) is hired to find out just how much the store is worth.  See, Mr. Magorium has not kept records at all.  Fortunately, he has saved every receipt along the way.

Yet it's Eric Applebaum (Zach Mills), a nine year old hat collector with no friends, who first notices the problem. A wall of the store is turning dark and bubbling. Could Mr. Magorium's decision to leave be causing the problem? Will the store react poorly if he follows through?

This movie was marketed as a fun comedy fantasy.  From those ads, I was really looking forward to seeing it.  Unfortunately, the movie is much more serious then I was led to believe it would be.  While the theme of believing in yourself is wonderful, the melancholy tone made parts of it sadder then I was looking for.

Despite the disappointment in tone, there is much to praise.  There were several funny sight gags and great lines.  Most of these were in the previews, however.  This accountant got a huge kick out of the characters continually calling Henry ""Mutant.""  And don't miss Kermit the Frog's wonderful cameo.

3085831,4,B00128VA6C,"""Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium"" is a great and albeit odd family film.  It's odd in the sense that many alleged family films of late have been sprinkled with hints of vulgarity and innuendo.  So ""Magorium"" is great in the sense that there's none of that here.  This is an innocent family film that is fun and entertaining, even if its story seems on the sophmoric side.  The film's spirit makes up for it by leaps and bounds.

The story centers on Mahoney, played by Natalie Portman, who manages the store, but is an aspiring piano player who sees herself leaving the store soon.  She is friends with Eric, a boy who comes to the store but has no friends his own age.  Magorium, played with cartoon like precision by Dustin Hoffman, is looking to leave the store to Mahoney.  In the meantime, the store seems to be losing some of it's magic.

Part of the charm of this film is that it is pure fun.  The actors (especially Hoffman) look like they're having a good time and the pure magic of the toy store celebrates children and their imagination.  Coming from a child development background, I especially grinned at one of the lines where Mahoney remarks to a child that they don't have to stay in the lines when they color.  The effects and look of the store are neat.  While there are neat visual effects, a lot of the store's charm comes from creative use of sets and puppetry and, oh, a couple live animals here and there.

The film falters a bit in the story department.  It's an okay story.  Like many children's features though, it's short.  The conclusion seems rather rushed by the end of the film's 90 minute running time and I felt something was missing from the script. Some of the film's humor is spot on, while some of it rests on tired puns.  When that happens, we are at ease because of the performers' ability to deliver.

Overall, this is a fun family film.  It's a real shame that it did not do well in theatres as the film captures innocence and imagination better than a lot of recent family films.  Parents can rest assured that this film lives up to its G rating.  The film is cute and non threatening, and while the story may not break any ground in family entertainment, this is still a film that families can sit down and enjoy without worry.",1204588800,4,2269,4.443099273607748
3085832,5,B00128VA6C,"Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium champions classic toys and the stores that used to carry them before the proliferation of chain stores like Toys R Us and Wal-Mart made them virtually extinct. In this age of crass commercialism, this film celebrates idealism and imagination - things that our world so desperately needs.

Dustin Hoffman portrays Magorium as an optimistic Willy Wonka-type who is a genius toy maker and has a pet zebra in his home. He runs a magical toy store complete with an enormous book that lists the store's entire inventory and going to the appropriate page magically produces said toy. Each character has their own dilemma to resolve: Eric has to make a friend; Henry has to learn how to have fun, and Molly's desire to create music instead of running the Emporium. The cast is uniformly excellent, from Natalie Portman's engaging turn as Molly to Jason Bateman as the button-down accountant.

There is an absolutely charming scene where Henry and Eric communicate on opposite sides of a pane of glass via handwritten messages to the Cat Stevens' song, ""Don't Be Shy"" that demonstrates director Zach Helm's skill a visual storyteller. It was at this moment that I wondered if he is a fan of Hal Ashby's films as this song was used prominently in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harold-and-Maude/dp/6305882592/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harold and Maude</a>. This hunch was confirmed with Ashby's surname popping up in a scene as a store name. It is these little touches, like the nervous slinky or the gigantic dodge ball that fills an entire room or Magorium's hospital room at night decorated with many glow-in-the-dark stars, that make this film such a joy to watch.

He adopts a vibrant colour scheme with the larger shocks of colour being primary in nature and then the smaller details (toys and clothes) comprised of secondary and tertiary colours. For example, the hospital that Magorium stays in is dominated by golden yellows while warm, brown wood dominates the Emporium. The entire film is like a giant box of Crayola crayons exploded all over it.

Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium is not at all what I expected it to be (to be honest, I had little to no expectations) and was pleasantly surprised by how charming and imaginative this film turned out to be. It makes a convincing argument for keeping magic and wonderment alive. So often we grow up and either lose or ignore these feelings. There's more to life than dollars and sense. Mr. Magorium is a wonderful film that appeals to your heart without being so obviously manipulative and celebrates imagination over conformity. It also appeals to children with condescending to them and to adults who haven't forgotten what it's like to be a kid.

""Strangely Weird and Weirdly Strange: The Magical World of a Wonder Emporium"" is comprised of four featurettes that take brief looks at various aspects of the film. The first one features cast and crew praising director Zach Helm. Another takes a look at how the Sock Monkey puppet works. We also see how the production dealt with an actual zebra on the set. Finally, we see how the life-sized sculpture of President Abraham Lincoln was made entirely out of Lincoln Logs.

""An Eccentric Boss and An Awkward Apprentice"" takes a look at the characters of Mr. Magorium and Molly Mahoney. Not surprisingly, the actors were drawn to the project because of the well-written script. Cast and crew speak highly of Hoffman and Portman. The two actors describe their characters.

""To Meet Eric Applebaum, Start by Saying Hi"" takes a look at Eric and the actor who plays him, Zach Mills. Like the previous featurette, the character is described and the actor is praised. He was picked out of 1,200 other kids.

""The Magical Toy Store"" examines the fantastic set that was the toy store. Helm and the production designer worked together to create a big playground for kids. They wanted to create the impression that the store really existed. There's also footage of this set being constructed.

Finally, there is ""Fun on the Set,"" a montage of the cast and crew goofing around on and off the set.",1204502400,17,4157,5.004341534008683
3085833,5,B00128VA6C,"Mr Magorium's Wonder Emporium: Truly Wonderous!
It is a rare film that holds your attention hours after you see the credits roll. Mr Magorium is that, and more. It is, at its' core, a modern day parable that speaks to the power and magic of faith.
On the surface, Mr Magorium's Wonder Emporioum is a toy store for the ages. The children come into play in brightly lit corners stacked high with toys, games, books, and models. Rockets fly around the ceiling. A magical ball room transforms itself into an upstairs suite with the twist of a knob. The life of the store is reflected in the joy of the children and parents who enter the doors.
Mr Edward Magorium is dying. 243 years old, and his shoes are finally wearing out. As he explains to his assistant, Molly Mahoney, his last pair of shoes is wearing out and he knows that when they do, he will die. To prepare for the event, he hires an accountant, Henry Weston, to evaluate the value of the store and the contents. Magorium, names him Mutant, and throughout the whole film, Henry discovers the oddities that define a 200 year old man. $300,000 for a door knob (I've never paid more than $250,000). An IOU from the Thomas Edison. Century old toys. And a book keeping system that defies logic and belief. It's almost too much for a trained Mutant to bear!

Like a living being, the toy store ebbs and moves.  Cracks appear on the walls.  The life within the toys wanes and the atmosphere is less magical.  A young assistant, Eric Applebaum,
On the passing of Mr Magorium, the store 'dies' as well. But not before he presents a gift to Molly of a large block presumably possessing magical powers.  Unable to sustain the life of the store and business flow, Molly closes and prepares to sell much to the disappointment of Eric Applebaum, the young hat collector who works at the store.

When all is darkest, and Molly's dream of finishing her grand masterpiece, she discovers the missing piece to the puzzle.  When all is dark, and she is about to sign the store over, she discovers the magic behind the emporium.

""Move"" ""Move"" ""Fly...."" is all that is required when her journey to joy takes flight as her faith is renewed and the toy store explodes!  In one broad stroke, he symphony is complete, and the deadened toy store comes to life once more.

I said before this is a modern day parable, and I believe it is.  Beneath the toys lies the truth of the mustard seed. ""If I have faith as a mustard seed, I could say to the mountain, move, and it shall MOVE!""  And it does.

There are other themes too.  Joy in the journey.  Youth.  Living life to its' fullest.  Passing on of our faith.  Mourning.

Dustin Hoffman and Natalie Portman are wonderfully cast in this film.  The `mutant', Justin Bateman, plays a perfect straight man.

This is a true family film that is not fluff.  Talk about it. Watch it together.  Share it.  That's what the `parable of the toy store' is all about.

3085835,2,B00128VA6C,"If I had to assign one word to this movie, it would be ""heavy.""

I watched this movie with my 6 year old daughter. She was bored (though a good sport), and I expected a lot more magic and a greater feeling of wonder, particularly when in the toy store. I hadn't anticipated that death would be a constant vein throughout the movie. Also adding to the sense of sadness and loneliness was the element of misfits who find a friendship with each other that was unsettling itself in some ways. Finally, the most lighthearted moments (that is, the funniest parts of the movie) occurred when the store was throwing a temper tantrum (a bit of a mixed message for kids I think).

My daughter and I both were sad enough to tear up several times during the movie. (I'm certainly not opposed to children's movies that include death, for example, ""Where the Red Fern Grows,"" ""Old Yeller,"" and ""Charlotte's Web"" are all movies I watched in grade school and will have no qualms about showing my daughter.) Given though that we set out to watch a fun, magical show (based on the previews), I was disappointed when instead we left the movie feeling ""bummed.""

This movie may very well be a tool for opening communication with a child on death and the feelings of sadness, anger, fear, and then hope that are often associated with loss, but I do not recommend it if you are looking for a feel good or whimsical movie as I was.",1203811200,7,1408,4.470817120622568

My six year old sat enthralled through most of it given the emporium full of wonderful toys that Mr. Magorium had.  Unfortunately, for adults this is a dull, plodding movie that will test your patience throughout.  I expected much more from Hoffman and Portman, but they can only deliver on what has been handed them, and in this case it was more props than it was story, as Zach Helm made Mr. Magorium into a 243-year-old Mr. Gadget who no longer had any tricks up his sleeves and had decided to sign out.  The reason, as Mr. Magorium explains, is that he has come to the end of his last pair of Tuscan leather shoes and there is nowhere else to find them.  The film's fixation on death is a bit strange given that it seems aimed mostly at elementary age kids.  Sadly, the main characters are all such loners that they have a very hard time letting Mr. Magorium go, so we get endless attempts to forestall the event and a store that goes into a deep gray funk over the matter.  What little humor there is in the movie is parsed out in little cubes of sugar, seeming forced and contrite.  They could have at least found the toymaker extraordinaire an old shoe shop in New York that could fix his dilapidated shoes.  Poor Molly seems to have the hardest time, staring at a block of wood Mr. Magorium gave her, unable to unlock its magic power until the end, when everything is restored to glowing technicolor as it should be.

3319462,2,B00128VA6C,"""Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium"", the new film directed by Zach Helm (who wrote ""Stranger Than Fiction""), starring Dustin Hoffman, Natalie Portman and Justin Batemen, wants to be the next ""Willy Wonka"" but it has too little conflict, too little narrative and, most importantly, too little magic to make it the next Family classic.

Mr. Magorium (Dustin Hoffman sporting a haircut that looks like he was just riding a motorcycle and gelled into place and a strange lisp which is meant to make him seem childlike) is the owner of a strange and wonderful toy store in the middle of Manhattan. As soon as he opens the store everyday, the toys come to life and children stop by to play with the creatures all day every day. His store manager, Molly Mahoney (Natalie Portman) was once a promising concert pianist, but can not find the last notes to complete her first concerto. All day, every day, her fingers play the notes on an imaginary keyboard until she comes to the end and can no longer play the remainder. One day, Mr. Magorium announces he is leaving, and will leave the store to Molly. Because of this, he hires an accountant, Weston (Justin Bateman) to come in and figure out what the store is worth and to set the accounts in order. The narrator of the film, a young boy named Eric (Zach Mills) hangs around all day and observes everything, narrating the film much like a picture book, complete with chapters. And he has a hat collection, which provide an endless supply of unusual chapeaus for his head.

""Mr. Magorium"" tells a fairly simple story with relatively few characters. Each of these characters is awkward and uncomfortable with their place in the world, but Magorium is the only one who seems to embrace it. Hoffman's Magorium is a strange fellow who has a machine that dresses him in the morning, a zebra in his apartment, and a strange, wonderful store. He walks around with a wide-eyed innocence, despite claiming to be over one hundred years old. Hoffman certainly seems to be having fun playing the eccentric, but the performance just doesn't go far enough. There is little depth to the character. He owns this strange and wonderful shop and wants to leave it to Molly after he leaves, in a way, to help her. That's it. Despite some scenes of Magorium playing  with the kids in his shop, there are no other layers to his character. Everything else is mentioned in passing; he s over 100 years old, the reason he is leaving, etc. Just hearing these wild statements isn't really enough to make him strange and wonderful.

Also, because the film is rated `G', there is no possibility of making him even the slightest bit dark. In ""Willy Wonka"" and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", both Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp made it clear, in subtle and unsubtle ways, Wonka doesn't really like kids. He then puts the bad kids through their paces, trying to find out who should take over his empire. In just about any great Family film, there is some sort of darkness, some sort of menace. In ""Magorium"", the only darkness comes when the store seems to miss Magorium's presence. Because he isn't around, everything turns black and gray, waiting for someone to reawaken the spirit and flavor of the magic it once knew.

But this isn't enough to provide anything but a mildly pleasant diversion.

Molly appears to be that person, the person who will take over the shop. Magorium's trusted manager, she knows many of the secrets and loves working there, meeting all of the (remarkably) well-behaved children. But when Magorium first mentions he will be leaving, and why, she is unsettled. What will happen to her career as a composer? What happened to the promise of her performances as a pianist? She still has hope, because she reflexively plays the piano with her hand all day. But taking over the store seems like it will definitely close the chapter on one part of her life.

Natalie Portman is a good choice for this role because she has a wide-eyed innocence about her that lending itself well to the character. But she is just kind of bland. She loves working for Magorium and loves the store. There is a slight amount of conflict when the accountant (Bateman) shows up. See, he doesn't believe in the store and this irks her to no end. But because the film is rated `G', there isn't even any possibility of a romantic relationship between them.

Strangely, Eric and Weston become friends. Eric is a strange, lonely kid who finds solace at Magorium's store. He has no friends, and his mother worries about him, but he enjoys lending a hand. So what if he sees some kids playing with Lincoln Logs and the urge strikes him to build a lifelike statue of Lincoln using the Logs. Every day he comes to the store, he is wearing a different hat and he seems to enjoy the eccentricity. He believes wholeheartedly in the magic of Magorium's Wonder Emporium.

Weston, played by Justin Bateman, is an accountant and doesn't believe in the store. He is there to set the records in order and he has a lot of work to do. Because he doesn't believe, Molly can barely tolerate him. Because he doesn't believe, Eric feels the need to help him realize the magic. Gradually, they become friends and talk and Weston asks about the hat collection. Eric offers to take him home and show him the collection and Weston is simply amazed; every wall of his room is covered in hats. They begin to play pirates and Eric's mother comes home to find them jumping around on the bed. Hmmmmmmm.

Naturally, Molly will realize two things. She will realize how to bring Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium back to life and she will realize how to complete her concerto. Will they be related?

But before this happens, we have to sit through a veeeeerrrrrryyyyyy slow second act in which she decides to sell the store and entertains offers from other people, because her first inclination is to get rid of the store.

This is a unique movie.  The plot is relatively simple - Toy Store Owner prepares his assistant to take over the business.  There is no villain in the form of a character.  I suppose the ""villain,"" or conflict in the plot, is ""lack of imagination.""  This is initially personified in the form of a dry, by-the-books accountant, however this character is by no means the villain in this story.  ""Lack of imagination"" is the force opposing Mr. Magorium and his whimsical store.

I suspect that mainstream America and the critics didn't respond favorably to this movie for two reasons:  marketing this movie was difficult; and much of mainstream America and the critics are guilty of exhibiting the same element that served as the conflict in the movie:  ""lack of imagination.""

For example, in one scene, the witless accountant finally gives in to others' use of imagination and tries being imaginative himself by wearing silly hats and pretending to be someone else.  He and a young boy act out fairy tale stories and let their imagination run wild.  The boy's mother discovers them and is immediately suspicious of the accountant's intentions.  It's as if the movie is commenting on some people that perhaps don't ""get it.""  Additionally, as if life were imitating art, there were some people that didn't ""get"" this movie.

My family (with two kids aged 6 and 3) thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and we could comfortably watch it without fear of ""toilet gags"" and without anxiety of seeing crude/vulgar moments.  And this movie also effectively addressed the potentially disturbing subject of ""death.""  I liked the approach here.

Like the characters in the movie, give Mr. Magorium a chance.  And let your imagination flow with the movie.

Favorite line:  ""Light bulbs die.  I am departing.""",1200787200,24,1822,4.983388704318937
3319464,5,B00128VA6C,"Perception is everything in this world. The story of Mr. Magorium is partly one of the archetypal American legend who inspired a generation to carry on dreaming. It is significant that Kermit makes an appearance in the film as Jim Henson was one such figure who may well, have inspired the films philosophy. Few men of his generation were so influential to the children of the world and these men like Magorium set an example not by what they said so much but by what they did with their lives. Inspiration reverberates for generations and the wisdom which comes from that inspiration will hopefully always lead us towards the lights until ultimately we have a legacy like Magorium's to pass on. This idea of finding faith in past childhood wisdom in order to regain direction in ones life is largely the journey Molly Mahoney must grasp in the film until she understands the strength of her perception and how she can do some good in this world.

This film was an unexpected highlight over the holiday period. My whole family enjoyed it and will be one for the collection when it finally comes out. The cast performances, as you might expect are a class act and the story was very heartening. I strongly recommend this film and I'd say, pay no attention to superficial comparisons to the Wonka movie!",1199923200,,1301,4.681222707423581

3319466,4,B00128VA6C,"This gentle show gives us slices of life, death, friendship, loss and renewal all in a magical setting.  Granted, it is formulaic, but in a way that's not tedious.

Mr. Magorium (Hoffman), who reminded me a little of Ed Wynn's Uncle Albert in ""Mary Poppins,"" owns a living, magical store full of colorful, magical toys that children love.  He's never kept tabs on profit or loss, has items and signatures from people who lived up to hundreds of years ago, and is now about to ""leave.""  He wishes to pass the store on to Mahoney (Portman), much to her dismay.  She sees  herself as a failure in her chosen field and entirely unsuited to run a magic store.  And, because she loves Mr. Magorium (who is also ""Not Steve""), is heartbroken at the same time.  The child-like Magorium will not be swayed from his appointed hour, however.

To further the crisis, the store itself throws a temper tantrum at Magorium's planned exit and loses all of its color and magic after his death.  Mahoney, with accountant Henry (nicknamed ""Mutant,"" which I found funny all movie long) and store gofer Eric, must set about restoring things after a mandatory crisis of faith.  She wants to sell the store, sort of.

It is the dry and dusty accountant who finally sees the light, that the store must not be sold off, and helps Mahoney to realize her destiny with the help of a magical block of wood.  Of course the beauty and magic of the store and its furnishings are restored.

Will Mahoney also live 243 years, and somehow keep that quaint old building (sandwiched between skyscrapers) intact, open, and safe from modern government regulations?  Who knows?  But forget the newspaper review if it was like the one I read. This is a pleasant little movie that worked its magic not only on me, but even on my G-rated-movie-hating teenager who loves shoot-'em up shows and video games.

3319467,4,B00128VA6C,"This movie is great for kids and kids at heart.  They did a very good job of portraying a whimsical magical toy store full of neat things that come alive.  When the toy store was content, it was quite colorful and enjoyable to behold.  When the toy store was down in the dumps, its color changed to a drab grey to reflect that.  It also had a temper tantrum and went from an orderly organized toy store to a disorganized messy chaotic toy store.  You see, the toy store had a personality too, and it was upset that Mr. Magorium (played by Dustin Hoffman) was leaving.  He was leaving the store to Molly Mahoney (played by Natalie Portman), but she didn't want the store at first.  She thought that only Mr. Magorium could effectively run the store because he was full of magic.  Only later does she find out that she has magic herself too with the help of an unlikely character, Henry Weston the accountant (played by Jason Bateman).  She magically puts the toy store back in order, and accepts Mr. Magorium's offer.  All in all a very fun movie with touching moments that your kids can see too.  It leaves you with a sunny feeling in your heart.",1196294400,,1146,4.40952380952381
3319468,2,B00128VA6C,"For a film focusing heavily on believing in magic, Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium is surprisingly devoid of the magic of moviemaking. Several clich characters and a story missing any real conflict produces a whimsically dreary tale best reserved for the young at heart and absent of mind. While its target audience will likely find plenty to enjoy in the Emporium, fans of Hoffman and Portman will want to wait for more meaningful ventures.

Narrated by young Eric (Zach Mills) and told like a storybook complete with chapters, Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium tells the tale of exactly that. The eccentric 243-year-old toy aficionado (Dustin Hoffman) runs a magical toy store with little care in the world. But when he decides it's time to depart from this life and wills the store to Molly Mahoney (Natalie Portman), the Emporium's manager and only other employee (save for the strange circus reject living in the basement), she questions her ability to handle such promotion and determines to make Magorium realize all the fun he would be leaving behind. Meanwhile, Magorium has hired Henry (Jason Bateman) to sort out the mess of receipts and legal requirements of running a business, and it's up to Eric (and a mystical wooden cube) to show both the stuffy accountant and the insecure Molly the magic of believing in yourself.

Deceptively opening with Pixar-esque cutout animation during its credits, such frills are the only thing Magorium has in common with the ever-entertaining computer animated films. Stocked with unremarkable characters, the situations they are confronted with range from death to disbelief, though rarely do we feel attached enough to care. The conflicts never feel immediate and the solutions don't stay grounded in reality. Perhaps the most pressing predicament is a saddened, personified toy store quickly losing its color, or a mopey sock monkey without someone to hold.

Magorium has an impressive cast in likely their least impressive performances. Dustin Hoffman as the gray-haired, bushy-eyebrowed title character grates on the nerves rather quickly with his too-cheerful quips and contrived speech impediment. If Willy Wonka wasn't cool, and owned a toy store instead of a chocolate factory, he'd be Mr. Magorium. Natalie Portman is believable as a cheery toy store manager, and even as a piano prodigy, but rarely does she evoke any emotions from her audience other than regret for not watching her other, better roles. Jason Bateman fits as the workaholic accountant who needs to believe in magic for others to believe in themselves, but too little focus is placed on his character development. He's not an antagonist and no one needs to work all that hard to make a believer out of him. In fact, there is no villain in this film at all, unless the sandman's gritty fingers reaching for your eyelids counts.

While rather languid in the story department, the effects and set designers likely had a field day with the living Emporium, piled high with all manner of games and toys. Animated mobiles, graying walls, and a monstrous dodgeball highlight the special effects, and what wasn't computer generated appeared painstakingly crafted. The dial that changes the rooms of the store also added to the creative feats, though its too bad Miyazaki showcased the concept in Howl's Moving Castle several years earlier.

If one tried very hard they might be able to sink into the magical world of Mr. Magorium and his living toy store, and at times might even realize the important lessons on display, from believing in yourself to the value of friendship. But flying wooden cubes and sad sock puppets mixed with Shakespearean quotes and misbehaved zebras will probably make you forget about such trivial morals.

3319469,2,B00128VA6C,"""Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium"", the new film directed by Zach Helm (who wrote ""Stranger Than Fiction""), starring Dustin Hoffman, Natalie Portman and Justin Batemen, wants to be the next ""Willy Wonka"" but it has too little conflict, too little narrative and, most importantly, too little magic to make it the next Family classic.

Mr. Magorium (Dustin Hoffman sporting a haircut that looks like he was just riding a motorcycle and gelled into place and a strange lisp which is meant to make him seem childlike) is the owner of a strange and wonderful toy store in the middle of Manhattan. As soon as he opens the store everyday, the toys come to life and children stop by to play with the creatures all day every day. His store manager, Molly Mahoney (Natalie Portman) was once a promising concert pianist, but can not find the last notes to complete her first concerto. All day, every day, her fingers play the notes on an imaginary keyboard until she comes to the end and can no longer play the remainder. One day, Mr. Magorium announces he is leaving, and will leave the store to Molly. Because of this, he hires an accountant, Weston (Justin Bateman) to come in and figure out what the store is worth and to set the accounts in order. The narrator of the film, a young boy named Eric (Zach Mills) hangs around all day and observes everything, narrating the film much like a picture book, complete with chapters. And he has a hat collection, which provide an endless supply of unusual chapeaus for his head.

""Mr. Magorium"" tells a fairly simple story with relatively few characters. Each of these characters is awkward and uncomfortable with their place in the world, but Magorium is the only one who seems to embrace it. Hoffman's Magorium is a strange fellow who has a machine that dresses him in the morning, a zebra in his apartment, and a strange, wonderful store. He walks around with a wide-eyed innocence, despite claiming to be over one hundred years old. Hoffman certainly seems to be having fun playing the eccentric, but the performance just doesn't go far enough. There is little depth to the character. He owns this strange and wonderful shop and wants to leave it to Molly after he leaves, in a way, to help her. That's it. Despite some scenes of Magorium playing  with the kids in his shop, there are no other layers to his character. Everything else is mentioned in passing; he s over 100 years old, the reason he is leaving, etc. Just hearing these wild statements isn't really enough to make him strange and wonderful.

Also, because the film is rated `G', there is no possibility of making him even the slightest bit dark. In ""Willy Wonka"" and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", both Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp made it clear, in subtle and unsubtle ways, Wonka doesn't really like kids. He then puts the bad kids through their paces, trying to find out who should take over his empire. In just about any great Family film, there is some sort of darkness, some sort of menace. In ""Magorium"", the only darkness comes when the store seems to miss Magorium's presence. Because he isn't around, everything turns black and gray, waiting for someone to reawaken the spirit and flavor of the magic it once knew.

But this isn't enough to provide anything but a mildly pleasant diversion.

Molly appears to be that person, the person who will take over the shop. Magorium's trusted manager, she knows many of the secrets and loves working there, meeting all of the (remarkably) well-behaved children. But when Magorium first mentions he will be leaving, and why, she is unsettled. What will happen to her career as a composer? What happened to the promise of her performances as a pianist? She still has hope, because she reflexively plays the piano with her hand all day. But taking over the store seems like it will definitely close the chapter on one part of her life.

Natalie Portman is a good choice for this role because she has a wide-eyed innocence about her that lending itself well to the character. But she is just kind of bland. She loves working for Magorium and loves the store. There is a slight amount of conflict when the accountant (Bateman) shows up. See, he doesn't believe in the store and this irks her to no end. But because the film is rated `G', there isn't even any possibility of a romantic relationship between them.

Strangely, Eric and Weston become friends. Eric is a strange, lonely kid who finds solace at Magorium's store. He has no friends, and his mother worries about him, but he enjoys lending a hand. So what if he sees some kids playing with Lincoln Logs and the urge strikes him to build a lifelike statue of Lincoln using the Logs. Every day he comes to the store, he is wearing a different hat and he seems to enjoy the eccentricity. He believes wholeheartedly in the magic of Magorium's Wonder Emporium.

Weston, played by Justin Bateman, is an accountant and doesn't believe in the store. He is there to set the records in order and he has a lot of work to do. Because he doesn't believe, Molly can barely tolerate him. Because he doesn't believe, Eric feels the need to help him realize the magic. Gradually, they become friends and talk and Weston asks about the hat collection. Eric offers to take him home and show him the collection and Weston is simply amazed; every wall of his room is covered in hats. They begin to play pirates and Eric's mother comes home to find them jumping around on the bed. Hmmmmmmm.

Naturally, Molly will realize two things. She will realize how to bring Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium back to life and she will realize how to complete her concerto. Will they be related?

But before this happens, we have to sit through a veeeeerrrrrryyyyyy slow second act in which she decides to sell the store and entertains offers from other people, because her first inclination is to get rid of the store. Naturally, after working with Magorium for years, learning all about his store, his passions, his life, her first inclination is to sell the store. I'm being sarcastic. This moment seems completely false. All it shows is that Molly has learned nothing from Magorium.

And perhaps we haven't either.",1196035200,3,6193,4.681985294117647
3319470,5,B00128VA6C,"I love first run movies.  No home theatre system can replace the smell of popcorn, the wall of video and sound of a real theatre--but with the rising cost, I see them on matinee and I rarely ever see a film twice in the theatre.

If my companion had agreed to turn around and see ""Mr. Magorium"" again, I would have done so.  I do plan on taking some friends to see this film--a retread for me but it'll be a treat to see their reactions as the plot unfolds.

""Mr. Magorium's Magic Emporium"" is a 100 year old magical toy store that's about to see some changes.  You see, Mr. Magorium (Dustin Hoffman), the 243 year old proprieter has just run out of his last pair of shoes that he'd selected to 'last the rest of his life' and he's going to move on. (Note--he didn't say 'die' batteries do that)

Eric Applebaum (Zach Mills) is a young boy who collects hats, but only made one friend at summer camp.  ""Jeff"" turned out to be a squirrel.  He's the narrator of this story and a frequent visitor to Mr. Magorium's.

Molly Maloney (Natalie Portman) is the manager of the emporium and the Magorium's unsuspecting heir.  Mahoney is just marking time at Magorium's--she was a musical prodigy, but at 23 feels washed up because she can't get her music quite right. She's surprised when the boss calls in an accountant--they've never had one. Magorium keeps it secret from her that he's doing this to value his bequest to Mahoney.

That's where Henry Weston comes in.  He's a ""Just"" man as Mahoney puts it. It's ""just a""--toy store, car, etc.  No magic in him.

When Magorium does move on, it's up to the three of them to ressucitate a place that's lost all the color in it.  It takes a wooden cube and a whole lot of belief to make that happen.

I'll certainly buy this DVD when it becomes available and see it periodically, because it is a geniune 'feel good' movie without drowning you in excess sucrosity.  The animation was delightful and I was especially moved to see Kermit the Frog make a cameo appearance as a Magorium customer.",1195948800,7,2028,4.437837837837838
3319471,4,B00128VA6C,"What a charming movie ""Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium"" is; here's a film that's delightful, fun, and touching without getting too sentimental. Not that the story is free from sentiment--many key moments tap into a number of emotions, many of which we thought we had abandoned long ago. Watching this film, my belief in the power of positive thinking was refreshed, and I'll thank you to not make fun of me for saying something so hokey. Much like the toy store owned by the eccentric yet loveable Edward Margorium, the film thrives on magic and whimsy, with a plot that instills a positive message without getting sappy. It was thoroughly delightful to watch something so upbeat.

Some have dismissed this film as being a watered down rehash of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."" I do understand how that comparison can be made; both films include oddball lead characters and magical, kid-friendly environments. Nonetheless, ""Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium"" stands on its own, having the power to entrance its audience with a meaningful story, humorous characters, and a wealth of creative special effects. Basically, it feels as bright and colorful as it looks, and we begin to feel joyous as soon as the opening credits begin to roll. Immediately after that, a voiceover narration introduces us to Bellini (Ted Ludzik), the bookmaker for Mr. Magorium's toyshop and his personal historian. From this, we learn that the film will be divided into chapters, each one covering the events that led to big changes.

The most important character, obviously, is Mr. Magorium (Dustin Hoffman), a 243-year-old free spirit who operates a living toy store. Behind certain doors, rooms can change with the flick of a switch. An inventory book can produce a toy in the blink of an eye. Toys are able to operate on their own. Balls bounce by themselves. A mobile has living fresh-water fish hanging from strings. Stuffed animals reach out and beg to be hugged. The store's manager is Molly Mahoney (Natalie Portman), an incredibly insecure young woman desperate to find her purpose in life. A marvelous pianist, she's unable to escape the world of prewritten music; she wants to compose an original piece. But something is holding her back, something strong enough to leave her frustrated while sitting behind a keyboard. She knows there's more to herself, but she doesn't know what it is or how to free it. As happy as she is working for Mr. Magorium, she feels stuck.

After running the shop for over one hundred years, Mr. Magorium decides that it's time to leave (and I won't get more specific than that). To sort out the financial details--of which he had never given any thought to--he hires an accountant named Henry Weston (Jason Bateman). He's immediately given the nickname Mutant, not only because Mr. Magorium believes it's the suffix to ""accountant,"" but also because he's an uptight workaholic that doesn't believe in magic. From his point of view, nothing extraordinary happens in the store; it's a place where kids buy things, and nothing more. Mahoney says he sees everything in terms of the word ""just""--it's ""just"" a toy store, and it ""just"" sells ordinary things. Doing paperwork and talking business is all he knows how to do, which is why he thinks nothing of pointing out suspicious financial activity to Mr. Magorium. Example: when Mutant addresses doing business with imaginary characters like the King of Planet Yahweh, Mr. Magorium says, ""Oh, he's not imaginary. He was never a king, and Planet Yahweh doesn't exist, but he's real.""

Frequenting the store is nine-year-old Eric Applebaum (Zach Mills), who also serves as the film's narrator. I loved this character; he's articulate and witty, and in some ways, he's just as eccentric as Mr. Magorium. For one thing, he has an impressive hat collection, and he wears a different one every single day. He can also build a life-sized state of Abraham Lincolm out of Lincoln Logs. But as approachable as he seems, he has absolutely no friends, save for Mahoney and Mr. Magorium. They both pressure him to be more outgoing, but he holds himself back because everyone his age has labeled him as weird and unlikable. He finally begins to engage Mutant, who gradually relearns how to have some fun. There's a wonderful scene in which they have a conversation through a window; they communicate by writing messages on pieces of paper and holding them up.

Mr. Magorium tells Mahoney that, upon his departure, she'll be the sole owner of the Wonder Emporium. Her self-confidence plummets--how can she operate a business without the man who started it? And what if she doesn't want to be the owner? What if she wants to pursue a career in music? The store itself also takes the news pretty badly, as seen when it's bright red walls turn gray and the toys go berserk. Much like an infant child, it throws a temper tantrum, forcing Mr. Magorium to temporarily close the store. Even for a man that owns a pet zebra and actually helped Thomas Edison invent the light bulb, this is simply too bizarre; everything must be smoothed out before he leaves, and in order for that to happen, he has to have the full cooperation of the store, of Mahoney, and of Mutant.

There are many, many subtler nuances that make ""Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium"" a truly enjoyable film, such as a machine that dresses people, a living dinosaur skeleton made of wood, and a cameo appearance by Kermit the Frog. But what I enjoyed the most was its emotional core; I actually felt happy when I left the theater, not only because I had watched a fun film, but also because it actually resonated with me on a deeper level. This is an enchanting story--I recommend it to everyone, young and old alike.",1195516800,3,5724,4.865641025641025

3319590,5,B00128VA6C,"I am amazed by the unbelievably DENSE comments and reviews I've read, apparently written by folks who have completely missed the point.
These people did not have the courage for 90 short minutes to suspend their cynicism, disbelief, and cowardly need for proof or substantiation of every little thing. (Big ol' raspberry to them!)
A kid's movie? ""Just"" for children? Heck no. Rather, this movie is ""just"" for those, regardless of physical age, who have been fortunate enough to retain any portion of their own childlike -- notice, I did not say childISH -- appreciation and pure unclouded understanding of wonder, simplicity, love, and of magic found in the everyday.

3319604,4,B00128VA6C,"It's such a kid's movie. What I refer to as a Manhattan Kid's Movie. It just feels like the kind of story that was made with the elite Manhattan children in mind. That being said, it also holds an innocent charm that I think we lose as we age. I'm glad to say I have been able to hold onto that spark for all these years and this movie renews it. Yes it's ridiculous. Yes, it's perposterous. It's also disarmingly charming and there is an endearing quality to Dustin Hoffman's performance. Jason Bateman can just make anything good. He doesn't seem to fail at that and Natalie Portman has a real sparkle.",1473292800,,604,4.401785714285714

3319646,5,B00128VA6C,"This is one of my daughter's and I favorite movies to watch together. I didn't watch it when it first came out and surprisingly, it was my daughter who discovered this movie.

It is the quintessential family movie.  It's rated ""G"" which I'm ashamed to say I equate with ""boring""! I couldn't be more wrong when it came to this movie.
It's a wonderful movie for the whole family.  Me, my tween daughter ,my teenage son and even my 40 something year old husband  all really liked it.  I'm really shocked that when this was released in 2007 it didn't do very well or make much money.

It's basically about believing in yourself and having self confidence.  Natalie Portman (who I happen to believe is a suburb actress) is perfectly cast as Mahoney, the store manager,  a former child pianist who doesn't believe in herself.  She works for Mr. Magorium,played by a DELIGHTFUL  Dustin Hoffman, who is the childlike Santa  Claus-esque 243 year old owner of the Toy store.  He decides to give the store to Mahoney who doesn't feel she I can do it.  In preparation of this change in ownership, he hires an accountant (Jason Bateman).

As I said this a great little movie, Perfect for children of all ages.  It has a great story, awesome actors and it's just a nice way to pass some time .",1461974400,,1279,4.5

I remember the movie wasn't bad, it's kid friendly and not completely boring for adults....plus there is a sock monkey scene and I have an unhealthy obsession with sock monkeys. Right up until the end of the movie.....when it became silly and I just had to cut it off and move on. Great for households with kids under, let's say 7.

3319696,4,B00128VA6C,"I think kids will like this. It's a story about a really old man, who is quite childlike, who owns a toy store. He decides that it's his time to go, so he wills the store to his clerk. Unfortunately, this is a magic toy store and the clerk doesn't believe she has any magic to keep the store going.

Jason Bateman is the stand out in this production - probably because he's the straight man. Everyone else is a bit wacky. He does have a scene where he gets childlike where he's completely different. That is worth watching.

The little kid is also adorable. I'd expect more from Hoffman and Portman being that they are the lead actors and that they are both really good actors. They were kind of over the top for me. I think kids won't notice though.

As far as the story itself, it was sweet. I think it will either grow on you and you will love it more and more, or you will just watch it once and not need to watch it again. Still, it's worth seeing at least once.",1449014400,,967,4.132978723404255

There is magic in all of us, but we need to want to find it. Dustin Hoffman's and Natalie Portman's performances were great. Even though the film is primarily for children I thought that it was meant for all ages because if we really wish to find happiness in life, it does not matter how old we are. Mr. Magorium served his purpose until his very last day, and he did not lose his happiness.

3319937,4,B00128VA6C,"A children's fantasy, all about a sense of wonder and active magic in a huge toy store that is alive and has feelings. Magorium is getting old, he is 243 years old and senses that his apprentice is stuck so he dies to push her along. Molly Mahoney doesn't feel she has the skills or sense to run a magical toy store, yet she knows it is magical, as she tells the accountant Henry, who is even more mundane and buttoned up. It is a learns-better story, an opening up to active magic, finding a connection. But old wizard Magorium has to die to teach  Molly and Henry what is magic. A sense of wonder, but a sweet children's story. Not quite Mary Poppins but still a better story than expected. If I had been 5 years old at the time I would have been overwhelmed with joy at it. Nowadays I don't got so enthralled with a fantasy movie unless it is slightly more adult in nature (for example, Stardust, Monkeybone, Who Framed Roger Rabbit). This film has a magnificent and very impressive set of thousands and thousands of toys---all alive. There is a symbiotic connection between the store and Mr. Magorium (who resembles Merlin in many ways). When Magorium dies the store goes deep into depression, when it feels Magorium is going to go away it has a temper tantrum.
  The cast choice is a surprise. Why Dustin Hoffman? And Natalie Portman? I don't think they were right for the parts. Definitely a film for small children. It has parallels with Miracle on 34th Street-- in which skeptics develop a sense of the magical in a subtle way. Also a zen feeling of wisdom is learned by the those skeptics. Molly learns that a block of wood that Magorium gave to her isn't a block of wood, but a symbol of her potential to activate things and move toys.",1399680000,,1745,4.429906542056075

Mr. Magorium does die at the end, and he does die voluntarily which had both of my kids in tears and asking me whether or not he committed suicide.  Yikes.  I said that, first of all, this is a movie, not real life, and secondly, Mr. Magorium was a magical being, kind of like an angel, and I think he just decided his work on earth was done and that it was time for him to go back up to heaven for a while.

As for children, when I recorded it on my dvr, my grandchildren went nuts!  They were so thrilled.  Then of course, they invited their friends to watch it and they got hooked.  It's a really neat movie for people who are open to a clean, fun, child-like fantasy world.  A fair comparison would be ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" as far as how it excites and appeals to a child's imagination of what they wish could really happen.",1385942400,,579,4.572815533980583

3319999,5,B00128VA6C,"It is probably the sweetest movie I have ever stumbled upon. The first time I watched this movie a few years back my dad made us all sit down together and watch the whole thing. I thought it was the weirdest show I had ever seen and vowed never to watch it again. About 2 years later I watched it with him once more and (since I actually payed attention this time) fell completely in love with it.
  It is the most innocent, happy, heart-warming movie I have seen probably ever. While I admit that the special effects are not the best, the message is inspiring and beautiful. I felt rather like Mahoney at the time I watched it (stuck and low on courage in myself) and it struck close to my heart. Since then I have bought the soundtrack, which I listen to every night when I fall asleep, learned to play much of it on the piano, and watched the movie every time I ever feel down or in need of something peaceful. Everything about it fills you with a sense of love and happiness.
  It is my all time favorite movie.

This is not Lawrence of Arabia, it's a light-hearted fantasy film that you can enjoy if you stop asking ""how"" or ""why"".  I've spent more time trying to write this review because I want you to give this overlooked film a chance.

3320018,5,B00128VA6C,"Dustin Hoffman plays Mr. Edward Magorium, the owner of the magical toy store rightfully named Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium. I'm not a huge fan of the movie because of the magic. It's not the witty lines, the family-friendliness or even the character I identify most with, Natalie Portman's Molly Mahoney. It's Mr. Magorium.

Molly Mahoney (Natalie Portman)
  I identify most with Molly Mahoney because she also plays piano. The song she knew best as a child is still, today, the only song she can perform. She feels stuck - or unable to go further with her talent, skills, etc. in life. She believes more in others than herself. She has a very difficult time saying goodbye. I share all of this with Mahoney so that when Mr. Magorium is there for her, it feels like he's speaking to me too.

Mr. Magorium (Dustin Hoffman)
  Mr. Magorium is 243 years old and preparing to ""depart."" He explains that a light bulb dies, but he...shall depart. A beautiful way to look at a sad situation. He plans to give the toy store to Mahoney upon his departure, but Mahoney simply can't take the responsibility because she doesn't believe in herself. Mr. Magorium spends a good amount of time encouraging Mahoney and Eric (a shy, hat-collecting boy who struggles making friends but helps out at the store). He tries to impart wisdom and encouragement to them both so they will believe in themselves and embrace the bravery he knows they need in life's journey.

  I cry when Mr. Magorium departs. My heart pours from my tear ducts and I can't help but feel sad. When Mr. Magorium is saying his farewell to Mahoney, he explains:

""When King Lear dies in Act V, do you know what Shakespeare has written? He's written ""He dies."" That's all, nothing more. No fanfare, no metaphor, no brilliant final words. The culmination of the most influential work of dramatic literature is ""He dies."" It takes Shakespeare, a genius, to come up with ""He dies."" And yet every time I read those two words, I find myself overwhelmed with dysphoria. And I know it's only natural to be sad, but not because of the words ""He dies."" but because of the life we saw prior to the words.

I've lived all five of my acts, Mahoney, and I am not asking you to be happy that I must go. I'm only asking that you turn the page, continue reading... and let the next story begin. And if anyone asks what became of me, you relate my life in all its wonder, and end it with a simple and modest 'He died.'""

  His final line to Mahoney is, ""Your life is an occasion. Rise to it."" By this point, I'm an emotional wreck. I've watched this movie a thousand times, and it was just recently I finally figured out why it is that I can't accept the departure of Mr. Magorium or any of my loved ones in real life. I can't imagine a world without my loved ones in it - the world is the magical place it is because they're here, now, with me. I can't make up for their absence and can't recreate the magic they've blessed the world with. The idea of them no longer living life with me is overwhelming and I'm not ready to accept it. I'm not sure if I ever will be, but I know I will always turn to this movie in difficult times to find a spark of encouragement, a light of hope and a few rays of sunshine to part my dark clouds.

""We must face tomorrow, whatever it may hold, with determination, joy and bravery.""

3320035,5,B00128VA6C,"I started being a Natalie Portman fan when I saw Beautiful Girls, but haven't followed her that much after she was in the Star Wars films. But among all her movies, I like this one the best, as a fun movie to watch. It's a movie about a toy store, and toys make people happy. But there are some sad parts in this movie too, and as an adult, I even got choked up, so I just want to warn the kids that they might cry watching the sad parts. But it is intended for kids as I think it's rated G, so it must be deemed not intense when dealing with the sad themes. Maybe it's just I'm too sensitive. The kid in the movie does a real good job and is very likeable, even though his character is suppose to have no friends. Great special effects too. But if you are a Dustin Hoffman fan or Natalie Portman fan, this is a fun movie that I don't remember having much fanfare. I'm happy I discovered this movie.",1369180800,,899,4.027932960893855

At times, I felt like the movie moved slowly or threw the ""believe in yourself"" message at me too often--something I might have minded less if the makers hadn't simultaneously added in a clever word play about the King of Planet Yahweh, but ""there is no king, and Yahweh (another name for God) doesn't exist.""

3320174,5,B00128VA6C,"Mr Magorium's Wonder Emporium is a wonderful addition to any movie collection.  This story illustrates how you have to believe in order to succeed.  In the story Mr. Magorium's toy store is as magical as Mr. Magorium himself.  He has a door of rooms, a magical book that can locate any toy in the store, a man who lives in the basement who helps with all the books and so much more.  The time has come for Mr. Magorium to leave this life and move on to the next, unfortunately this makes the toy store very upset.  The store starts to ""throw a tantrum"" at the very idea of having to exist without their owner.  Now Mr. Magorium needs someone to take over the store and keep the store happy, only the young lady he has chosen doesn't believe in herself.

I loved sharing this story with my two kids.  We enjoyed watching the toy store come to life.  The imagination that went into the story is fabulous.  If I didn't know better, I would think a child had written the story.  It made me want to be a kid again (or at least act like one!)

3320182,3,B00128VA6C,"This movie was ordered on an impulse; I'd heard some good things about it and decided to try it out. After watching it once, I had not seen it when it was released in the theaters; it impressed me as a moderately charming fantasy if you were prepared to accept its assumptions.

This is true of most movies and I usually don't have too much trouble doing that but this time it just didn't seem to work as well for me. The production of the movie seemed too formulaic, the impression is they were just trying too hard to make it work and it just didn't quite come off right. Too many aspects of the movie were just a little bit over the top.

As I look back I come to the conclusion it might have been better just to rent the movie instead of buy it; I'll watch the movie again just to check my impressions and if I revise my thinking I'll update this review.",1268784000,,858,4.131736526946108
3320183,2,B00128VA6C,"Honestly, I am 23 years old.  I watched this movie because it was written and directed by Zach Helm, who did ""Stranger Than Fiction"".  I was hoping for something as creative and meaningful as that movie, but I was disappointed.  This movie is for children, and it's special effects are now(2010) severely outdated(and not in a charming way).  The plot is similar to ""The Neverending Story"", except newer and more complicated.  Some of the ""magical"" scenes seem to drag on awkwardly long and don't add anything to the story.  Dustin Hoffman delivers a respectable performance as does the young outcast boy, but Natalie Portman is not at her best.  I do not recommend this film to anyone.  Even for children there are better movies that deliver the same message.",1268697600,2,760,4.837209302325581

3320185,3,B00128VA6C,"The movie is certainly a feast for the eyes, but the characters seem very two dimensional. We get an inkling about Molly being lost and get an idea that Bateman's character doesn't have as much fun as he should, but we really know little about Mr Magorium. Despite his 243 years, we have no knowledge of who he interacted with over the centuries: which famous people might have walked through those doors to get a toy that they cherished throughout their lives. Hoffman appears to be doing a homage to Ed Wynn in his mannerism and delivery, yet overall I wanted more from this flick. Why does only the monkey toy beckon to Bateman of all the toys on the wall? For a while I thought it was a toy he had long forgotten about. That would have been a better hook to pull Bateman's character into believing the store's magic (realising something he'd lost; finding again a cherished toy that cherished him). The chapter headings were absolutely pointless and distracting. We know Mr. Magorium's chapters are closing and Molly's chapters are about to turn a page, why hit us over the head? I've rated this a three, but it's really two and half stars.",1265414400,2,1144,4.585365853658536
3320186,2,B00128VA6C,"Despite a workable premise (magic toy store), this movie is relentlessly depressing.  The kids came to see a movie about magic, wonder, and loony fun . . . not about death and decay!

And why is Dustin Hoffman still getting roles?  He's been playing the same character for the last twenty years!  How is he still getting work?",1264550400,,326,4.568965517241379
3320187,5,B00128VA6C,"I found the story emotionally moving and delightful to watch. It even has a line that resonates long after the film concludes: ""Your life is an occasion: rise to it."" Well-acted.",1261785600,,178,4.774193548387097
3320188,4,B00128VA6C,"The children's movie ""Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium"" is highly manipulative and highly effective film-making. Mr. Magorium (Dustin Hoffman) is a toystore wizard whose decided that it's time for him to depart from this world not because 243 years is a long time to live but because he's run out of his favorite shoes. Molly Mahoney (Natalie Portman) is his apprentice who once as a piano prodigy tried to compose a master concerto but now as Mr. Magorium's heir apparent must figure out what to do with a block of wood. To help her Mr. Magorium has hired an accountant or ""a counting mutant"" (Jason Bateman), who as a humorless workaholic represents all that's wrong with the adult world, and so kids instinctively like to step on him. Serving as the narrator and the conscience of the movie is nine-year old Eric.

With Mr. Magorium as the composer the wonder emporium is simply a visual symphony, with shiny fire engines popping out of dusty books and Lego construction workers causing fire hazards. Everything is so cute and cuddly, as are the characters. Dustin Hoffman is very good, Jason Bateman is his usual likable self even when he's playing the movie's antagonist, and Natalie Portman manages to yet again demonstrate the full range of her acting talents even in a movie as emotionally one-sided as this one. This is a feel-good movie, and even the supposedly weird narrator Eric is weird only because he has the wisdom of someone who has lived three centuries.

And as a feel-good movie it slides into conflict and climax without really doing so. Mr. Magorium's last day is one big holiday, his depature is treated as a non-event, and Molly Mahoney's ""rise to the occasion"" is so assured that we have to credit the movie with even pretending anything else was possible.

Yes, this movie may be predictable and plotless but it raises an interesting point about how children and the elderly benefit society. Modern economics views children and the elderly as ""dependents,"" meaning they use important resources without helping to create wealth. Economists have long known that a population with a large proportion of working adults relative to dependents (Ireland, China, and soon India) benefit from fast and tremendous growth; the converse is also true, and so it's easy and quick to believe that the less children and elderly there are the better.

""Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium"" suggests these so-called dependents have an instrinsic and priceless social value: in them lies humanity's collected wisdom that adults have too easily forgotten. The counting mutant never believed in the magic of faith to change one's world, and Molly Mahoney had forgotten to believe but Eric always believed, and he believed with such a stubborn passion that he, not Molly Mahoney, is Mr. Magorium's true heir apparent. Eric is the only one who understands the counting mutant is really a child at heart, that it is time for Mr. Magorium to leave, and that Molly Mahoney is the only one who can inherit the store. The adults must struggle to discover truths that come instinctively to Eric.

That's because this is a children's movie, and Eric is the true hero and protagonist. More than conversing with the Molly Mahoneys and the counting mutants of this world (who as caricatures don't really exist) this movie is telling the the lonely and underappreciated Erics of this world that everyday because they see color in a world of gray and have faith in an overly rational world they help blind adults see.

But is this really true? Well, as Eric and Mr. Magorium would say, you just have to believe.",1257724800,2,3596,4.896551724137931

It is perfect for any age group and any individual who is in-touch with their inner child's imagination and who has an appreciation for the art of fantasy. I very rarely BUY movies-but after seeing this only once I knew that it had to become part of our regular library of entertainment. The cast is superb, the acting is great, and the story line is fantastically unique. Anyone who 'doesn't get' this movie has simply grown old and become so serious that they have forgotten the joy of dreaming and the small pleasures of childhood like pop wrap and glowing stars on your ceiling at night. As they said in the movie Hook, they ""have forgotten how to fly"". And for the rest of us, its a fantastic trip back to visit those fantasies.",1253232000,2,946,4.380681818181818

I admit, some parts of the movie are a little corny, but I still love it!  The only part I wasn't crazy about was that Mr. Magorium dies.  Contrary to what other people have said in their reviews, this part didn't bother me because I thought that it was scary(although, that is definitely something to consider if you're thinking about showing this movie to small children!).  I thought it was sad.  I woke up the morning after I saw Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium feeling like I wanted to cry.  I'm not sure if it was necessary to put death into this movie.  Including this subject does add a little something that I can't even explain or even completely understand.  Perhaps it keeps the movie from becoming overly juvenile.  In all, when I saw this movie, I wanted to jump through the screen and visit this amazing toy store!!  I do recommend it.

3320211,4,B00128VA6C,"After watching the most recent Star Wars trilogy, I was convinced that Natalie Portman was a horrible actress.  Her utterly wooden appearance in those 3 movies were an affront to acting.  But after seeing Closer and this movie, I now blame George Lucas for her acting in the Star Wars movies.  This is probably the biggest name movie since Star Wars in which Portman is the lead actress, and she pulls it of quite well.  The premise of the movie is quite simple, a very old man owns a magical toy shop whose clerk is a young lady played by Portman.  Said owner, Mr. Magorium, feels his death approaching and decides to hand the store over to his lady clerk.  The store and her disagree, and trouble ensues.  Of course, being a children's movie, the ending is happy, if not somewhat predictable.  The movie itself is carried by the acting, primarily by Dustin Hoffman, who puts in probably his best acting since Hook, and Portman, who puts in her best performance ever.  The soundtrack is also exquisite, and its development is central to the movie's premise.  Overall, quite worth watching.",1236729600,,1090,4.689473684210526
3320212,4,B00128VA6C,"This film is an ultra entertaining, feel good film that will fill your heart with joy.  I have now seen this film 3 times - the last being the bluray version which I had to purchase.  The film itself has an amazing cast who create a great ensemble.  No one tries to steal the show and they all inhabit their characters fully and with care as if they know the special story they are telling.  The story, message and magical wonder emporium itself are the true stars here.

Dutin Hoffman as the store owner is magical and Natalie Portman and Jason Bateman shine on screen as they do some of their best work.  Child actor Zach Mills is a revelation and gives a truly tender, heartfelt performance.  In this day and age with so much tragedy sometimes we forget to feel good and that pleasure can be found in some of the simplest places.  This film shows the viewer that life can be looked at with a positive outlook, definitely tells us to never forget our dreams and that the child in us has the right to always be in the forefront.  Love, sharing and casring are what makes the world go round.

Bluray is also a magical gift in itself to film lovers and this movie was created for bluray presentation.  The whole movie is crisp with vivid color and strong detail.  Everything pops out and the store itself is a thing of beauty.  The whole film shines.  It is so clear that some scenes that were shot with a spotlight on the main action appears like a play.  The film becomes a magical stage with the special light highlighting the action.

I had to give this film 4 stars and not 5 for I try to review honestly.  It is one of my true favorites and is nowe part of my bluray collection.  It is a magical joyful experience all should have but it does lack that certain oomph to make it a masterpiece.  Believe me, the 4 star rating is meant in no way to say the film is not brilliant.

3320224,5,B00128VA6C,"Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium is a movie that grows on you. After seeing it three times, I am beginning to understand why.

On the surface, it's a fun children's movie, but as you go deeper into the richness of it's texture and dialogue, you see something more. You might see yourself in the characters -- Mahoney who can't find the notes, Eric who can't find a friend, and Henry who can't seem to stop working. They're all on an adventure, and, in the end, everyone finds what they are looking for, even though they are not quite sure what they are looking for.

Two hundred and forty-three year old Edward Magorium knows.

Near the beginning of the film, when Mr. Magorium (Dustin Hoffman) hands Molly Mahoney (Natalie Portman) a block of polished wood -- ""the Congreve block,"" a likely allusion to the Congreve clock -- she's confused. She's not sure what it's for. Magorium tells her, ""Unlikely adventures require unlikely tools."" The block is the tool, but we don't know fully why or how until the last scene of the movie.

""Are we going on an adventure?"" Mahoney asks with a smirk.

""Well, my dear, we're already on one. All I'll say is this,"" he continues. ""With faith, love, this block, and a counting mutant, you may find yourself someplace you've never imagined.""

All the actors -- including Jason Bateman as an accountant out of touch with himself and Zach Mills as a boy out of touch with the world -- deliver fine performances.

If you watch it once, you may not get it. If you watch it twice, you'll be hooked. Rent it first, if you must. But this movie will grow on you and, perhaps in years to come, will emerge a classic. It's one of my new all-time favorites.",1232496000,,1679,4.539735099337748

This movie combines a great cast with a sweet, sad & funny story. It makes you laugh, it makes you think, it makes you wonder, it makes you cry, it makes you feel warm and fuzzy, it makes you feel good to be alive. It deals with both life and death in the most magical and marvelous manner. And, being a pianist myself, I am partial to the idea of composing a symphony of life from the notes within yourself.

3320234,5,B00128VA6C,"This movie has really grown on me.  I liked it when I first saw it, but didn't really see it as the classic it appeared to want to be.  But, as with many great movies, it is deceptively better than it first appears to be.

The movie deals with loss, grief, change, acceptance, and the continuity of life.  These themes are not dealt with head-on...they are just woven into the plot, lightened up with a bit of verbal and visual froth, and there to contemplate by those who recognize them.  But to a child watching the movie, it is just funny, silly, a little sad, and has a happy ending.

If there is a more overt lesson in the story for younger viewers, it is learned through the character of the little boy, Eric.  Eric is a wonderful kid, and though we see other kids rejecting him, through Mr. Magorium, Mahoney, and Henry, we see just how terrific he really is.  Savvy children will want Eric as their friend, realizing that the kids who reject him do so to their own detriment.",1224115200,4,983,4.362637362637362

But this had positive things to say about not only the end of stories but about how sometimes the beginnings are much more difficult than those ends. It was lovely and kind and pleasant in an innocent way that I haven't seen on the screen in a very very long time. There was no meanness or anger or sarcasm, just a joy in a pair of journeys, one ending and one beginning.

Both my husband and I found it very charming. While adults who are looking for an intelligent adult movie may say disparaging things about it, if you view it through the eyes of a child, it is truly magical! It deals with life, death and self-worth/ esteem in a beautifully sensitive manner, easily understandable by young children.

3320240,4,B00128VA6C,"This is not a movie for those who expect the world to be complex and sensible. With a title that rhymes like that, what would you expect beside the magical sweetness that just happens to be accepted by the world? I was quickly drawn in by this storybook world where the bizarre and quirky is just a way of life and no one thinks much more of it. Throw in a beautiful message of finding yourself, and I was pleasantly engrossed in this heartfelt tale.

Mr. Magorium is a very old inventor (several centuries) who has not only helped a few famous souls out there but has managed to create a magical toy store. However, he feels it is time to pass from this world. It seems to be pretty much his decision and he seems perfectly fine with it, and I found that to be an interesting look at death.

However, the store's manager Molly is a young woman who still hasn't quite figured out her place in the world. It's pretty shocking to her to learn that her beloved boss plans to die and leave her in charge when she has no idea who she is and only has a hat-collecting boy with no friends his own age and a workaholic accountant as her only companions.

Mr. Magorium is positive she'll do fine, with a little encouragement, and thus pours out a sweet story about finding the best in yourself.

It wasn't what I expected, and that's not a bad thing, especially when I realized the plot was deeper than a toy store romp.

I don't think the characters other than Mr. Magorium were as realized as they could have been, but they were still a far cry from two-dimensional bimbos and it did leave room for some proper growth.

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised at the story's charming simplicity and message. Nothing wildly exceptional, but it held its own in the way of family movies.",1220140800,5,1773,4.390243902439025

3320253,3,B00128VA6C,"Splitting kindergarteners into groups, I was given the privilege of assigning names for each group.  I was surprised to learn that about two-thirds of them had recently seen `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000E8M0VA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (Widescreen Edition)</a>,' so I knew names like Aslan, Mr. Tumnus, and the beavers would mean something special to them.  `Weren't you scared when the wolves showed up?' I asked.  `No,' they said in unison if not with some amusement.  The thought hadn't occurred to them, even if their embarrassed teacher wouldn't admit he got a jolt every time the wily beasts made their appearance.

What does that have to do with `Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium'?  Well, it has to do with audience appeal.  For some this movie will be only for primary purposes, say pre-school to third grade.  For me I was enchanted, but for some the digitalized special effects will seem ho-hum, and cynics will not even want to ride along.  With today's standards, even some of those kindergarteners may be underwhelmed by this film.

For all his inviting charm, Dustin Hoffman plays Edward Magorium, a soft spoken Willy Wonka with a lisp.  He's 243 years old, and his life is measured by the nifty pair of shoes he bought in Tuscany.  When his last pair wears out, he's done.  (Maybe I'm being too philosophical, but most of us--myself included--can hardly be trusted with that much time.)

He laudably puts the majority of his life span into his Emporium, a free-for-all place--that in my estimation--comes to life.  A magic inventory book summons a wish list, duck-duck goose takes literal form, and a perpetual paper air plane flies around the store.  These are just tasters, for the pacing of their unveiling is magical enough for me.  (I don't want to give away the whole store--sorry!)

Just like in `Willy Wonka' Magorium is looking for a successor to his emporium.  Mollie Mahoney (Natalie Portman) heads his staff, but while she believes in the magic, she pines to be a professional pianist and doesn't feel worthy to take his place.  The toy store seems to agree as it starts to turn grey in its foundations as the turnover becomes imminent.

The story unfolds like a book, complete with chapters as their created by a book builder (Ted Ludzek).  Balancing the skeptic/believer schism are an accountant and a kid.  Young Eric (Zack Mills) imitates his hero by sporting a collection of hats; sober Henry Westin (Jason Bateman) can't seem to smile, let alone loosen up to play checkers.  Edward Magorium isn't worried, for he's reassuring to Molly, and hiring Henry to assess the place was his idea.

Looking at the movie posters, I thought, `Well, it looks nice, but...How much can they do with a toy store?'  The answer is they do enough with the toy store, but what they do to the story is even better.  Predictable in places, I was still smitten by the interplay of budding romance and childhood whimsy.  Given the simple, but effective soundtrack and Mills' narration, and you're given one sweet and solid movie.  If you hold films like '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elf-Blu-ray/dp/B001E5CH0G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elf [Blu-ray</a>],' dear, then you're going to have a good time in 'Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium'.

3320254,4,B00128VA6C,"This was such a good, bright, intriguing, magical movie. However I couldn't give it the full 5 stars for two reasons. First, it is terribly sad. I generally don't mind ""bittersweet"" movies, but this one just drug me too far down that even the joyful ending couldn't erase the sad feeling from earlier in the film. Mahoney's distress was just too real!

The second reason is the manner in which Magorium dies. I love that the movie somewhat ""demystifies"" death, reinforcing that a life well lived is not a cause for sadness but of celebration and honor. But the fact that they made his death so ordinarily human with the funeral and everyone lined up at his graveside dressed in black, really disappointed me. I was so hoping as they showed his feet on the night he ""departed"" that somehow they would just disappear as a fitting end to his magical life. Instead I was left with the terrible question, ""What did he do to himself?"" and ""Who found his body?"" etc. I am relatively certain that kids over a certain age are savvy enough to ask the same questions. And the way the movie portrays it, I don't think there are satisfactory answers.

This portrayal of death with the questions it raises take away from the main message of the movie that, ""Your life is an occasion... rise to it,"" and that we do that by believing in ourselves and by faith in the seemingly impossible. ""Wonder Emporium"" is a beautifully crafted movie with only this one dark spot in my mind.

This is the kind of movie that seems like it must have been a well-loved book first with it's classic kid-lit characters... what a joy to find that there are people in Hollywood with the talent and imagination to create a story like this in present times!

3320256,5,B00128VA6C,"Let me make this clear first. I didn't watch this film with any children, nor am I some sort of child in a mans body. I'm a lover of movies that seek to entertain, inspire and teach. Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium does all three and the supporting cast to Dustin Hoffman really make this movie work.

Dustin Hoffman plays the eccentric toy shop owner who's over 240 years old and a believer in magic. One day he tells his dependable shop manager, Mahoney played by Natalie Portman that he's ""Leaving."" Firstly he must hire an accountant who we come to know solely as Mutant played by Jason Bateman to sort out all his paperwork, all 240 years worth. This becomes a story of friendship, love, belief and living life to the full to achieve all you wanted to achieve.

There are times in this film when it becomes truly heart wrenching. Especially the scene where Magorium finally leaves, but you become accepting of this, as that's what the movie's all about.

3320259,3,B00128VA6C,"Take Willy Wonka out of the chocolate factory and put him in a toy story and you essentially have Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium.  Like Wonka, Mr. Magorium (Hoffman) is a playful eccentric with wild hair, and a penchant for bizarre behavior.  His old world story is nestled between high rise building and it's no wonder as he has owned the store for over 200 years.  Toys virtually come to life inside the store, playing with the customers as much as they play with the.  The store has an inter-dimensional quality to it as a certain door can lead to different rooms with the turn of a dial on the wall.  The large, dusty store catalog can materialize its toys from thin air just by turning its pages.

Molly Mahoney (Portman) is the store manager and we learn immediately that while she loves working there, she feels incomplete for having never pursued her dream to be a concert pianist.  This is underscored when a former college classmate comments that he didn't know that she was still working at the store.  For shy 9-year-old Eric, the store is a sanctuary as he has no friends his age.  Because Mr. Magorium has never kept book or paid taxes (sure, like the IRS would let him get away with that for 200 years!) he hires accountant Henry Weston (Bateman) to get the books in order.

Magorium startles Molly by announcing that his time in the world is up and he intends to leave the store to her.  Molly refuses to believe that's he's going to die and turns down the offer.  This causes the store to lose all its magic.  Its bright red walls turn black and the toys are now lifeless.  Henry and Eric have to convince Molly that she has to take over the store in order to save it.

Again, the parallels with Wonka are many, even down to the owner needing to find someone younger to take over.  However, while Wonka was laced with often biting commentary about the behavior of spoiled kids and their parents, Magorium has none of this conflict.  Henry's unresolved issues about having friends his age remain unresolved.  Molly's dreams of becoming a pianist are tossed aside.  Only Henry gets to grow, realizing that he cannot be all work and no play.

The film does have some nice special effects that bring the wonder and magic of the store alive but there's not much magic in the predictable and unsatisfying script.  It's riddled with clichs which try to force the viewer into knowing when to laugh and cry and be overjoyed.  On the plus side it's a film most kids, especially younger kids will adore and it is good, clean family entertainment.

Mr. Magorium is old - very old, yet full of energy and child-like humour.  He is about to deliver some sad news to his young shop manager, played by Natalie Portman.  She is devastated, and refuses to accept the news, trying to get her boss (and best friend) to change his mind.  Mr. M is as merry as can be, as an accountant (Jason Bateman) tries to make sense of the store records.

Not only this but there's not really that much of a plot... there doesn't exactly seem to be a target age range, considering that it deals with death (which doesn't settle well with 5-8 year olds), and it seems as if the movie makers were trying too hard to make it whimsical and magical and failed miserably (which doesn't suit the older audience that pay attention to those things in a movie).

3320293,3,B00128VA6C,"After seeing this film, I finally understand why it didn't do so well at the box office.  While there is a lot to recommend this movie to children, there isn't much here for adults.  When it came to it, I was reminded of Nanny McPhee versus Mary Poppins.  Nanny McPhee was a fun little movie, but it just didn't have the ""magic"" that Poppins had, and neither does Magorium match up to the wonder of Willy Wonka.  That said, it was an entertaining movie overall and I'm glad I saw it, but just as glad I didn't buy the DVD.

Mr. Magorium has decided it is time to depart, and wants an accountant to tell him the value of his store before he leaves it to his assistant, Mahoney.  The accountant, of course, manages to miss all the magic that happens in the store.  And the film wastes no time throwing the audience into the bright colors and wackiness that a living toy store, imbued with the spirit of children, must have.  There is a huge book out of which toys magically appear, a door that has a special dial to change what's on the other side, a room with the biggest dodge ball on earth - no one can dodge it! - a shelf full of stuffed toys literally reaching out to the people passing by (including one adorable sock monkey), and through it all Dustin Hoffman smiles benevolently upon the children.  Hoffman plays the part a little too over the top, but still manages to retain his charm.  But, there is no plot beyond this simple premise.  Mahoney is distraught when she learns Magorium's leaving and the store itself throws a temper tantrum.  Yet, there is an uplifting message behind it all that made this movie worth seeing.

Mahoney believes in the magic of the store, whole-heartedly.  Yet, she doesn't truly believe in herself.  The accountant gets befriended by a boy who collects hats, and together they must convince her she does have the magic to keep the store going.  This is a great film for younger children that are ready to move past animated films.  The CGI and special effects are pretty good, and the characters are all likeable.

Which brings us to MR. MAGORIUM'S WONDER EMPORIUM...

Hoffman's portrayal of Mr. Magorium is pretty unique, if not sexually confusing; an unmarried 243-year-old man with a lisp and colorful outfits? {that was a joke, by the way} Mr. Hoffman does play the role very well. He was the shining star in an otherwise slipshod script.

The problems are many, but the biggies are the lack of secondary character development and an extremely rushed series of events, particularly the ending. Examples:

The movie packed zero emotional punch when a main character dies. Zach Mills (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hollywoodland/dp/B000KWZ7JC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hollywoodland</a>) who plays a vital role as the young and lonely Eric doesn't really shine, even when he tries to reach out to accountant Mark Loring (Jason Bateman,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Kingdom/dp/B000Y7WGOW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Kingdom</a>) and make friends. It is cute but that's about it.

Natalie Portman (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Darjeeling-Limited/dp/B0010X8NF0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Darjeeling Limited</a>) stars as Molly, the surprising heir-in-interest of this magical -- and alive -- emporium. But even Portman's tearful and soft face couldn't hold the story up. The short 93 minute run-time of the film allowed for minimal immersion into her character and the aforementioned rush to the finish.

Probably the most interesting character wasn't a character at all and had very little screen time (which was a shame because I wanted to know more about it). I'm speaking, of course, about the emporium building itself, which goes into a temper tantrum and dark mood when it learns that Mr. Magorium plans to ""leave.""

There are some interesting shots and ideas, however. The turning of a dial near a doorway produces different exit points when the door is opened. Toys come to life if they feel nearby emotion (fear, love, etc.). And the idea that someone must move on so that others can learn and become more human is cliche but came off okay if a bit forced.

The other good thing is that this film holds very little that would upset the parents of young kids. It's safe and visually appealing. But it doesn't allow for much else.",1207958400,,3297,6.854415274463007

3320309,5,B00128VA6C,"This is a terrific family movie that is suitable for children of all ages.

However, for the most part it is its own movie.  It centers around a man (played by Dustin Hoffman) who wishes to leave the management / ownership of his magical toy store to his favorite employee (portrayed by Natalie Portman) as he can sense that his end is near.  Unfortunately, Portman's character is apprehensive about taking over the toy store, mostly stemming from a lack of self-confidence.

To be sure, many will say that this film is predictable, and so it is.  However, the people who criticize it on such grounds are, I believe, missing the point.  Granted, there are no real ""hooks"" in the plot or plot-twists that will keep you guessing.  So what?  In a movie like this, it really doesn't matter.  At base, to me the film is not so much about the story itself as it is about how we all used to look upon the world with such  a sense of wonder when we were children.  People who are only looking for surprises are not prone to ""getting it"" insofar as this DVD is concerned.

The casting is terrific with Hoffmann and Portman leading the way.  Hoffmann gets his chance to play a sort of pseudo-Santa Clause, and it's evident that he enjoyed himself immensely.  I've always like Portman, and it's nice to see a young woman who is both a fine actress as well as a great person.  She is kind of the antipode to ""bad girls"" like Lindsay Lohan.

If you are the parent of small children, I'd highly recommend this film.  If you're not a parent of small children but enjoy feeling like a kid again, this one is recommended to an equal degree.",1205625600,36,1875,4.917197452229299
3320310,4,B00128VA6C,"OK, I didn't quite know what to make of this movie.  It has its charms.  Unlike some folks, I didn't mind Dustin Hoffman's choice of hair and lisp for Mr. Magorium.  The man is supposed to be more than two hundred years old, magical, and imbued with a childlike wonder of life.  Yet, the story really isn't about him.  The story is about Molly Mahoney, played by Natalie Portman (one of the actors I always enjoy).  She was a child prodigy on the piano who, the story says, played the Rachmaninoff Second Piano Concerto.  Yeah, right.  No one who could actually play that concerto as a child would ever find there way behind the counter of a toy store.  The sad history of prodigies does indicate a poor chance for her to progress into permanent pianistic stardom, but she would likely stay in music or head into some other intellectual profession.  Oh, and the kind of music the movie has her ""composing"" and playing is just absurd.  Portman's hands look as if they have had lessons and played the piano, but they are not hands strong enough or experienced enough for a big concerto.  As the Master Thespian used to declare, ""Acting!""

Magorium hires an accountant, a counting-mutant, to help him figure out what the store is worth since he has never even seen a receipt.  The hiring of Henry Weston (played by Jason Bateman - whom I also always enjoy) is one of the more delightful scenes in the movie.  Of course the store is in a state beyond disarray.  Magorium isn't big on explaining why he wants the Mutant (as he is affectionately called).  The other delightful character in the movie is Eric Applebaum (delightfully done by Zach Mills).  Eric is a lonely boy with amazing creativity, a superb collection of hats, and zero friends.  Given his personality that seems as impossible as Molly's playing Rachmaninoff.

The store Magorium runs is indeed magical, and we are given abundant evidence of it.  However, it understands Magorium's secret, as do some of the toys, and none are happy about it.  Magorium intends to give the store to Molly, who doesn't want it because she wants Magorium to stay.  He can't or won't.  The store turns entirely black after he goes and Molly intends to sell it.  But Eric and the Mutant want her to keep it.  The climax of the story, which is about the power of being aware of the magic that is your life and the power of believing in yourself, is whether or not Molly can bring the store to its former glory or whether she lets it slip away.  Take a big guess.

So, some of the things in the story didn't work for me.  I didn't like that no one has an actual complete family.  Magorium's history is largely never discussed nor is how he lived to be a couple of hundred years old.  We do learn about his delight in the kind of shoes wears.  Molly is alone except for the store (no boyfriend, fianc, mother, or father), Eric has a Mom but only because he is nine.  She doesn't do much except fret.  The Mutant is as alone and as detached Molly.  And the issue surrounding Magorium's decision actually makes no sense and has nothing of the weight such events have in real life.

Yet, my opinion of the movie changed when my five year old granddaughter watched it.  She was delighted and mesmerized and demanded to see it again immediately.  And she has watched it twice more since.  So, there is obviously something about the movie that is compelling to a small child that escapes me as an adult, deeply into the realities of life.  Hmmmm... take that for what you will and I added a star because of my grandchild's enthusiasm.  It is not a bad movie.  The special effects are a bit much.  However, it is successful for the kids.  Go with them, I guess.

Natalie Portman shines in this movie as his open eyed innocent helper. Every character is likeable and loveable something we don't often see. The genre is a kids movie, but every now and then we all need to remember the innocence inside.  This movie does a great job of that. Enjoy.",1205193600,4,443,4.444444444444445

This one, however, impressed me. Dustin Hoffman was brilliant as Magorium, while staying away from a Wonka impression. Jason Bateman's performance has made me a fan, and Natalie Portman shows that *gasp* she can act.

Zach Mills, however, really jumped out at me as Eric. Unlike many performances by children these days, his was convincing and hearfelt.

The music also adds a very nice touch.

Overall, for a kids movie, it is excellent. I would actually give it four and a half stars, but it won't let me.",1205107200,10,629,4.796296296296297

3320327,3,B00128VA6C,"Mr. Magorium (Dustin Hoffman) is well over 200 years old. He owns a magical toy store in New York City. And when I say magical, I do mean magical. The toys come alive and play with the kids. There is even a door of rooms controlled by a dial to find the room you want.

Molly Mahoney (Natalie Portman) is the store manager, a former piano virtuoso ready to get back to her music career.  Mr. Magorium doesn't pay any attention to her, however, but brings in a mutant.  Okays, so it's really an accountant, but he figures the word derived from mutant at some point.  Henry Weston (Jason Bateman) is hired to find out just how much the store is worth.  See, Mr. Magorium has not kept records at all.  Fortunately, he has saved every receipt along the way.

Yet it's Eric Applebaum (Zach Mills), a nine year old hat collector with no friends, who first notices the problem. A wall of the store is turning dark and bubbling. Could Mr. Magorium's decision to leave be causing the problem? Will the store react poorly if he follows through?

This movie was marketed as a fun comedy fantasy.  From those ads, I was really looking forward to seeing it.  Unfortunately, the movie is much more serious then I was led to believe it would be.  While the theme of believing in yourself is wonderful, the melancholy tone made parts of it sadder then I was looking for.

Despite the disappointment in tone, there is much to praise.  There were several funny sight gags and great lines.  Most of these were in the previews, however.  This accountant got a huge kick out of the characters continually calling Henry ""Mutant.""  And don't miss Kermit the Frog's wonderful cameo.  This movie wasn't the special effects extravaganza I was expecting, but what was there was great.  And the acting was top notch.  All four of the leads made their characters absolutely believable.  Special praise has to go to Dustin Hoffman as Mr. Magorium.  He made the movie work.

I think if I had walked into this film knowing what to expect, I would have enjoyed it.  But since the movie wasn't what I wanted, I couldn't help but feel disappointed.  I'd give the movie 3.5 stars if I could. It's a decent film as long as you are expecting a darker kid's film.",1204675200,3,2224,4.516290726817043
3320328,4,B00128VA6C,"""Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium"" is a great and albeit odd family film.  It's odd in the sense that many alleged family films of late have been sprinkled with hints of vulgarity and innuendo.  So ""Magorium"" is great in the sense that there's none of that here.  This is an innocent family film that is fun and entertaining, even if its story seems on the sophmoric side.  The film's spirit makes up for it by leaps and bounds.

The story centers on Mahoney, played by Natalie Portman, who manages the store, but is an aspiring piano player who sees herself leaving the store soon.  She is friends with Eric, a boy who comes to the store but has no friends his own age.  Magorium, played with cartoon like precision by Dustin Hoffman, is looking to leave the store to Mahoney.  In the meantime, the store seems to be losing some of it's magic.

Part of the charm of this film is that it is pure fun.  The actors (especially Hoffman) look like they're having a good time and the pure magic of the toy store celebrates children and their imagination.  Coming from a child development background, I especially grinned at one of the lines where Mahoney remarks to a child that they don't have to stay in the lines when they color.  The effects and look of the store are neat.  While there are neat visual effects, a lot of the store's charm comes from creative use of sets and puppetry and, oh, a couple live animals here and there.

The film falters a bit in the story department.  It's an okay story.  Like many children's features though, it's short.  The conclusion seems rather rushed by the end of the film's 90 minute running time and I felt something was missing from the script. Some of the film's humor is spot on, while some of it rests on tired puns.  When that happens, we are at ease because of the performers' ability to deliver.

Overall, this is a fun family film.  It's a real shame that it did not do well in theatres as the film captures innocence and imagination better than a lot of recent family films.  Parents can rest assured that this film lives up to its G rating.  The film is cute and non threatening, and while the story may not break any ground in family entertainment, this is still a film that families can sit down and enjoy without worry.",1204588800,4,2269,4.443099273607748
3320329,5,B00128VA6C,"Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium champions classic toys and the stores that used to carry them before the proliferation of chain stores like Toys R Us and Wal-Mart made them virtually extinct. In this age of crass commercialism, this film celebrates idealism and imagination - things that our world so desperately needs.

Dustin Hoffman portrays Magorium as an optimistic Willy Wonka-type who is a genius toy maker and has a pet zebra in his home. He runs a magical toy store complete with an enormous book that lists the store's entire inventory and going to the appropriate page magically produces said toy. Each character has their own dilemma to resolve: Eric has to make a friend; Henry has to learn how to have fun, and Molly's desire to create music instead of running the Emporium. The cast is uniformly excellent, from Natalie Portman's engaging turn as Molly to Jason Bateman as the button-down accountant.

There is an absolutely charming scene where Henry and Eric communicate on opposite sides of a pane of glass via handwritten messages to the Cat Stevens' song, ""Don't Be Shy"" that demonstrates director Zach Helm's skill a visual storyteller. It was at this moment that I wondered if he is a fan of Hal Ashby's films as this song was used prominently in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harold-and-Maude/dp/6305882592/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harold and Maude</a>. This hunch was confirmed with Ashby's surname popping up in a scene as a store name. It is these little touches, like the nervous slinky or the gigantic dodge ball that fills an entire room or Magorium's hospital room at night decorated with many glow-in-the-dark stars, that make this film such a joy to watch.

He adopts a vibrant colour scheme with the larger shocks of colour being primary in nature and then the smaller details (toys and clothes) comprised of secondary and tertiary colours. For example, the hospital that Magorium stays in is dominated by golden yellows while warm, brown wood dominates the Emporium. The entire film is like a giant box of Crayola crayons exploded all over it.

Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium is not at all what I expected it to be (to be honest, I had little to no expectations) and was pleasantly surprised by how charming and imaginative this film turned out to be. It makes a convincing argument for keeping magic and wonderment alive. So often we grow up and either lose or ignore these feelings. There's more to life than dollars and sense. Mr. Magorium is a wonderful film that appeals to your heart without being so obviously manipulative and celebrates imagination over conformity. It also appeals to children with condescending to them and to adults who haven't forgotten what it's like to be a kid.

""Strangely Weird and Weirdly Strange: The Magical World of a Wonder Emporium"" is comprised of four featurettes that take brief looks at various aspects of the film. The first one features cast and crew praising director Zach Helm. Another takes a look at how the Sock Monkey puppet works. We also see how the production dealt with an actual zebra on the set. Finally, we see how the life-sized sculpture of President Abraham Lincoln was made entirely out of Lincoln Logs.

""An Eccentric Boss and An Awkward Apprentice"" takes a look at the characters of Mr. Magorium and Molly Mahoney. Not surprisingly, the actors were drawn to the project because of the well-written script. Cast and crew speak highly of Hoffman and Portman. The two actors describe their characters.

""To Meet Eric Applebaum, Start by Saying Hi"" takes a look at Eric and the actor who plays him, Zach Mills. Like the previous featurette, the character is described and the actor is praised. He was picked out of 1,200 other kids.

""The Magical Toy Store"" examines the fantastic set that was the toy store. Helm and the production designer worked together to create a big playground for kids. They wanted to create the impression that the store really existed. There's also footage of this set being constructed.

Finally, there is ""Fun on the Set,"" a montage of the cast and crew goofing around on and off the set.",1204502400,17,4157,5.004341534008683
3320330,5,B00128VA6C,"Mr Magorium's Wonder Emporium: Truly Wonderous!
It is a rare film that holds your attention hours after you see the credits roll. Mr Magorium is that, and more. It is, at its' core, a modern day parable that speaks to the power and magic of faith.
On the surface, Mr Magorium's Wonder Emporioum is a toy store for the ages. The children come into play in brightly lit corners stacked high with toys, games, books, and models. Rockets fly around the ceiling. A magical ball room transforms itself into an upstairs suite with the twist of a knob. The life of the store is reflected in the joy of the children and parents who enter the doors.
Mr Edward Magorium is dying. 243 years old, and his shoes are finally wearing out. As he explains to his assistant, Molly Mahoney, his last pair of shoes is wearing out and he knows that when they do, he will die. To prepare for the event, he hires an accountant, Henry Weston, to evaluate the value of the store and the contents. Magorium, names him Mutant, and throughout the whole film, Henry discovers the oddities that define a 200 year old man. $300,000 for a door knob (I've never paid more than $250,000). An IOU from the Thomas Edison. Century old toys. And a book keeping system that defies logic and belief. It's almost too much for a trained Mutant to bear!

Like a living being, the toy store ebbs and moves.  Cracks appear on the walls.  The life within the toys wanes and the atmosphere is less magical.  A young assistant, Eric Applebaum,
On the passing of Mr Magorium, the store 'dies' as well. But not before he presents a gift to Molly of a large block presumably possessing magical powers.  Unable to sustain the life of the store and business flow, Molly closes and prepares to sell much to the disappointment of Eric Applebaum, the young hat collector who works at the store.

When all is darkest, and Molly's dream of finishing her grand masterpiece, she discovers the missing piece to the puzzle.  When all is dark, and she is about to sign the store over, she discovers the magic behind the emporium.

""Move"" ""Move"" ""Fly...."" is all that is required when her journey to joy takes flight as her faith is renewed and the toy store explodes!  In one broad stroke, he symphony is complete, and the deadened toy store comes to life once more.

I said before this is a modern day parable, and I believe it is.  Beneath the toys lies the truth of the mustard seed. ""If I have faith as a mustard seed, I could say to the mountain, move, and it shall MOVE!""  And it does.

There are other themes too.  Joy in the journey.  Youth.  Living life to its' fullest.  Passing on of our faith.  Mourning.

Dustin Hoffman and Natalie Portman are wonderfully cast in this film.  The `mutant', Justin Bateman, plays a perfect straight man.

This is a true family film that is not fluff.  Talk about it. Watch it together.  Share it.  That's what the `parable of the toy store' is all about.

3320331,5,B00128VA6C,I am now 18 and I went and saw this with my 17 year old best friend. We both truly enjoyed this movie.

3320332,2,B00128VA6C,"If I had to assign one word to this movie, it would be ""heavy.""

I watched this movie with my 6 year old daughter. She was bored (though a good sport), and I expected a lot more magic and a greater feeling of wonder, particularly when in the toy store. I hadn't anticipated that death would be a constant vein throughout the movie. Also adding to the sense of sadness and loneliness was the element of misfits who find a friendship with each other that was unsettling itself in some ways. Finally, the most lighthearted moments (that is, the funniest parts of the movie) occurred when the store was throwing a temper tantrum (a bit of a mixed message for kids I think).

My daughter and I both were sad enough to tear up several times during the movie. (I'm certainly not opposed to children's movies that include death, for example, ""Where the Red Fern Grows,"" ""Old Yeller,"" and ""Charlotte's Web"" are all movies I watched in grade school and will have no qualms about showing my daughter.) Given though that we set out to watch a fun, magical show (based on the previews), I was disappointed when instead we left the movie feeling ""bummed.""

This movie may very well be a tool for opening communication with a child on death and the feelings of sadness, anger, fear, and then hope that are often associated with loss, but I do not recommend it if you are looking for a feel good or whimsical movie as I was.",1203811200,7,1408,4.470817120622568

3320334,3,B00128VA6C,"For young folk, this movie does seem to capture their imagination.  My six year old sat enthralled through most of it given the emporium full of wonderful toys that Mr. Magorium had.  Unfortunately, for adults this is a dull, plodding movie that will test your patience throughout.  I expected much more from Hoffman and Portman, but they can only deliver on what has been handed them, and in this case it was more props than it was story, as Zach Helm made Mr. Magorium into a 243-year-old Mr. Gadget who no longer had any tricks up his sleeves and had decided to sign out.  The reason, as Mr. Magorium explains, is that he has come to the end of his last pair of Tuscan leather shoes and there is nowhere else to find them.  The film's fixation on death is a bit strange given that it seems aimed mostly at elementary age kids.  Sadly, the main characters are all such loners that they have a very hard time letting Mr. Magorium go, so we get endless attempts to forestall the event and a store that goes into a deep gray funk over the matter.  What little humor there is in the movie is parsed out in little cubes of sugar, seeming forced and contrite.  They could have at least found the toymaker extraordinaire an old shoe shop in New York that could fix his dilapidated shoes.  Poor Molly seems to have the hardest time, staring at a block of wood Mr. Magorium gave her, unable to unlock its magic power until the end, when everything is restored to glowing technicolor as it should be.
