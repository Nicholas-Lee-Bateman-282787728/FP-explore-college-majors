Hallie Mitchell and her partner, Donnalee Crawford, are both architects of their own company.  After meeting a college crush, Hallie realized she was missing something in her life.  A family.  Donnalee and Hallie both take up a video dating service.  While this was happening, Hallie's new neighbor, Steve, just moved in next door.  Steve, recently separated from his wife, was raising his daughter alone.  And due to some water pressure problems, they were constantly running into each other homes and becoming friends and maybe something more.

Can anyone say ""disappointment""?  This is my third foray into the Harlequin Movie series.  (The first being ""At the Midnight Hour"" and second being, ""Leopard in the Snow"".  Btw, good books and decent movies.)  According to the summary, I thought it would be a cute romantic comedy about the pitfalls of video dating and with the story written by Debbie Macomber, how can I lose?  The movie started off really well.  It was charming, funny, and witty.  Then everything went downhill after Hallie's second date.  It was becoming more sad and serious than funny and light.  And I didn't think too highly of Hallie.  Both times that she was serious about a relationship, the guys were in the process of separating/divorcing from their wives.  The movie was kind of depressing when it comes to the dating scene and marriage.  Other than that, everything else was done very well.  The acting was very good.  This is a pretty clean romance with a few kissing and eluded scenes except for the very end.  Which I knew was coming, but I wasn't really prepared for it.  It was a nudity scene that even I wasn't comfortable with.  So, I just skipped through that.  There are no extras on this DVD.  And on a side note, I don't know why the secondary characters are on the cover and not the actual main couple.

Honestly, I would not have bought this movie but the price got me.",1243987200,6,1923,4.745454545454545

8315626,2,B001KP2Y9Y,"Why would I want to watch a movie about some woman dating these gorgeous ""Mr. Wrongs"" over and over while some married neighbor, who is clearly who she is going to end up with, runs in and out of her house every day?  Some guy is all perfect until he physically attacks her for letting her neighbor over...yeah, okay, that was out of nowhere...another guy from college shows up and dates her for a couple days and is mad she isn't in love with him.  What?  Give it some time....

And mind you, if the guy really loved her he would understand that she loves her work and would love that about her, not keep trying to get her to quit her business and run around the world living the high life on his money.

The neighbor treats his wife like an incompetent ""little woman"" and disrespects her, which is hello, NOT ATTRACTIVE in a man.  Of course, the wife's character isn't likable either because she's selfish and adulterous and basically is abandoning her husband and child to start a business and date another man...like, a sensible woman would start the business while married...no reason she couldn't be a wife and mom AND start a business...of course, a sensible, decent husband would support his wife and her dreams and talents, not belittle everything she does.

And I guess it's a rule there has to be some kind of steamy sex scene in a Harlequin movie...?  I coulda done without it...it's kinda unbelievable that an old house with bad water would have a clear glass shower enclosure next to a claw foot tub...wasn't even an aesthetically pleasing layout.

The only reason I didn't give it ONE star is that the main character was likable and the acting was decent from her and the neighbor and DonnaLee.  So, it's gets an extra star for having one well-developed female character and some good acting.  The plot....ugh, no.  SO bad.  SO dumb.",1506038400,5,1848,4.597560975609756

8315631,2,B001KP2Y9Y,I agree with the other reviewer that this was not a very good movie. It was stated to be a romantic comedy but I would not call it that at all. Everyone was in broken relationships. The little girl could have been a cute addition to the story but really wasn't used much. I didn't think the main two characters had any real spark between them. He went from saying he loved his wife to saying he loved her in a very short amount of time - so unbelievable.,1313798400,,454,4.112359550561798
