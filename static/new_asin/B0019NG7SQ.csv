Deep space nine is ok.  I would buy any of these on blu-ray.  Contrary to what the other review said, Please take your time, and do it right, and well.  Don't not do it though!  I've been known to download a movie, or rip a movie or two, but with something like the star trek series, IT DESERVES THE RETURN.  Believe it!  If you produce them, I'll be there ;) I'm sure I speak on behalf of countless millions!!!

If you build it, they will come LOL!",1270857600,9,612,4.145299145299146
3442018,5,B0019NG7SQ,"For those criticizing Frank Bitterhof ""Morpheus"" let's be fair. Amazon puts up a 'review' section for an unplanned likely never to happen product that doesn't exit. I can think of no better use for the review section than to comment on what this future product might be like or how we might be helpful in making it a reality.

I worked at a Post Production facility during the editing of ST-TNG and met the owner of Digital Magic, the company who took over the effects work after ILM's initial first few seasons. He told me with all the pieces in place during production there was an average of 1 million dollars a week just for the digital special effects. Most all of them created digitally at standard definition and delivered on Digibeta tape. It would take a serious team of people with lots of talent and a very large budget several years to deliver the entire series in HD. I work in effects editing today and it is cheaper and easier than it was back then so who knows maybe someone will bid this out and get the job done! I sure hope so. It was my favorite ST series, in fact, favorite TV series of all time.",1263772800,37,1117,4.3701923076923075
3442019,5,B0019NG7SQ,"I immediately purchased all of the seasons on DVD when they were available.  I do not own a bluray player, but if they release Star Trek TNG on bluray I will buy them all asap.  It sucks watching my TNG DVDs on my HDTV in 4:3 format, so a high quality widescreen format would be a dream.",1254355200,2,287,4.017543859649122
3442020,5,B0019NG7SQ,"Paramount would be wise to release the Next Generation on Blu-Ray.  It would be an instant seller and would make millions of dollars.  But, if Paramount doesn't want money then that's their issue.  Engage!",1253145600,2,205,4.970588235294118
3442021,5,B0019NG7SQ,"This is the promised replacement for my original 1 star preview / warning ""sub-VHS video quality should be banned from Blu-ray!"" and for those that didn't really read my preview I want to stress again that the first, original plans to release ST-TNG on BD were to simply transfer the old tapes with their horrible picture quality onto BD just to save disc space (I'm not kidding!), hence my 1 star review.

Needless to say that NOW I'm truly excited and can hardly wait for December but will actually wait until January for the US release to add my ""voting power"".

""Voting power""? Yes, I've learned from a very reliable source that the TNG sampler BD is a TESTING vehicle for market demand!
In simpler language: If the sale figures of this sampler disc do not meet with the expectations of the studio, we will not see TNG on Blu-ray disc in our lifetime!

You are wondering why the sampler disc is scheduled for a December release in Germany but won't be available in the US until January? This release strategy for the decisive US market ensures that the sale figures of the sampler disc in January will be representative for fan demand (opposite to sales figures that are just the result of Christmas gifts).

You are wondering about the choice of episodes (no BEST OF BOTH WORLDS)? The choice of the not so popular pilot movie is deliberate. Trekkers that will buy this sampler BD will most likely buy the entire seasons on BD (if the sampler disc just included everybody's favorite TNG episodes, you'd be having a lot of occasional fans, buying just that disc but never a complete season).

Therefore and most humbly I can only urge every friend and fan of Captain Picard and his crew to preorder and purchase this one Blu-ray disc as soon as it becomes available as it is the ticket and lifeline to the TNG seasons on BD and HD. Please spread the word and tell every, and I mean every, STAR TREK fan you know!

In BEST OF BOTH WORLDS Picard saved Earth with one word and action and also TNG itself can now only be saved with one word and action: BUY!

Thanx for listening, live long and prosper!",1249084800,23,2101,4.5131578947368425

Interesting for people outside the US (Region A) is, that the whole Blu-ray is also in German, French and Japanese language (Blu-ray menu included). Subtitles are included for the movie. It also plays in Region B (Europe) Blu-ray players (I can change the region code for my player, but this was not necessary for this disc). So, in spite what Amazon.com writes in the product description, this disc is not region locked.

The special features are in English language only (no subtitles in English or other languages). The HD special feature ""Survive and Succeed: An Empire at War"" is especially interesting, since the actor who plays Gowron, one of the Duras female actors and the inventor of the Bat'leth have quite some stories to tell.

Also the feature commentary is worth a shot. Especially Moore's comments are quite insightful.

All in all: Worth a buy also for the fans in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, France and Japan.",1379808000,,1092,4.792553191489362

3442087,3,B0019NG7SQ,"Fans of Gene Roddenberry's STAR TREK were hard to convince of liking another series to come out with the same name. Their fears were squelched when THE NEXT GENERATION was under way. The series took a year to get into the groove but once it did fans were hard pressed to decide which was their favorite captain, Kirk or Picard?
By the time season four arrived fans were onboard the new voyages of the Starship Enterprise big time. At the end of that season came a cliff hanger not to be finished until season five. Those two episodes have come together on blu-ray now in a feature format that shows why the series was so popular.

As the movie opens things are in turmoil on Klingon. The Enterprise is there to witness the placement of Gowron as the new head of the High Council with Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) to fulfill his duties as the Arbiter of Succession. Before the ceremony begins Picard suggest to Lt. Warf that he approach Gowron and request that he clear Warf's family name, something he let become tarnished in an effort to contain peace on Klingon in an earlier episode. Gowron refuses as he currently is trying to set himself up for his new position while the threat of civil war is posed. Challenging him for his position is the illegitimate son of Duros, the traitorous previous ruler.

With both sides drawing upon various loyalties in the hopes of taking the High Council, Ward resigns his position in Star Fleet to remain with his brother as they side with Gowron. What is unknown to both Gowron and the members of the Enterprise is that the Duros family has received help from the Romulans, enemies of both the Klingon Empire and Star Fleet.  With their help they could overthrow the rule of Gowron and join forces with the Romulans making space particularly uninviting for anyone else.

What worked so well in this series was the complexity of the stories. This series, and this episode, don't content themselves to be nothing more than a shoot 'em up show. Instead we have tremendous political backstabbing going on as well as an attempted coupe of an entire race of warriors. The depth of the characters makes the story that much more interesting as we see the story play out. Toss in a surprise guest appearance of an old face from years ago and you have something even more special (can you say Tasha Yar?).

Fans of the series will enjoy having this story that was a two parter joined together in this format. It gives you the chance to enjoy it in blu-ray long before season five comes out. Not only has this been released in blu-ray but the clean up and fine tuning of the special effects make it a sight to behold now. If you are a fan of the Trek series, old or new, then you'll want to make sure you add this one to your collection.",1378944000,,2770,4.50996015936255
3442088,4,B0019NG7SQ,"You gotta love CBS Home Video's shameless double-dipping when it comes to their Star Trek releases.

You also have to love how fans like myself gladly just say ""shut up and take my money.""  Well, although I've never been a big fan of the double-dipping when there is nothing added other than gimmicks and packaging, this release, like the release of the 'Best of Both Worlds' two-parter, is worth spending the $15 on.

What they've done, if you don't know is taken the season four cliffhanger, Redemption and seamlessly spliced it together with the season five premiere, Redemption, Part II, and made it into one big long, movie-like episode... the way it should be seen.  Unlike some fans, I've never had that much of a nerd-boner over Redemption but I certainly can appreciate what they've done here and what they continue to do with the cliffhangers and the season premieres for the Blu-ray releases.  I also appreciate the fact that these two-parters act as entry vehicles for fans who haven't been convinced to commit to TNG remastered on Blu-ray because they own $800 worth of DVDs they purchased just a decade ago.

That being said, if a butt-hurt fan who's mad at CBS for taking more of their money isn't convinced to go all Blu-ray for TNG after seeing this (or BoBW) then they never will be.

As with all of the TNG Blu-ray releases, the video and audio quality is absolutely stunning and the re-composited and re-masterd effects are breathtaking.",1378512000,3,1457,4.780876494023905

The Klingon mythology special feature is very interesting. I haven't listened to the audio commentary, so I can't comment on that.

3442091,3,B0019NG7SQ,"So what did I get that wasn't on the standard DVD version?  Actually very little.  More importantly, I lost some content.  These re-edits are nice in the fact that you can see both parts at once, but the editors left off important sense, such as when Worf was explain the various Klingon items in the trunk to the girl who was half Klingon and Romulan.  Instead they gave us more of the fight scene just before Worf it taken to the Durass sisters.  My gripe is why are these still in the 4:3 format?  Surely the originals are in 16:9.  The audio remix was not done well.  The dialog from the center speaker is distorted at times.  This comes from what was originally done in stereo and then having a computer steering algorithm trying to place content in surround speakers.  For some reason, this version did not hold my attention as the original 2 DVD's did.",1377734400,3,859,4.448717948717949

3442093,5,B0019NG7SQ,"I was first introduced to the whole idea of these two-parter episodes being released as stand-alone movies when I was fortunate enough to find out that The Best of Both Worlds was going to play in theaters for a one day showing on April 25th. I always loved TBOBW above every other episode. I felt it was a combination of an outstanding story, acting and a wonderful creepy score by Ron Jones. So to get a chance to see it on the big screen was a dream come true. I find after buying and watching TBOBW I am seeing it in a whole new light (not only the outstanding work done in restoration) but it really does feel like watching a movie.  I got my copy of Redemption yesterday and simply loved it. I guess Im a gluten of punishment because I am also buying each season on blu-ray (replacing my old collection). I only hope (as another reviewer stated) that Paramount decides to release the remaining two-parter episodes in the same fashion.

3442105,5,B0019NG7SQ,"Star Trek: The Next Generation - Redemption is a Blu-ray TV movie like best of both worlds,

The Enterprise is en route to Qo'nos so Captain Picard can finish is duty to the Klingon Empire as arbiter of secession to the empire's chancellorship.

While en route Enterprise is intercepted by Gowron's [the next legal successor to the late Chancellor K'mpec] flagship the bortaS Gorown warns Captain Picard that Lursa and B'etor the sisters of Duras are planning to move against his installation as Chancellor.

When Gowron is finally confirmed as the only legal successor this gives Worf a chance to end a despicable injustice that was forced upon the house of Mogh and his father's memory but not all Klingons are too happy with the installation.

The sisters of Duras start a civil war with the aid of the Romulans and their leader who is the spitting image of LT. Natasha Yar the former security chief of the Enterprise who died three years earlier and with a warning that she will ""deal"" with Captain Picard

The story is great and the effects while not CG will look great!
If the best of both worlds blu-ray is anything to go by

The only thing I know I won't like is the picture will be in 4:3 format which means ugly black lines on the side but that is the only down side to it.

The one thing I do like about it is that it's a region free blu-ray disc and since I have to wait over a month for it to be imported to the UK it means that I will get to see it since paramount in its finite wisdom has decided the Europe won't get this at least I will get it

Even if you are not a trek fan or a sci-fi fan in general I think you will enjoy the story of ""Redemption"" with Worf figuring out how to integrate into his native heritage and culture that he has not experienced since he was orphaned at 6 years old when his parents were murdered by the Romulans during the Khitomer massacre.",1375660800,2,1887,4.295774647887324
3442106,4,B0019NG7SQ,"While I have purchased Seasons One, Two, and Three of 'The Next Generation,' Season One of 'Enterprise,' and 'Best of Both Worlds' on Blu-Ray from Amazon, I did not purchase Season Four of 'TNG' or 'Redemption' from Amazon. I typically pre-order, which I forgot to do this time. I randomly found them at Target for the same prices Amazon was offering($59.99 and $12.99), however Target gave me Season Four for $49.99 for buying them together. This is not something I would chance again because I've always preferred Amazon and its reliability.

""Redemption"" was not favorite two-part episode from 'The Next Generation,' however it's still a great story and offers a more fascinating look inside Klingon culture and politics.  The extras on the set include interviews with Michael Dorn (Worf), Robert O'Reilly (Gowron), Denise Crosby (Tasha Yar/Sela), and Gwyneth Walsh (B'Etor).  In the interests of consistency, since CBS Digital is handling the remaster of the upcoming release of Season Five, CBS-D handled the first part of ""Redemption"" which also appears on the final disc of Season Four.  I compared the quality of ""Redemption, Part I"" on the Season Four set to many of the other episodes on the Season Four set and I cannot really discern a difference.  Perhaps others can; my guess is if you're not working in the field you're not going to tell the difference.  The quality of the remaster is stunning!",1375228800,4,1410,5.004273504273504

3442108,4,B0019NG7SQ,"It's likely that most fans interested in this release have already seen ""Redemption"", the two-part cliffhanger that bridged TNG's fourth and fifth season.  In short, this politically-charged story centers around Worf's desire to clear his family name, the possibility of a Klingon civil war and the reveal of a mysterious woman that resembles a former Enterprise crew member.  As a two-part episode, it's quite good.  Most ""Top 10 TNG Episode"" lists won't mention it, but it's definitely an above average story that fans should enjoy revisiting.

This new ""feature-length edit"", like the one created for the Blu-ray release of ""The Best of Both Worlds"", is a little weak.  Both halves are simply mushed together with no real transition...and though some time has passed between the events of Parts I and II, you wouldn't know it by the way the two scenes are suddenly cut together.  I'll definitely watch it ""the traditional way"" in the future; like ""BOBW"", some things just can't be improved by further editing.  I don't mind getting up to switch discs, honest.

The Blu-ray tech specs, on the other hand, are fantastic.  As expected, the A/V presentation is top notch, with brilliant picture quality and two different audio mixes (7.1 and the original 2.0 stereo).  Two terrific extras are also included, a 30-minute behind-the-scenes documentary with members of the cast and crew, as well as a full-length audio commentary with writer Ronald Moore and Michael & Denise Okuda.  Overall, it's a decent buy for TNG collectors, but only if you have money left over after buying the fourth season.  Like the ""BOBW"" Blu-ray, this is just an interesting curiosity.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

 STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION
TO BE AVAILABLE IN HIGH-DEFINITION FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER FOR ITS 25TH ANNIVERSARY

Star Trek: The Next Generation - The Next Level Blu-ray Disc(tm) Will Be Released On January 31, 2012

Complete First Season Blu-ray Available Later in 2012

 LOS ANGELES - September 28, 2011 - The beloved series STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION  will be transferred to high-definition for the first time ever and released on Blu-ray(tm), it was announced today by Ken Ross, Executive Vice President and General Manager of CBS Home Entertainment.

All 178 episodes from seven seasons will be transferred to true high-definition 1080p for release on Blu-ray and eventual runs on television and digital platforms both domestically and internationally.

""Fans have been clamoring for a high-definition release of STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION for years,"" said Ross. ""Transferring the series to high-definition presented difficult technical challenges, but our team has come up with a process to create true 1080p HD masters with true HD visual effects.  We can't wait to show fans how pristine the series looks and sounds with our upcoming Blu-ray releases.""

Transferring STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION to high-definition presented numerous challenges - The series was originally shot on film and then transferred to videotape, which was used to edit episodes together.  In order to create true HD masters, CBS is going back to the original uncut film negative - all 25,000 plus film reels of it - and cutting the episodes together exactly the way they originally aired. The visual effects were all shot on film and will be painstakingly recompositioned, not upconverted from videotape. The newly cut film will then be transferred to true high-definition with 7.1 DTS Master Audio. Denise and Mike Okuda are consulting on the project.

While the first full season won't be available until later in 2012, CBS Home Entertainment is releasing STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION - THE NEXT LEVEL, a single Blu-ray disc to give fans a taste of the series in HD, on January 31, 2012.  The disc will include the feature-length pilot - ""Encounter at Farpoint"" - as well as two more ""fan favorite"" episodes, ""The Inner Light"" (Season 5) and ""Sins of the Father"" (Season 3). The single disc will be available for a suggested retail price of $21.99.

One of the most popular series in the STAR TREK franchise, STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION celebrates its 25th anniversary in 2012. It premiered in first-run syndication during the week of September 28, 1987 and ran through 1994.

Set in the 24th century on the Starship Enterprise, about 100 years after the original STAR TREK series took place, the series starred Patrick Stewart as Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Jonathan Frakes as Commander William T. Riker, LeVar Burton as Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge, Marina Sirtis as Counselor Deanna Troi, Brent Spiner as Lt. Commander Data, Michael Dorn as Lieutenant Worf, Gates McFadden as Dr. Beverly Crusher and Wil Wheaton as her son Wesley Crusher.

STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION won numerous accolades, including 18 Emmy awards, and was the first - and only - syndicated television show to be nominated for the Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series for its seventh season.  It was also ranked #46 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time list in 2002.

So far, the footage on the video teaser is amazing...this bluray is worth it simply for seeing our heroes and FX and divine clarity. It's about time!!",1317254400,18,4229,4.960339943342777
3442128,5,B0019NG7SQ,"Alright Everyone... I just wanted to update you all with the latest news if you have not already seen it. I have been trolling the interwebs for months looking for any news of this infamous blu-ray set as I do not want to shell out around $300 for the DVD release if the blu-ray set is approaching.

News:

1. Remastered HD Star Trek: The Next Generation Episodes Could Stream to Netflix This Fall
[...] <-- Amazon removed this link, but you can find it on Gizmodo by searching for ""Remastered HD Star Trek: The Next Generation""

2. Levar Burton Twitter Post: ""Stopped by to see how the TNG conversion to HD for Blue Ray was coming along...""
[...] <-- Amazon also removed this link, but I found it on the Wikipedia page for the ST:TNG. It is under reference #44 and can also be found in the section titled ""Blu-ray Disc release""

So, if we are going to see a remastered HD release of ST:TNG on Netflix, logic would dictate that a full blown blu-ray release is on the horizon (or at least possible at this point). I mean they would be crazy not to release a full blu-ray set after soaking millions into a HD remaster and not try to recoup that money. I doubt the Netflix deal would cover that cost alone, even if it is exclusive. I really don't want to wait for the Netflix deal to expire before they can then release the show on blu-ray. So if this an exclusive deal for Netflix, and they bar the studio from simultaneously releasing on blu-ray while it is being streamed, then we could be looking at years before a physical release. I have to imagine that they would pursue as much captial as possible with a duel blu-ray release and a streaming deal with Netflix! And if Levar Burton saw a HD remaster in progress with his own eyes (visor?), then I want a release date. By the way Levar, it's Blu-Ray not Blue Ray LOL... thanks for letting us know...

By the way, I want a full blu-ray release for all Star Trek shows. TNG, DS9, VOYAGER, & the ever underrated ENTERPRISE! I thought for sure they would have had ENTERPRISE on blu-ray by now as this was shot natively in HD!

If any of you have new info to add confirming a blu-ray release of the Next Generation or any other Star Trek show currently only on DVD, let us know! I'll also update if I have anything more to add to the discussion.",1315785600,3,2293,4.333333333333333
3442129,5,B0019NG7SQ,I really hope they release this. I would even be happy with just the top 5 episodes on Blu-ray at this point.,1314230400,,109,4.0
3442130,5,B0019NG7SQ,"TNG, DS9, V, E - I want it all on BD ASAP!  I have TOS on BD and it is awesome to watch with my 9 & 10 yr old boys.

We're on our 3rd time through TOS BD.  (1st time enhanced FX, 2nd time original FX, 3rd time enhanced FX effects again.)

I would love to watch the rest of the ST TV series on BD with them while they're young.

Number 1, go number 2 and get off the pot!

Well, I got THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS for the extras, and that and the low prices on these made me order all the rest a day later!
I love em. And I love the full movie-like experience. And the quality of sound and visual is rich and satisfying. But even more than that, I love the care, joy, and info with which the makers have infused the extras! The docs are great and in old all cast members, which is rare even in some huge movies, and the commentary tracks, which I rarely get excited enough to even try, are so enveloping and informative, they give a deeper level of enjoyment. I can't believe these were made and with such care--so luckily they did so just before the bottom dropped out of the physical media industry.
These extras, if you didn't know, are NOT included on the season blu-rays or the complete box set. The makers were given more budget to do more (thankfully) when the studio decided to make these 2-part episodes available as stand-alone movies with the ep's edited together. .
For the price they've fallen to now, it's really an easy decision to get em. I'm so glad I did!",1503187200,,1321,4.418032786885246

8274851,5,B0019NG7SQ,"I enjoyed this two part combination of season 4 ending to season 5 transition giving us a small view of the Klingon existence, their way's, their beliefs, their struggle between the ancient Klingon traditions and new way's that keep showing up time and time again. Some have said a lot of time went by between Redemption (season Finale) and Redemption 2 (Season Premiere), They were probably hoping for a fill in to make up that time (Hoping for a good transition.) That should have been done when these episodes were originally being created. Such a fill in is not possible since the Tng episodes ended May 23, 1994. If the actors returned in 2013 to do this as well as the other 2 part episodes they made, they would be hard pressed to explain the fact that those people who played these parts would look much older in the filler then in the original episodes, With an age difference of 19 years! Thus its not possible unless the filler consisted of none of the enterprise crew and only others throughout star fleet filling in the transition piece. So we are left with the only true way of doing it short of having a bunch of alternate 2 part series for the 2 part episodes consisting of only young alternate replacement crew members playing in place of the aged ones. One day they will come out with a computer graphic program that has the ability to create the actors age specific as they were and with Kinesiological movement that precisely mimic's their movement, gestures, facial nuances and also have anticipatory reactions nuances for the moment to moment interacting's of people and places. We can look to the future for said technology and knowledge. I hope this helps in some way of the difficulty of said projects today.",1475625600,,1733,4.666666666666667

Worf learns what really being a Klingon is all about and what is really important to him and he is also reunited with his brother Kurn and has the chance to get his honor back to this family name.  The Federation has to choose between entering into the civil war with the Klingons or just letting things play out knowing that the Romulans are helping one of the families in the Klingon Empire to wage the war with supplies. Also Captain Picard learns about a decision he made in the past that comes back to haunt him.  The special features are: audio commentary by Ronald D.
