4099372,5,B0039YAKYK,"This was a wonderful documentary detailing the plight of the Baltimore Colts Marching Band after the evil Irsay moved our football team in the middle of the night.  Because of Barry Levinson's involvement in the making of this story, in no way would I have expected it to be boring.  Good job in showing us the passion of those in the Band.",1380672000,,340,4.467741935483871
4099373,5,B0039YAKYK,"I was in Barry Levinson's 5th & 6th grade classes at P.S. #64 (teacher - Michael J. Connelly) and never imagined he would become such a fabulous chronicler of 1950s-60s Baltimore and its beloved Colts.

This is a memorable and tear-jerker movie for this old Colts devotee but fans of any team will understand and embrace it. I've watched it six times and it gets better each time.

A superb accompaniment to the film is the book by Michael Olesker, ""The Colts' Baltimore"" (2008). I love the Ravens and their thrilling improbable run to the Super Bowl 2013 but the closeness between Colts' fans and their beloved teams is impossible ever to duplicate. The story of the Colts Marching Band will live forever, thanks to Levinson's fine film.",1373500800,,738,4.7578125
4099374,5,B0039YAKYK,This documentary is wonderful for anyone from Baltimore that remembers the day that the Colts left town...it is an inspiring movie that shows that Baltimore really is a football town that would do anything to get the game back! I cry everytime I watch it! Fantastic! A must have for any football fanatic!,1360713600,,304,4.754716981132075
4099375,5,B0039YAKYK,Barry Levinson did a great job and I enjoyed the old football footage.  It was a funny and also touching film.,1360368000,,110,4.238095238095238
4099376,4,B0039YAKYK,"4 stars. I didn't know the story much beyond that the football Colts packed up one night and left for Indianapolis. Oh and that the owner was hated in Baltimore. After watching this I can certainly see why. The story of the band sneaking their uniforms away from the ownerships hands, and still meeting, practicing, and performing was interesting. I wish more had been devoted to the band and their music.",1337299200,2,405,4.71830985915493
4099377,5,B0039YAKYK,"No one understand why the Indy Irsays can't use the ""Colt"" name in Baltimore. We will never call them the _____ because the Irsay's do not deserve the name! This film goes a long way in helping folks understand why we Baltimore folks are so passionate about the old Colts and love our Ravens so much now!! Know what I mean HON!",1327881600,,327,4.290322580645161
4099378,5,B0039YAKYK,"I have lived in Baltimore My whole life. I have been a Ravens fan for as long as I can remember. As such, I am aware of the great football past. We loved our Baltimore Colts, but they were not only taken away from us, they were taken away from us in the middle of the night and with no one having any knowledge of it. Although the band had no team to play for, they stayed alive for 12 years to show the NFL that we love football and wanted a team badly. This documentary is a great account of Baltimore's past present and future of Football all thanks to The Band that Wouldn't Die.",1290988800,3,583,4.0344827586206895
4099379,5,B0039YAKYK,The video is really a fantastic work by Barry Levinson.  If one grew up in Baltimore following and loving the Baltimore Colts he or she would really get emotional over watching the colts band continuing after the demise of the Baltimore Colts.  A truly sensational work!!,1280534400,,271,4.869565217391305
4099380,5,B0039YAKYK,"This is a great recap of events leading to the ""hijacking"" of the Baltimore Colt football team, as well as the efforts to regain a professional team and the tremendous fan and Marching Band loyalty during the lapse years. A must for all Baltimore Colt fans!",1272240000,2,257,4.608695652173913
4099381,5,B0039YAKYK,"I strongly suggest this documentary to anyone. This documentary isn't just for Ravens fans. Yes it gives a little history of football, but it really shows what dedication and team work can really do. It's an incredible story that should be recognized. People don't always see Marching Band as being something worth paying attention to. If it wasn't for John, there would be no us, we wouldn't exist. It's a story that can relate to anyone who watches it. I never really understood what happened in the past because it happened when I was a baby. I have heard people talk about it, but I felt like I was able to experience it by watching this. Watching this documentary showed me why I love this band.",1268092800,7,700,4.563492063492063

8392526,5,B0039YAKYK,"A fantastic documentary on the history of marching band in a city that lost its football team overnight and without warning. Witness the Baltimore legend, John Ziemann, take a chance and stand up against all odds to ease the mournful hearts of the citizens through one very special fight song and bring back football to their city. A must see.",1512345600,,343,4.733333333333333

I was so excited! Thank you for carrying this film!!! Amazing!!!! The Baltimore Colts Band is in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. We were inducted in 1990.,1457740800,,325,3.8507462686567164

8392533,5,B0039YAKYK,"Even though I have grown up in the Baltimore/Washington area, the Colts were gone before I turned 8.  I was in college when Baltimore got the Ravens.  So, I didn't have any direct emotional, or nostalgic connection with the Baltimore Colts or the Colts fight song.  However, as a student of the game's history with many family members (my mom included) who grew up as diehard Colts fans, I had always been outraged at how horribly Bob Irsay treated Baltimore.  I was even more outraged when NFL commissioner, Paul Tagliabue, screwed Baltimore out of a well-deserved expansion franchise.

  I felt good for the city when they finally did get the Ravens and I have enjoyed giving them secondary support over the years (my primary devotion will always be with the Burgundy and Gold).  However, as much as I knew about the horror story of the Mayflower vans stealing the Colts away in the dark of night, it is fascinating to see this tale, and its aftermath, told from an angle that was not highly publicized... that of the Baltimore Colts marching band.  A band that was as much a part of NFL legend as the Redskins marching band, the Colts band used chicanery to keep their uniforms and instruments after the theft of the team.  Then, they spent the next 12 years being a band without a team, keeping the dream alive of one day bring football back to Baltimore.

  As much as the efforts of any politician, businessman or NFL executive, the Baltimore Colts marching band was responsible for the return of football to Charm City.  It is touching to hear and see the stories of those band members and everything they went through out of their dedication to a sport and a city.  This is definitely one of the top ""30 for 30"" documentaries.",1381017600,,1734,4.620915032679738
