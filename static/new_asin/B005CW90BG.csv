8465973,4,B005CW90BG,"This is the second disk in the three disk series where the narrator reads and provides his explanation of the esoteric aspects of the Voluspa.  Don't expect too much regarding the visual aspects of this video, but this is also the way that wisdom was passed for millennia.  There is a guy sitting in the woods reading from a book and talking.  The information is good, and while some of it is his own interpretation a lot of it is quite illuminating.

The main reason I gave this one a four star is because of the sound.  The Southern California woods he records in were windy that day, and the scratching sound on the microphone at times was severe; on top of that the camera lens cap was doing a number on the camera at times, which was very distracting.  I think re-recording without a camera lens cap and putting up something next to the camera to limit the wind noise would make this much better.",1470528000,2,901,4.397590361445783
