8160327,5,B000L82UPO,"Refuge, a fast-moving, colorful film shot in Asia and the USA has many fascinating interviews and has captured the sensitive, vital relationship between the Tibetans (since their flight after the 1959 Chinese invasion) and their new home being welcomed by two generations of spiritual seekers living in the West. Their tragedy is our blessing. Film-makers, nuns, lamas, the head of a zen center and others reveal their practice of Buddhism bringing the teachings of Dharma into everyday life. I liked what Oliver Stone said about it in Refuge, he does not feel he is on a path, but is a ""student of Buddhism."" It seems to me a path indicates a beginning and end, but an intelligent philosophy that asks us to examine our mind, our motives, be kind to others, and practice non-violence is a way of life for many lifetimes. This documentary is a good teaching tool that should be watched and rewatched many times because we meet interesting people who are living better because their Buddhism is a daily life practice. Congratulations to John Halpern who produced and directed Refuge, may he continue to do such fine work.",1357862400,,1120,4.869109947643979
8160328,4,B000L82UPO,"This is a very interesting documentary with some really cool interviews with people like Martin Scorsese, Oliver Stone, Bernardo Bertolucci and Philip Glass as well as The Dalai Lama himself.

This DVD's biggest weakness is low production value, particularly the editing. However the subject matter, people, and information in the film are all worth putting up with some bad green screen.",1207699200,,388,5.360655737704918
