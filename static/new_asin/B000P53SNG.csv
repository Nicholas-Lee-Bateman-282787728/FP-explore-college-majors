8319486,3,B000P53SNG,"Sonic Fury is said to be the only PAL (European) title released for the Action Max game system, and for good reason, it sucks!
Could you imagine going to the store and purchasing a game system and finding out that it is not only horrible quality, but that the system only has one game? Anyhow, the only reason I would recommend buying this p.o.s. is if you like torturing yourself with bad games, or if you are a retro game collector, or console collector, and need this system to complete your console list, or are just curious about VHS games. Just check out the Action Max youtube reviews if you wanna know what it's like, and you will be glad you didn't buy the system in reality.",1360108800,,684,4.393700787401575
