8498028,5,B006H3KR2U,We are being so stupid and this movie makes that point very well.  We are being so stupid.  I was tempted to take a break in watching several times because I was getting upset; not at his message but because we as a species are ignoring the message.  David Attenborough was saying much the same things 30 years ago.  We are being so stupid.  We are destroying our environment and saying we can't afford not to.,1402358400,,410,4.342105263157895
8498029,5,B006H3KR2U,"A lone wolf cries out from the wilderness, but who is listening?
Everyone should be, but the message is just too hard to stomach for most humans.
Well written, clear, and scientifically supported, this book is worth reading if for no other reason than to see how our Earthship has been holed and is sinking.",1358035200,,307,4.6
8498030,4,B006H3KR2U,"A nice little film about the life of this wonderful scientist, narrated by himself. This is based on his 'legacy' goodbye lecture. It's charming and nice to watch, but it didn't have as much science as I expected.",1357516800,2,213,4.631578947368421
8498031,5,B006H3KR2U,"This is a wonderful reality check for the less-informed... Also humorous and moving. It may not contain ""answers"" to change our fate... but I'm really not sure it's not ALREADY too late. I think what I got from this, along with David's book ""Legacy"" ... Hold your loved ones close; don't waste these precious years on ""fluff""; on those not so admireable; our years may be fewer than ""?our leaders?"" foresee. Thanks David... from an OLD Canuck.",1349481600,2,443,4.766233766233766
8498032,3,B006H3KR2U,"I was browsing the documentary/non-fiction movie section of my local library the other day in search of something worthwhile to watch, and fell upon this. Let me state upfront that I had never heard of David Suzuki, but reading the DVD box notes, this looked like it could be interesting, so I picked this up and took a chance on it.

""Force of Nature"" (92 min.) starts off with reminding us (or, in my case: making me aware) that David Suzuki is ""the godfather of the environmental movement in Canada"", and that at the eve of his 75th birthday, he was to deliver a ""legacy lecture"" of his own work and views. I thought that was a little bit strange, like tooting your own horn. However, once the movie started, it worked well for a while, as the actual lecture is interwovern with separately filmed segments and archive footage of David growing up (in British Columbia) and the world around him (being of Japanese heritage, Davis says ""Pearl Harbor was probably the defining moment in my life"", and then explains why). Later on we see David visiting Hiroshima. Even more powerful are David's tales of working in Oakridge, TN as a US government science researcher while the South was still segregated, and on and on. Great stuff.

The theme of the lecture, though, is predictable. Think ""An Inconcenient Truth"" but even more preachier (""Humans are a force of nature!"") and less entertaining. Like I said before, I had never heard of this person before, and shame on me I suppose, but he didn't comes across very well or didn't give me a sense I needed to find out more about him. But that aside, I really can't rate this as a ""great"" movie. It's sometimes entertaining and insightful, but too preachy for my liking. Viewers beware!",1347494400,2,1731,4.65359477124183
8498033,5,B006H3KR2U,"If you love your planet and wish someone could explain why we should be aware and care, then this is for you! this guy hits the nail on the head! I had no clue who David Suzuki was and ran into this film by accident, goes to show how nature works, since watching this film Ive recommended to my fam,those around me. Ive been inspired to keep at my work and art, thank you David for giving a guy hope.",1340064000,3,400,4.0125
8498034,5,B006H3KR2U,"David Suzuki is a hero of our times.  I have read his book, The Legacy, but was deeply moved by his movie, which had more of his personal history.  And a great message for our future generations - whom sadly will be inheriting a terrible mess from us who have raped and pillaged the planet with no thought beyond our immediate gratification.  As I study Ecology, Biodiversity and Animal Welfare, I often despair at what I am learning.  David's vision gives me hope and drives my ambition to teach children more about ecology and the desperate need we have to maintain our planet and all that is on it with us.  This really is an absolute must see for high school children to educate and fire up their passion for nature now!!",1337731200,6,725,4.462121212121212
8498035,1,B006H3KR2U,"If you are interested in David Suzuki then this is for you.  Great if you want autobiographical details.  David Suzuki shares some stories from his life.  As for his scientific musings, there are too many debatable moments, a lot of theoretical asssumptions.  He rings the alarm bells but then provides no concrete solutions, very disappointing from someone who is known as a great thinker making his definitive lecture.",1336780800,,420,5.132352941176471
