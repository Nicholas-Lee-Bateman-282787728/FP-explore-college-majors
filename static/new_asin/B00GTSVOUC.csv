8627487,4,B00GTSVOUC,"A nice example of Borzage's early sound work.  Excellent performance by Ralph Bellamy.  Print quality is good and slightly better than UCLA's ""restored"" print although it could be from the same source material. Very nice little ""slice of Americana"" story!",1444262400,,255,5.35

8627489,3,B00GTSVOUC,"The description above is for a different movie. The correct Fox ""Young America"" summary is: Art is an orphan in trouble with the law, who is given a second chance with the Dorays - a couple who own a pharmacy. However, when Art and his friend Nutty break into the drugstore to get medicine for Nutty's dying grandmother, the boys motives are questioned. Academy Award winner Spencer Tracy is featured in this 1932 film with Doris Kenyon, Ralph Bellamy and Tommy Conlon. (There is also a Jane Withers film with the same title.) I don't know this movie but Frank Borzage's films are usually good, often sentimental. See imdb.",1433289600,2,623,4.724770642201835
