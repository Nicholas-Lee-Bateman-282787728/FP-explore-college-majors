6928871,3,B00RDTK452,"pricey, remastered video ok, but subtitles aren't.

in a few scenes the spoken words can't be heard over the music, other sounds. So in these cases you must rely on subtitles.

If dependent on subtitles then be warned subtitles don't always match the spoken words - words missed, wrong words, whole sentences missed. The hearing get  more complete speech. Don't understand why someone didn't proof for completeness and accuracy. The other two volumes suffer the same fate. Two stars for subtitling.

6928876,5,B00RDTK452,"I fell in love with Joan Hickson's Miss Marple back when this series first came out. While Margaret Rutherford had barged through the role like a battleship (I have this set - her sidekick is her real-life husband) and Geraldine McEwan later twinkled away like the good witch (I also have these sets) Joan Hickson seemed to get it just right. Like another reviewer, I was delighted with the blu-ray upgrade of Volume 1 and eagerly await volume 2 and also 3 which is coming out in June . The advantage of this series is that the plots follow the original novels closely, no fol-de-rol. Agatha Christie wrote in a straight style with no silly side-trips and endless complications which we have in the later Marple renditions. I have read all 82 of her books. Another advantage was that Joan Hickson, who played the role of the housekeeper in  a Margaret Rutherford movie, was told by Agatha Christie that she should play Miss Marple. So who better than Agatha Christie herself to recommend this series?",1427500800,15,1000,4.714285714285714
6928877,5,B00RDTK452,"Volume 2 of the remastered Miss Marples, starring Joan Hickson, is outstanding in its crisp picture and clear sound (as was Volume 1). Joan Hickson is perfect as Miss Marple. No one else has come close, in my estimation, which is why I'm happy to plunk down my dollars for this remastered set of elegantly plotted mysteries, even though I already have the 2000 DVD issues. Or maybe it's because I have the 2000 DVD's, as I have nearly watched them to death.

In this BluRay/DVD set, Volume 2 has 4 episodes on 3 DVD discs or 2 BluRay discs. You get 454 minutes of mystery viewing. That's 27 minutes more than the total in my old DVD's, because the remastered Miss Marple has deleted scenes added back in. You get ALL the Miss Marple here. Episodes are presented in the original 4:3 aspect ratio. Sound is still mono, but it has been cleaned up. English subtitles are available.

Joan Hickson's Miss Marple originally aired from 1984 - 1992. For some reason, the shows aren't listed in order of their original airings, for any of the volumes. Hickson made 12 Miss Marples in all, and this is the 2nd of the 3 remastered sets - which have 4 episodes each.

There is one Bonus Extra, on the last disc, which I found fun.

Episode 1 ""They Do It With Mirrors""
Miss Marple travels to London to catch a show with her friend, Ruth van Rydock. At lunch, Ruth brings up her sister: ""It's Carrie Louise. That's what I'm worried about.""
Jane, ""Carrie Louise? Well, she was always delicate.""
Ruth, ""Oh, no. She'll live forever. If she's allowed to.""

Ruth is so concerned, she arranges for Jane to visit Carrie Louise at her house, Stonygates, which her husband has fashioned into a ""rehabilitation center for young criminals."" She finds a house full of family characters who keep saying, ""Poor Carrie Louise"". And then there's the young men. Are they reformed or reformable?

Episode 2 ""A Pocketful of Rye""
Mr. Fortescue, of Fortescu Holdings, is in a jolly mood when he arrives at his office. But by the time the secretary brings in his tea, something is dreadfully wrong. He collapses and is dead before the ambulance arrives. Fortescu was obviously poisoned and it's going to be an intriguing case for the police, especially as the dead man has an envelope of rye in his pocket.

Nobody seems terribly displeased by the man's death. His very young wife has a lover. One son, who'd worked for his company, was rewarded by his father calling him ""a miserable petty-fogging clerk."" A second son had been driven away 20 years ago. Fortescu is described, by more than one person, as ""a horrid man"".

Which doesn't mean he deserved to be murdered. Fortunately for the truth, Miss Marple becomes involved when Gladys, the Fortescu maid, calls her for help.

This is a well-written story, though it starts slow. I like the poignant ending.

Episode 3 ""4:50 From Paddington""
It is October, 1957. We know this because the newspaper headline shows the West's dismay at the launch of Sputnik. Elspeth McGillicuddy is going to enjoy herself with a trip to visit her good friend, Jane Marple. She takes the 4:50 train to Milchester, and from there to St. Mary Mead. Elspeth has a compartment to herself, and settles in with a murder mystery novel. Before long, though, she nods off, and is asleep when it turns dark outside.

She wakens when the train slows for a crossing. It is passing a slower train which runs parallel to Elspeth's train until it's passed. She looks out her window, idly watching the cars of the other train, when she is horrified to see a man strangling a woman in one of the compartments. His back is to Elspeth, his gloved hands throttling the woman. Next we see Elspeth, she's at Miss Marple's cottage, crying, ""Jane, oh Jane! I've just seen a woman killed!""

The practical Miss Marple takes her friend to the county constabulatory to make a report. To Inspector Slack to be specific, and the look on his face when he sees Miss Marple is priceless. Unfortunately, over the next 2 days, the police turn up nothing, and Slack tells Miss Marple, ""The fullest inquiries have been instituted, Madam, on the basis of the defective information you furnished, because we have some respect for you in the county.... And may I remind you there's an offense called Wasting. Police. Time.""

There's nothing for Miss Marple to do but take matters into her own hands.

This episode is Miss Marple at her best. It is one of my favorite ever episodes. I even love it in the Margaret Rutherford version, because no one can go stomping around the countryside like Rutherford.

Watch ""4:50 from Paddington"" also to hear one of the best (almost closing) comments by Jane Marple, when she muses to Cedric Crackenthorpe: ""She's not in love with him yet, of course. I rather think that she's attracted to you. But she'll marry him, make him what she wants. And then she'll fall in love with him. Probably when she's expecting their third child.""

Episode 4 ""The Mirror Crack'd From Side to Side""
Jane Marple's dear friend, Dolly Bantry (see the episode ""The Body in the Library"", Volume 1) has sold Gossington Hall. Her husband died and she just doesn't need such a large house anymore. So she moves into Gossington Lodge and takes a trip around the world. On return, she stops in St. Mary Mead to see Jane, and invite her down for the St. John's Ambulance Garden Party. In the past, it was held on the grounds of Gossington Hall, and the new owners, the Hollywood duo of Marina Gregg and her husband Jason Rudd, have agreed to keep up the tradition.

Dolly is agog to tell Jane the gossip about Marina. She had a successful American movie career until she had a breakdown and became a recluse. But now she is planning a comeback with a new movie directed by Rudd. Gregg throws herself into being Lady of the Manor for the fete. Too bad someone will be murdered.

This is a very good Agatha Christie in that you are given a clue to the murderer's identity, twice, clues to catch or miss in the best mystery tradition. This is my favorite version of ""The Mirror Crack'd From Side to Side"", though the 1980 movie version with Elizabeth Taylor playing Marina Gregg has its charms:

....BluRay/DVD Bonus Feature:
""A Very British Murder, Part 2: Detection Most Ingenious"" (50 minutes)
This is part 2 of a 3-part television series that originally aired in England in 2013. The series is hosted by Dr. Lucy Worsley. Part 1 covered murder in Britain before the police force had a branch dedicated to ""detecting"" murder. This part 2 shows how the Metropolitan Police Force comes into its own in the later half of the 19th century. And we also see how the advent of cheap books and cheaper broadsides make amateur detectives of the reading public.

In 1842, the London Met set up a small operation called the Metropolitan Police Detective Force at Scotland Yard. ""They aimed to make policing a science."" I've always found it fascinating that in the beginning, police work was not considered all that respectable. That's why the NYC police force had so many Irish cops for so many decades. In the beginning, the only ones who would take the jobs were the immigrant Irish who were discriminated against for other work.

In England, Lucy tells us how it was Charles Dickens, an immensely popular writer, who made the detective a hero. ""In 1850, he published a whole series of articles about the detectives. He was doing something quite important. He was making them look like they were respectable, and even glamorous, characters to his middle-class readers.""

For part 1 of ""A Very British Murder"", you can catch it on the release of the first volume of remastered Miss Marples, starring Joan Hickson:

6928878,5,B00RDTK452,"But not so for Miss Marple! who always stays focused on what's important, and doesn't fall for Agatha Christie's conjuring tricks as the reader so often does in looking in the wrong direction just after being given most important clues. Fortunately, these adaptations of Agatha's Christie's deliciously entertaining mystery novels are finely adapted from the original and are exquisitely well handled by Joan Hickson as Each story, moreover, has been completely remastered so that they look much better, as well. Herein, besides ""A Pocketful of Rye,"" we have other gems including:

They Do it with Mirrors
In the words of Inspector Curry: ""But we've just got to get the facts clear. Get it all clear.""
""Oh, yes, I know,"" said Miss Marple. ""So difficult, isn't it? To be clear about anything, I mean. Because if you're looking at one thing, you can't be looking at another. And one so often looks at the wrong thing, though whether because one happens to do so or because you're meant to, it's very hard to say. Misdirection, the conjurers call it. So clever, aren't they?"" And later, she adds: ""Like conjurers,"" Miss Marple murmured vaguely. ""They do it with mirrors is, I believe, the slang phrase.""

4.50 from Paddington
""The trouble is, said Miss Marple, that people are greedy. Some people. That's so often, you know, how things start. You don't start with murder, with wanting to do murder, or even thinking of it. You just start by being greedy, by wanting more than you're going to have.""

The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side
""Most people have a sense of protection,"" Miss Marple explains herein.  ""They realize when it's unwise to say or do something because of the person or persons who are taking in what you say, and because of the kind of character that those people have.""",1420934400,23,1786,4.807817589576548

She can travel to other places, but the microcosm she has observed fits the macrocosm of the big world.
This is THE WOMAN that Agatha Christie herself wanted to play Marple.  Ms. Hickson played the maid in one of the first movies featuring the character.  No one else comes close, and other actresses, some very good ones have tried.
I have been reading good detective stories since I was a girl.  They can touch on so many other topics.  It is a great medium for some of the best writers.  Now I am much older and can see even more how much Miss Marple surpasses almost every other.
People say things, did say things to a woman they would never say to other people.  Women are, or always were more observant.  In the past decades women were very much underestimated.  That can prove to be an asset, being underestimated.

The story ends without ever figuring out why this happened, although one part of the story is resolved.  I have had to go back to the book to learn what the subplot was all about.

6928953,5,B00RDTK452,"I am probably  one of the few reviewers here who did not see this series when it originally showed on PBS. Yes, I've seen other Miss Marples but not Joan Hickson. And I agree that she is the perfect one!

I looked at some other reviews posted for each of the three ""collections"" being released by BBC Home Video - each with four stories (varying in length from 90 minutes to two hours), and beautifully remastered for great color and sound -  and I see some really lengthy ones that describe each story in minute detail. I'm not sure I understand why they would do this since, after all, these are mysteries and they are best enjoyed (in my opinion, at least) when you know very little. And, all the stories are great and so knowing even the subject won't make you enjoy these sets any more.

Yes, you could easily start with any of the three ""volumes"" as Marple stories do not need to be read (or watched) in any special order. BUT, if you are interested in the significant (in terms of time)  bonus feature  - a three-hour ""documentary"" exploring the Brits love for crime and detective fiction - you probably want to start with Volume One.

Now, as for the ""documentary"", I have to say I was disappointed with it - for a number of reasons. I expected to see many excerpts from British TV mysteries and they aren't there. The three hours are ""hosted"" by Dr. Lucy Worsley. Who is ""chief curator of the Royal Palaces"" in London. Worsley dresses up in period costumes and recreates some of the famous crime stories by visiting the locations. What bothered me most was Worsley's speech inflection. She has a strong lisp and - sort of like BARBARA Walters she can't pronounce her ""r""s and they come out like ""w""s .  This may not bother you but it did bother me a lot and made watching what I hoped would be a great bonus a chore.

Even without the bonus docu-drama with Worsley , these sets are worth getting to watch Hickson as the low-key crime solver in stunning colors and sound. (Remember though that these were filmed from 1985-92 so, though they now have HD resolution, the image aspect is still the old standard 4:3 ratio.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

6928968,5,B00RDTK452,"Even thought these were filmed in 16mm (the BBC standard) they are still a great improvement over the old washed out standard definition film transfers from the early 1990's.

The episodes have been completely remastered to high definition quality from the original film elements by BBC Studios and Post Production's Digital Media Services team.

Regarded by many fans as the definitive Miss Marple, Joan Hickson was one of the oldest actresses to take a lead role in a major television series when she was cast as Agatha Christie's soft-spoken, sharp-eared sleuth at the age of 78 in 1984. She retired eight years later, having completed 12 mysteries in the Miss Marple series - four of which are collected in this volume.

These are in their original BBC versions, which varied greatly in their broadcast. Some as one episode, others split into multiple episodes.

*Region Free with English Subtitles*

disc 1
THEY DO IT WITH MIRRORS (11th in the TV series) Dec. 29th, 1991 - A murder happens at a country house right under Miss Marple's nose.
single episode - 1:56:21

A POCKET FULL OF RYE (4th in the TV series) March 7th & 8th, 1985 - A nursery rhyme comes horribly true.
part 1 - 53:08
part 2 - 54:22

disc 2
4.50 FROM PADDINGTON (9th in the TV series) December 25th, 1987 - A woman is seen murdered on a passing train, but no body has turned up.
single episode - 1:54:03

THE MIRROR CRACK'D FROM SIDE TO SIDE (12th in the TV series) December 27th, 1992 - Heather Badcock is killed by a poisoned cocktail, but was she the intended victim?
single episode - 2:00:34

Bonus:
A VERY BRITISH MURDER (part 2) - 50:42 - continuing the documentary about victorian murder mysteries starting to use science.

Unlike volume 1, most of the mysteries on this volume play out un-interrupted as one long story, but none of them run the almost 3 hours as those in volume 1.  This is likely because most of these are the last to be produced.
The BBC has decided to present these mysteries in the order in which the BOOKS were published, and not the order in which the TV series was produced.  Otherwise this would have been set #3.",1431302400,4,2120,4.594164456233422

What pleased me most was that despite this DVD being described as a Region A/1 Blu Ray NTSC it is region free.  It plays perfectly well on my Region B/2 Sony Blu Ray player as does Volume 1 in this series, and I will be ordering Volume 3 as soon as it becomes available.

I read the books and stories first and Joan Hixson fits almost exactly my mental picture of Miss Marple. The videos are well made. The one thing I didn't really care for was the way the stories were divided.

In most ways there shows are very similar to what BBC produces today but the old fashioned styles of this 1980s production are fun to see, for example the police station is one large room and the officers' desks are simply folding tables.  Also strange that Miss Marple gets so little screen time.  Joan Hickson brings a Ma and Pa Kettle sensibility to the role.",1510963200,2,526,4.623655913978495
