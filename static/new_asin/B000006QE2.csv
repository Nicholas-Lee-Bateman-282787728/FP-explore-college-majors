I have to say I did not know much about how she got started and how she became famous. It pretty much shows her youthful beginnings to the last days of her life. This well done biography is one of the best on Betty ever done!
Thank you A & E for doing a fantastic job and giving us fans an insight into the life and career of Betty Grable, the woman with the Million Dollar Legs! This woman was HUGE in the 1930s and 1940s and even had one of the most famous ""pinup posters"" of all time before there was Farrah Fawcett in 1976! lol  ** It was sad to know that Ms. Grable had to star in her last movie, a FLOP called ""How To Be Very, Very Popular"". She passed away in July 1973 from Cancer.
If you want to know all about BETTY GRABLE, you MUST GET THIS DOCUMENTARY!
Highly recommended!",1426377600,,850,4.059523809523809
7904616,5,B000006QE2,"A loving, almost totally accurate biog on one of Hollywood's original superstars.  Tributes galore from co-workers and friends, including Debbie Reynolds, Alice Faye,  Jane Withers, Carol Burnett and tributes from fans  and friends, including Hugh Heffner, Mike Levitt and Bob Isoz. However, I  was disappointed that daughters Vicki or Jessica did not contribute to this  glowing tribute.
Rare early shots of Betty (in films like ""Happy  Days, 1930) right up to her last screen appearance in 1955. Best moments  are of Grable visiting vets hospitals during WW2, and having fun with  servicemen at the Hollywood Canteen. Also rare footage of Grable between  scenes, out-takes, and having fun at an army base with Rita Hayworth. Her  romantic affairs are also well represented, including Jackie Coogan and  George Raft.
 Her career is extended to include her many tv shows and  stage appearances, especially ""Hello, Dolly!""
Most honest and  moving moments are when Debbie Reynolds is onscreen talking about Betty's  troubles in her marriage to Harry James. A gem of a biography.",934070400,23,1076,5.284023668639053
