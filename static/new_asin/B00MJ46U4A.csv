6583488,5,B00MJ46U4A,This is a helpful and sensitive film regarding ageism and genderism that is seldom discussed in a healthy way.  It can lead to a discussion on these subjects.,1438992000,6,158,4.642857142857143

6583490,5,B00MJ46U4A,"This is actually an amazing little film.  Force yourself past the initial ""ick"" factor, and you'll find a movie with heart and an outstanding lead actor in the fairly untested Pier-Gabriel Lajoie from Canada.  Apart from some kissing, the sex is only implied, as the focus is on the characters, particularly the lead character, a young teenager discovering a surprising new side to his nature.  His minimalist facial expressions keep us interested from start to finish.",1436745600,14,469,5.144736842105263
6583491,5,B00MJ46U4A,"This was a movie with a really unique take on the youth oriented toward youth culture we live in.  I did not find this movie unbelievable at all as some reviewers did.  There are a number of websites of younger men looking for older men.  I have personally know several same sex couples with a good many decades difference in age and it was not about the money.  Anyway, this was a very sweet movie and I liked it so much I watched it twice in two nights.  I anticipate watching this one again and again in the coming years.  There are a lot of nuances that don't seem clear on the first or second watching but with time and repeated watching, I expect to become even more in love with this very likeable young man.  I would love a sequel, and maybe someday Lake will find his true love.",1428364800,13,787,4.206666666666667
6583492,4,B00MJ46U4A,"Film maker Bruce La Bruce has always courted controversy and along the way made some very interesting films and I am glad to say he has kept that up with his latest offering. This tells the story of Lake who starts to find he is attracted to older men. He has a very nice girlfriend - Desiree- who is the same age as him, but something must be missing.

Then his mum gets a job at an elderly persons care home and she offers him a summer job, which he takes to like a duck to water. Once there he also finds that a lot of the patients are being fed tranquilisers in order to keep them in a semi conscious state. He befriends one such man and soon Lake realises he is more than drawn to older men and he lets nature take its course.

Now there is some nudity in this film, but for Mr La Bruce it is positively restrained. What this film is when it is striped back is a love story plain and simple. There are very touching moments and some well observed humour too. The down sides are the plot holes that have been done for dramatic effect and so can be just about forgiven. The acting is all above average too and Pier-Gabriel Lajoie as Lake is very engaging and convincing in the role of the young man discovering `silver love'. A very different film and I am glad to have seen it; Bruce La Bruce continues to surprise and even though sometimes the surprises are not very nice I am grateful that he keeps trying.",1420848000,14,1412,4.168498168498169
6583493,1,B00MJ46U4A,"Bruce LaBruce has a special fantasy. Here it is: a disarmingly beautiful 18-year-old boy falls passionately in love with him NOT because he promises to put the kid in a movie but because he's old and ugly. BECAUSE he's old and ugly, not in spite of the fact that he's old and ugly.

Now, I'm neither young nor gorgeous myself, and I (and every other old gay man) may have a fantasy just like that tucked away inside of me. The difference is that I didn't make a move about mine. Despite what LaBruce thinks, watching an old man's erotic fantasy acted out on screen is not entertaining to other people.

On top of that basic flaw, this movie's screenplay is very, very, very stupid. As a comedy it's never funny; as a romance it's completely absurd; and as an erotic fantasy it's just embarrassing. The basic story, of a young man falling in love with a much older man, could be made into a really wonderful movie, but not in Bruce LaBruce's talentless, narcissistic ham fists.

Pier-Gabriel Lajoie is breathtakingly beautiful, but he can't act. Looking at him, with the sound off, and skipping every single scene in which he does not appear alone, is all that could make this turkey watchable. That movie would be about five minutes long.",1418860800,7,1238,4.592760180995475

8672717,5,B00MJ46U4A,"A must have it you want a poignant love story involving a handsome you man and an older gentleman.  I love Pier-Gabriel Lajoie in this part as he will become the heart throb of the gay community.  He is excellent in this roll and shows so much love and passion to the older man he has a relationship with.  I have watched this film several times and I had to have it for my collection.  You will love the story and the sentiment of this coming of age event of a young man discovering his sexuality.  The cast, scenery, setting and plot of this film are wonderful!  I hope to see Pier in many more gay films to come.",1454976000,5,615,4.126050420168068
