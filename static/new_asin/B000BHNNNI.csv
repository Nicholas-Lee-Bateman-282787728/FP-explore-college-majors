2417314,4,B000BHNNNI,"This video is a no-nonsense show of how to massage a woman to orgasm.  It starts by showing the anatomy of a real women's sex organs, then continues to show how a man can manually stimulate a woman to orgasm.  The 40 minute show is mostly a man massaging a woman in full view of the camera and in front of several audience members.  There are plenty of detailed views of the vulva, labia and clitoris, and how the man moves his fingers across the clitoris. The audience members sometimes ask the man and the woman (as well as two women who sit nearby) questions about technique and other matters.

One question from me would have been ""why is the '1 o'clock' position on the clitoris the most sensitive""?

The video is best for men and women who do not know what the female sex organs look like, who are unwilling or unable to communicate to their partners about what feels good during sex, who do not know where to put their hands and index finger during stimulation, and who do not know what manual stimulation feels like.

The theme of the video is like a medical documentary: a matter-of-fact description of anatomy and techniques. The woman in orgasm was not screaming and tearing the sheets; she was quietly moaning in pleasure for several minutes. The video is certainly not like a pornographic film or a steamy sex drama.

A final note:  the video was produced in 1996 on VHS, but today's DVD version has poor sound quality sometimes.  For this reason, I gave the DVD 4 stars instead of 5.",1138406400,42,1497,4.4944649446494465
2417315,5,B000BHNNNI,"""Thanks for changing my life! It all began a few weeks ago when my girlfriend showed me this DVD.

When my husband is out of town on business I often stay with my girlfriend and her husband. A few weeks ago while there on an overnight visit, her husband was also out of town so my girlfriend and I got into some girl-talk. After a few glasses of wine she said she wanted to show me a DVD that one of her girlfriend  had shown her. When I wondered aloud as to whether it really worked, she said, ""You better believe it does!"" When I then said, ""You mean your husband has done this to you?"" She said, ""No, he doesn't know anything about this yet, my girlfriend did me. It was the best orgasm I've ever had. They call it ""doing"" and I'm telling you it really works."" I couldn't believe what I was hearing and then she said, ""Is this making you as wet as it did me? I was so envious when I saw this the first time. My girlfriend taught me how to ""do"" a woman like this. I can ""do"" you if you want.""

I couldn't reply, but also couldn't resist when she led me to the bedroom and helped me get naked. What she did to me after that produced the most powerful orgasm I've ever had in my life. After she had ""peaked"" me a couple times she then leaned forward, pulled my clitoris hood back and very gently and tenderly kissed the tip of my clitoris. I went into orbit!

Anyway, I felt I had to share this with you and thank you sincerely! Now all I need to do is get my husband a copy of this D.O. video.",1130112000,33,1494,4.003355704697986
2417316,5,B000BHNNNI,"Deliberate Orgasm - Expending Female Orgasm Volume I was the video that completely changed my sex life and I am thrilled to see it now on DVD. I had never heard or even thought of a man touching a woman's genitals with such attentive precision as is shown in this video, that he could create that kind of pleasurable sensation in her body continuously for as long as they both want it. I had never heard or believed that women could be in orgasm right from the beginning to the end until I saw it in this video. My partner had seen it and really wanted me to watch it and do it to her.

Pretty soon, I was giving her better orgasm consistently than I had ever given any woman before. I watched it again recently and there is still more wealth of information about how to do a woman. The instructors describe in details what they are doing and feeling throughout the demonstration, answering very good questions from the audience.

Any man who wants to get his woman off better, any woman who wants her man to know how to touch her, there is not a better place to start than this video.",1127952000,33,1085,4.287804878048781

8086863,1,B000BHNNNI,"They guy plays with the clitoris of a woman, using his index finger, for the entire video. That's it! The woman has an orgasm even before he even starts to really stimulate her. She's sort of a human automatic-orgasm machine. The sound quality is horrific, often barely audible. Who ever put this together should be embarrassed by the low quality of the content and the lack of quality of the production.  The video quality is that of what you might expect had this been filmed in the 60's. Don't waste your money! There is NOTHING extraordinary about this guy's 'technique'.  I only wasted about 20 minutes of my time watching this video.  If you want the 'technique', just do a Google search for extended orgasms.  I am somewhat amazed that anybody would put this 'product' on the market and continue to charge someone for it.  It's really THAT BAD!!  All I can say is, ""Practice, practice, practice!""
If you are sexually clueless (and lots of people are), I suggest that you buy .  Due to the horrible sound and video quality, I am returning my copy for a refund.  If you do buy one of The Welcomed Concensus, buy their ""Deliberate Orgasm: The Technique of Peaking and Extended Orgasm""  The quality is much, much better and it has everything in it (and more) than does this piece of crap.",1406160000,3,1291,4.602620087336245

8086865,5,B000BHNNNI,"It seems that while so many people have been busy theorizing WHY women have a clitoris and the function of female orgasm, these people seem to have dedicated themselves to WHAT to do with one and the fun you can have with a woman's natural energy or tumescence as they call it.  These are the only educational dvds my partner and I have ever viewed that are dedicated to the direct stimulation of the clitoris in a manner that is precise and easily visible. Their 92+ collective years of experience on the subject could potentially make anyone a leading authority, but I believe in quality over quantity, and have found both facets in these DVDs.

The first of the set, Deliberate Orgasm- Expanding Female Orgasm, is a re-mastering of their first release originally filmed in 1996.  The making of the DVD was inspired by one of their most popular courses called ""Observation of Intense Coming"", a demonstration of a woman in orgasm for one hour.  The fairly extensive front graphics suitably set the stage for the demonstration.  That the clitoris has the highest concentration of nerve endings is not particularly new information, and is an excellent explanation of why to put such focused and precise attention on this delightful little organ.

Once the actual demonstration begun I was a bit uncomfortable staring at a complete stranger's private anatomy, about as up-close and personal as a camera can get.  The details revealed visually were unmistakable; the involuntary release and contractions, color changes and drastic engorgement inside and outside of her entire genital area.  As her orgasm was underway, her moans were in perfect harmony with the contractions and the sensation was palpable even through the audio/video medium.  Often times, the strokes were lighter than I had ever thought about stroking my own partner, and it seemed that very subtle changes in them would alter what she was feeling.  We noticed this after several viewings, there is so much to see and feel.

Many of the questions  posed by the student audience were similar to our own, like: what each of them was feeling, why is manual stimulation the most effective way to produce an orgasm in a woman's body, what does the man get out of it, how long can a woman orgasm, etc.  I was quite impressed with how both the man and the woman could answer questions even while in the state of extended and intense orgasm.  For us, the remaining unanswered question was, how does he continue to take her on the ride of an extended orgasm while seemingly having the sensation increase over time?  This was the specific question that the entire Deliberate Orgasm - The Technique of Peaking and Extended Orgasm was designed to answer.

The Technique of Peaking video features a different woman. It also has been re-mastered and since it was made four years later the quality of production has been vastly improved.  As in Volume I, this DVD is chocked full of valuable information regarding producing what they refer to as a dome-shaped orgasm, an orgasm with peaks and valleys, leaving the woman higher than she was when they started. A very informative teacher panel discussion precedes the actual demonstration.  Many valuable points are touched on but the most notable is the differentiation between the various signs of orgasm and the actual amount of sensation or pleasure she is feeling. The anatomy lesson is reviewed, which some might consider repetitive,  but we found it interesting to see another woman's anatomy described in detail and think this can not possibly be done too often.

The demonstration is similar to the first DVD, lasting about 25 minutes. The different strokes he used to peak her are shown and discussed throughout, providing a fine repertoire from which to choose, and some basic expectations of what each stroke will produce in her body.  The gold mine is in the description of precisely when to change the stroke. We found this approach very refreshing and effective.

In our experience, these DVDs far surpass their promise to provide the viewer with the basic fundamentals of better orgasm. They have provided my partner and I with a whole other slice of life.

8086866,5,B000BHNNNI,"Deloberate orgasm: Expanding female orgasm, is a window for people wanting to raise their bar of pleasure in the bedroom. This Volume One is a very informative film that goes over the basics of the pleasurable act, the technique of pleasuring a woman, that is called DOing.  I found my self interested in the DOing technique itself and the helpful hints on the female anatomy.

Although I found it hard to hear sometimes (I just turned up the volume), it was full of the woman-pleasing information I had been looking for.  Emphasizing my sex life on women's orgasm feels like the right place to go for me and the video has taken me there.  I personally have wanted to raise my intention in the bedroom and this DVD has given me some wonderful techniques that have added on to my sex life and will continue to fill up the pleasure in my bedroom.
I was already having some good sex, but watching this video has brought my sex life up to a completely new level of good.
I have already watched it again and I really have picked up more information than the last time I watched it.

I defiantly would recommend this video to anyone who is looking to improve their sex life.  I have been a lot happier since I started using this information in my relationship.",1182643200,7,1254,4.454148471615721
8086867,5,B000BHNNNI,"Using the techniques described in this video, my partners and my sex life has gotten even better! He describes the changes he observes in my genital area, and I love to hear his fascination with how beautiful it is. I now describe the sensations that I feel while having sex, and the shared appreciation we have for each other has increased.

 Our connection is on more levels as we focus on the sensations of each moment and sharing them together. This sharing is extending into other parts of our relationship as well.

 I also have come to enjoy the sensations of stages of orgasm rather than merely focusing on the climactic going over the edge.",1181606400,8,649,4.6173913043478265
8086868,5,B000BHNNNI,"How rare it is that two people are willing to share such intimate details of their sensual lives with the public. So, when these four instructors made this DVD, I felt like they had graciously gifted me with the precious knowledge of DOing. There are few places someone can go to learn how to produce superior orgasm in a woman's body. Having incorporated this information into my own sensual life, I find it to be a pleasurable addition.

  I had the same question one of the audience members posed regarding intimacy. Is DOing really that intimate?  The male teacher cleared that up when he said that he and the woman on the table were constantly talking and that she had to be completely honest with him for her to get what she wanted. The kiss that they have at the end of the DVD dispelled any doubt that there was a lack of intimacy.

  I appreciated him talking about intention and attention when DOing a woman. It was clear that both people had agreed to put their attention on HER orgasm. As her clit reached down toward her perineum and inner labia flared outward, there was no doubt she was in a heightened state of orgasm.  The visible contractions through her genitals complemented her pleasurable moans.

  I can only assume that the people who buy this video want to have a better sex life. I was not disappointed. Thank you for re-mastering this valuable DVD.",1175040000,16,1375,4.571428571428571
8086869,5,B000BHNNNI,"The video begins with a brief introduction of the concept of DOing

(Deliberate Orgasm) and warns the viewer that the language used in this production is at times explicit. Next we are provided  with a practical demonstration of the DOing technique in front of a live audience. You never actually get to see the audience but they are invited to ask questions before, during and after the demonstration.

The technique of DOing places the emphasis firmly on a woman and, as explained by the instructors, is a deliberate and focused sex act in itself. When asked if it was foreplay the reply was a resounding no, this was a sex act in and of itself and after I'd watched the video I began to see why.

After some audience questions, the demonstration of the technique begins, but not before we are treated to a female anatomy lesson. It's one thing to look at pictures of a females anatomy, but it's quite another to actually watch as they touched and explained each part of her vulva and anus as you see each piece of the puzzle slowly react and fall into place. As the woman lies back, the man begins to apply the DOing technique but not before he's applied plenty of lubrication and explained why. They also point out how the woman looks before the session, a little flushed from anticipation, etc.

Before long the man is busy putting into practice what he teaches as he manipulates her clitoris with deliberate and controlled movements. The close up shots show you the reactions of her genitals, something that as a woman is hard to see without a mirror or being a contortionist. The man explains each movement and responded to questions from the audience. The most important of which I felt was what he was getting out of the whole experience. He stated that we live in a society where intercourse is considered the ultimate goal of sex, and we often forget to just enjoy the sensations that we can create in another's body just by simply touching. One guy in the audience appeared to have some difficulty understanding that just by feeling your partner's reaction can be just as sexually satisfying as having full on intercourse.

It was obvious that either of them had any difficulty understanding that concept as they carried on with the demo while answering questions.

The man is obviously skilled in this technique and she is soon relaxed. He does explain that there was a lot of communication between the two of them when they first began to explore DOing.  Many of the terms used  do require a little thinking out of the box at times. If fact, the whole DOing concept would for many I suspect.

It was both interesting and erotic to watch the woaman's reactions to his gentle manipulation of her clitoris. The way he could get her to almost peak and fall over the edge of orgasm and yet never quite let her get there, building and then gently bringing her down, allowing her to take breaks if she wanted too. It was pretty obvious that he was paying attention to not only what he was doing but also to what she was experiencing in her body.

The whole demonstration was drawn to a close and her entire demeanor, complexion and look have changed since the beginning of the 30 minute demonstration. This is then followed by a textual reminder of what the concept of Deliberate Orgasm as a technique is about.

This was a great video and one that I enjoyed watching. Although it was amateur in appearance at times, it was real. The woman's reactions to the man were real as were his to her. The interaction with the audience was a wonderful way to bring in questions and answers without it becoming boring or contrived as many technique video's can be.

The technique of DOing does require some rethinking of the way many of us view sex or the actual act of sex itself, but I'm sure there are few women that wouldn't want their partner to at least give this technique a try after watching this video. Ladies, if you want to give your partner a new perspective on sex, this video is a great place to start.",1174608000,25,4014,4.558333333333334
8086870,2,B000BHNNNI,"I do personal growth coaching that includes work in the sexuality area. Some of my clients come to me with issues with body image, inability to relax during sex and often times shame and guilt. This video can be a real aid to normalizing shameful feelings around masturbation, teaching intimate anatomy to those unfamiliar with how to find the clitoris or what changes occur in the genitals during the sexual response.

On the downside, I don't think there is a lot of content presented that one can't find somewhere else. This is primarily a video that shows a model masturbating or being masturbated. If you are familiar with basic female anatomy, sexual response and how to touch a woman, there isn't much useful beyond this.

I think this product might be a good conversation starter for couples who have shyness around discussing sexuality. However, you can learn most of what is here by simply talking to your partner. There are some tips and tricks that are useful, but nothing that you can't get more of in a good book on sexual practices. A good book will cost you considerably less, however.

I'm guessing that there are two audiences looking at this video for purchase, those that want to learn something or overcome a sexual arousal issue and others who are seeking something exciting to watch i.e. looking to find erotica. I don't think this video quite meets the criteria for either.

I know there are many people who disagree with me below and perhaps I'm missing something or taking something for granted. However, I wished I saved my money and I haven't recommended this to any of my clients.

Personally, if you want to learn to stimulate a woman, I strongly recommend making it a shared experience and talking openly to your partner. Perhaps you can use a mirror or video camera to capture a visual. I think this is more likely to build intimacy than watching this somewhat clinical presentation.

I'm not saying there is no value to be had from watching this video.  I'm just saying that I don't think this is a panacea formula for sexual satisfaction.  Apparently many other reviewers disagree with me, but I have shared this video with a few folks and they have had a similar reactions. If you are looking for something erotic rather than educational, I definitely recommend that you look elsewhere.

I could see from the voting that many people aren't finding my review helpful.  I would appreciate your comments on why this is so because I am offering an honest opinion that I've taken the time to write at length and compliments the other reviews which are mostly favorable.  Perhaps some of the dissatisfied customers are not bothering to write a review?",1161302400,44,2680,4.766738660907127
8086871,5,B000BHNNNI,"This DVD answered many questions I had regarding Doing a woman.  From lubricating her to the towel off stroke.

One particular question stands out the most (I need to watch it again to get the details). A student asks the instructor how much pressure was required to provoke the desired orgasm in a woman's body.  The instructor replied that it was not the speed, pressure or length of the stroke, but his intention on her orgasm that was the key to producing the desired result.

DO Volume I is a video with an abundance of information which requires multiple viewing to truly integrate all that is offered.

 I was fascinated observing the female instructor's genitals change as her orgasm progressed.  The way her clitoris extended out from her hood.  The engorgement of her inner labia.  The color changes.
