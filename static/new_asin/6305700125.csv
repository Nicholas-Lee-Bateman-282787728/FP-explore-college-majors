7893202,5,6305700125,"These are 9 marvelous guides who shine a ight on the path.  They are not afraid of aging, so the viewer can also relax and discover the ""up"" side of growing old, a side that is not celebrated by our ""culture of youth at any cost"".
Yes, this is a rave review by me - one of the producers of this film, but I would be saying this anyway, even if I had nothing to do with making it.  And now I am older...and they were correct.  It has its advantages.",1388275200,,448,3.901098901098901

7893205,5,6305700125,"I just watched this wonderful video with a friend during our lunch hour - I am feeling a peace that I was not expecting.  Julie Harris, Richard Kiley, Hume Cronyn, James Earl Jones, and all of the other ""players"" have helped me renew my desire to grow old gracefully.  The poetry, the photography, the spirit of the whole presentation is delightful beyond words.  Though I felt teary at times, and very sad knowing that Richard Kiley has passed away since doing this video, I am going to purchase my own copy and share it with my friends and family.  If you have any reluctance whatsoever to watch this, trust me - it is more than worth it.",1004400000,5,640,4.444444444444445
7893206,5,6305700125,"Each time I see this video, I am moved by the artistry and inspired by the poetry, the people and the beautiful truth of the message. It is a work of art that I wish everyone would see, for it is a delight to behold.  I  recommend it for everyone.  It is totally wonderful!",952646400,7,273,4.018518518518518
