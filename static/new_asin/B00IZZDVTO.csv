6307120,4,B00IZZDVTO,"In this chilling movie about justice and revenge Jimmy Vickers (Danny Dyer) is dishonorably discharged from the service. Shortly after his return home he discovers his parents have been ruthlessly murdered. Vickers goes nutty and starts trying to discover who is responsible. With no official help from the police, but a bit of help from one of his friends on the force, he gets the name of one of the gang members. This name leads to other names and Vickers savage journey of retaliation begins.

His revenge isn't your run of the mill stuff either. We learn that Vickers was a member of a super secret special force that specializes in interrogation. He uses his skills to get the information he needs and then dispenses his own brand of pain upon these criminals. The line becomes blurred with each kill and we start to wonder who the real criminal is. Will Vickers get the satisfaction he is searching for or will he still feel empty at the loss of his parents even if he gets everyone involved? What will the real price be in the end?

This flick rocked! I loved it! It takes place in London which is just a cool location for a movie to begin with. The action is non-stop and the story line is a bit more intricate than you might expect from a movie of this nature. I found myself rooting for Vickers even when I questioned his sanity. The story starts out at a good pace and progressively builds to a heart pounding finish. There are many reveals throughout the movie as we learn more about who Jimmy Vickers is and why he is so good at what he does...interrogation.

The bad guys are as ruthless and hateful as any criminal I have ever seen in a movie. A great cast of actors indeed. I found myself despising these guys and cheered as Vickers eliminated them in his savage and inhumane fashion, but these thugs deserved everything they got. They were truly scum of the Earth types. Maybe that makes me a bad guy too but hey, it's just a movie, right?

I recommend this one wholeheartedly if you are a fan of revenge type of films such as the Death Wish series. This one is right up there with those. The DVD has some good extras such as deleted scenes, and commentary by the director Stephen Reynolds and lead actor Danny Dyer. It's money well spent to add this to your movie collection.",1403136000,15,2294,4.454761904761905
6307121,4,B00IZZDVTO,"Jimmy Vickers (Danny Ryer) returns to London and discovers his parents have been murdered by a gang. Jimmy was in special ops in Afghanistan and he vows revenge. He is given a lead by Griff (Michael Ryan) a friend on the police force. He goes Charles Bronson on the gang with his Rambo training, making each kill slow and painful.

The film leads things open for sequels. The movie is straight forward without much in the way of twists or surprises, following a standard successful formula set forth in the ""Death Wish"" series. Fans of ""Death Wish"" will find enjoyment in this film.

Who cares for suspense when we know the bad guys need to be punished and should be punished for their crime?  The recipe in this movie is in the killing.  The killings are gruesome and very surprising.  Don't we wish such a hero to clean our streets in real life.

6307176,3,B00IZZDVTO,It's the oldest story in the world.

6307181,2,B00IZZDVTO,"Very minor spoilers in the review, so tread carefully.

Not very good. Acting wasn't great and quite honestly, there is no challenge. The dude is an elite soldier taking on street thugs one by one. I thought ok, its been too easy so far. Surely when he comes up against the huge guy with all the muscle, it will be a knock down drag out fight.

Nope.

In fact its one of the easiest endings. At no point do I feel like Vickers is in any real danger. The guy who ordered his crew to do what made Vickers go on his Vendetta is supposed to go last and be the climax of the film. That didn't happen either.

I had just gotten done watching a few Aussie films and greatly enjoyed them. They didn't need the special effects and nonstop action that American films are centered around these days. I have watched a few older Brit films and enjoyed them as well, so I gave this one a shot. I was disappointed in it. There was no challenge for the 'good guy' and half of the bad guys didn't even know who the hell he was or why he was doing these things to them. It just wasn't a very good or believable film in any way.",1445990400,,1109,4.073394495412844

The plot was formulaic and predictable, and the violence was pretty over the top and graphic; not just shooting and stabbing, more like psychotic ways to torture people to death. It seemed like they were trying to cash in on the torture porn genre that was so popular a few years ago (Saw, Hostel, etc.) and still have a mainstream crime drama.

It has a lot of action, but everything is so extreme, it never seemed real.  At the same time, it did provoke a great deal of anger in me.

6307249,5,B00IZZDVTO,Outstanding movie. I've been on a British movie kick for awhile and Vendetta caught my attention. It was so good I watched it 2 nights in a row. The first time by myself and the 2'nd night I shared it with some friends who all thought it was outstanding also. The movie depicts what the police have become in England for instance by locking up and charging a man because he chose to defend himself and his attacker died. Bruce Payne is perfectly cast as a returning soldier avenging the brutal death of his parents by brutal thugs.,1430956800,,531,4.428571428571429

6307354,2,B00IZZDVTO,"Like all the vigilante movies that have come and gone before, this movie follows the worn out formula of ""tragedy strikes the main character's family member(s) and he goes about cleaning the streets of the scums"". Now here's what's wrong with these movies, beyond the obvious ""taking the law into your own hands"" righteousness. The main character is ALWAYS a white man who has been wronged by a group of thugs, most of them brainless, scumbags of a minority race. There's always a pervasive racist tone to these movies where it's a white man's duty to rid the earth of dangerous, criminal minorities who will torture, rape, and kill your family and threaten the superior, peace loving white race. Of course, to not make this so overtly racist, there always is one or two brainless white baddies thrown in to be justly killed off as well. Characters in these movies do not exist in a world that's often gray in it's morality. The good guy is ""pure"" and bad guys are that, just bad with no redeeming qualities. This makes killing them off in myriad gruesome ways acceptable, even enjoyable to watch for audiences who get their kicks watching bad guys die. Well, sorry white folks, righteousness and justice is not the sole realm of your color and you can't ""death wish"" all the perceived bad minorities away.",1418083200,,1306,4.732456140350878

6307470,2,B00IZZDVTO,"Any story that kills off Emma Samms in the first act is going to have issues, and Vendetta does. The brooding Danny Dyer, as Jimmy Vickers sets off after the baddies who burn his parents to death and what happens is a predictable porridge of gunfights and things going boom that any fan of the ""Blow Up Man"" type movies would be deeply familiar.

This film breaks no new ground and Dyer contributes very little to the dimension of his character. With first rate production values, this film doesn't deliver and while not a complete waste of time, I would only recommend Vendetta to the true hard-core fans of the genre.

Much better alternatives would be Layer Cake or the epic The Last Good Friday",1414454400,,698,4.576

6307603,1,B00IZZDVTO,"I watched 10 minutes of this movie and not one character had done a single logical thing. To top it off, the exposition was handled as clunkily as a ten-year old writing a mystery novel. A tough guy beats up a patron in a pub while the extras in the background go on eating and drinking as though nothing happened. A girl making a bank delivery gets cut off at a stop sign by thugs with NO OTHER CAR behind her and doesn't simply put her car in reverse and get out of there (her preferred response is to panic and she even fails to lock the doors). A loving couple, on first introduction, are telling each other how much they love their son (the main character), who is coming home from Afghanistan soon (this is called an information dump, and is a cheap form of exposition). The main character, on his way home from the airport, looks thoughtful and touches his wedding ring--ooooh, I wonder what that portends...The acting was wooden and borderline hilarious, especially from the bartender at the pub and his wife. This had such an amateur feel to it that I am surprised a professional studio produced it.",1412294400,10,1108,4.49009900990099
6307604,4,B00IZZDVTO,Excellent movie. You can't help but want the main character Jimmy to succeed. Over all the movie delivered a good experience from start to finish.,1412208000,,146,4.88
6307605,5,B00IZZDVTO,Damn this is one of my all time favorite. The movie keep you guessing. Love the movie,1411430400,,85,4.0588235294117645
6307606,5,B00IZZDVTO,This movie kept me entertained throughout..will certainly watch it again,1411430400,,72,6.3
6307607,5,B00IZZDVTO,"Great action flick from the UK.  First time we say D. Dyer and he is an interesting, sort of unexpected action guy.
Had some good Principles about vengeance too. We enjoyed it.",1410998400,,176,4.5
6307608,5,B00IZZDVTO,this was not made for an academy award- it was made to entertain and is one of the best revenge movies since Death Wish.,1410739200,,120,4.041666666666667
6307609,3,B00IZZDVTO,This good (kind of) takes revenge over evil has been done before many times.  This time with a barely understandable English accent.  If you like this theme you'll probably enjoy this movie.  The bad guys are really bad & the good guy is only kind of bad.  I rooted for the kind of good/bad guy.,1407974400,,295,4.3090909090909095
6307610,5,B00IZZDVTO,Dang good movie!,1407196800,,16,4.666666666666667
6307611,5,B00IZZDVTO,"the British can certainly do Gangster type robbery movies better than anyone....well tied with the Chinese and Japanese. years ago there was a movie with Charles Bronson avenging his wifes murder and daughters rape, the title escapes me but this movie ""Vendetta"" is along similar lines. he is avenging his paernts murder and he is a member of an elite British para-military group. he has the bad guys and the good guys after him as he humts down the bad guys and does away with them in some very imaginative ways. Danny Dyer is one of my favorite British actors and every part he plays...he is perfect. Very violent, lots of cussing and sometimes the cockney/Liverpool/Blackpool accents get very thick and hard to understand. Stick with it.",1406505600,2,740,4.834645669291339
8646916,4,B00IZZDVTO,I enjoyed this. I thought the acting was good and the plot was agreeable.,1513987200,,73,4.285714285714286
8646917,1,B00IZZDVTO,"A laugh a minute. The son home from Afghanistan. The father, a taxi driver, who intervened in a robbery attempt, killed the brother of a drug dealer, set alight, along with his wife, in revenge. The church is Orthodox? Is the protagonist a Cypriot immigrant? The wife, with perfect makeup, serving up a cup of tea, just before dawn. The violence is welcome, because one bad actor after another is eliminated.",1507248000,,408,4.76056338028169
8646918,5,B00IZZDVTO,"Unfortunately this could what may well be one of the only ways to get justice in today's world. Not condoning it, just saying because of liberal policies criminal have little fear of reprisal today. Aside from that I really enjoyed this movie, good acting, good story line and an ending that bodes for more to come.",1506643200,,315,4.642857142857143
8646919,4,B00IZZDVTO,Mild violence. Great action and storyline  I will look for more movies like this to watch on amazon prime. Thank you,1494028800,,116,4.523809523809524
8646920,5,B00IZZDVTO,"Yeah....it makes me exactly like the disgusting psychopaths in the movie, but I found the revenge somewhat satisfying. The man was right...arrest them...and they either get off, or spend time in prison playing cards. There isn't any real justice anymore. The revenge in this movie was very creative, I must say. Somewhat graphic....but not too bad, and they don't dwell on it. Great movie, great acting, although the psycho's were somewhat unbelievable, in their lack of fear. The movie left it open for a sequel...maybe there is.",1493510400,,530,5.103448275862069
8646921,1,B00IZZDVTO,"Awful movie, I have amazon prime so it was mostly free to watch, however, I would like to be refunded for the hour of my life that was wasted.",1489190400,,142,3.9310344827586206

8646923,5,B00IZZDVTO,"Accurate depiction of incompetence of police and the breakdown of society. Civilians are forced to dispence justice. Coming to a american cities soon. (It's already here in Chicago, Detroit and Baltimore). Ugly, dark and intense.",1484784000,,229,5.571428571428571
