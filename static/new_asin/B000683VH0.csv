2174909,5,B000683VH0,"If you see only one foreign film this year, make it this one.  Let me make this really simple.  If you like Western's you have a chance of liking this film.  If you like sword fights, you have a chance of liking this film.  If you like gorgeous scenery you have a chance of liking this film.  If you're interested in the Tang Dynasty, you will like this film.  Having said that if violence in the movies bothers you then this is not your kind of film.  This film is rated R.  Zhao Wei is in the film too, so if you like her, you'll like the movie.  As an added bonus the soundtrack is great.  So that should the all you need to know to figure out if you will enjoy Warriors of Heaven and Earth.",1102464000,7,694,4.0
2174910,5,B000683VH0,"In the western frontier, a lawman is tasked to look for an outlaw before he is discharged of his duties and eventually go home to his family. The outlaw in question is a former soldier who became a fugitive when he and soldiers loyal to him refused an order to massacre the enemy's women and children. Wanted for mutiny, he is on the run. But rather than make his living being a bandit, he supports himself as a mercenary.  The two cross roads again when the outlaw and the lawman join forces to protect a caravan against a more vicious enemy. Sounds like a plot from a typical Western? Of course, but the West in question is Western China during the Tang Dynasty. Grabbing familiar elements from Spaghetti Westerns, director Ping He managed to make an exciting and immensely enjoyable tale of honor using a slice of Chinese history framed by the beautifully-photographed vast expanse of the Chinese Wild West. Commendable performances by the actors (notably Wen Jiang in his best Toshiro Mifune impression and of course, the graceful presence of the luscious Zhao Wei) are expected but the most memorable is the deliciously over-the-top performance  by Wang Xuegi as the sinister warlord.  Although the ending is somewhat marred by a literal deus-ex-machina device, it is still a must-watch for all Chinese, epic and Western movie fan.",1097971200,25,1336,4.8766519823788546

2174930,2,B000683VH0,"I'll admit that the sets,
locations and costumes were
excellent and the action
was quite good,
but aspects of the plot,
the girly ""Buddhist"" monk
(it actually was a girl)
and the mystical crystal fantasy
weirdness presented as some sort
of pseudo-historical event,
were awful.

Why not play it straight?

The interesting moral dilemma
of one warrior (1) following an order
to carry out an execution on another
warrior (2), who's crime was
disobedience by his refusal to murder
unarmed women and children held as
prisoners and then killing some of
the men who tried to kill him for
doing so was a good aspect of the plot.
The relationship that developed
between the two men was also
well done.

The baddies, the Turks, and their
alliance with a nathty-wathty warlord
were on the trail of the power crystals
being not-so-secretly transported in a
camel caravan accompanied by mystery monk
and protected by our two warriors and
some others and there was a young woman
under the protection of warrior #1 along
for the journey.

It spirals completely out of control
at the end.
What were they thinking?
What does all that fantasy weirdness
have to do with Buddhism or authentic
history of the Tang dynasty?
Nothing!
The moral dilemma mentioned,
which was a major plot element,
was not resolved.
At least the nathty warlord was killed
by girlie mystery monk who rose from
the dead to kill him with supernatural
hand-stab technique.
A different ending might have rescued
the movie.

Perhaps and probably, this film
was produced for a pre-teen audience
with pop, new-age sensibilities.
If that's you, go for it.
Otherwise, skip it.",1287964800,5,1623,4.887272727272728

Although anyone could say that this is predictable story, the sequences of scenes keep the audience in hold with the plot.

The movie cast is well balanced specially between Harrison Liu and Nakai(this one with a great stoic character).

In addition, the different settings where the film was shooted were  really impressive in terms of variety of colors and landscape.

Read several reviews of recent (post-1990) martial arts movies.  The description of Warriors of Heaven and Earth sounded appealing.

Unfortunately, I was sadly disappointed. Far from the epic fantasy that I was expecting and hoping for (a la Crouching Tiger or Hero), this movie felt more like a Martial Arts version of a Spaghetti Western.

There wasn't much ""heaven"" or ""magic"" portrayed in the movie (barely toward the end) and what little of ""Earth"" was showed was mainly a few forest shots and then lots of drab Desert (pretty depressing).

In all, not the worst movie I've ever seen, some may like it. The fights, though few and far between, have their moments.

For now, I'd label this one a ""rental"" unless you're a hardcore fan and have seen everything else. Crouching Tiger and Hero is is not (in terms of artistry, costuming, etc.).",1216684800,2,2341,8.733333333333333
2174939,4,B000683VH0,"I ran across the DVD of Warriors of Heaven and Earth and as the price was right I decided to give it a shot.  Having already fallen in love with Japanese films I though I could give a Chinese film a try - and I am definitely glad that I did.

Warriors of Heaven and Earth is NOT just a swordfighting action movie, nor is it a martial arts, ""Wire-Fu,"" movie.  What Warriors IS is a dramatic story with well rounded characters that has some fantastic action/fight sequences.  Actually, I'd say that this movie, in some respects, reminded me of a more dramatic Indiana Jones movie.  All the visual splendor is there, all the adventure and excitement and peril is there as in an Indiana Jones movie, and there's even a bit of the supernatural like an Indiana Jones movie.  Where it departs from Indiana Jones is in the drama department.

The script for Warriors of Heavan and Earth is very, very good.  Many characters are fleshed out and well rounded, the plot makes sense, and the pacing is excellent throughout.  This is a touching movie, as the two main characters who are supposed to fight to the death learn to respect and even like each other - but it's not done in a forced or unnatural way.  It's done slowly, with their actions providing the foundation for the respect and admiration they develop for each other.

The Amazon.com review mentions Warriors being a bit of a Western, showing more than a little John Ford (particularly The Searchers), and that is absolutely true.  Director He Ping (or Ping, He, if you prefer) definitely channeled both John Ford and Akira Kurosawa while he was making this movie.  Sure, there are bits of Spielberg and Yimou Zhang (or Crouching Tiger era Ang Lee), but those bits are kept to a minimum, and work to great effect WITH the John Ford and Akira Kurosawa elements.

Now, maybe comparing ANY director to John Ford and/or Akira Kurosawa is unfair.  I don't think any director is going to live up to those comparisons, but in this case you can see the clear inspiration for He Ping's work on Warriors of Heaven and Earth.

The DVD itself is very good, with excellent picture and sound quality, multiple language audio tracks, a nice, ""Making Of,"" documentary, and several trailers for this and other films of interest.

If you haven't seen an Asian movie, but like Westerns or historical epics, this would be a great film to start with.  If you are already a fan of Asian Cinema, then I think from reading my review and the others already here you've got a good idea of what this movie is like.

Definitely RECOMMENDED.",1199059200,11,2563,4.593406593406593

2174942,4,B000683VH0,"My brother told me I should watch ""Warriors of Heaven and Earth"" (2003). Truth to be told, I was somewhat sceptic, as his taste in movies is somewhat different to mine. All the same, I must say that in this case he was right.

This film is quite original, due to the fact that it is set in 7th-century China, but at times seems like a Western. To make it a little stranger, there are some supernatural elements that fit the plot and make this movie something that you are not likely to forget.

One of the main characters is a Japanese warrior (Kiichi Nakai) that has been in the service of the Chinese Emperor for a very long time, and that just wants to fulfill his last task before returning home. Unfortunately for him, that implies finding and killing a Chinese outlaw (Wen Jiang) that used to be a soldier, but that was condemned to death when he refused to kill a group of women and children. The two warriors play a game of cat and mouse, but decide to make a short truce in order to defend a caravan carrying a holy object, that is being attacked by bandits that want to steal it.

There are plenty of well-choreographed fights, but also opportunity to think about themes such as duty and honour. You will also appreciate the beautiful scenery of the Gobi Desert, and the brilliance with which the director (He Ping) was able to tell this story.

From my point of view, this is not a film that will only please those highly interested in Asian cinema. I think that everybody that is fond of an entertaining movie will appreciate ""Warriors of Heaven and Earth"", even though those who like epic films will certainly like it more. Recommended!

2174943,4,B000683VH0,"He Ping's Warriors of Heaven and Earth starts off in traditional Eastern epic fashion and with a few similarities to Musa/The Warrior - one of its protagonists is a Japanese noble eager to earn the Emperor of China's permission to return home after 25 years in his service - but it soon develops into something much more satisfying: an all-out Western, and one that's played straight for once. It may be set along China's Silk Road, but the landscape is classic American Western, from pine valleys to buttes that could have come straight out of the smaller corners of Monument Valley. Even the Turks who attack the wagon train - sorry, camel caravan - at Red Rock Gorge do so with Apache war cries.

There are some imaginative action scenes, including a neat swordfight between the two protagonists on opposite sides of a log cabin's walls, and the classic Western friendly enemies archetypes transpose surprisingly well to an Eastern setting. It's a shame that the caravan's cargo has supernatural qualities, because the film really doesn't need the fantasy element, but the special effects are at a bare minimum, as is wirework for once. This made little impression at the box-office, but it's well worth tracking down. Great fun.

The extras aren't plentiful - 25-minute making of, music video and brief trailer - but are adequate enough.",1143417600,6,1341,4.929203539823009
2174944,4,B000683VH0,"The idea of a Chinese ""western"" is appealing at face value and I certainly appreciated the fact that the warriors in ""Tian di ying xiong"" (""Warriors of Heaven and Earth"") were of a mature age.  I could easily see this being the sort of story where you had the likes of John Wayne, Henry Fonda, and Jimmy Stewart in the main roles.  It was just when I though of any of those stalwarts dealing with mystical blue light that I found myself wishing this story had been a bit more straight foward.  Then I remembered this was a Chinese film, which is why it is in Mandarin with English subtitles.

""Tian di ying xiong"" is set during the Tang dynasty, when ancient China covered most of Asia.  Lieutenant Li Zai (Wen Jiang) was a honored soldier in the Emperor's service until he refused an order to slaughter a group of Turkish women and children who had been taken captive.  After escaping, the Emperor put a bounty on the head of ""Butcher Li,"" hiring the Japanese assassin, Lai Qi (Kiichi Nakai) to finish the job before he will be allowed to return home.  Li has disguised himself as a Turkish mercenary, protecting camel caravans traveling the Silk Road from attacks by bandits.  While traveling through the Gobi desert, a terrible sand storm buries the caravan.  The only ones who survive is a single solider, a young Buddhist monk ((Yun Zhou), and Li.  Because the soldier saved his life, Li vows to protect the caravan until it reaches the capital.  This is when Lai Qi catches up with Li and challenges him to a fight.

Appealing to the honor of the assassin, Li proposes a deal: Lai will make three attacks on Li, and it Li loses then they will fight there and then.  But if Li wins he will be allowed to keep his vow and escort the caravan and then they can have their big sword fight.  Li wins the wager, and Lai follows the caravan from a distance.  When a local warlord, Master An (Xueqi Wang), starts attacking the caravan, Li and Lai become temporary allies.  Then they learn the truth of what it is the young monk is carrying and the stakes become even higher.

This is one of those movies where what is arguably the best action sequence comes at the start, even though all we are talking about is a sword fight that takes place in (and through) a cabin.  The key visual attraction becomes not the sword fights, but the vistas of the Gobi desert shot by cinematographer Zhao Fei (""Raise the Red Lantern,"" ""Small Time Crooks""), accompanied by the music of  A.R. Rahman and Qu Lixin.  Most of the characters reflect well-established types, which explains why ""Old Diehard"" (Wang Dehun), ends up stealing a lot of the scenes.  The main female character, Wen Zhu (Vicki Zhao), seems like she is going to be Li's love interest or perhaps another sword by his side, but neither pans out significantly.

He Ping (""Pao Da Shuang Deng"") directed the film and co-wrote the script with Zhang Rui (""Dao ma zei"") and he is clearly trying for something big.  That is commendable, but there are just too many moments where he associates taking things slowly with making things great.  Ultimately ""Tian di ying xiong"" relates better to the works of George Lucas than John Ford.  Given the characters, the situation, and the locations, the net effect really should have been a lot more impressive.",1139529600,8,3291,4.575085324232082
2174945,5,B000683VH0,"I am a HUGE fan of martial arts films, and passed over this movie a million times at BEST BUY.  I wasn't particulary impressed with the cover art and the story line involving the ""supernatural"" seemed uninspired as well ( I was scared it was going to be horribly cheesy).  Boy, was I wrong.  One night while mooning over when the House of Flying Daggers would be out on DVD I decided to order this movie through entertainment on demand.  My only regret is that I didn't just buy it in the first place because it was definately worth it.

  The best thing to me about the film was that it truly attained the status of being an epic adventure.  You become attached to the characters, you forget that this is an alternate reality of 7th century china.  The bad guys are SCARY, the good guys just don't seem to measure up to to them.  China itself is at stake.  The swordplay is masterful.  What more can a girl ask for?

  Sort of like Lord of the Rings (of course nothing compares to LOTR but you know what I'm talking about), the final battle left me breathless, I was sooo nervous that the good guys just weren't going to be able to pull it off.  Now, logically I know that the good guys almost ALWAYS win, but in this movie I was able to forget that, suspend my disbelief and just go on the journey with them!

  Anyway if you're looking for a Crouching Tiger that's not what it is.  It's not as...Hollywoody...so you're not going to get all the flashy special effects.  (Which to my mind isn't too bad as the flying through the trees bit in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was a little too much for me).

2174948,4,B000683VH0,"WARRIORS OF HEAVEN AND EARTH sets out to be exactly what it is - a simple story about vengeance and action with enough narrative to justify some mighty fighting scenes.  The one aspect that keeps this particular entry in the choreographed flashy swordsmanship category is the rather weak acting of most of the players. Whether it is the scripted development of the storyline or the editing or the fact that director Ping He is trying to make both an intimate and a grandiose historical epic, the flow is just so disjointed that the viewer eventually gives up on trying to figure out who is who and settles back for the visuals.

And the visuals are lovely - the Gobi Desert has rarely been captured on film with such grace, the fighting scenes are brutal without unnecessary focus on bloodletting, and the musical scoring by one A.R. Rahman is more than additive.

Recommended for escapist evenings and for the beauty of the photography.  And that is enough.  Grady Harp, January 2005",1106870400,35,984,4.764705882352941
2174949,4,B000683VH0,"the long and tiresome fighting scenes were better and looked more real than what we saw in troy. neither films would make you barely moved or touched with teary eyes.

there are four major drawbacks:

the dialogue was not good enough; the female actress was a terrible choice. she simply could not act, just like we saw in all of her apprearances of other chinese films and dramas. this is a totally non-talent actress who could never learn how to perform but just waltzed to the end of every one but fatally got herself into the acting buisness; the japanese guy was also a bad casting choice, kinda out of place. the costumes looked too funny and too modern, especially that cap wore by the main character, looked pretty prussian, japanese, even russian style, but for tang dynasty? give me a break.",1106524800,4,801,4.633802816901408
2174950,5,B000683VH0,"I'm a huge fan of Chines/Japanese films and in the last 10 years, or so, the Chinese have gotten very slick in their film making techniques.  This film is excellant on every level and is well worth the money.  The only (repeat only) criticism I would make is that the editing on the fight sequences is too choppy.  Such editing is used to enhance the chaotic effect of violence and allows actors with no martial experience to seem proficient; which is a good thing most times.  Violence is usually an incoherent emotional jumble of images.  However, I miss the Shaw Brothers old school technique of letting the actors work through extended choreographies and can't help but think even a movie as fine as this one is would have been helped a bit by one such scene.  That said, this is a great film.  Buy it, you won't be disappointed.",1102982400,9,833,4.550335570469799

There is native and english language. The english subtitle doesn't track english dubbed.
The dub is terrible - should have had actors speak english.

It's very good advenure film with a bit of fantasy.",1524441600,,228,4.7

8040013,5,B000683VH0,"Absolutely beautiful and moving. Many of this genre are often gauged with a statement such as ""well, it is no Red Cliff but it is pretty good..."". In this case, though, it easily stands at the same stature as Red Cliff. The story is, however, even more focused on fewer characters and thereby raises the intensity level that much more. The casting is superb - Jiang Wen (Cao Cao in ""The Lost Bladesman"") holds the central role perfectly, and Kiichi Nakai shines equally. Zhao Wei is as utterly stunningly beautiful and strong as in Red Cliff.

The scenery is large and beautiful, the fighting is intense, personal, gritty and realistic - no wire work or eye-rolling combat here. Without spoilers, there is a supernatural element in the movie but it does not affect the realism, and instead only intensifies the struggle. Must see.",1491782400,,830,4.804195804195804

8040018,5,B000683VH0,"This is the best film from China, I've ever watched. I checked it out of the library last year and remembered it vividly a year later Not only is the cinematography spectacular, but the actors and story are superb. The underlying history of early China and the vast population living in the country are displayed in vivid and sometimes comical ways.
He Ping, the director of the cult classic SWORDSMAN IN DOUBLE FLAG TOWN and the better-known RED FIRECRACKER, GREEN FIRECRACKER, enters the big time with WARRIORS OF HEAVEN AND EARTH, an epic battle between two heroic figures fighting for themselves and for their countries. When Li (Jiang Wen) refuses to kill innocent women and children, he becomes a rogue soldier without a land. Master swordsman Lai Xi (Nakai Kiichi) is ordered to assassinate him if wants to get back to to his home in Japan and see his mother before she dies. First they join together to help a caravan carrying precious cargo make its way safely across the desert--with a beautiful woman, Wen Zhu (SHAOLIN SOCCER's Zhao Wei), caught in between them. The gorgeous cinematography is by Zhao Fei, who shot such Asian epics as RAISE THE RED LANTERN as well as such Woody Allen films as SWEET AND LOWDOWN and SMALL TIME CROOKS. The lush look of the film is echoed by A.R. Rahman's marvelous score and outstanding costuming and set design. Ping masterfully recreates seventh-century China as horses and camels lead the protagonists down the famous Silk Road during the time of the Tang Dynasty.",1475712000,,1512,4.841698841698841
