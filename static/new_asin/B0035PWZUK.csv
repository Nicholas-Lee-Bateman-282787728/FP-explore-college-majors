4071392,4,B0035PWZUK,"Psychic kids is Chip Coffey (from Paranormal State) helping kids deal with their psychic abilities, learn how to control them, and overall get them to accept their gifts without being afraid. Chip goes to a total of 3 kids homes per episode. He also keeps the kids in the same age group that he's working with. He goes to one family's home and listens to what the child is experiencing. He then travels to a 2nd and 3rd childs home to do the same. Then he brings all the kids together in one specific place so they can see they're not alone. They all share their stories and then go ""ghosthunting."" I put that in quotes not because what they go through isn't real, but because the kids are genuinely terrified of what they're finding, hearing, feeling, and dealing with in their process of learning to control and accept their gifts.

  It's a really good show and great for kids, or parents of kids who have a gifted child in this area. It's good for them to learn that they're not alone, not a freak, and don't need to be afraid. I would highly recommend this dvd based not really on any scare factor (even though there's some teens dealing with a demonic presence in one home, and some overall creepiness in others), but because it's done with compassion, caring, and really helping these kids deal with what they're going through. Chip also has no problem telling the parents of these kids to back off when they start to baby their children when the kids get too scared.

  As far as the Haunted Houses dvd.. it was really boring. If you're looking for something along the lines of 'A haunting' with ppl re-enacting their experiences or anything along those lines.. this isn't it. It's more of a history lesson. It just goes through pretty famous places known to be haunted being given a tour and stories about what ppl have said. If you're interested in just learning just to get the history of already known haunted places, then this is for you. If you're looking for the history plus some scares of actors re-enacting that history or having anyone go through the house to catch paranormal activity.. this isn't it.
  But the 2 dvd's together were a good price and quite worth it as a whole. I would definitely recommend this, if just for the psychic kids alone, while getting the haunted houses as a bonus disc.",1294012800,2,2318,4.541966426858513
4071412,5,B0035PWZUK,"Great series. Too bad it ended after 3 seasons. These kids are some of the most intelligent, good souls you could ever meet.",1442448000,,124,4.434782608695652
4071413,2,B0035PWZUK,"It seemed like a good show, watched two episodes.  Was going to watch another episode of two ten Amazon yanked the show from Prime Instant.  This mildly pisses me off because Netflix doesn't do games like that.  At least Netflix gives a few week/couple month notice before shows disappear from their service.  Not going to pay $2 or $3 to watch an episode, no thanks.

Disappointed in Prime Instant to say the least because of this move.",1424390400,2,437,4.623376623376624
4071414,4,B0035PWZUK,"The things kids say! I like this concept because it's somewhat of an untapped market in the paranormal world. I have this weird line in spooky between things that I can take and things that freak me the eff out and kids that see stuff really rides that thanks to Amityville Horror. This first episode handled this topic very well and did not take the angle of making the situations or the children creepy or sketchy. I really like that they brought three different kids together to talk about what they were experiencing--although I do wonder at the same time if that doesn't allow for some embellishment even if the situation may already be in the deeply disturbing for the child in question. I do wish that they had brought in a child psychologist as well to get the naysayer POV to play all angles.

I did like this show... I hope I can get my husband to watch a few episodes with me. I think if you like paranormal shows and the ghost hunter bent this is right up your alley!",1421625600,,979,4.3791208791208796

4071444,5,B0035PWZUK,"By the time I was 18, I could list over two dozen paranormal experiences that I have had not including the experiences my friends had visiting my house. I could feel energy and see the auras of my teachers as they lectured at the blackboard. My house, even my town, was filled with paranormal phenomena and the dark side of it terrified me.  I would have loved to have Chip in my corner. There's probably no way to say this without being misunderstood as a religious nut but it was truly my faith in Jesus that got me to stand up and stop being afraid of the darker side of these experiences.

I've had many, many sweet experiences as well, such as my brother and I smelling a very strong, yet pleasant perfume in my bedroom after our mom had passed. If I had something to say to these kids I would tell them that most of what they see is ""friendly."" Think of when you go out and see people on the street. Most people are polite, pleasant and quick with a smile. It's rare to see someone who is mean and wishes you harm. If you do come across these spirits, remember your faith. The dark is dispelled by The Light.",1414368000,10,1114,4.225352112676056
4071445,3,B0035PWZUK,A good show to pass the time. Kinda cool watching the guy help the kids try to hone in on their gifts & make them feel more normal together. Wish it would have shown more of the kids using their gifts at the different locations.,1414108800,,228,4.088888888888889

4071449,1,B0035PWZUK,"This is a show for people who have no idea about child psychology and the amazing powers of a child's mind to believe anything. Especially when you get crazy people re-enforcing their fantasies and putting them on TV. There's an old saying, ""If an adult has the mind of a child, that adult would be considered insane."" Children are highly imaginative and horribly narcissistic. This show and everyone in it are playing a dangerous game with the lives of these children who clearly have other issues that have nothing to do with the paranormal.",1411948800,,543,4.787234042553192

I can't imagine it happening that often, and am grateful my experiences were few and far between. This is a great series, and I highly recommended it for empaths and ultra sensitive individuals who have extra perception. It's isolating when people have to hide this phenomina from the rest of the world. Bravo for helping these lost, confused, and terrified children. As an adult with several unexplained experiences, I understand.",1408924800,3,564,5.075268817204301

4071467,5,B0035PWZUK,"I like this show because it spotlights some special and unusual kids, with respect.  No Heaven is for Real type of exploitation.  No religion shoved down our throats.  Just a simple recognition of the paranormal in the lives of children.

Psychic Kids presents the facts of of each kid's life, perceived abilities, and investigates both by bringing a few kids together, in a place of known paranormal significance.  While the show is less skeptical than many would like, I think it does a good job of proving that human beings are more than flesh sacks.  We are connected to a greater reality than the one we perceive with our eyes alone.

It also reminds you not to push aside the words of children.  Listen to them.  Treat their experiences with respect and kindness, whether they are real or not.

Also, the professionals involved seem to be good individuals.  Chip Coffey is a very likable guy, whether you believe in him or not.  I think he guides the children well, dispelling fear.  Which--whether or not they are experiencing spirits--is a great lesson to learn in all walks of life.  Take it head-on.  Conquer and use fear.

Good show.  If a mere portion of what's presented in Psychic Kids is true, it should change your paradigm.  Some of these kids are experiencing REAL phenomena.  Pretty creepy.  Always turns out heartwarming and positive, though.

Worth watching.",1407888000,5,1379,4.832618025751073

You see real bonding with kids who now have hope and it shows in their faces and the fact that they stay in touch afterwards is a testimony to their growth and understanding, through Chip Coffee's tutaledge, of their gifts. Chip Coffee has done a fantastic job bringing this to film without compromising the kids. It's warming and inspiring. To all of us who've heard and seen and experienced like things, especially when we were younger,
you know we could have used this Soldier of Light then. You do good and honest and honorable work. God bless you Chip.",1402617600,5,718,4.6171875

One think I don't like is occasionally the host gets annoying, his personality is a little quirky... there are also a few episodes with 'christian' parents who are annoying because they are scared of spirits or have been told they don't exist :/ That crap sort of goes out the window when you actually do you research and figure out the bible actually says ghosts do exist.",1399939200,,520,4.484210526315789

4071535,5,B0035PWZUK,I just loved this series from Chip Coffey.  Hearing it from children put's a whole new light on the subject of psychic phenomena.  Children have no agenda to be psychic.  It's got to be a hard life to be able to see things other children don't see and when they do see people they aren't sure if they are living or not.  It's frightens them and interferes with everyday living.  Chip is also a psychic and he always brings a child psychologist with him to help evaluate the children and be sure no one is exploiting them or that they are mentally stable and healthy.  The story about the little girl and her friend Freddie is amazing.  I hope you get the chance to see these episodes they're really special.  I do not recommend these shows to small children who may be too impressionable.,1397952000,,788,4.423611111111111

The kids get to interact with others who understand and validate their experiences in life.  Altogether a positive and enlightening show!!",1484697600,2,483,5.315789473684211

8389224,5,B0035PWZUK,"An excellent portrayal of the struggle, fear, doubt, and confusion that many of these gifted children and their families face, and what a life-changing difference it makes when they are brought together with others like them for the first time, under the loving, accepting, experienced guidance of Chip Coffey and Edy Nathan.
Watching this series brought back many memories, as well as ""ah HAH"" moments.
It's heart-breaking to see how much their lives have been hidden because of bullying and fear, yet miraculous to witness the kids re-bloom to the point of wanting to use their gifts to help others, despite it all.
Bless the beasts, and the children!",1464307200,2,653,5.0
