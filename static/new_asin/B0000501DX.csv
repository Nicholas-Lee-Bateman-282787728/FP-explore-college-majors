7928575,3,B0000501DX,"What a fitting title: ""Searching Soul"" I met this man as a young child, my dad was an acquaintence of his. I shared my fathers absolute love and appreciation for his music, and followed his career my whole life. Yet there always seemed to be something off kilter about his journey. Watching this documentary, it shows here too. This is priceless ""day in the life"" footage and contains some clips of a few performances in europe during his tours there.

I can tell you this; with the passing of Marvin, and Miles Davis (and others) the music universe certainly felt the shock of loss. I miss hearing new music by Marvin Gaye....

I don't know if I would say this is Marvin in his prime, its a great snapshot of his life. A good view into his pshyce but it isn't a ""concert DVD"" by any means. I liked it, but I know its not for everyone.",1195689600,4,835,4.312101910828026
7928576,1,B0000501DX,"A customer write in this review that he is desapointed by such a poor quality ! Of course this is a fake... an illegal copy of MY DOCUMENTARY made in Ostende on 1981. The original title is ""Marvin GAYE transit Ostende"". A version as been release last year "" REMEMBER MARVIN GAYE "" (duration 56'). If you want to watch the original film shooting on 16mm EMAIL me : r.olivier@skynet.be.",1069891200,9,384,4.5
7928577,5,B0000501DX,"Although this DVD is all but 30 minutes long....It gives you a heartfelt look behind the man and his music.  MARVIN GAYE...SOUL MAN extraordinaire!
We follow Marvin as he journeys overseas; reflecting on his ""geniune"" love for people, music and yes....even women!  This introspective journey is made sweeter when we get to see him in a impromtu jam session, singing acapella at an historic church as well as engaging in conversation and play with folks in their native Belgium.
Watching this DVD, there's no doubt that Marvin Gaye was an open-hearted loving man. Any true M.G. fan should definitely have this in their collection.  It will give you such a joyfull feeling that you'll be playing this DVD over and over again!",1048896000,3,723,4.909836065573771
