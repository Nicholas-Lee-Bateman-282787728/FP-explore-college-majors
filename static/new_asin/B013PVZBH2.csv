7370530,5,B013PVZBH2,"This movie is a lot of fun if you get absurdity and camp.  It was certainly refreshing compared to most dumbed-down mainstream comedy aimed at young teenagers.  Lots of good laughs.  Oh, and be sure or watch the end credits.  There is a funny surprise that ties things together .",1449532800,3,279,4.52

7370532,3,B013PVZBH2,"Really enjoyable until the third act when the story loses steam and drags to an unsatisfying conclusion. Still worth a rent for the first 2/3.
Direction could have been better though... especially in the teachers' lounge scenes where all the teachers mimicked each others cadence and tone: felt very ""community theater."" Decent job though, Pat.
(I don't know Pat Mills, I'm just being flip due to boredom and too much Chinese food.)

P.S. Eleanor Zichy is a star.",1448928000,,463,4.935897435897436
7370533,5,B013PVZBH2,"I laughed right from the opening scene; up until the office where he gives students pot and alcohol.  I almost stopped watching at that point, but returned to finish it.  Glad I did.  Pat says a lot in this film, using absurdity as the vehicle.  I'd like to know how much was autobiographical; my guess is a lot.  Was just in one of those moods where it really hit my funny bone.  Plus, I have always appreciated the absurdity of life, so I'd really like to meet a ""crazy"" creative guy like this and have a great laugh sometime.  Unfortunately, daily life is full of the adults as portrayed by the stereotypes at the school.",1448582400,4,624,4.373913043478261
7370534,2,B013PVZBH2,"So what was that about? It wasn't a comedy because it wasn't funny. It wasn't a drama because the script was too lame. It wasn't a tragedy because the ending was a copout. I know! It was about 81 minutes...and that is 81 minutes of my life I'll never get back!

This ""quirky"" comedy was submitted to the 2015 Seattle International Film Festival by Canada. I would fear for any poor teenager who is subjected to this jerk's ""guidance."" But then again, I'm just an old poop! I am not amused by an adult in a position of authority who offers drugs and alcohol to teenagers.

Written and directed by Pat Mills (""Secondary High"") we see what happens when a prospective employer doesn't check a rsum. A former child star, lost to bad decisions and overuse of controlled substances, is probably not a very good prospect.

The cast:
  * Pat Mills (""You Can't Do That on Television"") is David Gold, the impossibly loose cannon who lies, cheats and steals. He copies a rsum off the Internet and gets a job as a high school guidance counselor.
  * Zahra Bentham (""Degrassi: The Next Generation"") Lisa is one of the students who receives ""guidance"" from our hero. She clearly is more savvy than he, and hers is the only story worth following.
  * Kevin Hanchard (""Orphan Black"") Principal Newman has no one to blame but himself.

David's litany of affirmations turned out to be amusing because we hear them against a backdrop of completely contradictory behavior on his part. In addition, I smiled at the crime spree: robbing tanning parlors in a bright yellow Prius, with a runaway teenage girl. That's hard core!

This ""hero"" is pathetic: he is chronically drunk, routinely high and terminally stupid. I do NOT recommend this movie.",1442188800,2,1722,4.706666666666667
8728492,5,B013PVZBH2,"I loved this movie. This character is my Spirit animal. I laughed from start to finish. The credits started, an Easter egg appears & I laughed some more.hint, wait after the credits start.

This film was well written, well acted, perfectly cast - it was perfection.

This character would've been a hit on SNL.

FYI - there is not 1 time, when anything, besides drinking, smoking and smoking pot, that anything inappropriate happened.",1512086400,,433,4.904109589041096

This is just my kind of dark and dopey humor.  Silly and campy as all hell... but it's got heart.  It follows the life of David Gold, former child star and current closet case alcoholic with a major case of arrested development.

David hates himself.  Most of all, he hates his genitals and refuses to face up to the fact that he might be gay.  He rejects any form of sexuality.  He's got two-toned hair, less than manly mannerisms, and the moody and highly emotional disposition of a dysfunctional teenaged girl.  Yet he can't see what everyone else can see about himself.  His family has rejected him and he's alone in his cray cray universe.  So he self-medicates in alcohol and brainwashes his thoughts with kooky positive affirmations of denial.

When David loses his job and faces bad news about his health... he really loses it.  And where do pathologically immature former child stars go when they hit rock bottom and have to face their real selves?  High school!!!...yep, lol.  David impersonates a high school guidance counselor and finds himself among peeps he can actually connect with... albeit in inappropriate and illegal ways. Soon enough it's Judgment Day for David and he's on the run with another misfit (not surprisingly, a teenaged girl lol)... somewhere along the way he's bound to face his true self.

I just love these nervous break down sorts of stories where one's life is turned upside down... too fun.  Must have a silly sense of humor to truly enjoy this one, lol... but even under all the absurdity, I think there is a true blue message here about how denying your real identity is beyond crazy-making.
