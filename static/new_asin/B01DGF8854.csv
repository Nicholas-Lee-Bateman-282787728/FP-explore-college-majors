8755877,1,B01DGF8854,"Covers have no Toei logo anywhere on them, and indicates that it's a product of Malaysia - which should be a red flag to long-time Dragonball fans in and of itself. Back cover has art from the Majin Buu saga, and from what appears to be Dragonball Xenoverse, and the summary written on it seems to have been copy-pasted from a wiki... without even editing the citation ""[9]"" out of it. Back cover also indicates a 4:3 aspect ratio, but the show was made in 16:9.

If this isn't a bootleg, it sure as hell looks like one.",1469404800,30,520,4.3061224489795915
