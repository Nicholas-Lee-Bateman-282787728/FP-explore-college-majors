8569774,5,B00BJPH0KI,The best kids DVD I've ever purchased.  My kids aged from 2-6 love it.  I never feel guilty letting them watch it because it's an exercise program that builds their self esteem.  All TV shows for young kids should be like this.  Even my oldest who has trouble focusing on things longer than ten minutes (he has slight autism) watches the whole thing in its entirety.,1438732800,,366,4.5

I already had Tony Horton's - Tony and the Kid's, and Shaunt T's Fit Kids but wanted to give this as a try for my kids and to add some variety. It is an awesome little 36 minute video. My kids love it. I currently have three children - ages 8, 6, and 3 and they all love this workout. Last week my oldest daughter had a friend over after school and asked if they could do go ""Mighty Me"" and she friend loved it also. All three of my children have asked since we first did this at different times for us to do it again. The video was originally created and aired through Discovery Education and was one of their top videos for 5 year. It is now available direct and for a very reasonable rate.

Brian and Mighty Me take us through a romping workout that will engage, the mind, the body and instill confidence and values. The children will do a wide range of stretches, and activities. They will shout at the TV, laugh and overall have a great time. I even wore my heart rate monitor and burned 100 calories doing it with the kids. Watching Brian was like a cross between the Great American Hero and Tony Horton. It is engaging for the children and fun for adults. This video has been kids tested and kid approved. And I hope that Brian will release more down the road!

So what have you got to lose give it a try and become the best you, you can be, become a Mighty Me!",1409270400,,1446,4.124113475177305
