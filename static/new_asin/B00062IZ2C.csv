2160586,3,B00062IZ2C,"Starhunter was a show I discovered by accident because it was being shown at 4am Sunday mornings.  I enjoyed it quite a bit and set the VCR to tape it for me.  I didn't really get into the 2nd season, but after only a few episodes, I was unable to see it at all because it vanished from the air.

I was happy to come accross the series, and for the price, how could I go wrong?  It was a 2-DVD set, 15 episodes in total, 7 on one and 8 on the other.

Yes, like the other reviewers have mentioned, the DVD was very quickly done and lots of compression used.  That's why it has 7-8 episodes per disk while my fabulous Wonder Woman DVD Series one only has 3 per disk.

That said, at least I have the episodes to view at all, and the quality isn't too bad.  Just annoying pixilation around titles and quickly moving objects.  The credits at the end will drive you batty as there is extreme pixilation as they fade up from black.

Looking at the Starhunter website, it shows that there are 22 episodes.  Given that the 2-DVD set only comes with 15, it seems that we're out of luck for the missing episodes.

It is a pain that they didn't bother arranging the episodes in order, and that you have to hop from Disk 1 to Disk 2 and back to see them in order, but for the price, I'm not complaining too much.

The disks contain episodes 101 - 113, and 116 - 117.  Maybe if we all pester them we can get a 3rd disk with the remaining episodes on them.

I did notice a glitch at the beginning of Episode 2, and it always happens in the same place on my Sony SLV-D300P, but there was no glitch when played on my XP computer. It's only a 1-second pause and so isn't a big deal.  You may find similar happenings depending on what DVD player you're using.

As for the show itself, I find it enjoyable.  The thread of the father seeking for his son is interesting.  Some people call this show really low budget, but it's not like old episides of Dr. Who (which I love anyway).

This seems to be one of the many series that I'd randomly run into in the wee hours of Sunday morning and would watch regularly until they vanished again, like the series which was based on Blade Runner.

Definitely worth checking out, especially given the price.

I give the show a 4 but the production of the DVD a 2, hence the average of 3 which I gave it above.

106: The Divinity Cluster
112: Frozen
101: The Man Who Sold the World

2160587,4,B00062IZ2C,"I received the Starhunter Vol. 1 DVD and I enjoyed it, not

experiencing any video problems that others have mention.

Those problems are probably in their DVD players rather than

in the disks themselves. But I, too, was annoyed that the

shows were placed haphazzardly rather than in the order each

showed was aired in. I was also annoyed that one show, Family

Values, was missing from this disk as it was only the third

show aired and it should have been here.

But aside from that, I am pleased to have Starhunter on DVD

free and uncut since the local station that carried it on TV

had cut out so much just to allow for more commercials. The

DVD is great!",1130198400,12,665,4.368852459016393
2160588,5,B00062IZ2C,"I loved the series and waited ever since it went off the air to buy the DVDs. They squeezed 7 episodes onto the DVD by using what looks like very high compression. When there is fast motion or a change of scenes there is a chance of it being blocky. The box doesn't have any inserts, the DVD label looks printed on with a poor ink jet. There are no director cuts, gag reels, interviews with the cast. This looks like it was put together to get something out for the fans just to keep them quit. That said, since this is the only thing out there, I guess this is as good as it gets. If you really liked the series you would like having this in your collection. Also, for the price you can't pass it up, all though for the quality I wouldn't pay more.

2160590,5,B00062IZ2C,"I discovered Starhunter season one recently on DVD and was very intrigued by it. The show was entertaining although it's too bad the episodes are mixed up on the DVDs! Also only a few episodes of season one are available on DVD. Why not put them all out and in the right order? The series itself really hooked me. It has it's own special magic. I liked the cast and characters. There are a lot great ideas and fun to be had.

Season one prompted me to try Starhunter 2300. Nice package! All the episodes are included and in order. Wonderful image and sound. Fun episodes! Great show! Can we get a sequel? Maybe a direct to DVD ""Serenity""? A follow-up that unites father and son while introducing new fans to the previous two series? How about re-releasing season one in the same type of quality DVD package as season two?",1127347200,9,821,4.437086092715232

2160592,3,B00062IZ2C,"I bought this DVD because I like Michael Pare.  He'll never win any awards for acting, but I like him anyway.  This was obviously a very low budget show, at least by science fiction standards.  Sometimes the sets are so simple it's quite funny.  The low budget carried over to the production of the DVDs, apparently.  There are 8 episodes squeezed onto a single DVD, and the compression really shows.  The scene will periodically ""shimmer"" with heavy pixelation.  (There's a reason why virtually all TV series available on DVD put no more than 4 ""hour"" shows on each disc.)  If you've seen Michael Pare before and like him, and are prepared for the marginal quality of the DVD, the episodes are entertaining.  Just don't expect a really slick production like Firefly.",1121558400,18,767,4.793893129770993
2160593,4,B00062IZ2C,"This Canadian-made space opera was broadcast but largely overlooked in the US.  It features several interesting comparisons to Joss Whedon's ""Firefly"" - which it predates - and has one genuinely endearing character, Percy, played by Tanya Allen.

In this volume, bounty hunter Dante Montana's quest to find his lost son Travis nears its climax, while the nefarious Orchard makes lots of trouble for our crew in its own quest for the mysterious Divinity Cluster.

For further details on Starhunter, please see my review of volume 1.",1101859200,16,531,5.151162790697675
2160594,4,B00062IZ2C,"This Canadian-made series was broadcast over two seasons in the US (including the much-revised, newly-cast second season) but was very difficult to find due to the usual poor scheduling (in my area, at 11PM Sunday to begin, then at 1PM Saturday, with no repeats and frequent pre-empting).

Those who do encounter it should keep an open mind, since the skimpy budget is evident in the many shadows used to suggest a ""big spaceship"" and in a regular cast of only three actors (plus the ""AI"", another actor who was never on set).  And, star Michael Pare is likely to never, ever win a Best Actor award.

But the program has plenty of entertainment value if you go with it, and features several explicit points of comparison to Joss Whedon's ""Firefly"" - which, most interestingly, made its debut TWO YEARS AFTER Starhunter appeared in Canada.

Both series involve ships cruising the fringes of the galaxy, both ships have crews involved with bounty hunting, and both have as Chief Engineer a very young woman whose shipbound life has left her notably short of ""people skills.""  But Starhunter's Percy Montana, played by Tanya Allen, with her cynical attitude, bored demeanor and knack for getting herself and the whole ship into deep trouble, is a much more interesting character than Firefly's whiny Kaylee, and is really who makes Starhunter worth watching.

SciFi fans should give Starhunter, and especially Tanya Allen, a look.  They might find something neat there.",1101859200,22,1466,4.983606557377049
2160664,3,B00062IZ2C,"This review is for the Alliance Atlantis/Platinum version.

Yes, I'm giving more stars to this single disc than for the series as a whole.  The main reason?  Less episodes!  The series just isn't that great.  Each of these unedited episodes begins with a pointless monologue by the loathsome, cynical Rudolpho, who funds the journeys of the Tulip, so named because these are the letters of its full name which haven't worn off yet.  The crew consists of Dante Montana, bounty hunter, who's just doing this for cash while trying to find his son; Lucretia (Luc), their ""security expert""; and Dante's teenage niece Percy, the ship's engineer (before Kaylee made girl engineers cool.)  Add in a holographic AI Caravaggio for...additonal comic relief, I guess.

World building, plots, dialogue are all sub-par.  The one redeeming feature of the series is Percy.  If you like the show at all, it will probably be because of her.  The idea of an immature female character may not appeal to everyone, but she's very entertaining to watch.  Certainly, in comparison to the rest of the cast.

The disc contains the following episodes:
8. Past Lives
3. Family Values
1. Peer Pressure
12. Good Bye, So Long
13. The Most Wanted Man
14. Half Dense Players
15. Dark and Stormy Night

Why these episodes in this order? I'm guessing here, but I figure they put Episode 8 first because it's one of the better ones. Episode 3 is much weaker, with unfunny comic relief villains.  The villain from the pilot is not a very good actress.  Since there isn't musch of an arc, those three could be shown in any order.  With Episode 12, the long-running plot arc regarding ""The Divinity Cluster"" becomes more prominent.  Episode 15 is mostly a story-so-far clip show, and not very well done.

There are no extras on the disc.  Ratings-wise, there are a few minor swear words and some almost-kinda-sorta nudity for brief moments in two of the episodes, so, call it PG-13.

Do I recommend it?  If you're bored and you can get it cheap.",1346630400,,2006,4.753623188405797
2160665,4,B00062IZ2C,"It is some 250+ years in the future, and the solar system has been colonized.  Apparently, space travel has been confined to the solar system, but given the size of our little corner of the Orion Spiral Arm, that is still impressive.  Mars has been Terraformed (sort of) and there are outposts on various moons & asteriods, as well as space stations sprinkled throughout nearby space.

The future is something of a dystopia where corporations have usurped the power of governments.  As such, business conglomerates call the shots on what is considered legal / illegal.

Michael Pare portrays a man (Dante) whose wife has been killed & son kidnapped by these pirates known as ""the raiders.""  He becomes a bounty hunter (a sort of<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dog-The-Bounty-Hunter-To-Seize-and-Protect/dp/B001PTA34I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dog The Bounty Hunter: To Seize and Protect</a>) in outer space.  On the side, he tries to pick up leads on what happened to his son.

Dante's ship / prison transport seems to be held together by chewing gum & duct tape.  He has a crew of 2 females including his security officer (Claudette Roche) and niece, Percy (Tanya Allen).  Together they roam around the solar system picking up bad guys (and sometimes not-so-bad-guys) who are wanted by the conglomerates.

The star of the show is Tanya Allen.  She brings a lot of energy as the feisty redhead, rebellious teenager, genius engineer who keeps Dante's ship flying.  Allen has a tremendous screen-presence & this show would be quite dull without her inclusion.  Since first watching STARHUNTER I've begun to search for other projects that she's been involved in.

This is an entertaining show.  As is the case w/most British / Canadian sci-fi flicks, the FX are pretty pedestrian.  That's OK, however, as it is good to see a different view of the future from the utopian vision that's offered by STAR TREK.  If you're a fan of the Science Fiction genre, then you're bound to find this series to be intriguing.",1260662400,,2045,5.201834862385321

2160668,4,B00062IZ2C,"This is a pretty good Sci-Fi series that gets better and better.  I was a bit unsure at first, but I was really involved by the end and hated to see it end.  The characters developed very well and the story line was pretty good.

Definitely a low budget affair and some of the writing a bit amateurish, but the cast and crew really seemed to give it a go and won me over.  The whole here is greater than the sum of its parts.

If you like Sci-fi along the lines of Firefly, you should enjoy this.  In fact, I found many things here that seemed to have been payed homage in the Firefly series itself.  I won't spoil your fun, but they're pretty clear.  Firefly had much better scripts, but this series has heart.  Money well spent and good enough that I will enjoy watching many times over.

2012-03-10 I still find myself intrigued by this series and coming back to it from time to time. There's a touch of ""magic"" in this production, clearly a lot of the people involved put their heart into what they were doing.",1198800000,2,1014,4.261780104712042
2160669,2,B00062IZ2C,I ordered this thinking that it would be a 'cleaned up' version of the original. What it is -- 2/3 of the original collection in 2 vols. Not my favorite way of getting a series. Same quality of copy... so those flaws that other have written about are still present in this set. If you want the whole series look for the 4-disc set and you will be much better pleased.,1191628800,,367,4.183098591549296

hope to see you soon when I get to ganymede,

also, some more comments on the disc. The package is great, the cover and the disc printing is great, thses idiot americans expect everything to be super shiny and high resolution... idiots...  but , however, when you play back the episodes off of the disc, there is a bright line running at the bottom of your screen, that stays there throughout the entire show , and that is not good. In fact, that line is very distracting when you watch these episodes, they may fix that but probably they won't because they printed thousands of these discs which cost a lot, and that would be a major fix, for upcoiming discs, but probably if they do run more then they will address it for the next production run. However, all in all, excellent product...... five stars.

I get to see percy again !!!!!!!!

Volume 2 provides seven more great episodes of the Starhunter but the problem here is that the show's first season had twenty-two episodes so if you do the math you know that you are going to come up  seven episodes short between Volumes 1 and 2. Yet there is no Volume 3 to wrap everything up in this season; rather, instead, there's a Season 2 DVD that's out where it's fifteen years later and Percy comes across a much older Travis. And in this season, Michael Pare is no longer in the show  and much has chaged, though not necessarily for the better.

I can enjoy these shows on their own, but it just ticks me off that the company who produces these DVDs leaves the fans of the show dangling. Maybe if everyone writes letters the production company will release the final seven episodes. One can hope...",1146355200,20,1071,4.4213197969543145

If you're looking for more of the same sort of vibe this is a great one to pick up, and the price is definitely right.

Ok, so the show is predictable and some of the dialog cardboard, but by and large there are some interesting ideas explored in this show which is Canada's answer to Blake's 7.

As for the DVD, well, you get what you pay for. The audio and video are pretty sub-par. It's unfortunate because some of the effects are done rather well and would make for enticing eye-candy.

At any rate, if you're a sci-fi/space opera fan (like I am), you can pick this up for a song and decide whether it's worth the investment to check out the second season, which I hear has much better production values, both in the show and the DVD set.",1139184000,9,1081,4.237864077669903
