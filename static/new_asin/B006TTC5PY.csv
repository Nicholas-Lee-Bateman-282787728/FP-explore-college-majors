5016998,5,B006TTC5PY,"If you are feeling bad about work, Bruce Almighty will make you feel better.  Especially, when he has the power to seek revenge on former co-workers.  Liked Bruce more than Evan.  More laughs with Bruce.",1353369600,,203,4.742857142857143
5016999,1,B006TTC5PY,"According to Amazon, this set does not come out until March 13, 2012. I find that very strange since I picked this up at Walmart a few weeks back. And when I saw it I freaked out!

I thought this was the best thing ever! For the longest time I had wanted both films in one set. My old DVD of Bruce Almighty is very scratched up and as a completist I needed Evan Almighty to finish the set. It may not have Jim Carrey in it, but Tom Shadyac came back to direct and Steve Carell and Morgan Freeman reprised their roles from the first Almighty movie.

Right off the bat had some serious issues. On the inside there are no inserts, just a single DVD, one-sided readable disc. Both films share this one side topped with very bland artwork. A solid red cover with the text ""Bruce Almighty"" on the top and ""Evan Almighty"" on the bottom. Typical design of Universal.

Being a one disc set you might wonder how all the extras from each Almighty DVD would fit in this set. Well, that's just it. There are no special features. I was really hoping all the old extras would be recycled, but double features usually eat up all the space anyway on a DVD. But the thing that's most peculiar about what's on the disc is the menu itself.

I can't express my hatred enough for how empty, generic, and horrible the main menu is. The Almighty Comedy Collection's is nothing more than that cloudy background off the DVD cover with two selectable posters that take up about 80% of the screen. That's it! No language or setup option. Just make your selection between the two and instantly watch the movie.

To be fair, this is a very inexpensive DVD and perfect for fans of the either movie if you're not all about the extras. It's convenient and a space saver. Still, it's quite odd that I found this among many other copies at Walmart two months before its announced release date.

When I bought it I couldn't find any trace of the item anywhere online. Not even on Walmart's website. This isn't the first product that's been shelved without a trace. In fact, many double feature sets have been distributed in Walmart stores having no online records such as the Man with No Name Double Feature (A Fistful of Dollars / For a Few Dollars More) and The Magnificent Seven Double Feature (The Magnificent Seven / Return of the Seven).

If you're not all about the extras and just want to own these two movies then I recommend picking it up. It's a nice space saver on the shelf and includes two movies for the price of one. Despite my rating, it's still worth buying if you love these movies.",1331078400,13,2565,4.39873417721519
