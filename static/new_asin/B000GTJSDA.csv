2618274,4,B000GTJSDA,"Actually 4.5 stars. It captured the desperation and anxiety of what can happen when a bad decision is made. If you've never experienced this kind of desperation then the movie may not have the intended impact. The actors did a great job portraying the emotions that come with these situations. If you've been there, you'll know what I'm talking about, and believe me it sucks.",1416700800,,376,4.8

8134543,2,B000GTJSDA,"Watched 10"" and could not take it any more. Somebody tell me how you can get a somewhat A-list player like Chaz, plus what seems like promising dialog and decent actors and then hand it to a ""cinematographer"" who can't pull focus to save his friggin life. It's like wise guys financed the film and insisted that someone's retarded 18 year old son shoot the damn thing. Whaaa?",1480636800,,375,4.529411764705882
