8324799,2,B0001KZNKQ,"My Australian in-laws wanted to give a bit of their culture to their granddaughter for her 4th birthday. They knew if they bought it at a store it would be the wrong region. So they went to Amazon (a U.S. company) and looked for a Bananas in Pajamas dvd. No where does it say that it's in PAL format. So they bought it through this supplier for Amazon. Day after her birthday we try the dvd- it won't play on our dvd player because it's in PAL format! No where on the box does it say it is- otherwise I'd have never opened it. The only way we could get it to play at all was through our computer. Good to know before you buy it.  Otherwise the content is entertaining, if you can play it.",1149120000,4,688,4.0588235294117645
