7993637,5,B00009W8NK,"Some of the material does not hold up well against time, as this is close to a 15-year-old special by now.  However, his skill at storytelling, his exaggerated sound effects, and crisp delivery are on full display in this special.  It's definitely David Alan Grier at his best, and he shows why he belonged on the original cast of In Living Color, that is if the Loomis Simmons, and Men On... sketches weren't enough.",1472169600,,417,4.621621621621622
7993638,1,B00009W8NK,"In Living Color, Martin, Chocolate News. What do these shows have in common? David Alan Grier brought ""funny as hell"" full speed ahead in each one. With credentials like these, I pre-approved this performance as far as my laughter was concerned...and I was wrong. Now before I begin, let me say that I am a DAG fan...I couldn't picture In Living Color without him. But this stand up, as he would say on Men on Film, ""left me limp."" It was not boring by any means. The subjects were those anyone could relate to (family, dating, running a marathon, etc.). But honestly his stand up lacked the punch we have come to expect from his performances. I think I giggled once. As I continued to watch, I knew It was out of pure loyalty. But even my loyalty will not let me front on this review: The performance tanked. He is not Katt, Chappelle, or Cedric- nor should he try to be- but if only he could make us laugh for his present comic moments so we are not left dwelling on his classic gems he provided in the years past. I will wait for another stand up performance from David Alan Grier and hope he doesn't prove to be what so many others have become when handed a loose microphone: Sitcom-script hilarious.",1371168000,,1204,4.403587443946188
7993639,1,B00009W8NK,"Don't waste your money.  David Allen Grier was so funny when he performed on In Living Color, but I now know it's because he was great at supporting roles.  When left alone, this comedian leaves alot to desire.  The DVD is not good and his stand up routine is just awful.  We saw him last night for New Years Eve in Atlantic City.  Hard to believe he is the same guy.  He had a ""warm up"" comedian come on before him who was hilarious.  Don't spend any money on stand up or DVD's for him.  You will be dissapointed.  No chance here to give no stars.  If I could have, I would have.",1230768000,,580,4.053097345132743
7993640,5,B00009W8NK,"...truly a showcase of ""DAG's"" naturally funny humor and talented delivery regarding individual,collective and cultural attitudes which subtly taps into our own very human and comedic thoughts about the world around us and encourages us to laugh at our ""normally/abnormal"" human common sense and imperfections in a real way.",1140220800,,324,5.63265306122449
7993641,4,B00009W8NK,"Another reviewer tried to contrast Grier with Chris Rock. They're right: Grier ain't Rock. So what? He's as observant and biting as Rock, especially in this DVD. Also, his comedy is more open and universal, at least in the American context, to more people (i.e., Grier doesn't really tell jokes about or make fun of African Americans, choosing to lambaste American culture generally). This is a good show to put on and watch with friends. Kick back and have a laugh.",1120608000,,466,4.765432098765432
7993642,1,B00009W8NK,"I really like David Alan Grier.  Saw him on Broadway and admired him ever since, which is why I picked up the dvd as soon as I saw it. I was thoroughly disappointed.  I have no desire to view this dvd a second time.",1063065600,2,215,3.8636363636363638
7993643,5,B00009W8NK,"We watched the show when it aired on Comedy Central and missed the first 10 minutes.  ... This has got to be one of the funniest stand-up routines I've ever seen.  David Alan Grier's comedy is right up there with classic George Carlin, Bill Cosby and Eddie Murphy stand-up comedy.",1058918400,4,280,4.58
