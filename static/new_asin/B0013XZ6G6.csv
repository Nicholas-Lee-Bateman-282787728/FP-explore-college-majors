3120098,4,B0013XZ6G6,The exact copy of the original VHS tape that I could no longer get. Thank You!,1242864000,14,78,3.9375
3120099,4,B0013XZ6G6,"Beverly Cleary's book The Mouse and the Motorcycle is a modern classsic.  This film does justice to the book, but it does look a bit dated.  Children still frequently take this book out of the library where I work.  I think they will enjoy this live action version of the book.

The bonus feature is Wee Gillis.  This live action movie of the book of the same name really feels old.  The picture is fuzzy, and the style of the narrator feels very stodgy and dull.  We no longer keep a copy of this book on the library shelves because patrons didn't check it out anymore.  I doubt many children will want to watch this bonus.

I was torn between giving this DVD 3 or 4 stars.  It's good enough, but it might be better if somebody filmed a more up-to-date version of The Mouse and the Motorcycle.",1235952000,,794,4.304054054054054
3120100,5,B0013XZ6G6,"Very cute and filled with action. Based on the children's book of the same name by Beverly Clearly, the story is about a mice riding a child's toy motorcycle in a hotel. Parents may want to purchase other DVDs by Cleary or purchase the Cleary books to read to their children.(reading level 8 years & up).",1227398400,5,304,4.446428571428571
3120101,4,B0013XZ6G6,"I saw this movie 20 years ago as a kid with my mom. Never left my memories. At dinner we were talking about cherished times and she brought up this movie.  I'm about to leave home so I bought this DVD so I can watch it with my mom one last time.  She saw the packaging and sorta cried and I guess we'll watch it once I'm done with this review.
I watched a bit of it already.  It's just as I remembered it!  The movie itself is 41 minutes long.  The video quality is decent. It's from 1986 afterall.  There's also an 18 minute extra story call ""Wee Gillis"" about a Scottish boy in the country.  Both stories have a lot of values so I recommend it for parents.  I bought it new and there's a colorful 7-paged booklet inside that's like a checklist for all the DVDs in the ""Scholastic Storybook Treasures"" Series.  :)
I also own the book and the movie is very faithful to it.  One of the more annoying things is that when you start the movie, it defaults to showing subtitles.  They claim it as ""Read-Along"" subtitles, so each word that's said on screen is highlighted in blue.  Kinda like singing Karaoke.  You can turn it off of course.  Another downside is that there are no scene selection or chapter markings. Pressing the 'Next Chapter' button on your DVD's remote would only end the movie.  It's cool though, I could care less. It's worth watching straight through.  Overall, you'll love it! Take care! ;)",1226707200,39,1409,4.361538461538461

3120112,5,B0013XZ6G6,This is a story that appeals to kids and grownups alike. It's a great story to watch or read together on family night. Its a great chapter book that kids can read on their own. The storyline easily keeps their attention. A mouse? On a motorcycle? Too funny! Start with Ralph S. Mouse. Then you'll HAVE to read this one!,1406419200,,319,4.333333333333333
3120113,5,B0013XZ6G6,Just like I remember - my 3yo loves Ralph!,1405209600,,42,3.7777777777777777

I think it was separated into parts, just like they did with The Neverending Story. The only thing I was disappointed with is that my 3 year old didn't like it as much as I did. But, she's only 3.",1391212800,,309,4.15

3120120,4,B0013XZ6G6,"I purchased this to go along with an author study for my 4th grade class. I know Cleary has a newer movie that came out, but I had to go for this classic. I remember watching it as a kid, fascinated by the animation combined with the real life boy. A must see for all Beverly Cleary fans.",1368662400,,288,3.9827586206896552
3120121,5,B0013XZ6G6,"Bought this to entertain our preschool class! Great movie! I knew most of our kids wouldn't have seen it since it's an ""older"" movie and I wondered if the animation might not be up to their standards, but I needn't have worried! They loved it!!",1368576000,,244,4.444444444444445
3120122,4,B0013XZ6G6,I teach and use this in school. These are pretty basic but have closed - captioning for the students that need it.,1364947200,,114,4.2272727272727275

3120124,5,B0013XZ6G6,I bought that movie as a school teacher because it was on the 4th grade reading list.  I liked to show the movie after the reading on as many books as possible to help the students put the details together in order.  The kids loved the movie,1357603200,,241,4.1063829787234045
3120125,3,B0013XZ6G6,"I purchased this to use at school, only to find it was for home use only. This is surprising since it is from Scholastic. It would be helpful it this were stated before purchase.",1353888000,,178,4.264705882352941
3120126,5,B0013XZ6G6,This is such a nice story which may seem dated to many children today but it's simplicity is part of its charm.  I bought it for a friend's son who had been sick with fevers and the boy in the story gets a fever and the mouse uses his toy motorcycle to find him an aspirin.,1352505600,,273,3.875
3120127,5,B0013XZ6G6,I was happy to find this DVD as my old video was getting a little wobbly for my second graders. We use this movie every spring to compare and contrast the book with the movie and it was time to upgrade to the latest tech. Thanks for making this possible.,1341014400,,254,4.1
3120128,5,B0013XZ6G6,Great movie. My kids love it and watch it over and over. It captures their attention. They have never sat still thru any movie.,1339804800,,127,4.333333333333333

3120130,5,B0013XZ6G6,This was my son's favorite story when he was a little boy.  He loved the whole series both the books and the movies.  I had tried to buy this years ago but it was not closed captioned so I passed on it.  When I saw this on Amazon I was happy to see they had it as a read-along.  My son is 26yrs old now but he was very happy to get this video; we watched it together and it brought back great memories.  He said now he'll have it for when he has children some day! It was a good find!,1314576000,,484,3.7058823529411766

3120140,5,B0013XZ6G6,"My adult daughter loved this as a child on television. Now my granddaugter read it at school and was really happy that I was able to find it on DVD so she could see it, too. It was just as we remembered when
we say it on television years ago. She just loved it and has watched it often.",1292630400,,286,3.864406779661017
3120141,5,B0013XZ6G6,"Although the animation is not the caliber of todays animation, I highly recommend this video, and the book, for all ages. My 2 1/2 year old grandson watches this on a daily basis. It is short, 42 min., and holds his attention. Older kids may scoff at the animation, but soon get involved in the storyline and forget that this movie was made in the 1960's and become fans. The lessons in this story about friendship, trust, listening to adults, and learning to make good choices are invaluable!",1289347200,2,493,4.613636363636363
3120142,5,B0013XZ6G6,"The animation is a little dated, but kids do not care. Such a great story! I wish the other books in this series had been mad in to  movies too. check out the book with the same title",1286236800,,183,3.8157894736842106
3120143,5,B0013XZ6G6,"I got this movie for my 5 year old. He just loves it! My husband remembers reading this in grade school.
It is a very cute movie from the 80's. Happy Amazon had it to purchase!!",1282521600,,177,3.9444444444444446
3120144,5,B0013XZ6G6,"I don't remember this at all from childhood, even though it is a couple of decades old, but it is such a cute movie and I'm glad I found it.  My 4-yr old daughter loves it, as does my 7-year old nephew.  I love all of the Scholastic movies, but I think the kids liked this one more than others because it's not animated.",1274313600,6,320,3.984375
3120145,5,B0013XZ6G6,My ds borrowed this from the preschool video library and has watched it pretty much every day since.  This is on my to buy list!,1273190400,,128,4.12
3120146,5,B0013XZ6G6,I have loved this movie since I was a kid so I had to buy it for my son. He watches it multiple times weekly and sometimes multiple times daily! This movie is not at all annoying to have playing in the background even though he watches it alot! I recommend this movie for boys or girls (I am female and it was a fave) and for all parents who want their children to have the possibility to increase their imaginative skills while plopped in front of the tube!,1256688000,2,458,4.157303370786517
3120147,5,B0013XZ6G6,Remember that great Beverly Cleary book in school?  Remember being excited to watch the movie version? Well now you don't have to wait for an after school special or post Saturday morning cartoons (and you'd have to wait a long time because the late 80s are over) because your Mouse and the Motorcycle movie is now on DVD.

3354637,5,B0013XZ6G6,"My adult daughter loved this as a child on television. Now my granddaugter read it at school and was really happy that I was able to find it on DVD so she could see it, too. It was just as we remembered when
we say it on television years ago. She just loved it and has watched it often.",1292630400,,286,3.864406779661017
3354638,5,B0013XZ6G6,"Although the animation is not the caliber of todays animation, I highly recommend this video, and the book, for all ages. My 2 1/2 year old grandson watches this on a daily basis. It is short, 42 min., and holds his attention. Older kids may scoff at the animation, but soon get involved in the storyline and forget that this movie was made in the 1960's and become fans. The lessons in this story about friendship, trust, listening to adults, and learning to make good choices are invaluable!",1289347200,2,493,4.613636363636363
3354639,5,B0013XZ6G6,"The animation is a little dated, but kids do not care. Such a great story! I wish the other books in this series had been mad in to  movies too. check out the book with the same title",1286236800,,183,3.8157894736842106

My 4-yr old daughter loves it, as does my 7-year old nephew.  I love all of the Scholastic movies, but I think the kids liked this one more than others because it's not animated.",1274313600,6,320,3.984375

I recommend this movie for boys or girls (I am female and it was a fave) and for all parents who want their children to have the possibility to increase their imaginative skills while plopped in front of the tube!,1256688000,2,458,4.157303370786517
