8241414,4,B0011CW4L4,This DVD is a very interesting discussion about the idea of dominance theory used in dog training. Jean Donaldson is a fantastic presenter and makes reference to the scientific research about dominance theory of which there is virtually none. She argues that the whole concept is not based on real scientific evidence but more based on pop pyschology and has been perpetuated over decades without any actual evidence. The part of the seminar presented by Ian Dunbar is also very interesting although he does believe that a clear linear dominance hierarchy does exist for male dogs only. This is based on research he conducted during the 1970's. All in all a very interesting seminar.,1353196800,,683,5.0
8241415,5,B0011CW4L4,Jean Donaldson presents a compelling case for letting go of the dominance myth once and for all. Bravo!,1307145600,2,103,4.777777777777778
8241416,5,B0011CW4L4,"This is a long seminar, not an hour, but just over 4. I actually planned an event around it and we had the most fun when Jean Donaldsons part was on. She is one funny lady and speaks her mind in straight forward and intelligent ways. No bashing just reality. It brings up a great deal of information how to deal with TV generated information. Most of all what science has to say about some of that information today.
Dr. Dunbar is also entertaining, which is helpful in a learning situation, but I think Jean won over my party. I enjoy what Ian has to say, it just didn't have the same impact this time.

This is really a great video to share with friends so you can discuss what you learn. Here is an excerpt from a note I got from another trainer I lent it to: ""it really helped me work through some ethical issues about those darn trainer-client-dog relationships. I feel a lot more empowered now!"" THAT is how a lot of us felt after this DVD.",1266883200,10,946,4.2555555555555555
8241417,5,B0011CW4L4,"I am pleased to see Dunbar and Donaldson are FINALLY reaching a larger audience by doing the DVD's.  National Geographic should feature them each week - Not Cesar Millan.

Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful.",1244246400,4,202,5.28125
8241418,2,B0011CW4L4,"I was very disappointed with the entire disc one of this product; the Jean Donaldson part is something one could glean from a chapter of a book on the science & mythology of dominance theories. Her oration skills are not as professional as one would expect from a so-called-expert, as well.
On the other hand, Dr. Ian Dunbar (as always), is stupendous!!! So only disc two makes the product worth keeping in ones collection. Disc 2 has a total running time of: 1 hour & 47 minutes. He is a brilliant, humorous speaker with very note-worthy examples.

8241419,5,B0011CW4L4,"Jean Donaldson is all for trainers, this 1st DVD in the set really was wonderful. The tone was one of understanding ""Dog Relationships"" from a clinical point, where actual scientific studies of groups of dogs were made for many months and years. (not from a myth based airy fog) Far from dry, Jean has an incredible sense of humor! Her delivery makes ""Fighting"" a moot point.
Dr. Ian Dunbar is a long time scientist, vet and dog trainer. His studies go back to the seventies and his delivery is legendary, no dryness there. He was a pioneer in the changing of behavior in humans to be more humane! The end does get a little long and off subject toward the end, but only as it is the end does it make it feel long.
Both deliver information that should be required watching for all dog trainers and 'wanna be's'  Dog training is really about learning theory and how it works. ""Dominance"" is how the human race makes dogs in their own image! Watch this and pass it on! Lend it to your Vet and groomer and trainer if they haven't seen it!
