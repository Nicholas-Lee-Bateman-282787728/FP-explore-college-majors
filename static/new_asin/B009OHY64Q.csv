5360138,5,B009OHY64Q,"Our son is a Chef du Cuisine at a fine dining restaurant and we bough this has a gift for him. He loved it, and found it to be a fascinating look into the art and craft of culinary excellence.",1384905600,,192,3.825
5360139,5,B009OHY64Q,"This 94 minute DVD`s subject are the chefs and the Michelin stars that are awarded. Top chefs are included, interviewed and filmed. There are extras of the chef's biographies, about the film and a culinary film gallery. Much of the film is subtitled in English for translations.

The DVD says there are 10 chefs, yet in the film itself it says 9. At many points it is difficult to keep track of who is who and at what establishment we are at. The guide and time we are dealing with is for the 2009 Michelin guide.  The head inspector gives some interesting insights into reviewing, the stars and the effects those stars have on the restaurants.

This is definitely a film for foodies, some of the terms and wines are not explained they are just mentioned in the conversations. We are able to listen to not only interviews but films as the restaurant s and kitchens are working.
It is interesting to hear about the lives of these chefs and how they handle their kitchens and the stresses involved in their careers, especially when they receive these stars; keeping up their reputation and the expectations of themselves and the public.
Included is information concerning Chef Bernard Loiseau and his suicide, some feel that he was afraid he was going to lose his 3rd star.
Those interested in food and the culinary arts would enjoy this DVD.",1377820800,3,1340,4.669491525423729
5360140,4,B009OHY64Q,"At the time this film was made, only 71 restaurants around the world had a Michelin three-star rating, which denotes they are at the very top of a huge mountain. Three Stars takes a look at seven restaurants with three stars and one with two stars as well as a French chef who had a three-star establishment and shut it down. The film deftly sets the scene at the start when Ren Redzepi, who runs the two-star Noma in Copenhagen, explains that a three star ranking brings in the customers. Lots of customers. But once you have that third star, as Sergio Herman of the Oud Sluis in the Netherlands makes clear, it means you're under huge pressure to perform every meal. People are now coming from all over the world to your restaurant and Herman admits he does not like the pressure. The film switches back and forth between the restaurants, sometimes too quickly, and because each chef is only really introduced once you can lose track of who is speaking and where they are based. While I appreciate the attempt to be inclusive, I think the film could have lost at least two of the seven three-star establishments.

Not all these chefs are at the same stages of their career - Jean-Georges Vongerichten frets a lot about his growing global empire while Redzepi, Nadia Santini of Italy's Dal Pescatore and Yannick Allno from Le Meurice in Paris and have the time to go out into the countryside and look for new ingredients and fresh ideas.

The film also talks to Michelin's top inspector about how a restaurant can gain that coveted third star and how it can lose it too. We hear about top French chef Bernard Loiseau, who killed himself in 2003 after obsessing that he was about to lose his third star and with it a big chunk of his income. As Redzepi points out, you don't really make a lot of money from a single restaurant. A meal at Noma costs 230 Euros (about $310) and even that, we are told, is barely enough to cover staffing costs. Olivier Roellinger in France found the pressure too much and shut down his own restaurant and is now involved in something less stressful.

Flaws aside, this is a good documentary.",1376870400,3,2122,4.535248041775457
5360141,5,B009OHY64Q,"Great doc covers a lot of ground with active interviews with chefs doing the work of cooking, creating, and marketing their food.  Deals with the pros and the cons of the Michelin ""rating"" system.  A lot of diverse opinions with chefs passionate about food.  Thumbs Up!",1374796800,2,269,4.804347826086956
5360142,4,B009OHY64Q,"This 94 minute documentary - made in cooperation with German TV is the latest in the wonderful series of ""food related"" films from First Run Features. Unlike many of the others, which had a story where there was a contest, this film - though dealing with competition - does not really show the winners and losers. And - because of this - I found it a bit slow. It features (rather than ""follows"") nine international chefs who have high two or three star ratings in the prestigious Michelin Guide. Because they are international (French, Japanese, Scandinavian, German and American) much of the dialogue is in foreign (to Americans) language and require subtitles. (Surprisingly, other than the chef in New York's Trump Tower, the chef in Denmark speaks only in English.)

There is an interview with the new Director of the Michelin Guide explaining how they award - and remove - the stars.

There is lots of beautiful food and the chefs are all honest about the long hours they put in - and sometimes wonder if it's worth it. They also talk about how expensive it is to run a 3 star restaurant (they lose even at $250 per person!). Since most of us won't have the chance to dine in these places, we do get to see the inside of both the dining room and kitchen.

The bonuses include text bios of the chefs as well as a text bio of the Director.

If you love the FRF series as much as I do, you'll want to get this one. If you are a gourmet, you'll want it too. But expect to spend time reading the white (sometimes hard to read) subtitles.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5360145,4,B009OHY64Q,"A cross section of those dedicated to a life of gastronomy -  For many the enthusiasm and ideals that
launched their careers seem tempered by the ritualistic pressures of gaining and keeping these fabled
stars to a small select patronage  -  Perhaps why many now choose to rekindle their lives by applying
similar disciplines in their own establishments in more relaxed surroundings for the good of the greater
local populous and not those that create and protect a guide that seems out of step and out of date .

A lengthy documentary, beautifully shot but at times confusingly edited where one chefs restaurant and
philosophy becomes indistinguishable from the next  -  Worth watching and definitely Food For Thought .

5360164,3,B009OHY64Q,"It was an interesting enough documentary, but there were a couple of areas where the film-maker fell short.  I didn't like the camerawork.  There were a lot of scenes where it was too hard to see what people were doing or referring to.  And since this was a food-related documentary, especially since it focused on some very high-end restaurants with spectacular food and dcor, I thought the film-maker could have had more shots of the plates (food on the plates) and the dcor of the restaurants.  I live in Palm Springs, am a member of the Palm Springs Film Festival Society, and have seen many, many documentaries during the annual Documentary Fests.

5360168,4,B009OHY64Q,"My wife (a wonderful cook) and I (happy with PB&J when she's not around) were fascinated by the film, though neither of us will ever, even after winning the lottery, eat in one of these 3-star restaurants. In fact, we found it funny that 3-star chef Ishikawa goes to a noodle shop for a meal.

Well, more than funny. Completely understandable. Some of the dishes we see look more like paintings to be admired than food for sustenance or enjoyment.

To illustrate our hopeless ignorance and misunderstanding of haute cuisine, my wife and I were put off by not seeing a single chef wearing a hat or hair net as they worked on the dishes, and by how much fingering of food goes into preparing one of these meals.

For 230 euros, give us a hot-off-the-wok plate of Chinese/Thai/Vietnamese or a heaping dish of spaghetti & meatballs or, no joke, give us a Whopper.

And to show how entirely oblivious we are, but can we be the only ones distressed at spending 230 euros on a meal (the term ""meal"" being generous) when that much money could feed so many who are truly hungry.

It's a good documentary, however, even for hoi polloi like us who can't appreciate the craft of some great chefs. I thought the director used the available time quite well in giving us a picture of Michelin 3-star chefs and their restaurants.

Even if we'd never want to eat there.",1422144000,,1352,4.520491803278689

In chess, once you become a grandmaster, FIDE will not take the title away even if you eventually retire from the game.  The Nobel Prize Committee also would not ask their laureates to return the money if they stop doing or doing less research afterwards.  But being the chef and soul of a three-star restaurant, as long as the restaurant opens its door, you have to be perennially on top of your game, otherwise Michelin will take the star, or stars, away from you in a blink.  I also really appreciate the unique camera angle.  It has close shots of the beautiful dishes, of course.
