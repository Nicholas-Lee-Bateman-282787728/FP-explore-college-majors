Once the film came out, the philosophy of E.F.A., the bestiality-rights group at the heart of the film, had spread around the world and inspired fans and admirers to take action and stand up for themselves. Just these past two years (I'm writing this 2014) have seen bestiality-rights demonstrations in Berlin, the first ever of their kind, featuring E.F.A. very prominently. I'm not aware of any other film, especially a fiction film (I lean towards the reviewers here who say it's a fiction film) that has gone on to spark an actual revolution. If I'm wrong, please let me know in the comments. I find that to be the ultimate testament to this film's brilliance - and the genius of its title!

An absolute must-see, IMHO, for anyone interested in great cinema as well as the history and development of civilization. This will clearly go down as one of the key turning points in our quest for equality and rationality, alongside Stonewall, the Selma riots, etc. Well done Sir Tijn Po!!!",1403222400,,1438,4.5482625482625485

Well, after watching this DVD, animals' inability to express their consent because of only not speaking human languages, sustains really a weak ground for case-judgments based on an animal rape notion, in societies driven by an urge of possession especially.

8286447,5,B001CB154G,"Just to begin, I think this film is ingenious!

I don't think it's being marketed correctly; certainly not ingeniously. The film does deal with Bestiality-Rights, a good enough topic itself, but the film uses it only as a metaphor and launching pad for a philosophical (and hilarious) symphony.

Perhaps they thought they would shock people by pushing the bestiality angle but it simply stopped me from watching it for years - until a friend insisted I see it.

Great film! Definitely watch it! But don't expect any actual bestiality.

I hope to see more works by Sir Tijn Po (anyone know if there are any?)!",1283558400,2,608,4.761904761904762
8286448,4,B001CB154G,"There are no scenes containing naughty behaviors with animals. However, there are some disturbing scenes that might bother some viewers. One is during a story about a woman who loved a bull, and in the end it's killed by angry skin-heads. I don't know if the home movie shown was realy of the men killing the poor animal, and then slapping the bloody skin on the woman.. was real, or not...I'm hoping that it was not. There are other parts where pics. of skinned/dead animals will appear, which are distasteful in my opinion. However, the over all dvd was full of interesting information about the people who love animals in an xxx sort of way. If you liked the movie ""zoo"" (about Mr. Hands) then you'll like this dvd. However, some of the people interviewed are boring and long winded, but it's still worth seeing. Even for college students who are writing a paper on this topic would find this informative. The reason why I didn't give this movie all stars was due to some of the interviews conducted. I won't give specifics, but in my opinion there was some info. which was not informative, so why add it in? I had to fast forward parts of the dvd...too long.",1234742400,25,1162,4.538095238095238
