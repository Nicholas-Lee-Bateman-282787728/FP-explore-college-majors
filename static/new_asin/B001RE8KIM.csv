8337808,4,B001RE8KIM,Elmo is great but the Thomes movie is absolutely terrible. I would recommend just finding the Elmo in grouchland.,1484265600,,113,5.0

8337810,4,B001RE8KIM,I bought this 2-movie version bc it cost less than the Thomas movie itself.  My kids have loved this movie since their Aunt gave them their older cousins copy on VCR tape.  They broke it and I found this.  The Elmo movie is very weird and sort of dark and boring.  We tried watching it twice and everyone tunes out and then we turn it off.,1463443200,,339,4.090909090909091
8337811,5,B001RE8KIM,It was great,1444694400,,12,3.3333333333333335
8337812,3,B001RE8KIM,"Elmo held our kids attention, but aside from when Thomas was on screen the actual story lost the kids. Production on both was quite good. Maybe our kids were too young (2.7 and 1.6).",1383350400,,182,4.382352941176471
8337813,5,B001RE8KIM,my kids love this movie thy can sit down and watch this all day elmo is so like  and the way he care about his blanket,1372723200,,118,3.5384615384615383
8337814,5,B001RE8KIM,"Elmo was so entertaining! Kept my children busy on many a rainy day! We had to buy a second copy-they wore out the first one! And now, as they enter the dreaded teenage years, my daughter will still pop it in for a quick laugh (she wouldn't want her teen friends to know, but she still loves Elmo)! Mandy Patinkin stole the show as the bad guy & his sidekick ""Pesties"" had some funny lines. There were many good lessons to be learned, mainly the importance of sharing. It was the better of the two films. Thomas wasn't as good-a bit slow-but still fun for kids! It is for kids, after all, you shouldn't  review them as if they were made to entertain adults!",1369094400,,657,4.298387096774194
8337815,2,B001RE8KIM,Elmo doesn't put his best foot forward here and Thomas The Train is 1 of the most pitiful scripts I've ever seen put to celluloid. You might want to skip this 1 unless your just looking for a bargain on 2 movies for the price of one for your toddler.,1309996800,,250,4.02
