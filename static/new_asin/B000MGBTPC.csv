8168675,3,B000MGBTPC,"I teach elementary music and was a little disappointed in this for classroom use.  I needed to go over several vocabulary words used before viewing; the naked woman in the boat scene caused quite a stir; WWII was dark and hard to discuss with 3rd graders.  I have had to figure out how to fast forward some sections to get to the ones appropriate for third grade and fourth grade.  Perhaps someone should rate this DVD for appropriate age level for showing and put in on the cover.  There are better educational DVDs for instruments of the orchestra and easier classical pieces for teaching mood; movement; tone color, etc.",1453420800,,623,4.6880733944954125

8168677,5,B000MGBTPC,"A fascinating production based on the book by the renowned conductor Claudio Abbado, following his journey from a determined boy dreamer to his ""dreams come true"" era. The program includes clips from live events, rehearsals and concerts, allowing us to share Mr. Abaddo's feelings, perception and the consequent magical interpretation of the music. A great inspiration for children, and an interesting mix of audio & visual segments to be enjoyed by adults.",1171929600,8,457,5.361111111111111
8168678,5,B000MGBTPC,"This video basically recalls the childhood experiences of Claudio Abbado, growing up in Fascist-controlled Milan, Italy, in the thirties and early forties. The VHS version of this program has been around for years, and it is a great yarn, with splendid animation and good video of the orchestral presentations.  The only pertinent negative is the extraordinarily imperious narration by Raul Julia, which, even at its worst, doesn't ruin anything, but rather, adds some comedy to an excellent production.",1169856000,7,503,5.448717948717949
