Scientists who object to a Darwinian evolutionist view of the world are not being unscientific, they are calling into question WHY the fossil record, microbiology, DNA, laws of physics, etc etc etc contradict MACRO-evolution and how soooo many of these areas are better explained by a world-wide flood, a young age of the earth, and an Original Intelligence (i.e. first cause) who set the universe into being.",1382486400,9,878,5.302158273381295
