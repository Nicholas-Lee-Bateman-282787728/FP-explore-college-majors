8375351,3,6303254497,"The only real reason to watch this movie is if you like Michael St. Gerard's work.  While his acting was great and he captures the role, the story line is very lacking.  There is some flow to the movie, but there are few details to tie things together.  Also, characters suddenly have information or items they couldn't have known or gotten because they weren't present nor did they have access to know or gain the items.  This movie is more flashy effects (from 1994) and no information on character motivations.  I will still watch it again many times, but that is only because Michael St. Gerard is still able to turn a two-demensional character into a person you want to see grow.",1110412800,,684,4.573770491803279
