Colors improved etc. Now with the last 3 Super bowls (37 being condenced from 18 to 7 min.) it's Awesome fun to watch again and again (all together or just the blunder bowl etc).

The best part is the 23 minute recap of Super Bowl 39 from an all new perspective. I imagine it will be the same version if and when Warner releases the 5 DVD collection of XXXI-XL.

Be careful of rebuying the Team Dvd collections. I bout Green Bay Super bowl collection DVD thinking it would be season highlights of their super bowl season but I & II are just the same as in the larger collection as I'm sure XXXI will be.

The ""in their own words"" segment is terrific and may be the same as the DVD in the new Super Bowl book recently released.

I'd give the DVD 5 Stars just for the price.

8084383,3,B000BB1MJG,"I'm no expert in this great game since we don't have the opportunity to watch US Football games in France.

But still...

This DVD gives a nice review for each Super bowl game.

Unfortunately, these reports are quite short and only give a brief presentation for each game.

Good for those who want to watch an overview of these decades of spectacular sport events.",1163116800,2,364,4.640625

8084385,4,B000BB1MJG,I found this DVD to be very informative and a way to keep up with all Super Bowls played up to date. A good trivia source.,1141344000,2,122,3.730769230769231
8084386,5,B000BB1MJG,This was a gift for my son-in-law's birthday and he was very pleased with the DVD.  I have since ordered the new Super Bowl DVD since his team is the Steelers who won this year.  I know that will be his favorite!,1140998400,,212,4.023809523809524
8084387,3,B000BB1MJG,"a really good product.of course it could have been better if it included more footage from prvious superbowls.almost 45 minytes of the run time its about super bowl 39. if the run time was equally divided for each super bowl the outcome would have been much better.anyway a good effort.the best part is ""in their own words"" which includes many interviews an d facts about the super bowl",1140825600,5,386,4.6911764705882355
8084388,3,B000BB1MJG,"If you want a rapid review of every super bowl, then this DVD is a good purchase.  However it was almost to rapid of a summary, just giving a few minutes to each game.  All in all I would have to rate this as very ordinary.  However I purchased the DVD fairly cheap, so it wasn't a total loss.",1140652800,,293,3.9322033898305087
