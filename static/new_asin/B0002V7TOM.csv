This is a silent film but has added music. It begins at the famous cathedral. The Festival of Fools is the one day of the year when people had unrestrained pleasure. It is in the late 15th century, 1482. The church bells ring. King Louis XI passes through the crowd. High above Quasimodo attracts attention by climbing down the building. Esmeralda appears. A noblewoman puts her child to bed; later she was stolen! Phoebus is named Captain of the Guard. Esmeralda dances in the square. On her way home in the dark Jehan and Quasimodo meet her, but the Guard rescues her. At the Court of Miracles the blind see and the lame walk (beggars). Phoebus takes Esmeralda to the Pomme d Eve tavern. Esmeralda wears a golden token around her neck for safety. Gringoire is stripped of his clothes and is threatened by this crowd. Esmeralda halts the hanging.

Quasimodo is sentenced to being lashed in public. Esmeralda brings water to Quasimodo. The public enjoys this entertainment. Phoebus takes Esmeralda to a ball. Can the beggars rescue her? Princess of Egypt? Phoebus hands out a long line. Esmeralda halts the conflict. [Note now many are armed.] Gringoire brings a message. Clopin fears he will lose Esmeralda, she talks of taking the veil. What can he do? Phoebus meets Esmeralda to say goodbye. Others see them. One sneaks up and stabs Phoebus in the back! But Esmeralda is blamed. In Court she points out the murderer but is not believed. She is given the question to make her confess. A wooden boot presses her foot to make her confess. She is sentenced to hang. Can she be rescued? Not on those terms! The great bell tolls to announce the execution.

That medallion identifies Esmeralda! But its too late. Or can Quasimodo rescue her? He asks for Sanctuary, Esmeralda will be protected pending an appeal. Clopin plans to rescue Esmeralda and gathers the beggars. Can they revolt against the aristocracy? Phoebus recovered from his wounds. Masses of people arrive at the cathedral. The mob riots! The Captains Guard approaches, there is fighting. The mob is dispersed. Jehan attacks Esmeralda. Quasimodo attacks Jehan, they struggle. Jehan loses and falls. But Quasimodo is wounded. The bell tolls. Is it too late to help Quasimodo?

The lack of voices makes this difficult to follow (unless you read the book). King Louis XI was a contemporary of Richard III, the Last Plantagenet king of England. There was another version of this movie in 1943. Do people read this novel anymore? You should if you want the full details instead of this condensed version. Would they make a movie where people are encourage to rise up against the aristocracy? Is there a need for this?",1477267200,,2712,4.813304721030043
8032565,4,B0002V7TOM,"Assuming you know all about this silent classic, this will comment on the quality. It's quite an above-average print; there are many worse quality copies available in the market. This would be the one I'd recommend as the expensive versions aren't all that much better as far as I've seen. Apparently this Delta dvd is deleted now but it can be found easily and inexpensively from amazon sellers.",1216684800,2,396,4.838235294117647
