2697783,4,B000KWZ242,"We weren't as impressed with this set as some reviewers but when there's nothing on TV and we feel like just putting our feet up and avoiding any commercials it fills the bill. We've had it for several months and have yet to see all of the episodes, we generally just watch one per sitting.",1418515200,,290,4.290909090909091

2697788,2,B000KWZ242,"This video was extremely slow and boring; even the narrators commentary was lack luster.  In my opinion, the video simply talked about how and what the animals eat, and their place on the food chain sorta speak.  You can get this same info from PBS, as a matter of fact, it was a repeat of what we'd already seen. If you want adventure and excitement, this is not the video to purchase; save your money!",1273795200,,403,4.36

We bought this for my Father-in-law because he likes to watch Marty Stouffer's Wild America; but can never remember when it's on TV.
It's a timeless gift he will watch over and over for many years.",1231200000,2,482,8.11320754716981
2697790,5,B000KWZ242,"I've read some of Marty's outdoor writings before, including one of his books. Saw this 4-DVD set, and it was well worth it.

Just on the one DVD I've seen so far, the ""North Country"" one, I got both slow spped and normal speed extended chases of snowshoe hares by lynx, and then, on the second half, two wolverines battling, along with a wolverine chasing not one but two wolves off a deer carcass.

This is all high quality video production too, and in great places. Far northern Minnesota for the lynx and Montana's famed ""Bob,"" the Bob Marshall Wilderness, for the wolverines. AND, both in winter.

No need for you to wait for me to review all for DVDs in the set. Get your own!",1228089600,9,682,4.396825396825397
8159216,5,B000KWZ242,"For people that don't experience wildlife on a regular basis these episodes explain the truth as opposed to the way wild animals are portrayed in movies and TV shows. People that really want to understand wildlife should view and learn. What your told by most ""animal rights groups"" has no basis in fact. Having lived in and owned rural property in  Wyoming, Nevada, Utah and Colorado we get to see wildlife as it really is. This series will get you as close as possible at home. It was a sad day when they were no longer part of PBS.",1505347200,,534,4.393939393939394
