I worked with bonobos at the Milwaukee County Zoo.",1445558400,,173,4.516129032258065

8202232,5,B000RPCJT8,"The Bonobo is not known by most people - even those who love chimps and the other  jungle and mountain apes.  This video will inform - and cause anyone who sees it to respect and probably love this ape - just as I did when I first heard of them.  They are even more rare - and closer to extinction -than chimps and need all the support they can get from the most dangerous great ape - the human. There are several great books about bonobos and at least 2 organizations in the U.S. who help support them and provide sanctuaries in their native land.

I recommend this video to ape lovers and those who respect nature and all it's amazing creatures.",1386892800,,647,4.278688524590164
8202233,5,B000RPCJT8,"I bought this to donate to a silent auction at our Zoo's ""Gorilla Dinner"".  Worked well.  People know so very little about how extremely intelligent and capable these little Apes are.",1368403200,2,183,4.870967741935484
8202234,5,B000RPCJT8,"""The Last Great Ape"" gives the viewer a close view into bonobo female dominated, peaceful society and the war torn county they live in, the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  This documentary features Frans de Waal and other primatologists who explain how interesting it is that the behavior and social structures of both bonobos and chimpanzees almost mirror the two sides of human behavior.  The viewer will be exposed to the intelligent eyes and altruistic actions of the bonobos, the history of their habitat and the DOC, and the possibility of their extinction (but how blessed we are that they are still in the wild post war).",1275609600,13,632,4.897196261682243
