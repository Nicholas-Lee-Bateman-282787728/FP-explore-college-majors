8592759,4,B000059PRT,"This is a goofy little character, a little off from the normal Disney characters.  He's a dirty sock eating monster that lives under a boys bed.  My daughter fell in love with him at about 2 1/2.  I wasn't sure about her watching him, but what I saw that she learned amazed me!  She's not afraid of monsters!  She thinks that ""monsters"" are all as funny and silly as bumpy and the closet monster, that comes after bumpy, is just a lump of dirty clothes.  He influenced her so much that she name her dog BUMPY!  She loves Mr. Bumpy's friend squishington & his dolly friend molly.  My husband and I got a kick out of watching this with her.  Hope you enjoy!  (other favorites - Barney, Sesame Street, Power Puff Girls, Veggie Tales, Dragon Tales, Timmy the Tooth)",988848000,7,761,4.410071942446043
