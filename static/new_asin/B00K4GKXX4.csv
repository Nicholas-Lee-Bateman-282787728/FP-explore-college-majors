He was a Spanish-speaking genius of comedy with the sensitivity of Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy and the other greats of early Hollywood...",1521763200,,264,5.0227272727272725

8655839,5,B00K4GKXX4,"In my opinion another memorable movie with a slightly darker tone than all of his movies before this and same as ""Conserje En Condominio"" a favorite of mine. This scene where he is helping some guy to give a girl he (the guy) is pretending a ""serenata"" (serenade) and this other one where he disguises (resembling Steve Austin the Six Million Dollar Man) in order to get into this bar looking for ""Johnny"" and his cronies, just phenomenal; some other actor playing the scene with Johnny and his cronies at the bar or the other one where he was trying to stop them from taking the contraband shipment to the border, trust me, they would have been as cheesy as they can get but Cantiflas with his natural genius for acting and comedy made them very credible in a funny way.",1417305600,,771,4.475177304964539
