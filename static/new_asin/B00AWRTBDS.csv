8558547,5,B00AWRTBDS,I just recently discovered Cathe. I've now added a few of her DVD's to my collection. She gives the right amount of cardio and toning. She provides excellent cuing and is motivating! Hard Strikes will give your upper body a tough workout. I can already see how toned my arms are now.,1399420800,,283,4.461538461538462
8558548,5,B00AWRTBDS,"If you approach this workout from the perspective that it's a good conditioning workout for boxing, you will like this workout.  This is not a kickboxing workout; the focus is on upper body and core. I didn't think it was super intense, even with the cardio intervals.  That's okay though, the workout serves a purpose.

This is a 46 minute workout consisting of boxing conditioning drills. Dumbbells are all you need for this workouts.  Boxing gloves are optional.  The gloves are used in both the main workout and the Heavy Bag Bonus sections.

Why I enjoyed this workout:

* The versatility.  You can make this as tough or as easy as you like.  I used 1 1/2 pound weighted gloves to add to the intensity.  I also kept it low impact during the intervals but I still felt I got a good workout.

* The music!  I can't believe that I am saying I liked the music.  Usually, I don't like Cathe's taste in music, but this time she nailed it.  The quick, driving beat really helped energize me.  There is a mix of vocals and music.  The vocals weren't too loud in this workout either, unlike some of the other Xtrains.

* The premix variety.  I love to workout for an hour, so I prefer the longer premixes.  I love to add the 3 Bonus Heavy Bag Tabatas to round out the routine. The many premixes both longer and shorter than the 46 minute main workout. Several premixes even include weight training from other Xtrain workouts like Burn Set Tris, Core and 100 Rep Challenge Bicep curls.  There's something for everyone.

There are some things to note about this workout, but these aren't necessarily negatives. The things to note:

* If you have any sort of shoulder weakness or injury, this is NOT the workout for you.  Almost every exercise uses the shoulders.  A lot of the exercises are done very quickly too.  This can be a recipe for further injury.

* While the hot pink boxing gloves that are worn for both the main workout and the heavy bag section are cool to look at, I personally don't think they are necessary.  I am not tempted to buy yet another piece of exercise equipment, especially something that has a limited use.  I can see how they would be helpful for the heavy bag section.  I used weighted gloves and get almost the same sensation.

* The Bonus Bag Tabatas didn't seem all that intense to me.  Other Cathe Tabata workouts leave me gasping for air.  I don't think that I've suddenly become super fit.  I don't have a heavy bag, so I punch away at a towel hanging from a pipe in my workout room.  Perhaps if I had a heavy bag, the tabatas  would feel more intense.

I recommend this workout for anyone wanting to improve their boxing skills.  It will condition your upper body, that's for sure!",1364169600,,2712,4.45010183299389
