8409227,5,B003YGT1SE,Great video of two Jazz legends just playing.  Excellent sound and video.  Pat plays mainly acoustic nylon and steel and also his Pikasso guitar.  If is a fan of Pat or of the laid back smoldering improv of the Missouri Sky album you should dig this DVD.,1434931200,,254,4.361702127659575
