8055605,2,B00084MST4,"It is not recent. but is OK. The package is very bad, I made exchane three times still have scrached DVD. I finaly give up.",1173744000,2,123,3.96
8055606,3,B00084MST4,"This DVD had been introduced in 2005 according to the package note, but the sound and image quality are so poor as if they were ripped from VHS counterpart produced earlier.

And if you are a technology geek and buying this product hoping you can put your hands on some cutting-edge technologies, forget about it.

This is all about the images and history, not about how it works, I mean, it's more like a History channel thing than a Discovery channel type.

Making things even worse, although the running time is approximate 60 min. or so, 10-20% of them are just repetitions with different narrations or music.

I graded this DVD with 3 stars only because of the price.

If it's more than $30, definitely out of the buying list.",1166486400,4,731,4.592307692307692
