8326594,4,B001MM0NG6,"First watched this back in 1992, during Shark Week. Had it recorded onto a blank vhs tape, until about 1996 when I recorded over it. Up until my purchase of this, I thought that this documentary would be forever lost & never be seen again. Thanks to the buyer for allowing me to continue with my Shark Week Documentary Collection!",1428278400,,330,4.516666666666667
