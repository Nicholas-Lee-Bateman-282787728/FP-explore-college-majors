8709246,1,B00V4TUCO0,"One of the worst movies of 2015 for sure. Not bad good either just plain old bad bad bad. It was a struggle to make it through the whole movie. I love demented stuff but this was so cliche and the actors played it straight the whole time and it just was laughable. One reviewer compared the killer to Patrick Bateman and Norman Bates. Wow I really want what that person was smoking and drinking. This movie is dumb, unbelievable and horrible. I promise you anybody that buys this and watches it that's not involved in the making of this will agree with me. God this film was dumb from beginning to end. I usually try to find one positive thing to help he potential viewer decide if they want to invest their time but The Meat Puppet has nothing good about it. Corny and just silly. Don't waste your time. Trust me I watch a lot of movies and his is worthless.",1444262400,4,859,4.276073619631902

8709248,5,B00V4TUCO0,"If you loved Christian Bales character Patrick Bateman in ""American Psycho,"" then youll go gaga over the charming sociopathic ways of Drew Shelton in The Meat Puppet.  Words cannot truly capture the depth and psychological power of this spectacular film.  Keith Collins does it again  another stellar performance. Only this time, hes truly outdone himself and his craft in ""The Meat Puppet"" falls nothing short of a masterpiece.  Collins brings forth a character reminiscent of Norman Bates delving into a twisted Oedipus complex world filled with a creepy woman who adores his passion for blood played by the stoic Geri Reischl. The viewer enters full force into a rollercoaster ride filled with sadism and suspense that will keep you endlessly wanting more and more and more. Chilling murders, a competitive detective wanting to solve them, gore, sex, mayhem, love. What else could one ask for in a film that is guaranteed to give all the classics a run for their money?  Those who remember the Tales From The Crypt episode Whats Cookin will appreciate the insatiable appetite of Sheltons quest for gourmet perfection. For the weak stomach viewers, Collins does a mesmerizing job in creating a cold-blooded killer that one can actually empathize with as he weeps and bellows, Its not my fault! Its not my fault!  ""The Meat Puppet"" brings forth something new and amazing to the suspense world: even the coldest have the ability to love.",1438300800,5,1437,5.016806722689076
