8339579,1,B001SAOTO4,"Seems like an incorrectly burned DVD, unreadable on any DVD player or on computer.",1452384000,,82,4.928571428571429
8339580,5,B001SAOTO4,"Benny Meng knows how to give in clear and concise manner a full explanation, without getting bogged down into details. He manage to keep the fine line between what you need to know about the concept as well application, so you can add this to your own training.",1448928000,,261,4.458333333333333

8339582,5,B001SAOTO4,Another in the different ways to learn.,1417219200,,39,4.714285714285714
8339583,5,B001SAOTO4,"As with my Part 2 review, I am highly satisfied with Mr. Meng's videos, and this dummy form video set is no different.  Very clear instruction, great examples of application, and several angles of all the techniques so you can see what's going on.  I can't imagine anyone that is trying to learn the authentic dummy form could possibly be disappointed from this set.",1411171200,2,366,4.703125
8339584,4,B001SAOTO4,"It is easy to follow, but I was looking for something that would go through the dummy training for beginners. It is hard to follow the dummy form being they are done at normal speed and aren't repeated or broken down for beginners to follow. I'm sure this will come in useful when I have actual learned and practiced down the line.",1396569600,,331,4.354838709677419
8339585,4,B001SAOTO4,It helped me to understand the wooden dummy better. If your a guy like me that lives in the middle of no where with no King-Fu schools with in a 100 miles or more in the area you live. This will help a lot for beginners.,1326499200,4,220,3.8043478260869565
