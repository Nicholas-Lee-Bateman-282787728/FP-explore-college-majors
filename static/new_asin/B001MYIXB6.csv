3702720,3,B001MYIXB6,"There seems to be a new genre of movies (Hostel, Turista, Rest Stop, Shuttle) I will call ""tourists in peril.""  Based on warning movies like the Virgin Springs, it encourages moviegoers to stay at home in front of their tv sets where the cosmos is safe.  Don't consider traveling because the moment you step outside the security of your living room- heaven forbid, into another country- you are basically walking from one death trap into another.

The situational drama in Donkey Punch is intense at certain moments, and the acting is fairly decent.  The mental violence and acts of intimidation at some points will probably disturb women more.  To sum it up, basically, Donkey Punch is Very Bad Things without the black humor, with more passengers than Dead Calm all thrown in a Lifeboat situation where each character's moral fiber comes to the surface.  Out in international seas where the law changes each time one enters into different waters, a Darwinist ""Survival of The Fittest"" mentality ensues, as brawn is pitted against brains, the physically weak manipulating their opposite, and everyone has to depend on their strengths to survive. We the audience get to speculate on just who will come out on top.

Given the targeted demographics and the average age of the actors, the ensemble does quite a good job.  I did find it a little difficult to believe how Tami (Nichola Burley) had such reservations about getting on the boat with strange men, and then suddenly is all smiles and agreement with her girlfriends when the four male strangers they just met decide to take the ship out to sea for a party.

The unrated scene in this movie that concerns the act has a medium amount of nudity, but nothing more than a typical sex scene in an R-rating movie.  I had to go back and re-view the scene when I read someone complaining about anal shots (there are none).  The total amount of nudity is under five minutes.  There is not enough exposure to tell whether the sex is protected or not.  Note that this is not the same movie as an adult movie by the same name.  (That movie has already been removed from circulation)

Donkey Punch will probably get exposure from people casually conversing about the nature of the act (Look it up in Urban Dictionary), after all, among just about everyone I know (male and female friends), there's a roster of names for exotic sex moves that are discussed and laughed about at parties.  This movie even has a scene that resembles that very conversation.  Think California Hot Plate, Dirty Sanchez, Birmingham Booty Call, and the inevitable Tony Danza.

For the uninitiated, Donkey Punch is a dangerous move.  There is a reason why Mixed Martial Arts forbid punching in the back of the head.  You can do serious brain damage as some of the more fragile portion of your head is back there.  So don't try it at home.",1239494400,2,2855,4.715725806451613
3702721,4,B001MYIXB6,"As a setting, the horror, thriller, and suspense genres have had a mixed amount of luck out at sea, despite the location being ripe for fear. From the high-brow cinematic treasures like Knife in the Water (1962) to the A-list cast Dead Calm (1989), the hokey Ghost Ship (2002), and the average Below (2002): the enclosed, isolated atmosphere of the ocean can create the setup for many claustrophobic movies dependent on tension. One such film is Donkey Punch: survival horror about a group of youths that become torn apart when one of them dies during a yacht cruise. Lines are drawn amongst those on the boat and violence and murder begins to spiral out of control. Do note, that the word ""Donkey Punch"" refers to a dangerous and depraved sex act, which serves as the catalysis for the events that take place. As a terror ride Donkey Punch is much better than most, with much of the last hour of the film well near riveting, even if much of what is done is expected.

Despite some of its clear flaws, Donkey Punch breaks barriers of what can be considered taboo, especially amazing in a time of alleged torture porn films and arty non-simulated sex movies like The Brown Bunny (2003). This film is quite shocking in nearly every way imaginable, but despite many being put off by what is displayed on screen, others hopefully will see that the film is quite masterfully emotional in the nerve-wracking sense. As Donkey Punch is a film that creates a ""what if?"" scenario and with it a battle of the sexes erupts stemming from introspection for some of the characters and self-preservation for others. The film is unpleasant, yes. However, everything it shows (though done to the extreme) is a fact of life: whether it be gratuitous and unpleasant sexual acts or even murder to sustain a normal existence. Donkey Punch has a strong center in that aspect and in fact in many ways it is a morality tale.

Donkey Punch sets itself up to stall often due to the premise being rather thin (how many times can we really have conversations about the videotape that then later escalates into violence?) despite many of the obvious characters arcs, stereotypes, and situations dressed up in a different way the flick still works pretty well. As with his first directorial effort, Olly Blackburn, does an admirable job.

Production wise the film is quite impeccable: cinematographer Nano Segal brings an excellent sense of location to both the yacht and atmosphere. The film is moodily scored (by Francois-Eudes Chanfrault) and Blackburn's sound design adds additional oomph!. Blackburn also tells the story in both a nice clip and the acting department is fantastic by all, as well. Also notable is the way that despite a good twenty-five minute character-building intro, the characters really come into their own when the action begins: characters develop and mold with the tension, which is something that is often missing in films, both new and old.

Underrated and misunderstood, Donkey Punch is a film that may be often rote in much of its screenplay elements, yet when it comes to fear it gets the job done quite nicely.

3702722,3,B001MYIXB6,"An engaging little thriller whose title will either repell you or have you at hello, Donkey Punch is an interesting film that will hold your interest.  The story involves the meeting of three girls and four guys, who take to a yacht to party on the ocean.  Drugs and sex soon follow, as does the act that the title of the film implies, which doesn't go well for anyone involved either.  Soon enough, everyone is at each other's throats, and a bloody battle for survival escalates.  Donkey Punch is not without its shocking scenes of violence and occasional inventive kills, but the film as a whole ends up being predictable and not well-paced.  Still, in terms of sex and violence, Donkey Punch heartily delivers the goods, and while it pushes the suspension of disbelief the longer it goes on, it remains an interesting thriller from across the pond that will hold your interest.",1239148800,,880,4.7254901960784315
3702723,2,B001MYIXB6,"Had to give it one extra star on the production feel, as the film stock and camera work were adequate for being a boat film. Other than that, it falls into that guilty pleasure category, which is the only excerpt on the cover I agree with.

The story has been told here already, but I admittedly had to be advised by a customer (before I had seen the film) what the title meant. As a result I have already had several others ask if it was a porn because of the title, which the answer is no - but there were numerous times where the acting appeared as if though they were on a porn set. I honestly felt the acting was fair to below average, but the story is so mismanaged that by the end, any believability or hair of reality is gone. The first half is filled with drinking, drugs and explicit sex. The last half is filled with a light comedy sketch of how not to put a ""tense thriller"" together.

Tons of cliches to fill here, ripe with the pointless killing of one self after saving your friend, having dialogue scenes with the people that just tried to kill you as if all is well, planning one's alibis better when naked, etc. In the end, you know you just watched a low grade film that catered to the guilty side of watching good looking young people having sex then killing each other.",1238889600,6,1290,4.239837398373984
3702724,4,B001MYIXB6,"""Donkey Punch"" is a grisly little thriller that doesn't--pardon my pun--pull any punches.  A gaggle of young adults start out happy at a party having a good time and enjoying each other's company in sun-drenched Mallorca, Spain.  Three girls and three guys on the same wave length hook up, searching for sex, drugs, and rock-and-roll.

What they end up with is something else indeed.

They go to a yacht that the guys have use of and party hearty.  What starts out as oodles of erotic fun turns ghastly.  In no time, they're at each other's throats, struggling to save their own skins from a situation that becomes catastrophic for all of them--all because of a certain sex act that goes horribly wrong on their yacht off the coast of Spain.  To survive they hatch plots against each other turning on each other like rats on a sinking ship.

I found the death scene with the dinghy's painter strangling the guy contrived.  How did that happen?  But, all in all, it's a good story with several gruesome action scenes.

One minor complaint.  I did have difficulty understanding chunks of the dialogue on account of the thick British accents and slang used by the characters.

3702744,2,B001MYIXB6,"""Donkey Punch"" is an ugly movie; grotesque, in fact. It has no real redeeming qualities other than attractive women who don't disrobe nearly enough for it to be considered sexy. In fact even the sex is gross, and there is more male nudity (and much more explicit) than female nudity, so if you're a straight male definitely don't watch this expecting to be titillated.

The characters are pretty much disgusting and are motivated by drug use even more than sex. Actually that combination is where everything goes wrong for them: One girl ends up dead due to the mythical sex act that the film is named after. By the end of the movie six of the seven characters are dead in increasingly gory ways.

On top of that, I don't know if it's my American ears or their terrible enunciation and delivery--maybe just poor audio mixing--but the actors in this film are terribly difficult to understand. Basically cockney, some more mumbled than others. One more strike against a movie that's already no fun to watch.

I didn't give this one star because the movie has very high production values for an indie feature, and is shot beautifully (when not in 90  percent darkness).",1416268800,,1166,4.729064039408867

Donkey Punch is a faux-military martial art blow. I actually enjoyed all of this movie, because the first act lasts just long enough for you to get to know the various, very differing, male and female characters before the real action starts. The males are real macho bullying types, and I cannot understand why the girls went on the boat with them. The music complements the events and I thought the movie somehow has real atmosphere, possibly accidental but definitely not just to do with smellyvision. The film is quite violent and bloody, and the ending is exactly the sort of thing that could happen at the end of a story like this. Heavyish sex scenes. 16/9.",1359072000,,827,4.710344827586207

One thing that bothered me was I couldn't put on the subtitles. Most of the people had very difficult accents to make out at some point and time in the film. After the initial situation takes place this is where the movie either becomes a joke or pretty interesting. For me it was a little of both...I mean come on really? So now we have a dead girl with a broken neck, two freaked out girls, four shady guys developing a plan to save their behinds, and a video tape that shows the whole thing go down..

Needless to say the boys and girls disagree with what they think they should do..this is were the tension rises. The little excitement that comes from the film with exception of the naked girls I don't want to spoil for you so ill leave you to watch it yourself. I will say it's actually pretty interesting.

The problem with the film is that the characters are all isolated on a yacht out at sea. While the yacht is pretty cool, there is not many places to hide or do much else so the tension is more or less evaporated and comes down to who is going to kill who next. None of the characters seem to behave in any sort of realistic way and thus I must assume they are all idiots.

3702758,2,B001MYIXB6,"The movie's title should tell you all you need to know about the artistic ambition of the filmmakers. A Donkey Punch is not a boxing term or a beverage served in a bowl at parties. It's an act of violence perpetrated during sex - possible mythical (I'm naive in these matters) - in which the aggressor punches his partner hard on the back of the neck causing involuntary muscular contractions. So Donkey Punch is to four-legged mammals what Dirty Sanchez is to unwashed Mexicans and Strawberry Shortcake is to fruity deserts.

The film opens in sun-kissed Ibiza where a group of pleasure-seeking English boys pick up a gaggle of fellow countrylasses in a bar and, after plying them with champagne, invite them back onboard their private yacht for after party. The girls are soon installed on said vessel, glass in hand, bikinis likewise. Once the drink starts to flow and the industrial-strength amphetamines kick in, the youngsters pair off and go below deck to, er, cement their new bonds of friendship. In the ensuing orgy one of the boys misguidedly attempts a - I can hardly write it - Donkey Punch on his partner with the result that she dies instantly. What follows is a slickly executed but remarkably unengaging chain of slasher-style killings, intrigues and plot-twists played out in the confined spaces of a small luxury yacht. It's a sort of cross between Texas Chainsaw Massacre I and Dead Calm. Yet while the former is a genuinely creepy experience and the latter has strong individual character performances, the cast of Donkey Punch are virtually indistinguishable, both in appearance and acting ability. Except for the bad guy, you can tell it's him because of his hair-lip.
So while being technically proficient piece of filmmaking by debut director Olly Blackburn, much about Donkey Punch simply comes across as a dramatised version of Temptation Island.",1264723200,12,1873,4.984025559105431

The guys are callous and contemptible and the girls more than a little stupid. Although there are signs that the writers realised this, and therefore tried to make a couple of the characters more sympathetic, there's no one here that the viewer can really empathise with and as a result the brutality (and there's plenty of it) is diffused in its effect. And, while the viewer's allegiance is challenged from time to time, its hard to care too much about who survives and who doesn't. It's also a little slow in delivering the mayhem.

8322462,3,B001MYIXB6,"Because of a violent sex scene (no spoiler here), this movie should have been rated NC-17. Warning - in a graphic sex scene a person is ""accidentally"" killed in what can only be described as an act of sexual abuse.",1519344000,,214,4.375
8322463,4,B001MYIXB6,"This surprises me with the amount of explicit sex in the movie, but I thought it was a good movie - be advised - there's a lot in one section. It was well handled and believable. And, as other reviewers, I didn't know what a donkey punch was. But I loved the on vacation attitude in the beginning and partying does happen. It kept me engaged - I thought the actors were good and believable. I thought the plot was plausible. It better than many of the kinda thriller genre.",1518998400,,473,4.266666666666667
8322464,3,B001MYIXB6,"I seriously almost turned it off about half way through when I had seen my share of sex / drugs / dongs but the abrupt change in pace and tone happened at just the right time. Borderline boring, but an okay flick I suppose.",1513900800,,223,4.090909090909091
8322465,4,B001MYIXB6,"Not really a horror movie, more of a thriller (but spoiler/trigger warning: one guy does get tortured) as its not really frightening; instead the affect is tension or suspense. All in all, perhaps this could be considered an interesting take on toxic masculinity: essentially everyone dies because one guy is trying to prove hes a man. Potential spoiler, but I don't think it gives too much away to say one of the men donkey punches a women while having sex with her (his friend eggs him on by saying, you know what to do) and kills her. In the resulting attempt at a cover-up almost everyone else is killed as characters all try to avoid responsibility. In the end it becomes a statement about how most human beings will do anything to save themselves. A few horror film tropes are applied: anyone who has sex must die, (although one of the more innocent characters is killed also) which is pretty common in action as well as horror films.",1512777600,,940,4.601190476190476
8322466,5,B001MYIXB6,Really well done especially compared to a lot of the junk that passes for horror flicks on Amazon prime.,1504224000,,104,4.526315789473684
8322467,3,B001MYIXB6,Good movie probably not worth watching more than once. Please read discripton carefully as did not come with a case,1500163200,,115,4.8
