634132,5,6303393985,This Old Classic Tale have been watched by millions of people through the ages who loves outlaw heros. Tyrone Powers and Henry Fonda does a great job. This movie is one that is near to the real outlaw true story.,1178928000,,212,4.325
634133,3,6303393985,"This movie used to be available only on VHS.  Thanks to technology, it is now featured on DVD.  The only caveat is the subtitles, which I did not anticipate.",1175472000,,157,4.379310344827586
634134,2,6303393985,"Knowing that 20th Century Fox IS capable of quality restoration, as proven in their 30+ Studio Classics Series, I was let down by the amature color reproduction of what should be the magic that film's shot in technicolor produce.  Of the two films from 20th Century, ""Jesse James"" and ""The Return of Frank James"", ""Jesse James"" is so poorly transferred to DVD that I had to remove all color from my television calibration panel and then adjust the picture for the best quality b&w that my Sony is capable of.

It is truly a shame when a company seems to arbitrarily decide to reproduce some classic films to their glorious original condition and then simply ignore others.  In 1939 Tyrone Power was Hollywoods leading man. In The Mask of Zorro (Another 20th Century Fox film) the DVD transfer and restoration by 20th Century Fox was excellent.  This is a sham and an insult to technicolor's genius. Those who enjoy film do not simply consider the plot to be the only critiera by which a film is enjoyed or judged.  All elements of making a film from lighting, to composition, to color, sound, etc.. all play a part in a film's drama.

BUT NOT IN THIS PATHETIC LONG AWAITED TECHNICOLOR CLASSIC. I would not have purchased this film if I had known that it would look as if it had been stored in a cardboard box along with all the color family photos that now have a pale cyan/magenta cast, no detail in the shadows and an overall reproduction that makes most of the photos and film look as if it were shot at night. ""The Return of Frank James"" is still presented in rather good Technicolor (not its best either). The stories, no matter how historically fictional they may be, are sheer Western fun.

But that fun is diminished when the visual presentation of the stories are so poorly presented that one has to wonder if consistency of quality is a commitment by 20th Century Fox.  You may want to think about buying ""Jesse James"" if you are a true film buff but if you still want another Tyrone Power classic for your DVD collection, remember you will probably have to remove ALL color and enjoy it in b&w.",1173398400,17,2105,4.535620052770448
634135,2,6303393985,"I was expecting rich, vibrant Fox Technicolor, on a par with ""Drums Along the Mohawk"", and I could have dealt with some flicker and with modest print damage, but right from the opening scene, it was clear that this film had not been restored, that the Technicolor strips were damaged, and that the colors were off (and almost non-existent at times).  As a result, I found it difficult to concentrate on the film; I kept thinking of how bad it looked and how much better it might have looked had the money been put into some sort of restoration.  I've grown to have so much confidence in these Fox classics, and this is my first major letdown, so I'm hoping ""The Return of Frank James"" will turn out alright (though I was so disappointed with ""Jesse"" that I've toyed with the idea of returning ""Frank"").

Anyhow, sadly, I have to advise against getting this unless you don't care about the picture quality --- if PQ matters to you, you are bound to be disappointed.",1173225600,40,964,4.528735632183908

I was very disappointed to find that the dvd edition has very poor color.  There's an overall dark tone and bluish cast to ""Jesse James"".  On the other hand, ""The Return Of Frank James"" has great color.  I tried these dvd's on 3 players just to be sure that my player or tv weren't out-of-balance.  If you love the wonderful Technicolor films of this period, stick to the vhs edition of ""Jesse James"" or be prepared to turn your color button up as high as it will go to enjoy the dvd version.  One would expect more from a major studio like Fox.",1173139200,16,670,4.228346456692913

Follow the adventures of the James boys as they are almost forced to attack the evil railroads and the robber barons that ran them.

(the registered trademark of the AHA) began to monitor the use of animals in film production more than 60 years ago, after a blindfolded horse was forced to leap to its death from the top of a cliff for a shot in the film Jesse James (1939). Needless to say, the atrocious act kills the whole entertainment aspect of this film for me. I suppose one could say that at least the horse didn't die in vain, since it was the beginning of the public waking up to the callous and horrendous pain caused animals for the glory of movie making, but I can't help but feel that if the poor animal had a choice, this sure wouldn't have been the path he would have taken!",1151971200,5,765,4.394366197183099

You may find it entertaining, but don't come away from it thinking you've learned anything useful about the James boys.

634140,4,6303393985,"A real life legend of the Old West comes to life in this 1939 film, which may not be historically accurate or honest enough for purists, but nevertheless tells a good story while leaving any moral judgments up to the audience.  ""Jesse James,"" directed by Henry King, stars Tyrone Power as the man heralded by some as the Robin Hood of cowboys.  Whether or not he was actually a hero is debatable, and what this movie does is supply the motivation for the wrong-doing on Jesse's part-- at least up to a point.  At the time this film was made, it was necessary for the filmmaker to present a story like this in a way that reflected a reckoning of sorts for a character engaged in any form of moral turpitude; and this film is no exception.  But in this case, it's done with subtlety, and in a way that still allows the viewer's sympathies to be with the protagonist, regardless of his crimes.
 At the heart of the matter is basically another version of the oft-told David and Goliath tale.  In this story, Goliath is the railroad, expanding ever-westward and growing bigger and stronger by the day.  When they encounter the farm on which Jesse, his brother, Frank (Henry Fonda) and their mother (Jane Darwell) reside and make their living, the railroad does what any self-respecting conglomerate would do-- they take it, pay the owners a pittance and lay their rail without giving it another thought.  Only this time, the railroad messed with the wrong people.  Not one to take it lying down, Jesse forms a gang-- which includes Frank-- and strikes back in the only way he knows how:  By robbing the trains.  And, just as Bonnie and Clyde would become, in a sense, local heroes a few years later, many began looking up to James as something of a redeemer; the man who stood up for all the others who were either unwilling or unable to do it for themselves after being wronged, as well, by the ruthless machinery of progress.
 Power gives an outstanding performance as Jesse James, to whom he brings an intensity that seethes beneath his rugged good looks and determined attitude.  Like Beatty did with Clyde, Power makes Jesse an outlaw you can't help but like, and actually admire.  Because the James Power presents is nothing more nor less than a good man seeking reparation for the injury visited not only upon himself, but upon his family, to whom he feels justice is now due.  It's a very credible and believable portrayal, though under close scrutiny his Jesse may come across as somewhat idealistically unflawed.  Then again, within the time frame of this story, we are seeing a man adamant and single-minded of purpose, and the depth Power brings to the character more than accounts for what may be construed as a flawless nature.
 As Frank James, Henry Fonda presents a man perhaps more laid-back than his brother, but every bit as volatile and adamant in his quest for justice.  There's a coolness in his eyes and in his manner that belies the tenacity of his character.  Fonda conveys the sense that Frank is a lion; he's no trouble without provocation, but once aroused he will demand satisfaction and stay with the scent until he has it.  And it's that sense of dogged determination that Fonda and Power bring to their respective characters that makes them so engaging and accessible.  Goliath is the real bad guy here, and you want to see him fall; and these are the guys you want to see bring him down.
 In a supporting role, John Carradine gives a noteworthy performance as Jesse's own personal Judas, Bob Ford, a man who made history by demonstrating that there is, indeed, no honor among thieves.  Carradine brings Ford to life in a sly and sinister way that leaves no doubt as to who the real villain of the story is.
 The supporting cast includes Nancy Kelly (Zee), Randolph Scott (Will), Slim Summerville (Jailer), Brian Donlevy (Barshee), Donald Meek (McCoy), Charles Tannen (Charlie Ford), Claire Du Brey (Mrs. Ford) and Henry Hull, in an energetic and memorable performance as Major Rufus Cobb.  Compared to many of the westerns made in the past couple of decades or so, this film is rather antiseptic in it's presentation; that is to say it lacks the graphic visuals of say, ""The Wild Bunch"" or Eastwood's ""Unforgiven.""  But ""Jesse James"" is satisfying entertainment that doesn't require or rely upon shocking realism to tell the story, but rather the talent and finesse of a great cast and a savvy director.  It's a movie that will keep you involved, and Power and Fonda make it an especially enriching cinematic experience.  In a very classic sense, this is the magic of the movies.",1007769600,24,4607,4.696517412935323
634141,5,6303393985,"For sheer gusto, excitement and action, it's hard to beat this classic western which unfolds the legendary saga of the notorious James boys. Tyrone is sympathetic, dashing and utterly charming as Jesse who lives on his mother's farm with his slow, deliberate, dependable brother Frank (Fonda). Director Henry King gives the film his special brand of zest and the acting of both Brian Donlevy and Jane Darwell is superb. More Hollywood than real-life for sure, nevertheless Power proved he could really act in this one; before he was just a beautiful matinee idol for the women to swoon over. Here he appealed to the menfolk as well as he successfully captured the good and evil which existed in one of America's most enigmatic men; Fonda was so good as brother Frank that Fox cast in the sequel RETURN OF FRANK JAMES; this film made the not-so-young (34) Henry Fonda a star.

634319,4,6303393985,"This more than eighty year old color film is still enjoyable to watch as long as we overlook that the story in the film is not even close to history or even myth and overlook the belittled portrayal of a black man. Tyrone Power plays Jesse, Henry Fonda is Frank, and Randolph Scott is the marshal that goes after Jesse and falls in love with his wife and tries to help Jesse. Lon Chaney, Jr. has a very small part as part of the James gang.
 Jesse is portrayed in the film as a hero to the locals and as essentially a good man who was made to do what he did because of the way the railroad people acted toward him and killed his mom. Randolph Scott tries to help him by securing a promise from the railroad that Jesse will only need to stay in jail for about two or three years, but the railroad reneges on the deal and try to hang him.

I first saw this film on a small B&W television when I was eleven years old and it made a huge impression on me - it gave me an overwhelming and unfounded empathy with Jesse James as an historical figure, which took several years to correct. Historically, it is far from the truth. But as a piece of mythmaking, and with Nunnally Johnson's well-crafted script and Tyrone Power's good looks, it worked.
Watching it 45 years later, and 75 years after it was made, it holds up well if you can overlook the flaws of the era. Some parts, like Henry Fonda's naturalistic depiction of Frank James, and the  cinematography, hold up perfectly. I recommend it if you like classic movies, and I recommend the BluRay version.

634387,5,6303393985,"This brilliant movie illustrates eminently a brutal chapter in Western socio-economic history: the creation of the iron horse, the transcontinental railroad.
One of Americas greatest novelists called it The Octopus. It strangled without mercy the farmers with its multiple sucker-bearing arms. In Frank Norris novel, the strangulation happened through highly exaggerated prices for the transportation of farm products; in other words, an extortion by a monopoly. In this movie, the railroad owners try to force the farmers to sell their land for a pittance by lying (the government will give you nothing) or by naked violence. They need new land for extensions of their railroad grid.
One of the families which resist the violent extortion is the James household (Frank, Jesse and their mother). When their house is destroyed by arson and their mother is killed, the brothers take the law in their own hands and seek revenge by robbing the railroad clients, the passengers.

This movie shows a lawless and corrupt country, where the power lies in the hands of the moneymen, who have friends in high places and who control the decision makers (the lawmakers and the judges).
On the other hand, at the end of the 19th century, the press (the media), here the Liberty Weekly Gazette, was still independent, and supported the farmers against blatant arbitrariness.

This is a superb movie, not only for its perfect depiction of a not so distant past, but also, for its still highly relevant themes, like socio-economic power, corrupt politics and freedom (of speech).
Excellent direction by Henry King with an outstanding cast (T. Power, H. Fonda, R. Scott).

634474,4,6303393985,"This dramatic western tells the ""true"" story of how Jesse James went from a young farmer to outlaw.  I use the word ""true"" hesitantly as there is little historical accuracy, by all accounts, past the character's names.  Putting that aside, director Henry King and an uncredited Irving Cummings have presented a pretty darn good western.

In this story (screenplay by Nunnally Johnson), Jesse (Tyrone Power) and brother Frank (Henry Fonda) are young farmers in Missouri.  Living with their mother (Jane Darwell), their property is in the way of the evil railroad and those that work for it.  In what was probably true, the railroad men and a skunk named Barshee (Brian Donlevy) have been arm-twisting the land owners to sell their property to the railroad for well below market prices.  The James boys and mom want no part of it.  When Barshee and his trio of henchmen decide to start twisting Frank's arm, Barshee gets his butt kicked.  When his back is turned, Frank is about to get wacked with a scythe by Barshee.  Jesse shows up just in time to shoot Barshee in the hand.

Barshee files charges and figuring they can't fight the railroad, the boys head for the hills.  This turns the boys into outlaws and in retribution for the mother's death, they decide to take it out on the railroad.  Their holdups are polite enough as they want no jewelry, just cash.  And as they depart, Jesse and Frank tell the victims to be sure to file a claim with the railroad.  They are obligated to reimburse passengers.

The townsfolk are sympathetic as well.  Especially the newspaper publisher, Maj. Cobb (Henry Hull) and his niece Zee (nicely played by Nancy Kelly).  Zee is also the girlfriend and soon to be wife of Jesse.  Randolph Scott plays Will Wright, a U. S. Marshal.  He's also on the boy's side, but has little to do but be a shoulder for Zee to lean on.  Will has a hankerin' for Zee, but she has eyes for nobody but Jesse.  John Carradine plays that ""dirty little coward, Bob Ford,"" who (spoiler alert) eventually guns down Jesse, shooting him in the back.

The acting and some terrific stunts involving horses make the film worth searching out.  Power was at the height of his hunky stardom, but Fonda steals all the scenes he's in.  Watch him in a confrontation with Jesse as Jesse is about to lose it.  Also there is a nifty scene when Jesse and Frank, surrounded in a failed bank robbery jump their horses through a store window.  There is another where horses and riders go flying off a cliff into the river.  Recommended.

The Blu ray transfer comes in 1080p resolution with a 1.37:1 aspect ratio.  The picture suffers a bit because of the age and the fact that technicians didn't have an original print.  Some of the colors may appear washed out, but I still found the picture highly watchable.  I would also add that there were no significant artifacts in the picture which looked nicely detailed and problem free.  You have the option of selecting a DTS-HD Master Audio mono track or 5.1 surround.  I opted for the 5.1 but aside from the musical score and some galloping horses, not much was going on in the surrounds.  Still, dialog was clear and properly located.  Extras are minimal with only a trailer, a Movietone clip featuring Ed Sullivan giving an award to Power and a 30 second clip of a premier in Connecticut (I think).",1388361600,4,3342,4.625850340136054
634535,5,6303393985,"Jesse James was a real favorite of mine. Sure he wasn't the Robin Hood myth made him out to be. But if movies interpetations like this were made illegal, Time Burton would have to be in jail. Tyrone Power, a very handsome  and imposing individual along with his more laid back brother Frank actually have a great script to work with.  I found some parts particularly funny, when he goes to get married and the preacher  goes off on the RR buying his land for peanuts the pastor says he was doing so well that  ""I had given up preaching and was making an honest living"". Now there is a foopah if ever there was one.
  Even more of a treat is Henry Hull as editor of the local newspapers, with his favorite line when on a tirade against a particular group, the Railroad or Lawyers and always ended the column with ""....put em up agin the wawhl and shoot em down lak dogs"" Henry Hull as you remember was the man who should have worn Chaney Jrs makeup  in ""Werewolf of London"", but want the heavy  covering so they compromised to where  his frontal face was showing with some minor touches and such. Also he was in ""Master of the World"" with Vincent Price. A great actor indeed was Henry Hull. And lets not forget John Carradine.
  I haven't seen the BluRay but I thought having seen the film I would put in a good word for it. If you want more historical then see Brad Pitts movie which is closer to history. This Jesse James is to the real bank robber as Houdini was to the magician and Man of a Thousand faces was to Chaney Sr. You know the history is just a skeleton to build a great story and they suceed

Now can we please have Return of Frank James, an even better movie imho for being a sequel, on BluRay so as to have a boxed set of both? So typical of studios to pull this crp .Yeah I bet you fans are saying don't hold your breathe. Well I won't hold my breath but will keep hoping.

Get this move, its about 11 dollars in the US don't be cheap. Im just waiting to add another film to hit the 25 buck no shipping charge area. People say it is better then the DVD which I never owned but seems the BluRay does make it look a little sweeter. My thanks to those who did mention the BluRays  +/-.

634537,4,6303393985,"Tyrone Power was at the height of his movie career when he took on the role of ""Jesse James""(1939). One of the most handsome leading men in cinema history, Power could act too. Acting was in his blood with both his father and mother being well known stage actors not to mention his grandfather. Darryl Zanuck must have been impressed too because he signed the young Tyrone to a long term contract with 20th Century Fox in 1936 and put him in some of their most important films such as ""In Old Chicago"", ""Rose of Washington Square"" and ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"". Although these last three films were in black and white, it wasn't until he made ""Jesse James"", his first Technicolor film for Fox, that his handsome movie star features were really put on display. You can see a lot of that in Fox's new Blu-ray presentation but probably not  what audiences saw when they first viewed the film in 1939. For those that don't know the story, in one of the dumbest housecleaning or corporate decisions in movie history, all of the original Technicolor negatives in the Fox vaults were destroyed and replaced with ""safety dupes"" in the early Seventies. And that's a shame because I would have loved to experience ""Jesse James"" in all it's Technicolor glory. However,this new Blu-ray presentation from Fox is the best we will get for now. It's not bad, just not as great as it could have been had the original Technicolor negative been used. It is however a vast improvement over the standard DVD from years back. Every frame in this new Blu ray from Fox has been cleaned up(no vertical lines, white specks, dirt, torn frames, etc.) and some of the close-up scenes are nearly pristine(Bitrate: 33.97). Flesh tones however vary throughout the film but for the most part this is another standout Blu-ray upgrade from Fox. You can make out individual colors such as the flowers that Nancy Kelly holds on the way to her wedding and also the green countryside and blue skies of Missouri(location filming was done in Pineville, Missouri). Historically, the movie is not very accurate(neither was ""Bonnie and Clyde"" or ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"") but it's very enjoyable and is one of my favorite westerns. This is one of three Technicolor films that Fox has released this year starring Tyrone Power and although it doesn't quite reach the heights of ""Blood and Sand"" Blu-ray wise, it certainly looks much better on Blu-ray than ""The Black Swan""(1942) which was released the same day. Although not a perfect Blu-ray, fans of Tyrone Power and Westerns in general shouldn't have any doubts about adding ""Jesse James"" to their Blu-ray library. ""Jesse James"" is 106 minutes(Aspect Ratio: 1.33.1) and contains the following subtitles: English SDH, Spanish, and French. Audio is as follows: English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1; English DTS-HD Master Audio 1.0; Spanish Dolby Digital 1.0 and French DTS 5.1. Special features include two Fox Movietone News shorts and the original theatrical trailer.

Another thing the film is famous, or infamous, for is the killing of a horse during a scene where Frank and Jesse pursued by a possee have to force their horses off a 70-foot bluff into a river (played by the Lake of the Ozarks).

634661,3,6303393985,"I have seen many westerns, hundreds actually, and this is one of the best from Hollywood's Golden Age.  There is very fine acting from all involved and many excellent special effects.  One almost feels sympathy for the James brothers while despising their targets.  It is no wonder why this movie was released in 1939, Hollywood's greatest year.  This alone makes it one of the more memorable westerns.

But, this movie does have some major flaws, most of which concern the historical accuracy of the story.  One major distortion is the portrayal of Jesse and Frank James as honest farmers whose hatred for the railroad drove them to become outlaws.  The fact is that the brothers were members of Quantrill's Raiders in the Civil War.  They were no strangers to stealing and killing.  Actually, they were already old pros at crime even before the war ended.

Another major distortion is the role of Bob and Charley Ford.  In the movie, the Fords are shown as having been members of the James Gang from the beginning.  The movie also portrays them as betraying the gang by informing the Northfield, Minnesota authorities of their arrival.  In truth, the Fords had no part in the Northfield disaster.  They did not join the gang until after the fact.

I don't understand why Hollywood has to embellish history to sell movie tickets.  Is the truth so boring that they have to resort to the practice?  I was a history major in college and can tell you that real history is far from dull.  It doesn't hurt to do the research.  Many great movies can be made from the facts and not fantasy.",1324857600,6,1583,4.670289855072464

Directed by Henry King

Irresistibly entertaining story of Jesse (Tyrone Power) and Frank James (Henry Fonda) becoming train and bank robbers to avenge the death of their mother killed at the behest of greedy railroad interests.

Director Henry King stages the action sequences in glorious outsize fashion, notably the famous bank-robbery scene in which Jesse rides his horse through a plate glass window. The scenes involving both James brothers are stolen hands-down by Henry Fonda, not so much because he was a better actor than Tyrone Power but because his character had all the best lines. Jesse James was filmed largely on location in Missouri.

Even though Randolph Scott is not the star here but he has a pivotal role as Marshall Will Wright, this would be the success to his lasting and legendary legacy.

Then came the sequel! The equally powerful The Return of Frank James (1940) - Henry Fonda back as Frank James in another Technicolor extravaganza (directed by Fritz Lang)

634663,5,6303393985,"Given that this was made in 1939, I was expecting a simple shoot-em-up with bad guys in black, etc.  Happily, I found this is a subtle story about Jesse James, when he starts out as a wronged farmer and ends up a hardened criminal who has betrayed just about everyone and shown a self-destructive streak.  He woos a lovely local girl, but essentially loses her as his transformation and the difficulties of life on the run make life together too difficult.  It is sad, believable in spite of the heavy doses of melodrama, and a superbly constructed story.  I loved cowboy films when growing up, but long ago lost interest in them, particularly after the advent of films like Little Big Man or Apache.  This film is so good I must now consider whether to start collecting westerns!

Warmly recommended.",1307577600,2,801,4.685714285714286
634664,5,6303393985,I wanted this movie for the fact that Randolph Scott stared in it & I needed it for my Randolph Scott Collection.  Randolph is all western & meant to be in western movies.  He is good at his trade in this Jesse James as all of his movies.,1292284800,,238,3.9375
634665,4,6303393985,"The first Technicolor western (released in January of 1939, three months before DODGE CITY), this big-budget, big-scale affair is loaded with talent: Tyrone Power and Henry Fonda as the outlaw brothers Jesse and Frank, Randolph Scott as sympathetic Marshall Will Wright, John Carradine as Jesse's eventual killer Bob Ford, Nancy Kelly as ""Zee"", Jesse's beloved, and Brian Donlevy as Barshee, the railroad purchasing agent who is the initial villain and the main impetus in the James brothers' turning towards a life of crime.

Or so it is in this Hollywood fantasy which has very, very little to do with the facts, such as they are known. Of course Hollywood westerns shouldn't be expected to take the place of history books even on the best days, but JESSE JAMES is a worse offender than most. The Civil War is barely mentioned in the film - the real James Gang were Confederate raiders and the lost cause was certainly an element in their turning to crime; the Younger gang is never identified as such, with the Northfield Minnesota raid being present as wholly a ""James Gang"" effort; Bob Ford, a man of 20 when he killed Jesse, is played by the middle-aged John Carradine and presented as a main member of the gang when in reality he was a new recruit overshadowed by his older brother Charlie (played by a much younger actor here). And so on. So historical accuracy is out the window here.

That out of the way - and really, the accuracy stuff in this case should only matter to historians, not viewers just going for a rousing western - the film is overall a success, though not a complete one. It's got some spectacular scenes - the first train robbery, with Jesse jumping from car to car as a mere silhouette against the setting sun, is just stunning, and the Northfield raid and chase afterwards (where a horse was killed in the filming, which helped to lead to the monitoring of films for animal cruelty that we have today) are pretty exciting. Scott and Fonda are pretty solid in their roles, and Donlevy does his usual villainy well; unfortunately Power in the central role just doesn't have a lot of gravity and just doesn't project a lot of personality.  Power of course became a star initially because of his looks, but he did end up doing some great serious work on occasion, most especially in the great noir&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nightmare-Alley/dp/B0007ZEO8C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nightmare Alley</a>&nbsp;a decade after this film.  He did take a while to develop though and wasn't always used well early on - this falls into the category of an ill fit, I think. And he isn't helped out by the screenplay's efforts to make him out to be an outright heroic figure at first, with a steady and fairly quick descent into something like madness. Jesse's motivations after the first revenge killing and the first couple of robberies just aren't clear or believable, and as the film revolves around him - with brother Frank and Scott's lawman as generally ineffective foils against his growing instability - it becomes rather hard to really care what's going on, especially given the inevitable outcome.

All in all, it's worth seeing for the color and most of the cast as I said are fine.  Added to the leads we have Henry Hull as Zee's uncle Rufus, a die-hard southern sympathizer and muckraking newspaper publisher who might provide a bit more than enough comic relief (though he's always fun when he's around), and Jane Darwell shows up for a couple of scenes at the beginning as the brothers' ill-fated mother. So I think this is a film that will probably appeal more to the ""classic Hollywood"" audience than the ""hardcore western"" crowd, despite Scott's appearance. It's certainly not the best western from 1939 by a long shot, but it's hardly the worst I've seen either. The following year's sequel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Return-of-Frank-James/dp/B000G6BLEM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Return of Frank James</a>, is just a tad better I think, with Fritz Lang's direction more than making up for the lack of Scott and Power.

DVD note:  As a couple of others have said, the color here isn't terrific, though I don't think it's bad enough to warrant downgrading my rating; it's hard to imagine at this point a better, remastered edition showing up anytime soon, and the film is certainly worth seeing for those interested in westerns of this period or fans of any of the stars.  Minimal extras include a couple of Movietone clips from 1939 showing the red carpet premiere, and Power getting a star of the year award.",1289088000,2,4650,5.012953367875648
634666,5,6303393985,"If you know me then you know that I'm not one initially drawn to the whole genre known as `The Western'.  Those dusty epics complete with stagy gunfights and sluggish southern drawls always tend to bore me to tears.  In recent years we've seen a resurgence of this long thought dead genre, and I must say that this has sparked an interest in me I didn't think possible.  With Andrew Dominik's 2007 masterpiece (yes, I said MASTERPIECE) peeking a renewed interest in the legendary criminal known as Jesse James, I was intrigued to see what this 1939 film had in store for me.

Surprisingly, it doesn't disappoint.

While it has an old-fashioned feel and definitely shows its Hollywood influence, there is something almost organically inviting about Henry King's biopic.  With expansive sets, finely tuned performances and a script that engages the audience in nearly every facet of James's life; `Jesse James' is an admirable attempt to humanize a man we all are dangerously curious about.

Factual or not (how many biopics are 100% factual anyways?), this film is certainly entertaining.

The film starts at the beginning of James's escapades, painting a sympathetic picture that involves a corrupt railroad company basically stealing property in order to expand their own interests.  When Jesse and his brother Frank put their feet down so-to-speak, they make enemies, powerful enemies that force them into hiding and eventually into a life of crime.  The film follows their lives, with the focus obviously on the life of Jesse, giving us a glimpse of him relationship with his girlfriend and eventual wife, Zee, as well as his relationships with certain key players in his life.  While the treatment of Jesse's nature may be glamorized and or sympathized a little too much here (there is a difference between humanizing and sugar-coating), there is no denying that the film carries a powerful and often commendably subtle message.  I think that alone makes up for any apparent embellishments; the surprising subtlety.  Instead of going for the obvious flashy `all show, no depth' approach that many genre films can go for, `Jesse James' shows remarkable depth of character.  It is really trying to build character here, as apposed to lining up a series of explosions and action sequences.  That effort is well rewarded, for the character development (not without a few snags) is seemingly effortless.

I have a small handful of complaints, but none of them are really worth harboring on.  I feel that Tyrone Power is perhaps too pretty to come off convincing as Jesse James (there isn't an edge needed to flesh out his darkside) but he works hard to deliver a charm needed to make him approachable.  Outside of Power, and a hammy (and clichd) Henry Hull (I know, he was entertaining but also very stereotypical) the performances here are rather outstanding, especially from the likes of Henry Fonda (I often label him a one-note, one-trick actor, but the subtle flourishes he delivered here were fantastic) and Nancy Kelly (such delicate ferocity).  Also, because I'm sure he doesn't get many shout outs, I'm going to throw a bone towards Ernest Whitman who played Pinkie.  There is a beautiful sincerity in his demeanor here.  In fact, he's every bit as convincing and heartfelt as the supporting actress winner that year; Hattie McDonald.

For me, `Jesse James' is a knockout and a film I will most certainly watch again.",1282780800,2,3425,4.992957746478873
634667,4,6303393985,"Jesse James might with some justification be called America's Robin Hood: throughout his life of active lawlessness, the people in his native region of Missouri protected him, hid him, helped him, lied for him, and worshipped him as a hero.  Many legends tell of the good deeds he did in return, including one very famous one about how he saved a widow's farm from foreclosure.  (Whether any of these tales are true is, of course, another question entirely.)  Certainly he did his deeds with impunity for over a decade and despite some close calls was never taken alive: it took a trusted member of his own gang to bring him down--by shooting him in the back.

This classic from 1939 (one of the best years in the history of film) scrambles history a bit (as was customary among movies of that era), but it retains the central idea of Jesse as a man more sinned against than sinning, while at the same time showing how (to quote the theme song from the much-later short-lived TV series about him) ""His killin' turned him cold, he grew bitter, he grew bold...""  Jesse (Tyrone Power) and his older brother Frank (Henry Fonda) are quietly working the farm of their widowed mother (Jane Darwell) when a man named Barshee (Brian Donleavy) and his cohorts, agents for the railroad planning to build into their area, comes along and tries to pressure them into selling their land for a lot less than it's worth.  The Jameses whip him and throw him out, then try to rally their neighbors to resist the road's bullying lawfully, but it already has the law pretty much sewn up, and Barshee gets himself deputized and leads a posse out to the farm to arrest the brothers.  Warned by Maj. Rufus Cobb (Henry Hull), the feisty publisher of the local newspaper, they escape, but Barshee won't believe they're gone and hurls a bomb into the house, killing Mrs. James.  At this Jesse kills Barshee in a barroom shootout and vows revenge against the railroad.  When his friend, Marshal Will Wright (Randolph Scott), gains its president's promise of ""minimal prosecution,"" he tries coming in, only to be betrayed.  Frank and his gang spring him, and Jesse, seeing that the die is cast, sets out to do as much damage as he can before someone ends his career.  Meanwhile, Cobb's niece Zee (Nancy Kelly), with whom Jesse grew up, has agreed to marry him before he can be sent away to serve his supposed minimum sentence, and the movie gives a lot of attention to her reactions as Jesse becomes harder and more suspicious with the passing years.  At last, wounded in a botched bank robbery, he makes his way back to her and vows that they'll go to California and start over again.  But fate has something else in its bag for Jesse.

There's a lot of erroneous information--or omitted fact--in the movie (Frank and Jesse both served in a Confederate guerrilla unit during the Civil War, which is never mentioned; they had a full sister, two stepfathers, and four half-sibs; Zee (yes, she existed) was really a cousin of Jesse's, and they had four children (not just one), of whom two survived infancy; and while the James house was indeed bombed by the forces of law and order, it happened toward the end of the James's career, not at the beginning, and Jesse's mother lost only an arm, not her life).  But Power and especially Fonda make their characters alive and sympathetic, as does Scott, and Hull is a delight as an old-fashioned country journalist whose editorials railing against everything from governors, lawyers, and railroad presidents to horse thieves and dentists always seem to be worded exactly the same (his typesetter can ""take a editorial"" more or less from memory).  Watch for a very young David Carradine as Bob Ford.  There's also some beautiful scenery that gives the very feel of early Missouri.  If you don't mind the inaccuracies and the compression of time, it's a full-blooded and very enjoyable film.

Fortunately, the strong opening sequences showing evil, ruthless railroad men pressuring helpless farmers like the James family to sell their land because they were standing in the way of progress support strong movie themes of sympathy and revenge that have you going along with Frank and Jessie to the end.",1206230400,,769,5.062992125984252
634761,4,6303393985,"1939 is considered by many critics and film conniseurs to be the most definitive year for films. some of the greatest films ever produced were released in 1939. the list is myriad, and for westerns this film is definitely included in that list.

even though this is a somewhat fictionalized account of the exploits of the James boys (Frank and Jesse), some of the events depicted are true. however, more fiction is depicted here than truth making this only entertaining western fare; but what entertainment it is. the story is so expertly told that it compels the viewer to become inevitable advocates for the James brothers cause. truly great filmmaking.

as for the DVD, to some degree i must debunk the reviews regarding the alleged poor transfer of this film to DVD. please do not allow those negative reviews to deter you from purchasing this film if it is of interest to you. several factors must be considered before criticizing a film. primarily, it's age. i realize that some films even older than this one are no less than pristine in their transfer. however, one must remember, in many of those films the original video and audio elements were still present or at least restorable. this film is nearly 70 years old and comprehensively a very good transfer with only a few scenes lacking in brilliance. it's not pristine or flawless but still worth owning. i believe some reviewers just expect too much.",1204502400,4,1413,4.810699588477366
634762,4,6303393985,"Splendid in his first Western and his first Technicolor movie, Power portrayed Jesse James as a sympathetic hero and the most charming bank robber of the Old West...

Teamed with Henry Fonda, and stalwart Randolph Scott, Henry King came with a Western classic, considered as one the best Jesse James of the series...

The film opens in Pineville with hothead Jesse and temperate Frank as a couple of Missouri brothers who, embittered by the ruthless tactics of a railroad agent, got a warrant and had to skip out, hiding out until Major Rufus Cobb (Henry Hull) can get the governor to give them a fair trial ... But the railroad's got too much at stake to let two farmer boys bollix things up...

After they had thrown Barshee (Brian Donlevy), the brutal railroad representative off the farm of their widowed mother (Jane Darwell) when she refused to sign over her property, Jesse and Frank later learn that she had been killed by a bomb tossed into their home by Barshee himself... Jesse returns, shoots Barshee, and vows revenge on the railroad, with the complete sympathy of the Missouri populace...

Jesse's sweetheart, Zee and her uncle, publisher Major Rufus, are among the James' supporters, as is U. S. Marshal Will Wright (Scott), but he has a job to do and is forced to track down the two brothers...

Jesse and Frank have expanded their operation from merely harassing the St. Louis Midland with a series of holdups to robbing banks...

Pursuaded by railroad president McCoy (Donald Meek) to talk Jesse into surrendering, Wright extracts a written promise of a light sentence for the desperado... Zee then urges Jesse to give himself up following their wedding...

Of course, Henry King tries to show how Jesse hated the railroads and from that hate he presented a charismatic hero... But this hero was not going to last... The more luck he had, the worse he gets... It'll be his appetite for shooting and robbing until something happens to him...

He also shows a worried fiance keeping thinking of an outlaw all the time out there in the hills just going on and on to nowhere just trying to keep alive with everybody after him, wanting to kill him to get that money...

There's a scene near the end where Zee (Nancy Kelly) after delivering her baby is lying in bed with her creature, with the presence of the Marshal, so to speak, between herself and her uncle that suddenly made clear to me what the entire film was about... Her feelings as a woman: ""I'm so tired to care. This is the way it always is. We live like animals, scared animals. We move. We hide. We don't dare to go out... ""

Obviously she is a sensitive woman who exposes her being on screen without losing sight of reality... That's quite a great scene from King, and key in this great Western, as it's really all about her character, Zee Cobb, a struggling woman in love now a mother with a baby to take care of...

So please don't miss it!",1198972800,,2920,4.617760617760617

634764,3,6303393985,"After the Civil War the transcontinental railroads were built to link the West with the East. The film shows how railroad agents swindled people to sign over their land for a low price. If they didn't sell their land would be taken from them (eminent domain?). [The film omits the fact that the James brothers rode with William Quantrill's Raiders.] Jesse James calls for a meeting with the other farm owners. They will get a lawyer to defend them. But the railroad agents swear out a complaint and get deputized to eliminate the James problem. The film shows the bombing of the James home and the death of their mother. Jesse James takes revenge on the railroad agent, and becomes a wanted man. [St. Louis was pro-Union, the rural regions were mostly pro-Confederate.]

The St. Louis Midland Railroad is drawn by a classic 4-4-0 locomotive, but the coaches are more modern. A lone rider hops onto the last car and gets to halt the train. A gang robs the passengers in the coaches. [The James gang invented train robbery, but they never applied for a patent.] Civilization has brought lawyers to the county, and a newspaper owner rants against them. [In fact lawyers were among the earliest pioneers, they handled deeds, loans, and other legal work.] Jesse is warned about the path he's taken; killing and robbing will make him mean. Jesse marries Zerelda and surrenders to the US Marshal. But Jesse is double-crossed, the railroad owner gets martial law declared and a new judge will hang Jesse. Frank arranges to break Jesse out of jail. They are chased and throw out dollars that stops their pursuers so they can escape. Jesse and Zerelda are moving from town to town. [There is a hint as to Jesse's occupation.]

Jesse and Zerelda have a son. Zee returns to her home town. The governor offers an amnesty to anyone who will kill Jesse James, plus the reward. The planning for the Northfield bank job shows Jesse's mean streak. He is also taking too many risks. [This film creates the fiction that the Northfield bank got a warning so they prepared an ambush. The truth is that the well-armed citizens had no warning until somebody was shot by the bank.] The rapidly armed citizens greatly outnumbered the James gang and ended their robberies. Jesse James would never rob another bank. Bob Ford visited Jesse to tell about an easy bank job. The children's playing foretells the ending. [There is no mention of the Younger brothers.]",1182556800,2,2434,4.765402843601896
634765,5,6303393985,"......the first thing we gotta do is take all the lawyers and shoot 'em down like dogs!""

""Jesse James"" starring Tyrone Power and Henry Fonda has been a DVD on my short list of ""must-haves"" for a number of years.  And, it was worth the wait!  The audio and video quality, as well as the packaging are wonderful.  This is one of those special motion picture jewels from 1939 - It truly was a VERY GOOD year - the year many call the Golden Year of Hollywood.  But this movie has often been lost in the accolades heaped upon the others - ""The Wizard of OZ"", ""King Kong"", and ""Gone With the Wind"" - just to name a few.  The performances here are top notch, which is a given for the stars (Power & Fonda), but is reinforced by the incredible supporting cast, most notably including Randolph Scott, Brian Donlevy, Nancy Kelly and John Carradine (as the ""coward"" who shot Mr. Howard).  But the star among stars here is Henry Hull. The sheer fun of his tongue-in-cheek performance as the curmugeon newspaper editor, who is always chomping at the bit to dictate his next scathing editorial, should not be missed.  A must see for young and old alike - a classic that truly stands the test of time.",1180656000,4,1187,4.412844036697248
634766,4,6303393985,"The film Jesse James is a superb Hollywood story of the folklore view of Jesse James.  The transfer to DVD is sadly lacking in many respects.  Colors are not enhanced, it is too dark in many spots, and the images are doubled in some instances.  My VHS copy is better than the DVD.  But this movie still remains the best of the Jesse James movies, simply due to such fine actors as Tyrone Power and Henry Fonda.
