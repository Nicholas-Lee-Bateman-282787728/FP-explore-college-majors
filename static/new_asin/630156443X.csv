333883,5,630156443X,"A dynamite western -- a film noir, actually, with Stetson hats and horses -- featuring Dick Powell as a wisecracking, no nonsense government agent who's gone undercover in a crooked gambling town to find out who's been stealing shipments of gold, while bumping off Army soldiers as well.  A great script, with plenty of snappy dialogue and clever misdirection, as well some hard, gnarly action, and one really brutal fist fight.  I've rented this one on several occasions, and enjoyed watching it every time.  Highly recommended!",1055030400,15,529,5.127906976744186
333884,4,630156443X,"If Raymond Chandler had written shadowy sagebrush sagas, they undoubtedly would have been something like this RKO product. A lot like it. In fact, this is foremost a hard-boiled mystery, which just happens to be set in the Old West: Tough, wise-cracking detective battles two-fisted, gun-toting, hard-drinking lowlifes and crosses paths with shapely, duplicitous dame while investigating two murders.
But this time its the late-middle 1800's. The detective is an undercover military officer played by Dick Powell. The lowlifes wear spurs and shoot Winchesters. The dame is a crooked salloon owner and racketeer played by the lovely Jane Greer. And the murdered men were stagecoach drivers transporting gold. Raymond Burr and Burl Ives (!) are also featured.
Truly, this film boasts a proliferation of great one-liners and quips in a script co written by Frank Fenton (Out of the Past). And it's a good thing it does. Because otherwise it would be just average, and would more severely suffer the effects of its inadequate pacing and awkward structure. The mystery angle is only OK, there is insufficient momentum, and it seems a little longer than it is. Then, the plot is wrapped up in rather unimaginative fashion.
Still, while not reaching the inspired heights of The Big Sleep, it delivers solid entertainment of the kind they just don't make anymore. (Yet should.)
Bottom line: If pulpy dialogue is your movie-watching bag, Station West will definitely fit the bill. Otherwise, you may find this film uneven and somewhat frustrating.

- Haven: ""You gonna correct me or just bleed at the mouth?""

When two Army soldiers are murdered while escorting a gold shipment, a military intelligence officer is dispatched from Washington, D.C. to investigate. Rumored to be a demoted lieutenant, Haven (Dick Powell) strides into town seeking trouble, looking to stir things up. His aggressive conduct  soon has the townspeople eyeballing him, particularly that fine saloon chanteuse (Jane Greer) and her shady dandy companion Prince. Haven's sleuthing amounts to pretty much his poking at things until he gets a reaction. But it's not until he finagles himself into taking over the local stagecoach line - and loads it with gold - that he finally makes some real progress. But Haven sure makes a cranky piece of bait.

By 1948 Dick Powell had put to bed that lightweight ""boy crooner"" rep, steeped as he was by then in them meatier film noir roles. STATION WEST is a terrific, highly atmospheric hybrid picture. It combines noirish elements with the whodunit and the standard western. You glance at Powell and you don't immediately view him as a two-fisted action hero, but he handles his business here, slapping leather and getting down in the dirt in a sequence in which he engages in bruising fisticuffs with that giant bar bully. Powell, by this stage, negotiates the noirish landscape with perfect ease. He's got the tough talk down pat, and the required cynical demeanor. It helps that the screenplay by Frank Fenton and Winston Miller gives him great material to work with. The dialogue is sharp. In a script crammed with notable lines, my favorite is what our guy says when he observes that dandified dude watching Jane Greer's saloon canary: ""His eyes follow you around like a couple of flies."" Another exchange is Powell and Agnes Moorehead's character talking about an abrupt Army officer:

- Moorehead: ""I think he secretly likes you.""
- Powell: ""He's a man who can certainly keep a secret.""

STATION WEST is based on a story by western novelist Luke Short (whose stuff I should read more). But, really, the draw is that odd, fascinating convergence of noir and western sensibilities. Juxtaposing the saloon numbers and the cowboy shoot-'em-ups are the classic tropes of noir cinema: the disreputable dame and the world-weary gumshoe inhabiting a world of black and white... and shades of grey. Needless to say, the gumshoe lives by a tarnished (yet intact) code of honor. Jane Greer is a beautiful standout. Fresh off her playing the memorable femme fatale in one of the best noir films ever, OUT OF THE PAST, Jane Greer commands your attention, lovely and composed and very much a woman. The film's best character reveals involves her. Greer's nuanced performance allows you a glimpse to the emotional turbulence roiling just underneath her restrained exterior. Oh, man, she is fantastic. If that's not enough, Greer, who once had a career singing in big bands, gets to sing a number, ""Sometime, Remind Me To Tell You."" Co-star Burl Ives plays an amiable hotel clerk who moonlights as a check-in counter troubadour, a far cry from his Big Daddy role in CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF. He also gets to sing a tune. Raymond Burr doesn't sing but, as the nervous town lawyer, he does try to hem and haw his way out of iffy situations. You know who else doesn't sing? Yep, Powell. By 1948 he was all done with the warbling.",1375747200,3,3473,4.830252100840336
333890,5,630156443X,"A zingy whodunit with slick dialogue for a western (an usual blend of detective and six-gun).

333892,5,630156443X,I enjoyed this. I thought Raymond Burr was a little different in this movie.  Not a real bad guy as were usual in his early pictures. Good western. Liked the colorization.,1246233600,2,171,4.516129032258065
333893,1,630156443X,"Full Disclosure: This reviewer was quite disturbed from the very outset at the colorization of ""Station West"" and believes that films shot in black and white should stay that way!  Color/no color aside, SW simply did not work. This is the story:  Dick Powell rides into town with an overtly tough guy mien.  It develops that he is an undercover Army officer investigating a stagecoach stickup that killed two soldiers. Wouldn't that attitude blow his cover?  Due to the robbery, gold is piling up at the local Army post and Wells Fargo will not transport it. All the elements of a solid plot and good action movie are there.  Yet, SW falls flat.  Much of the action is poorly staged; viewers can plainly notice punches being pulled in brawls. The ""tough guys"" DP must contend with appear as cream puffs.  Perhaps the color makes them appear older and less foreboding than in b&w.  Even such a reliable early `50s black hat as Raymond Burr fails to impress.  The main bad guy is actually a girl, but the otherwise talented Jane Greer also does not register.  The resolution simply challenges credibility.  The bottom line is that ""Station West"" is a huge disappointment. It represents neither the West nor Dick Powell at their best. Perhaps Powell belongs in a suit as in ""Pitfall"" or ""Murder My Sweet"". Fuller disclosure: This reviewer requested SW as a Christmas present; it was duly delivered under the tree but his non-movie fan wife doesn't know her color from b&w, and her husband failed to specify. Those buying on their own should SPECIFY!  A final thought: Would we encourage attempts to colorize classics as ""Psycho"", ""Casablanca"", or ""The Third Man""? The same sentiments should prevail about ""Station West"".",1169856000,3,1717,4.86254295532646
333894,3,630156443X,"Station West is the story of a guy (Dick Powell) who goes to a western town to bring justice. Everytime a wealthy woman tries to move her gold, it gets stolen. Powell's job is to find out who is stealing it and bring them to justice. In the process he meets a crooked group including a beautiful woman (Jane Greer) who he needs to provide information.

The film is utterly forgettable but holds one's interest throughout. Nothing too exciting or notable happens; the events are standard for western films.

Powell is very good in his role as a tough good-guy. As a fan of Powell, I was able to ignore the western setting, but I would not recommend this film for those who don't like the genre.",1142985600,2,693,4.448818897637795

7812539,2,630156443X,"This poor rating is for the disappointing Warner Archive DVD R not for the film itself. Station West (RKO 1948) is a very good little film noir western. Unfortunately Warner Archive has used a cut print. While the original release print had a running time of 92 minutes Warner Archive must have used the cut rerelease print as the DVD R has a running time of 80 minutes only. So 12 (!) minutes are missing!  A lot of time for such a short movie. I was able to compare both versions as I still had the uncut version on VHS from the BBC in England. They had shown it on TV in England years ago.
I can tell you that a lot of important scenes are missing. Can not understand why Warner Archive has not used the uncut print which by the way was in a good condition. A shame!",1461456000,8,769,4.126666666666667
