8324173,3,B0000897AS,"I've watched Global Addiction many times. - This is a DVD with some 5-Star moments - and lots of 2-Star concerns.
Apparently the producers of these DVDs assume their is only One target generation who would be interested - the 20 year olds.
It's mostly that God-awful ear splitting noise - the call 'music'. - I'd at least like to have an alternative audio track - with just the bikes and or commentary - Without that 'music'.
There are scenes filmed by helicopter with moments - of multiple riders jumping right behind each other.
You have to know Who these riders are and their histories - cause this documentary Isn't going to tell you.
There are places too - like 'Cainsville' - and you'll just have to figure that out yourself - cause - again - this information is Not in
This documentary.
Also - part of the 'Zero-Stars' - a lot of 'Jackass' moments. - Where (again Unnamed people) total used cars - ride a motocross bike into the side of an old LTD. And other sickening moments - wasting time.
There is a chapter of 'Kevin Windham's house' - whomever he is - and where ever his house is.
Again - we're just supposed to 'Know' this. Scott M.",1454371200,,1146,4.436018957345971
