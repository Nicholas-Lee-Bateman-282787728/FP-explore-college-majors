7975768,5,B00007G1T8,"This is one of my top ten DVDs (there are 2 separate DVDs to complete all episodes). Yes, I have to hold my nose as Gene Autry sings some of his more ridiculous and twangy songs, but WOW, what a great idea for a movie serial... underground space men (and women), evil gangsters, great B&W western cinematography and cowboys (and cowkids) to the rescue.

I have watched various versions of this serial, (e.g., the movie ""RADIO RANCH,"" a movie cut out of the lengthier serial version), over the years but there's nothing like watching the whole thing. It takes hours to do so but you can go get a sandwich, let the video run, and come back to still figure out pretty much what happened.

The beauty of any of the old serials is the level of action -- back in the 40s and 50s, they originally only showed these serials at the theaters at a rate of 1/2 hour per week so they had to cram in a lot of fights and narrow escapes. So, when you sit down for this complete cliffhanger marathon, there's never a dull moment.

Yes, the plot is clearly ridiculous but it's nostalgic escapism at its very best. If you were born in the late 40s or early 50s and loved Roy Rogers' TV episodes, you'll savor this mad masterpiece of a cult serial 'till your dying day.

A steal at any price as far as I'm concerned!",1187395200,7,1296,4.299180327868853
7975769,5,B00007G1T8,This is a classic serial set in the same style as Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers. Definitely get it.,1154822400,2,98,4.2105263157894735
7975770,2,B00007G1T8,"There is also a two-tape VHS set of this serial put out by Passport Video, which is apparently a copy of the inferior DVD that has gotten such bad reviews here. Do not confuse this with the excellent VCI VHS set.",1124668800,13,212,4.195121951219512
7975771,3,B00007G1T8,"This review is strickly comparing this newly released 2 DVD set from ALPHA VIDEO to the 2 VHS set from VCI Home Video.
First ""The Phantom Empire"" (1935) starring Gene Autry the singing cowboy was the first Western/Sci-fi Saturday matinee action serial.  A very elaborate and fun story of an underground hidden empire of ""Murania"" lying 12000 feet below Gene Autry's ranch.  This is some fun stuff. 12 cliffhanging chapters originally produced by Mascot Pictures.  This preceded the later serials like Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers. The Phantom Empire runs for 216 minutes total is Black and White and is presented in Standard Format.
Compared:
Alpha Video 2 DVD set - This is a non-restored direct transfer DVD. The results are horrible, grainy, dark and some times blurry picture.  The sound is erractic and sometimes difficult to understand the dialog.  The worst thing is the chapters are incomplete. Each serial ending or beginning are chopped resulting in the absense of the cliffhanger thrill of the story.  If you must see this classic on DVD, Rent only!!!!!
VCI 2 VHS set -  This is ""The Phantom Empire"" as it was ment to be seen.  It is only VHS quality but so much better than the DVD set.  The sound is much better and ALL 12 CHAPTERS are complete and the cliffhanging thrill is there to drive you on to next chapter. This is a fun experience and maybe a purchase but definitely a rental!!!!
This 1935 serial is a one of a kind and if you are a Gene Autry fan this could be for you.  Enjoy.",1081123200,52,1500,4.605263157894737
7975772,1,B00007G1T8,I agree with the first reviewer. I was looking forward to watching this serial but the transfer to DVD is so poor that I gave up after the 2nd chapter.,1054080000,21,151,4.066666666666666
7975773,2,B00007G1T8,"Yes, I too have fond memories of this serial,but this is a poor quality transfer, inferior even to vhs copies I have come across in the past. 'Nuff said.",1049241600,12,153,4.310344827586207
