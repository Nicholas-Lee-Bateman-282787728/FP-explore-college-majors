This video painted a prettier picture of his life but glossed over his later problems with alcohol.  This documentary, along with the biography, will remind you of the genius lost and the poet remembered.",1313366400,,334,4.533333333333333
4483611,5,B004VN7RN0,"Absolutely wonderful, a realistic look at a difficult time and a complex artist. No punches pulled, no undo glory heaped, just an objective focus on the time and the man. So few know the contributions of Ochs, the scores of songs that still ring with relevance today, but those who do, have been waiting for this biography for a long, long time, and to have it come together so poignantly, so passionately, is a gift.

Tough times require tough people, and Phil was one of them... for a while. My son watched the video and commented about how much we really need this guy today. Phil must be smiling somewhere, I know I did.",1313020800,4,624,4.473684210526316
4483612,5,B004VN7RN0,"Many years ago Robert Aubrey Davis played the Phil Ochs song ""When I'm Gone"" on his radio show and it just floored me; it was and remains one of the most beautiful and moving songs I've ever heard. Despite that fact, I never really got into Ochs's music in a big way or listened to it the way I listened to so many other folk singers. The songs are witty, brilliant, tragic, and topical, but perhaps at some level just not as ""listenable"" or accessible to me. Nevertheless, I was really pleased to see that this documentary had been made, and that it is very worthwhile, if heartbreaking on many levels. Heartbreaking because the violence of the Vietnam War, the Pinochet coup in Chile, and all the political assassinations in this country during the 1960's come flooding back and one feels them through the filter of Ochs's moral outrage. Heartbreaking because despite (or because of) his courageous and compassionate heart, Ochs succumbed to the demons of alcoholism and mental illness. Heartbreaking because the nation and the world are still torn by war and bigotry, albeit progress has arguably been made on some fronts. But it's worth getting your heart broken out of respect for Ochs's memory; this is an important film for the history of the country and the history of folk music. I also was very interested to learn that Ochs had traveled to Chile and Africa and played world music way before that became a popular trend. If he had lived, he might well have reinvented himself and enjoyed a major comeback.",1312675200,2,1515,4.742424242424242
4483613,5,B004VN7RN0,"--------------------------------------------------------
""Phil Ochs: There But For Fortune""
--------------------------------------------------------
Of all the 'Sixties folkies, Phil Ochs was always my favorite -- his political songs were unmatched in their effectiveness and honesty, scathing and uncompromised, but uncompromised in the best possible way, largely due to Ochs' keen sense of humor and biting wit.  It's a shame that he wasn't able to sustain that same sense of balance in his own life, which was sadly ended by suicide in 1976, as the turbulence of the radical '60s counterculture gave way to the narcissism and cultural malaise of the '70s.  Ochs' fate wasn't entirely tied to the changing times -- as this movie makes amply clear, he was beset by a lifelong struggle with mental illness, a manic-depressive streak that led him to dream of stardom and to spiral into an alcohol-fueled depression when, after a decade of impressive labors, stardom failed to materialize.

I've read a couple of books about Ochs and his career, and knew where this story would lead, but somehow seeing it played out against an impressive array of archival photos and footage, as well as numerous contemporary interviews, was much more moving. Especially compelling are the interviews with his closest friends and allies, including Christopher Hitchens, Peter Yarrow, Pete Seeger, Sean Penn, Tom Hayden, and most importantly Ochs' family - his daughter Megan, his wife, his sister and his brother Michael Ochs, who struggled with some of the same personal issues, but became one of the most successful entrepreneurs of the '60s scene, as the owner of the Michael Ochs Archive, which owns the rights to innumerable pop-culture images. They all have had decades to sort through their feelings about Phil Ochs' life, his tragic final years and to make sense of his legacy. The pain is still there, including the old pains of dealing with a troubled, charismatic addict, but the affection they felt has also had time to settle, and the love they all felt for this vibrant, creative idealist is palpable in a way that a book simply cannot convey.

Equally compelling is the archival material -- Ochs has always been a figure on old LPs for me, a voice on the radio, a presence in music rather than film.  Seeing him singing at civil rights rallies, on TV shows, being interviewed or in old home movies is a powerful experience.  The brightness in his eyes, the hopefulness and earnest power, as well as his charisma and handsomeness -- it's very captivating. You get a strong sense for what a powerful sway he must have held over the folkie legions of the Greenwich Village scene.

I was also surprised to find how pivotal he was to the development and radicalization of the antiwar movement in the late '60s -- Ochs wasn't just a songwriting cheerleader, he was an activist and idea man, helping plan and organize major events such as the agitprop ""War Is Over"" demonstrations, and the doomed, decade-defining demonstrations at the 1968 Democratic Convention. When the Chilean coup of 1973 led to the murder of folk singer Victor Jara, it was Ochs who organized a memorial concert, an event that placed Chilean solidarity square in the middle of '70s left-liberal politics, and when Richard Nixon resigned, he came up with the idea of throwing a celebration party. But the contradictions of being an anti-establishment activist and also wanting to become a musical star placed him under huge pressures -- the film doesn't exactly break it all down (nor do the books) but those closest to him, particularly his brother, offer regretful insights into the emotions that tore Ochs apart. This film ably evokes the power and glory of Phil Ochs, as well as the times he struggled in, and the difference he made. I would love to see more footage, particularly uncut performances and longer clips from the talk shows and new programs, but for now, this is quite a moving portrait. Highly recommended!

4483614,4,B004VN7RN0,"""There But For Fortune"" does a good job of presenting the perimeters of Phil Ochs, a useful piece of film for neophytes and others who will enjoy some unseen footage. The ""problem"" with the piece is prioritizing the times in which Ochs lived rather than a more detailed view of the man himself. While Phil, and all other historical figures for that matter surely reflect the times of which they shape their legacies,this film spends more time, footage, and analysis of the times themselves, rather than the man. A deeper look into this enigmatic figure would have been more useful for those seeking answers and explanations. A film certainly worth viewing, but a lesser story than could have been presented.",1311897600,8,707,4.9
4483615,5,B004VN7RN0,"Thank you to the film maker and all of the friends and family members who at long last told the story of Phil Ochs.

Everything is here: wonderful footage of Greenwich Village in the sitxies; Phil's sister, wife, brother and daughter; the wonderful songs; archival footage of Chicago 1968, Bobby Kennedy, Martin Luther King, Victor Jara and more. The story is told clearly and powerfully and is appropriate for both old fans of Phil's and young people looking for the strong, clear, bold voice of a man who was not afraid to tell the truth. This film is at once history, entertainment and cautionary tale.",1311206400,7,605,4.761904761904762
4483616,5,B004VN7RN0,"Finally out on DVD, this is a terrific account of Phil's life. My only regret is that there are really no extras on the disc - it would be great to see outtakes from the interviews and better still the whole live performances which go to make up the numerous clips shown in the documentary. I don't think that there is much unreleased  studio material left at A&M or Elektra but there seems to be a wealth of live performances as shown tantalizingly in this movie and readily found on You Tube. It would be great if someone were to put together an archive release of his live work.",1311120000,12,581,4.330275229357798
4483617,5,B004VN7RN0,"I can only wonder what kinds of songs singer/songwriter (before that label was ever used) Phil Ochs would be writing today - or for the last 35 years - if he had not taken his own life, at age 35, in 1976. He was in Greenwich Village writing both protest songs and ballads BEFORE Bob Dylan arrived. For a short period they were ""competitors"" (at least in Ochs' eyes). I had the true please of seeing Ochs perform live twice in a small coffee house in Philadelphia and I was at Philly's Electric Factory when Ochs repeated his ""gold lame'"" show the night after what became known as the ""The Gunfight at Carnegie Hall"", an interesting even released by A&M on Lp. Ochs was a passionate and thoughtful man and yet he had to fight his own demons. But he wrote songs that are still sung today - ""Changes"", for instance - and many of the things Ochs wrote about  - war, corrupt politics - are still with us.

Years ago there was talk about a film bio of Ochs which was to star Sean Penn (who I think would be perfect). This project never got off the ground but - in 2010 - documentary filmmaker Kenneth Bowser crafted this documentary about Ochs' life and it received limited National distribution. Now that it is out on home video DVD, it should reach a wider audience. While I know Ochs fans - who followed his career - will want to see the film (and it's GREAT!), I hope a younger generation - those born since Ochs' death - will seek it out.

There is really not a lot of performance footage of Ochs out there and I'm surprised that Bowser could dig up this much. (It might help that Phil's younger brother Michael, who became his manager, runs Michael Ochs Archive - one of the largest licensed image collections in the world. Bowser got a lot of cooperation from those in the folk music community like Pete Seeger and Joan Baez and there are interview with the non-singing activists of the period like Tom Hayden and Paul Krassner. There are interviews with siblings Michael and Sunny; Ochs' widow Alice and only daughter Meegan.

I see this film as a ""living scrapbook"" It ends with ultra rare - and very sad - final footage of Ochs by a New York filmmaker. The film runs 98 minutes and you'll wish there were more. There are excerpts of Ochs performing over 40 of his own songs. Sadly the DVD's only extras are the two-minute ""trailer"". It's wishful thinking, but I'd loved to see the outtakes of the interviews.

Watch this film and share it with your children. They need to know who Phil Ochs was, and what he stood for. And thank you Ken Bowser, for keeping his name alive and to First Run Features for making it available fist in theaters and now on home DVD.

This film, far better than an earlier transmission on TV screens, contains insightful and revealing interviews with his many friends and members of his family. This gives us a real insight on the short but inspirational career of Phil Ochs but also clarifies for us the tragedy of his accelerating illness and premature death. Phil Ochs loved his country - he was a true patriot and he hated at times seeing the direction in which it was heading, in particular the senselessness of the Vietnamese War and the pitiful attitudes of some of the southern states. The film is a cleverly constructed documentary with many illustrations of his greatest music and how sad it is today some 37 years after his death that very little has changed and if anything, things have got worse - maybe listening to ""Cops of the World"" puts it all in perspective.

4483628,4,B004VN7RN0,"I agree that this is a fine DVD about a fine person. My quibbles are  these: too many short snappy sound bites (one-liners from his close friends/colleagues), butted together with other one-liners to make some point - rather than in-depth interviews (more than, like 10 seconds, I mean). Second quibble - when I see Extras listed in the menu - in a DVD like this which I think has some gravitas - I don't want just these: a text biog of the director (a mere 20 lines) + a few photos (just ten - all of Ochs) + 4 trailers of other movies. Come on!!! My expectations are: longer interviews with the main characters; longer (like, at least one full-length) videos of an Ochs performance; and some out-takes, surprise stuff, related interviews (Dylan?!?) that couldn't be used due to time constraints. Oh, and a commentary track. Very, very disappointing in that regard. Even so, I'll give it 4 stars because, as a Brit, I learned some things.",1350432000,6,939,4.622754491017964
4483629,5,B004VN7RN0,"As Billy Bragg has stated, ""Phil Ochs is what Bob Dylan should have been"". I knew Phil Ochs and he remains the forgotten rebel, the forgotten balladeer. Of all the song writers of the sixties, he personified not just what was going on but also the rage. And, yet, he could laugh at himself and all the politics and politicians, including liberals, around him. He could also mourn for a president with whom he did not always agree. To this day, ""That was the President and that was the Man"" remains the best song written after the death of President John F. Kennedy. He had his demons, as we all have, but in the case of Phil, I always think of Tennessee Williams' reaction to psychotherapy: ""If you take away my demons, you'll also take away my angels"". Everyone who thinks they know the sixties should have this documentary in their collection and then they should buy every CD, or better yet, every piece of vinyl he ever did. When you hear them, you'll know the real Phil Ochs. And, someday, if the state of Texas doesn't rewrite all the history books, he will be right up there with Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger and his sometime fried and rival, Bob Dylan.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mama-Says-When-A-Wolf-Is-Chasing-You-Throw-Him-A-Biscuit-But-Don-t-Stop-To-Bake-Him-A-Cake-Mama-Says-L-A-C-Communications-by-Valdemi-Maria-L-published-by-LAC-Communications-Inc-Hardcover/dp/B0091KI5NE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mama Says...When A Wolf Is Chasing You, Throw Him A Biscuit But Don't Stop To Bake Him A Cake (Mama Says...

4483630,5,B004VN7RN0,"Phil Ochs was a folk singer and songwriter who got his start in the early 1960's and is best known for his anti-war and pro-civil rights songs.  That in itself does not distinguish him; there were many folk singers who sang topical political songs in the 1960's.  What does stand out, however, is that he was easily one of the most talented songwriters to come out of that era and style, challenging many of the best known folk artists with lyrics of topical beauty and potency.

I first became aware of Phil Ochs a few years after his death.  I have always preferred lyrics of substance to popular songs and love songs.  The first time I heard him, I was struck by the anger of his words, which were coolly contrasted by his soothing voice and plaintive guitar.  Phil Ochs saw himself as someone who could make a difference and his pointed lyrics were always directed where he thought they could do the most good.  Of particular power were the songs he wrote about racial injustice.  When N.A.A.C.P activist Medgar Evers was assassinated, Ochs responded with Too Many Martyrs, a song which not only wrung all the possible emotion out of this tragedy, it powerfully skewered the killer's brutality with all the anger and rage appropriate to such a cowardly crime.  ""While we waited for the future for freedom through the land, the country gained a killer and the country lost a man.""  This song alone would be a remarkable legacy if it was the only hard-hitting, angry and perfectly placed lyric he ever wrote.  But it was just one of dozens of songs that Phil Ochs wrote that seemed to single-handedly take on all the injustices of a generation.  The eloquence of his lyrics, the rage at the status-quo, and the utter absurdity of many of the incidents he wrote about came together to form a perfect commentary on an imperfect world.

This Documentary covers multiple aspects of Phil Ochs' life and legacy.  There were more than a few facts of which I was not previously aware, and the circumstances of his suicide are finally clearer and easier to accept.  The film contains many voiceovers by the artist himself, a device which at times makes it sound like he is narrating his own life story.  I always knew that Ochs wanted to be ""popular"" and that the popularity he sought eluded him for the most part, even while he left behind an important body of politically charged work.  I was not aware of his deep but surreptitious rivalry with Bob Dylan, or that the two were close friends.  While some of his songs seem relevant only to the turbulent sixties, a remarkable number of his lyrics are still capable of stirring deep emotions, even more than forty years after he recorded them.  There But For Fortune, Changes, and the eerily prophetic When I'm Gone are songs I have listened to hundreds of times over the past thirty-five years, and I never tire of them.  As for the songs that were ripped from then-current headlines four decades ago, I often find that it's comforting to listen to Too Many Martyrs, Here's To the State of Mississippi, Santo Domingo or Is Anybody Here and know that somebody gave a damn.  That somebody was Phil Ochs and his music will continue to live as long as we remember these struggles and face new ones.

As an entertainment, a commentary on the life of Phil Ochs, or as a history of the changing times of the sixties, I cannot recommend the documentary Phil Ochs: There But For Fortune heartily enough.  I thought I knew the man through his music, but there was much, much more to his story than I was able to glean from his music alone, and this film covers much of it.

It appears that the soundtrack for the film is now out of print.  That's a shame, as it contains a lovely acoustic version of No More Songs that I have been unable to find anywhere else.  I am hoping that eventually I can pick up a used copy of the CD at a reasonable price.

Anyone who is familiar with Phil Ochs music but not his life needs to see this film.  If you are unfamiliar with his music, viewing the film will be an amazing experience.  The documentary includes commentary by Sean Penn, Joan Baez, Judy Henske, Christopher Hitchens and many more.  And to anyone who wants to know more about his wonderful music, I suggest you start with the Elektra CD with the same name as this film (There But For Fortune).  In the meanwhile, I leave you with but one verse of There But For Fortune; you decide if his lyrics will reach you or not.

Show me the alley, show me the train
Show me the hobo who sleeps out in the rain
And I'll show you a young man with many reasons why
There but for fortune may go you or I...

As a singer/guitarist, I have performed many of Phil's songs over the years (still do ""Small Circle Of Friends"").  What I find truly sad is that so few younger folk music aficionados know his name.  Perhaps this film will help rectify that.

All this said, anyone who wants a more detailed, comprehensive and explicit account (albeit often heart-wrenching) of Phil's life from childhood onward, should seek out a book I believe to now be out of print by Michael Schumacher (No. Not the famous car driver) entitled ""There But for Fortune: The Life Of Phil Ochs"".  Try eBay, try used book stores or garage sales, but try!  This book will allow to live Phil Ochs' turbulent childhood, his days in New York's Greenwich Village and relationships with the likes of Bob Dylan, Dave Van Ronk and others.  It will let you experience his slide into what can only be seen as a mental illness exacerbated by excessive alcohol use, and perhaps begin to understand his ultimate death by suicide.

Throughout the book you will grow to know and love Phil Ochs.  You will want to cry out, ""No, Phil. Don't do it!"" on more than one occasion and be advised, you will cry.  You will cry for the loss of his songwriting, you will cry for the loss of his humor and voice, you will cry for the loss of his genius and, finally, you will cry for the loss of the man and for the manner of his death.  In retrospect, a preventable tragedy.

If you do find the book, share it with others, as I have done, after you read it.  In the meanwhile, view and enjoy this wonderful documentary as a celebration of Phil Ochs' life and music.  With apologies to Dylan, at least Phil will remain in our minds as Forever Young.  Thank you, Phil, for what you have left us.",1329350400,7,1990,4.458563535911602

As I watched this documentary, I fell in love with Phil. He was so willing to help any cause he believed in by showing up & singing his songs.
His prolific songwriting put him in the company of other great singers/songwriters. He protested the war with Pete Seeger, Joan Baez, & many others. Unfortunately, several leaders, like John & Bobby Kennedy & Martin Luther KIng were tragically killed which were each a big blow, knocking down Phil Ochs & sent him into a depression. He got up & but then was knocked down by the next tragedy. I was so sad to see the depression get the better of him. When he lost ""his beautiful voice, he was devastated. There's no doubt though that the time he was in the flow, he gave the world some excellent songs, ""Changes"" being one of the best melodies ever written. I cried when the world lost this ray of hope.
His influence on me was tangible. I haven't lost hope that we can make a difference by speaking out against the injustices that surround us.

I will say, however, for the benefit of those (like me) who actually saw the film in theaters (I saw it twice) and were expecting there to be substantial additional footage (that's what the director said after one of the showings), there is nothing, just some still photos.  I'm guessing it was a rights/cost issue, he said that it cost something like $50,000 just for the very short clip of Phil from the David Frost show.  I know they have hours more material, he said so, in particular clips of whole songs (it's hard to fit that into a 2-hour documentary, given Phil's very large ouevre).  So I was disappointed that none of it made it onto the dvd.  But that in no way detracts from what is on the dvd.  I pre-ordered it on Amazon and do not regret it.",1324598400,4,1483,4.305755395683454
4483638,5,B004VN7RN0,"For anyone who may or may not be familiar with the wonderful work of Phil Ochs, this dvd is enlightening in a number of ways. Firstly, for those not familiar, it will give you a glimpse into the wonderful music of this troubador who wrote about the times he lived in. I would not refer to him as a folkie, but for the times, he got caught in it a bit. You will learn of the extreme violence in the early-mid 60s of which Phil wrote and sang: the civil race riots, the harm done to the farm worker or coal minor, the violence that erupted during the Vietnam war inside America throughout the universities across the country. You'll learn of the horror that was the National Democratic convention in 1968, when mayor Daley authorized his police force to use whatever means possible to eradicate what had been peaceful demonstrations. Imagine college students being shot down! It was a lot to write about and Phil wrote it all. His sweet voice can be heard throughout the sometimes disturbing images, but he did what he did and I feel this dvd captures the essence of Phil. Thanks in large part go to his brother Michael, sister Sonny, daughter Meegan and others, of course. This is a great dvd to watch, whether you're a music person or interested in that volatile time in history (like today).",1319328000,3,1292,4.5256410256410255
4483639,5,B004VN7RN0,"If you were active in the 60's protests against VietNam war, this film brings that time and consciousness back full power, breaking your heart at how our country has since devolved.
If you are younger, perhaps Occupying Wallstreet, you'll get a taste of the music which is even more pertinent now than when written by this great song writer. He is sorely missed, yet ever present in his music.
The documentary is comprehensive in its coverage of Phil Ochs and the times in
which he lived. Should not be missed by either generation, or anyone in between.....",1318896000,2,557,4.752577319587629

This was done truthfully and tastefully with the contributions of many family and friends, it pulls no punches.",1315785600,,310,4.43859649122807
4483641,5,B004VN7RN0,"Kenneth Browser's film has been crying out to be made, the real story of how the Greenwich Village folk music scene gave birth to the 60s US Antiwar Movement. And how was it done? The simple answer is through Phil Ochs' eyes not Bob Dylan who drops out (and cops out ) after Martin Luther Kings famous 'I have a dream' movie sequence. In so doing, it poses unanswered questions of Phil's problematic relationship with Dylan who, as Christopher Hitchens said 'Anyone could (and did) like Dylan'

Phil Ochs' independent outlook shows when a John Wayne / James Dean movie fan gets politicised at university he remained a closet patriot and also the most scathing critic of his country's shortcomings, never turning down a benefit gig. Phil's public idealism comes over as real in his capacity for friendships, a prime example being his friendship with and admiration for the Chilean folksinger Victor Jara and went on to traumatise his friends when Phil's character unravels in his final year in his John Train alternate manic persona.

Phil's independent outlook is exemplified where the rest of the folk scene turned to rock, so he went classical, where as his brother Michael points out that Phil was the first to pick up on world music with the African song ""Bwatwe"" and his willingness to go out on a limb with his Elvis gold  suit / rock and roll revival, a year or so before Don McLean's Buddy Holly tribute in 'American Pie' made it fashionable.

Tom Hayden's clear eyed politics framed the innocence and positivism of the early 60s as opposed to the brutal kickbacks later on, none more severe as the brutal police riots at the '68 Chicago Democratic convention both broke Phil's heart after nine years of political activism yet he didn't go down without a long struggle, example being his organising the folk music rally naming the CIA as being at the back of the Chilean military coup and likewise organising the celebration of the end of the Vietnamese War

What lifts this film from past tragedy to today's inspiration is Mojo Nixon pointing out the updateability of Phil's songs as in the 'I cheered when Humphrey / Clinton/ Obama got chosen"" from out of 'Love me, I'm a Liberal  (and there are many more songs than this). Likewise Phil's daughter Meegan Ochs (complete her familiar clear eyed look and facial features) has the final say in pointing out how ecstatic Phil would be to see his songs surviving but less pleased that the causes which inspired his songs had still not yet been won.",1315612800,3,2504,4.744827586206896
4483642,5,B004VN7RN0,"An extremely good film on a short but outstanding career.

I did not want it to end and felt there were many people not interviewed such a Tom Paxton, Rambling Jack etc.

The latter part of Phils life and his illness was passed over somewhat quickly.

No mention of the Rolling Thunder Revue.

An outstanding DVD which is and will be very important tounderstanding that period of contemprary folk music and American politics
Buy it!",1314921600,2,432,4.72
4483643,5,B004VN7RN0,"This is a wonderful evocation of the life and times of Phil Ochs, a warm and poignant tribute by people who quite obviously cared deeply about him and understood what he was about. The extensive footage of Phil in interview and performance allows you to look into his eyes and I believe see inside him. I believe you can see among other things his pain, his lack of confidence and his humanity. I've long searched for a copy of the film 'Chords of Fame' which came out some years ago and bits of which I detected in 'There but for fortune'. Hopefully this film will encourage someone to re-release it.

I hope this film brings alive to new generations what  we were trying to do then, I hope new generations will use the songs as inspirations for current and new struggles and the lessons of where we have so far failed, to make their efforts more effective and ultimately to succeed in creating a better society.

' He sang them for a reason...why not sing them for the same....' I am eternally grateful to Phil Ochs and now to the people who made this record of his life and work. Thank you so very much.",1314748800,2,1106,4.385365853658537
4483644,5,B004VN7RN0,"This is an excellent overview of the life and times of Phil Ochs, from his early days in the Village until his sad, untimely, demise due to depression and alcoholism in the mid 1970s.  Plenty of quality footage of Ochs performing and in interview.  And contributions from family; friends; actors and musicians; and from political activists that were around back in the day.  As usual, no contribution from Dylan though, which is disappointing as they were friends and fellow musicians.  Dylan seems to have written Ochs out of his history - maybe appreciating his uncompromising stance.  Anyway, whether you're a fan, have heard the name 'Ochs' in the passing and are curious, or simply have an interest in the politics of 1960s America, this is for you. On the technical side, the DVD will play on any relatively modern TV and multi-region DVD player.",1314662400,2,852,4.888888888888889
4483645,5,B004VN7RN0,"This is a comprehensive review of the life and music of Phil Ochs.  It can be a great introduction to anyone who knows nothing of Phil Ochs and a real insight to a life long admirer like me.  I first heard of Phil Ochs in the fall of 1968 and have bought all of his albums, first on vinyl then again on CD including the ""Broadside Tapes"" which are the very raw material he recorded when he first reached New York in 1962. Phil Ochs was, in my opinion, the best and most prolific protest writer/singer ever to hit the streets of the USA.  His lyrics were more succinct than Bob Dylan's and he was a far better singer.  With his knowledge of written music and orchestrations, he recorded some beautifully melodic songs full of subtle harmonies and words that struck deep into the psyche of the 1960's.  This programme should be used as part of the US History classes in our schools.",1314403200,2,880,4.374233128834356
4483646,5,B004VN7RN0,"Hi!  I used to listen to Phil Ochs ALOT when I was in college (expierimenting with new music).  He would not have been impressed with me, because I don't know much about the politics that were / are so much a part of his music..
What I think that like most about Phil, is the self assuredness in his voice, he believes in himself , in a clear right and wrong, and his music is very smart and clever (and that good strong voice...
I liked the DVD, because it was the people that knew him talking about his life...they do an excellent job of it..some of his fellow musicians, and a few famous fans included..It was really informative and neat..I won't try to spoil it for you by describing the stuff that they said..
I couldn't get the product link thing to work..but there is a Cassette / CD from the late 80's that is also called ""There But For Fortune""  It is one that I really enjoy.  I recomend buying his music, because he was quite a talent...",1313971200,2,948,4.25

8443676,5,B004VN7RN0,"There couldn't be a better or more complete review of Phil Ochs and his career.  Along with a fair amount of live performance clips, you have a very wide and inclusive series of comments from his family and closest friends.  There is an overall feeling of melancholy throughout, especially if you know how his life ended.  Although as prolific and skilled a songwriter as Bob Dylan, who Ochs greatly admired, you learn that Dylan never acknowledged Ochs as an equal and the two existed in a sort of Thomas Edison/Nikola Tesla relationship in their shared years on the public stage.  I hadn't known much about his world travels until watching this documentary and it's a fascinating segment as Ochs befriends a Chilean folk singer and, well before Paul Simon or Peter Gabriel, goes to Africa to blend his song stylings with African influences.  Sadly, it was while in Africa that Ochs suffered a mugging during which he was nearly strangled to death.  Though surviving, his vocal chords were irreparably injured and that seemed to be a turning point in his life.  He began drinking heavily and his family's history of mental illness finally caught up to him.  His end was tragic, given his boundless talents, but I think it can be said that posthumously he now receives the critical acclaim he seldom realized during his amazing life.",1445299200,2,1333,4.841409691629956

This documentary includes, some great songs and moments in the 60;s. as well as the bravery on his part for standing up for what he believed.
