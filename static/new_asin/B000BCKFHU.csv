2413995,5,B000BCKFHU,"After having this film recommended to me, i decided to check it out and was amazingly surprised. The director is absolutely terrific - pace, emotion, and payoff - he really is an expert storyteller.",1374019200,2,198,4.852941176470588
2413996,5,B000BCKFHU,Old movie with Chris Pine.  I kind of collect these hard to find videos.  He's great as Capt. Kirk.  Thanks.,1362614400,,108,4.3
2413997,4,B000BCKFHU,"This B-Movie gem is the first leading role for Chris Pine, and it may be his best role to date. Pine plays Luther, the ""bad"" kid at Catholic school who can get you anything you want. He is however caught and along with his roommate, he is quickly booted out of school. Luther becomes obsessed with finding out who turned him in and when he does, the boy mysterious turns up dead. At a similar time, someone confesses to Priest Michael Kelly, who now knows who and why, but can't say anything. As a result Kelly quickly becomes a suspect leading up to a tremendous finally. Pine, best known as the ""new"" Captain Kirk was just fantastic. It's a shame this is a B-Movie, because if it had been a major release, he would have gained the recognition he deserves a lot sooner. This film is tremendous, I saw it as a modern day Shakespearean tragedy. It has life, death, religion, intrigue, and much more. It's a great film that fell way under the radar!",1361577600,,947,4.417142857142857
2413998,4,B000BCKFHU,"It's hard to know sometimes whether you should root for Chris Pine here or not, but mostly not.  He commits a crime and then allows a priest to be blamed for it in a private Catholic prep school. A taut, tense story.",1352073600,2,216,4.142857142857143
2413999,3,B000BCKFHU,"After having been burned numerous times by purchasing movies with great reviews by movie critics, I now generally read what the public feels about the movie before I make a decision to purchase, or not purchase it. This was one of those movies that received OK reviews by the public, but nothing special. I took a chance and purchased it. I doubt that I will ever watch it again in the future. The story is fairly weak whereas the locations, color and sets are top quality. The movie certainly has its weak points in terms of the script. Examples are when one of the students is shot and no one goes to his rescue, even though a crowd is present and the killer has fled. The police do not disperse the crowd even though the shooter is still in the vicinity. While it is implied and somewhat shown that one of the characters is innocent of a past crime, I kept waiting for an explanation of what really happened and why the person would not talk about it.",1274054400,4,954,4.365168539325842
2414000,5,B000BCKFHU,"I recent this item in very good condition.

This story is set in a boys catholic boarding school.  Religion plays a big part in this story.  It focuses on how these boys are being brought up in a strict enviroment and the impact discipline when these boys do wrongful deeds.

Chris Pine the main character, sells pornographic materials and alcohol which he keeps stored in his suitcase from this bedroom.

One of his colleagues snitches on him and Chris Pine is hell bent on finding out who it was.  When he dose find out, Chris decides to teach him a lesson and chases through the school yard in the night.  The situation gets out of hand when accidently the culprit falls to his depth leaving Chris and his roommate to cover up the death.

Eventhough it was an accident, Chris Pine knows no-one will believe him.

An investigation follows where every student and members of staff are interviewed.

This was very entertaining.",1271289600,7,927,4.666666666666667
2414001,4,B000BCKFHU,"In a lot of ways, this movie is another 'bad kid in a private school movie.'  But, I think it is a cut above the others for three reasons.  First, it is quite realistic in its portrayal of the bad kid, Luther.  (Being a highly Catholic movie, I wonder if the name Luther has any significance!)  Second, it adds the element of utter secrecy of the Confessional for the priest.  Excommunication awaits any priest who breaks that secrecy.  Third, it brings up the element of the friend who witnessed the homicide, and his promise to not say anything.

Parents need to discuss with their kids just when it is appropriate to remain quiet, and when a promise of secrecy needs to be broken, and this is a good movie to show them to bring up the subject..  For Catholics, parents might wish to discuss with their kids what they should do if they need to confess something that will put the priest in such a quandary as this priest.  The sin may not implicate the priest himself, as in this film, but should they burden him under the protection of the Confessional with knowledge that could save another person great harm?  Also, one might ask if divine forgiveness can really be given by confession only, without rectifying the sin in reality.  (For example, would Confession of a bank robbery really be forgiven if one still kept the money?)  This movie brings up these issues in a compelling way that teens should be able to relate to and to discuss.",1154044800,6,1444,4.532818532818533
2414002,4,B000BCKFHU,The reviewers below are right. The actors are pretty good. But I must add that the message of this movie is pretty impressive: father Michael is concerned about Luther's salvation even when the boy tried to frame him and to kill him. THAT'S REAL LOVE! That's what priesthood is all about. Buy or rent this movie.,1141776000,3,312,4.589285714285714
2414003,4,B000BCKFHU,"Jonathan Myers makes an impressive film debut as writer/director of CONFESSION, a very well done film that unfortunately went direct to DVD.  Though the script is at times a bit clumsy and the control over the arch of emotion from the actors could be tighter, the film succeeds as a thriller, beautifully capturing the mysteries of the Catholic traditions.

In a private, expensive Catholic Prep School Luther Scott (Chris Pine) is a business minded renegade, supplying the student body with booze, porn movies, and other off limits paraphernalia.  His hesitant roommate Robbie (Lukas Behnken) assists him but on a turnkey night their partying dorm is visited by the headmaster Father Thomas Parker (Bruce Davison) with a potential rich Senator's student son:  the party is over.  The boys are all subjected to questioning as to the source of the contraband and one student informs on Luther and Robbie and in a fit of anger Luther pushes the student to his death while disguised/dressed as a priest.  Luther makes Robbie promise to keep their secret and Luther 'absolves' himself in the confessional where he admits his murderous act to the kind Father Michael Kelly (Cameron Daddo). Obeying the rules that words said in confessional must remain secret, Father Kelly becomes suspect as the perpetrator and elects to remain silent.  The manner in which Luther and Robbie cope with the arrest of an innocent man and the resolution of the crime provide the exciting if a bit predictable conclusion to the story.

The cast is variable but generally fine, especially Australian actor Cameron Daddo and young Chris Pine, allowing us to understand the rites of the Church without condescension.  The cinematography is moodily atmospheric and the musical score by Ryan Shore admixes ecclesiastic tones with contemporary mood music. Given that this is a first film for Myers it is one worth examining for the potential it carries. Grady Harp, February 06",1139788800,12,1946,5.09433962264151
2414004,4,B000BCKFHU,"CONFESSION is a surprisingly effective and entertaining suspense thriller.  The movie is set in the exclusive Catholic St. Michael's Prep School where handsome young student Chris Pine is selling drugs, booze and porn mags to obliging students.  When a fellow student turns him in, Pine and his roommate are expelled.  Chris plans revenge on the turncoat and suddenly finds a corpse on his hands.  Pine confesses his sin to friendly father Cameron Daddo knowing that the priest can't divulge what he hears in the confessional.  Soon evidence seems to point to the priest and Pine adds more fuel to the fire.

The movie examines the Catholic code of faith and features fine support from Bruce Davison and Tom Bosley.  Pine and Daddo are excellent in their roles, with Daddo especially convincing as the tormented priest who has his own dark past.  A well done and thought provoking film.",1138233600,3,886,4.9391891891891895
8085209,2,B000BCKFHU,"Confession (also released on DVD as Deadly Secrets in some regions), is a very formulaic bad dominant student does something, a good student his dormroomate got caught up in it, bad student bullies good student that they made a pact, and if he talks they'll both be facing the consequences. In this movie's case the two ambush and try and beat up a boy who they believe told on them for selling alcohol and Playboys, which has led to their expulsion from the religious boarding school they go to. Their ambush of course ends in death. Throw in the fact that the victim of the two students was confessing to narking on them where they ambushed him on the way back to the dorms after leaving the booth, means (in this movie) that the priest can't divulge who the probable suspects are to the police, since that would give away the deceased confession.  Since the bad student Luther (played by Chris Pine by the way) was dressed in priests robes so as to lure his panicking victim to him which was seen by a motorist, the real priest is now also a suspect.

The movie goes through the standard plot motions you know all too well from other films after this.  Confession doesn't do it as well as those other films though.  Plus it's pretty ridiculous you would get expelled, but still attend the school for the next ten days or whatever it was, which allowed the ambush to take place.  It's also one of those movies where police not responding to an emergency turn up on mass with sirens and lights.  Surely police going to arrest someone who has no idea it's going to happen, would do in a bit more of a subtle manner, especially since they've been coming on and off the campus continuously since the murder.

Really unless you're a Chris Pine or huge fan of one of the other actors in this and have to watch everything they've appeared in, I'd give it a miss.",1511222400,,1857,4.444117647058824

8085211,5,B000BCKFHU,I've liked everything Chris Pine has been in. I own a lot of his movies. He was so awesome as Jack Ryan so I thought I'd had to my collection & get a movie he made when he was much younger. I liked the movie. I also want to say something about momox they packed the disc well it came in in excellent condition considering it came from Germany & the disc played all the way thru with no problems. I'd gladly do biz with them again,1473033600,,429,3.942528735632184

8085213,1,B000BCKFHU,"Good overall plot that was sabotaged by bad acting, bad directing, and a non-believable script. Take a pass on this movie.",1470441600,,122,4.857142857142857
8085214,3,B000BCKFHU,It was a very crazy storyline. Had its moments of pure confusion & you just knew the characters were going to crack.,1459123200,,116,4.318181818181818
8085215,3,B000BCKFHU,"There are a number of clues that suggest that this film was set in the pre-vatican II era.  The prayers in Latin, communion rail in the church, during the mass the priest has his back to the people, etc and yet there were also a number of post Vatican II elements (confession face to face), modern cars etc.  This I find a big inconsistent, but these don't take away from the film as most people won't catch this.

However one element is more obvious and should be apparent.  A priest cannot reveal the contents of the confession but is not bound to keep secret that somebody was in the confession, which is where this movie is hinged.  Father Timothy lies about his time in the confession so as to keep the secret of the confession of the murder -- this isn't necessary.  In fact Father Timothy can convince the confessee to turn himself in to the authorities.  I suspect his own demons from what happened in his own life could be thought of as reason for this.

The last part that troubles me is the manner in which the detective comes to apprehend Father Timothy.  The detective had his own axe to grind apparently, but in so doing becomes indirectly tied to a death.  Had this been done more discretely, that would not have happened.

It was a good cast and it was nice to see Tom Bosley (Fr. Dowling Mysteries make an appearance -- otherwise I would have given it two stars because of the badly advised plot.",1431216000,,1413,4.416988416988417

8085218,1,B000BCKFHU,"First, let me say that I am no fan of the Roman Catholic Church, but even I have to admit that this film portrays the Catholic Church in an extremely negative and unfair manner. The priests who run the school are venal, stupid, and back-biting. The students have apparently learned their lessons well because they, too, are venal, stupid, and back-biting. Then there's the plot. (This is not a spoiler) If you can explain why a priest can say ""I took Joe's confession at 10:30"" and then must lie and claim he ""just closed up and went to his room"" when he actually heard John's confession at 10:40, I'll modify my opinion from ""total piece of garbage"" to just ""garbage"". Of course, you can't because there would be no movie if the priest had simply stated he had heard John's confession after he heard Joe's confession. The confessional seal only applies to what was said IN the confessional, not WHO confessed - which makes the whole premise of the movie bogus. Then, of course, there's the police detective who's out for priest's blood to avenge his prejudices against the Catholic Church. And, would someone please tell me why a male police detective wears eye makeup to work that makes him look like a drag queen? I was going to say, don't bother to watch this film unless you're sadistic and like wasting your life, but it may just be worth it to see the most far-fetched ending ever filmed. Maybe if Chris Pine had a few nude scenes it would have helped, but I doubt it.",1383091200,,1475,4.548872180451128
