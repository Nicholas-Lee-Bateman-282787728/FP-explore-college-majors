I bought this because I was invested in it not really knowing It's quality.  To my surprise, I thought the plot and the acting was good.  I enjoyed it.",1419638400,,274,4.018518518518518

8237442,4,B0010AEQ7C,"Quite a number of years ago, I think it was a Christmas special by Hallmark, we saw ""A Matter Of Principle"" starring Alan Arkin.  What a movie.  We loved it so much we bought several copies and gave some away to those we know would like it as a gift.  After a while it became more than just a gift.  We realized just what a 'teaching tool' the movie was... showing folks NOT to behave like Flagg, just on 'principle'.... and some folks really need to learn that lesson.  This latest movie, while not quite as good as the first, is still well worth watching and projects the 'Flagg Purdy' character out there even further.  Neither of these movies got much, if any, commentary (good or bad) or review.  I think you'll like this one just fine.",1359504000,2,741,4.364963503649635
8237443,3,B0010AEQ7C,"Ok flic... BUT, it is NOT a continuation of ""A Matter of Principal"".  Family is different and characters are different.  It could have been a much better movie if it had been done as a sequel.",1344470400,,192,4.305555555555555
8237444,5,B0010AEQ7C,This was a fun movie just as all of his movies of this vintage were. Good clean family fun movie.,1341273600,,97,3.9
8237445,3,B0010AEQ7C,"""Raising Flagg"" is a laid back, innocuous indie comedy about a cantankerous, attention-seeking old codger (delightfully played by Alan Arkin) and his run-ins with various members of his family and community.

Preferring the appreciative chuckle to the full-throated guffaw, writer/director Neil Miller gently ribs his small town folk without once resorting to condescension or caricature to get the laugh.  Arkin is nicely complemented by a cast of familiar and not-so-familiar faces (Austen Pendleton and Richard Kine being probably the most recognizable of the lot), while the Pacific Northwest setting provides a scenic backdrop for all the shenanigans.",1234742400,,656,5.752577319587629
8237446,5,B0010AEQ7C,"A wonderfully understated gem. I've been waiting a long time for this to be released for far to long. This Film I believe was actually made in 2003 and could not be released generally. Unfortunately by today's standards I'm not surprised. This is not for 2 minute attention spans & the shallow. It may be a bit slow moving but this is necessary to tell a genuine story with equal character development. Alan Arkin has always been one of my favorite actors as is Glenne Headly and others assembled here-far too many to list. Neal Miller has done a fine job. It appears to be shot & edited on video & it gives a very clean & uncluttered appearance .Neal & Nancy Miller's writing is right on the mark. Too often in Hollywood films these un-city like people are portrayed quite patronizing & insulting-not here. It shows their genuine wry outlook,humor & dignity. If you want to feel you've spent a little time with some good down-to-earth folk then this is for you-otherwise stay clear for you'd only get lost.",1205107200,2,1007,4.6
