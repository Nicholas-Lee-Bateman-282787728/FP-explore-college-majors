6155135,5,B00HDU9UOW,"i chose this 5 star rating, because i do like the cleveland show, and they are very funny.  i had all the series now, and they are very funny.  i know that some people don't like these series at all, and some people complained about the 3rd season of the cleveland show saying that it wasn't recorded right lol.  i haven't had any problems with these series at all.  i will let everyone know if i do have a problem with the 3rd series of the cleveland show :).  I'm sure it will be fine.",1392249600,,487,4.08421052631579
6155136,5,B00HDU9UOW,I brought for my wife for her first deployment. I found from my deployments that DVDs like this help to fill time and give you a small piece of home. On a boring day it will help you to pass time and give you a laugh.,1390780800,,217,3.739130434782609
6155137,4,B00HDU9UOW,"First things first...... I'm am totally shocked! After the, let's-face-it, overwhelmingly negative reception of The Cleveland Show Season 3's DVD-R release. It seemed Season 4 being released would never happen..... Boy was I wrong.

Season 4's release concludes The Cleveland Shows run of dvd releases. Season 4 itself is a reasonably decent season with a variety of episodes that include: the good, the average and the dam right silly.

Again, like Season 3, its on DVD-R. To this I say...... fine. To those who moan at this DVD-R situation, I say DONT BUY THE DVD THEN!!! I think its great that this now cancelled show is still getting a dvd release. Thankyou FOX! Thankyou Cleveland Show fans!",1389312000,3,696,4.94017094017094
6155138,5,B00HDU9UOW,Funny and Great Show.  It was a shame to see it get cancelled.  I wish it had lasted for more seasons.,1388966400,5,102,3.8095238095238093
6155139,5,B00HDU9UOW,omg I am soo happy you brought this to dvd. now please bring out the rest of the king of the hill seasons.,1388707200,4,106,3.652173913043478
6155140,5,B00HDU9UOW,"What people seem to be failing to realize is that if it weren't for these MOD releases we wouldn't be getting this on DVD at all. Despite how you feel about this season, the fact is that many like myself would be left high and dry with an incomplete collection if it weren't for these MOD releases. I for one would like to see more of this kind of practice from series that might not be a big seller on DVD, but still has an audience. King of the Hill is a prime example of a series that desperately needs to be completed in this fashion.",1388102400,17,538,4.084905660377358

6155147,5,B00HDU9UOW,"I LOVE you this show. Anything that has Seth Macfarlane's name on it is a hit. The humor is current and not just slap-stick, but also gets the imagination going.",1428796800,,161,4.4

6155151,5,B00HDU9UOW,"I love The Cleveland Show. If the producers came up with more story lines for American Dad and Family Guy, how come more was not done for this show? I think it should have ran more than four seasons; or at least just put additional story lines on dvd.  The interested people that liked the show would have bought the new dvds.",1422921600,,326,4.258064516129032

6155159,1,B00HDU9UOW,"I buy a lot of DVDs and Blu-Rays. I love movies, I love this show, as well as the other MacFarlane-Shows, and I have the all !

DVD-R is a massive slap in the face of fans like me ! Maybe this ist a good solution for niche products for a few hundred people, like an old movie almost nobody remembers.

But I can not accept a current, succesful series on inferior media like this. Charging the full price for this... it's just smelly icing on a disgusting cake.

I will not buy any DVD-R, if they do not publish a proper DVD-/BluRay-Set, so be it - I will wait.",1406764800,18,560,4.072727272727272

6155163,1,B00HDU9UOW,"The character Cleveland is not strong enough to have his own show. I enjoyed his character in Family Guy and found him very funny but it's OVERKILL and it tries to hard for a laugh. I've seen every episode giving it chance after chance but you can't force bad down someone's throat. It tries to hard to be like Family Guy and the writing is awful, the jokes fall flat each episode and it's what I've come to expect. I have given up on this flat spin off series of non carbonated grape soda. Don't see this series lasting to much longer.",1399248000,,536,4.264705882352941
6155164,4,B00HDU9UOW,This show steps up it's wit in every season. Almost as good as Family Guy but way better than American Dad,1399075200,,106,4.095238095238095

8631721,3,B00HDU9UOW,"The fourth and final installment of ""The Cleveland Show"".  It is more or less like the other seasons but the episode where Holt buys all his friends cemetery plots and Donna and Cleveland falling into an open grave together is probably not a coincidence that this season was on the fence at the time.",1460592000,,300,4.555555555555555
