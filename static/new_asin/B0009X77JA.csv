2332745,1,B0009X77JA,I have many firm tapes that are sculpting with weights.  I was looking forward to try one of there cardios.  I'm not cordinated enough to complete this workout after trying three times I mastered  70% the second time but find the jumpy moves to frustrating and unfoucsed on the step.,1137974400,4,283,4.62
2332746,1,B0009X77JA,"This DVD came with ""The TransFirmer"". I was really dissapointed with this one. It felt more like a dance video than anything else (and I hate dancing). They didn't use the step as much as I wanted, and there wasn't enough weight lifting. The moves were very complicated, I have never had trouble with a workout dvd before. I'd reccomend the other 2 DVD's that go with the trasfirmer, especially the one with the skinny blonde on the cover. There was a lot of weight lifting in that one if thats what you are looking for like me.",1137456000,3,528,4.3979591836734695
2332747,3,B0009X77JA,"This video will get the job done, however if you have a couple firm cardio videos, this one offers nothing new. It is especially suitable for beginners and intermediates. The time does fly as you are changing up moves all the time, but again, its pretty much same old,same old. I personally turn down the sound and listen to my own music which helps.",1135209600,6,350,4.484375
2332748,3,B0009X77JA,"if you have one of their cardio workouts, you have them all. This workout is ok,standard stuff,and I would just plain wait until its been around long enough to get cheaper if you have to have it. The instructor is good but how many different ways are there to do step aerobics?I could be a little prejudice as I never got any results from step aerobics except for sore knees...one of the Firms many signature cardio and sculpt dvd's would be a better buy-see my reviews!!!",1121299200,3,472,4.5
2332768,4,B0009X77JA,"While not one of my favorite ""The Firm"" workouts, you will work up a good sweat.
Total running time is 45 minutes, including an 8-minute warm-up, a 5-minute cool-down, and a 5-minute stretch.
This workout has varied choreography, but not difficult moves, requiring minimal cuing and easy learning.  You will alternate between lower-impact floor aerobics (this doesn't mean a lower heart rate), and higher impact stepping and high-stepping.  As always, there are beginner moves shown by a Firm instructor, and plenty of ways to increase your intensity by doing jumping moves or using heavier weights.
You will need an incline step, 3-lb weights to start, and a mat.",1423267200,,664,5.138888888888889
2332769,5,B0009X77JA,Love love this video !! I have used it for many years and Stephanie is a great instructor . Yes it is fast paced but once you get used to it you know what is coming next !!,1404691200,,172,3.5526315789473686
2332770,5,B0009X77JA,"I have a number of the Firm series workouts from the Fanny Lifter, Transfirmer and ""pink"" eras. This one makes my top 3 and might possibly be my top favorite. I really like Allie Del Rio, but Stephanie Corley is just awesome. Her queuing couldn't be better, she is constantly  telling you right and left, how close you are to the end of a set, when to hold on and make it good because this is the last time through, I love it. The choreography is traditional Firm, a little more involved and of course more step inspired than the Fanny Lifter series which is good, it's more interesting and fun. The cardio in this workout is high intensity and will get your heart pumping and your body sweating. The step moves, particularly the tall box step moves will literally kick your butt. When I first started doing this workout I was convinced Stephanie was the devil, oh it hurts! But then after you do it a few times you see your legs toning up like never before and you're like ""okay, yeah this works"". As with most of the Firm lifter and firmer workouts this one lets you start as a beginner and build your way up, as you progress you can pick and choose which moves to do at the advanced level until you're doing them all at that level, then you can increase your weights, if you get that far and still need a challenge I'd say put on some weighted gloves, that oughta do it esp. cause you're going to be moving your arms a lot during the cardio segments. Depending on how much of a beginner you are you may find the two tall box segments overly difficult, hard to keep up with or hard to keep up with and have good form. They don't specify this option, but you can always just use the 8"" portion of your step or the 6"" even until you are strong enough to move up to the next level. Finally, my only complaint and this is more a general complaint about the Transfirmer workouts than it is about this workout in particular is that using the incline for step/four limb aerobics doesn't seem to be very good for the knees and back. Mine always felt painful or out of whack after doing the incline moves, easy solution though just use either the 6"" or 8"" step on its own, flat, then you're fine, trust me that 8"" step will be high enough to challenge you. I wish that there were more Stephanie led workouts, but it doesn't seem like she did that many, good thing this one is so fun.",1404345600,3,2376,4.256637168141593
2332771,1,B0009X77JA,"I would not recommend this purchase.  This item came as a VHS tape, and it was not clearly stated that it was old.  I assumed it was a DVD and can not use the tape since I have not used an VHS player in over 10 years.",1398988800,,217,3.595744680851064
2332772,3,B0009X77JA,"This is for the advanced, high energy workout level. Lots of different motions, changes after about four repetitions, so it's best to become familiar with the routine before going full bore.",1382745600,,190,5.161290322580645
2332773,5,B0009X77JA,"I love the FIRM and I love the TRANSFIRMER Series, including the Jiggle Free Series which uses the TRANSFIRMER. This particular workout is always challenging and usually takes me a whole month to master (I have been yoyo dieting for years this years but am going to be dedicated) and even then I haven't really mastered it. CHALLENGING but I love it, thank God I'm at home and not in a studio LOL! Bottom line I love it even though it takes some time mastering, totally worth it !!!!",1373328000,,483,4.438202247191011
2332774,5,B0009X77JA,"Although this is not a new workout, it is new to me.  I have many, many FIRM workouts and I rotate through them.  I was ready for something new (cardio) and looked into this one. I don't have the TransFIRMer used in this workout, but I do have the Fanny Lifter, which is older and is actually currently being sold as the TransFIRMer.  (The TransFIRMer used in this workout is no longer produced, but you can probably find it on ebay or something if you feel you must have it.)  I watched a YouTube preview of this workout and I figured I could use my old Fanny Lifter.  It works just fine!  The only thing I don't have is an incline position, so when they work on the incline, I just use the 8"" portion of my Fanny Lifter. It's not all step ~ there is floor work, too, which adds variety and keeps it interesting.  The tall box climbs are killer, but I love them and they work!  I like the planks section at the end and I also do the bonus ab workout on the disc after I finish the main workout.  I love the way I feel after this workout ~ like I have worked out!  Stephanie is a great instructor.  She is likeable and she cues very well.  If you're looking for a good cardio workout and you have some kind of step to use, I highly recommend this DVD.",1365552000,8,1251,4.081967213114754
2332775,5,B0009X77JA,"The Transfirmer is not impossible to come by, but it's not a currently manufactured piece of equipment. I found mine on ebay. The Transfirmer DVD series (Ultimate Calorie Blaster, Aerobic Body Shaping, and Supercharged Sculpting) were like a gateway drug for me. I went from doing the occasional halfhearted elliptical workout to working out every day. The first time I tried Ultimate Calorie Blaster I was majorly intimidated. I felt like such a bonehead, always going the wrong direction and flailing around in an un-ladylike manner. After I'd mastered the other two DVDs and was ready for a challenge, I made it my mission to conquer this workout. With lots of patience, rewinding, and paying attention to what they are doing rather than saying, I finally got it. Once I got the hang of it, I was hooked on the nonstop intensity and the cardio glow I felt afterwards. It's one of my favorite high intensity workouts.",1362268800,,919,4.859872611464968
2332776,5,B0009X77JA,"I used to run into a woman at work in the breakroom all the time eating healthy looking salads and always had her hair in a ponytail. Anyone would notice how petite and toned she was as humble as she was in her appearance. I struck up a conversation with her and said that I noticed her healthy habits and wondered what else she did to stay so thin. She gave me a huge smile and couldn't tell me enough about how much she loved The FIRM and got up to workout at 5 am every morning. That was about 7 years ago. After that conversation, I did some research and realized that the FIRM studio/home base was in walking distance to my dorm at the University of South Carolina! What a coincidence. I had seen that sign at least 500 times during my time in Columbia, SC and it never even dawned on me that it was a workout studio.

Anyway, I immediately ordered the original transfirmer series...followed by one of the cardio series that came with weights and a band...and finally the WAVE. Yes, I have 3 different systems from The FIRM plus another one with the small ball that I found at ROSS that I've not got around to using yet because I'm SO HOOKED on the Ultimate Calorie Blaster workout! I agree that Stephanie H does an awesome job leading this workout.

I find it to be lots of fun, challenging and encouraging. I can literally feel myself slimming when I complete this workout and I'm completely drenched and dripping with sweat when it's over. I was a member at a gym for a couple of years and took many aeriobic classes and spent plenty of time on boring elyptical and treadmills but NONE of them gave me the burn and sweat that this workout does. That alone allowed me to keep my $40/month in my bank account without missing a beat. I LOVE this video and I do it often, mixing in some of my other 50+ workout videos from other popular video workout programs.

Getting started for beginners may be tricky for anyone who is not used to step aerobics, but the fact that the video series came with the transfirmer makes it SUPER EASY to pace yourself and get started. I totally recommend this workout to anyone who wants to avoid going to the gym. I turned a spare bedroom into my personal gym where I keep a mat, a tv and dvd /vCR, 3, 5 and 8lb dumb bells, a Total Gym, 2 workout balls, The FIRM WAVE and of course, my TRANSFIRMER!!!! If you're thinking of purchasing this video, GET IT! You will not regret it and your body will thank you for it. Stay consistent and YOU WILL SEE RESULTS IN 10 Workouts. The FIRM Ultimate Calorie Blaster makes working out at home 5 times a week a snap because we can all carve out 45 minutes to do what's good for us and makes us feel good about ourselves.

I can't say it enough. I LOVE the FIRM, I appreciate the opportunity to support a system that I didn't even realize was based out of my home state and the Ultimate Calorie Blaster is exactly that...an Ulitimate Calorie Blaster....2 final bonuses is that when I'm done, I know I that I've literally burned off the majority, if not all of the calories consumed during my last meal so I don't have to feel guilty about having a ""slightly"" larger portion size at lunch or dinnertime. I ""still"" stay within my caloric intake goals for the day so I can still lose or maintain my weight. What's better than getting to eat a little more?!!! Nothing! And I SLEEP LIKE A BABY and pop up early with tons of energy everytime I do this workout! I couldn't ask for more! AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME!!!!",1344124800,3,3482,4.327718223583461
2332777,5,B0009X77JA,"This video is long enough to feel like a complete cardio workout, and includes extra toning for legs worked right in. Having to stack and re-stack the transfirmer is a little bit annoying, but the leg work on the extra tall box is so effective, it's worth it. I like really long cardio videos, and if you do, too - get this one! Keep in mind that you need their special step-box thing.",1320969600,,385,4.287671232876712
2332788,5,B0009X77JA,"this workout is what i go to when i really want to push myself.  if i do this just as they call it with no beginner modifications, i am a noodle when i get finished.  it is as if i can see immediate results!  what is especially fabulous about this routine is how perfectly the music coordinates with her steps.  the routine is much more fun because of this aspect.  stephanie is encouraging and appears to be enjoying herself and does not make an error the entire routine.  i love the transfirmer because it offers a variety in the workout.  the length is perfect.",1288224000,,564,4.365384615384615
2332789,5,B0009X77JA,"This workout is challenging and comprehensive  - I am so surprised it didn't rate 5 stars. With the 8 minute bonus ab segment, it's totally complete. No question - you will get results.",1278028800,,185,4.606060606060606
2332790,4,B0009X77JA,"I have read a number of previous reviewers who claim they have trouble learning the steps and keeping up with Stephanie Huckabee.  Actually I like her much better than Allie DelRios. She is more real, acts more maturely, shows more enthusiasm and is far more motivating. I agree it takes a little time to learn the steps well enough to feel comfortable with the tape. However once you DO learn them you realize that their complexity just makes the tape more interesting. Personally I cannot do ""tall box climbs"" with the transfirmer stacked up one part upon another. It can be hard on your knees and makes it hard to really keep up. So, I unstack the parts and just use the higher one and the results are just as good. This tape is a GREAT workout for your legs, abdomen and gluteals. I really feel that I have worked them out when I am done. There are parts of the tape where you can literally ""dance"" yourself into fitness. You just have to concentrate and get yourself moving. For that it is really worthwhile.",1273622400,,1013,4.475675675675675
2332791,3,B0009X77JA,"As other reviewers have noted, the steps in this video are hard to figure out and difficult to keep up with. The instructor does not que well, a new move is done only a couple of times before they go on to the next, and there seems to be no true pattern to the moves as is the norm in the other videos in this series. But my biggest gripe is that she switches between queing from her own perspective and the viewers perspective. For example, she may say ""basic step up on the right""(meaning YOUR right foot) at one point and then the next time her cue of ""basic step up on the right"" matches HER right foot and not yours (which means she should have said ""basic step up on the LEFT""). Confusing and frustrating! The first time I tried this I gave up after the warm up. I have recently pulled it out of it's retirement in my collection and given it another chance. So far I've completed it all the way through about 4 times. There are certain parts I still don't have figured out, but I trudge through it anyway as best I can and keep my heart rate up. The slower steps using weights are easy to follow and excellent cardio work. The other two videos in this series are great though!",1271462400,,1182,4.18859649122807
2332792,5,B0009X77JA,"I have been using this video for several years.  It always gets my body back where I want it to be.  I love that I am doing Cardio and building muscle at the same time.  It does shape you in 10 or less workouts.  I enjoy Stephanie.  She has a calm voice.  It does take a while to pick up all the steps perfectly,  but it has to be challenging to be worth my time.",1266364800,3,363,3.76
2332793,2,B0009X77JA,"I'm not an aerobics instructor or a super step master but I usually don't have a problem following steps. This video, however, is just confusing.  I feel like I get my workout from jumping around trying to figure out what they're doing instead of doing the steps.  I'm sure these cues are universal but half the names she calls the steps don't seem to relate to the step at all so it doesn't help me remember what the step is.  Plus, there isn't enough repetition of the step for me to see what they're doing to get it down, especially when the camera is roaming around at all different angles.  I can't see when it does that!  This video transitions to different steps WAY too quickly and the camera doesn't stay on the lead for the 2 seconds she's doing that particular step so it's hard to pick up the move.  I feel like I'm repeating myself now but I'm getting frustrated with this video.",1263168000,,892,4.375757575757576
2332794,5,B0009X77JA,"This is my favorite Firm cardio workout.  I run through the cardio portion twice to get at least 45 minutes of aerobic exercise.  I got very frustrated at first because I'm super uncoordinated and it took awhile to get the moves down.  I still don't quite have the tick-tock down, but I know enough to enjoy it now.  I like the variety between step, low-impact, tall box climb and TransFirmer - keeps me from getting bored.  And her southern accent is adorable.",1259452800,,461,4.573170731707317
2332795,5,B0009X77JA,"This is one my favorite of the 'newer' Firms. Stephanie cues very well and the entire workout flows nicely from one sequence to the next. Heart rate remains elevated throughout, especially during the tall box climb. Weights are involved, but it definitely focuses more on aerobics. There are a few aerobic sequences on the floor, and a few fun and easy to learn routines on the step. I reach for this one when I am feeling energetic. It's fun!",1257206400,,443,4.620253164556962
2332796,5,B0009X77JA,"I tried this video once when I first got my TransFirmer and found it very fast and frustrating.  I then shelved it for about 8 months.  I just started using it again, and now it is one of my favorites.  It did take me about 4-5 sessions to get all of the moves.  She's not as good at cueing as some of the other instructors.  Unlike the videos with strength training moves where you have a bunch of reps to figure out the move and catch up, this cardio video goes really quickly so by the time you figure out something new, she's on to the next move.  But once you've figured it out, it is a great workout.  At 45 minutes, it is a great length, too.",1250294400,,649,4.0234375
2332797,3,B0009X77JA,"This video came with my TransFIRMer system. The first time I tried doing the video I got so frustrated because of the lack of specific instruction, the changing camera angles, and how quickly they changed moves. I don't think I made it through the warm up before taking the video out of my dvd player. At that time I thought I would never try it again. My first impression was that I hated this video.

After a few days I decided that I would give the video another try. The second time, since I knew what to expect in some areas, I didn't have such a horrible time. As the days progress I find that I like the video more. I work up a great sweat while doing it and really like the focus of cardio and light weights especially after heavy lifting the previous day. I will say though that some areas I still do not have down. If I am not completely focused I will miss a change in movement or what have you. The lack of clarity in the instructions is really a detriment to this video.

If they were to remake this video I have two suggestions for them. One, give more specific instructions and give a que as to when there will be a change in movements. And, two, it would be wise to do more reps of a single movement in the warm up phase. This way the viewer gets a better understanding of the movement and form before having to learn a new one.",1218844800,,1344,4.145593869731801
2332808,1,B0009X77JA,"I have a lot of Firm videos and this is the worst DVD I have ever done. Stephanie Huckabee is the absolute worst at cueing you for the next move and the transitions are horrible.  I have tried this DVD at least 5 times and it's so frustrating, I have decided to give it to goodwill. I do love the instructors Allie DelRio, Pam Meriwether, and Allison Davis.  Allie and Pam's DVDs with the Transformer series is awesome.  I also want to rave about Alison Davis's Boot Camp DVD. It is one of the best cardio/strength training DVDs I've ever done and doesn't get boring.  I'm also in awe at how graceful Alison moves throughout the DVD during all the moves.",1205107200,2,654,4.380165289256198
2332809,2,B0009X77JA,"I tried this DVD, since it came with the Transfirmer and found it very hard to follow in some of the step parts. The instructor changes the moves so quick, that by the time I learned the move she was already in the middle of another one. This is definitely not for the beginners. I've been using Firm workout DVDs for over a month and had a very hard time following the step moves. Just a bit too complex. On the positive side, I really liked the slower steps, I felt that they were easy to follow and I did get a good workout.",1203984000,,527,4.076923076923077
2332810,2,B0009X77JA,This video is just the same moves over and over again.  I actually got annoyed doing the video and fast forwarded through some of the repeating moves.  This is one of my least favorite videos from the Firm series.,1201305600,,213,4.435897435897436
2332811,5,B0009X77JA,"This took a bit of patience and practice for me to get these moves down but once I did I think it is so freakin awesome! I actually do this with a smile on my face which says a lot to me. I had to do it a few times without arms until I mastered the footwork then I threw in the arms as I could until eventually it just all came together. If you are like me and are not the most coordinated please, please, please stay with it because you will get it and trust me, even floudering around out of step you are still getting a good cardio session. I feel this is a little too hard for real beginners and those who get winded easily but try it without arms, follow the girl who shows what beginners should do and you can go even easier by lowering the step on the parts that use it. This truly lives up to its title. I highly recommend the entire transfirmer set/series. I am almost 41 and have suffered from neck, shoulder, back and hip pain for years and by breaking into this slowly but consistently I feel better and look better then ever. I had ups and downs along the way and it was not always easy and suffered some set backs but I kept moving forward and I am sooooooooooooooo happy I did. If I can do this?

2332815,5,B0009X77JA,"I have been doing Firm tapes for over 10 years and this one is great for obtaining an excellent cardio workout.  With all Firm videos, I use (hold) 1 pound walking hand weights (just handweights, not dumbbells) during cardio segments to give myself an extra push.  Not only does it boost my target heart rate but it definitely gives my arms more definition.  This video consists of half step aerobics and half floor aerobics which is a nice balance. You do use the transfirmer for two leg segments (the first one is without dumbbells and the second one is with dumbbells). The ending consists of excellent leg sculpting exercises (lunges).  I would say the whole workout is only 45-50 minutes which is perfect.  This is by far one of my favorites!  The only small complaint I have is the transition between each segment happens quickly, so you really don't have a free moment in between.",1172448000,,887,4.690322580645161

The workout flows smoothly from one segment to another, and does make some good use of the incline.  If you are an intermediate exerciser, this is a good one to use. I actually look forward to this workout, as it does push me (I would consider myself advanced), but is pleasant to do.  I find the constant change in moves challenging, and what keeps it from being boring.  I am a believer in The Firm Super Cardio, but it does get wearing after awhile, as you know what is coming.",1171929600,2,649,4.322314049586777

It's not hard enough exercise at all and impossible to keep up with. She changes moves every 2 seconds. The camera doesn't stay on anyone in a shot where you can try to follow the moves. I can almost swear I've even seen the other ladies in the video trip up a couple of times. And, I just find myself tripping over my own feet and unable to keep up. I would take jogging or kickboxing over this any day. Too much effort with not enough reward. I want to burn calories, not learn how to be the ultimate step aerobicizer.",1167091200,,632,3.984251968503937
2332829,5,B0009X77JA,"When I first attempted this dvd, I was new to the Transfirmer (or any of the Firm workouts) and any kind of step aerobics. I would get totally lost on the step segments. The fact that the camera was panning the set, made it about impossible to keep up. I set this one aside for a while and did the Jiggle Free Buns and Arms dvds instead. I also found a website that showed how to do some of the steps mentioned in the dvd. I started to catch onto the stepping lingo. After a month I thought I might be ready to give this one a try again. You have to pay attention to what she is saying, but once you know the steps, you can follow along without too much difficulty. The 45 minutes fly by and this has become my favorite cardio dvd - what was initially frustrating has become fun. I consider myself to be a fit, intermediate exerciser. I am drenched with sweat when I am done with this one, but it's not too hard. I've always been able to complete it.

I have been doing the Tranfirmer workouts for about 8 weeks now. I was in shape when I started it, but I have seen big changes in my body. They claim you will see differences in 10 workouts and I did. My legs and rear-end have never been firmer. My arms and shoulders are showing more definition. I will continue to stick with workouts from The Firm. I'm sold.",1166227200,3,1312,4.125
2332830,5,B0009X77JA,"I'm stunned by some of the reviews that said they didn't work up a sweat with this DVD.  I'm a regular exerciser and rotate an extensive library that's dominated by The Firm.  I used this one for the first time today and was able to keep up with most of the footwork and moves, probably because of having learned many of their earlier cardio routines that featured some of the same moves.  I was dripping by the time I got done and felt I got a good workout.

If you've managed to master Express Cardio, Body Sculpt Blaster and some of the earlier Firm videos with step routines, you probably won't find the choreography in this too difficult.  If you're a beginning to The Firm, be prepared for a learning curve, but it WILL get easier.  As is the case with many of The Firm routines, I have more trouble transitioning to one section to the other as they tend to use the Transfirmer like this, then that, then no Transfirmer, then on the incline, then to the side.  I get annoyed, but have to admit that their routines aren't boring and you often feel as if you've accomplished something when you can do them well.

I thought Stephanie Huckabee did a particularly good job of cueing this routine.  She's pleasant and encouraging without being annoying.  I also liked the approximately 45 minute length.

I have particularly enjoyed the Transfirmer Series.  It seems The Firm has stepped back slightly in terms of complexity of choreography(no pun intended) without making the routines boring.  I've found them challenging workouts with a few new moves and interesting without being maddeningly frustrating to learn.  Profuse cursing was involved when I learned Express Cardio.  I sometimes use my Transfirmer in lieu of the Fanny Lifter when I do some of the older routines, as the smaller size of the step box (I go so far back with The Firm that I have the original wooden steps) seems less stable after using the wider Transfirmer.

This routine is going into my regular rotation, as I thought it was a good workout and was enjoyable to do.  If you're looking for a cardio routine that keeps you and the time moving quickly, I recommend this.  Regulars of Firm cardio routines will recognize the steps and catch on quickly.  Newcomers to the Firm may experience a slightly longer learning curve, but I'd recommend this one before trying Express Cardio or Cardio Sculpt Blaster, among others.",1160179200,15,2395,4.700239808153477
2332831,3,B0009X77JA,"I have been doing the Firm BSS2 system for the last 6 - 8 weeks.  These DVDs include Maximum Cardio Burn with Allie Del Rio, Complete Aerobics & Weight Training with Emily Welsh, and Total Sculpt with Jennifer Carman.  I also purchased Tough Tape 2 because I felt I wasn't getting a good enough upper body workout with the BSS2 DVDs.  I felt I was ready to move on to new workouts and bought the Transfirmer Series.  The Ultimate Calorie Blaster with Stephanie Huckabee was the first DVD I tried.  I really work up a sweat with Allie's Maximum Cardio Burn, and it took me quite a awhile to get through it without stopping for air.  I was expecting the Ultimate Calorie Blaster to be similar in intensity, but I just didn't feel it.  I felt like I was wasting valuable workout time.  After the first few segments, I was hardly out of breath, and I hadn't even begun to sweat.  Stephanie incorporates some high-impact jumping, which I felt I needed to do to get my heart rate up, and I don't like to jump around because it makes my knees ache.  Now it could be that I need to give it a few times because I had a little trouble keeping up with some of the moves, but I have done step aerobics in the past and felt I kept up fairly well.  With other Firm workouts I have always started sweating right away even when I didn't know the moves yet.

I didn't care for the incline portion.  I felt that doing squats on the floor then rotating to do squats on the incline went way too fast.  I like to do squats more slowly to make sure I am using proper form.

This is an ok workout.  I might try it a few more times, but I don't want to lose the fitness I have gained from doing the BSS2 workouts.",1158969600,,1689,4.166666666666667
2332832,5,B0009X77JA,"I HATED this workout when I first tried it.  I had never done a FIRM brand workout before and I was unfamiliar with their moves.  They kept referring to the moves by names and switching quickly from one to the next and I was cursing them!  But I broke a good sweat attempting to keep up and tried it again several times until I mastered the moves.  Now it's a piece of cake and I enjoy the way the time flies by.  I bought the set that included the transfirmer step and three different videos.  This particular video has a nice blend of step, floor-based cardio, tall box climb, incline, and weights while managing to keep up your heartrate.  I've had a hard time finding videos that incorporate cardio and weights without slowing down your intensity, but this does a nice job of it.  As the video got easier for me, I've used heavier weights.  Just be careful and watch your steps on the tall box climb and incline moves.  I've tried several more FIRM videos, but this remains one of my favorites.",1152489600,3,998,4.404371584699454
2332833,3,B0009X77JA,"I love the new transfirmer and i love doing FIRM cardio work but this workout was not easy at all. If you are a beginner, watch this video a good 3 times before do this DVD because Stephanie goes way to fast and does not cue well in this DVD. Stephanie is one of my favorite FIRM instructors but she did not do well in this DVD. I am not overweight, just trying to tone up and i had a difficult time doing this. I got very frusterated but eventually got it down. This video IS fun but you need to work at it. At the end my favorite part is when Steph. leads your through a RELAXING cardio/stretch workout that really calms me down and relaxes me. Overall the DVD is fun and it works, just is hard.",1149206400,3,697,4.0215827338129495
2332834,4,B0009X77JA,"As a former aerobic instructor of 15 years, I am very particular about exercise videos in regards to the intensity, safety, variety and fun. This Firm video delivers on all fronts. It would be helpful to have a knowledge of Step aerobic commands, but with use, you will be up to speed on the ques, since the transitions are reasonably smooth and fun to do. I wouldn't recommend this for beginners, as it does have a fair amount of intense movements. It is good for people who want intensity without crunching their joints(as there are plenty of movements that are high intensity and low impact). As a mother of a toddler, with limited work out time, and a desire to be challenged, I love this video and would recommend it to any one intermediate level and above. It delivers in a short period of time (about 45 mins with an additional ab workout if you have time).",1144368000,7,864,4.509554140127388
2332835,4,B0009X77JA,"Ok - I've used this video once and while the choreography is CRAZY with tons of changes, I really feel like it will only be a couple of workouts until I get this one down like the other Firm videos in my collection.  In my opinion it is HARD to find a pretty straightforward cardio video that is not completely low-impact and doesn't tie in some strength training.  I do strength train with the heavy-lifting Firm videos but I know my muscles need to rest and this will definitely be perfect for the days between my strength workouts.  If you are new to complicated aerobics and especially if you're thinking about buying your first Firm video I would look elsewhere.  Great for the vets, though!  I also recommend Tighter Assets Cardio Blast with Tamilee Webb for a good, quick aerobic workout.",1144195200,3,795,4.609929078014185
2332836,2,B0009X77JA,I particularly didn't like the portion using the incline with fast paced steps.  It feels slightly dangerous and I kept worrying I was going to topple off the darn thing.  Love The Firm for weightlifting but I think I'll get my cardio elsewhere.,1140998400,3,245,4.674418604651163
2332837,5,B0009X77JA,"Although I really didn't like it at first. However that was due more to the camera work than anything else. It was difficult & frustrating figuring out where to put your body when the camera was panning around, or moving when it should stay put so you could get your feet where the should be. I had to repeat several of the sequences several times before I got the hang of where everything needed to be, making it a nice to watch but not too practical when you need to be sure of which foot is where.

That aside, once I got it, I really loved it.

Stephanie is very good,  I came to really like her cueing. Once I had the steps down more or less I just needed to listen to know what was coming next, and the workout flows, transitioning very nicely from one move to the next. Many of the basic moves, Firm users already know, but she 'adds power' and makes this a great workout. Great job, great work-out, this is a disciplined routine and not for the faint at heart. I'd recommend it for anyone who seriously likes to work up a sweat and feel they've pushed themselves.",1140307200,5,1071,4.240196078431373

You can use a regular multi-level step instead of the transfirmer.  As someone with back issues, my only complaint is that Stephanie's version of low impact has a lot of jumping.  I had to drop to the beginner moves in several sections to truly be low impact.",1471219200,,373,4.4411764705882355

I re-purchased several Firm dvd's and I'm so glad I did. Every workout is so much better than anything I ever did at the gym-either group classes or solo cardio on the treadmill/elliptical. Honestly, doing The Firm workout is like being in a class at the gym, but 100 times better! Ditch the gym and get The Firm!",1432771200,3,487,4.247311827956989

8069148,4,B0009X77JA,"This is the toughest of the three Firm workouts that I have.  Best calorie burning DVD I have at the moment.  I borrowed a friend's Insanity DVD, but that one wrecked my feet for a solid week.  So I healed up and came back to my Firm DVD's.  This workout by Stephanie never hurts my feet or knees and it is effective.

Stephanie cues well, but you have to really focus and pay attention to what she is saying.  (So it does take a bit of concentration, which can be difficult with two excited preschoolers running around me.)  Another problem for me was the degree of coordination that it requires.  I actually avoided this DVD at first, because it requires you to learn the moves, but after about six or so tries, I had the moves down (for the most part).

I would like this workout better if the first half were as difficult as the second.  The second half is a real challenge.  And now that I bought and tried a Jillian Michaels DVD, I appreciate my Firm DVD's all the more.  Jillian has good workouts, I think, but her attitudes and speech are just too crude for my young audience (preschool kids).",1427241600,2,1101,4.3431372549019605
