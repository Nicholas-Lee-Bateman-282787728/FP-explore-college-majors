Although this has an emphasis on band directors, I believe anyone that works with children - whether as a pediatrician, a classroom teacher, a social worker, a counselor, coach, just anyone - should watch this documentary.

7090560,5,B00VIPHMVQ,"Best documentary ever! I'm from south Louisiana and marched in the mighty Southern University Jaguar band, and we were worshipped as Gods in New Orleans because of the prestige afforded from marching in The Human Jukebox. Some of our youth work their whole lives to match just in Mardi Gras parades every year just to hope to get close to what I was privileged to do. I appreciate this film showing the truth of what New Orleans is and what music means to our city! Well done!",1444694400,4,476,4.482758620689655

7090564,5,B00VIPHMVQ,"I am a lover of great documentaries and this is the best of this year.

The high school marching bands of New Orleans take it all the way to a new level of greatness.  This is the culture, the reason d'etre, for an entire section of this great city.  These kids live for their chance to play in the marching bands, and be in the Mardi Gras parades.

See this remarkable film to understand exactly what this means to New Orleans. I loved and enjoyed every minute and am going to make my reservations for Mardi Gras again this year with a new appreciation for all the hard work and talent that goes into these bands.  If you've never seen the bands of Mardi Gras, see this film.  This is the winner of the best of 2015, and I have predicted the past two years best documentaries accurately.  This deserves to be in theaters.

The grand finale, of the whole set of bands playing at a funeral, gave me chills.  This is a must see.",1442188800,4,926,4.2457142857142856
7090565,5,B00VIPHMVQ,"First a note: Amazon combines reviews of all formats of a release (theater, Amazon Instant, DVD and Bluray) and posts them on all the format pages. I see many reviews of this film here  as  I post this  but most seem to be of the Amazon Instant Version. This is of the DVD which contains almost an extra hour of material. So on with my review:

Part Drumline, part Treme and part Mr. Hollands Opus, this 90 minute documentary by filmmakers Richard Barber and Andre Lambertson was filmed over a 3 year period (2007-2010) . When the filmmakers decided to follow the marching bands of three New Orleans schools, leading up to their participation in the Mardi Gras parade, they had no idea where the stories would take them and it was an interesting path. Because taking the journey with them is what makes this film captivating I will not reveal and of the outcomes but there are turns both positive and negative.

As the film progresses, Barber choose which of the (literally) hundreds of kids (both boys and girls; from ages seven to 18) to follow and visit their home and follow them on the street. A few of these kids have sorta-famous relatives. If you know Big Sams Funky Nation or the Hot 8 or Rebirth Brass Bands, youll recognize the names and learn where they came from. One young boy  known as Bear  who looks about 9 years old  will remind you of Trombone Shorty (Troy Andrews) in his personality and talent. And youll shed a tear when you hear the stories of the kids caught in the drug violence of the Crescent City.

If you are a fan of the TV series Treme, you will see the real world of music classes taught by actor Wendell Pierce. And you will see how the three band leaders are as much like fathers or big brothers to the kids in the band.

The physical DVD is worth getting because of the 10 extra scenes. One explains a second line, another presents two of the schools in competition and another gives a street performance of the Rebirth Bass Band. There is almost an hour of extra material here.

Barber (the director) and Lambertson (director of photography  which puts you right in the midst of the bands as they march and play) spent three years of their lives just filming this and then a large funding campaign to get it out there. I, for one, am so glad they did. And so glad that I discovered it. Watch it on DVD and then tell your friends. This is real life in New Orleans minority neighborhoods.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
