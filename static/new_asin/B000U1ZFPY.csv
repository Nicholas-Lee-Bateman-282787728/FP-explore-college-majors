8266188,2,B000U1ZFPY,"""Nicole"" was a disappointment.  The movie made little to no sense. If you're looking for a story line, forget it. I got the movie merely because Catherine Bach is in it, but she does not have the leading role, and does not appear in the film enough to please me.  She's probably not in it enough to please anyone.  Even just as far as a movie goes, it'll leave a bad taste in your mouth.  Don't waste your money, or time on it.",1283644800,2,427,4.108433734939759
8266189,2,B000U1ZFPY,"Check out TROMA. They redid this movie and named it CRAZED. Its on DVD and at a fair price. Its the same stars, the same movie. They only renamed it. Its got Catherine Bach who looks great but, the movie wasn't all that great. I thought it was rather dull. The video quality wasn't very good either. See the discription of this movie above and you will see that the discription of this movie says the same thing.",1238371200,2,412,4.294871794871795
