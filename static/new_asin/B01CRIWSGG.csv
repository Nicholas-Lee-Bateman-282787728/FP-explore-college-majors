7689033,5,B01CRIWSGG,Beautiful film. Touching and sad. Certainly worth watching more than once. The main actors are not only eye candy but talented. Wonderful. My only complaint was the music was so loud at times it was hard to hear the dialogue. Otherwise great.,1476748800,,242,4.785714285714286
7689034,5,B01CRIWSGG,"Best gay film  I've seen this year!  Not only does it show you the ugly side of drug addiction, bad parenting and bigotry.  But also the struggles gay men face with commitment, monogamy, adoption and the simple desire to be and have a family.  Seldom a gay film moves me this way.",1476662400,,280,4.326923076923077

8753959,3,B01CRIWSGG,I usually love sex scenes but I thought that they were a bit graphic for a movie that dealt with adoption rights of gay couples.  Other reviewers loved the film so I'd say give it a watch and see what you think.,1533600000,,211,4.023809523809524

8753964,4,B01CRIWSGG,"The struggle for marriage equality continues in Australia, (as of Nov 2016, the Australian Parliament refused to call the question in a public referendum) and with it, the possibility of gay couples or individuals to legally adopt children. Additionally, gay and lesbian couples in Australia are denied a human right to live as they were created. This film is about that struggle at its core, along with all the ancillary issues attached. Based on a stage play, the film presents some very graphic (some might deem gratuitous) sexual and domestic abuse scenes, along with a shot in a restroom, which should have been left on the editor's cutting room floor! This is a difficult story to tell and as presented here, a difficult story to watch. There are some fine performances by Graeme Squires and Nicholas Gunn. Viewers will feel their characters' frustration, disappointment, passion and pain. There are a lot of layers in this story and some may fault the script for not being more cinematically driven, to reduce the heaviness and propel the action--it is stagey and the pacing plods, making the film too long. Thus, editing, the script and direction are not this film's strong suits. However, the subject is timely, relevant and urgent. Human rights in Australia for everyone, NOW!",1482105600,3,1286,5.014018691588785

8753968,3,B01CRIWSGG,"Apparently, same sex couples in Australia are barred from adopting children.  Who knew that such a lively, progressive country was holding on to such Victorian era laws?  Children suffer, as they shuttle from foster home to foster home, because a loving same sex couple willing to provide a stable, loving home cannot do so. And this movie also falls apart because of this repressive measure.  Instead of being able to legally adopt or work with a surrogate, the two men at the center of the film (both, by the way, what we used to describe as VGL) must rely on a troubled young woman to turn over her baby to them.  Thus, the movie strays into high melodrama as the junkie mom threatens to take back her baby and go to the authorities unless our couple keep coughing up large sums of money.  What is interesting about the couple, and the movie I wanted to see, is how parenthood affects their relationship.  This is the real meat of the story, but keeps getting lost as maman shows up, smoking like a chimney and demanding money.  Perhaps it is a little unfair to want a different movie, but we haven't had one yet on how two men cope with bringing up
baby.  Maybe when Australia moves into the 21st century and rids itself of these repressive adoption  laws,  some talented filmmaker can pick up the story and give us all some insight into gay parenthood.",1480464000,6,1357,4.524590163934426
