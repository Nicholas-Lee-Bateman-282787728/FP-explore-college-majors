6516943,1,B00LZOCYXQ,"I bought this with excitement, never knew there was a reunion movie. I received it in a timely fashion, then didn't get around to watching it until recently. Imagine when I played the movie and found it to be just an early episode of Walker Texas Ranger. No reunion movie at all. the package and the label both describe a reunion movie....I am extremely disappointed by this! Buyers BEWARE!",1503014400,5,390,4.666666666666667

6516950,1,B00LZOCYXQ,"Misleading info. This is a SINGLE (two part) episode from the original Walker, Texas Ranger series. NOT the reunion TV movie that came out after it ended. The episode itself is okay, but definitely NOT worth 10 bucks alone",1474761600,11,222,4.717948717948718
6516951,5,B00LZOCYXQ,This episode deals with an assassin who wants to kill a senator and uses a competition to get to him.  Walker and Trivette have to find the assassin with the help of a legendary ranger and in the end he gives his life to save the senator.  This is a really good episode about loyalty and determination.,1470873600,8,302,4.280701754385965

6516962,1,B00LZOCYXQ,Misleading listing. If you're not a WTR fan it sounds like it's a post-series reunion when it's not. Bought it for my step-daughter's birthday who's a big Walker fan. She told me that it's an episode from one of the seasons that she already has.,1425859200,75,245,4.466666666666667
