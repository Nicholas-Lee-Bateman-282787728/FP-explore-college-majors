7902139,3,B0000023W0,"Don't get me wrong-I love Kenny, I'm a big Gladys fan, and Tina's performance is definitely worth the money I spent on the tape, but I bought the tape based on listings that Mark Lindsay, Keith Allison, Paul Revere, and Mike Smith performed on the show (it's actuallly two shows on the tape, but I digress). It's a good tape and it's nice to see Kenny before he went under the knife, but there are no Raiders here and I'm a little disappointed.",1168300800,,444,4.36144578313253
7902140,4,B0000023W0,"I really love the show Rollin' and wish a complete dvd set of the series would come out. In the meantime though this tape contains 2 poorly edited copies of original episodes it is worth seeing. Ike and Tina are great. The version of Proud Mary here is one of their best. Gladys Knight and Kin Vassey's duet is terrific. Kenny himself has stated he didn't know why Kin didn't become a solo success as well. He had a stong bluesy voice that has been missed since his mid 90s death. Kenny's best moment is There's An Old Man In Our Town. Many will be surprised to see his ""hippie"" look but I for one think he looks really cool. Even more iumpressive is the smooth tibre of his voice, something that was lost as he entered his 40s. Terry Williams get's to do a little comedy and the whole band shines on an accustic jam of Hey Bo Diddley. All in all worthwhile though sloppy in execution. The company didn't even bother with the correct song titles on the back.",1162857600,,958,4.298342541436464
