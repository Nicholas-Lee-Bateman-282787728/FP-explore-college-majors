8610948,2,B006E4015A,The filmed tango clips (as content) are great. The normal issue of Cita 2010 is a double DVD. The Blu Ray disk contains the two DVD Volumes. There is no quality improvement. So the pictures are of normal DVD but not Blu Ray (HD) quality. This is still acceptable. The most disturbing thing is the flickering (appearing and disappearing) logo tangopal in the right upper corner. I never had seen a DVD ore Blu Ray documentary or film with a logo or symbol in the picture. It is distracting the viewer and it's annoying.,1370476800,,518,4.5212765957446805
8610949,2,B006E4015A,"The dancing is superb,and the Picture Quality of the DVD is excellent.
However,for me, enjoyment is marred by a crass mastering decision.
A little way down from the top,right hand edge,of the frame is incorporated the 'Tangopal' name.
Not only is this in large,bold type,but it cycles continuously between on/off throughout the duration of the run time.
I find it extremely distracting,and annoying.
The DVD of 'The Best of CITA 2011' also suffers from the same mastering decision.",1325376000,,481,5.17948717948718
