Next to Conspirators of Pleasure, it's his best feature. 80 percent of the movie has Gilliam style cut-out style animation, but it's even more bizarre amd surrealistic than other classics like Darkness, Light Darkness. You won't be disappointed!",1527206400,,297,5.622222222222222

I have been a fan (rather obsessed) ever since I discovered the brilliant and magically macabre ""Alice"", which is Lewis Caroll thoroughly steeped and told via the realm of Czech surrealism.  Just like all of Svankmajer's works - nothing else out there is quite like it (I am especially fond of his take on ""Faust"", which is a film that I cannot help watching once a week or two weeks at the longest! Indeed it sucks me in not unlike a current that cinematically satisfies almost every human sense, or at least for this viewer's eccentric tastes!).

Needless to say this is not a review, and thus it is not helpful to anyone interested in this film - however I am hoping that more people will also question why there is no stateside release of Svankmajer's most recent work of high art!!!

8523204,5,B007Z0HK1U,"Svankmajer's movies are very impressive. Almost all of them: both shorts and long movies.
But when i saw Conspirators of Pleasure i thought: ""that's the best so far""
Then Little Otik came along. And that's even better.
Later Lunacy mantained the same quality level reached by Little Otik.
It looked impossible to go over that high high high level of beautiful, uniquely original, weird but intelligent, based mostly on clever ideas cinema.
This is a psychoanalytical comedy. A totally unexpected masterpiece with a little bit of Oedipus complex, Poe, a little bit of De Sade and conversetions between Freud's and Jung's portraits and sex and love and...
I won't tell more.
To me it's simply Svankmajer's best movie.",1375488000,,715,5.067796610169491
