5969083,3,B00F77MAC2,"Let me start off by saying the box is amazing, looks really cool. However once you slide out the cover you are left with the box and all the season and movies in their individual own CARDBOARD cases - whilst the designs on them look cool, the actual dvd cardboard cases are flimsy and cheap looking. What's even weirder is that two of my cases are damaged, one of the movie cases is squashed (this is what happens when you make the cases out of a weak material) and the other looks like its recived wear and tear, as in it looks like its been banged around a bit. Yet the large out box, has no damage to it at all, so it was damaged before it was put into the box). All the season's look like the updated released versions so they aren't anything new, or special for this new release, which is dissapointing. The actual discs are in stupid slots that make it hard to get the discs out, and I can tell that taking them out on multiple occasions will cause them to get scratched easily. The menu's are exactly the same as the old versions, no updated play all button has been added to the earlier seasons. If you already own Futurama on dvd then there would be no purpose in buying this box set, however if you don't own any of the Futurama seasons or movies then this is a good buy as its all together in a matching set. Also the so called ""calendar"" is just a poster sized picture. Bit of a overstatement to call it a calendar. In short, I like how it looks, not how its made. But I'm glad to finally own the complete set of futurama now.",1387756800,123,1538,4.1644295302013425
5969084,5,B00F77MAC2,"Futurama rocks, I never get tired of watching it. My 3 grandsons are hooked too! Blu-ray shu-ray....the series is great on DVD if you take care with the disks! It was cancelled too early, but it is what it is. I am thankful for Adult Swim for replaying it after Fox cancelled it and for Comedy Central for picking it up for new episodes. Awesome series!!",1387584000,,354,4.378787878787879
5969085,1,B00F77MAC2,"This product is terrible for DVDs. The cases are made cardstock paper which use slits to hold the discs. This scratchs the discs each time you pull them out and place them back in. This would be a great solution for Blu-Ray, since they don't scratch, but as these are DVDs which can be scratched by anything short of air this is a complete waste of money until the BD versions emerge. Not to mention the first 4 seasons still have the terrible navigation system from the past release and no play all feature has been added for the first 2 seasons to at least help.",1387324800,246,564,4.330188679245283
5969086,2,B00F77MAC2,"I agree with most of the other reviewers on here, the omission of Blu-Ray specs for the 2/3rds of the show that was produced in HD is terrible. The lack of any sort of comprehensive ""extras"" or retrospective material is also a shame.  I am also very curious to find out if they have gone back and streamlined the DVD menus for at least the first 2 seasons, if not ALL of them to feel like a cohesive set. The first two seasons, like the first few seasons of The Simpsons on DVD, lack ""PLAY ALL"" buttons and are just generally terrible to navigate.
I will be waiting for a more robust Blu-Ray set though I would not hold my breath that season 1-4 are gonna get anything better than a cheap upconversion.",1386547200,34,702,4.2781954887218046
5969087,3,B00F77MAC2,"First of all, lemme just say that Futurama is of course a great show. It's one of a kind. And for that reason, it deserves a proper blu-ray COMPLETE release. It's not asking too much especially since all Fox has to do is go back to the original 72 episode run and work a little magic hd-ing them up. (the rest of the show from there has already been released in beautiful hd clarity.)

Of course I'd give this show 5 stars any day.... But for this release I'm in hopes that others there may see my rating and understand the disappointment that our favourite show isn't caught up yet with the future of HD presentation. That's why I've rated this release a bit low. And maybe if I'm lucky, Fox (or someone in charge) may see this review -even if I freeze myself till the year 3000 just to wake up and see the lovely blu ray release that Futurama deserves.",1384992000,35,854,4.271604938271605
5969088,5,B00F77MAC2,"Yes, yes I know. This hasn't been released yet.

BUT the only confirmed additional bonuses is a 2014/3014 calendar, which is sure to be awesome. Basically I'm here to say that Futurama is an animated classic that was cancelled way too early on Fox, was revived with four movies, and then revived again for two more production seasons on Comedy Central. Honestly, I wish it had kept going a bit longer but what we have here is some classic comedy. Seriously, just give it a watch. You won't be sorry!

Now for the ""but"" in the title. I REALLY wish they'd release the complete series on Blu-ray, too! Yes, the first four seasons weren't produced for HD, but the four movies and the Comedy Central episodes were! Also the first two movies (Bender's Big Score and Beast with a Billion Backs) haven't received and HD release yet! I'm just saying, there's some rabid Futurama fans who would leap at the chance to get the Complete series on Blu-ray. Get on it, Fox!",1379980800,55,958,4.563953488372093

5969091,4,B00F77MAC2,"Its Futurama, the best animated tribute to almost every sci fi film or tv show ever made, and a pretty hilarious futurist office comedy in its own right.  Its the entire show, if it was that it would be a five star product.  What holds it back is the packaging.  Oh I love the box art, but I really do not like how the DVDs are packaged as the way they are packed its very easy to scratch them which negatively affects playing ability.  Still I love it and its worth the money.",1528156800,,477,4.096774193548387

5969105,5,B00F77MAC2,A fantastic tv series made be the creator of the Simpsons. Futurama is a story about a guy who is cryogenically frozen and wakes up 1000 years in the future. The show is comedic gold as well as heart warming and tear jerking. This is a show that you must own and it would be a wonderful gift.,1522972800,,292,4.051724137931035

5969108,1,B00F77MAC2,Worst item buyed on Amazon. Great series ruined by awful physical format,1522022400,,72,5.083333333333333
5969109,3,B00F77MAC2,"Futurama is one of my favorite shows. When I found this collection at a great price ($80) I decided to buy it for myself because no one close to me would ever know that I would want this. I am just trying the individual discs now to make sure they play and am completely FLABBERGASTED that there isn't a play all button on the home screen of the disc. It just lists each episode separately. If you want to binge or watch a few episodes during a meal you will
Have to wait each time for the home screen to load again, which takes a lot longer than it should, clean your fingers (or not) to pick up the remote which you may have lost and then select the next episode.

The 3 star rating is due to this absurd oversight. I would love to award whoever missed that in publishing a trophy for Epic Fail of the century. The volumes are much slimmer than previous volumes (refer to photos) and the artwork is great. Each time they reprint these they are supposed to lake them better/ more practical and user friendly however I just really cant believe there is no way to let the disc know you want to watch all the episodes in one sitting. It is so absolutely stupid i might return the set and try to purchase all the seasons separately although it will be tough to find the previously published series.

I also find the paper flap that keeps the discs in place will quickly wear. Another dumb oversight.

What a shame.",1521936000,10,1411,4.277153558052435
5969110,4,B00F77MAC2,I want to start by saying this is an amazing and very affordable collection. A must have for Futurama fans. On that note the only reason this doesn't deserve a 5 star is because its packaging is very thin and flimsy,1521676800,,215,4.2682926829268295

5969119,5,B00F77MAC2,Picked this up when it was on sale for about 75 bucks. Great value for that price (or even a little more). Box art both on the set and the individual season boxes is exquisite. Can't recommend more for the Futurama fan.,1518480000,2,219,4.238095238095238

5969126,3,B00F77MAC2,"I love the Futurama series and was excited to have the complete box set. The packaging is fun with lots of characters featured.
I've been slightly disappointed that some of the disks skip or cut off a few second early.  This happens particularly during transitions between scens in the middle of episodes.  I had one problem where I couldn't select an episode from the home menu- it eventually worked after just trying again and again.  'm confident that it isn't the DVD player as other disks do not have this problem. Overall, a great fun to watch with some minor frustrations over the playback.",1517443200,,597,4.721153846153846

They poorly hot glue gunned the back of the container and did the same on some of the disc cases. Also, only some of the discs have the PLAY ALL function.

Season 1 - Damaged packaging - the outside of the case was torn and the cuts that hold the discs were also torn
Season 2, Disc 3 - Was missing 3 of the 5 episodes due to a problem with the disc
Season 3, Disc 4 - Was missing the end of one episode (Godfellas) and the start of the following episode (Future Stock)

5969188,2,B00F77MAC2,"I have no complaints as to the contents of this collection - all eight seasons of the show and all four movies, including lots of extras.  That's great, and its all that I wanted.  Even the design for the collection box was nice.  If I were to write a review based on this alone, It'd be five stars.

However, both the product and the shipping box were damaged upon delivery - dents and creases, etc.  The DVDs themselves did not look to be damaged, but when I pay over $70 for a ""New"" collection, I would like it to look pristine; that's not too much to ask.  The box itself was unsatisfactorily packed, with too much empty space for things to rattle around.  That is likely part of the problem, but it is also part of Amazon's job to make sure that doesn't happen.

As per the attached photos, the shipping box looked to have been thrown around a bit, the tape was damaged, etc.  The actual collection box had several creases and a dent where the black coloring had begun peeling.  This would have been acceptable if the product was listed as ""Used"" and sold for a lower price.  However, that wasn't the case.

There are a few other people with similar problems, so if you are thinking of buying this collection, beware that there's a likelihood that it'll arrive damaged.  If you don't care about that, you have nothing to worry about.

And a few got scratched just removing them. Not happy about that. That being said each seasons dvd cases are very well presented with high gloss artwork. Though the box description is just an after thought and stuck on with just some tacky stuff. And ypu can lift it up. Benders Big Score also has this and it is worse. Only held on in the center while every other case has the description printed on the cardboard. I do not understand why that is. The dvds themselves are also very nice. Theres commentary for every episode which is a plus. Note that this does not have seasons 9 and 10. Those are apparently unavailable as physical copies. For whatever reasons.

It has incredible, intricate art throughout with some inventive ways of tying it in with the packaging. There's just a lot of great stuff to look at where some other box sets really phone it in with basic artwork and little attention to detail.

My mediocre rating, however, is for the fact that my set came damaged (not due to shipping, as the shipping box was in perfect condition). The main outer slip box of the set was crushed at the top on both sides. Amazon quickly sent a replacement, which despite my notes on what had happened and how to avoid it, also came damaged in the same exact way. Now they refuse to send a replacement and offered no other satisfying options. I don't want a refund; I want what I paid for in new, undamaged condition.",1492992000,5,852,4.426751592356688

pros:
great art work on all the cases
all the individual cases came in perfect condition as far as I could tell and all the dvd's have worked that I've tried.
fantastic price for a box set

cons:
as other reviewers have noted it would have made alot more sense to send them in a jewel type case or any sort of case that allows you to snap the disk out of vs having to slide it out and potentially cause damage.

The box looks nice but nothing too special about  it other that ""Futurama"" is in slightly raised lettering.

5969224,5,B00F77MAC2,"This set of Futurama discs arrived in excellent condition packed in a box with a few other items I had ordered at the same time.  There was no physical damage to the boxset nor its contents.

A few of the discs had a few minor surface scratches, presumably from sliding the discs in/out of the cardboard holder. These few very minor scratches did not affect play at all, and I've bought really scratched discs before that still played well.  This scratching might be a problem though for those that would play these discs frequently and take them out frequently, but who would hassle with THAT these days.  I found only one loose disc while removing the holder, but I was careful with each and it didn't have a chance to drop on the floor.

It took me an entire day to rip all these discs to my media server.  I didn't experience any read errors on any of the discs.  The boxset I will pack away for safe keeping along with my other frequently watched shows, like Family Guy, King of the Kill, the Simpsons, American Dad, and a few others (like the Beavis & Butt-head set, etc.). I like to have all these shows instantly available in a randomized playlist which I like to turn on while doing the dishes or folding the laundry or when just cleaning.  It's just something that makes me laugh and passes the time along while getting things done.

 I really like the artwork on these disc cases and I may scan a couple and print them out as posters to hang on my home theater wall .. assuming I can match the colors exactly.  The ""color"" artists that worked on this series did a great job, which really adds to the quality and ambiance of these shows.

The 2 screen shots (Bender in the kitchen, and Bender the hobo) were captured while watching these shows on my phone and are from earlier 4:3 format shows but widened to 16:9.  They look good to me for 4:3.  The newest shows are 16:9.

Also be advised that the 4 feature length movies are actually Season 5.  And some of the discs are digitally named incorrectly.  They transposed the use of SEASON and VOLUME incorrectly, i.e. Volume 5 discs are (digitally) entitled Season 5, which is wrong .. the 4 movies were Season 5.  But the printing on everything is correct.  Just keep this in mind if you catalog your discs by reading them with software. Volume 5 is not Season 5.

Seems to lock up in the same place once it fails, but repeated attempts will play and then lock elsewhere. I am currently wrestling with volume 3 disc 2 episode 9 (3rd on the disc).

5969247,3,B00F77MAC2,"When I first opened my present, I noticed Amazon shipped the box without any packing material at all, which is why the outside of the Futurama Box looks entirely dented, and cornered up.  Oh well.  Too bad, I thought.

I tore away the plastic, and took out a season.  They all have pretty cool graphics on them.  Very keen to their original seasons.  As I opened the boxes up I noticed, along with my brother, that every DVD had partial fingerprints, smudges, grease, and some were even scratched, as if they would look after a decade of use.  Kind of suspicious.

Some had evidence of DVD burning due to the outter ring, which is left by garbage burning units.  Some did not.  Some DVDs looked like they had never been touched.  Quite strange.

The most disappointing part is that nearly every single DVD box is ripped completely on the inside where you insert the DVDs.  As long as all DVDs work, then I won't return, and take one for the team.  Although, if I was a collector, and I received this on my birthday, then I would be much more disappointed in the quality of this product.  Especially, how Amazon delivered it via a Prime Delivery Account.  Thank goodness I just want the discs to work, and could care less about some beautifully drawn boxes!  If the discs don't work, then I will be promptly be returning these discs.  I absolutely know Amazon is good on their word to that, and have never had such a poor delivery from them.

This product came to me used but was not represented as such.  Many of the discs were out of order, the packaging was broken in multiple places, and most sadly of all about 1/2 of the discs have issues playing.  The quality of these discs is poor.  Some of the discs skip slightly, and some of the pause as you DVD player has to re-read multiple times to get a good sampling in order to continue playing.

I am currently finishing season four and these problems have been consistent through the seasons.

I have however been able to watch all episodes so far, as long as I was willing to put up with the slight skips and pauses.

Unfortunately I believe this is the only distribution available for this show so if you want the show in your library you have little choice but to get these.  Here's hoping my problems with this distribution are not common.

When I opened the box and removed the plastic wrapper, it look used. All the paper parts were smashed or dinged, and a few dvds were dislodged. Luckily the dvds played despite one dvd being scratched and a couple that had rough edges.

Clearly the disks were not adequately checked for correctness and/or the disk quality is extremely poor - as in a huge defect rate.

Given other customer experiences have been the same, I can only conclude someone is operating unethically.  But since I've no way to check the supply-chain I can't point fingers to who.

I give 3-stars because the price was good, and the parts of the content that work are GREAT.",1444694400,2,721,4.458015267175573

Each individual volume is in eco-friendly cardstock packaging and they are in a nice compact box. It's not fancy, but it's not cheap or shoddy.

5969345,4,B00F77MAC2,"I seriously doubt anyone here needs a season by season of this outstanding show. I seriously doubt anyone who has never seen Futurama is coming here to drop $100 on buying the complete set; therefore, the packaging comments are completely appropriate. I'd give any product packaged this way the lowest numbers of stars possible. I'm certainly glad I read this before spending my hard earned cash on a set of DVD's that have a high probability of arriving damaged right from time I open the box.
I would like to know, if Volume One and Volume Two each have a ""play all"" selection to watch every episode or does each episode have to be selected individually like my original Volume One and Volume Two sets? Is this just a repackaged version of the same discs that were originally released years ago? I love the fact starting with Volume Three and continuing through Volume Eight on the individually purchased sets that there is a ""play all"" icon on every disc.
Hopefully, the manufacturer has completely revamped the discs for the first two seasons with a ""play all"" option. If, they have upgraded both volumes in this set, then I will buy it and take my chances on the packaging. I'm certain anyone reading this can tell that I'm extremely disappointed there was not a ""play all"" selection available on Volumes One and Two when I began purchasing them years ago as they were released. Futurama is my most favorite show ever released by Matt Groening or any of the great shows from the other two new millennium cartoon icons, Mike Judge and Seth MacFarlane. It is a terrible shame there aren't 280 episodes available. There are too many classic episodes to name them all, but I love Hell is Other Robots, Amazon Women in the Mood, A Tale of Two Santas, Luck of the Fryish, Parasites Lost, Bendless Love, The Day the Earth Stood Stupid, Bending in the Wind, A Pharaoh to Remember, Roswell the Ends Well, Godfellas, Bender Should Not Be Allowed on TV, The Farnsworth Paradox, The Devils Hands are Idle Playthings, The Sting, The Philip J. Fry, Silence of the Clamps, All the Presidents Heads, Forty Percent Leadbelly and 2D Blacktop just to name a few off the top of my head; however, there are many, many more classics. Every episode and all of shorts are no less than great. I have everything on DVD and I'll have via Amazon Prime by the end of the year. Speaking of Amazon Prime, there is only one thing cooler than having each volume on Prime and that would be a ""PLAY ALL"" on Amazon Prime. I hate having to manipulate a remote after every episode. This should be a very easy fix for Amazon. It is certainly easier than fixing the DVD's from Volumes One and Two.
FUTURAMA IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST! I have loved the show from the night it debuted in 1999. I even have a Futurama tattoo. If, your kids aren't watching this show, they should be. I introduced the show to my kids in 2000 and, just recently, to my grandkids. I hope all of you enjoy it as much as all of us.
Peace, love and happiness, Stevo Griffin",1434758400,2,3006,4.5275735294117645

I tried shaking it out but it just moved around inside. I knew I had to reach in and grab it. This, my friends, caused something that I thought was impossible to happen to someone who always takes care of their stuff. It ripped the thin sheet-like case right on the side.

5969362,5,B00F77MAC2,"I love Futurama. If you don't know the show, I can't recommend it highly enough. I won't go into any details about the actual series here, because there is a ton of that information available to you online. Instead, I will write here only about this actual collection. I should also state that I rarely buy video discs (I have Amazon Prime and Netflix, plus amazing FiOS Internet speed), and have not purchased any Futurama discs previously.

This collection is inclusive, as the product info states. And the artwork is neat and artistic. What the product info doesn't tell you is that cheap, flimsy card stock is used throughout. If you are looking for a collectible, look elsewhere. My external box was dented as I removed it from the packaging, but the internals were all fine. I've read a lot of reviews that state they received discs that were unplayable due to scratches, so I checked every single disc for damage. Only one disc was less than perfect, but it had only very minor surface scratches; nothing that will effect play-ability.

Also in many reviews, I read about discs that stuck to the glue used to make the envelopes. I did not experience any of this problem. I may be just really lucky this time, but I expect that the manufacturing process has probably been improved in response to the problems reported.

So what we have here is an excellent and inclusive collection of a fantastic animated series, packaged in cheap but functional card stock. If you buy at the right time, you can save a lot of money. If you feel the packaging isn't safe enough, use that savings to buy yourself an inexpensive disc envelope system.

The disc is fine but the case it came in is totaled. The odd part is the over all case that everything came in is fine and square. It's just that one sleeve is screwed up. It makes no sense until you realize that some jerk moron saw it was messed up and put it in the set anyway. Thanks jerk!

Now the packaging of the later 4 series is crap; ecologically sound cardboard, ""green"" packaging, but crap.

8612854,1,B00F77MAC2,"5 stars for the show itself: I knew I was buying a great show.

However, the quality of and functionality of the discs leaves much to be desired. As another poster mentioned, there's no Play All button. So, each time an episode ends, you have to manually navigate the DVD menu in order to play the next episode; this is not ideal for binge watching. I mean, we bought the whole series pretty much for this purpose. Anyway, that wouldn't have prompted me to leave this review. What did was that it's 2018 and apparently we haven't figured out DVDs yet. How can a brand new set, sealed and treated carefully, be so damaged that it hangs up the whole player and can't go past a scene in episode 4 in Season 2 (disc 1)? Damaged disc on a brand new set. If I can't expect a new copy of 23-year-old technology to perform well on the first play-through, what can I expect? Of course, since it's taken us a while to get to this point, we're outside the return window. Very disappointing.",1529193600,5,979,4.3497267759562845

Perfect condition and has really cool artwork, some cases are holographic, some have embossed details, and the movie Bender's Big Score has a 3D cover it's so cool. Love everything about it, absolutely great buy. ",1528675200,,285,4.588235294117647
8612857,4,B00F77MAC2,"LOVE this series, but most seem to ship with some minor or major damage, and mine was no exception. Still, they need to pull their jar-heads out of their shiny metal you-know-whats and update this with widescreen for the first several seasons as well as making a blu-ray edition. Also, the scratchy cardboard disc slips are a no-go. Box set manufacturers should stop using such cheap methods as it makes a collectible item too prone to damage.",1528588800,,443,4.766233766233766
