6464131,5,B00L3PCNGU,"3 great Grisham movies, I recommend the movies and the books to anybody.",1455408000,,72,4.615384615384615
6464132,3,B00L3PCNGU,Pelican Brief is a bad copy with it skipping and stopping. I wish you would replace it! The other two movies were good copies.,1444089600,,126,4.291666666666667
6464133,5,B00L3PCNGU,"Back in the heyday when Grisham was all the rage they were making some pretty good films from his populist novels. And here we get three of the better ones. It depends on how you look at it but A Time To Kill is probably the most powerful, though, The Client gives it a run for its money at times. Pelican Brief is also not a bad film just not quite on the same level. All three here have bluray transfers that are pretty decent for older catalogue titles.

I cannot see anyone being truly disappointed with this budget release, though, some light DNR is evident most often in PB, probably the least important of the trio offered here. Softness is apparent at times from old masters and I take it lower bitrates. The Client has the only MPEG4 transfer with the others getting VC1 near the 20Mbps line.... Nothing that is going to rock your socks for sure but for 10 bucks or so it is a good deal. Recommended.",1438473600,6,909,4.315789473684211

6464144,1,B00L3PCNGU,"This review is for the way these discs are packaged in the case.  There are 3 discs, but only 2 places for the discs, which meant that 2 of the discs were stacked on top of each other!  As a result, one of the discs is scratched up!  I can't believe the manufacturer would find this kind of packaging acceptable.
I read through some of the reviews and didn't see any mention of this, so I don't know if this is a defect, or if all of the cases are like this for this triple feature.
In any event, I am returning this and requesting a refund.  It's a shame, because I love all 3 of these movies and would love to have them in one set.",1502323200,2,633,3.9606299212598426

8663627,5,B00L3PCNGU,"While the other two movies are good, I bought this Blu-ray specifically for ""Time to Kill"". I think that this movie is one of Matthew McConaughey's best performances if not his best. Great story by John Grisham. ""The Defense Rests Your Honor""",1518566400,2,242,4.785714285714286
8663628,5,B00L3PCNGU,"Great price.  The only movie with special features (unless you count Trailers) is ""The Client"", which includes the Pilot episode of Season 1 of ""The Client"" (1h 31m) tv show in 720x480 format.

The Client:
- DTS-HD MA/DTS Stereo only; no surround 5.1
- H.264

The Pelican Brief:
- Dolby TrueHD 5.1, DD Surround AC3 5.1
- VC1

A Time to Kill:
- Dolby TrueHD 5.1, DD Surround AC3 5.1
- VC1

All three movies look like good quality transfers to blu-ray, with ""The Client"" being the sharpest in my opinion.",1516147200,,502,4.472527472527473
