8640561,3,B00IAZXNYC,"MR. ARKADIN (aka ""Confidential Report"") is now advertised as a forgotten Orson Welles classic. In all probability this movie in first run was rightly dismissed as a mediocrity. The script is by turn confused and transparently predictable. Welles as the main character mugs for a tilted camera to the point of annoyance and his direction is heavy handed: the overuse of skewed horizons, bizarre camera angles, cluttered sets and jarring edits do nothing but distract the viewer. Peripheral eccentrics pass through the story as rapidly as the blurry panning used in one scene.

(*Plot spoilers follow*)

The wealthy Mr. A. (estimated worth: 100 million dollars) feigns amnesia and sends a would-be blackmailer (Guy Van Stratten) on a worldwide search for answers to his ""mysterious"" past-- the true motive is to prevent his daughter (Raina) from learning that her father was once a lowlife gangster. Arkadin secretly tails his hired investigator and disposes of old acquaintances as each is discovered. (Note that none of these killings is ever shown.) Once the last link to his past is destroyed, Arkadin intends to either frame Van Stratten for the several murders or kill him. Realizing this, the frightened man flees to Spain and the arms of waiting Raina, where he believes he will be safe. Arkadin follows by piloting his small plane in a race to beat Van Stratten to Raina. In a desperate radio conversation with his daughter, Arkadin is misled into believing she knows ""everything,"" so he apparently throws himself from the airplane (again this is implied).
