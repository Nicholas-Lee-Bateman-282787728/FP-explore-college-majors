Let's start with the acting. Oh my word this was terrible. The main actor Sunny Lamarre was kind of terrible. He had no emotion, and was wooden throughout the whole movie. It's like he was reading the script during the filming because he looked unprepared, uncomfortable, and it was a mess!! He was so silent and shy. His girlfriend was bad too. She had this annoying nasally voice and was terrible. She was trying so hard to be cute but it didn't work. And the mother was just as bad. She was actually funny at how bad she was. Here's a convo between the two : ""Hey mom, I'm getting an education now!"" Then the moms goes ""Do you wanna get slapped?! Watch the tone...figure it out okay"" What type of dialogue is that?! It makes no sense. Then Angel's friends. That scene was awful. There was this ghetto nappy haired kid who acts so over dramatic, then there's the girl who kept spilling the drink because she was pretending to drink it, then the white kid who's laughing because the script is so bad. Plus you can see him and the girl look at the script!!! Do they find these actors out on the street?? Oh and the little kids were awful too. They were so bad and the one little boy was a mess!! He kept moving around and not paying attention, at one point the actress started laughing...which leads me to my next complaint.

Now onto the editing. Lord have mercy the editing was a disgrace!!! It was so choppy and cut I couldn't believe it. It was so choppy you could hear the audio being chopped as well in the park scene! MESS!! Then at the final scene it's on the same angle filming the actors for like 15 minutes straight!!! Talk about boring! And they didn't even edit out mistakes!! The ending scene was atrocious! And guess what? You can hear the director telling the girl her lines, and then the girl says them!! I was taken aback I just couldn't believe what I was watching!! Bad bad bad

Then the sound!!! YOU COULD HEAR THE CACKLING OF THE MICROPHONE!!! At first I thought it was a storm or something, but nope it's the rubbing off of the actors. Plus they played the same terrible song over every scene! Such a cheap movie...

All in all, don't get this movie. I paid $10 that could've gone to REAL God's work!! That guy Miguel Nunez, yeah he isn't even in the movie enough to be on the cover. He's in ONE SCENE!! That is false advertising which is like lying and lying is a SIN! Not very God-like now is it? I'm am so offended by this movie. Can't believe I rented this...shame on me :(

0/5 Stars....

DO NOT BUY! DO NOT BUY! AVOID AT YOUR OWN RISK!!",1386028800,2,2771,4.309021113243762
8597122,2,B00DSAUI4M,"It seems like it's just about teenagers smoking, stealing a vehicle. The father not coping with his everyday issues. Nothing uplifting. I did not like the way it ended. The children left lost. Nothing edifying in this movie to make me want to watch it again. I wish that I did not buy it. Miguel Nunez was too hard on the basketball player that wanted to quit school. He did not showed that he really cared. It's a shame. He could of been the one to at least make him think twice about his decision, etc. Very disappointed.",1385424000,,523,4.346938775510204
