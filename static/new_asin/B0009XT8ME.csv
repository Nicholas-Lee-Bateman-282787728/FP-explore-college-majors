2334679,4,B0009XT8ME,"I enjoyed this set,as I do all silent films,but the music was horrible. It's like they hired some guy with a keyboard and no imagination. The music in the Patchwork Girl was so boring and redundant that I had to turn the volume down after a few minutes,because it was driving me nuts. I realize these are ancient movies and you can't beat the price of the dvd,but a little more effort by the new composer would be nice. With that said,it's still a good buy for anyone who enjoys silent films.",1213660800,6,492,4.358695652173913

It showed it in the old, old, type of movie, fast movements, no sounds, had to read fast what they were saying. Was nothing like the original movie.  I also ordered the original movie, The Wizard of Oz and was lost in the mail and was to be credited but have not yet seen the credit.",1199664000,,380,3.858974358974359
2334682,3,B0009XT8ME,"In 1914, L. Frank Baum, author of 15 ""Wizard of Oz"" books, started his own film company. Baum scripted and oversaw production on all the Oz movies. Life-size puppets were used for some characters, while actors often portrayed various roles from film to film. The first three titles in this set are of particular interest, for these are how the author himself wanted his classic children's books to appear on theater screens. They are certainly a LOT different than the 1939 MGM movie and yet, still seem familiar.

SYNOPSES:

""The Magic Cloak of Oz"" - Woven by fairies, the magic cloak will grant a single wish to the unhappiest child in Oz. Violet MacMillan portrays King Timothy-- later she would be Dorothy.

""His Majesty, The Scarecrow of Oz"" - Princess Gloria is the hypotenuse of a love triangle. She's in love with a gardener's son, while evil King Crewl has his sights set on her.

""The Patchwork Girl of Oz"" - The first-ever Oz movie. The patchwork girl, created out of rags, is the perfect servant until she develops a free will. Future 'Our Gang' dirctor Hal Roach appears as the Cowardly Lion.

""The Wizard of Oz"" - After his father's death, L. Frank Baum Jr. tried reviving the series. This second cinematic telling of the original Oz story had Oliver Hardy in the cast and featured a lot of slapstick comedy. The original 1910 movie was based more on the stage musical than the book.

2334683,4,B0009XT8ME,"We all know of the Wizard of Oz, but many fans aren't aware the author L Frank Baum wrote 13 sequels, and many more were written by Ruth Plumly Thompson and other authors after Baum died.

These black and white short films are silent mini movies of Baum's sequels, and the only screen adaptations of most of them. (Later features ""Return to Oz"" and ""Journey back to Oz"" only adapt the first 2 or 3.

2334684,5,B0009XT8ME,"These movies are a must have for any Oz fan. Fans who are familiar with the other Oz books will be glad to know that at least one of Baums' sequels was made into a film-""The Patchwork Girl Of Oz"". The film ""His Majesty,The Scarecrow Of Oz""(1914)actually inspired Baum to write the book ""The Scarecrow Of Oz"" a year later in 1915. ""The Magic Cloak"" was based on a story written by Baum that was not directly related to Oz but due to the success of his Oz creation, the movie was to be set in the land of Oz. The 1925 ""Wizard Of Oz"" is a movie very distant from the book and MGM version, eliminating some main characters in favor of new ones as well as a different storyline; no pairs of ruby slippers, no munchkins, a yellow brick road or even a witch. The new music dubbed into the movie is good, however it is never matched with any of the action or scenes. It's about 2 different songs for each movie that keep repeating themselves when the other is done. Each movie is also tinted. ""The Patchwork Girl"" is tinted a dark yellow-almost orange. ""His Majestey, the Scarecrow"" is tinted green, ""The Magic Cloak"" is yellow and ""Wizard Of Oz"" (1925) is tinted blue. A fun collection of movies for a generous price.",1170115200,20,1210,4.334801762114537
2334685,3,B0009XT8ME,"This is obviously a very old movie.  It is a silent film and appears to not have been digitally remastered.  It is interesting from an antiquity point of view.  1916 is along way back in time for movie technology.  If you keep in mind the age and the acting style from then, you may enjoy this.  There are 3 movies on it, I believe.  They are short.  I only watched one and I think it was only about 45 minutes long.  Don't try to compare it to the 1939 version that we all know and love.  These versions are vastly different from each other, and the comparison doesn't make any sense.",1162771200,,585,4.198198198198198
2334686,4,B0009XT8ME,"First off, one needs to know that this DVD does NOT contain the famous 1939 ""Wizard of Oz"" film with Judy Garland. Instead, these are earlier films, all silent, based on the Oz books by L. Frank Baum. The author himself started a film company in 1914 to make these, so 3 of the 4 films here, ""The Patchwork Girl of Oz,"" ""The Scarecrow of Oz,"" and ""The Magic Cloak,"" were made in 1914 by his company. The fourth one, ""The Wizard of Oz,"" is from 1925 and is a comedy version that strays a great deal from the original story. It features an early performance of Oliver Hardy, one half of the Laurel & Hardy duo that formed several years later. These silent films are moderately interesting and clever, and often funny. The picture quality varies a good bit, but overall is good considering their age. The special effects are amazingly good for that era too. All the films are tinted in various colors, sometimes overdone for my taste. As is typical with silent films, these are accompanied by on-sceen text for dialogue and explanations, and all have a musical score throughout. Also, this DVD is a great value as it's over 4 hours long. In sum, these 4 Oz films cannot be expected to replace the 1939 ""Wizard of Oz"" with its sumptuous production values including the unforgettable Judy Garland, but these should be seen as additions to that and are worth seeing in their own right.",1150502400,113,1379,4.542168674698795

The only problem is, I didn't get around to seeing the entire disc until yesterday, and guess what, the last two films--The Magic Cloak of Oz and The Wizard of Oz are not on the disc.  The collection ends with the second film, His Majesty, the Scarecrow of Oz.  When the film ends, the face of the girl wearing ""the crown of Oz"", for lack of a better term, appears and then the screen pronounces ""The End"".  And so it is.

2334699,3,B0009XT8ME,"If you are interested in completing your ""Oz"" collection...then definitely get this.  My 5 year old grandkids enjoyed watching these additional peeks into the land of Oz.  I found the music redundantly repetitive and annoying.  Good thing we didn't need the volume to enjoy these subtitled pre-talkie movies.  Some of the effects were surprisingly ahead of their time, others were flagrantly low budget.  I'm glad to have these in my collection.  Kids will watch again...once was enough for me.",1373328000,,494,5.189873417721519
2334700,5,B0009XT8ME,"This is a real treat
First... don't expect These four silents to be the famous 1939 version...expect something oddly different...if you do you will be fascinated.
You get the Wizard of Oz in four Tints(each movie a different tint: Reddish, Sepia, Yellow and Blue to add a bit of surreal dreaminess to them). The actual writer of the Oz stories forms a motion picture company to create the first three pieces, so you see the Wizard of Oz as intended by the writer of the stories; that doesn't happen very often!

The costumes have a early stage play feel to them...so you get a sense of what 19th century stage plays were like...a neat sort of bonus.  The quality of the exposure is very good. The fourth movie is a bit dark and the TV might need to be set brighter. The music is a bit of a downfall. The music in the first movie is a bit over bearing and repetitive, but it calms down a bit or you just get used to it. Similarly the music for all four is repetitive. The fourth movie music is probably the best fit, though repeated over and over, but at times it's fits well and is even a bit haunting at times.
If you want your kids, or even yourself to enjoy classic silents, this might be a great starting point.

One curious note. All through history and cinema statues coming to life is an odd bit of stuff,Such as the movie The Golem and others. and I can't help think their's a connection to the end times when the world leader causes a statue to come to life and make the world worship him. To have Statues coming to life in a child story then then have the wherewithal to make movies including this as well as witches, and magic make me wonder if there's some ulterior motives of the author/director. I will say turning people into statues occurs when exposing people to Unified Field technology and having them fuse with other matter. then taking the field away. Then they become statues. then re-expose them to the same field having the extra material fall away leaving the human void of the extra material and free to move again thus a 'statue comes to life'. This is ancient science, not ""Magic"", but it is still known, so don't fall for it.
The first movie is the most unfamiliar when thinking of the 1939 version, and probably the oddest. The known characters Scarecrow, Tin man, Lion and Dorthy start to enter the scene in the last three, with the 1925 version the most familiar to those growing up with the 1939 version. There's a wild surprise where the Tin man does something completely unexpected to the witch in one of the second two.

All undertones aside, for simple silent movie treats, this is probably one of the best buys out there with four full length movies. the first three movies are 65, 59, and 38 minutes... pretty long for 1914 and the 1925 is 96 minutes. a real bargain.
  And if your a Laurel and Hardy fan you get a bonus with Ollie having a major part in the 1925 film.",1355270400,,2908,4.385899814471243

In this age of computer gtenerated special effects and high power pyrotechnics, it is hard to imagine a time when what we saw on the screen was actually being performed...by human beings, if you can believe it.  Readers should note that this is not the Judy Garland rendition of the Wizard of Oz, but a collection of silent movies fron the writings of Frank Baum. My only disappointment was with the music.  I tend to turn down my volume and add my ofn soundtrack from my CD collection...or simply watch it in silence.  It loses nothing that way and I am not distracted.  Those expecting the later MGM film will be sorely disappointed, but give these films a chance.  Baum authored 15 books in the series and created his own company to produce the films.  The first three movies on the disc are his hantywork.  The fourth is by his son.  I urge readers to give this collection a fighting chance.  Watch it, mull it over and revisit it.  You might just find a real gem.  I did!",1263686400,3,1174,5.1534391534391535
2334705,4,B0009XT8ME,"I was so happy to finally be able to see Baum's original movies.  They're odd and incomprehensible if you haven't read the books, or sometimes even if you have.  But so much fun for their historical interest.  The character cameos were fun, especially seeing the Braided Man as a juror in Ojo's trial.  The animal puppetry was amazing, and the sets and costumes were so much like the book illustrations.

But the musical score was awful; the same fifteen seconds of ""music"" repeated over and over, until we turned off the sound because we couldn't stand any more.  It was slow and lugubrious and had nothing to do with the hilarious action.",1261958400,2,640,4.669642857142857

2334708,3,B0009XT8ME,"The enduring popularity of Frank L. Baum's WIZARD OF OZ books owes a great deal to the classic 1939 film adaptation starring Judy Garland, Ray Bolger, Jack Haley, Bert Lahr, Margaret Hamilton, and Frank Morgan. But there have been numerous adaptations of the Oz books made before and after this movie milestone. This collection consists of four of the earlier adaptations.

In 1914 Frank L. Baum formed The Oz Film Manufacturing Company with the express purpose of producing live-action versions of his stories. THE PATCHWORK GIRL OF OZ, HER MAJESTY THE SCARECROW OF OZ, and THE MAGIC CLOAK OF OZ -- all from 1914 -- are surprisingly ambitious for independent productions of this nature. What they lack in big-studio polish they make up for in high spirits and ingenuity, and though these pictures probably won't peak the interest of average contemporary viewers (who don't appreciate silent movies anyway), film buffs will find plenty of antique charm on display.

Completely lacking in charm, antique or otherwise, is the feature-length WIZARD OF OZ (1925), starring rowdy silent-screen comedian Larry Semon, who also directs the picture in his typically heavy-handed, unsubtle style. With his penchant for overblown, violent slapstick and offensive racial ""humor,"" Semon was the worst possible choice to adapt the whimsical Baum tales, and the results here prove it. This is the kind of movie that gives Silent Cinema a bad reputation. While its inclusion here is understandable, from a historical perspective, it limits this collection's appeal to silent-screen buffs and Frank L. Baum scholars. Fans of comedy legend Oliver Hardy (whose partnership with Stan Laurel was only a year or two away) may be interested in checking out his supporting role as one of Semon's foils, but even Ollie's most dedicated admirers will find this film hard to endure.",1220227200,6,1855,5.20066889632107
