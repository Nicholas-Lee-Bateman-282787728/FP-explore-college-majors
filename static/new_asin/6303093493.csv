561924,4,6303093493,"I would not have cast Charlton Heston as the humble Captain Haynes, and I'll NEVER be able to watch Richard Thomas portray a character without thinking ""John-boy"", but it is still a very good made-for-TV movie.  I had hoped for more scenes on the jet while it was still in the air, because not all the heroes were in the cockpit or wearing badges that day.  There aren't ANY scenes of the jet beyond the cockpit (or exterior views), and even those are few and far between.
As a bonus, I noticed several of the actual people involved pop up in cameo roles.  Very nice.",1052006400,5,567,4.380952380952381
561925,4,6303093493,"The main reason that I really like ""A Thousand Heros"" that unlike out diaster movies, this movie focuses more on the aftermath than the event. Richard Thomas did a great job! Charlton Heaston was good, but he didn't seem to be doing ""acting"".  As the viewer, I would have exected the cockpit scenes to have more drama to them. But overall ""A Thousand Heros"" is a movie.",1048809600,,369,4.507462686567164
561926,5,6303093493,"I have read many articles and seen several documentaries about UA flight 232. I am extremely satisfied with the way the movie presented the accident and the way the actors presented an extremely volatile situation. This was an accident that could have ended a lot worse, but because of courage, luck and several other factors, a successful landing was almost within their reach. It is a remarkable story and I recommend it to everyone.",1041206400,3,435,4.891891891891892
561927,3,6303093493,"As a child growing up, I fondly remember going to the matinee in the 1970s to see all of those disaster films such as ""Earthquake,"" ""The Towering Inferno"" and ""Airport 1975,"" starring Charlton Heston more often than not. So the made-for-TV film ""A Thousand Heroes"" seemed like an interesting bet to view on video. I was familiar with the true-life incident -- the 1989 crashing landing of a United Airlines flight in Sioux City, Iowa -- and was interested to see how these dramatic events would be played out.
I was a bit disappointed by the lack of tension for much of this film, undoubtedly limited by the low-budget restraints of the TV movie format. Perhaps the most dramatic scenes in ""A Thousand Heroes"" were the events following the airplane crash, in which rescue workers frantically sift through the horrible wreckage in an attempt to find survivors. When they are greeted by the dazed passengers, walking out of the corn fields in zombie-like fashion, the film reaches its most dramatic moments.
How 180 passengers could have survived this terrible tragedy is beyond me, but certainly the efforts of the pilots and the rescue workers enabled these people to somehow walk away from the wreckage. ""A Thousand Heroes"" portrays these efforts in documentary-like fashion, never choosing to embellish or dramatize. Thus, this film deserves a three-star rating.
I had problems with the tensions in the cockpit, as we are shown a few sweaty brows and darting eyes, but for the most part, the portrayal of the pilots' frantic efforts is anything but exciting. Charlton Heston is probably about 15 years too old to play the part of the head pilot whose cool almost saves the day. Heston's undeniable presence boosts the film never-the-less, though a younger, more intense physical actor may have better served the role. James Coburn is terrific as a salty airport fireman, while Richard Thomas is given the thankless role of the young tenderfoot who trys to whip the rescue team into shape months prior to the incident.
One can't help but respect ""A Thousand Heroes"" as an earnest effort about an extraordinary incident in which man's better self rose to the occasion. The actual story is one of epic drama and nightmarish tension. This film, based on the story, never quite reaches those stirring heights.",987897600,6,2306,4.945876288659794

562036,5,6303093493,"This movie was made for TV and again, it proves that Hollywood could learn a lesson from the small movie makers. This movie blew me away! Okay, so it's not an award winning cast but if you forget ""John Boy"" is in charge and Charlton Heston's presence is a bit large for a TV movie, this story is one you won't forget. And no matter how many times I see the actual crash footage inserted into this movie, I'm still amazed.

And here we are again. Where is the DVD format? There isn't one because this is yet another great movie the execs thought no one would like. If a ""bootleg"" copy comes along, I'll buy it. I'm tired of waiting for brainless executives to get their heads out of their a-- and put the better movies on DVD!",1188518400,3,725,4.215827338129497

562038,4,6303093493,"The 1992 TV film A THOUSAND HEROES (which first aired as CRASH LANDING: THE RESCUE OF FLIGHT 232) recounts the events of July 19, 1989, when United Airlines Flight 232, enroute from Denver to Chicago, suffered a catastrophic engine explosion in mid-flight, which totally disabled its ability to stay airborne.  Captain Al Haynes was forced to bring United 232 in for a very hard landing at Sioux City Airport in Iowa.  The plane blew up and came apart on impact.  But in one of the most miraculous outcomes ever, of the 289 passengers and crew onboard, more than 180 managed to survive the horrific ordeal.
With the exceptions of some slight dramatizations, A THOUSAND HEROES remains true to the essence of the story.  Both veteran director Lamont Johnson and screenwriter Harve Bennett (STAR TREK III) are aided by a solid enough cast.  Charlton Heston is quite good as the heroic Al Haynes (even if his being cast here seems a bit predictable).  James Coburn scores as the tough-as-nails Sioux City airport emergency official who manages to get his team on the tarmac in time; and Richard Thomas, though he doesn't completely escape his ""John Boy"" image from ""The Waltons"", also does good work as the green rookie of Coburn's team.
A story as true as this with a miracle finish would seem tailor-made for the movies, and A THOUSAND HEROES works in that fashion.  But we also see how Haynes and his crew managed to handle their in-flight emergency like the professionals they were, and how the Sioux City ground crew prepared for the kind of emergency that no airport, however big or small, would ever want to have on their hands.  It is a movie well worth seeing for the cast and, most importantly, for this miraculous true story of survival.",1076198400,10,1744,4.751655629139073
562039,4,6303093493,"I was a long-time resident of Sioux City when this happened, and the events are etched on my memory.  This is largely a true recounting of the crash of United 232, with a few variations for dramatic effect.  In my opinion, Al Haynes with Bill Records and Dennis Nielsen were far more heroic than the actors could convey.  There was about an hour of lead time before the actual crash, which gave outlying rescue units from as far as 50 miles away time to arrive and be ready.  Eastern newspeople asked, ""Does Sioux City have an airport large enough to land this plane?  Do they have any hospital facilities?""  Big city prejudice!  Of course, we did.  The airport, in a rural area south of the city, was left over from an air base with long runways built during WWII.  Our hospitals were the best between Omaha and Minneapolis.  What better place to have a crash than where it happened!  Doctors and nurses were ready; helicopters were positioned; traffic was halted.  The movie could have highlighted the most dramatic moment in a more meaningful way--the boy held in the arms of his rescuer.  A statue in a memorial park preserves this moment.  Perhaps a lesser-known actor than Heston would have been better in the role of Captain Al Haynes, if only to emphasize the heroism of the man rather than draw attention to Heston the celebrity.  One can only say that the movie was a good job, but could never approach the level of heroism of everyone who was there that day.",1064361600,16,1469,4.574712643678161
