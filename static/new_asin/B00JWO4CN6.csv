6395374,2,B00JWO4CN6,Interesting premise but the graphics were subpar and I am a fan of GoBots and Transformers the transformation function could have been better especially with the technology that is available now.,1478736000,2,195,5.32258064516129

8654170,1,B00JWO4CN6,"So um; it's a movie. A boring movie. Even that final ""fight"" between Notimus Prime and Knockofftron was boring.",1509494400,,111,4.894736842105263
8654171,1,B00JWO4CN6,"A lot of reviews have pointed out how bad the animation is, but when we say the animation is bad, I think we need to be clear. Most of the movie doesn't seem to be animated at all. When robots are ""talking,"" the scenes are just the camera panning over a 3D model of the ""cars"" while the dialogue plays. No movement of lips or faces or anything. Since much of the movie is just talking, that's going to be the majority of the movie. If you turned the sound off, most of the movie would just be shots of computer-generated cars you could easily confuse for a screensaver. And even those cars are as blocky as a cutscene from a 1990s video game. The animation isn't just bad, it's the laziest computer graphics I've seen in decades. That alone is inexcusable, but with the bad acting and bad story, it means the movie isn't worth your time.",1508025600,,837,4.30379746835443
8654172,1,B00JWO4CN6,"I'd do zero stars if possible. Absolutely terrible. Story is incoherent, music is cheesy and dated, and the animation itself is of the lowest quality I think I've ever seen, by far. The characters are uninspired and the dialogue is excruciatingly lame. I turned this on for my 5 year old son and dozed off. I woke up maybe 10, 15 minutes into it and asked him if he wanted to watch something else. Even he said, and I quote verbatim, ""this show is so stupid."" I genuinely felt bad for subjecting him to this for even 5 minutes. A full hour would have been tantamount to torture.",1507507200,,578,4.361111111111111

8654174,1,B00JWO4CN6,"Storyline was  but everything else, not at all. The graphics were bad, the fight scenes were was subpar, and it was wierd that the only female in the movie was human and that she was able the give birth to robots. The theres the fact that when the transform, they end up up with way to many wheels. For example the star of the film the Prince Regent while in vehicle he has 2x XL wheels & 6x Sm wheels, but after transforming he ends up with 8 extra small wheels to connect the shoulders, arms, and hands. There was not enough focus on the small details.",1503619200,,554,4.177570093457944
