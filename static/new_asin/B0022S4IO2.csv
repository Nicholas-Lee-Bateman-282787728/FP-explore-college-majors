8349658,4,B0022S4IO2,"It is really a shame that this fine movie isn't available on Amazon in a dvd format that will play on most machines.  ""Pushover"" is a fine piece of film noir in the ""dirty cop"" subgenre.

It was made the same year as Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"", and it shares a kind of shady voyeurism with that film.  ""Pushover"" also centers on an apartment complex, but in this movie the police have set-up a stakeout and are watching a gangster's moll (played by Kim Novak in her film debut... which may have influenced Hitch to later cast her in ""Vertigo"").  Fred MacMurray is back in his familiar trench coat as a detective who is seduced by Kim Novak's considerable charms, and hatches a plot to purloin the gangster's bank robbery spoils, which are going to be funneled through Novak's character, whom he has set up in an apartment for that purpose.

This movie has snappy dialogue by Roy Huggins, and a good cast featuring E.G. Marshall, Phil Carey, and Dorothy Malone among others.  It never reaches the heights of something like ""Rear Window"" because Hitchcock cleverly turned an apartment complex into a theater stage, and in ""Pushover"" there is an almost claustrophobic rush of hallway shots.  The movie doesn't have enough good location shots.

But, like ""Rear Window"",  ""Pushover"" did subvert the production code.  In ""Rear Window"", Hitchcock employed an ex-stripper as ""Miss Torso"", for some daring calisthenic poses.  In ""Pushover"", Kim Novak is clearly (as she freely acknowledged) braless in her opening sequences.",1512518400,,1521,4.948818897637795
8349659,4,B0022S4IO2,"Kim Novak and Fred MacMurray shine in this under-the-radar quasi-noir. Also kudos to the fine supporting cast, especially soon-to-be TV Philip Marlowe Phil Carey and Dorothy Malone as his romantic interest. Id never heard of director Richard Quine but he builds the tension well and keeps one guessing while providing some quintessentially noirish visuals along the way. Also commendable is Arthur Morton's smoky, moody score. Inasmuch as its a fairly conventional early Fifties product, for me Pushover ekes out four stars for the high quality of production and the fine cast, especially notable for a glimpse of the very young Kim Novak on the cusp of stardom and showing considerable acting promise which would later be realized in films like Vertigo.",1441756800,,754,5.239669421487603
