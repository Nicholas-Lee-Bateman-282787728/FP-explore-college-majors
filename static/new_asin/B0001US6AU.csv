2024283,2,B0001US6AU,"I am a big fan of Stott Pilates Essential Matwork tapes - I recommend them to all of my Pilates students - but I find that I'd like to issue a BUYER BEWARE about these Stott programs. Every program I've viewed since purchasing the original DVD's are all the SAME EXERICES, the same warm-up breathing info that goes on way too long and takes up a big portion of the program, and that if you have the Essentials DVD's, you have most of what Stott has to offer on DVD at this time.

I'd love to be able to return the new purchases, but if course cannot, now that they've been opened, but I feel that I have wasted my money on the possibility of pretty positions on covers that do not have anything to do with content.",1140652800,64,714,4.173913043478261

8016284,1,B0001US6AU,"I have two separate Stott Pilates dvds, & am very unimpressed with both.  This is especially true for this dvd, because I feel it is misleading.  I saw that this has a difficulty level of 3 & figured it would provide a challenge.  It doesn't at all.  I hope this doesn't sound conceited, because that is not my intent, but I would be less than honest if I didn't say so.  If you are new to fitness this is probably a great workout; however, anyone with any level of fitness beyond beginner shouldn't waste their money.  I'm not sure what criteria Stott uses to rate their workouts , but it certainly seem to be on the easy end of the intensity spectrum. I have found better pilates workouts on youtube. After trying two separate Stott dvds I won't be purchasing anymore of their products.",1489104000,,788,4.4375

8016288,5,B0001US6AU,"Although these are virtually the same exercises as most Stott level one and two workouts, Core Challenge brought me to a new level.  There were actually two exercises I just couldn't do (so I subbed in other Pilates movements), but I definitely felt a new spin on familiar movements.  Since many of the Amazon reviewers of Stott workouts, myself included, complained about the lengthy breathing segments of each workout, I looked up why breathing during Pilates is so important. Focusing on your Pilates and breathing can help to release tension and relax your body. Bringing focus to your breath and posture can help to re-connect your mind with your body. To sit and just focus on your breath can be quite relaxing and calming. If you are relaxed when you exercise there is also less chance that you will injure yourself.

Most of us do not breathe correctly in our every day lives. It is not something that we focus on as move through our days. We take quick shallow breaths, we are tense or stressed sitting and standing with bad posture. Posture can affect our breathing and in return breathing will affect our posture.

When you exhale fully you are expelling old stale gases from deep within your lungs. You are then able to fill your lungs with fresh air and fully oxygenate your blood stream. Pilates breathing will help you achieve this. Breathe deeply as you move through your Pilates positions.

So now you know.  No more complaining about Pilates breathing please.

There are slight differences in each of the familiar movements, differences which add challenge to the core.  Keep in mind, Pilates movements are very effective movements performed with fewer reps that give maximum results.  Stick with it and you'll see.  I highly recommend this next level workout which flowed very well and it wasn't too long (as some of them can be).",1348531200,9,1849,4.822784810126582
8016289,5,B0001US6AU,THis is a great DVD for fibromyalgia. It gives you just enough work out to work the correct muscles and challenges you to gain the strength you need using correct posture. I have used it for about 1 year and it still challenges me.,1263340800,7,231,4.2727272727272725
8016290,4,B0001US6AU,"I agree who said the buyer beware... I have rented mine from the library & agree they seem all the same. This one seems the same as the Firm & Fit, but little added challenge to each pose. The idea is good & well executed cues, etc. but after a few workouts, you feel deja vu.

The chapters/exercises are:

Warm up: breathing, pelvis placement, hip release (straight leg), spinal twist, cat stretch, scupula isolations, rib cage posture, cervical posture, ab prep & breast stroke prep

Exercise: child's pose, hundred, half roll back, roll up, one leg circle, sitting spinal twist, rolling like a ball, ab crunch with 1 straight leg, oblique crunches, double leg stretch, scissors, bridge pose prep, plow, modified plank w/1 leg up, breast stroke, child's pose, saw, open leg roll like a ball, neck pull, oblique reverse crunches, side leg kicks & lifts, sitting straight leg stretch, cobra, swimming, child's pose, plank w/1 leg up, seal, side bends (w/added twist), push ups (reg) & ends w/cross legged side stretch.
