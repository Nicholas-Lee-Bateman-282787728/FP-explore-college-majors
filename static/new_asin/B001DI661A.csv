I was pleasantly surprised. This video runs about 15-20 minutes and does a great job of explaining eminent domain and how it is used. The video focuses on a few controversial cases, including Kelo v. New London. This is a great DVD for the classroom. It is short, concise, and holds your attention. You can see clips of this video on the Izzit website. There is also a great lesson plan on this topic at The Bill of Rights Institute online (look for Supreme Court Cases, Kelo).",1279584000,2,638,4.556521739130435
