8347886,5,B001Y02AC6,"My son loved it! He watched it over and over again. The great thing about Max Lucado films is that it's a great message for the whole family. I prefer this series over Veggietales anyday because it does actually let kids see the meaning of God's word and why they are to follow rules. All of the movies even include a ""game"" at the end basically going over what they learned while watching the movie. If your child is having issues with lying, sharing, being responsible etc...buy a Hermei & Friends movie for them to watch, and you'll definitely see what I'm talking about. First, the child will want to watch it over and over again and then start telling you what the rules are haha but seriously, they're that good!",1390348800,,718,4.488549618320611
8347887,2,B001Y02AC6,My kids really do not care for this DVD.  I have several other Hermie DVDs and they are great but this one just did not impress.,1346457600,,128,3.923076923076923
