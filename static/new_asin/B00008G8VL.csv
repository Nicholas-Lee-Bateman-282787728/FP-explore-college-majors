7983681,1,B00008G8VL,"Maybe I missed it in the description, but this was only 2 miles.  It was the ""edited"" version so did not have the full 4 mile workout.
I sent it back.",1383091200,,150,3.838709677419355
7983682,4,B00008G8VL,I bought this to replace the same video that had broken. Order was quickly received.,1270598400,,84,4.666666666666667
7983683,5,B00008G8VL,"This is a brisk-paced three-mile walk - the tape runs about 45 minutes, including warm-up, cool-down and stretches.  Leslie walks with six of her instructors, and uses weighted gloves (small handweights or wrist weights can be substituted).  Peppy music (including ""The William Tell Overture"") is played at an easy-to-hear sound level, and there is a lot of arm-work in this one.  There is a brief pause after each mile, and for each mile the walkers wear different outfits.  There is a good mix of the usual steps (marching, knee-lifts, side-steps, kicks and kick-backs), and for variety there are doubles of all the steps and taps.  Leslie is the only one talking during this tape, and the giggling and banter is kept to a moderate level (she introduces the walkers only at the end).  She does talk constantly, but it's mostly encouragement and instructions.",1172188800,3,860,4.979020979020979
7983684,5,B00008G8VL,"I have found this walk aerobics video to be the most inspiring, probably because I love the fact that she uses the William Tell Overture (the ""Lone Ranger"" theme) in the second segment.  It really makes you want to keep up the fast pace, and it's nice to have music with a tune to it.  (most of her music is just background stuff, not very inspiring.)  Plus, the weights give you a great workout while you're doing the three miles.  This is the first walk aerobics segment that really seemed to fly by for me, and I feel great at the end.

This is the most motivating of her videos for me; definite thumbs up!",1159056000,2,609,4.260869565217392
7983685,5,B00008G8VL,"I just did the three mile power walk this morning and consider it my favorite of the Leslie Sansone videos. I know folks have commented on her ""chipper"" remarks during the videos, and I admit that a few of them are a bit annoying after several viewings, but this video has little of that annoying chatter and is very enjoyable. I'd recommend this one highly!",1060041600,13,358,4.523076923076923
