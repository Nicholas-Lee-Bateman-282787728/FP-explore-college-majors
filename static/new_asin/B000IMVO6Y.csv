8146376,5,B000IMVO6Y,"Interesting, especially having visited the Vatican and having seen the baptismal font, before reading this story.",1410566400,2,113,6.125
8146377,5,B000IMVO6Y,"This was very interesting. A good ""intro"" to the movie ""Pope Joan"".  I believe it is Diane Sawyer who narrates and interviews
in this special.  (hope I got her name correct)",1379894400,3,173,4.548387096774194
8146378,2,B000IMVO6Y,Disappointed in this TV Special - the movie is better and gives you the same information.  Do not recommend anyone purchasing this if you've seen the last movie production.,1368230400,2,172,4.931034482758621
8146379,5,B000IMVO6Y,"This DVD was excellent.  The topic, The Mystery of Pope Joan, was very well presented, lots of facts and interesting information, along with many other religious authorities and opinions, some pro and some con.  Diane Sawyer is always good and she was on site in Rome talking to people and photographing pieces of art to support the idea that there might have been a female pope. My book club ordered the DVD because we had read the book, Pope Joan, and Diane Sawyer interviewed the author, Donna Wollfolk Cross as part of this special.  It's well worth your while if you're interested in Pope Joan.",1284595200,30,599,4.685714285714286
