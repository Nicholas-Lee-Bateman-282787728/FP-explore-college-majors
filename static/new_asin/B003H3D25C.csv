8396710,1,B003H3D25C,And still have vivid memories of the 2 days spent there. I expected much more from this product and have to say I'm disappointed in the extreme. It's a grade z shambles and those making it should have spent the production costs on a Mars bar instead.,1391040000,,250,4.340425531914893
8396711,5,B003H3D25C,"OK, there are two clear ways of appraising this offering.
1) If your appreciation of the Dead lies in their later work and you are accustomed to high quality, professionally produced recordings then this is absolutely NOT for you. Previous reviews have identified the obvious flaws in this release. The editing is a mess, the actual live footage of the band is limited and horrible things have been done to it. And yeah - Pigpen is seen at the mic when Garcia is singing ""Casey Jones"". A bit of a dog's breakfast and daylight robbery you might conclude given the price.
On the other hand....
2) The above accepted, these two discs combined represent the band at a historic moment. Their first appearance on British soil and still tight in the groove of their most inspired stage of evolution. Only six months since the release of 'Live Dead' and still performing the classic improvisational sequence that was ""Dark Star"" / ""St Stephen"" / ""Lovelight"" - all of which are here in, to my mind, decent sound quality. Furthermore, for serious Deadheads who have appraised the countless audio versions of ""Dark Star"" and particularly those from this (1969-1972) their finest era, this version is arguably right up there with the very best. Garcia's guitar (that stinging psychedelic tone that was never quite the same when he substituted his Gibson SG for the Stratocaster) is here at it's most majestic. Note also that though limited, the visual footage DOES assist in evoking a strong sense of this historic occasion.
So, the choice is yours. For me, as disjointed and amateurish as this release appears, it represents an invaluable record of the Dead at the peak of their collective powers. For ""Dark Star"" alone, this is worth the expense. Don't get bugged about the repeating photographic stills on your screen, just sit back and revel in the brilliance of the playing. The band's reputation expanded well beyond this point in time, but for my money, this and ""Festival Express"" - capturing the Dead just 4 weeks later (and with complete versions of ""New Speedway Boogie"" and ""Easy Wind"") evoke that spirit of the band's music that still sends a cold chill down the spine. Thanks to those at OZIT that put this one together. I just wish I'd been there.",1329696000,,2250,4.816537467700258
8396712,1,B003H3D25C,"Music does not sync with the rotten out of focus video shot behind people's heads. Terrible video probably even for its time. You would have to be a tripping Dead Head to even start to watch this. I love music videos but this is the worst I have ever scene, included CD is of poor quality as well though it looks a work of art compared to the DVD.",1318982400,,347,4.043478260869565
8396713,5,B003H3D25C,The fact someone managed to salvage footage of the Grateful Dead's first performance in the UK deserves a pat on the back for the company issuing this DVD and CD set. Out of synch it might be but then the film crew and sound crew were spiked with acid. You get 17 tracks on the audio cd as well as the 5 tracks of Grateful Dead on the DVD and some great images in the DVD booklet. I collect all films and recording to do with 60s and 70s counter culture and I think it is great that this item has been released. Definitely buy it.,1293494400,5,530,4.009433962264151
8396714,1,B003H3D25C,"Aside from the cover art, this is the most poorly produced DVD I have ever seen being sold. Not only is the audio out of sync with the video as described above, but there is such a limited amount of Grateful Dead video footage from this festival, that the same video clips are recycled and played over and over again. The footage is shot from a distance with a shaky hand on an unfocused camera. I wouldn't even watch a youtube video containing this footage.  My friend is a big festival fan of the 1970 time period. He purchased this thinking he was going to see lots of cool, live footage of music from this festival. After watching it once, he was going to throw it out, but he gave it to me so that I could warn others of its contents. Unless you don't mind throwing money in the garbage, avoid purchasing this DVD. You will first feel disappointed, then cheated, angry and you will want your money back; Guaranteed.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hollywood-Festival-North-West-England-1970/dp/B003H3D25C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hollywood Festival North West England 1970</a>",1283644800,,1120,5.256983240223463
8396715,1,B003H3D25C,"The DVD consists of unwatchable, out-of-focus home movie quality footage that doesn't match the corresponding audio.  For example, the footage shows Pigpen singing during the verses of Casey Jones, which Garcia sang.  The CD is a chopped up, out-of-seqence soundboard recording with several midsong cuts.  Surely there must be better documents of the Dead in 1970.  Save your money!",1274572800,20,382,5.423728813559322

At The Hollywood Festival North West England 1970

As John Peel so rightly says Hollywood Festival and the arrival of the Grateful Dead for their first performance in the UK was a defining moment. The late sixties / early seventies counter culture and music scene in the UK had always aspired to West Coast USA bands and their ideology of large outdoor concerts. North West England with a strong counter culture, arts and music scene would go on after Hollywood Festival in subsequent years to see festival events and large outdoor rock concerts no longer just held in the south of England.

In the same spirit as the Grateful Dead and crowd gathering at Hollywood in1970 the North West would go on to stage Bickershaw Festival 1972 (Grateful Dead again) , Deeply Vale Festivals 1976-1979, Rivington Pike Free Festival 1976 and 1977, the Northern Carnival Against the Nazis, Alexandra Park Manchester 1978, and the Northern Carnival Against Cruise Missiles, Alexandra Park Manchester 1981. Some archive film exists of these other great music/counter culture events and if they haven't been covered yet by DVD they may well be soon. Thanks to the late Mr Burgoyne of Burgoyne Film and Audio Services the audio and the film footage of The Grateful Dead (Free, Family and Screaming Lord Sutch ) at the Hollywood Festival 1970 was recorded for posterity. Added to Mr Burgoyne's film was some footage supplied by Mr Colover. Originally archived by Burgoyne Film and Audio the whole lot was then forgotten for a few years but it has now finally seen the light of day with what bits of Grateful Dead film and stills there were, being integrated with the Burgoyne Grateful Dead sound recording in an artistic way.

This is not a big budget Woodstock movie production but it is an important glimpse at archive film and audio of the Grateful Dead's first visit to the UK. Put together by Burgoyne Film and Audio Services using their archive sound recordings of the event plus their rare film footage combined with Bob Colover's short bits of film and incorporating rare stills of the event what you have is a document of the first time the Grateful Dead came to play in the UK - fairly wacky disjointed film though it is in some parts as someone in the Grateful Dead's entourage spiked everyone involved on filming the event with LSD!!!!.

A bonus CD from the mixing desk is also included of the Grateful Dead's set. The DVD is NTSC region 0. A total of 17 live Grateful Dead tracks, 5 on the film and 12 on the cd. The tracks on the CD are different to those on the DVD""",1273449600,14,3072,4.54249547920434
