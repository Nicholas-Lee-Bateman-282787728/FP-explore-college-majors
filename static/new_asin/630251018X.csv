475218,4,630251018X,"Octopussy is a classic 007 adventure. Ranking up their with From Russia With Love, Goldfinger, and For Your Eyes Only. Moore may not be as good as Connery, but he comes pretty damn close. He's much better than the non-  personality Brosnan. This film has one of the more intelligent plots. Bond  sets out to find who is forging international jewelry. Along the way he  uncovers a plot to detonate a bomb in West Germany, and give Russia a  chokehold on the world. Louis Jordan has never been better and is as good  as Christopher Lee during the Moore years. The train sequence, and the  opening jet plane are highlights. "" All Time High "" is one of my  least favorite theme songs, but it is romantic. At it's worst, this film is  still better than anything Brosnan did.",944092800,4,769,4.482014388489208
475219,3,630251018X,"OCTOPUSSY was the 13th entry into the family of Bond films. I have to admit that this is a good 007 movie. However the thing that I did not like about this film,was the fact that the movie tends to be a bit on the dark  side. Darkness is effective in thrillers,not Bond movies. The plot: this time  007(well played by Roger Moore) travels to India,where he must stop Kamal  Khan(Louis Jourdan),an exiled Afghan prince,from starting a nuclear war. He  joins forces with Octopussy(Maud Adams) to stop Kamal. The opening sequence  with  the jet is okay. The final battle between the secret aget and the  prince is very good. The middle of the film is so-so. Looking back now,it was  the middle that did not attract me that much to the film,but after several  repeated viewings throughout the years made me appreciate this film better  than I have before. The theme song ALL TIME HIGH by Rita Coolidge is one of  the best themes found in a Bond Movie. FOR YOUR EYES ONLY and THE SPY WHO  LOVED ME are better,but many Bond fans place this movie as their Roger  Moore favorite. In my opinion-yours may differ-even A VIEW TO A KILL is  better. However,OCTOPUSSY is more enjoyable than the two first Roger Moore  flops LIVE AND LET DIE and THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN.A must-see for all  fans.",943315200,4,1285,4.521739130434782
475220,4,630251018X,"I have seen all the 007 movies (including The World Is Not Enough, which is AWESOME!) and this was one of the best. It has some cool gadgets, like the yo-yo saw, and an awesome fight on top of an airplane! This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat from the first five minutes!
The Story:  This is Roger Moore's second to last 007 film (A View To A Kill is his last  one), and the 13th movie in the series. At the beginning one of 007's  fellow agents is killed, so Bond travels to India in search of the killer.  There he meets Octopussy, head of a crime empire, who lives on an island  populated by only women! As the movie moves on, we learn there is a far  more serious problem than just a crime ring . . .
I would recommend  buying this film. It is an cool movie, and Amazon.com has a great  price.",943142400,2,810,3.987577639751553
475221,4,630251018X,"Moore finally found his way to play Bond, and made the character his own, not having to compare to Connery now.  Louis Jourdan makes a great villain, and Maud Adams isn't that bad as the Bond woman.  A lot of fun.",940723200,,213,4.170731707317073
475222,3,630251018X,"Despite being a Hardcore Connery & Dalton fan, I must admit that I really enjoyed watching Moore in this 13th Bond adventure. This is certainly one of the Best 3 Bond Movies in which Moore portrayed the  character of the Ultra Suave agent 007, the other 2 remain The Spy who  Loved me and For your eyes only. The movie also bears a Sentimental value  for me as most part of it was shot in my country, India. To Unsolve the  Conundrum behind the mysterious murder of agent 009 holding the priceless  Faberge egg, Bond travels all the way to India where he runs into Kamal  Khan. Octopussy features one of the most Spectacular pre-credit sequences  ever in a Bond Movie when Bond flies the world's smallest Jet pursued by a  heat seeking missile. Bond's hunt for the murderer of 009 leads him to  Cuba, Germany and to India where he comes face to face with Tigers, Snakes  , Crocodiles, Elephants and the beautiful Octopus Cult herself. Helped by a  Live Octopus, Mechanical Crocodile, Female Martial Artists, Bond outwits  Buzz saws, Game-hunters, a bomb and the deadly plot which could destroy the  world. Louis Jordon ( Kamal Khan ) and Kabir Bedi ( Gobinda ) perform a  fair job , nothing special to mention about though. Vijay Amritraj also  gives a decent performance especially during the Rikshaw chase which is  also a pretty good fight sequence. Maud Adams is really impressive as  Octopussy, she was murdered in The man with the Golden Gun.. Moore is  really past his prime by this Movie and should have stopped after this one  and Dalton should have stepped into the next adventure "" A view to  Kill "". Despite Moore's showing age, he looks remarkable during the  fight sequences aboard the Train and on the top of the plane. Nonetheless,  this one really makes us believe that Bond is "" All Time High "".",923443200,4,1813,4.6

We have blue octopuses, fake tarzan scenes, an elephant hunt, the eating of goat eyes, 10,000 hot woman in spandex before it was even fashionable, valuable Russian ""egg"" treasures, moving train fights that have the ""Octopussy"" name on the side of the train. The attention to detail is amazing. Very solid plot continuity and Roger Moore delivers a remarkable performance. I've often wondered if this was his most favorite Bond filming experience. The movie is long so I recommend finding a nice block of time when relaxing and watching, perhaps while cooking, etc. Thank you for reading and hope you enjoy.

475786,4,630251018X,"Roger Moore is superb as Bond.  His renditions are always more tongue in cheek than most of the other Bonds.  Since most of the Bond movies are fairly unbelievable in their entirety, it is refreshing when Moore flavors the scenes with his humor.  Austin Powers did a great job at Spoofing the whole Bond phenomenon.  For instance, the inept henchmen guard, with the Glass jaw, that gets knocked out with one sucker punch, always just at the right time for Bond to escape some crazy trap.  And another instance of over the top screen writing is how instead of just shooting Bond, they always put him in some death trop that he manages to escape from.  But that is why we love it....so why do some of the Bond series try to act so serious?  We all know it is baloney.

Octopussy remains our favorite contrary to what the so called critics have to say.  Always meant to be tongue in cheek, the albeit corny one liners and actions are well placed and humorous, the action non stop and scenery outstanding.  Plenty going on on this movie which seems to end all too soon for the viewer.  All these elements are no longer found in current Bond movies which are clearly attempting too hard to be something they are not and never will be.  Bond is fantasy fiction created purely for entertainment and the inspired and gifted scripts of the Connery/Moore days have long since vanished.  Good quality DVD.",1458432000,8,769,4.824427480916031

475889,5,630251018X,"People like to make fun of Roger Moore as Bond (especially when he's wearing clown make-up, like in this film), and they especially like to make fun of the title of this film, but there's no denying that this is great fun as a film; it's also full of some amazing bonus materials!

After chilling out a bit with For Your Eyes Only, Octopussy throws things into the mix again for more bombast (although not quite as much as Moonraker). As far as plot recycling goes, we've seen it all before - explode a nuclear device to lure the US into a confrontation - but we get a great new location: India!! Great cheezy bazaar battles, quite good bond villains (the Frenchman Louis Jordan and the massive turban-wearing Kabif Bedi), two sweet Bond girls who are NOT killed off (both Swedes again - a repeat visit from Maud Adams, who was killed off by Nick Nack in The Man With The Golden Gun, and the stunningly athletic Kristina Wayborn) snake charming, the incredible hangar scene with the mini jet Acrostar flying in and out, a cheezy Tarzan swing and tiger encounter, elephants, exotic knives, a fascist death camp, and another great train battle, a razor yo-yo (!), knife-throwing twins (!!), and a wild all-girl commando raid on an Indian palace as a somewhat superfluous (but highly satisfying) coda to the film. Also, a visit to Berlin's Checkpoint Charlie in the old Wall days. Even the song, by Rita Coolidge, is a pleasant little love song (possibly the last really good Bond song, actually).

The plot is a bit obscure - you get a dead MI6 agent, a Faberge egg, an auction, a beautiful lady, and complex international intrigue. But it moves along well, and the action scenes are phenomenal!

The film is packed with bonus features. ""Declassified MI6 Vault"" contains ""Shooting Stunts Part 1: Crashing Jeeps"" (3:45), with motorcycle and jeep crashes from multiple angles, with John Glen's commentary. It's amazing that nobody got crushed under a tumbling jeep - it looked incredibly dangerous! The film points out two ""how NOT to do a stunt"" by showing one guy going for a very bad fall, and another getting trapped under an over-turned jeep. The film sometimes had four units!""Shooting Stunts 2: The Airplane Crash(3:25). Pilot-less plane glided over Utah. Great footage of the burning plane. ""Ken Burns on-set movie"" (6:35), silent Super 8 footage from a 16-year-old (at the time) extra at the German border guard scene. The scene was filmed in Peterborough where there's a train museum, and shows the stunt car with a fifth wheel. ""On location with Peter Lamont"" (4:45) scouting locations in late 1981. Fascinating scenes of the Berlin Wall, Checkpoint Charlie, guard towers. ""Testing the Limits - the Ariel Team"" (4:30), testing handholds, jumping off the plane in a group, having fun at 20,000 feet. 'Brolin on Bond"" (4:25) is an interview with James Brolin on the process of being tested as the new Bond as Roger Moore hadn't yet agreed to do the film. They took two or three days for a real screen test, brought Maud Adams in for it (then kept her for the film when Moore signed up for it - he spoke highly of Adams and wanted to have her again). Cubby was testing the idea of using an American as Bond, so Brolin got a lot of his attention - they went to his clubs, his restaurants, his friends' offices, countryside. ""The fight scene screen test"" (1:35), Bond beats up an assassin while answering the phone. ""James Brolin"" and Maud Adams: the love scene screen test"" (3:00) with intro. Re-done scene from ""From Russia With Love"". Brolin mumbles a lot... but at least he has the same initials as Bond! ""James Brolin: the Vijay screen test"" (1:45) with intro - first meeting and snake handling scene; re-done later with Moore for the real film. ""James Bond in India: original 1983 featurette"" (29:20) shows scenes from Udaipur, with a bit of history - it was established in 1559 between Bombay and New Delhi. Snake charmer scene. To camel ""my next leading lady"". Vijay Amritraj's comment on acting in a Bond film - ""it was no easier than playing John McEnroe."" Shiv Niwas Palace Hotel scene with lots of bikini bums. Filming scenes, cheezy action. ""The elephants have better wardrobe and make-up than the actors."" Monsoon Palace. Long stretches without narration, shows multiple takes of the same scenes. Temperature over 110 degrees. Maud Adams on an elephant. Moore jumps into pool in full safari suit, then wanders around in a daze. Weird.

""007 Mission Control"" - as usual, unnecessary item isolating scenes thematically, but with a short ""Exotic Locations"" feature (4:35) narrated by Maud Adams.

""Mission Dossier"" includes ""Inside Octopussy - an original documentary"" (33:00) giving background, explaining that Sean Connery had agreed to do Never Say Never Again, a rival Bond film that was a remake of Thunderball, at the same time, upping the ante for this one (and making Cubby disinclined to re-invent the franchise with a new actor - James Brolin, or perhaps Michael Billington from a brief scene in The Spy Who Loved Me), narrated as so many of these things are by Patrick McNee. Cubby was a tennis fan, so Vijay Amritraj was cast for the film. Moore loved Maud Adams. Louis Jourdan socialised with Cubby. Two Swedes again. Steven Berkoff intense, and amazing anecdotes of the August 22, 1982 hijacking that Peter Lamont was involved with - in the incident, a lone Sikh militant, armed with a pistol and a hand grenade, hijacked an Indian Airlines on a scheduled flight from Mumbai to New Delhi carrying 69 persons; Indian security forces killed the hijacker and rescued all passengers). Lots of bashful comments about the title, Octopussy, although no one can ignore the fact that it was Ian Fleming's idea, and Kristina Wayborn noted that ""Once you get used to it, it's really not that bad."" The Acrostar jet was considered for Moonraker, but didn't make it. Some of the scenes in India had unscripted parts due to crowd control difficulties, such as the fellow on the bicycle who rides between battling jeeps in the getaway scene. Martin Grace was a stunt double for James Bond who was involved in a horrible accident when he was hanging onto the side of the train in Peterborough, hit a concrete pylon and spent six months in hospital with a broken arm and leg, and a shattered hip. Cold Pinewood for the final battle shoot. Yo-yoer broke his arm for one stunt, came back with a cast for re-shoots. Cheezy Tarzan swings. Bloopers in closing credits and stunts, Moore's pool gag. ""Designing Bond - Peter Lamont"" is about set designer Peter Lamont and his family (brother and son) who were involved with Ken Adam, and later without him, on films from The Man With The Golden Gun to The World Is Not Enough."" This section also contains Rita Coolidge's video for ""All Time High"", with scenes of her and scenes from the film. Two storyboard sequences cut between scenes from the film and the actual storyboards: ""The Taxi Chase"" (3:32) and ""Bond Rescues Octopussy"" (3:20).

""Ministry Of Propaganda"" only contains a ""Theatrical Archive"" with four trailers: ""I'm Octopussy"" (1:30), with Acrostar scenes and highlighting Kristina Wayborn as Magda, and a new ""What I do for England"" line from Moore, hamming it up in bed with his starlet. ""Let me tease you"" (1:50) emphasises Eon Productions' history with Bond. ""Nobody Does  Him Better"" (1:30), an apparent jab at Sean Connery and his rival film, and ""Bond Hits An All-Time High"" (3:30).

The only real disappointment among the bonus features is the crappy photo archive at the end, although the superfluous ""intro"" is pretty sexy. You get pics of Roger Moore (5), Maud Adams (7), Louis Jordan (2), Louis Jourdan (2), Steven Berkoff (2), Kabir Bedi (3), David and Anthony Mayer (3), Lois Maxwell and Desmond Llewelyn (3), Acrostar (7), Octopussy's Circus (4), The Most Dangerous Game (7), Q's Tricks (4), Russian War Room (2), India (10), The Train (7), At the Circus (4), Final Battle (8), The Producer (1), Marketing (2). Most Bond films provide plenty of marketing materials, I don't believe there's been one yet that skimped so badly by only showing two movie posters!!",1449360000,,8139,4.825214899713467
475890,4,630251018X,"For 3/4th of this movie it is easily one of Roger Moore's best Bond movies.  The bad opening music aside (probably the worst out of all the Bond movies.)  The film really does have it all intrigue, action, suspense, gadgets, beautiful women and a good premise.

I loved the opening sequence in Cuba and the other 00 agent in the clown suit chase scene.  The plot really is good for a spy movie.  I am not to big a fan of the circus, but I thought this movie did a great job keeping up all the tension and suspense throughout the movie.  I thought the rogue power hungry Russian General Orlov played by Steven Berkoff did an excellent job.  If only the final climax would have been more believable and not done on a tiny bi plane This would definitely be a 5 star movie.  Unfortunately the end sequence is so over the top ridiculous and unbelievable that it really hurts the overall movie.

I still find Octopussy much more interesting than Sean Connery's rogue Bond film Never Say Never again, just something about that film always seemed to lag where Octopussy is exciting and interesting until the last part of the film.  I would rate the film at a high 3 1/2 to 4 stars it is easily watchable and Roger is in top form after coming off the excellent For Your Eyes Only.  Octopussy could have been great if they just would have reshot that final sequence on land or in the fortress keep instead of what they used.",1447891200,,1414,4.379310344827586

For those not around in 1983, or too young to remember, Nuclear disarmament and Nuclear freezes were much discussed by politicians. The latter seemed to be the main concern of 1984 Democratic Presidential candidates during primary season.

Back to Octopussy. The movie is a good but mixed bag of a film.

476044,5,630251018X,"Is OCTOPUSSY Roger Moore's best James Bond film? Perhaps. In all director John Glen's OCTOPUSSY is a good Bond film. Director Glen's second unit work on ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE is well documented. His excellence shows her in OCTOPUSSY. John Glen's enormous contributions to the Bond series seem to have gone unsung and somehow forgotten. Let us not forget.

OCTOPUSSY is probably Roger Moore's best Bond movie. It is a richly textured film beautifully photographed and full of rich and detailed production designs. It seems like a throwback to the 60s style of filmmaking. The pace is slower and deliberate and the dialogue seems to have subtler wit interspersed. It has an overall nostalgic feel about it. The opening is excellent as we see Bond the spy infiltrate a banana republic air base. Bond escapes via a Bede Acrostar mini jet aircraft with a guided missile in hot pursuit.

The score by John Barry is a little sparse and sporadic but still rich in structure and flavor. Barry utilized ""The James Bond Theme"" more for this Roger Moore outing than he did for his other scores for the Moore Bonds. He did do an outstanding job scoring the scenes involving the Soviets, which had that eastern block flavor similar to his score for THE QUILLER MEMORANDUM.

To its credit, the film uses elements from the short stories ""Octopussy"" and ""The Property of a Lady"" by Ian Fleming in a sentimental throwback to earlier Bonds. FOR YOUR EYES ONLY filmed just before this one, also used some of Fleming's original writings for inspiration. In that one Bond as the shark bate in-tow was taken directly from Fleming's novel ""Live and Let Die.""

Louis Jourdan as Kamal, in a very underrated performance, is excellent and is one of the best villains of the series. He is Bond's counterpart nemesis. It was also good to see many of the regular cast members return for this one. Desmond Llewelyn as ""Q"" seemed to return to his old self as he had established prior to DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. Walter Gotell as Gogol, Geoffrey Keen as the Minister of Defense, Eva Reuber-Staier as Rublevitch, Jeremy Bullock as Smithers and Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny all reprised their roles much more effectively and reminiscent to the style of the earlier Bonds. Robert Brown replaced Bernard Lee as the beloved ""M."" We all missed Bernard.

The film goes a little over-the-top near the end having Octopussy's troupe of beautiful amazons attack Kamal's Monsoon Palace. Then the film really goes over-the-top and under-the-top as Bond crawls all over Kamal's Beechcraft Model 18 Super H18 as it dives, loops and tailspins. I don't see anything wrong with that. This is one of the better James Bond films of the series. Great John Barry score.",1414972800,,2723,4.84731182795699

476103,3,630251018X,"NOTE: This review is based on the 1-Disc DVD, which is the version of the film I watched.

By the early 1980s, Roger Moore had grown tired of playing James Bond, and the result was a handful of films that, at times, appeared to be going through the motions. ""Octopussy"" was Moore's next-to-last effort as 007, and his second-worst  effort as well. Only one of the franchise's better villains, the usual excellent Bond stuntwork, and the equally usual excellent DVD bonus features make this movie marginally worth recommending.

Many of the Bond films have weak plots, but this one is especially lightweight. Oddly, the original screenplay draft was written by noted novelist George MacDonald Fraser, author of the ""Flashman"" books. The wit and style Fraser showed in the ""Flashman"" books is sadly missing here; his only contribution seems to be suggesting various authentic Indian locations in which to shoot. The actual plot of ""Octopussy"" concerns a scheme by an insane Russian general (Steven Berkoff) to set off a nuclear bomb at a U.S. Air Force base in West Germany, in an effort to cause the United States to remove its nuclear weapons from Germany, paving the way for a successful Soviet invasion (this was the Cold War era, after all). The general has enlisted the aid of a mercenary Afghan, Kamal Khan (Louis Jourdan) who has, in turn, enlisted the aid of a group of sexy female smugglers led by the titular Octopussy (Maud Adams).

In reality, the plot of ""Octopussy"" is merely an excuse to string together the obligatory set pieces, seduction scenes, fancy gadgets, and Bondian quips. Both the humor and the women are exceptionally lightweight here. Adams is attractive enough, but there's no spark between her and Moore, and her dramatic scenes come off flat as well. The jokes are even worse than the romance. In perhaps the lowlight of the entire 40-year Bond franchise, Moore (or, more accurately, his stuntman) swings on vines to the sound of Johnny Weismuller's Tarzan yell. When Moore does make an effort to be serious, such as when he vows revenge for a slain fellow agent, he reacts as if he were peeved to have been served an undercooked steak.

Fortunately, Louis Jourdan (who wanted to play a Bond villain) is perfect as the urbane, nearly unflappable Kamal Khan. Moore was known as the suavest Bond, but Jourdan easily outdoes him in their scenes together. Jourdan avoids histrionics at all times, letting his disdain and anger at being crossed show by means of the subtlest body language. Kamal Khan is one of the best Bond villains, and by far the most charming, of the Bond villains.

""Octopussy"" features a number of well made action sequences and three near spectacular ones. In the pre-title sequence, Bond steals a miniature jet plane, and there's a lengthy chase in which the jet is pursued by a surface-to-air missile trying to home in on it. Director John Glen was more or less a second unit director elevated to first unit status for the Bond films, and his attention to detail and eye for striking stunt visuals are evident here. Later, there's a lengthy chase scene on, and mostly above, a speeding train, and finally, a really stunning finale in which Bond and Khan's chief henchman (Kabir Bedi) fight on the roof of a Beechcraft Bonanza aircraft thousands of feet above the ground.

The DVD of ""Octopussy"" offers the usual extensive bonus features for Bond films. There's an audio commentary by director Glen, a 20-minute feature on production designer Peter Lamont, and a 35-minute documentary on the making of the film. Both the documentary and Glen's commentary explain in detail how some of the action sequences were filmed, using a combination of miniatures, optical illusion camera trickery, and some very talented and courageous stunt people (one of whom was badly injured during the train sequence). In contrast to today's action films in which directors routinely spend millions for unconvincing second and third rate CGI effects, the action sequences in ""Octopussy"" appear far more exciting and realistic.

By the time ""Octopussy"" was made in 1983, Albert Broccoli's production company had streamlined the Bond franchise into a slick professional assembly line operation that rivaled the Hollywood studios of the 1930s. It is that professionalism and attention to detail in all the technical aspects of the film that prevent this otherwise leaden effort from being a disaster. It's that same professionalism that makes the set pieces in ""Octopussy"" still worth watching today. As far as 007 himself is concerned however, Roger Moore's license to kill was rapidly approaching its expiration date.",1407110400,,4645,5.007772020725389

This film, ""Octopussy"" from 1983, is another Bond film starring Roger Moore. He was quite good as Bond but not up to Sean Connery. No one has been and never will. It's a pretty good film with some really awesome stunts. It's always exciting when James Bond is involved!",1400889600,,403,4.445945945945946
476110,3,630251018X,"Roger Moore's sixth James Bond film, ""Octopussy"" really is only memorable for two reasons.  One, it prevailed over Sean Connery's ""Never Say Never Again"" in the 1983 box office Battle of the Bonds.  More importantly, it should have provided Moore a classy, graceful exit retiring from his signature role.  Following a barely adequate pre-credits sequence set in Cuba, Moore's Bond traces a murdered 00 agent's link to a fake Faberge egg to India where he tangles with ruthless Prince Kamal Khan (Louis Jordan).  Included in this mix is a warmonger Russian general (Steven Berkoff) seeking to ignite an international crisis with a bomb attack on an U.S. military base in Germany.  Bond's glamorous and unexpected ally is the alluring circus owner (and smuggling queen) ""Octopussy"" (Maud Adams), who has her own issues with Prince Kamal.

""Octopussy"" offers superb locales (especially in India), but the movie too often drags for long stretches.  Even the gentle theme song ""All Time High"" by Rita Coolidge proves merely serviceable in giving the movie some spark.  The most significant flaw is that the 56-year old Moore simply appeared worn out here.  His credibility in the action scenes (i.e. atop a train and later Kamal's getaway plane) has never been worse (at least, until ""A View to a Kill."")  Case in point: Bond's campy Johnny ""Tarzan"" Weissmuller yell during the safari hunt is worth a chuckle.  The problem is that it only reminds viewers how desperate the Bond franchise had become pushing juvenile humor to help disguise Moore's lack of credibility as an action hero.  Still, what salvages ""Octopussy"" from mediocrity is Moore's terrific romantic chemistry with glamorous Maud Adams, not to mention a decent storyline.

Obviously, ""Octopussy"" should have been Moore's fond farewell to the Bond franchise.  The charming final scene would have been an appropriate going-away present to his fans.  Of Moore's seven Bond films: this one still ranks third best behind 1977's ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" and 1981's ""For Your Eyes Only.""  Suffice to say, at least ""Octopussy"" is a much better effort than Moore's last 007 caper, 1985's truly dreadful ""A View to a Kill.""

Rating: 3 /5 stars. ""Octopussy"" is still pretty watchable, but it's often a long 130 minutes.",1400198400,,2266,5.081081081081081

You can't go wrong with Jane Seymour.  It even works out for Jaws in 'raker.  Checkout ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service,"" ""GoldenEye"" (and at least the first half of ""Tomorrow Never Dies""), ""Goldfinger,"" and ""Casino Royale"" for the other Bonds' staple pictures.  I only ever saw the Dalton Bonds once but one of them is good and one of them has Benicio Del Toro, I can't remember if it's the same one that's good.

476136,3,630251018X,"This is another Roger Moore outing as James Bond.  This was also the year that other studios competed with series producer Cubby Broccoli with the same character.  A handful of studios and distributors, including Warner Bros. released ""Never Say Never"" with Sean Connery returning as Bond with an offer he couldn't refuse.

""Octopussy"" is the nickname for an international smuggler (Maud Adams) who lives on an exotic island with nothing but other women.  A situation that might have a different connotation today.  She also has other ""legitimate"" businesses including a travelling circus.  Why not?  Her manager is Kamal Khan (Louis Jordan, out of his element).  He's outwardly loyal but also has a side gig going on with a wacko Soviet general named Orlov (Seven Berkoff).  He's one of those throwbacks who wants the Soviets to rise to great power and not by ""talking"" with the U. S. and its allies.  His plan is to detonate a bomb loaded onto circus train that will be travelling from East Berlin to West Berlin to entertain U. S. military troops and their families at an Air Force base.

Khan doesn't care about the casualties, he just wants the chest of Russian jewelry originally being smuggled.  Bond of course has bedded a couple of beauties along the way to get to Octopussy who naturally, caves under Bond's romantic spell.  Moore looks the role but this film is pretty boring for most of the time.  And I don't think I can ever get past seeing 007 in a clown outfit.  Sorry.  Still, there are a couple very good stunt sequences.  One at the beginning but especially at the end when Bond jumps onto a plane about to take off.  He has to fight off a hulking Khan bodyguard (Kabir Bedi) outside the plane and survive with Octopussy in tow before the plane decends with Khan at the controls.

Long time tennis fans might recognize former Indian great, Vijay Amritraj as a MI:6 agent who helps Bond.  The usual Bond regulars are also out in full force.  Overall this is a marginally acceptable Bond outing.  Not the worst but well short of the best.

The new Blu ray restoration, however, is one of the best in the series.  I was trying this film out in a smaller room using some new equipment including a new display.  My teenage kid walked in and said, ""That looks pretty good.""  Yes it does.  Using a 1080p resolution and the original 2.40:1 aspect ratio, the visuals are exemplary.  Colors and hue really sparkle.  Everything is clear and accurate as near as I could discern.  An appropriate amount of film grain remains.  The transfer is free of dirt, specs and other artifacts.  Well done.  Likewise the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track is clear and properly handled.  Dialog is clear and centered.  I was looking for a bit more out of the surrounds but maybe I just need to tweak my system a bit.  This is a vast improvement over the DVD in all technical aspects.

The action is first-rate but there are some silly aspects to the film, bumbling and horny gangs of thugs, a vine-swinging Bond yelling like Tarzan, an island of women, and some silly stunt scenes featuring a tennis racket, a fake tiger leaping through the jungle, Bond saving the day in a clown suit, and Bond in a fake alligator. The focus here is incredible action and fantasy with a bit of realism thrown in for good measure.

The film itself opens with a great pre-credit sequence featuring Bond masquerading as a Cuban officer out to destroy a new missile guidance system.  Bond makes his escape in the Acrostar, a tiny jet plane.  The real-life jet was scheduled to be used in the film, Moonraker but was delayed.  It is one of the neater Q-issued pieces of equipment.  The original Maurice Binder opening credits feature lasers and the usual bevy of gorgeous women. The film opens with an effective scene of Agent 009 (dressed as a clown) being pursued and slain by twins clad in red. The dead agent is holding a fake Faberge egg.  It seems someone is making fake Faberge eggs and Mi-6 has been asked to intervene.  M (now being well-played by Robert Brown) assigns Bond to attend the auction of a real egg at Sotheby's Auction House. Bond switches out the real egg with the fake one retrieved from Agent 009.  Miss Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell) now has an assistant, Penelope Smallbone (Michaela Clavell (James Clavell's daughter).  In the Soviet homeland, General Gogol (Walter Gotell) is dealing with the maverick and belligerent General Orlov (Steven Berkoff) who is calling for war as his country considers disarming.  The Soviet war Room is a spectacular set. It seems that General Orlov is behind the fake eggs and one of his counterparts is Kamal Khan, a suave Afghan prince (Louis Jourdan).  Kamal Khan and Bond first meet over a heated high-stakes backgammon game (ah, what a difference 20 years makes). This scene pays homage to the card game in Goldfinger. Khan is guarded by his huge henchman, Gobinda (Kabir Bedi) who crushes a pair of dice (another homage to Goldfinger in which Oddjob crushed a golf ball).  The other villain is Octopussy (Swedish actress, Maud Adams) whose right hand is Magda (another Swedish actress, Kristina Wayborn) who beds down Bond to steal the Faberge egg he switched at the auction.  Bond soon discovers that Khan is involved with Orlov in the switching of eggs.  He also discovers a connection with the reclusive Octopussy whose father, a British major was discovered and aided by Bond.  Octopussy listens to Bond and agrees to help him in thanks for his treatment of her father.  The movie rolls along and it soon becomes apparent that Khan and Orlov plan to betray Octopussy.  Bond must deal with the two twin acrobats who killed Agent 009 and stop the explosion of a nuclear bomb on the US military base in West Germany where the Octopussy Circus is performing.  The plan to blame the US for the use of nuclear weapons is the brainchild of Orlov and Kahn.  Orlov plans to be the heroic Russian who expands Soviet rule in response to the nuclear detonation and Khan hopes to parlay the stolen eggs into millions.  Once the betrayal is apparent, Bond (and Q) lead a bevy of Octopussy's Amazonian acrobats (woman who have been used and betrayed by men)in an assault on Khan's mountain castle (a nod to On Her Majesty's Secret Service).  The movie climaxes with an incredible fight between Gobinda and Bond on top of Khan's in-flight plane.  In the end, Bond saves the day and gets the girl, Octopussy.

This film is pure escapist fun and needs to be appreciated as such.  This film nicely fits into the traditional Bond film series.

Special Notes: Maud Adams is the only actress to appear as a lead actress in the Bond series. The film owes a lot to Dr. No, Goldfinger, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and The Spy Who Loved Me because of characters, stunts and the maniacal plan to pit the East versus the West.",1379635200,,4351,4.728476821192053

476178,5,630251018X,"This is probably Roger Moore's best Bond movie. It is a richly textured film beautifully photographed and full of rich and detailed production designs. It seems like a throwback to the 60s style of filmmaking. The pace is slower and deliberate and the dialogue seems to have subtler wit interspersed. It has an overall nostalgic feel about it. The opening is excellent as we see Bond the spy infiltrate a banana republic air base. Bond escapes via a Bede Acrostar mini jet aircraft with a guided missile in hot pursuit.

The score by John Barry is a little sparse and sporadic but still rich in structure and flavor. Barry utilized ""The James Bond Theme"" more for this Roger Moore outing than he did for his other scores for the Moore Bonds. He did do an outstanding job scoring the scenes involving the Soviets, which had that eastern block flavor similar to his score for THE QUILLER MEMORANDUM.

To its credit, the film uses elements from the short stories ""Octopussy"" and ""The Property of a Lady"" by Ian Fleming in a sentimental throwback to earlier Bonds. FOR YOUR EYES ONLY filmed just before this one, also used some of Fleming's original writings for inspiration. In that one Bond as the shark bate in-tow was taken directly from Fleming's novel ""Live and Let Die.""

Louis Jourdan as Kamal, in a very underrated performance, is excellent and is one of the best villains of the series. He is Bond's counterpart nemesis. It was also good to see many of the regular cast members return for this one. Desmond Llewelyn as ""Q"" seemed to return to his old self as he had established prior to DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. Walter Gotell as Gogol, Geoffrey Keen as the Minister of Defense, Eva Reuber-Staier as Rublevitch, Jeremy Bullock as Smithers and Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny all reprised their roles much more effectively and reminiscent to the style of the earlier Bonds. Robert Brown replaced Bernard Lee as the beloved ""M."" We all missed Bernard.

The film goes a little over-the-top near the end having Octopussy's troupe of beautiful amazons attack Kamal's Monsoon Palace. Then the film really goes over-the-top and under-the-top as Bond crawls all over Kamal's Beechcraft Model 18 Super H18 as it dives, loops and tailspins. I don't see anything wrong with that. This is one of the better James Bond films of the series.

In all director John Glen's OCTOPUSSY is a good Bond film. Director Glen's second unit work on ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE is well documented. His excellence shows her in OCTOPUSSY. John Glen's enormous contributions to the Bond series seem to have gone unsung and somehow forgotten. Let us not forget.",1378684800,,2636,4.823008849557522

476222,3,630251018X,"By 1983 it wasn't just the female characters with double entendre` names, it was the film itself. Roger Moore was persuaded to return for a sixth Bond as producers were reluctant to introduce a new actor as James Bond the same year that Sean Connery was making a comeback as Bond in a rival production.

Despite his skin and hair piece starting to loosen,mid-fifties Moore holds up well as does Maud Adams who becomes the only two time Bond girl to play two different characters and as smuggler queen title character in this outing that she lends some class to. Robert Brown takes over as Bond's boss M, Desmond Llewellan's gadget master Q has a bigger role as do the gadgets themselves.

This film brings them back in spades, you get a horses ass that turns into a jet plane, a turbo powered tuk tuk and a alligator shaped mini sub. They gadget laden set pieces nearly take away from the guest actors, but not quite. Frenchy Louis Jordan plays the suave, villainous Indian warlord Kamal Khan, helping out Steven Berkoff's nut-job Russian general trying to stop Russian nuclear disarmament. His giant

The convoluted plot makes passing preference to Fleming short stories Octopussy and Property Of A Lady and waltzes through many colourful locales from India to East Germany and Austria. The pace is strong and the level of chases by car, train, foot, boat, horse, elephant, plane or hot air balloon, not to mention the fights, seem to be non stop with a bit of story exposition thrown in here and there.

As always the Bond DVD's are very comprehensive, it's documentary covers every facet of production and chats with most of the actors. Picture and sound are ace as usual, clean as clean and all bits of trivia picked out for this release is great. If only this good but forgettable entry could have been Roger's swansong it would have been better remembered.

 In Octopussy Bond follows around a general who is stealing expensive jewels from the Russian government which leads him to a welathy Afgan prince and his partner in crime named Octopussy.

 Maude Adams holds the distinction as being the only ""Bond girl"" to return in a James Bond film, although in this outing she plays a villin.

476403,5,630251018X,"This is only one of my favorite James Bond films. Probably because I like films filmed in India.

However, I understand that it's not on Blu-Ray yet, so I'll probably just wait for the complete box set comes out before I buy any of the 007 films on Blu-Ray.

I can just see that happening: I'd buy the few 3 movie box sets of 007, and then they would finally release a box set of all the James Bond films at a first release low cost, probably cheaper than the few boxes available now, combined.

I'll wait.  Heck yes, I'll wait for the inevitable box set, yet to come.

UPDATE: Yes, it was part of the big blu-ray box set, ""Bond 50"", and the price I paid was only $149 plus tax.

Both us and the entire crowd in the theater were massively enjoying it and everyone walked out greatly satisfied.  Now I read articles decrying it as a terrible Bond film and I am mystified.  It is one of my five favorite Bonds.  This film is fun from start to finish with a great pre-credits sequence and terrific action sequences to enliven the entire film.  Maud Adams returns to the Bond films in leading-lady status after appearing as the secondary female lead in the disappointing ""Man with the Golden Gun.""  (Moore has stated in interviews that Maud Adams was his favorite leading lady.)  Louis Jourdan is suitably slimy as the lead villain and Steven Berkoff is positively psychotic as the crazed Russian General trying to set off a nuclear device on a U.S. Air Force base in Germany.  (This film was filmed during the time of constant demonstrations throughout Europe for a ""nuclear freeze"" and this works its way into the plot.)  Much has been written in a negative manner about Moore in clown makeup trying to deactivate the bomb as the seconds tick away.  (Bond has to hide in a clown costume to get onto the air force base where Octopussy's circus is performing.)  I think the make-up just adds to a very suspenseful scene.  I have never understood the controversey it has engendered.  (Most people who write about it just hate Moore's Bond in general and feel this gives them more ammunition.)  The location work in India, like most Bonds, is excellent.  This features the customery excellent John Barry Score and a nice theme song ""All Time High"" sung by Rita Coolidge.
This film opened in the June of 1983 and did great business.  The highly overrated Sean Connery Bond ""Never Say Never Again"" opened in September 1983 and did good business also, only not as good as ""Octopussy.""  At the time the critics went bananas raving about the Connery Bond and had a great time bashing the Moore Bond.  It is poetic justice that ""Octopussy"" did better business and now ""Never Say Never Again"" has been reevaluated as the absolute mediocrity it always was, a film Warner Bros. was ready to pull the plug on in mid-production, had Connery not taken matters into his own hands and held the production together.  Moore has stated in his recent autobiography the satisfaction he received when ""Octopussy"" grossed more than ""Never Say Never Again."" I guess it gets tiresome being bashed as Bond after starring in 7 greatly successful Bond films.
Anyway, for some reason, people like to still bash ""Octopussy.""  As previously stated, I don't understand why and feel it is a marvelously entertaining Bond film.  This, like all the recent Moore Bonds, had an audio commentary by Roger.  We are still waiting for the blu-ray release, I hope it comes soon.",1266624000,9,2817,4.764948453608247

Moore's films were far more true to Ian Flemming and the entire spirit of Bond, but Ian Fleming probably never would have imagined his cold war spy/lady killer would evolve into so many movies and even go so far as to have Craig be 007 at the beginning of his career.

So you go from a 1950's viewpoint of spying in the cold war where pen lights and silencers were high tech to Craig's Bond of 2005+ with computers, cell phones, different first loves, and shaken, not stirred is a scorned phrase.

The good thing is if you like Spy films and 007, there should be a Bond that suit's your fancy. I'm sure moving from Sean Connery to Moore was seen as a farce and disaster as well.",1243209600,2,855,4.298136645962733

Octopussy, as redundant and annoying as its title, runs 133 minutes, 45 of which consist of plot setting up. As for the ""plot"", it completely rips off Indiana Jones. The location in India is pretty fascinating, but that's where the fascination stops. Moore plays a sweaty and tired Bond here, and toward the end, we're left rolling our eyes and scratching our heads. As for the ending showdown on the plane... ridiculous and over the top. There IS a reason For Your Eyes Only's opening scene was ridiculous, but here it just is never pulled off.

What gives this 2 stars and not one is the Indian location and the music score.

I know that most Bond fans view the films for their action, and yes there is some decent action sequences here, but this film doesnt even come close to the first five Bond films, which were all four to five star efforts. Even the weaker movies of the series such as Moonraker, A view to A Kill, Diamonds are Forever, and The ""Timothy Dalton"" films that most seem to dislike, are head and shoulders or this stinker. This is the worst Bond of the entire series. Even though there is some decent action sequences, Missing is a good solid story, location, and women (there isn't a female character that stands out).

476438,5,630251018X,"Roger Moore's stint as James Bond lasted a whopping 12 years from 1973 to 1985, which is the longest term for any actor in the Bond role (not including Sean Connery's one-shot unofficial return in ""Never Say Never Again""). Moore started as Bond when he was 45 years old and ended when he was 57. The seven films he did are as follows:

LIVE AND LET DIE (1973)
THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN (1974)
THE SPY WHO LOVED ME (1977)
MOONRAKER (1979)
FOR YOUR EYES ONLY (1981)
OCTOPUSSY (1983)
A VIEW TO A KILL (1985)

All seven films were hugely popular at the box office, which explains why they kept making 'em every two years.

In the summer of 2003 I unbiasedly saw most of the Bond films (the ones I didn't see I was already well familiar with, like DR. NO and GOLDFINGER). I fully realize that many Bond fans look down on Moore's stint, no doubt because there was too much camp in most of his films, but I ultimately concluded that the Moore Bond pictures are the most consistently entertaining. In fact, there's not a dud in the bunch; even the heavily maligned MOONRAKER is great! The Connery films were more serious (always a good thing), with the exception of DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER, and Sean is certainly the quintessential Bond figure, but I gotta admit that -- for some strange reason -- I ENJOY Roger Moore's stint as Bond more than any of the others.

Some argue that by the time of OCTOPUSSY Moore was too ""long in the tooth,"" but I simply don't see that. He may have been 55 years old when OCTOPUSSY was released and 57 when A VIEW TO A KILL came out, but it didn't matter. Moore ALWAYS looked perfectly convincing as James Bond, whatever his age.

As to the story, is it really necessary to go into detail about the plot of OCTOPUSSY? Every Bond film features a main villain and a few accomplices/subordinates who want to cause great havoc; Bond defies death at every turn and runs into numerous beautiful women as he moves from one exotic locale to another trying to figure out the villains' scheme and stop it.

OCTOPUSSY was filmed on location in India, East Germany & England; these locations are, needless to say, fabulous. We also get circuses, clowns, trains, mad Russian militarists and bombs-about-to-explode.

One thing that distinguishes OCTOPUSSY is that it has more of an Indiana Jones appeal than any other film in the series, which stands to reason since Indiana Jones was hugely popular at the time (RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK came out two years earlier in 1981 while THE TEMPLE OF DOOM came out one year after OCTOPUSSY in 1984). Anyway, this is a good thing.

The ""Bond women"" featured in OCTOPUSSY are Sweden's own Maud Adams and Kristina Wayborn. I personally never found Maud very appealing, and although Kristina certainly has an exotic charm, she never did anything for me either. I prefer more curvy women; women with more meat on their bones (like in THUNDERBALL, which is the BEST Bond film as far as beautiful women goes). Regardless, I'm sure there are a lot of guys out there who find Adams and Wayborn incredibly ravishing. In any event, there are numerous other women in the film like Midge, the short brunette with full hair, and the East Indian beauty that aids Bond during the opening teaser.

FINAL ANALYSIS: You either like James Bond films or you don't. You either like Roger Moore as James Bond or you don't. Although, most of the time, their plots will make your head spin, they're nothing deep. You won't derive any nuggets of wisdom from these films. They're essentially mindless adventure flicks highlighted by exotic locales and beautiful women whose express purpose is to entertain, not enlighten. It's escapist fantasy/adventure pure and simple.

THE SPY WHO LOVED ME is usually cited as the best Moore-era Bond picture (which I only partially agree with -- see my review), but OCTOPUSSY ranks pretty high as well (although I generally rate them all about equally). As with most of Moore's Bond films, OCTOPUSSY strongly flirts with camp here and there, but it's essentially a serious story. It has a bit of an Indiana Jones flare and features India, Germany, scheming Russian militarists, gorgeous women, incredible action sequences, circuses, clowns, bombs and trains gallore. What moore could you want in a Bond picture? That's WHY it rates 5/5 Stars IMHO.

Get the 2-disc Ultimate Edition if you want the extras/documentaries, including screen test footage of James Brolin trying out as Bond (who was rejected in favor of Moore, of course). The single disc edition DOES NOT have these extra features.",1215820800,2,4552,4.720403022670025
476439,2,630251018X,"Facing up against a rival Bond project for the first time since You Only Live Twice - and one with Connery attached to boot - the obvious expectation was that once again the Broccoli camp would pull out all the stops and come up with one of the best Bond films yet. Instead, this is the one where they threw in the towel and began copying others rather than leading the pack.

For Your Eyes Only had gone head-to-head with Raiders of the Lost Ark and come off the worse. As a result, Octopussy shamelessly copies its market chase and truck sequences to remarkably little interest or excitement. Even the location seems second-hand - in 1982-3 you couldn't move for film crews in India, what with Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, The Far Pavilions, The Jewel in the Crown, Gandhi and Heat and Dust all reviving the Raj. Only one sequence, with a deadly yo-yo (usually heavily cut in the TV prints), works - and then only briefly.

Worse still, this one drags its feet more than any other entry in the series, with very long waits between very lacklustre setpieces. The plot is similarly uninvolving. With a similar hook to The Fourth Protocol, but nowhere near as good (and The Fourth Protocol isn't exactly a masterpiece), this is so alarmist it's a wonder Broccoli didn't hand over the producing reins to Euan Lloyd. Maud Adams makes a poor job of the title role, but Steven Berkoff is completely off the scale as the renegade Russian villain. With the diction of a demented Dalek and the subtlety of a Spitting Image puppet, it's quite an achievement to sit through any of his scenes without squirming in embarrassment.

The cheapest looking Bond film, it is doubtful that anyone would have gone to see such a geriatric action movie without the Bond name attached. The silly jokes are pretty pathetic - a snake charmer playing the Bond theme, a series of terrible tennis jokes built around Vijay Amritraj's appearance as Bond's ill-fated sidekick (British actor's union Equity actually tried to call a strike over his casting) - and would have been rejected from the very worst Carry On film. There's even some lovable xenophobia thrown in for good measure (""That'll keep you in curry for a few weeks."")

That it could have been worse is borne out by one of the DVD's most interesting new extras - a series of screen tests with James Brolin as Bond. He gives it a good try, but he's trying to hard as if clearly aware that he's terrible casting. It's a moot point as to whether Brolin would have got the part had Connery's return to Bondage persuaded the producers to stick with the tried-and-trusted Roger Moore, but it would have been more of an impersonation than a performance if he had.",1202860800,3,2698,4.6263048016701465
476440,4,630251018X,"Released in 1983, Roger Moore's sixth outing as James Bond is a sterling example of everything we've come to expect from the post-Connery 007 franchise: It's got plenty of cheesy one-liners, rollicking action sequence, plenty of fancy gadgets, a nifty little car chase, a series of pretty ladies, and a veritable gardening club of evil villains who've worked up a diabolical (if needlessly convoluted) scheme that involves everything from Faberge Eggs to nuclear devices to a traveling circus. Moore is his typically suave, smug, sarcastic self, wisecracking his way through the adventure with a certain amiable pomposity. He's no match for Sean Connery's lethal cool, but he certainly is a lot of fun.

476453,4,630251018X,"Octopussy is easily one of Roger Moore's better Bond films.  Though not as big as ""Spy Who Loved Me"", or as tight as ""For Your Eyes Only"", this certainly has a lot more going for it than the overblown ""Moonraker"", and the lesser movies ""Live and Let Die"", ""Man With The Golden Gun"", and ""View to a Kill"".  Octopussy begins with one of the more exciting pre-credits scene in a Bond film, and continues with a nice story and memorable characters and more, but original, great Bond action.

The story revolves around a crazy Russian general, who's thirst for conquest of Europe goes to such great lenghts to eventually set a bomb to explode at a circus in Germany where very important officials will be attending.  The movie's main villain - Kamal Khan - works for this Russian, and Bond spends all his time and efforts taking him down, along with his nasty Indian henchman who always seems to be there ready for a fight.  Kamal also works for a woman named Octopussy (who Bond wins over no less), but puts her in harms way eventually, adding to the conflict.

Kamal is a fine villain in this film.  Cold and ruthless at times, he can stand up to par with any other villain of the Bond franchise, but I suppose he does not have the classic feel.  His henchman makes his presence known throughout the film as well, and fights Bond in two of the most exciting scenes in the film - ontop of a moving train and airplane.  The two Bond girls in the film actually have in-depth charcater, and don't come off as ditsy dummies.  The rest of the cast is likeable too.

The action is plentiful and stisfying.  In addition to the incredible train and airplane fights, there are chases and even a hunt for Bond in the jungle - led by Kamal and his men.  The locations still remain original, specifically the large portion of the movie setting in India.  There are also scenes in Germany and a nice scene at Russian headquarters.

Ocopussy is easily the most underrated of the Bond films.  The fact that Bond is dressed in a clown, swings through the jungle yelling like Tarzan, or even the name of the title for this film should not be enough to discourage it.  The story is solid, as are the charcaters and action.

In an early scene Steven berkoff and Walter Gotell are very good as two feuding Russian Generals, and Louis Jourdan is superb as the main villian of the piece.

However, sadly in Roger Moore's 6th outing as Bond the majority of the film is a dissappointment. The jokiness that had started to occur in Moore's later Bond movies reaches its nadir here with the dreadful Taxi chase featuring former Tennis star Vijay Amritraj. This really is awful and could just have easily been transplanted from a Carry On movie or a Pink Panther movie. In that context it might have been funny but here its awful.

This jokiness is certainly not Roger Moore's fault, who ten years earlier was a fine Bond, but at 55 when this was filmed he really was too old for the part. 'The Spy Who Loved Me' should of been his last Bond movie.",1194220800,2,970,4.537142857142857

So just how by the numbers is it?  John Glen, veteran of the Bond movies as back, an effective if uninspiring director.  John Barry delivers an adequate - but no more - score for the movie in conventional style.
How about the number 6?  Moore is back for the 6th time, and while he looks good for his age, he is still in his mid 50's by this point, and definitely looking a little too old for the role.  Especially when shown in counterpoint to hordes - and I mean hordes - of scantily clad athletic young women.
The number 2?  The number of times the leading lady has starred in a Bond movie, Maud Adams having played in The Man With The Golden Gun.  It surely says something about the lack of originality when they have to recycle their leading ladies.
The number zero - the amount of truly memorable scenes in the entire movie.
1? Is the number of rival Bond films that year - the looming threat of Sean Connery in Never Say Never Again seems to have prompted the producers to go back to a more jokey style playing to Moore's strengths, after the significantly superior and more serious For Your Eyes Only.
It's not all bad - Q finally gets a slightly larger role, Louis Jordan is a suitably slimy and cultured bad guy, there is a decent car chase as Bond races to the circus in Berlin - the only reasonably tense moment in the movie.  However, this is offset by characterisation that is stereotyped and 2 dimensional even by Bond standards, and Steven Berkoff as the rogue Russian general is so hammy you expect someone to light up a barbeque.
All in all, this being the 13th Bond movie may well be the most pointed clue of all as to what to expect.  Definitely unlucky for some.

Extras are probably the most generous in the Ultimate Edition series so far - as well as an immaculate print and dts sound, the Special Edition features are all there - but also some fascinating screen test footage with James Brolin.  He was selected to be Bond up until Moore agreed to return, and it is fascinating / intriguing / scary (delete as appropriate) to see how he performed in the high quality screen tests.  He also appears in interview to introduce the screen tests.  Other items include a tribute to the air stunt crew, and outtakes from some of the stunts, behind the scenes Super-8 footage as well as a rather dull period featurette on Bond in India.
Great package of extras, for one of the most mediocre Bond outings.",1193788800,4,2833,4.421153846153846
476456,5,630251018X,"Roger Moore's stint as James Bond lasted a whopping 12 years from 1973 to 1985, which is the longest term for any actor in the Bond role (not including Sean Connery's one-shot unofficial return in ""Never Say Never Again""). Moore started as Bond when he was 45 years old and ended when he was 57. The seven films he did are as follows:

LIVE AND LET DIE (1973)
THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN (1974)
THE SPY WHO LOVED ME (1977)
MOONRAKER (1979)
FOR YOUR EYES ONLY (1981)
OCTOPUSSY (1983)
A VIEW TO A KILL (1985)

All seven films were hugely popular at the box office, which explains why they kept making 'em every two years.

In the summer of 2003 I unbiasedly saw most of the Bond films (the ones I didn't see I was already well familiar with, like DR. NO and GOLDFINGER). I fully realize that many Bond fans look down on Moore's stint, no doubt because there was too much camp in most of his films, but I ultimately concluded that the Moore Bond pictures are the most consistently entertaining. In fact, there's not a dud in the bunch; even the heavily maligned MOONRAKER is great! The Connery films were more serious (always a good thing), with the exception of DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER, and Sean is certainly the quintessential Bond figure, but I gotta admit that -- for some strange reason -- I ENJOY Roger Moore's stint as Bond more than any of the others.

Some argue that by the time of OCTOPUSSY Moore was too ""long in the tooth,"" but I simply don't see that. He may have been 55 years old when OCTOPUSSY was released and 57 when A VIEW TO A KILL came out, but it didn't matter. Moore ALWAYS looked perfectly convincing as James Bond, whatever his age.

As to the story, is it really necessary to go into detail about the plot of OCTOPUSSY? Every Bond film features a main villain and a few accomplices/subordinates who want to cause great havoc; Bond defies death at every turn and runs into numerous beautiful women as he moves from one exotic locale to another trying to figure out the villains' scheme and stop it.

OCTOPUSSY was filmed on location in India, East Germany & England; these locations are, needless to say, fabulous. We also get ciruses, clowns, trains, mad Russian militarists and bombs-about-to-explode.

One thing that distinguishes OCTOPUSSY is that it has more of an Indiana Jones appeal than any other film in the series, which stands to reason since Indiana Jones was hugely popular at the time (RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK came out two years earlier in 1981 and THE TEMPLE OF DOOM came out one year after OCTOPUSSY in 1984). Anyway, this is a good thing.

The ""Bond women"" featured in OCTOPUSSY are Sweden's own Maud Adams and Kristina Wayborn. I personally never found Maud very appealing, and although Kristina certainly has an exotic charm, she never did anything for me either. I prefer more curvy women; women with more meat on their bones (like in THUNDERBALL, which is the BEST Bond film as far as beautiful women goes). Regardless, I'm sure there are a lot of guys out there who find Adams and Wayborn incredibly ravishing. In any event, there are numerous other women in the film like Midge, the short brunette with full hair, and the East Indian beauty that aids Bond during the opening teaser.

FINAL ANALYSIS: You either like James Bond films or you don't. You either like Roger Moore as James Bond or you don't. Although, most of the time, their plots will make your head spin, they're nothing deep. You won't derive any nuggets of wisdom from these films. They're essentially mindless adventure flicks highlighted by exotic locales and beautiful women whose express purpose is to entertain, not enlighten. It's escapist fantasy/adventure pure and simple.

THE SPY WHO LOVED ME is usually cited as the best Moore-era Bond picture, and I would agree with this, but OCTOPUSSY ranks pretty high as well (although I generally rate them all about equally). As with most of Moore's Bond films, OCTOPUSSY strongly flirts with camp here and there, but it's essentially a serious story. It has a bit of an Indiana Jones flare and features India, Germany, scheming Russian militarists, gorgeous women, incredible action sequences, ciruses, clowns, bombs and trains gallore. What moore could you want in a Bond picture? That's WHY it rates 5/5 Stars IMHO.",1189900800,2,4279,4.693333333333333

476459,4,630251018X,"""Octopussy"" was the thirteenth ""official"" James Bond film, and Roger Moore's sixth.  While Roger is looking a bit ragged, this movie is plotted well and has some of the classiest Bond movie characters.  ""Octopussy"" was released twenty years after the release of Dr. No, well into establishing the James Bond series as the longest running movie series in history.  1983 was also the only year in which two ""serious"" James Bond movies were released, with ""Never Say Never Again,"" starring Sean Connery, released shortly after this film.  Two Bond films were also released in 1967; ""You Only Live Twice"" and the comedy ""Casino Royale,"" with an all-star cast that included Peter Sellers, David Niven and numerous Bond movie actors, including Ursula Andress and Caroline Munro.

When agent 009 turns up stabbed with a valuable jeweled egg, James Bond is on the case.  His investigation leads him to India, where he learns that Kamal Khan is involved in a number of activities, some of them apparently involving Octopussy, a female smuggler who makes her home on an island where there are only women.

Louis Jourdan plays Kamal Khan.  Jourdan brings significant class and style to the character, and may be Bond's classiest villain ever.  Jourdan's Khan is also utterly ruthless, and comes close to killing Bond several times.

Beautiful Maud Adams plays Octopussy, which was her father's nickname for her.  Maud and her girls are smugglers, but you will note that their guns contain darts that put their targets to sleep rather than kill.  Maud Adams remains unique as the actor to be in a lead role in two Bond movies, the first being ""The Man with the Golden Gun"" in 1974.  In many ways the character of Octopussy is similar to the character of Kristatos in ""For Your Eyes Only.""

As the movie unfolds we learn that General Orlov (played chillingly by Steven Berkoff) has been plotting with Kamal Khan to use the military superiority of the Soviet Union to show the world that the Soviet Union remains a potent world power.  Kamal Khan's interest is money, however, and he cares little for Orlov's activities other than how he can benefit from them.

Two principal characters support Kamal and Bond.  Kabir Bedi plays Gobinda, a tall, quiet, intelligent henchman.  Gobinda seems to be the one to spot when the good guys are about to make a move.  Gobinda is also quite obedient, to his ultimate chagrin.  Vijay Amritraj plays Vijay, a suave Indian who likes to play tennis and is well-spoken and educated.  Octopussy also has her sidekick in the character of Magda, played by Kristina Wayborn.  Magda is beautiful, athletic and highly intelligent, and is much like Octopussy.

The movie is focused in India until the principal characters travel to East Germany and Berlin where General Orlov's activities climax.  Here Bond faces twin knife throwers, a host of East German soldiers, a lady who refuses to give up her pay phone, West German police, U.S. MPs, a bevy of clowns, and a nuclear bomb.  The movie then returns to India where Q gets to take direct part in the action in a change of traditions, where Q has always appeared only in the lab.

The title song for this movie is sang by Rita Coolidge.  ""All Time High"" is a pretty song, and continues the tradition of having current music artists sing the title song.  This two disk set contains a music video of this song, along lots of extras, many new to this edition.  The extras are worth watching if only two find out how the plane scene and the train scene were filmed.  The extras were worth watching.

""Octopussy"" has a lot going for it.  The plot is now slightly dated, but worthy of Bond.  There are interesting special effects, including a fight on a plane and an attack with a high tech hot air balloon.  There is also a cool ""crocodile"" and a saw-blade yo-yo that shows how much of a cutup a bad guy can be.  The title song is excellent.  Roger looks very comfortable in this role, and Maud and he have substantial screen chemistry.  I could readily have watched Roger and Maud in another movie together, even another Bond movie.  While this Bond movie may be less than the best, it is still a very good Bond movie and enjoyable to watch time and again.  You need this one in your Bond movie collection.

476461,3,630251018X,"'Octopussy' begins at an East German circus, where 'a man in a clown suit' is chased through a dark wood by two circus knife-throwing experts... The clown eventually gets a dagger in his back, but survives long enough to drop a fake Faberg Easter Egg at the feet of the British ambassador...

The clown is actually 009 in disguise, who is investigating a smuggling ring that uses carnivals and circuses for cover... But the plot is much more grave than that...

There is a rebellious Russian general called Orlov, assuming a fortuitous atomic explosion on an American Air Force Base in West Germany...

Orlov's connection is an exiled Afghan prince (Kamal Khan), who is willing to help the Soviet general smuggle his deadly A-bomb into West Germany in exchange for Kremlin most remarkable jewels...

James Bond enters the case, in London, to investigate the death of 009... He attends a sale at Sotheby's where a priceless super green egg (used by Czar Nicholas in 1897) is auctioned... There he first sees Kamal Khan and his lady friend, Magda...

Aware that Khan will get the Imperial Egg to fulfill some unknown but obviously vital purpose, 007 actually bids against the exiled Afghan prince, raising its market value over the top... Although Khan eventually outbids him, Bond is clever enough to switch the real Faberg egg with a perfect replica...

Convinced that Khan is somehow mixed up in 009's murder, Bond is soon sent to India to find out why 009 was murdered...

Bond remains the sophisticated man with a price on his head... He pays a surprise visit to an island exclusively populated by attractive women... He seems to like 'eggs, preferably Faberg and dice, preferable loaded.' He maneuvers the world's smallest jet, and swings through the high trees to someone else's tunes... He orders a ferocious beast to sit, and creates a spontaneous mass action by flinging 'hard currency' in the air... In a crucial moment, he appears to have a 'very good memory for faces and figures, survives a series of throwing knives, and gets caught on a train tracks... He follows a plane on horseback for a terrific mid-air fight sequence...

Maud Adams' Octopussy serves little purpose in the story taking a backseat to Kamal Khan's disloyalty... Nevertheless she is a statuesque resourceful woman living with her stupendous sexy acrobats on a floating palace, developing a talent for illegal activities...

Christina Wayborn's Magda actually steals the show from Maud Adams... Magda is by far the prettiest of Kamal's friends exposing a 'little Octopussy' tattoo on her lower back...Her dramatic exit from 007's bedroom certainly must rank up as one of the best memorable escape in any Bond movie...

Louis Jourdan brings poetic elegance to a treacherous character... He is quite sure that Bond is 'indeed, a very rare breed soon to be made extinct.'

Kabir Bedi plays the villain Gobinda, with strong hands that can pulverize so easily a pair of dice...

Steven Berkoff plays Orlov, the wonderful Russian villain who surely is leaving the way clear for a full-scale Russian invasion of Europe...

With John Barry beautiful score; the snake charmer playing the 'James Bond' theme; the disturbed fakir resigning his bed of nails; Bond climbing at a steep angle of an engaging dcolletage; John Glen's 'Octopussy' is exotic, lush, very enjoyable and highly entertaining...",1168387200,6,3369,5.016129032258065

It seems like a throwback to the 60s style of filmmaking. The pace is slower and deliberate and the dialogue seems to have subtler wit interspersed. It has an overall nostalgic feel about it. The opening is excellent as we see Bond the spy infiltrate a banana republic air base. Bond escapes via a Bede Acrostar mini jet aircraft with a guided missile in hot pursuit.

The score by John Barry is a little sparse and sporadic but still rich in structure and flavor. Barry utilized ""The James Bond Theme"" more for this Roger Moore outing than he did for his other scores for the Moore Bonds. He did do an outstanding job scoring the scenes involving the Soviets, which had that eastern block flavor similar to his score for THE QUILLER MEMORANDUM.

The extras are very good. They are well thought out and prepared. Great screen test footage of James Brolin with his comments is a very good insight into the making s of these films.

476474,5,630251018X,"1983's ""Octopussy"", Roger Moore's sixth (and second to last) outing as James Bond is one of the most criticized Bond movies ever. However, the people who hate it really should give it a break. Sure films like ""Goldfinger"" and the latest ""Casino Royale"" may have a more cohesive storyline and more depth and character development to them, but when it comes to getting pure fun and excitement out of a Bond movie, none can beat what ""Octopussy"" has to offer.

Roger Moore is beginning to showing his age in this one he was 56 at the time), but he's rarely if ever had more fun in the part. Some of his best one liners are in this movie, especially his short exchange with Q (the late, reat Desmond Llewelyn) on the hot air balloon (Bond: I trust you can handle this contraption, Q? Q: It goes by hot air. Bond: Oh, then you can.), and he manages to handle the action sequences quite well for a man his age (though I'm certain he had stunt men for a better part of the time).

Maude Adams is much more enjoyable as Octopussy than she was Anders in The Man With The Golden Gun. She's among the best Bond girls in that she manages to match Bond in terms of intelligence and charm. The hotties she surrounds herself with on her island are quite impressive as well.

I love the villians in this one. Louis Jordan as Kamal Khan is up there with Goldfinger and 006 as one of the all time best. He's sinister, charming and evil all in one, a perfect villian for Bond. Steve Berkoff, who made a living off playing sinister 1980s' baddies (""Beverly Hills Cop"", ""Rambo III"") is great as General Orlov as well.

The action sequences in this one are top notch. The opening sequence, involving a raid on a Latin is awesome, and the entire chase scene through India is one of a kind. I must day, that sequence belongs to the character of Vijay (Vijay Armritraj). IMO he steals the show from Moore.

The plot is a bit thin but retains the trademark Cold War undertones that shaped the early Bond movies, plus who cares when there's this much fun to be had. I highly recommned this (though wait for the two disc special edition).

Oh, and one more thing, I love the theme song, ""All Time High"" by Rita Coolidge, an incredibly sensual and romantic song. One of the best Bond themes ever.",1165449600,4,2267,4.385714285714286

Moore gives one of his best performance as Bond, and he's surrounded by a terrific cast. Maud Adams (Octopussy) and Kristina Wayborn (Magda) are wonderful as the Bond women; Louis Jourdan (Kamal Khan) and Kabir Bedi (Gobinda) are excellent as two of the main villains. Maud Adams is the only woman to be a Bond girl TWICE and her performance in this film is much better than her performance in TMWTGG. The final climax scene is both exciting,fun and filled with tension. Hint: The characters are not what they pretend to me (allies in the beginning will betray each other in the end). Of course with any Bond/Moore film, there has to be some degree of silliness and the final scene is the ulimate example of this. (Oh, James!)

Overall, this is one of the best Bond films -- enjoyable, entertaining, with beautiful visuals well filmed, and a truly enjoyable sensual component. The film also benefits from a nice and one of my personal favorite Bond themes, sung by Rita Coolidge.

Orlov the main villain or the suave Kamal Khan? Another objection postulates that its choice of India as a location sends Bond into a pure fantasy land with a depiction of tribal princes, mysterious islands populated entirely of impossibly beautiful women and bungling local thugs. Still more point to its inappropriate rather juvenile schoolboy humor, from Bond's Tarzan yell to our heroes ogling over a young woman secretary's bust as a reason why the movie fails.
These objections are perfectly legitimate, but one has to feel that the movies detractors were missing the point. Bond is a fantasy figure who in the past has battled armies inside bases hidden inside hollowed out volcano's (in 1967's YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE) and shot into space to save the world from poisoned orchids globes (in 1979's MOONRAKER). Bond belongs in the fantasy realm and the over-the-top formula is perfectly suited and indeed complimented by the India depicted here.
In addition the villains are similarly over-the-top and the movie audience is treated to two wonderful performances. Who can forget the fantastic performance of Steven Berkoff as Orlov in the Kremlin meeting room - ""Never, the West is decadent"" Orlov states as he struts around one of Peter Lamont's amazing sets.
The humor is also perfectly suited to the Roger Moore portrayal of Bond and in fact the adventures had become so fantastical at this point that it was necessary for Moore to not take events too seriously. The only truly embarrassing scene is the one in Q's workshop where Bond focuses a camera in on a woman's bust. But other scenes referred to pop culture of the 1900s, such as Bond doing his Barbara Wodehouse impersonation telling a tiger to ""sit-t-t"" and swinging through the vines like Johnny Weismuller in an old Tarzan picture. Neither is particularly intrusive and both elicited belly laughs from the audience I saw the movie with. Similarly the complaint that Bond ends up in a clown suit at the end should be taken in context, he is undercover at a circus, a clown outfit is in fact the perfect disguise.
The movie starts with one of the most famous action sequences of the 1980s. Captured trying to destroy a spy plane in Latin America 007 escapes by using the worlds smallest jet even flying it through a hanger as the doors close. In fact the jet, called an Acrostar, actually exists and had been originally planned for use in 1979's MOONRAKER, it deserves its place in the Bond movie's pantheon of gadgets alongside the mini helicopter Little Nellie from 1967. Rolling up to a gas station at the end of the sequence Bond delivers my favorite line in the movie, smiling to the undoubtedly amazed attendant and asking him to Fill her up please.""
Of course this scene has nothing to do with the movie as a whole but it's a  nice little mini-adventure to start things off with and set the tone for the rest of the movie. Following the erotic main titles, in which designer Maurice Binder makes full use of lasers and gorgeous women, we are plunged headlong into the main plot with two assassins chasing a British agent in full clown make-up (shades of what is to come later) as he attempts to get a fake Faberge egg to the British embassy.
Understandably a little miffed at the death of their agent and curious as to the reason why he was carrying a fake egg the British send Bond to observe the auction of the real egg at Sotheby's. Here is one of my favorite scenes, there are no explosions, no meglomaniacal speeches from super villains and no incredible sets but merely Bond testing the determination of Khan in a standoff which reaches its final conclusion thousands of miles away over a game of backgammon. Here we see shades of Goldfinger cheating at golf in the 1964 movie except this time its loaded dice on the backgammon table.
Special mention must go to the very alluring Maud Adams who holds the distinction of being the only actress to play two leading roles in the EON Bond series (Ursula Andress played two, the first in DR. NO and the second in the non-Eon 1967 spoof CASINO ROYALE). Adams is a stunning Scandinavian beauty and plays the title role with a sense of both amusement and conviction. In fact in what is an interesting tip of the hat to the short story from which the movie gets its title, the plot of Bond tracking down a traitor serves as the backstory to Adam's characters father.
The plot for what its worth involves jewelry smuggling and nuclear brinkmanship, but that's really not what is important here, that merely serves as a canvas on which to stage fun set pieces and a generous selection of stunt action sequences.
What we have here is a fun action adventure movie, just don't go in expecting anything serious. If you approach this movie with the right frame of mind you might find this entry in the James Bond canon to be one of the series most entertaining - for entertainment's sake.
The DVD also features a scene specific commentary from Director John Glen. It can be a little dry at times and it might be better waiting for the upcoming remastered DVD releases that will feature a commentary by Bond actor himself Roger Moore.",1137369600,61,5309,4.696351931330472

After the serious approach to For Your Eyes Only, I guess the writers and producers felt they needed to go back to silliness, coz that's what Octopussy does.  If you were turned off by Moonraker, I'd suggest staying away.  There is some very silly stuff here.  A Faberge egg is Bond's doorway to India, an island of acrobatic fighter chicks and a sinister commie plot.  The villain here is Louis Jourdan, who you may or may not remember as Arcane from the Swamp Thing films.  Jourdan is a great actor with a cool accent and a real suaveness about him.  Just as suave as Bond.  But as cool as Jourdan is, he's pretty much a by-the-numbers rich, egocentric Bond villain.  Why does Bond get all the high class villains that invite him to eat dinner with them and sleep with their mistresses?  Just once I'd like to see Bond up against some mafia family or some scummy junkie.  Anyhow, Bond get hunted through the jungle by the villain, sleeps with a couple of women, dresses in a gorilla suit, then in a clown outfit, and saves the day.

first of all, most of the action scenes were crude and were induceing that there were budget limits. in most of the secenes, there were only beginning and the end, not the action! there were too much advertisements too, specially for seiko and sony! what kind of Bond was he who had worn japanese stuff?!! and... there were too lies in this movie. unbelievable lies. A Bond movie traditionally consists of showing high tech equipment plus rare but believable achievements and of course, beautiful women and sex. but in this movie, there was less signs of high tech equipment and whit that kind of unreasonable action scenes, they reduced the class of this movie as a common average budget action movie!

476510,2,630251018X,"What an embarassment to the series!  This film pushed the humor button so many times, it was almost a comedy! EVERY single action had to have a one-liner following it - case-in-point: the golf-cart chase sequence.  Joke after Joke and sight-gag after sight-gag slow the scene down to the point it is laughable.  And how about that jungle escape scene?  Let's see - Moore is being chased by the bad guy (who is riding an elephant) - he swings on a vine and we get a Tarzan yell from the soundtrack for it - then he is attacked by what truly looks like a stuffed animal tiger - and then, after landing in the water for about 5 seconds, is covered in leeches!  The producers were trying to throw every exotic aspect of the jungle at you in about 60 seconds!

Add to all this the least interesting Bond girl (Maud Adams) who for once actually looks Moore's elderly age.  Maud already underwhelmed us in MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN as a different character.  Why they liked her enought to give her a new role is beyond me.

The film only manages to shine in its final act during a truly exciting train chase sequence.  I love the image of Bond driving a car with blown-out tires on a railroad track!  The film also featured one of the better opening sequences. (In fact, Moore seems to have had almost all of the best opening sequences - too bad his entire movies couldn't have been as good as their openings!)

I waver over whether this or VIEW TO A KILL is the worst of Moore's series - but I usually tend to award that distinction to this one, simply for the silliness factor.  I mean, I know Bond is a sex addict - but he's not supposed to be so immature as to zoom a camera into a woman's cleavage over and over!!

But this time the man is a little tired, and it looks like Grampa James Bond (Roger Moore) should have retired. This is one of the most ridiculous movies in the series due to bad writing, Moore's superiorty complex, and some truly unBond momemnts.

This movie starts out bad enough when a respected agent 009 is killed being chased in a CLOWN COSTUME. Soon come the usual bravado and for awhile it is actually a good movie. Somthing that his movie does have going for it is this is Q's most memorable movie. He is a fun character and it is great to see him recieving more air time. But it just is horrible. James Bond is chased by enemy agents and when he is getting away he swings on a vine and lets out the Tarzan yell. Sound effects like this bring the Moore movies down such as the carflip in The Man With The Golden Gun's car flip.

Then comes the end of the movie. Bond has to go under cover in order to get into the circus where the bomb is being held. So he copies the first agent 009 and becomes a clown. WRONG,WRONG,WRONG! Save your time and skip this movie. But even if you don't like Moore, come back for the next movie because Christopher Walken is the villian in A View To A Kill.

476514,4,630251018X,"""Octopussy"" was the thirteenth ""official"" James Bond film, and Roger Moore's sixth.  While Roger is looking a bit ragged, this movie is plotted well and has some of the classiest Bond movie characters.  ""Octopussy"" was released twenty years after the release of Dr. No, well into establishing the James Bond series as the longest running movie series in history.  1983 was also the only year in which two ""serious"" James Bond movies were released, with ""Never Say Never Again,"" starring Sean Connery, released shortly after this film.  Two Bond films were also released in 1967; ""You Only Live Twice"" and the comedy ""Casino Royale,"" with an all-star cast that included Peter Sellers, David Niven and numerous Bond movie actors, including Ursula Andress and Caroline Munro.

When agent 009 turns up stabbed with a valuable jeweled egg, James Bond is on the case.  His investigation leads him to India, where he learns that Kamal Khan is involved in a number of activities, some of them apparently involving Octopussy, a female smuggler who makes her home on an island where there are only women.

Louis Jourdan plays Kamal Khan.  Jourdan brings significant class and style to the character, and may be Bond's classiest villain ever.  Jourdan's Khan is also utterly ruthless, and comes close to killing Bond several times.

Beautiful Maud Adams plays Octopussy, which was her father's nickname for her.  Maud and her girls are smugglers, but you will note that their guns contain darts that put their targets to sleep rather than kill.  Maud Adams remains unique as the only actor to be in a lead role in two Bond movies, the first being ""The Man with the Golden Gun"" in 1974.  In many ways the character of Octopussy is similar to the character of Kristatos in ""For Your Eyes Only.""

As the movie unfolds we learn that General Orlov (played chillingly by Steven Berkoff) has been plotting with Kamal Khan to use the military superiority of the Soviet Union to show the world that the Soviet Union remains a potent world power.  Kamal Khan's interest is money, however, and he cares little for Orlov's activities other than how he can benefit from them.

Two principal characters support Kamal and Bond.  Kabir Bedi plays Gobinda, a tall, quiet, intelligent henchman.  Gobinda seems to be the one to spot when the good guys are about to make a move.  Gobinda is also quite obedient, to his ultimate chagrin.  Vijay Amritraj plays Vijay, a suave Indian who likes to play tennis, is well-spoken and educated.  Octopussy also has her sidekick in the character of Magda, played by Kristina Wayborn.  Magda is beautiful, athletic, highly intelligent, and much like Octopussy.

The movie is focused in India until the principal characters travel to East Germany and Berlin where General Orlov's activities climax.  Here Bond faces twin knife throwers, a host of East German soldiers, a lady who refuses to give up her pay phone, West German police, U.S. MPs, a bevy of clowns, and a nuclear bomb.  The movie then returns to India where Q gets to take direct part in the action in a change of traditions, where Q has traditionally beem away from the action.

The title song for this movie is sang by Rita Coolidge.  ""All Time High"" is a pretty song, and continues the tradition of having current music artists sing the title song.  The special edition includes a music video of this song, along with a short on Peter Lamont and a making of documentary.  Of the extras the documentary and the voice commentary are the best features.  Here are a couple of interesting facts from the extras.  The plane that flew through the hangar at the beginning was mounted on a post that was attached to the chassis of a car.  If you slow the picture down as the plane flies through the hangar you can easily see the post and catch a couple of glimpses of the car chassis.  Later in the movie when Bond is fighting on the circus train, the scenes with Bond suspended just above the moving rails was done with a painted moving below a pair of railroad cars suspended in the air, and a single moving train wheel.  I found it hard to tell that the railroad ties were not real even though I knew how the special effect was created.  I thought the extras were worth watching.

""Octopussy"" has a lot going for it.  The plot is now slightly dated, but worthy of Bond.  There are interesting special effects, including a fight on a plane and an attack with a high tech hot air balloon.  There is also a cool ""crocodile"" and a saw-blade yo-yo that shows how much of a cutup a bad guy can be.  The title song is excellent.  Roger looks very comfortable in this role, and Maud and he have substantial screen chemistry.  I could readily have watched Roger and Maud in another movie together, even another Bond movie.  While this Bond movie may be less than the best, it is still a very good Bond movie and enjoyable to watch time and again.  You need this one in your Bond movie collection.",1111708800,21,4954,4.670900692840647
476515,4,630251018X,"By 1983, it didn't take a genius to figure out that Roger Moore was nearing the end of his time as James Bond.  But as ""Octopussy"" demonstrates, at fifty-five years old Moore was still as suave as ever.

Referencing Ian Fleming's short story ""Octopussy"", the twelfth screen adventure of 007 is partially based on another of Fleming's tales, ""The Property of a Lady"", and is partially entirely new material.  The story involves James Bond investigating the death of agent 009, and the origin of a Faberge Egg found with the body.  The trail leads Bond across India and Russia, and Bond eventually discovers a plan to begin a third World War.

The Bond adventures had been getting sillier and sillier ever since ""The Man With the Golden Gun"" in 1979 - the peak of the goofy craze being ""Moonraker"" - and in 1981 the producers opted to go back to a more serious Bond for ""For Your Eyes Only"".  ""Octopussy"" has the mood just about right - serious, but occasionally silly as well.  Only once does it go over the edge - when 007 releases a Tarzan scream in the Indian jungle.

There's some good thrills in this film, directed by frequent Bond director John Glen.  The best of which is probably the short, but grabbing pre-title sequence, which involves 007 in a mini-plane to escape from an enemy base.  There's another score by John Barry - who was also reaching the end of his Bond adventures - which doesn't live up to what we've come to expect from Barry.  Louis Jordan makes a very nice, albeit ferret-faced villain, while Maud Adams returns to play the title character.

All in all, I find ""Octopussy"" to be a good, quite entertaining, and rather underrated Bond adventure.  Next up was Roger Moore's final (and not a moment too soon) outing as Bond: ""A View to a Kill"".",1104710400,5,1770,4.580952380952381

On the plus side, it features one of Roger Moore's better performances, quality supporting players, superb action sequences, and real dramatic tension in many key moments.  As negatives, the plot is Byzantine and there are cringe-worthy moments of silliness (including the title).  While the movie at certain points is as silly as ""Moonraker"", it also achieves the grittiness of ""For Your Eyes Only"" in others.  Another example of the film's inconsistency is the score.  While John Barry's use of the title song (All Time High) in a symphonic suite is pleasing and sensual, the overall score lacks the punch and flair of his earlier work on the series.
Nonetheless, if you can relax and enjoy the performances, locations, and action, and forget trying to figure out the plot, Octopussy is actually quite an enjoyable ride.
DVD: The recent releases of the Bond films have had an excellent complement of features and Octopussy is no different.  Unfortunately, the producers did not go the extra mile on the sound quality.

Maud Adams, previously cast in ""The Man With the Golden Gun,"" is a welcome addition to Bond's lineup of gorgeous female adversaries (and allies) in a clever script that combines elements of two Ian Fleming short stories (""Octopussy"" and ""The Property of a Lady""). And veteran actor Louis Jourdan brings a sophisticated elegance to the proceedings that more recent Bond villains have lacked.

The film, like its predecessors as well as successors, boasts the patented Bond elements in the form of a power-mad Russian general (Steven Berkoff as villain #1), a contemptible Indian prince (Frenchman Louis Jourdan assaying the role of villain #2), murderous, knife-throwing twins (David and Anthony Meyer), incredible stunts, massive explosions, unbelievable gadgets, and the always alluring Bond ""babes"" (chief among them Maud Adams in the title role and Kristina Wayborn as Octopussy's second-in-command).

The story is formulaic, as is the custom in all Bond films.

But, at least this one allows the late Desmond Llewleyn (""Q"") a chance to be a hero.

It's a shame that the moviemakers didn't afford the same respect to Lois Maxwell (""Miss Moneypenny"").  By having an assistant waiting in the wings for her job, it appeared that the actress was about to be put out to pasture, a fate that probably should've befallen the movie's star before he made ""A View to a Kill"".

476545,4,630251018X,"If OCTOPUSSY is not the most unfortunate title of all in the James Bond series, then I don't know what else could be. However, if one can get past this somewhat inundated label - taken, as was the previous 007 entry FOR YOUR EYES ONLY, from one of Ian Fleming's short stories rather than his novels (each of Fleming's book titles had already been used up by this time)- one may aptly find some true gems to be salvaged here.
The storyline presented in this movie, however, has nary an inkling linked to Fleming's little OCTOPUSSY.  Yet actually - though I'm normally quite the stickler portending the sort of thing that involves literature being fathomed into film - when it comes to fathoming Commander Bond in any manner or depth, let me just say:  I Do Not, Nor Have I Ever, Come Across Any Problem With Expanding upon the Liberties of Whim, nor even Elaboration~
For there's no denying this 007 action flick presents all the optimal Moore-era Bond movie offerings in the full force of their stigma, and that's certainly something I care about:  exotically beautiful locales, attractive leads, tense action, and dry cheeky humor.  And though, evidently, there's something intangible that's lacking here, I cannot say I haven't immensely enjoyed this movie each time I've seen it over the years.
An extremely valuable collector's item:  a Faberge Easter Egg, is to be auctioned, ""Property of a Lady,"" at Sotheby's shortly following the murder in Germany of Her British Majesty's Secret Service agent 009, who'd had the article d'art on his person when he was killed.  It's correctly suspected that this collectible, of which there are more than one or two counterfeits roaming abroad, is being used to finance something severely counteractive to the well being of Her Majesty's realm. The ""Lady"" in question is a beautiful, albeit elusive, jewelry smuggler who happens to know a thing or two of Bond and the type of man he is.  She's known as Octopussy (Maud Adams), but she's actually not to be seen for several scenes hence...  So- in the eventful and intimate meanwhile, it's Magda (Kristina Wayborn), a member of the Octopussy Circus, who serves to stir Bond's romantic juices.  While Wayborn is undeniably pretty, her aura is rather stiff and stoic in comparison to the ardent and colorful scenery (John Barry's musical score enhancing the atmosphere to a vividly lush pitch). Really, it is not until Octopussy, our aquatically exotic and mysteriously oblique adversary enters the picture, that the movie suffers itself to turn beautiful.
By this time, James Bond's assignment has put him in quest of that swank little egg - and he's pitted against two very hearty villains:  Kamal (Louis Jourdan) and General Orlov (Stephen Berkoff).  They plan, with the aid of their dangerous henchmen: Gobinda (Kabir Bedi) and the evil twins (David Meyer and Tony Meyer) to set off a nuclear bomb on an American airbase in Germany.  Bond's quest leads him through London, Germany, thence onward as far as Delhi, India:  all settings being sufficiently aesthetic and atmospheric for the discriminating Bond aficionado.
And if I sound ironic, it's indeed likely due to the convoluted aspects surrounding my own morose mind.  The dilemna has only tentative factors to do with the (ornate as possible) elucidation of my praise for this movie.  In other words:  I like this film, but I cannot succinctly tell you why.......
Overall, John Glenn's direction is very riveting, very scenic, very good; Moore's getting a bit old here for the role, and this really should have been his last appearance as Bond (but he came back oncemore, for A VIEW TO A KILL); the music herein is seamless and perfect; and, without doubt, the storyline and characterizations are very excellent.  I really could go on and on and on.... but this time, I won't.
This is Roger Moore's 6th outing as 007, and the 13th film overall in the series.  The year was 1983 - which was, incidentally, the same year Sean Connery came back as Bond in the unofficial (non-EON-franchised) entry, NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN.  For my part, I must allow that Moore upstages Connery, if only for this moment - and only for the sake of posterity:  for, whether or not this was a most singular fluke of timing, or a concerted effort to bring James Bond blatantly into the scheme of box office intrigues, I'd already had the pleasure of the likes of NSNA with the earlier film, THUNDERBALL (yesss, but that's another story, for another day), so it all seemed more nostalgically symbolic than entertaining. Truly, in 1983, even though James Bond was looking a little too seasoned for the intense physical action demanded on the big screen, the active magnetism of the icon left no doubt as to his universal allure.",1070496000,2,4750,4.877018633540373
476561,4,630251018X,"""Octopussy"" is an interesting blend of the Roger Moore era James Bond film, mixing the spectacle of ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" with the drama of ""For Your Eyes Only."" Though not as good as the aforementioned films, ""Octopussy"" is certainly highly entertaining in its own right. The glamourous production is among the series' best, with locations ranging from India to West Germany, accomplishing the difficult task of making the former look like paradise! The vogue element is heightened even further by the wonderful assortment of beautiful women at the title character's palace, and seen throughout the picture. Their attack of the villain's headquarters is perversely fascinating. The knife-throwing twin brothers are also a welcome addition, posing an interesting threat for 007. Though silly at times, most of the action is top notch with some of the best stunts in the Bond cannon. Roger Moore does indeed look a bit too old in the film, but he gets away with it by having his trademark wit in top form, in addition to some fine acting moments during the film's climax at the Air Force base. A good score by John Barry doesn't hurt the film either. Apart from a few idiosyncracies, the one true disappointment is that the DVD is not as packed with extras as some of the others in the series.",1063238400,2,1293,4.802690582959642

It's a great film to watch more then once.
Every time I watched it I think I am watching the film for the first time.
This movie is like the 1996 ""Cricket"" World Cup match between Australia and India at mumbai (Bombay

476565,5,630251018X,"The thirteenth James Bond flick and Moore's sixth outing is not only blessed with a far-out, hilarious and racy title in Octopussy, but it is arguably Moore's greatest triumph as the debonair superspy.  Compared to what I believe to be Moore's very best outing, The Spy Who Loved Me, Octopussy, much like For Your Eyes Only is a no-frills, serious Sean Connery 60's throwback in the 80's, but with the overall feel of a daring, exotic adventure, comparable of an Indiana Jones movie.  In fact, the Bond franchise capitalizes on the prosperity of George Lucas' films, with Octopussy somewhat echoing Raiders of the Lost Ark in place of Moonraker replicating Star Wars to a point.  Where Moonraker failed, Octopussy succeeded in that the Raiders of the Lost Ark tone was more nostalgic and suitable, and because of it, Octopussy had gone down as an excellent all-around film.
The beginning of the movie can be a bit confusing, aside from the entertaining pre-titled sequence, highlighted by Bond's Acrostar jet.  One of Bond's MI6 colleagues was murdered on the circus grounds of East Berlin, possibly due to the fact he secured a fake Faberge egg.  At any rate, Bond is assigned to attend an auction, where the authentic Faberge egg is being sold, in an attempt to foil any buyers, with the apparent motive of funding the Soviets with ""hard currency"", from purchasing the priceless egg.  It is at this auction that Bond encounters an affluent, exiled Afghan prince named Kamal Khan (Louis Jourdan of Gigi fame), who eventually wins the Faberge egg.  Bond follows Kamal Khan back to his home in India where 007 exposes Khan's ties to a jewelry smuggler, the infamous Octopussy (Maud Adams, who played Andrea Anders from The Man With The Golden Gun) and his affiliation with a power-hungry Soviet officer, General Orlov (Stefan Berkoff).  Bond deduces that Khan would aid Orlov by utilizing Octopussy's front, a traveling circus to detonate a nuclear bomb on an American air force base in West Berlin.  By doing so, Orlov would obliterate American defense of the Western European fronts and open the door for the Soviets to occupy the whole of Europe.  What ensues is a nail-biting railway chase against time to West Berlin as Bond desperately attempts to save the day.
Octopussy is a thrilling ride, with well-developed characters and an involving, yet reasonable storyline to boot.  Moore, despite his obvious aging, turns in a well-deserved outstanding performance.  Moore's leading lady and title character, Maud Adams is worthy of praise, as she portrays the intriguing and intelligent Octopussy with tremendous poise.  Kamal Khan is a cool customer of a villain, possessing a deadly, charming aura about himself.  Although Orlov does not receive a whole lot of screen time in this film, compared to his partner in crime, Kamal Khan, is a ruthless, insanely patriotic maniac.  Octopussy has some unique henchmen as well, in particular, the intimidating Gobinda, who comes off as an Indian-style Oddjob, and the twin knife-throwing assassins, Mischa and Grischa.  Don't forget the razor yo-yo cronies as well!  Kristina Wayborn as the sensual, mysterious Magda turns in a rather memorable perfomance as an alternate, minor Bond lady.  Above all, the storyline is deliberate, meticulous-paced, which makes it the film's best attribute.  Despite the over-the-top raid of Kamal Khan's Monsoon Palace, from the post-title sequence to Bond's chase to thwart Orlov is incredibly suspenseful, with a rather comical touch to the climax, Octopussy delivers a nice, steady dose of exotic action and adventure.",1055376000,4,3600,5.123076923076923
476566,4,630251018X,"Roger Moore is James Bond in his second to last adventure, ""Octopussy"".  Here he's after Kamal Khan (Louis Jourdan) and the title character (Maude Adams - in her second Bond flick)because they intend to launch WWIII using a nuclear bomb detonated on an American Army Base in East Germany. Yeah, I know, cliche, upon cliche, upon cliche!  But hey, it's Bond - Jame Bond and its amazingly good fun. Moore is the king of the one liners.  His best in ""Octopussy"" occurs after he has just escaped a hunting party, complete with lions, tigers and elephants.  Moore swims a muddy river to a tour guide boat and is helped aboard.  When a lady tourist asks if Moore is with their group, he replies, ""No ma'am.  I'm with the economy tour!""
MGM/UA has done an adequate job of remastering ""Octopussy"" to DVD.  However, there are some glaring oversights.  First, after the 5.1 remastering efforts on ""Moonraker"" and ""The Spy Who Love Me"" (both older Bond's than this one)""Octopussy is only offered in a 2.0 surround mix.  Even in its theatrical release it had more oomph from its sound field than this.  Also, images, while generally free of shimmering and edge enhancement, are nevertheless, sometime plagued with a soft characteristic that isn't very flattering.  The overall picture just doesn't measure up to the previous Bond transfers mentioned and, in light of that inevitable comparison, is perhaps more of a let down.  Extra features are crazy, practically requiring another disc, they are so plentiful.  Highlights include a making-of featurette and Rita Coolidge's ""All Time High"" music video which really took me back to the eighties and the dawning of the whole MTV generation. If MGM had paid as much attention to the actual mastering of the film, as they have with their menu design and special features, this could have been a great DVD to recommend. As it stands it's just average.  The extra features push my rating up the extra notch, not the film transfer. Keep that in mind if you are buying just for the way the film looks.

The plot is much better than most Bond films and mostly feels real. While Bond's villain is another megalomaniac, he's a believable one and a great adversary to Bond. The film's weakest element is the title character, played by the very untalented Maud Adams.

Carrying on with the more down-to-earth blend of action and comedy started by For Your Eyes Only (1981), Octopussy sees Bond pitted against bad guys intent on destroying detente with a stolen nuclear device.
The action, especially in the pre-credits teaser, is excellent, with Bond proving once again, he is the best. Director John Glen, who went on to direct the tedious A View to A Kill (1985), here gives a good Flemming novel the justice it deserves, proving to be one of many fan's favourites. Not the best Bond film, but a solid action entry nevertheless.

There is a great score by John Barry, including the theme ""All Time High"" performed well by Rita Coolidge.  The villains and henchman, I believe, are some of the best in the series.  Although Louis Jourdan does not immediately come across as a really mean character, I think there is a certain charm that he brings, especially in his backgammon match with Bond and at the dinner table.  Gobinda is a very hostile and belligerent henchman, a striking contrast to Prince Kamal Khan.  And the knife-throwing twin brothers were also terrific.  Octopussy is a great title character, although Maud Adams was far more attractive in her supporting role as Andrea Anders in TMWTGG.

""Octopussy"" is presented in Stereo Surround, and as this is one of my favorite bond films, I always feel a bit disappointed every time I watch the film.
In fact 8 of the first 9 DVD Bond film titles are presented in mono from ""Dr. No"" to ""The Man With The Golden Gun"" (apart from ""Thunderball"" in 5.1).

476629,4,630251018X,"When ""Octopussy"" first came out in 1983, I didn't want to see this James Bond movie because I thought that the title sounded silly.
I finally rented this movie a few months ago.  There is the old saying, ""Don't judge a book by its cover.""  In relation to ""Octopussy,"" this adage can be modified into ""Don't judge a movie by its title.""
James Bond(Roger Moore) tangles with Kamal Kahn(Louis Jourdan), a wealthy exiled Indian prince who conspires with a fanatical Russian general to trigger World War III.
Despite its silly-sounding title, ""Octopussy"" is one of the very best James Bond movies and certainly Roger Moore's second best outing as this character.  After ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service,"" ""Octopussy"" is the second most heartfelt Bond movie.  ""Octopussy"" is one of the few James Bond pictures that attempts to humanize this character and the movie actually achieves this noble goal.  ""Octopussy"" also features the most heartwarming of all the James Bond theme songs: ""All Time High.""  The movie is not only very touching but also very exciting.  Maud Adams plays the title character.  Adams' Octopussy rivals Honor Blackman's  ... Galore and Daniela Bianchi's Tatiana Romanova as the greatest Bond woman.  Adams is the only actress to play a lead in more than one Bond picture(She previously appeared in the vastly inferior ""The Man With The Golden Gun"").  The movie also features a hair-raising fight on an airplane.
""Octopussy"" should be Roger Moore's very best outing as James Bond but falls short of ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" for a couple of reasons.  In at least one instance, ""Octopussy"" needlessly resorts to the same poor humor that helped to ruin a number of the Roger Moore-James Bond movies.  Louis Jourdan is also a weak villain.

But by the time Octopussy was released in the summer of 1983, I was a big Bond fan with high expectations for the 13th James Bond film. I'll never forget that, after the movie on the way out of the theater, a young girl spontaneously shouted to anyone within earshot, ""Great flick!"" Had I been as inebriated as she was, I might have yelled the same thing because I just love Octopussy. In fact, I think it's one of the most underrated Bond films. James Bond Goes to India. And why shouldn't he? It's not often pointed out that Octopussy was as much a reaction to the success of Raiders of the Lost Ark as Moonraker was to the success Star Wars. Some bash these films for this, saying Bond films should always lead and never follow. I say [no]. For me, genre mixing in the James Bond films is not a sin and can result in a gre! at film. Okay, I too cringe at the Tarzan yell and the ""Sit-taaa!,"" but how about that killer pre-titles sequence with the AcroStar mini-jet? It's certainly one of the best pre-titles sequences of the series. And what about the action on the circus train? the Sotheby's auction? the helicopter gliding past the Taj Mahal to a very evocative John Barry score? Bond's backgammon game with Kamal Kahn is definitely one of the better casino face-offs. Magda spiraling off Bond's balcony by her slowly unraveling silk dress is, to quote a recently deceased news baron, ""Delicious."" And how about that no-nonsense, no-quip, high-speed, balls-to-the walls car chase on the autobahn? Great flick! Then there are the moments of wonderful detail. The hitchhiking Bond getting snubbed by a carload of obnoxious teenagers. Kamal's car not turning over on the first try as he and Globina try to escape their own ticking nuke. Magda's hairdryer interfering with Bond's earpiece gadget. And lets not forge! t the woman beating Bond to the pay phone as he rushes to prevent Armageddon. Yes, Connery's Bond would just yank that chatty woman from the phone booth and call in the marines. But Moore's Bond is not powered by his masculinity, he's powered by his Englishness. He could never do something so rude! So instead, he steals her car. I remember that getting a big hand in the theater. And as for Roger Moore; hey, I don't dismiss Roger Moore the way some old thinkers do. I even like Moonraker -- a lot! Octopussy is one of Moore's best performances as Bond. He has that old pro's grace about him that Connery had in Diamonds Are Forever and NSNA. (It's interesting that Moore didn't have this quality in his next film, A View to a Kill.

476635,5,630251018X,"""Octopussy"" is the thirteenth entry of the James Bond series produced by Cubby Broccoli and it marks the sixth appearance of Roger Moore as the British secret agent. John Glen returns to the series to make his second of four directorial efforts in this film. The title of this film is taken from an Ian Fleming short story which is actually told by the title character to James Bond in the film. Only one part of the film, the auction, is based on Fleming's work, in this case the short story ""Property of a Lady"". The rest of the screenplay was conceived and written by longtime Bond associates, Richard Maibaum and Michael Wilson.
The story begins with the discovery of a fake Fabrege Easter egg in East Berlin. Its genuine counterpart is about to be auctioned off in London and M, head of MI6, is worried that this is part of a Soviet operation to raise hard currency. Bond is assigned to attend the auction and report what he can see. What starts out as a simple assignment quickly becomes more involved. Bond first encounters Kamal Khan, a disposessed Afghan prince and apparent jewelry fence. As Bond follows Kamal back to his home in India, he finds that Kamal is involved with a female jewel smuggler known only as Octopussy. But behind them both is Soviet General Orlov and his plans involve more than just selling off jewels from the state archives. Bond must find out what Orlov is up to and stop him.
The cast of characters in ""Octopussy"" is as wide and varied as ever seen in a Bond. Bond is opposed not by one but two master villians. Actor Louis Jourdan portrays the smooth but deadly Kamal Khan and Steven Berkoff nearly steals the show as the maniacal General Orlov. Kamal's henchman Golinda, played by Kabir Bedi, is a worthy successor to the likes of Red Grant and Oddjob. David and Tony Meyer nicely round out the villians as the twin killers, Mischa and Grischa. Kristina Wayborn makes good impression as Magda although she comes off as a little stiff in a couple of her earlier scenes. The film's title character is played by Maud Adams, whose performance as the smart but sensuous businesswoman Octopussy is quite excellent. The regular cast of characters are here as well with Robert Brown debuting as ""M"" and with Lois Maxwell and Desmond Llewelyn reprising their roles of Miss Moneypenny and ""Q"". Bond's trusty sidekick in India is played by newcomer Vijay Amritraj.
The screenplay to its credit maintains a strong storyline, no mean feat considering the number of characters and the number of fights and chase scenes. The scenes where Bond is racing to prevent the fulfillment of General Orlov's plans are both amusing and suspenseful, worthy of comparison to films like Goldfinger. The final assault of Kamal's palace is a bit weak but the ensuring fight between Gobinda and Bond on the outside of a twin-engine aircraft is first-rate.
The MGM Special Edition DVD of ""Octopussy"" has, like most of the other DVDs, an excellent widescreen print. The DVD also contains a couple of interesting documentaries, an audio commentary track, and many other goodies. As with any movie presenting in a widescreen format, this DVD is best seen on a large-screen TV.
""Octopussy"" is one of those few Bond movies, especially in the Roger Moore's era, that seem to blend all the elements, exotic locations, colorful villians, spectacular physical action, suspenseful plot, into a masterful whole. If not the best of his individual performances, ""Octopussy"" is certainly the most entertaining of the Roger Moore Bonds. It is a shame that he was persuaded to do another Bond, this effort would have been a great swan song for Roger Moore. This DVD is a must for any Bond fan's collection.",972950400,28,3697,4.778125

476637,5,630251018X,"This is probably Roger Moore's best Bond movie. It seems like a throwback to the 60s style of filmmaking. The pace is slower and deliberate and the dialogue seems to have more subtle wit interspersed. It has an overall nostalgic feel about it. The opening is excellent as we see Bond the spy infiltrate a banana republic air base. Bond escapes via a Bede Acrostar mini jet aircraft with a guided missile in hot pursuit.
The score by John Barry is a little vague. The action scenes he scored didn't have his old punch. It was like he was in a transitional state. He scored the early scenes very well and they had that unique Bond sound that he used to bring to the earlier films. As the film progressed the score seemed to become repetitious and tedious. He did do a good job scoring the scenes involving the Soviets, which had that eastern block flavor similar to his score for ""The Quiller Memorandum.""
To its credit, the film uses elements from the short stories ""Octopussy"" and ""The Property of a Lady"" by Ian Fleming in a sentimental throwback to earlier Bonds. ""For Your Eyes Only"" filmed just before this one, also used some of Fleming's original writings for inspiration. In that one Bond as the shark bate in-tow was taken directly from Fleming's novel ""Live and Let Die.""
Louis Jourdan as Kamal, in a very underrated performance, is excellent and is one of the best villains of the series. He is Bond's counterpart nemesis. It was also good to see many of the regular cast members return for this one. Desmond Llewelyn as ""Q"" seemed to return to his old self prior to ""Diamonds Are Forever."" Walter Gotell as Gogol, Geoffrey Keen as the Minister of Defense, Eva Reuber-Staier as Rublevitch, Jeremy Bullock as Smithers and Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny all reprised their roles much more effectively and reminiscent to the style of the earlier Bonds. Robert Brown replaced Bernard Lee as the beloved ""M."" We all missed Bernard.
The film goes a little over-the-top near the end having Octopussy's troupe of beautiful amazons attack Kamal's Monsoon Palace. Then the film really goes over-the-top and under-the-top as Bond crawls all over Kamal's Beechcraft Model 18 Super H18 as it dives, loops and tailspins. I don't see anything wrong with that.",969667200,5,2255,4.755102040816326
476638,3,630251018X,"OCTOPUSSY didn't take long to move out of the lower key attitude set up by the previous Bond film FOR YOUR EYES ONLY.  This movie marks the return of  big stunts and Bond's spy toys.  The result is a bit of a mixed bag, but it  could have been much worse.  Bond (Roger Moore) is on the tail of Prince  Kamal Khan and a rouge Russian General who are planing on sneaking an  atomic bomb onto a U.S. air force base in Germany by using a mysterious  woman named Octopussy (Maud Adams) and her all female smuggling team's  circus as cover.  If Khan and the General are successful, Russia's forces  will have an easy foothold into most of Europe.  James must beat the clock  to make it to the circus and find the bomb before it destroys the base and  kills thousands.  The movie moves at a reasonable pace with some good  action scenes in the middle and towards the end.  There are a few bad ones  too but not enough to kill the movie's overall fun value.  Many other of  the James Bond movies are more believable or serious but this is a good  choice if you are looking for a fun action movie.",964396800,,1088,4.209756097560976

476664,5,630251018X,"This is definitely one of the best of the James Bond movies. The scenery  is gorgeous, the supporting actors superb, and the villains are serious  without being comical. No 2-bit drug smugglers here. It blends the best of  the old Bond with the best of the new. The opening scene (the one with the  ""Coors Silver Bullet""-style airplane), the ultra-hot intro  credits, and the 1st scene right after get it off to a great start. There  are several great fight and chase scenes but not so many that it  degenerates into a Van Damme style adrenaline fest. And I spent my  adolescence dreaming that I would be whisked away to the Floating Palace.  Moore may or may not have been the best James Bond ever, but the Moore  years were definitely the golden age of James Bond movies.
The Good News:  THIS MOVIE WILL BE RERELEASED IN DVD FORM THIS OCTOBER - ACCORDING TO THE  JAMES BONG WEBSITE - along with 5 others. I can't wait.",961718400,,920,4.475903614457831

I also really enjoy the performances of Louis Jordan and Krystina Wayborn. Louis Jordan's bad guy  is great and very well acted. This movie has lots of great action, comedy,  and romance. I really like this one because those three traits are the  things I like about 007 films. Octopussy really brings out these things.  Also the locations are fantastic. All of Moore's films are wonderful,  despite the lagging of his first two. Octopussy tops them of all. A real  treat of a film that never gets old. A great buy! Im glad I had a chance to  buy this before it was taken off the market. Rated PG for violence, sexual  content, and numerous suggestive themes.",961286400,,779,4.436619718309859

476668,4,630251018X,"""Octopussy"" continues the stunning run of form by Bond maestro Roger Moore. The late '70s and early '80s were undoubtably the best periods for Bond: 1977's TSWLM was superb action with a strong storyline, 1979's MR  was novel & entertaining, 1981's FYEO was a classic espionage tale, and  now Octopussy. The plot: Exiled Afghan prince Kamal Khan (Louis Jourdan)  forms an alliance with power-crazed Commie General Orlov (Stefan Berkoff),  who plans to detonate a nuclear bomb in West Berlin as a catalyst for  Russian conquest of Europe in connection with a mass jewellery heist. James  Bond foils their plans with the help of Khan's partner beaufiful Octopussy  (Maud Adams). The film sacrifices some of the action for plenty of witty  dialogue such as between Bond and Khan when they face each other at  gambling. There's still room for a highly humourous chase through the  streets of Udaipur (in India which provides fantastic scenery) a duel on  top of a speeding train, and another on top of a plane (phew!). Roger Moore  looks surprisingly young at 55 years of age and can still do some  spectacular action (!) The aforementioned villains are among the best in  the series and then there's Kristina Wayborn as Magda. Don't miss this.  This is one for the collection.",948153600,7,1273,4.910798122065728
476669,3,630251018X,"Octopussy has got to be the best title for a movie I have ever seen. Roger Moore is truly at his best in this campy portrail of James Bond. The stunts were in the confines of Roger Moore's age.  That's what made the action  believable.  It has some of the best action sequences to date.  The movie,  as a whole, was unrealistic, but none of the Bond movies really are.  In my  opinion this is the best Roger Moore movie.  I really enjoyed it and  despite the name, it's fun for the whole family.",947980800,2,495,4.180851063829787

This movie is Bond at its tongue-in-cheek best, and Moore, every bit the establishment conservative, much like his character, is at his witty and charming best.  The supporting cast, Maud Adams, Louie Jourdan, et al is superb, and a special shout to Kristina Wayborn, a talented and beautiful actress (whose career never fully took off).  Now the truth is out.  She was black-balled in Hollywood for not sleeping with a powerful producer.  She joins a long list of actresses (Mira Sorvino, and Ashley Judd, among others) whose career suffered in the same way.  We are all the poorer for having been denied seeing more of them on the big and small screens.  Still, she is delightful in Octopussy, in particular the cute way in which she delivers the line (when asked about a tattoo, saying): ""that's my little Octopussy.""  Indeed it is.
The producers missed a bet on failing to see the potential of a series of action movies featuring Adams, Wayborn, and their troupe of female action stars. If it had been made today, well....  Still a great idea, with a new cast.  All right producers?",1526342400,,1179,4.763546798029557
