4715585,4,B005K7XGTA,"Extreme scenes open this wild ride of a film,Shows the audience a character...Well who was BORN BAD.

Michael Welch has a JAMES DEAN screen prescence, He controls his emotions and brings you into his reality.

Great cast and plot that just flows with a ` Roller Coaster' of emotions drawing you into the jeopardy and sheer terror.

Wanted to hate ( And probably was made to by plot) these bad guys from the start and feel for the family that they invade.

Great cover (poster art) and to think Welch comes from the TWILIGHT movies,Huh,May have to watch one now to see in another role.",1321488000,,584,4.533333333333333

4715587,3,B005K7XGTA,"Born Bad is a decent rip-off of the 1996 thriller ""Fear"". I would have probably rated it four stars if it wasn't so much like ""Fear"". If you have seen ""Fear"", then you won't find anything new here at all, but it is entertaining.",1420416000,,228,4.204545454545454

4715590,2,B005K7XGTA,"Denny (Michael Welch) is a psycho killer rapist. Brooke (Bonnie Dennison) is a moody teen with undefined step-mom issues.  The two plots come together as Brooke must save her family against armed intruders with a kitchen knife and a frying pan.

Denny is a nice smooth sweet talker, someone that would put Eddie Hasko to shame. However underneath it all, he is a Psycho rapist killer which was revealed in the first scene, so there was zero guess work where this was headed. Acting was fair in a plot that couldn't keep me engaged.

Sex, rape, and nudity (Donnabella Mortel + one)",1398211200,,580,4.666666666666667
4715591,2,B005K7XGTA,"A virtual rip-off of Mark Wahlberg's ""Fear"".  But nowhere near as good. Bonnie Dennison as the petulant teen-age rebel girl, who hates her new step mother and step brother, but loves her daddy. She meets charming and dangerous and psychotic Michael Welch, I still can't decide what I thought of his performance, sometimes over the top but not bad. Meredith Monroe as stepmom and really a bad actress. David Chokachi as the useless dad. Psycho boy and his 2 cronies eventually attack this family (same as Fear) but here the dad and stepbrother are about as useful as a rubber crutch. Very women's lib movie where the 2 ladies do battle with the baddies. Overall 90 minutes of my life I will never get back. Very bad ripoff of a good suspenseful movie...watch ""Fear"" instead.",1396396800,4,773,4.725925925925926

4715595,5,B005K7XGTA,"We watched this movie on television this weekend.  It was very suspenseful and held us on the edge of our seats throughout.  It had the kind of tension that the movie ""Fun and Games"" had.  We both commented right after that we would have been glad to have paid to see it in a theatre and that we want to own it if it's avaialble.  It's one of those tense movies that we feel we will watch from time to time and that we will enjooy sharing with friends.",1349654400,,452,4.044943820224719

8476505,3,B005K7XGTA,"Since his childhood, I've seen Michael Welch appear in everything from American Son to Z Nation, and all that falls in between. This guy seems to be in everything, but it wasn't until I saw Born Bad, that I realized he's more than just some geeky guy in the background, he's got some real talent, playing every woman's worst nightmare. Brooke (Bonnie Dennison) is a rebellious teen, who is looking for love, and is immediately drawn to the older Denny (Michael Welch). At first he seems like the perfect boyfriend, but little did she know, he's actually a psychopath. To me films like this are scarier than any horror movie, because what's more likely to happen, a zombie apocalypse or coming across someone who isn't what the appear to be? As I said, Michael Welch was scary good in this film, portraying a man with two faces. On the surface, he's this really nice guy, but underneath, he is pure evil. Watching Welch balance the two and try to keep the real him at bay was really something to see. As far as the rest of the film, it's what you would expect, there isn't too much of a story here and little to no surprises, other than Michael Welch, who makes this film more than just something you'd turn off after ten minutes.",1454284800,3,1229,4.491071428571429

8476509,4,B005K7XGTA,"This movie is suprisingly really good and keeps you on edge of your seat. I have seen ""Fear"" and the similarities are definitly there.
