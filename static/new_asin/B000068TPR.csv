8019937,2,B000068TPR,In this US-release sound is only in mono. After that I bought an Italian DVD release where the music in complete in stereo.,1502841600,,123,4.391304347826087
8019938,4,B000068TPR,We were looking for something to spice it up a bit yet not be so over the top. This was a perfect in-between and the story line was fairly entertaining.,1379462400,2,152,4.1
8019939,5,B000068TPR,"This movie was great! My friends and I love sitting around and watching some sensual and sexual flicks on showtime and hbo late night specials. This movie appealed to all audiences. Some of my friends thought it was funny, some thought it was sexy, some thought it was sensual, and some just had a great relaxing time enjoying a completely un ihibited raunchy and playful storyline. The story revolved around a bunch of couples who agree to a weekend sleep over at a friends house. They must participate in strict roles given to them while uncovering a fiction mystery, sticking to the role. For those of you interested in a not to serious and playful fun movie, watch this. you'll love it.",1263600000,2,690,4.663934426229508
8019940,1,B000068TPR,"The first two reviewers of this movie said it best so I won't repeat them. Sometimes with a film like this you need to get the unrated version to enjoy it. Not here. I know I got the unrated one because the run time is 15 minutes longer than the rated cable version. I'm not a big fan of ""pink shots"" or closeups of anything. I do like to be able to hear the gals ""goin at it"" so to speak. You can't here. Nothing but loud, unimaginative music can be heard during the sex. The only good thing I can say about this movie is, if you catch the rated version on showtime or somewhere else, go ahead and watch it. You're not missing anything good from the deleted 15 minutes.",1188950400,3,670,4.083333333333333
8019941,4,B000068TPR,This was a very good movie I liked Amy Lindsay in this. Very good sex scenes. Worth the money. If you get a chance to buy it do so.,1178928000,2,131,3.5517241379310347
8019942,1,B000068TPR,"This film presents itself as having all the possiblities of some interesting situations. That is, if you only actually rely on the liner notes that tout a scenerio of sexual adventure and imaginative and provocative scenes. None of which could be further from the truth. The scenes are unimaginative and the actors are dull and the overall sound quality is some of the worst that I have ever heard on a professionally produced DVD. Not recommended as a rental and definitely not recommended as a purchase at any price. I agree whole heartedly with the other reviewer as well. Don't bother with this one.",1081900800,11,603,4.8076923076923075
