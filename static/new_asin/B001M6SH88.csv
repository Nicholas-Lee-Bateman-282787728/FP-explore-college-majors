3692715,4,B001M6SH88,"pretty good DBZ Blu-Ray movie, considering the dragonball series is like 20+ years old. Cant expect too much out of it, i think Funimation did a pretty good job with this Bojack movie. i would recommend this blu-ray to any DBZ fan!! despite not being a wow amazing blu-ray movie.. but none the less a good blu-ray movie.",1243036800,,320,4.5344827586206895
3692716,4,B001M6SH88,"In recent years, FUNimation, who has begun to release countless anime titles spanning various genres, has gone back to the franchise that made them big - Dragon Ball Z. They have gone back and begun releasing the series and the films in inexpensive season sets and double features.

This feature combines the seventh and ninth movies of the Z series - Super Android 13 and Bojack Unbound.

Super Android 13 features our heroes squaring off against three Androids that were created by Dr. Gero's laboratory basement computer following his demise. Goku, Vegeta, and Trunks rush to an icy battlefield to combat the cybernetic threat - but even after defeating two of the androids, discover that the real fight is just beginning.

Bojack Unbound is set immediately after the Cell Saga. Goku is dead, and everyone has gotten on with their lives. Future Trunks has even made a brief return from the future for a tournament being hosted by a millionaire. Our heroes enter the tournament, but quickly discover that the tourney's so-called ""galactic fighters"" really ARE from another planet - and they are out for blood. Can Gohan achieve a Super Saiyan 2 transformation again, and save the day?

File these two movies under ""mindless fun."" If it's just straight-up action you want, Super Android 13 is one of the best movies for it. This is three Super Saiyans going head-to-head with three super-powered Androids, and the result is an action-packed fracas that ranks amongst this reviewer's favorite DBZ movies. Bojack Unbound is an interesting film as well - it's great to see Gohan get a chance to be the main character, even if the plot itself seems a bit too familiar. Still, it has some epic, great moments. As a whole, these are two fine movies.

I want to clear something up for some of the confused fans - while these ""Double Features"" crop the movies, this was always the intention. These movies were made with cropping in mind, so as to fit them on Japanese cinema screens. So you're actually seeing the movies in the aspect ratio Toei intended (this does NOT apply to the cropped Trunks/Bardock set from last year back, though - those were made for TV, and were indeed cropped without it being the intention.)

Also, for anyone who cares, like the recent series season sets, here you can watch the English dialogue with the Japanese background music. Of course the dub is still hit and miss in places (though these revised dubs are better than what FUNimation has done in the past), so do yourself a favor and stick with the original Japanese. I only wish They had remastered the Japanese audio.

And now for the all-important question - should you get this set if you already own FUNimation's older DVDs of the movies? My answer is no, there just isn't reason enough to replace your older DVDs with this set. Additionally, you can get the older versions of the movie (which have more of the picture on them, as opposed to the Jap theatrical aspect ratio) for VERY cheap from Amazon's independent sellers. But if you can't find the older, cheaper issues, this makes for a fine alternative. You DO get 2 good movies for a good price.

Final verdict? Get it if you're a DBZ fan, but not if you already have older DVDs of the movies.",1242864000,3,3234,4.711504424778761

3692718,5,B001M6SH88,"This is the second DBZ blu ray disc I own (first one being Dead Zone) and I have to say I am impressed.  The picture and sound quality of these two films are excellent. Perfect for any DBZ fan.

Now I have read some reviews of other DBZ blu-ray films and people have given them a 1 Star rating because ""OMG THE FILM IS GRAINY AND IT HAS DAT JAPAPNESE MUSIK DAT IS SO STUPID!""  Yes the film is grainy and there is the occasional burn mark here and there, but mind you the DBZ franchise is 20+ years old.  You're not going to expect an amazing quality like a 3D movie from Pixar or whatever.  And has to the Japanese audio and score, if you don't like it then don't call yourself a real DBZ fan.

In conclusion, these movies are great for any collection. I plan on getting all of the DBZ blu-ray movies once they are all available.  Hope this review helped some of you out.",1239148800,,871,4.118343195266272
3692719,5,B001M6SH88,"This set collects DBZ movies 7 & 9. They have been working on rereleasing all 13 DBZ movies and 2 television specials in remastered format on DVD and putting them out simultaneously on Blu-Ray in High Def. The set's each contain two movies and they have been releasing them in order coinciding with the recent series set releases.

This set contains the movies 7 'Android Assault' (renamed since the original north american release was named 'Super Android 13') and 9 'Bojack Unbound'. This set contains the 7th and 9th movies as they opted to release movie 8 'Broly The Legendary Super Saiyan' with Broly's second appearance in movie 10 'Broly Second Coming', which was released earlier because of the popularity Broly has among fans.

Movie 7 'Android Assault' was always a story I liked, it finds Goku and the guys (including Future Trunks) in the city shopping and running various errands. After some humorous character interactions the story kicks in when it is revealed Dr. Gero had three more androids (13,14,15) being prepared to fight Goku and his friends. The androids attack the guys in the city and the three super saiyans (Goku, Trunks and Vegeta) quickly move the fight to a northern climate where no innocents will be hurt. Gohan and Krillin come along and provide some comic relief as the three androids face off against the three super saiyans. In the end Android 13 is more than meets the eye and becomes the unstoppable Super Android 13 taking down all of the guys. This is one of the movies with the familiar formula of Goku being granted the others energy in the end to attempt a final blow at the big bad but at least in this one the others also step in to help him a little more at the end. This is an entertaining movie that any DBZ fan should enjoy.

Movie 9 'Bojack Unbound' was always one of my favorites because it 'retells' my favorite moment in DBZ history where SS2 Gohan uses the one arm Kamehameha with help from his father's spirit. The plot takes place after the cell games and of all the movies taking place out of story continuity this one is actually possible despite not being considered canon. After destroying King Kai's planet Goku has unleashed a terrible imprisoned Villain, Bojack, and his crew. Meanwhile on earth a millionare throws a tournament that the remaining Z fighter's enter to win the cash, even Chi Chi allows Gohan to attempt the cash prize for his education. In the final rounds Bojack and his gang arrive and start taking out the Z Fighter's eventually leaving only Gohan, the only SS2, to stop them. The ending plays out simliar to the end of the cell games and this movie is very entertaining with another original villain idea and design. I enjoyed it.

All the movie rereleases are not only remastered but come two discs in a steelbook case with nice artwork and title's that line up complementary on a shelf where my old DBZ movies had several mismatched themes across the thirteen movies. The new set designs and remastered and High Def format's may not be enough of a reason for some to double dip for movies they already own but some others and I appreciate it while others who haven't bought them yet get a more affordable chance. Also with two movies per set you save alot of shelf space, and most of us have shelves that are beginning to get a little overcrowded by now.

Great pair of movies, I know everyone likes Broly but in terms of movie villains I would put Broly, Cooler then Bojack and Android 13. They should have brought Bojack back for a second go instead of throwing in more random underdeveloped villains in later movies. My only issue is that they passed up another chance to put Super Saiyan 2 Gohan on a cover opting instead for Vegeta.

If you like this you'll like the steelbook set containing the two specials, 'The History of Trunks' and 'Bardock the Father of Goku'. Thanks for your time.",1229904000,4,3881,4.625544267053701

3692721,5,B001M6SH88,"So I bought this on a whim. I already own both Bojack on DVD and super android 13 on VHS yup good old VHS. I did some digging and this is a good remaster. I love that you can choose between Japanese music with English dub, or American music with Eng dub. Both movies are crisp and worth a buy. I think Bojack is at the top of my favorites list. I was a huge Gohan fan and and super happy with the conclusion of Cell. Bojack is a fantastic movie followup to cell before the lame saiyaman. I own all the movies on DVD some pioneer some newer.

3692726,5,B001M6SH88,"Having been in the theaters, the movies are naturally wide screen and so these aren't pan and scanned.  FUNimation has always seemed to have the most difficult time treating DBZ with the respect it deserves, getting worse and worse with every incarnation it's produced.  The movies aside from having TERRIBLE covers for some of them (Why is Vegeta the central character on the box when Movie # 7 focuses on the TRIO of Super Siayans, and Movie # 9 focuses on SON GOHAN taking a page from his father's book by competing in the First under the heavens martial arts tournament?!) but the quality itself is good for visuals.  I don't bother listening to FUNimation's Dragon Ball dubbed material because it's absolutely trash.  The actors have no range, and make their characters sound entirely one-dimensional with Goku being the stereotypical nerd voice who thinks everyone is his friend and all his jokes are hilarious, and Vegeta and Piccolo sharing the same actor who does the same SEE HOW I GROWL voice for both.  This is not a problem though, just switch to the Japanese audio and enjoy these high quality movies!",1448755200,2,1115,4.816753926701571

They went super saiyan and easily dispatched their foes. The battle with super 13 ended with a classic spirit bomb. Considering not one of them could handle super 13.

The Bojack movie wasn't the best but I enjoyed it. Teen Gohan is a major favorite in DBZ. A movie with him going Super Saiyan 2 is a beautiful thing. When it happens it puts a smile on your face because you know no one is gonna survive this one. I'd suggest buying this one. It's worth the money",1290211200,,627,4.305084745762712
3692769,3,B001M6SH88,"Fun to watch as they might be, these two movies were lacking a bit of something. Android 13 is a fun villain, but the movie is so cliche it just kind of goes through the motions without trying for the most part. It mostly feels like you watched an entire story arc from the TV episodes in about 2 hours...there was nothing particularly special about it, though the fight scenes are fun to watch, as usual.

Bojack Unbound is the Gohan love film, as evidenced by the scenes shown at the end credits of the movie. It's a decent enough film, but I felt it was a bit forced and perhaps during an era in where Toriyama wanted Gohan to succeed his father as the main character, but you can tell he has issues letting go of Goku, as evidenced by the story. Whether this is true or not, I don't really know, but it FELT that way, which is the point I am trying to convey. If you ever disliked Gohan, this film is not for you...I personally liked him much better as a kid than as an adult, so this film was enjoyable for me, but I've seen fans that don't like him just scoff at the film.

These two are movies you might want to skip in the long chain of DBZ movies. Completionists will want to complete their collections but to me, neither of these movies were that special.",1268697600,2,1265,4.20164609053498
