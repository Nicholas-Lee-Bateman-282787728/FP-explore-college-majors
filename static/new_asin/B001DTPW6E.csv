8326357,5,B001DTPW6E,Popular cartoon in Germany years ago and is really simple for a younger child. These are English spoken versions. Basically short adventures that keep  the attention of the little one the entire DVD so yes worth it. Not educational in any way just fun to watch.,1501977600,,261,4.673913043478261
8326358,5,B001DTPW6E,"This is a great european children series, everybody in Germany, Austria and Switzerland knows Fix & Foxi! They say it is even part of the German language to say ""I am fix and foxi"" meaning I am exhausted! Ask anybody speaking German, they know!",1228262400,,244,4.568181818181818
8326359,5,B001DTPW6E,"Fix and Foxi are Germany's equivalent to Disney's Chip n Dale for the 21st century.  The DVD had four cartoons that my four year old daughter found hilarious.  Her response when the DVD was over was ""I want to watch it again"".

Highly recommended!",1219968000,2,247,4.568181818181818
