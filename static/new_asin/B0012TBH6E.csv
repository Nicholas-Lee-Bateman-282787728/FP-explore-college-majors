During this 90 min. program,watch magic being made,via very hot material,see some the best ""gaffers""(not the movie type,okay!)make some very beautiful glass works!!! Get this before it goes out of print!!! And it look and sound good on Blu Ray Disc!!! Don't collect glass works myself,but I DO appiciate great art!!! Recommended for fans of Chihuly or just graet art in general!!! Igot this great disc for $9.99 new at find that quite a bargian!!! No extras here,not even sound options,just enjoy it for the great program it contains,and it's Blu Ray to boot!!! A+",1231891200,11,816,4.963503649635037

3098725,5,B0012TBH6E,We have always been intrigued by the blown glass art form.  This video is truly magnificent. I have watched glass being blown in real time but being a person not gifted with patience watching it in this video is the only way to go.  The music background is upbeat and the energy fantastic.  The results are beautiful.,1226966400,,317,4.526315789473684
3098726,4,B0012TBH6E,"I purchased this Blu-ray because I have always been very interested in glass blowing and glass art.  I previously researched Chihuly's work and observed various demonstrations of Chihuly and many other glass artists.  I wanted more of that, and this Blu-ray did not disappoint.

The disc is composed of various chapters (I think 10), each focusing on a different glass piece that forms the basis for much of Chihuly's work (i.e., seaforms, machia, persian, baskets, etc.)  Each chapter is filmed in the same demonstration auditorium with stadium style seating surrounding a large glass blowing area.  I believe this auditorium is in the Museum of Glass in Tacoma, Washington.

The video quality is excellent, with minor imperfections and noise in various places throughout.  The audio quality is also great.  The soundtrack is comprised of a very strange hodgepodge of mid-90's pop music -- very strange, but mildly entertaining.

I am giving the disc 4 out of 5 stars for one reason.  There is simply not enough focus on what the artists are doing.  There is very little explanation of the tools and techniques that are being used -- which is what I wanted.  Chihuly narrates much of the video, providing a brief history of the particular piece, the people involved in its original creation, and what inspired him to start making them.  Then, the rest is just soundtrack with various individuals creating the pieces (Chihuly himself no longer blows glass).  There is simply not enough focus on the detail or technique for me.  I'm not sure if this information is intentionally withheld as it may reveal Chihuly's secrets, but each segment left me wanting a whole lot more.  Maybe I'm too accustomed to shows like How It's Made, which do a great job of explaining what is going on at all steps.

Corresponding with this lack of detail was a lack of actual camera time on the intricacies of the glass.  For example, when pieces are finished, there is no final shot of the piece.  You simply see the piece transferred into the cooling box and that's it.  No final shot or pan around the piece.

All in all, the video feels more like a preview -- it lacks depth and detail.  There is a lot more personal stories from Chihuly himself, rather than demonstration and explanation of the glass work.  If I could have, I would have rented it and moved along.  I don't think I will ever watch the video again for the next 10 years.  That said, I still admire the artwork, the video quality of the disc, and substance covered throughout",1226016000,9,2525,4.7626728110599075
3098727,1,B0012TBH6E,"I've fallen in love with Chihuly's work. However, I was so disappointed that this, and other Portland Press DVDs, wasn't closed captioned or even subtitled. I can't watch it and understand it without captioning/subtitling. I would have thought that Chihuly would want to reach everyone. I guess not. I hope Portland Press will re-issue this, and other titles, so that it is accessible for everyone.",1220659200,3,398,5.138461538461539
3098728,5,B0012TBH6E,"In 2006 the Museum of Glass in Tacoma, Washington, invited Chihuly to work in their state-of-the-art hotshop, an amphitheater specifically designed to allow the audience to watch the action close at hand. Chihuly's residency soon became the idea for this documentary as he set forth on an ambitious program that would reflect the sum total of his work in glass over the last thirty years. All thirteen of his best-known series were revisited along with more than forty artists and gaffers who had worked with Chihuly at the time of the inception of each series.

3098736,5,B0012TBH6E,"Chihuly would deserve a more detailed review.

I just want to make a quick note about how I was captivated by this documentary about the Chihuly team of craftsmen and craftswomen.

The documentary shows eloquently the skills and strength required from the glass-blowing craftsmen and craftswomen of the Chihuly team to create their masterpieces.

As reported in an other review, Chihuly's health and strength has been impaired by 2 major accidents long ago. We can see, from the documentary, that it must not be easy for the master to need delegating the physical work of the craft to his team mates most of the time.

I also got the ""HD Moods: Chihuly in Nature"" BluRay disc. In this BR disk we see the masterworks that the individual pieces created in the documentary lead to. I saw this BR disc before the documentary. I did not know this artist before and was mesmerized by the works showed in the BR disc presentation.

I find Chihuly to be a great artist, so close to nature, who has a magical touch in handling the mystical capacity of glass to handle light.

I don't understand why Chihuly has a so brief note in Wikipedia. Maybe that's because he is not ""postmodern"" or ""post postmodern"" enough ...

Presently, there is a big exhibition of Chihuly in the Montreal Art Museum. I can't wait to go and see it. Unfortunately, I missed the lecture that the master made at the Museum 2 weeks ago, but I won't miss the exhibition.

(I bought the 2 BR disks on Amazon.ca at a very reasonable price)",1371600000,2,1499,4.588014981273409
3098737,5,B0012TBH6E,"I AM A GLASS BLOWER, AND RESPECT THE TALENT. THE FACILITY WAS WORLD CLASS, AS WERE THE PARTICIPANTS.
DALE'S WORK IS WORLD FAMOUS.",1364428800,2,129,4.6521739130434785
3098738,5,B0012TBH6E,"What an amazing video. Artists at the pinnacle of their medium conjure a wide variety of forms out of molten glass. I found the DVD version at the library, loved it, and bought the BluRay version (which is a steal!). This video has inspired me to watch the streaming web video from the Museum of Glass (the hot shop where this was made) and take glass blowing classes.",1364256000,,368,4.426470588235294
3098739,5,B0012TBH6E,"I bought this for a glass-blowing family member and he was mesmerized by the film. He's somewhat of a Chihuly buff, but he still learned a lot from this video and enjoyed it tremendously.",1357516800,,187,4.529411764705882
3098740,5,B0012TBH6E,This is a great video narrated by Chihuly himself.  He hosts a week of blowing with the different folks he has worked with.  It is really wonderful to watch since we did see his work in the Dallas Arboretum..the Arboretum display does not hold up to the work that is displayed in this cd.  Don't miss it if you love Chihuly,1356652800,,323,4.262295081967213
3098741,5,B0012TBH6E,"I purchased this DVD after seeing Chihuly's works displayed in a number of different venues, being fascinated by them every time.  I do a bit of amateur work in glass, and was anxious to see a master at the process.  But I was hesitant by so many reviews that argued there was too little explanation provided.  This was not my experience at all.  Really, every aspect of this was fascinating.  Chihuly talks a lot about his work, often doing it as the work is being created.  I was amazed to see just how many people are involved in getting a large piece created, and the vivid colors of the work, the blazing furnace, and the workers themselves was to me riveting.  And it was fun to see Chihuly himself!  Having never see an image of him before he was not at all what I expected.  If I'd met him on the street, I'd have guessed he was a bouncer at a local bar, not man with such creative genius.  He's a burly, rugged looking man sporting a black eye patch (a result of an injury from past work with hot glass) that suggests more of a pirate background more than a designer of graceful glass.  And a his body type just defies imagining him as a great artist until you actually see him at work - then you stop seeing the body image and just start seeing how he oversees and develops his work.  The exciting part is seeing just how varied his work has been.  This is a DVD I'd highly recommend to anyone with any interest in glass artistry.",1330560000,3,1440,4.269372693726937
3098742,1,B0012TBH6E,"the production values on this DVD are astonishingly bad. Very disjointed. Very little explanation or introduction into what is happening on the screen. Really weird hipster sound track with lyrics that don't relate to what is on the screen and are very distracting. Bottom line, if you already understand glass blowing and these advanced techniques you will probably get a lot out of watching the DVD. If you don't, it is fairly incomprehensible, yet fascinating to watch. You will not learn anything as nothing is explained. Apparently, Chihuly has very little to do with the making of his trademark glass. Altogether confusing.",1320710400,,629,5.176470588235294
3098743,5,B0012TBH6E,"If you have ever heard of Dale Chihuly, you owe it to yourself to get this film! It shows a large number of small sessions where he & his team create the items he has become famous for. The only thing I hated was the ""background"" music, which was way too intrusive, way too loud, and way too much! I would have loved to hear more dialogue between the craftsmen, or narration, or anything but this annoying music by the tom Tom Club, whoever in the world they are. Sounds like some sort of musical torture session, why the producers used so much and so loud is beyond me.
To top it off, you never know when there is going to be talking by the glass blowers inserted into the music, so if you don't want to miss anything you have to just endure it. But it is still worth the purchase!",1300406400,3,782,4.151315789473684
3098744,3,B0012TBH6E,"It is all so pretty. And fills so many museums now. At the Norton Museum in Palm Beach these pretty things are crammed pell-mell in a transparent  over- hanging ceiling no less. But anyone who thinks, as one museum-type said in the PBS special recently, that this is on the level of Picasso, or other great arts is in for a crash. More like filler.  Somehow it all makes me think of the famous  shattering comment, allegedly, of Sir Thomas Beecham about Debussy's Pelleas and Mellisande: ""It is all quite lovely, but after so many flowing moments, how one longs for a cymbal crash.""",1295308800,,582,4.576923076923077
3098745,4,B0012TBH6E,"Great PBS special showing Chihuly and his extremely gifted peers and students making all that tremendously beautiful glass art that those of us who know and love Chihuly feel such awe and admiration for.  Any true glass art lover will enjoy this educational video which shows the glass blowers at work, from drawing to finished product.  Recommended.",1274572800,4,350,5.12280701754386
3098746,4,B0012TBH6E,"After seeing a large exhibit of Chihuly glass in an art gallery, my husband and I wanted to see how the glass was made.  We really enjoyed this video, which answered our questions about the process.  My only complaint is that the music was extremely irritating, to the point that I will mute the sound when watching this again.",1262995200,3,327,4.52542372881356
3098747,5,B0012TBH6E,"I saw the original show on PBS last year, and immediately called all my friends to watch the repeats during the week.  When I saw the Blu-Ray on a large screen in a Sony Style store, I had to have the disk myself.

I collect glass, blown and fused, and have made stained glass windows off and on for 30 years. I've watched glass blowing dozens of times, and have friends who are commercial glass artists.  Dale Chihuly has never been one of my favorite glass artists, and own none of his designs, but I recognize his design talent and role in the studio movement.

What this video shows is not his technique [since he hasn't blow glass in decades], but his design work with some extraordinary glass artists you rarely see, including William Morris and Lino Tagliapietre, each of whom is a grand master glass blower.

If you want to watch this expecting to learn how to be a glass blower, you will be disappointed - if you want to see how the process of design is carried out into finished work by true experts, this DVD won't disappoint - I just recommend getting the Blu-Ray version, as the colors and sharpness are very good.",1246665600,10,1127,4.451456310679611
3098748,4,B0012TBH6E,"Very interesting journey through the evolution of Chihuly's series / styles.
What is lacking is a tour of each of the finished pieces made during the 1 week residency, nicely displayed in a suitable setting so that the artistry could be best appreciated.  Could even have been done as a separate simple slide show of images lasting 5 to 10 minutes as a DVD extra.",1236211200,3,363,4.584615384615384

3333235,5,B0012TBH6E,"What an amazing video. Artists at the pinnacle of their medium conjure a wide variety of forms out of molten glass. I found the DVD version at the library, loved it, and bought the BluRay version (which is a steal!). This video has inspired me to watch the streaming web video from the Museum of Glass (the hot shop where this was made) and take glass blowing classes.",1364256000,,368,4.426470588235294
3333236,5,B0012TBH6E,"I bought this for a glass-blowing family member and he was mesmerized by the film. He's somewhat of a Chihuly buff, but he still learned a lot from this video and enjoyed it tremendously.",1357516800,,187,4.529411764705882
3333237,5,B0012TBH6E,This is a great video narrated by Chihuly himself.  He hosts a week of blowing with the different folks he has worked with.  It is really wonderful to watch since we did see his work in the Dallas Arboretum..the Arboretum display does not hold up to the work that is displayed in this cd.  Don't miss it if you love Chihuly,1356652800,,323,4.262295081967213
3333238,5,B0012TBH6E,"I purchased this DVD after seeing Chihuly's works displayed in a number of different venues, being fascinated by them every time.  I do a bit of amateur work in glass, and was anxious to see a master at the process.  But I was hesitant by so many reviews that argued there was too little explanation provided.  This was not my experience at all.  Really, every aspect of this was fascinating.  Chihuly talks a lot about his work, often doing it as the work is being created.  I was amazed to see just how many people are involved in getting a large piece created, and the vivid colors of the work, the blazing furnace, and the workers themselves was to me riveting.  And it was fun to see Chihuly himself!  Having never see an image of him before he was not at all what I expected.  If I'd met him on the street, I'd have guessed he was a bouncer at a local bar, not man with such creative genius.  He's a burly, rugged looking man sporting a black eye patch (a result of an injury from past work with hot glass) that suggests more of a pirate background more than a designer of graceful glass.  And a his body type just defies imagining him as a great artist until you actually see him at work - then you stop seeing the body image and just start seeing how he oversees and develops his work.  The exciting part is seeing just how varied his work has been.  This is a DVD I'd highly recommend to anyone with any interest in glass artistry.",1330560000,3,1440,4.269372693726937
3333239,1,B0012TBH6E,"the production values on this DVD are astonishingly bad. Very disjointed. Very little explanation or introduction into what is happening on the screen. Really weird hipster sound track with lyrics that don't relate to what is on the screen and are very distracting. Bottom line, if you already understand glass blowing and these advanced techniques you will probably get a lot out of watching the DVD. If you don't, it is fairly incomprehensible, yet fascinating to watch. You will not learn anything as nothing is explained. Apparently, Chihuly has very little to do with the making of his trademark glass. Altogether confusing.",1320710400,,629,5.176470588235294
3333240,5,B0012TBH6E,"If you have ever heard of Dale Chihuly, you owe it to yourself to get this film! It shows a large number of small sessions where he & his team create the items he has become famous for. The only thing I hated was the ""background"" music, which was way too intrusive, way too loud, and way too much! I would have loved to hear more dialogue between the craftsmen, or narration, or anything but this annoying music by the tom Tom Club, whoever in the world they are. Sounds like some sort of musical torture session, why the producers used so much and so loud is beyond me.
To top it off, you never know when there is going to be talking by the glass blowers inserted into the music, so if you don't want to miss anything you have to just endure it. But it is still worth the purchase!",1300406400,3,782,4.151315789473684
3333241,3,B0012TBH6E,"It is all so pretty. And fills so many museums now. At the Norton Museum in Palm Beach these pretty things are crammed pell-mell in a transparent  over- hanging ceiling no less. But anyone who thinks, as one museum-type said in the PBS special recently, that this is on the level of Picasso, or other great arts is in for a crash. More like filler.  Somehow it all makes me think of the famous  shattering comment, allegedly, of Sir Thomas Beecham about Debussy's Pelleas and Mellisande: ""It is all quite lovely, but after so many flowing moments, how one longs for a cymbal crash.""",1295308800,,582,4.576923076923077

3333243,4,B0012TBH6E,"After seeing a large exhibit of Chihuly glass in an art gallery, my husband and I wanted to see how the glass was made.  We really enjoyed this video, which answered our questions about the process.  My only complaint is that the music was extremely irritating, to the point that I will mute the sound when watching this again.",1262995200,3,327,4.52542372881356
3333244,5,B0012TBH6E,"I saw the original show on PBS last year, and immediately called all my friends to watch the repeats during the week.  When I saw the Blu-Ray on a large screen in a Sony Style store, I had to have the disk myself.

I collect glass, blown and fused, and have made stained glass windows off and on for 30 years. I've watched glass blowing dozens of times, and have friends who are commercial glass artists.  Dale Chihuly has never been one of my favorite glass artists, and own none of his designs, but I recognize his design talent and role in the studio movement.

What this video shows is not his technique [since he hasn't blow glass in decades], but his design work with some extraordinary glass artists you rarely see, including William Morris and Lino Tagliapietre, each of whom is a grand master glass blower.

If you want to watch this expecting to learn how to be a glass blower, you will be disappointed - if you want to see how the process of design is carried out into finished work by true experts, this DVD won't disappoint - I just recommend getting the Blu-Ray version, as the colors and sharpness are very good.",1246665600,10,1127,4.451456310679611
3333245,4,B0012TBH6E,"Very interesting journey through the evolution of Chihuly's series / styles.
What is lacking is a tour of each of the finished pieces made during the 1 week residency, nicely displayed in a suitable setting so that the artistry could be best appreciated.  Could even have been done as a separate simple slide show of images lasting 5 to 10 minutes as a DVD extra.",1236211200,3,363,4.584615384615384

The things he and his team do with glass is so bizarre, and this shows you how they do it.  ""Hotshop"" refers to the fact that they have multiple furnaces going to work the glass at various (high) temperatures.  Worth seeing.",1409702400,,367,4.402985074626866
