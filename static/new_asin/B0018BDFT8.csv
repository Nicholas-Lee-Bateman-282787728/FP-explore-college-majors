In fact, I have watched it three times already because it has a wonderfully soothing effect on me. If you can't find it in print any longer, please do try to rent it. The director has followed Rinpoche on several simple days, before this great master passed into pari-Nirvana. I am extremely grateful to the vendor who still had it in stock. May all beings benefit.",1453766400,,471,4.619047619047619

For those who are on the path of wisdom and compassion, images, sounds and words that are available to us, have the value of a great transmission. In addition, the production is neat, the images and the atmosphere are beautiful, and the extra booklet offers us lessons of beauty.

Don't  miss it and watch again and again without end !",1361750400,,465,4.658536585365853
