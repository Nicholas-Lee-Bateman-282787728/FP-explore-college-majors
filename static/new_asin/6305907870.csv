1109513,4,6305907870,"I had the extreme pleasure of seeing this film at A&O Films B-fest 2001.  Wow!  It's so hard to describe, but if you're into strange things this is a definite must see.  It is guaranteed to mess with your head and keep you begging for more.  When I tell people about this movie they just don't believe me.  Yes, there really is a mariachi band playing every time that guy goes to the toilet!",983318400,9,391,4.22972972972973
1109514,5,6305907870,"A wild, many-layered tale of caballeros, saloon girls, mariachis and  healing,this most remarkable movie places the Holy Trinity (yes, that  Father, Son and Holy Ghost!) in the late 19th century Wild West. Truly a  masterpiece. This film is worth seeing over and over again.",965260800,2,274,5.181818181818182
1109515,5,6305907870,"This movie is amazing. Amazing in the way it effects people. One in five will love it, the other four will hate it, all five will never stop talking about it. I saw this movie when it hit the theaters in NYC in 1970. I, as everybody else in the theater, was confused. For some reason we thought the movie was a fifties revival movie. No one was prepared to see a return of Jesus to the wild west. I bought a copy of this movie and view it at least once a year. It takes me a year to recover. After viewing it many times with others, the power of this movie never fails to exert itself on it's viewers. I have aquaintances who saw this move over twelve years ago. They still bring it up (or blame me for it) when they see me now. About four years ago I read the Bagavad Gita a number of times. One of the many insights I enjoyed was .... ""what Greasers Palace was about."" After viewing this movie numerous times since 1970, I finally got it. It is worth getting and viewing this movie and trying to figure out why it upsets people so much. Greasers Palace does something to dig into the psyche. When I watch Mick Jagger in the movie ""Performance,"" I wonder how that movie could have become the leading cause of in-theater violence in U.S. movie history. Like ""Greasers Palace,"" it makes you wonder.",960336000,31,1297,4.233870967741935
1109727,5,6305907870,"JC with a parachute? A daughter named ""Cholera""? If you like strange with a capitol 'S', this is probably for you. If you live for movies that get you to say ""WTF was that?"", then this is definitely for you. Many movies claim 'cult' status. This one qualifies. But be prepared for 'different' or otherwise you'll be saying to yourself ""Boy, that sure was a waste of 15 bucks.""Oh, the pioneer woman with the arrow - classic.",1403481600,2,423,4.5064935064935066
1109728,5,6305907870,"Something you need to experience!  That's all I want to say!  I totally love this cult gem.  Somewhat of a spoof of The Cassic Midnight Cult Film ""El Topo"".  I'd strongly recommend it!",1392336000,,184,4.484848484848484
1109729,5,6305907870,Greasers palace is a rare combination independent film and obscure western. Why this film has not been widely recognized  is beyond me.,1372896000,3,135,5.136363636363637
1109730,1,6305907870,"Maybe if I was high I would understand this movie.  Since I was not, I don't have a clue what was going on!",1370217600,,107,3.652173913043478
1109731,3,6305907870,"I bought this video based on reviews. It is interesting as it is what I would refer to as am ""experimental film"" from the 60's. There are a number of films from that era that are much better then this though. The premise is basically the story of Jesus and the story takes place in the Ol' West or 1870's.",1369440000,,305,4.1
1109732,5,6305907870,"I bought it because my husband loves silly movies. He likes the people playing in this movie. I wouldn't recommend it for everyone,  If you liked old slap stick movies and just dumb stuff that makes you laugh, the movie will be okay for you.  I give it 5 stars because it entertained my husband.  He laughed through the whole movie, while I thought it was stupid.",1368662400,,363,4.388059701492537
1109733,5,6305907870,First encountered this movie in college. Many years later I was delighted to see that it is now available on DVD. It is still bizarre and very entertaining.,1365724800,,156,4.607142857142857
1109734,5,6305907870,"I love this movie.  So artistic and so very very different.  My husband watched it and just sat there with a blank face.  My brother introduced this movie to me when they were selling them in little vhs shops.  My eyes were glued to this movie.  I couldn't stop watching it and watch it over and over.  As I said, the best cult classic of all time.  My 16 year old watched it for five minutes and couldn't understand any of it's concept and walked out of the room like most teenagers do but as he gets older,  he will see ""the light"" and ""come to his senses"" !!!  Thanks for offering it online because that is the only place i found it was on Amazon!!  Thanks!! Susie W.",1365379200,6,670,4.124031007751938
1109735,5,6305907870,"I have seen this film probably fifty plus times. Many of those times were at the midnight $1.00 showing at George Eliots's Film Forum in Atlanta, when it first came out and later, circa 1972-1975. My crowd is still quoting lines from this film 40 years later. What that says about us, I can't imagine. What it says about the movie is: see it!! The reviewer who pointed out about five viewers seeing it, one liking, four hating, all talking about it, that is very true.

RIP Bestoink Dooley!",1296518400,8,490,4.50561797752809
1109736,5,6305907870,"one of a kind movie. no one got to, gets to or even quite attempts movies like this. not in line with the hollywood market. religious satire just ain't big box office. though it would be nice if mel gibson attempted it, eh?",1264809600,,223,4.209302325581396
1109852,4,6305907870,"As someone else said, ""Amazing in the way it effects people"". My ex would not talk to me for 3 days whenever she saw me watching this on cable.

It is great to have the $10 version available, but I'm dissappointed by the sound quality. The lack of sync is annoying, and there are various ""skips"", notably in Cholera's opening song.

Still, if you like it but don't have $100 you should get this.

If you don't know if you like it, you should definitely do the rental.",1257811200,2,467,4.284090909090909
1109853,5,6305907870,"I'm surprised at how many people have missed that this movie is a not
to subtle send up of Bergman films. The lady who undergoes tragedy
after tragedy, represents long suffering humanity, and there is
a scene where Jesus is leading his followers over the hills, that
came straight out of ""The Seventh Seal"". Nonetheless it is a wonderful
movie, but perhaps not for the faint of heart, or overly religious.",1209168000,,405,4.71830985915493

1109855,2,6305907870,"I had high hopes for this movie, hoping that it would become one of those bizzaro flicks that was worthy of actually buying, but bad editing/directing, horrible overdubbing and sound design, shot/scenes that linger wayyyyy to long (which could be easily forgiven if it weren't for the tedious plot) make it almost unwatchable.
 If you want something thats surreal, I suggest  Jodorowsy's Holy Mountain. If you want something that will offend the religious folk, try Ken Russels ""The Devils.""",1182729600,,491,5.2025316455696204
1109856,5,6305907870,"I saw this movie several times in the 70s at the Texas Union Theater on the UT campus and elsewhere around Austin.  I have NEVER forgotten it, though I had to do a backwards search to determine that it was Alan Arbus who played Jesus parachuting from the sky (Arbus also played Dr. Sydney Freedman on the MASH television series.)  Can't say enough about it -- the symbolism, the sets, the acting, the plot are all superb.  This is perhaps the best parody ever -- and one that has not yet been re-discovered.  I think it's just a matter of time.",1172966400,,544,4.356435643564357
1109857,5,6305907870,"(Sorry, I'm being a bad boy--the negative review below really got to me) I'm sorry but it seems any adventurous film out there gets at least one ""pretentious hip drivel"" review. It's almost always a mercifully short review too because, well, where do you go from there; how do you prove a movie is pretentious or drivel? Strange films always have this potential which is why I generally cut to: Was it fun, weird, interesting, amusing, whatever?

This is a fun film and it's full of surprises so it passes fine. Hey, I hated ""Being John Malkovich"" because there was little in the movie I hadn't seen before. It seemed like a compendium of the film maker's favorite oddball films. You want really oddball? Try ""The Dark Backward"" still awaiting DVD release.",1127520000,4,756,4.7272727272727275

1109859,5,6305907870,"This movie is one of the best movies of all time featuring such memorable lines as Herve Valaquez yelling for his male, flannel night gown  bearded lover, ""Petuniaaaaaa . . . Petuniaaaaaaa"" or the recurring line throughout the movie, ""Who is he gip"" or the other line, ""If ya feel yer healed""  -- this is a can't miss movie.",1050364800,2,324,4.47457627118644
1109860,5,6305907870,"Jesus copulates with a young woman in the front cab of a surrey-with-the-fringe-on-top. He does quite a good job of it-their ecstasy is such that said surrey collapses. Was reminiscent of the fable of Krishna and the milkmaids (although this paralell theme here is handled with ridiculous, outrageous humor- that's fine, humor doesn't have to take a back seat to solemnity!).
Also stuff about valuing humanity over technological comfort- meaning, as a cautionary not to become too enamored of the creation of man instead of recognizing the value of the creation of God.
Also stuff about how some meanness in this world could be the result of dyspepticism.
Good camera work. Good music (which creates a religious feel).
Way to go, Robert Downey, Sr.!!!",1039996800,,751,5.064516129032258
1109861,4,6305907870,"It's a good thing that Robert Downey opted to run the credits first, because after you see the film, you have to sit there and try to process exactly what you just saw.  You kind of have an inkling that it had something to do with the New Testament and the Old/Wild West, but somewhere along the way SOMEBODY dropped the brown acid just to see if it was as bad as they said it was at Woodstock.  And you know what?  It was.
This is a film you will want to show to your friends to see how they react...much like the British couple that kept the placenta from their most recent child's birth, made a pate and served it to friends at a dinner party.  Just remember...your friends may not feel up to operating a car or any other kind of heavy machinery after viewing this.

This film has made more of an impression on me than any other.  Although a seemingly irreverent and pointless parody of The Passion Play, it's imagery and dialogue will stay with you for years to come.  Whether you love it or hate it, you will not forget it.",1497484800,,388,4.287671232876712
