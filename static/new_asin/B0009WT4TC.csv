8068679,4,B0009WT4TC,"First off, let me say that I have a number of Danny Gill DVD's and I think he is an excellent instructor. He offers good explanations, slows examples way down and repeats himself a few times to make sure that everything is understod. Without getting too deep into theory, he offers examples that are very practical which you can immediately incorporate into your playing. That being said, I felt that this DVD was a little shorter than his others and didn't offer as wide of a variety. Perhaps there is simply not as much material to cover in a rhythm course as opposed to a lead course, but I still felt that more information could have been included. Will I keep buying Danny Gill DVDs after this one? You bet.",1279065600,,712,4.484615384615385
