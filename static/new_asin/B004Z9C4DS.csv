4506649,5,B004Z9C4DS,We just found out our 19 month old son is on the spectrum. This is the first video we watched and it not only gave us a lot of information about the ABA therapy but it also gave us hope that with enough therapy he can be taken off the spectrum at some point.,1372464000,3,258,3.7962962962962963
4506650,5,B004Z9C4DS,"Update on the child Ruffin:  Ruffin just graduated from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, cum laude, with a bachelor of science 4 year degree in Electrical Engineering with a Certificate in Robotics, having done 4 undergraduate paid research internships for Cummins Engines and Texas Instruments.  He is currently at the Robotics Institute of Carnegie-Mellon University on a summer paid research internship, and in August of 2013 will begin his fully-funded National Science Foundation PhD graduate study at Georgia Tech in Robotics within the Electrical and Computer Engineering department, working as a teaching assistant.  During college he developed many close friendships with roommates and younger students whom he tutored.  Newer video of Ruffin is posted on the Rose-Hulman Robotics Team Facebook website.  His recovery appears very secure in all domains.

4506652,2,B004Z9C4DS,"As a father of a 4-year-old who is autistic, this video for me was kind of hard to watch. Why? Because the sample children weren't exactly representative of my son. He doesn't speak, but knows what I am saying because he goes to a special autism school set up by the school district, and because my wife and I work with him everyday in addition to taking him to extra speech therapy in an attempt to get speech going. Sometimes verbal doesn't show up as fast as other kids, it may not show up at all, but there is a person in there. This movie only picked the kids as examples who could already speak. What about the children who don't have the physical speech yet, and communicate in other ways like sign language, or speech aids like ipads to make them less frustrated because they can actually interact with the world? This movie openly dismissed those modes of communication outright as inferior, or as one of the parents put it in the film, ""a form of babysitting"", which I found kind of disturbing. Also, the film was really focused on IQ numbers as a form of ""recovery"". I work with plenty of non-autistic people who have really high IQ's, and they are idiots. Not really a good measure to simply base normalcy on IQ scores.",1339891200,13,1231,4.451327433628318
4506653,2,B004Z9C4DS,"Short...I thought it would be more educational.  It seemed like it was promoting a certain treatment or company.  If you can cure autism, why isn't this approach being used for all kids?",1332806400,2,186,4.78125
4506654,4,B004Z9C4DS,I have a child who is 5 and on the spectrum. he is succeeding and doing very well. watching this is like watching my son. he went through all those things and seeing those children succeed and live normal lives brings joy and hope that my son will too. we have to love our children and help them no matter what doctors say and think. thats exactly what these parents did. they had hope and with help their children have succeeded. great job.,1325894400,6,441,4.325301204819277

8449539,1,B004Z9C4DS,Government movie! I have an autistic child and ABA didn't do a thing . Only prayers,1473811200,,83,4.25
8449540,3,B004Z9C4DS,Was good but I expected more information and more kids with severe autism.,1445904000,,74,4.769230769230769
8449541,4,B004Z9C4DS,This movie was very enlightening. As a grad student enrolled in Adolescence Special Education program I learned a lot about ABA intervention and how it can help students with Autism recover. Before watching this documentary I did not believe students could actually recover from autism. I believed students would be able to obtain strategies to help them learn the way their brain works and the best way they can learn. Watching the stories of the four children grow up using ABA intervention especially starting at a younger age; really opened my eyes to think maybe it is true. You can recover from autism with the right help. This documentary was inspiring to me; I would love to have the feeling of the teachers that helped the students learn and see the progress they created in one life.,1424995200,,793,4.795620437956204
8449542,3,B004Z9C4DS,"It's pretty good. But, will never be really cured.  You can significantly improve us, but, that's not the same thing.  Therefore, it provides, a somewhat,  inaccurate final result.",1410652800,,180,5.357142857142857
8449543,4,B004Z9C4DS,So many people do not believe a person can be recovered from autism. This film begs to differ with what will hopefully become a paradigm shift.,1408060800,,143,4.538461538461538
8449544,1,B004Z9C4DS,"Autism is neurological. It is a difference in brain structure and wiring. It has nothing to do with chemicals or hormones, as in mental illness. There is no ""cure"" for autism, only ways to make living with the condition more successful. When methods are in place to cope more successfully, autistics are able to use their strengths more effectively. Autistics do have unique strengths that we would not have if we were ""cured."" Even in severe cases, we are more detail oriented than most and our concentration is more intense than most. These two traits alone can help us excel in areas neurotypicals cannot. So, it's not that the video gives false hope that life can get better- just a misguided view of what to hope for and why.",1406419200,6,730,4.666666666666667
8449545,2,B004Z9C4DS,"I thought this would provide concrete skills for helping kids with autism. Instead it was a series of vignettes on families dealing with autism and how much their ABA therapist helped them. But as far as specific techniques on how to help, there was nothing.",1394409600,,258,4.7555555555555555
8449546,5,B004Z9C4DS,This movie is just great. I got an up and personal view of applied behavioral analysis. If any parent is considering ABA for their child this is a must see video.,1386720000,3,162,4.258064516129032
8449547,5,B004Z9C4DS,"A must watch for those parents searching for good answers and real stories. Dr. Doreen is really amazing, we enjoyed her explanations, especially the pointers she gives to  consider for progress.",1374105600,2,195,5.290322580645161
