This cartoon version of the Wizard of Oz (based on details from the 1939 film) was originally on ABC Saturday mornings. Then a year ago, it was put on Toon Disney, and then canceled three months ago. These two episodes were the first two I saw of the series. The first episode on the tape is about a hyena who is jealous of Lion, and steals his roar (capturing Dorothy) and her friends must rescue her. The second is when Dorothy is whisked back to a fake Kansas, right into the trap of the Wicked Witch (disguised as Auntie Em and Uncle Henry) Great film! Cute stories! Fun for the whole family! ^_~",1048636800,3,661,4.21259842519685
