2452480,4,B000C20VIC,"Quick delivery.  There are four episodes (3 good, 1 too sappy) of Combat all in B/W.",1232323200,5,84,4.25
2452481,5,B000C20VIC,"This series, in my opinion, was amoung the very best of the 60's.  Combat! has great storylines that follow American G.I.'s from Normandy and beyond.  Combat! provides excellent acting and great ""edge of your seat"" storylines.  Combat! was the very best TV Action/Drama on TV during the 60's. I highly reccomend Combat! to anyone that likes W. W. II.  You cannot go wrong buying this Series, it will not disappoint.",1209600000,15,415,4.885714285714286

2452483,5,B000C20VIC,"If you grew up in the 60's then you need to get this DVD. Compare this so called ""old show"" to the new ones on TV. There is no comparision.",1397865600,,139,3.6666666666666665
2452484,4,B000C20VIC,"Back in the early 60's I was in the Air Force stationed at RAMSTEIN AFB, Germany...we had one tv station run by the military with limited programming and none live since satellite tv was not available...One of the favorite shows was Combat as it depicted the GI's in mostly France fighting the Germans...it was a good tool for trying to learn the language also...

Seeing those shows today I almost have to laugh at its simplicity but back then they were enjoyable entertainment for the troops...And they sure do bring back memories for a guy who was in his early 20's back then...",1387238400,,581,4.640776699029126
2452485,5,B000C20VIC,"Excellent DVD for Combat fans. Vic Morrow (aka Saunders) was a good actor and even better director...I believe his best work in the series was directing ""Hills are for Heroes)...",1382486400,,178,4.966666666666667
2452486,5,B000C20VIC,Sgt Saunders ( Vic Morrow) is the epitomey of the best example of a Sergeant during WW II . This video and all the Combat Videos are very worth the money if you like things pertaining to WW Ii and how the Army fought in France.,1364774400,,227,3.9565217391304346
2452487,5,B000C20VIC,"Watching this as a kid, all we saw was the action.  As an adult, we see the human drama in the episodes.  It's a great show, great price for this set.",1361491200,,150,3.806451612903226
2452488,5,B000C20VIC,"A great show that I haven't seen in many years. I recently found a channel that replays the series and started watching again, problem is that it is on at 3 AM.  So I bought some of these for an emergency.",1360540800,,205,4.0

2452490,4,B000C20VIC,"If there was an actor who play a non-com better than any other actor , other than John Wayne, It would have to be Vic Morrow. He made his character beleivable and he made his notch in the profession.",1351900800,,199,4.128205128205129
2452491,5,B000C20VIC,"I enjoyed Combat when I was a child. Vic Morrow was always my favorite on the show! This set is great, just
as I remembered it!! The only downside of this set, is that there is only 4 shows on it. There were so many
great Combat shows that featured Vic Morrow, it would have been tough to choose the best! This was a teaser
of Combat and makes you want the complete series. Well, I had to purchase the complete series after viewing
this DVD. If you liked the show and Vic Morrow as much as I do, I recommend that you purchase the complete
series now instead of this set. If you are just curious about the show, by all means, I recommemd this set!!",1278028800,15,647,4.102362204724409
8095359,5,B000C20VIC,"Many programs of the era had their own introductory music and this program was no exception; the music was by Leonard Rosseman.

They always start out with ""staring Rick Jason and Vic Morrow."" Instead of great sweeping epics this program focuses on a single squad with their trials and tribulation with confronting the Germans in WWII. Each episode is one hour and has to oppose a problem and a solution in that time. This was back in the time of professional privates.

In 1967-1968 Vietnam if you were lucky certain areas actually had TV broadcasting at 1600 hrs. You guessed it; this was one of the programs. I wonderer what the locals thought of the episode?

This would be a good series to own. Not just for the nostalgia, but the personal conflicts portrait in the program are still with us today.",1506643200,20,803,4.640845070422535
8095360,5,B000C20VIC,Sgt. Chip Saunders in action; Vic Morrow took the role and ran away with it. He brought the harsh reality of war to life in this show!,1502064000,,134,4.0
