2918507,1,B000UAE7N6,I'll not belabor the point. It's a poor remake of Six degrees of Seperation. The only thing worse than the acting is the videography,1205107200,3,132,4.541666666666667
2918508,1,B000UAE7N6,"Even though I purchased this movie at Amazon and on sale, all I can say is what a waste of money.  The plot is obviously written by a self loathing writer who surrounds himself in darkness.  Not one of his sordid tales has a glimmer of happiness. The acting is shady at best.  Moral of the story seems to be gay men can't be happy and the world is dark.  Do yourself a favor and pass on this purchase.",1201046400,9,401,4.037974683544304
2918509,4,B000UAE7N6,"Based on the Michael Kearns' play 'Complications', NINE LIVES  introduces a sequence of the lives of nine men who are interconnected by the fact they are all participants in the roundelay of casual sexual encounters.  The technique used is that of each actor speaking to the audience about his background and how each ended up in the rather sad state of living in which they find themselves. The stories are interesting if a bit repetitive (parental abuse of both the verbal and physical type, the agonies of 'coming out'. and the spectre of AIDS), but the script keeps the conversations mixed well with actual encounters so that we the audience are less confessional listeners so much as participants in the results of living life on the edge.

The cast is uniformly fine, a factor that keeps the film afloat in many instances.  Particularly fine is Steve Callahan ('East Side Story') who seems to have a promising career.  Director Dean Howell (who also wrote the screenplay) is another solid actor as are Eric Turic, William Christian, John Ganun, Dennis Christopher, Nick Salamone, Debra Wilson - well, the entire cast.  The direction is tight and flows well from 'life to life', using sexual scenes where indicated, and keeping the focus on the darker side of the round of confessions. The cinematography by Mark A. Ryan keeps the look dark and coarse and a bit too much on the dreary side.  The makeup artist Shari Balbien is none too kind to the actors' looks. Made in 2004 the film holds up well as far as content, a sad statement about the slow progress in the struggle against HIV infection.  Grady Harp, January 08",1199664000,8,1625,4.7785714285714285
2918510,2,B000UAE7N6,"This film takes us into the lives of nine people and shows how their lives are interrelated.  The characters talk to the camera a lot which can be irritating but in this film works fairly well.  Most of the characters spend time relating their darker sides to us. So far, so good, right? The problem is that most of these people are not people I would go to coffee with let alone desire to know. I just didn't care about the characters. They're all whiny, negative, out-of-control addicts. They keep making excuse after excuse for their behavior and blaming others for their lot in life. At the risk of sounding like a Fox News Channel pundit - can we get a little personal responsibility here? And with a wafer-thin plot there's not much else to recommend this movie. Not every movie has to end Happily Ever After but this movie simply spews ugliness, negativity, darkness and ultimately boredom. Two stars for decent production values, originality and acting. Still, I'd never watch it again.",1195430400,16,994,4.7398843930635834
2918511,4,B000UAE7N6,"I didn't expect this movie to be anything more than a mediocre independent film at best and I actually rented it by accident.  I was pleasantly surprised however that it delivered layered storytelling, good acting (for the most part), and a very good cinematic experience altogether.  The movie's filming and editing was very professional as well.  I highly recommend it.",1194912000,6,371,5.15
2918512,4,B000UAE7N6,"Like a gay ""La Ronde"", ""Nine Lives"" (2004) follows nine individuals in a string (actually, it's a circle) of anonymous gay sexual encounters of a diverse group of individuals.  The sex actually is secondary to the obvious emotional baggage of the people involved, based on past and concurrent relationships in their lives, dissatisfaction with the curves that life has thrown them, all leading to a disconnected and potentially dangerous (physically and mentally) need for such encounters.

The cast is much more professional than one would expect from a (primarily) gay film, and includes Golden Globe winner Dennis Christopher (""Breaking Away"") as well as several other actors with significant credits, including screenwriters Michael Kearns and Dean Howell (Howell also directs).  The skill of the acting makes the film much more engrossing than it would be in the hands of a less talented cast.  The technique of the characters talking directly to the audience, explaining their feelings, works well in this context.

DVD extras include a deleted scene, outtakes and commentaries.  Not rated, but would be a hard ""R"" due to content, language, numerous scenes of simulated sex and some partial nudity.  I give the film four stars out of five.",1191974400,32,1245,5.226130653266332
2918563,4,B000UAE7N6,"This is one of the best portrayals of many a gay man's trajectory amidst the different cultures  and satisfying those
carnal needs. Is it serendipity ?  Must I give more weight to meeting another man cementing tragedy? Or is this the last
of the scars ? Perhaps to some we are forced to take responsibility  for these sexual intersections in our life.  Have  I ever
dealt with consequences? This film begs the question.
 With such dire ret- ands, do we still gamble or  simply overlook the obvious  as lust pulls ahead of desire.
Superb tenderness from the actors.

2918566,4,B000UAE7N6,"A video to watch on an evening with nothing else to do.  The action is of nine guys short stories that are all inter connected, which none of the characters know about.  Some interest.",1359331200,2,184,4.382352941176471
2918567,4,B000UAE7N6,"This is a very, very good movie: intelligent, compelling and very well written, acted and produced. At first I did not understand all the negative and mediocre reviews it got. When I reread them I noticed two things: Many of those reviews complained that it was too much like a filmed play and that so much dialog was hard to keep up with; and many of those same reviews contained numerous spelling and punctuation errors. Those two observations suggest that some of the people who do not like this movie may have trouble with the English language and would probably be happier watching an action movie or a physical comedy than a dialog-heavy character study like this.

So I am writing this in case anyone who prefers character to action is considering watching Nine Lives: you may like it very much more than most of the reviews here would lead you to expect. I certainly did.",1296345600,4,879,4.634615384615385
2918568,1,B000UAE7N6,"""Nine Lives"" is a very poor film from every single artistic angle; from its direction? has-been actors, dialogue (trite) and repetition---my short version---not worth the money at any price.

2918569,1,B000UAE7N6,"I wanted to like this film, with all the comparisons to Six Feet Under, Six Degrees of Separation, etc. Instead, what I got was a bunch of boring vignettes about boring people. The inter-relation between them seems forced as a plotline, and failed to really make any point. Most of the characters were quite unlikeable too, and you fail to connect with any of them enough to really care what they are going through. It does somewhat have a documentary feel, but a very boring one nevertheless. I struggled to even finish the film.",1248912000,4,530,4.648936170212766

Nothing original and interesting, just stories, which by themselves were not interesting, with some flashes of simulated sex, which wasn't interesting either, thrown in for no reason.

Lack of really likable characters does diminish the overall theme and makes you not care as much as to their own personal stories. Most come off selfish, self centered and superficial. The monologues directly to the audience seem more theatrical that film but most are expertly done. Was interesting seeing Dennis Christopher in this film and he gave probably the most professional acting job of all the cast.

8212646,4,B000UAE7N6,"""Nine Lives"" is a film anthology ostensibly about HIV/AIDS in the Gay Community. That is the simple connection of nine people. The film is greater than the setting in which it is placed. It is about people, love, cruelty, repression and dominance. It is about needs and desires. It is about life not death. After all, death comes to all of us in one form or another. It is about how we choose to deal with the things we have no control over. It is about refusing to see what exists because it does not fit in the world we have chosen to believe in. This movie will make you think and open your eyes a little wider.",1378512000,3,614,4.211864406779661
