432271,5,6302148677,"This film was an ongoing joke with Jack Benny as at the time of its release it took a flop at the box office. However, time has treated this comedy/fantasy well and if you give it a try you will find a truly original  comic masterpiece. Here is a film with many 1990's themes...angels, the end  of the world, great visual effects, sex, and slapstick comedy. Maybe it was  a little ahead of its time. Great performances from Jack Benny, Alexis  Smith, and Guy Kibbee as well as a memorable ""Looney Tune"" style  score from the great Franz Waxman. Give this zany 1945 film a chance as you  will be surprised how wild they could get back then and how funny and  strange an ""old"" film can be.",923961600,8,687,4.3203125

432435,5,6302148677,"Jack Benny's co-stars in Raoul Walsh's THE HORN BLOWS AT MIDNIGHT (1945) are Alexis Smith, Dolores Moran, Guy Kibbee, Allyn Joslin, John Alexander, Reginald Gardiner, Franklin Pangborn, Margaret Dumont, Mike Mazurki and Robert Blake.

It's the story of a disgruntled 3rd trumpet player who's stuck on a quarter-to-twelve radio show sponsored by Paradise Coffee, ""the coffee that makes you sleep."" During a pre-airtime rehearsal Athanael keeps playing flat and the other two horn players rat him out. He tells them they'll be sorry they did.

Now the show begins. An announcer's sonorous voice lulls Athanael to sleep and he dreams he's an angel who's been sent to Earth to blast his heavenly horn on the stroke of midnight and cause the planet's destruction. All the people we've met during the previous sequence appear in his dream, but as different characters. For example, the two trumpeters are now fallen angels who love being humans and are determined to stop Athanael from completing his mission. Osidro (Joslyn) and Doremus (Alexander) each have a bad side effect of going rogue. Once an hour (on the half) both experience violent shaking spasms.

This is actually a very good comedy, easily Jack Benny's best, yet for years after on his radio show the mere mention of ""Horn Blows at Midnight"" was used as a put-down.

Highly recommended!

Jack Benny's self-deprecating humor makes this film out to be one of the worst movies ever made but I liked it. The workings of Heaven, the fallen angels, swing bands, giant advertising gadgets all combine to make this a movie that is unique and fun. With the band from the radio show doing double-duty as the people involved with the mission and other subtle bits make this a must-see as far as I'm concerned.",1408320000,,636,4.482758620689655
432473,2,6302148677,"this is the one that History remembers as THE Jack Benny movie. for better or for worse.
but then, if it is remembered as the Ishtar of it's day, Jack has no one to blame but himself. all that really happened at the time was that it failed to make a particular splash. people were more indifferent toward than outraged by the film. but Jack Benny was never a man to let a good gag get away (particularly at his own expense), so he quickly positioned the film (which he himself wasn't overly thrilled with) as one of his neurotic radio character's sins. it wasn't long before it went from just another case of not ""clicking"" with an audience to an uncontainable catastrophe of Vesuvius proportions, laying everything in it's path waste. for instance...
* about a year later, Jack announces that he is the subject of an upcoming Warner Brothers biopic. why? it seems that The Horn Blows At Midnight resulted in thousands of requests for ""the life of Jack Benny.""
* Jack isn't the only one to have a promising film career cut short by the film. his leading lady is now a waitress (or ""carhop""), at a local drive in restaurant, the producer is now his butcher, and the director now guards the front gate of Warner Brothers Studios.
Jack L., Sam, and Harry didn't escape entirely unscathed, either. the studio narrowly missed being, depending on the gag, anything from financially crippled by the film to razed to the ground over it by torch bearing rioters a' la Frankenstein.
* local theaters continue to screen the film in spite of (or because of) it's dubious standing, because it proves conducive to unique business opportunities. housed theaters playing the film can rent their resultantly empty screening rooms out for storage, and drive-in theaters show it at the height of the new car season when they can rent themselves out to neighboring car dealerships.
* when Jack does his version of It's A Wonderful Life, his guardian angel takes him to a Warner Brother Studios where there's a positively ridiculous amount of jollity. what's everyone so happy about? what else? ""you were never born so there was never a Horn Blows At Midnight.""
* Dennis Day was absent from the series during the war because he was serving in the Navy. he mentions having seen the film at the time, and Jack asked if they screened it for ""the boys."" says Dennis, ""no, the Japs. i snuck in.""
* Jack is walking down the street and meets a pubescent fan who asks for an autograph. as he writes, the lad wonders aloud why a great star like Jack Benny never made any movies. ""isn't that wonderful."" says Jack as he walks away afterward. ""a whole generation that'll never know."" and the basic punchline is so firmly established that that's all he has to say.
interestingly, Jack's relentless ragging of the film is priceless publicity, so that multitude who missed it are soon demanding a rerelease. this time it does pretty decent box office, but it seems to be another kind of disappointment. audiences who've been trained to expect a debacle of Ed Wood proportions are soon saying that the film is actually too good!!
so history and circumstance having given the film a uniquely garbled reputation. it's not quite the Last Action Hero of it's day that Jack and/or his writers would have you think. but unfortunately, it's not far off.
Jack plays Athaniel, and angel sent down to Earth on a singular mission. it seems the ""Chief Of The Small Planets"" has had about as much of those barbaric Earthlings as he's willing to put up with. so Jack's job is to blow a special horn on the stroke of midnight, thus kickstarting the Apocalypse. not only does it have an intriguing and edgy premise, but it gives Jack a unique character, a well-meaning but bumbling sort of Charlie Brown amongst angels, and some good moments to work with as his character attempts to decipher how this kooky world works.
but alas, all this promise gets lost somewhere and the film ultimately deteriorates into a tedious string of not particularly well mounted chases sequences and slapstick set pieces. it's very premise raises a though-provoking question about how insensitive or irresponsible or downright evil someone can be before negating a potential second chance, but the film doesn't manage to answer it very well. in fact, by resorting to that time-honored Hollywood copout, the whole affair turning out to of been a dream, it pretty much weasels out of having to try.
as Fate would have it, Jack would dramatize the film a few years later on a radio ""anthology"" series called The Ford Theater. this time, The Horn Blows At Midnight is what it should've been all along: a serious (as in ""dedicated,"" not as in ""not funny"") study of the moral and metaphysical issues it raises. and better still, it's no mere dream this time, it's actually happening. (within it's own ""reality,"" that is.) but of course these renovations are a textbook example of the barn door locked after the escape of the horse.
so all things considered, it's a toss-up. it's hardly the rack-&-thumbscrews of a movie it would go down in history as, but it's not the thought-provoking masterpiece it had the potential to be, either. of course on the other hand, it would've cost Jack one of his most enduing running-gags if it had been a good movie.
(and anyway, there are reasons why the world would've been more forgiving of mediocre movies at the time. for one thing, Jack's tenure n the movies coincided with The Great Depression and World War II. these were pretty dark days, and most people needed the escapism of movies too much to quibble about how masterfully crafted a given specimen of escapism might've been. you might also argue that since this was before television, let alone cable tv or home video, the chance to see a movie was slightly more elusive and perhaps that much more magical for it.)
the major inherent tragedy is that by ruthlessly belittling The Horn Blows At Midnight, Jack inadvertently sprouted a misconception (particularly among younger fans to come) that it was the one and only film he ever made. if this film did any major harm it was by keeping certain people from even knowing about, much less making any effort to see, the highlight of Jack's work on the Silver Screen and the one film he was actually proud of, To Be Or Not To Be. (it might also contribute that that film bombed as well, but for such completely different reasons that it's another issue entirely. see the various reviews of To Be Or Not To Be, including my own, for that story.)
in a nutshell, The Horn Blows At Midnight is better than it's reputation would suggest...just not enough better to be worth the righteous indignation.",1407888000,,6662,4.709511568123394
432474,4,6302148677,"Jack Benny made a mini-career out of poking fun at this box-office bomb. But it isn't a bad film, by any means.

Unlike Bob Hope, who had a long and generally successful screen career, Benny made few films, and not many were successful. This was probably because there was no way Benny could be construed as a romantic lead. ""Horn""'s failure isn't due to an unfunny script or poor production values (some of the sets are lavish), but probably the fact that we know right from the start that Benny's character is dreaming. As the Earth /isn't/ going to be destroyed, the audience has no reason for emotional investment in the characters or their situation.

""Horn"" unavoidably anticipates ""Wings of Desire"". There's a scene in which Benny -- who has no experience as a mortal -- enters a delicatessen and orders all sorts of food, to learn what food tastes like.

There's a scene in which an angel takes a picture of Benny with an ""instant-picture"" view camera -- two years /before/ Edwin Land demonstrated practical instant photography to the American Optical Society. Land showed ""Horn"" at Polaroid's 1945 Christmas party, and when this scene came on, told his employees ""That's what we're going to do.""

""Horn"" originally appeared on a two-disk LaserDisc set with ""George Washington Slept Here"" (a better film that anticipates ""Mr Blandings Builds His Dream House"" and ""The Money Pit""). It's unfortunate both films aren't available in a two-disk DVD set at a budget price -- they're both worth seeing once.",1406160000,,1508,4.901960784313726

I've got mixed feelings about it. In many ways it's a very well made film, and has some special effects which are - for their day, quite amazing. However, I think Jack Benny himself is absolutely dreadful, and I'm a huge Benny fan. He doesn't seem to be half the actor or performer he is on radio, and comes across as extraordinarily camp.

The one he made the most fun of on his radio and tv shows and got miles and miles of laughter out of disdaining turns out to be one of the most entertaining films he made.  The heyday of studio film making is evident in the fabulous set pieces and casting and in the overall production design.  The wonderfully whimsical plot takes full advantage of Benny's mirror faced takes and his impeccable timing, which of course is what the movie is all about....timing!!  I find it hilarious and every bit as good as 'Buck Benny Rides Again' or his masterpiece,  'To Be Or Not To Be'.  Admittedly Benny's movie career (Charlie's Aunt and George Washington Slept Here being his only other decent efforts in my humble opinion)  left much to be desired but he had nothing to feel ashamed about here.

432511,5,6302148677,"When Jack as Athanael is sent to Earth via a cosmic elevator from tufts of clouds in heaven to a department store conveyor overseen by Franklin Pangborn at his exasperated best, the angel's reactions almost seem to imply Athanael is alien to human beings, kind of bemused by everything that he sees and/or happens around him, unless it deals with frantic events at high places.

Longtime comic book lovers and Batman fans know that Dick Sprang used to love to have Batman and Robin fight criminals on rooftops adorned with gigantic promotion props. The rooftop setting for ringing in the end of the world could not be more apt if Dick Sprang drew it.

The place where Athanael is to blow his horn is at the top of a New York skyscraper adorned with a huge working advertising display of a mechanical exhibit that consists of a gigantic coffee pot that tilts and seemingly pours coffee into a small swimming pool size coffee cup. When the cup is filled with dark liquid, a huge spoon lifts out of another gigantic prop, a sugar bowl, and deluges the cup with thick snowfall-like sweetener! When that is done, a lovely mammoth creamer deluges its contents, a torrent of milk.

This place has it all, and Jack and the others, trying to end the world, or stop it, or just caught up in the frantic free-for-all way up over the city midnight streets, would play this for suspense and laughs much, I'm sure, to the pleasure of those who fondly remember that time period in Batman's comic book life.

Check it out. See if I'm not right.

432513,3,6302148677,This is a great old movie from1941. It is imaginative and as silly as a movie like this should be. I thought it was very entertaining.,1390348800,,134,4.1923076923076925
432514,2,6302148677,"I think that of all the movie genres, comedy is the most personal. What makes one person double over with laughter can put another to sleep. Personally, I find Jack Benny to be hilarious. His early TV shows were wonderful, and one comment that would appear from time to time would be Jack's reference to ""a movie"" that he made. He was always referring to THE HORN BLOWS AT MIDNIGHT, and of course that would get some caustic remarks by his guest star and laughter from the audience. The way Jack talked about the film made you think that it was the only one he ever did. He actually did more than a few films, including Ernst Lubitsch's comedic masterpiece, TO BE OR NOT TO BE - Jack Benny's finest work.
On the other hand, THE HORN BLOWS AT MIDNIGHT is fair at best. The opening scenes in ""Heaven"" and in a recording studio promise something really good. Unfortunately the bulk of the middle of the film leading up to the climax consist mainly of ""drawing room"" situations, which I always find incredibly boring. There's several funny scenes in a restaurant and in a outdoor amusement park, but every time the movie comes back to the hotel, it drags.
For me one of the most annoying characters in the film was a hotel detective. If we see his pained expression once, we see it 25 times. You can see most of the jokes in the movie coming a mile away, and as another reviewer commented, ""they still take their time in getting there.""
Jack Benny is very good with his character, but to see a film that really displays his talents, seek out and grab a copy of TO BE OR NOT TO BE. Forget this one.",1388275200,,1593,4.367003367003367

When ever it was played again I couldn't wait for the part where Jack Benny falls into the coffee pot on the billboard on the side of the building. It was a great comedy about the final judgment of the world. I wish there were comedies like that today, but that was a movie of that time period and probably wouldn't work in our present time where innocence has been lost.",1383523200,,493,4.2
432517,4,6302148677,"Jack Benny got a lot of mileage on his program joking about what a turkey this film is.  I don't know about it's critical or commercial fortunes at the time of its release but the passage of time has been very kind to this film.  What distinguishes it is an imaginative story and for it's day terrific art direction and special effects.  This looks like it was a big budget film so that may explain some of the brickbats.  Benny as the Angel Athanael sent to earth to Earth because of its inhabitants wicked ways plays the part as an earnest bungler.  Benny is good but he has been better in films like ""To Be or Not To Be"" and ""George Washington Slept Here"".  Alexis Smith and Dolores Moran are fine as the requisite eye candy.  Divorce this film from the bad reputation Benny and his cohorts attributed to it you should find it satisfactory.  This is a DVD-R issued by Warner Brothers.

Jack Benny is a marvelous comic actor and 'THE HORN BLOWS AT MIDNIGHT' showcases his talents well.

There are some very impressive big budget sets in this film and the giant animated coffee pot (billboard) is one you'll never forget.

It was that weird journey through the coffee machine and the surreal production design that grabbed me...before I had any idea what production design even was.

Naturally I've always been a Jack Benny fan, the man who gave everyone else the great lines but it was he who was actually funny (and just how did he do that?).  I trust to give it five stars because of the lasting impression it made on me.

That concept of whether the world was too filled with evil was particularly relevant in 1945 as the terrible atrocities of WW 2 became apparent. The philosophical meaning was joined a short time later with James Stewart's It's a Wonderful life, where the absence of one good human being could change the course of History.

He made only a handful of films and ""The Horn Blows at Midnight"" was certainly less successful in the cinema than ""Charley's Aunt"", ""George Washington Slept Here"" or ""To Be or Not to Be"". In fact poking fun at the failure of ""The Horn"" became a regular feature of Jack's monologues and humour. I saw the film as a teenager on TV a long time ago, and have searched for it repeatedly over the past years. It's not yet on DVD, but here at least is a good copy on VHS. I don't know why it failed in the cinema. The plot is light and moves at a good pace. There are some very funny scenes and Jack has some excellent supporting cast.

This film treats the end of the world as a comic idea. It shows life and attitudes in America, as seen by Hollywood. Was it exaggerated?

432557,5,6302148677,"Jack Benny and Alexis Smith will never win any popularity contests as the m,ost lovable stars in the movies.  For both of them, there's a sheen of cold that keeps them from the complete warmth we love about our top stars, from Marilyn to John Wayne to Ingrid Bergman; for Benny and Smith, it's like the old carton of sherbet that Debbie Reynolds finds in her freezer when Albert Brooks comes home to live with her once again.  He opens it, it's all coated with ice, and Debbie explains, ""Honey, that's just its protective shell!""

However this vehicle plays up to their strengths, with Benny as a peculiar angel (a trumpeter with a delusion of angelhood) and Alexis Smith looking radiant as she pretends to play a harp in a 40s orchestra.  She's no Harpo Marx but the instrument itself suits her down to the ground.  The big set-pieces and the heaven sequences are designed and photographed by Robert Burks in an amazing simulacrum of classic Surrealist cinema; Burks, of course, would later shoot all the great Hitchcock pictures of the 1950s, from Strangers on a Train to Vertigo, and he anticipates some of the magic realism of those pictures with his imagery here, it's just confounding what he was able to do.  You'd think that George Pal was behind these fantasies.

I don't know why some movies just slip into obscurity, and maybe the financial debacle of this one has given it a bad name, but it is prime for rediscovery now.  If it's a failure it's a fascinating one.  Just give it a chance and you'll find yourself with your jaw down on the floor.  Had HORN BLOWS AT MIDNIGHT been signed by Ernst Lubitsch, or Michael Powell, it would be popping up on Ten Best Lists all the time, and Criterion would have issued a deluxe DVD edition of it long ago (a limited edition, probably and it would have been taken off the market thus causing artificial price increases all over the internet).",1126742400,4,1895,4.596439169139466
432558,3,6302148677,"The Horn Blows at Midnight is one of those enchanting movies that deal with angels or spirits visiting the Earth and interacting with mortals.  Other films along the same lines include The Bishops Wife, A Guy Named Joe, That's The Spirit, Here Comes Mr. Jordan, Heaven Can Wait, On Borrowed Time, Angel On My Shoulder, Beyond Tomorrow, and more recently, City of Angels and The Dust Factory.

Unfortunately, despite the fact that Jack Benny was one of the most talented comics of his time, The Horn Blows At Midnight is one of the least enchanting of the films I've just listed, possibly excepting Angel On My Shoulder and Heaven Can Wait (1943).  It has some great actors including Alexis Smith (Gentleman Jim, Beau James), Allyn Joslyn (Only Angels Have Wings), Reginald Gardiner (Claudia, Cluny Brown, etc.), and Guy Kibbee (Little Lord Fauntleroy).

Benny plays a trumpet player in a radio band who, put to sleep by a mesmerizing coffee comercial, dreams that he's an angel sent to destroy the Earth.  It seems this little planets out of control, morally at least, so the head angel in charge of small planets (Guy Kibbee) sends him to blow his horn at midnight atop the Universal Hotel, signalling judgment day.  The premise has plenty of funny potential, and there is just enough comedy along the way to recommend the movie, but the story doesn't seem to be going anywhere, and never does, right up to the cop-out ending, which was a little disappointing.

Jack Benny is my favorite comedian, so imagine my disappointment when I found this movie a little disappointing.  I'm tempted to give it 4 or 5 stars just because Benny's in it, but I can resist that temptation only because I know he had several better films.  My own favorite is The Meanest Man in The World; others include George Washington Slept Here, Charlie's Aunt, and The Broadway Melody of 1936.  Hopefully some of these better films will become available on DVD some day.  Having said all this, I still recommend the film to Jack Benny fans or anyone who likes these old angel or spirit movies - if you like one of those movies I listed above and want more like it, here it is.  But if you haven't seen Jack Benny before, don't judge him by this one; check out an old TV episode or one of his other movies.",1122595200,,2278,4.6393034825870645
432588,4,6302148677,"In his long running radio and television show, Jack Benny often built jokes around THE HORN BLOWS AT MIDNIGHT--a movie described as so awful that it put an end to his movie career.  These jokes always got a laugh, but rumors of the film's failure were really only comic exaggeration; true, it had not been a major hit, but neither was it a major failure.  And if Benny's film appearances were few and far between after 1945, this was more a matter of his incredibly popular radio and television series than with a lack of offers.

THE HORN BLOWS AT MIDNIGHT is not a great film, but it is a very interesting one and quite often a very entertaining one.  The story concerns a trumpet player (Benny) in love with a harpist (Alexis Smith)--who gets him a radio job on the ""Paradise Coffee Program,"" which advertises a coffee that promises a gentle sleep and sweet dreams.  And dream he does, but one would not call it sweet: he dreams he is an angel sent to earth to blow the trumpet that will destroy the world.

Although the script is a bit weak, it has some really great concepts.  Heaven is a bureaucracy beset by an endless orchestra and a shortage of angel-power.  Elevators take angels to earth, right to the lobby of a New York hotel--and tie up elevator traffic, much to the annoyance of guests.  And fallen angels lie in wait to trip Ethanael up!  The art direction is extremely fine, dribbling comic surrealism with tremendous flair.  In perhaps the film's most memorable scene, Ethanael finds himself drowning in a gigantic cup of coffee.  Paradise Coffee, no doubt!

Benny, co-star Alexis Smith, and such memorable characters as Franklin Pangborn, Margaret Dumont, and Guy Kibbe perform the show with as much energy as they can muster, and at it's best the movie is hilariously over-the-top.  The script lets them down once too often for comfort, but even so the whole thing makes for an entertaining show.  Recommended as imaginative, often extremely clever fluff.

432589,4,6302148677,"I still remember seeing this film as a child and it really stuck with me even though it has been many years since I last viewed it. I have recently been rediscovering Jack Benny through his television show and I find him to be a master of the more subtle, character based humor that is so lacking in today's comics. I had to marvel at the one reviewer in this grouping that called Benny one of those old-fashioned comics who is unfunny. I fear that reviewer simply does not understand subtlety and therefore labels it as archaic or outdated, rather like people who are ""bored"" with shows and films that are not in color. It is sad to see a younger generation completely write off the studied, carefully crafted, measured comedy of these masters of Benny's era for the likes of Adam Sandler or Jim Carrey. And, though I also enjoy the performances of the latter, their styles are clearly broader and less subtle than Benny or many of his contemporaries and are not necessarily better because they are newer and in color. Sigh. Well, to each his own, I guess. Personally, I think this film is a treasure and I can only say that I wonder where the DVD version of this title is. Wake up you guys at Warners! This title is selling for big bucks, used and on VHS! I think there is a market out there that you might want to look at.",1110326400,40,1325,4.368421052631579

How else do we explain such inspired lunacies as a hotel elevator to heaven, angels with periodic bouts of delirium tremens (likely what the writers were suffering), or a giant coffee service hanging from the side of a skyscraper! Somehow this exotica got from storyboard to screen without the usual deadening hand of studio convention. It's pretty funny too, although the big screen is not the best venue for Jack Benny, whose personal brand of humor shows best on radio or tv. Still, the laughs are there among the general weirdness, and anyone who turns down the sound of the final scene should experience a nightmare of urban existence as frightening as any from vintage film noir, with Benny literally drowning in a sea of caffeine. This is also a chance for men to scope out that heavenly body known as Alexis Smith. Her statuesque bearing was probably a little too stiff for major stardom, but no one ever looked better in a toga or the high fashions of the day. All in all, this inventive little comedy was far ahead of its time, and despite Benny's running radio gag, possesses all the underpinnings of a minor cult classic.",1072396800,17,1222,4.741784037558685

Benny's brand of humor is hopelessly dated -- even if you have a sense of his once-omnipresent celebrity and the character he built up around it-- the pennypinching, self-aggrandizing boob, with a tin ear and a ""love"" of music -- this film still doesn't hold up that well.  The plot is kind of interesting, with Benny starring as Ethaniel, an angel of the heavenly host who has been tapped for the job of blowing Gabriel's Horn one more time, to bring doomsday down on the wicked folks on Earth.  The sets and special effects for the scenes up in Heaven are imaginative and vast, but when he gets back down to earth, the film starts to falter.  The slapstick is too drawn out and slow, and in general the humor is predictable and strained -- you see the gags coming a mile away, and still they take their sweet time passing you by.

Things get messed up and Benny finds himself Earth-bound, trying to adapt to life on the unfamiliar planet, while up in Heaven his girlfriend-angel Alexis Smith tries to find some way to resolve his predicament.  I find Benny funny in small doses, but I don't think the comedian was much of an actor or is able to sustain a character for an entire film.  The supporting cast is good, with Franklin Pangborn scoring well with his patented fussy character and great reaction shots.  The script presents some good ideas, although more could be done with the concept.  Director Raoul Walsh adds some great touches, including an amazing shot that sails over the heads of what appears to be thousands of angels in rows playing in the heavenly orchestra.  The climactic moments as Benny struggles in the 3-D billboard's coffee cup are also well shot and very creative.

432593,4,6302148677,"Well, just about since I like the heaven scenes in Guy Kibbe's office.
This movie is a way imaginative panic from beginning to end.
Lots of great one liners, tons of great character actors, the sets are great, the music is terrific. it's nearly all great.
The amusement park scene is flat out weird and the scene in the park with Bobby Blake is even more flaky. Two scenes slightly out of place in the film, but oddly perplexing enough to stand on their own as nutty.
The only insight I'll add to this film is that an older friend of mine who was alive at the time told me there was some public disenchantment with the film when it came out. WW2 had just or was just about to end and some people felt that after all everyone had been through, an irreverent manic comedy about an angel sent to destroy the earth was somewhat a bit of a betrayal of what people had suffered for. For those folks, the timing of the film was a little off. For today's audiences, the thought would be unlikely to even occur.
PS- Allyn Joslyn and John Alexander also appear together in the much requested, but never released on video, ""Junior Miss"" a 20th Century-Fox film comedy released in 1944 or 1945 which starred Peggy Ann Garner in the title role with Joslyn as her Dad and Alexander as her Dad's really loud boss.

The amount of effects shots and set-ups is amazing, yielding a truly enchanting, off-beat film.
The incredible ""Heaven's Orchestra"" shot, with the camera soaring and swooping across the eternal rows of angelic instrumentalists (accompanied by Franz Waxman's very sophisticated ""Moderne"" theme),  the miniature spinning earth that descends at a diagonal in Guy Kibee's office, the bizarre, almost surrealistic carnival scene (which probably added significantly to the film's over-all budget), the celestial elevator, the cool miniature street with moving cars(complete with headlights) over which the characters often dangle from the rooftop penthouse.....all are major elements which contribute to the film's overall cartoon-like lunacy.
And the stunt work----that's REALLY Allyn Josyln and John Alexander hanging on one another in the climatic scene, and Guy Kibee himself going over the roof backwards!
Add to this the incredible giant coffee pot, cup, spoon, etc, so cleverly introduced in the opening recording studio scene....and you have one heck of an entertaining film.  Yeah, some of the script is a bit forced and lackluster, but, overall...in light of the crud which today is dubbed ""classic""----come on!--""The Horn Blows at Midnight"" is a GEM!
I love the tried-and-true device of seeing the real-life characters in the opening all appear in the dream in various roles.  And the cast is magnificent, featuring (and wasting, in the case of Margaret Dumont) some of the best of the day.  That Allyn Joslyn is a hoot--a fine, underrated actor who excelled in comic and straight roles.  And to think that he and fellow ""fallen angel"" John Alexander had created the roles of two of the three Brewster brothers in ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" on Broadway just four years earlier (I know it's sacrilegious---but Joslynn should have been cast in the film version of ""Arsenic""--he, with his wry, slightly fey mannerisms was obviously the way the playwright envisioned the character---not the hysterical mugging of Cary Grant--so out of his element in the ""Arsenic"" film).
One more cool thing about ""Horn""---it is an amazing visual document of the mid 1940's.  The recording studio, the hotel lobby, the restaurant, the nightclub where Jack Benny unsucessfully ""sits in"" with the band --- all beautifully detailed and strikingly photographed.
