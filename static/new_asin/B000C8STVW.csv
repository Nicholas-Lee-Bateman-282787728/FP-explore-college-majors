8096455,5,B000C8STVW,"EPIC IS JUST AN UNDERSTATEMENT, THE LAST CHAPTER WILL CONCLUDE THE STORY OF KAMILLE AND CHAR. I WON'T SPOIL IT BUT THE END IS TRAGIC AND POWERFUL...I WOULD LOVE TO SEE ZZ GUNDAM DUBBED INTO ENGLISH SOON. I hope Bandai makes up their mind about not dubbing ZZ Gundam, because I would like to see the battle between Judau and Haman Khan.",1336176000,,335,4.419354838709677
8096456,5,B000C8STVW,"All I can say is WOW!!! This Is easily the grimmest and coolest endings in the Entire Gundam Universe!!!! I won't spoil any of the Details but in short if you enjoy real Gundan (Not you wanna be fans of Seed, and Wing ) You must see this!!!! Zeta Gundam Is easily the crown jewel on the crown we call Gundam, the animation is a bit dated but passable, and the story is absolutely amazing and comes to such an epic conclusion/cliffhanger, the North American Voice actors are amazing and It was Dubbed to near perfection! I would say cant wait for ZZ gundam But as it was a huge let down Its rather dissapointing to see the amazing story Of the Argama end like that.........I hope the Release the Zeta Gundam movies in the US cause They are truly the perfect ending to this Masterpiece.",1191715200,,784,4.376712328767123
8096457,5,B000C8STVW,"This DVD is amazing.  I've been a gundam fan since Gundam Wing first aired on Cartoon Network, and recently finished my collection of Zeta Gundam with this DVD.  You can try to say that the animation is old and that there's no CGI like there is in Gundam SEED or Destiny, BUT this is GOOD stuff.

What's to love? ...  Simple: the story is tightly nit, the characters are compelling and well done (even if Katz lends himself to annoyance here and there), and the action is not the type that flashes up for a minute and is then forgotten.  I think that the most interesting part of watching it is seeing the elements of the story that inspired later villans and weapons in other gundam series.

It's also a nice buy because you get 10 EPISODES per DVD, at a standard DVD price (which is the same you pay for about 3-5 episodes for a typical Anime show).  Whether you're a Gundam addict or just an Anime fan, Zeta Gundam is a piece your collection is not complete without.  You won't regret it.",1141862400,6,991,4.3478260869565215
