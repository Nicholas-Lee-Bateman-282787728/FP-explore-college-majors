1636312,5,B00005NQGR,This is an excellent DVD.  If you have never done Yoga before (which I hadn't when I bought this DVD) this is the one to start with.  The instructor (Sara Ivanhoe) has a helper that does modified poses for beginners and after a few weeks you will be flexible enough to move to the deeper twists and bends.  I really recommend this workout.  I don't mind doing this everynight when I get home from work and it also helps relax away the stress of my day.,1011571200,12,452,4.22093023255814
1636313,5,B00005NQGR,"This is an excellent yoga set.  Sara Ivanhoe is very likeable and has a soothing voice.  The music is beautiful.  Both workouts in this set will make you sweat.  It is great for beginners, but by no means is it slow or boring.  The Fat Burning yoga section moves quickly and you're never hanging out in one pose for too long, so time passes quickly!
I was sceptical before I purchased this set, due to the fact that most yoga videos I have seen are boring and don't seem like much of a workout.  I have experienced serious toning in my legs, as well as an amazing sense of well-being since I've been doing this yoga set.",1008374400,32,620,4.256410256410256
1636314,5,B00005NQGR,"Crunch has put together two yoga workouts that work well for beginners and beyond.  Both are taught by Sarah Ivanhoe, a calming yet energetic (for yoga) instructor.  These are non-mystical yoga tapes, which is nice if you haven't done yoga before.  No meditation or cosmic anything.  She teaches a group class, and some modifications are shown by class members.
The Joy of Yoga is a well planned workout that is a great intro to yoga, or a nice cooldown after a longer cardio or weight workout.  It is relaxing and energizing, so you can do it any time of day.
Fat Burning Yoga is tougher, more like a high beginner workout.  It is not so tough that one should be wiped afterwards, but one will definitely feel worked out.  The pace moves, but not too quickly.  I don't know how much Fat-burning this really accomplishes, but it will definitly burn some calories, and work out kinks at the same time.
The DVD interface is well planned, and it is very easy to go through each ot the two programs as written.  They are also broken into chapters, so mixing between the two is possible, as it putting together a long yoga workout.",1006905600,166,1126,4.534653465346534

I like this did. The instructor is great & points out that everyone has their own pace.",1453852800,,256,3.849056603773585

1636326,5,B00005NQGR,I had both these on tape before and was happy to buy a single DVD to replace them.  I use them both as go to work outs - I find that the fat burning one challenges you differently.  If you really want to do more traditional yoga and want variety for your yoga videos also purchase the Elements of Yoga set by Tara Lee.,1448841600,,318,3.953125

1636331,3,B00005NQGR,I like the video as my wife used to use it. We had it on VHS but wanted it on DVD so I ordered it twice and got the wrong product twice. The products bar code label was correct but the label was placed on the wrong DVD. I am not very happy that I had to turn to ebay to order it. I hope I get the right one this time.,1430438400,,317,3.4166666666666665

1636347,3,B00005NQGR,"Not exactly what I expected.  I expected from Crunch"" simething challenging and fun. It seemed a little dated (note the yogawear remind me of Jane Fonda era), but that was not my main objection. I guess I thought a practice for ""fat-burning"" that I should expect to sweat a little. No sweat, no elevated heart rate, no muscle fatigue just a nice little practice for everyday. I have tried several Sara Ivanhoe practices and I just don't get the fuss over her. I find her light and fluffy and a little too chatty for my personal tastes in yoga, but if that is what you are into, this will suite you fine. When ordering, I thought this would be a ""go-to"" dvd, but now I just keep it around for some variety and when I just need something less challenging.",1414281600,,753,4.378571428571429

1636352,5,B00005NQGR,"I love Sara Ivanhoe!! Her yoga workouts are awesome! And there is no judgement if you are not exactly flexible. I have very tight hamstrings from running and have to bend my knees to touch the floor and that is OK!! The fat burning is a little long for a beginner, but you can make it through. I promise. Try these. You will love them!",1399593600,,335,4.1692307692307695
1636353,5,B00005NQGR,Both  yoga workouts are really good. Sara Ivanhoe really knows what she is doing. You will love these 2 workouts. 2 diffrent kinds of yoga. But you will feel really good after doing any of them.,1397260800,,194,4.388888888888889
1636354,5,B00005NQGR,"This is my favorite yoga video ever- i have a huge collection. This one i've bought at least 4 times because everytime someone asks me about a good yoga vid- i get really excited and give them this video and tell them to try it.
Both workouts are great- the joy of yoga really is an accurate description- it's a joy to do. I didn't think i was up for much of a challenge with the fat burning yoga routine when i just watched it the first time- but then it was time to do it- and it's a great routine you can feel.  Both are short enough to be doable and fit into a schedule but long enought o feel like it was worth it. I would recommned this video for beginners and more intermediate- it's very versatile.",1394668800,2,706,4.079136690647482

1636358,4,B00005NQGR,I was looking for a short yoga type workout as i am just beggining yoga.  These are perfect- simple moves- easy flow and short enough I am not killing myself to get through them.  Perfect for someone interested in trying yoga or beginners.,1391990400,,239,4.534883720930233
1636359,4,B00005NQGR,Sara is easy to watch as she guides you through a more of an introductory (through intermediate) yoga workout. Her workouts are easy to follow.,1390176000,,143,4.76
1636360,5,B00005NQGR,I had never done yoga before I purchased this dvd. She does a really good job explaining how to do the different poses and there's someone you can watch to do the modified version of each pose. I even got my kids doing this when it's too cold to go outside.,1389225600,,257,4.0588235294117645
1636361,4,B00005NQGR,"Been doing yoga for 5 years, and really enjoy Sara Ivanhoe DVDs. Great explainations and low impact alternatives. Highly recommend this DVD",1386979200,,139,5.363636363636363
1636362,5,B00005NQGR,"I love this video so much that when my first one cracked, I quickly ordered a new one.  I have purchased several of Sara's dvd's and enjoy each one.  She explains movements clearly and encourages users to work at their own pace and ability.",1386979200,,240,4.431818181818182
1636363,5,B00005NQGR,"Best yoga video ever and since I am a yoga teacher, I should know.  Two yoga workouts: one is cardio or fat burning ""power flow"" while the other is slow and educational similar to the Iyengar method.  Plus an ab floor workout.  Yes I lost weight by doing the fat burning video.  Good for beginners and advanced students.  If you are new, watch the slow yoga video to learn proper alignment,  then move to the fat burning yoga.  Just do the first ten minutes of the routine and then fast forward to the cool down stretch.  Eventually you can work your way up to the whole 45 minutes of fat burning yoga.",1385164800,2,602,4.3125
1636364,4,B00005NQGR,"When I was in college, I was first introduced to yoga by a friend (she had a Rodney Yee video).  ""Fat Burning Yoga"" was the first yoga video that I ever purchased.  I immediately fell in love with Sarah Ivanhoe and her down to earth, easy to follow instructions.  For the past ten years, I have continue with the practice of yoga.  Recently, I repurchased this DVD (I had the VHS tape) and I have to admit, I still enjoy this video from time to time.  If you are a beginner, this is a great way to start.  If you are intermediate or have had some experience with yoga, this is a good refresher and for me, a good way to truly think about proper poses and technique as well as my breath.  Throughout the years, I have bought other Sara videos and she never disappoints.",1384041600,,768,4.219178082191781

1636367,5,B00005NQGR,Already have Sara Ivanhoe 20 minute daily yoga and wanted something more. This fits the bill and provides a yoga option for the weekends.,1379203200,,137,4.75
1636368,4,B00005NQGR,"I bought this DVD to replace my VHS tape of the same.  Sara Ivanhoe is such an inspiring yoga coach.  Gentle, but thorough.  The advanced yoga is still too much for me.  But I follow the beginners and it keeps my moving even with arthritis in my knees.",1378425600,,252,4.1875
1636369,4,B00005NQGR,"Good workouts, but Sara kinda annoys me (but most of the people on these workout videos do). I would continue to buy her yoga workouts though. I usually do the video a few times so I know what to do and then do the workout muted while listening to music.",1372550400,,254,4.1

1636371,4,B00005NQGR,I like this fat burning yoga segment better than the other. It really does get you sweating. I feel like the other segment is too similar and wished it was more focused on the poses and stretches. Still a good dvd,1368144000,,213,4.219512195121951
1636372,5,B00005NQGR,This is very good for people who are not familiar with Yoga.  The excerise really works.  I use this to stretch my body before sleep and it is perfect.  It really help my body relax for the morning workouts.  The Fat Burning Yoga is great to use and really breaks a sweat.,1366588800,,272,4.173076923076923
1636373,5,B00005NQGR,"The first Sara Ivanhoe yoga routine I did was on TV, called Zen Twist.  Because I have lower back issues (who doesn't?!) and Zen Twist made my lower back feel wonderful, I searched for a Sara DVD.  This is a good DVD.  The routines are can be challenging but doable for any level in my opinion.  What I most appreciate about Sara's teaching method is she is very good about telling you when to inhale and when to exhale.  Since breath is such an important aspect of yoga, I appreciate not having to guess.  She keeps a very good running commentary about the routine so when you are doing this with a DVD, you don't have to continously look at the TV.  You can actually just listen and follow along.  I'll be getting more of Sara's DVDs.",1366329600,2,736,4.321167883211679

It's pretty great!!!",1361836800,,307,3.7384615384615385
1636377,4,B00005NQGR,Very good yoga DVD.  Both workouts are good and I got a pretty good workout from both of them.  It's perfect if you are a beginner and just want to see if yoga is up your alley.  I would buy if you are interested in buying a yoga DVD and are not sure if it is for you.,1360022400,,268,3.586206896551724
1636378,5,B00005NQGR,"Sara Ivanhoe is my absolute favorite yoga instructor and this is her best DVD.  Sara has a great yoga style that doesn't feel hokey but remains true to the practice. There are two completely separate workouts on this DVD, each offering something a little different. The first workout is a very relaxing but robust hatha flow routine-virtually anyone could do it. The second is a little more challenging but not in the put-your-leg-over-your-shoulder-and-balance-on-one-hand sort of way. I would call it a beginner vinyasa flow routine.",1359849600,,535,5.294117647058823

1636380,4,B00005NQGR,This dvd has 2 options in regards to the yoga workout. It's very helpful especially when I need to relax or workout but not to the extreme. Very pleased with this dvd!,1358899200,,167,4.25

I enjoyed the last workout better as I was able to learn more moves and found it to be more effective. Everything is too slow in this DVD, from the movements to the way the instructor speaks, it just doesn't work for me.",1356912000,,337,3.898550724637681
1636383,4,B00005NQGR,"I have used this DVD for about 5 years now. It is a nice yoga flow sequence with some burn. At the end of the exercises I feel like I have done a work out. She does get annoying after 5 years... so I did buy a few other DVDs to change it up, but I always go back to this workout.

The fat burning yoga one is the one I generally do as there is more muscle type work involved. The other set is slower and good for a more medatative/breathing yoga.

I am a 23 year old female, in relatively good shape but a beginner in exercising.",1354060800,,529,3.8440366972477062

I feel like every muscle was stretched and I feel so great. Sarah Ivanhoe is an excellent instructor she makes it fun and has a great attitude that come through and makes you not feel pressured to be perfect. Highly recommend both workouts on this DVD.",1346284800,,408,4.1125
1636385,4,B00005NQGR,"I hope my review can help you! I will tell you my experience incorporating this yoga DVD in my workout regiment. Yoga is GREAT!

This DVD is very good. Two workouts in one. The yoga crunch is short and effective. It moves quick and Sara does a good job of explaining the moves. Don't get discouraged if you are struggling with a pose....just keep breathing. I wish I can show my body of before and after the the use of this yoga DVD. The ab workout is intense! The effectiveness of the workout isn't in getting the poses right but trying to get them right...going as far as you can and breathing. Trust me...if you are a man like me who is used to lifting weights and doing the standard manly workouts you will think that yoga is ineffective and is for women. I was wrong! Yoga is more challenging than any weight resistance training that I have ever done.

Start of by doing the Joy of Yoga section first before you do the fat burning one

I'm a fit guy. I used to lift weights, jog, and do many floor exercises that are similar to yoga but at that time I did NOT know I was incorporating  yoga techniques without the breathing.  For the most part my body was fit. 6'1 and a half weighing 210 lbs of muscle. So prior to using yoga I was pretty much already a fit guy.

I was introduced to yoga by my wife in June. She was introduced to it by a co-worker to help her with her back pains and thyroid issues. The first DVD of yoga that I tried was fat free yoga with Ravi Singh & Ana Brett. The first week of that DVD was hell!! For a fit guy I struggled. Right then and there I knew yoga could be for me.

During that week of using the Fat Free Yoga my wife and I decided to get other yoga DVD's. The next DVD we ordered through Amazon was The Perfect Yoga Workout ""Crunch"" by with Sara. Two workouts in one DVD. After week one of Fat Free Yoga with Ravi and Ana, we decided to use the Crunch DVD. My wife and I did the fat burning workout on the ""Crunch"" DVD. During that week my wife ordered two more yoga DVD's..one by Rodney Yee and Bryan Kest.

For 6 weeks straight I have alternated workouts week to week to trick my body into seeing maximum results. I use the DVD's Monday thru Saturday and use Sunday as a resting day. Like I said before, I was already a fit guy and my body has changed. I look leaner, more chiseled, and more flexible. Occasionally I still jog and lift on my day off from yoga but all in all yoga has done more for me than any other workout I have done.

You can't go wrong with these yoga DVD's Fat Free Yoga with Ravi and Ana, ""Crunch"" The Perfect Yoga Workout, Rodney Yee's Total body workout, and Bryan Kest's Power Yoga. Yoga is effective when you continually switch up your workouts. Trick the body and never forget to breath.",1344643200,,2757,4.147940074906367
1636386,5,B00005NQGR,I am a beginner in the yoga world and both of these work outs are great. I had never done yoga before this video and I am completely in love now. The Joy of Yoga is a nice slow paced workout with simple poses. Fat Burning is more intense...a lot more in my opinion and I normally just stick to the first video.,1342656000,,310,3.9365079365079363
1636387,4,B00005NQGR,"I purchased this dvd a couple years ago and it's a great workout for yoga beginners. The poses may seem easy but don't be fooled! After a couple seconds of holding these poses, you start to sweat! That's a good thing though because it means it's working. The poses are very do-able but in the same breath they challenge your body--you WILL feel it afterwards--in a good way! It's also perfectly narrated to follow along easily. On the days I don't feel like doing a strenuous workout, I bust this dvd out. You obviously won't burn as much fat doing this as you would doing--say, P90--but it's better than not doing anything at all! It's an awesome yoga workout for your whole body and you are SO relaxed by the time the dvd is done. Give it a try. Namaste!",1341273600,3,756,4.4071428571428575

1636391,5,B00005NQGR,"I have been doing Sara Ivanhoe's fat burning yoga workout off and on for the past 8 years. I recently ordered this because my VHS version broke:( I enjoy Sara as a video instructor because she uses a nice, soft relaxing voice and is not annoying as with many other video instructors. I find that I enjoy all the Crunch instructors in that way. Her workout includes poses that can be adapted for beginners all the way up to more advanced yoga practicers which makes this workout one that will continue to be challenging for as long as you'd like to use it. There was a time, back in my college years, that I was more religious about doing the workout everyday. In those days, I was able to see such a result! I noticed lean muscles and a real improvement in my balance, not to mention I felt great and really energized. Instructors frequently say, ""this should feel good"" which I always thought was a load of crap because...hello, I am exercising here! I can honestly say, however, that when I did this everyday and really knew what I was doing, it did feel great and I actually looked forward to my workout!

Highly recommended! If at first it seems hard and you notice yourself falling over, keep at it as you will notice that you get the hang of it after awhile and trust me, the results are worth it:)",1326585600,2,1304,4.3884297520661155

It moves at a good pace and really makes you feel limber after doing it.  I like the many twists, which loosen up my back and neck where I seem to hold tension.  There are two different workouts on the DVD and both are really great.  In fact, I just purchased my second copy since I used the first one so much the DVD seems to have worn out!  I find that some other yoga DVDs are more about relaxation but this one really is more of a workout.  It doesn't replace more vigorous exercise, but it keeps you feeling great!

She has a nice soothing voice but she doesn't come across corny or irritating like so many other yoga DVDs I have previewed.  I have bought other DVDs with Ivanhoe, and they were good too, but this is the best.  I reccomend buying two of these, because you won't want to be without one when you lend one to your friends.  I also recommend getting her Candlelight Yoga DVD as well for the more relaxing and soothing yoga experience.",1321056000,,604,4.348214285714286

It is definitely an intermediate level workout, but there are easy to follow modifications for beginners.  My favorite portion of the yoga practice is the lunge and twisting series.  It is a solid 45 minute workout, and I really wish it was 60 minutes, because it always goes by too quickly!
It also included the Joy of Yoga workout, which I have done a couple times but it is the reason I give this 4 stars not 5.  It's not as challenging, but it is good for days when I just want to stretch out my body.",1314921600,,621,4.024390243902439

I still consider myself a beginner because I don't practice yoga daily, but this is definitely a workout combo I turn to when I want to tone up.  I have always been a person who would get into workout phases and then quit, but I've been pretty much turning into an athletic person over the past year (10 years ago, it was a lot easier to not work out and get away with it ;)  ). About 2 years ago my VHS version broke so I bought the DVD version. I use this DVD now probably once or twice a month for a little variety (I keep trying to memorize it so I can just do the workouts on my own without a television!). I think both workouts are great - slow, easy to follow, and give you opportunities for more challenging poses - but Fat Burning Yoga is WONDERFUL. You definitely get a nice workout and feel the burn. Sara Ivanhoe is great!",1311638400,,945,4.048128342245989
1636397,4,B00005NQGR,"I'm torn on this video, it was good at times, but then again, it had way too many downward dog pose positions! Geez, there's so many other poses to do besides downward dog pose! I'm a beginner and at times, I was lost in positions because I couldn't see the screen because it was too much facing downward positioning!
I do like the instructor and modifications of positions being an alternative. Also, did anyone notice that both workouts are 90% similar? I didn't see much difference in them at all!

update 06/28/2011 I decided to increase the rating on this review after doing the routines a few more times. I was wrong the workouts are different. I'd recommend for beginners!

My balance in everyday life has greatly improved and my core feels stronger.  I had never done yoga when I first tried this program and thought that I would have trouble with it, but the instructor, Sara Ivanhoe, shows alternate moves for everything so you never lag behind or feel inadequate.",1307923200,,512,4.862068965517241

My favorite is def the Fat Burning part - older but Not cheezy. Great workout. Fun, strengthening, and works the whole body. I love the twisting and standing poses. A beginner could do most of it, and the stronger can concentrate and get a deep workout from this. No inversions.

Joy of Yoga is not quite as good, but it's also a great stretch/workout and it's there for a change of pace.",1305072000,,530,4.3

1636403,5,B00005NQGR,I have used the Joy of Yoga as a guide to my weekly Yoga routine for 12 years. Sara Ivanhoe leads the way in a routine that's just right--not too demanding but hard enough to let you know that you got a great workout in. I am 44 but more flexible than most people I know my age (and younger) and recover much more quickly from physical injury than others. I defineitely reccommend this DVD!,1290297600,,390,4.213333333333333
1636404,4,B00005NQGR,"Both Crunch -""Joy of Yoga"" and -""Fat Burning yoga"" are great beginner yoga videos. They are paced slow enough to keep up, and provide useful stretching poses.

1636405,5,B00005NQGR,"I recently got into yoga.. I needed some sort of guidance rather than try to teach myself from pages in a book.  Sara does an awesome job keeping a calm tone to really focus on relaxation and breathing through each pose.  By the end of my first workout, I thought, ""Ah.. That was lovely."" -- And my body felt great.

This definitely serves as a stress reducer during my last year of nursing school.. I don't think I'd be able to survive the rest of the program without it! :o)

I definitely recommend it to beginners (I'm not advanced obviously, so I don't know how it would fare with expert yogis).

Whether this burns a decent amount of calories or not, it makes me more aware of my body, so at least I am making more conscious decisions about what and how much I eat.

The workout and stretching are great and leave you feeling good. My daughters and daughter-in-law liked mine so well that I bought this one for them to share so I could have mine back!",1279152000,,355,4.393939393939394
1636407,5,B00005NQGR,"I have been doing this workout for about 8 years now (wow- didn't even realize!) and it's still my go-to option for a workout that's less strenuous but still effective.

I disagree with the reviews here that have said that there's no way it's fat-burning, especially since a lot of them are claimed to have been written by experienced yoga practitioners.  Anyone who does yoga knows that part of it's appeal is that the fat-burning effects come from the effort put forth in sustaining poses, this is why you break a sweat with a very limited range of motion.  Additionally, it builds muscle, which increases metabolic rates and thus burns more calories while resting.  So saying it doesn't help to burn fat is simply not true.

Sarah's instruction is really great.  She knows what she's talking about and is motivating without shoving it in your face (no 'Come on, you can do it!'s).  She's also not pseudo-Zen like some other instructors, but doesn't take the relaxation and the 'yoga' out of it, either.  I started this DVD with no prior knowledge of yoga whatsoever, but she is very careful to make sure to instruct you on the proper form.  Even after doing it for so long, I still really appreciate her guidance as a reminder of where I should be, because it keeps me focused and my form in check.  Also, she does this as she's doing the moves, so you're never standing around listening to an explanation. To me, it's more like having a real instructor.  I also still find it challenging even as my flexibility has progressed.  So it's comprehensible for the beginner, but still physically engaging for the practiced.

I have exercise-induced asthma, so a lot of the more cardiovascularly focused sports and workouts are not an option for me, but this workout combined with long bike rides and healthy eating has morphed me into the best shape of my life.

That being said, I will agree that there are some drawbacks to the DVD.  For one, Sarah's instruction and motivation can get really old after a while (she definitely has some dorky eye-roll moments), but I feel like that can be the case with any workout DVD watched regularly.  Think you could watch the same movie 3 times a week without getting sick of it?  Also, the music is really bad.  New-agey, hokey, and bland.  BUT, this is counteracted by the fact that in the audio options on the main menu you can choose to mute just the music. So you can put on your own tunes and still listen to the instructor (I actually just discovered this today, and I am stoked).

All in all, it's a great DVD and a great workout.  I am so glad I found it and got in on a whim instead of some other yoga DVD, because I've tried to add other ones to my routine and have absolutely hated the style of them.  I would definitely recommend it this anyone and everyone!",1276128000,3,2810,4.533730158730159

1636409,4,B00005NQGR,"First of all, this is not a rigorous workout, its gentle enough for beginners, but interesting enough for intermediate practitioners. I have done this video a zillion times, and seems to hold my attention every time.

Can I also say that I absolutely adore the instructor Sarah Ivanhoe. She is clear and unpretentious, and provides lots of verbal instruction on how to adjust your form to get the most out of the stretch. Also, she does all the positions in mirror format so that when you look at the video its easy to adjust yourself accordingly, and mirroring is no easy task. I give Sarah 5 stars!

In short, if you are looking to sweat profusely, this is not the video for you. However, if you are looking for a good, flowing routine, with plenty of adjustments, and thorough instruction, then this is a video you will continue to enjoy.",1263081600,2,841,4.6

I've been practicing for almost 3 years now, and both of these workouts are still perfect for me on those days when I'm looking for something a bit lighter but still want to feel energized and invigorated (I just skip past the intros via the chapter menu and get right into the practice).

Sara's verbal cues are excellent, everything she tells you is useful, and she always leaves enough room to allow you to discover your own individual interpretation and expression of the poses. She has a real gift for being able to talk a lot, yet keep you calm and focused and not distract you in the process. While her style may not be everyone's cup of tea, there's definitely something that sets her apart from your average yoga instructor. If you're new to the practice, you'll figure that out eventually.

1636435,5,B00005NQGR,A perfect DVD for someone looking to add variation to home yoga routines.  These two routines are both challenging and enjoyable; both are demonstrated by a full class with varying ability levels represented.

Anyone who wants to see what yoga is all about (a beginner) should definately get this video, well worth the money. The Fat-Burning part gets your heart rate up and leaves you feeling warm yet energized. The Joy of Yoga is a light workout, good as an addition to a cardio session. Both workouts leave you feeling utterly relaxed, I go through the rest of my day totally relaxed after doing these. One warning though...there is quite alot of downward dog (which I like) but I know some of you do not. Overall a fabulous workout.",1177632000,3,591,4.481481481481482

I suspect if one was just beginning that the poses would not be clear and it would be necessary to do some outside research on how to do them properly.

Having written that, if you have some basic knowledge then the DVD's are great. There are levels to work up to and Sara is a good leader. There's also an extra ab work out. I'm going to buy more Crunch DVD's. It's fun.",1174780800,5,506,4.06

1636443,5,B00005NQGR,"Sara Ivanhoe has a fresh radiant energy and a comforting teaching style. She believes that if it isn't fun, you won't do it. Her energy is like orange zest for the soul. You can safely relax into her workouts and let her instruction take you to relaxation. The Fat Burning workout on this DVD is especially enjoyable.

The setting is a gym with wooden floors and lavender mats. All the traditional Yoga moves are here: Downward Dog, Chair and Warrior. What makes them more enjoyable is how Sara Ivanhoe arranges the poses so they flow together in a beautiful sequence.

If you are intermediate and are looking for a way to burn more calories during your Yoga sessions, then the Fat Burning segment may impress you. Normally I walk, bike or dance before doing yoga, but with this session, you may want to save your energy and just head straight into the practice. I can also highly recommend the Crunch Candlelight Yoga DVD and all of the 20-minute Yoga Makeover DVDs.

Fat burning yoga has you learning a bunch of poses and then she puts them together for a sequence. She works your arms and legs and then has a section at the end for abs. It feels like a complete workout to me. The joy of yoga seems a little easier to me so I don't usually do that one, but it's still a great workout too.

1636451,5,B00005NQGR,"I have already done individual reviews of the two practices contained in this DVD but I wanted to give an overview of the combined practices found on this excellent DVD.

 By way of background, I have been practicing Yoga daily for over 9 years, with a large library of yoga VHS/DVD/CD (around 100). I also have been studying for many years with an excellent Yoga teacher, but that's only once a week so the heart of my Yoga practice is at home w/ my collection of Various Yoga media.

 This DVD contains two practices, led by Yoga teacher Sara Ivanhoe, and is an excellent pair of routines. The first, ""Joy of Yoga"" is more basic, a good introduction to Yoga. The second,""Fat Burning Yoga"" has more of a Vinyasa flow style to it (more of a ""Power Yoga"" feel). It is a challenging but doable program that is around 40 or so minutes long.

 I feel that Sara particularly shines as a teacher in the second (""Fat Burning"") program, but of course that may just be personal preference because I tend to like those more challenging, flowing types of practice which really build heat in the body.

 I want to say a bit more about the ""Fat Burning"" program.

 The routine is extremely well put together. The poses build gradually starting with simpler movements that warm you up and gently take you into the more challenging versions of the poses from one series to the next.

 She has a student who demonstrates modifications which is always quite important for a program like this where you may have a person who has never done yoga before or who may have physical limitations.

 This is a very thorough routine which leads you through a wide range of motion and also incorporates a really wonderful flow.

 My only miniscule complaint would be that I prefer a longer guided relaxation before the final seated pose, but of course one can always just shut off the program to extend their relaxation and then put it back on to finish it off in sitting. This in and of itself wasn't a big deal because there is still at least some semblence of relaxation (which is treated gratuitously in many programs).

 Highly recommended!

Thank you Sara for doing a great job explaining everything, but I just was chronically ""trying to catch up"" with the workout because I knew practically nothing about yoga.  Luckily I didn't give up, and after about 15 times waching each of the 2 workouts, I could go through them without a problem.  Hence why I gave it 4 stars

As fantastic as Sara is with instruction, I do urge the real early beginners not to purchase this DVD just yet.  Wait until you become a little more familiar with yoga.",1139702400,4,542,4.336633663366337
1636453,3,B00005NQGR,"I bought this dvd on recommendation of a yogilates class teacher, and was a little disappointed.  I have been doing yoga for several years now, and found this dvd to be too simple.  The triangle/warrior positions didn't flow very well, and the instructor's insistence on pronouncing the word forward as ""foward"" drove me crazy.

Even though this dvd was simple, the twisting poses were rather difficult for me.  This is probably because I hadn't done many before, so it is a good introduction to those.  I did this with a friend once, and he kept falling down, and really had a tough time with it, probably because he hadn't done yoga before and is very inflexible.

It is nice to have two options for a workout on one dvd- really takes advantage of the extra space afforded by a dvd over a vhs workout.",1135987200,,803,4.541666666666667

1636457,3,B00005NQGR,"Dr. Beth wrote a great review.
Sara Ivanhoe is very friendly, but a bit stiff. Many times she'll say how hard everything is which is meant to be sympathetic, but comes off reminding me how much I'm working to lose weight instead of enjoying how good the poses feel themselves. She never stops talking which can be ok if to remind you to breathe or keep your back straight, but she talks off-topic atimes & too quick & stiff which keeps you from concentrating on your body.
The background music can't be heard unless you listen for it which should be there to help you to relax. The colorful industral background was too gym lookiing.
The workout was challenging & had some great twists, but it did not flow. This workout is more of a stiff slow aerobics then yoga. She does teach well, remembers most cues & details to make sure you do it right, doing each pose slowly at first to build it to a series which she repeats 2-4x. The poses were the basic sun salutations, forward bends, chair pose, downward dog, side angle, warrior 1 & 2, triangle pose, table, bow, locust, wide legged sretch, as well as some deep twisting poses.

A past reviewer remarked she was new & it showed... During the side angle or triangle pose she said to use the hand at the floor as an anchor to keep you in the pose... Isn't the correct way to use your abdominal & leg muscles to hold you & just have lower arm as a slight balance, nothing more since the point is to extend the arms as much as possible?
If you like the straight-foward do the pose & done, this is the DVD for you. If you like ones that are more relaxed with music being able to be heard to keep your breathing in tune, & the teacher being serene, try Rodney Yee, Rainbeau Mars, Wai Lana & others.

1636458,5,B00005NQGR,"The ""Fat Burning Yoga"" portion of this DVD is my favorite because I am one of those ""on-again-off-again"" exercizers and this yoga routine is always challenging enough to make me feel like I'm getting a workout and good stretch but easy enough to help be get back ""on-again.""  I always start back with this one because it's enjoyable and un-intimidating and gets me back in shape to go on to my more challenging yoga routines.  In fact, I even bought it twice!  I used to have it on video and had to buy it again when our VCR went obsolete and we became a DVD only household.  Even when I am sticking with regular exercize, I still go back to this one on days when I'm not at my best.  By the way, I think Sarah Ivanhoe does a great job of explaining proper form and giving enough timely cues so that you don't have to watch the screen after doing the routine just a few times.",1126137600,6,876,4.221556886227545

The Joy of Yoga:
The mellower of the two, with a lot of great stretches and muscle workouts.  If you've tried the Crunch Candlelight Yoga, this is a bit more active then that.  As a beginner I could easily follow and was able to make it through the entire routine and felt great afterwards.

Fat Burning Yoga:
The name says it; this is a bit more intense of a workout.  She includes a few ""routines"" so that you're continually moving and working your muscles at the same time to help burn calories while toning your muscles.  As a beginner this one was a bit more of a challenge, but I loved actually feeling my muscles working (contracting) without killing myself.

Sarah is a great instructor; she's extremely soothing and explains everything along the way in both workouts.  There is a person to show modifications in both workouts and Sarah constantly reminds you to do whatever you're most comfortable with as yoga is not about being too strenuous on your body.

I highly recommend this set of DVD's; you can't beat the two for one deal on a great set of workouts.  I can't believe I'm actually uttering the words that I look forward to exercising again with these!",1115164800,13,1332,4.535564853556485
1636477,5,B00005NQGR,"This DVD features 2 yoga workouts, The Joy of Yoga and Fat Burning Yoga both led by Sara Ivanhoe. She is a friendly, non intimidating, relaxed yoga instructor who's style I really like.

Joy of Yoga is from 1997, Sara is with 7 fellow exercisers one who show beginner modifications and another one in the back who is quite flexible. You warm up with forward bends, side stretches and swan dives all while breathing in and out through your nose.  Sara always makes sure to emphasize the importance of breathing.  Then Sara will lead you through some standing poses, you will see lots of downward facing dogs in this routine, also high and low lunges, side stretch poses, and warriors with some added twists.  After that you will move to the floor where you will do some back bends and cobras, then move into downward facing dog again this time with legs in a wider stance where you will incorporate spinal twists. Then you finish on the floor with back extensions, pushups, forwards bends, seated twists and final relaxation pose.

Fat Burning Yoga is a more recent video of Sara's and a little more intense.  She has 7 exercisers with her again, one showing beginner modifications. You will see a lot of the same poses, lots of downward facing dogs again, high and low lunges, twisting lunges, warrior, side stretch pose and some backbends including the cobra and bow pose. You will also see some planks, the chair pose and triangle pose. Sara will then lead you through a flowing series including some of these poses. Following that is an ab section where you will see the boat pose, 4-legged table pose and reverse planks, then you move into a few minutes of more pilates style ab work done at a slower pace. Then you will do some forward bend poses to stretch out before going on to the final relaxation pose.

These are better suited for beginner/intermediate yoga people, if you are a complete beginner something else like Basic Yoga for Dummies which also features Sara may be a better choice. Sara does a decent job in both videos, she is pleasant, encouraging and seems to be enjoying herself. She is also featured in Candlelight Yoga which is another excellent video. If you like yoga, but aren't into the more traditional mystical yoga but a more relaxed style, these would be perfect for your collection.",1113091200,3,2315,4.687192118226601

1636483,4,B00005NQGR,"The philosophy of all videos in the Crunch line is to make working out accessible to all people, regardless of size or experience. Their yoga videos are no exception, as they take a non-mystical approach and are taught in a very straightforward manner by instructor Sara Ivanhoe. Ivanhoe's down-to-earth style (she frequently uses words like ""scooch"") is completely non-intimidating; she comes across as a friendly workout buddy.

Joy of Yoga begins with a focused breathing series involving forward bends and down dogs (there are many repetitions of this position) and then moves on to additional standing poses, including warrior, lunges, and twists. The floor portion of the workout consists mostly of relaxing stretches, but there is one tough segment which alternates arm/leg stretches with yogi pushups.  This practice is about 35 minutes long.  Fat-burning yoga is a more active practice, although not quite to the level of aerobic conditioning or power yoga.  Again, the practice begins with breathing and then introduces the use of vinyasas:  several poses are combined together in a flowing sequence and then the entire sequence is repeated several times.  After a brief warm-up, there is a long, sun salutation-type vinyasa containing lunges, push-up pose, simple backbends, and many repetitions of downward dog. For each repetition, a slightly more difficult variation is introduced, and by the end of this series, your arms and shoulders have gotten an intense workout.  Additional vinyasas include twisting lunges, proud warrior, triangle, and side angle pose.  This practice ends with a short abs section containing a few boat poses, seated backbends, and two Pilates-like exercises. Finally, there are some brief seated stretches and an even briefer relaxation pose for about 45 total minutes.

Ivanhoe's cues are detailed enough for those new to yoga, and both practices are probably doable by most beginners, especially with the modifications provided.  However, for complete yoga novices, I think that some prior familiarity with basic yoga postures would be beneficial.  Also, it is important to keep in mind that both of these practices contain some fairly intense moves which demand some pre-existing fitness capacity; Fat-Burning Yoga in particular is a more strenuous practice that will challenge even intermediate yogis.  Finally, Ivanhoe's strong emphasis on breathing is a plus for all levels of yoga practitioners, and those who like her friendly, no-nonsense style are likely to enjoy these videos.",1093824000,166,2527,5.434782608695652

Best of all, the stress is draining out of my body- my shoulders are finally moving away from my ears, I'm walking taller and feel great!  Sara's a great instructor and these are fun and challenging.  I was already used to yoga, so I have no trouble doing the workouts- but they are still challenging enough to make them worthwhile.",1081900800,5,550,4.649484536082475

The instructor is great at relaying the poses, and then puts them into challening series. The first time I used this video, I couldn't finish it.

Fat Burning Yoga starts off slowly but after a few minutes you'll begin to sweat.  I like advanced yoga workouts and this one was great!  I do wish that she'd use the names of the poses though.
The Joy of Yoga takes you through some standing, stretching and seated poses.  It basically gives you an intro to yoga.  The instructor, Sara Ivanhoe, is great!  She keeps you motivated and her personality is fresh.  Highly recommended",1076371200,3,531,4.526315789473684

No no, I'm not metrosexual, but I am getting older and no longer do avid workouts like I used to when I was in high school and college.  But I've been interested in yoga and had a few ""student instructors"" at schools that I've gone to.  None of them have are as good as Sara.  I have to admit that I first started with her Yoga for Dummies double-disc set first before I got this DVD.  I really enjoyed the Dummies DVDs because she explains (for a dummy like me) the major poses.  I also got the MTV Yoga DVDs and find them to be a bit weird for my taste.  Of course, I'm a beginner, but even I know that MTV is just trying to carve into Sara's niche (that's the niche of having the best yoga videos around).  Anyway, I really enjoy this DVD and Sara is thorough in her instructions of both how to perform the poses and how the poses should feel (for proper technique).

The modified version is clearly filmed as well so you can do the dvd according to your own level. I'm not sure if a person will lose excess fat with this dvd though.. don't you need high intensity cardio? But otherwise, it's a great workout. I feel more flexible, my muscles feel harder and stronger, my posture has improved, and it's a mood enhancer.  The 1st workout, ""The Joy of Yoga"" is good too but it's shorter and not much of a workout! Enjoy. And it's a BARGAIN! ONE studio yoga class can be about $15!",1072483200,12,674,4.524590163934426

1636509,5,B00005NQGR,"Here you get two great yoga workout programs for the price of one!!  Both yoga programs are taught by the same instructor, Sara Ivanhoe, a motivating friendly face.  She is a great instructor beginnning both programs by focusing on your breathing.  Breathing is key in yoga!!!!  In both videos, there is someone who demonstrates modifications of the yoga posture.  So you can choose how to position your body depending on your flexibility and comfort--- essentially work at your pace!  Of course another appealing aspect of this video is that it is on DVD.  DVD's are fab!  You can quickly  jump around to different portions of the yoga routine--skipping certaining sections or just doing the ab workout, etc.
The ""Joy of Yoga"" is a basic program focusing on leg stretches, like lunges, that would be good for runners (or after a long workout, stepping, etc.).  Other poses included are downward dog and warrior.  This program is approximately 30 minutes so it can easily fit into your busy schedule.
The ""Fat Burning"" Yoga is a longer, slightly more advanced program.  Most of yoga poses demonstrated in this video focus on stretching the legs and back muscles (e.g. lunges, side stretches, triangle pose, downward dog, warrior pose, etc.).  At the end of the workout, Sara concludes with a six minute ab workout, stretches, and a brief relaxation meditation.  Please be advised, the title may be misleading because you are not ""burning fat"" in the traditional aerobic sense like jogging.
Moreover, I would recommend both programs, so buy this DVD and save yourself some money!

1636510,5,B00005NQGR,"First off you should know - I've got a huge crush on Sarah - the instructor, now that that's out of the way I can tell you that both of these workouts are increadable.
I've done martial arts for years - that's my base of experience and mind set - not just an exercise or self defense, but a whole mind body thing - before you even think the word ""flake"" that's not where I'm heading - this isn't one of those.
This DVD is very user friendly - the routines are the best I've done and my wife and I have bought enough Yoga VHS/DVD's to know what's out there.
The routines are hard working - i.e. you work up a sweat, but it's not overwhelming or too advanced - especially the Joy Of Yoga one - it's a fantastic workout - a little more advanced for the beginner - if you're a beginner - watch it once or twice, then you're all set.
I've been doing Yoga for a few years and this DVD is heavy on my rotation - I have not tired of it or anything like that.
We have all of Sarah's DVD's - I think there are only 3 of them - I can't say enough or really put in to words how great these are!",1053648000,8,1082,3.8783783783783785

It's not weird or eastern-religious or anything I thought it might be. There are two separate programs on here and they are both very relaxing and toning. It's not aerobic so I don't replace my cardio workout with this but try to squeeze it in, in addition to my aerobics. I can put this DVD in and do 10-80 minutes and feel like I could melt into the floor when I'm done. Add a hot oil bath or a foot massage and I'm done for the day!

I bought the DVD because of people's recommendation and the Crunch name.  I have to say it was the best twelve dollars I have spent in a long time.  In fact, I have not even wanted to go for a run since I bought the tape.  I do it every day with out problems, pain, or complaints.  The workouts are easy to follow and fun, but you can feel how hard you work.  Sara Ivanhoe did not annoy me, which is a first.  The only problem I have had is with the length of the workout.  I really wish Sara would produce an ""advanced"" tape, something with at least a 45min workout.

If you are one of those whose attention was caught by the title of this DVD ""Fat Burning Yoga"", well, let me tell you you will be disappointed in this one.  The Fat Burning workout runs a little over half an hour, which essentially makes it ineffective in burning fat.  This is not to say that it's not a good yoga workout, it's just that when you feel like you *just* got started, the routine has ended.  If you are looking for a short yoga workout which will make you sweat a little, you will be happy with this one.  It's easy but challenging enough for someone in the beginner's level and Sarah is a great instructor.  She has a soothing voice and she clearly love what she does.
The other workout routine, the Joy of Yoga, is a good introduction to yoga.  However, you may get bored of that one quickly though.",1050451200,4,883,4.289156626506024

The Joy of Yoga is pretty difficult because you have to already be flexible to do many of the positions.  Even the modified version is pretty difficult.  The woman doing the modified poses is obviously very advanced.  I suppose it could get easier with time, but it is doubtful I will ever be able to do every position.
The Fat Burning Yoga workout instructor is a little better at explaining the positions.  I was able to do 90% of the poses in this part of the DVD-- at least the modified version.  Still, the modifications are not that different from the regular workout.
I would say this tape is more for seasoned stretchers-- You have to be pretty darn flexible to get the maximum workout from this tape.

I may be physically fit in many respects, but when it comes to yoga, I am an uncoordinated klutz.  However, with practice and this DVD, I just might master the art yet.  This is nicely presented, well explained, and easy to follow...and I do recommend it for those like me, who are just starting out.

I am never bored during this CRUNCH DVD.  While the workouts could be a little more difficult, I feel great after completing them.  I like staying in poses longer, so after doing Jennifer Kriess' DVDs for 6 months, I appreciated the time dedicated to the poses in these workouts.

The drawbacks are that it is not the best one for beginners, or for people that are pretty heavy set - some of the moves are difficult if you cannot support your body weight easily. Also, it is more ""Americanized"" yoga than  authentic yoga - it is more like a class at a gym with little to no focus on breathing or actual hatha yoga sequences.

Also, the instructor never stopped talking, which I found extremely distracting and annoying. I think this would be a better workout for novices, who need instruction on form and more time to get into the feel of a pose. I will try to find someone to give this DVD to; all I can say is that at least I only blew [a little cash] on this one.
I far prefer my Power Yoga: The Complete Workout with Rodney Yee (flowing poses with minimal yakking)--although it is definitely for someone who is already familiar with basic yoga poses.",1018224000,12,617,4.421052631578948

1636535,4,B00005NQGR,"CRUNCH Total Yoga takes a pretty straightforward approach to yoga, and it seems aimed at an audience who is fairly comfortable working out, and is curious to see what this whole yoga craze is about. There's no chanting, or mystics on top of mountaintops, or any of that--and that can be reassuring to those just starting up with yoga.
This is a beginning yoga video, although I think it's aimed at an audience that's already fairly physically fit. There are some poses which may be difficult for someone who is not particularly strong yet. Yet, I am about intermediate level, and while I don't find this as challenging as videos aimed at intermediate students, I find I get a workout that feels like I've ""done something"". At about 40 minutes each segment (the Fat Burning Yoga is longer), it's easier to fit into a busy schedule than a 60- or 90- minute workout.
One of the small pet peeves of this DVD is the instructor in the ""Fat Burning Yoga"" sequence...she's always saying, ""OK?"" in the sort of way some people do and are only half-aware they're doing. I find this verbal twitch annoying, although to be fair I can only imagine how nervous SHE must have been taping an exercise video.

This is a common gripe of mine, I find the tape/DVD workouts should be much longer.  The fat burning yoga workout was longer but the pace was too slow for someone who knows what they are doing.  For example, there are about 3 sun salutations, that she walks through every step of the way, which is way slower than I am used to.  For beginners though, I think the instruction is good, I like the way they describe proper form - I think the instruction is better than other videos I have.  I always warn against doing a tape before learning correct form, but these instructors are pretty good at form, which makes me sad there aren't more advanced workouts to work up to.
For beginners bump this up to 4 stars, for intermediate yogis this is just a 3.  BTW, I still think starting out with a real yoga instructor is the best way, then supplement with the tapes/DVDs - you will get so much more out of it.",1012176000,98,1053,4.178217821782178

There is also one person doing modified movements for beginners or inflexibility which is perfect for me. Both routines have a nice gentle flow so I never fall behind or feel intimidated. Sara Ivanhoe is a wonderful instructor that emphasizes proper breathing technique as well as the form of the movements themselves. She is also very encouraging throughout to not give up and to keep practicing, ""yoga is not a competition"".
I tried yoga several years ago with a different instructor and I did not enjoy it at all. Instead I felt discouraged and woefully out of shape.
