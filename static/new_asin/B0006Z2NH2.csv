8043992,4,B0006Z2NH2,"This is great situational humor, however unless you can speak Afrikaans, you would not understand it. I have enjoyed it immensely",1357257600,,129,5.190476190476191
8043993,2,B0006Z2NH2,"Not the original screened in South Africa in the 1970s-80s. This one has been dubbed with fake voice-overs to make it understandable to international audiences. Not the original (funnier) local South African accents. Some of the original footage from the first movie missing (e.g. guys struggling to get furniture through altered controls on automatic bank doors). Sound quality is rather poor, possibly due to transition from screen (film) to video/ DVD.",1284854400,2,455,5.422535211267606
8043994,5,B0006Z2NH2,"This takes me back to my childhood in South Africa. Hilarious, in a very 70's sort of way. You probably need to have an affiliation to South Africa to ""get"" some of the gags.",1250553600,,174,4.147058823529412
8043995,2,B0006Z2NH2,"I remembered I watch FUNNY PEOPLE on TV in the 80's, which at that time considered quite funny! Of course, with programs like American Funniest Home Video, Just For Laugh, and of the course, the Candidate Camera, this movie is considered quite lame by today standard, though some of the jokes still work!

But this version released by Televista is not FUNNY PEOPLE, but the 1983 FUNNY PEOPLE II (listed at the end credit!). I realized that when Director Jamie Uys mentioned about the last movie in the opening speech. Video quality is poor with dirt and spots all over the place and color is wash off! Shimmering line could be seen at the bottom of the screen suggest that it probably source from VHS material. It is presented in full screen and super flat mono soundtrack. No Region coding.

Well, still hope they will release the original 1977 FUNNY PEOPLE on DVD someday!",1227225600,4,874,4.6688311688311686
8043996,3,B0006Z2NH2,"I had no idea what this film was about. All I knew was that it was from Jamie Uys and I liked his other works. I ordered it.

I won't say it was awful but it wasn't great either. It turned out to be a compendium of scenes from a South African show called FUNNY PEOPLE. It seems that is the South African analog of CANDID CAMERA. The gags are similar in style and the results are as well. If you liked CANDID CAMERA, you might well like this. If you aren't a fan, then you had best steer clear.

There are a few funny bits but you have to sit through a lot to get to them. Its hardly worth the effort.

Something else that should be noted is that this dates back to the 70's. The styles are from that era and the quality of the videography is evocative of that time as well.",1122508800,13,773,3.9423076923076925
