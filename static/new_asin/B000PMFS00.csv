2825440,5,B000PMFS00,Was looking for Valley Girl and got The Sure Thing as an added bonus!! Like totally awesome for our family! LOL!!,1358467200,,113,4.428571428571429
2825441,5,B000PMFS00,"....we like a kick start, remembering how we were, and where, either the places in movies, or where we were, who we were, when they came out. These two do just that, with a vengeance. In my opinion, best Nick Cage performance, too, in Valley Girl. As for The Sure Thing- c'mon; early Cusack!  Awesome!",1358035200,,301,4.472727272727273
2825442,3,B000PMFS00,"I live in Australia and I purchased some Blu Ray's and some DVD's.  The service is very good, I received the goods quickly, however when I played the disks, I found that the Blu Ray's worked, however the DVD's did not.  The DVD's (Valley Girl and The Sure Thing) did not work because they did not have the region 4 code which was disappointing when delivery was to Australia.

How can I arrange for the DVD's to be replaced by region 4 DVD's?",1355443200,,442,4.301204819277109
2825443,5,B000PMFS00,"Ordered double feature dvd pack. love these movies, and glad I ordered. they are on two separate dvds, which is what I was hoping, not two on one dvd. arrived on time, good packaging, quality dvds. very happy all around",1331596800,3,219,4.5
2825444,5,B000PMFS00,"I like that there are two movies in this group.  I bought this, originally, for Valley Girl because I like the soundtrack.",1277078400,,122,4.545454545454546
2825445,5,B000PMFS00,"I bought this double feature and love them, especially Valley Girl.  This was the first time I ever saw The Sure Thing.  I saw Valley Girl many years ago when it first showed at the theaters.  I think its a classic 80's movie like The Breakfast Club or other movies from that era.  Nicholas Cage was just getting his career started about that time and it seemed to help him quite a bit.  The Sure Thing is more of a sexy babe type movie that would be good for college kids.  I did enjoy it and thought that it was a good fit to go with Valley Girl.  My wife and I both enjoy these movies and yes I would recommend this double feature for any video library.  It brought back a lot of memories. Valley Girl is one that I will always look forward to watching.  Thanks",1269216000,,764,4.108108108108108

2825447,5,B000PMFS00,"First off, who dosen't love a double feature!!  The 80's had the best young actors.  Movies like these will always stand the test of time.",1234310400,,138,4.48
2825448,5,B000PMFS00,God I have missed these movies.  Can't find Valley girl anywhere else so it sure was nice to see it again.  Have some old friends over..drink some wine and remember when you were young.,1203292800,10,185,4.411764705882353
2825449,4,B000PMFS00,"I bought this awhile back when a certain retail store(let's call them 'ircuit ity') had this double feature on a special sale for $6!  I bought it mainly for The Sure Thing, but Valley Girl isn't bad either.  For me to go into the plotlines, ""opposites attract"" themes, or point out the 80's vibe of both films would be insulting to those reading this.  Besides, the reviews for the individual films are plentiful and more helpful than what i could possibly write.

I'll just comment on the dvd itself.  Each film is on a separate 2-sided disc.  Widescreen versions for both, though fullscreen options are available(side two of Valley Girl for sure, can't remember if fullscreen is included for The Sure Thing as i'm a widescreen-person all the way).  Each film has a commentary track by its director(Reiner and Coolidge respectively) and an in-movie text commentary of sorts by way of pop-ups as bonus features.  This is the 'trivia track' extra listed on the back(honestly, i thought this would be a trivia game about the 80's or about the movies).  Also, it doesn't list it on the back of the box, but The Sure Thing has a fairly extensive making of featurettes on side two(including participation by most of the main talent in the original film).  Not sure why this is not emphasized on the back as an extra as well, as it would've been a selling point to me along time ago.  I'm just glad it was included, a nice bonus surprise nonetheless.  Also, there's a few mini-extras all featuring the Sure Thing herself.",1189036800,20,1516,4.679245283018868
2825460,3,B000PMFS00,"If you're getting a decent price for your two-for-one deal, it's not such a bad way to go. Neither of these movies are what one would call earth-shattering, must-see. magical cinema, but ""Totally Awesome '80s"" is all about fun, right?  I bought this double feature for ""Valley Girl."" This little romp was no less silly than I remembered it, but since that was what it was all about, I enjoyed every minute of it.  The 2nd movie, ""The Sure Thing"" is a movie that even John Cusak couldn't make interesting.  I've always been a John Cusak fan and trust me, it's not one of his best... Four stars for Valley Girl/Two for The Sure Thing - rounds out to a fair three!",1398643200,,661,4.401639344262295
2825461,5,B000PMFS00,Perfect combo and best price by far! Thought would be hard to find bit amazon made this easy and fast!,1398297600,,102,4.15
2825462,5,B000PMFS00,"These movies are both great to watch and brand new as described, however,  like w/any other movie or show, i encourage you to purchase it on blu ray disc if available. It wasn't for me but i really wanted to own these movies(valley girl in particular) so i got it on regular dvd. All in all, its worth having!",1398124800,,309,4.237288135593221
2825463,5,B000PMFS00,"I'm overtly excited that I was able to find this double feature!  Two, under rated, and yet awesome movies coming together in one bang!  Can't be more pleased with my buy.",1387065600,,171,4.483870967741935
2825464,5,B000PMFS00,"These are among my favorite rainy day/sick day/want-to-feel-better film options, especially ""Valley Girl"". Nic Cage and Deborah Foreman were perfect for these roles.",1379548800,,165,6.217391304347826
2825465,5,B000PMFS00,"Two very underrated movies.  I really ordered for Valley Girl, but The Sure Thing was pretty funny too. Enjoy them!",1363478400,,115,4.75
2825466,5,B000PMFS00,"The quality of the video is up to DVD standards.  I haven't looked at ""Valley Girl"" yet, but ""The Sure Thing"" is in the group of 3 or 4 romantic comedies that rank as my alltime favorites.  John Cusak and Daphne Zuniga have great chemistry.",1362009600,,240,4.311111111111111
2825467,5,B000PMFS00,I love Valley Girl an mostly every teen love story from the 80s it good and it came with sure thing which is pretty good too!! the really good thing is it didn't take too long to get to me and was affordable!!!,1361318400,,210,3.9069767441860463
2825468,4,B000PMFS00,"Loved The Sure Thing a lot of fun but with good character development and very likeable Cusack, Valley Girl is a bit of light hearted fluff. One of the few I have enjoyed with Nicholas Cage apart from Moonstruck. A couple of teen romances with The Sure Thing a stand out due to it's leads and Rob Reiners direction. Great value for money, and will be watched fairly regularly.",1360454400,,376,4.463768115942029
2825469,5,B000PMFS00,The Sure Thing is so underrated -- and probably the best John Cusack movie. So many stars and great direction by Rob Reiner. I'm always shocked when people say they've never seen it. It's a must! Valley Girl is just good 80s fun featuring a very young Nick Cage. Both have excellent soundtracks too!,1359504000,2,299,4.555555555555555

8192429,5,B000PMFS00,"Like, nostalgia, dude!  Aaaah, the 80's.  Fashion and flashin' encapsulated in two movies that expose the less John Hughes-y part of that decade.  Like, awesome.",1439251200,,161,5.36
8192430,5,B000PMFS00,"This double feature of 80's films is an excellent choice pricewise, as well as viewer quality wise! I absolutely loved both of these 80's flashback films. The Sure Thing(1985) is my favorite of the two. It stars John Cusack, Daphne Zuniga, Viveca Lindfors, and Nicolette Sheridan. It was directed by Rob Reiner. A friend recommended this film to me some 30 years ago, and luckily for me, I finally followed his advice and screened it just yesterday. Better late than Never, as they say. It is a very warm-hearted romantic comedy delight! Two college freshmen, who, initially don't care much for one another, find themselves on a cross-country journey from the East to the West coast, both for different reasons. They share a series of misadventures while experiencing their trek. Gradually, they discover that they share more than just a cross-country adventure, as they find themselves eventually falling in love with one another. There are many parallels between this film with the 1934 Best Picture Oscar Winner, ""It Happened One Night"", starring Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert, and directed by Frank Capra. This is especially true during their hitch-hiking scenes. John Cusack is excellent as Walter ""Gib"" Gibson, and Daphne Zuniga is very good as Allison. The film is very well directed by Rob Reiner. Other notable players include Viveca Lindfors as their college English instructor, and Anthony Edwards as Gib's best friend who convinces him to go cross-country to meet a beautiful blonde, played by Nicolette Sheridan, who is supposedly, The Sure Thing! Although somewhat predictable, the film has a very warm-hearted feel to it that only adds to the fine acting, writing, and directing. Valley Girl(1983), stars Nicolas Cage and Deborah Forman, and is directed by Martha Coolidge. Before you start to roll your eyes about Cage and his current acting style, he is just perfect in this film as a Hollywood Punker, while Forman plays a San Fernando Valley Girl. Even though the two are from entirely different backgrounds, they find themselves growing closer together as they fall in love. Again, somewhat predictable, but the acting, writing, and direction, amp up this film's plot to a higher level. Here again, as in The Sure Thing, one can find the stories origins in a past story, which, in this case, would be Romeo And Juliet, due to their wide discrepancy in backgrounds. In addition, Valley Girl features a truly excellent soundtrack of 80's delights. The actual vinyl release used to be quite the collector's treasure back in the 80's and 90's. The recording artists included The Plimsouls, Josie Cotton, The Psychedelic Furs, Men At Work, Modern English, and The Jam, among others. Another benefit to this package is that the set comes with 2 dvd's, which greatly enhances the quality of the film transfer to dvd, which is excellent! The Sure Thing comes in Widescreen, while Valley Girl can be viewed in either Widescreen, as well as Full Frame. I thoroughly enjoyed both of these fine 80's flashbacks! MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
