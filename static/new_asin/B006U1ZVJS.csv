I read about it in Jack Sargeant's book on the Cinema of Transgression, Deathtripping, and from the way he praised Cirsium Delectus' filmmaker, Richard Baylor, I thought it would be a great film. Cirsium does not deliver on the sex and gore like a Richard Kern film, nor does it contain the wild plotting and philosophy of a Nick Zedd film. The industrial soundtrack by Whiteslug is pretty much the only redeeming factor of this incredibly boring ""transgressive"" film. If you're looking for ultra underground fare similar to Kern and Zedd, skip Baylor and pick up one of Charles Pinion's films.",1337558400,,653,4.787610619469026
