5776278,5,B00D7AM4WC,Another excellent film. It's too bad we don't get to see these in theatres here in the U.S.Catherine Deneuve looks terrific.,1378684800,2,124,4.9523809523809526
8590263,5,B00D7AM4WC,"OK...we are Asterix fans.  Been to Parc Asterix many times, own all of the original movies from the sixties, and even have a relative who wrote the original movie scores in the sixties.  So, we were fairly suspect of a live version...this has its faults but it is fun, respectful of the original material, and a pretty good adaptation.  It gets 5 stars because it is impossible to make a good live version of anything from the cartoon world.  I nice, frivolous movie that holds your attention and entertains you.",1506038400,,512,4.655555555555556

8590268,1,B00D7AM4WC,I could not view the movie. Could not get the disc to play. :( Not sure what the problem is. I think it might be for the wrong region.,1420588800,,134,3.6551724137931036

it......",1416700800,,105,3.772727272727273
8590270,4,B00D7AM4WC,"I found a preview of this movie on youtube and it piqued my interest but then when i read the terrible reviews here I almost decided against ordering. In the end I'm glad I gave myself a chance to watch the movie for myself. Perhaps it was because my expectations were so low, but I was pleasantly surprised to find it quite enjoyable with its own zany energy and quirkiness.
I think with film adaptations you can never expect them to be faithful to the original, or even to capture the same spirit, or you will almost always be sorely disappointed - even though of course there are exceptions to the rule, But then those are usually great movies, not just enjoyable ones. Three and a half stars for me - the extra half star for the french subtitles  :)",1394841600,3,753,4.378571428571429
8590271,1,B00D7AM4WC,"The PROS:
Subtitles in French AND English.
Gerard Depardieu can still play Obelix as he should be.
Idefix (Dogmatix) is still adorable. Too bad he's in the movie for  what... less than 5 minutes (one scene).
The actor playing Goudurix plays him quite well. The Goudurix in the book was also an annoying little s***. 8-)

The CONS:
Gerard Depardieu can still play Obelix and it doesn't save this movie.
They only used Idefix in one scene.
They're going to ENGLAND... not SCOTLAND. (Lands sakes! loose the tartan and wear tweed!)
Catherine Deneuve's Queen of England is disappointing. She must have been paid a LOT of money to be convinced to play the role.
The humor is flat... if you can call that humor.
And Asterix (this is the 3rd actor playing him) is... lacking. He is boorish. The Asterix in the books was ALWAYS a gentleman. The Asterix in this movie trying to ""pick up"" girls was just too painful to watch.

I was so hoping to enjoy this movie. I think I am just going to pop the Asterix et Cleopatre (live action) and take this nasty taste out of my mouth. Or better yet... the original Asterix and Cleopatre and sing along with the ""Pudding a l'arsenic!""

Goscinny and Uderzo... I am so sorry for what this generation has done to your wonderful books.",1379116800,6,1261,4.541850220264317
8590272,2,B00D7AM4WC,"C'est l'Asterix le plus minable que j'ai vu.  Un film pathtique, et une honte.  L'humour est parti, il n'est pas drle, c'est fini.  Grard Depardieu, aussi bon acteur qu'il est, ne peut sauver cette horreur.",1379116800,5,206,4.828571428571428
