5101901,5,B007OXB1GI,"If you enjoy Shakespeare, beautiful men, great acting, and interesting interpretations, of something that has been interpreted almost as many times at the bible, then watch this movie.  Someone finally went and did it. What would happen if Romeo and Juliet lived? We still don't know because the film ends right after we learn that they live, but that's okay. I truly enjoyed this film. The writing, most of it Shakespeare, is classic and flawless. The acting, surprisingly mature and moving. The cast, beautiful. The direction, while I don't enjoy the ""abrigedness"" of Shakespeare's work, I think I understand the director's choices and I applaud him for making them and think that he pulled them off.",1338681600,34,702,5.051724137931035
5101902,5,B007OXB1GI,"It was with great anticipation that I looked forward to the release of this movie. The leads were excellent, but special kudos go to Hale Appleman as Mercutio. His performance was superb. The only drawback was the camera work...a bit jerky at times. Otherwise, fantastic movie.",1338336000,,277,5.043478260869565

5101904,5,B007OXB1GI,"Like I said above, I didn't know I would like Shakespeare so much. Between this movie, and Big Gay Musical, I've discovered I Love his work. Extremely well done! Not cheesy at all. Awesome acting. Very classy. Stayed art throughout. These people are dedicated. Must purchase now. One of the few, few movies that I'll actually purchase, and look forward to seeing again.",1337904000,3,369,4.873015873015873
5101905,4,B007OXB1GI,"Brotherhood and Love....and not about the bashing....and not about the hate....and not about the struggle.  Because...I think we need more films like that....I think we need more things saying that Love is Universal....and it is beautiful, no matter what.  And I'm really proud to be a part of this project.""

((  These words are the heartfelt expressions of Matty Doyle (Glenn / Juliet), in preparing to give an encore rendition of ""You Made Me Love You"", at the following YouTube address: matt doyle you made me love you  ))

Bringing life and passion to a 400+ year old play is a gutsy, yet potentially tricky endeavor. In doing so, Director Alan Brown had a ""Nice"" idea (he's had them before).  BUT...will raw Shakespeare (let alone with a cast not-trained-in-Shakespeare) pull in everyday Gay viewers around the world?  Time and return on expenses will tell.  Though I personally hunger for the success of this film work, that ""BUT"" remains a potential killer for his efforts.

Still and all, if anything can keep this film work alive...and long remembered...it will the touching, yet sizzling Love Story given us by Seth Numrich (Sam / Romeo) and Matt Doyle (Glenn / Juliet).  They hold absolutely nothing back in both their emotional and physical lovemaking.  Their scenes together are oh-so-easy for this reviewer to replay.

BUT, now I must be honest...and say that about the basics of this Story---the basics of Shakespeare---I am ill-equipped to give you more.  Yet, there is someone....someone on this very page, whose deeply descriptive and perceptive words say it all.  And those words belong to Rachel Schweissinger, and are here in her May 19, 2012 review, entitled:  ""Outstanding, Heartbreaking, Haunting, Beautiful"".  Do yourself a favor and read, or reread, them.

PS--Thank you, Matt Doyle, for giving us a today's-rendition of ""You Made Me Love You."" It's right up there with another favorite---Harry Nilsson's 1973 CD-track of that same song&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Little-Touch-Of-Schmilsson-In-The-Night/dp/B00138J2PM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Little Touch Of Schmilsson In The Night</a>. And perhaps you'll consider another visit to ""Feinsteins"" and give us your go at R & J's true Signature Song: ""Always"" (the perfect lyrics for J. to sing to R.). Oh, and Harry needs the competition on this one, too.

5101906,5,B007OXB1GI,"I first heard about this film some months back, entirely by accident.  The more I read about it, the more curious I became about this new presentation of my favorite play.  I know that the subject might put some people off, but please don't let it.  This Private Romeo is truly ""private:"" here are two boys taking a great risk in daring to love each other in an unfriendly and often hostile environment.  Oh yeah, and they are playing out the greatest romance ever written.

Alan Brown managed to find eight of the most talented young men around and together created a masterpiece.  Some of the characters have to double up on roles, but it was so seamlessly done.  The two lovers played by Seth Numrich (Sam/Romeo) and Matt Doyle (Glenn/Juliet) were two of the finest performers I have ever seen.  Numrich is a convincing and endearing Romeo, with all the tender innocence and bewilderment, and Doyle is an outstanding Juliet, pure sweetness and strength.  They have such chemistry together that I found myself unable to stop smiling, or hold back the tears.  Hale Appleman (Josh) is a memorable Mercutio/Lord Capulet, at once terrifying, and riveting.  He seems to be on the brink of madness at times.  Sean Hudock (Gus) was a fantastic Benvolio/Lady Capulet, trying to understand his friend's decision to pursue Juliet, and then turn around and convince Juliet to marry Paris.  I could go on and on about the other players, but you need to find out for yourselves.  But trust me, this is a dream cast!

The setting in the nearly empty academy was, to me, like a blank canvas, or an empty stage.  Anything is possible.  This film is beautifully shot, from the trees on down to gentle caresses.  The language was updated at times, going from the traditional Shakespearean words to modern terms.  And that some of the boys were called ""my lady,"" or ""mother"" was not distracting at all and took nothing away from the poetry.  The soundtrack, while very simple, was exquisite and fitting.  There are some great songs in here by Bishop Allen, and, at the end, Matt Doyle treats us to his radiant voice.

The ending was something that I have not often seen before in an interpretation of R and J.  It was different, yet special.  And like the rest of the movie, IT WORKS!  I cannot wait to add this film to my collection next month.",1337385600,78,2328,4.647058823529412

I was drawn to this film because these are all first time actors (Broadway actors though)  and it is nice to see unfamiliar faces and the daunting tasks that come with such films; such as making/shooting the entire film in 13 1/2 days.

5101943,5,B007OXB1GI,"This is not actually the story of Romeo and Juliet, but is rather the story of a group of boys in a military academy and a romance between two of them, told using (mostly, but not entirely) the text of Shakespeare's play. The two lovers are NOT Romeo and Juliet; they are Sam and Glenn, who use the lines of R & J as a way of expressing their thoughts and emotions. The concept here is like that of a traditional musical or opera, in which the story is expressed through songs which aren't meant to be taken literally (that is, the characters themselves aren't really singing--the actors are singing to express the characters). Here, the actors are using the text of a Shakespeare play to tell a different story. (The ending makes it clear that it is a different story.)

The actors here are superb, and make the text come alive in a way that I've never experienced before. (And it certainly doesn't hurt that they are SO easy on the eyes!)  Rather than stuffy and/or wooden delivery in affected British accents, we get line readings that sound like actual live humans speaking to each other.  All of the actors had experience performing Shakespeare, although for some this was their first time doing so professionally.  Hale Appleman is especially good, and should have a very successful career ahead of him.

I saw this at the Reeling film festival in Chicago a few years ago, and it was my very favorite film out of the couple dozen that I saw that year.",1415145600,4,1457,4.5458015267175576

You will look at this classic bought to life in a whole different light. From it's dialogue to the two main characters carrying their love for each in the classic Shakespeare dialogue to their true feelings for each other discovered through its context,  it has taken this classic to a new level. Be sure to stay with the movie after it ends. You'll find a surprise I'm sure you'll enjoy. 5 stars for a tremendously well done film.",1412553600,3,600,4.555555555555555

5101968,3,B007OXB1GI,"Just watched Private Romeo and I gotta say I was disappointed after all the positive comments & reviews.

I understood that the story was a modern take on the Romeo & Juliet story set in a boys' military academy. For me it just didn't work.

I tried to get behind the ""gender blind"" casting, a variation on ""color blind"" casting in which the audience pretends NOT to notice a the actors race and just goes with the character as written. For me this didn't work because the characters adhered so loosely to the characters as written.

The story is all about how two factions are brought to grief when a member of each faction kills themselves after becoming a couple.

In this version, I couldn't tell the factions apart or even if there really were any. There were no parental arranged marriages, no killing of cousins in duels, and even bigger departures from the story... but that would be telling!

I'm a big fan of restaging Shakespeare in other scenarios. West Side Story and Ran are great examples where ""bending the Bard"" actually added new and interesting aspects to an already classic tale, but this one added nothing and detracted a LOT. I saw all of my favorite speeches of the play marred and made less by this staging.

Also the production values were glaringly deficient in spots. Why stage a military drill scene without bothering to ensure uniform uniforms, and with so small a number of ""cadets?"" Also the drill was nonsensical with no marching which left me considering whether the marching just looked too hokey with so few ""cadets"" or whether the boys couldn't be bothered to master some basic drill marching.

This felt much less organic throughout than that Woody Allen movie where he took an already released Japanese movie and substituted his own dialogue.

The boys were pretty and there were moments where the actors managed to get my interest & empathy DESPITE the total lack of  any help from the vehicle they were performing in.

It may well be me. There are a number of very positive reviews of this film by critics from The NY Times and The Village Voice et. al. but after seeing this I'm if some form of payola wasn't involved...",1402790400,,2161,4.663157894736842

It'd seen too many productions, including one when they said ""draw"" and they had to show a Magnum actually labelled ""broadsword"" for five seconds so the audience would get it.  Here they say ""draw"" and a punch is thrown.  I could write paragraphs, but suffice to say this is all the messages Shakespeare meant to impart in a true reenactment of the story. However reinterpreted, it is true in word and spirit.  Romeo and Juliet is the just the ""gateway"" to Shakespeare.  Get it right, and people might want more.

You are fixed on the story and the tragedy of love, death and commitment.  Takes place in a military prep school with each of only 8 cadets taking the main roles.  Despite the setting, you are transported to another time, another place and the beautiful unfolding of love between two cadets, clothed in the roles of Romeo and Juliet captures the spirit of Shakespeare's tale with the subscript of the eternal romance of love between two people.

So, with this movie linked to the greatest love story every told, (that can never seem to be done right even by big screen efforts), I thought that this would be a disaster. Well I was wrong. It was well filmed, well thought out, and to my BIG Surprise well acted. If you have not seen it yet please do not read on.
With the back drop of an all boys military school, love was found, through all the teen male posturing that can occur, (I should know I have been to one). This aside, the was filming was better then most, the rewriting kept true to the Romeo and Juliette tale, and the acting/timing was well thought out. Yes some people had to double up on roles but you could not tell, and I really did like how the film switched at times from Shakespeare to normal life when it needed to.
The things I did not like where the ending. Why not do a true end to the epic tail. I thought that this was just a cop out. The school was empty. Why not have a full school? This would have made the story even more epic and true to the screen play.

When I read the description I thought it was just going to be another silly, soft-core porn twink movie, so I turned it on for a laugh. I keep hoping to come across good gay movies although they are few and far between. This one was a nice surprise!

I love Shakespeare, but this movie did a really good job of portraying a different, creative, and interesting take on the Romeo and Juliet story.

The actors all did a wonderful job. I'm very impressed with all of them, ESPECIALLY the ones who played Romeo and Juliet. I should also mention that the guy who played Mercurio was great as well. I'm not sure why the Romeo and Juliet actors didn't get top billing, but I think they should have (although that does not imply that the other actors weren't great - they were).",1393891200,,977,4.327868852459017

I was intrigued by the gay love story interpretation, however, I would have preferred Alan Brown to have masculinized the names and the pronouns to fit the all male cast. (Juliet should have became Julio.)

Seth Numrich (Romeo) and Matt Doyle (Juliet) were excellent and very likable in their roles.  Hale Appleman is outstanding playing the part of Romeo's best bud, Mercutio. He's witty, eloquent, quick-tempered and fearlessly loyal to Romeo, but he does not really understand him.  I was so intrigued by this production and the performances, that I had to go back to Franco Zeffirelli's 1968  movie of Romeo and Juliet to refresh my memory of the story line a well as to compare the dialogue of the actors. This adaptation has a very different feel, but it is thought provoking and intriguing. I recommend it to gay lovers everywhere.  (And Matt Doyle is a cutie)",1392940800,,964,4.847560975609756

Having male cadets ""play"" the roles of Juliet, Lady Capulet, and Nurse would have been ridiculous, were it not for the commitment of the actors portraying the roles, and more importantly, the absolute dedication of the fellow actors to react and respond to the verse being spoken, rather than the actor speaking the verse.

Although this may sound shallow, what would have made this movie more fulfilling to me would have been having more attractive actors portray Romeo and Juliet. Then, the passion of the words spoken would have been matched by a sense of believability in the physical attraction.

Overall, a very clever film.",1388016000,,762,5.0396825396825395

5102007,4,B007OXB1GI,"Okay, sure, at first I started watching for what I expected would be the eye-candy factor, but very quickly was taken in by the acting, language, and ingenious storytelling. This is not a burlesque of Shakespeare, but a performance that must have taken courage for director and actors. The military school setting could have permitted their succumbing to sophomoric goofs and gaffes, but this occurs only once or twice, and then in service to the play and movie. Fortunately, there is no fake Brit Speak, either. These are American boys feeling their way into unknown territory. At times, assuming I knew what was ahead, I found myself thinking, No--don't go there, but the director and actors truly seem to respect Shakespeare's speech and cunning and that is what they respond to. They have found an engrossing way to telling their so-well-known and only slightly changed story. Of particular note is Hale Appleman's Mercutio. In my opinion, this must be one of the most difficult roles to play convincingly. The striking ambiguity of his lines can end up making him a befuddled mess or a tragic ham, but I've never seen that very same ambiguity be used to embody a convincing, endearing, and frightening character. Although they always make sense after the fact, his shifts from bravado to snark to boredom to fear to hurt are lightning quick and believable. Private Romeo is definitely a film I'll watch again.",1387756800,,1414,4.945378151260504

  However even great works have their low moments. You will obviously see how this movie follows the plot of the Shakespearian classic ""Romeo and Juliet"" to a fault. There are times when certain things that are said don't seem to line up with he action in the story. Since this movie takes place in a military academy some of the lines that are from the play don't fit in this particular setting. But such a small nuisance that doesn't really take away from the overall experience.

The movie basically starts off in a dormitory of ROTC students who are studying the shakespear novel and they are all suddenly transported to to a altered state of reality.  It was a good portrayal of shakespears work, from a homosexual point of view.  But then in the past, only men were allowed to play roles so I think it was pretty well performed.

I gave this movie a three because the only thing I hate is that it is performed as a play and dialogue always made my head hurt.  But the actors to  me are pretty hott and I just liked it for what it was worth.",1387238400,,636,4.214876033057851

I am not sure the story line would have worked as well outside a military setting. The Shakespearian ""language"" was sometimes difficult to follow due to the pace of the movie and the dialogue, and it must have been a challenge for the actors, unless they were all Shakespearian trained. Knowing the ""story line"" of Romeo and Juliet would be helpful in following the plot.

The Elizabethan script is spoken in quadruple entendre (much easier grasp by Gay men).  For those who find it a little complex - relax and watch it again.  The excellent production values, acting, and script should be viewed more like the impressionist paintings.

5102019,5,B007OXB1GI,"""Private Romeo"" uses the original text and an all-male troupe of actors, just like in Shakespeare's day, but there's no pretense that any of the guys are really girls.  The text is not changed to show that all the characters are male - the female characters are referred to as ""she"" & ""her"" just as usual. It's set in a military school (with the expected homophobia) and the actors are real-to-life. The modernizing comes in some of the musical selections that are thrown in. The big difference is that the Romeo and Juliet characters are actually attracted to each other (as males)! The main plot change is that the main characters do NOT commit suicide.

The cast do a GREAT job both playing themselves as military cadets & as the characters of ""Romeo & Juliet"". The military cadet story and the play are interspersed throughout the film in a very satisfactory way. Any scenes that would be played with brief nudity in other versions of the text (such as the 1968 version by Zeffirelli) are tastefully done with nudity only implied (but not shown). Finally the film ends with the ""Juliet""actor singing a very nice version of the song ""You Made Me Love You""!

I was thoroughly impressed with the restraint shown by the director in using a small cast with no extras, a limited number of filming sites, mostly subtle music and simplistic costumes.  Additionally, the acting was phenomenal.  Seth and Matt have more than chemistry on screen, they personify the truth that when the lovers are together the rest of the world ceases to exist.

I cite Baz Luhrmann's ""William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet"" as a great example.  The idea is there... the sense of style is there... the results suck.  I hated that film as it seemed to take one of the depthiest pieces ever written and reduce it to a skin-deep shoot-em-up with two-dimensional characters.

""Private Romeo"" takes a huge - and I mean HUGE - risk is making the romance a same-sex one.  It's a big stretch.  But by relying on a lot of Shakespeare's writing and creating a stark, blank canvas to work with, Alan Brown succeeds beautifully.

Brown, who also scripted, begins with a great set-up: nearly all of the students and faculty of the small McKinley Military Academy are off-site on training exercizes... the remaining eight students are left to hold down the fort, so to speak.  In their literature class, they are reading aloud the script of ""Romeo and Juliet"". Seamlessly, the script begins to meld into their day-to-day lives.  At first it's a bit disconcerting... but when you stop to think that Shakespeare wrote the play with people this age in mind, it begins to make sense and become natural to the world of the film.

A romance blossoms between cadets Singleton (our Romeo, played by Seth Numrich) and Mangan (Juliet, played by Matt Doyle.)  It seems that these two boys are from opposite cliques at the school, and their obvious attraction creates tension with the other cadets.  The story goes from there... the star-crossed lovers, the violent clashes between the two factions, etc.

Brown deserves a ton of credit for creating a haunting world for the film to take place in, both sterile and rich, and both plain and elegant.  He also gets kudos for assembling a group of eight really fine actors.  Often times, shoddy acting can tank a well-intentioned independent film; here, the depth and heart presented by the handsome cast helps propel and elevate the film.  My personal favorites were Hale Appleman as Neff/Mercutio and Adam Barrie as Hersh/Friar Lawrence, both of whom inject fire and mystery into their performances.

The end result here is a moving retelling of the classic that stuck with me for days after viewing.  Is it everyone's cup of tea?  Probably not.  But if you like Shakespeare and are open to new ways to view it, this film will score points with you as well.",1369180800,6,2570,4.793181818181818

5102042,2,B007OXB1GI,"This is my movie review of the Netflix streaming movie called ""Private Romeo"":

Wo Wo Romeo, why dost thou lookest so hunky yet speaketh words as strange as a citizen of Uranus? Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I do wonder if I do die an awful death whilst looking upon this lifeless chunk of celluloid sadness. In vain didst I continue to watch this senseless madness, yet yearning allst the while to search for yet another slice of streaming video art that wouldst bring me joy and contentment. Whilest I looked upon my HP monitor of eternal amusement, my head didst jerk to and fro in endless states of catatonic dysphoria and unwanted wakefulness. Bemused, I didst thinketh that perhaps I wouldst have encountered a young male thespian in a state of unabashed nakedness. Yet, I saw nary a crack that split the moon of one's supple mounds. Anon. Nor didst I find solace in the discovery of full frontal fantasies. Surely, I wouldst have found better enjoyment casting my gaze upon the frolicking fun of my friends Brian and Stewie. Be it true, yet cease to call me Shirley. True, I be not one who ist a fan of the works of Billy Shakespeare, Yet, I be one to appreciate the arts in its many forms. Now, me thinks I have spoken enough to convey the pain my heart doth shroudeth itself within after the slings and arrows that camest uponst me in my viewing. I willst now lay my soul upon a bed of cotton that hath such a lowly thread count, yet it was bought without much financial sacrifice thanks be upon the Walmartian Kingdom from whence my soft sheets of nocturnal bliss didst cometh. My final act of this cold winter of my discontent willst be to taketh one last long, slow sip from my sparkling bottle of H2O no you didn't! I beseech thee all a good night. May thee live long and prosper. May thee always remember that whenst thee encounter an unknown entity that creepeth behind thee: to runst Forrest, runst!

Then the mix of the drama from the play to the strange musical act- then back to the play...I don't know. Hate to admit I fast forwarded it a bit. If you love Romeo and Juliet, and are a big fan of Shakespeare, it will work for you. And of course with a production team from War Horse, all the cinematic beauty was there, the actors were great, and no doubt it has a huge fan base simply because of who was involved in producing it.

5102052,5,B007OXB1GI,"If you want to watch something totally unique, you're at least open to the wonder of Shakespeare's dazzling verse (at least in this well-known ""tragedy""), and you don't find the idea of two guys making out ""icky"", you should watch this amazingly clever revision  (""re-vision"") of Romeo and Juliet.  Although, because all of the actors are good looking young men for whom gender identity is decidedly beside the point, it is and has been marketed to a LGBT audience.  But unlike many of that cynical cinematic library, it's not in the least pornographic, contains no nudity or profanity, and doesn't try in any way to be the ""special interest"" movie that, alas, most will take it for. The subject of same-sex attraction is never mentioned.  It is merely *the case*, to crib Wittgenstein. And it isn't in any other discernible way exploitative.  It's just the cinematic creature of a brave and truly insightful crew the beauty of whose awesome craft includes some of the best acting and screen writing I've seen in a long while.

As ""West Side Story"" was a mid 20th century palimpsest of the same play, ""Private Romeo"" is a 21st century retake on a 16th century tragedy that almost everyone knows, or thinks they do.  Except ""Private Romeo"" adapts Shakespeare's pellucid verse to director Alan Brown's wildly imaginative vision, to transform a mundanity expected by the film's central conceit of a setting, to ""fair Verona"" and her famous feud.  It may seem, at first, a bit surreal - the exigencies of its physical/temporal setting have to stand for medieval Verona; and 8 cadets, left alone on the otherwise deserted campus (never mind why) of a military school have to distinguish themselves into Montagues and Capulets for a few days as their temporary lives become Mercutio and Benvolio, their words necessarily become the actual play, well, most of them, and Juliet's a boy, and the ending is updated, and other such trivial matters -  on second glance present less obstacles to verisimilitude than one might at first think.  In addition to being the greatest writer who ever lived, Shakespeare was a practical man, and his scaffolding is especially sturdy in Romeo & Juliet to bear such conceits.  In Shakespeare's time/place,  girls were always really played by boys in theaters. Also, this re-invention of the play has a different ending. But Romeo & Juliet is about the irrational intensity of youth and the poetry of physical passion.  And writer/director Alan Brown's industry is so repeatedly and constantly surprising, he ends up bringing it all off.

But no matter.  These fine actors stitch it altogether and one sees a familiar story, with familiar words, in a totally new and fluid way.  It is hard to overstate how good the performances are. In addition to playing dual roles as cadets, and members of the Montague and Capulet crews, some of the actors play multiple roles in the R&J story.  Hale Appleman is as fun to watch as eating pie, with his ticks and grins contrasting with his rage at his abandonment, expressed symbiotically with Shakespeare's glorious pentameter.  Moreover, Mr. Appleman's part in this film requires him to play 3 roles: the military cadet, Nef; Romeo's BFF, Mercutio; and Capulet, Juliet's father.  The scene where he, as Capulet, tells Juliet that he has arranged for her to marry someone other than Romeo, is gut wrenching. The scene where Mr. Appleman, as Mercutio, fights and is eventually ""slain"" by Tybalt, crackles with craft and a startling range of expression.  Chris Bresky, as the meddlesome nurse, is alive in two skins at once.  As Romeo & Juliet, Seth Numrich and Matt Doyle burn up the screen.  And Matt Doyle's transcendent  rendering of one of the great American songs during the end credits is worth spending an hour on the internet trying to find the mp3.  (Try youtube.)

The contrast between the emptiness of the set - montages of stills, taps and revelry, the raising of the flag twice, empty dorms and classrooms, and the organic adaptation of Shakespeare's intensity, both in the grief and in the jokes - the strangeness of its transformations - and its beautifully declaimed youthfulness, make both the play and the movie ""two as one"", in Friar Lawrence's words about those ageless star-crossed lovers.

Of course, this movie apparently never even made the theaters and it was made on a dime, but it's truly brilliant in my opinion.  The 8 actors who play in this film are mostly unknown outside of theatrical venues and thus have amazingly intelligent and well-crafted chops.  It's available on Amazon Instant Video, and may be on Netflix streaming video too.  Or you could just rent the DVD if you live in one of those far off corners of the world where one can still go to a store and rent a movie.

5102053,4,B007OXB1GI,This movie works if you know the classic story of Romeo and Juliet. The two leads were believable as star crossed lovers and I like that it was never really explained why the actors were suddenly speaking in Shakespere's prose. Only minor quibble would have been that they hired a few more actors so that they didn't have to double up on parts (for example Mercutio/Juliet's father played by same actor). I would recommend this movie.,1355097600,,434,4.723684210526316
5102054,5,B007OXB1GI,"I recognized it immediately as a film version of a stage play, ""Shakespeare's R&J"" through this version is a bit newer and the schools are different.

Some dialoge is lost in rapid fire delivery and a basic familiarity with the original text is helpful though by no means required. Like any complex work, the ""bigger picture"" tells the tale, not each word or line. If you miss a word or two, don't worry, go with the story--it works.

The acting is strong, not over wrought as us common with classical works. The players move easily between the ""live"" scenes and the Shakespearan script. At times the players can be confused as (like in Shakespeare original productions) each person plays several roles.

The play becomes evoked in the lives of the players.  Reading Romeo and Juliet in class shows us how easily the imagination takes over our so-called concept of ""reality"" and transforms the adolescent consciousness.  This film appeals to the inner adolescent's emergent sexual confusion and makes us remember our younger self's infatuations and impulsive acts.  I was surprised with how believable this version became for me.  It took me back to high school and wondering what would have happened without the strict boundaries of our rural community and its up-tight rules of conduct.

Throughout the film, it was unclear when to distinguish the difference between the military life with the Romeo-and-Juliet story line, especially due to dual roles.  Regardless of liking the film's accuracy or not, the fact of the matter is that perspective will determine the true message  with what Brown is depicting.

I liked the idea of the Shakespeare being the emotion behind the actions. That they could not express themselves and so the play's words were the avenue that expressed itself. There are flaws with the movie but it is easy to overlook because of the stellar staging and acting on the part of the cast and crew. Definitely recommend to anyone who likes Shakespeare but it is not the story of Romeo and Juliet.

5102070,5,B007OXB1GI,"There are plenty reviews out there for this title ranging from the general positive/negative reactions by competent film critics to the thoroughly in-depth literary analysis into the original work of Shakespeare in conjunction to this modern reworking.  This review will just be my two cents into how I felt about this film.  Overall, for an independent film it did not feel cheaply made at all.  The acting by the actors in this film was outstanding especially with the complicated and verbose language of the source material.  For those that start to develop headaches trying to decipher the meaning in the dialogue just lower the volume and enjoy the handsome actors reciting Shakespeare.  There is something magnetic about the way the young actors deliver their lines as cadets that sharply contrast with the world and time that Romeo and Juliet ""lived"" in.  It takes some getting used to the gender swapping and a little understanding of all the major characters in Romeo and Juliet is helpful so one can understand the rivalry and really immerse themselves into the drama. Mercutio ,as played by Hale Appleman, is at times menacing and played to perfection.  Hale delivers the Queen Mab speech in a way that allows the viewer to not get lost by the utter strangeness of it.  Matt Doyle as Juliet captures the raw giddiness of young love with an effervescent smile and with soul piercing eyes.  Seth Numrich is a capable Romeo and is a standout in his romantic scenes.  The other actors also dive into their parts with ease and great understanding.  One look into the prestigious resumes of all involved in this project clue you into why they are so adept at interpreting the lines charged to them.  This is a strong independent adaptation though it is really not or everyone.  Those that can get over the quirkiness of this updated tale will really enjoy it and those that liked it enough to purchase it will enjoy the few bonus features including commentaries included in the DVD.",1347235200,3,1987,4.84319526627219
5102071,5,B007OXB1GI,I think this was an overlooked movie by critics.  The idea of a Gay Shakespear Love Story using Romeo and Juliet is amazing.  I could actually follow the Shakespear and the story line at the same time. It is a very good video.,1345680000,2,226,4.232558139534884

5102073,3,B007OXB1GI,"As a gay man of some age, I have watched (as have many other gay people),literally thousands of heterosexual love stories.  Nothing wrong with that I suppose but I was expecting something different with Private Romeo. Something more. I think the thing that did it in for me was the use of female names and female pronouns throughout the movie as if to deny that it was a love story between two males. The acting was strong, the direction good but if the screenwriters took liberty with Shakespeare's words(and they did)....why did they then shy away from rewriting the love story as a gay love story?  Not one where there was a silly and unnecessary use of feminine names and pronouns.  I found this most distracting and most disappointing. Did I miss something? What was the purpose of holding onto the name Juliette?  Of using the term ""lady"" so often? Of referring to ""nurse"" in several dialog exchanges? Was it just some feeble attempt to mimic the original play? If so, it fell very short of that goal. The failure to update to masculine names and pronouns impaired what otherwise would have been a tender gay love story. A story with which I and others might have more fully identified.",1344902400,2,1192,4.661904761904762
5102074,5,B007OXB1GI,"Wow, what a surprise this film turned out to be. The idea of a same-sex Romeo and Juliet would seem played out by now, but these young actors and their inspired director bring an immediacy and intimacy to Shakespeare's tragedy that I have never encountered before (and believe me, I have seen many productions - inspired and not so - of Romeo and Juliet). I found myself reacting as though I knew nothing of this story and had never heard Shakespeare's familiar words before. The film is truly a small miracle.

All the actors are good, but I want to single out Hale Appleman for his charisma and potent stillness (and for making sense of the Queen Mab speech!) and Matt Doyle for his freshness, vulnerability and radiant joy as the ""Juliet"" in this military school drama.

5102076,5,B007OXB1GI,"A dream for ever and ever. To have ""Romeo and Juliet"" performed the way it was at the time of Elizabeth and the Globe Theatre, only with men and boys. But dream in the dream, let the boys be boys and not disguised boys, boys in drag, drag queens of sorts. What would happen if...?

Alan Brown has just done it. And he pushed his boyization of the play to the farthest point possible. Late teenagers in a military academy, or rather prep school, cadets who want to go to West Point all of them. Not only do the young men play all the roles but they play them with the necessary emotion and force. Romeo and Juliet who are two young men of 17 years of age really live their love as if they were in love, because they are in love, at least they are telling us with their tears, with their voices, with their bodies at all levels of nudity, though nothing frontal, that they are in love and that they spent the night before the lark sings nude in the same bed, spooning one against the other one in the other.

We are supposed to be moved by that love and by the hostility it reveals in some of these cadets, but there the film is discrete. No one dies, no one is really wounded, but the fights are real fights since cadets have some experience and training at close combat. And the atmosphere of the academy, though deserted since we only have a dozen cadets left, all the others being out on some field exercise, is reconstructed with small details here and there: the reveille, the flag going up and down, the roughness of an all male community, the showers and the washrooms, the two non-commissioned officers looking after the dozen abandoned cadets and making them march through an empty yard.

But that's not the real point. We just have to believe it is real and then the love story it tells is also real and Romeo and Juliet are really in love and they really make love on their last night.

The best part, and I am not going to tell you the final twist and the dreadful poison they use to close the show with some surreal event, is the end and Juliet rises from the dead and sings a song that is so true, so powerful, that comes from so far away, 1913, music by James V. Monaco and lyrics by Joseph McCarthy, sung by Matt Doyle who had been such a moving Juliet and is now a charming resuscitated Juliet. That's a beautiful idea that counterbalances the Renaissance beauty of the Pilgrim Sonnet with some modernity. Emotion I guess is in that union of William Shakespeare and Joseph McCarthy in an inspiring trans-gender film, or should I say trans-genre?

You made me love you
I didn't want to do it
I didn't want to do it
You made me want you
And all the time you knew it
I guess you always knew it
You made me happy sometimes
You made me glad
But there were times, baby
You made me feel so bad

You made me cry for
I didn't want to tell you
I didn't want to tell you
I want some love
That's true, yes I do
Indeed I do, you know I do
Give me, give me, give me what I cry for
You know you've got the kind of kisses
That I die for
You know you made me love you

It uses Shakespeare's text in a unique, relatable manner, and it invites its viewers to join the characters on their personal journey.  The ensemble of 8 actors is brilliant, and the men work off of each other in a powerful, and deeply meaningful way.

5102078,1,B007OXB1GI,"While I applaud the fresh and unique concept of having modern-day characters speak completely in Shakespearean prose, you have to be a real devotee of The Bard to enjoy this film; unfortunately, I'm not, so I didn't.  The acting was quite good, and the men were certainly attractive, but neither was enough to make me want to sit through more than a half-hour of this film before I removed the DVD and, quite frankly, trashed it.  I guess I was expecting a love story along the lines of Beautiful Thing, or Big Eden, or Latter Days...at least with those films, I could follow along and empathize with the characters.  Private Romeo was slow and difficult to follow, and I found it impossible to relate to any of the characters because they never seem to be developed beyond their ability to emulate the original characters of the play.  If you really love Shakespeare, buy this film; if you're not a fan, however, don't waste your time or money.",1342483200,10,945,4.640718562874252
5102079,5,B007OXB1GI,"I LOVE this movie. I loved it the first time I watched it, and I've loved it even more each of the three times I've watched it since then; it continues to astonish me.

The adaptation of Romeo and Juliet to an all-boys' military academy is very effective, and Seth Numrich (Sam/Romeo) and Matt Doyle (Glenn/Juliet) have the most electrifyingly romantic scenes I've seen in a long time - maybe ever. Hale Appleman (Josh/Mercutio) is riveting, the best actor in a very gifted cast (all of whom are young New York theatre actors who had prior experience with Shakespeare on stage).

Familiarity with Romeo and Juliet will help a lot in following the fast-moving and sometimes chaotic story, and multiple viewings are well worth the time and effort.

Many people who don't like Private Romeo just don't like Shakespeare, which is understandable in a generation raised on reality TV and crap like Avatar and the superhero/action movie that gets remade under a different title several times every year.

At the opposite end of the spectrum, serious devotees of Shakespeare may have a problem with the liberties taken, not only in the male Juliet but in the slightly changed ending; but they cannot fault the amazing spirit of this movie - Shakespeare would be writing an even more glowing review if he were here. For people who love Shakespeare but are okay with free adaptations and low budgets, this is about as good as it gets. Even intelligent straight people may like it.

The ""balcony"" scene is especially glorious, the most perfect mating of language and feeling I have ever seen; but all four or five of their love scenes are revelations. I wish I had a hundred stars to lavish on this most excellent little movie.

(People who see elements of the defunct ""don't ask - don't tell"" policy of the US military are projecting their own issues onto the movie, which contains not even the slightest hint of homophobia. The fact that both the lovers are male is in no way the cause of any conflict in Private Romeo. Somewhat as in Shakespeare, it's a rivalry between cliques in the school and has nothing whatsoever to do with the sex of the lovers.)",1342310400,3,2145,4.721925133689839
5102080,5,B007OXB1GI,"One of the enduring qualities of Shakespeare's plays is their seemingly infinite adaptability. Since it was first performed in about 1595, ""Romeo and Juliet"" has been set in many places and in many times.

Alan Brown's masterful 2012 adaptation is set in the present day in an American military academy with the ""star-crossed lovers"" being two male cadets who are, at first, reading the play in an English Literature class. The plot leaves the pages of the text and becomes a love story which dramatically affects the lives of the cadets who are left behind at the academy over what appears to be a long weekend while the other cadets and staff are on a land navigation course.

Polished performances are given by Seth Numrich, Matt Doyle and Chris Bresky but the real star is Shakespeare's timeless language, superbly handled by the entire cast and as effective in conveying the subtleties of a gay love story in 2012 as it has been in the multitude of settings directors have chosen since the late sixteenth century. Alan Brown's direction is brilliant. Watch out for his ""Five Dances"" in 2013.",1342310400,2,1096,4.824468085106383

If you enjoy `old English', beautiful young men, great script and great acting, then this movie is for you.

It's an imaginative and original retelling of on old (usually tired) classic.
One of the greatest achievements of this adaptation is the lack of jarring, which is often created when trying to force the `old' into a new vision.

(spoiler alert)
What I enjoy most about this movie is the irony of the ending.
For so many years Hollywood has only allowed gays in a plot, if they all died horribly in the end.
Then all the gay independents have been produced over the last few years, so many with the same self hating ending. Endings Shakespeare would be proud of - they may not die twice, but at least they die horribly.

It took a lot of talent to be able to pull this off. Many people have a difficult time even understanding Romeo and Juliet, let alone acting it out. It does help if you have studied Shakespeare. It's not meant for everyone as we have seen by some of the reviews. I must say that my reaction to the ending song was one of laughter. It took me by surprise and I couldn't stop laughing.

5102083,4,B007OXB1GI,"It took a few scenes to get into this but once I was, I was hooked, although this wouldn't be for everyone. I REALLY liked it and I grade the film more on my enjoyment of it. There are problems, juxtaposition between the contemporary setting and the Shakespearean play seemed sloppy sometimes. I thought the filmmaker was demonstrating a parallel between the play and the contemporary, using a class on the play that spills over into the contemporary world.
Then there are acts which exact the play in contemporary terms with Shakespearean dialogue. Some events don't tie closely enough to the play's dialogue, like, beside there being a male Juliette, the scene involving ""Juliette's"" parents insisting who (s)he marry played as odd. I needed to excuse scenes as demonstrating mere similarity, then scenes being THE play in contemporary terms, then scenes of contemporary dialogue which seem used to fill gaps between Shakespeare and the contemporary themes, then back to THE play, then a shift to mere similarity...; you see?  A couple of scenes feel a bit phoney, including the ending, which felt contrived and left me baffled. I excuse much of it. Great editing elevates scenes and probably performances, though I thought the performances were quite good with great character chemistry. Hale Appleman's Josh/Mercutio/Capulet is a strong standout and Seth Numrich's Sam/Romeo is dreamy. Overall, though small budget apparent, the artistry of the film-making and the talent involved take this film to unexpected heights. I think the filmmakers overcame tremendous obstacles in themes, location and casting (quantity not quality) to make this. I hope they come together again and make more.",1341705600,2,1691,5.239852398523985
5102084,1,B007OXB1GI,"Based on the many good reviews, I was tempted to buy this film unseen---I'm glad I didn't.  Although the level of acting was high, I found the film confusing and pointless.

The film cuts between eight or so military school students reading Romeo & Juliet in a classroom and their re-enactment of the story (modified) throughout an otherwise empty campus.  We are shown that the two male leads can kiss with convincing passion, but otherwise the ""update"" of the play was just a bunch of guys reciting Shakespeare in a novel setting.  There were almost no underlying motivations given for the present day conflicts and convictions.  Why, for example, were there two student factions other than to provide a parallel to the basic play?  If you don't know the plot of Romeo & Juliet you'd be completely lost---the play's story was clouded by the school setting and confused by the doubling of roles.

Using Shakespeare does not, in and of itself, guarantee a good film.  Oh, there were a few scenes of the hunky actors brushing their teeth and heading to the showers with towels wrapped around their waists.

The much better films ""Scotland, PA"" and ""O"" come to mind as examples of ""what could have been"" here.",1341705600,3,1207,4.764423076923077

5102086,4,B007OXB1GI,"Alan Brown (Superheroes, Book of Love, etc) has adapted a poignant capsule of Shakespeare's ROMEO AND JULIET and directs his version as a little film that is full of riches. Not only has he allowed Shakespeare's lines to be delivered intact but he has the courage to embellish their meaning by placing the story in a military academy, a move that has a lot of punch considering the recent advances in the military attitude toward gays.  Brown very successfully mixes this contemporary all male setting with bits of contemporary dialog and music and academy activity with sports etc to offer a very different look at the tale of forbidden love, has cast a highly gifted cast of New York stage actors to play all the roles, and has the courage to make this all work quite successfully. As one PR summary puts it, `When eight cadets are left behind at an isolated military high school, the greatest romantic drama ever written seeps out of the classroom and permeates their lives. Incorporating the original text of 'Romeo and Juliet,' YouTube videos, and lip-synced Indie rock music, Private Romeo takes us to a mysterious and tender place that only Shakespeare could have inspired.'

Once the setting is established, we are privy to a classroom (English literature) where the men/boys are reciting Sjakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet and from there the readers take on the roles as they move outside the classroom. The extremely talented Seth Mumrich plays Romeo and his gifted costar in Broadway's WAR HORSE Matt Doyle is Juliet. Hale Appleman is given the combined roles of Mercutio and Lord Capulet, Sean Hudock  shares both Benvolio and Lady Capulet, Adam Barrie is Friar Lawrence, Chris Bresky plays the Nurse, and the magnetic Bobby Moreno plays Tybalt.  Of course each of these characters, being military academy pre-soldiers, has a common name and Alan Brown manages to intermix the reality of these students with the Shakespearean characters deftly. The love that Seth Mumrich and Matt Doyle display is very real and touching and while there is kissing here there is no other manifestation of Shakespeare's perfect but doomed love affair: this movie is for all audiences.  After the `tomb scene' and to bring us back into reality, the very talented Matt Doyle sings `You made me love you' directly to the audience. A fine way to bring this experimental piece to an end.

Everything about this film works well - the Shakespeare excerpts are well molded to provide the essential story and are delivered expertly by the cast, the variations of the military academy theme (especially in these times) is a powerful statement, and the use of contemporary entertainment media enhances the story very well.  This is a smart, beautifully acted, well devised and delivered `update' of one of the oldest love stories in history.  Grady Harp, July 12",1341100800,14,2846,4.964285714285714

5102088,5,B007OXB1GI,"I loved this movie. The concept was great and the acting was pretty exceptional. I like Shakespeare, but I've never really been one for Romeo & Juliette. This actually changed my mind about it.

The film is set in an all-boy's military academy where they are reading Romeo & Juliette in class. A small group of boys are left on campus over the weekend and their lives begin to parallel those of their Shakespearean counterparts. Instead of rival families, it's rival groups of friends, and the fear of being caught is less what their friends will do and more that they'll be expelled from the academy, but it's a damn good adaptation, and it's kinda' surprising how easily the comparison can be made.

The acting is so well done you actually understand what they're saying (I'll admit, Shakespearean dialogue can be taxing), which is more than I can say for half the Shakespeare movies out there. The characters are believable, to the point that I stopped noticing that they referred to some of the cast as female (the original dialogue may be abridged, but it's unaltered, so while ""Juliette"" is a boy, he's still referred to as Juliette). There were a few awkward parts in there, such as a somewhat random webcam song straight off YouTube, but all-in-all, this is a pretty incredible movie.

5102090,5,B007OXB1GI,"In the Year of Grace 1692, a certain Irish poet and ""dramatist,"" one Nahum Tate, son of a Puritan clergyman, was appointed Poet Laureate of England by their Britannic Majesties King William III and Queen Mary II.  If he is remembered at all today, it is as the author of the Christmas Carol ""While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks,"" and as the librettist for the very first English opera, Henry Purcell's Dido & Aeneas.  (""Thus on the fatal banks of Nile/Weeps the deceitful Crocodile"" is what Tate has Dido deathlessly utter when Aeneas tells her he's ditching her.  Wonderful stuff!)

Alexander Pope nominated Tate one of the three High Priests of the goddess Dulness in his hilarious Dunciad (love Pope!) "". . . pensive poets painful vigils keep/Sleepless themselves to give their readers sleep.""  Wicked.  But . . . apt:  One of Tate's Great Works was a translation into English heroic couplets of a gem from the Latin original of ""Syphilis or the French Disease. . . .""

Okay.  All very amusing.  But what, pray, does it have to do with Private Romeo, an American indie film copyrighted 2012 and released just this month to DVD?

Well, because, for a time, Tate had a certain fleeting fame in London for ""improving"" Shakespeare.  He re-worked King Lear - as a musical, mind you - leaving the Fool out altogether and with, at the end, Lear and Kent bosom buddies, and Cordelia riding off into the sunset with Edgar.  He also ""fixed"" Coriolanus.  But perhaps most famously, or infamously as the case might be, he re-wrote Romeo & Juliet so that it had a happy ending!

And for these literary sins, the guy's been getting guff for over three hundred years - and never mind that such opprobrium is just a tad anachronistic:  Eng. Lit. had yet to be invented, and the reverential groveling at the feet of the Holy Bard of Stratford to which we are so accustomed lay very much in the future; even Dr. Johnson lent moderate approval to Tate's ""sensibilities.""  And why not?  Times and sensibilities do change.  And moral and cultural imperatives, as well: One rather doubts that Tate, of Puritan stock after all, would haave been delighted with a gay take on the play.

I saw a trailer for this film six months ago and though I don't usually pay all that much attention to trailers, I went immediately to try to rent this one - only to find it wasn't to be released till June 5th.  Whereupon I decided to pre-order it sight unseen.  And for no other reason than the use of all that wonderful and much beloved language in such an unexpected way.

Well.  Okay.  And the seriously gorgeous young men in it.

I shall, very likely, be sending my copy off to a friend of mine in Seattle who is, in point of fact, currently engaged in designing a new production of the play.  Because, after having watched Private Romeo at least half a dozen times now, I personally believe that every would-be producer, director, designer, or even actor of Romeo & Juliet should be made, under threat of caning, to watch this film.  And take notes!

Because it is high bloody time that people started to avail themselves of all the glorious material of Shakespeare, Marlowe, Jonson, and all those wonderful Jacobean rantings of the early 17th century, and bring it all to new and vibrant life in the way Alan Brown and his company of superb young mummers have done almost unbelievably well here.

First of all, this film is a particularly stellar example of a new and quite extraordinary phenomenon in film, which, so far, I've seen only in Indies, which do tend to ""get it"" long before the Hollywood machine:  And that is a strange and rather haunting kind of hybrid between stage play and film - usually two altogether different species of animal like horses and donkeys.  Only in recent offerings - e.g., Lilies, Just Say Love, Were the World Mine - or Private Romeo - we wind up not with sterile mules, but vigorous and potent Derby winners. And for sheer originality alone - and chutzpah - Private Romeo has to go to the top like the cream that rises in fresh milk.

A quick synopsis, although what happens is by now I should think fairly well known; it is NOT actually Romeo & Juliet, but it does track it very closely indeed:  Eight young men, students at a military school, are for utterly irrelevant reasons left alone on campus where their class work consists of reading Romeo & Juliet aloud in class - which they do with all of the hestiancy, banter, and horsing about you'd expect of a clutch of high school seniors.  But then Sam/Romeo (Seth Numrich) and Glenn/Juliet (Matt Doyle) - who are ""playing"" those parts in class - are patently taken with each other and presently Sam/Romeo has no more doubt but that he's in love with Glenn/Juliet, though Glenn has clearly recognized his own attraction to Sam long before.  And while there have already been discreet bits of Shakespeare's lines, it is as night falls and Gus/Benvolio, Josh/Mercutio and Sam/Romeo are in the hall on their way to the ball/poker game in the school mess hall that the ordinary life of teenagers opens out, so to speak, starting with Appleman's Queen Mab speech (of which more anon).  It's almost as if the intensity of these boys' feelings is such that only the language they're being saturated with in class can express those feelings, and there's no more hesitancy as in class but those boys make those Shakespearean lines their own and as natural sounding as if they were in their native language.

The script does do a more or less faithful recapitulation of Shakespeare's play though of course much modified and edited.  But, God bless the mark, Brown refused to countenance a change in pronouns:  He remains he for Romeo and she remains she for Juliet.  The other students play the other parts - Josh/Mercutio (Hale Appleman), Gus/Benvolio (Sean Hudock), Carlos/Tybalt (Bobby Moreno), with Appleman and Hudock doubling as Capulet and Lady Capulet respectively.  Omar/Juliet's nurse (Chris Bresky) is particularly noteworthy; I expect to see a lot more of him in the future.

But of course the intense relationship that quickly develops between Romeo and Juliet (Sam and Glenn) is the real stuff of the film.  And every time Sam/Romeo kisses Glenn/Juliet, this really beautiful bashful smile lights up Glenn's face.  In fact, the director says that, every time Seth kissed Matt, Matt's nose turned bright red and they had to dampen it a bit in post!  Now how neat is that!  In fact, those two have such chemistry, I would have to say their interactions are among the most riveting love scenes between two men I've ever seen:  There are other great and powerful moments between two men in other films of course:  The Boathouse Scene with James Wilby and Rupert Graves at the end of Maurice; when Scott Neal pushes Glenn Berry up against a tree in the park of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich and ""snogs the golly off him"" in Beautiful Thing; or Brendan Bradley throws caution to the wind and finally just grabs hold of Matthew Montgomery in Redwoods; or the sleepwalking scene in Back Soon between Windham Beacham and, again, Matthew Montgomery.  But to have scene after scene with Sam and Glenn making love with that testosterone-driven hunger of teenage boys is something else altogether, an intensity that perhaps could only be articulated by those glorious words.

None of the eight young men in this film had any film experience being trained stage actors (from some pretty damned prestigious drama schools, too, Julliard, Carnegie-Mellon, e.g.) and Alan Brown candidly (and repeatedly) points out he himself has no theatrical experience whatever, much less Shakespearean experience.  The result:  An unusually rich collaborative effort.

As Indies always are, this film was made on a shoestring with apparently near insurmountable obstacles about locations and such adding to the difficulties.  But necessity truly can be the mother of invention and Brown had the sense to allow these extraordinarily talented and clearly well-trained young men just to do their thing in scripted improvs, as it were, in ""rehearsals,"" all of which were followed and filmed by a hand-held camera, and many of which wound up being actually used in the final edit.  Which is probably why there is a spontaneity throughout that is amazing; the iconic moments of the play, the balcony scene, the scene where the lovers wake up after their ""wedding night"" (""'Tis the lark . . . Nay, 'Tis the nightingale""), the sly cunning of Adam/Friar Lawrence (Adam Barrie) (too often played as a captious, conniving and bumbling idiot), the battles between Tybalt, Mercutio, and Romeo - all have a terrifically engaging freshness.

And I absolutely love watching people's face when we get to the last scene of this movie with Glenn/Juliet/Matt Doyle.  But no spoilers.

Well, maybe a minor one:  In the director's commentary, Brown says the slightly mad reaction of Josh/Mercutio to Sam/Romeo's enthrallment with Glenn/Juliet is because Josh, hitherto Sam's best friend, has been effectively left behind, i.e., that it is the hurt of a best friend watching a gap widen that never existed before the advent of the new love.  I don't know, and I might be wrong here, but I've taken the impression from my very first viewing that reason Josh/Mercutio's reaction to the /Sam/Romeo-Glenn/Juliet affair is so off the wall and downright nuts is because he is himself in love with Sam/Romeo but has never put the moves on him and is kind of frantic now that it's too late.  When Sam/Romeo disappears after Omar/the Nurse drags Glenn/Juliet away from the ball/poker game, Josh/Mercutio goes after him, looking accusingly at Gus/Benvolio as if to say, why'd you let him go?  And Gus's reaction is two little, helpless, inarticulate noises of protest, before they both go after their boy.

Indeed, there is a wonderful ambiguity throughout in all the relationships of those eight young men, Gus/Benvolio and Josh/Mercutio, Adam/Friar Lawrence and Josh/Mercutio in YouTube-like videos that serve as a kind of chorus, or the almost palpable raw sexual jealousy of Carlos/Tybalt for Sam/Romeo or Glenn/Juliet I'm still not sure which it is); even the Nurse/Omar and Glenn/Juliet's relationship is more like a couple of schoolgirls giggling over some hunk they've both got a crush on than the relationship between a virginal young thing and an old bawd, the way it's usually played.

Anyway, I don't know if Appleman, a fabulous young actor, meant that to be, but it certainly seemed to me that that's what he was playing.  His babbling in the Queen Mab scene and the lead up to the balcony scene actually brought to mind the fist-to-the-chest intense physical presence of young Brando in Streetcar or Christian Bale in American Psycho.

Now, as to the language issue, which might even be called a problem:  Despite the pontificating of would be panjandrums like Ezra Pound and others of his ilk that American English has got beyond all that, I remain convinced that iambic pentameter is still the native rhythm even of American English.  And English, no matter where she is spoke, is a language of rhythmic vitality and vibrancy:  One of the ways you can almost always tell that English, however well spoken, is not someone's cradle tongue is because they might have the words, but they don't get the tune, as Mark Twain put it (albeit in a different context); they just don't get the rhythm right.

And, of course, in 400 years meanings of words have changed, other words have vanished altogether, new words undreamed of in the 16th century are today in common parlance, English still had lingering from Anglo-Saxon a familiar/singular (thee/thou/thy/thine) and a formal/plural (you/your), forms based on spoken elisions (a/an, ""the"" with a long or short ""e"" accordingly), and folks were still intimately acquainted with concepts foreign to many Americans in the 21st century:  ""Have you leave to go to shrift?"" for instance simply means ""Do you have permission to go to confession?""

I have no wish to sound elitist or arrogant but I have been a teacher of both music and English and know that taking the time to work through the strangeness and transcend the time warp can be a source of great reward.  I have actually been at performances of A Winter's Tale, A Merchant of Venice, the Scottish play and others as well as Romeo & Juliet with an audience consisting largely of American teenagers, and it amazed me then, and it still does, how quickly and completely the drama captivates them.

So:  A sweet, happy, strange (oh yeah) film, I can't recommend it highly enough, and the five stars that I'm giving it are well deserved.  I might even say that, after 320 years, in a peculiar sort of way, this film has finally vindicated poor old Nahum Tate. . . .",1340150400,48,12783,4.8262265016047685
5102091,4,B007OXB1GI,"First, the actors to the man are excellent. They speak the Bard's language smoothly with no sense of embarrasment or awkwardness. I commend Alan Brown for his nearly successful melding of a modern day all boy's military academy with the distant world of Shakespeare. The story is awkward at momments, and you can see where the plaster is still wet where he's tried to create a seamless screenplay that acknowledges the locale of the story and still pay homage to Shakespeare's story. And he was especially wise and brave not to change the pronouns of the play. Juliet and Mercutio are especially attractive and successful in their roles. Not a film for everyone; it's untidy, but it's a must-see for anyone who wants to see how adaptable and truly touching Shakespeare still can be.",1339632000,,782,4.843283582089552
5102092,5,B007OXB1GI,"This is a brilliant reinterpretation of Romeo and Juliet directed by the genius Alan Brown (who so happened have also been involved in Franco Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet).  Its wonderful to witness an ensemble of classically trained young actors of such talent breathing life to Shakespear's words with depth, maturity and making the performances so effortlessly real and accessible.  You truly care for the two lovers and at the same time fear for their inevitability.  One can note the amount of chemistry between this young cast, especially the two leads, as if they came from a seasoned repertory group.  Even for those who find difficulty with the Elizabethan dialogue can easily relate to every emotion the characters are conveying with the modern military context.  The technical and production values to this little budget film was surprisingly very good and every edited frame well thought out.  The hand-held camera work may seem 'hyper' to some, but I feel it adds to the intensity and tension of the required scenes.  But above all, the actors are all wonderful just to look at in and out of uniform.  This is a must own...must see DVD!",1339632000,,1150,4.953125
5102093,1,B007OXB1GI,"I was looking forward to watching this ""Shakespeare inspired movie with a gay twist"", but about 38 minutes into it I just couldn't take it anymore and shut it off.  All the boys were very cute and the acting was pretty good, but the iambic pentameter gave me a headache.  It just made it confusing and harder to follow.  This could have been a better movie if they had brought it fully into the 21st century with regular everyday language, instead of mucking it up with Shakespearian dialogue.  I hate it when they ruin stuff like that.  Unless you're a HUGE Shakespeare fan and love the lingo, don't waste your time or money.",1339286400,5,626,4.504424778761062
5102094,5,B007OXB1GI,"I usually never review products, but after watching this movie I felt I needed to encourage others to watch this film.  The premise is a modern day Romeo/Juliet romance at a boy's military academy.  There are 8 young men in the film, a very small cast but they all truly express the story in such a way that you don't care that it is about 95% of actual script from Shakespeare.  The actually filming of the movie really felt powerful.  Many of the scenes were filmed in low lighting which adds some power to the scenes.  There is also a slight twist at the end of the film which I was really pleased to see.

Lastly while this film in not rated, in my opinion it would receive a PG rating.  There is no nudity beyond guys without their shirts on, and there are only a few kisses between Romeo/Juliet which last perhaps 45 seconds total throughout the entire film.  It is a very tastefully well made film which I am very proud to have in my collection.  I recommend this for anyone who enjoys: gay cinema, a beautiful romance story between the two very sexy young leads, Shakespeare, or simply a very cleverly made film that draws you in and tells a wonderful story.",1339286400,11,1166,4.386046511627907
5102095,1,B007OXB1GI,I liked the premise of this movie but the Shakespear talk was just too much for me.  I love the boys in a training school premise though.  I won't comment on the acting.,1339200000,2,169,4.090909090909091
5102096,4,B007OXB1GI,"""Private Romeo,"" based on Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet,"" is a modern tale about eight cadets who are left unsupervised at an isolated military high school when the adult faculty leave on an unspecified exercise.  The cadets are instructed to carry on with their regular studies and physical fitness routines.  As the English Lit class studying ""Romeo and Juliet"" becomes engrossed in the romantic love story, the two classmates reading the leads aloud (Seth Numrich, Matt Doyle) begin to live the roles of star-crossed lovers.

There's a long tradition of movies adapting Shakespeare in assorted genres:  comedy, thriller, Western, musical, science fiction.  ""Private Romeo,"" however, might be the first to present a gay fantasy ""Romeo and Juliet.""  Writer-director Alan Brown uses a scaled-down version of the play's dramatic conflicts and embellishes the play's romantic content with modern touches like YouTube and indie rock tunes.  Instead of Verona, the school's dorm rooms, gym, corridors, and mess hall serve as the locations.

If the concept sounds shocking, it works primarily due to a cast of fine New York actors.  Controversial, definitely, but a ""Romeo and Juliet"" like you've never seen.  There are no bonus extras on this bare-bones DVD release.",1338681600,6,1264,5.370558375634518

8519978,5,B007OXB1GI,"Actors don't generally make on impact on me as long as they can deliver the line but Seth Numrich blew me away! He is mesmerizing! Simply amazing! I loved this take on the tragedy, it held me (and Seth's mind-blowing performance), till the very end.  I will admit that I shed a tear or two. Wishing for a Blu-ray edition but I'll just have to settle for a DVD.",1526515200,,360,4.217391304347826

8519980,4,B007OXB1GI,I love this movie. Its not a setting I would have initially been able to picture Shakespeare and it does get a bit forced from time to time but the film is filled with talented actors who somehow manage to pull it off. I can and do recommend watching this to anyone and everyone who expresses even the slightest interest.,1522713600,,321,4.366666666666666

8519986,5,B007OXB1GI,Whole new take on Shakespeare! Acting is excellent. The fact that the cast is all male does not take away from the tragic love story at all! The Shakespeare original language is cleverly integrated with some modern speech. The setting is a modern military academy and it just all fits together beautifully. Seth Numrich and Matt Doyle are perfectly cast and play off each other wonderfully. I loved it!!,1495238400,,403,4.855072463768116
