1918037,5,B0000CBXZN,"This is one of the best terrible movies I have ever seen.  How can you go wrong with a movie that features a scene where a giant cheerleader zord battles a giant catholic reform school girl zord with a giant dildo?  I ask you.  The dilogue is bad, the acting worse, but there are lots of gratuitous  boobs.  This is definitely a so-bad-its-great movie",1127606400,5,351,4.421875
1918038,5,B0000CBXZN,"If you don't like this movie then forget it ever existed, why bother writing a reveiw huh? This movie is awesome! Sure it's not ""American Pie"" or whatever type of crap Hollywood garbage that you're used to...but that's what's so great about it. This guy probably got a little, cheap-ass, dollar store digi-cam and made this in his basement (now...if you've seen the movie then you'll most likely be thinking of the nerdy dudes 'Enterprise bridge' closet under the stairway, kinda cardboard hideout right about now) I mean seriously and honestly what's not to like about this film? Cheerleaders?...Ninjas?...Star Trek obsessed geeky types?...Flamboyantly gay arch nemises?...Catholic school girl minions?...(Yes, there are boobies too. Lots of them!..for no apparent reason even!)

The fight scenes are ridiculously entertaining (I challenge you not to laugh outloud at them, nay, I dare you! if not for just they're low, low budget pathetic-ness) So in conclusion, ignore everybody elses reveiw before me and take my word for it that this film may well have been the best to come out of the relative movie draught of 2003 (or whenever the hell it was made)",1121990400,5,1156,5.116402116402116
1918039,1,B0000CBXZN,"The other night, I watched Cheerleader Ninjas. Now, don't think I ever considered the possibility this could be a good movie. No, I knew it would be bad, but I was hoping it would fit into the so-bad-it's-good category.
It doesn't.
Instead, it fits squarely into the it's-so-bad-it's-awful category.
Cheerleader Ninjas is a story about a flamingly-gay teacher at a Catholic reform school who wants to get revenge on a cheerleader troupe in a nearby high school. It would seem he was refused admittance to their team. So he gets a group of reformed Catholic prostitutes to beat the crap out of the cheerleaders. The cheerleaders retaliate by getting martial arts training and reluctantly join forces with the local nerds. Terrible fight scenes, gratuitous nudity, and a giant robot/dildo battle ensue.
The only thing this movie has going for it are the boobs, and that just doesn't float my boat. There are better movies out there with boobies, and it's frightening to think that Corey Haim and Corey Feldman flicks are some of these better movies.
The apparent film budget would have been just enough to rent a few of 'em, too, and maybe get a couple of six-packs, while the director was at it",1083801600,14,1193,4.824390243902439
1918040,2,B0000CBXZN,"It seems that a person is taking this movie a little too seriously. This is not a ""titanic"" or a ""lord of the rings"". Its just a really bad movie that is so bad... its good. I have to say that I was laughing my butt off at almost every scene in this flick. The acting is horrible, but that is what makes it hilarious. Lots of cliches, nudity, really bad fight scenes, bad dialog, no effects, etc makes this movie hilarious to watch. Certainly not the worst film out there (watch some troma movies) I would recommend it if you want to get some buddies together, drink a few beers, and laugh yer arse off.
Definately classic in my books. Definate.",1076976000,6,645,4.295081967213115
1918041,1,B0000CBXZN,"In the documentary ""Hearts of Darkness,"" Francis Ford Coppola said that his dream was that a fat girl in the middle of suburbia could make the greatest film of all time on a video camera. Cheerleader Ninjas is not only his, but our collective, nightmare. The amount of money spent on this ""production"" could have been devoted to charity... or a Happy Meal. Peter Jackson's early work (Dead Alive, Bad Taste) is Citizen Kane compared to this awful, awful (one more time), awful ... I don't know even know what to call this! Calling it a Film or Movie would be giving it too much credit. I am not sure if it even deserves to be called a home video. I do not want to suggest that everyone should go to film school to be able to make a movie. What I do suggest is that Auteur Kevin Campbell read a book - any book. Besides, I didn't see more than ten seconds of ACTUAL CHEERLEADER NINJAS. The positive reviews I have read on this website are appalling. The only way you could like this movie is if it were the only one you had ever seen. Kevin Campbell should not have his mom write reviews on this website for him. I have wasted so many minutes not only watching this terrible home video, but also writing this review. It is not as though I didn't ""GET IT"". This was a shlocky attempt at a shlocky B-Movie genre type film, the worst part is that it fails at even the simplist of genres'. The part about this so called brilliant farce is that I scratch my head and wonder what would possess Lions Gate films, a company that distibutes quality independant productions, to purchase the rights to this home video. Cheerleader Ninjas was so terrible that I considered it my duty to inform you, the customer. For the love of you and GOD, please avoid this movie as though your life depended on it. Watching monkeys throw ..., at ME, would be more entertaining and enjoyable than watching this thing again. On a scale from 1 to 5, I give Cheerleader Ninjas a minus 7000.",1073952000,6,1960,4.372602739726028
1918042,5,B0000CBXZN,"This movie is great, it's one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. This movie rocks, it's got nerds, cheerleaders, a naked chick, and the one kids fat brother. Go see this movie, buy it rent it, it doesn't matter just go see it. Well, 'till next time. Later.",1073088000,3,262,4.26
1918043,5,B0000CBXZN,"This movie gets 5 stars for being one of the best worst movies ever made.  It will have you in stitches with it's terrible cliches and strage sight gags.  There is lots and lots of breasts.., which just seems to make it funnier.  And the part where she kills the ""rare bear"" had me rolling.
This is the type of movie where you gather the friends around with a big bowl of popcorn which you will then proceed to snort out your nose.",1072051200,2,431,4.168674698795181

1918056,5,B0000CBXZN,"Okay, its not Casablanca, Gone with the Wind or Citizen Kane. Its not meant to be. That is why I give it five stars! I watched it because I wanted something with a few laughs, a little (not a lot) of gratuitous nudity and no thought required. That is exactly what I got!
Its not hysterically funny. Its not of high production values. If anything, someone borrowed a camera and said ""Let's make a movie."" Kira Reed (Lorsch) has a bit part that has little to do with the plot (yes there sort of is one) but you do see her naked a couple of quick times. That is never a bad thing! It also looks like she is a body double for one of the other actresses.
I don't want to give out any spoilers to the movie :) but if you also want a few laughs, a little (not a lot) of gratuitous nudity and no thought required then I say check it out!",1430438400,3,829,4.0

1918059,3,B0000CBXZN,"Its very difficult to rate this film. Parts of it made me want to scan through or stop watching all-together. Other parts hint at Family Guy influence that was absolutely hilarious! Here's what it seems to boil down to: if you are looking for tons of skin you're not  going to find much, at least not on a consistent basis, but there is some. If you're looking for a well made film, you're not going to find it here. What you will find are countless references to famous geek adopted icons of the 60's-90's -Star Trek, Star Wars, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Power Rangers, Highlander, probably more. I liked the references and most of the humor and hated the low quality production, acting, and storyline.",1390089600,,707,4.656

1918061,5,B0000CBXZN,"Great B movie with lots of T&A and more shown. Watch it while drinking for mindless entertainment. Low budget means better movies in many cases and this is no exception. No high tech special effects or well rehearsed dialogue here. Recommend as long as you are not easily offended by adult themes. Do not let the kids watch.

1918062,5,B0000CBXZN,"There's really not much to say about this movie other than it's incredibly stupid yet wildly funny at the same time. It doesn't take itself seriously, it knows it's a low-budget piece, and as a fan of film I'm more than OK with that. Extra points since I'm a nerd and the nerd-related humor really speaks to me.",1282176000,5,311,4.379310344827586

7998705,1,B0000CBXZN,"You know when something is so bad that it is good? Well this one just stopped at bad. Some films are campy on purpose others are campy by accident or circumstance; this film is neither, it needs tossing on the campy fire. No structure, no story and no social redeeming themes or scenes.

The basic story; oh there is none. The dialog is, well, deplorable. Now there is a scene of a depantylated cheerleader that looks slightly better than Kathy Bates in ""About Schmidt"" (2003) but just barely. Looks like the film revolves around this sort of thing.",1503619200,,549,4.6020408163265305
