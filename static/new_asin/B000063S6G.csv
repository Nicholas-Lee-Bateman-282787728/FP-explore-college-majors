It's got suspense, intrigue, deception, and one BIG SURPRISE at the end. The movie is completely in Spanish save for the times when ""Lucia"" is talking on the phone to the mysterious ""Mr. Gordon.""
This movie is not a fast-paced, Hollywood type of a movie, with special visual effects, and that's why I give it 3 stars.
I can't remember the name of the movie where Bruce Willis stars, and there's a little boy who sees dead people. What's the name of that movie? What I'm trying to say is that ""Plaza Vacante"" is something like that movie with Bruce Willis...nothing really is as you see it, and the ending takes you totally by surprise.
The moral to the story is, looks can be very, very, VERY deceiving.
Low key, low budget, but powerful.",1040342400,,838,4.343949044585988
