2711135,4,B000LP5CHU,"This dvd is slow, slow, slow. The teacher gets a 5-star rating for being cute as a bug, compassionate, and adorable, but the snail's pace of it doesn't qualify it as a workout. Too repetitious. It's an instructional, for sure, but not a workout. And perfect for anyone starting out (really it IS perfect for beginners or shy people!) -- but it's just to slow for the average bear.

*The ending demo where she is silent and just dances to the beat of the slow song, is what makes buying the dvd actually worth while for me!*

It's a cute, cute routine I can do with no instruction at all from her because it's so slow and easy to catch on! Lady M., if you had an entire dvd of slow demo routines like the great one you did at the end of this dvd, I'd love to buy it! I just love how I can watch you and follow you and catch on to your demo with no previous instruction! Your moves and style are self-explanitory, because you're all about sensualism, not about break-neck, fast technique! Which I must say i just love about you, and is surprisingly, difficult to find in a dvd. Doing it 'slow' takes patience, you are a joy.

More routines from you like your demo, requested!",1228176000,15,1173,4.274774774774775
2711136,2,B000LP5CHU,"To call this DVD a 'workout' is a misnomer.  It is more of an instructional video for learning a fairly short exotic-style dance routine.  If you are new to exercising you might find it a little toning, but if you are already fit or regularly work out, you won't even break a sweat, just add a few sensual moves to your repetoire.  Quite often the instructor has you turnng around and moving away from the TV; it's awfully hard to visually learn something when you have your back to it.  There were some fun elements in doing this routine, but a workout it is not.",1220832000,10,564,4.3428571428571425
2711137,3,B000LP5CHU,a little to advance for me. some dancing skill would probably make this tape a+..but i dance like a sloth..i found myself being clumsey and almost falling trying to follow the moves and i was barefoot the whole time!,1206489600,10,216,4.564102564102564
2711138,5,B000LP5CHU,"Very objective and easy to perform.
You learn  easy and sensual movements without great effort.",1204934400,,95,5.333333333333333
2711139,4,B000LP5CHU,This video gives clear easy to follow instructions and allows freedom for expression on this workout.  Nice workout that is fun and you get out what you put into it.  It is not a high impact aerobic workout.,1204070400,3,207,4.421052631578948
2711140,3,B000LP5CHU,Nice instruction but won't work up a sweat. Instructor seems a bit stiff. O.k. for what it is.,1189296000,4,94,4.277777777777778
2711141,4,B000LP5CHU,"I'm giving this DVD a 4 because it says it's a workout & I really didn't ""feel the burn"".  Its divided into thirds (standing, floorwork, and chair), with a bonus performance at the end.  No warm up or cool down, but I honestly didn't need either one.  I worked through all three back to back and didn't get the least bit sweaty.
I did feel sexy, relaxed, and generally happy with my body.  Its zero impact (unless you fall off your shoes) and the movements are surprisingly elegant.

My complaints are that Lady M narrates as though she is leading a class, not a video (you have to reverse left and right to mirror her) and that sometimes the positions you should be in make it difficult to watch her.  Neither of these are a deal breaker, though.",1182816000,59,747,4.3768115942028984
2711142,5,B000LP5CHU,"As a dancer I continue to learn and keep an open mind to all types of fusion and dances around me. I love to experiment and I am glad I did so with this dvd. Floor work, chair dance, posing, sexy and feminine alluring moves, complement any dance. The leg show segments are awesome, as most of these moves are captivating. The posing segment I found to be a great lesson, it is so simple yet makes a bold statment about the person, or dancer as she presents herself to the audience. Overall, it appears that Lady M moves effortlessly, however, I was able to feel the work out in some areas, especially during the chair dance. If you are a beginner, you may want to warm up with yoga or stretches in flexability. Lady M. presented her program beautifully, as she is. A simple chair, the right music, and this dvd, beautifully transform you as you watch in amazment at what your body can do. Hopefully, I won't mistakenly break out some of these erotic moves during a belly dance performance, ha! I loved learning from this program and I am using these moves every chance I get, hopefully not just in front of a mirror!!!",1182038400,47,1118,4.405797101449275
2711143,5,B000LP5CHU,"As a practitioner of bellydance fusion for the last few years I thought this DVD would give me a few sexy moves to add to my ever-growing dance vocabulary and it did exactly that. Lady M has a nice personality and demonstrates the moves well; she shows you how to do exotic and sexy chair moves and slinky floorwork. There is a little choreography and at the end the performance is demonstared by Lady M, showing how you might put it all together. I really enjoyed this DVD. I don't know if I'd recommend it to someone with NO dance experience, but if you've done some dance and want to learn some eye-catching exotic moves, you should check out this DVD. I would call it ""moderately challenging"".

One thing to note though, is that I felt the format of this DVD was more like an instructional dance DVD rather than a workout, but don't get me wrong you will get exercise with this DVD... I was sweating at the end!",1181433600,31,915,4.382352941176471
2711154,4,B000LP5CHU,"It was fun and easy to practice, and nothing that will make me feel uncomfortable. She broke it down in easy steps to follow.
Also, I loved the music.",1413417600,,150,4.206896551724138
2711155,5,B000LP5CHU,"It's definitely not a workout, but teaches you a nice short routine. Instructions are clear, moves are easy and cute. I enjoyed it.",1405641600,,131,4.739130434782608
2711156,2,B000LP5CHU,"You can tell this was a barely-rehearsed deal, as if she woke up and said, ""I'm going to tape a burlesque workout today!""",1401235200,,121,4.304347826086956
2711157,1,B000LP5CHU,"I would have given it zero stars but if you want to write a review you have to at least have one.
This is not good. My first clue should've been the misspelling on the video case it came in. Whoever filmed this poor stripper needs a different job. And this poor stripper is far from a good teacher.
I was looking for a  nice way to give my
hubby a treat and wasted money on junk in the process.",1400976000,,394,3.925
2711158,5,B000LP5CHU,"I have NO dance talent at all. This video is great for exercise, as well as a big confidence booster & fun! I found myself rolling my hips around house, doing chores, ect. It's just fun. Haven't told (or shown) the hubby yet what I can do, need lil more practice.
Regarding content, it shows u how to do a standing dance, a floor dance, transitioning between & a chair dance. Multiple locations. It's just fun",1400025600,,409,4.394736842105263
2711159,4,B000LP5CHU,I don't understand the comments were people say this is useless and they can dance better. If your such a great dancer why buy a DVD to learn marked for beginners? Anyways the standing section is sort of a lot of walking swishing the hips and turns. The floor work is sexy and fun the chair section is fun as well. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because she doesn't mirror the moves and doesn't switch between sides. So it's not really a workout as much as dance instruction. But if your beginning to learn exotic dance it's a fun way to polish your moves and get practice. I also bought her other DVDs those also have great moves and plenty of practice sections.,1392163200,2,663,4.26984126984127
2711160,4,B000LP5CHU,But it did teach me some good moves that I was abole to use in the bedroom.  Very good teacher.,1363305600,,95,3.75
2711161,1,B000LP5CHU,The video was absolutely horrible.  It was not a work out at all  Didn't raise my heart rate at all nor was it sensual.  It was a complete waste of money! Dont buy it!,1358208000,,167,3.8529411764705883
2711162,1,B000LP5CHU,Me and the girls all said... this is not what you would think... there is definitely no exercise to this DVD and it is what you would call Boring..,1352160000,,147,4.103448275862069
2711163,5,B000LP5CHU,"Alot of reviews already. I agree with one, this is not really a ""workout.""  No warm-up or cool-down. Though it will give you a chance to stretch & do some toning, it's more of a tutorial. Miss M shows you steps and then there are short choreographies. She also shows you how to transition seemlessly between moves and get that sinuous, sexy look when you dance. It's a beginner level- so no previous experience needed and anyone in average shape should be able to accomplish it.

There are three chapters: Exotic Dance, Floorwork & Chair Dance. She teaches each step-by-step with transitions, then after each section puts the moves into a short choreography. (these are done with no shoes on)

Then at the end of the DVD there is a full Choreography you go through (with your heels on), that combines all of the moves from each chapter.

I have never done this type of dance before, and I was a little nervous but she made it easy to follow and fun. Now I have all three of her exotic dance DVDs, and I have been very happy with them. They are really fun to do. I can't wait to try it out on my boyfriend.",1334102400,7,1105,4.349514563106796
2711189,3,B000LP5CHU,"It's okay. I think the title is misleading. It's definitely very sexy. Dance? what do i know. she is mostly walking around sexy, and then stretching around on a chair or on the floor like a kitty cat and then rubbing her legs in the air. Not bad. very nice, actually. However, to me that's not really dancing. It's also no way definitely not a workout. a nice little walk around and stretching routine. so okay. I got Sexy Moves for the Club dvd, and to me, That one is an exotic dance workout. much better. I recommend it. This one is nice, too, but it's too slow and easy to be much more than a stretching routine.",1329350400,,616,4.228813559322034
2711190,5,B000LP5CHU,"Wasnt as fancy as I was hoping for as an intermediate dancer, but it was a great step by step breakdown of a few nice routines for ppl just starting out.",1291593600,2,153,3.967741935483871
2711191,1,B000LP5CHU,Kind of slow and boring. Not at all what I expected. Not much of a workout either. I did it twice and am not at all interested in doing it again. A total waste of money.,1282953600,5,169,3.7222222222222223
2711192,5,B000LP5CHU,"I love this DVD!  However, it is NOT a real workout. It does teach you the basics of exotic dance and Lady M is great! These moves will leave you feeling feminine, sexy and ready to delight your main squeeze! I just wish she would come out with a Belly dance DVD!!",1268697600,3,264,4.076923076923077
2711193,5,B000LP5CHU,This is a professional workout video. The instructor makes it fun. I truly recommend it.,1267574400,2,88,4.933333333333334
2711194,4,B000LP5CHU,"I love this dance dvd work out, she is great and I love her moves. Very sexy and feminine. I have learned some moves from her and really feel sexy doing it (does not have the whole lot of different moves though). At first, I didn't think it ""work out"" but it works, I actually felt sore in some areas after practicing it.

Although, I don't think it would help much if you want to drop 10, 15 or 20 pounds with it, if that is what you are looking for. It's just a workout to keep your body sexy and tight, but it's not a ""real work out"" to help you lose weighs, so make sure you don't put a lot of hope in it :)

Anyway, I love it as I don't even weigh over 100 lbs, I just want to feel sexy and need some fun working out, so I'm happy with it. Will buy another one after this.

2711195,4,B000LP5CHU,"First of all, I actually bought two Madame M's, another instructional DVD called Strip To It, and one of the ""Fawnia"" striptease DVDs, all at one. I think the combination of all really worked to strengthen the impact of each one individually. If I'd had any ONE of these DVDs only, I wouldn't have gained enough movement vocabulary to put any kind of routine together. Okay, so that said, about this DVD in particular.

I'm 40 and have ballet, tap, jazz dance experience, but nothing in the way of social dancing, hip-hop, or exotic moves at all, and little confidence in this area. For me, this DVD as an instructional video was really tasteful, perfectly paced, unintimidating, and approachable. After instruction on certain moves, you do a short little combination to show you how you can link some of the moves together. I personally spent a lot of time rewinding and practicing each individual move over and over until it felt natural for my body, and then moved on to the next bit. I think that approach really helped me do the choreography part. Three sections - standing, floor and chair - I was particularly interested in the standing part, not so much the rest, so I personally wished the sections were longer. But in combination with the Strip to It DVD, it gave me great stuff to work with.

The demonstration routines at the end not entirely representative of the moves you learn throughout the DVD - they were faster, and included lots of new moves and combinations you don't see earlier. But you can't learn everything in one DVD. Besides, the demos are good for giving you ideas.

For the people who have or might criticize this DVD for it's music, or lack of work-out, or whatever - this is definitely not clubby, hip-hoppy, Christina Aguilara ""do-me"" type of stuff; and it's definitely not a dance-along work-out kind of thing. It's instructional. Learn it, practice it, find your own music, put your routine together, and pass the DVD onto someone else who wants to learn how to be a little more sensual with their bodies.

I'm pleased with the purchase and it's giving me exactly what I wanted.",1243555200,23,2114,4.705405405405405
2711196,4,B000LP5CHU,"I ordered this for my honeymoon. When I first watched the DVD, I was a little disappointed by the very slow pace.  But then I realized it has to be slow so you can get the moves down. After that you can speed it up to match whatever music you are using. In fact, one of my favorite CDs has several songs that would work perfectly with the dance movements on this DVD. I also ordered the ""Irrestistable Art"" DVD and I can't wait to see that one when it arrives. The two DVDs together should make sure my fiance' never forgets our wedding anniversary!",1237248000,5,549,4.228571428571429
2711197,5,B000LP5CHU,this is a very good item because you can learn the movement so fast. is funny and interest and you are exercising  the body at the same time . thanks,1233619200,2,149,3.966666666666667

It's not too simple, but it won't leave you hurting in the wrong ways, either.  If you want something with some feminine sass, this is a good one.",1444780800,,448,4.426829268292683

8162574,3,B000LP5CHU,"I recently purchased a number of Lady Morrighan's exotic dance dvds. Out of all of them, this one is the most simplistic. The moves are more slow-paced and somewhat sensual (but I would like to add that in my opinion, some more consideration could have been put into the articulation of the moves to make them more graceful and sexy-THIS definitely changes with her other Exotic Dance dvds, which I highly recommend...however they are a bit more advanced and will require more effort to learn)

I can only recommend this dvd to someone new to dance or who needs to  re-acquaint themselves with moving their body and thus could benefit from the simplistic nature of the movements contained within this dvd. As far as this dvd being called ""Exotic Dance Workout"" ......the moves in this dvd will barely get your blood flowing. If you're looking for a refreshing and sensual workout experience, this is NOT the dvd for you-however if you're someone who's interested in Exotic Dance and have little to no dance experience, this dvd can be considered ""ok"". It's nice in that it has simple moves to get one used to moving in a slower, more sensual nature, but in my opinion it could have been executed better. I'd give it a 6-7/10. Can be considered an ""introductory"" dvd to her other ""Exotic Dance"" dvd series (which is executed much more stylishly and has much more content, in my opinion.)",1420588800,4,1386,4.723140495867769
8162575,5,B000LP5CHU,"Lady Morrighan is so awesome. I love all of her DVD's even the Private Dancer which is for intermediate dancers, and the Stripper DVD that is oriented towards the professional club dancer, but it has a great little strengthening section. Back to this DVD. This is not your traditional workout, and I love that. No cardio ladies. I'm 61 and I'm in no condition to do jumping jacks or some of the faster moving exercise / dance DVD's. I like that she teaches some sexy moves that require strength and flexibility. She is usually dressed to the nines, so I understand that some women thought she looked a little like the ladies in the gym in her first segment. And some found it boring, but she has to show the moves and once you've go them, you're ready for the more fun material. I love the chair and floor work. I also enjoy learning a little dance routine to share with my hubby. It is not redundant to get her newer Exotic Dance Routing DVD. There is always a lot of new material. Only problem is I want to purchase some of her cute little outfits so I can really turn my man on.",1416441600,,1081,4.303921568627451
