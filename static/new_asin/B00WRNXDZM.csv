8714022,5,B00WRNXDZM,"A fun, thoughtful no-budget film. If you are looking for something unique, captivating and thought-provoking, this will surely whet your appetite. Richard delivers a gritty, yet meaningful grindhouse-esque approach to the romantic comedy genre.

The screenwriting is truly the biggest selling point here. We all know people like Zoey... people who have an intrinsic need to help. She is a trope that we all know in real life, but we rarely ever see in video, which Richards uses to his advantage to explore her 'saving' the boy, saving herself - and how, or even if, a relationship can be built on this foundation.

Oh, and there are fights. And plotting. And archangel-like characters who are stopping the apocalypse. And supporting characters that ill make you spit the bourbon you are sipping right out your nose.

Also, take note that this movie is not about religion in either a negative or positive term. The title is an allegory as you, the viewer, will soon find out.

This film is also interesting on another whole different facet. It breaks away from traditional filmmaking - something film students likely often want to do but are too afraid when it comes to setting a new precident. Much like a Woody Allen film, most every sequences are in a single frame from start to finish. The actors are raw, the filmmaking is raw, the sound is raw. It is a raw film - I would almost go as far to say that it verges on Dogma 95, save for a few ""rules."" Unlike a lot of other indie films out there of its caliber, it doesn't claim to be what it is not. It doesn't try to harness the look and feel of something done with high end equipment, but instead Richards experiments with an organic, rough-hewn approach that makes this film memorable. It is unlike any of his other works in production style. Watching it, you can tell that it knows what it is doing and does an interesting job at it - complete with an unsuspected animated sequence.

Seriously, if rent this. Invite some friends over and enjoy some booze because this is everything you will look for in an independent film. Mumblecore be damned, we have a new style in the house and it is called Christ Complex.",1430092800,,2168,4.606217616580311
