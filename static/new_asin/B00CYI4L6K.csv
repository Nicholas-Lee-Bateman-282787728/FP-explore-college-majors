5751794,3,B00CYI4L6K,"Eli (J. Michael Trautmann) who is off his meds, believes his dead brother Devon (Patrick de Ledebur) is going to come back from the grave and kill the students who killed him in an unsolved hit and run. Jessica Parker (Mischa Barton) the the school psychologist is attempting to wade through all of this while her deputy boyfriend (Devon Sawa) is out investigating weird things such as Devon's grave being dug up.

The film is more mystery than horror as we try to wade through things with Jessica deciding if Devon is back from the dead or if this an elaborate hoax as the body count climbs.

I liked J. Michael Trautmann as the creepy kid. Unfortunately the film needs an upgrade in dialouge and horror. The production gets failing marks as a horror film, but passing grades as a suspense/mystery. Mischa Barton, one of my favorite B girls, was unconvincing in her scenes with Trautmann due to script dialouge.

A decent rental if horror is not the main goal.

What was with the sigma nu delta frat paddle located in the principle's (Michael Clarke Duncan) office?

5751795,3,B00CYI4L6K,"A strange outcast kid (J. Michael Trautmann) who likes to draw has recently lost his brother in a mysterious hit and run accident. He claims his brother is returning from the dead with the help of a witch, becomes entangled with the brother's former rivals, and the school shrink (Mischa Barton) attempts to intervene. Some really crazy and tragic stuff follows.

A RESURRECTION is decently acted and quite well-filmed: The winter scenery adds a great deal to the atmosphere. The first 20 minutes or so are very engrossing, but the storyline then progressively staggers, quickly degenerating into a pretty ho-hum slasher flick. A RESURRECTION may be worth seeing if you're a big supernatural horror (or Mischa Barton) fan; but then again, you've probably seen this movie many times before.

There's a lot more they could have done with this. More back-story on the brother's death and why it happened might have helped.",1385769600,2,919,5.0394736842105265

5751797,5,B00CYI4L6K,"Comparisons to The Skeleton Key or The Unborn.  Very creepy and eerie with a suspenseful story line keeping you at the edge of your seat.  Great ending I didn't see coming. I also love the actors in it!!! If you are a MISCHA BARTON FAN WATCH THIS!!!  She looks great and does an amazing acting job!!! Reminds me of why I fell in love with her when I first saw her as Marissa Cooper on The O.C.  Mischa is back!!! I purchased this film, thought all aspects of the film were great--writing, directing, producing, and great acting by an all-star cast!!! I have heard some bad reviews of Mischa's other recent horror movie Apartment 1303 which I have not seen.  I promise you  A Resurrection will not disappoint you and I assure you this movie will freak any scary movie fan out!!!",1378771200,5,777,4.436619718309859

5751799,2,B00CYI4L6K,This movie was not really worth the Amazon price. It was boring and not worthy of the description of a being called a super natural movie.,1376092800,2,138,4.346153846153846
5751800,3,B00CYI4L6K,"For me personally I am split on how I feel about A Resurrection. The film was shot very well with a complete seriousness to the storys subject matter. It held a continuous dark foreboding and atmosphere of unease which kept the film in a complete suspenseful state of drama. The acting came off as believable and I felt these characters come alive in this twisted story of loss and resurrection. The movie hit on a pretty prevalent subject that plagues communities and schools across this nation with underage drinking, bullying and teen violence not to mention the social inequalities. All this made for a very dramatic and intensely entertaining plotline in the film. My issue lies with the fact that the horror was mediocre. It was as if the director made a staunch attempt to avoid any elements that a story like this practically demands to be displayed. There was no real scares or moments of intense chills in scenes that needed to be and the sequences that lead to death were completely shied away from which was very disappointing.

 A Resurrection is a safe ""PG-ish"" film for fans of supernatural melodramas but if you're a straight up horror fan then your going to be very disappointed because the horror is non-existent in this film . The story is a good one and the suspenseful and dark atmosphere make the film a nice movie to watch with your grandmother or someone who doesnt like other more gory horror films but it is also a film that could have been better in so many ways. So I am conflicted on the movie because I liked what it turned out to be even though it wasn't what I hoped for. So for anyone setting out to view this film just keep in mind that it is a psychological thriller more than it is a horror film.",1433462400,,1732,4.512738853503185

5751802,5,B00CYI4L6K,"After once again not expecting much from this movie due to the generally lower ratings and reviews on IMDb, I was once again very pleasantly surprised.  Without giving away any spoilers, and starting with the characters and actors themselves, I am convinced that Mischa Barton could turn in a Meryl Streep level, Oscar-winning performance, yet the majority of people reviewing on these types of sites would be ripping her to shreds.  Ill admit I am a fan of hers anywayalthough admittedly more of some of her work and less of others--but instead of being disappointed as I was expecting, I found her performance very solid in this film, as I have her roles in other thriller/suspense movies shes done.  It was nice to see her in another more adult role, and unlike many horror-type films, if anybody is making dumb moves in this movie, it is not her lead female character.  In fact I thought she portrayed this role of somebody thrust into an impossible situation that challenges her beliefs yet forces her to consider and even accept that perhaps some things truly are possible very believably.  And I truly thought she handled it as ably as anybody could have, from her initial empathetic approach to dealing with an obviously emotionally disturbed youth through the various stages required as she begins putting pieces together!  Finally, I appreciated that a movie gave the female lead the chance to be the thinking one, and in this case, the most heroic despite being imperfect and flawed (for instance, not being able to come up with the Lords Prayer when needed, and some choice lines that I found notable in one sense or another), albeit in an impossible-to-win situation.

As far as the other characters are concerned, it took me a few minutes to realize I was watching the kid from the original Final Destination movie (having done something of a Michael C. Hall transformation into adulthood from the looks of it to me).  As the Deputy, if there was one character I found frustrating, it was hisbut only in the way the character was written.  As one other reviewer mentioned, you kind of know whats comingbut this movie doesnt play it out as many would have, and the Deputy is less than the heroic character I expected he would have been when he finally gets to the school.  Albeit, he does play a key role in the unexpected twist toward the end.  Michael Clarke Duncans performance is as always solidmy only complaint being that we didn't get enough of him (thats not a cut to the script, just an acknowledgement that we won't get to see much more of him in the work hes left behind), and another likely heroic character not coming through as might have been expected.  Finally, although I don't know the kid playing Eli, I agree with others who defended his performanceas a kid whos just lost his beloved brother in such a brutal way, the only person who ever loved him, I found his brooding, angry Eli (yet sympathetic as well in at least one sense) seemingly well-handled for the situation.  Without giving anything away, Ill also say that despite many saying this writing and movie was horrible, the portrayal of Eli was spot-on, there are unexpected twists with several of the key characters, and I also found myself thinking about this movie for a while after watching it.

So as others have said, if you like your movies to show a lot of brutal killings, this is not the movie for you.  But the sound effects, the tension throughout, and a few unexpected jumps provide more than sufficient suspense.  So if you instead appreciate a more thoughtful, suspenseful supernatural tale that does not play out exactly as you might think it would, you should find this movie worthwhile.  I do not claim to be an expert on movies dealing with the supernatural, but this movie tells a story of one such situation that seems as believable as any other supernatural approach would beand for that, this movie and these actors told the story as well as could be expected and better than many such movies.  I will certainly be buying it for my collection--and as one other reviewer noted, it does end in a creepy way that definitely leaves it open for a second part, which I for one would look forward to.",1414886400,,4208,4.694293478260869

5751805,1,B00CYI4L6K,"Given the cast, I expected so much more from this movie. Unfortunately, even the best acting can't get beyond a bad script. It felt like there a few different movies happening at once, the storyline was all over the place. Any acts of horror happen off screen so there is nothing to generate a feeling of fear or suspense.",1396742400,,322,4.47457627118644
5751806,2,B00CYI4L6K,Duncan is/was an amazing actor. But this film left something out. A great script? A better director? Better actors? I don't know. But it didn't live up to what I hoped.,1396310400,,168,4.451612903225806
5751807,4,B00CYI4L6K,"Very interesting film, different from anything I have seen. I do not know why some reviewers did not like the performance of the male lead, (J.Michael Trautmann as Eli).  IMO, he was spot on!  How else would you play that role? I think he was very believable as the grieving brother who knew he was into something absolutely horrible. As far as the story goes, it is fiction (that is a good thing), so you really just need to go along and not pick it apart too much.  Would have liked to see a different ending, but I still found the film entertaining and engrossing. Also, great acting by Nick Jandl, as the main bully, and Annie Kitral, as The Bruja. Devon Sawa gave a solid performance, as well. Michael Clarke Duncan (R.I,P. Big Guy) must also be mentioned here, as he was awesome as always, but seeing him in this film was bittersweet.",1390348800,,840,4.441558441558442
