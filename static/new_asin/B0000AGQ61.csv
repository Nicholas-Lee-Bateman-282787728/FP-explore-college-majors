Amelie is my fave movie of all time, it touched me, it moved me and its just like its main star...beautiful, scrumptious and likable!!! Amelie is a little french waitress...who after finding a chldhood treasure of a man who once lived in her apartment, she seeks out on being a regula dogooder, making couples fall in love, finding ways to make those who mourn, be comforted, punishing hose who are mean...all whilst neglecting her own love life...Chocolate, Johnny Depp, and Judie Dench in a film...sounds good to me.

7997189,4,B0000AGQ61,"Romantic movies somehow seem a lot sweeter when they don't fit the usual boy-meets-girl mold. Four such movies make up the Miramax Inspired Romance Collection, four romantic movies that will make you want to cuddle up under a blanket (even the somewhat silly ""Chocolat"").
""Amelie"" is the charming tale of a young French woman (Audrey Tautou), secluded and shy. But when she returns a childhood toy to a man, changing his lonely life, Amelie decides to keep doing good for others to improve their lives. But one of her deeds leads her to a handsome young man who may be her soulmate.... if Amelie can learn to help herself out too.
Sensuous, passionate ""Like Water For Chocolate"" introduces us to Tita (Lumi Cavazos) and Pedro (Marco Leonardi), young Mexican lovers who desperately want to get married. But Tita's domineering mother is determined to keep Tita single because of a mindless tradition. Pedro ends up marrying Tita's sister, and the heartbroken Tita is lost in her grief... only to have some very unpredictable things happen.
""Il Postino"" is the way to love, when an exiled Chilean poet (Philippe Noiret) settles on a small Italian island. He befriends a poorly-educated young fisherman, Mario (Massimo Troisi), who is given the duty of delivering the newly-enlarged mail inflow. When Mario falls in love with the beautiful Beatrice, he needs the poet's help -- and the power of poetry -- to win her heart.
""Chocolat"" celebrates joie de vivre, with big sides of chocolate (warning: Do not watch on an empty stomach). Vianne (Juliette Binoche) and her young daughter move into a small French town and set up a chocolate shop just at the start of Lent. What's more, Vianne strikes up a romance with a local drifter (Johnny Depp). The mayor is deeply ticked off by this, but as Vianne starts to improve their lives, the townspeople start warming up to her.
This collection is a pretty wide-ranging one. Some have the happy endings you'd expect, some turn out in ways you would never dream of. Okay, ""Chocolat"" is a bit silly even for magical realism; what keeps it from being absurd are the wonderful performances of Depp and Binoche. But these films have all kinds of romance -- the sparkling surrealism of ""Amelie,"" the stomach-tingling heaps of chocolate, the sweet lyricism of poetry, and the sexy, sensuous ""Like Water.""
Basically, the ""Inspired Romance Collection"" is a must-have for movie-loving romantics. Sweet, sexy, sparkling and may leave you feeling hungry for candy. A solid, beautiful collection.",1083801600,42,2520,4.9739336492890995
