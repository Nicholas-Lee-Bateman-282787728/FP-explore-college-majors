6888957,5,B00QUYITT4,"What A Happy Time, indeed! I've loved the music of the Happy Goodman Family (Howard, Sam, Rusty, and Vestal) for YEARS.  When Sam and Rusty died, it almost seemed the legacy was dying, too.  When Bill Gaither had Howard and Vestal on his videos, their musical journey went on for another decade with the added voice of Johnny Minick.  Well, now that Howard and Vestal have gone on to Heaven, the legacy continues with Rusty's daughter, Tanya, her husband, Michael Sykes, and Johnny Minick.  They sang a ""special"" for the church where Johnny is pastor and it went to YouTube. From there, people asked for appearances and a recording. Well, here is the DVD production of that recording. You MUST add this to your collection if you are like me, rooted in the music of the Happy Goodman Family. You will not be disappointed!",1423872000,,820,4.673611111111111
