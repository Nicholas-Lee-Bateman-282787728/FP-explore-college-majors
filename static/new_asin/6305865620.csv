Great acting all the way around!",1265760000,,76,4.428571428571429
1085160,5,6305865620,"When I was about 11 my mom bought this movie on VHS from a Christian/Family based movie salesperson that came to our door.  This is one of the worst acted movies I have ever seen.  However... that makes it entirely worth watching.  It is hysterical.  I'm particularly fond of the performances from the actors playing Kara and Jake's Girlfriend.  They are AWFUL. I have seen this movie no less than 50 times and it just keeps getting funnier every time.  I know that this wasn't the intent, yet now as a 26 year old I still have a special place in my heart for this flick.  Watch it once just to see the creepy actress playing Jake's girlfriend delivering the line, ""There they are,"" from a rescue helicopter.  Easily the worst acting in cinematic history.  I need to invest in a DVD copy since my tape is worn out.  Happy Laughing!",1248307200,2,831,4.443708609271523
1085161,5,6305865620,"I saw one of the White Wolf films and you could say fell in love with the movies, than I saw this film Cry in the Wild 2 and it was excellent from star to finish.  I love types of movies where people have to work together to pull through.  Each actor did their character well enough to believe in them and although some scenes are just okay, it pulls through at the end.  If you love wolves and teens working together to overcome nature's obstacles than this movie is for you!",1228348800,,476,4.1521739130434785
1085162,2,6305865620,"No big stars, budget or special effects here. Average acting and story line with a number of loop holes (as someone else mentioned). Maybe a good family movie or young person's movie. If you don't have high expectations and you want to watch an adventure movie without swearing, violence or sex etc. it is a movie for general exhibition. It is a movie you wouldn't watch more than once.",1226793600,,386,4.608695652173913
1085163,5,6305865620,"There's a film out there that combines teen themes with the white-knuckle adventure of a life-and-death struggle in the wilderness, that augments great acting with a brilliant script and top-notch production values. ""White Wolves - Cry in the Wild II"" is not that film. Instead, it's a poorly assembled movie that is most notable for its baffling scenes and characterizations - some that will make you scratch your head and others that will make you burst out laughing.

White Wolves starts innocently enough, with a crew of rowdy teens embarking on a camping trip with woodsman and role model Mr. B (Matt McCoy) as their guide. But after some mountaintop horseplay goes awry, Mr. B falls approximately twenty thousand feet to the ground below, crashing through trees and caroming off of boulders on his way down -- and somehow survives. Believe me when I say that this is easily the funniest plummet I have seen in a film since Sly lost his grip on that girl in ""Cliffhanger"".

The teens have to rescue Mr. B, and each has his or her own style, which leads to frequent clashes. Scott (Zach Morris) is an authoritarian thug who almost murders dweeby Adam (David Moscow) in a rage. Cara (Amy Dolenz) is distraught when Mr. B's accident seriously cuts into her flirting schedule. Benny (Marc Riffon) is a malcontent delinquent who can hardly function without his father figure. And Pandra (Amy O'Neill) is the weirdest one of all, as demonstrated by a ""romantic"" scene in which she and Adam confess their attraction to each other. It's quite possibly one of the strangest moments of teen love ever captured on film.

Just when you think this movie can't get any more weirdly, bizarrely entertaining, with ghostly white wolves appearing and disappearing and Mark-Paul Gosselaar ranting and raving, the kids get attacked by a BEAR!! You need to watch this scene in slow motion, which is where its fakeness and sheer absurdity really shines through.

""White Wolves - Cry in the Wild II"" is so bad it's good, and by that I mean it's awesome.",1165276800,4,2035,4.805714285714286

1085269,4,6305865620,"I grew up watching this movie and still love it! However, if you are going to buy it, you might want to buy the VHS version other than the DVD. We used to rent this movie as kids all the time and recently bought the DVD...we have come to find that the DVD has been edited. The scene where they are climbing the mountain and Adam gets to scared to keep moving has been cut. I'm sure there are other things cut out as well, but this is all we can remember. Even if you look at the running times, the DVD runs 74 mins, while the tape runs 90.",1338249600,12,539,3.909090909090909
1085270,1,6305865620,"Ok, so the worst scene in this film is when Pandra and Benny are walking to find help for Mr. B. While on thier journey, Pandraoeaoeaoeo is complaining about her more popular, much prettier sister. Then Benny stops her abruptly and says ""I find you attractive"". Then Panda Bear looks on the ground for a bit then says back ""I find you attractive too."" Then they just keep on walking and that is it. No kissing or nothing. I literally had to shove my head into a pillow to muffle my screams because I was laughing so loud. That scene put tears in my eyes.

The story of this film is about a bunch of campers and their 2 guides, Mr and Mrs. B. During their trip Mr. B pratically falls off the Grand Canyon and somehow survives with only broken bones, as he lands in the softest tree known to man. The campers have to split up to find help for Mr. B. To guide the campers along their journey a stupid wolf appears out of nowhere and tells them where to go.

The main character is this camper named Benny, who is angry at life. I mean this kid hates EVERYTHING; icecream, sunshine, Christmas, flowers, etc...You name it. He hates it. But, hey I guess I would too if I had his stupid name ""Benny"". Just change it to Ben, and you will be amazed at how much your mood improves Benny Boy.

Rent only to mock and make fun of.",1297296000,,1316,4.1936758893280635

Why didn't they release the whole original movie on DVD. They also did this on a movie called Breaking Free(VHS version whole movie) but when released on DVD changed the name to a Leap of Faith & cut a lot of good stuff out.,1508544000,,396,4.089743589743589

I was extremely disappointed that so many scenes were cut from the DVD - many of which showed important character development. Cut scenes include Jake convincing Ben to come on the trip at the beginning of the movie, Adam freezing in fear on the side of the mountain, Adam admitting that he doesn't know anything about first aid, Scott nursing Cara and Adam when they were sick...I'm sure there were others. The removal of the scenes ruined the story for me and made everything seem random and abrupt. Wish I could find an original complete version on DVD.",1486512000,6,648,4.643478260869565
