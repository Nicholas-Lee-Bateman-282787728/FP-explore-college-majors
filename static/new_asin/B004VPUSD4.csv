4483658,4,B004VPUSD4,"I was amazed at how deep this movie really is.  It captures the characters in a way you can actually put yourself in their position and wonder what you would do it you were faced with their challenges.  In a lead role, actress Ashley C. Willams made all the difference in this film.  Without such a stunning performance, the depth of the story could have easily been lost.  With her performance, I think this is a movie every aspiring actor should watch.",1374192000,,454,4.5
4483659,4,B004VPUSD4,"50 minutes into the movie, and so far I'm good with it. Could be that's because I  too have run low on gas WAY back in the hills. It's surprising how a nice day and pristine setting can suddenly turn ominous.

As for this film, the premise of a world-wide gas shortage leading to economic and social crises is certainly not farfetched, considering what's happening in the Middle East.

I think the two lead actors, Jon Carlo and Ashley C Williams, are portraying their characters very well, as did Barry McBrien as the motel manager. McBrien added tension to two scenes that could easily have been nothing but colorless conversations.

As a script writer (hey, just because nobody's bought my script doesn't mean I'm not a writer), overall I think Empty's screenplay is above average for films generally, and especially those made with a small budget. Tension is building, characters are  three dimensional, and there's even subtle irony at work (i.e,, be careful what you wish for). Several early scenes were disjointed or too long, but editing could have smoothed that out. A couple lapses of logic, nothing major. The foul language is getting irritating, like Carlo's character (not the actor himself). 'Hansard' reminds me of that whiny Marine in Aliens 2 - the one who eventually made me start rooting for the aliens.

Back to the movie...

At 68 minutes: I like the way this story is portraying 2 people dealing with an out of the blue crisis in believable ways, as opposed to somehow becoming superheroes to extricate themselves. My opinion of Hansard is improving too, but I have a feeling that won't last much longer.

Back to the movie...

The ending was a big surprise. I'll give it that.",1349827200,,1699,4.791095890410959
4483660,1,B004VPUSD4,"I can not understand how bad movies make it to dvd. I've seen plenty on amazon. This movie is very slow ,boring and after wasting your time to get to the ending the screen blacks out you can only hear whats happening. So now I have wasted my time and still don't know what happened at the end. I can guess but do not have visual confirmation. Oh well, on to more slow bad movies courtesy of amazon prime.",1345161600,,404,4.1265822784810124
4483661,2,B004VPUSD4,"The movie starts with an insecure slacker asking hypothetically (on a camping trip), what would his rich girlfriend say if he asked her to marry him. She remains silent and emotional. The remaining 80 minutes or so plods along,mostly focusing on how they react in a crisis. Umm..after 10 minutes you want to scream and tell the pretty girl ""Just Say NO"". The man-boy pretty much offers more and proof as to why ""NO"" should be the answer.

The sci-fi disaster film motif is totally a vehicle to dissect this ill-fated relationship. It is ""watchable"" especially as a free movie on Amazon Prime.

The Swiss film (from the 1970's) LE RETOUR D'AFRIQUE (RETURN FROM AFRICA) by Alain Tanner is funnier, and more satisfying. ""Empty"" isn't shallow, the characters are developed well enough, however it could have been subtitled ""10 Days at the End of the World, with a guy my Dad said was worthless"" Daddy's right this one time.",1344729600,8,919,4.773584905660377
4483662,1,B004VPUSD4,"Let me start by saying ""I love a good catastropy/end of civilization movie.""  This is not one.  The basis of the movie is that there is suddenly no gas anywhere.  No explanation is given at all - not even any conjecture.  Any good catastrophe flick needs some remotely plausible reason for the crisis.  Unfortunately, fixing this would not fix the movie.  The main characters where inconsistent in their personalities (reactions to situations).  They were not flushed out well and remained two dimensional instead of drawing you into the movie.  Thoughout the film I kept looking for some explaination of events, actions, reactions - there was none.

I watch movies while I treadmill.  I set my standards fairly low as I just like something to occupy the hour plus I spend exercising.  The only reason I watched this all the way through was I stubbornly kept hoping that it would get better and provide answers to any of the questions the movie raised.  Not one was answered.  I won't give away the ending but to say it was bad is an understatement.  It felt as if they ran out of time (it was too long as it was) and just found away to end it and fade to black.",1344643200,5,1162,4.524038461538462
4483663,3,B004VPUSD4,It is an entertaining B movie with a fairly good story line. There are not really any special effects but the story carries you through and is captivating.  After getting through the first 10min or so I was at the edge of my seat.  And the unexpected ending was done really well.,1344470400,,279,4.346153846153846
4483664,1,B004VPUSD4,"I tried to like this - I really did. But the overdrawn and plodding script, shallow acting and moronic characterization marks this as a student film.

It has an interesting premise and I'd love for this filmmaker to come back to this project in 10 years with more experience under his belt - really think it would be fascinating. That, or a better production company reboots the entire project with better actors, a tighter script and logic-based storytelling. There's a nugget of a coal that I believe can be turned into a fire, eventually leading to a really good movie.

But this schoolhouse clunker with its incomprehensible pathetic ending ain't it.

You can always spot a very young filmmaker: Somehow incorporating death brings ""maturity"" to their efforts. I've read many first-time storytellers/creators and invariably they use death as a flourish to their efforts; a stretch for cleverness with no real sense of what they're attempting. After a while it's actually quite amusing. As you read their very predictable fare - you just know they're trying desperately to do a M. Night Shyamalan: To get a 'gasp', an 'oh', or 'I didn't see that coming' out of you.

Personal Note: Could they find a more skeezy weirdo in Barry McBrien's portrayal of the hotel manager? Talk about a miscast. Yikes.",1327708800,6,1300,4.922374429223744
4483665,1,B004VPUSD4,"Why would any of the creators of this film think that they had made a movie?  Fans of PA genre, please don't pay to watch this.  Buy an extra freeze-dried meal instead.",1319068800,,168,4.21875
4483666,1,B004VPUSD4,"That's right... this movie just secured the number 1 spot on my list of the worst movies I've ever seen. It would be safe to say that it made the top spot on my son's list, too. I'm sorry this is so harsh, but it's just not a good movie. The acting wasn't good, the soundtrack was very (very) repetitive, the story line was bad and the boyfriend character was a complete d*uche. If he didn't prove it by his actions throughout the entire movie, then he definitely proved it at the ending. And even mentioning 'The Road' or 'The Happening' on the cover in any other context than something like: ""Some people involved in this movie once saw the movies 'The Road' and 'The Happening'"" is completely misleading. Speaking of the cover, that scene as shown never happens. You do see the clip from which the two main characters as shown are pulled from, but they're not walking through an ashy wasteland... just down a deserted, snow-covered road, with no cars in sight.

 I love the PA genre and like to support indie films when I can, but I can't recommend this movie.",1317081600,12,1063,4.474226804123711
4483667,1,B004VPUSD4,"Absolute waste of money. Has to be the worst movie of all time. Poor story progression, poor plot links, poor acting, poor everything. Story preview sounded good, but...NOT!

4483670,2,B004VPUSD4,"***SPOILERS***

This movie had a promising premise, but as it went on I realized that it needed more substance and production value to pull off. I found much of the dialogue forced and the guitar music incongruous at times (like during arguments etc.). I also found Dell to be abusive to Piper, which seemed unnecessary for the story - both because it made him less appealing to be such a jerk to her for no apparent reason, and also because it led to several stilted scenes of repetitive arguments. That was, ironically, too realistic. I did not enjoy seeing a realistic couple fight - it is boring and redundant to anyone who's ever been in one or heard one. Also it seemed like Dell shot Piper and the others in the car (?) at the end, which I guess confirms his abusive nature but seemed a bit random as an ending.

I don't want to be too harsh on the effort, though. It's much easier to criticize a film than to make a better one in its place. So I think there is potential here; I just don't think this is the film that shows that potential in action.",1433376000,,1057,4.306532663316583
4483671,1,B004VPUSD4,"If you're goal is to watch two 20-something's fight like spoiled idiots, this movie is for you.  Let's not even get into the ridiculous idea that the gasoline supply shuts off like a spigot.  The nearly incessant guitar strumming that passes for a soundtrack is almost, but not quite, as annoying as Kimye.  If I had tonight's entertainment choices to do ever again and it was between a brick to my own head and watching this movie in full, I'd consider the brick to be sweet release.",1430265600,,484,4.540229885057471

Empty (2011) *1/2 / 4
D: C.S. Drury
C: Ashley C. Williams, Jon Carlo
P: A couple struggles to survive when the United States is thrown in turmoil when the gasoline supply runs out.

The idea of centering the demise of US around the notion that things would fall apart if their was no more gas is an intriguing concept. The thing with Empty though is that they take that concept and make it a sub-plot instead.

Empty puts its main focus on a couple caught in the middle of it all and their romantic troubles during this event. In the process, Empty shifts the focus away from what makes it unique and distinctive in favor of something more conventional and expected.

The romantic relationship at the center of Empty isn't all that interesting while the sub-plot certainly is. That is what is so frustrating about Empty. When it is focusing on what would happen during this event, the momentum increases and there is a genuine suspense as to how the story will unfold. However, viewers are stuck watching this couple bicker back & forth for most of the film's running time, something that has been done a million times. There's this compelling sub-plot that is barely explored. Empty is guilty of taking what makes it special, the film's sub-plot, and squandering that opportunity in order to tell a formulaic story. [R] 82 mins.",1389225600,,1434,4.724
8443730,1,B004VPUSD4,"Ashley C. Williams is good as Piper.

The direction and photography were o.k.

The writing was just horrible, as was most of the acting. The story itself was brain dead. Who ever wrote the screenplay was just totally clueless. If your are going to do some sort of post apocalyptic story, at least pick a scenario that makes a tiny bit of sense and have it effect the population and the setting in a reasonably realistic manner.

I won't waste any more time reviewing this, wasted enough time watching it.",1473292800,,504,4.5777777777777775
8443731,3,B004VPUSD4,"I thought the script had some decent thought put into it.  For what it is the acting wasn't exactly horrible.
