8195455,1,B000QCQ8AS,"I didn't see it was a 16 minute film. How can you charge $ 22.50 or so for such a short movie. And not good either.

People out there don't buy it. It's the worst I've ever seen.

8195456,5,B000QCQ8AS,"This film is not a take-off on 'Waiting for Godot'. The original is so rich in evrything in addition to the absurdity of the human condition that, others can easily extract ideas, parts and pieces from it and make their own masterpieces. 'Waiting for Woody Allen' is not a masterpiece, but it is a very well made and very well acted short film. The Central Park scene is a good choice instead of the usually alien landscape of Godot on stage.

This is not for Neil Simon fans. It is for those who enjoy Edward Albee or Harold Pinter, or Tom Stoppard, or Salvador Dali.

I just wished..................No, not that Woody Allen would appear. That the film was just a bit longer, because I enjoyed it so much.",1243900800,4,706,4.5078125
8195457,5,B000QCQ8AS,"This is an excellent short film which won the director, the DNA(Discovering New Artist) Award at The Los Angeles International Short Film Festival.  It has traveled the world appearing in nearly 40 film festivals.  It has been screened at Lincoln center in New York City and and the Taft museum in London.  For Beckett fans it is a must see.  Just a note, Woody Allen does not make an appearance, but if you know Beckett, you would already know this.  Also, it is only 16 minutes long, but at roughly a $1.25 per minute it is worth it. Enjoy!",1190073600,15,542,4.434343434343434
