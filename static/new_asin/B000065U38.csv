1708355,5,B000065U38,This is the start of a great collection I can't wait for Vol 3 of season one.  I Can't believe all the extra features that this dvd has cut scenes that has never been seen since the 1950's WOW,1026000000,,192,3.923076923076923
1708356,5,B000065U38,My wife loves the I Love You series and we live overseas and often miss some of these shows.  I hope they will release the full season box set as this is what we are waiting for.,1025395200,3,178,3.810810810810811
1708357,1,B000065U38,"this is ridiculous to have only 4 episodes per disc.  don't these people know that we would pay MORE to have more per disc?
I'm waiting to purchase till they figure this out.......",1025222400,6,180,4.454545454545454
1708358,1,B000065U38,"It's totally unreasonable that the  studio is only putting 4 episodes per DVD. One of the things great about DVD is that it took less shelf space than bulky VHS tapes.  I bought the box set of the first season of Star Trek The Next Generation. It contains 7 DVD's and takes up LESS than 2 inches wide of shelf space, plus it's nice and organized. All the Lucy fans I know would have paid a premium price for it released in the same format as I just described.  Now most of them will be thinking why bother to replace my Columbia House VHS collection when this is going to take up almost as much room.  Like an earlier reviewer wrote, if they could do it with The Simpsons First Season, why couldn't they do it with I Love Lucy first season!!!",1024617600,11,742,4.204225352112676
1708359,5,B000065U38,"Im only giving this 5 stars because I love I Love Lucy to death (and have since around the age of 7). My guess is that they are releasing this like England releases Friends. In England they release Friends with 4 episodes per DVD/tape but usually release 3 DVDs/tapes at a time. I live in the U.S. but know this from browsing www.amazon.co.uk. But to me it is stupid to do this to I Love Lucy. The  only reason Friends is released that way is so that Friends fans can own and enjoy earlier episodes from the current season whenever they want(I personally find this sorta stupid to). I Love Lucy is 50 years old, and I can guarantee the company that makes these that the first season has already aired and more that once. This way is soooo incredibly stupid. We Americans got Friends, MASH, All in the Family, ect. in a first season box set, and we should get I Love Lucy that way. I personally will wait until they release the whole first season in this completely ignorent way then look for a release date for a box set. I luv ya Lucy, but not the people distributing these.",1023840000,6,1075,4.321782178217822
1708360,5,B000065U38,"I LOVE LUCY is a truly classic TV show, and I've fallen in love with it since summer 2000 when I started watching syndicated reruns.  Needless to say I was thrilled when I heard these DVDs are being released.  To all of those who are grumbling about it not being issued as deluexe complete season boxed sets, I'd like to offer some food for thought.
* These classic shows have already been issued on DVD as part of an exclusive Colombia House Collector's Edition series, but even there they are not issued as complete season sets.  With this as the second DVD release of the series, expectations aren't very high for a third, so don't hold out for Complete Season sets.  These are the best we're going to get until they finish all the volumes of Season 1 - they MIGHT just box all the volumes and make a complete season set available, but it would be no better in terms of content than this, and you'd have to wait longer for them to get done releasing them in volumes and box them.  If you're a true Lucy lover and have to have the complete series on DVD, just get these and stop complaining.
* Complete Season sets are VERY expensive, sometimes over [dollar amount] even on discount.  At [dollar amount] apiece retail, these DVDs are a steal compared to season sets.  It probably WOULD be cheaper in the long run as season sets, and they'll end up making more money off us loyal Lucy lovers this way, BUT in the short term it's a sweeter deal.  Most two hour movies are [dollar amount], and you're telling me I can get two hours worth of I LOVE LUCY shows for [dollar amount] and four hours for [dollar amount] if I buy Volume 2 as well?  YAY!!
* On Complete Season sets, it only raises the price to produce bonus discs when the series takes up so many discs -- 5 or 6 for normal sets -- anyway.  Here we get the episodes AND bonus features.  Plus, since they're taking so many individual discs to do it, in the end we have MORE ROOM for bonuses then most Complete Season sets.  I for one cannot wait to see the original animated openings and here episodes of Lucy and Dezi's radio show MY FAVORITE HUSBAND.  Plus we get goofs, bluffs, cast/crew info, and occasionally LOST FOOTAGE restored into the episodes!  Yay, no?!
I hope this food for thought has helped some of you complainers get past the fact that Complete Season sets are not a reality for I LOVE LUCY, and I hope that you'll buy these DVDs anyway so that you too may enjoy this American TV classic at your pleasure instead of waiting for them to rerun your favorite episode.  If you are a true Lucy lover, this is a dream come true!",1022889600,7,2596,4.345755693581781
1708361,3,B000065U38,"We've all see I Love Lucy a million times, so let's make this DVD release something special!  Include the orginal show openings on each episode, not just once as an extra.  Include the complete episodes, with long deleted footage restored.  And include the original sponsor commercials.  In short, the episodes on these DVDs should be presented as they were originally broadcast in the 1950s!!  Few fans have ever seen them this way.  Now that would be something special.",1021507200,8,471,4.9743589743589745
1708362,4,B000065U38,"""I Love Lucy,"" is the most watchable comedy series ever to be produced and it's release on DVD should ensure it's title as the best of the best. I originally purchased the three episode video cassettes from Columbia House at a much, much larger price tag, so this four episode disc at a much lower one, and with DVD being the superior medium in features, sound and picture, makes me quite happy and particularly amused by grumblings of others wanting more per disc. Lucy is certainly worth the wait! Just ask the people who waited patiently every Monday night just for one episode back in the 50's.",1020124800,5,598,4.598130841121495
1708363,5,B000065U38,"For all of us, young and old who LOVE LUCY this new DVD set looks to be, the beginning anyway,of a dream come true!  As any true LUCY fan will notice, the episodes are being released in the ORDER of their ORIGINAL AIRDATES! That is fantastic! Better yet all the episodes,except the PILOT episode have never been released on video before, unless you paid the big bucks to get them through the ... club!  Besides getting these treasured episodes, fans have also been rewarded with what appears to be some great bonus material which includes the shows ORIGINAL OPENINGS!  It APPEARS that every episode of I LOVE LUCY is on it's way to DVD and they are kicking off the series with SEASON 1 VOLUME 1 AND SEASON 1 VOUME 2!  HOPE SEASON 1 VOLUMES 3 & 4 COME SOON AFTER!  Contrary to some previous reviews, I believe the price is EXTREMELY reasonable.  Look at what [club] charges for each DVD in their collection!  I can't wait to get my I LOVE LUCY DVD's and start my collection of the best TV show ever made! PLEASE......RESERVE YOUR COPIES ALSO!",1019260800,15,1041,4.476190476190476

I definitely do not regret watching this series!
I love to curl up in bed with my mom and watch this show.
My grandmother was born in 1943 and she grew up in the 50s era, and I personally love the 50s!
My grandmother & I both love this show!
The two best episodes,in my opinion,in this series,are:
Vitametavegemin,where Lucy does a tv commercial;it is hilarious!
My other favorite is in season 1,the episode is Job Switching.
I think that anyone who watches this episode will fall in love with the whole series!
I also think that Fred and Ethel are hilarious together when they call each other names! LOL!",1518393600,,709,4.5390625

1708817,5,B000065U38,"It's hard to believe that so many classic episodes came from I LOVE LUCY SEASON ONE but you get the Vita-Meta-Vega-Min (Lucy Does A Commercial), Lucy as ""Carmen Miranda"" (Be A Pal), Lucy Bakes A Giant Bread (Pioneer Women), Frozen Lucy (The Freezer), and Lucy torturing Ricky's scalp (Ricky Thinks He's Getting Bald) episodes, which are some of my favorite.

Even though I already owned season one on DVD, I was curious as to how they could possibly improve on the picture. On the Blu-Ray, the image looks as though it's almost in 3D where the foreground really comes into sharp focus. I seem to notice more detail in the pattern of the furniture, walls, and the characters' clothes that I didn't seem to notice on the DVDs. There's a definite improvement in picture quality from watching I LOVE LUCY on video tape and even on reruns on television (when you jump from that to the DVDs), but it's a little harder to discern the difference between DVD and Blu-Ray.

You probably don't need to do the upgrade unless you're like me a die-hard I LOVE LUCY fan because the real difference in image quality is just that the foreground really pops on Blu-Ray, whereas on DVD the image is clear in both foreground and background.

I believe all the extras are ported over from the DVDs and this time the Blu-Ray allows you to watch with the actual sponsor commercials throughout. This is really interesting. I don't know if this is how it was done originally but the sponsor (in this case Philip Morris) is introduced in the beginning presenting the show and then talks about the product. During the first commercial break it goes back to talking about how great it is to smoke Philip Morris cigarettes, and then there's one more before the end of the show. I'm wondering if this is how I LOVE LUCY was shown back then, not just ILL but all shows, with one sponsor who gets to plug their product solely throughout the show.

It's entertaining and you get a kick out of the misinformation that Philip Morris was telling the audience. If you don't want to listen to the whole thing you can press the ""Next"" arrow on your remote to skip it and continue on with the show. You also have the option of just playing the ""hear on satin"" opening, which is what we're all used to, but then you don't get the cute animations and there's some toward the end of the season where Ball and Arnaz take part in the promos.

The Blu-Rays come housed in a regular sized clamshell case that holds all 6 discs, each Blu-Ray on their own holder, and the insert cover comes out so you can read episode information, synopsis and air date, for those who are looking for a certain episode.

Another great addition, I don't remember this on the DVDs, but on the special features here they discuss the supporting cast most were recurring actors/actresses who didn't have lines but were in almost every episode of I LOVE LUCY (like Hazel Pierce who Lucy fans will instantly recognize as she's in most of the background shots) so that was great to know.

I posted some pictures that I took of the TV screen showing the comparison in the special features of how the restoration has improved the video quality from what is being played on television now. The right side of the image shows the restoration, big improvement, while the left shows the image untouched.

Now that the price is almost half, I think any fan of I LOVE LUCY would love ULTIMATE SEASON ONE!",1442275200,14,3422,4.5528455284552845

1708831,5,B000065U38,"There is not a whole lot I can say about I Love Lucy that has not already been said. I Love Lucy is a great classic and we know Lucille Ball as the Queen of Television. I had owned all the seasons of I Love Lucy on DVD and always wondered if they would ever release I Love Lucy on Blu-ray but I thought they probably wouldn't, but I was sure wrong. When Season One was released I wasn't for sure if it would be worth it to upgrade, but I am glad I did!

The only thing I didn't like about this set was how expensive it was, and I waited until the price started to come down a bit. I guess HD is what makes this so expensive and many other factors that contribute to the merchandising of these I Love Lucy sets.

The Video quality is amazing and the audio quality too! As others have mentioned is the options to watch it in its original broadcast form when it aired back in the 1950's. There are so many extras that come on this set that makes it even more exciting!

If you are still waiting for the price to go down even more I say wait, but if you can't you will be happy to see Lucy in 1080p HD!!!",1438819200,,1100,3.9237668161434978

1709120,5,B000065U38,"""I Love Lucy"" has been issued on home video many times over many years. The Blu-ray edition of season 1 is pricey, but is amazing in quality and in extras. All of the shows are offered not only in their syndicated versions, but the way they were originally broadcast for the first time (with the original beginnings, endings and cigarette commercials). This took a lot of work for the producers; apparently the original 35MM negatives were cut over the years for various reasons, and quite a bit of work went into restoring older prints. There are even reruns with new beginnings made while Lucille Ball was recovering from the birth of Desi, Jr. as well as beginnings and ending of reruns from the mid-50s on Sunday nights. There are plenty of extras as well. This is what real fans of the series have been waiting for.

In season 1, there are many shows where both Lucy and Desi perform parts of the live act they took across the country to convince CBS that they were thoroughly believable as a couple, so these routines were already well rehearsed. It must be said that one of the underlying themes of the series is that Lucy has no talent even though she wants to be in show business. Of course the opposite is true, although Desi continues to tell Lucy she should stay at home. There are a lot of segments where Desi performs with his orchestra - this thread would be minimized in later seasons.

The studio audience often screams with laughter at the situations she finds herself in, and of course Ball reveals herself to be a major talent as a comedienne, dancer and part of a team with Desi, perhaps something that came as a shock since she was mostly known as a B-movie actress and radio personality up till then. Only a few times do we realize when these shows were made - the writers did not indulge in topical humor, which have made these shows timeless.

Of course, I hope it the remaining seasons come out soon.",1411257600,17,1926,4.512893982808023

1709126,5,B000065U38,"I didn't think it could get any better than the DVD edition from a few years ago, but I was wrong.  This surpasses the DVD's in that just about all of the episodes can be viewed as originally broadcast with commercials included.  There is actually an episode that has additional footage that was not in the original broadcast version.  Any changes are noted with disclaimers at the beginning of the episodes.  However, if you bought the VHS tape editions ever so many years ago, and like me, watched I Love Lucy on CBS weekeday mornings in the sixties, you may want to save those tapes for reference since the episodes on those tapes have cuts and re-edits not on either the DVD or Blu-ray sets.
A great bonus, too, is that somewhere along the way, they found the 35mm film of the original I Love Lucy pilot.  The version on the DVD set is reconstructed from a damaged 16mm print.  The picture quality is, of course, much better.  And there are differences in the introduction since the DVD version had to guess when reconstructing the first few frames of footage.
I'm very please with this set and look forward to more.

1709182,5,B000065U38,"It took me several weeks to decide that it was well-worth $60 to see Lucy in 1080p. As it turns out, it was worth much more than that! The set is loaded with unbelievable special features that will give hardcore fans and historians hours and hours of breath-taking footage.

The real reason to upgrade is, of course, the picture quality. Compared to the DVD, it is night and day. Even though Season 1 had some experimental filming problems (clips from the other seasons are noticably better in HD) it's still incredible that film this old can look this good. The audio quality is also significantly improved.

OVERALL: If you're a Lucy fan and feeling skeptical about dishing out that much dough for one season, trust me, it's worth it. I'm sure the restoration process was lengthy and expensive and the bonus features are so endless that you'll always encounter a new discovery. I'm hoping and praying that we'll see the other seasons soon, because one of the special features shows clips from the later seasons and the picture quality is jaw-dropping!

ALSO...the highlight of the set is never-before-seen costume and makeup tests of Lucy and Desi.  What a rare treat!!!

Yes, the price is more than the DVD's but there's also so much more to love about the blu-ray...and I'm sure it cost more to make them.

1709187,5,B000065U38,"Having bought various copies of the DVD sets, most episodes seemed pretty cleaned up already, so the actual episode quality is on par with or slightly better than the remastered DVD versions. What really looks great is the original openings/closings/commercials. They did a fantastic job on these elements, and they probably look better now then they did back in 1951.

I have always wanted to see the full original episodes, commercials and all as they originally aired.  This is such a treat.  I wasn't born until 1963, and have always wondered what ""Lucy"" looked like in it's original form.

In this age of political correctness, it's so refreshing to see these episodes the way they originally aired. I am a smoker, so have no problem with the cigarette theme of these early shows, even though they seem like propaganda with what we know today about cigarettes. But if it bothers you, you can watch the heart on satin versions. Personally, I like to see the originals, and I hope they continue this with the rest of the seasons should they be released.

I also hope they will be released on a somewhat shorter schedule then was previously the norm.

I always thought ""what's the point"" about releasing old TV shows on blu ray, when many DVD releases looked fine, but now I see the point.  Between this, and ""Little House On The Prairie"", I have become a fan of vintage TV on Blu Ray.

I have only scanned through the first disc to view the original openings (which I saw as ""extras"" on the other DVD releases) but never saw the complete original closings with announcements and all. Again, some snippets, and also some little tidbits of the commercials may have been extras on the other sets, but are standard here. I only saw the extras on the first disc, but am looking forward to viewing the entire set over the next several days.

Each episodes clocks in at about 30 minutes, so it seems everything has been included.

They did a wonderful job with the first season, and although a bit more pricey than the DVD releases, I personally think it's worth it because they put a lot of effort into this release.",1399593600,13,2113,4.625668449197861
1709188,5,B000065U38,"I received my set on it's release day, Tuesday, May 6th. I am now about six episodes in (just finished watching ""The Quiz Show""). I must say that the picture quality on the episodes I've watched so far has blown me away. Crystal clear and detail galore. Some of you may be thinking, ""is Hi-Def really worth it in Black & White?"". My answer to that is absolutely!

The only thing I've noticed is that the picture sometimes gets a little bit grainier or not as defined in scenes that fade in/out of where a commercial break would have been. This must be fairly common, because that is the case with my Star Trek TOS Blu-Rays as well. Not a big deal though, because it accounts for literally seconds of each episode.

I've been a devoted Lucy fan since my Great Grandmother introduced me to the show in the mid-80's. I used to order the VHS tapes from Columbia House, own all of the seasons on DVD, and am now the proud owner of the appropriately titled ""Ultimate Season One"".

I asked myself  'what more could they do to make it worth purchasing it again'?. Well, let me say they have topped themselves. Aside from  bonus features, some of which are not included anywhere else, are the episodes themselves. Each has been remaster for an even better quality but the thing that got my attention is the presentation. You can watch the episode commercial free with the classic heart opening that most people know from syndication. You also have the option to watch wit the original openings with stick figures of Lucy & Desi dancing around the sponsors product with the original commercials. In addition some of the episodes have a third option. Back in the 1950's reruns were not the norm so on the rare occasion when I Love Lucy reran an episode in Prime Time new opening credits were used and many times a new opening sequence leading into the rerun as if it were a flash back. You can also watch the full episode in this manner. And then some even have a fourth option which would be the episode with commentary. They have found a way to make an old favorite feel new again and I cannot wait for the remaining seasons to make it to Blu Ray.",1399507200,21,1301,4.416666666666667

Like most TV series, ""I Love Lucy"" grew more sure of itself as the first season went on, and you can see the characters and the comedy starting to evolve into patterns that would sustain the show for the rest of its run.

This first rate high quality DVD collection of the first season has more than just the series but goodies like Lucille Ball's radio series, ""My Favorite Husband,"" in its entirety. They include extra clips and the fabulous brilliant restoration and preservation of this brilliant funny series with a brilliant cast.

Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball brought fictional Ricky and Lucy Ricardos to life with their best friends and neighbors and landlords, Fred and Ethel Mertz. Hollywood and vaudeville veteran William Frawley played Fred Mertz who was Ricky's best friend and was Desi's friend in real life. Vivian Vance played Ethel Mertz and was Lucy's best friend, sidekick, and partner in crime. Fred and Ethel may have been seen as second bananas but ""I Love Lucy"" would have never been the same without them.

A real treat is seeing the actual pilot episode with the original opening credits and without Fred and Ethel. After the first episode which hasn't been seen in syndication and discovered in 1990, the following episodes remind me of those summer days where I watched ""I Love Lucy"" in the mornings.

1709272,5,B000065U38,"Okay so a lot of people are complaining about the price of this set, but if they bothered to look carefully this is for 6 Blu Ray disks.  Blu Ray DVDs are still more expensive than the typical DL-DVD (which is what the last two releases are printed on).  Also it appears there are a lot more bonus features that were never included in the other releases either (which is awesome) and that adds cost.  I don't feel the negative comments are justified just based on price.

Obviously this is CBS marketing capitalizing on the series (hence the Blu Ray release), and really the show has not been out of print.  It does not appear these DVDs have been colorized digitally either, recently they just repackaged the original release DVDs, and there is not much benefit to a black and white Blu Ray (maybe a sharper image and contrast).

I still give this 5 stars because it's I Love Lucy.  Without this show (and the pioneering camera techniques developed by Desi and Lucy) television would look a lot different.  It's also one of the best sitcoms ever developed (and certainly beats out 98% of the garbage on these days).  I am an owner of the first run DVD releases of the show, and no matter what, fans (new and old) will love this next generation release.

  To put it into perspective though, I don't consider $74 very expensive for the entire first season on Blu-ray. The episodes will be remastered and look better than they ever have. Audiences in the 1950's never saw the episodes so clearly.  And in the 1980's, VHS tapes of ""I Love Lucy"" from Columbia House cost $34.95 each, and contained only 3 episodes each.

The people at CBS are seriously taking advantage of people, and it's disgraceful. It's an honest look at how little CBS cares about their costumers.

They has all the local 'heros' on Soupy Sales, Harlow Hickenlooper , Cowboy Bob and Sammy Terry (who showed, mostly, B level horror movies).

But enough of the history lesson - I Love Lucy was one of the greatest and earliest SitComs of all time. Lucille Ball was one of the greatest stars of all time. Virtually everyone of all ages will simply LOVE this show. And the price is simply unbeatable!

In the DVD I received, the ""pilot"" episode irrevocably froze around the halfway mark, depriving me of the conclusion. As well, other episodes on DISC #1 were rife with a slew of problems, rendering the disc essentially to the status of garbage! While the other discs in SEASON 1 functioned reasonably well, I still felt ripped off by the deplorable condition of DISC #1. Overall, though, it is hard to beat the humour of ""I LOVE LUCY"", a show which does a truly admirable job of satirizing the vagaries of modern marriage! In my humble opinion, the purchase of subsequent seasons of ""I LOVE LUCY"" is well worth the price, but the purchase of SEASON #1 is a gamble on nebulous quality!",1380499200,,769,4.5

One of the bests eries ever made in the world the first season began in 1951 and the show became the highest-rated series in U.S. television and made stars of Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz, Vivian Vance and William Frawley.

 In this new repackaged edition (the first four seasons are being rereleased this way) fans get a chance to see Lucy in her first CBS sitcom at an even cheaper price than in other DVD releases. Since Lucy's two other sitcoms (""The Lucy Show"" and ""Here's Lucy"") will see a complete DVD release by the end of 2012 it only stood to reason that CBS would release ""I Love Lucy"" again.

 In this set you get all 35 season 1 episodes uncut, bonuses including the lost pilot, rare deleted scenes, production notes and so much more.

It's not going to effect the rating since I left the box set on top of my DVD player for several months, which could have effected the DVDs (though they were in the plastic boxes.

One thing I really liked about this DVD set when I originally watched it was all the outtakes, extra information, and stuff.  From the very first episode we were set up on Lucy, Ricky, and the Mertz's personalities and how they would interact together.  I think this series just gets better as it goes along.

Every episode will make you laugh.  The comedy is so funny that you can't help but giggle out loud!  At the end of the episode, you can't help but to wonder what the writers will think of next!

The chemistry between Lucy and Ricky is awesome.  I was shocked when I learned the two were already having major issues in their marriage.  I know this show was created to try to save their marriage, and perhaps it was nice to be able to act as the loving, happy married couple Lucy and Ricky captured onscreen.

1709535,5,B000065U38,"I Love Lucy, A Timeless Classic
First Season
 It all started in the late 1940s, when Lucille Ball played a silly and comic housewife, Liz Cooper, on My Favorite Husband radio sitcom.  During that time, television sales were on the high rise.  So naturally, CBS decided to move the show on television.  Ball agreed, but there was one little problem - she wanted to get rid of her radio husband, Richard Denning, and cast her real husband, Desi Arnaz.  Arnaz was a Cuban bandleader continuously on the tour, and Ball was in Hollywood pursuing her own career. Their marriage was on the rocks, this would be her last attempt to save her marriage.  CBS, however, ridiculed the idea.  All American girl married to a Cuban bandleader, this would push away television viewers.  Ball decided to prove CBS wrong.
During their summer vacation, Ball and Arnaz toured together putting on a live act performance created by the My Favorite Husband's writers.  The act was popular and well-reviewed. Eventually CBS agreed to fund a pilot starring the couple.  The first pilot was filled in 1951.  It was a victory.  CBS decided to pick up the show.  There was another problem, Ball and Arnaz wanted to stay in Hollywood and raise the family.  In fact, Ball was already pregnant.  During that time, almost all live shows were performed east in New York using the kinescope process, which had poor audio and video effect, and allowed later airing in the west.  With her already difficult pregnancy, Ball and Arnaz came up with a solution.  Their idea was to have the show filmed like a movie, rather than to be broadcast live allowing shows to be rerun.  This was very costly.  To stay in Hollywood, the couple agreed to significantly condensed salaries and reserved ownership of the show.  This would eventually make them into the first television millionaire stars, and the system devised back in 1951 by Freund is still the basis for most sitcoms used today.
I Love Lucy, the first complete season contains all 35 episodes and the pilot on DVD sold today.  A rare seen pilot feared lost, until the copy was found in 1980, and first aired in 1990 by CBS.  It's all about schemes and getting into showbiz.  The show is about a married couple living in a converted brownstone apartment complex on the east side of Manhattan.  Ricky (Desi Arnaz) is the orchestra leader in the Tropicana nightclub, and Lucy (Lucille Ball) a smart and wacky redhead housewife who always tries to join her husband in show business.  Ricky, of course, simply just wants her to be a housewife, cook, clean and fetch his slippers when he comes home.  On the show they are joined by their two close friends, former vaudeville performers and their landlords, Ethel and Fred Mertz (Vivian Vance and William Frawley).  Two families are close friends, but often split on gender roles when a problem arouses.
The first regular episode to be filmed was actually the fourth to be aired ""Lucy Thinks Ricky Is Trying To Murder Her"".  The first few episodes are still not as polished as those to come.  The writers were still trying to fully develop the script to fit with the characters, to hit their marks.  Season one comprises of a few classical episodes as ""The Freezer"" in which Lucy and Ethel's scheme to buy a walk in freezer goes totally twisted, the ""Diet"" in which Lucy starves herself to fit into size 12, and my least favorite ""The Sance"" where Lucy pretends to talk to dead.
One of the highlights of the first season is ""The Ballet"" where Lucy uses ballet and burlesque to break into one of Ricky's acts.  When Ricky pronounces that he needs to fill in the space on his show for a ballet and burlesque performers, Lucy naturally proclaims that she took ballet in high school for four years, and she would be perfect for the show.  In outrageously funny scene Lucy proves herself to be an agile klutz. But wait, then she teams up with a burlesque comic to learn the classic ""Slowly I turned"" routine.  This clich was ancient when it appeared on I Love Lucy, but the performers play it so well, even though so much time has passed, it seems innovative and vivacious to modern audiences.
Another audience favorite is the ""Lucy Does A TV Commercial"".  ""Hello, friends.  I'm your Vitameatavegamin girl.  Are you tired, run down, and listless?  Do you poop out at parties? Are you unpopular?  The answer to all your problems is in this little bottle."" -Lucille Ball as ""Lucy Does A TV Commercial""
These fifty year old episodes look and sound great, and even better than on many modern shows.  The black and white Freund's cinematography in these remastered episodes is fabulous.  Episodes are captioned.  The first season is filled with extras; some are more exciting than others.  The disc presents the ""Flubs"", or the mistakes that exist in the episodes that may have gone unnoticed by viewers.  Also, the disc details the ""Guest Cast"" of individual episodes.  Each episode contains the ""Original Opening"".
I Love Lucy spent four of its six prime-time seasons as the highest-rated series on television and never finished lower than third place.  ""Eisenhower's presidential inauguration in January 1953 drew twenty-nine million viewers, but when Lucy gave birth to Little Ricky in an episode broadcast the next day forty-four million viewers (72% of all U.S. homes with TV) tuned in to I Love Lucy. When it ceased production as a weekly series in 1957, I Love Lucy was still the number one series in the country (Anderson).""  Though the original series ended in 1957 its popularity has persisted; I Love Lucy is still watched by 40 million Americans each year, 60 years after its first episode aired.  It's the modern day ""The Nanny"" or ""Will and Grace"".  I Love Lucy is a timeless classic comedy that will be around for many years to come, and can be enjoyed by all age groups.  It's definitely a 5 out of 5 stars!",1330905600,2,5872,4.732283464566929

Then, as I got older and was able to understand the comedy of it, I, too, laughed out loud and still do. I am so glad they have put this timeless classic on DVD so us fans can watch it over and over again and relive our experience. Lucille Ball is comic genius, together with Desi Arnez, William Frawley & Vivian Vance,the show is, as it should be, an acclaimed hit.

Also, I love the fact that, in the beginning, they play the ""I Love Lucy"" song and have colorized Lucy, Ricky, Fred & Ethel so you can actually SEE what they look like and, yes, Lucy's hair really IS that bright RED/ORANGE. I only wish they had maybe colorized, perhaps more lightly colorized, the furniture and apartment because I would've liked to see what their apartment really looked like as well.

Timeless Classic. Wonderful to watch over and over again! My plan is to eventually end up with the whole series, one set at a time.",1285200000,2,1045,4.3538461538461535

1709566,5,B000065U38,"Before these season sets starting coming out, there was the Volumes collection, which was rather extensive, and costly, thankfully I never bought them (I had all the episodes recorded on tape), but then when I saw they were releasing 'I Love Lucy' as season sets, I was very happy, and knew they would eventually drop in price, so I waited a while, and this was the first one I got back in 2009, and I paid about $15.00 here at Amazon.

The packaging is fantastic, it's a 7 disc set, with 4 slim cases with the cover outside box, and three of the cases hold discs 1-6, the fourth case has disc 7, so packaging is nice for sure, and you get all 35 UNCUT season one episodes, which have all been restored and remastered, and they really look and sound good, but there is some dust in the print, and some of them look like they have a reddish tint to them, while others don't, but they are probably the best prints they had to work with, and for something that is over 50 years old, that's only a little gripe, so don't let that deter you from buying this, also you get the original pilot episode which has never been seen, the quality of that is quite bad, but again, probably the best print they had to work with.

Lots of great episode are found on season 1 such as 'The Diet' in which Lucy has to lose 12 lbs to be able to fit in a costume so she can get in Ricky's act, 'Men are Messy' Ricky is a slob, and Lucy tries teaching him a lesson, but at the end, Lucy is the one getting the lesson, 'The Fur Coat' in which Ricky brings home a mink stole for a girl to wear during a show, but Lucy thinks it's for her!, and the end result is absolutely hilarious, 'The Amateur Hour' in which Lucy decides to baby sit a kid, but it turns out to be double trouble for Lucy!, 'The Moustache' 'The Gossip' 'The Marriage License' 'The Kleptomaniac' 'and of course the infamous 'Lucy Does a TV Commercial' 'The Freezer' 'Lucy's Schedule' 'Ricky Asks For a Raise' are all classic episodes, and while I feel this is not the best season of the show, it certainly got off to a great start!",1283644800,2,2074,4.195488721804511
1709596,5,B000065U38,"Lucille Ball is just one of my Comedic Idols. She is so amazing and her shows are so entertaining.  They are timeless in the sence that every generation can enjoy them.  She had her skits down to a science and their are certain things she did that I don't think I've seen funnier. Both Lucy and Ricky were fantastic performers, and the show could not be more entertaining.  This is a great series to have in your video library.

I Love Lucy - Season 1: Vol. 1 -- I LOVE LUCY, Season 1, Volume One DVD - is the debut disc for the most popular TV sit-com of all time, starring Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz, Vivian Vance and William Frawley. Gregg Oppenheimer who is producing the delectable discs, delivers in a big way with I LOVE LUCY, Season 1, Volume one. The premier disc features Lucille Ball, American's redheaded First Lady of Comedy and her real life husband Desi Arnaz.  Produced by CBS and the couples production company, Desilu, the show is Television's most enduring sit-com.

From 1948-1951, Lucille Ball, then a B-movie star, embarked on a CBS produced radio show with Richard Denning who played her on-the-air hubby in the new situation comedy, MY FAVORITE HUSBAND. With television in its infancy, and radio on-the-way-out, CBS decided to transfer the somewhat successful radio show to network television.

Ball liked the idea but would make no deal unless her real-life husband replaced Denning as her significant other for the TV version. CBS wouldn't agree to Arnaz playing her television husband, stating the public would not buy the fact that Lucy was married to a Cuban.  This made no sense to Lucy since she and been married to Latin singer and orchestra leader, Desi Arnaz, for years! Not one to take no for an answer, Lucy and Desi went on the road, appearing together in a vaudeville type act that was immediately loved by the public and critics alike. Especially created ""clown"" bits and sketches were devised for Lucy by Ricky's longtime pal, Pepito, the clown. Desi and his orchestra completed the act with numerous musical highlights.

CBS, now convinced the couple could be a success as a Television team, along with Desilu Productions engaged MY FAVORITE HUSBAND, producer/writer, Jess Oppenheimer as head writer for the new I LOVE LUCY series.  Oppenheimer quickly engaged young writers Madelyn Pugh and Bob Carroll to create the vehicle for the couple. For the television version, titled I LOVE LUCY,  Desi would play Ricky Ricardo, a working-stiff band leader, and Lucy signed to play, Lucy Ricardo, his dizzy bitten-by the show-biz bug wife who wants to get into the act.

Several portions of the vaudeville act created for the Arnaz's by Pepito, Oppenheimer, Pugh and Carroll wound up in the I LOVE LUCY episodes featured on the Season 1, Volume One DVD.

The LOST PILOT EPISODE, or try-out episode, that eventually convinced CBS and sponsors to pick-up the show, features a traditional plot line of Lucy trying to get into Ricky's act. Here she performs a very comedic bit as a Professor of Music dressed in an over-sized man's coat and sporting a cello! The bit was originated in the Ball/Arnaz vaudeville road show and got roars of laughter at every showing. The writing, crazy props which included a toilet plunger and Lucille's performance i in the LOST PILOT EPISODE found on this DVD.

Early in Miss Ball's career when under contract with MGM she learned from Buster Keaton the value of props and ever since Lucille has incorporated them into her comedy.  Also, featured in the couple's touring vaudeville show was the Desi Arnaz song selection, ""Cuban Pete"". During the act, clad in a sequined green gown, Ball would bump and grind, knocking Desi's hat off his head when she finally makes her way into his act, in Episode #3 THE DIET. (MY FAVORITE HUSBAND, radio script ""Iris & Liz's Easter"" inspired this episode of ""Lucy"".)

Other episodes on the Season I, Volume one DVD disc include: Episode #1, THE GIRLS' WANT TO GO TO A NIGHTCLUB; [not the first episode filmed but the first one that aired] and Episode #2,  BE A PAL.

Other DVD goodies include a healthy Bonus Feature which includes: Flubs, Guest Cast, Radio Show  [Iris & Liz's Easter - entire radio broadcast], Special Footage [includes a ""lost"" sequence not seen since February 9, 1953], Original Cartoon Stick-Figure Opening sequence, and Behind The Scenes featuring an excerpt of Jess Oppenheimer's book ""Laugh, Luck, . . . and Lucy"" read by Larry Dobkin.

This DVD is excellent and marks the beginning of the world's love affaire with Lucy!  Feel the love, return to the safety of happier times gone-by and experience I LOVE LUCY Season 1, Volume One - I just know, once again, you'll love Lucy!

1709598,5,B000065U38,"Every Christmas, we buy a dvd set of a classic television show for our kids. This year we bought I Love Lucy Season 1. I was able to buy it here on Amazon in late Nov. for $9.99-- a great deal. My hope was that it would have all the episodes from season 1 without any butchering. Boy was I pleased! Not only no butchering, they were restored to their pre-rerun form. My kids are 13, 11 and 6 and we talked about how shows in the early days of TV had a sponsor whose products were mentioned often in the show. Phillip-Morris is the sponsor of ILL in season 1 and there IS a lot of smoking in the show. If you can get past that, then this is a nice set for kids. It includes ""flubs"" and audio segments of My Favorite Husband (the radio show on which ILL was based), the original opening (which they don't use for each episode, instead using the familiar satin and heart opening), etc. Fun.

1709628,5,B000065U38,"Lucille Ball was and is a true legend.  There has not been another comedienne with her rare, sharp comedic skills and expert timing since.  A lot of times with a series, even the best in history, it takes a season or two to hit its groove.  Not with I LOVE LUCY.  Many of the most classic episodes are here in the 1st season.  Years ago when the 1st season was first released on dvd it was for an outrageous price.  Other seasons followed at very amazing deals and now at last season 1 is at a price that is just unbeatable.

Imagine, all the 35 episodes from the 1st season shown uncut and digitally remastered.  The pilot episode is here as well as three complete episodes of Lucy's radio show MY FAVORITE HUSBAND on which I LOVE LUCTY was based.  Of course she refused to do it without her hubby Desi.  There is deleted footage, original opening sequences (they changed the intro to the famous heart when the show went into syndication).  There are also behind the scenes featurettes.  The list of extra goes on and on.

Of course these episodes are glorious for with this series Desi invented the three camera filming process as well as recording on film which preserved them for eternity.  The character of Lucy was inventive, original and also very believable from the very first episode.  Lucille Ball managed to do some hilarious slapstick and be in outrageous situations while remaing a beautiful lady with class and purpose.  All the antics had a reason that she managed to make very believable.  Of the classic episodes here we have THE BALLET, LUCY'S SCHEDULE, THE FREEZER, PIONEER WOMEN as well as the infamous LUCY DOES A TV COMMERCIAL which introduced us forever to Vitameatavegamin.

Need I say more.  The show is the most famous, best written and best acted comedy of all time.  If you love Lucy you must have this 1st season.  If you have lived under a rock and have not seen all these episodes you must invest in this to see a true comedic legend use her craft to exemplary results.  This show never appears dated.  It can be enjoyed as much today as when it first aired.  That is the true testament of a true classic.

Long live Lucy.",1222300800,4,2154,4.518134715025907

You can forget about Lucy with so much TV programming out there, but hopefully you don't miss it altogether.  The show is still the most brilliant situation comedy ever and even in it's first season was just amazing.  I couldn't leave my TV for several days in the evening watching these shows.  They are too good and really, really funny.  This seasons contained the classic Vegametavitamin commercial and the gigantic loaf of bread that pops out of the oven when Lucy puts too much yeast in it.  I had forgotten The Freezer but that was very funny too.  It was great to see what wonderful performers Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz were.  They gave themselves wonderful opportunities to enjoy their talents and showcase them to the world.  I am learning more about TV history too.  What a wonderful show.  The radio show My Favorite Husband, Lucy's radio show in the late 40s is pretty great too.  I am glad that was included.

1709735,5,B000065U38,"The I Love Lucy episodes are hilarious, and I will definitely be purchasing the rest of the seasons.

I really like the slim cases - takes up less room, and the fact the disks are single sided.

So far I have only watched Disk 1, (and it plays well) but I can't comment on the playability of the other disks (see next paragraphs).

All of my DVD's (on the silver side) have fingermarks on them, and there is this streaking all over them that sort of looks like milk (it's not milk, but that's what it looks like).

It sort of looks like something was spilled or sprayed on them at one time and they weren't dried properly. (Also, when I open the case to remove a DVD, there is a sort of chemical smell present, which I haven't noticed from other plastic cases). I have tried (gently) to remove these streaks, but they won't budge.  It is only an aesthetic thing (I hope), but it is disappointing that the DVDs didn't arrive in pristine condition.  (I wasn't too impressed with the fingermarks).

I only hope these streaks don't have an affect on the playability of the DVD's (or cause the DVD's to become unplayable over time).

It makes me wonder if the set was at some time returned, (maybe the disks could have been cleaned (that would account for the streaks/fingermarks)) and then simply re-wrapped to look like new.  Who knows?

Living in Australia, I can only imagine the difficulty I would have in returning the DVD's to Amazon, so it is just one of those things I have to risk when buying from overseas.

Reading comments re the playability of some DVD's (eg Dragnet, Adam 12 etc), somewhat deters me from purchasing such DVD's because I assume it isn't easy to organise returns (if needed).

Anyway, regarding I Love Lucy (1st Season), I am still giving the set a 5 star rating, because the content certainly deserves it.",1152230400,6,1831,4.515151515151516

Since then I've purchased the rest of the seasons and was relieved when they started making the slim more compact packaging.

The first version has 9 full size DVD boxes and only 4 episodes per DVD. It's like they had to work out the kinks. It took me a long time to decide to purchase the ""new"" First season because I already paid $95.00 for it the first time, but I am glad I did. They added in a colorized intro section with Ricky singing ""I Love Lucy"" that I just love. Not to mention it's smaller and matches my collection.

1709740,4,B000065U38,"I like the idea of season-by-season releases.  But in the case of ""I Love Lucy"" and a few other series (""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" and ""All in the Family"" spring to mind), this may not be the way to go.  Some of the greatest sitcoms in history had a rough start and took some time in the beginning to find their groove, but then really took off.  ""I Love Lucy"" is the perfect example.  This pioneer sitcom virtually invented the television sitcom genre.  When it started, they were doing things that are now standard in the industry, but had never done before: most notably, developing the three-camera technique for filming sitcoms in front of a live studio audience; before ""I Love Lucy,"" other comedies were either aired live from New York or, as in the case of ""Amos 'n Andy,"" shot on film with one camera (like a movie) without an audience.  So at the same time the crew behind this show (including star Desi Arnaz) were trying to invent and perfect the techniques for shooting a sitcom, the writers, director, and cast were trying to figure out how to create and develop sitcom plotlines and characters.  It was a daunting challenge because they really had nothing to go by.  They were entering unchartered territory.  And in the early episodes from the first season, this is evident.  The plots are often absurd, and the characters are roughly drawn and seem very cartoonish.

One issue with the plots is that the writers came straight over to ""I Love Lucy"" from Lucille Ball's 1948-1951 radio series, ""My Favorite Husband.""  They were inexperienced in television and apparently assumed that what worked on radio (like a wife half-heartedly disguising herself and fooling her husband) would work on television.  Often it didn't.  But they would soon learn their lesson.

By the time ""I Love Lucy"" returned for its second season, it seemed that all the creative talent behind the show -- the writers, the actors, the director -- had had some sort of epiphany.  The Ricardos, the Mertzes, even the minor players on the show, all played like real people, whereas they usually played like cartoons in the first season.  And the scripts had some basis in reality and no longer required viewers to completely suspend their disbelief:  there were no more six-foot loafs of bread popping out of the oven, no more icicles allowed to develop all over Lucy's body without a trip to the hospital, no more instances of Ricky deliberately electrocuting his wife.  The stories were now real.  The relationships were real.  You got the feeling the Ricardos and Mertzes truly did have a deep friendship extending back more than a decade.  The two marriages portrayed on this show seemed authentic.  With this believability underlying the comic brilliance of Lucille Ball; and the incredible chemistry between Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, between Lucille Ball and Vivian Vance, and between Vivian Vance and William Frawley; plus the wonderfully inventive scripts, this show from the second season on was pure magic.

I am definitely buying the DVD packages for seasons 2 through 6 (I've purchases seasons 2 through 4 so far).  The episodes from the last five seasons are, for the most part, phenomenal.  But I'm still hesitating on the first season.  For the aforementioned reasons, I find much of the first season hard to watch and not funny.  For those who have never seen this show (if it's possible that such a person exists) and are questioning whether or not to buy a DVD of this show to check it out, my advice: start with the second season.  Do not even look at the first season until you have seen seasons 2 through 6.

My three star rating is for the fine job that's being done putting together this series, and for the outstanding efforts of those involved in putting this show together starting with nothing.  But for Season One, I have to make a deduction for the overall quality of the show because it had not yet become the classic we know it to be today.  The other seasons all deserve five stars.",1142035200,18,4003,4.7398843930635834

1709783,5,B000065U38,"Well, the First Season of ""I Love Lucy"" is finally here on DVD. This is the newest edition for sale, and has 35 episodes (plus the pilot -- bringing it to 36 episodes) on just 7 discs. These are the original episodes of this classic series, filmed in 1951 and 1952. Though they are over 50 years old, the quality is just beautiful. There is no colorized version of the episodes, but it would just destroy the whole classic.

These episodes are the first few episodes of the series, and set the pace for the whole of the series. Its worth all you pay - since in the 1950s, seasons were almost 40 episodes long each (even though the seasons became shorter in this show towards the end of the run of the show.)

In addition, there's pretty cool bonus features.

Digitally Remastered and Restored: Each episode looks very good, and the sound and picture are restored to their highest extent.

Uncut Episodes - I never knew how much syndication butchers these priceless classics. The DVD edition has mentions of sponsers, cut scenes, many not seen since the 1950s.

13 Episodes from ""MY FAVORITE HUSBAND"" - The DVD even has 13, full, uncut episodes from Lucy's radio show, which became the inspiration for several I Love Lucy episodes. These haven't been heard since the late 1940s.

Flubs - Bloopers and interesting tidbits.

Original Openings - Unseen since the 1950s - the DVD has the two Season 1 openings used.

Overall, a 5/5. 5 stars. I would get this if you're an I Love Lucy fan. Hopefully, the other seasons will come out, and we can see ""The Lucy Show"" on season by season DVD, since its first season also ruled.

1709787,5,B000065U38,"I Love Lucy was revolutionary in many respects but the one that counts is this was the first comedy series filmed.  Before, they were shown live and kinescoped - camera filming in front of tv.  Therefore, this show has the clarity that no other of its time.

This is a seven DVD set in the new slimline holders so that it does not take up so much space. YEAH!!!

This set includes the Pilot and 35 year 1 episodes. These are the original uncut episodes.  With everything restored.  I Love Lucy was sponsored by Philip Morris and there was blatant product placement that has been edited out.  This has been restored.  Also edited down was the fade out music.  This has also been restored.  Much of this has not been seen or heard since 1952, including the restored versions shown on Nickelodeon in the 90's.

The classic episodes include:

The Diet - Ricky promises Lucy she can be in the show if she loses enough weight to fit into the Size 12 costume.

Men are Messy - Lucy is tired of Ricky's mess and they divide up the apartment.  This lasts until Ricky has a photo shoot and Lucy decides to teach him a lesson.

The Ballet - Ricky is putting on a new show.  He needs a ballet dancer and a burlesque comic.  Lucy first tries ballet but ends up doing the burleque.  But in the end the two get mixed up.

The Gossip - Lucy & Ethel bet Ricky & Fred that they can go longer without gossiping.  Ricky & Fred conjure up a story too good for Lucy and Ethel to resist.

Pioneer Women - Another girls vs. boys episode.  This one they roll back the clock to 1900.  The classic scene is making a loaf of bread.

The Freezer - Ethel's butcher uncle is retiring and he gives the girls his freezer.  Unfortunately, Lucy gets stuck in the freezer.

Lucy Does a TV Commercial - Vitameatavegamin - Does any need to say more.  The most famous scene of 50's TV.

Lucy's Schedule - Ricky has a new boss and he is trying to impress him on how organized he is by putting Lucy on a schedule.  This works until the girls including the boss' wife rebel. (This is the first teaming of Lucille Ball and Gale Gordon who will be here nemisis for the next 40 years.)

SPECIAL FEATURES -

Flubs - As each episode was filmed live with no retakes, there were obvious mistakes (and some previously unkown ones.)  Each disc has two to four of these.  These range from obvious (Ricky falls down the camera pans past the edge of the carpet) to the obscure (Ricky accidently saying a line in English instead of Spanish).

Special Footage - Most are lead in footage for rebroadcasts.  In those days, there were no reruns.  Therefore, they made these leadins to make it look like they were new shows!  There are also two special endings that were only used once.  One for Christmas and the other for the end of the season.

Original Opening - The opening we know and love was made for reruns.  On each disc is the original opening.

Lucy Radio Episodes - Many of episodes were inspired by her earlier radio show.

Guest Cast Information - The guest cast for each episode is listed with a breif history of each guest and the episodes that they appear on.

This is the first season on the show that would shape not just TV comedy but TV as a whole.",1129507200,9,3210,4.324369747899159
1709788,4,B000065U38,"The ""Long Lost Pilot"" of I LOVE LUCY makes for a better curiosity piece than anything.  It is probably the least humorous episode of the show ever, and it features far too much of Ricky Ricardo singing.  It does lay the groundwork for the running them of ""Lucy trying to get into Ricky's show"" but it offers little else.  Watch it once to see the roots of this classic...then move on never to return.

The other three episodes are all good, solid LUCY.  I feel like the show still didn't quite have its tone. Ricky dressed a bit more ""casual"" than he did in later shows in which he looks impossibly dapper and handsome.  Lucy's ""around the house"" wear is very frumpy.  Fred's personality is a bit too gruff.

But this is still essential viewing.  Just think of it...a TV showed filmed ""live"" (in one take) nearly 55 years ago, and it's still hilarious.  The moment when Ricky opens the door to check out his ""blind dates"" and there stands Lucy and Ethel in ""hick"" costumes is still priceless after all these viewings.  The show boiled comedy down to its core...loveable people doing really silly things.  There have certainly been a lot of great sitcoms since then, but while some may argue LUCY has been equaled, I don't think anyone has ever surpassed it.

Also, the show is a great way to look back at the mores of the 1950's.  In the first ""real"" episode, we get to see all four of them enjoying good, long smokes.  It's clearly not a habit but a TREAT for them to smoke.  And the idea of two women going alone to a nighclub, even the ritzy Copacabana, is unthinkable.  Contrast that to some of the things we see in sitcoms today.  True, sitcoms exagerrate reality to a great extent, but they also hold up a mirror to some degree as well.  I find LUCY shows fascinating...but mostly, I find them hilarious.  Check 'em all out!!",1128297600,2,1831,4.457831325301205

1709812,5,B000065U38,"I have only watched seasons one and two of I LOVE LUCY on DVD, but I must say that both the show and the DVD packaging are labors of love and well worth investing in.  The series has hysterically funny dialogue and inspired plotting from genius writers Jess Oppenheimer, Madelyn Pugh, and Bob Carroll, Jr.  Season one (1951-1952) has a special place in my heart because it was created when I was an infant; I was born in January 1951.

Some of the most famous episodes in the entire history of I LOVE LUCY are in Season One, which has finally been manufactured right--seven thin disks selling for about $50, not $100, and in very nice packaging.  The vitamin commercial is from season one.  And season two (1952-1953), also very nostalgic for me at age 1 or 2, is highlighted by the chocolate factory as season premiere and the birth of Little Ricky--seemingly the same day that Lucille Ball gave birth to Desi Arnaz, Jr.  I am told that the audience ratings have never topped that episode, which interestingly has reliable character actor Charles Lane in it.

The bonuses on these sets are labors of love--long-unseen and chilling Philip Morris cigarette commercials and animated cigarette opening credits; the ""hearts on velvet"" credits did not come in until syndication, when five minutes were cut from each episode for time.  They are finally uncut and non-commercial here--and remastered to look and sound brand new.  There are radio program tie-ins, behind-the-scenes production notes, bloopers and deleted scenes, everything you could want as a Lucy junkie.  Now I finally know why Lucy and Desi were smoking so much during the show--it was the blasted sponsor wanting to get its money worth, even at the expense of two actors who both died prematurely of lung cancer.

But this is all bonus material you do not have to watch if you  do not want to.  The important thing is that the greatest situation comedy in TV history is on reasonably priced DVD in beautiful packaging, uncut and non-commercial, for a whole season.  Lucy fans, this is heaven!  Dig in and buy big so that the whole series hits DVD in packaging this lovely.",1126310400,8,2135,4.779291553133515

1709816,5,B000065U38,"I treated myself to this long-desired DVD set as an early college graduation present, and it's one of the best presents anyone ever got me! ;-)

Included is every single episode of the first season, including the Lost Pilot, filmed on a single stage in 16MM (they had to keep cutting to change the sets).  EVERY SINGLE DISC has extras, and they are AMAZING.  Every single disc has a great line-up of ""flubs"" in various episodes, detailed production notes, stills, and details about how various musical bridges and footage cut out for syndication were restored to match the original broadcasts.  (The restoration is such a thing of beauty that I bet it actually looks & sounds BETTER than the original broadcasts!)  Some of the best extras are the footage that hasn't been seen on television since the show's original broadcast days, including openings for the shows that re-ran when Lucille Ball was given time off to have a baby, Christmas greetings and summer goodbyes to the audience.  These are all fun and diverting, but the BEST EXTRA BY FAR are the ORIGINAL RADIO BROADCASTS of ""My Favorite Husband"" which starred Lucille Ball, and which many episodes of ""I Love Lucy"" were based on.  I can't even BELIEVE that these were included -- I feel *incredibly* lucky to have them.  They provide almost as many hours of entertainment and laughs as the episodes themselves do, and I would have gladly paid a separate fee to own them, but they're included at no extra cost!  It's like buying a great house and having someone throw in a free luxury car with the purchase.  Even when you've watched all the episodes, these will keep you rolling the aisles for weeks afterward!  *EVERY CENT* of the price is justified just by the inclusion of these shows!

As someone who wasn't even born before most of this show's major players passed away, I grew up watching re-runs, and it's wonderful to be able to see every episode fully restored to the way it was originally aired!  (Minus the original opening credits -- they stuck with the ""heart on satin"" that didn't officially get added until the re-runs in the late 50s, but I'm elated it's here, since it adds to my childhood nostalgia.)  My mother never had to worry about me when I was watching ""Lucy"" -- this was truly a Golden Era of television, when you never had to worry about bared breasts or foul language, or images so grisly they belong in an R-rated film.  No, the only ""unwholesome"" thing in these DVDs is the frequent plugging for Phillip Morris cigarettes, which sponsored the show, and constant images of characters smoking.  Nowadays, such shameless advertisement would be seen as selling-out, and advertising cigarettes to kids would be even more hidously evil, but back then it was par for the course.

The best part about these DVDs are the surprises.  There are funny quotes from the show hidden behind some of the discs, the songs played in each episode are listed on the menu for that episode, and when you select the ""play all"" option on a disc, you get treated to a rendition of ""I Love Lucy"" (the song version Desi sings; true fans know exactly what I'm talking about) over a montage of colorized images from the show before the episodes begin.  The color is interesting, but it would have been better if they'd left well enough alone, as it looks entirely too fake.  But it's a nice surprise anyhow.  Nice also is the 35 (!!!!!) episodes you get!  Modern shows only have 22 at max, which is a shame -- especially for really funny comedies like ""Arrested Development"".  When it's good, the more the better!  I had no idea Lucy came out of the gate this funny.  In fact, I almost bought season 2, since I figured most TV shows got better after the bumpy first season, and was certain that all the classic Lucy episodes I had come to love from TV re-runs would be on the later seasons.  But when I saw the ""Vitametavegamin"" picture on the back of this box, I went for it, and I am so glad I did.  This show came in with a bang, and it's just as hilarious as I remember.

If I have to be nit-picky, the one thing I'll quibble about is the sound.  It's in mono, which I know is just like the original show, but come on, they could've mondernized SOMETHING.  I need my stereo sound!!  :-D  But the packaging is great -- all 35 episodes take up only a little more space than my other comedy DVD collections.  Every episode is preceded by its original air-date when you play it, and the original episode number is given along with its title & air date.  They never explain why the episodes weren't aired in what is supposedly the order, but hey, nothing's perfect.

However, this DVD is as close to perfect as they come.  After seeing this, I'm hungry for more.  Especially for the ""Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour"" DVD; that show was hilarious.  No one these days has the guts to make an hour-long comedy show, and that's too bad.  When did the rules get made that things could only be funny for 22 minutes?  Sheesh.  (Oh, another good point -- these episodes are longer than modern TV episodes.  Fewer commercials back then!  Then again, what did they need with commercials when the products were right there on the show?) But I'll just have to be patient until it's available, and keep my fingers crossed that the package and the price are as good a value.  EVERY NICKEL was worth it for this set!  (And I bought it in a retail store, where it wasn't even remotely on sale.)  In the meantime, I can't wait till I actually graduate -- then someone ELSE can get me the next-best present: Season 2!",1125273600,5,5549,4.5539858728557014

When season one was first released, it was huge and expensive.  Knowing how much I wanted the show, I ignored the price and bought it.  Now, over a year later, we get a set more in line with the other three released to date.  Now there are only seven discs, and it's much thinner.  This takes up a fraction of what the original did on my shelf.  Yet all the extras and quality are still there.  Believe me, I checked.

So what do you get?  You get the 35 official season 1 episodes plus the ""lost pilot"" that was found and released several years ago. The episodes have been restored and they haven't looked this good in years. Picture is original full frame black and white and sound is original mono. While there is occasional dust and such in the picture, for something 50 years old, this is pretty amazing.  Bonus features include behind the scenes trivia and photos, guest cast information, restored footage (some of which is a hoot), the original animated opening, and a total of thirteen episodes of Lucy's radio show ""My Favorite Husband"" that inspired certain episodes.

For me, I find some of the episodes near the start of season 1 to be rather slow and not as funny. This is a common complaint of mine with most TV shows. The writers and actors need time to find the characters before things really take off. Still, there are some early gems like ""The Diet"" and ""The Fur Coat."" The second half more then makes up for the first with many classic moments and hilarious episodes like ""The Ballet,"" ""Breaking the Lease,"" ""The Gossip,"" ""Pioneer Women,"" ""The Freezer,"" and ""Lucy's Schedule."" I can watch these episodes over and over again and laugh myself silly every time.

Of course, this doesn't mention the single most famous episode of season 1 - ""Lucy Does a TV Commercial."" If this title doesn't ring a bell, I have just one word for you. Vitameatavegamin.

1709885,5,B000065U38,"Over 50 years ago during the early years of broadcast television, the very inspired talents of Lucille Ball (1911-1989) and her then husband Desi Arnaz (1917-1986) were showcased on their hilarious television show ""I Love Lucy"". TV execs had initially rejected the plausibility of the show because of Desi and because they intended to tape the shows. However, thanks to the tireless efforts of Lucille Ball and Desi's obvious talents, the show first aired in 1951 and quickly became one of the most successful TV shows during all six of its regular seasons. As Lucy and Ricky Ricardo on ""I Love Lucy"", Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz were joined by William Frawley (1877-1966) and Viviane Vance (1909-1979) as their best-friends/apartment landlords of Fred and Ethel Mertz.

The first season of ""I Love Lucy"" that aired between 1951 and 1952 has 35 memorable episodes:

1. ""The Girls Want To Go To the Nightclub"": For the Mertzes' anniversary, Ethel & Lucy want to go a nightclub, but Fred & Ricky want to see the fights.

2. ""Be A Pal"": Thinking their marriage is going cold, Lucy joins Ricky for a poker game, then turns their apartment into a Cuban getaway.

3. ""The Diet"": To be in one of Ricky's shows, Lucy must lose 22 pounds. No steak for Lucy.

4. ""Lucy Thinks Ricky is Trying to Murder Her"": Lucy's mystery-book reading makes her suspicious of Ricky.

5. ""The Quiz Show"": Lucy goes on a game show to win money after Ricky cuts her allowance.

6. ""The Audition"": Lucy sneaks into Ricky's latest show as Buffo the Clown.

7. ""The Sance"": Reading horoscopes & numerology, Lucy gives Ricky bad advice; but tries to fix it with a hilarious sance.

8. ""Men are Messy"": Lucy divides their apartment in half when she tires of Ricky being messy, but goes whole-hog to impress a magazine photographer.

9. ""Drafted"": Lucy & Ethel think that Ricky & Fred have been drafted, but the men think the girls are pregnant.

10. ""The Fur Coat"": Lucy thinks that a mink coat that Ricky brought home is hers, but he only rented it for a show.

11. ""Lucy Is Jealous of Girl Singer"": Lucy sneaks into Ricky's show to spy on him and chorus girl Rosemary (Helen Silver).

12. ""The Adagio"": Lucy wants to learn the Apache dance from a Frenchman (Shepard Menken) and makes Ricky jealous.

13. ""The Benefit"": Lucy gets Ricky to perform for Ethel's womens club, but only if she can perform too.

14. ""The Amatuer Hour"": Lucy baby-sits two terrorizing boys to make money to pay for an expensive dress.

15. ""Lucy Plays Cupid"": Lucy tries to get to elderly singles together, but they get the wrong ideas.

16. ""Lucy Fakes Illness"": Lucy pretends to go nuts in order for Ricky to let her perform, but he gets even with her.

17. ""Lucy Writes a Play"": Lucy writes a play for her woman's club, but when Ricky won't do it, she changes it from Cuban to English. Ricky later changes his mind, but gets the wrong script.

18. ""Breaking the Lease"": After a fight, Lucy & Ricky want to move, but Ethel & Fred won't end their lease; so Lucy & Ricky have a little party.

19. ""The Ballet"":  Lucy gets ballet lessons from Madame Lamond (Mary Wickes) thinking that Ricky will let her perform at the club.  Ballet & burlesque don't mix.

20. ""The Young Fans"": Ricky & Lucy each have teenagers (Janet Waldo & Richard Crenna respectively) with crushes on them.

21. ""New Neighbors"": Against Ricky's orders, Lucy tries to met their new neighbors who she comes to think are enemy agents.

22. ""Fred and Ethel Fight"": Lucy & Ricky help Ethel & Fred end a days-old fight, but end up in a big fight themselves.

23. ""The Moustache"": Lucy dons a fake beard & mustache to get Ricky to shave, but she used the wrong glue.

24. ""The Gossip"": When boys bet the girls that they can't stop gossipping, Ricky cheats, but Lucy gets back.

25. ""Pioneer Women"": On a bet, everyone tries to live in accordance with late nineteenth-century technology with hilarious results. Look out for that bread!

26. ""The Marriage License"": Lucy thinks her marriage liscence with Ricky is invalid due to a misspelling.

27. ""The Kleptomaniac"": While collecting items for a women's club bazaar, Ricky thinks Lucy is a kleptomaniac.

28. ""Cuban Pals"":  Lucy gets jealous over a girl (now woman) who had performed with him in Cuba.

29. ""The Freezer"": The Ricardos & Mertzes purchase a used commercial freezer to save money, but Lucy gets locked in while trying to hide the beef.

30. ""Lucy Does a TV Commercial"":  One of the best episodes of all time with Lucy drinking too much Vitametavegamin for a TV commercial that Ricky begrudginly allows her to do.

31. ""The Publicity Agent"": Lucy pretends to be the ""Maharincess of Franistan"" to boost Ricky's sagging popularity.

32. ""Lucy Gets Ricky on the Radio"":  Lucy & Ricky go on a radio quiz show.

33. ""Lucy's Schedule"": Unhappy with Lucy's disorderliness, Ricky puts her on a tight schedule; but the wife (Edith Meiser) of his new boss (Gale Gordon) starts a woman's revolution. Look out for low-flying dinner rolls!

34. ""Ricky Thinks He is Going Bald"": When Ricky thinks he's going bald, Lucy resorts to tortuous hair-growing methods.

35. ""Ricky Asks For a Raise"": When Ricky's boss (Gale Gordon) won't give him a raise, Lucy, Ethel & Fred make bogus club reservations as multiple people and promptly leave when Ricky's not performing.

Paramount Home Video has no doubt done a superb job of repackaging the first season on 7 DVD's. Overall, I rate the ""I Love Lucy: The Complete First Season"" DVD box set with 5 out of 5 stars!",1116547200,187,5510,4.673236514522822

For those of you who have that other expensive set, take my advice: throw it away or sell it and get this set so you can save shelf space.

1709888,5,B000065U38,"When the first season of I LOVE LUCY was released in seperate volumes, I was more than a little upset. It seems that if a company wanted to save materials(and price value for its audience)then they would compile them all into one little box set. So, when season two was released in the better version and so on with three(soon to be coming four), I thought that it would look really peculiar if you set these four seasons up against each other. Subsequentley, Paramount is re-releasing the first season in a small box! This set was supposed to be released the same as Season Four but at the last minute they moved the date back. Why? Because they are making the box even SMALLER! Instead of having the original seven, seperate slimline cases, they are putting two in each slimline(it does fit well),making it contain only 4 slimlines(or the size of only two regular amaray DVD cases!). Can't wait for this one and I am more than happy that I didn't buy the original version; I knew that something better just had to be coming along and, well, here it is!",1114473600,7,1054,4.523560209424084
1709899,5,B000065U38,"Widely considered one of the greatest, if not the greatest, show in television history, I Love Lucy signaled the ascendance of the prime time TV era. The brainchild of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, I Love Lucy revolutionized the television industry with its extensive use of a live audience and the employment of multiple camera angles. The result of true comic genius, the show's ability to entertain is just as relevant today as it was fifty years ago...

Real-life couple Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz play the prominent roles of Lucy and Ricky Ricardo, a married couple living in a New York apartment complex. Ricky is a Cuban-born band leader who wows night clubs with his act, while Lucy is a homemaker. Lucy and Ricky's best friends are landlords Fred and Ethel Mertz who often become intertwined in Lucy's get-rich-quick schemes, screwball ideas, and comic shenanigans. Former masters of the stage, the cast comes across as a likeable bunch, with Lucille Ball stealing the show with her goofy antics and brilliant facial contortions. If ever there were a television classic, then I Love Lucy is it...

The I Love Lucy (Season 1) DVD offers a number of hilarious episodes including the series premiere ""The Girls Want To Go To The Nightclub"" in which Ethel seeks to celebrate her 18th Anniversary with a trip to the Copacabana, while Fred wants to go to the fights. When it's agreed that the girls will go to the club while the boys go to the fight, Fred and Ricky decide to spy on the girls so they call up a friend to get some dates for the club. But Lucy and Ethel have already talked to the same friend, and they decide to pose as Fred and Ricky's dates... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""The Quiz Show"" in which Lucy seeks to make some extra money by pulling off a fake stunt, and ""Drafted"" in which Lucy and Ethel mistakenly believe that Ricky and Fred have been drafted into the Army...

The DVDs will also be cut down to 7 instead of 9 which gives you more episodes per DVD. The will be one box set rather than 9 individual boxes. I encourage anyone who is in the process of buying that other more expensive version to wait because on May 3, 2005 this New slim pack and more affordable version will be released and the package looks a lot more like a DVD package should look, and less like a box that holds 9 DVDs. It has all the things the other version has but it is in a space saving package and is more affordable. The pilot and all 35 season 1 episodes are included on this classic sitcom!

1709904,5,B000065U38,"First of all, I'm a huge fan of ""I Love Lucy"".  I'm only 27, but this is one of the shows I used to watch constantly growing up.  So many fantastic moments which still stand the test of time over 50 years later.

Now I was very dismayed with the original release of the first season.  Originally, it was released as nine individual volumes.  These volumes were eventually bundled together in a box set labelled 'The Complete First Season'.

Well, needless to say, that set was a space hog.  The insane price tag of $120 was enough to make me pass it up.  Of course, I was tempted to get it, seeing as I wanted it so badly.

When season 2 was released, fans were treated to the slimmer packaging many have come to expect from a TV season release.  As a result of the first season's mishaps, I passed this up as well.

Now, on the same date as the season 4 release, Paramount has GONE BACK to the first season and repackaged it to coincide with the other seasons in the form of a 7 disc set!!  There has been no word yet if all the extras will be carried over to the new release, but I'm ecstatic nonetheless.  The set will be a 7-disc foldout digipack containing all episodes from the first season.  The price has been lowered incredibly as well, and will cost about the same as the other seasons of the show.

It just goes to show that sometimes it pays to wait!",1108944000,36,1362,4.224806201550388
1709905,5,B000065U38,"This is comedy writing at its best, to say nothing of the excellent acting.  Of course, not all episodes are equally as good, but there is brilliance here!  Also, having grown up in the 1950's, I love seeing all the wardrobe, furniture, accessories, and references to things I remember well from my childhood.  The other thing that makes this show stand out from all other comedies is that Lucy and Ricky are really married to each other, and there's a naturalness about the show that adds to the authenticity and pleasure in watching.",1099353600,7,535,4.731182795698925
1709906,3,B000065U38,"""I Love Lucy--the Complete First Season"" represents corporate greed at its absolute worst.  Shame on CBS video for what it did to ""Lucy"" fans everywhere.  First, they cut the season up into nine parts and sell them for $15 apiece, making fans wait nearly a year to get the entire season, but then they finally package it in one set and sell it for $120, which is outrageously expensive for a vintage TV collection, especially one that everyone has seen countless times over the past 50+ years.  Luckily, the justifiable anger of fans has been answered with the release of ""I Love Lucy--the Complete Second Season,"" which has been released as a complete set with more compact packaging and at roughly half the price.

As for the show itself, I must admit I'm not a big fan of the first season, as I find the performances, plots, and execution to be overly broad, and the production values are, to be honest, awful, especially in the first few episodes.  Granted, the show was pretty much under construction and can be forgiven because the producers and cinematographer Karl Freund were essentially inventing the sitcom, but compare the production values to the highly professional and polished episodes in Season three or four and you'll see what I mean.  As for the performances, it is obvious the actors are in the process of developing their characters and finding their footing (which is true of most shows today, admittedly) and have a tendency to mug for the camera, especially William Frawley as lovable Fred Mertz.  I'm sure this is unfair criticism, but I'm not reviewing the show's entire run, which I think rates it as at least one of the top five series in TV history, but this season in particular.  Still, the episodes pack many laughs and hint at the brilliance to come.

As for the performances, Lucille Ball plays Lucy Ricardo much more of a child-woman than she does in later seasons, and Desi Arnaz plays husband Ricky almost as a father figure instead of a partner.  Scenes with Ricky ""punishing"" Lucy with a spanking are especially offensive, although they must be put in context with the times this show was shot.  As for Frawley and Vivian Vance as best friends and landlords Fred and Ethel Mertz, Vance doesn't mug nearly as much as Frawley, but her constantly changing hairstyle, her rather ugly, dowdy wardrobe, and constantly changing personality is definitely distracting, especially in an early show in which she shows an interest in the paranormal that is totally out of character when contrasted with the more level-headed Ethel Mertz that she eventually morphed into.

As for the extras, they are great.  The package is stuffed with special features, including flubs, special long-lost introductory footage, cast lists, etc.  The long-lost animated sequences featuring eye-opening Phillip Morris tobacco product placement are also a great deal of fun.  But they still don't justify the ridiculous price of the package.

In all, ""I Love Lucy"" is one of the greatest shows in TV history with some of the most loyal fans of all-time, some of whom (myself included) have been fans since childhood and have stayed loyal for decades.  They deserve much better than the shoddy, greedy treatment they received from CBS video on this particular product.  *** (out of *****)",1094169600,36,3295,4.906306306306306
1709907,5,B000065U38,"I love ""I Love Lucy.""  Whenever I find it on TV, I watch and find myself laughing.  Naturally, it was one of the first shows I knew I wanted on DVD.  This set has good and bad points.  In reality, I'd probably give it 4.5 if I could.  But since I can't, I rounded up.
The biggest drawback is the price.  It's expensive!  Even though I've found it cheaper other places, it still costs a lot of money.  Of course, you do get 9 DVD for the price.  And if you bought the discs as they came out, you have no reason to get this set since you already have all the material.
On the plus side, you get the 35 official season 1 episodes plus the ""lost pilot"" that was found and released several years ago.  The episodes have been restored and I doubt they looked this good when they first aired.  Picture is original full frame black and white and sound is original mono.  Bonus features include behind the scenes trivia and photos, guest cast information, restored footage (some of which is a hoot), the original animated opening, and at least one episode per disc of Lucy's radio show ""My Favorite Husband"" that inspired certain episodes.
For me, I find some of the episodes near the start of season 1 to be rather slow and not as funny.  This is a common complaint of mine with most TV shows.  The writers and actors need time to find the characters before things really take off.  Still, there are some early gems like ""The Diet"" and ""The Fur Coat.""  The second half more then makes up for the first with many classic moments and hilarious episodes like ""The Ballet,"" ""Breaking the Lease,"" ""The Gossip,"" ""Pioneer Women,"" ""The Freezer,"" and ""Lucy's Schedule.""  I can watch these episodes over and over again and laugh myself silly every time.
Of course, this doesn't mention the single most famous episode of season 1 - ""Lucy Does a TV Commercial.""  If this title doesn't ring a bell, I have just one word for you.  Vitameatavegamin.
Is this a perfect set?  No, and its flaws are a little more obvious then most.  The good news is that future seasons of this classic show will be released in cheaper to buy full season sets.  In the end, if you love Lucy, you will be glad you spent the money to get this set.",1089676800,33,2202,4.37192118226601

When I first saw the individual DVD's it took all the willpower I could muster not to buy them, but I knew that a first season box set would be forthcoming.  What a DISAPPOINTMENT!!!  Simply the nine shrink-wrapped single DVD's placed in a cardboard box that appeared to have at least 5 seconds of design thought.  This is far below what I consider acceptable for a box set of the GREATEST TV SHOW OF ALL TIME!  Paramount should have started from scratch with a fold-out multi-disc set with original art and graphics, with of course photos incorporated as well (see CHEERS, The X-FILES, and the SOPRANOS to see how it should be done).  Also, the price is out of whack:  too expensive, but I would have gladly paid for proper packaging, not this TRAVESTY!

Get it while you can. Its cheaper getting the full set than each individual DVD. Also there is a bonus area in each DVD. The bonus area has things like behind the scenes of I Love Lucy, episodes from My Favorite Husband the radio show that Lucille Ball stared in that inspired I Love Lucy. The radio shows that are on each DVD are shows that the I Love Lucy TV show have coppied from My Favorite Husband; inspired some episodes. If that makes any sense. There are also special features, flubs, and the I Love Lucy original opening when it first aired on CBS. There are some more things on it too. So if you really think about it, it's not that bad of a price for the special features on it. Also you can either watch any episode in English or Spanish.

Two minor quibbles kept me from giving it 5 stars. First, since the set is boxed why does each individual DVD have to be sealed with 3 tape strips and then sealed in a plastic wrapper?

Well the discs must not be double-layered then.(not to be confused with double-sided)  Most current movie releases on DVD use single-sided and double-layered discs.

It is a waste of resources and bad for the environment to still create single-layered DVDs now that we've got the technology to better utilize the space on a plastic disc.  Then again, maybe the studio just got stuck with a load of obsolete single-layered discs from a couple years ago and are now trying to dump them.

Stop your moaning people about how you bought the DVD's individually and then out came the less expensive box set. More fool you for buying them! Naturally a box set would be released! And so what if it is not as compact as what it could have been? You should be thankful that  you have the thinner DVDs and not  videos. You should be thankful you have the opportunity to have them at all. You Americans should be thankful that  you didn't have to pay the postage and the duty charges that we have  to overseas. You should be thankful that they are releasing this show (will Gilligan's Island ever come out?). I must go have a closer look at the covers. I hadn't noticed how terrible they supposedly are (and I thought I had quite good taste in such things). Why is the world full of so many wingers?
Now, for those of you considering this purchase let me tell you a few things. The quality of the picture is magnificent. The sound of this vintage material is as good as they can get it, I am sure. And there are so many extras. A short bio of sorts of all guest performers (including Gale Gordon, Mary Wickes and so many others), interesting commentaries, extracts from radio shows, 'flubs' (on-air mistakes, etc), the names of every song performed plus more.
I Love Lucy, The Honeymooners and others of that era are unbeatable. I can't afford them all, especially if they continue to be this pricey. But I will accept it , get what I can and enjoy what I have got. It is true that if enough people refuse to buy them then they may release the next lot differently.

I was purchasing the ""I Love Lucy"" DVDs from Columbia House.  Four shows for $25, including shipping.  Then I saw Amazon was offering them for half of that price.  Talk about being ripped off!  So I cancelled the Columbia House shipments.  Then, out of the blue, I received another DVD from Columbia and there were 6 episodes on it!  So it IS possible to have 6 episodes, plus all of the extras, on one DVD.  For those who posted only 4 would fit, they're wrong.  There was absolutely no difference in quality AND there were the same number of extras.
I don't understand what is wrong with Paramount.  They should be offering entire seasons as well as separate DVDs.  That way, we have a choice plus we don't feel so ripped off.  I hope, too, that they ""speed it up!"" and issue the DVDs much faster than previously.

1709929,5,B000065U38,"I Love Lucy, complete season 1 boxset isn't really a boxset but a compilation of previous DVD's that have already been released.  Annoying yes, however, for the people who didn't buy them seperately it's complete happiness, for those diehard fans.  I myself bought them seperately, but thankfully Paramount released the last volume 9 for those who did buy them sperately. All you're missing is a box that keeps them inside.  Is this the most expensive television show to be released to DVD?  no it's not.  As an avid DVD buyer of many t.v. shows this one is quite a fair price.  Sailor Moon Season 1 and 2 UNCUT(Japanese) boxsets go for almost $200.00.  Yes Friends, The Simpsons, Sopranos and more are hugely popular and go at a lower price, but you have to remember that, Sailor Moon, I Love Lucy, and older shows like that were never Digitally Done.  So when transferring them to DVD...it more time, work and money.  For people complaining that they had to pay shipping costs...you could've easily went to your local Video Store (HMV, Virgin, MusicWorld, Sunrise, BlockBuster, even Wal-Mart) and purchased them there...They're not hard to find.  The Simpsons, Friends, and more go for about $50.00 but The Simpsons are on at least 10 times a day, as friends and other newer shows.  Be greatful that you're getting them, and stop complaining.  A lot people want them but can't have them, and there's always the choice of just waiting for them to come on t.v. to watch.  Everything else in this world is taken for granted.  Why does a silly DVD boxset make so many upset?  I give this Boxset a 5, not for the actual product but for the show itself.  I Love Lucy is remembered to this day and is still one of the greatest shows of all time.  A lot of hardwork and determination went into this show.  So it seems silly not to give it a 5.  On the other hand, if you're upset like this others who don't know better.  I guess a 1 or 2 star is a good score...Your desicion.",1064620800,7,1969,4.524079320113314
1709930,5,B000065U38,"Ok, a lot of you are complaining about the expensive price, the fact that there are only 4 episodes per disc, and various other things, I want to clarify a few things. I will start with the 4 episodes per disc thing. This is done to preserve the quality in sound and video. Keep in mind that along with 4 episodes you are also getting 1, 2, or 3 radio shows, biographies, bloopers, and more. Now if they put 6 episodes per disc then they may have to cram a 2nd, 3rd, or 4th radio show in, bloopers, and more on a disc (in most cases). The quality of the episodes would be compromised in this case. And because there are 36 episodes (not 35 as previously stated), 5 episodes per disc just won't work right. If you want proof in the fact that with 6 episodes + extras would compromise the quality, pick up a whole season of Friends. The first 3 discs have clear picture, while the 4th disc (the one with the extras) has somewhat fuzzy picture. As a final note on this leg of my rant, why would you put all the extras on a sepetare disc?!? That is just stupid. The fun in having the radio shows on a certain disc is to see how the radio episode became a tv episode. Then theres the flubs, I wanna see the clip with the flub then look for it in the episode, without changing discs. As for the price, remember that money is going to many different places on the sells of these dvds, and there are 9 dvds. If you cannot afford to shell out $70-$100 at once, buy the set in installmets. Season 1 was released that way it was so that some people, like children or those with tight budgets, can have some Lucy on dvd. And FYI, the only difference between the seperate dvds and those in the set is that these have a box. My final complaint is who in the world do some of you people think you are? Someone said that each set/seperate dvd should be released every 2 months. Um, hello! Gregg Oppenheimer is working very, VERY hard composing these dvds. If he rushes these you are going to see a lack in material and quality in the cover art. While the hot pink box may not look right with the yellow dvd boxes, get over it! You people need to be glad that I Love Lucy is on dvd. There are tons of fans of other shows out there who would kill to see there favorite show(s) released on dvd! Some of you need to just be greatful for what you have and just get over the fact that this release wasn't exactly as you wanted. And to all of you who are unaware, all future seasons have been said to be released in season sets only (hopefully in slimmer cases or something). ....",1064534400,15,2557,4.146881287726358

The retail price on this set is quite high, if I dare say, and the release must be very frustrating to those who eagerly awaited each volume and plunked down the cash.  Now those people can have a whole set of volumes for the first season and special box sets of the other 5!  SOMEONE WAS THINKING MAJOR MONEY HERE--BIG SURPRISE!

1709933,3,B000065U38,"Warning: this review contains heretical opinions! I will say up front that I was a HUGE Lucy fan as a kid. I remember laughing and laughing to the original episodes and then again to reruns years later. Truly, her comic timing was genius and the Desilu group assembled an original and historical entertainment. No doubt about that. I purchased several of the first DVDs to come out and savored the fun of introducing the hilarity of Lucy to my 7-year-old daughter. However, my hopes and memories were dashed. Yes, my daughter was really tickled by Lucy and her funny antics. But, as I watched with her, the veil fell from my eyes. This original show has not aged well. I'm not referring to the quality of the classic comedy itself, but the cultural mores of the time. The show was sponsored by Philip Morris and part of the Lucy cast contract was to huff down cigarettes at literally every opportunity. It was frankly gratuitous. Yes, I understand the deal and the times but I don't want my daughter to have that influence. Fair enough, you say, but surely you don't judge the work from this more enlightened era and through the eyes of a 21st century parent? No, there's more. I sat down with the shows to watch without my daughter, after my non-tv-watching wife griped at what I was showing our kid, and realized that there was a kind of mean-spirited and petty spirit that ran though the show, particularly from Lucy. She was vindictive, jealous, alternately seductive and infantile, materialistic, unstable, childish, and other things that perpetuate a historically nasty view of women. Yes, I know that this was all part of the humor (adult acts like a spoiled child), the incongruity of it all. And, yes, from the standpoint of the 50s, she was an opinionated woman and a trailblazer and, in real life, a successful businessperson. But, in seeing Lucy through the eyes of my free and strong daughter, I saw that my tastes have changed as well. This may also be colored by my knowledge of the subsequent Lucy vehicles (The Lucy Show, et al, which frankly ....) and by her famously bitter, unhappy personality, that tainted such failed comebacks as the ill-fated remake of Mame and Stone Pillow. Saddened at my ""loss of innocence"", I put my DVDs up for sale and they sold within 48 hours. Judging from the many ""New and Used"" available, maybe others have discovered what I did as well. I know that this new DVD series is a hot item. I say all this not to taint or hamper the Lucy legend; I still respect and ""love"" Lucy. But, I just have put a realistic spin on things so that other like-minded consumers may fully understand what they are buying before enthusiastically investing in all the new Lucy DVDs. So, in summary, adults: maybe no prob. With kids: think about what you are inputting. (Sigh) Life was so simple and fun back when we didn't know squat . . .",1062720000,10,2867,4.612524461839531

1709935,2,B000065U38,"Don't let the studio fool you - The ""I Love Lucy"" Complete First Season DVD boxed set is pretty much a cheap way for them to cash in on Ms. Ball's name value. Rather than repackaging the whole season in a concise manner that would benefit fans in terms of price (not to mention saving space), they have opted to take all of those individually-released volumes (with 4 episodes on each) and simply sell them in one great big bundle (thus explaining the very hefty price tag). No additional features are being added, either. So why even bother if every volume can already be bought on its own? I dunno. I guess with such a timeless show, you'd expect the studio to be a little more fair and rewarding to Lucy's fans.

Like many TV shows, the first episodes aren't the strongest.  Lucy is the only character fully developed at this point with the other three delivering straight lines.  Still, there are several good laugh an episode.
It would be nice if the show were being released in season, or even half season sets.  But this certainly isn't settling for second best since it's a great DVD.",1042934400,9,1042,4.559139784946237

Ignore the fact that there are only 4 episodes on this DVD; I imagine a full season DVD of LUCY will come out eventually. I'm not the least bit disappointed because this DVD contains the restored pilot episode- thought to be lost to the public for years. BTW, is it just me, or does the pilot look like a kinescope rather than movie-quality film (the stock that Desi Arnaz insisted on for all the subsequent episodes)? This coarseness and scratchiness of the pilot episode just adds to its classic antiquity- not to mention that Mrs. Arnaz' rather bulky wardrobe was attempting to conceal a real-life pregnancy (her first one) at the time.

THE DIET is the one where Lucy does a beautiful job once on stage at Ricky's Tropicana club, but she ends up with malnutrition!  The PILOT isn't exceptionally funny, yet it was ""missing"" for over 4O years and it's a fascinating sequence for fans who have never seen it: quite different from the series, with Lucy noticeably pregnant with Lucie, her hair much longer, etc.",1038614400,2,857,4.562091503267974

I haven't read anywhere why the first episode filmed was the fourth episode put to air (and is therefore on the Season1 Volume2 DVD - my next purchase) but the first episode to air which is on this DVD really brings the supporting cast into the show.  Lucy and Ricky work well together but the cast of 4 is what made me laugh, with Ethel and Fred getting some of the best lines.  The old radio episode (there is just one on this DVD in which Gale Gordon stars) was just fascinating.  I have to admit my reason for buing this DVD was more because I'm interested in ""old television"" than in Lucy, but it was so entertaining I'll be buying at least the next one in the series.",1037404800,2,931,4.231638418079096

Even Columbia Home Entertainment has followed releasing full season sets like ""All in the Family"", ""The Jeffersons"" and ""Sanford and Son"". But Paramount seems to have miss the boat. Even with the films they release they have no extras. Look at their release of the ""Carol Burnett Show - Show Stoppers"" it runs at only 42min and is priced at the rate of say a movie like the 2 disc set of E.T...

1709945,4,B000065U38,"The first season of ""I Love Lucy"" the most classic of television situation comedies had a 50.9 rating in the Nielsen ratings, which meant that half the television sets in the country were tuned into CBS on Monday nights at 9:00.  Unlike most recent television DVD sets which offer an entire season as a set, the first season of ""I Love Lucy"" is coming out on DVD four episodes at a time.  Volume 1 offers up the original pilot episode, and the first three episodes of the series.  All of these episodes were written by the team of Jess Oppenheimer, Madelyn Pugh, Bob Carroll, Jr., who would stay with the show for its first five season:
""The Lost Pilot"" was kinescoped on March 2, 1951 as an audition episode with which to woo potential backers for the show.  Desi and Lucy play Larry and Lucy Lopez in what was a rewrite of the vaudeville skits the couple were doing on tour patched together with an old ""My Favorite Husband"" radio scripts (a lot of the first season episodes of ""I Love Lucy"" had similar points of origin).  In a story that will sound familiar as the years go by, Lucy is determined to break into show business and decides to replace the ailing clown (Pepito the Clown) in her husband's nightclub act.
Episode 1, ""The Girls Want to Go to a Nightclub"" (October 15, 1951) for the Mertzes' anniversary, but Fred and Ricky would rather go to the fights.  Lucy and Ethel dress up as hicks and show up as the boy's blind dates.  This battle of the sexes sets the tone for the show's perpetual subtext, although the recurring theme is Lucy trying to get into showbiz.
Episode 2, ""Be a Pal"" (October 22, 1951) has Lucy taking advice from a self-help text and trying to keep her marriage fresh by becoming Ricky's pal.  Now if only Ricky could figure out what Lucy is REALLY up to.
Episode 3, ""The Diet"" (October 29, 1951) is what Lucy is using to lose 12 pounds in just two days so she can be a part of the chorus line in Ricky's nightclub act.  An early opportunity for Lucy to do the physical humor that was her forte.
The value of Volume 1 is in the historical importance of both the original pilot and the show's first episode.  Even though it has little resemblance to what actually aired, the ""lost"" pilot is the funniest of the bunch (compare Lucy's comic antics at the end of the pilot with the similar but lesser hijinks at the end of Episode 1).  None of these first three televised episodes would be considered classic Lucy shows and they are really rather pedestrian all things considered.  Note: Episode 1 was the first episode aired, but it was not the first episode taped.  That would be ""Lucy Thinks Ricky Is Trying to Murder Her,"" which can be found on Volume 2.  See you there.",1034380800,14,2705,4.42741935483871

1709947,4,B000065U38,"First, I must start by saying that these are by far the cleanest, clearest prints of ""I Love Lucy"" I've ever seen, and they sound great too.  The restored opening of ""The Pilot"" is much better than it was presented on TV and video (""I Love Lucy: The Very First Show""), where the missing narrative was provided by Lucie Arnaz.  Finding the original announcer to recreate the opening 50 years later was an inspired decision, and although it's a kinescope, ""The Pilot"" looks almost as clear as the episodes themselves.  Also, the few episodes of Lucy's radio series ""My Favorite Husband"" included on these discs are a real treat.  I'd never heard them before, and they are just as funny as the TV series.  I hope they continue to include more of these.  The extras are interesting, especially when they show before-and-after restoration footage.  However, like many reviewers here, I wish there were more episodes per disc.  With ""The Pilot"", 179 half hour shows, a Christmas Special, and 13 hour-long episodes, my ""Lucy"" DVD collection will reach half-way to the moon by the time they're finished being released. I also wish the original openings had been restored to each episode, instead of being ""extras"", and the animated act-changes and original closing credits are nowhere to be seen.  If restoring these segments was done for two episodes on a laser disc a few years back, and is being done brilliantly on TVLand now, why not on these DVDs?  I doubt watching these amusing animations will inspire anyone to take up smoking cigarettes.  And how about putting some of the original commercials on as extras?  Also, during the radio shows, all we get is a still of Lucille Ball behind a microphone, with a collage of scenes from ""I Love Lucy"" behind her.  Surely there must be some photos of the ""My Favorite Husband"" cast that could be shown, perhaps as a slide show, during the episodes (still, I guess it's better than staring at a radio as the original listeners did!).  Nevertheless, despite my disappointments, I will continue to buy these as they come out, and have already pre-ordered Volumes 3 and 4.  I never get tired of watching ""I Love Lucy"", and, in the final analysis, it's the shows themselves--the best sitcom ever made--that I am collecting here, everything else is just gravy.",1032825600,10,2296,4.806615776081425
1709948,4,B000065U38,"I am a huge fan of I Love Lucy and was so glad to see the episodes finally come out on DVD, but I wish they were being distributed by someone else. The current distributors are only putting 4 episodes on each DVD, when they could fit at least twice as many, plus extras. And I think the bonus material was good but not great. At this rate, if you want to own the entire first season, your DVD/tape cabinet will be full before you can even begin collecting the second season. I wish they put at least 10 episodes on each DVD and charge a little more, so we don't have to try to store all these DVDs, search through them for certain episodes, and change them from the player as often. Shame on the distributor for wanting to make more money and not thinking about the customer's convenience! I also feel the packaging should be more special for one of the most popular T.V. shows ever.",1032307200,6,883,4.261904761904762
1709949,5,B000065U38,"I have watched ""I Love Lucy"" in syndication for many, many years; but I have never seen the episodes with as much clarity, and restoration as provided on this DVD, and I have seen every single episode multiple times!
Since broadcast TV and cable TV (especially broadcast) are prone to noise, watching ""I Love Lucy"" on DVD is probably the clearest it has ever been seen, except for audience members who watched the show taped live in the 1950's.  Also, broadcast & cable TV stations never show the episodes in their entirety anymore, since they cut scenes in order to make more time for commercials.  With this DVD, you can watch the first 3 aired episodes and the unaired original pilot commercial-free, completely clear and completely restored!
One of the many bonuses on this DVD is being able to have the bloopers from each episode highlighted, and I hadn't noticed many of them before since I was usually too busy laughing!  Another added bonus is being able to hear Lucille Ball on the radio-show ""My Favorite Husband"" with the actor Richard Denning, that she did prior ""I Love Lucy"".  I had never heard the radio-show prior to purchasing this DVD and Volume 1 contains 2 radio-show episodes.  (After listening to the radio-show, I was so glad that Lucille Ball was able to convince network executives to have Desi Arnaz co-star with her because ""I Love Lucy"" would never had been the same without him!)  Other bonus material includes guest actor information, still photos taken during filming, lost scenes, and the original show introduction!
Before purchasing this DVD, I had some misgivings because I didn't know if it would be worth owning since I have seen all of the ""I Love Lucy"" episodes so many times; but after watching it, I was more than pleased and I now plan to purchase the rest of the DVD's for the entire series!
Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz may have had their problems in real life, but their comic performances in ""I Love Lucy"" (as well as the performances of Vivian Vance and William Frawley) have brought billions of people to laughter the world over!
I am so glad that purchased this DVD, as well as Volume 2, and I plan to purchase the other volumes as they become available.  My only complaint is that entire seasons are not being offered in boxed sets, but that won't prevent me from getting the other volumes.",1031011200,,2339,4.690243902439025

I just wonder why they insist on only putting 4 episodes on each disc. Why couldn't they do like MASH, and release an entire season on a 3 DVD set, then throw in an extra disc loaded with special features?

at an average of $13 (lowside) for 4 episodes (There were 179 episodes in the entire series), you're looking at quite a bit of money.  For the same number of MASH episodes at approximately $30 for 24 episodes (7 seasons worth), you're looking at [price]. I really feel that Lucy fans are being taken advantage of here.

...  But do the math.

What you paid for 1 volume of Lucy Season 1 x 6 (# of discs for a full season)

Multiply by 7 (the number of years lucy was on)

Total cost

Compare that to what MASH will run you for 1 season and multiply by 7.  See how much you could save?",1027468800,12,919,4.117977528089888

THE GIRLS WANT TO GO TO A NIGHTCLUB - The official ""First Episode"". Ethel decides to take Fred to a nightclub for their 18th wedding anniversary, but Fred and Ricky want to go to a prize-fight instead. Lucy and Ethel masquerade as Southern hayseeds in order to scare them.

THE DIET - Lucy wants to be Ricky's new dance partner in his act, so she begins a whirlwind diet in order to land the part. Featuring Lucy and Desi perfoming ""Cuban Pete/Sally Sweet"".

1709953,5,B000065U38,"I am an 18 year-old Lucy fan. I've been watching this show since I was 9 or 10 years old, and my mother in turn watched it as a child before me, and my grandma when it was in first run. This show is that classic, that good. It transcends time, space and the generation gap. These four gems are no exception. I had never seen the ""lost"" pilot before (well, it was lost, but has been found since 1990 or so), so that was a treat for me. Ethel and Fred aren't in it, but it's still hilarious anyway. It's easy to see all the promise this show obviously had. The 2nd show on the tape is labeled episode ""2"" when it's really one. They consider the lost pilot ""1"" even though it wasn't aired till 1990, and isn't exactly part of the series. I'm sure I don't need to tell you what the episodes are about if you're already thinking of buying this, but I'll do it briefly anyway.
""The Girls Want to Go to a Night Club"" is about Fred and Ethel's anniversary. Fred and Ricky want to go to the fights, and Lucy and Ethel want to go to a club. It features some of the great Desi Arnaz peformances that we've all come to know and love, plus the slap-stick comedy Lucy is known for. Nuff said.
In ""Be A Pal"" Lucy thinks that Ricky is getting bored with her, so Ethel gives her tips on how to spark his interest from one of those pop-psychology book list book of the week books, you can imagine the results (or better yet, buy this and watch if you don't already know, lol, even if you do know, it's still worth it).
""The Diet"" of course is about the time Ricky needed a new dancer who could wear a size 12. Lucy needed to lose 12 lbs. to fit into it in less than a week though. In the end she does it, and they do one of my favorite Lucy songs, ""Cuban Pete."" They're so sweet together when they sing that song. If for no other reason that that, this is one of my favorites.
There are only two flubs, but what can you expect, they just didn't tape behind the scenes stuff, and they did the shows straight through a lot, so many ""flubs"" stayed in and are now just a part of the show.
It's dubbed in Spanish, I have yet to watch it in Spanish. I'm a Spanish major, so I just might. I haven't listened to the radio show yet either, but I may do that tonight. Desi isn't in it, but it should be interesting. They go the idea for ""The Diet"" from that show.
All and all, a great dvd, very worth the money. Buy these and maybe they'll put some more out.",1026604800,2,2430,4.033126293995859
1709954,5,B000065U38,"People incensed that we are not getting these a season at a time are neglecting to review the product itself. This DVD is SPLENDIFEROUS.
The picture quality is gorgeous -- the lighting looks as good as movie stills. And these are complete episodes -- remember that in syndication we have always seen them with bits chopped off except on Nickelodeon (did you ever wonder why the audience was often already laughing when the show started? It was because the syndicated version cut in AFTER the original beginning).
We get a whole episode of the radio show MY FAVORITE HUSBAND -- one of the few old radio shows that still holds up for us moderns with minor adjustment. One cannot really understand what I LOVE LUCY ""was"" historically without starting with MY FAVORITE HUSBAND; what a great idea to put episodes on these DVDs. (Maybe it will help turn LUCY fans on to old radio -- if you love Lucy, there is a lot of, particularly, late 40s radio comedy that you will love as well, and old radio is now cheaper and more available than it has ever been before in this era of MP3 files.)
We get the pilot -- complete with the original announcer restoring the lost first few seconds of the voice-over 50 years later! (Why, though, is it listed as 45 minutes but takes up ten minutes less time?)
And then also bonuses like an alternate laughtrack over an ending, a clip used for a rerun not seen since 1953, etc.
This is the definitive presentation of this show, in a medium that does not turn to dust on the shelf after 20 years. This is very, very special.
The truth is that like all shows, I LOVE LUCY took a little while to get its sea legs; I do not consider these first three to be the best of the run by any means. But their historical value is obvious, and here they are for us to possess forever.
As for the piecemeal release schedule, honestly, I find getting 20-odd episodes at a time a little overwhelming. I guess it depends on your lifestyle, but for me sets like that are an instant huge backlog waiting to be taken in bit by bit, kind of like a massive book you never seem to finish. I LIKE getting to sample the whole run of this show four shows at a time -- you can see them all at your leisure and maybe even repeat them. It's kind of like belonging to a book-of-the-month club. And as one reviewer said, a whole season set with all the little extras would be a REAL monster.
I do have one complaint, though. It WOULD be better if we could see the episodes with their original credits every time, rather than just having the original opening as a separate bonus. (Is it that clean negatives of that opening no longer exist?) And also, what about the original commercials, often done on set, and often by Lucy and Desi? I hope we can see these in later editions.
But overall, this is a milestone achievement. One thing, though -- the people who are eating this up would surely relish a similar release of the first three seasons of THE LUCY SHOW. What is available of this show concentrates on the later seasons that hinged on tacky star guests. But these were not good television; the plots are boneheaded, the performances are kindergarten-broad, and the whole show was resting on its laurels by then. The earlier LUCY SHOWS were as good as I LOVE LUCY, especially the first season in crisp black-and-white with lots of Vivian Vance. Paramount and CBS Video take note -- a nice box set of the first season of the LUCY SHOW would sell big.",1026604800,26,3450,4.417582417582418
