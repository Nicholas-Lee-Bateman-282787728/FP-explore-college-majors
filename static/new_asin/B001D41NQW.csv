8291601,4,B001D41NQW,"This Video shows a very good insight on archery and the way of shooting, very helpful if you're just starting to shoot",1387152000,,118,4.409090909090909
8291602,5,B001D41NQW,"My family found the information in this DVD to be very useful.  If you don't have access to a top coach, little can compare to visual instruction.  Reading about technique is one thing; seeing it is another.  We love that Brown is a top instructor, as it lets us know that the information he is giving is correct.  Don't want to learn how to do it wrong.  Definately recommended.  I love that this features sport (Olympic) recurve bows, as well as hunting style bows, and that they are addressed seperately.",1312416000,,507,4.5777777777777775
8291603,1,B001D41NQW,"The two DVDs by Lloyd Brown appear to present one of the more brazen ripoffs
at Amazon. 32 minutes for beginners at $26.99 and 37 minutes for Advanced at $30 totalling
69 minutes at $56.99 are one of the most expensive dvds around at about 83 cents per minute
of material that could have all been presented in 15 minutes for about $15.
You can get all of the symphonies of the greatest composers for less than the cost
of these two DVDs.
For about twice the cost of these things you can buy a good recurve bow, a few arrows, a target
and learn to shoot with a few hours practice and some basic instruction from the store where
you got the equipment.
Good material from a fine instructor on a great sport at an absurdly high price.
The USAA should scold him for discouraging potential members with such
profiteering.",1285718400,,815,4.403973509933775
