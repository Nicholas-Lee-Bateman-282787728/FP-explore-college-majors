8659187,4,B00KI5SH5W,"Devil's Business keeps it short and to the point. It's a smart move as you don't have time to think about the decisions of the characters and there's no downtime for the tension to release. It's just an increasingly odd thriller that ends up combining everything that disreputable movies are known for in interesting ways. It's got a low budget but they make it work. The characters talk like Harold Pinter types without the pretense. It's got an interesting pagan vibe like early Clive Barker and The Witch's Claw. It even has that weirdly disquieting feeling one gets from particularly off episodes of Matt Berry related comedies. If you like stuff like Matt Berry, Ben Wheatley, or the newer horror stuff coming out of the US with guys like Adam Wingard and Ti West, you'll probably like this.",1462924800,,796,4.77536231884058
8659188,4,B00KI5SH5W,"Tell me if you've this one before... Two hitmen walk into a mansion waiting for their prey to come home...
BUT... these 2 hitmen are engaging verbalists. The movie clocks in at just a wee bit over an hour and a good 50 minutes are nothing more than these 2 guys chit-chatting. It's like My Dinner With Andre except they also have weapons. For those of you who have read that this film has a lot in common with the over-rated Hit List, don't be mislead. The ONLY thing the 2 films have in common is a severe left turn twist at the end. PERIOD. But what a WTF doozy this ending delivers.",1432944000,,585,4.185840707964601
8659189,5,B00KI5SH5W,"Sean Hogan's second full length film (running at a modest 74 minutes) is a brave exercise in literary, psychological horror. Reminiscent of a ""Twilight Zone"" episode or perhaps more appropriately an episode of ""Thriller"" with Boris Karloff, it has the feeling of a play by E.F. Benson.

The mood, right from the start of the film, is a sort of otherworldly dread.  Two hitmen, one aged (and looking every bit the elevator operator from hell) and one every bit the youthful moron wait in a man's house to kill him.  He has something their boss covets.

Things don't go well at all. Sitting in the to-be victim's home, we learn a bit about Pinner, the older murderer played by Billy Clarke, a fine actor. The dialogue is gut wrenching, as the illusion of ""casually killing someone"" is dispelled with the talk of a loving woman murdered and rolled up in a rug by his boss. By the end of the night both will know what they are made of.  Especially Pinner.

This is a neon lit, elegant descent into Baudelairean moral decay. While ""Lie Still"" still strikes me as Hogan's crowning glory, I have a feeling this will age well. Recommended to all fans of the macabre.",1424304000,2,1158,4.570048309178744
