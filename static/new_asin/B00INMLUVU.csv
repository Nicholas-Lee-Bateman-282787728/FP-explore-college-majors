6282926,5,B00INMLUVU,This series was still going strong in season 7. Looking forward to seasons 8 and 9 in near future.,1404950400,2,98,4.2105263157894735
6282927,5,B00INMLUVU,Warner Archives continues to  release this  classic tv series.  The  episodes  are  well written and the  acting  first rate. I would  say that  the  series holds up quite well compared to any of  today's shows.,1403308800,3,211,4.714285714285714
6282928,4,B00INMLUVU,"From a time in our history that was the beginning of the 'law and order' period, this show helped to assure the country that the FBI was working diligently to protect us from the evils the 'sex, drugs and rock-and-roll (and espionage!)' of the 60's,.  Of course, it would be several more years before we found out the truth about J. Edgar, and the lawlessness that was ACTUALLY going on within the agency itself at that time.  But this show was a reminder that 'truth, justice and the American way' (ok, so that was actually from ""Superman""...) would not be derailed; just when you've lost all hope, there was the FBI to make things right again!

I've often wondered just how much liberty was taken between the actual cases that ""inspired"" each episode, and what the producers ended up making.  If anyone knows of any list, for example, that correlates the episodes with the underlying case that the episode was based on, I'd love to know about it.

As the seasons progress, the technical aspects of the show gets much better.  There is ONE episode in Season 7 that had a weird sound mix:  You heard people talking, but between dialogue, it was like the mic was cut off--NO background noises.  Very noticeable.

Finally....I LOVE looking at what are now vintage automobiles!  When they say 'vehicles supplied by Ford Motor Co.', they MEAN it.  The only time you see non-Ford vehicles, is on what looks like 'stock shots' taken at random.  I'm not complaining, because I love seeing these cars in their pristine states.  But it is noticeable.

In summary....I hope Season 8 isn't long in coming!",1400716800,6,1594,4.707581227436823
6282929,5,B00INMLUVU,"Love this show. Picture and audio not to bad. I love Zimbilist he is great. Sorry to hear of his passing. Although, that is all the more reason to get Season 8 out and going.",1399334400,5,174,4.0
6282930,1,B00INMLUVU,"$60.00 for ONE season of a forty year old TV show?  I really liked this show but at $59.99 I'll live with my fuzzy, but fond, memories.  Forget about it!",1398124800,9,153,4.066666666666666
6282931,5,B00INMLUVU,"Release day, I'm always hoping for a surprise. Warner Brothers has been great at releasing from their vault, and this is no exception.  I've watched several episodes, and the ""lineup's"" been great.  Efrem and Colby are in top form as seasoned veterans. Amazon has the mod warning on them again, but that will only be after the studio runs out of the initial release. I think that the actual show looks excellent, I can't believe that there's only two more to go! Thanks to Amazon for making this available to their customers, especially our overseas neighbors.",1393891200,10,560,4.822916666666667

I have hedged purchasing the individual seasons and half seasons because the price is ridiculous for manufactured on demand discs MOD's. I am very interested in purchasing the complete series if it's on permanent silver backed discs, as this series is definitely a keeper!",1405296000,3,377,5.0

8643689,4,B00INMLUVU,"The first episode on disc 1 had a bad spot that kept locking up, but I skipped that section (chapter jump) & the rest of the episode, the disc, and the set was fine.  Minus one star for that, but otherwise I'm very happy with this.  I didn't feel a few minutes of bad video was worth sending back & having to QC the whole season all over again.",1518307200,,344,3.971014492753623
