8260235,2,B0015XHR34,I don't know who's idea it was to take these poor films and put them into a tin can collection. I am kicking myself for buying it. Maybe I can pan it off at a flea market or something. It comes in a nice package. That is the best I can say about it.,1275696000,3,249,3.6296296296296298
8260236,2,B0015XHR34,"Let me just set you straight, none of the movies in this collection are really worth watching with the possible exception of Roman, and only then if you can get it very cheaply and only then if you are a huge Morrissey fan, or you are married to Morrissey or you ARE Morrissey. That said, unto the breach:

PROM NIGHT: What a wallflower! It starts with a bunch of kids playing in an abandoned warehouse. Little, tag-along sister falls out a second story window and dies. The remaining kids make a pact to never speak of this again. Six years later on the anniversary of the lil' kid's death, on which date the Big Prom Event is also taking place, someone starts to stalk and kill the irresponsible punks who never reported their evil deed.  Jamie Lee Curtis is fine as the dead girl's older sister and Leslie Nielsen plays it straight as her father and the local principal but it's Ann-Marie Martin who gets the most points for her portrayal of the catty Wendy, really the only entertaining person in the film. There is scarce blood, less suspense, paltry thrills and a complete and tragic lack of nekkid, rutting teens so I'd give this one a pass.

SKELETON MAN: Basically what we have here is a supernatural version of Predator on the very, very cheap. This movie isn't just short on budget dollars; it's short on talent and know-how as well. It's discouragingly bad. The Skeleton monster looks like something you'd put in your window at Halloween and there is a scene where some stray bullets hit a tree and produce sparks. Sparks?! Was it one of those new metal trees you hear about nowadays? This isn't ""fun"" garbage; this is careless, inept, cheap garbage. I will say though, that I did like the sword-wielding Medicine Man who really, really wanted a can of beans.

MORTUARY: The Evil That Will Not Die is.....mold. Or Fungus. Some sort of household nuisance which is slightly more dangerous than waxy yellow build-up. It gives off some fumes that turn teens into nasty, crazy zombies. The deadest thing in this Mortuary is director Tobe Hooper's career. I can only say for shame Tobe Hooper, for shame.

ROMAN: This isn't a straight horror movie but more of an emo-horror-rom-com. It's some kind of experimental meditation on life, death, art and beans. You might love it; you might decide you've had more than enough after a few minutes. I dunno but it is odd and sometimes interesting. The strangest & most interesting part of this movie is that it features Mr. Cub himself, Ernie Banks, in his first appearance in an emo-horror-rom-com. Kristin Bell might surprise you.",1266278400,4,2580,4.699115044247788
